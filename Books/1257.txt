CONCLUSION\r\n EPILOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR\xe2\x80\x99S PREFACE\r\n\r\nIn which it is proved that, notwithstanding their names\xe2\x80\x99 ending in _os_\r\nand _is_, the heroes of the story which we are about to have the honor\r\nto relate to our readers have nothing mythological about them.\r\n\r\nA short time ago, while making researches in the Royal Library for my\r\nHistory of Louis XIV., I stumbled by chance upon the Memoirs of M.\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, printed\xe2\x80\x94as were most of the works of that period, in which\r\nauthors could not tell the truth without the risk of a residence, more\r\nor less long, in the Bastille\xe2\x80\x94at Amsterdam, by Pierre Rouge. The title\r\nattracted me; I took them home with me, with the permission of the\r\nguardian, and devoured them.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention here to enter into an analysis of this curious\r\nwork; and I shall satisfy myself with referring such of my readers as\r\nappreciate the pictures of the period to its pages. They will therein\r\nfind portraits penciled by the hand of a master; and although these\r\nsquibs may be, for the most part, traced upon the doors of barracks and\r\nthe walls of cabarets, they will not find the likenesses of Louis XIII.,\r\nAnne of Austria, Richelieu, Mazarin, and the courtiers of the period,\r\nless faithful than in the history of M. Anquetil.\r\n\r\nBut, it is well known, what strikes the capricious mind of the poet is\r\nnot always what affects the mass of readers. Now, while admiring, as\r\nothers doubtless will admire, the details we have to relate, our main\r\npreoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had\r\ngiven a thought.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan relates that on his first visit to M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, captain\r\nof the king\xe2\x80\x99s Musketeers, he met in the antechamber three young men,\r\nserving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor\r\nof being received, bearing the names of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.\r\n\r\nWe must confess these three strange names struck us; and it immediately\r\noccurred to us that they were but pseudonyms, under which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nhad disguised names perhaps illustrious, or else that the bearers of\r\nthese borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which,\r\nfrom caprice, discontent, or want of fortune, they had donned the\r\nsimple Musketeer\xe2\x80\x99s uniform.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment we had no rest till we could find some trace in\r\ncontemporary works of these extraordinary names which had so strongly\r\nawakened our curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue alone of the books we read with this object would fill a\r\nwhole chapter, which, although it might be very instructive, would\r\ncertainly afford our readers but little amusement. It will suffice,\r\nthen, to tell them that at the moment at which, discouraged by so many\r\nfruitless investigations, we were about to abandon our search, we at\r\nlength found, guided by the counsels of our illustrious friend Paulin\r\nParis, a manuscript in folio, endorsed 4772 or 4773, we do not\r\nrecollect which, having for title, \xe2\x80\x9cMemoirs of the Comte de la F\xc3\xa8re,\r\nTouching Some Events Which Passed in France Toward the End of the Reign\r\nof King Louis XIII. and the Commencement of the Reign of King Louis\r\nXIV.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt may be easily imagined how great was our joy when, in turning over\r\nthis manuscript, our last hope, we found at the twentieth page the name\r\nof Athos, at the twenty-seventh the name of Porthos, and at the\r\nthirty-first the name of Aramis.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of a completely unknown manuscript at a period in which\r\nhistorical science is carried to such a high degree appeared almost\r\nmiraculous. We hastened, therefore, to obtain permission to print it,\r\nwith the view of presenting ourselves someday with the pack of others\r\nat the doors of the Acad\xc3\xa9mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, if we\r\nshould not succeed\xe2\x80\x94a very probable thing, by the by\xe2\x80\x94in gaining\r\nadmission to the Acad\xc3\xa9mie Fran\xc3\xa7aise with our own proper pack. This\r\npermission, we feel bound to say, was graciously granted; which compels\r\nus here to give a public contradiction to the slanderers who pretend\r\nthat we live under a government but moderately indulgent to men of\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nNow, this is the first part of this precious manuscript which we offer\r\nto our readers, restoring it to the title which belongs to it, and\r\nentering into an engagement that if (of which we have no doubt) this\r\nfirst part should obtain the success it merits, we will publish the\r\nsecond immediately.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, as the godfather is a second father, we beg the\r\nreader to lay to our account, and not to that of the Comte de la F\xc3\xa8re,\r\nthe pleasure or the _ennui_ he may experience.\r\n\r\nThis being understood, let us proceed with our history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Three Musketeers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.\r\nTHE THREE PRESENTS OF D\xe2\x80\x99ARTAGNAN THE ELDER\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the first Monday of the month of April, 1625, the market town of\r\nMeung, in which the author of _Romance of the Rose_ was born, appeared\r\nto be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the Huguenots had just\r\nmade a second La Rochelle of it. Many citizens, seeing the women flying\r\ntoward the High Street, leaving their children crying at the open\r\ndoors, hastened to don the cuirass, and supporting their somewhat\r\nuncertain courage with a musket or a partisan, directed their steps\r\ntoward the hostelry of the Jolly Miller, before which was gathered,\r\nincreasing every minute, a compact group, vociferous and full of\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nIn those times panics were common, and few days passed without some\r\ncity or other registering in its archives an event of this kind. There\r\nwere nobles, who made war against each other; there was the king, who\r\nmade war against the cardinal; there was Spain, which made war against\r\nthe king. Then, in addition to these concealed or public, secret or\r\nopen wars, there were robbers, mendicants, Huguenots, wolves, and\r\nscoundrels, who made war upon everybody. The citizens always took up\r\narms readily against thieves, wolves or scoundrels, often against\r\nnobles or Huguenots, sometimes against the king, but never against the\r\ncardinal or Spain. It resulted, then, from this habit that on the said\r\nfirst Monday of April, 1625, the citizens, on hearing the clamor, and\r\nseeing neither the red-and-yellow standard nor the livery of the Duc de\r\nRichelieu, rushed toward the hostel of the Jolly Miller. When arrived\r\nthere, the cause of the hubbub was apparent to all.\r\n\r\nA young man\xe2\x80\x94we can sketch his portrait at a dash. Imagine to yourself a\r\nDon Quixote of eighteen; a Don Quixote without his corselet, without\r\nhis coat of mail, without his cuisses; a Don Quixote clothed in a\r\nwoolen doublet, the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade\r\nbetween lees of wine and a heavenly azure; face long and brown; high\r\ncheek bones, a sign of sagacity; the maxillary muscles enormously\r\ndeveloped, an infallible sign by which a Gascon may always be detected,\r\neven without his cap\xe2\x80\x94and our young man wore a cap set off with a sort\r\nof feather; the eye open and intelligent; the nose hooked, but finely\r\nchiseled. Too big for a youth, too small for a grown man, an\r\nexperienced eye might have taken him for a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s son upon a journey\r\nhad it not been for the long sword which, dangling from a leather\r\nbaldric, hit against the calves of its owner as he walked, and against\r\nthe rough side of his steed when he was on horseback.\r\n\r\nFor our young man had a steed which was the observed of all observers.\r\nIt was a B\xc3\xa9arn pony, from twelve to fourteen years old, yellow in his\r\nhide, without a hair in his tail, but not without windgalls on his\r\nlegs, which, though going with his head lower than his knees, rendering\r\na martingale quite unnecessary, contrived nevertheless to perform his\r\neight leagues a day. Unfortunately, the qualities of this horse were so\r\nwell concealed under his strange-colored hide and his unaccountable\r\ngait, that at a time when everybody was a connoisseur in horseflesh,\r\nthe appearance of the aforesaid pony at Meung\xe2\x80\x94which place he had\r\nentered about a quarter of an hour before, by the gate of\r\nBeaugency\xe2\x80\x94produced an unfavorable feeling, which extended to his rider.\r\n\r\nAnd this feeling had been more painfully perceived by young\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x94for so was the Don Quixote of this second Rosinante\r\nnamed\xe2\x80\x94from his not being able to conceal from himself the ridiculous\r\nappearance that such a steed gave him, good horseman as he was. He had\r\nsighed deeply, therefore, when accepting the gift of the pony from M.\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan the elder. He was not ignorant that such a beast was worth\r\nat least twenty livres; and the words which had accompanied the present\r\nwere above all price.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy son,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old Gascon gentleman, in that pure B\xc3\xa9arn _patois_ of\r\nwhich Henry IV. could never rid himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthis horse was born in the\r\nhouse of your father about thirteen years ago, and has remained in it\r\never since, which ought to make you love it. Never sell it; allow it to\r\ndie tranquilly and honorably of old age, and if you make a campaign\r\nwith it, take as much care of it as you would of an old servant. At\r\ncourt, provided you have ever the honor to go there,\xe2\x80\x9d continued M.\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan the elder, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94an honor to which, remember, your ancient\r\nnobility gives you the right\xe2\x80\x94sustain worthily your name of gentleman,\r\nwhich has been worthily borne by your ancestors for five hundred years,\r\nboth for your own sake and the sake of those who belong to you. By the\r\nlatter I mean your relatives and friends. Endure nothing from anyone\r\nexcept Monsieur the Cardinal and the king. It is by his courage, please\r\nobserve, by his courage alone, that a gentleman can make his way\r\nnowadays. Whoever hesitates for a second perhaps allows the bait to\r\nescape which during that exact second fortune held out to him. You are\r\nyoung. You ought to be brave for two reasons: the first is that you are\r\na Gascon, and the second is that you are my son. Never fear quarrels,\r\nbut seek adventures. I have taught you how to handle a sword; you have\r\nthews of iron, a wrist of steel. Fight on all occasions. Fight the more\r\nfor duels being forbidden, since consequently there is twice as much\r\ncourage in fighting. I have nothing to give you, my son, but fifteen\r\ncrowns, my horse, and the counsels you have just heard. Your mother\r\nwill add to them a recipe for a certain balsam, which she had from a\r\nBohemian and which has the miraculous virtue of curing all wounds that\r\ndo not reach the heart. Take advantage of all, and live happily and\r\nlong. I have but one word to add, and that is to propose an example to\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94not mine, for I myself have never appeared at court, and have only\r\ntaken part in religious wars as a volunteer; I speak of Monsieur de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville, who was formerly my neighbor, and who had the honor to be, as\r\na child, the play-fellow of our king, Louis XIII., whom God preserve!\r\nSometimes their play degenerated into battles, and in these battles the\r\nking was not always the stronger. The blows which he received increased\r\ngreatly his esteem and friendship for Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville. Afterward,\r\nMonsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville fought with others: in his first journey to Paris,\r\nfive times; from the death of the late king till the young one came of\r\nage, without reckoning wars and sieges, seven times; and from that date\r\nup to the present day, a hundred times, perhaps! So that in spite of\r\nedicts, ordinances, and decrees, there he is, captain of the\r\nMusketeers; that is to say, chief of a legion of C\xc3\xa6sars, whom the king\r\nholds in great esteem and whom the cardinal dreads\xe2\x80\x94he who dreads\r\nnothing, as it is said. Still further, Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville gains ten\r\nthousand crowns a year; he is therefore a great noble. He began as you\r\nbegin. Go to him with this letter, and make him your model in order\r\nthat you may do as he has done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon which M. d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan the elder girded his own sword round his son,\r\nkissed him tenderly on both cheeks, and gave him his benediction.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the paternal chamber, the young man found his mother, who\r\nwas waiting for him with the famous recipe of which the counsels we\r\nhave just repeated would necessitate frequent employment. The adieux\r\nwere on this side longer and more tender than they had been on the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94not that M. d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan did not love his son, who was his only\r\noffspring, but M. d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was a man, and he would have considered it\r\nunworthy of a man to give way to his feelings; whereas Mme. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nwas a woman, and still more, a mother. She wept abundantly; and\xe2\x80\x94let us\r\nspeak it to the praise of M. d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan the younger\xe2\x80\x94notwithstanding the\r\nefforts he made to remain firm, as a future Musketeer ought, nature\r\nprevailed, and he shed many tears, of which he succeeded with great\r\ndifficulty in concealing the half.\r\n\r\nThe same day the young man set forward on his journey, furnished with\r\nthe three paternal gifts, which consisted, as we have said, of fifteen\r\ncrowns, the horse, and the letter for M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x94the counsels being\r\nthrown into the bargain.\r\n\r\nWith such a _vade mecum_ D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was morally and physically an exact\r\ncopy of the hero of Cervantes, to whom we so happily compared him when\r\nour duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his\r\nportrait. Don Quixote took windmills for giants, and sheep for armies;\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan took every smile for an insult, and every look as a\r\nprovocation\xe2\x80\x94whence it resulted that from Tarbes to Meung his fist was\r\nconstantly doubled, or his hand on the hilt of his sword; and yet the\r\nfist did not descend upon any jaw, nor did the sword issue from its\r\nscabbard. It was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite\r\nnumerous smiles on the countenances of passers-by; but as against the\r\nside of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length, and as over\r\nthis sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty, these\r\npassers-by repressed their hilarity, or if hilarity prevailed over\r\nprudence, they endeavored to laugh only on one side, like the masks of\r\nthe ancients. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, then, remained majestic and intact in his\r\nsusceptibility, till he came to this unlucky city of Meung.\r\n\r\nBut there, as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the Jolly\r\nMiller, without anyone\xe2\x80\x94host, waiter, or hostler\xe2\x80\x94coming to hold his\r\nstirrup or take his horse, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan spied, though an open window on\r\nthe ground floor, a gentleman, well-made and of good carriage, although\r\nof rather a stern countenance, talking with two persons who appeared to\r\nlisten to him with respect. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan fancied quite naturally,\r\naccording to his custom, that he must be the object of their\r\nconversation, and listened. This time D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was only in part\r\nmistaken; he himself was not in question, but his horse was. The\r\ngentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors;\r\nand, as I have said, the auditors seeming to have great deference for\r\nthe narrator, they every moment burst into fits of laughter. Now, as a\r\nhalf-smile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man,\r\nthe effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of\r\nthis impertinent personage who ridiculed him. He fixed his haughty eye\r\nupon the stranger, and perceived a man of from forty to forty-five\r\nyears of age, with black and piercing eyes, pale complexion, a strongly\r\nmarked nose, and a black and well-shaped mustache. He was dressed in a\r\ndoublet and hose of a violet color, with aiguillettes of the same\r\ncolor, without any other ornaments than the customary slashes, through\r\nwhich the shirt appeared. This doublet and hose, though new, were\r\ncreased, like traveling clothes for a long time packed in a\r\nportmanteau. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a\r\nmost minute observer, and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that\r\nthis stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nNow, as at the moment in which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan fixed his eyes upon the\r\ngentleman in the violet doublet, the gentleman made one of his most\r\nknowing and profound remarks respecting the B\xc3\xa9arnese pony, his two\r\nauditors laughed even louder than before, and he himself, though\r\ncontrary to his custom, allowed a pale smile (if I may be allowed to\r\nuse such an expression) to stray over his countenance. This time there\r\ncould be no doubt; D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was really insulted. Full, then, of this\r\nconviction, he pulled his cap down over his eyes, and endeavoring to\r\ncopy some of the court airs he had picked up in Gascony among young\r\ntraveling nobles, he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword\r\nand the other resting on his hip. Unfortunately, as he advanced, his\r\nanger increased at every step; and instead of the proper and lofty\r\nspeech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge, he found nothing\r\nat the tip of his tongue but a gross personality, which he accompanied\r\nwith a furious gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, sir, you sir, who are hiding yourself behind that shutter\xe2\x80\x94yes,\r\nyou, sir, tell me what you are laughing at, and we will laugh\r\ntogether!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier, as\r\nif he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that\r\nsuch strange reproaches were addressed; then, when he could not\r\npossibly entertain any doubt of the matter, his eyebrows slightly bent,\r\nand with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described,\r\nhe replied to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI was not speaking to you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am speaking to you!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young man, additionally\r\nexasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners, of\r\npoliteness and scorn.\r\n\r\nThe stranger looked at him again with a slight smile, and retiring from\r\nthe window, came out of the hostelry with a slow step, and placed\r\nhimself before the horse, within two paces of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. His quiet\r\nmanner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the\r\nmirth of the persons with whom he had been talking, and who still\r\nremained at the window.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, seeing him approach, drew his sword a foot out of the\r\nscabbard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis horse is decidedly, or rather has been in his youth, a\r\nbuttercup,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the stranger, continuing the remarks he had begun,\r\nand addressing himself to his auditors at the window, without paying\r\nthe least attention to the exasperation of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who, however,\r\nplaced himself between him and them. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a color very well known in\r\nbotany, but till the present time very rare among horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are people who laugh at the horse that would not dare to laugh\r\nat the master,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young emulator of the furious Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not often laugh, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9cas you may perceive\r\nby the expression of my countenance; but nevertheless I retain the\r\nprivilege of laughing when I please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cwill allow no man to laugh when it\r\ndispleases me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the stranger, more calm than ever; \xe2\x80\x9cwell, that\r\nis perfectly right!\xe2\x80\x9d and turning on his heel, was about to re-enter the\r\nhostelry by the front gate, beneath which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan on arriving had\r\nobserved a saddled horse.\r\n\r\nBut, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him\r\nthus who had the insolence to ridicule him. He drew his sword entirely\r\nfrom the scabbard, and followed him, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cTurn, turn, Master Joker,\r\nlest I strike you behind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrike me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, turning on his heels, and surveying the\r\nyoung man with as much astonishment as contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my good fellow,\r\nyou must be mad!\xe2\x80\x9d Then, in a suppressed tone, as if speaking to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is annoying,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a godsend this would\r\nbe for his Majesty, who is seeking everywhere for brave fellows to\r\nrecruit for his Musketeers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely finished, when D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan made such a furious lunge at\r\nhim that if he had not sprung nimbly backward, it is probable he would\r\nhave jested for the last time. The stranger, then perceiving that the\r\nmatter went beyond raillery, drew his sword, saluted his adversary, and\r\nseriously placed himself on guard. But at the same moment, his two\r\nauditors, accompanied by the host, fell upon D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan with sticks,\r\nshovels and tongs. This caused so rapid and complete a diversion from\r\nthe attack that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s adversary, while the latter turned round\r\nto face this shower of blows, sheathed his sword with the same\r\nprecision, and instead of an actor, which he had nearly been, became a\r\nspectator of the fight\xe2\x80\x94a part in which he acquitted himself with his\r\nusual impassiveness, muttering, nevertheless, \xe2\x80\x9cA plague upon these\r\nGascons! Replace him on his orange horse, and let him begone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot before I have killed you, poltroon!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, making the\r\nbest face possible, and never retreating one step before his three\r\nassailants, who continued to shower blows upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother gasconade!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cBy my honor, these\r\nGascons are incorrigible! Keep up the dance, then, since he will have\r\nit so. When he is tired, he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with;\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter. The fight was\r\ntherefore prolonged for some seconds; but at length D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan dropped\r\nhis sword, which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick.\r\nAnother blow full upon his forehead at the same moment brought him to\r\nthe ground, covered with blood and almost fainting.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that people came flocking to the scene of action\r\nfrom all sides. The host, fearful of consequences, with the help of his\r\nservants carried the wounded man into the kitchen, where some trifling\r\nattentions were bestowed upon him.\r\n\r\nAs to the gentleman, he resumed his place at the window, and surveyed\r\nthe crowd with a certain impatience, evidently annoyed by their\r\nremaining undispersed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how is it with this madman?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed he, turning round as the\r\nnoise of the door announced the entrance of the host, who came in to\r\ninquire if he was unhurt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Excellency is safe and sound?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes! Perfectly safe and sound, my good host; and I wish to know\r\nwhat has become of our young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is better,\xe2\x80\x9d said the host, \xe2\x80\x9che fainted quite away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut before he fainted, he collected all his strength to challenge you,\r\nand to defy you while challenging you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this fellow must be the devil in person!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, your Excellency, he is not the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the host, with\r\na grin of contempt; \xe2\x80\x9cfor during his fainting we rummaged his valise and\r\nfound nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crowns\xe2\x80\x94which however, did\r\nnot prevent his saying, as he was fainting, that if such a thing had\r\nhappened in Paris, you should have cause to repent of it at a later\r\nperiod.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger coolly, \xe2\x80\x9che must be some prince in disguise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you this, good sir,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the host, \xe2\x80\x9cin order that you\r\nmay be on your guard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he name no one in his passion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; he struck his pocket and said, \xe2\x80\x98We shall see what Monsieur de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville will think of this insult offered to his _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9_.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville?\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, becoming attentive, \xe2\x80\x9che put\r\nhis hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of Monsieur de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville? Now, my dear host, while your young man was insensible, you\r\ndid not fail, I am quite sure, to ascertain what that pocket contained.\r\nWhat was there in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA letter addressed to Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, captain of the\r\nMusketeers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly as I have the honor to tell your Excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe host, who was not endowed with great perspicacity, did not observe\r\nthe expression which his words had given to the physiognomy of the\r\nstranger. The latter rose from the front of the window, upon the sill\r\nof which he had leaned with his elbow, and knitted his brow like a man\r\ndisquieted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured he, between his teeth. \xe2\x80\x9cCan Tr\xc3\xa9ville have set\r\nthis Gascon upon me? He is very young; but a sword thrust is a sword\r\nthrust, whatever be the age of him who gives it, and a youth is less to\r\nbe suspected than an older man,\xe2\x80\x9d and the stranger fell into a reverie\r\nwhich lasted some minutes. \xe2\x80\x9cA weak obstacle is sometimes sufficient to\r\noverthrow a great design.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHost,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9ccould you not contrive to get rid of this frantic boy\r\nfor me? In conscience, I cannot kill him; and yet,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, with a\r\ncoldly menacing expression, \xe2\x80\x9che annoys me. Where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my wife\xe2\x80\x99s chamber, on the first flight, where they are dressing his\r\nwounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis things and his bag are with him? Has he taken off his doublet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, everything is in the kitchen. But if he annoys you,\r\nthis young fool\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure he does. He causes a disturbance in your hostelry, which\r\nrespectable people cannot put up with. Go; make out my bill and notify\r\nmy servant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, monsieur, will you leave us so soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that very well, as I gave my order to saddle my horse. Have\r\nthey not obeyed me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is done; as your Excellency may have observed, your horse is in the\r\ngreat gateway, ready saddled for your departure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well; do as I have directed you, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said the host to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cCan he be afraid of this\r\nboy?\xe2\x80\x9d But an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short; he\r\nbowed humbly and retired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not necessary for Milady* to be seen by this fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nthe stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will soon pass; she is already late. I had better\r\nget on horseback, and go and meet her. I should like, however, to know\r\nwhat this letter addressed to Tr\xc3\xa9ville contains.\xe2\x80\x9d And the stranger,\r\nmuttering to himself, directed his steps toward the kitchen.\r\n\r\n* We are well aware that this term, milady, is only properly used when\r\nfollowed by a family name. But we find it thus in the manuscript, and\r\nwe do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the host, who entertained no doubt that it was the\r\npresence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry,\r\nre-ascended to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s chamber, and found D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan just recovering\r\nhis senses. Giving him to understand that the police would deal with\r\nhim pretty severely for having sought a quarrel with a great lord\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nin the opinion of the host the stranger could be nothing less than a\r\ngreat lord\xe2\x80\x94he insisted that notwithstanding his weakness D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nshould get up and depart as quickly as possible. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, half\r\nstupefied, without his doublet, and with his head bound up in a linen\r\ncloth, arose then, and urged by the host, began to descend the stairs;\r\nbut on arriving at the kitchen, the first thing he saw was his\r\nantagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage, drawn by two\r\nlarge Norman horses.\r\n\r\nHis interlocutor, whose head appeared through the carriage window, was\r\na woman of from twenty to two-and-twenty years. We have already\r\nobserved with what rapidity D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan seized the expression of a\r\ncountenance. He perceived then, at a glance, that this woman was young\r\nand beautiful; and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from\r\nits being totally different from that of the southern countries in\r\nwhich D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had hitherto resided. She was pale and fair, with long\r\ncurls falling in profusion over her shoulders, had large, blue,\r\nlanguishing eyes, rosy lips, and hands of alabaster. She was talking\r\nwith great animation with the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Eminence, then, orders me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo return instantly to England, and to inform him as soon as the duke\r\nleaves London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as to my other instructions?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the fair traveler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are contained in this box, which you will not open until you are\r\non the other side of the Channel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; and you\xe2\x80\x94what will you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I return to Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, without chastising this insolent boy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lady.\r\n\r\nThe stranger was about to reply; but at the moment he opened his mouth,\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who had heard all, precipitated himself over the threshold\r\nof the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis insolent boy chastises others,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he; \xe2\x80\x9cand I hope that this\r\ntime he whom he ought to chastise will not escape him as before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill not escape him?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the stranger, knitting his brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; before a woman you would dare not fly, I presume?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe least delay may ruin everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9cbegone then, on your part, and I\r\nwill depart as quickly on mine.\xe2\x80\x9d And bowing to the lady, he sprang into\r\nhis saddle, while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his\r\nhorses. The two interlocutors thus separated, taking opposite\r\ndirections, at full gallop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPay him, booby!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the stranger to his servant, without checking\r\nthe speed of his horse; and the man, after throwing two or three silver\r\npieces at the foot of mine host, galloped after his master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBase coward! false gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, springing forward, in\r\nhis turn, after the servant. But his wound had rendered him too weak to\r\nsupport such an exertion. Scarcely had he gone ten steps when his ears\r\nbegan to tingle, a faintness seized him, a cloud of blood passed over\r\nhis eyes, and he fell in the middle of the street, crying still,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCoward! coward! coward!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a coward, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled the host, drawing near to\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters\r\nwith the young man, as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had\r\ndespised the evening before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a base coward,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut she\xe2\x80\x94she was very\r\nbeautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _she?_\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMilady,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and fainted a second time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all one,\xe2\x80\x9d said the host; \xe2\x80\x9cI have lost two customers, but this\r\none remains, of whom I am pretty certain for some days to come. There\r\nwill be eleven crowns gained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that\r\nremained in D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s purse.\r\n\r\nThe host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day,\r\nbut he had reckoned without his guest. On the following morning at five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan arose, and descending to the kitchen without help,\r\nasked, among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to\r\nus, for some oil, some wine, and some rosemary, and with his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrecipe in his hand composed a balsam, with which he anointed his\r\nnumerous wounds, replacing his bandages himself, and positively\r\nrefusing the assistance of any doctor, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan walked about that\r\nsame evening, and was almost cured by the morrow.\r\n\r\nBut when the time came to pay for his rosemary, this oil, and the wine,\r\nthe only expense the master had incurred, as he had preserved a strict\r\nabstinence\xe2\x80\x94while on the contrary, the yellow horse, by the account of\r\nthe hostler at least, had eaten three times as much as a horse of his\r\nsize could reasonably be supposed to have done\xe2\x80\x94D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan found nothing\r\nin his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns it\r\ncontained; for as to the letter addressed to M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, it had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest\r\npatience, turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again,\r\nrummaging and rerummaging in his valise, and opening and reopening his\r\npurse; but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the\r\nletter was not to be found, he flew, for the third time, into such a\r\nrage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of wine, oil, and\r\nrosemary\xe2\x80\x94for upon seeing this hot-headed youth become exasperated and\r\nthreaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were\r\nnot found, the host seized a spit, his wife a broom handle, and the\r\nservants the same sticks they had used the day before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy letter of recommendation!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cmy letter of\r\nrecommendation! or, the holy blood, I will spit you all like ortolans!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there was one circumstance which created a powerful\r\nobstacle to the accomplishment of this threat; which was, as we have\r\nrelated, that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two,\r\nand which he had entirely forgotten. Hence, it resulted when D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nproceeded to draw his sword in earnest, he found himself purely and\r\nsimply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in\r\nlength, which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard. As to the\r\nrest of the blade, the master had slyly put that on one side to make\r\nhimself a larding pin.\r\n\r\nBut this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man\r\nif the host had not reflected that the reclamation which his guest made\r\nwas perfectly just.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, lowering the point of his spit, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere is\r\nthis letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, where is this letter?\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, I\r\nwarn you that that letter is for Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, and it must be\r\nfound, or if it is not found, he will know how to find it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis threat completed the intimidation of the host. After the king and\r\nthe cardinal, M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville was the man whose name was perhaps most\r\nfrequently repeated by the military, and even by citizens. There was,\r\nto be sure, Father Joseph, but his name was never pronounced but with a\r\nsubdued voice, such was the terror inspired by his Gray Eminence, as\r\nthe cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s familiar was called.\r\n\r\nThrowing down his spit, and ordering his wife to do the same with her\r\nbroom handle, and the servants with their sticks, he set the first\r\nexample of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes the letter contain anything valuable?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the host, after a\r\nfew minutes of useless investigation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZounds! I think it does indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Gascon, who reckoned upon\r\nthis letter for making his way at court. \xe2\x80\x9cIt contained my fortune!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBills upon Spain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the disturbed host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBills upon his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s private treasury,\xe2\x80\x9d answered D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who,\r\nreckoning upon entering into the king\xe2\x80\x99s service in consequence of this\r\nrecommendation, believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply\r\nwithout telling of a falsehood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the host, at his wits\xe2\x80\x99 end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s of no importance,\xe2\x80\x9d continued D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with natural\r\nassurance; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s of no importance. The money is nothing; that letter\r\nwas everything. I would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have\r\nlost it.\xe2\x80\x9d He would not have risked more if he had said twenty thousand;\r\nbut a certain juvenile modesty restrained him.\r\n\r\nA ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was\r\ngiving himself to the devil upon finding nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat letter is not lost!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it has been stolen from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStolen? By whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the gentleman who was here yesterday. He came down into the\r\nkitchen, where your doublet was. He remained there some time alone. I\r\nwould lay a wager he has stolen it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d answered D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, but little convinced, as he\r\nknew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this\r\nletter was, and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity. The fact\r\nwas that none of his servants, none of the travelers present, could\r\nhave gained anything by being possessed of this paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you say,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you suspect that impertinent\r\ngentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you I am sure of it,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the host. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I informed him\r\nthat your lordship was the _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9_ of Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, and that\r\nyou even had a letter for that illustrious gentleman, he appeared to be\r\nvery much disturbed, and asked me where that letter was, and\r\nimmediately came down into the kitchen, where he knew your doublet\r\nwas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen that\xe2\x80\x99s my thief,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cI will complain to\r\nMonsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, and Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville will complain to the\r\nking.\xe2\x80\x9d He then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave\r\nthem to the host, who accompanied him, cap in hand, to the gate, and\r\nremounted his yellow horse, which bore him without any further accident\r\nto the gate of St. Antoine at Paris, where his owner sold him for three\r\ncrowns, which was a very good price, considering that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had\r\nridden him hard during the last stage. Thus the dealer to whom\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan sold him for the nine livres did not conceal from the young\r\nman that he only gave that enormous sum for him on the account of the\r\noriginality of his color.\r\n\r\nThus D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan entered Paris on foot, carrying his little packet under\r\nhis arm, and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms\r\nsuited to the scantiness of his means. This chamber was a sort of\r\ngarret, situated in the Rue des Fossoyeurs, near the Luxembourg.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the earnest money was paid, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan took possession of\r\nhis lodging, and passed the remainder of the day in sewing onto his\r\ndoublet and hose some ornamental braiding which his mother had taken\r\noff an almost-new doublet of the elder M. d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and which she had\r\ngiven her son secretly. Next he went to the Quai de Feraille to have a\r\nnew blade put to his sword, and then returned toward the Louvre,\r\ninquiring of the first Musketeer he met for the situation of the h\xc3\xb4tel\r\nof M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, which proved to be in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier;\r\nthat is to say, in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x94a circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for\r\nthe success of his journey.\r\n\r\nAfter this, satisfied with the way in which he had conducted himself at\r\nMeung, without remorse for the past, confident in the present, and full\r\nof hope for the future, he retired to bed and slept the sleep of the\r\nbrave.\r\n\r\nThis sleep, provincial as it was, brought him to nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nmorning; at which hour he rose, in order to repair to the residence of\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, the third personage in the kingdom, in the paternal\r\nestimation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\nTHE ANTECHAMBER OF M. DE TR\xc3\x89VILLE\r\n\r\n\r\nM. de Troisville, as his family was still called in Gascony, or M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville, as he has ended by styling himself in Paris, had really\r\ncommenced life as D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan now did; that is to say, without a sou in\r\nhis pocket, but with a fund of audacity, shrewdness, and intelligence\r\nwhich makes the poorest Gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope\r\nfrom the paternal inheritance than the richest Perigordian or Berrichan\r\ngentleman derives in reality from his. His insolent bravery, his still\r\nmore insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail, had\r\nborne him to the top of that difficult ladder called Court Favor, which\r\nhe had climbed four steps at a time.\r\n\r\nHe was the friend of the king, who honored highly, as everyone knows,\r\nthe memory of his father, Henry IV. The father of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville had\r\nserved him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default\r\nof money\xe2\x80\x94a thing to which the B\xc3\xa9arnais was accustomed all his life, and\r\nwho constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need\r\nof borrowing, that is to say, with ready wit\xe2\x80\x94in default of money, we\r\nrepeat, he authorized him, after the reduction of Paris, to assume for\r\nhis arms a golden lion passant upon gules, with the motto _Fidelis et\r\nfortis_. This was a great matter in the way of honor, but very little\r\nin the way of wealth; so that when the illustrious companion of the\r\ngreat Henry died, the only inheritance he was able to leave his son was\r\nhis sword and his motto. Thanks to this double gift and the spotless\r\nname that accompanied it, M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville was admitted into the\r\nhousehold of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword,\r\nand was so faithful to his motto, that Louis XIII., one of the good\r\nblades of his kingdom, was accustomed to say that if he had a friend\r\nwho was about to fight, he would advise him to choose as a second,\r\nhimself first, and Tr\xc3\xa9ville next\xe2\x80\x94or even, perhaps, before himself.\r\n\r\nThus Louis XIII. had a real liking for Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x94a royal liking, a\r\nself-interested liking, it is true, but still a liking. At that unhappy\r\nperiod it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men\r\nas Tr\xc3\xa9ville. Many might take for their device the epithet _strong_,\r\nwhich formed the second part of his motto, but very few gentlemen could\r\nlay claim to the _faithful_, which constituted the first. Tr\xc3\xa9ville was\r\none of these latter. His was one of those rare organizations, endowed\r\nwith an obedient intelligence like that of the dog; with a blind valor,\r\na quick eye, and a prompt hand; to whom sight appeared only to be given\r\nto see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone, and the hand to\r\nstrike this displeasing personage, whether a Besme, a Maurevers, a\r\nPoltiot de M\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9, or a Vitry. In short, up to this period nothing had\r\nbeen wanting to Tr\xc3\xa9ville but opportunity; but he was ever on the watch\r\nfor it, and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to\r\nseize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand.\r\nAt last Louis XIII. made Tr\xc3\xa9ville the captain of his Musketeers, who\r\nwere to Louis XIII. in devotedness, or rather in fanaticism, what his\r\nOrdinaries had been to Henry III., and his Scotch Guard to Louis XI.\r\n\r\nOn his part, the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect. When\r\nhe saw the formidable and chosen body with which Louis XIII. had\r\nsurrounded himself, this second, or rather this first king of France,\r\nbecame desirous that he, too, should have his guard. He had his\r\nMusketeers therefore, as Louis XIII. had his, and these two powerful\r\nrivals vied with each other in procuring, not only from all the\r\nprovinces of France, but even from all foreign states, the most\r\ncelebrated swordsmen. It was not uncommon for Richelieu and Louis XIII.\r\nto dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their\r\nservants. Each boasted the bearing and the courage of his own people.\r\nWhile exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls, they excited them\r\nsecretly to quarrel, deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine\r\nregret from the success or defeat of their own combatants. We learn\r\nthis from the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these\r\ndefeats and in many of these victories.\r\n\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville had grasped the weak side of his master; and it was to this\r\naddress that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not\r\nleft the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his\r\nfriendships. He paraded his Musketeers before the Cardinal Armand\r\nDuplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his\r\nEminence curl with ire. Tr\xc3\xa9ville understood admirably the war method of\r\nthat period, in which he who could not live at the expense of the enemy\r\nmust live at the expense of his compatriots. His soldiers formed a\r\nlegion of devil-may-care fellows, perfectly undisciplined toward all\r\nbut himself.\r\n\r\nLoose, half-drunk, imposing, the king\xe2\x80\x99s Musketeers, or rather M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s, spread themselves about in the cabarets, in the public\r\nwalks, and the public sports, shouting, twisting their mustaches,\r\nclanking their swords, and taking great pleasure in annoying the Guards\r\nof the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them; then drawing in\r\nthe open streets, as if it were the best of all possible sports;\r\nsometimes killed, but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged;\r\noften killing others, but then certain of not rotting in prison, M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville being there to claim them. Thus M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville was praised to\r\nthe highest note by these men, who adored him, and who, ruffians as\r\nthey were, trembled before him like scholars before their master,\r\nobedient to his least word, and ready to sacrifice themselves to wash\r\nout the smallest insult.\r\n\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville employed this powerful weapon for the king, in the first\r\nplace, and the friends of the king\xe2\x80\x94and then for himself and his own\r\nfriends. For the rest, in the memoirs of this period, which has left so\r\nmany memoirs, one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by\r\nhis enemies; and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among\r\nmen of the sword. In no instance, let us say, was this worthy gentleman\r\naccused of deriving personal advantage from the cooperation of his\r\nminions. Endowed with a rare genius for intrigue which rendered him the\r\nequal of the ablest intriguers, he remained an honest man. Still\r\nfurther, in spite of sword thrusts which weaken, and painful exercises\r\nwhich fatigue, he had become one of the most gallant frequenters of\r\nrevels, one of the most insinuating lady\xe2\x80\x99s men, one of the softest\r\nwhisperers of interesting nothings of his day; the _bonnes fortunes_ of\r\nde Tr\xc3\xa9ville were talked of as those of M. de Bassompierre had been\r\ntalked of twenty years before, and that was not saying a little. The\r\ncaptain of the Musketeers was therefore admired, feared, and loved; and\r\nthis constitutes the zenith of human fortune.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. absorbed all the smaller stars of his court in his own vast\r\nradiance; but his father, a sun _pluribus impar_, left his personal\r\nsplendor to each of his favorites, his individual value to each of his\r\ncourtiers. In addition to the leeves of the king and the cardinal,\r\nthere might be reckoned in Paris at that time more than two hundred\r\nsmaller but still noteworthy leeves. Among these two hundred leeves,\r\nthat of Tr\xc3\xa9ville was one of the most sought.\r\n\r\nThe court of his h\xc3\xb4tel, situated in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier,\r\nresembled a camp from by six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning in summer and eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in winter. From fifty to sixty Musketeers, who appeared to\r\nreplace one another in order always to present an imposing number,\r\nparaded constantly, armed to the teeth and ready for anything. On one\r\nof those immense staircases, upon whose space modern civilization would\r\nbuild a whole house, ascended and descended the office seekers of\r\nParis, who ran after any sort of favor\xe2\x80\x94gentlemen from the provinces\r\nanxious to be enrolled, and servants in all sorts of liveries, bringing\r\nand carrying messages between their masters and M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville. In the\r\nantechamber, upon long circular benches, reposed the elect; that is to\r\nsay, those who were called. In this apartment a continued buzzing\r\nprevailed from morning till night, while M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, in his office\r\ncontiguous to this antechamber, received visits, listened to\r\ncomplaints, gave his orders, and like the king in his balcony at the\r\nLouvre, had only to place himself at the window to review both his men\r\nand arms.\r\n\r\nThe day on which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan presented himself the assemblage was\r\nimposing, particularly for a provincial just arriving from his\r\nprovince. It is true that this provincial was a Gascon; and that,\r\nparticularly at this period, the compatriots of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had the\r\nreputation of not being easily intimidated. When he had once passed the\r\nmassive door covered with long square-headed nails, he fell into the\r\nmidst of a troop of swordsmen, who crossed one another in their\r\npassage, calling out, quarreling, and playing tricks one with another.\r\nIn order to make one\xe2\x80\x99s way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves,\r\nit was necessary to be an officer, a great noble, or a pretty woman.\r\n\r\nIt was, then, into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young\r\nman advanced with a beating heart, ranging his long rapier up his lanky\r\nleg, and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap, with that half-smile\r\nof the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face. When he\r\nhad passed one group he began to breathe more freely; but he could not\r\nhelp observing that they turned round to look at him, and for the first\r\ntime in his life D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who had till that day entertained a very\r\ngood opinion of himself, felt ridiculous.\r\n\r\nArrived at the staircase, it was still worse. There were four\r\nMusketeers on the bottom steps, amusing themselves with the following\r\nexercise, while ten or twelve of their comrades waited upon the landing\r\nplace to take their turn in the sport.\r\n\r\nOne of them, stationed upon the top stair, naked sword in hand,\r\nprevented, or at least endeavored to prevent, the three others from\r\nascending.\r\n\r\nThese three others fenced against him with their agile swords.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan at first took these weapons for foils, and believed them to\r\nbe buttoned; but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every\r\nweapon was pointed and sharpened, and that at each of these scratches\r\nnot only the spectators, but even the actors themselves, laughed like\r\nso many madmen.\r\n\r\nHe who at the moment occupied the upper step kept his adversaries\r\nmarvelously in check. A circle was formed around them. The conditions\r\nrequired that at every hit the man touched should quit the game,\r\nyielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit him. In\r\nfive minutes three were slightly wounded, one on the hand, another on\r\nthe ear, by the defender of the stair, who himself remained intact\xe2\x80\x94a\r\npiece of skill which was worth to him, according to the rules agreed\r\nupon, three turns of favor.\r\n\r\nHowever difficult it might be, or rather as he pretended it was, to\r\nastonish our young traveler, this pastime really astonished him. He had\r\nseen in his province\xe2\x80\x94that land in which heads become so easily heated\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nfew of the preliminaries of duels; but the daring of these four fencers\r\nappeared to him the strongest he had ever heard of even in Gascony. He\r\nbelieved himself transported into that famous country of giants into\r\nwhich Gulliver afterward went and was so frightened; and yet he had not\r\ngained the goal, for there were still the landing place and the\r\nantechamber.\r\n\r\nOn the landing they were no longer fighting, but amused themselves with\r\nstories about women, and in the antechamber, with stories about the\r\ncourt. On the landing D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan blushed; in the antechamber he\r\ntrembled. His warm and fickle imagination, which in Gascony had\r\nrendered him formidable to young chambermaids, and even sometimes their\r\nmistresses, had never dreamed, even in moments of delirium, of half the\r\namorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here\r\nset forth in connection with names the best known and with details the\r\nleast concealed. But if his morals were shocked on the landing, his\r\nrespect for the cardinal was scandalized in the antechamber. There, to\r\nhis great astonishment, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan heard the policy which made all\r\nEurope tremble criticized aloud and openly, as well as the private life\r\nof the cardinal, which so many great nobles had been punished for\r\ntrying to pry into. That great man who was so revered by D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan the\r\nelder served as an object of ridicule to the Musketeers of Tr\xc3\xa9ville,\r\nwho cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked back. Some\r\nsang ballads about Mme. d\xe2\x80\x99Aguillon, his mistress, and Mme. Cambalet,\r\nhis niece; while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and\r\nguards of the cardinal duke\xe2\x80\x94all things which appeared to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nmonstrous impossibilities.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when the name of the king was now and then uttered\r\nunthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests, a sort of gag seemed to\r\nclose for a moment on all these jeering mouths. They looked\r\nhesitatingly around them, and appeared to doubt the thickness of the\r\npartition between them and the office of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville; but a fresh\r\nallusion soon brought back the conversation to his Eminence, and then\r\nthe laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from\r\nany of his actions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertes, these fellows will all either be imprisoned or hanged,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthought the terrified D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cand I, no doubt, with them; for from\r\nthe moment I have either listened to or heard them, I shall be held as\r\nan accomplice. What would my good father say, who so strongly pointed\r\nout to me the respect due to the cardinal, if he knew I was in the\r\nsociety of such pagans?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe have no need, therefore, to say that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan dared not join in\r\nthe conversation, only he looked with all his eyes and listened with\r\nall his ears, stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing; and\r\ndespite his confidence on the paternal admonitions, he felt himself\r\ncarried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to\r\nblame the unheard-of things which were taking place.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was a perfect stranger in the court of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourtiers, and this his first appearance in that place, he was at\r\nlength noticed, and somebody came and asked him what he wanted. At this\r\ndemand D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan gave his name very modestly, emphasized the title of\r\ncompatriot, and begged the servant who had put the question to him to\r\nrequest a moment\xe2\x80\x99s audience of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x94a request which the\r\nother, with an air of protection, promised to transmit in due season.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, a little recovered from his first surprise, had now leisure\r\nto study costumes and physiognomy.\r\n\r\nThe center of the most animated group was a Musketeer of great height\r\nand haughty countenance, dressed in a costume so peculiar as to attract\r\ngeneral attention. He did not wear the uniform cloak\xe2\x80\x94which was not\r\nobligatory at that epoch of less liberty but more independence\xe2\x80\x94but a\r\ncerulean-blue doublet, a little faded and worn, and over this a\r\nmagnificent baldric, worked in gold, which shone like water ripples in\r\nthe sun. A long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful folds from his\r\nshoulders, disclosing in front the splendid baldric, from which was\r\nsuspended a gigantic rapier. This Musketeer had just come off guard,\r\ncomplained of having a cold, and coughed from time to time affectedly.\r\nIt was for this reason, as he said to those around him, that he had put\r\non his cloak; and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his\r\nmustache disdainfully, all admired his embroidered baldric, and\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan more than anyone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you have?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Musketeer. \xe2\x80\x9cThis fashion is coming in.\r\nIt is a folly, I admit, but still it is the fashion. Besides, one must\r\nlay out one\xe2\x80\x99s inheritance somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Porthos!\xe2\x80\x9d cried one of his companions, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t try to make us\r\nbelieve you obtained that baldric by paternal generosity. It was given\r\nto you by that veiled lady I met you with the other Sunday, near the\r\ngate St. Honor\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman, I bought it with the\r\ncontents of my own purse,\xe2\x80\x9d answered he whom they designated by the name\r\nPorthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; about in the same manner,\xe2\x80\x9d said another Musketeer, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I bought\r\nthis new purse with what my mistress put into the old one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cand the proof is that I paid twelve\r\npistoles for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wonder was increased, though the doubt continued to exist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not true, Aramis?\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, turning toward another\r\nMusketeer.\r\n\r\nThis other Musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator, who\r\nhad just designated him by the name of Aramis. He was a stout man, of\r\nabout two- or three-and-twenty, with an open, ingenuous countenance, a\r\nblack, mild eye, and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach. His\r\ndelicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip;\r\nhe appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell,\r\nand he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their\r\ndelicate pink transparency. Habitually he spoke little and slowly,\r\nbowed frequently, laughed without noise, showing his teeth, which were\r\nfine and of which, as the rest of his person, he appeared to take great\r\ncare. He answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThis affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the\r\nbaldric. They continued to admire it, but said no more about it; and\r\nwith a rapid change of thought, the conversation passed suddenly to\r\nanother subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of the story Chalais\xe2\x80\x99s esquire relates?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nanother Musketeer, without addressing anyone in particular, but on the\r\ncontrary speaking to everybody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does he say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Porthos, in a self-sufficient tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe relates that he met at Brussels Rochefort, the _\xc3\xa2me damn\xc3\xa9e_ of the\r\ncardinal disguised as a Capuchin, and that this cursed Rochefort,\r\nthanks to his disguise, had tricked Monsieur de Laigues, like a ninny\r\nas he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA ninny, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cbut is the matter certain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had it from Aramis,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Musketeer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you knew it, Porthos,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you of it yesterday.\r\nLet us say no more about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay no more about it? That\xe2\x80\x99s _your_ opinion!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay no more about it! _Peste!_ You come to your conclusions quickly.\r\nWhat! The cardinal sets a spy upon a gentleman, has his letters stolen\r\nfrom him by means of a traitor, a brigand, a rascal\xe2\x80\x94has, with the help\r\nof this spy and thanks to this correspondence, Chalais\xe2\x80\x99s throat cut,\r\nunder the stupid pretext that he wanted to kill the king and marry\r\nMonsieur to the queen! Nobody knew a word of this enigma. You unraveled\r\nit yesterday to the great satisfaction of all; and while we are still\r\ngaping with wonder at the news, you come and tell us today, \xe2\x80\x98Let us say\r\nno more about it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, let us talk about it, since you desire it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nAramis, patiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis Rochefort,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cif I were the esquire of poor\r\nChalais, should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x94you would pass rather a sad quarter-hour with the Red Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the Red Duke! Bravo! Bravo! The Red Duke!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos, clapping\r\nhis hands and nodding his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Red Duke is capital. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncirculate that saying, be assured, my dear fellow. Who says this Aramis\r\nis not a wit? What a misfortune it is you did not follow your first\r\nvocation; what a delicious abb\xc3\xa9 you would have made!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s only a temporary postponement,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be\r\none someday. You very well know, Porthos, that I continue to study\r\ntheology for that purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will be one, as he says,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9che will be one, sooner or\r\nlater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSooner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock,\r\nwhich hangs behind his uniform,\xe2\x80\x9d said another Musketeer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he waiting for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly till the queen has given an heir to the crown of France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo jesting upon that subject, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cthank God the\r\nqueen is still of an age to give one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say that Monsieur de Buckingham is in France,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis,\r\nwith a significant smile which gave to this sentence, apparently so\r\nsimple, a tolerably scandalous meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAramis, my good friend, this time you are wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Porthos.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour wit is always leading you beyond bounds; if Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\r\nheard you, you would repent of speaking thus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to give me a lesson, Porthos?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Aramis, from whose\r\nusually mild eye a flash passed like lightning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, be a Musketeer or an abb\xc3\xa9. Be one or the other, but\r\nnot both,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what Athos told you the other\r\nday; you eat at everybody\xe2\x80\x99s mess. Ah, don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry, I beg of you,\r\nthat would be useless; you know what is agreed upon between you, Athos\r\nand me. You go to Madame d\xe2\x80\x99Aguillon\xe2\x80\x99s, and you pay your court to her;\r\nyou go to Madame de Bois-Tracy\xe2\x80\x99s, the cousin of Madame de Chevreuse,\r\nand you pass for being far advanced in the good graces of that lady.\r\nOh, good Lord! Don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself to reveal your good luck; no one\r\nasks for your secret\xe2\x80\x94all the world knows your discretion. But since you\r\npossess that virtue, why the devil don\xe2\x80\x99t you make use of it with\r\nrespect to her Majesty? Let whoever likes talk of the king and the\r\ncardinal, and how he likes; but the queen is sacred, and if anyone\r\nspeaks of her, let it be respectfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPorthos, you are as vain as Narcissus; I plainly tell you so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nAramis. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I hate moralizing, except when it is done by Athos.\r\nAs to you, good sir, you wear too magnificent a baldric to be strong on\r\nthat head. I will be an abb\xc3\xa9 if it suits me. In the meanwhile I am a\r\nMusketeer; in that quality I say what I please, and at this moment it\r\npleases me to say that you weary me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAramis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPorthos!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen! Gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the surrounding group.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville awaits Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d cried a servant,\r\nthrowing open the door of the cabinet.\r\n\r\nAt this announcement, during which the door remained open, everyone\r\nbecame mute, and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of\r\nthe length of the antechamber, and entered the apartment of the captain\r\nof the Musketeers, congratulating himself with all his heart at having\r\nso narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\nTHE AUDIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville was at the moment in rather ill-humor, nevertheless he\r\nsaluted the young man politely, who bowed to the very ground; and he\r\nsmiled on receiving D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s response, the B\xc3\xa9arnese accent of which\r\nrecalled to him at the same time his youth and his country\xe2\x80\x94a double\r\nremembrance which makes a man smile at all ages; but stepping toward\r\nthe antechamber and making a sign to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan with his hand, as if to\r\nask his permission to finish with others before he began with him, he\r\ncalled three times, with a louder voice at each time, so that he ran\r\nthrough the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the\r\nangry accent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAthos! Porthos! Aramis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two Musketeers with whom we have already made acquaintance, and who\r\nanswered to the last of these three names, immediately quitted the\r\ngroup of which they had formed a part, and advanced toward the cabinet,\r\nthe door of which closed after them as soon as they had entered. Their\r\nappearance, although it was not quite at ease, excited by its\r\ncarelessness, at once full of dignity and submission, the admiration of\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who beheld in these two men demigods, and in their leader\r\nan Olympian Jupiter, armed with all his thunders.\r\n\r\nWhen the two Musketeers had entered; when the door was closed behind\r\nthem; when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber, to which the summons\r\nwhich had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food, had\r\nrecommenced; when M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville had three or four times paced in\r\nsilence, and with a frowning brow, the whole length of his cabinet,\r\npassing each time before Porthos and Aramis, who were as upright and\r\nsilent as if on parade\xe2\x80\x94he stopped all at once full in front of them,\r\nand covering them from head to foot with an angry look, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know\r\nwhat the king said to me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9cand that no longer ago than\r\nyesterday evening\xe2\x80\x94do you know, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the two Musketeers, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence, \xe2\x80\x9cno, sir,\r\nwe do not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I hope that you will do us the honor to tell us,\xe2\x80\x9d added Aramis, in\r\nhis politest tone and with his most graceful bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me that he should henceforth recruit his Musketeers from among\r\nthe Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Guards of the cardinal! And why so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Porthos, warmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he plainly perceives that his piquette* stands in need of\r\nbeing enlivened by a mixture of good wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* A watered liquor, made from the second pressing of the grape.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two Musketeers reddened to the whites of their eyes. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan did\r\nnot know where he was, and wished himself a hundred feet underground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d continued M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, growing warmer as he spoke, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nhis majesty was right; for, upon my honor, it is true that the\r\nMusketeers make but a miserable figure at court. The cardinal related\r\nyesterday while playing with the king, with an air of condolence very\r\ndispleasing to me, that the day before yesterday those _damned\r\nMusketeers_, those _daredevils_\xe2\x80\x94he dwelt upon those words with an\r\nironical tone still more displeasing to me\xe2\x80\x94those _braggarts_, added he,\r\nglancing at me with his tiger-cat\xe2\x80\x99s eye, had made a riot in the Rue\r\nF\xc3\xa9rou in a cabaret, and that a party of his Guards (I thought he was\r\ngoing to laugh in my face) had been forced to arrest the rioters!\r\n_Morbleu!_ You must know something about it. Arrest Musketeers! You\r\nwere among them\xe2\x80\x94you were! Don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it; you were recognized, and the\r\ncardinal named you. But it\xe2\x80\x99s all my fault; yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s all my fault,\r\nbecause it is myself who selects my men. You, Aramis, why the devil did\r\nyou ask me for a uniform when you would have been so much better in a\r\ncassock? And you, Porthos, do you only wear such a fine golden baldric\r\nto suspend a sword of straw from it? And Athos\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t see Athos. Where\r\nis he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIll\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery ill, say you? And of what malady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is feared that it may be the smallpox, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Porthos,\r\ndesirous of taking his turn in the conversation; \xe2\x80\x9cand what is serious\r\nis that it will certainly spoil his face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe smallpox! That\xe2\x80\x99s a great story to tell me, Porthos! Sick of the\r\nsmallpox at his age! No, no; but wounded without doubt, killed,\r\nperhaps. Ah, if I knew! S\xe2\x80\x99blood! Messieurs Musketeers, I will not have\r\nthis haunting of bad places, this quarreling in the streets, this\r\nswordplay at the crossways; and above all, I will not have occasion\r\ngiven for the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s Guards, who are brave, quiet, skillful men who\r\nnever put themselves in a position to be arrested, and who, besides,\r\nnever allow themselves to be arrested, to laugh at you! I am sure of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94they would prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back\r\na step. To save yourselves, to scamper away, to flee\xe2\x80\x94that is good for\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s Musketeers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos and Aramis trembled with rage. They could willingly have\r\nstrangled M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, if, at the bottom of all this, they had not\r\nfelt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak thus. They\r\nstamped upon the carpet with their feet; they bit their lips till the\r\nblood came, and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their might.\r\nAll without had heard, as we have said, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis\r\ncalled, and had guessed, from M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s tone of voice, that he\r\nwas very angry about something. Ten curious heads were glued to the\r\ntapestry and became pale with fury; for their ears, closely applied to\r\nthe door, did not lose a syllable of what he said, while their mouths\r\nrepeated as he went on, the insulting expressions of the captain to all\r\nthe people in the antechamber. In an instant, from the door of the\r\ncabinet to the street gate, the whole h\xc3\xb4tel was boiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! The king\xe2\x80\x99s Musketeers are arrested by the Guards of the cardinal,\r\nare they?\xe2\x80\x9d continued M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, as furious at heart as his\r\nsoldiers, but emphasizing his words and plunging them, one by one, so\r\nto say, like so many blows of a stiletto, into the bosoms of his\r\nauditors. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Six of his Eminence\xe2\x80\x99s Guards arrest six of his\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s Musketeers! _Morbleu!_ My part is taken! I will go straight\r\nto the Louvre; I will give in my resignation as captain of the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMusketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s Guards, and if he\r\nrefuses me, _morbleu!_ I will turn abb\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words, the murmur without became an explosion; nothing was to\r\nbe heard but oaths and blasphemies. The _morbleus_, the _sang Dieus_,\r\nthe _morts touts les diables_, crossed one another in the air.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself,\r\nand felt an immense inclination to crawl under the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, quite beside himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthe truth is\r\nthat we were six against six. But we were not captured by fair means;\r\nand before we had time to draw our swords, two of our party were dead,\r\nand Athos, grievously wounded, was very little better. For you know\r\nAthos. Well, Captain, he endeavored twice to get up, and fell again\r\ntwice. And we did not surrender\xe2\x80\x94no! They dragged us away by force. On\r\nthe way we escaped. As for Athos, they believed him to be dead, and\r\nleft him very quiet on the field of battle, not thinking it worth the\r\ntrouble to carry him away. That\xe2\x80\x99s the whole story. What the devil,\r\nCaptain, one cannot win all one\xe2\x80\x99s battles! The great Pompey lost that\r\nof Pharsalia; and Francis the First, who was, as I have heard say, as\r\ngood as other folks, nevertheless lost the Battle of Pavia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have the honor of assuring you that I killed one of them with\r\nhis own sword,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis; \xe2\x80\x9cfor mine was broken at the first parry.\r\nKilled him, or poniarded him, sir, as is most agreeable to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not know that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, in a somewhat softened\r\ntone. \xe2\x80\x9cThe cardinal exaggerated, as I perceive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut pray, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Aramis, who, seeing his captain become\r\nappeased, ventured to risk a prayer, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not say that Athos is wounded.\r\nHe would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king; and\r\nas the wound is very serious, seeing that after crossing the shoulder\r\nit penetrates into the chest, it is to be feared\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head,\r\nbut frightfully pale, appeared under the fringe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAthos!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the two Musketeers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAthos!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have sent for me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos to M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, in a feeble\r\nyet perfectly calm voice, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have sent for me, as my comrades inform\r\nme, and I have hastened to receive your orders. I am here; what do you\r\nwant with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd at these words, the Musketeer, in irreproachable costume, belted as\r\nusual, with a tolerably firm step, entered the cabinet. M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville,\r\nmoved to the bottom of his heart by this proof of courage, sprang\r\ntoward him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was about to say to these gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I forbid my\r\nMusketeers to expose their lives needlessly; for brave men are very\r\ndear to the king, and the king knows that his Musketeers are the\r\nbravest on the earth. Your hand, Athos!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd without waiting for the answer of the newcomer to this proof of\r\naffection, M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville seized his right hand and pressed it with all\r\nhis might, without perceiving that Athos, whatever might be his\r\nself-command, allowed a slight murmur of pain to escape him, and if\r\npossible, grew paler than he was before.\r\n\r\nThe door had remained open, so strong was the excitement produced by\r\nthe arrival of Athos, whose wound, though kept as a secret, was known\r\nto all. A burst of satisfaction hailed the last words of the captain;\r\nand two or three heads, carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment,\r\nappeared through the openings of the tapestry. M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville was about\r\nto reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette, when he felt the\r\nhand of Athos, who had rallied all his energies to contend against\r\npain, at length overcome by it, fell upon the floor as if he were dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA surgeon!\xe2\x80\x9d cried M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cmine! The king\xe2\x80\x99s! The best! A\r\nsurgeon! Or, s\xe2\x80\x99blood, my brave Athos will die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the cries of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, the whole assemblage rushed into the\r\ncabinet, he not thinking to shut the door against anyone, and all\r\ncrowded round the wounded man. But all this eager attention might have\r\nbeen useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be\r\nin the h\xc3\xb4tel. He pushed through the crowd, approached Athos, still\r\ninsensible, and as all this noise and commotion inconvenienced him\r\ngreatly, he required, as the first and most urgent thing, that the\r\nMusketeer should be carried into an adjoining chamber. Immediately M.\r\nde Tr\xc3\xa9ville opened and pointed the way to Porthos and Aramis, who bore\r\ntheir comrade in their arms. Behind this group walked the surgeon; and\r\nbehind the surgeon the door closed.\r\n\r\nThe cabinet of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, generally held so sacred, became in an\r\ninstant the annex of the antechamber. Everyone spoke, harangued, and\r\nvociferated, swearing, cursing, and consigning the cardinal and his\r\nGuards to all the devils.\r\n\r\nAn instant after, Porthos and Aramis re-entered, the surgeon and M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville alone remaining with the wounded.\r\n\r\nAt length, M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville himself returned. The injured man had\r\nrecovered his senses. The surgeon declared that the situation of the\r\nMusketeer had nothing in it to render his friends uneasy, his weakness\r\nhaving been purely and simply caused by loss of blood.\r\n\r\nThen M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville made a sign with his hand, and all retired except\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who did not forget that he had an audience, and with the\r\ntenacity of a Gascon remained in his place.\r\n\r\nWhen all had gone out and the door was closed, M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, on\r\nturning round, found himself alone with the young man. The event which\r\nhad occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his ideas. He\r\ninquired what was the will of his persevering visitor. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan then\r\nrepeated his name, and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of\r\nthe present and the past, M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville grasped the situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cpardon me my dear compatriot, but I had\r\nwholly forgotten you. But what help is there for it! A captain is\r\nnothing but a father of a family, charged with even a greater\r\nresponsibility than the father of an ordinary family. Soldiers are big\r\nchildren; but as I maintain that the orders of the king, and more\r\nparticularly the orders of the cardinal, should be executed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan could not restrain a smile. By this smile M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\r\njudged that he had not to deal with a fool, and changing the\r\nconversation, came straight to the point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI respected your father very much,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do for the\r\nson? Tell me quickly; my time is not my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9con quitting Tarbes and coming hither, it\r\nwas my intention to request of you, in remembrance of the friendship\r\nwhich you have not forgotten, the uniform of a Musketeer; but after all\r\nthat I have seen during the last two hours, I comprehend that such a\r\nfavor is enormous, and tremble lest I should not merit it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed a favor, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d replied M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it may\r\nnot be so far beyond your hopes as you believe, or rather as you appear\r\nto believe. But his majesty\xe2\x80\x99s decision is always necessary; and I\r\ninform you with regret that no one becomes a Musketeer without the\r\npreliminary ordeal of several campaigns, certain brilliant actions, or\r\na service of two years in some other regiment less favored than ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan bowed without replying, feeling his desire to don the\r\nMusketeer\xe2\x80\x99s uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which\r\npreceded the attainment of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d continued M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, fixing upon his compatriot a look so\r\npiercing that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his\r\nheart, \xe2\x80\x9con account of my old companion, your father, as I have said, I\r\nwill do something for you, young man. Our recruits from B\xc3\xa9arn are not\r\ngenerally very rich, and I have no reason to think matters have much\r\nchanged in this respect since I left the province. I dare say you have\r\nnot brought too large a stock of money with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said, \xe2\x80\x9cI ask\r\nalms of no man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s very well, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d continued M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall very well. I know these airs; I myself came to Paris with four\r\ncrowns in my purse, and would have fought with anyone who dared to tell\r\nme I was not in a condition to purchase the Louvre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s bearing became still more imposing. Thanks to the sale of\r\nhis horse, he commenced his career with four more crowns than M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville possessed at the commencement of his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought, I say, then, to husband the means you have, however large\r\nthe sum may be; but you ought also to endeavor to perfect yourself in\r\nthe exercises becoming a gentleman. I will write a letter today to the\r\nDirector of the Royal Academy, and tomorrow he will admit you without\r\nany expense to yourself. Do not refuse this little service. Our\r\nbest-born and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it without being able\r\nto obtain it. You will learn horsemanship, swordsmanship in all its\r\nbranches, and dancing. You will make some desirable acquaintances; and\r\nfrom time to time you can call upon me, just to tell me how you are\r\ngetting on, and to say whether I can be of further service to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, stranger as he was to all the manners of a court, could not\r\nbut perceive a little coldness in this reception.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot but perceive how sadly I miss the\r\nletter of introduction which my father gave me to present to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly am surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d replied M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you should\r\nundertake so long a journey without that necessary passport, the sole\r\nresource of us poor B\xc3\xa9arnese.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had one, sir, and, thank God, such as I could wish,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it was perfidiously stolen from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then related the adventure of Meung, described the unknown gentleman\r\nwith the greatest minuteness, and all with a warmth and truthfulness\r\nthat delighted M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all very strange,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, after meditating a\r\nminute; \xe2\x80\x9cyou mentioned my name, then, aloud?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, I certainly committed that imprudence; but why should I have\r\ndone otherwise? A name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way.\r\nJudge if I should not put myself under its protection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFlattery was at that period very current, and M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville loved\r\nincense as well as a king, or even a cardinal. He could not refrain\r\nfrom a smile of visible satisfaction; but this smile soon disappeared,\r\nand returning to the adventure of Meung, \xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9chad\r\nnot this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, such a one as would be made by the grazing of a ball.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he not a fine-looking man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf lofty stature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf pale complexion and brown hair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, that is he; how is it, sir, that you are acquainted with\r\nthis man? If I ever find him again\xe2\x80\x94and I will find him, I swear, were\r\nit in hell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was waiting for a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her\r\nwhom he awaited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know not the subject of their conversation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gave her a box, told her not to open it except in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas this woman English?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe called her Milady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is he; it must be he!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Tr\xc3\xa9ville. \xe2\x80\x9cI believed him still at\r\nBrussels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sir, if you know who this man is,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me who\r\nhe is, and whence he is. I will then release you from all your\r\npromises\xe2\x80\x94even that of procuring my admission into the Musketeers; for\r\nbefore everything, I wish to avenge myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeware, young man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tr\xc3\xa9ville. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you see him coming on one side\r\nof the street, pass by on the other. Do not cast yourself against such\r\na rock; he would break you like glass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will not prevent me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cif ever I find him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cseek him not\xe2\x80\x94if I have a right to\r\nadvise you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll at once the captain stopped, as if struck by a sudden suspicion.\r\nThis great hatred which the young traveler manifested so loudly for\r\nthis man, who\xe2\x80\x94a rather improbable thing\xe2\x80\x94had stolen his father\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\nfrom him\xe2\x80\x94was there not some perfidy concealed under this hatred? Might\r\nnot this young man be sent by his Eminence? Might he not have come for\r\nthe purpose of laying a snare for him? This pretended D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x94was he\r\nnot an emissary of the cardinal, whom the cardinal sought to introduce\r\ninto Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s house, to place near him, to win his confidence, and\r\nafterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances?\r\nHe fixed his eyes upon D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan even more earnestly than before. He\r\nwas moderately reassured, however, by the aspect of that countenance,\r\nfull of astute intelligence and affected humility. \xe2\x80\x9cI know he is a\r\nGascon,\xe2\x80\x9d reflected he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he may be one for the cardinal as well as\r\nfor me. Let us try him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, slowly, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish, as the son of an ancient\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x94for I consider this story of the lost letter perfectly true\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwish, I say, in order to repair the coldness you may have remarked in\r\nmy reception of you, to discover to you the secrets of our policy. The\r\nking and the cardinal are the best of friends; their apparent\r\nbickerings are only feints to deceive fools. I am not willing that a\r\ncompatriot, a handsome cavalier, a brave youth, quite fit to make his\r\nway, should become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the\r\nsnare after the example of so many others who have been ruined by it.\r\nBe assured that I am devoted to both these all-powerful masters, and\r\nthat my earnest endeavors have no other aim than the service of the\r\nking, and also the cardinal\xe2\x80\x94one of the most illustrious geniuses that\r\nFrance has ever produced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, young man, regulate your conduct accordingly; and if you\r\nentertain, whether from your family, your relations, or even from your\r\ninstincts, any of these enmities which we see constantly breaking out\r\nagainst the cardinal, bid me adieu and let us separate. I will aid you\r\nin many ways, but without attaching you to my person. I hope that my\r\nfrankness at least will make you my friend; for you are the only young\r\nman to whom I have hitherto spoken as I have done to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the cardinal has set this young fox upon\r\nme, he will certainly not have failed\xe2\x80\x94he, who knows how bitterly I\r\nexecrate him\xe2\x80\x94to tell his spy that the best means of making his court to\r\nme is to rail at him. Therefore, in spite of all my protestations, if\r\nit be as I suspect, my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his\r\nEminence in horror.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt, however, proved otherwise. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan answered, with the greatest\r\nsimplicity: \xe2\x80\x9cI came to Paris with exactly such intentions. My father\r\nadvised me to stoop to nobody but the king, the cardinal, and\r\nyourself\xe2\x80\x94whom he considered the first three personages in France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan added M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville to the others, as may be perceived; but\r\nhe thought this addition would do no harm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the greatest veneration for the cardinal,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthe most profound respect for his actions. So much the better for me,\r\nsir, if you speak to me, as you say, with frankness\xe2\x80\x94for then you will\r\ndo me the honor to esteem the resemblance of our opinions; but if you\r\nhave entertained any doubt, as naturally you may, I feel that I am\r\nruining myself by speaking the truth. But I still trust you will not\r\nesteem me the less for it, and that is my object beyond all others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville was surprised to the greatest degree. So much\r\npenetration, so much frankness, created admiration, but did not\r\nentirely remove his suspicions. The more this young man was superior to\r\nothers, the more he was to be dreaded if he meant to deceive him.\r\nNevertheless, he pressed D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nan honest youth; but at the present moment I can only do for you that\r\nwhich I just now offered. My h\xc3\xb4tel will be always open to you.\r\nHereafter, being able to ask for me at all hours, and consequently to\r\ntake advantage of all opportunities, you will probably obtain that\r\nwhich you desire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you will wait until I have\r\nproved myself worthy of it. Well, be assured,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, with the\r\nfamiliarity of a Gascon, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall not wait long.\xe2\x80\x9d And he bowed in\r\norder to retire, and as if he considered the future in his own hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut wait a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, stopping him. \xe2\x80\x9cI promised you\r\na letter for the director of the Academy. Are you too proud to accept\r\nit, young gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cand I will guard it so carefully that I\r\nwill be sworn it shall arrive at its address, and woe be to him who\r\nshall attempt to take it from me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville smiled at this flourish; and leaving his young man\r\ncompatriot in the embrasure of the window, where they had talked\r\ntogether, he seated himself at a table in order to write the promised\r\nletter of recommendation. While he was doing this, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, having\r\nno better employment, amused himself with beating a march upon the\r\nwindow and with looking at the Musketeers, who went away, one after\r\nanother, following them with his eyes until they disappeared.\r\n\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, after having written the letter, sealed it, and rising,\r\napproached the young man in order to give it to him. But at the very\r\nmoment when D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan stretched out his hand to receive it, M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville was highly astonished to see his _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9_ make a sudden\r\nspring, become crimson with passion, and rush from the cabinet crying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x99blood, he shall not escape me this time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who?\xe2\x80\x9d asked M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe, my thief!\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, the traitor!\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil take the madman!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cunless,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a cunning mode of escaping, seeing that he had failed in\r\nhis purpose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\nTHE SHOULDER OF ATHOS, THE BALDRIC OF PORTHOS AND THE HANDKERCHIEF OF\r\nARAMIS\r\n\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in a state of fury, crossed the antechamber at three\r\nbounds, and was darting toward the stairs, which he reckoned upon\r\ndescending four at a time, when, in his heedless course, he ran head\r\nforemost against a Musketeer who was coming out of one of M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s private rooms, and striking his shoulder violently, made him\r\nutter a cry, or rather a howl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, endeavoring to resume his course, \xe2\x80\x9cexcuse\r\nme, but I am in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScarcely had he descended the first stair, when a hand of iron seized\r\nhim by the belt and stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are in a hurry?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Musketeer, as pale as a sheet. \xe2\x80\x9cUnder\r\nthat pretense you run against me! You say, \xe2\x80\x98Excuse me,\xe2\x80\x99 and you believe\r\nthat is sufficient? Not at all, my young man. Do you fancy because you\r\nhave heard Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville speak to us a little cavalierly today\r\nthat other people are to treat us as he speaks to us? Undeceive\r\nyourself, comrade, you are not Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith!\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, recognizing Athos, who, after the\r\ndressing performed by the doctor, was returning to his own apartment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not do it intentionally, and not doing it intentionally, I said\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Excuse me.\xe2\x80\x99 It appears to me that this is quite enough. I repeat to\r\nyou, however, and this time on my word of honor\xe2\x80\x94I think perhaps too\r\noften\xe2\x80\x94that I am in haste, great haste. Leave your hold, then, I beg of\r\nyou, and let me go where my business calls me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, letting him go, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not polite; it is easy\r\nto perceive that you come from a distance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had already strode down three or four stairs, but at Athos\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlast remark he stopped short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Morbleu_, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9chowever far I may come, it is not you\r\nwho can give me a lesson in good manners, I warn you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! If I were not in such haste, and if I were not running after\r\nsomeone,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Man-in-a-hurry, you can find me without running\xe2\x80\x94_me_, you\r\nunderstand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where, I pray you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNear the Carmes-Deschaux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout noon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout noon? That will do; I will be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEndeavor not to make me wait; for at quarter past twelve I will cut\r\noff your ears as you run.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI will be there ten minutes before twelve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he set off running as if the devil possessed him, hoping that he\r\nmight yet find the stranger, whose slow pace could not have carried him\r\nfar.\r\n\r\nBut at the street gate, Porthos was talking with the soldier on guard.\r\nBetween the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan thought it would suffice for him, and he sprang forward like\r\na dart between them. But D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had reckoned without the wind. As\r\nhe was about to pass, the wind blew out Porthos\xe2\x80\x99s long cloak, and\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan rushed straight into the middle of it. Without doubt,\r\nPorthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments, for\r\ninstead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand, he pulled it\r\ntoward him, so that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a\r\nmovement of rotation explained by the persistency of Porthos.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, hearing the Musketeer swear, wished to escape from the\r\ncloak, which blinded him, and sought to find his way from under the\r\nfolds of it. He was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness\r\nof the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with; but on timidly\r\nopening his eyes, he found himself with his nose fixed between the two\r\nshoulders of Porthos\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, exactly upon the baldric.\r\n\r\nAlas, like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor\r\nbut appearances, the baldric was glittering with gold in the front, but\r\nwas nothing but simple buff behind. Vainglorious as he was, Porthos\r\ncould not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold, but had at least\r\nhalf. One could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of\r\nthe cloak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos, making strong efforts to disembarrass\r\nhimself of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who was wriggling about his back; \xe2\x80\x9cyou must be\r\nmad to run against people in this manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, reappearing under the shoulder of the\r\ngiant, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am in such haste\xe2\x80\x94I was running after someone and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you always forget your eyes when you run?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, piqued, \xe2\x80\x9cand thanks to my eyes, I can see\r\nwhat other people cannot see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhether Porthos understood him or did not understand him, giving way to\r\nhis anger, \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou stand a chance of getting\r\nchastised if you rub Musketeers in this fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChastised, Monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthe expression is strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the\r\nface.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, _pardieu!_ I know full well that you don\xe2\x80\x99t turn your back to\r\nyours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the young man, delighted with his joke, went away laughing loudly.\r\n\r\nPorthos foamed with rage, and made a movement to rush after D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresently, presently,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the latter, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you haven\xe2\x80\x99t your cloak\r\non.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, then, behind the Luxembourg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, then,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, turning the\r\nangle of the street.\r\n\r\nBut neither in the street he had passed through, nor in the one which\r\nhis eager glance pervaded, could he see anyone; however slowly the\r\nstranger had walked, he was gone on his way, or perhaps had entered\r\nsome house. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan inquired of everyone he met with, went down to\r\nthe ferry, came up again by the Rue de Seine, and the Red Cross; but\r\nnothing, absolutely nothing! This chase was, however, advantageous to\r\nhim in one sense, for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his\r\nforehead, his heart began to cool.\r\n\r\nHe began to reflect upon the events that had passed; they were numerous\r\nand inauspicious. It was scarcely eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, and\r\nyet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville, who could not fail to think the manner in which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nhad left him a little cavalier.\r\n\r\nBesides this, he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men,\r\neach capable of killing three D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnans\xe2\x80\x94with two Musketeers, in\r\nshort, with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he\r\nplaced them in his mind and heart above all other men.\r\n\r\nThe outlook was sad. Sure of being killed by Athos, it may easily be\r\nunderstood that the young man was not very uneasy about Porthos. As\r\nhope, however, is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man, he\r\nfinished by hoping that he might survive, even though with terrible\r\nwounds, in both these duels; and in case of surviving, he made the\r\nfollowing reprehensions upon his own conduct:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a madcap I was, and what a stupid fellow I am! That brave and\r\nunfortunate Athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which I\r\nmust run head foremost, like a ram. The only thing that astonishes me\r\nis that he did not strike me dead at once. He had good cause to do so;\r\nthe pain I gave him must have been atrocious. As to Porthos\xe2\x80\x94oh, as to\r\nPorthos, faith, that\xe2\x80\x99s a droll affair!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in spite of himself, the young man began to laugh aloud, looking\r\nround carefully, however, to see that his solitary laugh, without a\r\ncause in the eyes of passers-by, offended no one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to Porthos, that is certainly droll; but I am not the less a giddy\r\nfool. Are people to be run against without warning? No! And have I any\r\nright to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there? He\r\nwould have pardoned me, he would certainly have pardoned me, if I had\r\nnot said anything to him about that cursed baldric\xe2\x80\x94in ambiguous words,\r\nit is true, but rather drolly ambiguous. Ah, cursed Gascon that I am, I\r\nget from one hobble into another. Friend D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he,\r\nspeaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif you escape, of which there is not much chance, I would advise you\r\nto practice perfect politeness for the future. You must henceforth be\r\nadmired and quoted as a model of it. To be obliging and polite does not\r\nnecessarily make a man a coward. Look at Aramis, now; Aramis is\r\nmildness and grace personified. Well, did anybody ever dream of calling\r\nAramis a coward? No, certainly not, and from this moment I will\r\nendeavor to model myself after him. Ah! That\xe2\x80\x99s strange! Here he is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, walking and soliloquizing, had arrived within a few steps\r\nof the h\xc3\xb4tel d\xe2\x80\x99Arguillon and in front of that h\xc3\xb4tel perceived Aramis,\r\nchatting gaily with three gentlemen; but as he had not forgotten that\r\nit was in presence of this young man that M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville had been so\r\nangry in the morning, and as a witness of the rebuke the Musketeers had\r\nreceived was not likely to be at all agreeable, he pretended not to see\r\nhim. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, on the contrary, quite full of his plans of\r\nconciliation and courtesy, approached the young men with a profound\r\nbow, accompanied by a most gracious smile. All four, besides,\r\nimmediately broke off their conversation.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many;\r\nbut he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world\r\nto know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position, like\r\nthat of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely\r\nacquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him. He was\r\nseeking in his mind, then, for the least awkward means of retreat, when\r\nhe remarked that Aramis had let his handkerchief fall, and by mistake,\r\nno doubt, had placed his foot upon it. This appeared to be a favorable\r\nopportunity to repair his intrusion. He stooped, and with the most\r\ngracious air he could assume, drew the handkerchief from under the foot\r\nof the Musketeer in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it,\r\nand holding it out to him, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe, monsieur, that this is a\r\nhandkerchief you would be sorry to lose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered, and had a coronet and\r\narms at one of its corners. Aramis blushed excessively, and snatched\r\nrather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the Gascon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d cried one of the Guards, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you persist in saying, most\r\ndiscreet Aramis, that you are not on good terms with Madame de\r\nBois-Tracy, when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of\r\nher handkerchiefs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis darted at D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan one of those looks which inform a man that\r\nhe has acquired a mortal enemy. Then, resuming his mild air, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\ndeceived, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthis handkerchief is not mine, and I\r\ncannot fancy why Monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me\r\nrather than to one of you; and as a proof of what I say, here is mine\r\nin my pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he pulled out his own handkerchief, likewise a very elegant\r\nhandkerchief, and of fine cambric\xe2\x80\x94though cambric was dear at the\r\nperiod\xe2\x80\x94but a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms, only\r\nornamented with a single cipher, that of its proprietor.\r\n\r\nThis time D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was not hasty. He perceived his mistake; but the\r\nfriends of Aramis were not at all convinced by his denial, and one of\r\nthem addressed the young Musketeer with affected seriousness. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\r\nwere as you pretend it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be forced, my dear\r\nAramis, to reclaim it myself; for, as you very well know, Bois-Tracy is\r\nan intimate friend of mine, and I cannot allow the property of his wife\r\nto be sported as a trophy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou make the demand badly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis; \xe2\x80\x9cand while acknowledging\r\nthe justice of your reclamation, I refuse it on account of the form.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is,\xe2\x80\x9d hazarded D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, timidly, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not see the\r\nhandkerchief fall from the pocket of Monsieur Aramis. He had his foot\r\nupon it, that is all; and I thought from having his foot upon it the\r\nhandkerchief was his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you were deceived, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis, coldly, very\r\nlittle sensible to the reparation. Then turning toward that one of the\r\nguards who had declared himself the friend of Bois-Tracy, \xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued he, \xe2\x80\x9cI have reflected, my dear intimate of Bois-Tracy, that I\r\nam not less tenderly his friend than you can possibly be; so that\r\ndecidedly this handkerchief is as likely to have fallen from your\r\npocket as mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, upon my honor!\xe2\x80\x9d cried his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s Guardsman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are about to swear upon your honor and I upon my word, and then it\r\nwill be pretty evident that one of us will have lied. Now, here,\r\nMontaran, we will do better than that\xe2\x80\x94let each take a half.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the handkerchief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly just,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the other two Guardsmen, \xe2\x80\x9cthe judgment of King\r\nSolomon! Aramis, you certainly are full of wisdom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young men burst into a laugh, and as may be supposed, the affair\r\nhad no other sequel. In a moment or two the conversation ceased, and\r\nthe three Guardsmen and the Musketeer, after having cordially shaken\r\nhands, separated, the Guardsmen going one way and Aramis another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow is my time to make peace with this gallant man,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nto himself, having stood on one side during the whole of the latter\r\npart of the conversation; and with this good feeling drawing near to\r\nAramis, who was departing without paying any attention to him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will excuse me, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cpermit me to observe to you that\r\nyou have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cand do you suppose\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose, monsieur, that you are not a fool, and that you knew very\r\nwell, although coming from Gascony, that people do not tread upon\r\nhandkerchiefs without a reason. What the devil! Paris is not paved with\r\ncambric!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more\r\nloudly than his pacific resolutions. \xe2\x80\x9cI am from Gascony, it is true;\r\nand since you know it, there is no occasion to tell you that Gascons\r\nare not very patient, so that when they have begged to be excused once,\r\nwere it even for a folly, they are convinced that they have done\r\nalready at least as much again as they ought to have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, what I say to you about the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cis not\r\nfor the sake of seeking a quarrel. Thank God, I am not a bravo! And\r\nbeing a Musketeer but for a time, I only fight when I am forced to do\r\nso, and always with great repugnance; but this time the affair is\r\nserious, for here is a lady compromised by you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy _us_, you mean!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you so maladroitly restore me the handkerchief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you so awkwardly let it fall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said, monsieur, and I repeat, that the handkerchief did not\r\nfall from my pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thereby you have lied twice, monsieur, for I saw it fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you take it with that tone, do you, Master Gascon? Well, I will\r\nteach you how to behave yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will send you back to your Mass book, Master Abb\xc3\xa9. Draw, if you\r\nplease, and instantly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so, if you please, my good friend\xe2\x80\x94not here, at least. Do you not\r\nperceive that we are opposite the H\xc3\xb4tel d\xe2\x80\x99Arguillon, which is full of\r\nthe cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s creatures? How do I know that this is not his Eminence\r\nwho has honored you with the commission to procure my head? Now, I\r\nentertain a ridiculous partiality for my head, it seems to suit my\r\nshoulders so correctly. I wish to kill you, be at rest as to that, but\r\nto kill you quietly in a snug, remote place, where you will not be able\r\nto boast of your death to anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agree, monsieur; but do not be too confident. Take your\r\nhandkerchief; whether it belongs to you or another, you may perhaps\r\nstand in need of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur is a Gascon?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Monsieur does not postpone an interview through prudence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrudence, monsieur, is a virtue sufficiently useless to Musketeers, I\r\nknow, but indispensable to churchmen; and as I am only a Musketeer\r\nprovisionally, I hold it good to be prudent. At two o\xe2\x80\x99clock I shall\r\nhave the honor of expecting you at the h\xc3\xb4tel of Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\r\nThere I will indicate to you the best place and time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two young men bowed and separated, Aramis ascending the street\r\nwhich led to the Luxembourg, while D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, perceiving the appointed\r\nhour was approaching, took the road to the Carmes-Deschaux, saying to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly I can\xe2\x80\x99t draw back; but at least, if I am killed, I\r\nshall be killed by a Musketeer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\nTHE KING\xe2\x80\x99S MUSKETEERS AND THE CARDINAL\xe2\x80\x99S GUARDS\r\n\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was acquainted with nobody in Paris. He went therefore to\r\nhis appointment with Athos without a second, determined to be satisfied\r\nwith those his adversary should choose. Besides, his intention was\r\nformed to make the brave Musketeer all suitable apologies, but without\r\nmeanness or weakness, fearing that might result from this duel which\r\ngenerally results from an affair of this kind, when a young and\r\nvigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nconquered, he doubles the triumph of his antagonist; if a conqueror, he\r\nis accused of foul play and want of courage.\r\n\r\nNow, we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker,\r\nor our readers must have already perceived that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was not an\r\nordinary man; therefore, while repeating to himself that his death was\r\ninevitable, he did not make up his mind to die quietly, as one less\r\ncourageous and less restrained might have done in his place. He\r\nreflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going\r\nto fight, and began to view his situation more clearly. He hoped, by\r\nmeans of loyal excuses, to make a friend of Athos, whose lordly air and\r\naustere bearing pleased him much. He flattered himself he should be\r\nable to frighten Porthos with the adventure of the baldric, which he\r\nmight, if not killed upon the spot, relate to everybody a recital\r\nwhich, well managed, would cover Porthos with ridicule. As to the\r\nastute Aramis, he did not entertain much dread of him; and supposing he\r\nshould be able to get so far, he determined to dispatch him in good\r\nstyle or at least, by hitting him in the face, as C\xc3\xa6sar recommended his\r\nsoldiers do to those of Pompey, to damage forever the beauty of which\r\nhe was so proud.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan possessed that invincible stock of\r\nresolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEndure nothing from anyone but the king, the cardinal, and Monsieur de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville.\xe2\x80\x9d He flew, then, rather than walked, toward the convent of the\r\nCarmes D\xc3\xa9chauss\xc3\xa9s, or rather Deschaux, as it was called at that period,\r\na sort of building without a window, surrounded by barren fields\xe2\x80\x94an\r\naccessory to the Preaux-Clercs, and which was generally employed as the\r\nplace for the duels of men who had no time to lose.\r\n\r\nWhen D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which\r\nextended along the foot of the monastery, Athos had been waiting about\r\nfive minutes, and twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock was striking. He was, then, as\r\npunctual as the Samaritan woman, and the most rigorous casuist with\r\nregard to duels could have nothing to say.\r\n\r\nAthos, who still suffered grievously from his wound, though it had been\r\ndressed anew by M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s surgeon, was seated on a post and\r\nwaiting for his adversary with hat in hand, his feather even touching\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cI have engaged two of my friends as seconds;\r\nbut these two friends are not yet come, at which I am astonished, as it\r\nis not at all their custom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no seconds on my part, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cfor having\r\nonly arrived yesterday in Paris, I as yet know no one but Monsieur de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville, to whom I was recommended by my father, who has the honor to\r\nbe, in some degree, one of his friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos reflected for an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know no one but Monsieur de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur, I know only him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but then,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Athos, speaking half to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cif I kill\r\nyou, I shall have the air of a boy-slayer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot too much so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with a bow that was not\r\ndeficient in dignity, \xe2\x80\x9csince you do me the honor to draw a sword with\r\nme while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery inconvenient, upon my word; and you hurt me devilishly, I can\r\ntell you. But I will take the left hand\xe2\x80\x94it is my custom in such\r\ncircumstances. Do not fancy that I do you a favor; I use either hand\r\neasily. And it will be even a disadvantage to you; a left-handed man is\r\nvery troublesome to people who are not prepared for it. I regret I did\r\nnot inform you sooner of this circumstance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have truly, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, bowing again, \xe2\x80\x9ca courtesy,\r\nfor which, I assure you, I am very grateful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou confuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos, with his gentlemanly air; \xe2\x80\x9clet us talk\r\nof something else, if you please. Ah, s\xe2\x80\x99blood, how you have hurt me! My\r\nshoulder quite burns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you would permit me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with timidity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a miraculous balsam for wounds\xe2\x80\x94a balsam given to me by my\r\nmother and of which I have made a trial upon myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am sure that in less than three days this balsam would cure\r\nyou; and at the end of three days, when you would be cured\xe2\x80\x94well, sir,\r\nit would still do me a great honor to be your man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his\r\ncourtesy, without throwing the least doubt upon his courage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pardieu_, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a proposition that pleases\r\nme; not that I can accept it, but a league off it savors of the\r\ngentleman. Thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of\r\nCharlemagne, in whom every cavalier ought to seek his model.\r\nUnfortunately, we do not live in the times of the great emperor, we\r\nlive in the times of the cardinal; and three days hence, however well\r\nthe secret might be guarded, it would be known, I say, that we were to\r\nfight, and our combat would be prevented. I think these fellows will\r\nnever come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are in haste, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with the same\r\nsimplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to him to put off\r\nthe duel for three days, \xe2\x80\x9cand if it be your will to dispatch me at\r\nonce, do not inconvenience yourself, I pray you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is another word which pleases me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos, with a gracious\r\nnod to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cThat did not come from a man without a heart.\r\nMonsieur, I love men of your kidney; and I foresee plainly that if we\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t kill each other, I shall hereafter have much pleasure in your\r\nconversation. We will wait for these gentlemen, so please you; I have\r\nplenty of time, and it will be more correct. Ah, here is one of them, I\r\nbelieve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, at the end of the Rue Vaugirard the gigantic Porthos appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cis your first witness Monsieur Porthos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that disturbs you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here is the second.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by Athos, and perceived\r\nAramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, in an accent of greater astonishment than before,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyour second witness is Monsieur Aramis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless! Are you not aware that we are never seen one without the\r\nothers, and that we are called among the Musketeers and the Guards, at\r\ncourt and in the city, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, or the Three\r\nInseparables? And yet, as you come from Dax or Pau\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Tarbes,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is probable you are ignorant of this little fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith!\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are well named, gentlemen; and my\r\nadventure, if it should make any noise, will prove at least that your\r\nunion is not founded upon contrasts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Porthos had come up, waved his hand to Athos, and then\r\nturning toward D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, stood quite astonished.\r\n\r\nLet us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished\r\nhis cloak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the gentleman I am going to fight with,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, pointing\r\nto D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it is with him I am also going to fight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not before one o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I also am to fight with this gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, coming in\r\nhis turn onto the place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not until two o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with the same calmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are you going to fight about, Athos?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith! I don\xe2\x80\x99t very well know. He hurt my shoulder. And you, Porthos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith! I am going to fight\xe2\x80\x94because I am going to fight,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nPorthos, reddening.\r\n\r\nAthos, whose keen eye lost nothing, perceived a faintly sly smile pass\r\nover the lips of the young Gascon as he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a short\r\ndiscussion upon dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Aramis?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ours is a theological quarrel,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis, making a sign to\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel.\r\n\r\nAthos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; a passage of St. Augustine, upon which we could not agree,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Gascon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly, this is a clever fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you are assembled, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cpermit me to\r\noffer you my apologies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this word _apologies_, a cloud passed over the brow of Athos, a\r\nhaughty smile curled the lip of Porthos, and a negative sign was the\r\nreply of Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not understand me, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, throwing up his\r\nhead, the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a\r\nbright ray of the sun. \xe2\x80\x9cI asked to be excused in case I should not be\r\nable to discharge my debt to all three; for Monsieur Athos has the\r\nright to kill me first, which must much diminish the face-value of your\r\nbill, Monsieur Porthos, and render yours almost null, Monsieur Aramis.\r\nAnd now, gentlemen, I repeat, excuse me, but on that account only,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94on guard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words, with the most gallant air possible, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan drew his\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nThe blood had mounted to the head of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and at that moment he\r\nwould have drawn his sword against all the Musketeers in the kingdom as\r\nwillingly as he now did against Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter past midday. The sun was in its zenith, and the spot\r\nchosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very hot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, drawing his sword in its turn, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet I\r\ncannot take off my doublet; for I just now felt my wound begin to bleed\r\nagain, and I should not like to annoy Monsieur with the sight of blood\r\nwhich he has not drawn from me himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true, Monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cand whether drawn by\r\nmyself or another, I assure you I shall always view with regret the\r\nblood of so brave a gentleman. I will therefore fight in my doublet,\r\nlike yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, enough of such compliments!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember, we\r\nare waiting for our turns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such incongruities,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninterrupted Aramis. \xe2\x80\x9cFor my part, I think what they say is very well\r\nsaid, and quite worthy of two gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you please, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, putting himself on guard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI waited your orders,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, crossing swords.\r\n\r\nBut scarcely had the two rapiers clashed, when a company of the Guards\r\nof his Eminence, commanded by M. de Jussac, turned the corner of the\r\nconvent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s Guards!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Aramis and Porthos at the same time.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSheathe your swords, gentlemen, sheathe your swords!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it was too late. The two combatants had been seen in a position\r\nwhich left no doubt of their intentions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jussac, advancing toward them and making a sign to his\r\nmen to do so likewise, \xe2\x80\x9challoo, Musketeers? Fighting here, are you? And\r\nthe edicts? What is become of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very generous, gentlemen of the Guards,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, full of\r\nrancor, for Jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nwe were to see you fighting, I can assure you that we would make no\r\neffort to prevent you. Leave us alone, then, and you will enjoy a\r\nlittle amusement without cost to yourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jussac, \xe2\x80\x9cit is with great regret that I pronounce the\r\nthing impossible. Duty before everything. Sheathe, then, if you please,\r\nand follow us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, parodying Jussac, \xe2\x80\x9cit would afford us great\r\npleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves;\r\nbut unfortunately the thing is impossible\xe2\x80\x94Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville has\r\nforbidden it. Pass on your way, then; it is the best thing to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis raillery exasperated Jussac. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will charge upon you, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cif you disobey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are five of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, half aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cand we are but\r\nthree; we shall be beaten again, and must die on the spot, for, on my\r\npart, I declare I will never appear again before the captain as a\r\nconquered man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos, Porthos, and Aramis instantly drew near one another, while\r\nJussac drew up his soldiers.\r\n\r\nThis short interval was sufficient to determine D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan on the part\r\nhe was to take. It was one of those events which decide the life of a\r\nman; it was a choice between the king and the cardinal\xe2\x80\x94the choice made,\r\nit must be persisted in. To fight, that was to disobey the law, that\r\nwas to risk his head, that was to make at one blow an enemy of a\r\nminister more powerful than the king himself. All this the young man\r\nperceived, and yet, to his praise we speak it, he did not hesitate a\r\nsecond. Turning towards Athos and his friends, \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9callow me to correct your words, if you please. You said you were but\r\nthree, but it appears to me we are four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are not one of us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cI have not the uniform, but I have\r\nthe spirit. My heart is that of a Musketeer; I feel it, monsieur, and\r\nthat impels me on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithdraw, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jussac, who doubtless, by his gestures and\r\nthe expression of his countenance, had guessed D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s design.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may retire; we consent to that. Save your skin; begone quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan did not budge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly, you are a brave fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, pressing the young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, choose your part,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jussac.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos to Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must do something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur is full of generosity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\nBut all three reflected upon the youth of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and dreaded his\r\ninexperience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe should only be three, one of whom is wounded, with the addition of\r\na boy,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cand yet it will not be the less said we were\r\nfour men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but to yield!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat _is_ difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan comprehended their irresolution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry me, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand I swear to you by my honor that I\r\nwill not go hence if we are conquered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name, my brave fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, forward!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nAthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, gentlemen, have you decided?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jussac for the third time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is done, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is your choice?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jussac.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are about to have the honor of charging you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis,\r\nlifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You resist, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jussac.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x99blood; does that astonish you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which\r\nhowever did not exclude a certain degree of method.\r\n\r\nAthos fixed upon a certain Cahusac, a favorite of the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nPorthos had Bicarat, and Aramis found himself opposed to two\r\nadversaries. As to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, he sprang toward Jussac himself.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the young Gascon beat as if it would burst through his\r\nside\xe2\x80\x94not from fear, God be thanked, he had not the shade of it, but\r\nwith emulation; he fought like a furious tiger, turning ten times round\r\nhis adversary, and changing his ground and his guard twenty times.\r\nJussac was, as was then said, a fine blade, and had had much practice;\r\nnevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an\r\nadversary who, active and energetic, departed every instant from\r\nreceived rules, attacking him on all sides at once, and yet parrying\r\nlike a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis.\r\n\r\nThis contest at length exhausted Jussac\xe2\x80\x99s patience. Furious at being\r\nheld in check by one whom he had considered a boy, he became warm and\r\nbegan to make mistakes. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who though wanting in practice had\r\na sound theory, redoubled his agility. Jussac, anxious to put an end to\r\nthis, springing forward, aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary, but\r\nthe latter parried it; and while Jussac was recovering himself, glided\r\nlike a serpent beneath his blade, and passed his sword through his\r\nbody. Jussac fell like a dead mass.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nAramis had killed one of his adversaries, but the other pressed him\r\nwarmly. Nevertheless, Aramis was in a good situation, and able to\r\ndefend himself.\r\n\r\nBicarat and Porthos had just made counterhits. Porthos had received a\r\nthrust through his arm, and Bicarat one through his thigh. But neither\r\nof these two wounds was serious, and they only fought more earnestly.\r\n\r\nAthos, wounded anew by Cahusac, became evidently paler, but did not\r\ngive way a foot. He only changed his sword hand, and fought with his\r\nleft hand.\r\n\r\nAccording to the laws of dueling at that period, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was at\r\nliberty to assist whom he pleased. While he was endeavoring to find out\r\nwhich of his companions stood in greatest need, he caught a glance from\r\nAthos. The glance was of sublime eloquence. Athos would have died\r\nrather than appeal for help; but he could look, and with that look ask\r\nassistance. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan interpreted it; with a terrible bound he sprang\r\nto the side of Cahusac, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cTo me, Monsieur Guardsman; I will slay\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCahusac turned. It was time; for Athos, whose great courage alone\r\nsupported him, sank upon his knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x99blood!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not kill him, young man, I beg\r\nof you. I have an old affair to settle with him when I am cured and\r\nsound again. Disarm him only\xe2\x80\x94make sure of his sword. That\xe2\x80\x99s it! Very\r\nwell done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe exclamation was drawn from Athos by seeing the sword of Cahusac fly\r\ntwenty paces from him. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and Cahusac sprang forward at the\r\nsame instant, the one to recover, the other to obtain, the sword; but\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, being the more active, reached it first and placed his foot\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nCahusac immediately ran to the Guardsman whom Aramis had killed, seized\r\nhis rapier, and returned toward D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; but on his way he met\r\nAthos, who during his relief which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had procured him had\r\nrecovered his breath, and who, for fear that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan would kill his\r\nenemy, wished to resume the fight.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging Athos not to leave\r\nhim alone; and in a few minutes Cahusac fell, with a sword thrust\r\nthrough his throat.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant Aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his\r\nfallen enemy, and forced him to ask for mercy.\r\n\r\nThere only then remained Porthos and Bicarat. Porthos made a thousand\r\nflourishes, asking Bicarat what o\xe2\x80\x99clock it could be, and offering him\r\nhis compliments upon his brother\xe2\x80\x99s having just obtained a company in\r\nthe regiment of Navarre; but, jest as he might, he gained nothing.\r\nBicarat was one of those iron men who never fell dead.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it was necessary to finish. The watch might come up and\r\ntake all the combatants, wounded or not, royalists or cardinalists.\r\nAthos, Aramis, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan surrounded Bicarat, and required him to\r\nsurrender. Though alone against all and with a wound in his thigh,\r\nBicarat wished to hold out; but Jussac, who had risen upon his elbow,\r\ncried out to him to yield. Bicarat was a Gascon, as D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was; he\r\nturned a deaf ear, and contented himself with laughing, and between two\r\nparries finding time to point to a spot of earth with his sword,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, parodying a verse of the Bible, \xe2\x80\x9chere will Bicarat\r\ndie; for I only am left, and they seek my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there are four against you; leave off, I command you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, if you command me, that\xe2\x80\x99s another thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bicarat. \xe2\x80\x9cAs you\r\nare my commander, it is my duty to obey.\xe2\x80\x9d And springing backward, he\r\nbroke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering\r\nit, threw the pieces over the convent wall, and crossed his arms,\r\nwhistling a cardinalist air.\r\n\r\nBravery is always respected, even in an enemy. The Musketeers saluted\r\nBicarat with their swords, and returned them to their sheaths.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan did the same. Then, assisted by Bicarat, the only one left\r\nstanding, they bore Jussac, Cahusac, and one of Aramis\xe2\x80\x99s adversaries\r\nwho was only wounded, under the porch of the convent. The fourth, as we\r\nhave said, was dead. They then rang the bell, and carrying away four\r\nswords out of five, they took their road, intoxicated with joy, toward\r\nthe h\xc3\xb4tel of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\r\n\r\nThey walked arm in arm, occupying the whole width of the street and\r\ntaking in every Musketeer they met, so that in the end it became a\r\ntriumphal march. The heart of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan swam in delirium; he marched\r\nbetween Athos and Porthos, pressing them tenderly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am not yet a Musketeer,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to his new friends, as he passed\r\nthrough the gateway of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s h\xc3\xb4tel, \xe2\x80\x9cat least I have entered\r\nupon my apprenticeship, haven\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\nHIS MAJESTY KING LOUIS XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis affair made a great noise. M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville scolded his Musketeers\r\nin public, and congratulated them in private; but as no time was to be\r\nlost in gaining the king, M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville hastened to report himself at\r\nthe Louvre. It was already too late. The king was closeted with the\r\ncardinal, and M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville was informed that the king was busy and\r\ncould not receive him at that moment. In the evening M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\r\nattended the king\xe2\x80\x99s gaming table. The king was winning; and as he was\r\nvery avaricious, he was in an excellent humor. Perceiving M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville at a distance\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, Monsieur Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9ccome here, that I may growl at\r\nyou. Do you know that his Eminence has been making fresh complaints\r\nagainst your Musketeers, and that with so much emotion, that this\r\nevening his Eminence is indisposed? Ah, these Musketeers of yours are\r\nvery devils\xe2\x80\x94fellows to be hanged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sire,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Tr\xc3\xa9ville, who saw at the first glance how things\r\nwould go, \xe2\x80\x9con the contrary, they are good creatures, as meek as lambs,\r\nand have but one desire, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be their warranty. And that is that their\r\nswords may never leave their scabbards but in your majesty\xe2\x80\x99s service.\r\nBut what are they to do? The Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal are\r\nforever seeking quarrels with them, and for the honor of the corps\r\neven, the poor young men are obliged to defend themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king; \xe2\x80\x9clisten to him! Would\r\nnot one say he was speaking of a religious community? In truth, my dear\r\nCaptain, I have a great mind to take away your commission and give it\r\nto Mademoiselle de Chemerault, to whom I promised an abbey. But don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfancy that I am going to take you on your bare word. I am called Louis\r\nthe Just, Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, and by and by, by and by we will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, sire; it is because I confide in that justice that I shall wait\r\npatiently and quietly the good pleasure of your Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, then, monsieur, wait,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king; \xe2\x80\x9cI will not detain you\r\nlong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, fortune changed; and as the king began to lose what he had\r\nwon, he was not sorry to find an excuse for playing Charlemagne\xe2\x80\x94if we\r\nmay use a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess our ignorance. The\r\nking therefore arose a minute after, and putting the money which lay\r\nbefore him into his pocket, the major part of which arose from his\r\nwinnings, \xe2\x80\x9cLa Vieuville,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9ctake my place; I must speak to\r\nMonsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville on an affair of importance. Ah, I had eighty louis\r\nbefore me; put down the same sum, so that they who have lost may have\r\nnothing to complain of. Justice before everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen turning toward M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville and walking with him toward the\r\nembrasure of a window, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou say it is\r\nhis Eminence\xe2\x80\x99s Guards who have sought a quarrel with your Musketeers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sire, as they always do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how did the thing happen? Let us see, for you know, my dear\r\nCaptain, a judge must hear both sides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord! In the most simple and natural manner possible. Three of my\r\nbest soldiers, whom your Majesty knows by name, and whose devotedness\r\nyou have more than once appreciated, and who have, I dare affirm to the\r\nking, his service much at heart\xe2\x80\x94three of my best soldiers, I say,\r\nAthos, Porthos, and Aramis, had made a party of pleasure with a young\r\nfellow from Gascony, whom I had introduced to them the same morning.\r\nThe party was to take place at St. Germain, I believe, and they had\r\nappointed to meet at the Carmes-Deschaux, when they were disturbed by\r\nde Jussac, Cahusac, Bicarat, and two other Guardsmen, who certainly did\r\nnot go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention\r\nagainst the edicts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah! You incline me to think so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt\r\nthey went thither to fight themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not accuse them, sire; but I leave your Majesty to judge what\r\nfive armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place\r\nas the neighborhood of the Convent des Carmes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you are right, Tr\xc3\xa9ville, you are right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, upon seeing my Musketeers they changed their minds, and forgot\r\ntheir private hatred for partisan hatred; for your Majesty cannot be\r\nignorant that the Musketeers, who belong to the king and nobody but the\r\nking, are the natural enemies of the Guardsmen, who belong to the\r\ncardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Tr\xc3\xa9ville, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, in a melancholy tone; \xe2\x80\x9cand it is\r\nvery sad, believe me, to see thus two parties in France, two heads to\r\nroyalty. But all this will come to an end, Tr\xc3\xa9ville, will come to an\r\nend. You say, then, that the Guardsmen sought a quarrel with the\r\nMusketeers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say that it is probable that things have fallen out so, but I will\r\nnot swear to it, sire. You know how difficult it is to discover the\r\ntruth; and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which\r\ncauses Louis XIII. to be named the Just\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, Tr\xc3\xa9ville; but they were not alone, your Musketeers.\r\nThey had a youth with them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sire, and one wounded man; so that three of the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMusketeers\xe2\x80\x94one of whom was wounded\xe2\x80\x94and a youth not only maintained\r\ntheir ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nGuardsmen, but absolutely brought four of them to earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this is a victory!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the king, all radiant, \xe2\x80\x9ca complete\r\nvictory!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sire; as complete as that of the Bridge of Ce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour men, one of them wounded, and a youth, say you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hardly a young man; but who, however, behaved himself so admirably\r\non this occasion that I will take the liberty of recommending him to\r\nyour Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does he call himself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, sire; he is the son of one of my oldest friends\xe2\x80\x94the son of\r\na man who served under the king your father, of glorious memory, in the\r\ncivil war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you say this young man behaved himself well? Tell me how,\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x94you know how I delight in accounts of war and fighting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Louis XIII. twisted his mustache proudly, placing his hand upon his\r\nhip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cas I told you, Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan is little\r\nmore than a boy; and as he has not the honor of being a Musketeer, he\r\nwas dressed as a citizen. The Guards of the cardinal, perceiving his\r\nyouth and that he did not belong to the corps, invited him to retire\r\nbefore they attacked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you may plainly see, Tr\xc3\xa9ville,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the king, \xe2\x80\x9cit was they\r\nwho attacked?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true, sire; there can be no more doubt on that head. They\r\ncalled upon him then to retire; but he answered that he was a Musketeer\r\nat heart, entirely devoted to your Majesty, and that therefore he would\r\nremain with Messieurs the Musketeers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrave young man!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the king.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he did remain with them; and your Majesty has in him so firm a\r\nchampion that it was he who gave Jussac the terrible sword thrust which\r\nhas made the cardinal so angry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe who wounded Jussac!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the king, \xe2\x80\x9che, a boy! Tr\xc3\xa9ville, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as I have the honor to relate it to your Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJussac, one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sire, for once he found his master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will see this young man, Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x94I will see him; and if anything\r\ncan be done\xe2\x80\x94well, we will make it our business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen will your Majesty deign to receive him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow, at midday, Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I bring him alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, bring me all four together. I wish to thank them all at once.\r\nDevoted men are so rare, Tr\xc3\xa9ville, by the back staircase. It is useless\r\nto let the cardinal know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand, Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x94an edict is still an edict, it is forbidden\r\nto fight, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this encounter, sire, is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a\r\nduel. It is a brawl; and the proof is that there were five of the\r\ncardinal\xe2\x80\x99s Guardsmen against my three Musketeers and Monsieur\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king; \xe2\x80\x9cbut never mind, Tr\xc3\xa9ville, come still by\r\nthe back staircase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville smiled; but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon\r\nthis child to rebel against his master, he saluted the king\r\nrespectfully, and with this agreement, took leave of him.\r\n\r\nThat evening the three Musketeers were informed of the honor accorded\r\nthem. As they had long been acquainted with the king, they were not\r\nmuch excited; but D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with his Gascon imagination, saw in it\r\nhis future fortune, and passed the night in golden dreams. By eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning he was at the apartment of Athos.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan found the Musketeer dressed and ready to go out. As the hour\r\nto wait upon the king was not till twelve, he had made a party with\r\nPorthos and Aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated\r\nnear the stables of the Luxembourg. Athos invited D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to follow\r\nthem; and although ignorant of the game, which he had never played, he\r\naccepted, not knowing what to do with his time from nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nmorning, as it then scarcely was, till twelve.\r\n\r\nThe two Musketeers were already there, and were playing together.\r\nAthos, who was very expert in all bodily exercises, passed with\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to the opposite side and challenged them; but at the first\r\neffort he made, although he played with his left hand, he found that\r\nhis wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nremained, therefore, alone; and as he declared he was too ignorant of\r\nthe game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one\r\nanother without counting. But one of these balls, launched by Porthos\xe2\x80\x99\r\nherculean hand, passed so close to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s face that he thought\r\nthat if, instead of passing near, it had hit him, his audience would\r\nhave been probably lost, as it would have been impossible for him to\r\npresent himself before the king. Now, as upon this audience, in his\r\nGascon imagination, depended his future life, he saluted Aramis and\r\nPorthos politely, declaring that he would not resume the game until he\r\nshould be prepared to play with them on more equal terms, and went and\r\ntook his place near the cord and in the gallery.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, among the spectators was one of his\r\nEminence\xe2\x80\x99s Guardsmen, who, still irritated by the defeat of his\r\ncompanions, which had happened only the day before, had promised\r\nhimself to seize the first opportunity of avenging it. He believed this\r\nopportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not\r\nastonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball, for he is\r\ndoubtless a Musketeer apprentice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan turned round as if a serpent had stung him, and fixed his\r\neyes intensely upon the Guardsman who had just made this insolent\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pardieu_,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the latter, twisting his mustache, \xe2\x80\x9clook at me as\r\nlong as you like, my little gentleman! I have said what I have said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as since that which you have said is too clear to require any\r\nexplanation,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg you to follow\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Guardsman, with the same jeering air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt once, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know who I am, without doubt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? I am completely ignorant; nor does it much disquiet me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re in the wrong there; for if you knew my name, perhaps you would\r\nnot be so pressing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBernajoux, at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, Monsieur Bernajoux,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, tranquilly, \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\nwait for you at the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, monsieur, I will follow you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not hurry yourself, monsieur, lest it be observed that we go out\r\ntogether. You must be aware that for our undertaking, company would be\r\nin the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Guardsman, astonished that his name had not\r\nproduced more effect upon the young man.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the name of Bernajoux was known to all the world, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nalone excepted, perhaps; for it was one of those which figured most\r\nfrequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal\r\ncould not repress.\r\n\r\nPorthos and Aramis were so engaged with their game, and Athos was\r\nwatching them with so much attention, that they did not even perceive\r\ntheir young companion go out, who, as he had told the Guardsman of his\r\nEminence, stopped outside the door. An instant after, the Guardsman\r\ndescended in his turn. As D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had no time to lose, on account of\r\nthe audience of the king, which was fixed for midday, he cast his eyes\r\naround, and seeing that the street was empty, said to his adversary,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith! It is fortunate for you, although your name is Bernajoux, to\r\nhave only to deal with an apprentice Musketeer. Never mind; be content,\r\nI will do my best. On guard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said he whom D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan thus provoked, \xe2\x80\x9cit appears to me that\r\nthis place is badly chosen, and that we should be better behind the\r\nAbbey St. Germain or in the Pr\xc3\xa9-aux-Clercs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you say is full of sense,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut unfortunately\r\nI have very little time to spare, having an appointment at twelve\r\nprecisely. On guard, then, monsieur, on guard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBernajoux was not a man to have such a compliment paid to him twice. In\r\nan instant his sword glittered in his hand, and he sprang upon his\r\nadversary, whom, thanks to his great youthfulness, he hoped to\r\nintimidate.\r\n\r\nBut D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had on the preceding day served his apprenticeship.\r\nFresh sharpened by his victory, full of hopes of future favor, he was\r\nresolved not to recoil a step. So the two swords were crossed close to\r\nthe hilts, and as D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan stood firm, it was his adversary who made\r\nthe retreating step; but D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan seized the moment at which, in this\r\nmovement, the sword of Bernajoux deviated from the line. He freed his\r\nweapon, made a lunge, and touched his adversary on the shoulder.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword; but\r\nBernajoux cried out that it was nothing, and rushing blindly upon him,\r\nabsolutely spitted himself upon D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s sword. As, however, he did\r\nnot fall, as he did not declare himself conquered, but only broke away\r\ntoward the h\xc3\xb4tel of M. de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille, in whose service he had a\r\nrelative, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound\r\nhis adversary had received, and pressing him warmly, without doubt\r\nwould soon have completed his work with a third blow, when the noise\r\nwhich arose from the street being heard in the tennis court, two of the\r\nfriends of the Guardsman, who had seen him go out after exchanging some\r\nwords with D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, rushed, sword in hand, from the court, and fell\r\nupon the conqueror. But Athos, Porthos, and Aramis quickly appeared in\r\ntheir turn, and the moment the two Guardsmen attacked their young\r\ncompanion, drove them back. Bernajoux now fell, and as the Guardsmen\r\nwere only two against four, they began to cry, \xe2\x80\x9cTo the rescue! The\r\nH\xc3\xb4tel de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille!\xe2\x80\x9d At these cries, all who were in the h\xc3\xb4tel\r\nrushed out and fell upon the four companions, who on their side cried\r\naloud, \xe2\x80\x9cTo the rescue, Musketeers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis cry was generally heeded; for the Musketeers were known to be\r\nenemies of the cardinal, and were beloved on account of the hatred they\r\nbore to his Eminence. Thus the soldiers of other companies than those\r\nwhich belonged to the Red Duke, as Aramis had called him, often took\r\npart with the king\xe2\x80\x99s Musketeers in these quarrels. Of three Guardsmen\r\nof the company of M. Dessessart who were passing, two came to the\r\nassistance of the four companions, while the other ran toward the h\xc3\xb4tel\r\nof M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cTo the rescue, Musketeers! To the rescue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAs usual, this h\xc3\xb4tel was full of soldiers of this company, who hastened\r\nto the succor of their comrades. The _m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e_ became general, but\r\nstrength was on the side of the Musketeers. The cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s Guards and\r\nM. de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille\xe2\x80\x99s people retreated into the h\xc3\xb4tel, the doors of\r\nwhich they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering\r\nwith them. As to the wounded man, he had been taken in at once, and, as\r\nwe have said, in a very bad state.\r\n\r\nExcitement was at its height among the Musketeers and their allies, and\r\nthey even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the\r\nh\xc3\xb4tel to punish the insolence of M. de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille\xe2\x80\x99s domestics in\r\ndaring to make a _sortie_ upon the king\xe2\x80\x99s Musketeers. The proposition\r\nhad been made, and received with enthusiasm, when fortunately eleven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock struck. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and his companions remembered their\r\naudience, and as they would very much have regretted that such an\r\nopportunity should be lost, they succeeded in calming their friends,\r\nwho contented themselves with hurling some paving stones against the\r\ngates; but the gates were too strong. They soon tired of the sport.\r\nBesides, those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had\r\nquit the group and were making their way toward the h\xc3\xb4tel of M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville, who was waiting for them, already informed of this fresh\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick to the Louvre,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cto the Louvre without losing an\r\ninstant, and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by\r\nthe cardinal. We will describe the thing to him as a consequence of the\r\naffair of yesterday, and the two will pass off together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, accompanied by the four young fellows, directed his\r\ncourse toward the Louvre; but to the great astonishment of the captain\r\nof the Musketeers, he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting\r\nin the forest of St. Germain. M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville required this intelligence\r\nto be repeated to him twice, and each time his companions saw his brow\r\nbecome darker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad his Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d asked he, \xe2\x80\x9cany intention of holding this hunting\r\nparty yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, your Excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the valet de chambre, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Master of the\r\nHounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a stag.\r\nAt first the king answered that he would not go; but he could not\r\nresist his love of sport, and set out after dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the king has seen the cardinal?\xe2\x80\x9d asked M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn all probability he has,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the valet, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I saw the horses\r\nharnessed to his Eminence\xe2\x80\x99s carriage this morning, and when I asked\r\nwhere he was going, they told me, \xe2\x80\x98To St. Germain.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is beforehand with us,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville. \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, I will see\r\nthe king this evening; but as to you, I do not advise you to risk doing\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis advice was too reasonable, and moreover came from a man who knew\r\nthe king too well, to allow the four young men to dispute it. M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville recommended everyone to return home and wait for news.\r\n\r\nOn entering his h\xc3\xb4tel, M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville thought it best to be first in\r\nmaking the complaint. He sent one of his servants to M. de la\r\nTr\xc3\xa9mouille with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the\r\ncardinal\xe2\x80\x99s Guardsmen from his house, and to reprimand his people for\r\ntheir audacity in making _sortie_ against the king\xe2\x80\x99s Musketeers. But M.\r\nde la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille\xe2\x80\x94already prejudiced by his esquire, whose relative, as\r\nwe already know, Bernajoux was\xe2\x80\x94replied that it was neither for M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville nor the Musketeers to complain, but, on the contrary, for him,\r\nwhose people the Musketeers had assaulted and whose h\xc3\xb4tel they had\r\nendeavored to burn. Now, as the debate between these two nobles might\r\nlast a long time, each becoming, naturally, more firm in his own\r\nopinion, M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville thought of an expedient which might terminate\r\nit quietly. This was to go himself to M. de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille.\r\n\r\nHe repaired, therefore, immediately to his h\xc3\xb4tel, and caused himself to\r\nbe announced.\r\n\r\nThe two nobles saluted each other politely, for if no friendship\r\nexisted between them, there was at least esteem. Both were men of\r\ncourage and honor; and as M. de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille\xe2\x80\x94a Protestant, and seeing\r\nthe king seldom\xe2\x80\x94was of no party, he did not, in general, carry any bias\r\ninto his social relations. This time, however, his address, although\r\npolite, was cooler than usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cwe fancy that we have each cause to\r\ncomplain of the other, and I am come to endeavor to clear up this\r\naffair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no objection,\xe2\x80\x9d replied M. de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I warn you\r\nthat I am well informed, and all the fault is with your Musketeers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too just and reasonable a man, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cnot\r\nto accept the proposal I am about to make to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake it, monsieur, I listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is Monsieur Bernajoux, your esquire\xe2\x80\x99s relative?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, monsieur, very ill indeed! In addition to the sword thrust in his\r\narm, which is not dangerous, he has received another right through his\r\nlungs, of which the doctor says bad things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut has the wounded man retained his senses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he talk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith difficulty, but he can speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, monsieur, let us go to him. Let us adjure him, in the name of\r\nthe God before whom he must perhaps appear, to speak the truth. I will\r\ntake him for judge in his own cause, monsieur, and will believe what he\r\nwill say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille reflected for an instant; then as it was difficult\r\nto suggest a more reasonable proposal, he agreed to it.\r\n\r\nBoth descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay. The latter,\r\non seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him, endeavored to\r\nraise himself up in his bed; but he was too weak, and exhausted by the\r\neffort, he fell back again almost senseless.\r\n\r\nM. de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille approached him, and made him inhale some salts,\r\nwhich recalled him to life. Then M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, unwilling that it\r\nshould be thought that he had influenced the wounded man, requested M.\r\nde la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille to interrogate him himself.\r\n\r\nThat happened which M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville had foreseen. Placed between life\r\nand death, as Bernajoux was, he had no idea for a moment of concealing\r\nthe truth; and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it\r\nhad passed.\r\n\r\nThis was all that M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville wanted. He wished Bernajoux a speedy\r\nconvalescence, took leave of M. de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille, returned to his\r\nh\xc3\xb4tel, and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited\r\ntheir company at dinner.\r\n\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville entertained good company, wholly anticardinalist,\r\nthough. It may easily be understood, therefore, that the conversation\r\nduring the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his\r\nEminence\xe2\x80\x99s Guardsmen had received. Now, as D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had been the hero\r\nof these two fights, it was upon him that all the felicitations fell,\r\nwhich Athos, Porthos, and Aramis abandoned to him, not only as good\r\ncomrades, but as men who had so often had their turn that they could\r\nvery well afford him his.\r\n\r\nToward six o\xe2\x80\x99clock M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville announced that it was time to go to\r\nthe Louvre; but as the hour of audience granted by his Majesty was\r\npast, instead of claiming the _entr\xc3\xa9e_ by the back stairs, he placed\r\nhimself with the four young men in the antechamber. The king had not\r\nyet returned from hunting. Our young men had been waiting about half an\r\nhour, amid a crowd of courtiers, when all the doors were thrown open,\r\nand his Majesty was announced.\r\n\r\nAt his announcement D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan felt himself tremble to the very marrow\r\nof his bones. The coming instant would in all probability decide the\r\nrest of his life. His eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon\r\nthe door through which the king must enter.\r\n\r\nLouis XIII. appeared, walking fast. He was in hunting costume covered\r\nwith dust, wearing large boots, and holding a whip in his hand. At the\r\nfirst glance, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan judged that the mind of the king was stormy.\r\n\r\nThis disposition, visible as it was in his Majesty, did not prevent the\r\ncourtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway. In royal\r\nantechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not\r\nto be seen at all. The three Musketeers therefore did not hesitate to\r\nmake a step forward. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan on the contrary remained concealed\r\nbehind them; but although the king knew Athos, Porthos, and Aramis\r\npersonally, he passed before them without speaking or looking\xe2\x80\x94indeed,\r\nas if he had never seen them before. As for M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, when the\r\neyes of the king fell upon him, he sustained the look with so much\r\nfirmness that it was the king who dropped his eyes; after which his\r\nMajesty, grumbling, entered his apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatters go but badly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cand we shall not be made\r\nChevaliers of the Order this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait here ten minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville; \xe2\x80\x9cand if at the expiration\r\nof ten minutes you do not see me come out, return to my h\xc3\xb4tel, for it\r\nwill be useless for you to wait for me longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe four young men waited ten minutes, a quarter of an hour, twenty\r\nminutes; and seeing that M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville did not return, went away very\r\nuneasy as to what was going to happen.\r\n\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville entered the king\xe2\x80\x99s cabinet boldly, and found his Majesty\r\nin a very ill humor, seated on an armchair, beating his boot with the\r\nhandle of his whip. This, however, did not prevent his asking, with the\r\ngreatest coolness, after his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s health.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad, monsieur, bad!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the king; \xe2\x80\x9cI am bored.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was, in fact, the worst complaint of Louis XIII., who would\r\nsometimes take one of his courtiers to a window and say, \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur\r\nSo-and-so, let us weary ourselves together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow! Your Majesty is bored? Have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the\r\nchase today?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine pleasure, indeed, monsieur! Upon my soul, everything\r\ndegenerates; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it is the game which leaves no\r\nscent, or the dogs that have no noses. We started a stag of ten\r\nbranches. We chased him for six hours, and when he was near being\r\ntaken\xe2\x80\x94when St. Simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound\r\nthe _halali_\xe2\x80\x94crack, all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off\r\nafter a two-year-older. I shall be obliged to give up hunting, as I\r\nhave given up hawking. Ah, I am an unfortunate king, Monsieur de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville! I had but one gerfalcon, and he died day before yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sire, I wholly comprehend your disappointment. The misfortune\r\nis great; but I think you have still a good number of falcons, sparrow\r\nhawks, and tiercels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not a man to instruct them. Falconers are declining. I know no one\r\nbut myself who is acquainted with the noble art of venery. After me it\r\nwill all be over, and people will hunt with gins, snares, and traps. If\r\nI had but the time to train pupils! But there is the cardinal always at\r\nhand, who does not leave me a moment\xe2\x80\x99s repose; who talks to me about\r\nSpain, who talks to me about Austria, who talks to me about England!\r\nAh! _\xc3\xa0 propos_ of the cardinal, Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, I am vexed with\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the chance at which M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville waited for the king. He\r\nknew the king of old, and he knew that all these complaints were but a\r\npreface\xe2\x80\x94a sort of excitation to encourage himself\xe2\x80\x94and that he had now\r\ncome to his point at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in what have I been so unfortunate as to displease your Majesty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, feigning the most profound astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it thus you perform your charge, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d continued the king,\r\nwithout directly replying to de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s question. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it for this I\r\nname you captain of my Musketeers, that they should assassinate a man,\r\ndisturb a whole quarter, and endeavor to set fire to Paris, without\r\nyour saying a word? But yet,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the king, \xe2\x80\x9cundoubtedly my haste\r\naccuses you wrongfully; without doubt the rioters are in prison, and\r\nyou come to tell me justice is done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire,\xe2\x80\x9d replied M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, calmly, \xe2\x80\x9con the contrary, I come to\r\ndemand it of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd against whom?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the king.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgainst calumniators,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! This is something new,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the king. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell me that\r\nyour three damned Musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, and your\r\nyoungster from B\xc3\xa9arn, have not fallen, like so many furies, upon poor\r\nBernajoux, and have not maltreated him in such a fashion that probably\r\nby this time he is dead? Will you tell me that they did not lay siege\r\nto the h\xc3\xb4tel of the Duc de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille, and that they did not\r\nendeavor to burn it?\xe2\x80\x94which would not, perhaps, have been a great\r\nmisfortune in time of war, seeing that it is nothing but a nest of\r\nHuguenots, but which is, in time of peace, a frightful example. Tell\r\nme, now, can you deny all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who told you this fine story, sire?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Tr\xc3\xa9ville, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has told me this fine story, monsieur? Who should it be but he who\r\nwatches while I sleep, who labors while I amuse myself, who conducts\r\neverything at home and abroad\xe2\x80\x94in France as in Europe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Majesty probably refers to God,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I know\r\nno one except God who can be so far above your Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur; I speak of the prop of the state, of my only servant, of\r\nmy only friend\xe2\x80\x94of the cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Eminence is not his holiness, sire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by that, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat it is only the Pope who is infallible, and that this\r\ninfallibility does not extend to cardinals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to say that he deceives me; you mean to say that he betrays\r\nme? You accuse him, then? Come, speak; avow freely that you accuse\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sire, but I say that he deceives himself. I say that he is\r\nill-informed. I say that he has hastily accused your Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMusketeers, toward whom he is unjust, and that he has not obtained his\r\ninformation from good sources.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe accusation comes from Monsieur de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille, from the duke\r\nhimself. What do you say to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might answer, sire, that he is too deeply interested in the question\r\nto be a very impartial witness; but so far from that, sire, I know the\r\nduke to be a royal gentleman, and I refer the matter to him\xe2\x80\x94but upon\r\none condition, sire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is that your Majesty will make him come here, will interrogate him\r\nyourself, _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_, without witnesses, and that I shall see your\r\nMajesty as soon as you have seen the duke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, then! You will bind yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the king, \xe2\x80\x9cby what Monsieur\r\nde la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille shall say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will accept his judgment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will submit to the reparation he may require?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa Chesnaye,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king. \xe2\x80\x9cLa Chesnaye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouis XIII.\xe2\x80\x99s confidential valet, who never left the door, entered in\r\nreply to the call.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa Chesnaye,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, \xe2\x80\x9clet someone go instantly and find\r\nMonsieur de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille; I wish to speak with him this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Majesty gives me your word that you will not see anyone between\r\nMonsieur de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille and myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody, by the faith of a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow, then, sire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what o\xe2\x80\x99clock, please your Majesty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any hour you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in coming too early I should be afraid of awakening your Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwaken me! Do you think I ever sleep, then? I sleep no longer,\r\nmonsieur. I sometimes dream, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Come, then, as early as you\r\nlike\xe2\x80\x94at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock; but beware, if you and your Musketeers are\r\nguilty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf my Musketeers are guilty, sire, the guilty shall be placed in your\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s hands, who will dispose of them at your good pleasure. Does\r\nyour Majesty require anything further? Speak, I am ready to obey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur, no; I am not called Louis the Just without reason.\r\nTomorrow, then, monsieur\xe2\x80\x94tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill then, God preserve your Majesty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever ill the king might sleep, M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville slept still worse. He\r\nhad ordered his three Musketeers and their companion to be with him at\r\nhalf past six in the morning. He took them with him, without\r\nencouraging them or promising them anything, and without concealing\r\nfrom them that their luck, and even his own, depended upon the cast of\r\nthe dice.\r\n\r\nArrived at the foot of the back stairs, he desired them to wait. If the\r\nking was still irritated against them, they would depart without being\r\nseen; if the king consented to see them, they would only have to be\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the king\xe2\x80\x99s private antechamber, M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville found La\r\nChesnaye, who informed him that they had not been able to find M. de la\r\nTr\xc3\xa9mouille on the preceding evening at his h\xc3\xb4tel, that he returned too\r\nlate to present himself at the Louvre, that he had only that moment\r\narrived and that he was at that very hour with the king.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance pleased M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville much, as he thus became\r\ncertain that no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between M. de\r\nla Tr\xc3\xa9mouille\xe2\x80\x99s testimony and himself.\r\n\r\nIn fact, ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s closet opened, and M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville saw M. de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille come\r\nout. The duke came straight up to him, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville,\r\nhis Majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the\r\ncircumstances which took place yesterday at my h\xc3\xb4tel. I have told him\r\nthe truth; that is to say, that the fault lay with my people, and that\r\nI was ready to offer you my excuses. Since I have the good fortune to\r\nmeet you, I beg you to receive them, and to hold me always as one of\r\nyour friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur the Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cI was so confident of your\r\nloyalty that I required no other defender before his Majesty than\r\nyourself. I find that I have not been mistaken, and I thank you that\r\nthere is still one man in France of whom may be said, without\r\ndisappointment, what I have said of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s well said,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the king, who had heard all these compliments\r\nthrough the open door; \xe2\x80\x9conly tell him, Tr\xc3\xa9ville, since he wishes to be\r\nconsidered your friend, that I also wish to be one of his, but he\r\nneglects me; that it is nearly three years since I have seen him, and\r\nthat I never do see him unless I send for him. Tell him all this for\r\nme, for these are things which a king cannot say for himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, sire, thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke; \xe2\x80\x9cbut your Majesty may be assured\r\nthat it is not those\xe2\x80\x94I do not speak of Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x94whom your\r\nMajesty sees at all hours of the day that are most devoted to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You have heard what I said? So much the better, Duke, so much the\r\nbetter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, advancing toward the door. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! It is you,\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville. Where are your Musketeers? I told you the day before\r\nyesterday to bring them with you; why have you not done so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are below, sire, and with your permission La Chesnaye will bid\r\nthem come up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, let them come up immediately. It is nearly eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\nand at nine I expect a visit. Go, Monsieur Duke, and return often. Come\r\nin, Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Duke saluted and retired. At the moment he opened the door, the\r\nthree Musketeers and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, conducted by La Chesnaye, appeared at\r\nthe top of the staircase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, my braves,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, \xe2\x80\x9ccome in; I am going to scold\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Musketeers advanced, bowing, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan following closely behind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d continued the king. \xe2\x80\x9cSeven of his Eminence\xe2\x80\x99s Guards\r\nplaced _hors de combat_ by you four in two days! That\xe2\x80\x99s too many,\r\ngentlemen, too many! If you go on so, his Eminence will be forced to\r\nrenew his company in three weeks, and I to put the edicts in force in\r\nall their rigor. One now and then I don\xe2\x80\x99t say much about; but seven in\r\ntwo days, I repeat, it is too many, it is far too many!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, sire, your Majesty sees that they are come, quite contrite\r\nand repentant, to offer you their excuses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite contrite and repentant! Hem!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king. \xe2\x80\x9cI place no\r\nconfidence in their hypocritical faces. In particular, there is one\r\nyonder of a Gascon look. Come hither, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who understood that it was to him this compliment was\r\naddressed, approached, assuming a most deprecating air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you told me he was a young man? This is a boy, Tr\xc3\xa9ville, a mere\r\nboy! Do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust\r\nat Jussac?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd those two equally fine thrusts at Bernajoux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout reckoning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if he had not rescued me from\r\nthe hands of Cahusac, I should not now have the honor of making my very\r\nhumble reverence to your Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy he is a very devil, this B\xc3\xa9arnais! _Ventre-saint-gris_, Monsieur\r\nde Tr\xc3\xa9ville, as the king my father would have said. But at this sort of\r\nwork, many doublets must be slashed and many swords broken. Now,\r\nGascons are always poor, are they not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire, I can assert that they have hitherto discovered no gold mines in\r\ntheir mountains; though the Lord owes them this miracle in recompense\r\nfor the manner in which they supported the pretensions of the king your\r\nfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is to say that the Gascons made a king of me, myself, seeing\r\nthat I am my father\xe2\x80\x99s son, is it not, Tr\xc3\xa9ville? Well, happily, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay nay to it. La Chesnaye, go and see if by rummaging all my pockets\r\nyou can find forty pistoles; and if you can find them, bring them to\r\nme. And now let us see, young man, with your hand upon your conscience,\r\nhow did all this come to pass?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its\r\ndetails; how, not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the\r\nexpectation of seeing his Majesty, he had gone to his three friends\r\nthree hours before the hour of audience; how they had gone together to\r\nthe tennis court, and how, upon the fear he had manifested lest he\r\nreceive a ball in the face, he had been jeered at by Bernajoux, who had\r\nnearly paid for his jeer with his life, and M. de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille, who\r\nhad nothing to do with the matter, with the loss of his h\xc3\xb4tel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all very well,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the king, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, this is just the\r\naccount the duke gave me of the affair. Poor cardinal! Seven men in two\r\ndays, and those of his very best! But that\xe2\x80\x99s quite enough, gentlemen;\r\nplease to understand, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. You have taken your revenge for\r\nthe Rue F\xc3\xa9rou, and even exceeded it; you ought to be satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your Majesty is so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; I am,\xe2\x80\x9d added the king, taking a handful of gold from La\r\nChesnaye, and putting it into the hand of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis a proof of my satisfaction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this epoch, the ideas of pride which are in fashion in our days did\r\nnot prevail. A gentleman received, from hand to hand, money from the\r\nking, and was not the least in the world humiliated. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan put his\r\nforty pistoles into his pocket without any scruple\xe2\x80\x94on the contrary,\r\nthanking his Majesty greatly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, looking at a clock, \xe2\x80\x9cthere, now, as it is half\r\npast eight, you may retire; for as I told you, I expect someone at\r\nnine. Thanks for your devotedness, gentlemen. I may continue to rely\r\nupon it, may I not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sire!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the four companions, with one voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwe would allow\r\nourselves to be cut to pieces in your Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, but keep whole; that will be better, and you will be more\r\nuseful to me. Tr\xc3\xa9ville,\xe2\x80\x9d added the king, in a low voice, as the others\r\nwere retiring, \xe2\x80\x9cas you have no room in the Musketeers, and as we have\r\nbesides decided that a novitiate is necessary before entering that\r\ncorps, place this young man in the company of the Guards of Monsieur\r\nDessessart, your brother-in-law. Ah, _pardieu_, Tr\xc3\xa9ville! I enjoy\r\nbeforehand the face the cardinal will make. He will be furious; but I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care. I am doing what is right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king waved his hand to Tr\xc3\xa9ville, who left him and rejoined the\r\nMusketeers, whom he found sharing the forty pistoles with D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal, as his Majesty had said, was really furious, so furious\r\nthat during eight days he absented himself from the king\xe2\x80\x99s gaming\r\ntable. This did not prevent the king from being as complacent to him as\r\npossible whenever he met him, or from asking in the kindest tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Monsieur Cardinal, how fares it with that poor Jussac and that\r\npoor Bernajoux of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.\r\nTHE INTERIOR OF THE MUSKETEERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was out of the Louvre, and consulted his friends upon\r\nthe use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles, Athos\r\nadvised him to order a good repast at the Pomme-de-Pin, Porthos to\r\nengage a lackey, and Aramis to provide himself with a suitable\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nThe repast was carried into effect that very day, and the lackey waited\r\nat table. The repast had been ordered by Athos, and the lackey\r\nfurnished by Porthos. He was a Picard, whom the glorious Musketeer had\r\npicked up on the Bridge Tournelle, making rings and plashing in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nPorthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and\r\ncontemplative organization, and he had brought him away without any\r\nother recommendation. The noble carriage of this gentleman, for whom he\r\nbelieved himself to be engaged, had won Planchet\xe2\x80\x94that was the name of\r\nthe Picard. He felt a slight disappointment, however, when he saw that\r\nthis place was already taken by a compeer named Mousqueton, and when\r\nPorthos signified to him that the state of his household, though great,\r\nwould not support two servants, and that he must enter into the service\r\nof D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. Nevertheless, when he waited at the dinner given by his\r\nmaster, and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it, he\r\nbelieved his fortune made, and returned thanks to heaven for having\r\nthrown him into the service of such a Cr\xc5\x93sus. He preserved this\r\nopinion even after the feast, with the remnants of which he repaired\r\nhis own long abstinence; but when in the evening he made his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbed, the chimeras of Planchet faded away. The bed was the only one in\r\nthe apartment, which consisted of an antechamber and a bedroom.\r\nPlanchet slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan from that time made shift to do\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nAthos, on his part, had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a\r\nthoroughly peculiar fashion, and who was named Grimaud. He was very\r\ntaciturn, this worthy signor. Be it understood we are speaking of\r\nAthos. During the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest\r\nintimacy with his companions, Porthos and Aramis, they could remember\r\nhaving often seen him smile, but had never heard him laugh. His words\r\nwere brief and expressive, conveying all that was meant, and no more;\r\nno embellishments, no embroidery, no arabesques. His conversation was a\r\nmatter of fact, without a single romance.\r\n\r\nAlthough Athos was scarcely thirty years old, and was of great personal\r\nbeauty and intelligence of mind, no one knew whether he had ever had a\r\nmistress. He never spoke of women. He certainly did not prevent others\r\nfrom speaking of them before him, although it was easy to perceive that\r\nthis kind of conversation, in which he only mingled by bitter words and\r\nmisanthropic remarks, was very disagreeable to him. His reserve, his\r\nroughness, and his silence made almost an old man of him. He had, then,\r\nin order not to disturb his habits, accustomed Grimaud to obey him upon\r\na simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips. He never spoke\r\nto him, except under the most extraordinary occasions.\r\n\r\nSometimes, Grimaud, who feared his master as he did fire, while\r\nentertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration\r\nfor his talents, believed he perfectly understood what he wanted, flew\r\nto execute the order received, and did precisely the contrary. Athos\r\nthen shrugged his shoulders, and, without putting himself in a passion,\r\nthrashed Grimaud. On these days he spoke a little.\r\n\r\nPorthos, as we have seen, had a character exactly opposite to that of\r\nAthos. He not only talked much, but he talked loudly, little caring, we\r\nmust render him that justice, whether anybody listened to him or not.\r\nHe talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing\r\nhimself talk. He spoke upon all subjects except the sciences, alleging\r\nin this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his\r\nchildhood. He had not so noble an air as Athos, and the commencement of\r\ntheir intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman, whom he\r\nendeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress. But with his simple\r\nMusketeer\xe2\x80\x99s uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back\r\nhis head and advanced his foot, Athos instantly took the place which\r\nwas his due and consigned the ostentatious Porthos to the second rank.\r\nPorthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\r\nand the guardroom of the Louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes,\r\nafter having passed from professional ladies to military ladies, from\r\nthe lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s dame to the baroness, there was question of nothing less\r\nwith Porthos than a foreign princess, who was enormously fond of him.\r\n\r\nAn old proverb says, \xe2\x80\x9cLike master, like man.\xe2\x80\x9d Let us pass, then, from\r\nthe valet of Athos to the valet of Porthos, from Grimaud to Mousqueton.\r\n\r\nMousqueton was a Norman, whose pacific name of Boniface his master had\r\nchanged into the infinitely more sonorous name of Mousqueton. He had\r\nentered the service of Porthos upon condition that he should only be\r\nclothed and lodged, though in a handsome manner; but he claimed two\r\nhours a day to himself, consecrated to an employment which would\r\nprovide for his other wants. Porthos agreed to the bargain; the thing\r\nsuited him wonderfully well. He had doublets cut out of his old clothes\r\nand cast-off cloaks for Mousqueton, and thanks to a very intelligent\r\ntailor, who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them, and\r\nwhose wife was suspected of wishing to make Porthos descend from his\r\naristocratic habits, Mousqueton made a very good figure when attending\r\non his master.\r\n\r\nAs for Aramis, of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the\r\ncharacter\xe2\x80\x94a character which, like that of his companions, we shall be\r\nable to follow in its development\xe2\x80\x94his lackey was called Bazin. Thanks\r\nto the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering into\r\norders, he was always clothed in black, as became the servant of a\r\nchurchman. He was a Berrichon, thirty-five or forty years old, mild,\r\npeaceable, sleek, employing the leisure his master left him in the\r\nperusal of pious works, providing rigorously for two a dinner of few\r\ndishes, but excellent. For the rest, he was dumb, blind, and deaf, and\r\nof unimpeachable fidelity.\r\n\r\nAnd now that we are acquainted, superficially at least, with the\r\nmasters and the valets, let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by\r\neach of them.\r\n\r\nAthos dwelt in the Rue F\xc3\xa9rou, within two steps of the Luxembourg. His\r\napartment consisted of two small chambers, very nicely fitted up, in a\r\nfurnished house, the hostess of which, still young and still really\r\nhandsome, cast tender glances uselessly at him. Some fragments of past\r\nsplendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging;\r\na sword, for example, richly embossed, which belonged by its make to\r\nthe times of Francis I, the hilt of which alone, encrusted with\r\nprecious stones, might be worth two hundred pistoles, and which,\r\nnevertheless, in his moments of greatest distress Athos had never\r\npledged or offered for sale. It had long been an object of ambition for\r\nPorthos. Porthos would have given ten years of his life to possess this\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nOne day, when he had an appointment with a duchess, he endeavored even\r\nto borrow it of Athos. Athos, without saying anything, emptied his\r\npockets, got together all his jewels, purses, aiguillettes, and gold\r\nchains, and offered them all to Porthos; but as to the sword, he said\r\nit was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master\r\nshould himself quit his lodgings. In addition to the sword, there was a\r\nportrait representing a nobleman of the time of Henry III., dressed with\r\nthe greatest elegance, and who wore the Order of the Holy Ghost; and\r\nthis portrait had certain resemblances of lines with Athos, certain\r\nfamily likenesses which indicated that this great noble, a knight of\r\nthe Order of the King, was his ancestor.\r\n\r\nBesides these, a casket of magnificent goldwork, with the same arms as\r\nthe sword and the portrait, formed a middle ornament to the\r\nmantelpiece, and assorted badly with the rest of the furniture. Athos\r\nalways carried the key of this coffer about him; but he one day opened\r\nit before Porthos, and Porthos was convinced that this coffer contained\r\nnothing but letters and papers\xe2\x80\x94love letters and family papers, no\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nPorthos lived in an apartment, large in size and of very sumptuous\r\nappearance, in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier. Every time he passed with a\r\nfriend before his windows, at one of which Mousqueton was sure to be\r\nplaced in full livery, Porthos raised his head and his hand, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my abode!\xe2\x80\x9d But he was never to be found at home; he never\r\ninvited anybody to go up with him, and no one could form an idea of\r\nwhat his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches.\r\n\r\nAs to Aramis, he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir, an\r\neating room, and a bedroom, which room, situated, as the others were,\r\non the ground floor, looked out upon a little fresh green garden, shady\r\nand impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors.\r\n\r\nWith regard to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, we know how he was lodged, and we have\r\nalready made acquaintance with his lackey, Master Planchet.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who was by nature very curious\xe2\x80\x94as people generally are who\r\npossess the genius of intrigue\xe2\x80\x94did all he could to make out who Athos,\r\nPorthos, and Aramis really were (for under these pseudonyms each of\r\nthese young men concealed his family name)\xe2\x80\x94Athos in particular, who, a\r\nleague away, savored of nobility. He addressed himself then to Porthos\r\nto gain information respecting Athos and Aramis, and to Aramis in order\r\nto learn something of Porthos.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion\r\nbut what revealed itself. It was said Athos had met with great crosses\r\nin love, and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life\r\nof this gallant man. What could this treachery be? All the world was\r\nignorant of it.\r\n\r\nAs to Porthos, except his real name (as was the case with those of his\r\ntwo comrades), his life was very easily known. Vain and indiscreet, it\r\nwas as easy to see through him as through a crystal. The only thing to\r\nmislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things\r\nhe said of himself.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Aramis, though having the air of having nothing secret\r\nabout him, he was a young fellow made up of mysteries, answering little\r\nto questions put to him about others, and having learned from him the\r\nreport which prevailed concerning the success of the Musketeer with a\r\nprincess, wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures\r\nof his interlocutor. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, my dear companion,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou speak\r\nof the baronesses, countesses, and princesses of others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pardieu!_ I spoke of them because Porthos talked of them himself,\r\nbecause he had paraded all these fine things before me. But be assured,\r\nmy dear Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, that if I had obtained them from any other\r\nsource, or if they had been confided to me, there exists no confessor\r\nmore discreet than myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it seems to me that\r\nyou are tolerably familiar with coats of arms\xe2\x80\x94a certain embroidered\r\nhandkerchief, for instance, to which I owe the honor of your\r\nacquaintance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time Aramis was not angry, but assumed the most modest air and\r\nreplied in a friendly tone, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend, do not forget that I wish\r\nto belong to the Church, and that I avoid all mundane opportunities.\r\nThe handkerchief you saw had not been given to me, but it had been\r\nforgotten and left at my house by one of my friends. I was obliged to\r\npick it up in order not to compromise him and the lady he loves. As for\r\nmyself, I neither have, nor desire to have, a mistress, following in\r\nthat respect the very judicious example of Athos, who has none any more\r\nthan I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what the devil! You are not a priest, you are a Musketeer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Musketeer for a time, my friend, as the cardinal says, a Musketeer\r\nagainst my will, but a churchman at heart, believe me. Athos and\r\nPorthos dragged me into this to occupy me. I had, at the moment of\r\nbeing ordained, a little difficulty with\xe2\x80\x94But that would not interest\r\nyou, and I am taking up your valuable time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all; it interests me very much,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cand at this\r\nmoment I have absolutely nothing to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I have my breviary to repeat,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Aramis; \xe2\x80\x9cthen some\r\nverses to compose, which Madame d\xe2\x80\x99Aiguillon begged of me. Then I must\r\ngo to the Rue St. Honor\xc3\xa9 in order to purchase some rouge for Madame de\r\nChevreuse. So you see, my dear friend, that if you are not in a hurry,\r\nI am very much in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion,\r\nand took leave of him.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the pains he took, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was unable to learn\r\nany more concerning his three new-made friends. He formed, therefore,\r\nthe resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their\r\npast, hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future.\r\nIn the meanwhile, he looked upon Athos as an Achilles, Porthos as an\r\nAjax, and Aramis as a Joseph.\r\n\r\nAs to the rest, the life of the four young friends was joyous enough.\r\nAthos played, and that as a rule unfortunately. Nevertheless, he never\r\nborrowed a sou of his companions, although his purse was ever at their\r\nservice; and when he had played upon honor, he always awakened his\r\ncreditor by six o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning to pay the debt of the\r\npreceding evening.\r\n\r\nPorthos had his fits. On the days when he won he was insolent and\r\nostentatious; if he lost, he disappeared completely for several days,\r\nafter which he reappeared with a pale face and thinner person, but with\r\nmoney in his purse.\r\n\r\nAs to Aramis, he never played. He was the worst Musketeer and the most\r\nunconvivial companion imaginable. He had always something or other to\r\ndo. Sometimes in the midst of dinner, when everyone, under the\r\nattraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation, believed they had\r\ntwo or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table, Aramis looked\r\nat his watch, arose with a bland smile, and took leave of the company,\r\nto go, as he said, to consult a casuist with whom he had an\r\nappointment. At other times he would return home to write a treatise,\r\nand requested his friends not to disturb him.\r\n\r\nAt this Athos would smile, with his charming, melancholy smile, which\r\nso became his noble countenance, and Porthos would drink, swearing that\r\nAramis would never be anything but a village _cur\xc3\xa9_.\r\n\r\nPlanchet, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s valet, supported his good fortune nobly. He\r\nreceived thirty sous per day, and for a month he returned to his\r\nlodgings gay as a chaffinch, and affable toward his master. When the\r\nwind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the Rue des\r\nFossoyeurs\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, when the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII.\r\nwere consumed or nearly so\xe2\x80\x94he commenced complaints which Athos thought\r\nnauseous, Porthos indecent, and Aramis ridiculous. Athos counseled\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to dismiss the fellow; Porthos was of the opinion that he\r\nshould give him a good thrashing first; and Aramis contended that a\r\nmaster should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all very easy for you to say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cfor you,\r\nAthos, who live like a dumb man with Grimaud, who forbid him to speak,\r\nand consequently never exchange ill words with him; for you, Porthos,\r\nwho carry matters in such a magnificent style, and are a god to your\r\nvalet, Mousqueton; and for you, Aramis, who, always abstracted by your\r\ntheological studies, inspire your servant, Bazin, a mild, religious\r\nman, with a profound respect; but for me, who am without any settled\r\nmeans and without resources\xe2\x80\x94for me, who am neither a Musketeer nor even\r\na Guardsman, what am I to do to inspire either the affection, the\r\nterror, or the respect in Planchet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is serious,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the three friends; \xe2\x80\x9cit is a family affair.\r\nIt is with valets as with wives, they must be placed at once upon the\r\nfooting in which you wish them to remain. Reflect upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan did reflect, and resolved to thrash Planchet provisionally;\r\nwhich he did with the conscientiousness that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan carried into\r\neverything. After having well beaten him, he forbade him to leave his\r\nservice without his permission. \xe2\x80\x9cFor,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe future cannot\r\nfail to mend; I inevitably look for better times. Your fortune is\r\ntherefore made if you remain with me, and I am too good a master to\r\nallow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you\r\nrequire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis manner of acting roused much respect for D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s policy among\r\nthe Musketeers. Planchet was equally seized with admiration, and said\r\nno more about going away.\r\n\r\nThe life of the four young men had become fraternal. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who\r\nhad no settled habits of his own, as he came from his province into the\r\nmidst of a world quite new to him, fell easily into the habits of his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThey rose about eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the winter, about six in summer, and\r\nwent to take the countersign and see how things went on at M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, although he was not a Musketeer, performed the\r\nduty of one with remarkable punctuality. He went on guard because he\r\nalways kept company with whoever of his friends was on duty. He was\r\nwell known at the H\xc3\xb4tel of the Musketeers, where everyone considered\r\nhim a good comrade. M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, who had appreciated him at the\r\nfirst glance and who bore him a real affection, never ceased\r\nrecommending him to the king.\r\n\r\nOn their side, the three Musketeers were much attached to their young\r\ncomrade. The friendship which united these four men, and the need they\r\nfelt of seeing another three or four times a day, whether for dueling,\r\nbusiness, or pleasure, caused them to be continually running after one\r\nanother like shadows; and the Inseparables were constantly to be met\r\nwith seeking one another, from the Luxembourg to the Place St. Sulpice,\r\nor from the Rue du Vieux-Colombier to the Luxembourg.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the promises of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville went on prosperously.\r\nOne fine morning the king commanded M. de Chevalier Dessessart to admit\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan as a cadet in his company of Guards. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with a\r\nsigh, donned his uniform, which he would have exchanged for that of a\r\nMusketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence. But M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years\xe2\x80\x94a novitiate\r\nwhich might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself\r\nfor D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to render the king any signal service, or to distinguish\r\nhimself by some brilliant action. Upon this promise D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nwithdrew, and the next day he began service.\r\n\r\nThen it became the turn of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis to mount guard\r\nwith D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan when he was on duty. The company of M. le Chevalier\r\nDessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII.\r\nCONCERNING A COURT INTRIGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII., like all other\r\nthings of this world, after having had a beginning had an end, and\r\nafter this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed. At\r\nfirst, Athos supported the association for a time with his own means.\r\n\r\nPorthos succeeded him; and thanks to one of those disappearances to\r\nwhich he was accustomed, he was able to provide for the wants of all\r\nfor a fortnight. At last it became Aramis\xe2\x80\x99s turn, who performed it with\r\na good grace and who succeeded\xe2\x80\x94as he said, by selling some theological\r\nbooks\xe2\x80\x94in procuring a few pistoles.\r\n\r\nThen, as they had been accustomed to do, they had recourse to M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville, who made some advances on their pay; but these advances could\r\nnot go far with three Musketeers who were already much in arrears and a\r\nGuardsman who as yet had no pay at all.\r\n\r\nAt length when they found they were likely to be really in want, they\r\ngot together, as a last effort, eight or ten pistoles, with which\r\nPorthos went to the gaming table. Unfortunately he was in a bad vein;\r\nhe lost all, together with twenty-five pistoles for which he had given\r\nhis word.\r\n\r\nThen the inconvenience became distress. The hungry friends, followed by\r\ntheir lackeys, were seen haunting the quays and Guard rooms, picking up\r\namong their friends abroad all the dinners they could meet with; for\r\naccording to the advice of Aramis, it was prudent to sow repasts right\r\nand left in prosperity, in order to reap a few in time of need.\r\n\r\nAthos was invited four times, and each time took his friends and their\r\nlackeys with him. Porthos had six occasions, and contrived in the same\r\nmanner that his friends should partake of them; Aramis had eight of\r\nthem. He was a man, as must have been already perceived, who made but\r\nlittle noise, and yet was much sought after.\r\n\r\nAs to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who as yet knew nobody in the capital, he only found\r\none chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province,\r\nand one dinner at the house of a cornet of the Guards. He took his army\r\nto the priest\xe2\x80\x99s, where they devoured as much provision as would have\r\nlasted him for two months, and to the cornet\xe2\x80\x99s, who performed wonders;\r\nbut as Planchet said, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople do not eat at once for all time, even\r\nwhen they eat a good deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one\r\nmeal and a half for his companions\xe2\x80\x94as the breakfast at the priest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncould only be counted as half a repast\xe2\x80\x94in return for the feasts which\r\nAthos, Porthos, and Aramis had procured him. He fancied himself a\r\nburden to the society, forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith\r\nthat he had fed this society for a month; and he set his mind actively\r\nto work. He reflected that this coalition of four young, brave,\r\nenterprising, and active men ought to have some other object than\r\nswaggering walks, fencing lessons, and practical jokes, more or less\r\nwitty.\r\n\r\nIn fact, four men such as they were\xe2\x80\x94four men devoted to one another,\r\nfrom their purses to their lives; four men always supporting one\r\nanother, never yielding, executing singly or together the resolutions\r\nformed in common; four arms threatening the four cardinal points, or\r\nturning toward a single point\xe2\x80\x94must inevitably, either subterraneously,\r\nin open day, by mining, in the trench, by cunning, or by force, open\r\nthemselves a way toward the object they wished to attain, however well\r\nit might be defended, or however distant it may seem. The only thing\r\nthat astonished D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was that his friends had never thought of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nHe was thinking by himself, and even seriously racking his brain to\r\nfind a direction for this single force four times multiplied, with\r\nwhich he did not doubt, as with the lever for which Archimedes sought,\r\nthey should succeed in moving the world, when someone tapped gently at\r\nhis door. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan awakened Planchet and ordered him to open it.\r\n\r\nFrom this phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan awakened Planchet,\xe2\x80\x9d the reader must not\r\nsuppose it was night, or that day was hardly come. No, it had just\r\nstruck four. Planchet, two hours before, had asked his master for some\r\ndinner, and he had answered him with the proverb, \xe2\x80\x9cHe who sleeps,\r\ndines.\xe2\x80\x9d And Planchet dined by sleeping.\r\n\r\nA man was introduced of simple mien, who had the appearance of a\r\ntradesman. Planchet, by way of dessert, would have liked to hear the\r\nconversation; but the citizen declared to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan that, what he had\r\nto say being important and confidential, he desired to be left alone\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan dismissed Planchet, and requested his visitor to be seated.\r\nThere was a moment of silence, during which the two men looked at each\r\nother, as if to make a preliminary acquaintance, after which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nbowed, as a sign that he listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan spoken of as a very brave young man,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the citizen; \xe2\x80\x9cand this reputation which he justly enjoys had\r\ndecided me to confide a secret to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, monsieur, speak,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who instinctively scented\r\nsomething advantageous.\r\n\r\nThe citizen made a fresh pause and continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a wife who is\r\nseamstress to the queen, monsieur, and who is not deficient in either\r\nvirtue or beauty. I was induced to marry her about three years ago,\r\nalthough she had but very little dowry, because Monsieur Laporte, the\r\nqueen\xe2\x80\x99s cloak bearer, is her godfather, and befriends her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the citizen, \xe2\x80\x9cwell, monsieur, my wife was abducted\r\nyesterday morning, as she was coming out of her workroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd by whom was your wife abducted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing surely, monsieur, but I suspect someone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is the person whom you suspect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man who has pursued her a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut allow me to tell you, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the citizen, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am\r\nconvinced that there is less love than politics in all this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLess love than politics,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with a reflective air;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand what do you suspect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know whether I ought to tell you what I suspect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, I beg you to observe that I ask you absolutely nothing. It\r\nis you who have come to me. It is you who have told me that you had a\r\nsecret to confide in me. Act, then, as you think proper; there is still\r\ntime to withdraw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur, no; you appear to be an honest young man, and I will\r\nhave confidence in you. I believe, then, that it is not on account of\r\nany intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested, but because of\r\nthose of a lady much greater than herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah! Can it be on account of the amours of Madame de Bois-Tracy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, wishing to have the air, in the eyes of the citizen,\r\nof being posted as to court affairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigher, monsieur, higher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf Madame d\xe2\x80\x99Aiguillon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill higher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf Madame de Chevreuse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigher, much higher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan checked himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the terrified citizen, in a tone so low that\r\nhe was scarcely audible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd with whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith whom can it be, if not the Duke of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Duke of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the citizen, giving a still fainter intonation\r\nto his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how do you know all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, how do you know it? No half-confidence, or\xe2\x80\x94you understand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it from my wife, monsieur\xe2\x80\x94from my wife herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho learns it from whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Monsieur Laporte. Did I not tell you that she was the goddaughter\r\nof Monsieur Laporte, the confidential man of the queen? Well, Monsieur\r\nLaporte placed her near her Majesty in order that our poor queen might\r\nat least have someone in whom she could place confidence, abandoned as\r\nshe is by the king, watched as she is by the cardinal, betrayed as she\r\nis by everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah! It begins to develop itself,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my wife came home four days ago, monsieur. One of her conditions\r\nwas that she should come and see me twice a week; for, as I had the\r\nhonor to tell you, my wife loves me dearly\xe2\x80\x94my wife, then, came and\r\nconfided to me that the queen at that very moment entertained great\r\nfears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The cardinal, as it appears, pursues her and persecutes her more\r\nthan ever. He cannot pardon her the history of the Saraband. You know\r\nthe history of the Saraband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pardieu!_ Know it!\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who knew nothing about it,\r\nbut who wished to appear to know everything that was going on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that now it is no longer hatred, but vengeance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the queen believes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what does the queen believe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe believes that someone has written to the Duke of Buckingham in her\r\nname.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the queen\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to make him come to Paris; and when once come to Paris, to draw\r\nhim into some snare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil! But your wife, monsieur, what has she to do with all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer devotion to the queen is known; and they wish either to remove her\r\nfrom her mistress, or to intimidate her, in order to obtain her\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s secrets, or to seduce her and make use of her as a spy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the man who has abducted her\xe2\x80\x94do\r\nyou know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you that I believe I know him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know that; what I do know is that he is a creature of the\r\ncardinal, his evil genius.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have seen him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my wife pointed him out to me one day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly; he is a noble of very lofty carriage, black hair,\r\nswarthy complexion, piercing eye, white teeth, and has a scar on his\r\ntemple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA scar on his temple!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cand with that, white teeth,\r\na piercing eye, dark complexion, black hair, and haughty carriage\xe2\x80\x94why,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s my man of Meung.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is your man, do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; but that has nothing to do with it. No, I am wrong. On the\r\ncontrary, that simplifies the matter greatly. If your man is mine, with\r\none blow I shall obtain two revenges, that\xe2\x80\x99s all; but where to find\r\nthis man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you no information as to his abiding place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone. One day, as I was conveying my wife back to the Louvre, he was\r\ncoming out as she was going in, and she showed him to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil! The devil!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9call this is vague enough.\r\nFrom whom have you learned of the abduction of your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Monsieur Laporte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he give you any details?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knew none himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have learned nothing from any other quarter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have received\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear I am committing a great imprudence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always come back to that; but I must make you see this time that\r\nit is too late to retreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not retreat, _mordieu!_\xe2\x80\x9d cried the citizen, swearing in order to\r\nrouse his courage. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, by the faith of Bonacieux\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou call yourself Bonacieux?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is my name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said, then, by the word of Bonacieux. Pardon me for interrupting\r\nyou, but it appears to me that that name is familiar to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly, monsieur. I am your landlord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, half rising and bowing; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are my\r\nlandlord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur, yes. And as it is three months since you have been\r\nhere, and though, distracted as you must be in your important\r\noccupations, you have forgotten to pay me my rent\xe2\x80\x94as, I say, I have not\r\ntormented you a single instant, I thought you would appreciate my\r\ndelicacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can it be otherwise, my dear Bonacieux?\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctrust me, I am fully grateful for such unparalleled conduct, and if,\r\nas I told you, I can be of any service to you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you, monsieur, I believe you; and as I was about to say, by\r\nthe word of Bonacieux, I have confidence in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinish, then, what you were about to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe citizen took a paper from his pocket, and presented it to\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA letter?\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich I received this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan opened it, and as the day was beginning to decline, he\r\napproached the window to read it. The citizen followed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Do not seek your wife,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d read D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98she will be restored to\r\nyou when there is no longer occasion for her. If you make a single step\r\nto find her you are lost.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s pretty positive,\xe2\x80\x9d continued D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut after all, it is\r\nbut a menace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but that menace terrifies me. I am not a fighting man at all,\r\nmonsieur, and I am afraid of the Bastille.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHum!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no greater regard for the Bastille than\r\nyou. If it were nothing but a sword thrust, why then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have counted upon you on this occasion, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeing you constantly surrounded by Musketeers of a very superb\r\nappearance, and knowing that these Musketeers belong to Monsieur de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville, and were consequently enemies of the cardinal, I thought that\r\nyou and your friends, while rendering justice to your poor queen, would\r\nbe pleased to play his Eminence an ill turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then I have thought that considering three months\xe2\x80\x99 lodging, about\r\nwhich I have said nothing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; you have already given me that reason, and I find it\r\nexcellent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReckoning still further, that as long as you do me the honor to remain\r\nin my house I shall never speak to you about rent\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery kind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd adding to this, if there be need of it, meaning to offer you fifty\r\npistoles, if, against all probability, you should be short at the\r\npresent moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmirable! You are rich then, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am comfortably off, monsieur, that\xe2\x80\x99s all; I have scraped together\r\nsome such things as an income of two or three thousand crowns in the\r\nhaberdashery business, but more particularly in venturing some funds in\r\nthe last voyage of the celebrated navigator Jean Moquet; so that you\r\nunderstand, monsieur\xe2\x80\x94But!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d cried the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d demanded D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom do I see yonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the street, facing your window, in the embrasure of that door\xe2\x80\x94a man\r\nwrapped in a cloak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is he!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and the citizen at the same time, each\r\nhaving recognized his man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, this time,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, springing to his sword, \xe2\x80\x9cthis time\r\nhe will not escape me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDrawing his sword from its scabbard, he rushed out of the apartment. On\r\nthe staircase he met Athos and Porthos, who were coming to see him.\r\nThey separated, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan rushed between them like a dart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPah! Where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the two Musketeers in a breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man of Meung!\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with\r\nthe stranger, as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner, to\r\nwhom this man had confided some important missive.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of Athos was that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had lost his letter in the\r\nskirmish. A gentleman, in his opinion\xe2\x80\x94and according to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nportrait of him, the stranger must be a gentleman\xe2\x80\x94would be incapable of\r\nthe baseness of stealing a letter.\r\n\r\nPorthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting, given by a lady to\r\na cavalier, or by a cavalier to a lady, which had been disturbed by the\r\npresence of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and his yellow horse.\r\n\r\nAramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious, it was\r\nbetter not to fathom them.\r\n\r\nThey understood, then, from the few words which escaped from\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, what affair was in hand, and as they thought that\r\novertaking his man, or losing sight of him, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan would return to\r\nhis rooms, they kept on their way.\r\n\r\nWhen they entered D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s chamber, it was empty; the landlord,\r\ndreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to\r\ntake place between the young man and the stranger, had, consistent with\r\nthe character he had given himself, judged it prudent to decamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99ARTAGNAN SHOWS HIMSELF\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Athos and Porthos had foreseen, at the expiration of a half hour,\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan returned. He had again missed his man, who had disappeared\r\nas if by enchantment. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had run, sword in hand, through all\r\nthe neighboring streets, but had found nobody resembling the man he\r\nsought for. Then he came back to the point where, perhaps, he ought to\r\nhave begun, and that was to knock at the door against which the\r\nstranger had leaned; but this proved useless\xe2\x80\x94for though he knocked ten\r\nor twelve times in succession, no one answered, and some of the\r\nneighbors, who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to\r\ntheir doors by the noise, had assured him that that house, all the\r\nopenings of which were tightly closed, had not been inhabited for six\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nWhile D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors,\r\nAramis had joined his companions; so that on returning home D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nfound the reunion complete.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the three Musketeers all together, on seeing D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nenter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset\r\nwith anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, throwing his sword upon the bed, \xe2\x80\x9cthis man must be\r\nthe devil in person; he has disappeared like a phantom, like a shade,\r\nlike a specter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe in apparitions?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Athos of Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never believe in anything I have not seen, and as I never have seen\r\napparitions, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Bible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cmakes our belief in them a law; the ghost of\r\nSamuel appeared to Saul, and it is an article of faith that I should be\r\nvery sorry to see any doubt thrown upon, Porthos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt all events, man or devil, body or shadow, illusion or reality, this\r\nman is born for my damnation; for his flight has caused us to miss a\r\nglorious affair, gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94an affair by which there were a hundred\r\npistoles, and perhaps more, to be gained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is that?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos and Aramis in a breath.\r\n\r\nAs to Athos, faithful to his system of reticence, he contented himself\r\nwith interrogating D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan by a look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlanchet,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to his domestic, who just then insinuated\r\nhis head through the half-open door in order to catch some fragments of\r\nthe conversation, \xe2\x80\x9cgo down to my landlord, Monsieur Bonacieux, and ask\r\nhim to send me half a dozen bottles of Beaugency wine; I prefer that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah! You have credit with your landlord, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom this very day; and mind, if the wine\r\nis bad, we will send him to find better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must use, and not abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, sententiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always said that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had the longest head of the four,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAthos, who, having uttered his opinion, to which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan replied\r\nwith a bow, immediately resumed his accustomed silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut come, what is this about?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cimpart it to us, my dear friend, unless the honor\r\nof any lady be hazarded by this confidence; in that case you would do\r\nbetter to keep it to yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cthe honor of no one will have\r\ncause to complain of what I have to tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then related to his friends, word for word, all that had passed\r\nbetween him and his host, and how the man who had abducted the wife of\r\nhis worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at\r\nthe hostelry of the Jolly Miller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour affair is not bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, after having tasted like a\r\nconnoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine\r\ngood; \xe2\x80\x9cand one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man.\r\nThen there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty\r\npistoles are worth the risk of four heads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut observe,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is a woman in the affair\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nwoman carried off, a woman who is doubtless threatened, tortured\r\nperhaps, and all because she is faithful to her mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeware, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, beware,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis. \xe2\x80\x9cYou grow a little too warm,\r\nin my opinion, about the fate of Madame Bonacieux. Woman was created\r\nfor our destruction, and it is from her we inherit all our miseries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this speech of Aramis, the brow of Athos became clouded and he bit\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not Madame Bonacieux about whom I am anxious,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut the queen, whom the king abandons, whom the cardinal persecutes,\r\nand who sees the heads of all her friends fall, one after the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does she love what we hate most in the world, the Spaniards and\r\nthe English?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpain is her country,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cand it is very natural\r\nthat she should love the Spanish, who are the children of the same soil\r\nas herself. As to the second reproach, I have heard it said that she\r\ndoes not love the English, but an Englishman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and by my faith,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cit must be acknowledged that this\r\nEnglishman is worthy of being loved. I never saw a man with a nobler\r\nair than his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout reckoning that he dresses as nobody else can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was at the Louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls; and,\r\n_pardieu_, I picked up two that I sold for ten pistoles each. Do you\r\nknow him, Aramis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs well as you do, gentlemen; for I was among those who seized him in\r\nthe garden at Amiens, into which Monsieur Putange, the queen\xe2\x80\x99s equerry,\r\nintroduced me. I was at school at the time, and the adventure appeared\r\nto me to be cruel for the king.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich would not prevent me,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cif I knew where the\r\nDuke of Buckingham was, from taking him by the hand and conducting him\r\nto the queen, were it only to enrage the cardinal, and if we could find\r\nmeans to play him a sharp turn, I vow that I would voluntarily risk my\r\nhead in doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did the mercer*,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Athos, \xe2\x80\x9ctell you, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, that the\r\nqueen thought that Buckingham had been brought over by a forged\r\nletter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* Haberdasher\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is afraid so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, while I endeavor to recall circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now I am convinced,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this abduction of the\r\nqueen\xe2\x80\x99s woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking,\r\nand perhaps with the presence of Buckingham in Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Gascon is full of ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, with admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like to hear him talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9chis dialect amuses me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9clisten to this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to Aramis,\xe2\x80\x9d said his three friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday I was at the house of a doctor of theology, whom I sometimes\r\nconsult about my studies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe resides in a quiet quarter,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Aramis; \xe2\x80\x9chis tastes and his\r\nprofession require it. Now, at the moment when I left his house\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Aramis paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d cried his auditors; \xe2\x80\x9cat the moment you left his house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis appeared to make a strong inward effort, like a man who, in the\r\nfull relation of a falsehood, finds himself stopped by some unforeseen\r\nobstacle; but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him,\r\ntheir ears were wide open, and there were no means of retreat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis doctor has a niece,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, he has a niece!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very respectable lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\nThe three friends burst into laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, if you laugh, if you doubt me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall know\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe believe like Mohammedans, and are as mute as tombstones,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will continue, then,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Aramis. \xe2\x80\x9cThis niece comes sometimes to\r\nsee her uncle; and by chance was there yesterday at the same time that\r\nI was, and it was my duty to offer to conduct her to her carriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! She has a carriage, then, this niece of the doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted\r\nPorthos, one of whose faults was a great looseness of tongue. \xe2\x80\x9cA nice\r\nacquaintance, my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPorthos,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cI have had the occasion to observe to you\r\nmore than once that you are very indiscreet; and that is injurious to\r\nyou among the women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who began to get a glimpse of\r\nthe result of the adventure, \xe2\x80\x9cthe thing is serious. Let us try not to\r\njest, if we can. Go on Aramis, go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll at once, a tall, dark gentleman\xe2\x80\x94just like yours, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9ccame toward me, accompanied by five or\r\nsix men who followed about ten paces behind him; and in the politest\r\ntone, \xe2\x80\x98Monsieur Duke,\xe2\x80\x99 said he to me, \xe2\x80\x98and you madame,\xe2\x80\x99 continued he,\r\naddressing the lady on my arm\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s niece?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, Porthos,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are insupportable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x94will you enter this carriage, and that without offering the least\r\nresistance, without making the least noise?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe took you for Buckingham!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the lady?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe took her for the queen!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Gascon is the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cnothing escapes him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cAramis is of the same height, and\r\nsomething of the shape of the duke; but it nevertheless appears to me\r\nthat the dress of a Musketeer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wore an enormous cloak,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the month of July? The devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cIs the doctor afraid\r\nthat you may be recognized?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can comprehend that the spy may have been deceived by the person;\r\nbut the face\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a large hat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, good lord,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat precautions for the study of\r\ntheology!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not let us lose our time\r\nin jesting. Let us separate, and let us seek the mercer\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x94that is\r\nthe key of the intrigue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman of such inferior condition! Can you believe so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos,\r\nprotruding his lips with contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is goddaughter to Laporte, the confidential valet of the queen.\r\nHave I not told you so, gentlemen? Besides, it has perhaps been her\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly.\r\nHigh heads expose themselves from afar, and the cardinal is\r\nlongsighted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cin the first place make a bargain with the\r\nmercer, and a good bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s useless,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I believe if he does not pay\r\nus, we shall be well enough paid by another party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs;\r\nthe door was thrown violently open, and the unfortunate mercer rushed\r\ninto the chamber in which the council was held.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSave me, gentlemen, for the love of heaven, save me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nare four men come to arrest me. Save me! Save me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos and Aramis arose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA moment,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, making them a sign to replace in the\r\nscabbard their half-drawn swords. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not courage that is needed; it\r\nis prudence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will not leave\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will leave D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to act as he thinks proper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nhas, I repeat, the longest head of the four, and for my part I declare\r\nthat I will obey him. Do as you think best, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the four Guards appeared at the door of the antechamber,\r\nbut seeing four Musketeers standing, and their swords by their sides,\r\nthey hesitated about going farther.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, gentlemen, come in,\xe2\x80\x9d called D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are here in my\r\napartment, and we are all faithful servants of the king and cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, gentlemen, you will not oppose our executing the orders we have\r\nreceived?\xe2\x80\x9d asked one who appeared to be the leader of the party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, gentlemen, we would assist you if it were necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he say?\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a simpleton,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you promised me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the poor mercer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can only save you by being free ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in\r\na rapid, low tone; \xe2\x80\x9cand if we appear inclined to defend you, they will\r\narrest us with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems, nevertheless\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, gentlemen, come!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, aloud; \xe2\x80\x9cI have no motive for\r\ndefending Monsieur. I saw him today for the first time, and he can tell\r\nyou on what occasion; he came to demand the rent of my lodging. Is that\r\nnot true, Monsieur Bonacieux? Answer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the very truth,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the mercer; \xe2\x80\x9cbut Monsieur does not tell\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence, with respect to me, silence, with respect to my friends;\r\nsilence about the queen, above all, or you will ruin everybody without\r\nsaving yourself! Come, come, gentlemen, remove the fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan pushed the half-stupefied mercer among the Guards, saying to\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a shabby old fellow, my dear. You come to demand money of\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94of a Musketeer! To prison with him! Gentlemen, once more, take him\r\nto prison, and keep him under key as long as possible; that will give\r\nme time to pay him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officers were full of thanks, and took away their prey. As they\r\nwere going down D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan laid his hand on the shoulder of their\r\nleader.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I not drink to your health, and you to mine?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\nfilling two glasses with the Beaugency wine which he had obtained from\r\nthe liberality of M. Bonacieux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do me great honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the leader of the posse, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\naccept thankfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen to yours, monsieur\xe2\x80\x94what is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoisrenard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Boisrenard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo yours, my gentlemen! What is your name, in your turn, if you\r\nplease?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo yours, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd above all others,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, as if carried away by his\r\nenthusiasm, \xe2\x80\x9cto that of the king and the cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan if the wine had been bad; but the wine was good, and he was\r\nconvinced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat diabolical villainy you have performed here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, when\r\nthe officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found\r\nthemselves alone. \xe2\x80\x9cShame, shame, for four Musketeers to allow an\r\nunfortunate fellow who cried for help to be arrested in their midst!\r\nAnd a gentleman to hobnob with a bailiff!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPorthos,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cAthos has already told you that you are a\r\nsimpleton, and I am quite of his opinion. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, you are a great\r\nman; and when you occupy Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s place, I will come and\r\nask your influence to secure me an abbey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am in a maze,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cdo _you_ approve of what\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan has done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Parbleu!_ Indeed I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cI not only approve of what he\r\nhas done, but I congratulate him upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, without stopping to explain his\r\nconduct to Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cAll for one, one for all\xe2\x80\x94that is our motto, is it\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold out your hand and swear!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos and Aramis at once.\r\n\r\nOvercome by example, grumbling to himself, nevertheless, Porthos\r\nstretched out his hand, and the four friends repeated with one voice\r\nthe formula dictated by D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll for one, one for all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s well! Now let us everyone retire to his own home,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, as if he had done nothing but command all his life; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nattention! For from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X.\r\nA MOUSETRAP IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe invention of the mousetrap does not date from our days; as soon as\r\nsocieties, in forming, had invented any kind of police, that police\r\ninvented mousetraps.\r\n\r\nAs perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the Rue de\r\nJerusalem, and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for\r\nthe first time to this thing, allow us to explain to them what is a\r\nmousetrap.\r\n\r\nWhen in a house, of whatever kind it may be, an individual suspected of\r\nany crime is arrested, the arrest is held secret. Four or five men are\r\nplaced in ambuscade in the first room. The door is opened to all who\r\nknock. It is closed after them, and they are arrested; so that at the\r\nend of two or three days they have in their power almost all the\r\n_habitu\xc3\xa9s_ of the establishment. And that is a mousetrap.\r\n\r\nThe apartment of M. Bonacieux, then, became a mousetrap; and whoever\r\nappeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s people. It\r\nmust be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor, in\r\nwhich D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan lodged, those who called on him were exempted from\r\nthis detention.\r\n\r\nBesides, nobody came thither but the three Musketeers; they had all\r\nbeen engaged in earnest search and inquiries, but had discovered\r\nnothing. Athos had even gone so far as to question M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nthing which, considering the habitual reticence of the worthy\r\nMusketeer, had very much astonished his captain. But M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\r\nknew nothing, except that the last time he had seen the cardinal, the\r\nking, and the queen, the cardinal looked very thoughtful, the king\r\nuneasy, and the redness of the queen\xe2\x80\x99s eyes donated that she had been\r\nsleepless or tearful. But this last circumstance was not striking, as\r\nthe queen since her marriage had slept badly and wept much.\r\n\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville requested Athos, whatever might happen, to be observant\r\nof his duty to the king, but particularly to the queen, begging him to\r\nconvey his desires to his comrades.\r\n\r\nAs to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, he did not budge from his apartment. He converted his\r\nchamber into an observatory. From his windows he saw all the visitors\r\nwho were caught. Then, having removed a plank from his floor, and\r\nnothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room\r\nbeneath, in which the interrogatories were made, he heard all that\r\npassed between the inquisitors and the accused.\r\n\r\nThe interrogatories, preceded by a minute search operated upon the\r\npersons arrested, were almost always framed thus: \xe2\x80\x9cHas Madame Bonacieux\r\nsent anything to you for her husband, or any other person? Has Monsieur\r\nBonacieux sent anything to you for his wife, or for any other person?\r\nHas either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they knew anything, they would not question people in this manner,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, what is it they want to know? Why,\r\nthey want to know if the Duke of Buckingham is in Paris, and if he has\r\nhad, or is likely to have, an interview with the queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan held onto this idea, which, from what he had heard, was not\r\nwanting in probability.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the mousetrap continued in operation, and likewise\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s vigilance.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the day after the arrest of poor Bonacieux, as Athos\r\nhad just left D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to report at M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s, as nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nhad just struck, and as Planchet, who had not yet made the bed, was\r\nbeginning his task, a knocking was heard at the street door. The door\r\nwas instantly opened and shut; someone was taken in the mousetrap.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan flew to his hole, laid himself down on the floor at full\r\nlength, and listened.\r\n\r\nCries were soon heard, and then moans, which someone appeared to be\r\nendeavoring to stifle. There were no questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems like a woman! They\r\nsearch her; she resists; they use force\xe2\x80\x94the scoundrels!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of his prudence, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan restrained himself with great\r\ndifficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I tell you that I am the mistress of the house, gentlemen! I tell\r\nyou I am Madame Bonacieux; I tell you I belong to the queen!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\nunfortunate woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Bonacieux!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I be so lucky as to find\r\nwhat everybody is seeking for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice became more and more indistinct; a tumultuous movement shook\r\nthe partition. The victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon, gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94par\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the voice, which could now only be\r\nheard in inarticulate sounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are binding her; they are going to drag her away,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to himself, springing up from the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cMy sword! Good, it\r\nis by my side! Planchet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun and seek Athos, Porthos and Aramis. One of the three will\r\ncertainly be at home, perhaps all three. Tell them to take arms, to\r\ncome here, and to run! Ah, I remember, Athos is at Monsieur de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where are you going, monsieur, where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going down by the window, in order to be there the sooner,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou put back the boards, sweep the floor, go out at the\r\ndoor, and run as I told you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, monsieur! Monsieur! You will kill yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Planchet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, stupid fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; and laying hold of\r\nthe casement, he let himself gently down from the first story, which\r\nfortunately was not very elevated, without doing himself the slightest\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nHe then went straight to the door and knocked, murmuring, \xe2\x80\x9cI will go\r\nmyself and be caught in the mousetrap, but woe be to the cats that\r\nshall pounce upon such a mouse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before\r\nthe tumult ceased, steps approached, the door was opened, and\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, sword in hand, rushed into the rooms of M. Bonacieux, the\r\ndoor of which, doubtless acted upon by a spring, closed after him.\r\n\r\nThen those who dwelt in Bonacieux\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate house, together with\r\nthe nearest neighbors, heard loud cries, stamping of feet, clashing of\r\nswords, and breaking of furniture. A moment after, those who, surprised\r\nby this tumult, had gone to their windows to learn the cause of it, saw\r\nthe door open, and four men, clothed in black, not _come_ out of it,\r\nbut _fly_, like so many frightened crows, leaving on the ground and on\r\nthe corners of the furniture, feathers from their wings; that is to\r\nsay, patches of their clothes and fragments of their cloaks.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was conqueror\xe2\x80\x94without much effort, it must be confessed, for\r\nonly one of the officers was armed, and even he defended himself for\r\nform\xe2\x80\x99s sake. It is true that the three others had endeavored to knock\r\nthe young man down with chairs, stools, and crockery; but two or three\r\nscratches made by the Gascon\xe2\x80\x99s blade terrified them. Ten minutes\r\nsufficed for their defeat, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan remained master of the field\r\nof battle.\r\n\r\nThe neighbors who had opened their windows, with the coolness peculiar\r\nto the inhabitants of Paris in these times of perpetual riots and\r\ndisturbances, closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in\r\nblack flee\xe2\x80\x94their instinct telling them that for the time all was over.\r\nBesides, it began to grow late, and then, as today, people went to bed\r\nearly in the quarter of the Luxembourg.\r\n\r\nOn being left alone with Mme. Bonacieux, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan turned toward her;\r\nthe poor woman reclined where she had been left, half-fainting upon an\r\narmchair. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan examined her with a rapid glance.\r\n\r\nShe was a charming woman of twenty-five or twenty-six years, with dark\r\nhair, blue eyes, and a nose slightly turned up, admirable teeth, and a\r\ncomplexion marbled with rose and opal. There, however, ended the signs\r\nwhich might have confounded her with a lady of rank. The hands were\r\nwhite, but without delicacy; the feet did not bespeak the woman of\r\nquality. Happily, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties.\r\n\r\nWhile D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was examining Mme. Bonacieux, and was, as we have\r\nsaid, close to her, he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief,\r\nwhich he picked up, as was his habit, and at the corner of which he\r\nrecognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had\r\nnearly caused him and Aramis to cut each other\xe2\x80\x99s throat.\r\n\r\nFrom that time, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had been cautious with respect to\r\nhandkerchiefs with arms on them, and he therefore placed in the pocket\r\nof Mme. Bonacieux the one he had just picked up.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Mme. Bonacieux recovered her senses. She opened her\r\neyes, looked around her with terror, saw that the apartment was empty\r\nand that she was alone with her liberator. She extended her hands to\r\nhim with a smile. Mme. Bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have saved me; permit me to thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI have only done what every gentleman would\r\nhave done in my place; you owe me no thanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, monsieur, oh, yes; and I hope to prove to you that you have\r\nnot served an ingrate. But what could these men, whom I at first took\r\nfor robbers, want with me, and why is Monsieur Bonacieux not here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame, those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have\r\nbeen, for they are the agents of the cardinal; and as to your husband,\r\nMonsieur Bonacieux, he is not here because he was yesterday evening\r\nconducted to the Bastille.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband in the Bastille!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mme. Bonacieux. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God! What\r\nhas he done? Poor dear man, he is innocence itself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd something like a faint smile lighted the still-terrified features\r\nof the young woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has he done, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe that his only\r\ncrime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune\r\nto be your husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, monsieur, you know then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that you have been abducted, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd by whom? Do you know him? Oh, if you know him, tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy a man of from forty to forty-five years, with black hair, a dark\r\ncomplexion, and a scar on his left temple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is he, that is he; but his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, his name? I do not know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did my husband know I had been carried off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was informed of it by a letter, written to him by the abductor\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd does he suspect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux, with some embarrassment,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe cause of this event?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe attributed it, I believe, to a political cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubted from the first; and now I think entirely as he does. Then my\r\ndear Monsieur Bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far from it, madame, he was too proud of your prudence, and above\r\nall, of your love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA second smile, almost imperceptible, stole over the rosy lips of the\r\npretty young woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d continued D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9chow did you escape?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took advantage of a moment when they left me alone; and as I had\r\nknown since morning the reason of my abduction, with the help of the\r\nsheets I let myself down from the window. Then, as I believed my\r\nhusband would be at home, I hastened hither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo place yourself under his protection?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, poor dear man! I knew very well that he was incapable of\r\ndefending me; but as he could serve us in other ways, I wished to\r\ninform him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that is not my secret; I must not, therefore, tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cpardon me, madame, if, guardsman as I am,\r\nI remind you of prudence\xe2\x80\x94besides, I believe we are not here in a very\r\nproper place for imparting confidences. The men I have put to flight\r\nwill return reinforced; if they find us here, we are lost. I have sent\r\nfor three of my friends, but who knows whether they were at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes! You are right,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the affrighted Mme. Bonacieux; \xe2\x80\x9clet us\r\nfly! Let us save ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words she passed her arm under that of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and urged\r\nhim forward eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut whither shall we fly\xe2\x80\x94whither escape?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us first withdraw from this house; afterward we shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young woman and the young man, without taking the trouble to shut\r\nthe door after them, descended the Rue des Fossoyeurs rapidly, turned\r\ninto the Rue des Foss\xc3\xa9s-Monsieur-le-Prince, and did not stop till they\r\ncame to the Place St. Sulpice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now what are we to do, and where do you wish me to conduct you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am at quite a loss how to answer you, I admit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy intention was to inform Monsieur Laporte, through my husband, in\r\norder that Monsieur Laporte might tell us precisely what had taken\r\nplace at the Louvre in the last three days, and whether there is any\r\ndanger in presenting myself there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9ccan go and inform Monsieur Laporte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt you could, only there is one misfortune, and that is that\r\nMonsieur Bonacieux is known at the Louvre, and would be allowed to\r\npass; whereas you are not known there, and the gate would be closed\r\nagainst you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, bah!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have at some wicket of the Louvre a\r\n_concierge_ who is devoted to you, and who, thanks to a password,\r\nwould\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMme. Bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I give you this password,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cwould you forget it as\r\nsoon as you used it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my honor, by the faith of a gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with an\r\naccent so truthful that no one could mistake it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I believe you. You appear to be a brave young man; besides, your\r\nfortune may perhaps be the result of your devotedness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do, without a promise and voluntarily, all that I can do to\r\nserve the king and be agreeable to the queen. Dispose of me, then, as a\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x94where shall I go meanwhile?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there nobody from whose house Monsieur Laporte can come and fetch\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can trust nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are near Athos\xe2\x80\x99s door. Yes, here it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this Athos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of my friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if he should be at home and see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not at home, and I will carry away the key, after having placed\r\nyou in his apartment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if he should return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he won\xe2\x80\x99t return; and if he should, he will be told that I have\r\nbrought a woman with me, and that woman is in his apartment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that will compromise me sadly, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what consequence? Nobody knows you. Besides, we are in a situation\r\nto overlook ceremony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, then, let us go to your friend\xe2\x80\x99s house. Where does he live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRue F\xc3\xa9rou, two steps from here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth resumed their way. As D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had foreseen, Athos was not\r\nwithin. He took the key, which was customarily given him as one of the\r\nfamily, ascended the stairs, and introduced Mme. Bonacieux into the\r\nlittle apartment of which we have given a description.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are at home,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cRemain here, fasten the door inside, and\r\nopen it to nobody unless you hear three taps like this;\xe2\x80\x9d and he tapped\r\nthrice\xe2\x80\x94two taps close together and pretty hard, the other after an\r\ninterval, and lighter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, in my turn, let me give you\r\nmy instructions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am all attention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresent yourself at the wicket of the Louvre, on the side of the Rue\r\nde l\xe2\x80\x99Echelle, and ask for Germain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will ask you what you want, and you will answer by these two words,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tours\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Bruxelles.\xe2\x80\x99 He will at once put himself at your orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what shall I command him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo go and fetch Monsieur Laporte, the queen\xe2\x80\x99s _valet de chambre_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when he shall have informed him, and Monsieur Laporte is come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will send him to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well; but where and how shall I see you again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish to see me again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let that care be mine, and be at ease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI depend upon your word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan bowed to Mme. Bonacieux, darting at her the most loving\r\nglance that he could possibly concentrate upon her charming little\r\nperson; and while he descended the stairs, he heard the door closed and\r\ndouble-locked. In two bounds he was at the Louvre; as he entered the\r\nwicket of L\xe2\x80\x99Echelle, ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck. All the events we have\r\ndescribed had taken place within a half hour.\r\n\r\nEverything fell out as Mme. Bonacieux prophesied. On hearing the\r\npassword, Germain bowed. In a few minutes, Laporte was at the lodge; in\r\ntwo words D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan informed him where Mme. Bonacieux was. Laporte\r\nassured himself, by having it twice repeated, of the accurate address,\r\nand set off at a run. Hardly, however, had he taken ten steps before he\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung man,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9ca suggestion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may get into trouble by what has taken place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou believe so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Have you any friend whose clock is too slow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and call upon him, in order that he may give evidence of your\r\nhaving been with him at half past nine. In a court of justice that is\r\ncalled an alibi.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan found his advice prudent. He took to his heels, and was soon\r\nat M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s; but instead of going into the saloon with the rest\r\nof the crowd, he asked to be introduced to M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s office. As\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan so constantly frequented the h\xc3\xb4tel, no difficulty was made\r\nin complying with his request, and a servant went to inform M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville that his young compatriot, having something important to\r\ncommunicate, solicited a private audience. Five minutes after, M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville was asking D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan what he could do to serve him, and what\r\ncaused his visit at so late an hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who had profited by the moment\r\nhe had been left alone to put back M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s clock\r\nthree-quarters of an hour, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I thought, as it was yet only\r\ntwenty-five minutes past nine, it was not too late to wait upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-five minutes past nine!\xe2\x80\x9d cried M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, looking at the\r\nclock; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, that\xe2\x80\x99s impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, rather, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthe clock shows it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville; \xe2\x80\x9cI believed it later. But what can\r\nI do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan told M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville a long history about the queen. He\r\nexpressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her Majesty;\r\nhe related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal\r\nwith regard to Buckingham, and all with a tranquillity and candor of\r\nwhich M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville was the more the dupe, from having himself, as we\r\nhave said, observed something fresh between the cardinal, the king, and\r\nthe queen.\r\n\r\nAs ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock was striking, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan left M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, who\r\nthanked him for his information, recommended him to have the service of\r\nthe king and queen always at heart, and returned to the saloon; but at\r\nthe foot of the stairs, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan remembered he had forgotten his\r\ncane. He consequently sprang up again, re-entered the office, with a\r\nturn of his finger set the clock right again, that it might not be\r\nperceived the next day that it had been put wrong, and certain from\r\nthat time that he had a witness to prove his alibi, he ran downstairs\r\nand soon found himself in the street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI.\r\nIN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS\r\n\r\n\r\nHis visit to M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville being paid, the pensive D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan took the\r\nlongest way homeward.\r\n\r\nOn what was D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan thinking, that he strayed thus from his path,\r\ngazing at the stars of heaven, and sometimes sighing, sometimes\r\nsmiling?\r\n\r\nHe was thinking of Mme. Bonacieux. For an apprentice Musketeer the\r\nyoung woman was almost an ideal of love. Pretty, mysterious, initiated\r\nin almost all the secrets of the court, which reflected such a charming\r\ngravity over her pleasing features, it might be surmised that she was\r\nnot wholly unmoved; and this is an irresistible charm to novices in\r\nlove. Moreover, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the\r\ndemons who wished to search and ill treat her; and this important\r\nservice had established between them one of those sentiments of\r\ngratitude which so easily assume a more tender character.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan already fancied himself, so rapid is the flight of our\r\ndreams upon the wings of imagination, accosted by a messenger from the\r\nyoung woman, who brought him some billet appointing a meeting, a gold\r\nchain, or a diamond. We have observed that young cavaliers received\r\npresents from their king without shame. Let us add that in these times\r\nof lax morality they had no more delicacy with respect to the\r\nmistresses; and that the latter almost always left them valuable and\r\ndurable remembrances, as if they essayed to conquer the fragility of\r\ntheir sentiments by the solidity of their gifts.\r\n\r\nWithout a blush, men made their way in the world by the means of women\r\nblushing. Such as were only beautiful gave their beauty, whence,\r\nwithout doubt, comes the proverb, \xe2\x80\x9cThe most beautiful girl in the world\r\ncan only give what she has.\xe2\x80\x9d Such as were rich gave in addition a part\r\nof their money; and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may\r\nbe cited who would neither have won their spurs in the first place, nor\r\ntheir battles afterward, without the purse, more or less furnished,\r\nwhich their mistress fastened to the saddle bow.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan owned nothing. Provincial diffidence, that slight varnish,\r\nthe ephemeral flower, that down of the peach, had evaporated to the\r\nwinds through the little orthodox counsels which the three Musketeers\r\ngave their friend. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, following the strange custom of the\r\ntimes, considered himself at Paris as on a campaign, neither more nor\r\nless than if he had been in Flanders\xe2\x80\x94Spain yonder, woman here. In each\r\nthere was an enemy to contend with, and contributions to be levied.\r\n\r\nBut, we must say, at the present moment D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was ruled by a\r\nfeeling much more noble and disinterested. The mercer had said that he\r\nwas rich; the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as\r\nM. Bonacieux; and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of\r\nlove, which had been the consequence of it. We say _almost_, for the\r\nidea that a young, handsome, kind, and witty woman is at the same time\r\nrich takes nothing from the beginning of love, but on the contrary\r\nstrengthens it.\r\n\r\nThere are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which\r\nare highly becoming to beauty. A fine and white stocking, a silken\r\nrobe, a lace kerchief, a pretty slipper on the foot, a tasty ribbon on\r\nthe head do not make an ugly woman pretty, but they make a pretty woman\r\nbeautiful, without reckoning the hands, which gain by all this; the\r\nhands, among women particularly, to be beautiful must be idle.\r\n\r\nThen D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, as the reader, from whom we have not concealed the\r\nstate of his fortune, very well knows\xe2\x80\x94D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was not a millionaire;\r\nhe hoped to become one someday, but the time which in his own mind he\r\nfixed upon for this happy change was still far distant. In the\r\nmeanwhile, how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those\r\nthousands of nothings which constitute a woman\xe2\x80\x99s happiness, and be\r\nunable to give her those thousands of nothings. At least, when the\r\nwoman is rich and the lover is not, that which he cannot offer she\r\noffers to herself; and although it is generally with her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmoney that she procures herself this indulgence, the gratitude for it\r\nseldom reverts to him.\r\n\r\nThen D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, disposed to become the most tender of lovers, was at\r\nthe same time a very devoted friend. In the midst of his amorous\r\nprojects for the mercer\xe2\x80\x99s wife, he did not forget his friends. The\r\npretty Mme. Bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the Plain St.\r\nDenis or in the fair of St. Germain, in company with Athos, Porthos,\r\nand Aramis, to whom D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had often remarked this. Then one could\r\nenjoy charming little dinners, where one touches on one side the hand\r\nof a friend, and on the other the foot of a mistress. Besides, on\r\npressing occasions, in extreme difficulties, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan would become\r\nthe preserver of his friends.\r\n\r\nAnd M. Bonacieux, whom D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had pushed into the hands of the\r\nofficers, denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to\r\nsave him? We are compelled to admit to our readers that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nthought nothing about him in any way; or that if he did think of him,\r\nit was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was,\r\nwherever it might be. Love is the most selfish of all the passions.\r\n\r\nLet our readers reassure themselves. If D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan forgets his host, or\r\nappears to forget him, under the pretense of not knowing where he has\r\nbeen carried, we will not forget him, and we know where he is. But for\r\nthe moment, let us do as did the amorous Gascon; we will see after the\r\nworthy mercer later.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, reflecting on his future amours, addressing himself to the\r\nbeautiful night, and smiling at the stars, ascended the Rue\r\nCherish-Midi, or Chase-Midi, as it was then called. As he found himself\r\nin the quarter in which Aramis lived, he took it into his head to pay\r\nhis friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to\r\nsend Planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the\r\nmousetrap. Now, if Aramis had been at home when Planchet came to his\r\nabode, he had doubtless hastened to the Rue des Fossoyeurs, and finding\r\nnobody there but his other two companions perhaps, they would not be\r\nable to conceive what all this meant. This mystery required an\r\nexplanation; at least, so D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan declared to himself.\r\n\r\nHe likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty\r\nlittle Mme. Bonacieux, of whom his head, if not his heart, was already\r\nfull. We must never look for discretion in first love. First love is\r\naccompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to\r\noverflow, it will stifle you.\r\n\r\nParis for two hours past had been dark, and seemed a desert. Eleven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock sounded from all the clocks of the Faubourg St. Germain. It was\r\ndelightful weather. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was passing along a lane on the spot\r\nwhere the Rue d\xe2\x80\x99Assas is now situated, breathing the balmy emanations\r\nwhich were borne upon the wind from the Rue de Vaugirard, and which\r\narose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze\r\nof night. From a distance resounded, deadened, however, by good\r\nshutters, the songs of the tipplers, enjoying themselves in the\r\ncabarets scattered along the plain. Arrived at the end of the lane,\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan turned to the left. The house in which Aramis dwelt was\r\nsituated between the Rue Cassette and the Rue Servandoni.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had just passed the Rue Cassette, and already perceived the\r\ndoor of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s house, shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis\r\nwhich formed a vast arch opposite the front of it, when he perceived\r\nsomething like a shadow issuing from the Rue Servandoni. This something\r\nwas enveloped in a cloak, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan at first believed it was a\r\nman; but by the smallness of the form, the hesitation of the walk, and\r\nthe indecision of the step, he soon discovered that it was a woman.\r\nFurther, this woman, as if not certain of the house she was seeking,\r\nlifted up her eyes to look around her, stopped, went backward, and then\r\nreturned again. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was perplexed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I go and offer her my services?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cBy her step she\r\nmust be young; perhaps she is pretty. Oh, yes! But a woman who wanders\r\nin the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover. If I\r\nshould disturb a rendezvous, that would not be the best means of\r\ncommencing an acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeantime the young woman continued to advance, counting the houses and\r\nwindows. This was neither long nor difficult. There were but three\r\nh\xc3\xb4tels in this part of the street; and only two windows looking toward\r\nthe road, one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which Aramis\r\noccupied, the other belonging to Aramis himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pardieu!_\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to himself, to whose mind the niece of the\r\ntheologian reverted, \xe2\x80\x9c_pardieu_, it would be droll if this belated dove\r\nshould be in search of our friend\xe2\x80\x99s house. But on my soul, it looks so.\r\nAh, my dear Aramis, this time I shall find you out.\xe2\x80\x9d And D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\nmaking himself as small as he could, concealed himself in the darkest\r\nside of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche.\r\n\r\nThe young woman continued to advance; and in addition to the lightness\r\nof her step, which had betrayed her, she emitted a little cough which\r\ndenoted a sweet voice. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan believed this cough to be a signal.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal\r\nwhich had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker, or whether\r\nwithout this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her\r\njourney, she resolutely drew near to Aramis\xe2\x80\x99s shutter, and tapped, at\r\nthree equal intervals, with her bent finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all very fine, dear Aramis,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\r\nMonsieur Hypocrite, I understand how you study theology.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three blows were scarcely struck, when the inside blind was opened\r\nand a light appeared through the panes of the outside shutter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d said the listener, \xe2\x80\x9cnot through doors, but through windows!\r\nAh, this visit was expected. We shall see the windows open, and the\r\nlady enter by escalade. Very pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut to the great astonishment of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, the shutter remained\r\nclosed. Still more, the light which had shone for an instant\r\ndisappeared, and all was again in obscurity.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan thought this could not last long, and continued to look with\r\nall his eyes and listen with all his ears.\r\n\r\nHe was right; at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard\r\ninside. The young woman in the street replied by a single tap, and the\r\nshutter was opened a little way.\r\n\r\nIt may be judged whether D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan looked or listened with avidity.\r\nUnfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber; but the\r\neyes of the young man were accustomed to the night. Besides, the eyes\r\nof the Gascons have, as it is asserted, like those of cats, the faculty\r\nof seeing in the dark.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white\r\nobject, which she unfolded quickly, and which took the form of a\r\nhandkerchief. She made her interlocutor observe the corner of this\r\nunfolded object.\r\n\r\nThis immediately recalled to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s mind the handkerchief which\r\nhe had found at the feet of Mme. Bonacieux, which had reminded him of\r\nthat which he had dragged from under the feet of Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil could that handkerchief signify?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPlaced where he was, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan could not perceive the face of Aramis.\r\nWe say Aramis, because the young man entertained no doubt that it was\r\nhis friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of\r\nthe exterior. Curiosity prevailed over prudence; and profiting by the\r\npreoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have\r\nplunged the two personages now on the scene, he stole from his hiding\r\nplace, and quick as lightning, but stepping with utmost caution, he ran\r\nand placed himself close to the angle of the wall, from which his eye\r\ncould pierce the interior of Aramis\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nUpon gaining this advantage D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was near uttering a cry of\r\nsurprise; it was not Aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal\r\nvisitor, it was a woman! D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, however, could only see enough to\r\nrecognize the form of her vestments, not enough to distinguish her\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from\r\nher pocket, and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her.\r\nThen some words were spoken by the two women. At length the shutter\r\nclosed. The woman who was outside the window turned round, and passed\r\nwithin four steps of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, pulling down the hood of her mantle;\r\nbut the precaution was too late, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had already recognized Mme.\r\nBonacieux.\r\n\r\nMme. Bonacieux! The suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket; but what\r\nprobability was there that Mme. Bonacieux, who had sent for M. Laporte\r\nin order to be reconducted to the Louvre, should be running about the\r\nstreets of Paris at half past eleven at night, at the risk of being\r\nabducted a second time?\r\n\r\nThis must be, then, an affair of importance; and what is the most\r\nimportant affair to a woman of twenty-five! Love.\r\n\r\nBut was it on her own account, or on account of another, that she\r\nexposed herself to such hazards? This was a question the young man\r\nasked himself, whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed, being in\r\nheart neither more nor less than an accepted lover.\r\n\r\nThere was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither Mme.\r\nBonacieux was going; that was to follow her. This method was so simple\r\nthat D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively.\r\n\r\nBut at the sight of the young man, who detached himself from the wall\r\nlike a statue walking from its niche, and at the noise of the steps\r\nwhich she heard resound behind her, Mme. Bonacieux uttered a little cry\r\nand fled.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan ran after her. It was not difficult for him to overtake a\r\nwoman embarrassed with her cloak. He came up with her before she had\r\ntraversed a third of the street. The unfortunate woman was exhausted,\r\nnot by fatigue, but by terror, and when D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan placed his hand upon\r\nher shoulder, she sank upon one knee, crying in a choking voice, \xe2\x80\x9cKill\r\nme, if you please, you shall know nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist; but as he\r\nfelt by her weight she was on the point of fainting, he made haste to\r\nreassure her by protestations of devotedness. These protestations were\r\nnothing for Mme. Bonacieux, for such protestations may be made with the\r\nworst intentions in the world; but the voice was all. Mme. Bonacieux\r\nthought she recognized the sound of that voice; she reopened her eyes,\r\ncast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so, and at once\r\nperceiving it was D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, she uttered a cry of joy, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is you,\r\nit is you! Thank God, thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is I,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cit is I, whom God has sent to watch\r\nover you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it with that intention you followed me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young woman,\r\nwith a coquettish smile, whose somewhat bantering character resumed its\r\ninfluence, and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in\r\nwhich she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cno, I confess it. It was chance that threw me\r\nin your way; I saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of your friends?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Mme. Bonacieux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout doubt; Aramis is one of my best friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAramis! Who is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, you won\xe2\x80\x99t tell me you don\xe2\x80\x99t know Aramis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the first time I ever heard his name pronounced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the first time, then, that you ever went to that house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy a Musketeer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not he, then, you came to seek?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least in the world. Besides, you must have seen that the\r\nperson to whom I spoke was a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true; but this woman is a friend of Aramis\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94since she lodges with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat does not concern me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that is not my secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Madame Bonacieux, you are charming; but at the same time you\r\nare one of the most mysterious women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I lose by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; you are, on the contrary, adorable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your arm, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost willingly. And now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow escort me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere I am going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will see, because you will leave me at the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I wait for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be useless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will return alone, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps yes, perhaps no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a\r\nwoman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I will know it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will wait until you come out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, adieu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not want you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have claimed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe aid of a gentleman, not the watchfulness of a spy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe word is rather hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are they called who follow others in spite of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are indiscreet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe word is too mild.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, madame, I perceive I must do as you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no merit in repentance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you really repent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing about it myself. But what I know is that I promise to\r\ndo all you wish if you allow me to accompany you where you are going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will leave me then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout waiting for my coming out again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWord of honor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the faith of a gentleman. Take my arm, and let us go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan offered his arm to Mme. Bonacieux, who willingly took it,\r\nhalf laughing, half trembling, and both gained the top of Rue de la\r\nHarpe. Arriving there, the young woman seemed to hesitate, as she had\r\nbefore done in the Rue Vaugirard. She seemed, however, by certain\r\nsigns, to recognize a door, and approaching that door, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\r\nmonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cit is here I have business; a thousand thanks for\r\nyour honorable company, which has saved me from all the dangers to\r\nwhich, alone, I was exposed. But the moment is come to keep your word;\r\nI have reached my destination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will have nothing to fear on your return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have nothing to fear but robbers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could they take from me? I have not a penny about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget that beautiful handkerchief with the coat of arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat which I found at your feet, and replaced in your pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, imprudent man! Do you wish to destroy me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see very plainly that there is still danger for you, since a\r\nsingle word makes you tremble; and you confess that if that word were\r\nheard you would be ruined. Come, come, madame!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\nseizing her hands, and surveying her with an ardent glance, \xe2\x80\x9ccome, be\r\nmore generous. Confide in me. Have you not read in my eyes that there\r\nis nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mme. Bonacieux; \xe2\x80\x9ctherefore, ask my own secrets, and I\r\nwill reveal them to you; but those of others\xe2\x80\x94that is quite another\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall discover them; as these secrets\r\nmay have an influence over your life, these secrets must become mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeware of what you do!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young woman, in a manner so serious\r\nas to make D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan start in spite of himself. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, meddle in nothing\r\nwhich concerns me. Do not seek to assist me in that which I am\r\naccomplishing. This I ask of you in the name of the interest with which\r\nI inspire you, in the name of the service you have rendered me and\r\nwhich I never shall forget while I have life. Rather, place faith in\r\nwhat I tell you. Have no more concern about me; I exist no longer for\r\nyou, any more than if you had never seen me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust Aramis do as much as I, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, deeply piqued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the second or third time, monsieur, that you have repeated\r\nthat name, and yet I have told you that I do not know him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not know the man at whose shutter you have just knocked?\r\nIndeed, madame, you believe me too credulous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this\r\nstory and create this personage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI invent nothing, madame; I create nothing. I only speak that exact\r\ntruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you say that one of your friends lives in that house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say so, and I repeat it for the third time; that house is one\r\ninhabited by my friend, and that friend is Aramis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this will be cleared up at a later period,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the young\r\nwoman; \xe2\x80\x9cno, monsieur, be silent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you could see my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would there read so\r\nmuch curiosity that you would pity me and so much love that you would\r\ninstantly satisfy my curiosity. We have nothing to fear from those who\r\nlove us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak very suddenly of love, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman,\r\nshaking her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is because love has come suddenly upon me, and for the first\r\ntime; and because I am only twenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young woman looked at him furtively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen; I am already upon the scent,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cAbout three\r\nmonths ago I was near having a duel with Aramis concerning a\r\nhandkerchief resembling the one you showed to the woman in his\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94for a handkerchief marked in the same manner, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman, \xe2\x80\x9cyou weary me very much, I assure\r\nyou, with your questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you, madame, prudent as you are, think, if you were to be arrested\r\nwith that handkerchief, and that handkerchief were to be seized, would\r\nyou not be compromised?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what way? The initials are only mine\xe2\x80\x94C. B., Constance Bonacieux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr Camille de Bois-Tracy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence, monsieur! Once again, silence! Ah, since the dangers I incur\r\non my own account cannot stop you, think of those you may yourself\r\nrun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; there is peril of imprisonment, risk of life in knowing me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will not leave you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman, supplicating him and clasping her\r\nhands together, \xe2\x80\x9cmonsieur, in the name of heaven, by the honor of a\r\nsoldier, by the courtesy of a gentleman, depart! There, there midnight\r\nsounds! That is the hour when I am expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, bowing; \xe2\x80\x9cI can refuse nothing asked of me\r\nthus. Be content; I will depart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will not follow me; you will not watch me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will return home instantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I was quite sure you were a good and brave young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme.\r\nBonacieux, holding out her hand to him, and placing the other upon the\r\nknocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan seized the hand held out to him, and kissed it ardently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I wish I had never seen you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with that\r\ningenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of\r\npoliteness, because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves\r\nthat feeling prevails over reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mme. Bonacieux, in a voice almost caressing, and\r\npressing the hand of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who had not relinquished hers, \xe2\x80\x9cwell:\r\nI will not say as much as you do; what is lost for today may not be\r\nlost forever. Who knows, when I shall be at liberty, that I may not\r\nsatisfy your curiosity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you make the same promise to my love?\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\nbeside himself with joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, as to that, I do not engage myself. That depends upon the\r\nsentiments with which you may inspire me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen today, madame\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, today, I am no further than gratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You are too charming,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, sorrowfully; \xe2\x80\x9cand you\r\nabuse my love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I use your generosity, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. But be of good cheer; with\r\ncertain people, everything comes round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you render me the happiest of men! Do not forget this evening\xe2\x80\x94do\r\nnot forget that promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe satisfied. In the proper time and place I will remember everything.\r\nNow then, go, go, in the name of heaven! I was expected at sharp\r\nmidnight, and I am late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but in certain circumstances five minutes are five ages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen one loves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! And who told you I had no affair with a lover?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a man, then, who expects you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cA man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe discussion is going to begin again!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux, with a\r\nhalf-smile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; I go, I depart! I believe in you, and I would have all the\r\nmerit of my devotion, even if that devotion were stupidity. Adieu,\r\nmadame, adieu!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort\r\nfrom the hand he held, he sprang away, running, while Mme. Bonacieux\r\nknocked, as at the shutter, three light and regular taps. When he had\r\ngained the angle of the street, he turned. The door had been opened,\r\nand shut again; the mercer\xe2\x80\x99s pretty wife had disappeared.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan pursued his way. He had given his word not to watch Mme.\r\nBonacieux, and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was\r\ngoing or upon the person who should accompany her, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan would\r\nhave returned home, since he had so promised. Five minutes later he was\r\nin the Rue des Fossoyeurs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Athos!\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9che will never guess what all this means. He\r\nwill have fallen asleep waiting for me, or else he will have returned\r\nhome, where he will have learned that a woman had been there. A woman\r\nwith Athos! After all,\xe2\x80\x9d continued D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthere was certainly one\r\nwith Aramis. All this is very strange; and I am curious to know how it\r\nwill end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBadly, monsieur, badly!\xe2\x80\x9d replied a voice which the young man\r\nrecognized as that of Planchet; for, soliloquizing aloud, as very\r\npreoccupied people do, he had entered the alley, at the end of which\r\nwere the stairs which led to his chamber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, badly? What do you mean by that, you idiot?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll sorts of misfortunes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, Monsieur Athos is arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArrested! Athos arrested! What for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was found in your lodging; they took him for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd by whom was he arrested?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Guards brought by the men in black whom you put to flight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did he not tell them his name? Why did he not tell them he knew\r\nnothing about this affair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe took care not to do so, monsieur; on the contrary, he came up to me\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x98It is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and\r\nnot I, since he knows everything and I know nothing. They will believe\r\nhe is arrested, and that will give him time; in three days I will tell\r\nthem who I am, and they cannot fail to let me go.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo, Athos! Noble heart!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cI know him well\r\nthere! And what did the officers do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour conveyed him away, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where\xe2\x80\x94to the Bastille or Fort\r\nl\xe2\x80\x99Ev\xc3\xaaque. Two remained with the men in black, who rummaged every place\r\nand took all the papers. The last two mounted guard at the door during\r\nthis examination; then, when all was over, they went away, leaving the\r\nhouse empty and exposed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Porthos and Aramis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not find them; they did not come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they may come any moment, for you left word that I awaited them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t budge, then; if they come, tell them what has happened.\r\nLet them wait for me at the Pomme-de-Pin. Here it would be dangerous;\r\nthe house may be watched. I will run to Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville to tell\r\nthem all this, and will meet them there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will remain; you are not afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, coming back\r\nto recommend courage to his lackey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe easy, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet; \xe2\x80\x9cyou do not know me yet. I am brave\r\nwhen I set about it. It is all in beginning. Besides, I am a Picard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is understood,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cyou would rather be killed\r\nthan desert your post?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur; and there is nothing I would not do to prove to\r\nMonsieur that I am attached to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt appears that the method I have\r\nadopted with this boy is decidedly the best. I shall use it again upon\r\noccasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with all the swiftness of his legs, already a little fatigued,\r\nhowever, with the perambulations of the day, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan directed his\r\ncourse toward M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville was not at his h\xc3\xb4tel. His company was on guard at the\r\nLouvre; he was at the Louvre with his company.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to reach M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville; it was important that he\r\nshould be informed of what was passing. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan resolved to try and\r\nenter the Louvre. His costume of Guardsman in the company of M.\r\nDessessart ought to be his passport.\r\n\r\nHe therefore went down the Rue des Petits Augustins, and came up to the\r\nquay, in order to take the New Bridge. He had at first an idea of\r\ncrossing by the ferry; but on gaining the riverside, he had\r\nmechanically put his hand into his pocket, and perceived that he had\r\nnot wherewithal to pay his passage.\r\n\r\nAs he gained the top of the Rue Gu\xc3\xa9negaud, he saw two persons coming\r\nout of the Rue Dauphine whose appearance very much struck him. Of the\r\ntwo persons who composed this group, one was a man and the other a\r\nwoman. The woman had the outline of Mme. Bonacieux; the man resembled\r\nAramis so much as to be mistaken for him.\r\n\r\nBesides, the woman wore that black mantle which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan could still\r\nsee outlined on the shutter of the Rue de Vaugirard and on the door of\r\nthe Rue de la Harpe; still further, the man wore the uniform of a\r\nMusketeer.\r\n\r\nThe woman\xe2\x80\x99s hood was pulled down, and the man held a handkerchief to\r\nhis face. Both, as this double precaution indicated, had an interest in\r\nnot being recognized.\r\n\r\nThey took the bridge. That was D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s road, as he was going to\r\nthe Louvre. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan followed them.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman\r\nwas really Mme. Bonacieux and that the man was Aramis.\r\n\r\nHe felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his\r\nheart. He felt himself doubly betrayed, by his friend and by her whom\r\nhe already loved like a mistress. Mme. Bonacieux had declared to him,\r\nby all the gods, that she did not know Aramis; and a quarter of an hour\r\nafter having made this assertion, he found her hanging on the arm of\r\nAramis.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercer\xe2\x80\x99s pretty\r\nwife for three hours; that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude\r\nfor having delivered her from the men in black, who wished to carry her\r\noff, and that she had promised him nothing. He considered himself an\r\noutraged, betrayed, and ridiculed lover. Blood and anger mounted to his\r\nface; he was resolved to unravel the mystery.\r\n\r\nThe young man and young woman perceived they were watched, and\r\nredoubled their speed. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan determined upon his course. He passed\r\nthem, then returned so as to meet them exactly before the Samaritaine,\r\nwhich was illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that\r\npart of the bridge.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan stopped before them, and they stopped before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the Musketeer, recoiling a step,\r\nand with a foreign accent, which proved to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan that he was\r\ndeceived in one of his conjectures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not Aramis!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur, it is not Aramis; and by your exclamation I perceive you\r\nhave mistaken me for another, and pardon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou pardon me?\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me, then, to pass on, since it is\r\nnot with me you have anything to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, monsieur, it is not with you that I have anything to\r\ndo; it is with Madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Madame! You do not know her,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are deceived, monsieur; I know her very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux; in a tone of reproach, \xe2\x80\x9cah, monsieur, I had\r\nyour promise as a soldier and your word as a gentleman. I hoped to be\r\nable to rely upon that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I, madame!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, embarrassed; \xe2\x80\x9cyou promised me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake my arm, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9cand let us continue our\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, however, stupefied, cast down, annihilated by all that\r\nhappened, stood, with crossed arms, before the Musketeer and Mme.\r\nBonacieux.\r\n\r\nThe Musketeer advanced two steps, and pushed D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan aside with his\r\nhand. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword. At the same\r\ntime, and with the rapidity of lightning, the stranger drew his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of heaven, my Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mme. Bonacieux, throwing\r\nherself between the combatants and seizing the swords with her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, enlightened by a sudden idea, \xe2\x80\x9cmy Lord!\r\nPardon me, monsieur, but you are not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord the Duke of Buckingham,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux, in an undertone;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand now you may ruin us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord, Madame, I ask a hundred pardons! But I love her, my Lord, and\r\nwas jealous. You know what it is to love, my Lord. Pardon me, and then\r\ntell me how I can risk my life to serve your Grace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a brave young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham, holding out his hand to\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who pressed it respectfully. \xe2\x80\x9cYou offer me your services;\r\nwith the same frankness I accept them. Follow us at a distance of\r\ntwenty paces, as far as the Louvre, and if anyone watches us, slay\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan placed his naked sword under his arm, allowed the duke and\r\nMme. Bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead, and then followed them,\r\nready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of\r\nCharles I.\r\n\r\nFortunately, he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his\r\ndevotion, and the young woman and the handsome Musketeer entered the\r\nLouvre by the wicket of the Echelle without any interference.\r\n\r\nAs for D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the\r\nPomme-de-Pin, where he found Porthos and Aramis awaiting him. Without\r\ngiving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had\r\ncaused them, he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in\r\nwhich he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, carried away as we are by our narrative, we must leave our\r\nthree friends to themselves, and follow the Duke of Buckingham and his\r\nguide through the labyrinths of the Louvre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII.\r\nGEORGE VILLIERS, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM\r\n\r\n\r\nMme. Bonacieux and the duke entered the Louvre without difficulty. Mme.\r\nBonacieux was known to belong to the queen; the duke wore the uniform\r\nof the Musketeers of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, who, as we have said, were that\r\nevening on guard. Besides, Germain was in the interests of the queen;\r\nand if anything should happen, Mme. Bonacieux would be accused of\r\nhaving introduced her lover into the Louvre, that was all. She took the\r\nrisk upon herself. Her reputation would be lost, it is true; but of\r\nwhat value in the world was the reputation of the little wife of a\r\nmercer?\r\n\r\nOnce within the interior of the court, the duke and the young woman\r\nfollowed the wall for the space of about twenty-five steps. This space\r\npassed, Mme. Bonacieux pushed a little servants\xe2\x80\x99 door, open by day but\r\ngenerally closed at night. The door yielded. Both entered, and found\r\nthemselves in darkness; but Mme. Bonacieux was acquainted with all the\r\nturnings and windings of this part of the Louvre, appropriated for the\r\npeople of the household. She closed the door after her, took the duke\r\nby the hand, and after a few experimental steps, grasped a balustrade,\r\nput her foot upon the bottom step, and began to ascend the staircase.\r\nThe duke counted two stories. She then turned to the right, followed\r\nthe course of a long corridor, descended a flight, went a few steps\r\nfarther, introduced a key into a lock, opened a door, and pushed the\r\nduke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cRemain here, my\r\nLord Duke; someone will come.\xe2\x80\x9d She then went out by the same door,\r\nwhich she locked, so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, isolated as he was, we must say that the Duke of\r\nBuckingham did not experience an instant of fear. One of the salient\r\npoints of his character was the search for adventures and a love of\r\nromance. Brave, rash, and enterprising, this was not the first time he\r\nhad risked his life in such attempts. He had learned that the pretended\r\nmessage from Anne of Austria, upon the faith of which he had come to\r\nParis, was a snare; but instead of regaining England, he had, abusing\r\nthe position in which he had been placed, declared to the queen that he\r\nwould not depart without seeing her. The queen had at first positively\r\nrefused; but at length became afraid that the duke, if exasperated,\r\nwould commit some folly. She had already decided upon seeing him and\r\nurging his immediate departure, when, on the very evening of coming to\r\nthis decision, Mme. Bonacieux, who was charged with going to fetch the\r\nduke and conducting him to the Louvre, was abducted. For two days no\r\none knew what had become of her, and everything remained in suspense;\r\nbut once free, and placed in communication with Laporte, matters\r\nresumed their course, and she accomplished the perilous enterprise\r\nwhich, but for her arrest, would have been executed three days earlier.\r\n\r\nBuckingham, left alone, walked toward a mirror. His Musketeer\xe2\x80\x99s uniform\r\nbecame him marvelously.\r\n\r\nAt thirty-five, which was then his age, he passed, with just title, for\r\nthe handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of France or\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe favorite of two kings, immensely rich, all-powerful in a kingdom\r\nwhich he disordered at his fancy and calmed again at his caprice,\r\nGeorge Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, had lived one of those fabulous\r\nexistences which survive, in the course of centuries, to astonish\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nSure of himself, convinced of his own power, certain that the laws\r\nwhich rule other men could not reach him, he went straight to the\r\nobject he aimed at, even were this object so elevated and so dazzling\r\nthat it would have been madness for any other even to have contemplated\r\nit. It was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the\r\nbeautiful and proud Anne of Austria, and in making himself loved by\r\ndazzling her.\r\n\r\nGeorge Villiers placed himself before the glass, as we have said,\r\nrestored the undulations to his beautiful hair, which the weight of his\r\nhat had disordered, twisted his mustache, and, his heart swelling with\r\njoy, happy and proud at being near the moment he had so long sighed\r\nfor, he smiled upon himself with pride and hope.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened, and a woman\r\nappeared. Buckingham saw this apparition in the glass; he uttered a\r\ncry. It was the queen!\r\n\r\nAnne of Austria was then twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age; that\r\nis to say, she was in the full splendor of her beauty.\r\n\r\nHer carriage was that of a queen or a goddess; her eyes, which cast the\r\nbrilliancy of emeralds, were perfectly beautiful, and yet were at the\r\nsame time full of sweetness and majesty.\r\n\r\nHer mouth was small and rosy; and although her underlip, like that of\r\nall princes of the House of Austria, protruded slightly beyond the\r\nother, it was eminently lovely in its smile, but as profoundly\r\ndisdainful in its contempt.\r\n\r\nHer skin was admired for its velvety softness; her hands and arms were\r\nof surpassing beauty, all the poets of the time singing them as\r\nincomparable.\r\n\r\nLastly, her hair, which, from being light in her youth, had become\r\nchestnut, and which she wore curled very plainly, and with much powder,\r\nadmirably set off her face, in which the most rigid critic could only\r\nhave desired a little less rouge, and the most fastidious sculptor a\r\nlittle more fineness in the nose.\r\n\r\nBuckingham remained for a moment dazzled. Never had Anne of Austria\r\nappeared to him so beautiful, amid balls, f\xc3\xaates, or carousals, as she\r\nappeared to him at this moment, dressed in a simple robe of white\r\nsatin, and accompanied by Donna Estafania\xe2\x80\x94the only one of her Spanish\r\nwomen who had not been driven from her by the jealousy of the king or\r\nby the persecutions of Richelieu.\r\n\r\nAnne of Austria took two steps forward. Buckingham threw himself at her\r\nfeet, and before the queen could prevent him, kissed the hem of her\r\nrobe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuke, you already know that it is not I who caused you to be written\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, madame! Yes, your Majesty!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the duke. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that I\r\nmust have been mad, senseless, to believe that snow would become\r\nanimated or marble warm; but what then! They who love believe easily in\r\nlove. Besides, I have lost nothing by this journey because I see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you know why and how I see you; because,\r\ninsensible to all my sufferings, you persist in remaining in a city\r\nwhere, by remaining, you run the risk of your life, and make me run the\r\nrisk of my honor. I see you to tell you that everything separates\r\nus\xe2\x80\x94the depths of the sea, the enmity of kingdoms, the sanctity of vows.\r\nIt is sacrilege to struggle against so many things, my Lord. In short,\r\nI see you to tell you that we must never see each other again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak on, madame, speak on, Queen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham; \xe2\x80\x9cthe sweetness of\r\nyour voice covers the harshness of your words. You talk of sacrilege!\r\nWhy, the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by God for\r\neach other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the queen, \xe2\x80\x9cyou forget that I have never said that I\r\nlove you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have never told me that you did not love me; and truly, to\r\nspeak such words to me would be, on the part of your Majesty, too great\r\nan ingratitude. For tell me, where can you find a love like mine\xe2\x80\x94a love\r\nwhich neither time, nor absence, nor despair can extinguish, a love\r\nwhich contents itself with a lost ribbon, a stray look, or a chance\r\nword? It is now three years, madame, since I saw you for the first\r\ntime, and during those three years I have loved you thus. Shall I tell\r\nyou each ornament of your toilet? Mark! I see you now. You were seated\r\nupon cushions in the Spanish fashion; you wore a robe of green satin\r\nembroidered with gold and silver, hanging sleeves knotted upon your\r\nbeautiful arms\xe2\x80\x94those lovely arms\xe2\x80\x94with large diamonds. You wore a close\r\nruff, a small cap upon your head of the same color as your robe, and in\r\nthat cap a heron\xe2\x80\x99s feather. Hold! Hold! I shut my eyes, and I can see\r\nyou as you then were; I open them again, and I see what you are now\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nhundred times more beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat folly,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Anne of Austria, who had not the courage to find\r\nfault with the duke for having so well preserved her portrait in his\r\nheart, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat folly to feed a useless passion with such remembrances!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd upon what then must I live? I have nothing but memory. It is my\r\nhappiness, my treasure, my hope. Every time I see you is a fresh\r\ndiamond which I enclose in the casket of my heart. This is the fourth\r\nwhich you have let fall and I have picked up; for in three years,\r\nmadame, I have only seen you four times\xe2\x80\x94the first, which I have\r\ndescribed to you; the second, at the mansion of Madame de Chevreuse;\r\nthe third, in the gardens of Amiens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuke,\xe2\x80\x9d said the queen, blushing, \xe2\x80\x9cnever speak of that evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, let us speak of it; on the contrary, let us speak of it! That is\r\nthe most happy and brilliant evening of my life! You remember what a\r\nbeautiful night it was? How soft and perfumed was the air; how lovely\r\nthe blue heavens and star-enameled sky! Ah, then, madame, I was able\r\nfor one instant to be alone with you. Then you were about to tell me\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94the isolation of your life, the griefs of your heart. You leaned\r\nupon my arm\xe2\x80\x94upon this, madame! I felt, in bending my head toward you,\r\nyour beautiful hair touch my cheek; and every time that it touched me I\r\ntrembled from head to foot. Oh, Queen! Queen! You do not know what\r\nfelicity from heaven, what joys from paradise, are comprised in a\r\nmoment like that. Take my wealth, my fortune, my glory, all the days I\r\nhave to live, for such an instant, for a night like that. For that\r\nnight, madame, that night you loved me, I will swear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord, yes; it is possible that the influence of the place, the\r\ncharm of the beautiful evening, the fascination of your look\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nthousand circumstances, in short, which sometimes unite to destroy a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x94were grouped around me on that fatal evening; but, my Lord, you\r\nsaw the queen come to the aid of the woman who faltered. At the first\r\nword you dared to utter, at the first freedom to which I had to reply,\r\nI called for help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, that is true. And any other love but mine would have sunk\r\nbeneath this ordeal; but my love came out from it more ardent and more\r\neternal. You believed that you would fly from me by returning to Paris;\r\nyou believed that I would not dare to quit the treasure over which my\r\nmaster had charged me to watch. What to me were all the treasures in\r\nthe world, or all the kings of the earth! Eight days after, I was back\r\nagain, madame. That time you had nothing to say to me; I had risked my\r\nlife and favor to see you but for a second. I did not even touch your\r\nhand, and you pardoned me on seeing me so submissive and so repentant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but calumny seized upon all those follies in which I took no\r\npart, as you well know, my Lord. The king, excited by the cardinal,\r\nmade a terrible clamor. Madame de Vernet was driven from me, Putange\r\nwas exiled, Madame de Chevreuse fell into disgrace, and when you wished\r\nto come back as ambassador to France, the king himself\xe2\x80\x94remember, my\r\nlord\xe2\x80\x94the king himself opposed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and France is about to pay for her king\xe2\x80\x99s refusal with a war. I\r\nam not allowed to see you, madame, but you shall every day hear of me.\r\nWhat object, think you, have this expedition to R\xc3\xa9 and this league with\r\nthe Protestants of La Rochelle which I am projecting? The pleasure of\r\nseeing you. I have no hope of penetrating, sword in hand, to Paris, I\r\nknow that well. But this war may bring round a peace; this peace will\r\nrequire a negotiator; that negotiator will be me. They will not dare to\r\nrefuse me then; and I will return to Paris, and will see you again, and\r\nwill be happy for an instant. Thousands of men, it is true, will have\r\nto pay for my happiness with their lives; but what is that to me,\r\nprovided I see you again! All this is perhaps folly\xe2\x80\x94perhaps insanity;\r\nbut tell me what woman has a lover more truly in love; what queen a\r\nservant more ardent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord, my Lord, you invoke in your defense things which accuse you\r\nmore strongly. All these proofs of love which you would give me are\r\nalmost crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you do not love me, madame! If you loved me, you would view\r\nall this otherwise. If you loved me, oh, if you loved me, that would be\r\ntoo great happiness, and I should run mad. Ah, Madame de Chevreuse was\r\nless cruel than you. Holland loved her, and she responded to his love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Chevreuse was not queen,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Anne of Austria,\r\novercome, in spite of herself, by the expression of so profound a\r\npassion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would love me, then, if you were not queen! Madame, say that you\r\nwould love me then! I can believe that it is the dignity of your rank\r\nalone which makes you cruel to me; I can believe that, had you been\r\nMadame de Chevreuse, poor Buckingham might have hoped. Thanks for those\r\nsweet words! Oh, my beautiful sovereign, a hundred times, thanks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my Lord! You have ill understood, wrongly interpreted; I did not\r\nmean to say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence, silence!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the duke. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I am happy in an error, do not\r\nhave the cruelty to lift me from it. You have told me yourself, madame,\r\nthat I have been drawn into a snare; I, perhaps, may leave my life in\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94for, although it may be strange, I have for some time had a\r\npresentiment that I should shortly die.\xe2\x80\x9d And the duke smiled, with a\r\nsmile at once sad and charming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne of Austria, with an accent of terror which\r\nproved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she\r\nventured to tell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not tell you this, madame, to terrify you; no, it is even\r\nridiculous for me to name it to you, and, believe me, I take no heed of\r\nsuch dreams. But the words you have just spoken, the hope you have\r\nalmost given me, will have richly paid all\xe2\x80\x94were it my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cI also, duke, have had presentiments; I also\r\nhave had dreams. I dreamed that I saw you lying bleeding, wounded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the left side, was it not, and with a knife?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted\r\nBuckingham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was so, my Lord, it was so\xe2\x80\x94in the left side, and with a knife.\r\nWho can possibly have told you I had had that dream? I have imparted it\r\nto no one but my God, and that in my prayers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask for no more. You love me, madame; it is enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you, I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. Would God send the same dreams to you as to me if you did\r\nnot love me? Should we have the same presentiments if our existences\r\ndid not touch at the heart? You love me, my beautiful queen, and you\r\nwill weep for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne of Austria, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is more than I can\r\nbear. In the name of heaven, Duke, leave me, go! I do not know whether\r\nI love you or love you not; but what I know is that I will not be\r\nperjured. Take pity on me, then, and go! Oh, if you are struck in\r\nFrance, if you die in France, if I could imagine that your love for me\r\nwas the cause of your death, I could not console myself; I should run\r\nmad. Depart then, depart, I implore you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how beautiful you are thus! Oh, how I love you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, go, I implore you, and return hereafter! Come back as ambassador,\r\ncome back as minister, come back surrounded with guards who will defend\r\nyou, with servants who will watch over you, and then I shall no longer\r\nfear for your days, and I shall be happy in seeing you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, is this true what you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, then, some pledge of your indulgence, some object which came from\r\nyou, and may remind me that I have not been dreaming; something you\r\nhave worn, and that I may wear in my turn\xe2\x80\x94a ring, a necklace, a chain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you depart\xe2\x80\x94will you depart, if I give you that you demand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis very instant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will leave France, you will return to England?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, I swear to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, then, wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne of Austria re-entered her apartment, and came out again almost\r\nimmediately, holding a rosewood casket in her hand, with her cipher\r\nencrusted with gold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, my Lord, here,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9ckeep this in memory of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBuckingham took the casket, and fell a second time on his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have promised me to go,\xe2\x80\x9d said the queen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I keep my word. Your hand, madame, your hand, and I depart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne of Austria stretched forth her hand, closing her eyes, and leaning\r\nwith the other upon Estafania, for she felt that her strength was about\r\nto fail her.\r\n\r\nBuckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand, and\r\nthen rising, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWithin six months, if I am not dead, I shall have\r\nseen you again, madame\xe2\x80\x94even if I have to overturn the world.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nfaithful to the promise he had made, he rushed out of the apartment.\r\n\r\nIn the corridor he met Mme. Bonacieux, who waited for him, and who,\r\nwith the same precautions and the same good luck, conducted him out of\r\nthe Louvre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII.\r\nMONSIEUR BONACIEUX\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was in all this, as may have been observed, one personage\r\nconcerned, of whom, notwithstanding his precarious position, we have\r\nappeared to take but very little notice. This personage was M.\r\nBonacieux, the respectable martyr of the political and amorous\r\nintrigues which entangled themselves so nicely together at this gallant\r\nand chivalric period.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the reader may remember, or may not remember\xe2\x80\x94fortunately\r\nwe have promised not to lose sight of him.\r\n\r\nThe officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the Bastille,\r\nwhere he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading\r\ntheir muskets. Thence, introduced into a half-subterranean gallery, he\r\nbecame, on the part of those who had brought him, the object of the\r\ngrossest insults and the harshest treatment. The officers perceived\r\nthat they had not to deal with a gentleman, and they treated him like a\r\nvery peasant.\r\n\r\nAt the end of half an hour or thereabouts, a clerk came to put an end\r\nto his tortures, but not to his anxiety, by giving the order to conduct\r\nM. Bonacieux to the Chamber of Examination. Ordinarily, prisoners were\r\ninterrogated in their cells; but they did not do so with M. Bonacieux.\r\n\r\nTwo guards attended the mercer who made him traverse a court and enter\r\na corridor in which were three sentinels, opened a door and pushed him\r\nunceremoniously into a low room, where the only furniture was a table,\r\na chair, and a commissary. The commissary was seated in the chair, and\r\nwas writing at the table.\r\n\r\nThe two guards led the prisoner toward the table, and upon a sign from\r\nthe commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear anything.\r\n\r\nThe commissary, who had till this time held his head down over his\r\npapers, looked up to see what sort of person he had to do with. This\r\ncommissary was a man of very repulsive mien, with a pointed nose, with\r\nyellow and salient cheek bones, with eyes small but keen and\r\npenetrating, and an expression of countenance resembling at once the\r\npolecat and the fox. His head, supported by a long and flexible neck,\r\nissued from his large black robe, balancing itself with a motion very\r\nmuch like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his shell. He\r\nbegan by asking M. Bonacieux his name, age, condition, and abode.\r\n\r\nThe accused replied that his name was Jacques Michel Bonacieux, that he\r\nwas fifty-one years old, a retired mercer, and lived Rue des\r\nFossoyeurs, No. 14.\r\n\r\nThe commissary then, instead of continuing to interrogate him, made him\r\na long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle\r\nwith public matters. He complicated this exordium by an exposition in\r\nwhich he painted the power and the deeds of the cardinal, that\r\nincomparable minister, that conqueror of past ministers, that example\r\nfor ministers to come\xe2\x80\x94deeds and power which none could thwart with\r\nimpunity.\r\n\r\nAfter this second part of his discourse, fixing his hawk\xe2\x80\x99s eye upon\r\npoor Bonacieux, he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his situation.\r\n\r\nThe reflections of the mercer were already made; he cursed the instant\r\nwhen M. Laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter, and\r\nparticularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as Lady\r\nof the Linen to her Majesty.\r\n\r\nAt bottom the character of M. Bonacieux was one of profound selfishness\r\nmixed with sordid avarice, the whole seasoned with extreme cowardice.\r\nThe love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary\r\nsentiment, and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive\r\nfeelings we have just enumerated. Bonacieux indeed reflected on what\r\nhad just been said to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Monsieur Commissary,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cbelieve that I know and\r\nappreciate, more than anybody, the merit of the incomparable eminence\r\nby whom we have the honor to be governed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the commissary, with an air of doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that is\r\nreally so, how came you in the Bastille?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I came there, or rather why I am there,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nis entirely impossible for me to tell you, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know myself;\r\nbut to a certainty it is not for having, knowingly at least, disobliged\r\nMonsieur the Cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must, nevertheless, have committed a crime, since you are here and\r\nare accused of high treason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf high treason!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bonacieux, terrified; \xe2\x80\x9cof high treason! How is\r\nit possible for a poor mercer, who detests Huguenots and who abhors\r\nSpaniards, to be accused of high treason? Consider, monsieur, the thing\r\nis absolutely impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Bonacieux,\xe2\x80\x9d said the commissary, looking at the accused as if\r\nhis little eyes had the faculty of reading to the very depths of\r\nhearts, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have a wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the mercer, in a tremble, feeling that it was\r\nat this point affairs were likely to become perplexing; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is to\r\nsay, I _had_ one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you \xe2\x80\x98_had_ one\xe2\x80\x99? What have you done with her, then, if you have\r\nher no longer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have abducted her, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have abducted her? Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBonacieux inferred from this \xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x9d that the affair grew more and more\r\nintricate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have abducted her,\xe2\x80\x9d added the commissary; \xe2\x80\x9cand do you know the\r\nman who has committed this deed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I know him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember that I affirm nothing, Monsieur the Commissary, and that I\r\nonly suspect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom do you suspect? Come, answer freely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Bonacieux was in the greatest perplexity possible. Had he better\r\ndeny everything or tell everything? By denying all, it might be\r\nsuspected that he must know too much to avow; by confessing all he\r\nmight prove his good will. He decided, then, to tell all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suspect,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9ca tall, dark man, of lofty carriage, who has the\r\nair of a great lord. He has followed us several times, as I think, when\r\nI have waited for my wife at the wicket of the Louvre to escort her\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe commissary now appeared to experience a little uneasiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd his name?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, as to his name, I know nothing about it; but if I were ever to\r\nmeet him, I should recognize him in an instant, I will answer for it,\r\nwere he among a thousand persons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe face of the commissary grew still darker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should recognize him among a thousand, say you?\xe2\x80\x9d continued he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bonacieux, who saw he had taken a false step,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat is to say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have answered that you should recognize him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the commissary.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all very well, and enough for today; before we proceed\r\nfurther, someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your\r\nwife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have not told you that I know him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bonacieux, in despair.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you, on the contrary\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake away the prisoner,\xe2\x80\x9d said the commissary to the two guards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere must we place him?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the chief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a dungeon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord! In the first one handy, provided it is safe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ncommissary, with an indifference which penetrated poor Bonacieux with\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, alas!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cmisfortune is over my head; my wife\r\nmust have committed some frightful crime. They believe me her\r\naccomplice, and will punish me with her. She must have spoken; she must\r\nhave confessed everything\xe2\x80\x94a woman is so weak! A dungeon! The first he\r\ncomes to! That\xe2\x80\x99s it! A night is soon passed; and tomorrow to the wheel,\r\nto the gallows! Oh, my God, my God, have pity on me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout listening the least in the world to the lamentations of M.\r\nBonacieux\xe2\x80\x94lamentations to which, besides, they must have been pretty\r\nwell accustomed\xe2\x80\x94the two guards took the prisoner each by an arm, and\r\nled him away, while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and\r\ndispatched it by an officer in waiting.\r\n\r\nBonacieux could not close his eyes; not because his dungeon was so very\r\ndisagreeable, but because his uneasiness was so great. He sat all night\r\non his stool, starting at the least noise; and when the first rays of\r\nthe sun penetrated into his chamber, the dawn itself appeared to him to\r\nhave taken funereal tints.\r\n\r\nAll at once he heard his bolts drawn, and made a terrified bound. He\r\nbelieved they were come to conduct him to the scaffold; so that when he\r\nsaw merely and simply, instead of the executioner he expected, only his\r\ncommissary of the preceding evening, attended by his clerk, he was\r\nready to embrace them both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour affair has become more complicated since yesterday evening, my\r\ngood man, and I advise you to tell the whole truth; for your repentance\r\nalone can remove the anger of the cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I am ready to tell everything,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cat least, all\r\nthat I know. Interrogate me, I entreat you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your wife, in the first place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, did not I tell you she had been stolen from me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but yesterday at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon, thanks to you,\r\nshe escaped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife escaped!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bonacieux. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, unfortunate creature!\r\nMonsieur, if she has escaped, it is not my fault, I swear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat business had you, then, to go into the chamber of Monsieur\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, your neighbor, with whom you had a long conference during\r\nthe day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes, Monsieur Commissary; yes, that is true, and I confess that I\r\nwas in the wrong. I did go to Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the aim of that visit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo beg him to assist me in finding my wife. I believed I had a right\r\nto endeavor to find her. I was deceived, as it appears, and I ask your\r\npardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan reply?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan promised me his assistance; but I soon found out\r\nthat he was betraying me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou impose upon justice. Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan made a compact with you;\r\nand in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested\r\nyour wife, and has placed her beyond reach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM. d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan has abducted my wife! Come now, what are you telling\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFortunately, Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan is in our hands, and you shall be\r\nconfronted with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my faith, I ask no better,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bonacieux; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be sorry\r\nto see the face of an acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring in the Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said the commissary to the guards.\r\nThe two guards led in Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said the commissary, addressing Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cdeclare\r\nall that passed yesterday between you and Monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is not Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan whom you show\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Not Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the commissary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bonacieux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the commissary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you never see him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have seen him, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he calls himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour name?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the commissary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAthos,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Musketeer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is not a man\xe2\x80\x99s name; that is the name of a mountain,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nthe poor questioner, who began to lose his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you said that your name was D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho, I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody said to me, \xe2\x80\x98You are Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan?\xe2\x80\x99 I answered, \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nthink so?\xe2\x80\x99 My guards exclaimed that they were sure of it. I did not\r\nwish to contradict them; besides, I might be deceived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, you insult the majesty of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, monsieur, that you say it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I tell you, Monsieur Commissary,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bonacieux, in his turn,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere is not the least doubt about the matter. Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan is\r\nmy tenant, although he does not pay me my rent\xe2\x80\x94and even better on that\r\naccount ought I to know him. Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan is a young man,\r\nscarcely nineteen or twenty, and this gentleman must be thirty at\r\nleast. Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan is in Monsieur Dessessart\xe2\x80\x99s Guards, and this\r\ngentleman is in the company of Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s Musketeers. Look\r\nat his uniform, Monsieur Commissary, look at his uniform!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the commissary; \xe2\x80\x9c_pardieu_, that\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door was opened quickly, and a messenger, introduced\r\nby one of the gatekeepers of the Bastille, gave a letter to the\r\ncommissary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, unhappy woman!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the commissary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? What do you say? Of whom do you speak? It is not of my wife, I\r\nhope!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, it is of her. Yours is a pretty business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said the agitated mercer, \xe2\x80\x9cdo me the pleasure, monsieur, to tell\r\nme how my own proper affair can become worse by anything my wife does\r\nwhile I am in prison?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause that which she does is part of a plan concerted between you\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nan infernal plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear to you, Monsieur Commissary, that you are in the profoundest\r\nerror, that I know nothing in the world about what my wife had to do,\r\nthat I am entirely a stranger to what she has done; and that if she has\r\ncommitted any follies, I renounce her, I abjure her, I curse her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos to the commissary, \xe2\x80\x9cif you have no more need of me,\r\nsend me somewhere. Your Monsieur Bonacieux is very tiresome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe commissary designated by the same gesture Athos and Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nthem be guarded more closely than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, with his habitual calmness, \xe2\x80\x9cif it be Monsieur\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan who is concerned in this matter, I do not perceive how I can\r\ntake his place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo as I bade you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the commissary, \xe2\x80\x9cand preserve absolute\r\nsecrecy. You understand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos shrugged his shoulders, and followed his guards silently, while\r\nM. Bonacieux uttered lamentations enough to break the heart of a tiger.\r\n\r\nThey locked the mercer in the same dungeon where he had passed the\r\nnight, and left him to himself during the day. Bonacieux wept all day,\r\nlike a true mercer, not being at all a military man, as he himself\r\ninformed us. In the evening, about nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, at the moment he had\r\nmade up his mind to go to bed, he heard steps in his corridor. These\r\nsteps drew near to his dungeon, the door was thrown open, and the\r\nguards appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFollow me,\xe2\x80\x9d said an officer, who came up behind the guards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFollow you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cfollow you at this hour! Where, my\r\nGod?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere we have orders to lead you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is not an answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, nevertheless, the only one we can give.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my God, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the poor mercer, \xe2\x80\x9cnow, indeed, I am\r\nlost!\xe2\x80\x9d And he followed the guards who came for him, mechanically and\r\nwithout resistance.\r\n\r\nHe passed along the same corridor as before, crossed one court, then a\r\nsecond side of a building; at length, at the gate of the entrance court\r\nhe found a carriage surrounded by four guards on horseback. They made\r\nhim enter this carriage, the officer placed himself by his side, the\r\ndoor was locked, and they were left in a rolling prison. The carriage\r\nwas put in motion as slowly as a funeral car. Through the closely\r\nfastened windows the prisoner could perceive the houses and the\r\npavement, that was all; but, true Parisian as he was, Bonacieux could\r\nrecognize every street by the milestones, the signs, and the lamps. At\r\nthe moment of arriving at St. Paul\xe2\x80\x94the spot where such as were\r\ncondemned at the Bastille were executed\xe2\x80\x94he was near fainting and\r\ncrossed himself twice. He thought the carriage was about to stop there.\r\nThe carriage, however, passed on.\r\n\r\nFarther on, a still greater terror seized him on passing by the\r\ncemetery of St. Jean, where state criminals were buried. One thing,\r\nhowever, reassured him; he remembered that before they were buried\r\ntheir heads were generally cut off, and he felt that his head was still\r\non his shoulders. But when he saw the carriage take the way to La\r\nGr\xc3\xaave, when he perceived the pointed roof of the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville, and\r\nthe carriage passed under the arcade, he believed it was over with him.\r\nHe wished to confess to the officer, and upon his refusal, uttered such\r\npitiable cries that the officer told him that if he continued to deafen\r\nhim thus, he should put a gag in his mouth.\r\n\r\nThis measure somewhat reassured Bonacieux. If they meant to execute him\r\nat La Gr\xc3\xaave, it could scarcely be worth while to gag him, as they had\r\nnearly reached the place of execution. Indeed, the carriage crossed the\r\nfatal spot without stopping. There remained, then, no other place to\r\nfear but the Traitor\xe2\x80\x99s Cross; the carriage was taking the direct road\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nThis time there was no longer any doubt; it was at the Traitor\xe2\x80\x99s Cross\r\nthat lesser criminals were executed. Bonacieux had flattered himself in\r\nbelieving himself worthy of St. Paul or of the Place de Gr\xc3\xaave; it was\r\nat the Traitor\xe2\x80\x99s Cross that his journey and his destiny were about to\r\nend! He could not yet see that dreadful cross, but he felt somehow as\r\nif it were coming to meet him. When he was within twenty paces of it,\r\nhe heard a noise of people and the carriage stopped. This was more than\r\npoor Bonacieux could endure, depressed as he was by the successive\r\nemotions which he had experienced; he uttered a feeble groan which\r\nmight have been taken for the last sigh of a dying man, and fainted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV.\r\nTHE MAN OF MEUNG\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crowd was caused, not by the expectation of a man to be hanged, but\r\nby the contemplation of a man who was hanged.\r\n\r\nThe carriage, which had been stopped for a minute, resumed its way,\r\npassed through the crowd, threaded the Rue St. Honor\xc3\xa9, turned into the\r\nRue des Bons Enfants, and stopped before a low door.\r\n\r\nThe door opened; two guards received Bonacieux in their arms from the\r\nofficer who supported him. They carried him through an alley, up a\r\nflight of stairs, and deposited him in an antechamber.\r\n\r\nAll these movements had been effected mechanically, as far as he was\r\nconcerned. He had walked as one walks in a dream; he had a glimpse of\r\nobjects as through a fog. His ears had perceived sounds without\r\ncomprehending them; he might have been executed at that moment without\r\nhis making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to\r\nimplore mercy.\r\n\r\nHe remained on the bench, with his back leaning against the wall and\r\nhis hands hanging down, exactly on the spot where the guards placed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOn looking around him, however, as he could perceive no threatening\r\nobject, as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger, as the bench\r\nwas comfortably covered with a well-stuffed cushion, as the wall was\r\nornamented with a beautiful Cordova leather, and as large red damask\r\ncurtains, fastened back by gold clasps, floated before the window, he\r\nperceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated, and he began to\r\nturn his head to the right and the left, upward and downward.\r\n\r\nAt this movement, which nobody opposed, he resumed a little courage,\r\nand ventured to draw up one leg and then the other. At length, with the\r\nhelp of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench, and found\r\nhimself on his feet.\r\n\r\nAt this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door, continued\r\nto exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came\r\nup to the prisoner. \xe2\x80\x9cIs your name Bonacieux?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Monsieur Officer,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered the mercer, more dead than alive,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cat your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer.\r\n\r\nAnd he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass. The latter obeyed\r\nwithout reply, and entered the chamber, where he appeared to be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nIt was a large cabinet, close and stifling, with the walls furnished\r\nwith arms offensive and defensive, and in which there was already a\r\nfire, although it was scarcely the end of the month of September. A\r\nsquare table, covered with books and papers, upon which was unrolled an\r\nimmense plan of the city of La Rochelle, occupied the center of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nStanding before the chimney was a man of middle height, of a haughty,\r\nproud mien; with piercing eyes, a large brow, and a thin face, which\r\nwas made still longer by a _royal_ (or _imperial_, as it is now\r\ncalled), surmounted by a pair of mustaches. Although this man was\r\nscarcely thirty-six or thirty-seven years of age, hair, mustaches, and\r\nroyal, all began to be gray. This man, except a sword, had all the\r\nappearance of a soldier; and his buff boots, still slightly covered\r\nwith dust, indicated that he had been on horseback in the course of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThis man was Armand Jean Duplessis, Cardinal de Richelieu; not such as\r\nhe is now represented\xe2\x80\x94broken down like an old man, suffering like a\r\nmartyr, his body bent, his voice failing, buried in a large armchair as\r\nin an anticipated tomb; no longer living but by the strength of his\r\ngenius, and no longer maintaining the struggle with Europe but by the\r\neternal application of his thoughts\xe2\x80\x94but such as he really was at this\r\nperiod; that is to say, an active and gallant cavalier, already weak of\r\nbody, but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the\r\nmost extraordinary men that ever lived, preparing, after having\r\nsupported the Duc de Nevers in his duchy of Mantua, after having taken\r\nN\xc3\xaemes, Castres, and Uzes, to drive the English from the Isle of R\xc3\xa9 and\r\nlay siege to La Rochelle.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, nothing denoted the cardinal; and it was impossible for\r\nthose who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were.\r\n\r\nThe poor mercer remained standing at the door, while the eyes of the\r\npersonage we have just described were fixed upon him, and appeared to\r\nwish to penetrate even into the depths of the past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this that Bonacieux?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he, after a moment of silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s well. Give me those papers, and leave us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe officer took from the table the papers pointed out, gave them to\r\nhim who asked for them, bowed to the ground, and retired.\r\n\r\nBonacieux recognized in these papers his interrogatories of the\r\nBastille. From time to time the man by the chimney raised his eyes from\r\nthe writings, and plunged them like poniards into the heart of the poor\r\nmercer.\r\n\r\nAt the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination,\r\nthe cardinal was satisfied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat head has never conspired,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it matters not; we\r\nwill see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are accused of high treason,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I have been told already, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bonacieux, giving his\r\ninterrogator the title he had heard the officer give him, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I swear\r\nto you that I know nothing about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cardinal repressed a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have conspired with your wife, with Madame de Chevreuse, and with\r\nmy Lord Duke of Buckingham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d responded the mercer, \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard her\r\npronounce all those names.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd on what occasion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said that the Cardinal de Richelieu had drawn the Duke of\r\nBuckingham to Paris to ruin him and to ruin the queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said that?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the cardinal, with violence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monseigneur, but I told her she was wrong to talk about such\r\nthings; and that his Eminence was incapable\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue! You are stupid,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what my wife said, monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know who carried off your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have suspicions, nevertheless?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monseigneur; but these suspicions appeared to be disagreeable to\r\nMonsieur the Commissary, and I no longer have them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour wife has escaped. Did you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monseigneur. I learned it since I have been in prison, and that\r\nfrom the conversation of Monsieur the Commissary\xe2\x80\x94an amiable man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cardinal repressed another smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her\r\nflight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely, monseigneur; but she has most likely returned to the\r\nLouvre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt one o\xe2\x80\x99clock this morning she had not returned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God! What can have become of her, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall know, be assured. Nothing is concealed from the cardinal; the\r\ncardinal knows everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, monseigneur, do you believe the cardinal will be so kind\r\nas to tell me what has become of my wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he may; but you must, in the first place, reveal to the\r\ncardinal all you know of your wife\xe2\x80\x99s relations with Madame de\r\nChevreuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, monseigneur, I know nothing about them; I have never seen her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you went to fetch your wife from the Louvre, did you always\r\nreturn directly home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScarcely ever; she had business to transact with linen drapers, to\r\nwhose houses I conducted her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how many were there of these linen drapers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo, monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where did they live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne in Rue de Vaugirard, the other Rue de la Harpe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you go into these houses with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, monseigneur; I waited at the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what excuse did she give you for entering all alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe gave me none; she told me to wait, and I waited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a very complacent husband, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe calls me his dear Monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mercer to himself. \xe2\x80\x9c_Peste!_\r\nMatters are going all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you know those doors again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the numbers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. 25 in the Rue de Vaugirard; 75 in the Rue de la Harpe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal.\r\n\r\nAt these words he took up a silver bell, and rang it; the officer\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in a subdued voice, \xe2\x80\x9cand find Rochefort. Tell him to\r\ncome to me immediately, if he has returned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe count is here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, \xe2\x80\x9cand requests to speak with your\r\nEminence instantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him come in, then!\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, quickly.\r\n\r\nThe officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all\r\nthe servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo your Eminence!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Bonacieux, rolling his eyes round in\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\nFive seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the\r\nofficer, when the door opened, and a new personage entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is he!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bonacieux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe! What he?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man who abducted my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cardinal rang a second time. The officer reappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlace this man in the care of his guards again, and let him wait till\r\nI send for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monseigneur, no, it is not he!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bonacieux; \xe2\x80\x9cno, I was\r\ndeceived. This is quite another man, and does not resemble him at all.\r\nMonsieur is, I am sure, an honest man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake away that fool!\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal.\r\n\r\nThe officer took Bonacieux by the arm, and led him into the\r\nantechamber, where he found his two guards.\r\n\r\nThe newly introduced personage followed Bonacieux impatiently with his\r\neyes till he had gone out; and the moment the door closed, \xe2\x80\x9cThey have\r\nseen each other;\xe2\x80\x9d said he, approaching the cardinal eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his Eminence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe and she.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe queen and the duke?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Richelieu.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the Louvre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Lannoy, who is devoted to your Eminence, as you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did she not let me know sooner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether by chance or mistrust, the queen made Madame de Surgis sleep\r\nin her chamber, and detained her all day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we are beaten! Now let us try to take our revenge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will assist you with all my heart, monseigneur; be assured of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did it come about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt half past twelve the queen was with her women\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn her bedchamber\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen someone came and brought her a handkerchief from her laundress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe queen immediately exhibited strong emotion; and despite the rouge\r\nwith which her face was covered evidently turned pale\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, and then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe then arose, and with altered voice, \xe2\x80\x98Ladies,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98wait for\r\nme ten minutes, I shall soon return.\xe2\x80\x99 She then opened the door of her\r\nalcove, and went out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did not Madame de Lannoy come and inform you instantly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing was certain; besides, her Majesty had said, \xe2\x80\x98Ladies, wait for\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x99 and she did not dare to disobey the queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long did the queen remain out of the chamber?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree-quarters of an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of her women accompanied her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly Donna Estafania.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she afterward return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but only to take a little rosewood casket, with her cipher upon\r\nit, and went out again immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when she finally returned, did she bring that casket with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Madame de Lannoy know what was in that casket?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; the diamond studs which his Majesty gave the queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she came back without this casket?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Lannoy, then, is of opinion that she gave them to\r\nBuckingham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can she be so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the course of the day Madame de Lannoy, in her quality of\r\ntire-woman of the queen, looked for this casket, appeared uneasy at not\r\nfinding it, and at length asked information of the queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then the queen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe queen became exceedingly red, and replied that having in the\r\nevening broken one of those studs, she had sent it to her goldsmith to\r\nbe repaired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be called upon, and so ascertain if the thing be true or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just been with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the goldsmith?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe goldsmith has heard nothing of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well! Rochefort, all is not lost; and perhaps\xe2\x80\x94perhaps everything\r\nis for the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is that I do not doubt your Eminence\xe2\x80\x99s genius\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill repair the blunders of his agent\xe2\x80\x94is that it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is exactly what I was going to say, if your Eminence had let me\r\nfinish my sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile, do you know where the Duchesse de Chevreuse and the Duke of\r\nBuckingham are now concealed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monseigneur; my people could tell me nothing on that head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, monseigneur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; or at least I guess. They were, one in the Rue de Vaugirard, No.\r\n25; the other in the Rue de la Harpe, No. 75.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes your Eminence command that they both be instantly arrested?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be too late; they will be gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut still, we can make sure that they are so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake ten men of my Guardsmen, and search the two houses thoroughly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstantly, monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d And Rochefort went hastily out of the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal, being left alone, reflected for an instant and then rang\r\nthe bell a third time. The same officer appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring the prisoner in again,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal.\r\n\r\nM. Bonacieux was introduced afresh, and upon a sign from the cardinal,\r\nthe officer retired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have deceived me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cI deceive your Eminence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour wife, in going to Rue de Vaugirard and Rue de la Harpe, did not\r\ngo to find linen drapers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why did she go, just God?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe went to meet the Duchesse de Chevreuse and the Duke of\r\nBuckingham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bonacieux, recalling all his remembrances of the\r\ncircumstances, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. Your Eminence is right. I told my wife\r\nseveral times that it was surprising that linen drapers should live in\r\nsuch houses as those, in houses that had no signs; but she always\r\nlaughed at me. Ah, monseigneur!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Bonacieux, throwing himself\r\nat his Eminence\xe2\x80\x99s feet, \xe2\x80\x9cah, how truly you are the cardinal, the great\r\ncardinal, the man of genius whom all the world reveres!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cardinal, however contemptible might be the triumph gained over so\r\nvulgar a being as Bonacieux, did not the less enjoy it for an instant;\r\nthen, almost immediately, as if a fresh thought has occurred, a smile\r\nplayed upon his lips, and he said, offering his hand to the mercer,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise, my friend, you are a worthy man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cardinal has touched me with his hand! I have touched the hand of\r\nthe great man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bonacieux. \xe2\x80\x9cThe great man has called me his\r\nfriend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my friend, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, with that paternal tone which\r\nhe sometimes knew how to assume, but which deceived none who knew him;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand as you have been unjustly suspected, well, you must be\r\nindemnified. Here, take this purse of a hundred pistoles, and pardon\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pardon you, monseigneur!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bonacieux, hesitating to take the\r\npurse, fearing, doubtless, that this pretended gift was but a\r\npleasantry. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you are able to have me arrested, you are able to have\r\nme tortured, you are able to have me hanged; you are the master, and I\r\ncould not have the least word to say. Pardon you, monseigneur! You\r\ncannot mean that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux, you are generous in this matter. I see\r\nit and I thank you for it. Thus, then, you will take this bag, and you\r\nwill go away without being too malcontent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go away enchanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, then, or rather, _au revoir_, for I hope we shall meet\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever Monseigneur wishes, I am always at at his Eminence\xe2\x80\x99s orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be frequently, I assure you, for I have found something\r\nextremely agreeable in your conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Monseigneur!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Au revoir_, Monsieur Bonacieux, _au revoir!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the cardinal made him a sign with his hand, to which Bonacieux\r\nreplied by bowing to the ground. He then went out backward, and when he\r\nwas in the antechamber the cardinal heard him, in his enthusiasm,\r\ncrying aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cLong life to the Monseigneur! Long life to his Eminence!\r\nLong life to the great cardinal!\xe2\x80\x9d The cardinal listened with a smile to\r\nthis vociferous manifestation of the feelings of M. Bonacieux; and\r\nthen, when Bonacieux\xe2\x80\x99s cries were no longer audible, \xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat man would henceforward lay down his life for me.\xe2\x80\x9d And the\r\ncardinal began to examine with the greatest attention the map of La\r\nRochelle, which, as we have said, lay open on the desk, tracing with a\r\npencil the line in which the famous dyke was to pass which, eighteen\r\nmonths later, shut up the port of the besieged city. As he was in the\r\ndeepest of his strategic meditations, the door opened, and Rochefort\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, eagerly, rising with a promptitude which\r\nproved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with\r\nwhich he had charged the count.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter, \xe2\x80\x9ca young woman of about twenty-six or\r\ntwenty-eight years of age, and a man of from thirty-five to forty, have\r\nindeed lodged at the two houses pointed out by your Eminence; but the\r\nwoman left last night, and the man this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was they!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the cardinal, looking at the clock; \xe2\x80\x9cand now it is\r\ntoo late to have them pursued. The duchess is at Tours, and the duke at\r\nBoulogne. It is in London they must be found.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are your Eminence\xe2\x80\x99s orders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word of what has passed. Let the queen remain in perfect\r\nsecurity; let her be ignorant that we know her secret. Let her believe\r\nthat we are in search of some conspiracy or other. Send me the keeper\r\nof the seals, S\xc3\xa9guier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that man, what has your Eminence done with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat man?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Bonacieux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done with him all that could be done. I have made him a spy\r\nupon his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the\r\nsuperiority of the master as great, and retired.\r\n\r\nLeft alone, the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter, which\r\nhe secured with his special seal. Then he rang. The officer entered for\r\nthe fourth time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell Vitray to come to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell him to get ready for a\r\njourney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn instant after, the man he asked for was before him, booted and\r\nspurred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVitray,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will go with all speed to London. You must not\r\nstop an instant on the way. You will deliver this letter to Milady.\r\nHere is an order for two hundred pistoles; call upon my treasurer and\r\nget the money. You shall have as much again if you are back within six\r\ndays, and have executed your commission well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe messenger, without replying a single word, bowed, took the letter,\r\nwith the order for the two hundred pistoles, and retired.\r\n\r\nHere is what the letter contained:\r\n\r\nMILADY, Be at the first ball at which the Duke of Buckingham shall be\r\npresent. He will wear on his doublet twelve diamond studs; get as near\r\nto him as you can, and cut off two.\r\n\r\nAs soon as these studs shall be in your possession, inform me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV.\r\nMEN OF THE ROBE AND MEN OF THE SWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day after these events had taken place, Athos not having\r\nreappeared, M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville was informed by D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and Porthos of\r\nthe circumstance. As to Aramis, he had asked for leave of absence for\r\nfive days, and was gone, it was said, to Rouen on family business.\r\n\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville was the father of his soldiers. The lowest or the least\r\nknown of them, as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company, was as\r\nsure of his aid and support as if he had been his own brother.\r\n\r\nHe repaired, then, instantly to the office of the\r\n_lieutenant-criminel_. The officer who commanded the post of the Red\r\nCross was sent for, and by successive inquiries they learned that Athos\r\nwas then lodged in Fort l\xe2\x80\x99Ev\xc3\xaaque.\r\n\r\nAthos had passed through all the examinations we have seen Bonacieux\r\nundergo.\r\n\r\nWe were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted\r\nwith each other. Athos, who had till that time said nothing for fear\r\nthat D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, interrupted in his turn, should not have the time\r\nnecessary, from this moment declared that his name was Athos, and not\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. He added that he did not know either M. or Mme. Bonacieux;\r\nthat he had never spoken to the one or the other; that he had come, at\r\nabout ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, to pay a visit to his friend M.\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, but that till that hour he had been at M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwhere he had dined. \xe2\x80\x9cTwenty witnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, \xe2\x80\x9ccould attest the\r\nfact\xe2\x80\x9d; and he named several distinguished gentlemen, and among them was\r\nM. le Duc de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille.\r\n\r\nThe second commissary was as much bewildered as the first had been by\r\nthe simple and firm declaration of the Musketeer, upon whom he was\r\nanxious to take the revenge which men of the robe like at all times to\r\ngain over men of the sword; but the name of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, and that of\r\nM. de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille, commanded a little reflection.\r\n\r\nAthos was then sent to the cardinal; but unfortunately the cardinal was\r\nat the Louvre with the king.\r\n\r\nIt was precisely at this moment that M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, on leaving the\r\nresidence of the _lieutenant-criminel_ and the governor of Fort\r\nl\xe2\x80\x99Ev\xc3\xaaque without being able to find Athos, arrived at the palace.\r\n\r\nAs captain of the Musketeers, M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville had the right of entry at\r\nall times.\r\n\r\nIt is well known how violent the king\xe2\x80\x99s prejudices were against the\r\nqueen, and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal,\r\nwho in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men.\r\nOne of the grand causes of this prejudice was the friendship of Anne of\r\nAustria for Mme. de Chevreuse. These two women gave him more uneasiness\r\nthan the war with Spain, the quarrel with England, or the embarrassment\r\nof the finances. In his eyes and to his conviction, Mme. de Chevreuse\r\nnot only served the queen in her political intrigues, but, what\r\ntormented him still more, in her amorous intrigues.\r\n\r\nAt the first word the cardinal spoke of Mme. de Chevreuse\xe2\x80\x94who, though\r\nexiled to Tours and believed to be in that city, had come to Paris,\r\nremained there five days, and outwitted the police\xe2\x80\x94the king flew into a\r\nfurious passion. Capricious and unfaithful, the king wished to be\r\ncalled Louis the Just and Louis the Chaste. Posterity will find a\r\ndifficulty in understanding this character, which history explains only\r\nby facts and never by reason.\r\n\r\nBut when the cardinal added that not only Mme. de Chevreuse had been in\r\nParis, but still further, that the queen had renewed with her one of\r\nthose mysterious correspondences which at that time was named a\r\n_cabal;_ when he affirmed that he, the cardinal, was about to unravel\r\nthe most closely twisted thread of this intrigue; that at the moment of\r\narresting in the very act, with all the proofs about her, the queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nemissary to the exiled duchess, a Musketeer had dared to interrupt the\r\ncourse of justice violently, by falling sword in hand upon the honest\r\nmen of the law, charged with investigating impartially the whole affair\r\nin order to place it before the eyes of the king\xe2\x80\x94Louis XIII. could not\r\ncontain himself, and he made a step toward the queen\xe2\x80\x99s apartment with\r\nthat pale and mute indignation which, when it broke out, led this\r\nprince to the commission of the most pitiless cruelty. And yet, in all\r\nthis, the cardinal had not yet said a word about the Duke of\r\nBuckingham.\r\n\r\nAt this instant M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville entered, cool, polite, and in\r\nirreproachable costume.\r\n\r\nInformed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the\r\nalteration in the king\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville felt himself\r\nsomething like Samson before the Philistines.\r\n\r\nLouis XIII. had already placed his hand on the knob of the door; at the\r\nnoise of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s entrance he turned round. \xe2\x80\x9cYou arrive in good\r\ntime, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, who, when his passions were raised to a\r\ncertain point, could not dissemble; \xe2\x80\x9cI have learned some fine things\r\nconcerning your Musketeers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tr\xc3\xa9ville, coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cI have some pretty things to tell your\r\nMajesty concerning these gownsmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, with hauteur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the honor to inform your Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d continued M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, in\r\nthe same tone, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a party of _procureurs_, commissaries, and men of\r\nthe police\xe2\x80\x94very estimable people, but very inveterate, as it appears,\r\nagainst the uniform\xe2\x80\x94have taken upon themselves to arrest in a house, to\r\nlead away through the open street, and throw into Fort l\xe2\x80\x99Ev\xc3\xaaque, all\r\nupon an order which they have refused to show me, one of my, or rather\r\nyour Musketeers, sire, of irreproachable conduct, of an almost\r\nillustrious reputation, and whom your Majesty knows favorably, Monsieur\r\nAthos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAthos,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, mechanically; \xe2\x80\x9cyes, certainly I know that\r\nname.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet your Majesty remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Monsieur Athos is the\r\nMusketeer who, in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with, had\r\nthe misfortune to wound Monsieur de Cahusac so seriously. _A propos_,\r\nmonseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Tr\xc3\xa9ville, addressing the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de\r\nCahusac is quite recovered, is he not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, biting his lips with anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAthos, then, went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the\r\ntime,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cto a young B\xc3\xa9arnais, a cadet in his\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s Guards, the company of Monsieur Dessessart, but scarcely had\r\nhe arrived at his friend\xe2\x80\x99s and taken up a book, while waiting his\r\nreturn, when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege\r\nto the house, broke open several doors\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cardinal made the king a sign, which signified, \xe2\x80\x9cThat was on\r\naccount of the affair about which I spoke to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe all know that,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the king; \xe2\x80\x9cfor all that was done for\r\nour service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cit was also for your Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s service that one\r\nof my Musketeers, who was innocent, has been seized, that he has been\r\nplaced between two guards like a malefactor, and that this gallant man,\r\nwho has ten times shed his blood in your Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s service and is ready\r\nto shed it again, has been paraded through the midst of an insolent\r\npopulace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, who began to be shaken, \xe2\x80\x9cwas it so managed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, with the greatest phlegm,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdoes not tell your Majesty that this innocent Musketeer, this gallant\r\nman, had only an hour before attacked, sword in hand, four commissaries\r\nof inquiry, who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of\r\nthe highest importance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI defy your Eminence to prove it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tr\xc3\xa9ville, with his Gascon\r\nfreedom and military frankness; \xe2\x80\x9cfor one hour before, Monsieur Athos,\r\nwho, I will confide it to your Majesty, is really a man of the highest\r\nquality, did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing\r\nin the saloon of my h\xc3\xb4tel, with the Duc de la Tr\xc3\xa9mouille and the Comte\r\nde Ch\xc3\xa2lus, who happened to be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king looked at the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA written examination attests it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, replying aloud\r\nto the mute interrogation of his Majesty; \xe2\x80\x9cand the ill-treated people\r\nhave drawn up the following, which I have the honor to present to your\r\nMajesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is the written report of the gownsmen to be placed in comparison\r\nwith the word of honor of a swordsman?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Tr\xc3\xa9ville haughtily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, Tr\xc3\xa9ville, hold your tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf his Eminence entertains any suspicion against one of my\r\nMusketeers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cthe justice of Monsieur the Cardinal is so\r\nwell known that I demand an inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the house in which the judicial inquiry was made,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the\r\nimpassive cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cthere lodges, I believe, a young B\xc3\xa9arnais, a\r\nfriend of the Musketeer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Eminence means Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean a young man whom you patronize, Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your Eminence, it is the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not suspect this young man of having given bad counsel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Athos, to a man double his age?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Tr\xc3\xa9ville. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nmonseigneur. Besides, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan passed the evening with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody seems to have passed the evening\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes your Eminence doubt my word?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tr\xc3\xa9ville, with a brow flushed\r\nwith anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, God forbid,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal; \xe2\x80\x9conly, at what hour was he with\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, as to that I can speak positively, your Eminence; for as he came\r\nin I remarked that it was but half past nine by the clock, although I\r\nhad believed it to be later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what hour did he leave your h\xc3\xb4tel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt half past ten\xe2\x80\x94an hour after the event.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cardinal, who could not for an instant suspect the\r\nloyalty of Tr\xc3\xa9ville, and who felt that the victory was escaping him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwell, but Athos _was_ taken in the house in the Rue des Fossoyeurs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs one friend forbidden to visit another, or a Musketeer of my company\r\nto fraternize with a Guard of Dessessart\xe2\x80\x99s company?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, when the house where he fraternizes is suspected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat house is suspected, Tr\xc3\xa9ville,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king; \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps you did\r\nnot know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sire, I did not. The house may be suspected; but I deny that\r\nit is so in the part of it inhabited by Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, for I can\r\naffirm, sire, if I can believe what he says, that there does not exist\r\na more devoted servant of your Majesty, or a more profound admirer of\r\nMonsieur the Cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it not this D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan who wounded Jussac one day, in that\r\nunfortunate encounter which took place near the Convent of the\r\nCarmes-D\xc3\xa9chauss\xc3\xa9s?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the king, looking at the cardinal, who\r\ncolored with vexation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the next day, Bernajoux. Yes, sire, yes, it is the same; and your\r\nMajesty has a good memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, how shall we decide?\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat concerns your Majesty more than me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal. \xe2\x80\x9cI should\r\naffirm the culpability.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I deny it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tr\xc3\xa9ville. \xe2\x80\x9cBut his Majesty has judges, and these\r\njudges will decide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is best,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king. \xe2\x80\x9cSend the case before the judges; it is\r\ntheir business to judge, and they shall judge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a sad thing that in the unfortunate\r\ntimes in which we live, the purest life, the most incontestable virtue,\r\ncannot exempt a man from infamy and persecution. The army, I will\r\nanswer for it, will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous\r\ntreatment on account of police affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe expression was imprudent; but M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville launched it with\r\nknowledge of his cause. He was desirous of an explosion, because in\r\nthat case the mine throws forth fire, and fire enlightens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolice affairs!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the king, taking up Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cpolice\r\naffairs! And what do you know about them, Monsieur? Meddle with your\r\nMusketeers, and do not annoy me in this way. It appears, according to\r\nyour account, that if by mischance a Musketeer is arrested, France is\r\nin danger. What a noise about a Musketeer! I would arrest ten of them,\r\n_ventrebleu_, a hundred, even, all the company, and I would not allow a\r\nwhisper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the moment they are suspected by your Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tr\xc3\xa9ville,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe Musketeers are guilty; therefore, you see me prepared to surrender\r\nmy sword\xe2\x80\x94for after having accused my soldiers, there can be no doubt\r\nthat Monsieur the Cardinal will end by accusing me. It is best to\r\nconstitute myself at once a prisoner with Athos, who is already\r\narrested, and with D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who most probably will be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGascon-headed man, will you have done?\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Tr\xc3\xa9ville, without lowering his voice in the least,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ceither order my Musketeer to be restored to me, or let him be tried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shall be tried,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, so much the better; for in that case I shall demand of his\r\nMajesty permission to plead for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king feared an outbreak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf his Eminence,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cdid not have personal motives\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the instant your Majesty considers me a\r\nprejudiced judge, I withdraw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you swear, by my father, that Athos was at\r\nyour residence during the event and that he took no part in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy your glorious father, and by yourself, whom I love and venerate\r\nabove all the world, I swear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe so kind as to reflect, sire,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we release the\r\nprisoner thus, we shall never know the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAthos may always be found,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cready to answer, when\r\nit shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him. He will not desert,\r\nMonsieur the Cardinal, be assured of that; I will answer for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he will not desert,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king; \xe2\x80\x9che can always be found, as\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville says. Besides,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, lowering his voice and looking with\r\na suppliant air at the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9clet us give them apparent security;\r\nthat is policy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis policy of Louis XIII. made Richelieu smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrder it as you please, sire; you possess the right of pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe right of pardoning only applies to the guilty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tr\xc3\xa9ville, who\r\nwas determined to have the last word, \xe2\x80\x9cand my Musketeer is innocent. It\r\nis not mercy, then, that you are about to accord, sire, it is justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he is in the Fort l\xe2\x80\x99Ev\xc3\xaaque?\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sire, in solitary confinement, in a dungeon, like the lowest\r\ncriminal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the king; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat must be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSign an order for his release, and all will be said,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\ncardinal. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe with your Majesty that Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nguarantee is more than sufficient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville bowed very respectfully, with a joy that was not unmixed with\r\nfear; he would have preferred an obstinate resistance on the part of\r\nthe cardinal to this sudden yielding.\r\n\r\nThe king signed the order for release, and Tr\xc3\xa9ville carried it away\r\nwithout delay. As he was about to leave the presence, the cardinal gave\r\nhim a friendly smile, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cA perfect harmony reigns, sire,\r\nbetween the leaders and the soldiers of your Musketeers, which must be\r\nprofitable for the service and honorable to all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will play me some dog\xe2\x80\x99s trick or other, and that immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville. \xe2\x80\x9cOne has never the last word with such a man. But let us be\r\nquick\xe2\x80\x94the king may change his mind in an hour; and at all events it is\r\nmore difficult to replace a man in the Fort l\xe2\x80\x99Ev\xc3\xaaque or the Bastille\r\nwho has got out, than to keep a prisoner there who is in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville made his entrance triumphantly into the Fort l\xe2\x80\x99Ev\xc3\xaaque,\r\nwhence he delivered the Musketeer, whose peaceful indifference had not\r\nfor a moment abandoned him.\r\n\r\nThe first time he saw D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have come off well,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to\r\nhim; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is your Jussac thrust paid for. There still remains that of\r\nBernajoux, but you must not be too confident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs to the rest, M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal\r\nand to think that all was not over, for scarcely had the captain of the\r\nMusketeers closed the door after him, than his Eminence said to the\r\nking, \xe2\x80\x9cNow that we are at length by ourselves, we will, if your Majesty\r\npleases, converse seriously. Sire, Buckingham has been in Paris five\r\ndays, and only left this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI.\r\nIN WHICH M. S\xc3\x89GUIER, KEEPER OF THE SEALS, LOOKS MORE THAN ONCE FOR THE\r\nBELL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to form an idea of the impression these few words made\r\nupon Louis XIII. He grew pale and red alternately; and the cardinal saw\r\nat once that he had recovered by a single blow all the ground he had\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuckingham in Paris!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9cand why does he come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo conspire, no doubt, with your enemies, the Huguenots and the\r\nSpaniards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, _pardieu_, no! To conspire against my honor with Madame de\r\nChevreuse, Madame de Longueville, and the Cond\xc3\xa9s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sire, what an idea! The queen is too virtuous; and besides, loves\r\nyour Majesty too well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman is weak, Monsieur Cardinal,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king; \xe2\x80\x9cand as to loving me\r\nmuch, I have my own opinion as to that love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI not the less maintain,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Duke of\r\nBuckingham came to Paris for a project wholly political.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am sure that he came for quite another purpose, Monsieur\r\nCardinal; but if the queen be guilty, let her tremble!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever repugnance I may have to\r\ndirecting my mind to such a treason, your Majesty compels me to think\r\nof it. Madame de Lannoy, whom, according to your Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s command, I\r\nhave frequently interrogated, told me this morning that the night\r\nbefore last her Majesty sat up very late, that this morning she wept\r\nmuch, and that she was writing all day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the king; \xe2\x80\x9cto him, no doubt. Cardinal, I must have\r\nthe queen\xe2\x80\x99s papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how to take them, sire? It seems to me that it is neither your\r\nMajesty nor myself who can charge himself with such a mission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did they act with regard to the Mar\xc3\xa9chale d\xe2\x80\x99Ancre?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\nking, in the highest state of choler; \xe2\x80\x9cfirst her closets were\r\nthoroughly searched, and then she herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Mar\xc3\xa9chale d\xe2\x80\x99Ancre was no more than the Mar\xc3\xa9chale d\xe2\x80\x99Ancre. A\r\nFlorentine adventurer, sire, and that was all; while the august spouse\r\nof your Majesty is Anne of Austria, Queen of France\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, one\r\nof the greatest princesses in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not the less guilty, Monsieur Duke! The more she has forgotten\r\nthe high position in which she was placed, the more degrading is her\r\nfall. Besides, I long ago determined to put an end to all these petty\r\nintrigues of policy and love. She has near her a certain Laporte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho, I believe, is the mainspring of all this, I confess,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ncardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think then, as I do, that she deceives me?\xe2\x80\x9d said the king.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe, and I repeat it to your Majesty, that the queen conspires\r\nagainst the power of the king, but I have not said against his honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x94I tell you against both. I tell you the queen does not love me;\r\nI tell you she loves another; I tell you she loves that infamous\r\nBuckingham! Why did you not have him arrested while in Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArrest the Duke! Arrest the prime minister of King Charles I.! Think\r\nof it, sire! What a scandal! And if the suspicions of your Majesty,\r\nwhich I still continue to doubt, should prove to have any foundation,\r\nwhat a terrible disclosure, what a fearful scandal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut as he exposed himself like a vagabond or a thief, he should have\r\nbeen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouis XIII. stopped, terrified at what he was about to say, while\r\nRichelieu, stretching out his neck, waited uselessly for the word which\r\nhad died on the lips of the king.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe should have been\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing. But all the time he was in Paris,\r\nyou, of course, did not lose sight of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did he lodge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRue de la Harpe. No. 75.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the side of the Luxembourg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are certain that the queen and he did not see each other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe the queen to have too high a sense of her duty, sire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they have corresponded; it is to him that the queen has been\r\nwriting all the day. Monsieur Duke, I must have those letters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire, notwithstanding\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Duke, at whatever price it may be, I will have them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would, however, beg your Majesty to observe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, then, also join in betraying me, Monsieur Cardinal, by thus\r\nalways opposing my will? Are you also in accord with Spain and England,\r\nwith Madame de Chevreuse and the queen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cardinal, sighing, \xe2\x80\x9cI believed myself secure from\r\nsuch a suspicion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Cardinal, you have heard me; I will have those letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is but one way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be to charge Monsieur de S\xc3\xa9guier, the keeper of the seals,\r\nwith this mission. The matter enters completely into the duties of the\r\npost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him be sent for instantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is most likely at my h\xc3\xb4tel. I requested him to call, and when I\r\ncame to the Louvre I left orders if he came, to desire him to wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him be sent for instantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s orders shall be executed; but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the queen will perhaps refuse to obey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy orders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if she is ignorant that these orders come from the king.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that she may have no doubt on that head, I will go and inform\r\nher myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Majesty will not forget that I have done everything in my power\r\nto prevent a rupture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Duke, yes, I know you are very indulgent toward the queen, too\r\nindulgent, perhaps; we shall have occasion, I warn you, at some future\r\nperiod to speak of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever it shall please your Majesty; but I shall be always happy and\r\nproud, sire, to sacrifice myself to the harmony which I desire to see\r\nreign between you and the Queen of France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Cardinal, very well; but, meantime, send for Monsieur the\r\nKeeper of the Seals. I will go to the queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Louis XIII., opening the door of communication, passed into the\r\ncorridor which led from his apartments to those of Anne of Austria.\r\n\r\nThe queen was in the midst of her women\xe2\x80\x94Mme. de Guitaut, Mme. de Sable,\r\nMme. de Montbazon, and Mme. de Gu\xc3\xa9men\xc3\xa9. In a corner was the Spanish\r\ncompanion, Donna Estafania, who had followed her from Madrid. Mme.\r\nGu\xc3\xa9men\xc3\xa9 was reading aloud, and everybody was listening to her with\r\nattention with the exception of the queen, who had, on the contrary,\r\ndesired this reading in order that she might be able, while feigning to\r\nlisten, to pursue the thread of her own thoughts.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts, gilded as they were by a last reflection of love, were\r\nnot the less sad. Anne of Austria, deprived of the confidence of her\r\nhusband, pursued by the hatred of the cardinal, who could not pardon\r\nher for having repulsed a more tender feeling, having before her eyes\r\nthe example of the queen-mother whom that hatred had tormented all her\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94though Marie de M\xc3\xa9dicis, if the memoirs of the time are to be\r\nbelieved, had begun by according to the cardinal that sentiment which\r\nAnne of Austria always refused him\xe2\x80\x94Anne of Austria had seen her most\r\ndevoted servants fall around her, her most intimate confidants, her\r\ndearest favorites. Like those unfortunate persons endowed with a fatal\r\ngift, she brought misfortune upon everything she touched. Her\r\nfriendship was a fatal sign which called down persecution. Mme. de\r\nChevreuse and Mme. de Bernet were exiled, and Laporte did not conceal\r\nfrom his mistress that he expected to be arrested every instant.\r\n\r\nIt was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of\r\nthese reflections that the door of the chamber opened, and the king\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nThe reader hushed herself instantly. All the ladies rose, and there was\r\na profound silence. As to the king, he made no demonstration of\r\npoliteness, only stopping before the queen. \xe2\x80\x9cMadame,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\nabout to receive a visit from the chancellor, who will communicate\r\ncertain matters to you with which I have charged him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate queen, who was constantly threatened with divorce,\r\nexile, and trial even, turned pale under her rouge, and could not\r\nrefrain from saying, \xe2\x80\x9cBut why this visit, sire? What can the chancellor\r\nhave to say to me that your Majesty could not say yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king turned upon his heel without reply, and almost at the same\r\ninstant the captain of the Guards, M. de Guitant, announced the visit\r\nof the chancellor.\r\n\r\nWhen the chancellor appeared, the king had already gone out by another\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe chancellor entered, half smiling, half blushing. As we shall\r\nprobably meet with him again in the course of our history, it may be\r\nwell for our readers to be made at once acquainted with him.\r\n\r\nThis chancellor was a pleasant man. He was Des Roches le Masle, canon\r\nof Notre Dame, who had formerly been valet of a bishop, who introduced\r\nhim to his Eminence as a perfectly devout man. The cardinal trusted\r\nhim, and therein found his advantage.\r\n\r\nThere are many stories related of him, and among them this. After a\r\nwild youth, he had retired into a convent, there to expiate, at least\r\nfor some time, the follies of adolescence. On entering this holy place,\r\nthe poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent\r\nthe passions he fled from entering with him. He was incessantly\r\nattacked by them, and the superior, to whom he had confided this\r\nmisfortune, wishing as much as in him lay to free him from them, had\r\nadvised him, in order to conjure away the tempting demon, to have\r\nrecourse to the bell rope, and ring with all his might. At the\r\ndenunciating sound, the monks would be rendered aware that temptation\r\nwas besieging a brother, and all the community would go to prayers.\r\n\r\nThis advice appeared good to the future chancellor. He conjured the\r\nevil spirit with abundance of prayers offered up by the monks. But the\r\ndevil does not suffer himself to be easily dispossessed from a place in\r\nwhich he has fixed his garrison. In proportion as they redoubled the\r\nexorcisms he redoubled the temptations; so that day and night the bell\r\nwas ringing full swing, announcing the extreme desire for mortification\r\nwhich the penitent experienced.\r\n\r\nThe monks had no longer an instant of repose. By day they did nothing\r\nbut ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel; at night, in\r\naddition to complines and matins, they were further obliged to leap\r\ntwenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of\r\ntheir cells.\r\n\r\nIt is not known whether it was the devil who gave way, or the monks who\r\ngrew tired; but within three months the penitent reappeared in the\r\nworld with the reputation of being the most terrible _possessed_ that\r\never existed.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the convent he entered into the magistracy, became president\r\non the place of his uncle, embraced the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s party, which did not\r\nprove want of sagacity, became chancellor, served his Eminence with\r\nzeal in his hatred against the queen-mother and his vengeance against\r\nAnne of Austria, stimulated the judges in the affair of Calais,\r\nencouraged the attempts of M. de Laffemas, chief gamekeeper of France;\r\nthen, at length, invested with the entire confidence of the cardinal\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nconfidence which he had so well earned\xe2\x80\x94he received the singular\r\ncommission for the execution of which he presented himself in the\r\nqueen\xe2\x80\x99s apartments.\r\n\r\nThe queen was still standing when he entered; but scarcely had she\r\nperceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair, and made a\r\nsign to her women to resume their cushions and stools, and with an air\r\nof supreme hauteur, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you desire, monsieur, and with what\r\nobject do you present yourself here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo make, madame, in the name of the king, and without prejudice to the\r\nrespect which I have the honor to owe to your Majesty a close\r\nexamination into all your papers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, monsieur, an investigation of my papers\xe2\x80\x94mine! Truly, this is an\r\nindignity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe kind enough to pardon me, madame; but in this circumstance I am but\r\nthe instrument which the king employs. Has not his Majesty just left\r\nyou, and has he not himself asked you to prepare for this visit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSearch, then, monsieur! I am a criminal, as it appears. Estafania,\r\ngive up the keys of my drawers and my desks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor form\xe2\x80\x99s sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture\r\nnamed; but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that\r\nthe queen would place the important letter she had written that day.\r\n\r\nWhen the chancellor had opened and shut twenty times the drawers of the\r\nsecretaries, it became necessary, whatever hesitation he might\r\nexperience\xe2\x80\x94it became necessary, I say, to come to the conclusion of the\r\naffair; that is to say, to search the queen herself. The chancellor\r\nadvanced, therefore, toward Anne of Austria, and said with a very\r\nperplexed and embarrassed air, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now it remains for me to make the\r\nprincipal examination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the queen, who did not understand, or rather was\r\nnot willing to understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis majesty is certain that a letter has been written by you during\r\nthe day; he knows that it has not yet been sent to its address. This\r\nletter is not in your table nor in your secretary; and yet this letter\r\nmust be somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you dare to lift your hand to your queen?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne of Austria,\r\ndrawing herself up to her full height, and fixing her eyes upon the\r\nchancellor with an expression almost threatening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a faithful subject of the king, madame, and all that his Majesty\r\ncommands I shall do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is true!\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne of Austria; \xe2\x80\x9cand the spies of the\r\ncardinal have served him faithfully. I have written a letter today;\r\nthat letter is not yet gone. The letter is here.\xe2\x80\x9d And the queen laid\r\nher beautiful hand on her bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen give me that letter, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said the chancellor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will give it to none but the king, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the king had desired that the letter should be given to him,\r\nmadame, he would have demanded it of you himself. But I repeat to you,\r\nI am charged with reclaiming it; and if you do not give it up\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has, then, charged me to take it from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow! What do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat my orders go far, madame; and that I am authorized to seek for\r\nthe suspected paper, even on the person of your Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat horror!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the queen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe kind enough, then, madame, to act more compliantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe conduct is infamously violent! Do you know that, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe king commands it, madame; excuse me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not suffer it! No, no, I would rather die!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the queen, in\r\nwhom the imperious blood of Spain and Austria began to rise.\r\n\r\nThe chancellor made a profound reverence. Then, with the intention\r\nquite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the\r\ncommission with which he was charged, and as the attendant of an\r\nexecutioner might have done in the chamber of torture, he approached\r\nAnne of Austria, from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of\r\nrage.\r\n\r\nThe queen was, as we have said, of great beauty. The commission might\r\nwell be called delicate; and the king had reached, in his jealousy of\r\nBuckingham, the point of not being jealous of anyone else.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt the chancellor S\xc3\xa9guier looked about at that moment for\r\nthe rope of the famous bell; but not finding it he summoned his\r\nresolution, and stretched forth his hands toward the place where the\r\nqueen had acknowledged the paper was to be found.\r\n\r\nAnne of Austria took one step backward, became so pale that it might be\r\nsaid she was dying, and leaning with her left hand upon a table behind\r\nher to keep herself from falling, she with her right hand drew the\r\npaper from her bosom and held it out to the keeper of the seals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, monsieur, there is that letter!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the queen, with a broken\r\nand trembling voice; \xe2\x80\x9ctake it, and deliver me from your odious\r\npresence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chancellor, who, on his part, trembled with an emotion easily to be\r\nconceived, took the letter, bowed to the ground, and retired. The door\r\nwas scarcely closed upon him, when the queen sank, half fainting, into\r\nthe arms of her women.\r\n\r\nThe chancellor carried the letter to the king without having read a\r\nsingle word of it. The king took it with a trembling hand, looked for\r\nthe address, which was wanting, became very pale, opened it slowly,\r\nthen seeing by the first words that it was addressed to the King of\r\nSpain, he read it rapidly.\r\n\r\nIt was nothing but a plan of attack against the cardinal. The queen\r\npressed her brother and the Emperor of Austria to appear to be wounded,\r\nas they really were, by the policy of Richelieu\xe2\x80\x94the eternal object of\r\nwhich was the abasement of the house of Austria\xe2\x80\x94to declare war against\r\nFrance, and as a condition of peace, to insist upon the dismissal of\r\nthe cardinal; but as to love, there was not a single word about it in\r\nall the letter.\r\n\r\nThe king, quite delighted, inquired if the cardinal was still at the\r\nLouvre; he was told that his Eminence awaited the orders of his Majesty\r\nin the business cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe king went straight to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were right and I was wrong. The whole\r\nintrigue is political, and there is not the least question of love in\r\nthis letter; but, on the other hand, there is abundant question of\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cardinal took the letter, and read it with the greatest attention;\r\nthen, when he had arrived at the end of it, he read it a second time.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, your Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see how far my enemies go; they\r\nmenace you with two wars if you do not dismiss me. In your place, in\r\ntruth, sire, I should yield to such powerful instance; and on my part,\r\nit would be a real happiness to withdraw from public affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat say you, Duke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, sire, that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles\r\nand these never-ending labors. I say that according to all probability\r\nI shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of La\r\nRochelle, and that it would be far better that you should appoint there\r\neither Monsieur de Cond\xc3\xa9, Monsieur de Bassopierre, or some valiant\r\ngentleman whose business is war, and not me, who am a churchman, and\r\nwho am constantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after\r\nmatters for which I have no aptitude. You would be the happier for it\r\nat home, sire, and I do not doubt you would be the greater for it\r\nabroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, \xe2\x80\x9cI understand you. Be satisfied, all\r\nwho are named in that letter shall be punished as they deserve, even\r\nthe queen herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say, sire? God forbid that the queen should suffer the\r\nleast inconvenience or uneasiness on my account! She has always\r\nbelieved me, sire, to be her enemy; although your Majesty can bear\r\nwitness that I have always taken her part warmly, even against you. Oh,\r\nif she betrayed your Majesty on the side of your honor, it would be\r\nquite another thing, and I should be the first to say, \xe2\x80\x98No grace,\r\nsire\xe2\x80\x94no grace for the guilty!\xe2\x80\x99 Happily, there is nothing of the kind,\r\nand your Majesty has just acquired a new proof of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true, Monsieur Cardinal,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, \xe2\x80\x9cand you were right,\r\nas you always are; but the queen, not the less, deserves all my anger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is you, sire, who have now incurred hers. And even if she were to\r\nbe seriously offended, I could well understand it; your Majesty has\r\ntreated her with a severity\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is thus I will always treat my enemies and yours, Duke, however\r\nhigh they may be placed, and whatever peril I may incur in acting\r\nseverely toward them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe queen is my enemy, but is not yours, sire; on the contrary, she is\r\na devoted, submissive, and irreproachable wife. Allow me, then, sire,\r\nto intercede for her with your Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her humble herself, then, and come to me first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, sire, set the example. You have committed the first\r\nwrong, since it was you who suspected the queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! I make the first advances?\xe2\x80\x9d said the king. \xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire, I entreat you to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, in what manner can I make advances first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive a ball; you know how much the queen loves dancing. I will answer\r\nfor it, her resentment will not hold out against such an attention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Cardinal, you know that I do not like worldly pleasures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe queen will only be the more grateful to you, as she knows your\r\nantipathy for that amusement; besides, it will be an opportunity for\r\nher to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her\r\nbirthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn\r\nherself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see, Monsieur Cardinal, we shall see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, who, in\r\nhis joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little\r\nabout, and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread, was ready\r\nto make up all differences with her, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall see, but upon my honor,\r\nyou are too indulgent toward her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cleave severity to your ministers. Clemency\r\nis a royal virtue; employ it, and you will find that you derive\r\nadvantage therein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon the cardinal, hearing the clock strike eleven, bowed low,\r\nasking permission of the king to retire, and supplicating him to come\r\nto a good understanding with the queen.\r\n\r\nAnne of Austria, who, in consequence of the seizure of her letter,\r\nexpected reproaches, was much astonished the next day to see the king\r\nmake some attempts at reconciliation with her. Her first movement was\r\nrepellent. Her womanly pride and her queenly dignity had both been so\r\ncruelly offended that she could not come round at the first advance;\r\nbut, overpersuaded by the advice of her women, she at last had the\r\nappearance of beginning to forget. The king took advantage of this\r\nfavorable moment to tell her that he had the intention of shortly\r\ngiving a f\xc3\xaate.\r\n\r\nA f\xc3\xaate was so rare a thing for poor Anne of Austria that at this\r\nannouncement, as the cardinal had predicted, the last trace of her\r\nresentment disappeared, if not from her heart, at least from her\r\ncountenance. She asked upon what day this f\xc3\xaate would take place, but\r\nthe king replied that he must consult the cardinal upon that head.\r\n\r\nIndeed, every day the king asked the cardinal when this f\xc3\xaate should\r\ntake place; and every day the cardinal, under some pretext, deferred\r\nfixing it. Ten days passed away thus.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day after the scene we have described, the cardinal\r\nreceived a letter with the London stamp which only contained these\r\nlines: \xe2\x80\x9cI have them; but I am unable to leave London for want of money.\r\nSend me five hundred pistoles, and four or five days after I have\r\nreceived them I shall be in Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his\r\ncustomary question to him.\r\n\r\nRichelieu counted on his fingers, and said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cShe will\r\narrive, she says, four or five days after having received the money. It\r\nwill require four or five days for the transmission of the money, four\r\nor five days for her to return; that makes ten days. Now, allowing for\r\ncontrary winds, accidents, and a woman\xe2\x80\x99s weakness, there are twelve\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Monsieur Duke,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, \xe2\x80\x9chave you made your\r\ncalculations?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sire. Today is the twentieth of September. The aldermen of the\r\ncity give a f\xc3\xaate on the third of October. That will fall in wonderfully\r\nwell; you will not appear to have gone out of your way to please the\r\nqueen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the cardinal added, \xe2\x80\x9c_A propos_, sire, do not forget to tell her\r\nMajesty the evening before the f\xc3\xaate that you should like to see how her\r\ndiamond studs become her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII.\r\nBONACIEUX AT HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs\r\nto the king. Louis XIII. was struck with this insistence, and began to\r\nfancy that this recommendation concealed some mystery.\r\n\r\nMore than once the king had been humiliated by the cardinal, whose\r\npolice, without having yet attained the perfection of the modern\r\npolice, were excellent, being better informed than himself, even upon\r\nwhat was going on in his own household. He hoped, then, in a\r\nconversation with Anne of Austria, to obtain some information from that\r\nconversation, and afterward to come upon his Eminence with some secret\r\nwhich the cardinal either knew or did not know, but which, in either\r\ncase, would raise him infinitely in the eyes of his minister.\r\n\r\nHe went then to the queen, and according to custom accosted her with\r\nfresh menaces against those who surrounded her. Anne of Austria lowered\r\nher head, allowed the torrent to flow on without replying, hoping that\r\nit would cease of itself; but this was not what Louis XIII. meant. Louis\r\nXIII. wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break,\r\nconvinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was\r\npreparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his Eminence\r\nwas so skillful in getting up. He arrived at this end by his\r\npersistence in accusation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne of Austria, tired of these vague attacks, \xe2\x80\x9cbut, sire,\r\nyou do not tell me all that you have in your heart. What have I done,\r\nthen? Let me know what crime I have committed. It is impossible that\r\nyour Majesty can make all this ado about a letter written to my\r\nbrother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king, attacked in a manner so direct, did not know what to answer;\r\nand he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which\r\nhe was not going to have made until the evening before the f\xc3\xaate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with dignity, \xe2\x80\x9cthere will shortly be a ball at the\r\nH\xc3\xb4tel de Ville. I wish, in order to honor our worthy aldermen, you\r\nshould appear in ceremonial costume, and above all, ornamented with the\r\ndiamond studs which I gave you on your birthday. That is my answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer was terrible. Anne of Austria believed that Louis XIII. knew\r\nall, and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long\r\ndissimulation of seven or eight days, which, likewise, was\r\ncharacteristic. She became excessively pale, leaned her beautiful hand\r\nupon a _console_, which hand appeared then like one of wax, and looking\r\nat the king with terror in her eyes, she was unable to reply by a\r\nsingle syllable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hear, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, who enjoyed the embarrassment to its\r\nfull extent, but without guessing the cause. \xe2\x80\x9cYou hear, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sire, I hear,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered the queen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will appear at this ball?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith those studs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe queen\xe2\x80\x99s paleness, if possible, increased; the king perceived it,\r\nand enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides\r\nof his character.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen that is agreed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, \xe2\x80\x9cand that is all I had to say to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut on what day will this ball take place?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Anne of Austria.\r\n\r\nLouis XIII. felt instinctively that he ought not to reply to this\r\nquestion, the queen having put it in an almost dying voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very shortly, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I do not precisely recollect\r\nthe date of the day. I will ask the cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the cardinal, then, who informed you of this f\xc3\xaate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the astonished king; \xe2\x80\x9cbut why do you ask that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, madame\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was he, sire, it was he!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and what does it signify whether it was he or I? Is there any\r\ncrime in this request?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you will appear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the king, retiring, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is well; I count upon\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe queen made a curtsy, less from etiquette than because her knees\r\nwere sinking under her. The king went away enchanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am lost,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the queen, \xe2\x80\x9clost!\xe2\x80\x94for the cardinal knows all, and\r\nit is he who urges on the king, who as yet knows nothing but will soon\r\nknow everything. I am lost! My God, my God, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knelt upon a cushion and prayed, with her head buried between her\r\npalpitating arms.\r\n\r\nIn fact, her position was terrible. Buckingham had returned to London;\r\nMme. de Chevreuse was at Tours. More closely watched than ever, the\r\nqueen felt certain, without knowing how to tell which, that one of her\r\nwomen had betrayed her. Laporte could not leave the Louvre; she had not\r\na soul in the world in whom she could confide. Thus, while\r\ncontemplating the misfortune which threatened her and the abandonment\r\nin which she was left, she broke out into sobs and tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I be of service to your Majesty?\xe2\x80\x9d said all at once a voice full of\r\nsweetness and pity.\r\n\r\nThe queen turned sharply round, for there could be no deception in the\r\nexpression of that voice; it was a friend who spoke thus.\r\n\r\nIn fact, at one of the doors which opened into the queen\xe2\x80\x99s apartment\r\nappeared the pretty Mme. Bonacieux. She had been engaged in arranging\r\nthe dresses and linen in a closet when the king entered; she could not\r\nget out and had heard all.\r\n\r\nThe queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprised\xe2\x80\x94for in\r\nher trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been\r\ngiven to her by Laporte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, fear nothing, madame!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman, clasping her hands\r\nand weeping herself at the queen\xe2\x80\x99s sorrows; \xe2\x80\x9cI am your Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s, body\r\nand soul, and however far I may be from you, however inferior may be my\r\nposition, I believe I have discovered a means of extricating your\r\nMajesty from your trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, oh, heaven, you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the queen; \xe2\x80\x9cbut look me in the face. I am\r\nbetrayed on all sides. Can I trust in you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, madame!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young woman, falling on her knees; \xe2\x80\x9cupon my\r\nsoul, I am ready to die for your Majesty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart, and, like the\r\nfirst, there was no mistaking it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mme. Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, there are traitors here; but by\r\nthe holy name of the Virgin, I swear that no one is more devoted to\r\nyour Majesty than I am. Those studs which the king speaks of, you gave\r\nthem to the Duke of Buckingham, did you not? Those studs were enclosed\r\nin a little rosewood box which he held under his arm? Am I deceived? Is\r\nit not so, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the queen, whose teeth chattered with\r\nfright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, those studs,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mme. Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must have them back\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, without doubt, it is necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the queen; \xe2\x80\x9cbut how am I\r\nto act? How can it be effected?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomeone must be sent to the duke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who, who? In whom can I trust?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlace confidence in me, madame; do me that honor, my queen, and I will\r\nfind a messenger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I must write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; that is indispensable. Two words from the hand of your\r\nMajesty and your private seal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut these two words would bring about my condemnation, divorce,\r\nexile!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if they fell into infamous hands. But I will answer for these two\r\nwords being delivered to their address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God! I must then place my life, my honor, my reputation, in\r\nyour hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, madame, you must; and I will save them all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how? Tell me at least the means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband had been at liberty these two or three days. I have not yet\r\nhad time to see him again. He is a worthy, honest man who entertains\r\nneither love nor hatred for anybody. He will do anything I wish. He\r\nwill set out upon receiving an order from me, without knowing what he\r\ncarries, and he will carry your Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s letter, without even knowing\r\nit is from your Majesty, to the address which is on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of\r\nemotion, gazed at her as if to read her very heart, and, seeing nothing\r\nbut sincerity in her beautiful eyes, embraced her tenderly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo that,\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, \xe2\x80\x9cand you will have saved my life, you will have\r\nsaved my honor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not exaggerate the service I have the happiness to render your\r\nMajesty. I have nothing to save for your Majesty; you are only the\r\nvictim of perfidious plots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true, that is true, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d said the queen, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me then, that letter, madame; time presses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe queen ran to a little table, on which were ink, paper, and pens.\r\nShe wrote two lines, sealed the letter with her private seal, and gave\r\nit to Mme. Bonacieux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the queen, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are forgetting one very necessary\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMme. Bonacieux blushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will confess to your Majesty that\r\nmy husband\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour husband has none. Is that what you would say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has some, but he is very avaricious; that is his fault.\r\nNevertheless, let not your Majesty be uneasy, we will find means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have none, either,\xe2\x80\x9d said the queen. Those who have read the\r\n_Memoirs_ of Mme. de Motteville will not be astonished at this reply.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut wait a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne of Austria ran to her jewel case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9chere is a ring of great value, as I have been\r\nassured. It came from my brother, the King of Spain. It is mine, and I\r\nam at liberty to dispose of it. Take this ring; raise money with it,\r\nand let your husband set out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn an hour you shall be obeyed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see the address,\xe2\x80\x9d said the queen, speaking so low that Mme.\r\nBonacieux could hardly hear what she said, \xe2\x80\x9cTo my Lord Duke of\r\nBuckingham, London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letter shall be given to himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGenerous girl!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anne of Austria.\r\n\r\nMme. Bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen, concealed the paper in\r\nthe bosom of her dress, and disappeared with the lightness of a bird.\r\n\r\nTen minutes afterward she was at home. As she told the queen, she had\r\nnot seen her husband since his liberation; she was ignorant of the\r\nchange that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nchange which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from\r\nthe Comte de Rochefort, who had become the best friend of Bonacieux,\r\nand had persuaded him, without much trouble, that no culpable\r\nsentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife, but that it was only\r\na political precaution.\r\n\r\nShe found M. Bonacieux alone; the poor man was recovering with\r\ndifficulty the order in his house, in which he had found most of the\r\nfurniture broken and the closets nearly emptied\xe2\x80\x94justice not being one\r\nof the three things which King Solomon names as leaving no traces of\r\ntheir passage. As to the servant, she had run away at the moment of her\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s arrest. Terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that\r\nshe had never ceased walking from Paris till she reached Burgundy, her\r\nnative place.\r\n\r\nThe worthy mercer had, immediately upon re-entering his house, informed\r\nhis wife of his happy return, and his wife had replied by\r\ncongratulating him, and telling him that the first moment she could\r\nsteal from her duties should be devoted to paying him a visit.\r\n\r\nThis first moment had been delayed five days, which, under any other\r\ncircumstances, might have appeared rather long to M. Bonacieux; but he\r\nhad, in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits\r\nRochefort had made him, ample subjects for reflection, and as everybody\r\nknows, nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection.\r\n\r\nThis was the more so because Bonacieux\xe2\x80\x99s reflections were all\r\nrose-colored. Rochefort called him his friend, his dear Bonacieux, and\r\nnever ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him.\r\nThe mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nOn her side Mme. Bonacieux had also reflected; but, it must be\r\nadmitted, upon something widely different from ambition. In spite of\r\nherself her thoughts constantly reverted to that handsome young man who\r\nwas so brave and appeared to be so much in love. Married at eighteen to\r\nM. Bonacieux, having always lived among her husband\xe2\x80\x99s friends\xe2\x80\x94people\r\nlittle capable of inspiring any sentiment whatever in a young woman\r\nwhose heart was above her position\xe2\x80\x94Mme. Bonacieux had remained\r\ninsensible to vulgar seductions; but at this period the title of\r\ngentleman had great influence with the citizen class, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nwas a gentleman. Besides, he wore the uniform of the Guards, which,\r\nnext to that of the Musketeers, was most admired by the ladies. He was,\r\nwe repeat, handsome, young, and bold; he spoke of love like a man who\r\ndid love and was anxious to be loved in return. There was certainly\r\nenough in all this to turn a head only twenty-three years old, and Mme.\r\nBonacieux had just attained that happy period of life.\r\n\r\nThe couple, then, although they had not seen each other for eight days,\r\nand during that time serious events had taken place in which both were\r\nconcerned, accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation.\r\nNevertheless, Bonacieux manifested real joy, and advanced toward his\r\nwife with open arms. Madame Bonacieux presented her cheek to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us talk a little,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bonacieux, astonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have something of the highest importance to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have some questions sufficiently serious to put\r\nto you. Describe to me your abduction, I pray you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence just now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does it concern, then\xe2\x80\x94my captivity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard of it the day it happened; but as you were not guilty of any\r\ncrime, as you were not guilty of any intrigue, as you, in short, knew\r\nnothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else, I attached no\r\nmore importance to that event than it merited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak very much at your ease, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bonacieux, hurt at the\r\nlittle interest his wife showed in him. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that I was plunged\r\nduring a day and night in a dungeon of the Bastille?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a day and night soon pass away. Let us return to the object that\r\nbrings me here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, that which brings you home to me? Is it not the desire of seeing\r\na husband again from whom you have been separated for a week?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nthe mercer, piqued to the quick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that first, and other things afterward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a thing of the highest interest, and upon which our future\r\nfortune perhaps depends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe complexion of our fortune has changed very much since I saw you,\r\nMadame Bonacieux, and I should not be astonished if in the course of a\r\nfew months it were to excite the envy of many folks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, particularly if you follow the instructions I am about to give\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you. There is good and holy action to be performed, monsieur, and\r\nmuch money to be gained at the same time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMme. Bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband, she took\r\nhim on his weak side. But a man, were he even a mercer, when he had\r\ntalked for ten minutes with Cardinal Richelieu, is no longer the same\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch money to be gained?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bonacieux, protruding his lip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout how much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thousand pistoles, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you demand of me is serious, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat must be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must go away immediately. I will give you a paper which you must\r\nnot part with on any account, and which you will deliver into the\r\nproper hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd whither am I to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go to London? Go to! You jest! I have no business in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut others wish that you should go there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who are those others? I warn you that I will never again work in\r\nthe dark, and that I will know not only to what I expose myself, but\r\nfor whom I expose myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn illustrious person sends you; an illustrious person awaits you. The\r\nrecompense will exceed your expectations; that is all I promise you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore intrigues! Nothing but intrigues! Thank you, madame, I am aware\r\nof them now; Monsieur Cardinal has enlightened me on that head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cardinal?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mme. Bonacieux. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen the cardinal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe sent for me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the mercer, proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you responded to his bidding, you imprudent man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I had much choice of going or not going, for I was\r\ntaken to him between two guards. It is true also, that as I did not\r\nthen know his Eminence, if I had been able to dispense with the visit,\r\nI should have been enchanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ill-treated you, then; he threatened you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gave me his hand, and called me his friend. His friend! Do you hear\r\nthat, madame? I am the friend of the great cardinal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the great cardinal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you would contest his right to that title, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would contest nothing; but I tell you that the favor of a minister\r\nis ephemeral, and that a man must be mad to attach himself to a\r\nminister. There are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or\r\nthe issue of an event; it is to these powers we should rally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for it, madame, but I acknowledge no other power but that\r\nof the great man whom I have the honor to serve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou serve the cardinal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madame; and as his servant, I will not allow you to be concerned\r\nin plots against the safety of the state, or to serve the intrigues of\r\na woman who is not French and who has a Spanish heart. Fortunately we\r\nhave the great cardinal; his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates\r\nto the bottom of the heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBonacieux was repeating, word for word, a sentence which he had heard\r\nfrom the Comte de Rochefort; but the poor wife, who had reckoned on her\r\nhusband, and who, in that hope, had answered for him to the queen, did\r\nnot tremble the less, both at the danger into which she had nearly cast\r\nherself and at the helpless state to which she was reduced.\r\nNevertheless, knowing the weakness of her husband, and more\r\nparticularly his cupidity, she did not despair of bringing him round to\r\nher purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are a cardinalist, then, monsieur, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried she; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nyou serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your\r\nqueen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrivate interests are as nothing before the interests of all. I am for\r\nthose who save the state,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bonacieux, emphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you know about the state you talk of?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme.\r\nBonacieux, shrugging her shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cBe satisfied with being a plain,\r\nstraightforward citizen, and turn to that side which offers the most\r\nadvantages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, eh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bonacieux, slapping a plump, round bag, which returned a\r\nsound a money; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you think of this, Madame Preacher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhence comes that money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not guess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the cardinal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom him, and from my friend the Comte de Rochefort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Comte de Rochefort! Why, it was he who carried me off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be, madame!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you receive silver from that man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you not said that that abduction was entirely political?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my\r\nmistress, to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise\r\nthe honor, and perhaps the life, of my august mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cyour august mistress is a perfidious\r\nSpaniard, and what the cardinal does is well done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you to be cowardly,\r\navaricious, and foolish, but I never till now believed you infamous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bonacieux, who had never seen his wife in a passion, and\r\nwho recoiled before this conjugal anger, \xe2\x80\x9cmadame, what do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say you are a miserable creature!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mme. Bonacieux, who saw\r\nshe was regaining some little influence over her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cYou meddle\r\nwith politics, do you\xe2\x80\x94and still more, with cardinalist politics? Why,\r\nyou sell yourself, body and soul, to the demon, the devil, for money!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, to the cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young woman. \xe2\x80\x9cWho calls Richelieu\r\ncalls Satan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, hold your tongue, madame! You may be overheard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you are right; I should be ashamed for anyone to know your\r\nbaseness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you require of me, then? Let us see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you. You must depart instantly, monsieur. You must\r\naccomplish loyally the commission with which I deign to charge you, and\r\non that condition I pardon everything, I forget everything; and what is\r\nmore,\xe2\x80\x9d and she held out her hand to him, \xe2\x80\x9cI restore my love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBonacieux was cowardly and avaricious, but he loved his wife. He was\r\nsoftened. A man of fifty cannot long bear malice with a wife of\r\ntwenty-three. Mme. Bonacieux saw that he hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! Have you decided?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear love, reflect a little upon what you require of me.\r\nLondon is far from Paris, very far, and perhaps the commission with\r\nwhich you charge me is not without dangers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat matters it, if you avoid them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold, Madame Bonacieux,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mercer, \xe2\x80\x9chold! I positively refuse;\r\nintrigues terrify me. I have seen the Bastille. My! Whew! That\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nfrightful place, that Bastille! Only to think of it makes my flesh\r\ncrawl. They threatened me with torture. Do you know what torture is?\r\nWooden points that they stick in between your legs till your bones\r\nstick out! No, positively I will not go. And, _morbleu_, why do you not\r\ngo yourself? For in truth, I think I have hitherto been deceived in\r\nyou. I really believe you are a man, and a violent one, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, you are a woman\xe2\x80\x94a miserable woman, stupid and brutal. You are\r\nafraid, are you? Well, if you do not go this very instant, I will have\r\nyou arrested by the queen\xe2\x80\x99s orders, and I will have you placed in the\r\nBastille which you dread so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBonacieux fell into a profound reflection. He weighed the two angers in\r\nhis brain\xe2\x80\x94that of the cardinal and that of the queen; that of the\r\ncardinal predominated enormously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave me arrested on the part of the queen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x94I will\r\nappeal to his Eminence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt once Mme. Bonacieux saw that she had gone too far, and she was\r\nterrified at having communicated so much. She for a moment contemplated\r\nwith fright that stupid countenance, impressed with the invincible\r\nresolution of a fool that is overcome by fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, be it so!\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, when all is considered, you are\r\nright. In the long run, a man knows more about politics than a woman,\r\nparticularly such as, like you, Monsieur Bonacieux, have conversed with\r\nthe cardinal. And yet it is very hard,\xe2\x80\x9d added she, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a man upon\r\nwhose affection I thought I might depend, treats me thus unkindly and\r\nwill not comply with any of my fancies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is because your fancies go too far,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the triumphant\r\nBonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cand I mistrust them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will give it up, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman, sighing. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nwell as it is; say no more about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least you should tell me what I should have to do in London,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Bonacieux, who remembered a little too late that Rochefort had\r\ndesired him to endeavor to obtain his wife\xe2\x80\x99s secrets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is of no use for you to know anything about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young\r\nwoman, whom an instinctive mistrust now impelled to draw back. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nabout one of those purchases that interest women\xe2\x80\x94a purchase by which\r\nmuch might have been gained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the more the young woman excused herself, the more important\r\nBonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him. He\r\nresolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the Comte de\r\nRochefort, and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to\r\nsend to London.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me for quitting you, my dear Madame Bonacieux,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut,\r\nnot knowing you would come to see me, I had made an engagement with a\r\nfriend. I shall soon return; and if you will wait only a few minutes\r\nfor me, as soon as I have concluded my business with that friend, as it\r\nis growing late, I will come back and reconduct you to the Louvre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, monsieur, you are not brave enough to be of any use to me\r\nwhatever,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mme. Bonacieux. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall return very safely to the\r\nLouvre all alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please, Madame Bonacieux,\xe2\x80\x9d said the ex-mercer. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I see you\r\nagain soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext week I hope my duties will afford me a little liberty, and I will\r\ntake advantage of it to come and put things in order here, as they must\r\nnecessarily be much deranged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; I shall expect you. You are not angry with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill then, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBonacieux kissed his wife\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and set off at a quick pace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux, when her husband had shut the street door\r\nand she found herself alone; \xe2\x80\x9cthat imbecile lacked but one thing: to\r\nbecome a cardinalist. And I, who have answered for him to the queen\xe2\x80\x94I,\r\nwho have promised my poor mistress\xe2\x80\x94ah, my God, my God! She will take me\r\nfor one of those wretches with whom the palace swarms and who are\r\nplaced about her as spies! Ah, Monsieur Bonacieux, I never did love you\r\nmuch, but now it is worse than ever. I hate you, and on my word you\r\nshall pay for this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the moment she spoke these words a rap on the ceiling made her raise\r\nher head, and a voice which reached her through the ceiling cried,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Madame Bonacieux, open for me the little door on the alley, and I\r\nwill come down to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII.\r\nLOVER AND HUSBAND\r\n\r\n\r\nAh, Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, entering by the door which the young\r\nwoman opened for him, \xe2\x80\x9callow me to tell you that you have a bad sort of\r\na husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have, then, overheard our conversation?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mme. Bonacieux,\r\neagerly, and looking at D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan with disquiet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how, my God?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy a mode of proceeding known to myself, and by which I likewise\r\noverheard the more animated conversation which he had with the\r\ncardinal\xe2\x80\x99s police.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you understand by what we said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thousand things. In the first place, that, unfortunately, your\r\nhusband is a simpleton and a fool; in the next place, you are in\r\ntrouble, of which I am very glad, as it gives me an opportunity of\r\nplacing myself at your service, and God knows I am ready to throw\r\nmyself into the fire for you; finally, that the queen wants a brave,\r\nintelligent, devoted man to make a journey to London for her. I have at\r\nleast two of the three qualities you stand in need of, and here I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMme. Bonacieux made no reply; but her heart beat with joy and secret\r\nhope shone in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what guarantee will you give me,\xe2\x80\x9d asked she, \xe2\x80\x9cif I consent to\r\nconfide this message to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy love for you. Speak! Command! What is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the young woman, \xe2\x80\x9cought I to confide such a\r\nsecret to you, monsieur? You are almost a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see that you require someone to answer for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI admit that would reassure me greatly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Athos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPorthos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAramis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Who are these gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree of the king\xe2\x80\x99s Musketeers. Do you know Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville,\r\ntheir captain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, him! I know him; not personally, but from having heard the\r\nqueen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, certainly not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, reveal your secret to him, and ask him whether, however\r\nimportant, however valuable, however terrible it may be, you may not\r\nconfide it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this secret is not mine, and I cannot reveal it in this manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were about to confide it to Monsieur Bonacieux,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\nwith chagrin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs one confides a letter to the hollow of a tree, to the wing of a\r\npigeon, to the collar of a dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, me\xe2\x80\x94you see plainly that I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am an honorable man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a gallant fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am brave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am sure of that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, put me to the proof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMme. Bonacieux looked at the young man, restrained for a minute by a\r\nlast hesitation; but there was such an ardor in his eyes, such\r\npersuasion in his voice, that she felt herself constrained to confide\r\nin him. Besides, she found herself in circumstances where everything\r\nmust be risked for the sake of everything. The queen might be as much\r\ninjured by too much reticence as by too much confidence; and\xe2\x80\x94let us\r\nadmit it\xe2\x80\x94the involuntary sentiment which she felt for her young\r\nprotector decided her to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cI yield to your protestations, I yield to your\r\nassurances. But I swear to you, before God who hears us, that if you\r\nbetray me, and my enemies pardon me, I will kill myself, while accusing\r\nyou of my death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x94I swear to you before God, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if I\r\nam taken while accomplishing the orders you give me, I will die sooner\r\nthan do anything that may compromise anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which\r\nchance had already communicated to him a part in front of the\r\nSamaritaine. This was their mutual declaration of love.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was radiant with joy and pride. This secret which he\r\npossessed, this woman whom he loved! Confidence and love made him a\r\ngiant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cI go at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, you will go!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux; \xe2\x80\x9cand your regiment, your\r\ncaptain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my soul, you had made me forget all that, dear Constance! Yes, you\r\nare right; a furlough is needful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill another obstacle,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mme. Bonacieux, sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to that,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, after a moment of reflection, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\nsurmount it, be assured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go this very evening to Tr\xc3\xa9ville, whom I will request to ask\r\nthis favor for me of his brother-in-law, Monsieur Dessessart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut another thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, seeing that Mme. Bonacieux hesitated to\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have, perhaps, no money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Perhaps_ is too much,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mme. Bonacieux, opening a cupboard and taking from it\r\nthe very bag which a half hour before her husband had caressed so\r\naffectionately, \xe2\x80\x9ctake this bag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, breaking into a loud laugh, he\r\nhaving heard, as may be remembered, thanks to the broken boards, every\r\nsyllable of the conversation between the mercer and his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mme. Bonacieux. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see it makes a very\r\nrespectable appearance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pardieu_,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be a double amusing affair to\r\nsave the queen with the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s money!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are an amiable and charming young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux. \xe2\x80\x9cBe\r\nassured you will not find her Majesty ungrateful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am already grandly recompensed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cI love you;\r\nyou permit me to tell you that I do\xe2\x80\x94that is already more happiness than\r\nI dared to hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux, starting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomeone is talking in the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the voice of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf my husband! Yes, I recognize it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan ran to the door and pushed the bolt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shall not come in before I am gone,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cand when I am gone,\r\nyou can open to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I ought to be gone, too. And the disappearance of his money; how\r\nam I to justify it if I am here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right; we must go out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo out? How? He will see us if we go out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you must come up into my room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cyou speak that in a tone that frightens\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMme. Bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her eyes.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan saw those tears, and much disturbed, softened, he threw\r\nhimself at her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith me you will be as safe as in a temple; I give you my word of a\r\ngentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI place full confidence in you, my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan drew back the bolt with precaution, and both, light as\r\nshadows, glided through the interior door into the passage, ascended\r\nthe stairs as quietly as possible, and entered D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s chambers.\r\n\r\nOnce there, for greater security, the young man barricaded the door.\r\nThey both approached the window, and through a slit in the shutter they\r\nsaw Bonacieux talking with a man in a cloak.\r\n\r\nAt sight of this man, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan started, and half drawing his sword,\r\nsprang toward the door.\r\n\r\nIt was the man of Meung.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mme. Bonacieux; \xe2\x80\x9cyou will ruin us\r\nall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have sworn to kill that man!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour life is devoted from this moment, and does not belong to you. In\r\nthe name of the queen I forbid you to throw yourself into any peril\r\nwhich is foreign to that of your journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you command nothing in your own name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux, with great emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cin my name I\r\nbeg you! But listen; they appear to be speaking of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan drew near the window, and lent his ear.\r\n\r\nM. Bonacieux had opened his door, and seeing the apartment, had\r\nreturned to the man in the cloak, whom he had left alone for an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is gone,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cshe must have returned to the Louvre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she did not suspect the\r\nintentions with which you went out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bonacieux, with a self-sufficient air, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is too\r\nsuperficial a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the young Guardsman at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think he is; as you see, his shutter is closed, and you can\r\nsee no light shine through the chinks of the shutters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same, it is well to be certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy knocking at his door. Go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will ask his servant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBonacieux re-entered the house, passed through the same door that had\r\nafforded a passage for the two fugitives, went up to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s door,\r\nand knocked.\r\n\r\nNo one answered. Porthos, in order to make a greater display, had that\r\nevening borrowed Planchet. As to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, he took care not to give\r\nthe least sign of existence.\r\n\r\nThe moment the hand of Bonacieux sounded on the door, the two young\r\npeople felt their hearts bound within them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nobody within,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bonacieux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. Let us return to your apartment. We shall be safer there\r\nthan in the doorway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Mme. Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall hear no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall hear better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan raised the three or four boards which made his chamber\r\nanother ear of Dionysius, spread a carpet on the floor, went upon his\r\nknees, and made a sign to Mme. Bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the\r\nopening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure there is nobody there?\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will answer for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bonacieux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you think that your wife\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas returned to the Louvre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout speaking to anyone but yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is an important point, do you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the news I brought you is of value?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe greatest, my dear Bonacieux; I don\xe2\x80\x99t conceal this from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the cardinal will be pleased with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe great cardinal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure, in her conversation with you, that your wife mentioned\r\nno names?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did not name Madame de Chevreuse, the Duke of Buckingham, or\r\nMadame de Vernet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; she only told me she wished to send me to London to serve the\r\ninterests of an illustrious personage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe traitor!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mme. Bonacieux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, taking her hand, which, without thinking of\r\nit, she abandoned to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the man in the cloak; \xe2\x80\x9cyou were a fool not to\r\nhave pretended to accept the mission. You would then be in present\r\npossession of the letter. The state, which is now threatened, would be\r\nsafe, and you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell you\xe2\x80\x94the cardinal would have given you letters of nobility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he tell you so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know that he meant to afford you that agreeable surprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bonacieux; \xe2\x80\x9cmy wife adores me, and there is yet\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ninny!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mme. Bonacieux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, pressing her hand more closely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is there still time?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the man in the cloak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go to the Louvre; I ask for Mme. Bonacieux; I say that I have\r\nreflected; I renew the affair; I obtain the letter, and I run directly\r\nto the cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go quickly! I will return soon to learn the result of your\r\ntrip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInfamous!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux, addressing this epithet to her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, pressing her hand still more warmly.\r\n\r\nA terrible howling interrupted these reflections of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and Mme.\r\nBonacieux. It was her husband, who had discovered the disappearance of\r\nthe moneybag, and was crying \xe2\x80\x9cThieves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mme. Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9che will rouse the whole quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBonacieux called a long time; but as such cries, on account of their\r\nfrequency, brought nobody in the Rue des Fossoyeurs, and as lately the\r\nmercer\xe2\x80\x99s house had a bad name, finding that nobody came, he went out\r\ncontinuing to call, his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he\r\nwent in the direction of the Rue du Bac.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow he is gone, it is your turn to get out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourage, my friend, but above all, prudence, and think what you owe to\r\nthe queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo her and to you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cBe satisfied, beautiful\r\nConstance. I shall become worthy of her gratitude; but shall I likewise\r\nreturn worthy of your love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her\r\ncheeks. A few seconds afterward D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan also went out enveloped in a\r\nlarge cloak, which ill-concealed the sheath of a long sword.\r\n\r\nMme. Bonacieux followed him with her eyes, with that long, fond look\r\nwith which he had turned the angle of the street, she fell on her\r\nknees, and clasping her hands, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God,\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, \xe2\x80\x9cprotect the\r\nqueen, protect me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX.\r\nPLAN OF CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan went straight to M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s. He had reflected that in\r\na few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger, who\r\nappeared to be his agent, and he judged, with reason, he had not a\r\nmoment to lose.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the young man overflowed with joy. An opportunity\r\npresented itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory\r\nto be acquired, and money to be gained; and as a far higher\r\nencouragement, it brought him into close intimacy with a woman he\r\nadored. This chance did, then, for him at once more than he would have\r\ndared to ask of Providence.\r\n\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville was in his saloon with his habitual court of gentlemen.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who was known as a familiar of the house, went straight to\r\nhis office, and sent word that he wished to see him on something of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\r\nentered. At the first glance, and by the joy which was painted on his\r\ncountenance, the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new\r\nwas on foot.\r\n\r\nAll the way along D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had been consulting with himself whether\r\nhe should place confidence in M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, or whether he should only\r\nask him to give him _carte blanche_ for some secret affair. But M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville had always been so thoroughly his friend, had always been so\r\ndevoted to the king and queen, and hated the cardinal so cordially,\r\nthat the young man resolved to tell him everything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ask for me, my good friend?\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, lowering his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cand you will\r\npardon me, I hope, for having disturbed you when you know the\r\nimportance of my business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, then, I am all attention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt concerns nothing less,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthan the honor, perhaps\r\nthe life of the queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, glancing round to see if they\r\nwere surely alone, and then fixing his questioning look upon\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, monsieur, that chance has rendered me master of a secret\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich you will guard, I hope, young man, as your life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut which I must impart to you, monsieur, for you alone can assist me\r\nin the mission I have just received from her Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this secret your own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur; it is her Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you authorized by her Majesty to communicate it to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur, for, on the contrary, I am desired to preserve the\r\nprofoundest mystery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, then, are you about to betray it to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, as I said, without you I can do nothing; and I am afraid you\r\nwill refuse me the favor I come to ask if you do not know to what end I\r\nask it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your secret, young man, and tell me what you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you to obtain for me, from Monsieur Dessessart, leave of\r\nabsence for fifteen days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis very night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou leave Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going on a mission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay you tell me whither?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cardinal, I believe, would give the world to prevent my success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are going alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case you will not get beyond Bondy. I tell you so, by the\r\nfaith of de Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be assassinated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I shall die in the performance of my duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your mission will not be accomplished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cin enterprises of this kind, in\r\norder that one may arrive, four must set out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are right, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you know Athos,\r\nPorthos, and Aramis, and you know if I can dispose of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout confiding to them the secret which I am not willing to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are sworn, once for all, to implicit confidence and devotedness\r\nagainst all proof. Besides, you can tell them that you have full\r\nconfidence in me, and they will not be more incredulous than you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can send to each of them leave of absence for fifteen days, that is\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94to Athos, whose wound still makes him suffer, to go to the waters\r\nof Forges; to Porthos and Aramis to accompany their friend, whom they\r\nare not willing to abandon in such a painful condition. Sending their\r\nleave of absence will be proof enough that I authorize their journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, monsieur. You are a hundred times too good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegone, then, find them instantly, and let all be done tonight! Ha!\r\nBut first write your request to Dessessart. Perhaps you had a spy at\r\nyour heels; and your visit, if it should ever be known to the cardinal,\r\nwill thus seem legitimate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan drew up his request, and M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, on receiving it,\r\nassured him that by two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning the four leaves of\r\nabsence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave the goodness to send mine to Athos\xe2\x80\x99s residence. I should dread\r\nsome disagreeable encounter if I were to go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe easy. Adieu, and a prosperous voyage. _A propos_,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville, calling him back.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough?\xe2\x80\x9d asked M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree hundred pistoles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, plenty! That would carry you to the end of the world. Begone,\r\nthen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan saluted M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, who held out his hand to him;\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude. Since his\r\nfirst arrival at Paris, he had had constant occasion to honor this\r\nexcellent man, whom he had always found worthy, loyal, and great.\r\n\r\nHis first visit was to Aramis, at whose residence he had not been since\r\nthe famous evening on which he had followed Mme. Bonacieux. Still\r\nfurther, he had seldom seen the young Musketeer; but every time he had\r\nseen him, he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance.\r\n\r\nThis evening, especially, Aramis was melancholy and thoughtful.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy. Aramis\r\npleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of St.\r\nAugustine, which he was forced to write in Latin for the following\r\nweek, and which preoccupied him a good deal.\r\n\r\nAfter the two friends had been chatting a few moments, a servant from\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville entered, bringing a sealed packet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe leave of absence Monsieur has asked for,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lackey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me! I have asked for no leave of absence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue and take it!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, my friend,\r\nthere is a demipistole for your trouble; you will tell Monsieur de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville that Monsieur Aramis is very much obliged to him. Go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lackey bowed to the ground and departed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does all this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight, and follow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I cannot leave Paris just now without knowing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is become of her? I suppose you mean\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d continued D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecome of whom?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman who was here\xe2\x80\x94the woman with the embroidered handkerchief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you there was a woman here?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis, becoming as pale\r\nas death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know who she is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I can guess, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis. \xe2\x80\x9cSince you appear to know so many things, can\r\nyou tell me what is become of that woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI presume that she has returned to Tours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Tours? Yes, that may be. You evidently know her. But why did she\r\nreturn to Tours without telling me anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she was in fear of being arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy has she not written to me, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she was afraid of compromising you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, you restore me to life!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Aramis. \xe2\x80\x9cI fancied myself\r\ndespised, betrayed. I was so delighted to see her again! I could not\r\nhave believed she would risk her liberty for me, and yet for what other\r\ncause could she have returned to Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the cause which today takes us to England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is this cause?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99ll know it someday, Aramis; but at present I must imitate the\r\ndiscretion of \xe2\x80\x98the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s niece.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis smiled, as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a\r\ncertain evening. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, since she has left Paris, and you are\r\nsure of it, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, nothing prevents me, and I am ready to follow\r\nyou. You say we are going\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo see Athos now, and if you will come thither, I beg you to make\r\nhaste, for we have lost much time already. _A propos_, inform Bazin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill Bazin go with us?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps so. At all events, it is best that he should follow us to\r\nAthos\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis called Bazin, and, after having ordered him to join them at\r\nAthos\xe2\x80\x99s residence, said \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go then,\xe2\x80\x9d at the same time taking his\r\ncloak, sword, and three pistols, opening uselessly two or three drawers\r\nto see if he could not find stray coin. When well assured this search\r\nwas superfluous, he followed D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, wondering to himself how this\r\nyoung Guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had\r\ngiven hospitality, and that he should know better than himself what had\r\nbecome of her.\r\n\r\nOnly as they went out Aramis placed his hand upon the arm of\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and looking at him earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have not spoken of this\r\nlady?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo nobody in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even to Athos or Porthos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not breathed a syllable to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTranquil on this important point, Aramis continued his way with\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and both soon arrived at Athos\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling. They found him\r\nholding his leave of absence in one hand, and M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s note in\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this\r\nletter, which I have just received?\xe2\x80\x9d said the astonished Athos.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ATHOS,\r\n    I wish, as your health absolutely requires it, that you should rest\r\n    for a fortnight. Go, then, and take the waters of Forges, or any\r\n    that may be more agreeable to you, and recuperate yourself as\r\n    quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nYours affectionate,\r\nDE TR\xc3\x89VILLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow\r\nme, Athos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the waters of Forges?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere or elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the king\xe2\x80\x99s service?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEither the king\xe2\x80\x99s or the queen\xe2\x80\x99s. Are we not their Majesties\xe2\x80\x99\r\nservants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment Porthos entered. \xe2\x80\x9c_Pardieu!_\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9chere is a\r\nstrange thing! Since when, I wonder, in the Musketeers, did they grant\r\nmen leave of absence without their asking for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthey have friends who ask it for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cit appears there\xe2\x80\x99s something fresh here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we are going\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what country?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo London, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo London!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cand what the devil are we going to do in\r\nLondon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I am not at liberty to tell you, gentlemen; you must\r\ntrust to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in order to go to London,\xe2\x80\x9d added Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cmoney is needed, and I\r\nhave none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, pulling out his treasure from his pocket,\r\nand placing it on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are in this bag three hundred\r\npistoles. Let each take seventy-five; that is enough to take us to\r\nLondon and back. Besides, make yourselves easy; we shall not all arrive\r\nat London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, in all probability, some one of us will be left on the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this, then, a campaign upon which we are now entering?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of a most dangerous kind, I give you notice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! But if we do risk being killed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cat least I should\r\nlike to know what for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would be all the wiser,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cI am somewhat of Porthos\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the king accustomed to give you such reasons? No. He says to you\r\njauntily, \xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen, there is fighting going on in Gascony or in\r\nFlanders; go and fight,\xe2\x80\x99 and you go there. Why? You need give\r\nyourselves no more uneasiness about this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan is right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9chere are our three leaves of\r\nabsence which came from Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, and here are three\r\nhundred pistoles which came from I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where. So let us go and\r\nget killed where we are told to go. Is life worth the trouble of so\r\nmany questions? D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, I am ready to follow you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I also,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I also,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, indeed, I am not sorry to quit Paris;\r\nI had need of distraction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you will have distractions enough, gentlemen, be assured,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, now, when are we to go?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmediately,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have not a minute to lose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Grimaud! Planchet! Mousqueton! Bazin!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the four young\r\nmen, calling their lackeys, \xe2\x80\x9cclean my boots, and fetch the horses from\r\nthe h\xc3\xb4tel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEach Musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general h\xc3\xb4tel, as at a\r\nbarrack, his own horse and that of his lackey. Planchet, Grimaud,\r\nMousqueton, and Bazin set off at full speed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let us lay down the plan of campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do we\r\ngo first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Calais,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is the most direct line to London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is my advice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour men traveling together would be suspected. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan will give\r\neach of us his instructions. I will go by the way of Boulogne to clear\r\nthe way; Athos will set out two hours after, by that of Amiens; Aramis\r\nwill follow us by that of Noyon; as to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, he will go by what\r\nroute he thinks is best, in Planchet\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, while Planchet will\r\nfollow us like D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in the uniform of the Guards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cmy opinion is that it is not proper to allow\r\nlackeys to have anything to do in such an affair. A secret may, by\r\nchance, be betrayed by gentlemen; but it is almost always sold by\r\nlackeys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPorthos\xe2\x80\x99s plan appears to me to be impracticable,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cinasmuch as I am myself ignorant of what instructions I can give you.\r\nI am the bearer of a letter, that is all. I have not, and I cannot make\r\nthree copies of that letter, because it is sealed. We must, then, as it\r\nappears to me, travel in company. This letter is here, in this pocket,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand he pointed to the pocket which contained the letter. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I should\r\nbe killed, one of you must take it, and continue the route; if he be\r\nkilled, it will be another\xe2\x80\x99s turn, and so on\xe2\x80\x94provided a single one\r\narrives, that is all that is required.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, your opinion is mine,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, we\r\nmust be consistent; I am going to take the waters, you will accompany\r\nme. Instead of taking the waters of Forges, I go and take sea waters; I\r\nam free to do so. If anyone wishes to stop us, I will show Monsieur de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and you will show your leaves of absence. If we are\r\nattacked, we will defend ourselves; if we are tried, we will stoutly\r\nmaintain that we were only anxious to dip ourselves a certain number of\r\ntimes in the sea. They would have an easy bargain of four isolated men;\r\nwhereas four men together make a troop. We will arm our four lackeys\r\nwith pistols and musketoons; if they send an army out against us, we\r\nwill give battle, and the survivor, as D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan says, will carry the\r\nletter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell said,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Aramis; \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t often speak, Athos, but when you\r\ndo speak, it is like St. John of the Golden Mouth. I agree to Athos\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplan. And you, Porthos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agree to it, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cif D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan approves of it.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, being the bearer of the letter, is naturally the head of\r\nthe enterprise; let him decide, and we will execute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI decide that we should adopt Athos\xe2\x80\x99s plan,\r\nand that we set off in half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgreed!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the three Musketeers in chorus.\r\n\r\nEach one, stretching out his hand to the bag, took his seventy-five\r\npistoles, and made his preparations to set out at the time appointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX.\r\nTHE JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nAt two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, our four adventurers left Paris by the\r\nBarri\xc3\xa8re St. Denis. As long as it was dark they remained silent; in\r\nspite of themselves they submitted to the influence of the obscurity,\r\nand apprehended ambushes on every side.\r\n\r\nWith the first rays of day their tongues were loosened; with the sun\r\ngaiety revived. It was like the eve of a battle; the heart beat, the\r\neyes laughed, and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to\r\nlose, was, after all, a good thing.\r\n\r\nBesides, the appearance of the caravan was formidable. The black horses\r\nof the Musketeers, their martial carriage, with the regimental step of\r\nthese noble companions of the soldier, would have betrayed the most\r\nstrict incognito. The lackeys followed, armed to the teeth.\r\n\r\nAll went well till they arrived at Chantilly, which they reached about\r\neight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. They needed breakfast, and alighted at\r\nthe door of an _auberge_, recommended by a sign representing St. Martin\r\ngiving half his cloak to a poor man. They ordered the lackeys not to\r\nunsaddle the horses, and to hold themselves in readiness to set off\r\nagain immediately.\r\n\r\nThey entered the common hall, and placed themselves at table. A\r\ngentleman, who had just arrived by the route of Dammartin, was seated\r\nat the same table, and was breakfasting. He opened the conversation\r\nabout rain and fine weather; the travelers replied. He drank to their\r\ngood health, and the travelers returned his politeness.\r\n\r\nBut at the moment Mousqueton came to announce that the horses were\r\nready, and they were arising from table, the stranger proposed to\r\nPorthos to drink the health of the cardinal. Porthos replied that he\r\nasked no better if the stranger, in his turn, would drink the health of\r\nthe king. The stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his\r\nEminence. Porthos called him drunk, and the stranger drew his sword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have committed a piece of folly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nhelped; there is no drawing back. Kill the fellow, and rejoin us as\r\nsoon as you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll three remounted their horses, and set out at a good pace, while\r\nPorthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the\r\nthrusts known in the fencing schools.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere goes one!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos, at the end of five hundred paces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why did that man attack Porthos rather than any other one of us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, as Porthos was talking louder than the rest of us, he took\r\nhim for the chief,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always said that this cadet from Gascony was a well of wisdom,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmurmured Athos; and the travelers continued their route.\r\n\r\nAt Beauvais they stopped two hours, as well to breathe their horses a\r\nlittle as to wait for Porthos. At the end of two hours, as Porthos did\r\nnot come, not any news of him, they resumed their journey.\r\n\r\nAt a league from Beauvais, where the road was confined between two high\r\nbanks, they fell in with eight or ten men who, taking advantage of the\r\nroad being unpaved in this spot, appeared to be employed in digging\r\nholes and filling up the ruts with mud.\r\n\r\nAramis, not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar,\r\napostrophized them rather sharply. Athos wished to restrain him, but it\r\nwas too late. The laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their\r\ninsolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool Athos, who urged on\r\nhis horse against one of them.\r\n\r\nThen each of these men retreated as far as the ditch, from which each\r\ntook a concealed musket; the result was that our seven travelers were\r\noutnumbered in weapons. Aramis received a ball which passed through his\r\nshoulder, and Mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part\r\nwhich prolongs the lower portion of the loins. Therefore Mousqueton\r\nalone fell from his horse, not because he was severely wounded, but not\r\nbeing able to see the wound, he judged it to be more serious than it\r\nreally was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was an ambuscade!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t waste a charge!\r\nForward!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis, wounded as he was, seized the mane of his horse, which carried\r\nhim on with the others. Mousqueton\xe2\x80\x99s horse rejoined them, and galloped\r\nby the side of his companions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will serve us for a relay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather have had a hat,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cMine was carried\r\naway by a ball. By my faith, it is very fortunate that the letter was\r\nnot in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll kill poor Porthos when he comes up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Porthos were on his legs, he would have rejoined us by this time,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cMy opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not\r\nintoxicated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey continued at their best speed for two hours, although the horses\r\nwere so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet\r\nwith less interruption; but at Cr\xc3\xa8vec\xc5\x93ur, Aramis declared he could\r\nproceed no farther. In fact, it required all the courage which he\r\nconcealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so\r\nfar. He grew more pale every minute, and they were obliged to support\r\nhim on his horse. They lifted him off at the door of a cabaret, left\r\nBazin with him, who, besides, in a skirmish was more embarrassing than\r\nuseful, and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at Amiens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Morbleu_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, as soon as they were again in motion, \xe2\x80\x9creduced\r\nto two masters and Grimaud and Planchet! _Morbleu!_ I won\xe2\x80\x99t be their\r\ndupe, I will answer for it. I will neither open my mouth nor draw my\r\nsword between this and Calais. I swear by\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t waste time in swearing,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9clet us gallop, if our\r\nhorses will consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the travelers buried their rowels in their horses\xe2\x80\x99 flanks, who thus\r\nvigorously stimulated recovered their energies. They arrived at Amiens\r\nat midnight, and alighted at the _auberge_ of the Golden Lily.\r\n\r\nThe host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth. He\r\nreceived the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton\r\nnightcap in the other. He wished to lodge the two travelers each in a\r\ncharming chamber; but unfortunately these charming chambers were at the\r\nopposite extremities of the h\xc3\xb4tel. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and Athos refused them.\r\nThe host replied that he had no other worthy of their Excellencies; but\r\nthe travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber, each on\r\na mattress which might be thrown upon the ground. The host insisted;\r\nbut the travelers were firm, and he was obliged to do as they wished.\r\n\r\nThey had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within,\r\nwhen someone knocked at the yard shutter; they demanded who was there,\r\nand recognizing the voices of their lackeys, opened the shutter. It was\r\nindeed Planchet and Grimaud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrimaud can take care of the horses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are\r\nwilling, gentlemen, I will sleep across your doorway, and you will then\r\nbe certain that nobody can reach you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd on what will you sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is my bed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Planchet, producing a bundle of straw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are right. Mine host\xe2\x80\x99s face does\r\nnot please me at all; it is too gracious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor me either,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\nPlanchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the\r\ndoorway, while Grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable,\r\nundertaking that by five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning he and the four horses\r\nshould be ready.\r\n\r\nThe night was quiet enough. Toward two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning somebody\r\nendeavored to open the door; but as Planchet awoke in an instant and\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x9cWho goes there?\xe2\x80\x9d somebody replied that he was mistaken, and\r\nwent away.\r\n\r\nAt four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the\r\nstables. Grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys, and the stable\r\nboys had beaten him. When they opened the window, they saw the poor lad\r\nlying senseless, with his head split by a blow with a pitchfork.\r\n\r\nPlanchet went down into the yard, and wished to saddle the horses; but\r\nthe horses were all used up. Mousqueton\xe2\x80\x99s horse which had traveled for\r\nfive or six hours without a rider the day before, might have been able\r\nto pursue the journey; but by an inconceivable error the veterinary\r\nsurgeon, who had been sent for, as it appeared, to bleed one of the\r\nhost\xe2\x80\x99s horses, had bled Mousqueton\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThis began to be annoying. All these successive accidents were perhaps\r\nthe result of chance; but they might be the fruits of a plot. Athos and\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan went out, while Planchet was sent to inquire if there were\r\nnot three horses for sale in the neighborhood. At the door stood two\r\nhorses, fresh, strong, and fully equipped. These would just have suited\r\nthem. He asked where their masters were, and was informed that they had\r\npassed the night in the inn, and were then settling their bill with the\r\nhost.\r\n\r\nAthos went down to pay the reckoning, while D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and Planchet\r\nstood at the street door. The host was in a lower and back room, to\r\nwhich Athos was requested to go.\r\n\r\nAthos entered without the least mistrust, and took out two pistoles to\r\npay the bill. The host was alone, seated before his desk, one of the\r\ndrawers of which was partly open. He took the money which Athos offered\r\nto him, and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands,\r\nsuddenly cried out that it was bad, and that he would have him and his\r\ncompanions arrested as forgers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou blackguard!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos, going toward him, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll cut your ears\r\noff!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same instant, four men, armed to the teeth, entered by side\r\ndoors, and rushed upon Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am taken!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Athos, with all the power of his lungs. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan! Spur, spur!\xe2\x80\x9d and he fired two pistols.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and Planchet did not require twice bidding; they unfastened\r\nthe two horses that were waiting at the door, leaped upon them, buried\r\ntheir spurs in their sides, and set off at full gallop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what has become of Athos?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan of Planchet,\r\nas they galloped on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet, \xe2\x80\x9cI saw one fall at each of his two\r\nshots, and he appeared to me, through the glass door, to be fighting\r\nwith his sword with the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrave Athos!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cand to think that we are compelled\r\nto leave him; maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence. Forward,\r\nPlanchet, forward! You are a brave fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I told you, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Planchet, \xe2\x80\x9cPicards are found out by\r\nbeing used. Besides, I am here in my own country, and that excites me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd both, with free use of the spur, arrived at St. Omer without\r\ndrawing bit. At St. Omer they breathed their horses with the bridles\r\npassed under their arms for fear of accident, and ate a morsel from\r\ntheir hands on the stones of the street, after they departed again.\r\n\r\nAt a hundred paces from the gates of Calais, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s horse gave\r\nout, and could not by any means be made to get up again, the blood\r\nflowing from his eyes and his nose. There still remained Planchet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhorse; but he stopped short, and could not be made to move a step.\r\n\r\nFortunately, as we have said, they were within a hundred paces of the\r\ncity; they left their two nags upon the high road, and ran toward the\r\nquay. Planchet called his master\xe2\x80\x99s attention to a gentleman who had\r\njust arrived with his lackey, and only preceded them by about fifty\r\npaces. They made all speed to come up to this gentleman, who appeared\r\nto be in great haste. His boots were covered with dust, and he inquired\r\nif he could not instantly cross over to England.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing would be more easy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain of a vessel ready to set\r\nsail, \xe2\x80\x9cbut this morning came an order to let no one leave without\r\nexpress permission from the cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have that permission,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, drawing the paper from\r\nhis pocket; \xe2\x80\x9chere it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave it examined by the governor of the port,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shipmaster,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand give me the preference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere shall I find the governor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt his country house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is situated?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt a quarter of a league from the city. Look, you may see it from\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94at the foot of that little hill, that slated roof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman. And, with his lackey, he took the road\r\nto the governor\xe2\x80\x99s country house.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and Planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five\r\nhundred paces. Once outside the city, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan overtook the gentleman\r\nas he was entering a little wood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, you appear to be in great haste?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one can be more so, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for that,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cfor as I am in great haste\r\nlikewise, I wish to beg you to render me a service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo let me sail first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9cI have traveled sixty leagues\r\nin forty hours, and by tomorrow at midday I must be in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have performed that same distance in forty hours, and by ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nin the morning I must be in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery sorry, monsieur; but I was here first, and will not sail second.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, too, monsieur; but I arrived second, and must sail first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe king\xe2\x80\x99s service!\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own service!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is a needless quarrel you seek with me, as it seems to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Parbleu!_ What do you desire it to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I wish that order of which you are bearer, seeing that I\r\nhave not one of my own and must have one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou jest, I presume.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never jest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me pass!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall not pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brave young man, I will blow out your brains. _Hola_, Lubin, my\r\npistols!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlanchet,\xe2\x80\x9d called out D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9ctake care of the lackey; I will\r\nmanage the master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPlanchet, emboldened by the first exploit, sprang upon Lubin; and being\r\nstrong and vigorous, he soon got him on the broad of his back, and\r\nplaced his knee upon his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on with your affair, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Planchet; \xe2\x80\x9cI have finished\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing this, the gentleman drew his sword, and sprang upon D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan;\r\nbut he had too strong an adversary. In three seconds D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had\r\nwounded him three times, exclaiming at each thrust, \xe2\x80\x9cOne for Athos, one\r\nfor Porthos; and one for Aramis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the third hit the gentleman fell like a log. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan believed him\r\nto be dead, or at least insensible, and went toward him for the purpose\r\nof taking the order; but the moment he extended his hand to search for\r\nit, the wounded man, who had not dropped his sword, plunged the point\r\ninto D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s breast, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cOne for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd one for me\xe2\x80\x94the best for last!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, furious, nailing\r\nhim to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body.\r\n\r\nThis time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nsearched his pockets, and took from one of them the order for the\r\npassage. It was in the name of Comte de Wardes.\r\n\r\nThen, casting a glance on the handsome young man, who was scarcely\r\ntwenty-five years of age, and whom he was leaving in his gore, deprived\r\nof sense and perhaps dead, he gave a sigh for that unaccountable\r\ndestiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of\r\npeople who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that\r\nthey exist. But he was soon aroused from these reflections by Lubin,\r\nwho uttered loud cries and screamed for help with all his might.\r\n\r\nPlanchet grasped him by the throat, and pressed as hard as he could.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cas long as I hold him in this manner, he can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncry, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound; but as soon as I let go he will howl again. I know\r\nhim for a Norman, and Normans are obstinate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, tightly held as he was, Lubin endeavored still to cry out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; and taking out his handkerchief, he gagged\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet, \xe2\x80\x9clet us bind him to a tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis being properly done, they drew the Comte de Wardes close to his\r\nservant; and as night was approaching, and as the wounded man and the\r\nbound man were at some little distance within the wood, it was evident\r\nthey were likely to remain there till the next day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cto the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are wounded, it seems,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing! Let us attend to what is more pressing first, and\r\nthen we will attend to my wound; besides, it does not seem very\r\ndangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country\r\nhouse of the worthy functionary.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Wardes was announced, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was introduced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have an order signed by the cardinal?\xe2\x80\x9d said the governor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9chere it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah! It is quite regular and explicit,\xe2\x80\x9d said the governor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cI am one of his most faithful\r\nservants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears that his Eminence is anxious to prevent someone from\r\ncrossing to England?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; a certain D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, a B\xc3\xa9arnese gentleman who left Paris in\r\ncompany with three of his friends, with the intention of going to\r\nLondon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know him personally?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the governor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDescribe him to me, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing more easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan gave, feature for feature, a description of the Comte de\r\nWardes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he accompanied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; by a lackey named Lubin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will keep a sharp lookout for them; and if we lay hands on them his\r\nEminence may be assured they will be reconducted to Paris under a good\r\nescort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd by doing so, Monsieur the Governor,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will\r\ndeserve well of the cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you see him on your return, Monsieur Count?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout a doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him, I beg you, that I am his humble servant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not fail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDelighted with this assurance the governor countersigned the passport\r\nand delivered it to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan lost no time in useless\r\ncompliments. He thanked the governor, bowed, and departed. Once\r\noutside, he and Planchet set off as fast as they could; and by making a\r\nlong detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another gate.\r\n\r\nThe vessel was quite ready to sail, and the captain was waiting on the\r\nwharf. \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, on perceiving D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is my pass countersigned,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that other gentleman?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will not go today,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut here, I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you for us\r\ntwo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case let us go,\xe2\x80\x9d said the shipmaster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\nHe leaped with Planchet into the boat, and five minutes after they were\r\non board. It was time; for they had scarcely sailed half a league, when\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan saw a flash and heard a detonation. It was the cannon which\r\nannounced the closing of the port.\r\n\r\nHe had now leisure to look to his wound. Fortunately, as D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had\r\nthought, it was not dangerous. The point of the sword had touched a\r\nrib, and glanced along the bone. Still further, his shirt had stuck to\r\nthe wound, and he had lost only a few drops of blood.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was worn out with fatigue. A mattress was laid upon the deck\r\nfor him. He threw himself upon it, and fell asleep.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, at break of day, they were still three or four leagues\r\nfrom the coast of England. The breeze had been so light all night, they\r\nhad made but little progress. At ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the vessel cast anchor in\r\nthe harbor of Dover, and at half past ten D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan placed his foot on\r\nEnglish land, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cHere I am at last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut that was not all; they must get to London. In England the post was\r\nwell served. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and Planchet took each a post horse, and a\r\npostillion rode before them. In a few hours they were in the capital.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan did not know London; he did not know a word of English; but\r\nhe wrote the name of Buckingham on a piece of paper, and everyone\r\npointed out to him the way to the duke\xe2\x80\x99s h\xc3\xb4tel.\r\n\r\nThe duke was at Windsor hunting with the king. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan inquired for\r\nthe confidential valet of the duke, who, having accompanied him in all\r\nhis voyages, spoke French perfectly well; he told him that he came from\r\nParis on an affair of life and death, and that he must speak with his\r\nmaster instantly.\r\n\r\nThe confidence with which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan spoke convinced Patrick, which was\r\nthe name of this minister of the minister. He ordered two horses to be\r\nsaddled, and himself went as guide to the young Guardsman. As for\r\nPlanchet, he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as a rush; the\r\npoor lad\xe2\x80\x99s strength was almost exhausted. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan seemed iron.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at the castle they learned that Buckingham and the\r\nking were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away. In twenty\r\nminutes they were on the spot named. Patrick soon caught the sound of\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x99s voice calling his falcon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom must I announce to my Lord Duke?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young man who one evening sought a quarrel with him on the Pont\r\nNeuf, opposite the Samaritaine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA singular introduction!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will find that it is as good as another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPatrick galloped off, reached the duke, and announced to him in the\r\nterms directed that a messenger awaited him.\r\n\r\nBuckingham at once remembered the circumstance, and suspecting that\r\nsomething was going on in France of which it was necessary he should be\r\ninformed, he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was, and\r\nrecognizing from afar the uniform of the Guards, he put his horse into\r\na gallop, and rode straight up to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. Patrick discreetly kept\r\nin the background.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo misfortune has happened to the queen?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Buckingham, the\r\ninstant he came up, throwing all his fear and love into the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe not; nevertheless I believe she runs some great peril from\r\nwhich your Grace alone can extricate her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Buckingham. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? I should be too happy to be of any\r\nservice to her. Speak, speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake this letter,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis letter! From whom comes this letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom her Majesty, as I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom her Majesty!\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham, becoming so pale that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nfeared he would faint as he broke the seal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this rent?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, showing D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan a place where it had\r\nbeen pierced through.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not see that; it was the sword of the\r\nComte de Wardes which made that hole, when he gave me a good thrust in\r\nthe breast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wounded?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Buckingham, as he opened the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing but a scratch,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust heaven, what have I read?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the duke. \xe2\x80\x9cPatrick, remain here,\r\nor rather join the king, wherever he may be, and tell his Majesty that\r\nI humbly beg him to excuse me, but an affair of the greatest importance\r\nrecalls me to London. Come, monsieur, come!\xe2\x80\x9d and both set off towards\r\nthe capital at full gallop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI.\r\nTHE COUNTESS DE WINTER\r\n\r\n\r\nAs they rode along, the duke endeavored to draw from D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, not\r\nall that had happened, but what D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan himself knew. By adding all\r\nthat he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances,\r\nhe was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the\r\nseriousness of which, for the rest, the queen\xe2\x80\x99s letter, short but\r\nexplicit, gave him the clue. But that which astonished him most was\r\nthat the cardinal, so deeply interested in preventing this young man\r\nfrom setting his foot in England, had not succeeded in arresting him on\r\nthe road. It was then, upon the manifestation of this astonishment,\r\nthat D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan related to him the precaution taken, and how, thanks to\r\nthe devotion of his three friends, whom he had left scattered and\r\nbleeding on the road, he had succeeded in coming off with a single\r\nsword thrust, which had pierced the queen\xe2\x80\x99s letter and for which he had\r\nrepaid M. de Wardes with such terrible coin. While he was listening to\r\nthis recital, delivered with the greatest simplicity, the duke looked\r\nfrom time to time at the young man with astonishment, as if he could\r\nnot comprehend how so much prudence, courage, and devotedness could be\r\nallied with a countenance which indicated not more than twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe horses went like the wind, and in a few minutes they were at the\r\ngates of London. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke\r\nwould slacken his pace, but it was not so. He kept on his way at the\r\nsame rate, heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the road. In\r\nfact, in crossing the city two or three accidents of this kind\r\nhappened; but Buckingham did not even turn his head to see what became\r\nof those he had knocked down. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan followed him amid cries which\r\nstrongly resembled curses.\r\n\r\nOn entering the court of his h\xc3\xb4tel, Buckingham sprang from his horse,\r\nand without thinking what became of the animal, threw the bridle on his\r\nneck, and sprang toward the vestibule. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan did the same, with a\r\nlittle more concern, however, for the noble creatures, whose merits he\r\nfully appreciated; but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four\r\ngrooms run from the kitchens and the stables, and busy themselves with\r\nthe steeds.\r\n\r\nThe duke walked so fast that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had some trouble in keeping up\r\nwith him. He passed through several apartments, of an elegance of which\r\neven the greatest nobles of France had not even an idea, and arrived at\r\nlength in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of\r\nrichness. In the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the\r\ntapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore\r\nsuspended from his neck by a chain of the same metal. With discretion\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan remained behind; but at the moment when Buckingham crossed\r\nthe threshold, he turned round, and seeing the hesitation of the young\r\nman, \xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9cand if you have the good fortune to be\r\nadmitted to her Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s presence, tell her what you have seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this invitation, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan followed the duke, who closed\r\nthe door after them. The two found themselves in a small chapel covered\r\nwith a tapestry of Persian silk worked with gold, and brilliantly\r\nlighted with a vast number of candles. Over a species of altar, and\r\nbeneath a canopy of blue velvet, surmounted by white and red plumes,\r\nwas a full-length portrait of Anne of Austria, so perfect in its\r\nresemblance that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding it.\r\nOne might believe the queen was about to speak. On the altar, and\r\nbeneath the portrait, was the casket containing the diamond studs.\r\n\r\nThe duke approached the altar, knelt as a priest might have done before\r\na crucifix, and opened the casket. \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, drawing from the\r\ncasket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\r\nare the precious studs which I have taken an oath should be buried with\r\nme. The queen gave them to me, the queen requires them again. Her will\r\nbe done, like that of God, in all things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, he began to kiss, one after the other, those dear studs with\r\nwhich he was about to part. All at once he uttered a terrible cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, anxiously; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat has\r\nhappened to you, my Lord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll is lost!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Buckingham, becoming as pale as a corpse; \xe2\x80\x9ctwo of\r\nthe studs are wanting, there are only ten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you have lost them, my Lord, or do you think they have been\r\nstolen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have been stolen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the duke, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is the cardinal who\r\nhas dealt this blow. Hold; see! The ribbons which held them have been\r\ncut with scissors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf my Lord suspects they have been stolen, perhaps the person who\r\nstole them still has them in his hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, wait!\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only time I have worn these studs was\r\nat a ball given by the king eight days ago at Windsor. The Comtesse de\r\nWinter, with whom I had quarreled, became reconciled to me at that\r\nball. That reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous\r\nwoman. I have never seen her from that day. The woman is an agent of\r\nthe cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has agents, then, throughout the world?\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham, grating his teeth with rage. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is a\r\nterrible antagonist. But when is this ball to take place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonday next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonday next! Still five days before us. That\xe2\x80\x99s more time than we want.\r\nPatrick!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the duke, opening the door of the chapel, \xe2\x80\x9cPatrick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHis confidential valet appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy jeweler and my secretary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe valet went out with a mute promptitude which showed him accustomed\r\nto obey blindly and without reply.\r\n\r\nBut although the jeweler had been mentioned first, it was the secretary\r\nwho first made his appearance. This was simply because he lived in the\r\nh\xc3\xb4tel. He found Buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber, writing\r\norders with his own hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jackson,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cgo instantly to the Lord Chancellor, and tell\r\nhim that I charge him with the execution of these orders. I wish them\r\nto be promulgated immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my Lord, if the Lord Chancellor interrogates me upon the motives\r\nwhich may have led your Grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure,\r\nwhat shall I reply?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat such is my pleasure, and that I answer for my will to no man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill that be the answer,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the secretary, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich he\r\nmust transmit to his Majesty if, by chance, his Majesty should have the\r\ncuriosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of Great\r\nBritain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, Mr. Jackson,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Buckingham. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will say, in that\r\ncase, to the king that I am determined on war, and that this measure is\r\nmy first act of hostility against France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe secretary bowed and retired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are safe on that side,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham, turning toward D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the studs are not yet gone to Paris, they will not arrive till\r\nafter you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s ports, and without particular permission, not one dare lift\r\nan anchor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the\r\nunlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king\r\nin the prosecution of his intrigues. Buckingham saw by the expression\r\nof the young man\xe2\x80\x99s face what was passing in his mind, and he smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, Anne of Austria is my true queen. Upon a word\r\nfrom her, I would betray my country, I would betray my king, I would\r\nbetray my God. She asked me not to send the Protestants of La Rochelle\r\nthe assistance I promised them; I have not done so. I broke my word, it\r\nis true; but what signifies that? I obeyed my love; and have I not been\r\nrichly paid for that obedience? It was to that obedience I owe her\r\nportrait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the\r\ndestinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended. He was lost in\r\nthese reflections when the goldsmith entered. He was an Irishman\xe2\x80\x94one of\r\nthe most skillful of his craft, and who himself confessed that he\r\ngained a hundred thousand livres a year by the Duke of Buckingham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke, leading him into the chapel, \xe2\x80\x9clook at\r\nthese diamond studs, and tell me what they are worth apiece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe goldsmith cast a glance at the elegant manner in which they were\r\nset, calculated, one with another, what the diamonds were worth, and\r\nwithout hesitation said, \xe2\x80\x9cFifteen hundred pistoles each, my Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them?\r\nYou see there are two wanting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight days, my Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if I can have them by\r\nthe day after tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord, they shall be yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a jewel of a man, Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly; but that is not all. These\r\nstuds cannot be trusted to anybody; it must be done in the palace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible, my Lord! There is no one but myself can so execute them\r\nthat one cannot tell the new from the old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, my dear Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly, you are my prisoner. And if you wish\r\never to leave my palace, you cannot; so make the best of it. Name to me\r\nsuch of your workmen as you need, and point out the tools they must\r\nbring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe goldsmith knew the duke. He knew all objection would be useless,\r\nand instantly determined how to act.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I be permitted to inform my wife?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you may even see her if you like, my dear Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly. Your\r\ncaptivity shall be mild, be assured; and as every inconvenience\r\ndeserves its indemnification, here is, in addition to the price of the\r\nstuds, an order for a thousand pistoles, to make you forget the\r\nannoyance I cause you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this\r\nminister, who thus open-handed, sported with men and millions.\r\n\r\nAs to the goldsmith, he wrote to his wife, sending her the order for\r\nthe thousand pistoles, and charging her to send him, in exchange, his\r\nmost skillful apprentice, an assortment of diamonds, of which he gave\r\nthe names and the weight, and the necessary tools.\r\n\r\nBuckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him, and\r\nwhich, at the end of half an hour, was transformed into a workshop.\r\nThen he placed a sentinel at each door, with an order to admit nobody\r\nupon any pretense but his _valet de chambre_, Patrick. We need not add\r\nthat the goldsmith, O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly, and his assistant, were prohibited from\r\ngoing out under any pretext. This point, settled, the duke turned to\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, my young friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cEngland is all our own.\r\nWhat do you wish for? What do you desire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bed, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cAt present, I confess, that is\r\nthe thing I stand most in need of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBuckingham gave D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan a chamber adjoining his own. He wished to\r\nhave the young man at hand\xe2\x80\x94not that he at all mistrusted him, but for\r\nthe sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the\r\nqueen.\r\n\r\nIn one hour after, the ordinance was published in London that no vessel\r\nbound for France should leave port, not even the packet boat with\r\nletters. In the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between\r\nthe two kingdoms.\r\n\r\nOn the day after the morrow, by eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the two diamond studs\r\nwere finished, and they were so completely imitated, so perfectly\r\nalike, that Buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones,\r\nand experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was. He\r\nimmediately called D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to him, \xe2\x80\x9care the diamond\r\nstuds that you came to bring; and be my witness that I have done all\r\nthat human power could do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe satisfied, my Lord, I will tell all that I have seen. But does your\r\nGrace mean to give me the studs without the casket?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe casket would encumber you. Besides, the casket is the more\r\nprecious from being all that is left to me. You will say that I keep\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will perform your commission, word for word, my Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Buckingham, looking earnestly at the young man, \xe2\x80\x9chow\r\nshall I ever acquit myself of the debt I owe you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan blushed up to the whites of his eyes. He saw that the duke\r\nwas searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea\r\nthat the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with\r\nEnglish gold was strangely repugnant to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us understand each other, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cand let\r\nus make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no mistake.\r\nI am in the service of the King and Queen of France, and form part of\r\nthe company of Monsieur Dessessart, who, as well as his brother-in-law,\r\nMonsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, is particularly attached to their Majesties. What\r\nI have done, then, has been for the queen, and not at all for your\r\nGrace. And still further, it is very probable I should not have done\r\nanything of this, if it had not been to make myself agreeable to\r\nsomeone who is my lady, as the queen is yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cand I even believe that I know that\r\nother person; it is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord, I have not named her!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the young man, warmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke; \xe2\x80\x9cand it is to this person I am bound to\r\ndischarge my debt of gratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have said, my Lord; for truly, at this moment when there is\r\nquestion of war, I confess to you that I see nothing in your Grace but\r\nan Englishman, and consequently an enemy whom I should have much\r\ngreater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at\r\nWindsor or the corridors of the Louvre\xe2\x80\x94all which, however, will not\r\nprevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from\r\nlaying down my life, if there be need of it, to accomplish it; but I\r\nrepeat it to your Grace, without your having personally on that account\r\nmore to thank me for in this second interview than for what I did for\r\nyou in the first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe say, \xe2\x80\x98Proud as a Scotsman,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the Duke of Buckingham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we say, \xe2\x80\x98Proud as a Gascon,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Gascons are\r\nthe Scots of France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan bowed to the duke, and was retiring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, are you going away in that manner? Where, and how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFore Gad, these Frenchmen have no consideration!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten that England was an island, and that you were the king\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the riverside, ask for the brig _Sund_, and give this letter to\r\nthe captain; he will convey you to a little port, where certainly you\r\nare not expected, and which is ordinarily only frequented by\r\nfishermen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe name of that port?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSt. Valery; but listen. When you have arrived there you will go to a\r\nmean tavern, without a name and without a sign\xe2\x80\x94a mere fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s hut.\r\nYou cannot be mistaken; there is but one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfterward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will ask for the host, and will repeat to him the word \xe2\x80\x98Forward!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich means?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn French, _En avant_. It is the password. He will give you a horse\r\nall saddled, and will point out to you the road you ought to take. You\r\nwill find, in the same way, four relays on your route. If you will give\r\nat each of these relays your address in Paris, the four horses will\r\nfollow you thither. You already know two of them, and you appeared to\r\nappreciate them like a judge. They were those we rode on; and you may\r\nrely upon me for the others not being inferior to them. These horses\r\nare equipped for the field. However proud you may be, you will not\r\nrefuse to accept one of them, and to request your three companions to\r\naccept the others\xe2\x80\x94that is, in order to make war against us. Besides,\r\nthe end justified the means, as you Frenchmen say, does it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my Lord, I accept them,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cand if it please God,\r\nwe will make a good use of your presents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, your hand, young man. Perhaps we shall soon meet on the\r\nfield of battle; but in the meantime we shall part good friends, I\r\nhope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my Lord; but with the hope of soon becoming enemies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe satisfied; I promise you that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI depend upon your word, my Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan bowed to the duke, and made his way as quickly as possible\r\nto the riverside. Opposite the Tower of London he found the vessel that\r\nhad been named to him, delivered his letter to the captain, who after\r\nhaving it examined by the governor of the port made immediate\r\npreparations to sail.\r\n\r\nFifty vessels were waiting to set out. Passing alongside one of them,\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of Meung\xe2\x80\x94the same\r\nwhom the unknown gentleman had called Milady, and whom D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had\r\nthought so handsome; but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair\r\nwind, his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a\r\nglimpse of her.\r\n\r\nThe next day about nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, he landed at St.\r\nValery. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan went instantly in search of the inn, and easily\r\ndiscovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it. War between\r\nEngland and France was talked of as near and certain, and the jolly\r\nsailors were having a carousal.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan made his way through the crowd, advanced toward the host,\r\nand pronounced the word \xe2\x80\x9cForward!\xe2\x80\x9d The host instantly made him a sign\r\nto follow, went out with him by a door which opened into a yard, led\r\nhim to the stable, where a saddled horse awaited him, and asked him if\r\nhe stood in need of anything else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know the route I am to follow,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo from hence to Blangy, and from Blangy to Neufch\xc3\xa2tel. At Neufch\xc3\xa2tel,\r\ngo to the tavern of the Golden Harrow, give the password to the\r\nlandlord, and you will find, as you have here, a horse ready saddled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I anything to pay?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything is paid,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the host, \xe2\x80\x9cand liberally. Begone, and may\r\nGod guide you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young man, and set off at full gallop.\r\n\r\nFour hours later he was in Neufch\xc3\xa2tel. He strictly followed the\r\ninstructions he had received. At Neufch\xc3\xa2tel, as at St. Valery, he found\r\na horse quite ready and awaiting him. He was about to remove the\r\npistols from the saddle he had quit to the one he was about to fill,\r\nbut he found the holsters furnished with similar pistols.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour address at Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xc3\xb4tel of the Guards, company of Dessessart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the questioner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich route must I take?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in his turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat of Rouen; but you will leave the city on your right. You must\r\nstop at the little village of Eccuis, in which there is but one\r\ntavern\xe2\x80\x94the Shield of France. Don\xe2\x80\x99t condemn it from appearances; you\r\nwill find a horse in the stables quite as good as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same password?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdieu, master!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good journey, gentlemen! Do you want anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan shook his head, and set off at full speed. At Eccuis, the\r\nsame scene was repeated. He found as provident a host and a fresh\r\nhorse. He left his address as he had done before, and set off again at\r\nthe same pace for Pontoise. At Pontoise he changed his horse for the\r\nlast time, and at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock galloped into the yard of Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nh\xc3\xb4tel. He had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville received him as if he had seen him that same morning;\r\nonly, when pressing his hand a little more warmly than usual, he\r\ninformed him that the company of Dessessart was on duty at the Louvre,\r\nand that he might repair at once to his post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII.\r\nTHE BALLET OF LA MERLAISON\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, nothing was talked of in Paris but the ball which the\r\naldermen of the city were to give to the king and queen, and in which\r\ntheir Majesties were to dance the famous La Merlaison\xe2\x80\x94the favorite\r\nballet of the king.\r\n\r\nEight days had been occupied in preparations at the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville for\r\nthis important evening. The city carpenters had erected scaffolds upon\r\nwhich the invited ladies were to be placed; the city grocer had\r\nornamented the chambers with two hundred _flambeaux_ of white wax, a\r\npiece of luxury unheard of at that period; and twenty violins were\r\nordered, and the price for them fixed at double the usual rate, upon\r\ncondition, said the report, that they should be played all night.\r\n\r\nAt ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning the Sieur de la Coste, ensign in the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s Guards, followed by two officers and several archers of that\r\nbody, came to the city registrar, named Clement, and demanded of him\r\nall the keys of the rooms and offices of the h\xc3\xb4tel. These keys were\r\ngiven up to him instantly. Each of them had a ticket attached to it, by\r\nwhich it might be recognized; and from that moment the Sieur de la\r\nCoste was charged with the care of all the doors and all the avenues.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock came in his turn Duhallier, captain of the Guards,\r\nbringing with him fifty archers, who were distributed immediately\r\nthrough the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville, at the doors assigned them.\r\n\r\nAt three o\xe2\x80\x99clock came two companies of the Guards, one French, the\r\nother Swiss. The company of French guards was composed of half of M.\r\nDuhallier\xe2\x80\x99s men and half of M. Dessessart\xe2\x80\x99s men.\r\n\r\nAt six in the evening the guests began to come. As fast as they\r\nentered, they were placed in the grand saloon, on the platforms\r\nprepared for them.\r\n\r\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock Madame la Premi\xc3\xa8re Pr\xc3\xa9sidente arrived. As next to the\r\nqueen, she was the most considerable personage of the f\xc3\xaate, she was\r\nreceived by the city officials, and placed in a box opposite to that\r\nwhich the queen was to occupy.\r\n\r\nAt ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the king\xe2\x80\x99s collation, consisting of preserves and other\r\ndelicacies, was prepared in the little room on the side of the church\r\nof St. Jean, in front of the silver buffet of the city, which was\r\nguarded by four archers.\r\n\r\nAt midnight great cries and loud acclamations were heard. It was the\r\nking, who was passing through the streets which led from the Louvre to\r\nthe H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville, and which were all illuminated with colored\r\nlanterns.\r\n\r\nImmediately the aldermen, clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by\r\nsix sergeants, each holding a _flambeau_ in his hand, went to attend\r\nupon the king, whom they met on the steps, where the provost of the\r\nmerchants made him the speech of welcome\xe2\x80\x94a compliment to which his\r\nMajesty replied with an apology for coming so late, laying the blame\r\nupon the cardinal, who had detained him till eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, talking of\r\naffairs of state.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty, in full dress, was accompanied by his royal Highness, M.\r\nle Comte de Soissons, by the Grand Prior, by the Duc de Longueville, by\r\nthe Duc d\xe2\x80\x99Eub\xc5\x93uf, by the Comte d\xe2\x80\x99Harcourt, by the Comte de la\r\nRoche-Guyon, by M. de Liancourt, by M. de Baradas, by the Comte de\r\nCramail, and by the Chevalier de Souveray. Everybody noticed that the\r\nking looked dull and preoccupied.\r\n\r\nA private room had been prepared for the king and another for Monsieur.\r\nIn each of these closets were placed masquerade dresses. The same had\r\nbeen done for the queen and Madame the President. The nobles and ladies\r\nof their Majesties\xe2\x80\x99 suites were to dress, two by two, in chambers\r\nprepared for the purpose. Before entering his closet the king desired\r\nto be informed the moment the cardinal arrived.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour after the entrance of the king, fresh acclamations were\r\nheard; these announced the arrival of the queen. The aldermen did as\r\nthey had done before, and preceded by their sergeants, advanced to\r\nreceive their illustrious guest. The queen entered the great hall; and\r\nit was remarked that, like the king, she looked dull and even weary.\r\n\r\nAt the moment she entered, the curtain of a small gallery which to that\r\ntime had been closed, was drawn, and the pale face of the cardinal\r\nappeared, he being dressed as a Spanish cavalier. His eyes were fixed\r\nupon those of the queen, and a smile of terrible joy passed over his\r\nlips; the queen did not wear her diamond studs.\r\n\r\nThe queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the\r\ncity dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies. All at\r\nonce the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the\r\nhall. The cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice, and the king was\r\nvery pale.\r\n\r\nThe king made his way through the crowd without a mask, and the ribbons\r\nof his doublet scarcely tied. He went straight to the queen, and in an\r\naltered voice said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, madame, have you not thought proper to wear\r\nyour diamond studs, when you know it would give me so much\r\ngratification?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe queen cast a glance around her, and saw the cardinal behind, with a\r\ndiabolical smile on his countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the queen, with a faltering voice, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause, in the\r\nmidst of such a crowd as this, I feared some accident might happen to\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you were wrong, madame. If I made you that present it was that you\r\nmight adorn yourself therewith. I tell you that you were wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice of the king was tremulous with anger. Everybody looked and\r\nlistened with astonishment, comprehending nothing of what passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire,\xe2\x80\x9d said the queen, \xe2\x80\x9cI can send for them to the Louvre, where they\r\nare, and thus your Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s wishes will be complied with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo so, madame, do so, and that at once; for within an hour the ballet\r\nwill commence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe queen bent in token of submission, and followed the ladies who were\r\nto conduct her to her room. On his part the king returned to his\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly. Everybody\r\nhad remarked that something had passed between the king and queen; but\r\nboth of them had spoken so low that everybody, out of respect, withdrew\r\nseveral steps, so that nobody had heard anything. The violins began to\r\nsound with all their might, but nobody listened to them.\r\n\r\nThe king came out first from his room. He was in a most elegant hunting\r\ncostume; and Monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him. This\r\nwas the costume that best became the king. So dressed, he really\r\nappeared the first gentleman of his kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal drew near to the king, and placed in his hand a small\r\ncasket. The king opened it, and found in it two diamond studs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded he of the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the latter; \xe2\x80\x9conly, if the queen has the studs, which\r\nI very much doubt, count them, sire, and if you only find ten, ask her\r\nMajesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him; but he had\r\nnot time to address any question to him\xe2\x80\x94a cry of admiration burst from\r\nevery mouth. If the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his\r\nkingdom, the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the habit of a huntress became her admirably. She wore\r\na beaver hat with blue feathers, a surtout of gray-pearl velvet,\r\nfastened with diamond clasps, and a petticoat of blue satin,\r\nembroidered with silver. On her left shoulder sparkled the diamond\r\nstuds, on a bow of the same color as the plumes and the petticoat.\r\n\r\nThe king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation; although,\r\ndistant as they were from the queen, they could not count the studs.\r\nThe queen had them. The only question was, had she ten or twelve?\r\n\r\nAt that moment the violins sounded the signal for the ballet. The king\r\nadvanced toward Madame the President, with whom he was to dance, and\r\nhis Highness Monsieur with the queen. They took their places, and the\r\nballet began.\r\n\r\nThe king danced facing the queen, and every time he passed by her, he\r\ndevoured with his eyes those studs of which he could not ascertain the\r\nnumber. A cold sweat covered the brow of the cardinal.\r\n\r\nThe ballet lasted an hour, and had sixteen _entr\xc3\xa9es_. The ballet ended\r\namid the applause of the whole assemblage, and everyone reconducted his\r\nlady to her place; but the king took advantage of the privilege he had\r\nof leaving his lady, to advance eagerly toward the queen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the deference you have shown to my\r\nwishes, but I think you want two of the studs, and I bring them back to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words he held out to the queen the two studs the cardinal\r\nhad given him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, sire?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young queen, affecting surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are giving\r\nme, then, two more: I shall have fourteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact the king counted them, and the twelve studs were all on her\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe king called the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this mean, Monsieur Cardinal?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the king in a severe\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis means, sire,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I was desirous of\r\npresenting her Majesty with these two studs, and that not daring to\r\noffer them myself, I adopted this means of inducing her to accept\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am the more grateful to your Eminence,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Anne of Austria,\r\nwith a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious\r\ngallantry, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom being certain that these two studs alone have cost you\r\nas much as all the others cost his Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen saluting the king and the cardinal, the queen resumed her way to\r\nthe chamber in which she had dressed, and where she was to take off her\r\ncostume.\r\n\r\nThe attention which we have been obliged to give, during the\r\ncommencement of the chapter, to the illustrious personages we have\r\nintroduced into it, has diverted us for an instant from him to whom\r\nAnne of Austria owed the extraordinary triumph she had obtained over\r\nthe cardinal; and who, confounded, unknown, lost in the crowd gathered\r\nat one of the doors, looked on at this scene, comprehensible only to\r\nfour persons\xe2\x80\x94the king, the queen, his Eminence, and himself.\r\n\r\nThe queen had just regained her chamber, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was about to\r\nretire, when he felt his shoulder lightly touched. He turned and saw a\r\nyoung woman, who made him a sign to follow her. The face of this young\r\nwoman was covered with a black velvet mask; but notwithstanding this\r\nprecaution, which was in fact taken rather against others than against\r\nhim, he at once recognized his usual guide, the light and intelligent\r\nMme. Bonacieux.\r\n\r\nOn the evening before, they had scarcely seen each other for a moment\r\nat the apartment of the Swiss guard, Germain, whither D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had\r\nsent for her. The haste which the young woman was in to convey to the\r\nqueen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented\r\nthe two lovers from exchanging more than a few words. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\ntherefore followed Mme. Bonacieux moved by a double sentiment\xe2\x80\x94love and\r\ncuriosity. All the way, and in proportion as the corridors became more\r\ndeserted, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan wished to stop the young woman, seize her and gaze\r\nupon her, were it only for a minute; but quick as a bird she glided\r\nbetween his hands, and when he wished to speak to her, her finger\r\nplaced upon her mouth, with a little imperative gesture full of grace,\r\nreminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must\r\nblindly obey, and which forbade him even to make the slightest\r\ncomplaint. At length, after winding about for a minute or two, Mme.\r\nBonacieux opened the door of a closet, which was entirely dark, and led\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan into it. There she made a fresh sign of silence, and opened\r\na second door concealed by tapestry. The opening of this door disclosed\r\na brilliant light, and she disappeared.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan remained for a moment motionless, asking himself where he\r\ncould be; but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber,\r\ntogether with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same\r\naperture, the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once\r\nrespectful and refined, and the word \xe2\x80\x9cMajesty\xe2\x80\x9d several times repeated,\r\nindicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napartment. The young man waited in comparative darkness and listened.\r\n\r\nThe queen appeared cheerful and happy, which seemed to astonish the\r\npersons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost\r\nalways sad and full of care. The queen attributed this joyous feeling\r\nto the beauty of the f\xc3\xaate, to the pleasure she had experienced in the\r\nballet; and as it is not permissible to contradict a queen, whether she\r\nsmile or weep, everybody expatiated on the gallantry of the aldermen of\r\nthe city of Paris.\r\n\r\nAlthough D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan did not at all know the queen, he soon\r\ndistinguished her voice from the others, at first by a slightly foreign\r\naccent, and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon\r\nall royal words. He heard her approach and withdraw from the partially\r\nopen door; and twice or three times he even saw the shadow of a person\r\nintercept the light.\r\n\r\nAt length a hand and an arm, surpassingly beautiful in their form and\r\nwhiteness, glided through the tapestry. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan at once comprehended\r\nthat this was his recompense. He cast himself on his knees, seized the\r\nhand, and touched it respectfully with his lips. Then the hand was\r\nwithdrawn, leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring.\r\nThe door immediately closed, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan found himself again in\r\ncomplete obscurity.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan placed the ring on his finger, and again waited; it was\r\nevident that all was not yet over. After the reward of his devotion,\r\nthat of his love was to come. Besides, although the ballet was danced,\r\nthe evening had scarcely begun. Supper was to be served at three, and\r\nthe clock of St. Jean had struck three quarters past two.\r\n\r\nThe sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining chamber. The\r\ncompany was then heard departing; then the door of the closet in which\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was, was opened, and Mme. Bonacieux entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou at last?\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman, placing her hand upon his lips;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csilence, and go the same way you came!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where and when shall I see you again?\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA note which you will find at home will tell you. Begone, begone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words she opened the door of the corridor, and pushed\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan out of the room. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan obeyed like a child, without the\r\nleast resistance or objection, which proved that he was really in love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII.\r\nTHE RENDEZVOUS\r\n\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan ran home immediately, and although it was three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in\r\nthe morning and he had some of the worst quarters of Paris to traverse,\r\nhe met with no misadventure. Everyone knows that drunkards and lovers\r\nhave a protecting deity.\r\n\r\nHe found the door of his passage open, sprang up the stairs and knocked\r\nsoftly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey. Planchet*,\r\nwhom he had sent home two hours before from the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville, telling\r\nhim to sit up for him, opened the door for him.\r\n\r\n* The reader may ask, \xe2\x80\x9cHow came Planchet here?\xe2\x80\x9d when he was left \xe2\x80\x9cstiff\r\nas a rush\xe2\x80\x9d in London. In the intervening time Buckingham perhaps sent\r\nhim to Paris, as he did the horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas anyone brought a letter for me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one has _brought_ a letter, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Planchet; \xe2\x80\x9cbut one\r\nhas come of itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, blockhead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to say that when I came in, although I had the key of your\r\napartment in my pocket, and that key had never quit me, I found a\r\nletter on the green table cover in your bedroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where is that letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left it where I found it, monsieur. It is not natural for letters to\r\nenter people\xe2\x80\x99s houses in this manner. If the window had been open or\r\neven ajar, I should think nothing of it; but, no\xe2\x80\x94all was hermetically\r\nsealed. Beware, monsieur; there is certainly some magic underneath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the young man had darted in to his chamber, and opened the\r\nletter. It was from Mme. Bonacieux, and was expressed in these terms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are many thanks to be offered to you, and to be transmitted to\r\nyou. Be this evening about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock at St. Cloud, in front of the\r\npavilion which stands at the corner of the house of M. d\xe2\x80\x99Estr\xc3\xa9es.\xe2\x80\x94C.B.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile reading this letter, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan felt his heart dilated and\r\ncompressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the\r\nhearts of lovers.\r\n\r\nIt was the first billet he had received; it was the first rendezvous\r\nthat had been granted him. His heart, swelled by the intoxication of\r\njoy, felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial\r\nparadise called Love!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet, who had observed his master grow red\r\nand pale successively, \xe2\x80\x9cdid I not guess truly? Is it not some bad\r\naffair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken, Planchet,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cand as a proof,\r\nthere is a crown to drink my health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to Monsieur for the crown he has given me, and I\r\npromise him to follow his instructions exactly; but it is not the less\r\ntrue that letters which come in this way into shut-up houses\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFall from heaven, my friend, fall from heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Monsieur is satisfied?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Planchet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Planchet, I am the happiest of men!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I may profit by Monsieur\xe2\x80\x99s happiness, and go to bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay the blessings of heaven fall upon Monsieur! But it is not the less\r\ntrue that that letter\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Planchet retired, shaking his head with an air of doubt, which the\r\nliberality of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had not entirely effaced.\r\n\r\nLeft alone, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan read and reread his billet. Then he kissed and\r\nrekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful\r\nmistress. At length he went to bed, fell asleep, and had golden dreams.\r\n\r\nAt seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning he arose and called Planchet, who at\r\nthe second summons opened the door, his countenance not yet quite freed\r\nfrom the anxiety of the preceding night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlanchet,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going out for all day, perhaps. You\r\nare, therefore, your own master till seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening; but\r\nat seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are going again, it appears, to have our\r\nhides pierced in all sorts of ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will take your musketoon and your pistols.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, now! Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I say so?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Planchet. \xe2\x80\x9cI was sure of it\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ncursed letter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid, you idiot; there is nothing in hand but a party of\r\npleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, like the charming journey the other day, when it rained bullets\r\nand produced a crop of steel traps!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you are really afraid, Monsieur Planchet,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI will go without you. I prefer traveling alone to having\r\na companion who entertains the least fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur does me wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet; \xe2\x80\x9cI thought he had seen me at\r\nwork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I thought perhaps you had worn out all your courage the first\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur shall see that upon occasion I have some left; only I beg\r\nMonsieur not to be too prodigal of it if he wishes it to last long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this\r\nevening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I count on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the appointed hour I shall be ready; only I believed that Monsieur\r\nhad but one horse in the Guard stables.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps there is but one at this moment; but by this evening there\r\nwill be four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears that our journey was a remounting journey, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; and nodding to Planchet, he went out.\r\n\r\nM. Bonacieux was at his door. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s intention was to go out\r\nwithout speaking to the worthy mercer; but the latter made so polite\r\nand friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged, not only to\r\nstop, but to enter into conversation with him.\r\n\r\nBesides, how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a\r\nhusband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same\r\nevening at St. Cloud, opposite D\xe2\x80\x99Estr\xc3\xa9es\xe2\x80\x99s pavilion? D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\napproached him with the most amiable air he could assume.\r\n\r\nThe conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man.\r\nM. Bonacieux, who was ignorant that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had overheard his\r\nconversation with the stranger of Meung, related to his young tenant\r\nthe persecutions of that monster, M. de Laffemas, whom he never ceased\r\nto designate, during his account, by the title of the \xe2\x80\x9ccardinal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexecutioner,\xe2\x80\x9d and expatiated at great length upon the Bastille, the\r\nbolts, the wickets, the dungeons, the gratings, the instruments of\r\ntorture.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance, and when he had\r\nfinished said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Madame Bonacieux, do you know who carried her\r\noff?\xe2\x80\x94For I do not forget that I owe to that unpleasant circumstance the\r\ngood fortune of having made your acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cthey took good care not to tell me that; and my\r\nwife, on her part, has sworn to me by all that\xe2\x80\x99s sacred that she does\r\nnot know. But you,\xe2\x80\x9d continued M. Bonacieux, in a tone of perfect good\r\nfellowship, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat has become of you all these days? I have not seen you\r\nnor your friends, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you could gather all that dust that\r\nI saw Planchet brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of\r\nParis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux, my friends and I have been\r\non a little journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFar from here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lord, no! About forty leagues only. We went to take Monsieur Athos\r\nto the waters of Forges, where my friends still remain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have returned, have you not?\xe2\x80\x9d replied M. Bonacieux, giving to\r\nhis countenance a most sly air. \xe2\x80\x9cA handsome young fellow like you does\r\nnot obtain long leaves of absence from his mistress; and we were\r\nimpatiently waited for at Paris, were we not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cI confess it, and so much\r\nmore the readily, my dear Bonacieux, as I see there is no concealing\r\nanything from you. Yes, I was expected, and very impatiently, I\r\nacknowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA slight shade passed over the brow of Bonacieux, but so slight that\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan did not perceive it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we are going to be recompensed for our diligence?\xe2\x80\x9d continued the\r\nmercer, with a trifling alteration in his voice\xe2\x80\x94so trifling, indeed,\r\nthat D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary\r\nshade which, an instant before, had darkened the countenance of the\r\nworthy man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, may you be a true prophet!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; what I say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cis only that I may know whether I\r\nam delaying you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy that question, my dear host?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you intend to\r\nsit up for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but since my arrest and the robbery that was committed in my\r\nhouse, I am alarmed every time I hear a door open, particularly in the\r\nnight. What the deuce can you expect? I am no swordsman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed if I return at one, two or three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nmorning; indeed, do not be alarmed if I do not come at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time Bonacieux became so pale that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan could not help\r\nperceiving it, and asked him what was the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing. Since my misfortunes I have\r\nbeen subject to faintnesses, which seize me all at once, and I have\r\njust felt a cold shiver. Pay no attention to it; you have nothing to\r\noccupy yourself with but being happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I have full occupation, for I am so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet; wait a little! This evening, you said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this evening will come, thank God! And perhaps you look for it\r\nwith as much impatience as I do; perhaps this evening Madame Bonacieux\r\nwill visit the conjugal domicile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Bonacieux is not at liberty this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the husband,\r\nseriously; \xe2\x80\x9cshe is detained at the Louvre this evening by her duties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the worse for you, my dear host, so much the worse! When I am\r\nhappy, I wish all the world to be so; but it appears that is not\r\npossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man departed, laughing at the joke, which he thought he alone\r\ncould comprehend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmuse yourself well!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bonacieux, in a sepulchral tone.\r\n\r\nBut D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was too far off to hear him; and if he had heard him in\r\nthe disposition of mind he then enjoyed, he certainly would not have\r\nremarked it.\r\n\r\nHe took his way toward the h\xc3\xb4tel of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville; his visit of the\r\nday before, it is to be remembered, had been very short and very little\r\nexplicative.\r\n\r\nHe found Tr\xc3\xa9ville in a joyful mood. He had thought the king and queen\r\ncharming at the ball. It is true the cardinal had been particularly\r\nill-tempered. He had retired at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock under the pretense of being\r\nindisposed. As to their Majesties, they did not return to the Louvre\r\ntill six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tr\xc3\xa9ville, lowering his voice, and looking into every corner\r\nof the apartment to see if they were alone, \xe2\x80\x9cnow let us talk about\r\nyourself, my young friend; for it is evident that your happy return has\r\nsomething to do with the joy of the king, the triumph of the queen, and\r\nthe humiliation of his Eminence. You must look out for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I to fear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cas long as I shall have the\r\nluck to enjoy the favor of their Majesties?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything, believe me. The cardinal is not the man to forget a\r\nmystification until he has settled account with the mystifier; and the\r\nmystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young Gascon\r\nof my acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself, and\r\nknows that I have been to London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil! You have been to London! Was it from London you brought\r\nthat beautiful diamond that glitters on your finger? Beware, my dear\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan! A present from an enemy is not a good thing. Are there not\r\nsome Latin verses upon that subject? Stop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, doubtless,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who had never been able to cram\r\nthe first rudiments of that language into his head, and who had by his\r\nignorance driven his master to despair, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, doubtless there is one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere certainly is one,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, who had a tincture of\r\nliterature, \xe2\x80\x9cand Monsieur de Benserade was quoting it to me the other\r\nday. Stop a minute\xe2\x80\x94ah, this is it: \xe2\x80\x98Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhich means, \xe2\x80\x98Beware of the enemy who makes you presents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis diamond does not come from an enemy, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cit comes from the queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the queen! Oh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it is indeed a\r\ntrue royal jewel, which is worth a thousand pistoles if it is worth a\r\ndenier. By whom did the queen send you this jewel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe gave it to me herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the room adjoining the chamber in which she changed her toilet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiving me her hand to kiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have kissed the queen\xe2\x80\x99s hand?\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, looking\r\nearnestly at D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer Majesty did me the honor to grant me that favor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that in the presence of witnesses! Imprudent, thrice imprudent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur, be satisfied; nobody saw her,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and\r\nhe related to M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville how the affair came to pass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the women, the women!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old soldier. \xe2\x80\x9cI know them by\r\ntheir romantic imagination. Everything that savors of mystery charms\r\nthem. So you have seen the arm, that was all. You would meet the queen,\r\nand she would not know who you are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but thanks to this diamond,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville; \xe2\x80\x9cshall I give you counsel, good counsel,\r\nthe counsel of a friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will do me honor, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, off to the nearest goldsmith\xe2\x80\x99s, and sell that diamond for\r\nthe highest price you can get from him. However much of a Jew he may\r\nbe, he will give you at least eight hundred pistoles. Pistoles have no\r\nname, young man, and that ring has a terrible one, which may betray him\r\nwho wears it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSell this ring, a ring which comes from my sovereign? Never!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, at least turn the gem inside, you silly fellow; for everybody\r\nmust be aware that a cadet from Gascony does not find such stones in\r\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x99s jewel case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think, then, I have something to dread?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to say, young man, that he who sleeps over a mine the match of\r\nwhich is already lighted, may consider himself in safety in comparison\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, whom the positive tone of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\r\nbegan to disquiet, \xe2\x80\x9cthe devil! What must I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbove all things be always on your guard. The cardinal has a tenacious\r\nmemory and a long arm; you may depend upon it, he will repay you by\r\nsome ill turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut of what sort?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! How can I tell? Has he not all the tricks of a demon at his\r\ncommand? The least that can be expected is that you will be arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Will they dare to arrest a man in his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s service?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pardieu!_ They did not scruple much in the case of Athos. At all\r\nevents, young man, rely upon one who has been thirty years at court. Do\r\nnot lull yourself in security, or you will be lost; but, on the\r\ncontrary\xe2\x80\x94and it is I who say it\xe2\x80\x94see enemies in all directions. If\r\nanyone seeks a quarrel with you, shun it, were it with a child of ten\r\nyears old. If you are attacked by day or by night, fight, but retreat,\r\nwithout shame; if you cross a bridge, feel every plank of it with your\r\nfoot, lest one should give way beneath you; if you pass before a house\r\nwhich is being built, look up, for fear a stone should fall upon your\r\nhead; if you stay out late, be always followed by your lackey, and let\r\nyour lackey be armed\xe2\x80\x94if, by the by, you can be sure of your lackey.\r\nMistrust everybody, your friend, your brother, your mistress\xe2\x80\x94your\r\nmistress above all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan blushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mistress above all,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated he, mechanically; \xe2\x80\x9cand why her rather\r\nthan another?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause a mistress is one of the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s favorite means; he has not\r\none that is more expeditious. A woman will sell you for ten pistoles,\r\nwitness Delilah. You are acquainted with the Scriptures?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan thought of the appointment Mme. Bonacieux had made with him\r\nfor that very evening; but we are bound to say, to the credit of our\r\nhero, that the bad opinion entertained by M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville of women in\r\ngeneral, did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty\r\nhostess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, _\xc3\xa0 propos_,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat has become of your\r\nthree companions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I left them on my road\xe2\x80\x94Porthos at Chantilly, with a duel on his\r\nhands; Aramis at Cr\xc3\xa8vec\xc5\x93ur, with a ball in his shoulder; and Athos at\r\nAmiens, detained by an accusation of coining.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee there, now!\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville; \xe2\x80\x9cand how the devil did you\r\nescape?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy a miracle, monsieur, I must acknowledge, with a sword thrust in my\r\nbreast, and by nailing the Comte de Wardes on the byroad to Calais,\r\nlike a butterfly on a tapestry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere again! De Wardes, one of the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s men, a cousin of\r\nRochefort! Stop, my friend, I have an idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn your place, I would do one thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile his Eminence was seeking for me in Paris, I would take, without\r\nsound of drum or trumpet, the road to Picardy, and would go and make\r\nsome inquiries concerning my three companions. What the devil! They\r\nmerit richly that piece of attention on your part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe advice is good, monsieur, and tomorrow I will set out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow! Any why not this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis evening, monsieur, I am detained in Paris by indispensable\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, young man, young man, some flirtation or other. Take care, I\r\nrepeat to you, take care. It is woman who has ruined us, still ruins\r\nus, and will ruin us, as long as the world stands. Take my advice and\r\nset out this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have given your word, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s quite another thing; but promise me, if you should not be\r\nkilled tonight, that you will go tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you need money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have still fifty pistoles. That, I think, is as much as I shall\r\nwant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your companions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think they can be in need of any. We left Paris, each with\r\nseventy-five pistoles in his pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I see you again before your departure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not, monsieur, unless something new should happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, a pleasant journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan left M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, touched more than ever by his paternal\r\nsolicitude for his Musketeers.\r\n\r\nHe called successively at the abodes of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.\r\nNeither of them had returned. Their lackeys likewise were absent, and\r\nnothing had been heard of either the one or the other. He would have\r\ninquired after them of their mistresses, but he was neither acquainted\r\nwith Porthos\xe2\x80\x99s nor Aramis\xe2\x80\x99s, and as to Athos, he had none.\r\n\r\nAs he passed the H\xc3\xb4tel des Gardes, he took a glance into the stables.\r\nThree of the four horses had already arrived. Planchet, all\r\nastonishment, was busy grooming them, and had already finished two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet, on perceiving D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9chow glad I am\r\nto see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so, Planchet?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you place confidence in our landlord\xe2\x80\x94Monsieur Bonacieux?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Not the least in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you do quite right, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why this question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, while you were talking with him, I watched you without\r\nlistening to you; and, monsieur, his countenance changed color two or\r\nthree times!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPreoccupied as Monsieur was with the letter he had received, he did\r\nnot observe that; but I, whom the strange fashion in which that letter\r\ncame into the house had placed on my guard\xe2\x80\x94I did not lose a movement of\r\nhis features.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you found it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTraitorous, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill more; as soon as Monsieur had left and disappeared round the\r\ncorner of the street, Monsieur Bonacieux took his hat, shut his door,\r\nand set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems you are right, Planchet; all this appears to be a little\r\nmysterious; and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the\r\nmatter shall be categorically explained to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur jests, but Monsieur will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you have, Planchet? What must come is written.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite the contrary, Planchet; the more ill will I have toward Monsieur\r\nBonacieux, the more punctual I shall be in keeping the appointment made\r\nby that letter which makes you so uneasy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen that is Monsieur\xe2\x80\x99s determination?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndeniably, my friend. At nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, then, be ready here at the\r\nh\xc3\xb4tel, I will come and take you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPlanchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master\r\nrenounce his project, heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom\r\nthe third horse.\r\n\r\nAs to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, being at bottom a prudent youth, instead of returning\r\nhome, went and dined with the Gascon priest, who, at the time of the\r\ndistress of the four friends, had given them a breakfast of chocolate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV.\r\nTHE PAVILION\r\n\r\n\r\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was at the H\xc3\xb4tel des Gardes; he found\r\nPlanchet all ready. The fourth horse had arrived.\r\n\r\nPlanchet was armed with his musketoon and a pistol. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had his\r\nsword and placed two pistols in his belt; then both mounted and\r\ndeparted quietly. It was quite dark, and no one saw them go out.\r\nPlanchet took place behind his master, and kept at a distance of ten\r\npaces from him.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan crossed the quays, went out by the gate of La Conf\xc3\xa9rence and\r\nfollowed the road, much more beautiful then than it is now, which leads\r\nto St. Cloud.\r\n\r\nAs long as he was in the city, Planchet kept at the respectful distance\r\nhe had imposed upon himself; but as soon as the road began to be more\r\nlonely and dark, he drew softly nearer, so that when they entered the\r\nBois de Boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side\r\nwith his master. In fact, we must not dissemble that the oscillation of\r\nthe tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood\r\ngave him serious uneasiness. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan could not help perceiving that\r\nsomething more than usual was passing in the mind of his lackey and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Monsieur Planchet, what is the matter with us now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think, monsieur, that woods are like churches?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so, Planchet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we dare not speak aloud in one or the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why did you not dare to speak aloud, Planchet\xe2\x80\x94because you are\r\nafraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid of being heard? Yes, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid of being heard! Why, there is nothing improper in our\r\nconversation, my dear Planchet, and no one could find fault with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Planchet, recurring to his besetting idea,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat Monsieur Bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows, and\r\nsomething very unpleasant in the play of his lips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil makes you think of Bonacieux?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, we think of what we can, and not of what we will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you are a coward, Planchet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, we must not confound prudence with cowardice; prudence is a\r\nvirtue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are very virtuous, are you not, Planchet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder?\r\nHad we not better lower our heads?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, to whom M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrecommendation recurred, \xe2\x80\x9cthis animal will end by making me afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he put his horse into a trot.\r\n\r\nPlanchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his\r\nshadow, and was soon trotting by his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we going to continue this pace all night?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Planchet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; you are at your journey\xe2\x80\x99s end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, monsieur! And you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going a few steps farther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Monsieur leaves me here alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are afraid, Planchet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I only beg leave to observe to Monsieur that the night will be\r\nvery cold, that chills bring on rheumatism, and that a lackey who has\r\nthe rheumatism makes but a poor servant, particularly to a master as\r\nactive as Monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you are cold, Planchet, you can go into one of those cabarets\r\nthat you see yonder, and be in waiting for me at the door by six\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, I have eaten and drunk respectfully the crown you gave me\r\nthis morning, so that I have not a sou left in case I should be cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s half a pistole. Tomorrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan sprang from his horse, threw the bridle to Planchet, and\r\ndeparted at a quick pace, folding his cloak around him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord, how cold I am!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Planchet, as soon as he had lost\r\nsight of his master; and in such haste was he to warm himself that he\r\nwent straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban\r\ntavern, and knocked at the door.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who had plunged into a bypath, continued\r\nhis route and reached St. Cloud; but instead of following the main\r\nstreet he turned behind the ch\xc3\xa2teau, reached a sort of retired lane,\r\nand found himself soon in front of the pavilion named. It was situated\r\nin a very private spot. A high wall, at the angle of which was the\r\npavilion, ran along one side of this lane, and on the other was a\r\nlittle garden connected with a poor cottage which was protected by a\r\nhedge from passers-by.\r\n\r\nHe gained the place appointed, and as no signal had been given him by\r\nwhich to announce his presence, he waited.\r\n\r\nNot the least noise was to be heard; it might be imagined that he was a\r\nhundred miles from the capital. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan leaned against the hedge,\r\nafter having cast a glance behind it. Beyond that hedge, that garden,\r\nand that cottage, a dark mist enveloped with its folds that immensity\r\nwhere Paris slept\xe2\x80\x94a vast void from which glittered a few luminous\r\npoints, the funeral stars of that hell!\r\n\r\nBut for D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan all aspects were clothed happily, all ideas wore a\r\nsmile, all shades were diaphanous. The appointed hour was about to\r\nstrike. In fact, at the end of a few minutes the belfry of St. Cloud\r\nlet fall slowly ten strokes from its sonorous jaws. There was something\r\nmelancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the\r\nmiddle of the night; but each of those strokes, which made up the\r\nexpected hour, vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the angle of\r\nthe wall, of which all the windows were closed with shutters, except\r\none on the first story. Through this window shone a mild light which\r\nsilvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group\r\noutside the park. There could be no doubt that behind this little\r\nwindow, which threw forth such friendly beams, the pretty Mme.\r\nBonacieux expected him.\r\n\r\nWrapped in this sweet idea, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan waited half an hour without the\r\nleast impatience, his eyes fixed upon that charming little abode of\r\nwhich he could perceive a part of the ceiling with its gilded moldings,\r\nattesting the elegance of the rest of the apartment.\r\n\r\nThe belfry of St. Cloud sounded half past ten.\r\n\r\nThis time, without knowing why, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan felt a cold shiver run\r\nthrough his veins. Perhaps the cold began to affect him, and he took a\r\nperfectly physical sensation for a moral impression.\r\n\r\nThen the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly, and that the\r\nappointment was for eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He drew near to the window, and\r\nplacing himself so that a ray of light should fall upon the letter as\r\nhe held it, he drew it from his pocket and read it again; but he had\r\nnot been mistaken, the appointment was for ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He went and\r\nresumed his post, beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and\r\nthis solitude.\r\n\r\nEleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock sounded.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to Mme.\r\nBonacieux. He clapped his hands three times\xe2\x80\x94the ordinary signal of\r\nlovers; but nobody replied to him, not even an echo.\r\n\r\nHe then thought, with a touch of vexation, that perhaps the young woman\r\nhad fallen asleep while waiting for him. He approached the wall, and\r\ntried to climb it; but the wall had been recently pointed, and\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan could get no hold.\r\n\r\nAt that moment he thought of the trees, upon whose leaves the light\r\nstill shone; and as one of them drooped over the road, he thought that\r\nfrom its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the\r\npavilion.\r\n\r\nThe tree was easy to climb. Besides, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was but twenty years\r\nold, and consequently had not yet forgotten his schoolboy habits. In an\r\ninstant he was among the branches, and his keen eyes plunged through\r\nthe transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange thing, and one which made D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan tremble from the\r\nsole of his foot to the roots of his hair, to find that this soft\r\nlight, this calm lamp, enlightened a scene of fearful disorder. One of\r\nthe windows was broken, the door of the chamber had been beaten in and\r\nhung, split in two, on its hinges. A table, which had been covered with\r\nan elegant supper, was overturned. The decanters broken in pieces, and\r\nthe fruits crushed, strewed the floor. Everything in the apartment gave\r\nevidence of a violent and desperate struggle. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan even fancied\r\nhe could recognize amid this strange disorder, fragments of garments,\r\nand some bloody spots staining the cloth and the curtains. He hastened\r\nto descend into the street, with a frightful beating at his heart; he\r\nwished to see if he could find other traces of violence.\r\n\r\nThe little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nthen perceived a thing that he had not before remarked\xe2\x80\x94for nothing had\r\nled him to the examination\xe2\x80\x94that the ground, trampled here and\r\nhoofmarked there, presented confused traces of men and horses. Besides,\r\nthe wheels of a carriage, which appeared to have come from Paris, had\r\nmade a deep impression in the soft earth, which did not extend beyond\r\nthe pavilion, but turned again toward Paris.\r\n\r\nAt length D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in pursuing his researches, found near the wall a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s torn glove. This glove, wherever it had not touched the muddy\r\nground, was of irreproachable odor. It was one of those perfumed gloves\r\nthat lovers like to snatch from a pretty hand.\r\n\r\nAs D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan pursued his investigations, a more abundant and more icy\r\nsweat rolled in large drops from his forehead; his heart was oppressed\r\nby a horrible anguish; his respiration was broken and short. And yet he\r\nsaid, to reassure himself, that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in\r\ncommon with Mme. Bonacieux; that the young woman had made an\r\nappointment with him before the pavilion, and not in the pavilion; that\r\nshe might have been detained in Paris by her duties, or perhaps by the\r\njealousy of her husband.\r\n\r\nBut all these reasons were combated, destroyed, overthrown, by that\r\nfeeling of intimate pain which, on certain occasions, takes possession\r\nof our being, and cries to us so as to be understood unmistakably that\r\nsome great misfortune is hanging over us.\r\n\r\nThen D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan became almost wild. He ran along the high road, took\r\nthe path he had before taken, and reaching the ferry, interrogated the\r\nboatman.\r\n\r\nAbout seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, the boatman had taken over a young\r\nwoman, wrapped in a black mantle, who appeared to be very anxious not\r\nto be recognized; but entirely on account of her precautions, the\r\nboatman had paid more attention to her and discovered that she was\r\nyoung and pretty.\r\n\r\nThere were then, as now, a crowd of young and pretty women who came to\r\nSt. Cloud, and who had reasons for not being seen, and yet D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\ndid not for an instant doubt that it was Mme. Bonacieux whom the\r\nboatman had noticed.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan took advantage of the lamp which burned in the cabin of the\r\nferryman to read the billet of Mme. Bonacieux once again, and satisfy\r\nhimself that he had not been mistaken, that the appointment was at St.\r\nCloud and not elsewhere, before the D\xe2\x80\x99Estr\xc3\xa9es\xe2\x80\x99s pavilion and not in\r\nanother street. Everything conspired to prove to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan that his\r\npresentiments had not deceived him, and that a great misfortune had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nHe again ran back to the ch\xc3\xa2teau. It appeared to him that something\r\nmight have happened at the pavilion in his absence, and that fresh\r\ninformation awaited him. The lane was still deserted, and the same calm\r\nsoft light shone through the window.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan then thought of that cottage, silent and obscure, which had\r\nno doubt seen all, and could tell its tale. The gate of the enclosure\r\nwas shut; but he leaped over the hedge, and in spite of the barking of\r\na chained-up dog, went up to the cabin.\r\n\r\nNo one answered to his first knocking. A silence of death reigned in\r\nthe cabin as in the pavilion; but as the cabin was his last resource,\r\nhe knocked again.\r\n\r\nIt soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise within\xe2\x80\x94a timid\r\nnoise which seemed to tremble lest it should be heard.\r\n\r\nThen D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan ceased knocking, and prayed with an accent so full of\r\nanxiety and promises, terror and cajolery, that his voice was of a\r\nnature to reassure the most fearful. At length an old, worm-eaten\r\nshutter was opened, or rather pushed ajar, but closed again as soon as\r\nthe light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone\r\nupon the baldric, sword belt, and pistol pommels of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\nNevertheless, rapid as the movement had been, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had had time\r\nto get a glimpse of the head of an old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9clisten to me; I have been waiting\r\nfor someone who has not come. I am dying with anxiety. Has anything\r\nparticular happened in the neighborhood? Speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe window was again opened slowly, and the same face appeared, only it\r\nwas now still more pale than before.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan related his story simply, with the omission of names. He\r\ntold how he had a rendezvous with a young woman before that pavilion,\r\nand how, not seeing her come, he had climbed the linden tree, and by\r\nthe light of the lamp had seen the disorder of the chamber.\r\n\r\nThe old man listened attentively, making a sign only that it was all\r\nso; and then, when D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had ended, he shook his head with an air\r\nthat announced nothing good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of heaven, explain\r\nyourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cask me nothing; for if I dared tell\r\nyou what I have seen, certainly no good would befall me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have, then, seen something?\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, in\r\nthe name of heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, throwing him a pistole, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me\r\nwhat you have seen, and I will pledge you the word of a gentleman that\r\nnot one of your words shall escape from my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the\r\nyoung man that he made him a sign to listen, and repeated in a low\r\nvoice: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was scarcely nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock when I heard a noise in the\r\nstreet, and was wondering what it could be, when on coming to my door,\r\nI found that somebody was endeavoring to open it. As I am very poor and\r\nam not afraid of being robbed, I went and opened the gate and saw three\r\nmen at a few paces from it. In the shadow was a carriage with two\r\nhorses, and some saddlehorses. These horses evidently belonged to the\r\nthree men, who were dressed as cavaliers. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, my worthy gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncried I, \xe2\x80\x98what do you want?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You must have a ladder?\xe2\x80\x99 said he who\r\nappeared to be the leader of the party. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, monsieur, the one with\r\nwhich I gather my fruit.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Lend it to us, and go into your house again;\r\nthere is a crown for the annoyance we have caused you. Only remember\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94if you speak a word of what you may see or what you may hear (for\r\nyou will look and you will listen, I am quite sure, however we may\r\nthreaten you), you are lost.\xe2\x80\x99 At these words he threw me a crown, which\r\nI picked up, and he took the ladder. After shutting the gate behind\r\nthem, I pretended to return to the house, but I immediately went out a\r\nback door, and stealing along in the shade of the hedge, I gained\r\nyonder clump of elder, from which I could hear and see everything. The\r\nthree men brought the carriage up quietly, and took out of it a little\r\nman, stout, short, elderly, and commonly dressed in clothes of a dark\r\ncolor, who ascended the ladder very carefully, looked suspiciously in\r\nat the window of the pavilion, came down as quietly as he had gone up,\r\nand whispered, \xe2\x80\x98It is she!\xe2\x80\x99 Immediately, he who had spoken to me\r\napproached the door of the pavilion, opened it with a key he had in his\r\nhand, closed the door and disappeared, while at the same time the other\r\ntwo men ascended the ladder. The little old man remained at the coach\r\ndoor; the coachman took care of his horses, the lackey held the\r\nsaddlehorses. All at once great cries resounded in the pavilion, and a\r\nwoman came to the window, and opened it, as if to throw herself out of\r\nit; but as soon as she perceived the other two men, she fell back and\r\nthey went into the chamber. Then I saw no more; but I heard the noise\r\nof breaking furniture. The woman screamed, and cried for help; but her\r\ncries were soon stifled. Two of the men appeared, bearing the woman in\r\ntheir arms, and carried her to the carriage, into which the little old\r\nman got after her. The leader closed the window, came out an instant\r\nafter by the door, and satisfied himself that the woman was in the\r\ncarriage. His two companions were already on horseback. He sprang into\r\nhis saddle; the lackey took his place by the coachman; the carriage\r\nwent off at a quick pace, escorted by the three horsemen, and all was\r\nover. From that moment I have neither seen nor heard anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, entirely overcome by this terrible story, remained\r\nmotionless and mute, while all the demons of anger and jealousy were\r\nhowling in his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my good gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the old man, upon whom this mute\r\ndespair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would\r\nhave done, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not take on so; they did not kill her, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ncomfort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you guess,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cwho was the man who headed this\r\ninfernal expedition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut as you spoke to him you must have seen him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a description you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA tall, dark man, with black mustaches, dark eyes, and the air of a\r\ngentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cagain he, forever he! He is my\r\ndemon, apparently. And the other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe short one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he was not a gentleman, I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for it; besides, he did not\r\nwear a sword, and the others treated him with small consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome lackey,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor woman, poor woman, what have\r\nthey done with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have promised to be secret, my good monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I renew my promise. Be easy, I am a gentleman. A gentleman has but\r\nhis word, and I have given you mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a heavy heart, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan again bent his way toward the ferry.\r\nSometimes he hoped it could not be Mme. Bonacieux, and that he should\r\nfind her next day at the Louvre; sometimes he feared she had had an\r\nintrigue with another, who, in a jealous fit, had surprised her and\r\ncarried her off. His mind was torn by doubt, grief, and despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if I had my three friends here,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have, at\r\nleast, some hopes of finding her; but who knows what has become of\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was past midnight; the next thing was to find Planchet. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nwent successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light, but\r\ncould not find Planchet in any of them.\r\n\r\nAt the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather dubious.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had appointed six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning for his lackey, and\r\nwherever he might be, he was right.\r\n\r\nBesides, it came into the young man\xe2\x80\x99s mind that by remaining in the\r\nenvirons of the spot on which this sad event had passed, he would,\r\nperhaps, have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair. At the\r\nsixth cabaret, then, as we said, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan stopped, asked for a bottle\r\nof wine of the best quality, and placing himself in the darkest corner\r\nof the room, determined thus to wait till daylight; but this time again\r\nhis hopes were disappointed, and although he listened with all his\r\nears, he heard nothing, amid the oaths, coarse jokes, and abuse which\r\npassed between the laborers, servants, and carters who comprised the\r\nhonorable society of which he formed a part, which could put him upon\r\nthe least track of her who had been stolen from him. He was compelled,\r\nthen, after having swallowed the contents of his bottle, to pass the\r\ntime as well as to evade suspicion, to fall into the easiest position\r\nin his corner and to sleep, whether well or ill. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, be it\r\nremembered, was only twenty years old, and at that age sleep has its\r\nimprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon, even with the\r\nsaddest hearts.\r\n\r\nToward six o\xe2\x80\x99clock D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling\r\nwhich generally accompanies the break of day after a bad night. He was\r\nnot long in making his toilet. He examined himself to see if advantage\r\nhad been taken of his sleep, and having found his diamond ring on his\r\nfinger, his purse in his pocket, and his pistols in his belt, he rose,\r\npaid for his bottle, and went out to try if he could have any better\r\nluck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before.\r\nThe first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest\r\nPlanchet, who, with the two horses in hand, awaited him at the door of\r\na little blind cabaret, before which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had passed without even\r\na suspicion of its existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXV.\r\nPORTHOS\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead of returning directly home, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan alighted at the door of\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, and ran quickly up the stairs. This time he had decided\r\nto relate all that had passed. M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville would doubtless give him\r\ngood advice as to the whole affair. Besides, as M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville saw the\r\nqueen almost daily, he might be able to draw from her Majesty some\r\nintelligence of the poor young woman, whom they were doubtless making\r\npay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress.\r\n\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville listened to the young man\xe2\x80\x99s account with a seriousness\r\nwhich proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a\r\nlove affair. When D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had finished, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cHum! All this\r\nsavors of his Eminence, a league off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, absolutely nothing, at present, but quitting Paris, as I told\r\nyou, as soon as possible. I will see the queen; I will relate to her\r\nthe details of the disappearance of this poor woman, of which she is no\r\ndoubt ignorant. These details will guide her on her part, and on your\r\nreturn, I shall perhaps have some good news to tell you. Rely on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan knew that, although a Gascon, M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville was not in the\r\nhabit of making promises, and that when by chance he did promise, he\r\nmore than kept his word. He bowed to him, then, full of gratitude for\r\nthe past and for the future; and the worthy captain, who on his side\r\nfelt a lively interest in this young man, so brave and so resolute,\r\npressed his hand kindly, wishing him a pleasant journey.\r\n\r\nDetermined to put the advice of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville in practice instantly,\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan directed his course toward the Rue des Fossoyeurs, in order\r\nto superintend the packing of his valise. On approaching the house, he\r\nperceived M. Bonacieux in morning costume, standing at his threshold.\r\nAll that the prudent Planchet had said to him the preceding evening\r\nabout the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who looked at him with more attention than he had done\r\nbefore. In fact, in addition to that yellow, sickly paleness which\r\nindicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood, and which might,\r\nbesides, be accidental, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan remarked something perfidiously\r\nsignificant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance. A\r\nrogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does; a\r\nhypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good faith. All falsehood\r\nis a mask; and however well made the mask may be, with a little\r\nattention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true\r\nface.\r\n\r\nIt appeared, then, to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan that M. Bonacieux wore a mask, and\r\nlikewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look upon. In\r\nconsequence of this feeling of repugnance, he was about to pass without\r\nspeaking to him, but, as he had done the day before, M. Bonacieux\r\naccosted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe appear to pass rather gay nights! Seven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning! _Peste!_ You seem to reverse ordinary customs,\r\nand come home at the hour when other people are going out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one can reproach you for anything of the kind, Monsieur Bonacieux,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the young man; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a model for regular people. It is true\r\nthat when a man possesses a young and pretty wife, he has no need to\r\nseek happiness elsewhere. Happiness comes to meet him, does it not,\r\nMonsieur Bonacieux?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBonacieux became as pale as death, and grinned a ghastly smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a jocular companion! But where the\r\ndevil were you gladding last night, my young master? It does not appear\r\nto be very clean in the crossroads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan glanced down at his boots, all covered with mud; but that\r\nsame glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer, and it\r\nmight have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap. Both\r\nwere stained with splashes of mud of the same appearance.\r\n\r\nThen a sudden idea crossed the mind of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. That little stout\r\nman, short and elderly, that sort of lackey, dressed in dark clothes,\r\ntreated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the\r\nescort, was Bonacieux himself. The husband had presided at the\r\nabduction of his wife.\r\n\r\nA terrible inclination seized D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to grasp the mercer by the\r\nthroat and strangle him; but, as we have said, he was a very prudent\r\nyouth, and he restrained himself. However, the revolution which\r\nappeared upon his countenance was so visible that Bonacieux was\r\nterrified at it, and he endeavored to draw back a step or two; but as\r\nhe was standing before the half of the door which was shut, the\r\nobstacle compelled him to keep his place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but you are joking, my worthy man!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cIt appears\r\nto me that if my boots need a sponge, your stockings and shoes stand in\r\nequal need of a brush. May you not have been philandering a little\r\nalso, Monsieur Bonacieux? Oh, the devil! That\xe2\x80\x99s unpardonable in a man\r\nof your age, and who besides, has such a pretty wife as yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lord! no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cbut yesterday I went to St. Mand\xc3\xa9 to\r\nmake some inquiries after a servant, as I cannot possibly do without\r\none; and the roads were so bad that I brought back all this mud, which\r\nI have not yet had time to remove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe place named by Bonacieux as that which had been the object of his\r\njourney was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had\r\nconceived. Bonacieux had named Mand\xc3\xa9 because Mand\xc3\xa9 was in an exactly\r\nopposite direction from St. Cloud. This probability afforded him his\r\nfirst consolation. If Bonacieux knew where his wife was, one might, by\r\nextreme means, force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret\r\nescape. The question, then, was how to change this probability into a\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t stand upon ceremony,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cbut nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep. I\r\nam parched with thirst. Allow me to take a glass of water in your\r\napartment; you know that is never refused among neighbors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for the permission of his host, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan went quickly\r\ninto the house, and cast a rapid glance at the bed. It had not been\r\nused. Bonacieux had not been abed. He had only been back an hour or\r\ntwo; he had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement, or\r\nelse at least to the first relay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, Monsieur Bonacieux,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, emptying his glass,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat is all I wanted of you. I will now go up into my apartment. I\r\nwill make Planchet brush my boots; and when he has done, I will, if you\r\nlike, send him to you to brush your shoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell, and\r\nasking himself if he had not been a little inconsiderate.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the stairs he found Planchet in a great fright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Planchet, as soon as he perceived his master,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chere is more trouble. I thought you would never come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now, Planchet?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I give you a hundred, I give you a thousand times to guess,\r\nmonsieur, the visit I received in your absence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout half an hour ago, while you were at Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has been here? Come, speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de Cavois.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de Cavois?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe captain of the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s Guards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he come to arrest me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt that he did, monsieur, for all his wheedling manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas he so sweet, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, he was all honey, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came, he said, on the part of his Eminence, who wished you well,\r\nand to beg you to follow him to the Palais-Royal*.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* It was called the Palais-Cardinal before Richelieu gave it to the\r\nKing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you answer him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat the thing was impossible, seeing that you were not at home, as he\r\ncould see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what did he say then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you must not fail to call upon him in the course of the day; and\r\nthen he added in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x98Tell your master that his Eminence is\r\nvery well disposed toward him, and that his fortune perhaps depends\r\nupon this interview.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe snare is rather _maladroit_ for the cardinal,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young\r\nman, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I saw the snare, and I answered you would be quite in despair on\r\nyour return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Where has he gone?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Monsieur de Cavois.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98To Troyes, in Champagne,\xe2\x80\x99 I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And when did he set out?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yesterday evening.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlanchet, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are really a\r\nprecious fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will understand, monsieur, I thought there would be still time, if\r\nyou wish, to see Monsieur de Cavois to contradict me by saying you were\r\nnot yet gone. The falsehood would then lie at my door, and as I am not\r\na gentleman, I may be allowed to lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe of good heart, Planchet, you shall preserve your reputation as a\r\nveracious man. In a quarter of an hour we set off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the advice I was about to give Monsieur; and where are we\r\ngoing, may I ask, without being too curious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cPardieu!_ In the opposite direction to that which you said I was\r\ngone. Besides, are you not as anxious to learn news of Grimaud,\r\nMousqueton, and Bazin as I am to know what has become of Athos,\r\nPorthos, and Aramis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will go as soon as you please.\r\nIndeed, I think provincial air will suit us much better just now than\r\nthe air of Paris. So then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo then, pack up our luggage, Planchet, and let us be off. On my part,\r\nI will go out with my hands in my pockets, that nothing may be\r\nsuspected. You may join me at the H\xc3\xb4tel des Gardes. By the way,\r\nPlanchet, I think you are right with respect to our host, and that he\r\nis decidedly a frightfully low wretch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monsieur, you may take my word when I tell you anything. I am a\r\nphysiognomist, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan went out first, as had been agreed upon. Then, in order that\r\nhe might have nothing to reproach himself with, he directed his steps,\r\nfor the last time, toward the residences of his three friends. No news\r\nhad been received of them; only a letter, all perfumed and of an\r\nelegant writing in small characters, had come for Aramis. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\ntook charge of it. Ten minutes afterward Planchet joined him at the\r\nstables of the H\xc3\xb4tel des Gardes. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in order that there might\r\nbe no time lost, had saddled his horse himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s well,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Planchet, when the latter added the\r\nportmanteau to the equipment. \xe2\x80\x9cNow saddle the other three horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think, then, monsieur, that we shall travel faster with two\r\nhorses apiece?\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet, with his shrewd air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Monsieur Jester,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut with our four horses we\r\nmay bring back our three friends, if we should have the good fortune to\r\nfind them living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is a great chance,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Planchet, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we must not despair\r\nof the mercy of God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, getting into his saddle.\r\n\r\nAs they went from the H\xc3\xb4tel des Gardes, they separated, leaving the\r\nstreet at opposite ends, one having to quit Paris by the Barri\xc3\xa8re de la\r\nVillette and the other by the Barri\xc3\xa8re Montmartre, to meet again beyond\r\nSt. Denis\xe2\x80\x94a strategic maneuver which, having been executed with equal\r\npunctuality, was crowned with the most fortunate results. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nand Planchet entered Pierrefitte together.\r\n\r\nPlanchet was more courageous, it must be admitted, by day than by\r\nnight. His natural prudence, however, never forsook him for a single\r\ninstant. He had forgotten not one of the incidents of the first\r\njourney, and he looked upon everybody he met on the road as an enemy.\r\nIt followed that his hat was forever in his hand, which procured him\r\nsome severe reprimands from D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who feared that his excess of\r\npoliteness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, whether the passengers were really touched by the\r\nurbanity of Planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s road, our two travelers arrived at Chantilly without any\r\naccident, and alighted at the tavern of Great St. Martin, the same at\r\nwhich they had stopped on their first journey.\r\n\r\nThe host, on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra\r\nhorses, advanced respectfully to the door. Now, as they had already\r\ntraveled eleven leagues, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan thought it time to stop, whether\r\nPorthos were or were not in the inn. Perhaps it would not be prudent to\r\nask at once what had become of the Musketeer. The result of these\r\nreflections was that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, without asking information of any\r\nkind, alighted, commended the horses to the care of his lackey, entered\r\na small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone, and\r\ndesired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a\r\nbreakfast as possible\xe2\x80\x94a desire which further corroborated the high\r\nopinion the innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was therefore served with miraculous celerity. The regiment\r\nof the Guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom;\r\nand D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, followed by a lackey, and traveling with four\r\nmagnificent horses, despite the simplicity of his uniform, could not\r\nfail to make a sensation. The host desired himself to serve him; which\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan perceiving, ordered two glasses to be brought, and commenced\r\nthe following conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith, my good host,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, filling the two glasses, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nasked for a bottle of your best wine, and if you have deceived me, you\r\nwill be punished in what you have sinned; for seeing that I hate\r\ndrinking by myself, you shall drink with me. Take your glass, then, and\r\nlet us drink. But what shall we drink to, so as to avoid wounding any\r\nsusceptibility? Let us drink to the prosperity of your establishment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Lordship does me much honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the host, \xe2\x80\x9cand I thank you\r\nsincerely for your kind wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is more selfishness in my\r\ntoast than perhaps you may think\xe2\x80\x94for it is only in prosperous\r\nestablishments that one is well received. In h\xc3\xb4tels that do not\r\nflourish, everything is in confusion, and the traveler is a victim to\r\nthe embarrassments of his host. Now, I travel a great deal,\r\nparticularly on this road, and I wish to see all innkeepers making a\r\nfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the host, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this is not the first time I\r\nhave had the honor of seeing Monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah, I have passed perhaps ten times through Chantilly, and out of the\r\nten times I have stopped three or four times at your house at least.\r\nWhy I was here only ten or twelve days ago. I was conducting some\r\nfriends, Musketeers, one of whom, by the by, had a dispute with a\r\nstranger\xe2\x80\x94a man who sought a quarrel with him, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the host; \xe2\x80\x9cI remember it perfectly. It is not\r\nMonsieur Porthos that your Lordship means?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is my companion\xe2\x80\x99s name. My God, my dear host, tell me if\r\nanything has happened to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Lordship must have observed that he could not continue his\r\njourney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to be sure, he promised to rejoin us, and we have seen nothing of\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has done us the honor to remain here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, he had done you the honor to remain here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur, in this house; and we are even a little uneasy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn what account?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf certain expenses he has contracted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but whatever expenses he may have incurred, I am sure he is in a\r\ncondition to pay them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monsieur, you infuse genuine balm into my blood. We have made\r\nconsiderable advances; and this very morning the surgeon declared that\r\nif Monsieur Porthos did not pay him, he should look to me, as it was I\r\nwho had sent for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPorthos is wounded, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! You cannot tell me? Surely you ought to be able to tell me\r\nbetter than any other person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but in our situation we must not say all we know\xe2\x80\x94particularly as\r\nwe have been warned that our ears should answer for our tongues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, can I see Porthos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, monsieur. Take the stairs on your right; go up the first\r\nflight and knock at Number One. Only warn him that it is you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, monsieur, some mischief might happen to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what kind, in the name of wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Porthos may imagine you belong to the house, and in a fit of\r\npassion might run his sword through you or blow out your brains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done to him, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have asked him for money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil! Ah, I can understand that. It is a demand that Porthos\r\ntakes very ill when he is not in funds; but I know he must be so at\r\npresent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thought so, too, monsieur. As our house is carried on very\r\nregularly, and we make out our bills every week, at the end of eight\r\ndays we presented our account; but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky\r\nmoment, for at the first word on the subject, he sent us to all the\r\ndevils. It is true he had been playing the day before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlaying the day before! And with whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, who can say, monsieur? With some gentleman who was traveling\r\nthis way, to whom he proposed a game of _lansquenet_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, then, and the foolish fellow lost all he had?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven to his horse, monsieur; for when the gentleman was about to set\r\nout, we perceived that his lackey was saddling Monsieur Porthos\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhorse, as well as his master\xe2\x80\x99s. When we observed this to him, he told\r\nus all to trouble ourselves about our own business, as this horse\r\nbelonged to him. We also informed Monsieur Porthos of what was going\r\non; but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s word, and\r\nthat as he had said the horse was his, it must be so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Porthos all over,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the host, \xe2\x80\x9cI replied that as from the moment we\r\nseemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to\r\npayment, I hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the\r\nfavor of his custom to my brother host of the Golden Eagle; but\r\nMonsieur Porthos replied that, my house being the best, he should\r\nremain where he was. This reply was too flattering to allow me to\r\ninsist on his departure. I confined myself then to begging him to give\r\nup his chamber, which is the handsomest in the h\xc3\xb4tel, and to be\r\nsatisfied with a pretty little room on the third floor; but to this\r\nMonsieur Porthos replied that as he every moment expected his mistress,\r\nwho was one of the greatest ladies in the court, I might easily\r\ncomprehend that the chamber he did me the honor to occupy in my house\r\nwas itself very mean for the visit of such a personage. Nevertheless,\r\nwhile acknowledging the truth of what he said, I thought proper to\r\ninsist; but without even giving himself the trouble to enter into any\r\ndiscussion with me, he took one of his pistols, laid it on his table,\r\nday and night, and said that at the first word that should be spoken to\r\nhim about removing, either within the house or out of it, he would blow\r\nout the brains of the person who should be so imprudent as to meddle\r\nwith a matter which only concerned himself. Since that time, monsieur,\r\nnobody entered his chamber but his servant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Mousqueton is here, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, monsieur. Five days after your departure, he came back, and\r\nin a very bad condition, too. It appears that he had met with\r\ndisagreeableness, likewise, on his journey. Unfortunately, he is more\r\nnimble than his master; so that for the sake of his master, he puts us\r\nall under his feet, and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for,\r\nhe takes all he wants without asking at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI have always observed a great degree\r\nof intelligence and devotedness in Mousqueton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is possible, monsieur; but suppose I should happen to be brought\r\nin contact, even four times a year, with such intelligence and\r\ndevotedness\xe2\x80\x94why, I should be a ruined man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, for Porthos will pay you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHum!\xe2\x80\x9d said the host, in a doubtful tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced\r\nfor such a paltry sum as he owes you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I durst say what I believe on that head\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you believe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought rather to say, what I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd even what I am sure of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd of what are you so sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would say that I know this great lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do you know her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, monsieur, if I could believe I might trust in your discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak! By the word of a gentleman, you shall have no cause to repent\r\nof your confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, monsieur, you understand that uneasiness makes us do many\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing which was not right in the character of a creditor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Porthos gave us a note for his duchess, ordering us to put it\r\nin the post. This was before his servant came. As he could not leave\r\nhis chamber, it was necessary to charge us with this commission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of putting the letter in the post, which is never safe, I took\r\nadvantage of the journey of one of my lads to Paris, and ordered him to\r\nconvey the letter to this duchess himself. This was fulfilling the\r\nintentions of Monsieur Porthos, who had desired us to be so careful of\r\nthis letter, was it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearly so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, monsieur, do you know who this great lady is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I have heard Porthos speak of her, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know who this pretended duchess is?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI repeat to you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she is the old wife of a procurator* of the Ch\xc3\xa2telet, monsieur,\r\nnamed Madame Coquenard, who, although she is at least fifty, still\r\ngives herself jealous airs. It struck me as very odd that a princess\r\nshould live in the Rue aux Ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* Attorney\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how do you know all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she flew into a great passion on receiving the letter, saying\r\nthat Monsieur Porthos was a weathercock, and that she was sure it was\r\nfor some woman he had received this wound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he been wounded, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, good Lord! What have I said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said that Porthos had received a sword cut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZounds, monsieur! Because he had boasted that he would perforate the\r\nstranger with whom you left him in dispute; whereas the stranger, on\r\nthe contrary, in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his\r\nback. As Monsieur Porthos is a very boastful man, he insists that\r\nnobody shall know he has received this wound except the duchess, whom\r\nhe endeavored to interest by an account of his adventure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a wound that confines him to his bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, and a master stroke, too, I assure you. Your friend\xe2\x80\x99s soul must\r\nstick tight to his body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you there, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, I followed them from curiosity, so that I saw the combat\r\nwithout the combatants seeing me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what took place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! The affair was not long, I assure you. They placed themselves on\r\nguard; the stranger made a feint and a lunge, and that so rapidly that\r\nwhen Monsieur Porthos came to the _parade_, he had already three inches\r\nof steel in his breast. He immediately fell backward. The stranger\r\nplaced the point of his sword at his throat; and Monsieur Porthos,\r\nfinding himself at the mercy of his adversary, acknowledged himself\r\nconquered. Upon which the stranger asked his name, and learning that it\r\nwas Porthos, and not D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, he assisted him to rise, brought him\r\nback to the h\xc3\xb4tel, mounted his horse, and disappeared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it was with Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan this stranger meant to quarrel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you know what has become of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I never saw him until that moment, and have not seen him since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; I know all that I wish to know. Porthos\xe2\x80\x99s chamber is, you\r\nsay, on the first story, Number One?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur, the handsomest in the inn\xe2\x80\x94a chamber that I could have\r\nlet ten times over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah! Be satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cPorthos will pay you\r\nwith the money of the Duchess Coquenard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, monsieur, procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife or duchess, if she will but loosen her\r\npursestrings, it will be all the same; but she positively answered that\r\nshe was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of Monsieur Porthos,\r\nand that she would not send him a denier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you convey this answer to your guest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe took good care not to do that; he would have found in what fashion\r\nwe had executed his commission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that he still expects his money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lord, yes, monsieur! Yesterday he wrote again; but it was his\r\nservant who this time put the letter in the post.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you say the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife is old and ugly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifty at least, monsieur, and not at all handsome, according to\r\nPathaud\xe2\x80\x99s account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, you may be quite at ease; she will soon be softened.\r\nBesides, Porthos cannot owe you much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, not much! Twenty good pistoles, already, without reckoning the\r\ndoctor. He denies himself nothing; it may easily be seen he has been\r\naccustomed to live well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind; if his mistress abandons him, he will find friends, I will\r\nanswer for it. So, my dear host, be not uneasy, and continue to take\r\nall the care of him that his situation requires.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife, and not to say a word of the wound?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s agreed; you have my word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he would kill me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid; he is not so much of a devil as he appears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaying these words, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan went upstairs, leaving his host a little\r\nbetter satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be\r\nvery much interested\xe2\x80\x94his debt and his life.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the stairs, upon the most conspicuous door of the\r\ncorridor, was traced in black ink a gigantic number \xe2\x80\x9c1.\xe2\x80\x9d D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nknocked, and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside, he\r\nentered the chamber.\r\n\r\nPorthos was in bed, and was playing a game at _lansquenet_ with\r\nMousqueton, to keep his hand in; while a spit loaded with partridges\r\nwas turning before the fire, and on each side of a large chimneypiece,\r\nover two chafing dishes, were boiling two stewpans, from which exhaled\r\na double odor of rabbit and fish stews, rejoicing to the smell. In\r\naddition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble\r\nof a commode were covered with empty bottles.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of his friend, Porthos uttered a loud cry of joy; and\r\nMousqueton, rising respectfully, yielded his place to him, and went to\r\ngive an eye to the two stewpans, of which he appeared to have the\r\nparticular inspection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, _pardieu!_ Is that you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nright welcome. Excuse my not coming to meet you; but,\xe2\x80\x9d added he,\r\nlooking at D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan with a certain degree of uneasiness, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know\r\nwhat has happened to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the host told you nothing, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked after you, and came up as soon as I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos seemed to breathe more freely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what has happened to you, my dear Porthos?\xe2\x80\x9d continued D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, on making a thrust at my adversary, whom I had already hit three\r\ntimes, and whom I meant to finish with the fourth, I put my foot on a\r\nstone, slipped, and strained my knee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonor! Luckily for the rascal, for I should have left him dead on the\r\nspot, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what has became of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; he had enough, and set off without waiting for the\r\nrest. But you, my dear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, what has happened to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that this strain of the knee,\xe2\x80\x9d continued D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cmy dear\r\nPorthos, keeps you in bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. I shall be about again in a few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you not have yourself conveyed to Paris? You must be cruelly\r\nbored here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was my intention; but, my dear friend, I have one thing to\r\nconfess to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is that as I was cruelly bored, as you say, and as I had the\r\nseventy-five pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me, in\r\norder to amuse myself I invited a gentleman who was traveling this way\r\nto walk up, and proposed a cast of dice. He accepted my challenge, and,\r\nmy faith, my seventy-five pistoles passed from my pocket to his,\r\nwithout reckoning my horse, which he won into the bargain. But you, my\r\ndear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you expect, my dear Porthos; a man is not privileged in all\r\nways,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know the proverb \xe2\x80\x98Unlucky at play, lucky\r\nin love.\xe2\x80\x99 You are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its\r\nrevenge. What consequence can the reverses of fortune be to you? Have\r\nyou not, happy rogue that you are\xe2\x80\x94have you not your duchess, who cannot\r\nfail to come to your aid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, my dear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with what ill luck I play,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nPorthos, with the most careless air in the world. \xe2\x80\x9cI wrote to her to\r\nsend me fifty louis or so, of which I stood absolutely in need on\r\naccount of my accident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she must be at her country seat, for she has not answered me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; so I yesterday addressed another epistle to her, still more\r\npressing than the first. But you are here, my dear fellow, let us speak\r\nof you. I confess I began to be very uneasy on your account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your host behaves very well toward you, as it appears, my dear\r\nPorthos,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, directing the sick man\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the\r\nfull stewpans and the empty bottles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly three or four days ago the impertinent\r\njackanapes gave me his bill, and I was forced to turn both him and his\r\nbill out of the door; so that I am here something in the fashion of a\r\nconqueror, holding my position, as it were, my conquest. So you see,\r\nbeing in constant fear of being forced from that position, I am armed\r\nto the teeth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cit appears to me that from time\r\nto time you must make _sorties_.\xe2\x80\x9d And he again pointed to the bottles\r\nand the stewpans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I, unfortunately!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cThis miserable strain confines\r\nme to my bed; but Mousqueton forages, and brings in provisions. Friend\r\nMousqueton, you see that we have a reinforcement, and we must have an\r\nincrease of supplies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMousqueton,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must render me a service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must give your recipe to Planchet. I may be besieged in my turn,\r\nand I shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same\r\nadvantages with which you gratify your master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, monsieur! There is nothing more easy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mousqueton, with a\r\nmodest air. \xe2\x80\x9cOne only needs to be sharp, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. I was brought up\r\nin the country, and my father in his leisure time was something of a\r\npoacher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did he do the rest of his time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, he carried on a trade which I have always thought\r\nsatisfactory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs it was a time of war between the Catholics and the Huguenots, and\r\nas he saw the Catholics exterminate the Huguenots and the Huguenots\r\nexterminate the Catholics\xe2\x80\x94all in the name of religion\xe2\x80\x94he adopted a\r\nmixed belief which permitted him to be sometimes Catholic, sometimes a\r\nHuguenot. Now, he was accustomed to walk with his fowling piece on his\r\nshoulder, behind the hedges which border the roads, and when he saw a\r\nCatholic coming alone, the Protestant religion immediately prevailed in\r\nhis mind. He lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler; then,\r\nwhen he was within ten paces of him, he commenced a conversation which\r\nalmost always ended by the traveler\xe2\x80\x99s abandoning his purse to save his\r\nlife. It goes without saying that when he saw a Huguenot coming, he\r\nfelt himself filled with such ardent Catholic zeal that he could not\r\nunderstand how, a quarter of an hour before, he had been able to have\r\nany doubts upon the superiority of our holy religion. For my part,\r\nmonsieur, I am Catholic\xe2\x80\x94my father, faithful to his principles, having\r\nmade my elder brother a Huguenot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what was the end of this worthy man?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of the most unfortunate kind, monsieur. One day he was surprised\r\nin a lonely road between a Huguenot and a Catholic, with both of whom\r\nhe had before had business, and who both knew him again; so they united\r\nagainst him and hanged him on a tree. Then they came and boasted of\r\ntheir fine exploit in the cabaret of the next village, where my brother\r\nand I were drinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you do?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe let them tell their story out,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mousqueton. \xe2\x80\x9cThen, as in\r\nleaving the cabaret they took different directions, my brother went and\r\nhid himself on the road of the Catholic, and I on that of the Huguenot.\r\nTwo hours after, all was over; we had done the business of both,\r\nadmiring the foresight of our poor father, who had taken the precaution\r\nto bring each of us up in a different religion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must allow, as you say, your father was a very intelligent\r\nfellow. And you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a\r\npoacher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur, and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a\r\nline. The consequence is that when I saw our laborers, which did not at\r\nall suit two such delicate stomachs as ours, I had recourse to a little\r\nof my old trade. While walking near the wood of Monsieur le Prince, I\r\nlaid a few snares in the runs; and while reclining on the banks of his\r\nHighness\xe2\x80\x99s pieces of water, I slipped a few lines into his fish ponds.\r\nSo that now, thanks be to God, we do not want, as Monsieur can testify,\r\nfor partridges, rabbits, carp or eels\xe2\x80\x94all light, wholesome food,\r\nsuitable for the sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the wine,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cwho furnishes the wine? Your host?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, yes and no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow yes and no?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe furnishes it, it is true, but he does not know that he has that\r\nhonor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain yourself, Mousqueton; your conversation is full of instructive\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is it, monsieur. It has so chanced that I met with a Spaniard in\r\nmy peregrinations who had seen many countries, and among them the New\r\nWorld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat connection can the New World have with the bottles which are on\r\nthe commode and the wardrobe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatience, monsieur, everything will come in its turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis Spaniard had in his service a lackey who had accompanied him in\r\nhis voyage to Mexico. This lackey was my compatriot; and we became the\r\nmore intimate from there being many resemblances of character between\r\nus. We loved sporting of all kinds better than anything; so that he\r\nrelated to me how in the plains of the Pampas the natives hunt the\r\ntiger and the wild bull with simple running nooses which they throw to\r\na distance of twenty or thirty paces the end of a cord with such\r\nnicety; but in face of the proof I was obliged to acknowledge the truth\r\nof the recital. My friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty\r\npaces, and at each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running\r\nnoose. I practiced this exercise, and as nature has endowed me with\r\nsome faculties, at this day I can throw the lasso with any man in the\r\nworld. Well, do you understand, monsieur? Our host has a well-furnished\r\ncellar the key of which never leaves him; only this cellar has a\r\nventilating hole. Now through this ventilating hole I throw my lasso,\r\nand as I now know in which part of the cellar is the best wine, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy point for sport. You see, monsieur, what the New World has to do\r\nwith the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe. Now, will\r\nyou taste our wine, and without prejudice say what you think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, my friend, thank you; unfortunately, I have just\r\nbreakfasted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9carrange the table, Mousqueton, and while we\r\nbreakfast, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during\r\nthe ten days since he left us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillingly,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\nWhile Porthos and Mousqueton were breakfasting, with the appetites of\r\nconvalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in\r\nmisfortune, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan related how Aramis, being wounded, was obliged\r\nto stop at Cr\xc3\xa8vec\xc5\x93ur, how he had left Athos fighting at Amiens with\r\nfour men who accused him of being a coiner, and how he, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, had\r\nbeen forced to run the Comtes de Wardes through the body in order to\r\nreach England.\r\n\r\nBut there the confidence of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan stopped. He only added that on\r\nhis return from Great Britain he had brought back four magnificent\r\nhorses\xe2\x80\x94one for himself, and one for each of his companions; then he\r\ninformed Porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in\r\nthe stable of the tavern.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Planchet entered, to inform his master that the horses\r\nwere sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at\r\nClermont.\r\n\r\nAs D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was tolerably reassured with regard to Porthos, and as he\r\nwas anxious to obtain news of his two other friends, he held out his\r\nhand to the wounded man, and told him he was about to resume his route\r\nin order to continue his researches. For the rest, as he reckoned upon\r\nreturning by the same route in seven or eight days, if Porthos were\r\nstill at the Great St. Martin, he would call for him on his way.\r\n\r\nPorthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit him\r\nto depart yet awhile. Besides, it was necessary he should stay at\r\nChantilly to wait for the answer from his duchess.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable; and having\r\nagain recommended Porthos to the care of Mousqueton, and paid his bill\r\nto the host, he resumed his route with Planchet, already relieved of\r\none of his led horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVI.\r\nARAMIS AND HIS THESIS\r\n\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had said nothing to Porthos of his wound or of his\r\nprocurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife. Our B\xc3\xa9arnais was a prudent lad, however young he\r\nmight be. Consequently he had appeared to believe all that the\r\nvainglorious Musketeer had told him, convinced that no friendship will\r\nhold out against a surprised secret. Besides, we feel always a sort of\r\nmental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they\r\nsuppose. In his projects of intrigue for the future, and determined as\r\nhe was to make his three friends the instruments of his fortune,\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was not sorry at getting into his grasp beforehand the\r\ninvisible strings by which he reckoned upon moving them.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as he journeyed along, a profound sadness weighed upon his\r\nheart. He thought of that young and pretty Mme. Bonacieux who was to\r\nhave paid him the price of his devotedness; but let us hasten to say\r\nthat this sadness possessed the young man less from the regret of the\r\nhappiness he had missed, than from the fear he entertained that some\r\nserious misfortune had befallen the poor woman. For himself, he had no\r\ndoubt she was a victim of the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s vengeance; and, as was well\r\nknown, the vengeance of his Eminence was terrible. How he had found\r\ngrace in the eyes of the minister, he did not know; but without doubt\r\nM. de Cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the\r\nGuards had found him at home.\r\n\r\nNothing makes time pass more quickly or more shortens a journey than a\r\nthought which absorbs in itself all the faculties of the organization\r\nof him who thinks. External existence then resembles a sleep of which\r\nthis thought is the dream. By its influence, time has no longer\r\nmeasure, space has no longer distance. We depart from one place, and\r\narrive at another, that is all. Of the interval passed, nothing remains\r\nin the memory but a vague mist in which a thousand confused images of\r\ntrees, mountains, and landscapes are lost. It was as a prey to this\r\nhallucination that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan traveled, at whatever pace his horse\r\npleased, the six or eight leagues that separated Chantilly from\r\nCr\xc3\xa8vec\xc5\x93ur, without his being able to remember on his arrival in the\r\nvillage any of the things he had passed or met with on the road.\r\n\r\nThere only his memory returned to him. He shook his head, perceived the\r\ncabaret at which he had left Aramis, and putting his horse to the trot,\r\nhe shortly pulled up at the door.\r\n\r\nThis time it was not a host but a hostess who received him. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nwas a physiognomist. His eye took in at a glance the plump, cheerful\r\ncountenance of the mistress of the place, and he at once perceived\r\nthere was no occasion for dissembling with her, or of fearing anything\r\nfrom one blessed with such a joyous physiognomy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good dame,\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9ccan you tell me what has become of\r\none of my friends, whom we were obliged to leave here about a dozen\r\ndays ago?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA handsome young man, three- or four-and-twenty years old, mild,\r\namiable, and well made?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is he\xe2\x80\x94wounded in the shoulder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so. Well, monsieur, he is still here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, _pardieu!_ My dear dame,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, springing from his\r\nhorse, and throwing the bridle to Planchet, \xe2\x80\x9cyou restore me to life;\r\nwhere is this dear Aramis? Let me embrace him, I am in a hurry to see\r\nhim again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon, monsieur, but I doubt whether he can see you at this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so? Has he a lady with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJesus! What do you mean by that? Poor lad! No, monsieur, he has not a\r\nlady with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith whom is he, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the curate of Montdidier and the superior of the Jesuits of\r\nAmiens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cis the poor fellow worse, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur, quite the contrary; but after his illness grace touched\r\nhim, and he determined to take orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten that he was only a\r\nMusketeer for a time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur still insists upon seeing him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, monsieur has only to take the right-hand staircase in the\r\ncourtyard, and knock at Number Five on the second floor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated, and found one of\r\nthose exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our\r\nold-fashioned taverns. But there was no getting at the place of sojourn\r\nof the future abb\xc3\xa9; the defiles of the chamber of Aramis were as well\r\nguarded as the gardens of Armida. Bazin was stationed in the corridor,\r\nand barred his passage with the more intrepidity that, after many years\r\nof trial, Bazin found himself near a result of which he had ever been\r\nambitious.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the dream of poor Bazin had always been to serve a churchman;\r\nand he awaited with impatience the moment, always in the future, when\r\nAramis would throw aside the uniform and assume the cassock. The\r\ndaily-renewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long\r\nbe delayed, had alone kept him in the service of a Musketeer\xe2\x80\x94a service\r\nin which, he said, his soul was in constant jeopardy.\r\n\r\nBazin was then at the height of joy. In all probability, this time his\r\nmaster would not retract. The union of physical pain with moral\r\nuneasiness had produced the effect so long desired. Aramis, suffering\r\nat once in body and mind, had at length fixed his eyes and his thoughts\r\nupon religion, and he had considered as a warning from heaven the\r\ndouble accident which had happened to him; that is to say, the sudden\r\ndisappearance of his mistress and the wound in his shoulder.\r\n\r\nIt may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his\r\nmaster nothing could be more disagreeable to Bazin than the arrival of\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, which might cast his master back again into that vortex of\r\nmundane affairs which had so long carried him away. He resolved, then,\r\nto defend the door bravely; and as, betrayed by the mistress of the\r\ninn, he could not say that Aramis was absent, he endeavored to prove to\r\nthe newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his\r\nmaster in his pious conference, which had commenced with the morning\r\nand would not, as Bazin said, terminate before night.\r\n\r\nBut D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of M.\r\nBazin; and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s valet, he simply moved him out of the way with one hand, and\r\nwith the other turned the handle of the door of Number Five. The door\r\nopened, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan went into the chamber.\r\n\r\nAramis, in a black gown, his head enveloped in a sort of round flat\r\ncap, not much unlike a _calotte_, was seated before an oblong table,\r\ncovered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio. At his right\r\nhand was placed the superior of the Jesuits, and on his left the curate\r\nof Montdidier. The curtains were half drawn, and only admitted the\r\nmysterious light calculated for beatific reveries. All the mundane\r\nobjects that generally strike the eye on entering the room of a young\r\nman, particularly when that young man is a Musketeer, had disappeared\r\nas if by enchantment; and for fear, no doubt, that the sight of them\r\nmight bring his master back to ideas of this world, Bazin had laid his\r\nhands upon sword, pistols, plumed hat, and embroideries and laces of\r\nall kinds and sorts. In their stead D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan thought he perceived in\r\nan obscure corner a discipline cord suspended from a nail in the wall.\r\n\r\nAt the noise made by D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan in entering, Aramis lifted up his head,\r\nand beheld his friend; but to the great astonishment of the young man,\r\nthe sight of him did not produce much effect upon the Musketeer, so\r\ncompletely was his mind detached from the things of this world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood day, dear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis; \xe2\x80\x9cbelieve me, I am glad to see\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I delighted to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9calthough I am not yet\r\nsure that it is Aramis I am speaking to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo himself, my friend, to himself! But what makes you doubt it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid I had made a mistake in the chamber, and that I had found\r\nmy way into the apartment of some churchman. Then another error seized\r\nme on seeing you in company with these gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94I was afraid you were\r\ndangerously ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two men in black, who guessed D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, darted at him a\r\nglance which might have been thought threatening; but D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan took\r\nno heed of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI disturb you, perhaps, my dear Aramis,\xe2\x80\x9d continued D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cfor by\r\nwhat I see, I am led to believe that you are confessing to these\r\ngentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis colored imperceptibly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou disturb me? Oh, quite the contrary,\r\ndear friend, I swear; and as a proof of what I say, permit me to\r\ndeclare I am rejoiced to see you safe and sound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, he\xe2\x80\x99ll come round,\xe2\x80\x9d thought D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s not bad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis gentleman, who is my friend, has just escaped from a serious\r\ndanger,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Aramis, with unction, pointing to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan with\r\nhis hand, and addressing the two ecclesiastics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPraise God, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied they, bowing together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not failed to do so, your Reverences,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young man,\r\nreturning their salutation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou arrive in good time, dear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cand by taking\r\npart in our discussion may assist us with your intelligence. Monsieur\r\nthe Principal of Amiens, Monsieur the Curate of Montdidier, and I are\r\narguing certain theological questions in which we have been much\r\ninterested; I shall be delighted to have your opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nyou had better be satisfied, believe me, with the knowledge of these\r\ngentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two men in black bowed in their turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cyour opinion will be very valuable.\r\nThe question is this: Monsieur the Principal thinks that my thesis\r\nought to be dogmatic and didactic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour thesis! Are you then making a thesis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jesuit. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the examination which precedes\r\nordination, a thesis is always a requisite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrdination!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who could not believe what the hostess\r\nand Bazin had successively told him; and he gazed, half stupefied, upon\r\nthe three persons before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Aramis, taking the same graceful position in his easy\r\nchair that he would have assumed in bed, and complacently examining his\r\nhand, which was as white and plump as that of a woman, and which he\r\nheld in the air to cause the blood to descend, \xe2\x80\x9cnow, as you have heard,\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, Monsieur the Principal is desirous that my thesis should be\r\ndogmatic, while I, for my part, would rather it should be ideal. This\r\nis the reason why Monsieur the Principal has proposed to me the\r\nfollowing subject, which has not yet been treated upon, and in which I\r\nperceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98_Utraque manus in\r\nbenedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est_.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, whose erudition we are well acquainted with, evinced no\r\nmore interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had\r\nreceived from the Duke of Buckingham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich means,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Aramis, that he might perfectly understand,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders,\r\nwhen they bestow the benediction.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn admirable subject!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Jesuit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmirable and dogmatic!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the curate, who, about as strong as\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan with respect to Latin, carefully watched the Jesuit in order\r\nto keep step with him, and repeated his words like an echo.\r\n\r\nAs to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of\r\nthe two men in black.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, admirable! _prorsus admirabile!_\xe2\x80\x9d continued Aramis; \xe2\x80\x9cbut which\r\nrequires a profound study of both the Scriptures and the Fathers. Now,\r\nI have confessed to these learned ecclesiastics, and that in all\r\nhumility, that the duties of mounting guard and the service of the king\r\nhave caused me to neglect study a little. I should find myself,\r\ntherefore, more at my ease, _facilius natans_, in a subject of my own\r\nchoice, which would be to these hard theological questions what morals\r\nare to metaphysics in philosophy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan began to be tired, and so did the curate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee what an exordium!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Jesuit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExordium,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the curate, for the sake of saying something.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Quemadmodum inter c\xc5\x93lorum immensitatem_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis cast a glance upon D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to see what effect all this\r\nproduced, and found his friend gaping enough to split his jaws.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us speak French, my father,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the Jesuit; \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan will enjoy our conversation better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cI am fatigued with reading, and all this\r\nLatin confuses me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jesuit, a little put out, while the curate,\r\ngreatly delighted, turned upon D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan a look full of gratitude.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let us see what is to be derived from this gloss. Moses, the\r\nservant of God\xe2\x80\x94he was but a servant, please to understand\xe2\x80\x94Moses blessed\r\nwith the hands; he held out both his arms while the Hebrews beat their\r\nenemies, and then he blessed them with his two hands. Besides, what\r\ndoes the Gospel say? _Imponite manus_, and not _manum_\xe2\x80\x94place the\r\n_hands_, not the _hand_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlace the _hands_,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the curate, with a gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSt. Peter, on the contrary, of whom the Popes are the successors,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued the Jesuit; \xe2\x80\x9c_porrige digitos_\xe2\x80\x94present the fingers. Are you\r\nthere, now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Certes_,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis, in a pleased tone, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the thing is\r\nsubtle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _fingers_,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the Jesuit, \xe2\x80\x9cSt. Peter blessed with the\r\n_fingers_. The Pope, therefore blesses with the fingers. And with how\r\nmany fingers does he bless? With _three_ fingers, to be sure\xe2\x80\x94one for\r\nthe Father, one for the Son, and one for the Holy Ghost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll crossed themselves. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan thought it was proper to follow this\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Pope is the successor of St. Peter, and represents the three\r\ndivine powers; the rest\xe2\x80\x94_ordines inferiores_\xe2\x80\x94of the ecclesiastical\r\nhierarchy bless in the name of the holy archangels and angels. The most\r\nhumble clerks such as our deacons and sacristans, bless with holy water\r\nsprinklers, which resemble an infinite number of blessing fingers.\r\nThere is the subject simplified. _Argumentum omni denudatum ornamento_.\r\nI could make of that subject two volumes the size of this,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nthe Jesuit; and in his enthusiasm he struck a St. Chrysostom in folio,\r\nwhich made the table bend beneath its weight.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan trembled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Certes_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cI do justice to the beauties of this thesis;\r\nbut at the same time I perceive it would be overwhelming for me. I had\r\nchosen this text\xe2\x80\x94tell me, dear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, if it is not to your\r\ntaste\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98_Non inutile est desiderium in oblatione_\xe2\x80\x99; that is, \xe2\x80\x98A little\r\nregret is not unsuitable in an offering to the Lord.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop there!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Jesuit, \xe2\x80\x9cfor that thesis touches closely upon\r\nheresy. There is a proposition almost like it in the _Augustinus_ of\r\nthe heresiarch Jansenius, whose book will sooner or later be burned by\r\nthe hands of the executioner. Take care, my young friend. You are\r\ninclining toward false doctrines, my young friend; you will be lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be lost,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, shaking his head sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou approach that famous point of free will which is a mortal rock.\r\nYou face the insinuations of the Pelagians and the semi-Pelagians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my Reverend\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis, a little amazed by the shower of\r\narguments that poured upon his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will you prove,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Jesuit, without allowing him time\r\nto speak, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we ought to regret the world when we offer ourselves to\r\nGod? Listen to this dilemma: God is God, and the world is the devil. To\r\nregret the world is to regret the devil; that is my conclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is mine also,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Desideras diabolum_, unhappy man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Jesuit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe regrets the devil! Ah, my young friend,\xe2\x80\x9d added the curate,\r\ngroaning, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not regret the devil, I implore you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan felt himself bewildered. It seemed to him as though he were\r\nin a madhouse, and was becoming as mad as those he saw. He was,\r\nhowever, forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the\r\nlanguage they employed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut listen to me, then,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Aramis with politeness mingled with a\r\nlittle impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not say I regret; no, I will never pronounce\r\nthat sentence, which would not be orthodox.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit raised his hands toward heaven, and the curate did the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but pray grant me that it is acting with an ill grace to offer to\r\nthe Lord only that with which we are perfectly disgusted! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nthink so, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit and the curate quite started from their chairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the point of departure; it is a syllogism. The world is not\r\nwanting in attractions. I quit the world; then I make a sacrifice. Now,\r\nthe Scripture says positively, \xe2\x80\x98Make a sacrifice unto the Lord.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said his antagonists.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, pinching his ear to make it red, as he rubbed\r\nhis hands to make them white, \xe2\x80\x9cand then I made a certain _rondeau_ upon\r\nit last year, which I showed to Monsieur Voiture, and that great man\r\npaid me a thousand compliments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA _rondeau!_\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jesuit, disdainfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA _rondeau!_\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, mechanically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRepeat it! Repeat it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cit will make a little\r\nchange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so, for it is religious,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis; \xe2\x80\x9cit is theology in\r\nverse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, with a little look of diffidence, which,\r\nhowever, was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVous qui pleurez un pass\xc3\xa9 plein de charmes,\r\n    Et qui trainez des jours infortun\xc3\xa9s,\r\n    Tous vos malheurs se verront termin\xc3\xa9s,\r\nQuand \xc3\xa0 Dieu seul vous offrirez vos larmes,\r\n        Vous qui pleurez!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou who weep for pleasures fled,\r\n    While dragging on a life of care,\r\n    All your woes will melt in air,\r\nIf to God your tears are shed,\r\n        You who weep!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and the curate appeared pleased. The Jesuit persisted in his\r\nopinion. \xe2\x80\x9cBeware of a profane taste in your theological style. What\r\nsays Augustine on this subject: \xe2\x80\x98_Severus sit clericorum verbo_.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, let the sermon be clear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d hastily interrupted the Jesuit, on seeing that his acolyte was\r\ngoing astray, \xe2\x80\x9cnow your thesis would please the ladies; it would have\r\nthe success of one of Monsieur Patru\xe2\x80\x99s pleadings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Aramis, transported.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Jesuit; \xe2\x80\x9cthe world still speaks within you in\r\na loud voice, _altisim\xc3\xa2 voce_. You follow the world, my young friend,\r\nand I tremble lest grace prove not efficacious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe satisfied, my reverend father, I can answer for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMundane presumption!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know myself, Father; my resolution is irrevocable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you persist in continuing that thesis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel myself called upon to treat that, and no other. I will see\r\nabout the continuation of it, and tomorrow I hope you will be satisfied\r\nwith the corrections I shall have made in consequence of your advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWork slowly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate; \xe2\x80\x9cwe leave you in an excellent tone of\r\nmind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the ground is all sown,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jesuit, \xe2\x80\x9cand we have not to\r\nfear that one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone, another\r\nupon the highway, or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest,\r\n_aves c\xc5\x93li comederunt illam_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlague stifle you and your Latin!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who began to feel\r\nall his patience exhausted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said the curate, \xe2\x80\x9ctill tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill tomorrow, rash youth,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jesuit. \xe2\x80\x9cYou promise to become\r\none of the lights of the Church. Heaven grant that this light prove not\r\na devouring fire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who for an hour past had been gnawing his nails with\r\nimpatience, was beginning to attack the quick.\r\n\r\nThe two men in black rose, bowed to Aramis and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and advanced\r\ntoward the door. Bazin, who had been standing listening to all this\r\ncontroversy with a pious jubilation, sprang toward them, took the\r\nbreviary of the curate and the missal of the Jesuit, and walked\r\nrespectfully before them to clear their way.\r\n\r\nAramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs, and then immediately\r\ncame up again to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, whose senses were still in a state of\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nWhen left alone, the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence.\r\nIt however became necessary for one of them to break it first, and as\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion,\r\nAramis said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see that I am returned to my fundamental ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, efficacious grace has touched you, as that gentleman said just\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time. You have\r\noften heard me speak of them, have you not, my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but I confess I always thought you jested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith such things! Oh, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil! Why, people jest with death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd people are wrong, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; for death is the door which leads to\r\nperdition or to salvation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranted; but if you please, let us not theologize, Aramis. You must\r\nhave had enough for today. As for me, I have almost forgotten the\r\nlittle Latin I have ever known. Then I confess to you that I have eaten\r\nnothing since ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock this morning, and I am devilish hungry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will dine directly, my friend; only you must please to remember\r\nthat this is Friday. Now, on such a day I can neither eat flesh nor see\r\nit eaten. If you can be satisfied with my dinner\xe2\x80\x94it consists of cooked\r\ntetragones and fruits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by tetragones?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean spinach,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis; \xe2\x80\x9cbut on your account I will add some\r\neggs, and that is a serious infraction of the rule\xe2\x80\x94for eggs are meat,\r\nsince they engender chickens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis feast is not very succulent; but never mind, I will put up with\r\nit for the sake of remaining with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am grateful to you for the sacrifice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if your\r\nbody be not greatly benefited by it, be assured your soul will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so, Aramis, you are decidedly going into the Church? What will our\r\ntwo friends say? What will Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville say? They will treat\r\nyou as a deserter, I warn you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not enter the Church; I re-enter it. I deserted the Church for\r\nthe world, for you know that I forced myself when I became a\r\nMusketeer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? I know nothing about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know I quit the seminary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my story, then. Besides, the Scriptures say, \xe2\x80\x98Confess\r\nyourselves to one another,\xe2\x80\x99 and I confess to you, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I give you absolution beforehand. You see I am a good sort of a\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not jest about holy things, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, then, I listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had been at the seminary from nine years old; in three days I should\r\nhave been twenty. I was about to become an abb\xc3\xa9, and all was arranged.\r\nOne evening I went, according to custom, to a house which I frequented\r\nwith much pleasure: when one is young, what can be expected?\xe2\x80\x94one is\r\nweak. An officer who saw me, with a jealous eye, reading the _Lives of\r\nthe Saints_ to the mistress of the house, entered suddenly and without\r\nbeing announced. That evening I had translated an episode of Judith,\r\nand had just communicated my verses to the lady, who gave me all sorts\r\nof compliments, and leaning on my shoulder, was reading them a second\r\ntime with me. Her pose, which I must admit was rather free, wounded\r\nthis officer. He said nothing; but when I went out he followed, and\r\nquickly came up with me. \xe2\x80\x98Monsieur the Abb\xc3\xa9,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98do you like\r\nblows with a cane?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I cannot say, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x99 answered I; \xe2\x80\x98no one has\r\never dared to give me any.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well, listen to me, then, Monsieur the\r\nAbb\xc3\xa9! If you venture again into the house in which I have met you this\r\nevening, I will dare it myself.\xe2\x80\x99 I really think I must have been\r\nfrightened. I became very pale; I felt my legs fail me; I sought for a\r\nreply, but could find none\xe2\x80\x94I was silent. The officer waited for his\r\nreply, and seeing it so long coming, he burst into a laugh, turned upon\r\nhis heel, and re-entered the house. I returned to the seminary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a gentleman born, and my blood is warm, as you may have remarked,\r\nmy dear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. The insult was terrible, and although unknown to\r\nthe rest of the world, I felt it live and fester at the bottom of my\r\nheart. I informed my superiors that I did not feel myself sufficiently\r\nprepared for ordination, and at my request the ceremony was postponed\r\nfor a year. I sought out the best fencing master in Paris, I made an\r\nagreement with him to take a lesson every day, and every day for a year\r\nI took that lesson. Then, on the anniversary of the day on which I had\r\nbeen insulted, I hung my cassock on a peg, assumed the costume of a\r\ncavalier, and went to a ball given by a lady friend of mine and to\r\nwhich I knew my man was invited. It was in the Rue des\r\nFrance-Bourgeois, close to La Force. As I expected, my officer was\r\nthere. I went up to him as he was singing a love ditty and looking\r\ntenderly at a lady, and interrupted him exactly in the middle of the\r\nsecond couplet. \xe2\x80\x98Monsieur,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98does it still displease you that I\r\nshould frequent a certain house of La Rue Payenne? And would you still\r\ncane me if I took it into my head to disobey you? The officer looked at\r\nme with astonishment, and then said, \xe2\x80\x98What is your business with me,\r\nmonsieur? I do not know you.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I am,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98the little abb\xc3\xa9 who\r\nreads _Lives of the Saints_, and translates Judith into verse.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah,\r\nah! I recollect now,\xe2\x80\x99 said the officer, in a jeering tone; \xe2\x80\x98well, what\r\ndo you want with me?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I want you to spare time to take a walk with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Tomorrow morning, if you like, with the greatest pleasure.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\r\nnot tomorrow morning, if you please, but immediately.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98If you\r\nabsolutely insist.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I do insist upon it.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Come, then. Ladies,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe officer, \xe2\x80\x98do not disturb yourselves; allow me time just to kill\r\nthis gentleman, and I will return and finish the last couplet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe went out. I took him to the Rue Payenne, to exactly the same spot\r\nwhere, a year before, at the very same hour, he had paid me the\r\ncompliment I have related to you. It was a superb moonlight night. We\r\nimmediately drew, and at the first pass I laid him stark dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cas the ladies did not see the singer come\r\nback, and as he was found in the Rue Payenne with a great sword wound\r\nthrough his body, it was supposed that I had accommodated him thus; and\r\nthe matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the\r\ncassock for a time. Athos, whose acquaintance I made about that period,\r\nand Porthos, who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective\r\ntricks of fence, prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a\r\nMusketeer. The king entertained great regard for my father, who had\r\nfallen at the siege of Arras, and the uniform was granted. You may\r\nunderstand that the moment has come for me to re-enter the bosom of the\r\nChurch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why today, rather than yesterday or tomorrow? What has happened to\r\nyou today, to raise all these melancholy ideas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis wound, my dear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, has been a warning to me from heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis wound? Bah, it is now nearly healed, and I am sure it is not that\r\nwhich gives you the most pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, blushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have one at heart, Aramis, one deeper and more painful\xe2\x80\x94a wound\r\nmade by a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eye of Aramis kindled in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, dissembling his emotion under a feigned carelessness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdo not talk of such things, and suffer love pains? _Vanitas\r\nvanitatum!_ According to your idea, then, my brain is turned. And for\r\nwhom\xe2\x80\x94for some _grisette_, some chambermaid with whom I have trifled in\r\nsome garrison? Fie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon, my dear Aramis, but I thought you carried your eyes higher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigher? And who am I, to nourish such ambition? A poor Musketeer, a\r\nbeggar, an unknown\xe2\x80\x94who hates slavery, and finds himself ill-placed in\r\nthe world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAramis, Aramis!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, looking at his friend with an air\r\nof doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDust I am, and to dust I return. Life is full of humiliations and\r\nsorrows,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, becoming still more melancholy; \xe2\x80\x9call the ties\r\nwhich attach him to life break in the hand of man, particularly the\r\ngolden ties. Oh, my dear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Aramis, giving to his\r\nvoice a slight tone of bitterness, \xe2\x80\x9ctrust me! Conceal your wounds when\r\nyou have any; silence is the last joy of the unhappy. Beware of giving\r\nanyone the clue to your griefs; the curious suck our tears as flies\r\nsuck the blood of a wounded hart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, my dear Aramis,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in his turn heaving a profound\r\nsigh, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is my story you are relating!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; a woman whom I love, whom I adore, has just been torn from me by\r\nforce. I do not know where she is or whither they have conducted her.\r\nShe is perhaps a prisoner; she is perhaps dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but you have at least this consolation, that you can say to\r\nyourself she has not quit you voluntarily, that if you learn no news of\r\nher, it is because all communication with you is interdicted; while I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you renounce the world, then, forever; that is a settled thing\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nresolution registered!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForever! You are my friend today; tomorrow you will be no more to me\r\nthan a shadow, or rather, even, you will no longer exist. As for the\r\nworld, it is a sepulcher and nothing else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil! All this is very sad which you tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you? My vocation commands me; it carries me away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan smiled, but made no answer.\r\n\r\nAramis continued, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, while I do belong to the earth, I wish to\r\nspeak of you\xe2\x80\x94of our friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd on my part,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI wished to speak of you, but I\r\nfind you so completely detached from everything! To love you cry, \xe2\x80\x98Fie!\r\nFriends are shadows! The world is a sepulcher!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, you will find it so yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, let us say no more about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cand let us\r\nburn this letter, which, no doubt, announces to you some fresh\r\ninfidelity of your _grisette_ or your chambermaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat letter?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Aramis, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA letter which was sent to your abode in your absence, and which was\r\ngiven to me for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut from whom is that letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, from some heartbroken waiting woman, some desponding _grisette;_\r\nfrom Madame de Chevreuse\xe2\x80\x99s chambermaid, perhaps, who was obliged to\r\nreturn to Tours with her mistress, and who, in order to appear smart\r\nand attractive, stole some perfumed paper, and sealed her letter with a\r\nduchess\xe2\x80\x99s coronet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold! I must have lost it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man maliciously, pretending\r\nto search for it. \xe2\x80\x9cBut fortunately the world is a sepulcher; the men,\r\nand consequently the women, are but shadows, and love is a sentiment to\r\nwhich you cry, \xe2\x80\x98Fie! Fie!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are killing me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here it is at last!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, as he drew the letter from\r\nhis pocket.\r\n\r\nAramis made a bound, seized the letter, read it, or rather devoured it,\r\nhis countenance radiant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis same waiting maid seems to have an agreeable style,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nmessenger, carelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, thanks!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Aramis, almost in a state of\r\ndelirium. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was forced to return to Tours; she is not faithless; she\r\nstill loves me! Come, my friend, come, let me embrace you. Happiness\r\nalmost stifles me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two friends began to dance around the venerable St. Chrysostom,\r\nkicking about famously the sheets of the thesis, which had fallen on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Bazin entered with the spinach and the omelet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe off, you wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Aramis, throwing his skullcap in his face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReturn whence you came; take back those horrible vegetables, and that\r\npoor kickshaw! Order a larded hare, a fat capon, mutton leg dressed\r\nwith garlic, and four bottles of old Burgundy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBazin, who looked at his master, without comprehending the cause of\r\nthis change, in a melancholy manner, allowed the omelet to slip into\r\nthe spinach, and the spinach onto the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the King of\r\nkings,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cif you persist in offering him a civility.\r\n_Non inutile desiderium oblatione_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the devil with your Latin. Let us drink, my dear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\n_morbleu!_ Let us drink while the wine is fresh! Let us drink heartily,\r\nand while we do so, tell me a little of what is going on in the world\r\nyonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVII.\r\nTHE WIFE OF ATHOS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now to search for Athos,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to the vivacious\r\nAramis, when he had informed him of all that had passed since their\r\ndeparture from the capital, and an excellent dinner had made one of\r\nthem forget his thesis and the other his fatigue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think, then, that any harm can have happened to him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nAramis. \xe2\x80\x9cAthos is so cool, so brave, and handles his sword so\r\nskillfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt. Nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of\r\nAthos than I have; but I like better to hear my sword clang against\r\nlances than against staves. I fear lest Athos should have been beaten\r\ndown by serving men. Those fellows strike hard, and don\xe2\x80\x99t leave off in\r\na hurry. This is why I wish to set out again as soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will try to accompany you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I scarcely feel in\r\na condition to mount on horseback. Yesterday I undertook to employ that\r\ncord which you see hanging against the wall, but pain prevented my\r\ncontinuing the pious exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the first time I ever heard of anybody trying to cure gunshot\r\nwounds with cat-o\xe2\x80\x99-nine-tails; but you were ill, and illness renders\r\nthe head weak, therefore you may be excused.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen do you mean to set out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow at daybreak. Sleep as soundly as you can tonight, and\r\ntomorrow, if you can, we will take our departure together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill tomorrow, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis; \xe2\x80\x9cfor iron-nerved as you are, you\r\nmust need repose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan entered Aramis\xe2\x80\x99s chamber, he found\r\nhim at the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you looking at?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith! I am admiring three magnificent horses which the stable boys\r\nare leading about. It would be a pleasure worthy of a prince to travel\r\nupon such horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear Aramis, you may enjoy that pleasure, for one of those\r\nthree horses is yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, bah! Which?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhichever of the three you like, I have no preference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the rich caparison, is that mine, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou laugh, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have left off laughing, now that you speak French.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, those rich holsters, that velvet housing, that saddle studded\r\nwith silver\xe2\x80\x94are they all for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you and nobody else, as the horse which paws the ground is mine,\r\nand the other horse, which is caracoling, belongs to Athos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Peste!_ They are three superb animals!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad they please you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it must have been the king who made you such a present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly it was not the cardinal; but don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself whence\r\nthey come, think only that one of the three is your property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI choose that which the red-headed boy is leading.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heaven! That is enough to drive away all my pains; I could mount\r\nhim with thirty balls in my body. On my soul, handsome stirrups!\r\n_Hol\xc3\xa0_, Bazin, come here this minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBazin appeared on the threshold, dull and spiritless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat last order is useless,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cthere are loaded\r\npistols in your holsters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBazin sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Monsieur Bazin, make yourself easy,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cpeople of\r\nall conditions gain the kingdom of heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur was already such a good theologian,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bazin, almost\r\nweeping; \xe2\x80\x9che might have become a bishop, and perhaps a cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but my poor Bazin, reflect a little. Of what use is it to be a\r\nchurchman, pray? You do not avoid going to war by that means; you see,\r\nthe cardinal is about to make the next campaign, helm on head and\r\npartisan in hand. And Monsieur de Nogaret de la Valette, what do you\r\nsay of him? He is a cardinal likewise. Ask his lackey how often he has\r\nhad to prepare lint of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Bazin. \xe2\x80\x9cI know it, monsieur; everything is turned\r\ntopsy-turvy in the world nowadays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile this dialogue was going on, the two young men and the poor lackey\r\ndescended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold my stirrup, Bazin,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Aramis; and Aramis sprang into the\r\nsaddle with his usual grace and agility, but after a few vaults and\r\ncurvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so\r\ninsupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who, foreseeing such an event, had kept his eye on him,\r\nsprang toward him, caught him in his arms, and assisted him to his\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, my dear Aramis, take care of yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill go alone in search of Athos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a man of brass,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have good luck, that is all. But how do you mean to pass your\r\ntime till I come back? No more theses, no more glosses upon the fingers\r\nor upon benedictions, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI will make verses,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I dare say; verses perfumed with the odor of the billet from the\r\nattendant of Madame de Chevreuse. Teach Bazin prosody; that will\r\nconsole him. As to the horse, ride him a little every day, and that\r\nwill accustom you to his maneuvers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, make yourself easy on that head,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will find\r\nme ready to follow you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey took leave of each other, and in ten minutes, after having\r\ncommended his friend to the cares of the hostess and Bazin, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nwas trotting along in the direction of Amiens.\r\n\r\nHow was he going to find Athos? Should he find him at all? The position\r\nin which he had left him was critical. He probably had succumbed. This\r\nidea, while darkening his brow, drew several sighs from him, and caused\r\nhim to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance. Of all his\r\nfriends, Athos was the eldest, and the least resembling him in\r\nappearance, in his tastes and sympathies.\r\n\r\nYet he entertained a marked preference for this gentleman. The noble\r\nand distinguished air of Athos, those flashes of greatness which from\r\ntime to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept\r\nhimself, that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most\r\npleasant companion in the world, that forced and cynical gaiety, that\r\nbravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the\r\nresult of the rarest coolness\xe2\x80\x94such qualities attracted more than the\r\nesteem, more than the friendship of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; they attracted his\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when placed beside M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, the elegant and noble\r\ncourtier, Athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain\r\na comparison. He was of middle height; but his person was so admirably\r\nshaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles\r\nwith Porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was\r\nproverbial among the Musketeers. His head, with piercing eyes, a\r\nstraight nose, a chin cut like that of Brutus, had altogether an\r\nindefinable character of grandeur and grace. His hands, of which he\r\ntook little care, were the despair of Aramis, who cultivated his with\r\nalmond paste and perfumed oil. The sound of his voice was at once\r\npenetrating and melodious; and then, that which was inconceivable in\r\nAthos, who was always retiring, was that delicate knowledge of the\r\nworld and of the usages of the most brilliant society\xe2\x80\x94those manners of\r\na high degree which appeared, as if unconsciously to himself, in his\r\nleast actions.\r\n\r\nIf a repast were on foot, Athos presided over it better than any other,\r\nplacing every guest exactly in the rank which his ancestors had earned\r\nfor him or that he had made for himself. If a question in heraldry were\r\nstarted, Athos knew all the noble families of the kingdom, their\r\ngenealogy, their alliances, their coats of arms, and the origin of\r\nthem. Etiquette had no minuti\xc3\xa6 unknown to him. He knew what were the\r\nrights of the great land owners. He was profoundly versed in hunting\r\nand falconry, and had one day when conversing on this great art\r\nastonished even Louis XIII. himself, who took a pride in being\r\nconsidered a past master therein.\r\n\r\nLike all the great nobles of that period, Athos rode and fenced to\r\nperfection. But still further, his education had been so little\r\nneglected, even with respect to scholastic studies, so rare at this\r\ntime among gentlemen, that he smiled at the scraps of Latin which\r\nAramis sported and which Porthos pretended to understand. Two or three\r\ntimes, even, to the great astonishment of his friends, he had, when\r\nAramis allowed some rudimental error to escape him, replaced a verb in\r\nits right tense and a noun in its case. Besides, his probity was\r\nirreproachable, in an age in which soldiers compromised so easily with\r\ntheir religion and their consciences, lovers with the rigorous delicacy\r\nof our era, and the poor with God\xe2\x80\x99s Seventh Commandment. This Athos,\r\nthen, was a very extraordinary man.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this nature so distinguished, this creature so beautiful, this\r\nessence so fine, was seen to turn insensibly toward material life, as\r\nold men turn toward physical and moral imbecility. Athos, in his hours\r\nof gloom\xe2\x80\x94and these hours were frequent\xe2\x80\x94was extinguished as to the whole\r\nof the luminous portion of him, and his brilliant side disappeared as\r\ninto profound darkness.\r\n\r\nThen the demigod vanished; he remained scarcely a man. His head hanging\r\ndown, his eye dull, his speech slow and painful, Athos would look for\r\nhours together at his bottle, his glass, or at Grimaud, who, accustomed\r\nto obey him by signs, read in the faint glance of his master his least\r\ndesire, and satisfied it immediately. If the four friends were\r\nassembled at one of these moments, a word, thrown forth occasionally\r\nwith a violent effort, was the share Athos furnished to the\r\nconversation. In exchange for his silence Athos drank enough for four,\r\nand without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more\r\nmarked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with, had\r\nnot\xe2\x80\x94whatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this\r\nsubject\xe2\x80\x94been able to assign any cause for these fits, or for the\r\nperiods of their recurrence. Athos never received any letters; Athos\r\nnever had concerns which all his friends did not know.\r\n\r\nIt could not be said that it was wine which produced this sadness; for\r\nin truth he only drank to combat this sadness, which wine however, as\r\nwe have said, rendered still darker. This excess of bilious humor could\r\nnot be attributed to play; for unlike Porthos, who accompanied the\r\nvariations of chance with songs or oaths, Athos when he won remained as\r\nunmoved as when he lost. He had been known, in the circle of the\r\nMusketeers, to win in one night three thousand pistoles; to lose them\r\neven to the gold-embroidered belt for gala days, win all this again\r\nwith the addition of a hundred louis, without his beautiful eyebrow\r\nbeing heightened or lowered half a line, without his hands losing their\r\npearly hue, without his conversation, which was cheerful that evening,\r\nceasing to be calm and agreeable.\r\n\r\nNeither was it, as with our neighbors, the English, an atmospheric\r\ninfluence which darkened his countenance; for the sadness generally\r\nbecame more intense toward the fine season of the year. June and July\r\nwere the terrible months with Athos.\r\n\r\nFor the present he had no anxiety. He shrugged his shoulders when\r\npeople spoke of the future. His secret, then, was in the past, as had\r\noften been vaguely said to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\nThis mysterious shade, spread over his whole person, rendered still\r\nmore interesting the man whose eyes or mouth, even in the most complete\r\nintoxication, had never revealed anything, however skillfully questions\r\nhad been put to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d thought D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cpoor Athos is perhaps at this moment dead,\r\nand dead by my fault\xe2\x80\x94for it was I who dragged him into this affair, of\r\nwhich he did not know the origin, of which he is ignorant of the\r\nresult, and from which he can derive no advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout reckoning, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d added Planchet to his master\xe2\x80\x99s audibly\r\nexpressed reflections, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we perhaps owe our lives to him. Do you\r\nremember how he cried, \xe2\x80\x98On, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, on, I am taken\xe2\x80\x99? And when he\r\nhad discharged his two pistols, what a terrible noise he made with his\r\nsword! One might have said that twenty men, or rather twenty mad\r\ndevils, were fighting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words redoubled the eagerness of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who urged his horse,\r\nthough he stood in need of no incitement, and they proceeded at a rapid\r\npace. About eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning they perceived Amiens, and at\r\nhalf past eleven they were at the door of the cursed inn.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those\r\nhearty vengeances which offer consolation while they are hoped for. He\r\nentered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes, his left hand\r\non the pommel of the sword, and cracking his whip with his right hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember me?\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the host, who advanced to greet him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not that honor, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the latter, his eyes\r\ndazzled by the brilliant style in which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan traveled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, two words will refresh your memory. What have you done with that\r\ngentleman against whom you had the audacity, about twelve days ago, to\r\nmake an accusation of passing false money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe host became as pale as death; for D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had assumed a\r\nthreatening attitude, and Planchet modeled himself after his master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monseigneur, do not mention it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the host, in the most\r\npitiable voice imaginable. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, monseigneur, how dearly have I paid for\r\nthat fault, unhappy wretch as I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat gentleman, I say, what has become of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeign to listen to me, monseigneur, and be merciful! Sit down, in\r\nmercy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, mute with anger and anxiety, took a seat in the threatening\r\nattitude of a judge. Planchet glared fiercely over the back of his\r\narmchair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the story, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the trembling host; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I\r\nnow recollect you. It was you who rode off at the moment I had that\r\nunfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was I; so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to\r\nexpect if you do not tell me the whole truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCondescend to listen to me, and you shall know all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had been warned by the authorities that a celebrated coiner of bad\r\nmoney would arrive at my inn, with several of his companions, all\r\ndisguised as Guards or Musketeers. Monseigneur, I was furnished with a\r\ndescription of your horses, your lackeys, your countenances\xe2\x80\x94nothing was\r\nomitted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, go on!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who quickly understood whence such an\r\nexact description had come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took then, in conformity with the orders of the authorities, who\r\nsent me a reinforcement of six men, such measures as I thought\r\nnecessary to get possession of the persons of the pretended coiners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgain!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, whose ears chafed terribly under the\r\nrepetition of this word _coiners_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, monseigneur, for saying such things, but they form my\r\nexcuse. The authorities had terrified me, and you know that an\r\ninnkeeper must keep on good terms with the authorities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut once again, that gentleman\xe2\x80\x94where is he? What has become of him? Is\r\nhe dead? Is he living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatience, monseigneur, we are coming to it. There happened then that\r\nwhich you know, and of which your precipitate departure,\xe2\x80\x9d added the\r\nhost, with an acuteness that did not escape D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cappeared to\r\nauthorize the issue. That gentleman, your friend, defended himself\r\ndesperately. His lackey, who, by an unforeseen piece of ill luck, had\r\nquarreled with the officers, disguised as stable lads\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiserable scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were all in the plot,\r\nthen! And I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know what prevents me from exterminating you\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, monseigneur, we were not in the plot, as you will soon see.\r\nMonsieur your friend (pardon for not calling him by the honorable name\r\nwhich no doubt he bears, but we do not know that name), Monsieur your\r\nfriend, having disabled two men with his pistols, retreated fighting\r\nwith his sword, with which he disabled one of my men, and stunned me\r\nwith a blow of the flat side of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou villain, will you finish?\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cAthos\xe2\x80\x94what has\r\nbecome of Athos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile fighting and retreating, as I have told Monseigneur, he found\r\nthe door of the cellar stairs behind him, and as the door was open, he\r\ntook out the key, and barricaded himself inside. As we were sure of\r\nfinding him there, we left him alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou did not really wish to kill; you only\r\nwished to imprison him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God! To imprison him, monseigneur? Why, he imprisoned himself, I\r\nswear to you he did. In the first place he had made rough work of it;\r\none man was killed on the spot, and two others were severely wounded.\r\nThe dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades,\r\nand I have heard nothing of either of them since. As for myself, as\r\nsoon as I recovered my senses I went to Monsieur the Governor, to whom\r\nI related all that had passed, and asked, what I should do with my\r\nprisoner. Monsieur the Governor was all astonishment. He told me he\r\nknew nothing about the matter, that the orders I had received did not\r\ncome from him, and that if I had the audacity to mention his name as\r\nbeing concerned in this disturbance he would have me hanged. It appears\r\nthat I had made a mistake, monsieur, that I had arrested the wrong\r\nperson, and that he whom I ought to have arrested had escaped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Athos!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, whose impatience was increased by the\r\ndisregard of the authorities, \xe2\x80\x9cAthos, where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I was anxious to repair the wrongs I had done the prisoner,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nresumed the innkeeper, \xe2\x80\x9cI took my way straight to the cellar in order\r\nto set him at liberty. Ah, monsieur, he was no longer a man, he was a\r\ndevil! To my offer of liberty, he replied that it was nothing but a\r\nsnare, and that before he came out he intended to impose his own\r\nconditions. I told him very humbly\xe2\x80\x94for I could not conceal from myself\r\nthe scrape I had got into by laying hands on one of his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMusketeers\xe2\x80\x94I told him I was quite ready to submit to his conditions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98In the first place,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I wish my lackey placed with me, fully\r\narmed.\xe2\x80\x99 We hastened to obey this order; for you will please to\r\nunderstand, monsieur, we were disposed to do everything your friend\r\ncould desire. Monsieur Grimaud (he told us his name, although he does\r\nnot talk much)\xe2\x80\x94Monsieur Grimaud, then, went down to the cellar, wounded\r\nas he was; then his master, having admitted him, barricaded the door\r\nafresh, and ordered us to remain quietly in our own bar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where is Athos now?\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Athos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the cellar, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you scoundrel! Have you kept him in the cellar all this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerciful heaven! No, monsieur! We keep him in the cellar! You do not\r\nknow what he is about in the cellar. Ah! If you could but persuade him\r\nto come out, monsieur, I should owe you the gratitude of my whole life;\r\nI should adore you as my patron saint!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he is there? I shall find him there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout doubt you will, monsieur; he persists in remaining there. We\r\nevery day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork,\r\nand some meat when he asks for it; but alas! It is not of bread and\r\nmeat of which he makes the greatest consumption. I once endeavored to\r\ngo down with two of my servants; but he flew into terrible rage. I\r\nheard the noise he made in loading his pistols, and his servant in\r\nloading his musketoon. Then, when we asked them what were their\r\nintentions, the master replied that he had forty charges to fire, and\r\nthat he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow\r\na single soul of us to set foot in the cellar. Upon this I went and\r\ncomplained to the governor, who replied that I only had what I\r\ndeserved, and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who\r\ntook up their abode in my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that since that time\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, totally unable to\r\nrefrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo from that time, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the latter, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have led the\r\nmost miserable life imaginable; for you must know, monsieur, that all\r\nour provisions are in the cellar. There is our wine in bottles, and our\r\nwine in casks; the beer, the oil, and the spices, the bacon, and\r\nsausages. And as we are prevented from going down there, we are forced\r\nto refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house; so\r\nthat our hostelry is daily going to ruin. If your friend remains\r\nanother week in my cellar I shall be a ruined man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not more than justice, either, you ass! Could you not perceive by\r\nour appearance that we were people of quality, and not coiners\xe2\x80\x94say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur, you are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the host. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, hark, hark! There\r\nhe is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody has disturbed him, without doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he must be disturbed,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the host; \xe2\x80\x9cHere are two English\r\ngentlemen just arrived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the English like good wine, as you may know, monsieur; these\r\nhave asked for the best. My wife has perhaps requested permission of\r\nMonsieur Athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen; and\r\nhe, as usual, has refused. Ah, good heaven! There is the hullabaloo\r\nlouder than ever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in fact, heard a great noise on the side next the cellar.\r\nHe rose, and preceded by the host wringing his hands, and followed by\r\nPlanchet with his musketoon ready for use, he approached the scene of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen were exasperated; they had had a long ride, and were\r\ndying with hunger and thirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is tyranny!\xe2\x80\x9d cried one of them, in very good French, though\r\nwith a foreign accent, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this madman will not allow these good\r\npeople access to their own wine! Nonsense, let us break open the door,\r\nand if he is too far gone in his madness, well, we will kill him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoftly, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, drawing his pistols from his\r\nbelt, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will kill nobody, if you please!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood, good!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the calm voice of Athos, from the other side of the\r\ndoor, \xe2\x80\x9clet them just come in, these devourers of little children, and\r\nwe shall see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrave as they appeared to be, the two English gentlemen looked at each\r\nother hesitatingly. One might have thought there was in that cellar one\r\nof those famished ogres\xe2\x80\x94the gigantic heroes of popular legends, into\r\nwhose cavern nobody could force their way with impunity.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence; but at length the two Englishmen felt\r\nashamed to draw back, and the angrier one descended the five or six\r\nsteps which led to the cellar, and gave a kick against the door enough\r\nto split a wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlanchet,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, cocking his pistols, \xe2\x80\x9cI will take charge\r\nof the one at the top; you look to the one below. Ah, gentlemen, you\r\nwant battle; and you shall have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the hollow voice of Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cI can hear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, I\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, raising his voice in turn, \xe2\x80\x9cI am here, my\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, good, then,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will teach them, these door\r\nbreakers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen had drawn their swords, but they found themselves taken\r\nbetween two fires. They still hesitated an instant; but, as before,\r\npride prevailed, and a second kick split the door from bottom to top.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand on one side, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, stand on one side,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\ngoing to fire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, whom reflection never abandoned,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgentlemen, think of what you are about. Patience, Athos! You are\r\nrunning your heads into a very silly affair; you will be riddled. My\r\nlackey and I will have three shots at you, and you will get as many\r\nfrom the cellar. You will then have our swords, with which, I can\r\nassure you, my friend and I can play tolerably well. Let me conduct\r\nyour business and my own. You shall soon have something to drink; I\r\ngive you my word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is any left,\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled the jeering voice of Athos.\r\n\r\nThe host felt a cold sweat creep down his back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow! \xe2\x80\x98If there is any left!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d murmured he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil! There must be plenty left,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cBe\r\nsatisfied of that; these two cannot have drunk all the cellar.\r\nGentlemen, return your swords to their scabbards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, provided you replace your pistols in your belt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan set the example. Then, turning toward Planchet, he made\r\nhim a sign to uncock his musketoon.\r\n\r\nThe Englishmen, convinced of these peaceful proceedings, sheathed their\r\nswords grumblingly. The history of Athos\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment was then\r\nrelated to them; and as they were really gentlemen, they pronounced the\r\nhost in the wrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cgo up to your room again; and in\r\nten minutes, I will answer for it, you shall have all you desire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishmen bowed and went upstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I am alone, my dear Athos,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9copen the door, I beg\r\nof you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstantly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\nThen was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the\r\ngroaning of posts; these were the counterscarps and bastions of Athos,\r\nwhich the besieged himself demolished.\r\n\r\nAn instant after, the broken door was removed, and the pale face of\r\nAthos appeared, who with a rapid glance took a survey of the\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly. He then\r\ntried to draw him from his moist abode, but to his surprise he\r\nperceived that Athos staggered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wounded,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI! Not at all. I am dead drunk, that\xe2\x80\x99s all, and never did a man more\r\nstrongly set about getting so. By the Lord, my good host! I must at\r\nleast have drunk for my part a hundred and fifty bottles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the host, \xe2\x80\x9cif the lackey has drunk only half as much as\r\nthe master, I am a ruined man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrimaud is a well-bred lackey. He would never think of faring in the\r\nsame manner as his master; he only drank from the cask. Hark! I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink he put the faucet in again. Do you hear it? It is running now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan burst into a laugh which changed the shiver of the host into\r\na burning fever.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master, with\r\nthe musketoon on his shoulder, and his head shaking. Like one of those\r\ndrunken satyrs in the pictures of Rubens. He was moistened before and\r\nbehind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive\r\noil.\r\n\r\nThe four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of\r\nthe best apartment in the house, which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan occupied with\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the\r\ncellar, which had so long been interdicted to them and where a\r\nfrightful spectacle awaited them.\r\n\r\nBeyond the fortifications through which Athos had made a breach in\r\norder to get out, and which were composed of fagots, planks, and empty\r\ncasks, heaped up according to all the rules of the strategic art, they\r\nfound, swimming in puddles of oil and wine, the bones and fragments of\r\nall the hams they had eaten; while a heap of broken bottles filled the\r\nwhole left-hand corner of the cellar, and a tun, the cock of which was\r\nleft running, was yielding, by this means, the last drop of its blood.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe image of devastation and death,\xe2\x80\x9d as the ancient poet says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9creigned as over a field of battle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf fifty large sausages, suspended from the joists, scarcely ten\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nThen the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the\r\ncellar. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan himself was moved by them. Athos did not even turn\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nTo grief succeeded rage. The host armed himself with a spit, and rushed\r\ninto the chamber occupied by the two friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome wine!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, on perceiving the host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome wine!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the stupefied host, \xe2\x80\x9csome wine? Why you have drunk\r\nmore than a hundred pistoles\xe2\x80\x99 worth! I am a ruined man, lost,\r\ndestroyed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cwe were always dry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had been contented with drinking, well and good; but you have\r\nbroken all the bottles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou pushed me upon a heap which rolled down. That was your fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll my oil is lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOil is a sovereign balm for wounds; and my poor Grimaud here was\r\nobliged to dress those you had inflicted on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll my sausages are gnawed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is an enormous quantity of rats in that cellar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall pay me for all this,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the exasperated host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTriple ass!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, rising; but he sank down again immediately.\r\nHe had tried his strength to the utmost. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan came to his relief\r\nwith his whip in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe host drew back and burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis will teach you,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cto treat the guests God sends\r\nyou in a more courteous fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod? Say the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cif you annoy us in this manner we\r\nwill all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar, and we will see\r\nif the mischief is as great as you say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the host, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been wrong. I confess it, but\r\npardon to every sin! You are gentlemen, and I am a poor innkeeper. You\r\nwill have pity on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, if you speak in that way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will break my heart,\r\nand the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the cask.\r\nWe are not such devils as we appear to be. Come hither, and let us\r\ntalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe host approached with hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome hither, I say, and don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the\r\nvery moment when I was about to pay you, I had placed my purse on the\r\ntable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat purse contained sixty pistoles; where is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeposited with the justice; they said it was bad money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; get me my purse back and keep the sixty pistoles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which\r\nit once lays hold of. If it were bad money, there might be some hopes;\r\nbut unfortunately, those were all good pieces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cManage the matter as well as you can, my good man; it does not concern\r\nme, the more so as I have not a livre left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9clet us inquire further. Athos\xe2\x80\x99s horse, where\r\nis that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the stable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much is it worth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifty pistoles at most.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s worth eighty. Take it, and there ends the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos, \xe2\x80\x9care you selling my horse\xe2\x80\x94my Bajazet? And pray\r\nupon what shall I make my campaign; upon Grimaud?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have brought you another,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a magnificent one!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, since there is another finer and younger, why, you may take the\r\nold one; and let us drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the host, quite cheerful again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of that at the bottom, near the laths. There are twenty-five\r\nbottles of it left; all the rest were broken by my fall. Bring six of\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this man is a cask!\xe2\x80\x9d said the host, aside. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he only remains\r\nhere a fortnight, and pays for what he drinks, I shall soon\r\nre-establish my business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t forget,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cto bring up four bottles of the\r\nsame sort for the two English gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile they bring the wine, tell me, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\nwhat has become of the others, come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan related how he had found Porthos in bed with a strained\r\nknee, and Aramis at a table between two theologians. As he finished,\r\nthe host entered with the wine ordered and a ham which, fortunately for\r\nhim, had been left out of the cellar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s well!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, filling his glass and that of his friend;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s to Porthos and Aramis! But you, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, what is the matter\r\nwith you, and what has happened to you personally? You have a sad air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cit is because I am the most unfortunate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresently,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresently! And why presently? Because you think I am drunk?\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, remember this! My ideas are never so clear as when I have\r\nhad plenty of wine. Speak, then, I am all ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan related his adventure with Mme. Bonacieux. Athos listened to\r\nhim without a frown; and when he had finished, said, \xe2\x80\x9cTrifles, only\r\ntrifles!\xe2\x80\x9d That was his favorite word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always say _trifles_, my dear Athos!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cand that\r\ncomes very ill from you, who have never loved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe drink-deadened eye of Athos flashed out, but only for a moment; it\r\nbecame as dull and vacant as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cfor my part I have never loved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAcknowledge, then, you stony heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are\r\nwrong to be so hard upon us tender hearts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTender hearts! Pierced hearts!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say that love is a lottery in which he who wins, wins death! You are\r\nvery fortunate to have lost, believe me, my dear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. And if I\r\nhave any counsel to give, it is, always lose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe seemed to love me so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe _seemed_, did she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she _did_ love me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou child, why, there is not a man who has not believed, as you do,\r\nthat his mistress loved him, and there lives not a man who has not been\r\ndeceived by his mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept you, Athos, who never had one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s true! I\r\nnever had one! Let us drink!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then, philosopher that you are,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cinstruct me,\r\nsupport me. I stand in need of being taught and consoled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsoled for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my misfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour misfortune is laughable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, shrugging his shoulders; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould like to know what you would say if I were to relate to you a\r\nreal tale of love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich has happened to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr one of my friends, what matters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell it, Athos, tell it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter if I drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrink and relate, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bad idea!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, emptying and refilling his glass. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ntwo things agree marvelously well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am all attention,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\nAthos collected himself, and in proportion as he did so, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan saw\r\nthat he became pale. He was at that period of intoxication in which\r\nvulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to sleep. He kept himself\r\nupright and dreamed, without sleeping. This somnambulism of drunkenness\r\nhad something frightful in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou particularly wish it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pray for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it then as you desire. One of my friends\xe2\x80\x94one of my friends, please\r\nto observe, not myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, interrupting himself with a\r\nmelancholy smile, \xe2\x80\x9cone of the counts of my province\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, of\r\nBerry\xe2\x80\x94noble as a Dandolo or a Montmorency, at twenty-five years of age\r\nfell in love with a girl of sixteen, beautiful as fancy can paint.\r\nThrough the ingenuousness of her age beamed an ardent mind, not of the\r\nwoman, but of the poet. She did not please; she intoxicated. She lived\r\nin a small town with her brother, who was a curate. Both had recently\r\ncome into the country. They came nobody knew whence; but when seeing\r\nher so lovely and her brother so pious, nobody thought of asking whence\r\nthey came. They were said, however, to be of good extraction. My\r\nfriend, who was seigneur of the country, might have seduced her, or\r\ntaken her by force, at his will\xe2\x80\x94for he was master. Who would have come\r\nto the assistance of two strangers, two unknown persons? Unfortunately\r\nhe was an honorable man; he married her. The fool! The ass! The idiot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so, if he loved her?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cHe took her to his ch\xc3\xa2teau, and made her the first\r\nlady in the province; and in justice it must be allowed that she\r\nsupported her rank becomingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, one day when she was hunting with her husband,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Athos,\r\nin a low voice, and speaking very quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cshe fell from her horse and\r\nfainted. The count flew to her to help, and as she appeared to be\r\noppressed by her clothes, he ripped them open with his poniard, and in\r\nso doing laid bare her shoulder. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, with a\r\nmaniacal burst of laughter, \xe2\x80\x9cguess what she had on her shoulder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I tell?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA _fleur-de-lis_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was branded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorror!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruth, my friend. The angel was a demon; the poor young girl had\r\nstolen the sacred vessels from a church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did the count do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe count was of the highest nobility. He had on his estates the\r\nrights of high and low tribunals. He tore the dress of the countess to\r\npieces; he tied her hands behind her, and hanged her on a tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeavens, Athos, a murder?\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo less,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, as pale as a corpse. \xe2\x80\x9cBut methinks I need wine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left, put it to his\r\nmouth, and emptied it at a single draught, as he would have emptied an\r\nordinary glass.\r\n\r\nThen he let his head sink upon his two hands, while D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan stood\r\nbefore him, stupefied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat has cured me of beautiful, poetical, and loving women,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAthos, after a considerable pause, raising his head, and forgetting to\r\ncontinue the fiction of the count. \xe2\x80\x9cGod grant you as much! Let us\r\ndrink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she is dead?\xe2\x80\x9d stammered D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Parbleu!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cBut hold out your glass. Some ham, my boy, or\r\nwe can\xe2\x80\x99t drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd her brother?\xe2\x80\x9d added D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer brother?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the priest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise; but\r\nhe was beforehand with me, he had quit the curacy the night before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it ever known who this miserable fellow was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair lady. A\r\nworthy man, who had pretended to be a curate for the purpose of getting\r\nhis mistress married, and securing her a position. He has been hanged\r\nand quartered, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, quite stunned by the relation of\r\nthis horrible adventure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTaste some of this ham, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; it is exquisite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos,\r\ncutting a slice, which he placed on the young man\xe2\x80\x99s plate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity it is there were only four like this in the cellar. I\r\ncould have drunk fifty bottles more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan could no longer endure this conversation, which had made him\r\nbewildered. Allowing his head to sink upon his two hands, he pretended\r\nto sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese young fellows can none of them drink,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, looking at\r\nhim with pity, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet this is one of the best!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVIII.\r\nTHE RETURN\r\n\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of Athos; yet many\r\nthings appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation. In the\r\nfirst place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half\r\ndrunk; and yet, in spite of the incertainty which the vapor of three or\r\nfour bottles of Burgundy carries with it to the brain, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, when\r\nawaking on the following morning, had all the words of Athos as present\r\nto his memory as if they then fell from his mouth\xe2\x80\x94they had been so\r\nimpressed upon his mind. All this doubt only gave rise to a more lively\r\ndesire of arriving at a certainty, and he went into his friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchamber with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the\r\npreceding evening; but he found Athos quite himself again\xe2\x80\x94that is to\r\nsay, the most shrewd and impenetrable of men. Besides which, the\r\nMusketeer, after having exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him,\r\nbroached the matter first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was pretty drunk yesterday, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI can tell that\r\nby my tongue, which was swollen and hot this morning, and by my pulse,\r\nwhich was very tremulous. I wager that I uttered a thousand\r\nextravagances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that\r\nembarrassed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cif I recollect well what you said, it was\r\nnothing out of the common way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you surprise me. I thought I had told you a most lamentable\r\nstory.\xe2\x80\x9d And he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom\r\nof his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cit appears that I was more drunk than\r\nyou, since I remember nothing of the kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos did not trust this reply, and he resumed; \xe2\x80\x9cyou cannot have failed\r\nto remark, my dear friend, that everyone has his particular kind of\r\ndrunkenness, sad or gay. My drunkenness is always sad, and when I am\r\nthoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which\r\nmy foolish nurse inculcated into my brain. That is my failing\xe2\x80\x94a capital\r\nfailing, I admit; but with that exception, I am a good drinker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos spoke this in so natural a manner that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was shaken in\r\nhis conviction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is that, then,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young man, anxious to find out the\r\ntruth, \xe2\x80\x9cit is that, then, I remember as we remember a dream. We were\r\nspeaking of hanging.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you see how it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, becoming still paler, but yet\r\nattempting to laugh; \xe2\x80\x9cI was sure it was so\xe2\x80\x94the hanging of people is my\r\nnightmare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember now; yes, it was about\xe2\x80\x94stop\r\na minute\xe2\x80\x94yes, it was about a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos, becoming almost livid; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is my grand\r\nstory of the fair lady, and when I relate that, I must be very drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that was it,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthe story of a tall, fair lady,\r\nwith blue eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, who was hanged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy her husband, who was a nobleman of your acquaintance,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, looking intently at Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know\r\nwhat he says,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos, shrugging his shoulders as if he thought\r\nhimself an object of pity. \xe2\x80\x9cI certainly never will get drunk again,\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; it is too bad a habit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan remained silent; and then changing the conversation all at\r\nonce, Athos said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the by, I thank you for the horse you have brought me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it to your mind?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but it is not a horse for hard work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken; I rode him nearly ten leagues in less than an hour\r\nand a half, and he appeared no more distressed than if he had only made\r\nthe tour of the Place St. Sulpice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you begin to awaken my regret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRegret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I have parted with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, here is the simple fact. This morning I awoke at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock. You\r\nwere still fast asleep, and I did not know what to do with myself; I\r\nwas still stupid from our yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s debauch. As I came into the\r\npublic room, I saw one of our Englishman bargaining with a dealer for a\r\nhorse, his own having died yesterday from bleeding. I drew near, and\r\nfound he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Pardieu_,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98my good gentleman, I have a horse to sell, too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, and a very fine one! I saw him yesterday; your friend\xe2\x80\x99s lackey was\r\nleading him.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Do you think he is worth a hundred pistoles?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes! Will\r\nyou sell him to me for that sum?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No; but I will play for him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98At dice.\xe2\x80\x99 No sooner said than done, and I lost the horse. Ah,\r\nah! But please to observe I won back the equipage,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan looked much disconcerted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis vexes you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must confess it does,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cThat horse was to\r\nhave identified us in the day of battle. It was a pledge, a\r\nremembrance. Athos, you have done wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear friend, put yourself in my place,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Musketeer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was hipped to death; and still further, upon my honor, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nEnglish horses. If it is only to be recognized, why the saddle will\r\nsuffice for that; it is quite remarkable enough. As to the horse, we\r\ncan easily find some excuse for its disappearance. Why the devil! A\r\nhorse is mortal; suppose mine had had the glanders or the farcy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan did not smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt vexes me greatly,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you attach so much\r\nimportance to these animals, for I am not yet at the end of my story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else have you done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter having lost my own horse, nine against ten\xe2\x80\x94see how near\xe2\x80\x94I formed\r\nan idea of staking yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but you stopped at the idea, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; for I put it in execution that very minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the consequence?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in great anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI threw, and I lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, my horse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour horse, seven against eight; a point short\xe2\x80\x94you know the proverb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAthos, you are not in your right senses, I swear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear lad, that was yesterday, when I was telling you silly stories,\r\nit was proper to tell me that, and not this morning. I lost him then,\r\nwith all his appointments and furniture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, this is frightful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a minute; you don\xe2\x80\x99t know all yet. I should make an excellent\r\ngambler if I were not too hot-headed; but I was hot-headed, just as if\r\nI had been drinking. Well, I was not hot-headed then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but what else could you play for? You had nothing left?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, my friend; there was still that diamond left which sparkles\r\non your finger, and which I had observed yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis diamond!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, placing his hand eagerly on his ring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as I am a connoisseur in such things, having had a few of my own\r\nonce, I estimated it at a thousand pistoles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, half dead with fright, \xe2\x80\x9cyou made no mention\r\nof my diamond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, my dear friend, this diamond became our only\r\nresource; with it I might regain our horses and their harnesses, and\r\neven money to pay our expenses on the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAthos, you make me tremble!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mentioned your diamond then to my adversary, who had likewise\r\nremarked it. What the devil, my dear, do you think you can wear a star\r\nfrom heaven on your finger, and nobody observe it? Impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, go on, my dear fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cfor upon my honor,\r\nyou will kill me with your indifference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe divided, then, this diamond into ten parts of a hundred pistoles\r\neach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are laughing at me, and want to try me!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, whom\r\nanger began to take by the hair, as Minerva takes Achilles, in the\r\n_Iliad_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not jest, _mordieu!_ I should like to have seen you in my\r\nplace! I had been fifteen days without seeing a human face, and had\r\nbeen left to brutalize myself in the company of bottles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was no reason for staking my diamond!\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\nclosing his hand with a nervous spasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear the end. Ten parts of a hundred pistoles each, in ten throws,\r\nwithout revenge; in thirteen throws I had lost all\xe2\x80\x94in thirteen throws.\r\nThe number thirteen was always fatal to me; it was on the thirteenth of\r\nJuly that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ventrebleu!_\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, rising from the table, the story of\r\nthe present day making him forget that of the preceding one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatience!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cI had a plan. The Englishman was an original;\r\nI had seen him conversing that morning with Grimaud, and Grimaud had\r\ntold me that he had made him proposals to enter into his service. I\r\nstaked Grimaud, the silent Grimaud, divided into ten portions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what next?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, laughing in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrimaud himself, understand; and with the ten parts of Grimaud, which\r\nare not worth a ducatoon, I regained the diamond. Tell me, now, if\r\npersistence is not a virtue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith! But this is droll,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, consoled, and holding\r\nhis sides with laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may guess, finding the luck turned, that I again staked the\r\ndiamond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, becoming angry again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won back your harness, then your horse, then my harness, then my\r\nhorse, and then I lost again. In brief, I regained your harness and\r\nthen mine. That\xe2\x80\x99s where we are. That was a superb throw, so I left off\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the diamond is safe?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIntact, my dear friend; besides the harness of your Bucephalus and\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is the use of harnesses without horses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have an idea about them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAthos, you make me shudder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me. You have not played for a long time, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have no inclination to play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwear to nothing. You have not played for a long time, I said; you\r\nought, then, to have a good hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; the Englishman and his companion are still here. I remarked that\r\nhe regretted the horse furniture very much. You appear to think much of\r\nyour horse. In your place I would stake the furniture against the\r\nhorse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he will not wish for only one harness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStake both, _pardieu!_ I am not selfish, as you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would do so?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, undecided, so strongly did the\r\nconfidence of Athos begin to prevail, in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my honor, in one single throw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut having lost the horses, I am particularly anxious to preserve the\r\nharnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStake your diamond, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis? That\xe2\x80\x99s another matter. Never, never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cI would propose to you to stake Planchet, but\r\nas that has already been done, the Englishman would not, perhaps, be\r\nwilling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly, my dear Athos,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like better not\r\nto risk anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, coolly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Englishman is overflowing\r\nwith pistoles. Good Lord, try one throw! One throw is soon made!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I lose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will win.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I lose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you will surrender the harnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave with you for one throw!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\nAthos went in quest of the Englishman, whom he found in the stable,\r\nexamining the harnesses with a greedy eye. The opportunity was good. He\r\nproposed the conditions\xe2\x80\x94the two harnesses, either against one horse or\r\na hundred pistoles. The Englishman calculated fast; the two harnesses\r\nwere worth three hundred pistoles. He consented.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand, and turned up the\r\nnumber three; his paleness terrified Athos, who, however, consented\r\nhimself with saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a sad throw, comrade; you will have the\r\nhorses fully equipped, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishman, quite triumphant, did not even give himself the trouble\r\nto shake the dice. He threw them on the table without looking at them,\r\nso sure was he of victory; D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan turned aside to conceal his ill\r\nhumor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold, hold, hold!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, wit his quiet tone; \xe2\x80\x9cthat throw of the\r\ndice is extraordinary. I have not seen such a one four times in my\r\nlife. Two aces!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishman looked, and was seized with astonishment. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nlooked, and was seized with pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cfour times only; once at the house of Monsieur\r\nCr\xc3\xa9quy; another time at my own house in the country, in my ch\xc3\xa2teau\r\nat\xe2\x80\x94when I had a ch\xc3\xa2teau; a third time at Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s where\r\nit surprised us all; and the fourth time at a cabaret, where it fell to\r\nmy lot, and where I lost a hundred louis and a supper on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Monsieur takes his horse back again,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Englishman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there is no revenge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur conditions said, \xe2\x80\x98No revenge,\xe2\x80\x99 you will please to recollect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true; the horse shall be restored to your lackey, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cwith your permission, monsieur, I wish to\r\nspeak a word with my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos drew D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Tempter, what more do you want with me?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwant me to throw again, do you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I would wish you to reflect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to take your horse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wrong, then. I would take the hundred pistoles. You know you\r\nhave staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles, at\r\nyour choice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I repeat, you are wrong. What is the use of one horse for\r\nus two? I could not ride behind. We should look like the two sons of\r\nAymon, who had lost their brother. You cannot think of humiliating me\r\nby prancing along by my side on that magnificent charger. For my part,\r\nI should not hesitate a moment; I should take the hundred pistoles. We\r\nwant money for our return to Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much attached to that horse, Athos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there again you are wrong. A horse slips and injures a joint; a\r\nhorse stumbles and breaks his knees to the bone; a horse eats out of a\r\nmanger in which a glandered horse has eaten. There is a horse, while on\r\nthe contrary, the hundred pistoles feed their master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how shall we get back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon our lackey\xe2\x80\x99s horses, _pardieu_. Anybody may see by our bearing\r\nthat we are people of condition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty figures we shall cut on ponies while Aramis and Porthos\r\ncaracole on their steeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAramis! Porthos!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos, and laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who did not at all comprehend the\r\nhilarity of his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, nothing! Go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour advice, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo take the hundred pistoles, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. With the hundred pistoles we\r\ncan live well to the end of the month. We have undergone a great deal\r\nof fatigue, remember, and a little rest will do no harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rest? Oh, no, Athos. Once in Paris, I shall prosecute my search for\r\nthat unfortunate woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you may be assured that your horse will not be half so\r\nserviceable to you for that purpose as good golden louis. Take the\r\nhundred pistoles, my friend; take the hundred pistoles!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan only required one reason to be satisfied. This last reason\r\nappeared convincing. Besides, he feared that by resisting longer he\r\nshould appear selfish in the eyes of Athos. He acquiesced, therefore,\r\nand chose the hundred pistoles, which the Englishman paid down on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nThey then determined to depart. Peace with the landlord, in addition to\r\nAthos\xe2\x80\x99s old horse, cost six pistoles. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and Athos took the\r\nnags of Planchet and Grimaud, and the two lackeys started on foot,\r\ncarrying the saddles on their heads.\r\n\r\nHowever ill our two friends were mounted, they were soon far in advance\r\nof their servants, and arrived at Cr\xc3\xa8vec\xc5\x93ur. From a distance they\r\nperceived Aramis, seated in a melancholy manner at his window, looking\r\nout, like Sister Anne, at the dust in the horizon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Hol\xc3\xa0_, Aramis! What the devil are you doing there?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the two\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, is that you, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and you, Athos?\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwas reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world\r\nleave us. My English horse, which has just disappeared amid a cloud of\r\ndust, has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the\r\nthings of the earth. Life itself may be resolved into three words:\r\n_Erat, est, fuit_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich means\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who began to suspect the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich means that I have just been duped\xe2\x80\x94sixty louis for a horse which\r\nby the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and Athos laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be too angry with me, I beg.\r\nNecessity has no law; besides, I am the person punished, as that\r\nrascally horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis, at least. Ah, you\r\nfellows are good managers! You ride on our lackey\xe2\x80\x99s horses, and have\r\nyour own gallant steeds led along carefully by hand, at short stages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same instant a market cart, which some minutes before had\r\nappeared upon the Amiens road, pulled up at the inn, and Planchet and\r\nGrimaud came out of it with the saddles on their heads. The cart was\r\nreturning empty to Paris, and the two lackeys had agreed, for their\r\ntransport, to slake the wagoner\xe2\x80\x99s thirst along the route.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, on seeing them arrive. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing but\r\nsaddles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow do you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly like me! I retained my harness by instinct.\r\n_Hol\xc3\xa0_, Bazin! Bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of\r\nthese gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what have you done with your ecclesiastics?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, I invited them to a dinner the next day,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nAramis. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have some capital wine here\xe2\x80\x94please to observe that in\r\npassing. I did my best to make them drunk. Then the curate forbade me\r\nto quit my uniform, and the Jesuit entreated me to get him made a\r\nMusketeer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout a thesis?\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout a thesis? I demand the\r\nsuppression of the thesis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince then,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cI have lived very agreeably. I have\r\nbegun a poem in verses of one syllable. That is rather difficult, but\r\nthe merit in all things consists in the difficulty. The matter is\r\ngallant. I will read you the first canto. It has four hundred lines,\r\nand lasts a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith, my dear Aramis,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who detested verses almost\r\nas much as he did Latin, \xe2\x80\x9cadd to the merit of the difficulty that of\r\nthe brevity, and you are sure that your poem will at least have two\r\nmerits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will see,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it breathes irreproachable\r\npassion. And so, my friends, we return to Paris? Bravo! I am ready. We\r\nare going to rejoin that good fellow, Porthos. So much the better. You\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t think how I have missed him, the great simpleton. To see him so\r\nself-satisfied reconciles me with myself. He would not sell his horse;\r\nnot for a kingdom! I think I can see him now, mounted upon his superb\r\nanimal and seated in his handsome saddle. I am sure he will look like\r\nthe Great Mogul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey made a halt for an hour to refresh their horses. Aramis discharged\r\nhis bill, placed Bazin in the cart with his comrades, and they set\r\nforward to join Porthos.\r\n\r\nThey found him up, less pale than when D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan left him after his\r\nfirst visit, and seated at a table on which, though he was alone, was\r\nspread enough for four persons. This dinner consisted of meats nicely\r\ndressed, choice wines, and superb fruit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, _pardieu!_\xe2\x80\x9d said he, rising, \xe2\x80\x9cyou come in the nick of time,\r\ngentlemen. I was just beginning the soup, and you will dine with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cMousqueton has not caught these bottles\r\nwith his lasso. Besides, here is a piquant _fricandeau_ and a fillet of\r\nbeef.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am recruiting myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cI am recruiting myself.\r\nNothing weakens a man more than these devilish strains. Did you ever\r\nsuffer from a strain, Athos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! Though I remember, in our affair of the Rue F\xc3\xa9rou, I received a\r\nsword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the\r\nsame effect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this dinner was not intended for you alone, Porthos?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cI expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood, who\r\nhave just sent me word they could not come. You will take their places\r\nand I shall not lose by the exchange. _Hol\xc3\xa0_, Mousqueton, seats, and\r\norder double the bottles!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what we are eating here?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, at the end of ten\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pardieu!_\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cfor my part, I am eating veal\r\ngarnished with shrimps and vegetables.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I some lamb chops,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I a plain chicken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are all mistaken, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Athos, gravely; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\neating horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEating what?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorse!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, with a grimace of disgust.\r\n\r\nPorthos alone made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, horse. Are we not eating a horse, Porthos? And perhaps his\r\nsaddle, therewith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, gentlemen, I have kept the harness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are all alike. One would think we had\r\ntipped the wink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could I do?\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cThis horse made my visitors ashamed\r\nof theirs, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to humiliate people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen your duchess is still at the waters?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, my faith, the governor of the\r\nprovince\xe2\x80\x94one of the gentlemen I expected today\xe2\x80\x94seemed to have such a\r\nwish for him, that I gave him to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGave him?\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God, yes, _gave_, that is the word,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cfor the animal\r\nwas worth at least a hundred and fifty louis, and the stingy fellow\r\nwould only give me eighty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout the saddle?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, without the saddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will observe, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Porthos has made the\r\nbest bargain of any of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined, to the\r\nastonishment of poor Porthos; but when he was informed of the cause of\r\ntheir hilarity, he shared it vociferously according to his custom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one comfort, we are all in cash,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, for my part,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cI found Aramis\xe2\x80\x99s Spanish wine so good\r\nthat I sent on a hamper of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the\r\nlackeys. That has weakened my purse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cimagined that I had given almost my last sou to\r\nthe church of Montdidier and the Jesuits of Amiens, with whom I had\r\nmade engagements which I ought to have kept. I have ordered Masses for\r\nmyself, and for you, gentlemen, which will be said, gentlemen, for\r\nwhich I have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think my strain cost me nothing?\xe2\x80\x94without\r\nreckoning Mousqueton\xe2\x80\x99s wound, for which I had to have the surgeon twice\r\na day, and who charged me double on account of that foolish Mousqueton\r\nhaving allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only\r\nshow to an apothecary; so I advised him to try never to get wounded\r\nthere any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, exchanging a smile with D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and Aramis,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad; that is\r\nlike a good master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen all my expenses are paid, I shall have,\r\nat most, thirty crowns left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I about ten pistoles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then it appears that we are the Cr\xc5\x93suses of the society. How\r\nmuch have you left of your hundred pistoles, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf my hundred pistoles? Why, in the first place I gave you fifty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pardieu!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that is true. I recollect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I paid the host six.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a brute of a host! Why did you give him six pistoles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou told me to give them to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true; I am too good-natured. In brief, how much remains?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-five pistoles,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, taking some small change from his pocket, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou? Nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith! So little that it is not worth reckoning with the general\r\nstock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, let us calculate how much we posses in all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPorthos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty crowns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAramis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen pistoles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat makes in all?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour hundred and seventy-five livres,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who reckoned\r\nlike Archimedes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn our arrival in Paris, we shall still have four hundred, besides the\r\nharnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut our troop horses?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the\r\nmasters, for which we will draw lots. With the four hundred livres we\r\nwill make the half of one for one of the unmounted, and then we will\r\ngive the turnings out of our pockets to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who has a steady\r\nhand, and will go and play in the first gaming house we come to.\r\nThere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us dine, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cit is getting cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe friends, at ease with regard to the future, did honor to the\r\nrepast, the remains of which were abandoned to Mousqueton, Bazin,\r\nPlanchet, and Grimaud.\r\n\r\nOn arriving in Paris, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan found a letter from M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville,\r\nwhich informed him that, at his request, the king had promised that he\r\nshould enter the company of the Musketeers.\r\n\r\nAs this was the height of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s worldly ambition\xe2\x80\x94apart, be it\r\nwell understood, from his desire of finding Mme. Bonacieux\xe2\x80\x94he ran, full\r\nof joy, to seek his comrades, whom he had left only half an hour\r\nbefore, but whom he found very sad and deeply preoccupied. They were\r\nassembled in council at the residence of Athos, which always indicated\r\nan event of some gravity. M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville had intimated to them his\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s fixed intention to open the campaign on the first of May, and\r\nthey must immediately prepare their outfits.\r\n\r\nThe four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilderment.\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville never jested in matters relating to discipline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you reckon your outfit will cost?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we can scarcely say. We have made our calculations with Spartan\r\neconomy, and we each require fifteen hundred livres.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour times fifteen makes sixty\xe2\x80\x94six thousand livres,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a thousand livres each\xe2\x80\x94I do\r\nnot speak as a Spartan, but as a procurator\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis word _procurator_ roused Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cStop,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI have an\r\nidea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s something, for I have not the shadow of one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos\r\ncoolly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut as to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, gentlemen, the idea of belonging to\r\n_ours_ has driven him out of his senses. A thousand livres! For my\r\npart, I declare I want two thousand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour times two makes eight,\xe2\x80\x9d then said Aramis; \xe2\x80\x9cit is eight thousand\r\nthat we want to complete our outfits, toward which, it is true, we have\r\nalready the saddles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, waiting till D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who went to thank\r\nMonsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, had shut the door, \xe2\x80\x9cbesides, there is that\r\nbeautiful ring which beams from the finger of our friend. What the\r\ndevil! D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan is too good a comrade to leave his brothers in\r\nembarrassment while he wears the ransom of a king on his finger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIX.\r\nHUNTING FOR THE EQUIPMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\nalthough he, in his quality of Guardsman, would be much more easily\r\nequipped than Messieurs the Musketeers, who were all of high rank; but\r\nour Gascon cadet was, as may have been observed, of a provident and\r\nalmost avaricious character, and with that (explain the contradiction)\r\nso vain as almost to rival Porthos. To this preoccupation of his\r\nvanity, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less\r\nselfish. Notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting Mme. Bonacieux,\r\nhe could obtain no intelligence of her. M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville had spoken of\r\nher to the queen. The queen was ignorant where the mercer\xe2\x80\x99s young wife\r\nwas, but had promised to have her sought for; but this promise was very\r\nvague and did not at all reassure D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\nAthos did not leave his chamber; he made up his mind not to take a\r\nsingle step to equip himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have still fifteen days before us,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to his friends, \xe2\x80\x9cwell,\r\nif at the end of a fortnight I have found nothing, or rather if nothing\r\nhas come to find me, as I, too good a Catholic to kill myself with a\r\npistol bullet, I will seek a good quarrel with four of his Eminence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nGuards or with eight Englishmen, and I will fight until one of them has\r\nkilled me, which, considering the number, cannot fail to happen. It\r\nwill then be said of me that I died for the king; so that I shall have\r\nperformed my duty without the expense of an outfit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him, tossing his\r\nhead and repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall follow up on my idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis, anxious and negligently dressed, said nothing.\r\n\r\nIt may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nThe lackeys on their part, like the coursers of Hippolytus, shared the\r\nsadness of their masters. Mousqueton collected a store of crusts;\r\nBazin, who had always been inclined to devotion, never quit the\r\nchurches; Planchet watched the flight of flies; and Grimaud, whom the\r\ngeneral distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his\r\nmaster, heaved sighs enough to soften the stones.\r\n\r\nThe three friends\xe2\x80\x94for, as we have said, Athos had sworn not to stir a\r\nfoot to equip himself\xe2\x80\x94went out early in the morning, and returned late\r\nat night. They wandered about the streets, looking at the pavement as\r\nif to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind them. They\r\nmight have been supposed to be following tracks, so observant were they\r\nwherever they went. When they met they looked desolately at one\r\nanother, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you found anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, as Porthos had first found an idea, and had thought of it\r\nearnestly afterward, he was the first to act. He was a man of\r\nexecution, this worthy Porthos. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan perceived him one day\r\nwalking toward the church of St. Leu, and followed him instinctively.\r\nHe entered, after having twisted his mustache and elongated his\r\nimperial, which always announced on his part the most triumphant\r\nresolutions. As D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan took some precautions to conceal himself,\r\nPorthos believed he had not been seen. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan entered behind him.\r\nPorthos went and leaned against the side of a pillar. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, still\r\nunperceived, supported himself against the other side.\r\n\r\nThere happened to be a sermon, which made the church very full of\r\npeople. Porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women.\r\nThanks to the cares of Mousqueton, the exterior was far from announcing\r\nthe distress of the interior. His hat was a little napless, his feather\r\nwas a little faded, his gold lace was a little tarnished, his laces\r\nwere a trifle frayed; but in the obscurity of the church these things\r\nwere not seen, and Porthos was still the handsome Porthos.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan observed, on the bench nearest to the pillar against which\r\nPorthos leaned, a sort of ripe beauty, rather yellow and rather dry,\r\nbut erect and haughty under her black hood. The eyes of Porthos were\r\nfurtively cast upon this lady, and then roved about at large over the\r\nnave.\r\n\r\nOn her side the lady, who from time to time blushed, darted with the\r\nrapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant Porthos; and then\r\nimmediately the eyes of Porthos wandered anxiously. It was plain that\r\nthis mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood, for she bit\r\nher lips till they bled, scratched the end of her nose, and could not\r\nsit still in her seat.\r\n\r\nPorthos, seeing this, retwisted his mustache, elongated his imperial a\r\nsecond time, and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near\r\nthe choir, and who not only was a beautiful lady, but still further, no\r\ndoubt, a great lady\xe2\x80\x94for she had behind her a Negro boy who had brought\r\nthe cushion on which she knelt, and a female servant who held the\r\nemblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the\r\nMass.\r\n\r\nThe lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the\r\nlooks of Porthos, and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the\r\nvelvet cushion, the little Negro, and the maid-servant.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Porthos played close. It was almost imperceptible\r\nmotions of his eyes, fingers placed upon the lips, little assassinating\r\nsmiles, which really did assassinate the disdained beauty.\r\n\r\nThen she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cAhem!\xe2\x80\x9d under cover of the _mea culpa_, striking her\r\nbreast so vigorously that everybody, even the lady with the red\r\ncushion, turned round toward her. Porthos paid no attention.\r\nNevertheless, he understood it all, but was deaf.\r\n\r\nThe lady with the red cushion produced a great effect\xe2\x80\x94for she was very\r\nhandsome\xe2\x80\x94upon the lady with the black hood, who saw in her a rival\r\nreally to be dreaded; a great effect upon Porthos, who thought her much\r\nprettier than the lady with the black hood; a great effect upon\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who recognized in her the lady of Meung, of Calais, and of\r\nDover, whom his persecutor, the man with the scar, had saluted by the\r\nname of Milady.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion,\r\ncontinued to watch the proceedings of Porthos, which amused him\r\ngreatly. He guessed that the lady of the black hood was the\r\nprocurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife of the Rue aux Ours, which was the more probable from\r\nthe church of St. Leu being not far from that locality.\r\n\r\nHe guessed, likewise, by induction, that Porthos was taking his revenge\r\nfor the defeat of Chantilly, when the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife had proved so\r\nrefractory with respect to her purse.\r\n\r\nAmid all this, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan remarked also that not one countenance\r\nresponded to the gallantries of Porthos. There were only chimeras and\r\nillusions; but for real love, for true jealousy, is there any reality\r\nexcept illusions and chimeras?\r\n\r\nThe sermon over, the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife advanced toward the holy font.\r\nPorthos went before her, and instead of a finger, dipped his whole hand\r\nin. The procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife smiled, thinking that it was for her Porthos\r\nhad put himself to this trouble; but she was cruelly and promptly\r\nundeceived. When she was only about three steps from him, he turned his\r\nhead round, fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red\r\ncushion, who had risen and was approaching, followed by her black boy\r\nand her woman.\r\n\r\nWhen the lady of the red cushion came close to Porthos, Porthos drew\r\nhis dripping hand from the font. The fair worshipper touched the great\r\nhand of Porthos with her delicate fingers, smiled, made the sign of the\r\ncross, and left the church.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife; she doubted not there was\r\nan intrigue between this lady and Porthos. If she had been a great lady\r\nshe would have fainted; but as she was only a procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, she\r\ncontented herself saying to the Musketeer with concentrated fury, \xe2\x80\x9cEh,\r\nMonsieur Porthos, you don\xe2\x80\x99t offer me any holy water?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos, at the sound of that voice, started like a man awakened from a\r\nsleep of a hundred years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMa-madame!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he; \xe2\x80\x9cis that you? How is your husband, our dear\r\nMonsieur Coquenard? Is he still as stingy as ever? Where can my eyes\r\nhave been not to have seen you during the two hours of the sermon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was within two paces of you, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you did not perceive me because you had no eyes but for the\r\npretty lady to whom you just now gave the holy water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos pretended to be confused. \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have remarked\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have been blind not to have seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is a duchess of my acquaintance whom I have\r\ngreat trouble to meet on account of the jealousy of her husband, and\r\nwho sent me word that she should come today to this poor church, buried\r\nin this vile quarter, solely for the sake of seeing me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Porthos,\xe2\x80\x9d said the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you have the\r\nkindness to offer me your arm for five minutes? I have something to say\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, winking to himself, as a gambler\r\ndoes who laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck.\r\n\r\nAt that moment D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan passed in pursuit of Milady; he cast a\r\npassing glance at Porthos, and beheld this triumphant look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, eh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, reasoning to himself according to the strangely easy\r\nmorality of that gallant period, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is one who will be equipped in\r\ngood time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos, yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\r\nas a bark yields to the rudder, arrived at the cloister St. Magloire\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlittle-frequented passage, enclosed with a turnstile at each end. In\r\nthe daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their\r\ncrusts, and children at play.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Monsieur Porthos,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, when she was\r\nassured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the\r\nlocality could either see or hear her, \xe2\x80\x9cah, Monsieur Porthos, you are a\r\ngreat conqueror, as it appears!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, drawing himself up proudly; \xe2\x80\x9chow so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe signs just now, and the holy water! But that must be a princess,\r\nat least\xe2\x80\x94that lady with her Negro boy and her maid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God! Madame, you are deceived,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cshe is simply a\r\nduchess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that running footman who waited at the door, and that carriage\r\nwith a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage, but with the eye\r\nof a jealous woman, Mme. Coquenard had seen everything.\r\n\r\nPorthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red\r\ncushion a princess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are quite the pet of the ladies, Monsieur Porthos!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed\r\nthe procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may imagine, with the physique with\r\nwhich nature has endowed me, I am not in want of good luck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord, how quickly men forget!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\r\nraising her eyes toward heaven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLess quickly than the women, it seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I,\r\nmadame, I may say I was your victim, when wounded, dying, I was\r\nabandoned by the surgeons. I, the offspring of a noble family, who\r\nplaced reliance upon your friendship\xe2\x80\x94I was near dying of my wounds at\r\nfirst, and of hunger afterward, in a beggarly inn at Chantilly, without\r\nyou ever deigning once to reply to the burning letters I addressed to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Monsieur Porthos,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who began to\r\nfeel that, to judge by the conduct of the great ladies of the time, she\r\nwas wrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, who had sacrificed for you the Baronne de\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Comtesse de\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Porthos, be generous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, madame, and I will not finish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it was my husband who would not hear of lending.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Coquenard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cremember the first letter you wrote\r\nme, and which I preserve engraved in my memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife uttered a groan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sum you required me to borrow was rather\r\nlarge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Coquenard, I gave you the preference. I had but to write to the\r\nDuchesse\xe2\x80\x94but I won\xe2\x80\x99t repeat her name, for I am incapable of\r\ncompromising a woman; but this I know, that I had but to write to her\r\nand she would have sent me fifteen hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife shed a tear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Porthos,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI can assure you that you have severely\r\npunished me; and if in the time to come you should find yourself in a\r\nsimilar situation, you have but to apply to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFie, madame, fie!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, as if disgusted. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us not talk\r\nabout money, if you please; it is humiliating.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you no longer love me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, slowly and\r\nsadly.\r\n\r\nPorthos maintained a majestic silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is the only reply you make? Alas, I understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink of the offense you have committed toward me, madame! It remains\r\n_here!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, placing his hand on his heart, and pressing it\r\nstrongly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will repair it, indeed I will, my dear Porthos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, what did I ask of you?\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Porthos, with a movement of\r\nthe shoulders full of good fellowship. \xe2\x80\x9cA loan, nothing more! After\r\nall, I am not an unreasonable man. I know you are not rich, Madame\r\nCoquenard, and that your husband is obliged to bleed his poor clients\r\nto squeeze a few paltry crowns from them. Oh! If you were a duchess, a\r\nmarchioness, or a countess, it would be quite a different thing; it\r\nwould be unpardonable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife was piqued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease to know, Monsieur Porthos,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my strongbox, the\r\nstrongbox of a procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife though it may be, is better filled\r\nthan those of your affected minxes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat doubles the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, disengaging his arm from that\r\nof the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife; \xe2\x80\x9cfor if you are rich, Madame Coquenard, then\r\nthere is no excuse for your refusal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I said rich,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who saw that she had\r\ngone too far, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must not take the word literally. I am not precisely\r\nrich, though I am pretty well off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9clet us say no more upon the subject, I\r\nbeg of you. You have misunderstood me, all sympathy is extinct between\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIngrate that you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I advise you to complain!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegone, then, to your beautiful duchess; I will detain you no longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she is not to be despised, in my opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Monsieur Porthos, once more, and this is the last! Do you love me\r\nstill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, in the most melancholy tone he could\r\nassume, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we are about to enter upon a campaign\xe2\x80\x94a campaign, in\r\nwhich my presentiments tell me I shall be killed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk of such things!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, bursting\r\ninto tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething whispers me so,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Porthos, becoming more and more\r\nmelancholy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather say that you have a new love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so; I speak frankly to you. No object affects me; and I even feel\r\nhere, at the bottom of my heart, something which speaks for you. But in\r\nfifteen days, as you know, or as you do not know, this fatal campaign\r\nis to open. I shall be fearfully preoccupied with my outfit. Then I\r\nmust make a journey to see my family, in the lower part of Brittany, to\r\nobtain the sum necessary for my departure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos observed a last struggle between love and avarice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe duchess whom you saw at the church has\r\nestates near to those of my family, we mean to make the journey\r\ntogether. Journeys, you know, appear much shorter when we travel two in\r\ncompany.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you no friends in Paris, then, Monsieur Porthos?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nprocurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I had,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, resuming his melancholy air; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nhave been taught my mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have some!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, in a transport that\r\nsurprised even herself. \xe2\x80\x9cCome to our house tomorrow. You are the son of\r\nmy aunt, consequently my cousin; you come from Noyon, in Picardy; you\r\nhave several lawsuits and no attorney. Can you recollect all that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome at dinnertime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd be upon your guard before my husband, who is rather shrewd,\r\nnotwithstanding his seventy-six years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeventy-six years! _Peste!_ That\xe2\x80\x99s a fine age!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great age, you mean, Monsieur Porthos. Yes, the poor man may be\r\nexpected to leave me a widow, any hour,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she, throwing a\r\nsignificant glance at Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cFortunately, by our marriage contract,\r\nthe survivor takes everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a woman of precaution, I see, my dear Madame Coquenard,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPorthos, squeezing the hand of the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife tenderly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are then reconciled, dear Monsieur Porthos?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, simpering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor life,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Porthos, in the same manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill we meet again, then, dear traitor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill we meet again, my forgetful charmer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow, my angel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow, flame of my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXX.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99ARTAGNAN AND THE ENGLISHMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan followed Milady without being perceived by her. He saw her\r\nget into her carriage, and heard her order the coachman to drive to St.\r\nGermain.\r\n\r\nIt was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two\r\npowerful horses. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan therefore returned to the Rue F\xc3\xa9rou.\r\n\r\nIn the Rue de Seine he met Planchet, who had stopped before the house\r\nof a pastry cook, and was contemplating with ecstasy a cake of the most\r\nappetizing appearance.\r\n\r\nHe ordered him to go and saddle two horses in M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstables\xe2\x80\x94one for himself, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and one for Planchet\xe2\x80\x94and bring\r\nthem to Athos\xe2\x80\x99s place. Once for all, Tr\xc3\xa9ville had placed his stable at\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s service.\r\n\r\nPlanchet proceeded toward the Rue du Colombier, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan toward\r\nthe Rue F\xc3\xa9rou. Athos was at home, emptying sadly a bottle of the famous\r\nSpanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into\r\nPicardy. He made a sign for Grimaud to bring a glass for D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\nand Grimaud obeyed as usual.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan related to Athos all that had passed at the church between\r\nPorthos and the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and how their comrade was probably\r\nby that time in a fair way to be equipped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos to this recital, \xe2\x80\x9cI am quite at my ease; it\r\nwill not be women that will defray the expense of my outfit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHandsome, well-bred, noble lord as you are, my dear Athos, neither\r\nprincesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicitations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow young this D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, shrugging his shoulders;\r\nand he made a sign to Grimaud to bring another bottle.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Planchet put his head modestly in at the half-open door,\r\nand told his master that the horses were ready.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat horses?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo horses that Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville lends me at my pleasure, and with\r\nwhich I am now going to take a ride to St. Germain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and what are you going to do at St. Germain?\xe2\x80\x9d then demanded\r\nAthos.\r\n\r\nThen D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan described the meeting which he had at the church, and\r\nhow he had found that lady who, with the seigneur in the black cloak\r\nand with the scar near his temple, filled his mind constantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, you are in love with this lady as you were with Madame\r\nBonacieux,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, shrugging his shoulders contemptuously, as if\r\nhe pitied human weakness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? not at all!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cI am only curious to unravel the\r\nmystery to which she is attached. I do not know why, but I imagine that\r\nthis woman, wholly unknown to me as she is, and wholly unknown to her\r\nas I am, has an influence over my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps you are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know a woman that\r\nis worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once lost. Madame\r\nBonacieux is lost; so much the worse for her if she is found.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Athos, no, you are mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cI love my poor\r\nConstance more than ever, and if I knew the place in which she is, were\r\nit at the end of the world, I would go to free her from the hands of\r\nher enemies; but I am ignorant. All my researches have been useless.\r\nWhat is to be said? I must divert my attention!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmuse yourself with Milady, my dear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; I wish you may with\r\nall my heart, if that will amuse you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me, Athos,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cInstead of shutting yourself up\r\nhere as if you were under arrest, get on horseback and come and take a\r\nride with me to St. Germain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cI ride horses when I have any; when I\r\nhave none, I go afoot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, smiling at the misanthropy of Athos, which\r\nfrom any other person would have offended him, \xe2\x80\x9cI ride what I can get;\r\nI am not so proud as you. So _au revoir_, dear Athos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Au revoir_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Musketeer, making a sign to Grimaud to uncork\r\nthe bottle he had just brought.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and Planchet mounted, and took the road to St. Germain.\r\n\r\nAll along the road, what Athos had said respecting Mme. Bonacieux\r\nrecurred to the mind of the young man. Although D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was not of a\r\nvery sentimental character, the mercer\xe2\x80\x99s pretty wife had made a real\r\nimpression upon his heart. As he said, he was ready to go to the end of\r\nthe world to seek her; but the world, being round, has many ends, so\r\nthat he did not know which way to turn. Meantime, he was going to try\r\nto find out Milady. Milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak;\r\ntherefore she knew him. Now, in the opinion of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, it was\r\ncertainly the man in the black cloak who had carried off Mme. Bonacieux\r\nthe second time, as he had carried her off the first. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan then\r\nonly half-lied, which is lying but little, when he said that by going\r\nin search of Milady he at the same time went in search of Constance.\r\n\r\nThinking of all this, and from time to time giving a touch of the spur\r\nto his horse, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan completed his short journey, and arrived at\r\nSt. Germain. He had just passed by the pavilion in which ten years\r\nlater Louis XIV. was born. He rode up a very quiet street, looking to\r\nthe right and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his\r\nbeautiful Englishwoman, when from the ground floor of a pretty house,\r\nwhich, according to the fashion of the time, had no window toward the\r\nstreet, he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted.\r\nThis person walked along the terrace, which was ornamented with\r\nflowers. Planchet recognized him first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, addressing D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember\r\nthat face which is blinking yonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet I am certain it is not the first time I\r\nhave seen that visage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Parbleu_, I believe it is not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it is poor\r\nLubin, the lackey of the Comte de Wardes\xe2\x80\x94he whom you took such good\r\ncare of a month ago at Calais, on the road to the governor\xe2\x80\x99s country\r\nhouse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cI know him now. Do you think he would\r\nrecollect you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith, monsieur, he was in such trouble that I doubt if he can have\r\nretained a very clear recollection of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go and talk with the boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cand make out if you\r\ncan from his conversation whether his master is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPlanchet dismounted and went straight up to Lubin, who did not at all\r\nremember him, and the two lackeys began to chat with the best\r\nunderstanding possible; while D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan turned the two horses into a\r\nlane, went round the house, and came back to watch the conference from\r\nbehind a hedge of filberts.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an instant\xe2\x80\x99s observation he heard the noise of a vehicle,\r\nand saw Milady\xe2\x80\x99s carriage stop opposite to him. He could not be\r\nmistaken; Milady was in it. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan leaned upon the neck of his\r\nhorse, in order that he might see without being seen.\r\n\r\nMilady put her charming blond head out at the window, and gave her\r\norders to her maid.\r\n\r\nThe latter\xe2\x80\x94a pretty girl of about twenty or twenty-two years, active\r\nand lively, the true _soubrette_ of a great lady\xe2\x80\x94jumped from the step\r\nupon which, according to the custom of the time, she was seated, and\r\ntook her way toward the terrace upon which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had perceived\r\nLubin.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan followed the _soubrette_ with his eyes, and saw her go\r\ntoward the terrace; but it happened that someone in the house called\r\nLubin, so that Planchet remained alone, looking in all directions for\r\nthe road where D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe maid approached Planchet, whom she took for Lubin, and holding out\r\na little billet to him said, \xe2\x80\x9cFor your master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my master?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Planchet, astonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and important. Take it quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon she ran toward the carriage, which had turned round toward\r\nthe way it came, jumped upon the step, and the carriage drove off.\r\n\r\nPlanchet turned and returned the billet. Then, accustomed to passive\r\nobedience, he jumped down from the terrace, ran toward the lane, and at\r\nthe end of twenty paces met D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who, having seen all, was\r\ncoming to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet, presenting the billet to the young\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9care you sure of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pardieu_, monsieur, I can\xe2\x80\x99t be more sure. The _soubrette_ said, \xe2\x80\x98For\r\nyour master.\xe2\x80\x99 I have no other master but you; so\xe2\x80\x94a pretty little lass,\r\nmy faith, is that _soubrette!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan opened the letter, and read these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess\r\nwishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest?\r\nTomorrow, at the H\xc3\xb4tel Field of the Cloth of Gold, a lackey in black\r\nand red will wait for your reply.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is rather warm; it appears that Milady and\r\nI are anxious about the health of the same person. Well, Planchet, how\r\nis the good Monsieur de Wardes? He is not dead, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monsieur, he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds in\r\nhis body; for you, without question, inflicted four upon the dear\r\ngentleman, and he is still very weak, having lost almost all his blood.\r\nAs I said, monsieur, Lubin did not know me, and told me our adventure\r\nfrom one end to the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, Planchet! you are the king of lackeys. Now jump onto your\r\nhorse, and let us overtake the carriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis did not take long. At the end of five minutes they perceived the\r\ncarriage drawn up by the roadside; a cavalier, richly dressed, was\r\nclose to the door.\r\n\r\nThe conversation between Milady and the cavalier was so animated that\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but\r\nthe pretty _soubrette_ perceiving his presence.\r\n\r\nThe conversation took place in English\xe2\x80\x94a language which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\ncould not understand; but by the accent the young man plainly saw that\r\nthe beautiful Englishwoman was in a great rage. She terminated it by an\r\naction which left no doubt as to the nature of this conversation; this\r\nwas a blow with her fan, applied with such force that the little\r\nfeminine weapon flew into a thousand pieces.\r\n\r\nThe cavalier laughed aloud, which appeared to exasperate Milady still\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan thought this was the moment to interfere. He approached the\r\nother door, and taking off his hat respectfully, said, \xe2\x80\x9cMadame, will\r\nyou permit me to offer you my services? It appears to me that this\r\ncavalier has made you very angry. Speak one word, madame, and I take\r\nupon myself to punish him for his want of courtesy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the first word Milady turned, looking at the young man with\r\nastonishment; and when he had finished, she said in very good French,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, I should with great confidence place myself under your\r\nprotection if the person with whom I quarrel were not my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, excuse me, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be aware that I was\r\nignorant of that, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that stupid fellow troubling himself about?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\ncavalier whom Milady had designated as her brother, stooping down to\r\nthe height of the coach window. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy does not he go about his\r\nbusiness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStupid fellow yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, stooping in his turn on the\r\nneck of his horse, and answering on his side through the carriage\r\nwindow. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not go on because it pleases me to stop here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cavalier addressed some words in English to his sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI speak to you in French,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cbe kind enough, then, to\r\nreply to me in the same language. You are Madame\xe2\x80\x99s brother, I learn\xe2\x80\x94be\r\nit so; but fortunately you are not mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt might be thought that Milady, timid as women are in general, would\r\nhave interposed in this commencement of mutual provocations in order to\r\nprevent the quarrel from going too far; but on the contrary, she threw\r\nherself back in her carriage, and called out coolly to the coachman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on\xe2\x80\x94home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pretty _soubrette_ cast an anxious glance at D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, whose good\r\nlooks seemed to have made an impression on her.\r\n\r\nThe carriage went on, and left the two men facing each other; no\r\nmaterial obstacle separated them.\r\n\r\nThe cavalier made a movement as if to follow the carriage; but\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, whose anger, already excited, was much increased by\r\nrecognizing in him the Englishman of Amiens who had won his horse and\r\nhad been very near winning his diamond of Athos, caught at his bridle\r\nand stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou appear to be more stupid than I am, for\r\nyou forget there is a little quarrel to arrange between us two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Englishman, \xe2\x80\x9cis it you, my master? It seems you must\r\nalways be playing some game or other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and that reminds me that I have a revenge to take. We will see,\r\nmy dear monsieur, if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a\r\ndice box.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see plainly that I have no sword,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Englishman. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nwish to play the braggart with an unarmed man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you have a sword at home; but at all events, I have two, and if\r\nyou like, I will throw with you for one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeedless,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Englishman; \xe2\x80\x9cI am well furnished with such\r\nplaythings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, my worthy gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cpick out the\r\nlongest, and come and show it to me this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, if you please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehind the Luxembourg; that\xe2\x80\x99s a charming spot for such amusements as\r\nthe one I propose to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do; I will be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_A propos_, you have probably one or two friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have three, who would be honored by joining in the sport with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree? Marvelous! That falls out oddly! Three is just my number!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Englishman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, a Gascon gentleman, serving in the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMusketeers. And you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Lord de Winter, Baron Sheffield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I am your servant, Monsieur Baron,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthough you have names rather difficult to recollect.\xe2\x80\x9d And touching his\r\nhorse with the spur, he cantered back to Paris. As he was accustomed to\r\ndo in all cases of any consequence, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan went straight to the\r\nresidence of Athos.\r\n\r\nHe found Athos reclining upon a large sofa, where he was waiting, as he\r\nsaid, for his outfit to come and find him. He related to Athos all that\r\nhad passed, except the letter to M. de Wardes.\r\n\r\nAthos was delighted to find he was going to fight an Englishman. We\r\nmight say that was his dream.\r\n\r\nThey immediately sent their lackeys for Porthos and Aramis, and on\r\ntheir arrival made them acquainted with the situation.\r\n\r\nPorthos drew his sword from the scabbard, and made passes at the wall,\r\nspringing back from time to time, and making contortions like a dancer.\r\n\r\nAramis, who was constantly at work at his poem, shut himself up in\r\nAthos\xe2\x80\x99s closet, and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of\r\ndrawing swords.\r\n\r\nAthos, by signs, desired Grimaud to bring another bottle of wine.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan, of which we\r\nshall hereafter see the execution, and which promised him some\r\nagreeable adventure, as might be seen by the smiles which from time to\r\ntime passed over his countenance, whose thoughtfulness they animated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXI.\r\nENGLISH AND FRENCH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hour having come, they went with their four lackeys to a spot\r\nbehind the Luxembourg given up to the feeding of goats. Athos threw a\r\npiece of money to the goatkeeper to withdraw. The lackeys were ordered\r\nto act as sentinels.\r\n\r\nA silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure, entered, and\r\njoined the Musketeers. Then, according to foreign custom, the\r\npresentations took place.\r\n\r\nThe Englishmen were all men of rank; consequently the odd names of\r\ntheir adversaries were for them not only a matter of surprise, but of\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut after all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord de Winter, when the three friends had been\r\nnamed, \xe2\x80\x9cwe do not know who you are. We cannot fight with such names;\r\nthey are names of shepherds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore your lordship may suppose they are only assumed names,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nthe Englishman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou played very willingly with us without knowing our names,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAthos, \xe2\x80\x9cby the same token that you won our horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true, but we then only risked our pistoles; this time we risk\r\nour blood. One plays with anybody; but one fights only with equals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is but just,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, and he took aside the one of the\r\nfour Englishmen with whom he was to fight, and communicated his name in\r\na low voice.\r\n\r\nPorthos and Aramis did the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes that satisfy you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos to his adversary. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you find me\r\nof sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Englishman, bowing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! now shall I tell you something?\xe2\x80\x9d added Athos, coolly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Englishman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not\r\nrequired me to make myself known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am believed to be dead, and have reasons for wishing nobody\r\nto know I am living; so that I shall be obliged to kill you to prevent\r\nmy secret from roaming over the fields.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishman looked at Athos, believing that he jested, but Athos did\r\nnot jest the least in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, addressing at the same time his companions and\r\ntheir adversaries, \xe2\x80\x9care we ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Englishmen and the Frenchmen, as with one voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn guard, then!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos.\r\n\r\nImmediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun, and\r\nthe combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nAthos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been\r\npracticing in a fencing school.\r\n\r\nPorthos, abated, no doubt, of his too-great confidence by his adventure\r\nof Chantilly, played with skill and prudence. Aramis, who had the third\r\ncanto of his poem to finish, behaved like a man in haste.\r\n\r\nAthos killed his adversary first. He hit him but once, but as he had\r\nforetold, that hit was a mortal one; the sword pierced his heart.\r\n\r\nSecond, Porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his\r\nthigh, As the Englishman, without making any further resistance, then\r\nsurrendered his sword, Porthos took him up in his arms and bore him to\r\nhis carriage.\r\n\r\nAramis pushed his so vigorously that after going back fifty paces, the\r\nman ended by fairly taking to his heels, and disappeared amid the\r\nhooting of the lackeys.\r\n\r\nAs to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, he fought purely and simply on the defensive; and\r\nwhen he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued, with a vigorous side\r\nthrust sent his sword flying. The baron, finding himself disarmed, took\r\ntwo or three steps back, but in this movement his foot slipped and he\r\nfell backward.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was over him at a bound, and said to the Englishman,\r\npointing his sword to his throat, \xe2\x80\x9cI could kill you, my Lord, you are\r\ncompletely in my hands; but I spare your life for the sake of your\r\nsister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was at the height of joy; he had realized the plan he had\r\nimagined beforehand, whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted\r\nupon his face.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman, delighted at having to do with a gentleman of such a\r\nkind disposition, pressed D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan in his arms, and paid a thousand\r\ncompliments to the three Musketeers, and as Porthos\xe2\x80\x99s adversary was\r\nalready installed in the carriage, and as Aramis\xe2\x80\x99s had taken to his\r\nheels, they had nothing to think about but the dead.\r\n\r\nAs Porthos and Aramis were undressing him, in the hope of finding his\r\nwound not mortal, a large purse dropped from his clothes. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\npicked it up and offered it to Lord de Winter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil would you have me do with that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Englishman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can restore it to his family,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis family will care much about such a trifle as that! His family will\r\ninherit fifteen thousand louis a year from him. Keep the purse for your\r\nlackeys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan put the purse into his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, my young friend, for you will permit me, I hope, to give you\r\nthat name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord de Winter, \xe2\x80\x9con this very evening, if agreeable to\r\nyou, I will present you to my sister, Milady Clarik, for I am desirous\r\nthat she should take you into her good graces; and as she is not in bad\r\nodor at court, she may perhaps on some future day speak a word that\r\nwill not prove useless to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan blushed with pleasure, and bowed a sign of assent.\r\n\r\nAt this time Athos came up to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean to do with that purse?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I meant to pass it over to you, my dear Athos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe! why to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you killed him! They are the spoils of victory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, the heir of an enemy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cfor whom, then, do you take\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the custom in war,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy should it not be the\r\ncustom in a duel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven on the field of battle, I have never done that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos shrugged his shoulders; Aramis by a movement of his lips\r\nendorsed Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9clet us give the money to the lackeys, as Lord\r\nde Winter desired us to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9clet us give the money to the lackeys\xe2\x80\x94not to our\r\nlackeys, but to the lackeys of the Englishmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos took the purse, and threw it into the hand of the coachman. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\nyou and your comrades.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even\r\nPorthos; and this French generosity, repeated by Lord de Winter and his\r\nfriend, was highly applauded, except by MM. Grimaud, Bazin, Mousqueton\r\nand Planchet.\r\n\r\nLord de Winter, on quitting D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, gave him his sister\xe2\x80\x99s address.\r\nShe lived in the Place Royale\xe2\x80\x94then the fashionable quarter\xe2\x80\x94at Number 6,\r\nand he undertook to call and take D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan with him in order to\r\nintroduce him. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan appointed eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock at Athos\xe2\x80\x99s residence.\r\n\r\nThis introduction to Milady Clarik occupied the head of our Gascon\r\ngreatly. He remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto\r\nbeen mixed up in his destiny. According to his conviction, she was some\r\ncreature of the cardinal, and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn\r\ntoward her by one of those sentiments for which we cannot account. His\r\nonly fear was that Milady would recognize in him the man of Meung and\r\nof Dover. Then she knew that he was one of the friends of M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville, and consequently, that he belonged body and soul to the king;\r\nwhich would make him lose a part of his advantage, since when known to\r\nMilady as he knew her, he played only an equal game with her. As to the\r\ncommencement of an intrigue between her and M. de Wardes, our\r\npresumptuous hero gave but little heed to that, although the marquis\r\nwas young, handsome, rich, and high in the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s favor. It is not\r\nfor nothing we are but twenty years old, above all if we were born at\r\nTarbes.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan began by making his most splendid toilet, then returned to\r\nAthos\xe2\x80\x99s, and according to custom, related everything to him. Athos\r\nlistened to his projects, then shook his head, and recommended prudence\r\nto him with a shade of bitterness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have just lost one woman, whom you call good,\r\ncharming, perfect; and here you are, running headlong after another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan felt the truth of this reproach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI loved Madame Bonacieux with my heart, while I only love Milady with\r\nmy head,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIn getting introduced to her, my principal object\r\nis to ascertain what part she plays at court.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe part she plays, _pardieu!_ It is not difficult to divine that,\r\nafter all you have told me. She is some emissary of the cardinal; a\r\nwoman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your\r\nhead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil! my dear Athos, you view things on the dark side, methinks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, I mistrust women. Can it be otherwise? I bought my\r\nexperience dearly\xe2\x80\x94particularly fair women. Milady is fair, you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has the most beautiful light hair imaginable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my poor D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me! I want to be enlightened on a subject; then, when I\r\nshall have learned what I desire to know, I will withdraw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe enlightened!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, phlegmatically.\r\n\r\nLord de Winter arrived at the appointed time; but Athos, being warned\r\nof his coming, went into the other chamber. He therefore found\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan alone, and as it was nearly eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock he took the young\r\nman with him.\r\n\r\nAn elegant carriage waited below, and as it was drawn by two excellent\r\nhorses, they were soon at the Place Royale.\r\n\r\nMilady Clarik received D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan ceremoniously. Her h\xc3\xb4tel was\r\nremarkably sumptuous, and while the most part of the English had quit,\r\nor were about to quit, France on account of the war, Milady had just\r\nbeen laying out much money upon her residence; which proved that the\r\ngeneral measure which drove the English from France did not affect her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord de Winter, presenting D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to his sister, \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nyoung gentleman who has held my life in his hands, and who has not\r\nabused his advantage, although we have been twice enemies, although it\r\nwas I who insulted him, and although I am an Englishman. Thank him,\r\nthen, madame, if you have any affection for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady frowned slightly; a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow,\r\nand so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man, who\r\nsaw and observed this triple shade, almost shuddered at it.\r\n\r\nThe brother did not perceive this; he had turned round to play with\r\nMilady\xe2\x80\x99s favorite monkey, which had pulled him by the doublet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are welcome, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, in a voice whose singular\r\nsweetness contrasted with the symptoms of ill-humor which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nhad just remarked; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have today acquired eternal rights to my\r\ngratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Englishman then turned round and described the combat without\r\nomitting a single detail. Milady listened with the greatest attention,\r\nand yet it was easily to be perceived, whatever effort she made to\r\nconceal her impressions, that this recital was not agreeable to her.\r\nThe blood rose to her head, and her little foot worked with impatience\r\nbeneath her robe.\r\n\r\nLord de Winter perceived nothing of this. When he had finished, he went\r\nto a table upon which was a salver with Spanish wine and glasses. He\r\nfilled two glasses, and by a sign invited D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to drink.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an Englishman to\r\nrefuse to pledge him. He therefore drew near to the table and took the\r\nsecond glass. He did not, however, lose sight of Milady, and in a\r\nmirror he perceived the change that came over her face. Now that she\r\nbelieved herself to be no longer observed, a sentiment resembling\r\nferocity animated her countenance. She bit her handkerchief with her\r\nbeautiful teeth.\r\n\r\nThat pretty little _soubrette_ whom D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had already observed\r\nthen came in. She spoke some words to Lord de Winter in English, who\r\nthereupon requested D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s permission to retire, excusing himself\r\non account of the urgency of the business that had called him away, and\r\ncharging his sister to obtain his pardon.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with Lord de Winter, and then\r\nreturned to Milady. Her countenance, with surprising mobility, had\r\nrecovered its gracious expression; but some little red spots on her\r\nhandkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood\r\ncame. Those lips were magnificent; they might be said to be of coral.\r\n\r\nThe conversation took a cheerful turn. Milady appeared to have entirely\r\nrecovered. She told D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan that Lord de Winter was her\r\nbrother-in-law, and not her brother. She had married a younger brother\r\nof the family, who had left her a widow with one child. This child was\r\nthe only heir to Lord de Winter, if Lord de Winter did not marry. All\r\nthis showed D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan that there was a veil which concealed something;\r\nbut he could not yet see under this veil.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, after a half hour\xe2\x80\x99s conversation D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was\r\nconvinced that Milady was his compatriot; she spoke French with an\r\nelegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of\r\ndevotion. To all the simple things which escaped our Gascon, Milady\r\nreplied with a smile of kindness. The hour came for him to retire.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan took leave of Milady, and left the saloon the happiest of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nOn the staircase he met the pretty _soubrette_, who brushed gently\r\nagainst him as she passed, and then, blushing to the eyes, asked his\r\npardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was\r\ngranted instantly.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan came again on the morrow, and was still better received than\r\non the evening before. Lord de Winter was not at home; and it was\r\nMilady who this time did all the honors of the evening. She appeared to\r\ntake a great interest in him, asked him whence he came, who were his\r\nfriends, and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself\r\nto the cardinal.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who, as we have said, was exceedingly prudent for a young\r\nman of twenty, then remembered his suspicions regarding Milady. He\r\nlaunched into a eulogy of his Eminence, and said that he should not\r\nhave failed to enter into the Guards of the cardinal instead of the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s Guards if he had happened to know M. de Cavois instead of M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville.\r\n\r\nMilady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation,\r\nand asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had\r\never been in England.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan replied that he had been sent thither by M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville to\r\ntreat for a supply of horses, and that he had brought back four as\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nMilady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips;\r\nshe had to deal with a Gascon who played close.\r\n\r\nAt the same hour as on the preceding evening, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan retired. In\r\nthe corridor he again met the pretty Kitty; that was the name of the\r\n_soubrette_. She looked at him with an expression of kindness which it\r\nwas impossible to mistake; but D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was so preoccupied by the\r\nmistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but her.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that, and each\r\nday Milady gave him a more gracious reception.\r\n\r\nEvery evening, either in the antechamber, the corridor, or on the\r\nstairs, he met the pretty _soubrette_. But, as we have said, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\npaid no attention to this persistence of poor Kitty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXII.\r\nA PROCURATOR\xe2\x80\x99S DINNER\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever brilliant had been the part played by Porthos in the duel, it\r\nhad not made him forget the dinner of the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow he received the last touches of Mousqueton\xe2\x80\x99s brush for an\r\nhour, and took his way toward the Rue aux Ours with the steps of a man\r\nwho was doubly in favor with fortune.\r\n\r\nHis heart beat, but not like D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s with a young and impatient\r\nlove. No; a more material interest stirred his blood. He was about at\r\nlast to pass that mysterious threshold, to climb those unknown stairs\r\nby which, one by one, the old crowns of M. Coquenard had ascended. He\r\nwas about to see in reality a certain coffer of which he had twenty\r\ntimes beheld the image in his dreams\xe2\x80\x94a coffer long and deep, locked,\r\nbolted, fastened in the wall; a coffer of which he had so often heard,\r\nand which the hands\xe2\x80\x94a little wrinkled, it is true, but still not\r\nwithout elegance\xe2\x80\x94of the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife were about to open to his\r\nadmiring looks.\r\n\r\nAnd then he\xe2\x80\x94a wanderer on the earth, a man without fortune, a man\r\nwithout family, a soldier accustomed to inns, cabarets, taverns, and\r\nrestaurants, a lover of wine forced to depend upon chance treats\xe2\x80\x94was\r\nabout to partake of family meals, to enjoy the pleasures of a\r\ncomfortable establishment, and to give himself up to those little\r\nattentions which \xe2\x80\x9cthe harder one is, the more they please,\xe2\x80\x9d as old\r\nsoldiers say.\r\n\r\nTo come in the capacity of a cousin, and seat himself every day at a\r\ngood table; to smooth the yellow, wrinkled brow of the old procurator;\r\nto pluck the clerks a little by teaching them _bassette_, _passe-dix_,\r\nand _lansquenet_, in their utmost nicety, and winning from them, by way\r\nof fee for the lesson he would give them in an hour, their savings of a\r\nmonth\xe2\x80\x94all this was enormously delightful to Porthos.\r\n\r\nThe Musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed,\r\nand which indeed have survived them, of the procurators of the\r\nperiod\xe2\x80\x94meanness, stinginess, fasts; but as, after all, excepting some\r\nfew acts of economy which Porthos had always found very unseasonable,\r\nthe procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife had been tolerably liberal\xe2\x80\x94that is, be it\r\nunderstood, for a procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x94he hoped to see a household of a\r\nhighly comfortable kind.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, at the very door the Musketeer began to entertain some doubts.\r\nThe approach was not such as to prepossess people\xe2\x80\x94an ill-smelling, dark\r\npassage, a staircase half-lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer\r\nfrom a neighboring yard; on the first floor a low door studded with\r\nenormous nails, like the principal gate of the Grand Ch\xc3\xa2telet.\r\n\r\nPorthos knocked with his hand. A tall, pale clerk, his face shaded by a\r\nforest of virgin hair, opened the door, and bowed with the air of a man\r\nforced at once to respect in another lofty stature, which indicated\r\nstrength, the military dress, which indicated rank, and a ruddy\r\ncountenance, which indicated familiarity with good living.\r\n\r\nA shorter clerk came behind the first, a taller clerk behind the\r\nsecond, a stripling of a dozen years rising behind the third. In all,\r\nthree clerks and a half, which, for the time, argued a very extensive\r\nclientage.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Musketeer was not expected before one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the\r\nprocurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife had been on the watch ever since midday, reckoning\r\nthat the heart, or perhaps the stomach, of her lover would bring him\r\nbefore his time.\r\n\r\nMme. Coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same\r\nmoment her guest entered from the stairs, and the appearance of the\r\nworthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment. The clerks\r\nsurveyed him with great curiosity, and he, not knowing well what to say\r\nto this ascending and descending scale, remained tongue-tied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my cousin!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in, come in,\r\nMonsieur Porthos!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe name of Porthos produced its effect upon the clerks, who began to\r\nlaugh; but Porthos turned sharply round, and every countenance quickly\r\nrecovered its gravity.\r\n\r\nThey reached the office of the procurator after having passed through\r\nthe antechamber in which the clerks were, and the study in which they\r\nought to have been. This last apartment was a sort of dark room,\r\nlittered with papers. On quitting the study they left the kitchen on\r\nthe right, and entered the reception room.\r\n\r\nAll these rooms, which communicated with one another, did not inspire\r\nPorthos favorably. Words might be heard at a distance through all these\r\nopen doors. Then, while passing, he had cast a rapid, investigating\r\nglance into the kitchen; and he was obliged to confess to himself, to\r\nthe shame of the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife and his own regret, that he did not\r\nsee that fire, that animation, that bustle, which when a good repast is\r\non foot prevails generally in that sanctuary of good living.\r\n\r\nThe procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit, as he\r\nexpressed no surprise at the sight of Porthos, who advanced toward him\r\nwith a sufficiently easy air, and saluted him courteously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are cousins, it appears, Monsieur Porthos?\xe2\x80\x9d said the procurator,\r\nrising, yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane chair.\r\n\r\nThe old man, wrapped in a large black doublet, in which the whole of\r\nhis slender body was concealed, was brisk and dry. His little gray eyes\r\nshone like carbuncles, and appeared, with his grinning mouth, to be the\r\nonly part of his face in which life survived. Unfortunately the legs\r\nbegan to refuse their service to this bony machine. During the last\r\nfive or six months that this weakness had been felt, the worthy\r\nprocurator had nearly become the slave of his wife.\r\n\r\nThe cousin was received with resignation, that was all. M. Coquenard,\r\nfirm upon his legs, would have declined all relationship with M.\r\nPorthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur, we are cousins,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, without being\r\ndisconcerted, as he had never reckoned upon being received\r\nenthusiastically by the husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the female side, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d said the procurator, maliciously.\r\n\r\nPorthos did not feel the ridicule of this, and took it for a piece of\r\nsimplicity, at which he laughed in his large mustache. Mme. Coquenard,\r\nwho knew that a simple-minded procurator was a very rare variety in the\r\nspecies, smiled a little, and colored a great deal.\r\n\r\nM. Coquenard had, since the arrival of Porthos, frequently cast his\r\neyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his\r\noak desk. Porthos comprehended that this chest, although it did not\r\ncorrespond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams, must be\r\nthe blessed coffer, and he congratulated himself that the reality was\r\nseveral feet higher than the dream.\r\n\r\nM. Coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further;\r\nbut withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon\r\nPorthos, he contented himself with saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur our cousin will do\r\nus the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the\r\ncampaign, will he not, Madame Coquenard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time Porthos received the blow right in his stomach, and felt it.\r\nIt appeared likewise that Mme. Coquenard was not less affected by it on\r\nher part, for she added, \xe2\x80\x9cMy cousin will not return if he finds that we\r\ndo not treat him kindly; but otherwise he has so little time to pass in\r\nParis, and consequently to spare to us, that we must entreat him to\r\ngive us every instant he can call his own previous to his departure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my legs, my poor legs! where are you?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Coquenard, and he\r\ntried to smile.\r\n\r\nThis succor, which came to Porthos at the moment in which he was\r\nattacked in his gastronomic hopes, inspired much gratitude in the\r\nMusketeer toward the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\nThe hour of dinner soon arrived. They passed into the eating room\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlarge dark room situated opposite the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe clerks, who, as it appeared, had smelled unusual perfumes in the\r\nhouse, were of military punctuality, and held their stools in hand\r\nquite ready to sit down. Their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful\r\nthreatenings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Porthos, casting a glance at the three hungry\r\nclerks\xe2\x80\x94for the errand boy, as might be expected, was not admitted to\r\nthe honors of the magisterial table, \xe2\x80\x9cin my cousin\xe2\x80\x99s place, I would not\r\nkeep such gourmands! They look like shipwrecked sailors who have not\r\neaten for six weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Coquenard entered, pushed along upon his armchair with casters by\r\nMme. Coquenard, whom Porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the\r\ntable. He had scarcely entered when he began to agitate his nose and\r\nhis jaws after the example of his clerks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9chere is a soup which is rather inviting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPorthos, at the sight of a pale liquid, abundant but entirely free from\r\nmeat, on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the\r\nislands of an archipelago.\r\n\r\nMme. Coquenard smiled, and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took\r\nhis seat.\r\n\r\nM. Coquenard was served first, then Porthos. Afterward Mme. Coquenard\r\nfilled her own plate, and distributed the crusts without soup to the\r\nimpatient clerks. At this moment the door of the dining room unclosed\r\nwith a creak, and Porthos perceived through the half-open flap the\r\nlittle clerk who, not being allowed to take part in the feast, ate his\r\ndry bread in the passage with the double odor of the dining room and\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\nAfter the soup the maid brought a boiled fowl\xe2\x80\x94a piece of magnificence\r\nwhich caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that\r\nthey seemed ready to burst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne may see that you love your family, Madame Coquenard,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nprocurator, with a smile that was almost tragic. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are certainly\r\ntreating your cousin very handsomely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor fowl was thin, and covered with one of those thick, bristly\r\nskins through which the teeth cannot penetrate with all their efforts.\r\nThe fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch, to which\r\nit had retired to die of old age.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is poor work. I respect old age,\r\nbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t much like it boiled or roasted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion; but on\r\nthe contrary, he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring, in\r\nanticipation, that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt.\r\n\r\nMme. Coquenard drew the dish toward her, skillfully detached the two\r\ngreat black feet, which she placed upon her husband\xe2\x80\x99s plate, cut off\r\nthe neck, which with the head she put on one side for herself, raised\r\nthe wing for Porthos, and then returned the bird otherwise intact to\r\nthe servant who had brought it in, who disappeared with it before the\r\nMusketeer had time to examine the variations which disappointment\r\nproduces upon faces, according to the characters and temperaments of\r\nthose who experience it.\r\n\r\nIn the place of the fowl a dish of haricot beans made its appearance\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nenormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one\r\nmight have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nBut the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit, and their lugubrious\r\nlooks settled down into resigned countenances.\r\n\r\nMme. Coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the\r\nmoderation of a good housewife.\r\n\r\nThe time for wine came. M. Coquenard poured from a very small stone\r\nbottle the third of a glass for each of the young men, served himself\r\nin about the same proportion, and passed the bottle to Porthos and Mme.\r\nCoquenard.\r\n\r\nThe young men filled up their third of a glass with water; then, when\r\nthey had drunk half the glass, they filled it up again, and continued\r\nto do so. This brought them, by the end of the repast, to swallowing a\r\ndrink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale\r\ntopaz.\r\n\r\nPorthos ate his wing of the fowl timidly, and shuddered when he felt\r\nthe knee of the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife under the table, as it came in search\r\nof his. He also drank half a glass of this sparingly served wine, and\r\nfound it to be nothing but that horrible Montreuil\xe2\x80\x94the terror of all\r\nexpert palates.\r\n\r\nM. Coquenard saw him swallowing this wine undiluted, and sighed deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you eat any of these beans, Cousin Porthos?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Coquenard,\r\nin that tone which says, \xe2\x80\x9cTake my advice, don\xe2\x80\x99t touch them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevil take me if I taste one of them!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Porthos to himself,\r\nand then said aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, my cousin, I am no longer hungry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was silence. Porthos could hardly keep his countenance.\r\n\r\nThe procurator repeated several times, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Madame Coquenard! Accept my\r\ncompliments; your dinner has been a real feast. Lord, how I have\r\neaten!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Coquenard had eaten his soup, the black feet of the fowl, and the\r\nonly mutton bone on which there was the least appearance of meat.\r\n\r\nPorthos fancied they were mystifying him, and began to curl his\r\nmustache and knit his eyebrows; but the knee of Mme. Coquenard gently\r\nadvised him to be patient.\r\n\r\nThis silence and this interruption in serving, which were\r\nunintelligible to Porthos, had, on the contrary, a terrible meaning for\r\nthe clerks. Upon a look from the procurator, accompanied by a smile\r\nfrom Mme. Coquenard, they arose slowly from the table, folded their\r\nnapkins more slowly still, bowed, and retired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, young men! go and promote digestion by working,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nprocurator, gravely.\r\n\r\nThe clerks gone, Mme. Coquenard rose and took from a buffet a piece of\r\ncheese, some preserved quinces, and a cake which she had herself made\r\nof almonds and honey.\r\n\r\nM. Coquenard knit his eyebrows because there were too many good things.\r\nPorthos bit his lips because he saw not the wherewithal to dine. He\r\nlooked to see if the dish of beans was still there; the dish of beans\r\nhad disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA positive feast!\xe2\x80\x9d cried M. Coquenard, turning about in his chair, \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nreal feast, _epul\xc5\x93 epulorum_. Lucullus dines with Lucullus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos looked at the bottle, which was near him, and hoped that with\r\nwine, bread, and cheese, he might make a dinner; but wine was wanting,\r\nthe bottle was empty. M. and Mme. Coquenard did not seem to observe it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is fine!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cI am prettily caught!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves, and stuck his teeth\r\ninto the sticky pastry of Mme. Coquenard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sacrifice is consummated! Ah! if I had not the\r\nhope of peeping with Madame Coquenard into her husband\xe2\x80\x99s chest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM. Coquenard, after the luxuries of such a repast, which he called an\r\nexcess, felt the want of a siesta. Porthos began to hope that the thing\r\nwould take place at the present sitting, and in that same locality; but\r\nthe procurator would listen to nothing, he would be taken to his room,\r\nand was not satisfied till he was close to his chest, upon the edge of\r\nwhich, for still greater precaution, he placed his feet.\r\n\r\nThe procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife took Porthos into an adjoining room, and they\r\nbegan to lay the basis of a reconciliation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can come and dine three times a week,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Coquenard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, madame!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to abuse your\r\nkindness; besides, I must think of my outfit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, groaning, \xe2\x80\x9cthat unfortunate\r\noutfit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cit is so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut of what, then, does the equipment of your company consist,\r\nMonsieur Porthos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of many things!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Musketeers are, as you know,\r\npicked soldiers, and they require many things useless to the Guardsmen\r\nor the Swiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut yet, detail them to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, they may amount to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c, said Porthos, who preferred discussing the\r\ntotal to taking them one by one.\r\n\r\nThe procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife waited tremblingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo how much?\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope it does not exceed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped;\r\nspeech failed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cit does not exceed two thousand five hundred\r\nlivres! I even think that with economy I could manage it with two\r\nthousand livres.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, \xe2\x80\x9ctwo thousand livres! Why, that is a fortune!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos made a most significant grimace; Mme. Coquenard understood it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wished to know the detail,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause, having many\r\nrelatives in business, I was almost sure of obtaining things at a\r\nhundred per cent less than you would pay yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is what you meant to say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear Monsieur Porthos. Thus, for instance, don\xe2\x80\x99t you in the first\r\nplace want a horse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then! I can just suit you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, brightening, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s well as regards my horse; but\r\nI must have the appointments complete, as they include objects which a\r\nMusketeer alone can purchase, and which will not amount, besides, to\r\nmore than three hundred livres.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree hundred livres? Then put down three hundred livres,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nprocurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, with a sigh.\r\n\r\nPorthos smiled. It may be remembered that he had the saddle which came\r\nfrom Buckingham. These three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting\r\nsnugly into his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a horse for my lackey, and my valise.\r\nAs to my arms, it is useless to trouble you about them; I have them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA horse for your lackey?\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, hesitatingly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut that is doing things in lordly style, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, madame!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, haughtily; \xe2\x80\x9cdo you take me for a beggar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an\r\nappearance as a horse, and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty\r\nmule for Mousqueton\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, agreed for a pretty mule,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are right, I have\r\nseen very great Spanish nobles whose whole suite were mounted on mules.\r\nBut then you understand, Madame Coquenard, a mule with feathers and\r\nbells.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d said the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere remains the valise,\xe2\x80\x9d added Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t let that disturb you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mme. Coquenard. \xe2\x80\x9cMy husband has\r\nfive or six valises; you shall choose the best. There is one in\r\nparticular which he prefers in his journeys, large enough to hold all\r\nthe world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour valise is then empty?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Porthos, with simplicity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly it is empty,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, in real\r\ninnocence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but the valise I want,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cis a well-filled one, my\r\ndear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame uttered fresh sighs. Moli\xc3\xa8re had not written his scene in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cL\xe2\x80\x99Avare\xe2\x80\x9d then. Mme. Coquenard was in the dilemma of Harpagan.\r\n\r\nFinally, the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same\r\nmanner; and the result of the sitting was that the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nshould give eight hundred livres in money, and should furnish the horse\r\nand the mule which should have the honor of carrying Porthos and\r\nMousqueton to glory.\r\n\r\nThese conditions being agreed to, Porthos took leave of Mme. Coquenard.\r\nThe latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances; but\r\nPorthos urged the commands of duty, and the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife was\r\nobliged to give place to the king.\r\n\r\nThe Musketeer returned home hungry and in bad humor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIII.\r\nSOUBRETTE AND MISTRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime, as we have said, despite the cries of his conscience and the\r\nwise counsels of Athos, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan became hourly more in love with\r\nMilady. Thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her; and the\r\nself-satisfied Gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not\r\nfail to respond.\r\n\r\nOne day, when he arrived with his head in the air, and as light at\r\nheart as a man who awaits a shower of gold, he found the _soubrette_\r\nunder the gateway of the h\xc3\xb4tel; but this time the pretty Kitty was not\r\ncontented with touching him as he passed, she took him gently by the\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d thought D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is charged with some message for me\r\nfrom her mistress; she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she\r\nhad not courage to speak.\xe2\x80\x9d And he looked down at the pretty girl with\r\nthe most triumphant air imaginable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to say three words to you, Monsieur Chevalier,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered the\r\n_soubrette_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, my child, speak,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cI listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere? Impossible! That which I have to say is too long, and above all,\r\ntoo secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Monsieur Chevalier would follow me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty, timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you please, my dear child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Kitty, who had not let go the hand of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, led him up a\r\nlittle dark, winding staircase, and after ascending about fifteen\r\nsteps, opened a door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in here, Monsieur Chevalier,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9chere we shall be alone,\r\nand can talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd whose room is this, my dear child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is mine, Monsieur Chevalier; it communicates with my mistress\xe2\x80\x99s by\r\nthat door. But you need not fear. She will not hear what we say; she\r\nnever goes to bed before midnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan cast a glance around him. The little apartment was charming\r\nfor its taste and neatness; but in spite of himself, his eyes were\r\ndirected to that door which Kitty said led to Milady\xe2\x80\x99s chamber.\r\n\r\nKitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man, and heaved\r\na deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou love my mistress, then, very dearly, Monsieur Chevalier?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nshe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, more than I can say, Kitty! I am mad for her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKitty breathed a second sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is too bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil do you see so bad in it?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Kitty, \xe2\x80\x9cmy mistress loves you not at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Hein!_\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9ccan she have charged you to tell me so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, monsieur; but out of the regard I have for you, I have taken\r\nthe resolution to tell you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch obliged, my dear Kitty; but for the intention only\xe2\x80\x94for the\r\ninformation, you must agree, is not likely to be at all agreeable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe what I have told you; is it not so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have always some difficulty in believing such things, my pretty\r\ndear, were it only from self-love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you\r\nadvance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKitty drew a little note from her bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, seizing the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; for another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor another?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis name; his name!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead the address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur El Comte de Wardes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe remembrance of the scene at St. Germain presented itself to the\r\nmind of the presumptuous Gascon. As quick as thought, he tore open the\r\nletter, in spite of the cry which Kitty uttered on seeing what he was\r\ngoing to do, or rather, what he was doing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, good Lord, Monsieur Chevalier,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cnothing,\xe2\x80\x9d and he read,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not answered my first note. Are you indisposed, or have you\r\nforgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of Mme. de Guise?\r\nYou have an opportunity now, Count; do not allow it to escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan became very pale; he was wounded in his _self_-love: he\r\nthought that it was in his _love_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor dear Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty, in a voice full of\r\ncompassion, and pressing anew the young man\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou pity me, little one?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, and with all my heart; for I know what it is to be in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what it is to be in love?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, looking at her\r\nfor the first time with much attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, instead of pitying me, you would do much better to assist\r\nme in avenging myself on your mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what sort of revenge would you take?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would triumph over her, and supplant my rival.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will never help you in that, Monsieur Chevalier,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty,\r\nwarmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor two reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first is that my mistress will never love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have cut her to the heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? In what can I have offended her\xe2\x80\x94I who ever since I have known her\r\nhave lived at her feet like a slave? Speak, I beg you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will never confess that but to the man\xe2\x80\x94who should read to the bottom\r\nof my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan looked at Kitty for the second time. The young girl had\r\nfreshness and beauty which many duchesses would have purchased with\r\ntheir coronets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKitty,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI will read to the bottom of your soul whenever you\r\nlike; don\xe2\x80\x99t let that disturb you.\xe2\x80\x9d And he gave her a kiss at which the\r\npoor girl became as red as a cherry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not me you love! It is my mistress you\r\nlove; you told me so just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe second reason, Monsieur the Chevalier,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Kitty, emboldened\r\nby the kiss in the first place, and still further by the expression of\r\nthe eyes of the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cis that in love, everyone for herself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen only D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan remembered the languishing glances of Kitty, her\r\nconstantly meeting him in the antechamber, the corridor, or on the\r\nstairs, those touches of the hand every time she met him, and her deep\r\nsighs; but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady, he had\r\ndisdained the _soubrette_. He whose game is the eagle takes no heed of\r\nthe sparrow.\r\n\r\nBut this time our Gascon saw at a glance all the advantage to be\r\nderived from the love which Kitty had just confessed so innocently, or\r\nso boldly: the interception of letters addressed to the Comte de\r\nWardes, news on the spot, entrance at all hours into Kitty\xe2\x80\x99s chamber,\r\nwhich was contiguous to her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s. The perfidious deceiver was, as\r\nmay plainly be perceived, already sacrificing, in intention, the poor\r\ngirl in order to obtain Milady, willy-nilly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the young girl, \xe2\x80\x9care you willing, my dear Kitty,\r\nthat I should give you a proof of that love which you doubt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat love?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf that which I am ready to feel toward you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is that proof?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you willing that I should this evening pass with you the time I\r\ngenerally spend with your mistress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty, clapping her hands, \xe2\x80\x9cvery willing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, come here, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, establishing himself\r\nin an easy chair; \xe2\x80\x9ccome, and let me tell you that you are the prettiest\r\n_soubrette_ I ever saw!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he did tell her so much, and so well, that the poor girl, who asked\r\nnothing better than to believe him, did believe him. Nevertheless, to\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s great astonishment, the pretty Kitty defended herself\r\nresolutely.\r\n\r\nTime passes quickly when it is passed in attacks and defenses. Midnight\r\nsounded, and almost at the same time the bell was rung in Milady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Kitty, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is my mistress calling me! Go; go\r\ndirectly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan rose, took his hat, as if it had been his intention to obey,\r\nthen, opening quickly the door of a large closet instead of that\r\nleading to the staircase, he buried himself amid the robes and dressing\r\ngowns of Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Kitty.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who had secured the key, shut himself up in the closet\r\nwithout reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, in a sharp voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you asleep, that you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanswer when I ring?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan heard the door of communication opened violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere am I, Milady, here am I!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Kitty, springing forward to meet\r\nher mistress.\r\n\r\nBoth went into the bedroom, and as the door of communication remained\r\nopen, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan could hear Milady for some time scolding her maid. She\r\nwas at length appeased, and the conversation turned upon him while\r\nKitty was assisting her mistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cI have not seen our Gascon this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Milady! has he not come?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty. \xe2\x80\x9cCan he be inconstant\r\nbefore being happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no; he must have been prevented by Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville or\r\nMonsieur Dessessart. I understand my game, Kitty; I have this one\r\nsafe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do with him, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will I do with him? Be easy, Kitty, there is something between\r\nthat man and me that he is quite ignorant of: he nearly made me lose my\r\ncredit with his Eminence. Oh, I will be revenged!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believed that Madame loved him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love him? I detest him! An idiot, who held the life of Lord de\r\nWinter in his hands and did not kill him, by which I missed three\r\nhundred thousand livres\xe2\x80\x99 income.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty; \xe2\x80\x9cyour son was the only heir of his uncle,\r\nand until his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his\r\nfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature\r\nreproach him, with that sharp voice which she took such pains to\r\nconceal in conversation, for not having killed a man whom he had seen\r\nload her with kindnesses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all this,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cI should long ago have revenged\r\nmyself on him if, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, the cardinal had not requested\r\nme to conciliate him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; but Madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so\r\nfond of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, the mercer\xe2\x80\x99s wife of the Rue des Fossoyeurs? Has he not already\r\nforgotten she ever existed? Fine vengeance that, on my faith!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA cold sweat broke from D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s brow. Why, this woman was a\r\nmonster! He resumed his listening, but unfortunately the toilet was\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cgo into your own room, and tomorrow\r\nendeavor again to get me an answer to the letter I gave you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Monsieur de Wardes?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure; for Monsieur de Wardes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, there is one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty, \xe2\x80\x9cwho appears to me quite a different\r\nsort of a man from that poor Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to bed, mademoiselle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like comments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan heard the door close; then the noise of two bolts by which\r\nMilady fastened herself in. On her side, but as softly as possible,\r\nKitty turned the key of the lock, and then D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan opened the closet\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, good Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the matter with\r\nyou? How pale you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe abominable creature,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence, silence, begone!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing but a\r\nwainscot between my chamber and Milady\xe2\x80\x99s; every word that is uttered in\r\none can be heard in the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the reason I won\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty, blushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr, at least, I will go\xe2\x80\x94later.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew Kitty to him. She had the less motive to resist, resistance\r\nwould make so much noise. Therefore Kitty surrendered.\r\n\r\nIt was a movement of vengeance upon Milady. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan believed it\r\nright to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the gods. With a little\r\nmore heart, he might have been contented with this new conquest; but\r\nthe principal features of his character were ambition and pride. It\r\nmust, however, be confessed in his justification that the first use he\r\nmade of his influence over Kitty was to try and find out what had\r\nbecome of Mme. Bonacieux; but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head, her mistress\r\nnever admitting her into half her secrets\xe2\x80\x94only she believed she could\r\nsay she was not dead.\r\n\r\nAs to the cause which was near making Milady lose her credit with the\r\ncardinal, Kitty knew nothing about it; but this time D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was\r\nbetter informed than she was. As he had seen Milady on board a vessel\r\nat the moment he was leaving England, he suspected that it was, almost\r\nwithout a doubt, on account of the diamond studs.\r\n\r\nBut what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred, the\r\nprofound hatred, the inveterate hatred of Milady, was increased by his\r\nnot having killed her brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan came the next day to Milady\xe2\x80\x99s, and finding her in a very\r\nill-humor, had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from M. de Wardes\r\nthat provoked her thus. Kitty came in, but Milady was very cross with\r\nher. The poor girl ventured a glance at D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan which said, \xe2\x80\x9cSee how\r\nI suffer on your account!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToward the end of the evening, however, the beautiful lioness became\r\nmilder; she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and\r\neven gave him her hand to kiss.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan departed, scarcely knowing what to think, but as he was a\r\nyouth who did not easily lose his head, while continuing to pay his\r\ncourt to Milady, he had framed a little plan in his mind.\r\n\r\nHe found Kitty at the gate, and, as on the preceding evening, went up\r\nto her chamber. Kitty had been accused of negligence and severely\r\nscolded. Milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the Comte de\r\nWardes, and she ordered Kitty to come at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning to\r\ntake a third letter.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan made Kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following\r\nmorning. The poor girl promised all her lover desired; she was mad.\r\n\r\nThings passed as on the night before. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan concealed himself in\r\nhis closet; Milady called, undressed, sent away Kitty, and shut the\r\ndoor. As the night before, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan did not return home till five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock Kitty came to him. She held in her hand a fresh\r\nbillet from Milady. This time the poor girl did not even argue with\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; she gave it to him at once. She belonged body and soul to\r\nher handsome soldier.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan opened the letter and read as follows:\r\n\r\nThis is the third time I have written to you to tell you that I love\r\nyou. Beware that I do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that I\r\ndetest you.\r\n    If you repent of the manner in which you have acted toward me, the\r\n    young girl who brings you this will tell you how a man of spirit\r\n    may obtain his pardon.\r\n\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this billet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you love her still,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty, who had not taken her eyes off\r\nthe young man\xe2\x80\x99s countenance for an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Kitty, you are mistaken. I do not love her, but I will avenge\r\nmyself for her contempt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I know what sort of vengeance! You told me that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat matters it to you, Kitty? You know it is you alone whom I love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the scorn I will throw upon her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan took a pen and wrote:\r\n\r\nMADAME, Until the present moment I could not believe that it was to me\r\nyour first two letters were addressed, so unworthy did I feel myself of\r\nsuch an honor; besides, I was so seriously indisposed that I could not\r\nin any case have replied to them.\r\n    But now I am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness,\r\n    since not only your letter but your servant assures me that I have\r\n    the good fortune to be beloved by you.\r\n    She has no occasion to teach me the way in which a man of spirit\r\n    may obtain his pardon. I will come and ask mine at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\n    this evening.\r\n    To delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh\r\n    offense.\r\n    From him whom you have rendered the happiest of men,\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMTE DE WARDES\r\n\r\n\r\nThis note was in the first place a forgery; it was likewise an\r\nindelicacy. It was even, according to our present manners, something\r\nlike an infamous action; but at that period people did not manage\r\naffairs as they do today. Besides, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan from her own admission\r\nknew Milady culpable of treachery in matters more important, and could\r\nentertain no respect for her. And yet, notwithstanding this want of\r\nrespect, he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in\r\nhis veins\xe2\x80\x94passion drunk with contempt; but passion or thirst, as the\r\nreader pleases.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s plan was very simple. By Kitty\xe2\x80\x99s chamber he could gain\r\nthat of her mistress. He would take advantage of the first moment of\r\nsurprise, shame, and terror, to triumph over her. He might fail, but\r\nsomething must be left to chance. In eight days the campaign would\r\nopen, and he would be compelled to leave Paris; D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had no time\r\nfor a prolonged love siege.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, handing Kitty the letter sealed; \xe2\x80\x9cgive\r\nthat to Milady. It is the count\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Kitty became as pale as death; she suspected what the letter\r\ncontained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, my dear girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cyou cannot but perceive that\r\nall this must end, some way or other. Milady may discover that you gave\r\nthe first billet to my lackey instead of to the count\xe2\x80\x99s; that it is I\r\nwho have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de\r\nWardes. Milady will then turn you out of doors, and you know she is not\r\nthe woman to limit her vengeance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty, \xe2\x80\x9cfor whom have I exposed myself to all that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, I well know, my sweet girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am\r\ngrateful, I swear to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what does this note contain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMilady will tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you do not love me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Kitty, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am very wretched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this reproach there is always one response which deludes women.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan replied in such a manner that Kitty remained in her great\r\ndelusion. Although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the\r\nletter to her mistress, she did at last so decide, which was all\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan wished. Finally he promised that he would leave her\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s presence at an early hour that evening, and that when he\r\nleft the mistress he would ascend with the maid. This promise completed\r\npoor Kitty\xe2\x80\x99s consolation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIV.\r\nIN WHICH THE EQUIPMENT OF ARAMIS AND PORTHOS IS TREATED OF\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the four friends had been each in search of his equipments, there\r\nhad been no fixed meeting between them. They dined apart from one\r\nanother, wherever they might happen to be, or rather where they could.\r\nDuty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which\r\nwas gliding away so rapidly\xe2\x80\x94only they had agreed to meet once a week,\r\nabout one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, at the residence of Athos, seeing that he, in\r\nagreement with the vow he had formed, did not pass over the threshold\r\nof his door.\r\n\r\nThis day of reunion was the same day as that on which Kitty came to\r\nfind D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. Soon as Kitty left him, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan directed his steps\r\ntoward the Rue F\xc3\xa9rou.\r\n\r\nHe found Athos and Aramis philosophizing. Aramis had some slight\r\ninclination to resume the cassock. Athos, according to his system,\r\nneither encouraged nor dissuaded him. Athos believed that everyone\r\nshould be left to his own free will. He never gave advice but when it\r\nwas asked, and even then he required to be asked twice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople, in general,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9conly ask advice not to follow it; or if\r\nthey do follow it, it is for the sake of having someone to blame for\r\nhaving given it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos arrived a minute after D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. The four friends were\r\nreunited.\r\n\r\nThe four countenances expressed four different feelings: that of\r\nPorthos, tranquillity; that of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, hope; that of Aramis,\r\nuneasiness; that of Athos, carelessness.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a moment\xe2\x80\x99s conversation, in which Porthos hinted that a\r\nlady of elevated rank had condescended to relieve him from his\r\nembarrassment, Mousqueton entered. He came to request his master to\r\nreturn to his lodgings, where his presence was urgent, as he piteously\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it my equipment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes and no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mousqueton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but can\xe2\x80\x99t you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos rose, saluted his friends, and followed Mousqueton. An instant\r\nafter, Bazin made his appearance at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want with me, my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, with that mildness\r\nof language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were\r\ndirected toward the Church.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man wishes to see Monsieur at home,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bazin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man! What man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mendicant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him alms, Bazin, and bid him pray for a poor sinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis mendicant insists upon speaking to you, and pretends that you\r\nwill be very glad to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he sent no particular message for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. If Monsieur Aramis hesitates to come,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ctell him I am\r\nfrom Tours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Tours!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Aramis. \xe2\x80\x9cA thousand pardons, gentlemen; but no\r\ndoubt this man brings me the news I expected.\xe2\x80\x9d And rising also, he went\r\noff at a quick pace. There remained Athos and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe these fellows have managed their business. What do you\r\nthink, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that Porthos was in a fair way,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cand as to\r\nAramis to tell you the truth, I have never been seriously uneasy on his\r\naccount. But you, my dear Athos\xe2\x80\x94you, who so generously distributed the\r\nEnglishman\xe2\x80\x99s pistoles, which were our legitimate property\xe2\x80\x94what do you\r\nmean to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am satisfied with having killed that fellow, my boy, seeing that it\r\nis blessed bread to kill an Englishman; but if I had pocketed his\r\npistoles, they would have weighed me down like a remorse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to, my dear Athos; you have truly inconceivable ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it pass. What do you think of Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville telling me,\r\nwhen he did me the honor to call upon me yesterday, that you associated\r\nwith the suspected English, whom the cardinal protects?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, I visit an Englishwoman\xe2\x80\x94the one I named.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ay! the fair woman on whose account I gave you advice, which\r\nnaturally you took care not to adopt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave you my reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; you look there for your outfit, I think you said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. I have acquired certain knowledge that that woman was\r\nconcerned in the abduction of Madame Bonacieux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I understand now: to find one woman, you court another. It is the\r\nlongest road, but certainly the most amusing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was on the point of telling Athos all; but one consideration\r\nrestrained him. Athos was a gentleman, punctilious in points of honor;\r\nand there were in the plan which our lover had devised for Milady, he\r\nwas sure, certain things that would not obtain the assent of this\r\nPuritan. He was therefore silent; and as Athos was the least\r\ninquisitive of any man on earth, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s confidence stopped there.\r\nWe will therefore leave the two friends, who had nothing important to\r\nsay to each other, and follow Aramis.\r\n\r\nUpon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came\r\nfrom Tours, we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed, or\r\nrather went before, Bazin; he ran without stopping from the Rue F\xc3\xa9rou\r\nto the Rue de Vaugirard. On entering he found a man of short stature\r\nand intelligent eyes, but covered with rags.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have asked for me?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Musketeer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to speak with Monsieur Aramis. Is that your name, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy very own. You have brought me something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if you show me a certain embroidered handkerchief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, taking a small key from his breast and\r\nopening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl, \xe2\x80\x9chere it is.\r\nLook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is right,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the mendicant; \xe2\x80\x9cdismiss your lackey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, Bazin, curious to know what the mendicant could want with his\r\nmaster, kept pace with him as well as he could, and arrived almost at\r\nthe same time he did; but his quickness was not of much use to him. At\r\nthe hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire, and\r\nhe was obliged to obey.\r\n\r\nBazin gone, the mendicant cast a rapid glance around him in order to be\r\nsure that nobody could either see or hear him, and opening his ragged\r\nvest, badly held together by a leather strap, he began to rip the upper\r\npart of his doublet, from which he drew a letter.\r\n\r\nAramis uttered a cry of joy at the sight of the seal, kissed the\r\nsuperscription with an almost religious respect, and opened the\r\nepistle, which contained what follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Friend, it is the will of fate that we should be still for some\r\ntime separated; but the delightful days of youth are not lost beyond\r\nreturn. Perform your duty in camp; I will do mine elsewhere. Accept\r\nthat which the bearer brings you; make the campaign like a handsome\r\ntrue gentleman, and think of me, who kisses tenderly your black eyes.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAdieu; or rather, _au revoir_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mendicant continued to rip his garments; and drew from amid his\r\nrags a hundred and fifty Spanish double pistoles, which he laid down on\r\nthe table; then he opened the door, bowed, and went out before the\r\nyoung man, stupefied by his letter, had ventured to address a word to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAramis then reperused the letter, and perceived a postscript:\r\n\r\nPS. You may behave politely to the bearer, who is a count and a grandee\r\nof Spain!\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGolden dreams!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Aramis. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, beautiful life! Yes, we are young;\r\nyes, we shall yet have happy days! My love, my blood, my life! all,\r\nall, all, are thine, my adored mistress!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he kissed the letter with passion, without even vouchsafing a look\r\nat the gold which sparkled on the table.\r\n\r\nBazin scratched at the door, and as Aramis had no longer any reason to\r\nexclude him, he bade him come in.\r\n\r\nBazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold, and forgot that he came\r\nto announce D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who, curious to know who the mendicant could\r\nbe, came to Aramis on leaving Athos.\r\n\r\nNow, as D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan used no ceremony with Aramis, seeing that Bazin\r\nforgot to announce him, he announced himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil! my dear Aramis,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cif these are the prunes\r\nthat are sent to you from Tours, I beg you will make my compliments to\r\nthe gardener who gathers them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken, friend D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, always on his\r\nguard; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is from my publisher, who has just sent me the price of\r\nthat poem in one-syllable verse which I began yonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, your publisher is very generous,\r\nmy dear Aramis, that\xe2\x80\x99s all I can say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bazin, \xe2\x80\x9ca poem sell so dear as that! It is\r\nincredible! Oh, monsieur, you can write as much as you like; you may\r\nbecome equal to Monsieur de Voiture and Monsieur de Benserade. I like\r\nthat. A poet is as good as an abb\xc3\xa9. Ah! Monsieur Aramis, become a poet,\r\nI beg of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBazin, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you meddle with my\r\nconversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBazin perceived he was wrong; he bowed and went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cyou sell your productions at their\r\nweight in gold. You are very fortunate, my friend; but take care or you\r\nwill lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet, and which\r\nalso comes, no doubt, from your publisher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis blushed to the eyes, crammed in the letter, and re-buttoned his\r\ndoublet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cif you please, we will join our\r\nfriends; as I am rich, we will today begin to dine together again,\r\nexpecting that you will be rich in your turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with great pleasure. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is long since we\r\nhave had a good dinner; and I, for my part, have a somewhat hazardous\r\nexpedition for this evening, and shall not be sorry, I confess, to\r\nfortify myself with a few glasses of good old Burgundy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgreed, as to the old Burgundy; I have no objection to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAramis, from whom the letter and the gold had removed, as by magic, his\r\nideas of conversion.\r\n\r\nAnd having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer\r\nthe needs of the moment, he placed the others in the ebony box, inlaid\r\nwith mother of pearl, in which was the famous handkerchief which served\r\nhim as a talisman.\r\n\r\nThe two friends repaired to Athos\xe2\x80\x99s, and he, faithful to his vow of not\r\ngoing out, took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them. As he\r\nwas perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and\r\nAramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him.\r\n\r\nThey went to find Porthos, and at the corner of the Rue Bac met\r\nMousqueton, who, with a most pitiable air, was driving before him a\r\nmule and a horse.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan uttered a cry of surprise, which was not quite free from\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my yellow horse,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he. \xe2\x80\x9cAramis, look at that horse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the frightful brute!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cupon that very horse I came to\r\nParis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, does Monsieur know this horse?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mousqueton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is of an original color,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis; \xe2\x80\x9cI never saw one with such a\r\nhide in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can well believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cand that was why I got\r\nthree crowns for him. It must have been for his hide, for, _certes_,\r\nthe carcass is not worth eighteen livres. But how did this horse come\r\ninto your hands, Mousqueton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lackey, \xe2\x80\x9csay nothing about it, monsieur; it is a\r\nfrightful trick of the husband of our duchess!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is that, Mousqueton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, we are looked upon with a rather favorable eye by a lady of\r\nquality, the Duchesse de\xe2\x80\x94but, your pardon; my master has commanded me\r\nto be discreet. She had forced us to accept a little souvenir, a\r\nmagnificent Spanish _genet_ and an Andalusian mule, which were\r\nbeautiful to look upon. The husband heard of the affair; on their way\r\nhe confiscated the two magnificent beasts which were being sent to us,\r\nand substituted these horrible animals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich you are taking back to him?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mousqueton. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may well believe that we will not\r\naccept such steeds as these in exchange for those which had been\r\npromised to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, _pardieu;_ though I should like to have seen Porthos on my yellow\r\nhorse. That would give me an idea of how I looked when I arrived in\r\nParis. But don\xe2\x80\x99t let us hinder you, Mousqueton; go and perform your\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s orders. Is he at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mousqueton, \xe2\x80\x9cbut in a very ill humor. Get up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe continued his way toward the Quai des Grands Augustins, while the\r\ntwo friends went to ring at the bell of the unfortunate Porthos. He,\r\nhaving seen them crossing the yard, took care not to answer, and they\r\nrang in vain.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mousqueton continued on his way, and crossing the Pont Neuf,\r\nstill driving the two sorry animals before him, he reached the Rue aux\r\nOurs. Arrived there, he fastened, according to the orders of his\r\nmaster, both horse and mule to the knocker of the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s door;\r\nthen, without taking any thought for their future, he returned to\r\nPorthos, and told him that his commission was completed.\r\n\r\nIn a short time the two unfortunate beasts, who had not eaten anything\r\nsince the morning, made such a noise in raising and letting fall the\r\nknocker that the procurator ordered his errand boy to go and inquire in\r\nthe neighborhood to whom this horse and mule belonged.\r\n\r\nMme. Coquenard recognized her present, and could not at first\r\ncomprehend this restitution; but the visit of Porthos soon enlightened\r\nher. The anger which fired the eyes of the Musketeer, in spite of his\r\nefforts to suppress it, terrified his sensitive inamorata. In fact,\r\nMousqueton had not concealed from his master that he had met D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nand Aramis, and that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan in the yellow horse had recognized the\r\nB\xc3\xa9arnese pony upon which he had come to Paris, and which he had sold\r\nfor three crowns.\r\n\r\nPorthos went away after having appointed a meeting with the\r\nprocurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife in the cloister of St. Magloire. The procurator,\r\nseeing he was going, invited him to dinner\xe2\x80\x94an invitation which the\r\nMusketeer refused with a majestic air.\r\n\r\nMme. Coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of St. Magloire, for\r\nshe guessed the reproaches that awaited her there; but she was\r\nfascinated by the lofty airs of Porthos.\r\n\r\nAll that which a man wounded in his self-love could let fall in the\r\nshape of imprecations and reproaches upon the head of a woman Porthos\r\nlet fall upon the bowed head of the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI did all for the best! One of our clients is a\r\nhorsedealer; he owes money to the office, and is backward in his pay. I\r\ntook the mule and the horse for what he owed us; he assured me that\r\nthey were two noble steeds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cif he owed you more than five crowns,\r\nyour horsedealer is a thief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no harm in trying to buy things cheap, Monsieur Porthos,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, seeking to excuse herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madame; but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought\r\nto permit others to seek more generous friends.\xe2\x80\x9d And Porthos, turning\r\non his heel, made a step to retire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Porthos! Monsieur Porthos!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave been wrong; I see it. I ought not to have driven a bargain when it\r\nwas to equip a cavalier like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos, without reply, retreated a second step. The procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nfancied she saw him in a brilliant cloud, all surrounded by duchesses\r\nand marchionesses, who cast bags of money at his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, in the name of heaven, Monsieur Porthos!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she. \xe2\x80\x9cStop, and\r\nlet us talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalking with you brings me misfortune,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, tell me, what do you ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing; for that amounts to the same thing as if I asked you for\r\nsomething.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife hung upon the arm of Porthos, and in the violence\r\nof her grief she cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Porthos, I am ignorant of all\r\nsuch matters! How should I know what a horse is? How should I know what\r\nhorse furniture is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have left it to me, then, madame, who know what they are;\r\nbut you wished to be frugal, and consequently to lend at usury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was wrong, Monsieur Porthos; but I will repair that wrong, upon my\r\nword of honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Musketeer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen. This evening M. Coquenard is going to the house of the Duc de\r\nChaulnes, who has sent for him. It is for a consultation, which will\r\nlast three hours at least. Come! We shall be alone, and can make up our\r\naccounts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn good time. Now you talk, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou pardon me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, majestically; and the two separated\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cTill this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Porthos, as he walked away, \xe2\x80\x9cit appears I am\r\ngetting nearer to Monsieur Coquenard\xe2\x80\x99s strongbox at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXV.\r\nA GASCON A MATCH FOR CUPID\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evening so impatiently waited for by Porthos and by D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan at\r\nlast arrived.\r\n\r\nAs was his custom, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan presented himself at Milady\xe2\x80\x99s at about\r\nnine o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He found her in a charming humor. Never had he been so\r\nwell received. Our Gascon knew, by the first glance of his eye, that\r\nhis billet had been delivered, and that this billet had had its effect.\r\n\r\nKitty entered to bring some sherbet. Her mistress put on a charming\r\nface, and smiled on her graciously; but alas! the poor girl was so sad\r\nthat she did not even notice Milady\xe2\x80\x99s condescension.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan looked at the two women, one after the other, and was forced\r\nto acknowledge that in his opinion Dame Nature had made a mistake in\r\ntheir formation. To the great lady she had given a heart vile and\r\nvenal; to the _soubrette_ she had given the heart of a duchess.\r\n\r\nAt ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock Milady began to appear restless. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan knew what\r\nshe wanted. She looked at the clock, rose, reseated herself, smiled at\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan with an air which said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are very amiable, no doubt, but\r\nyou would be _charming_ if you would only depart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan rose and took his hat; Milady gave him her hand to kiss. The\r\nyoung man felt her press his hand, and comprehended that this was a\r\nsentiment, not of coquetry, but of gratitude because of his departure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe loves him devilishly,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. Then he went out.\r\n\r\nThis time Kitty was nowhere waiting for him; neither in the\r\nantechamber, nor in the corridor, nor beneath the great door. It was\r\nnecessary that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan should find alone the staircase and the\r\nlittle chamber. She heard him enter, but she did not raise her head.\r\nThe young man went to her and took her hands; then she sobbed aloud.\r\n\r\nAs D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had presumed, on receiving his letter, Milady in a\r\ndelirium of joy had told her servant everything; and by way of\r\nrecompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the\r\ncommission, she had given Kitty a purse.\r\n\r\nReturning to her own room, Kitty had thrown the purse into a corner,\r\nwhere it lay open, disgorging three or four gold pieces on the carpet.\r\nThe poor girl, under the caresses of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, lifted her head.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance. She\r\njoined her hands with a suppliant air, but without venturing to speak a\r\nword. As little sensitive as was the heart of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, he was\r\ntouched by this mute sorrow; but he held too tenaciously to his\r\nprojects, above all to this one, to change the program which he had\r\nlaid out in advance. He did not therefore allow her any hope that he\r\nwould flinch; only he represented his action as one of simple\r\nvengeance.\r\n\r\nFor the rest this vengeance was very easy; for Milady, doubtless to\r\nconceal her blushes from her lover, had ordered Kitty to extinguish all\r\nthe lights in the apartment, and even in the little chamber itself.\r\nBefore daybreak M. de Wardes must take his departure, still in\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\nPresently they heard Milady retire to her room. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan slipped into\r\nthe wardrobe. Hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded.\r\nKitty went to her mistress, and did not leave the door open; but the\r\npartition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed\r\nbetween the two women.\r\n\r\nMilady seemed overcome with joy, and made Kitty repeat the smallest\r\ndetails of the pretended interview of the _soubrette_ with De Wardes\r\nwhen he received the letter; how he had responded; what was the\r\nexpression of his face; if he seemed very amorous. And to all these\r\nquestions poor Kitty, forced to put on a pleasant face, responded in a\r\nstifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however\r\nremark, solely because happiness is egotistical.\r\n\r\nFinally, as the hour for her interview with the count approached,\r\nMilady had everything about her darkened, and ordered Kitty to return\r\nto her own chamber, and introduce De Wardes whenever he presented\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nKitty\xe2\x80\x99s detention was not long. Hardly had D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan seen, through a\r\ncrevice in his closet, that the whole apartment was in obscurity, than\r\nhe slipped out of his concealment, at the very moment when Kitty\r\nreclosed the door of communication.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that noise?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan in a subdued voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI, the Comte de\r\nWardes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Kitty, \xe2\x80\x9che has not even waited for the\r\nhour he himself named!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, in a trembling voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy do you not enter?\r\nCount, Count,\xe2\x80\x9d added she, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know that I wait for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this appeal D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan drew Kitty quietly away, and slipped into the\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nIf rage or sorrow ever torture the heart, it is when a lover receives\r\nunder a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to\r\nhis happy rival. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had\r\nnot foreseen. Jealousy gnawed his heart; and he suffered almost as much\r\nas poor Kitty, who at that very moment was crying in the next chamber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Count,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, in her softest voice, and pressing his hand\r\nin her own, \xe2\x80\x9cI am happy in the love which your looks and your words\r\nhave expressed to me every time we have met. I also\xe2\x80\x94I love you. Oh,\r\ntomorrow, tomorrow, I must have some pledge from you which will prove\r\nthat you think of me; and that you may not forget me, take this!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nshe slipped a ring from her finger onto D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nremembered having seen this ring on the finger of Milady; it was a\r\nmagnificent sapphire, encircled with brilliants.\r\n\r\nThe first movement of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was to return it, but Milady added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! Keep that ring for love of me. Besides, in accepting it,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded, in a voice full of emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cyou render me a much greater\r\nservice than you imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis woman is full of mysteries,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to himself. At\r\nthat instant he felt himself ready to reveal all. He even opened his\r\nmouth to tell Milady who he was, and with what a revengeful purpose he\r\nhad come; but she added, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor angel, whom that monster of a Gascon\r\nbarely failed to kill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe monster was himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cdo your wounds still make you suffer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, much,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who did not well know how to answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe tranquil,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cI will avenge you\xe2\x80\x94and cruelly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Peste!_\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthe moment for confidences has\r\nnot yet come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt took some time for D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to resume this little dialogue; but\r\nthen all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had\r\ncompletely vanished. This woman exercised over him an unaccountable\r\npower; he hated and adored her at the same time. He would not have\r\nbelieved that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart,\r\nand by their union constitute a passion so strange, and as it were,\r\ndiabolical.\r\n\r\nPresently it sounded one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. It was necessary to separate.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan at the moment of quitting Milady felt only the liveliest\r\nregret at the parting; and as they addressed each other in a\r\nreciprocally passionate adieu, another interview was arranged for the\r\nfollowing week.\r\n\r\nPoor Kitty hoped to speak a few words to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan when he passed\r\nthrough her chamber; but Milady herself reconducted him through the\r\ndarkness, and only quit him at the staircase.\r\n\r\nThe next morning D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan ran to find Athos. He was engaged in an\r\nadventure so singular that he wished for counsel. He therefore told him\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Milady,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cappears to be an infamous creature, but not\r\nthe less you have done wrong to deceive her. In one fashion or another\r\nyou have a terrible enemy on your hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile thus speaking Athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with\r\ndiamonds which had taken, on D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s finger, the place of the\r\nqueen\xe2\x80\x99s ring, carefully kept in a casket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou notice my ring?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Gascon, proud to display so rich a gift\r\nin the eyes of his friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cit reminds me of a family jewel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is beautiful, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cmagnificent. I did not think two sapphires of such\r\na fine water existed. Have you traded it for your diamond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. It is a gift from my beautiful Englishwoman, or rather\r\nFrenchwoman\xe2\x80\x94for I am convinced she was born in France, though I have\r\nnot questioned her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ring comes from Milady?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos, with a voice in which it\r\nwas easy to detect strong emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer very self; she gave it me last night. Here it is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, taking it from his finger.\r\n\r\nAthos examined it and became very pale. He tried it on his left hand;\r\nit fit his finger as if made for it.\r\n\r\nA shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of\r\nthis gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible it can be she,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cHow could this ring come\r\ninto the hands of Milady Clarik? And yet it is difficult to suppose\r\nsuch a resemblance should exist between two jewels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know this ring?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I did,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cbut no doubt I was mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nreturned D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan the ring without, however, ceasing to look at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, after a minute, \xe2\x80\x9ceither take off that\r\nring or turn the mounting inside; it recalls such cruel recollections\r\nthat I shall have no head to converse with you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me for\r\ncounsel; don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me you are perplexed what to do. But stop! let me\r\nlook at that sapphire again; the one I mentioned to you had one of its\r\nfaces scratched by accident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan took off the ring, giving it again to Athos.\r\n\r\nAthos started. \xe2\x80\x9cLook,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cis it not strange?\xe2\x80\x9d and he pointed out\r\nto D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan the scratch he had remembered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut from whom did this ring come to you, Athos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom my mother, who inherited it from her mother. As I told you, it is\r\nan old family jewel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x94sold it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos, with a singular smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI gave it away in a night\r\nof love, as it has been given to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan became pensive in his turn; it appeared as if there were\r\nabysses in Milady\xe2\x80\x99s soul whose depths were dark and unknown. He took\r\nback the ring, but put it in his pocket and not on his finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, taking his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know I love you; if I\r\nhad a son I could not love him better. Take my advice, renounce this\r\nwoman. I do not know her, but a sort of intuition tells me she is a\r\nlost creature, and that there is something fatal about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cI will have done with her. I own\r\nthat this woman terrifies me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you have the courage?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cand instantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, my young friend, you will act rightly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman,\r\npressing the Gascon\xe2\x80\x99s hand with an affection almost paternal; \xe2\x80\x9cand God\r\ngrant that this woman, who has scarcely entered into your life, may not\r\nleave a terrible trace in it!\xe2\x80\x9d And Athos bowed to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan like a man\r\nwho wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone\r\nwith his thoughts.\r\n\r\nOn reaching home D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan found Kitty waiting for him. A month of\r\nfever could not have changed her more than this one night of\r\nsleeplessness and sorrow.\r\n\r\nShe was sent by her mistress to the false De Wardes. Her mistress was\r\nmad with love, intoxicated with joy. She wished to know when her lover\r\nwould meet her a second night; and poor Kitty, pale and trembling,\r\nawaited D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s reply. The counsels of his friend, joined to the\r\ncries of his own heart, made him determine, now his pride was saved and\r\nhis vengeance satisfied, not to see Milady again. As a reply, he wrote\r\nthe following letter:\r\n\r\nDo not depend upon me, madame, for the next meeting. Since my\r\nconvalescence I have so many affairs of this kind on my hands that I am\r\nforced to regulate them a little. When your turn comes, I shall have\r\nthe honor to inform you of it. I kiss your hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMTE DE WARDES\r\n\r\n\r\nNot a word about the sapphire. Was the Gascon determined to keep it as\r\na weapon against Milady, or else, let us be frank, did he not reserve\r\nthe sapphire as a last resource for his outfit? It would be wrong to\r\njudge the actions of one period from the point of view of another. That\r\nwhich would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that\r\ntime quite a simple and natural affair, and the younger sons of the\r\nbest families were frequently supported by their mistresses. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\ngave the open letter to Kitty, who at first was unable to comprehend\r\nit, but who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second time.\r\nShe could scarcely believe in her happiness; and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was forced\r\nto renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written. And\r\nwhatever might be\xe2\x80\x94considering the violent character of Milady\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndanger which the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her\r\nmistress, she ran back to the Place Royale as fast as her legs could\r\ncarry her.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the best woman is pitiless toward the sorrows of a rival.\r\n\r\nMilady opened the letter with eagerness equal to Kitty\xe2\x80\x99s in bringing\r\nit; but at the first words she read she became livid. She crushed the\r\npaper in her hand, and turning with flashing eyes upon Kitty, she\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe answer to Madame\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Kitty, all in a tremble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible a gentleman could have\r\nwritten such a letter to a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d Then all at once, starting, she\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x9cMy God! can he have\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and she stopped. She ground her teeth;\r\nshe was of the color of ashes. She tried to go toward the window for\r\nair, but she could only stretch forth her arms; her legs failed her,\r\nand she sank into an armchair. Kitty, fearing she was ill, hastened\r\ntoward her and was beginning to open her dress; but Milady started up,\r\npushing her away. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want with me?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand why do you\r\nplace your hand on me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought that Madame was ill, and I wished to bring her help,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nresponded the maid, frightened at the terrible expression which had\r\ncome over her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI faint? I? I? Do you take me for half a woman? When I am insulted I\r\ndo not faint; I avenge myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she made a sign for Kitty to leave the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVI.\r\nDREAM OF VENGEANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening Milady gave orders that when M. d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan came as usual,\r\nhe should be immediately admitted; but he did not come.\r\n\r\nThe next day Kitty went to see the young man again, and related to him\r\nall that had passed on the preceding evening. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan smiled; this\r\njealous anger of Milady was his revenge.\r\n\r\nThat evening Milady was still more impatient than on the preceding\r\nevening. She renewed the order relative to the Gascon; but as before\r\nshe expected him in vain.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when Kitty presented herself at D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s, she was\r\nno longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days; but on the\r\ncontrary sad as death.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan asked the poor girl what was the matter with her; but she,\r\nas her only reply, drew a letter from her pocket and gave it to him.\r\n\r\nThis letter was in Milady\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting; only this time it was\r\naddressed to M. d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and not to M. de Wardes.\r\n\r\nHe opened it and read as follows:\r\n\r\nDEAR M. D\xe2\x80\x99ARTAGNAN, It is wrong thus to neglect your friends,\r\nparticularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a\r\ntime. My brother-in-law and myself expected you yesterday and the day\r\nbefore, but in vain. Will it be the same this evening?\r\n\r\n\r\nYour very grateful,\r\nMILADY CLARIK\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all very simple,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cI expected this letter. My\r\ncredit rises by the fall of that of the Comte de Wardes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you go?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Kitty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me, my dear girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Gascon, who sought for an excuse\r\nin his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cyou must\r\nunderstand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive\r\ninvitation. Milady, not seeing me come again, would not be able to\r\nunderstand what could cause the interruption of my visits, and might\r\nsuspect something; who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman\r\nwould go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know how to represent things in such a\r\nway that you are always in the right. You are going now to pay your\r\ncourt to her again, and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in\r\nyour own name and with your own face, it will be much worse than\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstinct made poor Kitty guess a part of what was to happen. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nreassured her as well as he could, and promised to remain insensible to\r\nthe seductions of Milady.\r\n\r\nHe desired Kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more\r\ngrateful for her kindnesses than he was, and that he would be obedient\r\nto her orders. He did not dare to write for fear of not being able\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nsuch experienced eyes as those of Milady\xe2\x80\x94to disguise his writing\r\nsufficiently.\r\n\r\nAs nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock sounded, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was at the Place Royale. It was\r\nevident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned,\r\nfor as soon as D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan appeared, before even he had asked if Milady\r\nwere visible, one of them ran to announce him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow him in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, in a quick tone, but so piercing that\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan heard her in the antechamber.\r\n\r\nHe was introduced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am at home to nobody,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cobserve, to _nobody_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant went out.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan cast an inquiring glance at Milady. She was pale, and looked\r\nfatigued, either from tears or want of sleep. The number of lights had\r\nbeen intentionally diminished, but the young woman could not conceal\r\nthe traces of the fever which had devoured her for two days.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan approached her with his usual gallantry. She then made an\r\nextraordinary effort to receive him, but never did a more distressed\r\ncountenance give the lie to a more amiable smile.\r\n\r\nTo the questions which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan put concerning her health, she\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cBad, very bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, \xe2\x80\x9cmy visit is ill-timed; you, no doubt, stand in\r\nneed of repose, and I will withdraw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, stay, Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan;\r\nyour agreeable company will divert me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d thought D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has never been so kind before. On\r\nguard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady assumed the most agreeable air possible, and conversed with more\r\nthan her usual brilliancy. At the same time the fever, which for an\r\ninstant abandoned her, returned to give luster to her eyes, color to\r\nher cheeks, and vermillion to her lips. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was again in the\r\npresence of the Circe who had before surrounded him with her\r\nenchantments. His love, which he believed to be extinct but which was\r\nonly asleep, awoke again in his heart. Milady smiled, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nfelt that he could damn himself for that smile. There was a moment at\r\nwhich he felt something like remorse.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, Milady became more communicative. She asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan if\r\nhe had a mistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with the most sentimental air he could assume,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccan you be cruel enough to put such a question to me\xe2\x80\x94to me, who, from\r\nthe moment I saw you, have only breathed and sighed through you and for\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady smiled with a strange smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I any need to tell you so? Have you not perceived it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be; but you know the more hearts are worth the capture, the\r\nmore difficult they are to be won.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, difficulties do not affright me,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cI shrink\r\nbefore nothing but impossibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing is impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cto true love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d thought D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cThe note is changed. Is she going to\r\nfall in love with me, by chance, this fair inconstant; and will she be\r\ndisposed to give me myself another sapphire like that which she gave me\r\nfor De Wardes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan rapidly drew his seat nearer to Milady\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9clet us see what you would do to prove this love\r\nof which you speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that could be required of me. Order; I am ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor everything,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who knew beforehand that he had not\r\nmuch to risk in engaging himself thus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now let us talk a little seriously,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, in her turn\r\ndrawing her armchair nearer to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am all attention, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nMilady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment; then, as if\r\nappearing to have formed a resolution, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have an enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, madame!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, affecting surprise; \xe2\x80\x9cis that possible,\r\nmy God?\xe2\x80\x94good and beautiful as you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mortal enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is\r\nwar to the death. May I reckon on you as an auxiliary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature\r\nwished to reach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with emphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cMy arm and my life belong\r\nto you, like my love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9csince you are as generous as you are loving\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady, after a moment of silence, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the present\r\ntime, cease to talk of impossibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not overwhelm me with happiness,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, throwing\r\nhimself on his knees, and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAvenge me of that infamous De Wardes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, between her teeth,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I shall soon know how to get rid of you\xe2\x80\x94you double idiot, you\r\nanimated sword blade!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFall voluntarily into my arms, hypocritical and dangerous woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, likewise to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cafter having abused me with such\r\neffrontery, and afterward I will laugh at you with him whom you wish me\r\nto kill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan lifted up his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have understood me, then, dear Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could interpret one of your looks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so\r\nmuch renown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstantly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut on my part,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9chow should I repay such a service? I\r\nknow these lovers. They are men who do nothing for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know the only reply that I desire,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthe only one\r\nworthy of you and of me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he drew nearer to her.\r\n\r\nShe scarcely resisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInterested man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, really carried away by the passion this woman\r\nhad the power to kindle in his heart, \xe2\x80\x9cah, that is because my happiness\r\nappears so impossible to me; and I have such fear that it should fly\r\naway from me like a dream that I pant to make a reality of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, merit this pretended happiness, then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am at your orders,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite certain?\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, with a last doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly name to me the base man that has brought tears into your\r\nbeautiful eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you that I had been weeping?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appeared to me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch women as I never weep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better! Come, tell me his name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember that his name is all my secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet I must know his name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you must; see what confidence I have in you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou overwhelm me with joy. What is his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is surely not one of my friends?\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, affecting\r\nhesitation in order to make her believe him ignorant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were one of your friends you would hesitate, then?\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nMilady; and a threatening glance darted from her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if it were my own brother!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, as if carried away\r\nby his enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nOur Gascon promised this without risk, for he knew all that was meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love your devotedness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, do you love nothing else in me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you also, _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d said she, taking his hand.\r\n\r\nThe warm pressure made D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan tremble, as if by the touch that\r\nfever which consumed Milady attacked himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou love me, you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, if that were so, I should lose my\r\nreason!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he folded her in his arms. She made no effort to remove her lips\r\nfrom his kisses; only she did not respond to them. Her lips were cold;\r\nit appeared to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan that he had embraced a statue.\r\n\r\nHe was not the less intoxicated with joy, electrified by love. He\r\nalmost believed in the tenderness of Milady; he almost believed in the\r\ncrime of De Wardes. If De Wardes had at that moment been under his\r\nhand, he would have killed him.\r\n\r\nMilady seized the occasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis name is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in her turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe Wardes; I know it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady, seizing both his hands, and\r\nendeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his heart.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away, and that he\r\nhad committed an error.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, tell me, tell me, I say,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Milady, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you know\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know it?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it because yesterday Monsieur de Wardes, in a saloon where I\r\nwas, showed a ring which he said he had received from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWretch!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady.\r\n\r\nThe epithet, as may be easily understood, resounded to the very bottom\r\nof D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d continued she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will avenge you of this wretch,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, giving\r\nhimself the airs of Don Japhet of Armenia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, my brave friend!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cand when shall I be avenged?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow\xe2\x80\x94immediately\xe2\x80\x94when you please!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady was about to cry out, \xe2\x80\x9cImmediately,\xe2\x80\x9d but she reflected that such\r\nprecipitation would not be very gracious toward D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\nBesides, she had a thousand precautions to take, a thousand counsels to\r\ngive to her defender, in order that he might avoid explanations with\r\nthe count before witnesses. All this was answered by an expression of\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will be avenged, or I shall be\r\ndead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will avenge me; but you will not be dead. He is a\r\ncoward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith women, perhaps; but not with men. I know something of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in\r\nyour contest with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFortune is a courtesan; favorable yesterday, she may turn her back\r\ntomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich means that you now hesitate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not hesitate; God forbid! But would it be just to allow me to\r\ngo to a possible death without having given me at least something more\r\nthan hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady answered by a glance which said, \xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x94speak, then.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthen accompanying the glance with explanatory words, \xe2\x80\x9cThat is but too\r\njust,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, tenderly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you are an angel!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen all is agreed?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept that which I ask of you, dear love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when I assure you that you may rely on my tenderness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot wait till tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence! I hear my brother. It will be useless for him to find you\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rang the bell and Kitty appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo out this way,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, opening a small private door, \xe2\x80\x9cand come\r\nback at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock; we will then terminate this conversation. Kitty\r\nwill conduct you to my chamber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor girl almost fainted at hearing these words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, mademoiselle, what are you thinking about, standing there like a\r\nstatue? Do as I bid you: show the chevalier out; and this evening at\r\neleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94you have heard what I said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears that these appointments are all made for eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthought D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a settled custom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady held out her hand to him, which he kissed tenderly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as he retired as quickly as possible from the\r\nreproaches of Kitty, \xe2\x80\x9cI must not play the fool. This woman is certainly\r\na great liar. I must take care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVII.\r\nMILADY\xe2\x80\x99S SECRET\r\n\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan left the h\xc3\xb4tel instead of going up at once to Kitty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchamber, as she endeavored to persuade him to do\xe2\x80\x94and that for two\r\nreasons: the first, because by this means he should escape reproaches,\r\nrecriminations, and prayers; the second, because he was not sorry to\r\nhave an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring, if\r\npossible, to fathom those of this woman.\r\n\r\nWhat was most clear in the matter was that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan loved Milady like\r\na madman, and that she did not love him at all. In an instant\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be\r\nto go home and write Milady a long letter, in which he would confess to\r\nher that he and De Wardes were, up to the present moment absolutely the\r\nsame, and that consequently he could not undertake, without committing\r\nsuicide, to kill the Comte de Wardes. But he also was spurred on by a\r\nferocious desire of vengeance. He wished to subdue this woman in his\r\nown name; and as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain\r\nsweetness in it, he could not make up his mind to renounce it.\r\n\r\nHe walked six or seven times round the Place Royale, turning at every\r\nten steps to look at the light in Milady\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, which was to be\r\nseen through the blinds. It was evident that this time the young woman\r\nwas not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nAt length the light disappeared. With this light was extinguished the\r\nlast irresolution in the heart of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. He recalled to his mind\r\nthe details of the first night, and with a beating heart and a brain on\r\nfire he re-entered the h\xc3\xb4tel and flew toward Kitty\xe2\x80\x99s chamber.\r\n\r\nThe poor girl, pale as death and trembling in all her limbs, wished to\r\ndelay her lover; but Milady, with her ear on the watch, had heard the\r\nnoise D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had made, and opening the door, said, \xe2\x80\x9cCome in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this was of such incredible immodesty, of such monstrous\r\neffrontery, that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what\r\nhe heard. He imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic\r\nintrigues one meets in dreams. He, however, darted not the less quickly\r\ntoward Milady, yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone\r\nexercises over iron.\r\n\r\nAs the door closed after them Kitty rushed toward it. Jealousy, fury,\r\noffended pride, all the passions in short that dispute the heart of an\r\noutraged woman in love, urged her to make a revelation; but she\r\nreflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having\r\nassisted in such a machination, and above all, that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan would\r\nalso be lost to her forever. This last thought of love counseled her to\r\nmake this last sacrifice.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, on his part, had gained the summit of all his wishes. It\r\nwas no longer a rival who was beloved; it was himself who was\r\napparently beloved. A secret voice whispered to him, at the bottom of\r\nhis heart, that he was but an instrument of vengeance, that he was only\r\ncaressed till he had given death; but pride, but self-love, but madness\r\nsilenced this voice and stifled its murmurs. And then our Gascon, with\r\nthat large quantity of conceit which we know he possessed, compared\r\nhimself with De Wardes, and asked himself why, after all, he should not\r\nbe beloved for himself?\r\n\r\nHe was absorbed entirely by the sensations of the moment. Milady was no\r\nlonger for him that woman of fatal intentions who had for a moment\r\nterrified him; she was an ardent, passionate mistress, abandoning\r\nherself to love which she also seemed to feel. Two hours thus glided\r\naway. When the transports of the two lovers were calmer, Milady, who\r\nhad not the same motives for forgetfulness that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had, was the\r\nfirst to return to reality, and asked the young man if the means which\r\nwere on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and De Wardes\r\nwere already arranged in his mind.\r\n\r\nBut D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, whose ideas had taken quite another course, forgot\r\nhimself like a fool, and answered gallantly that it was too late to\r\nthink about duels and sword thrusts.\r\n\r\nThis coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind\r\nterrified Milady, whose questions became more pressing.\r\n\r\nThen D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who had never seriously thought of this impossible\r\nduel, endeavored to turn the conversation; but he could not succeed.\r\nMilady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her\r\nirresistible spirit and her iron will.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising Milady to\r\nrenounce, by pardoning De Wardes, the furious projects she had formed.\r\n\r\nBut at the first word the young woman started, and exclaimed in a\r\nsharp, bantering tone, which sounded strangely in the darkness, \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\nyou afraid, dear Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot think so, dear love!\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut now, suppose\r\nthis poor Comte de Wardes were less guilty than you think him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt all events,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, seriously, \xe2\x80\x9che has deceived me, and from\r\nthe moment he deceived me, he merited death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shall die, then, since you condemn him!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in so\r\nfirm a tone that it appeared to Milady an undoubted proof of devotion.\r\nThis reassured her.\r\n\r\nWe cannot say how long the night seemed to Milady, but D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nbelieved it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through\r\nthe window blinds, and invaded the chamber with its paleness. Seeing\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan about to leave her, Milady recalled his promise to avenge\r\nher on the Comte de Wardes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut in the first place I should\r\nlike to be certain of one thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is, whether you really love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have given you proof of that, it seems to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am yours, body and soul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, my brave lover; but as you are satisfied of my love, you must,\r\nin your turn, satisfy me of yours. Is it not so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; but if you love me as much as you say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdo you not entertain a little fear on my account?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I to fear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that I may be dangerously wounded\xe2\x80\x94killed even.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are such a valiant man, and such an\r\nexpert swordsman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would not, then, prefer a method,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich\r\nwould equally avenge you while rendering the combat useless?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady looked at her lover in silence. The pale light of the first rays\r\nof day gave to her clear eyes a strangely frightful expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you now begin to hesitate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not hesitate; but I really pity this poor Comte de Wardes,\r\nsince you have ceased to love him. I think that a man must be so\r\nseverely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no\r\nother chastisement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you that I loved him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady, sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least, I am now at liberty to believe, without too much fatuity,\r\nthat you love another,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, in a caressing tone, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nrepeat that I am really interested for the count.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why _you?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I alone know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he is far from being, or rather having been, so guilty toward you\r\nas he appears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, in an anxious tone; \xe2\x80\x9cexplain yourself, for I\r\nreally cannot tell what you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she looked at D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who embraced her tenderly, with eyes\r\nwhich seemed to burn themselves away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I am a man of honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, determined to come to an\r\nend, \xe2\x80\x9cand since your love is mine, and I am satisfied I possess it\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nI do possess it, do I not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEntirely; go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I feel as if transformed\xe2\x80\x94a confession weighs on my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA confession!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had the least doubt of your love I would not make it, but you\r\nlove me, my beautiful mistress, do you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen if through excess of love I have rendered myself culpable toward\r\nyou, you will pardon me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to Milady\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nbut she evaded him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis confession,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, growing paler, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is this confession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou gave De Wardes a meeting on Thursday last in this very room, did\r\nyou not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! It is not true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, in a tone of voice so firm, and\r\nwith a countenance so unchanged, that if D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had not been in\r\nsuch perfect possession of the fact, he would have doubted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not lie, my angel,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cthat would be\r\nuseless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? Speak! you kill me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe satisfied; you are not guilty toward me, and I have already\r\npardoned you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat next? what next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe Wardes cannot boast of anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is that? You told me yourself that that ring\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ring I have! The Comte de Wardes of Thursday and the D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nof today are the same person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe imprudent young man expected a surprise, mixed with shame\xe2\x80\x94a slight\r\nstorm which would resolve itself into tears; but he was strangely\r\ndeceived, and his error was not of long duration.\r\n\r\nPale and trembling, Milady repulsed D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s attempted embrace by a\r\nviolent blow on the chest, as she sprang out of bed.\r\n\r\nIt was almost broad daylight.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan detained her by her night dress of fine India linen, to\r\nimplore her pardon; but she, with a strong movement, tried to escape.\r\nThen the cambric was torn from her beautiful shoulders; and on one of\r\nthose lovely shoulders, round and white, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan recognized, with\r\ninexpressible astonishment, the _fleur-de-lis_\xe2\x80\x94that indelible mark\r\nwhich the hand of the infamous executioner had imprinted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, loosing his hold of her dress, and\r\nremaining mute, motionless, and frozen.\r\n\r\nBut Milady felt herself denounced even by his terror. He had doubtless\r\nseen all. The young man now knew her secret, her terrible secret\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsecret she concealed even from her maid with such care, the secret of\r\nwhich all the world was ignorant, except himself.\r\n\r\nShe turned upon him, no longer like a furious woman, but like a wounded\r\npanther.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have basely betrayed me, and still more,\r\nyou have my secret! You shall die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she flew to a little inlaid casket which stood upon the dressing\r\ntable, opened it with a feverish and trembling hand, drew from it a\r\nsmall poniard, with a golden haft and a sharp thin blade, and then\r\nthrew herself with a bound upon D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\nAlthough the young man was brave, as we know, he was terrified at that\r\nwild countenance, those terribly dilated pupils, those pale cheeks, and\r\nthose bleeding lips. He recoiled to the other side of the room as he\r\nwould have done from a serpent which was crawling toward him, and his\r\nsword coming in contact with his nervous hand, he drew it almost\r\nunconsciously from the scabbard. But without taking any heed of the\r\nsword, Milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him, and did\r\nnot stop till she felt the sharp point at her throat.\r\n\r\nShe then tried to seize the sword with her hands; but D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan kept\r\nit free from her grasp, and presenting the point, sometimes at her\r\neyes, sometimes at her breast, compelled her to glide behind the\r\nbedstead, while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to\r\nKitty\xe2\x80\x99s apartment.\r\n\r\nMilady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury,\r\nscreaming in a formidable way.\r\n\r\nAs all this, however, bore some resemblance to a duel, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan began\r\nto recover himself little by little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, beautiful lady, very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, _pardieu_, if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t calm yourself, I will design a second _fleur-de-lis_ upon one of\r\nthose pretty cheeks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScoundrel, infamous scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d howled Milady.\r\n\r\nBut D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, still keeping on the defensive, drew near to Kitty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoor. At the noise they made, she in overturning the furniture in her\r\nefforts to get at him, he in screening himself behind the furniture to\r\nkeep out of her reach, Kitty opened the door. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who had\r\nunceasingly maneuvered to gain this point, was not at more than three\r\npaces from it. With one spring he flew from the chamber of Milady into\r\nthat of the maid, and quick as lightning, he slammed to the door, and\r\nplaced all his weight against it, while Kitty pushed the bolts.\r\n\r\nThen Milady attempted to tear down the doorcase, with a strength\r\napparently above that of a woman; but finding she could not accomplish\r\nthis, she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard, the point\r\nof which repeatedly glittered through the wood. Every blow was\r\naccompanied with terrible imprecations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick, Kitty, quick!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in a low voice, as soon as the\r\nbolts were fast, \xe2\x80\x9clet me get out of the h\xc3\xb4tel; for if we leave her time\r\nto turn round, she will have me killed by the servants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t go out so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are naked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, then first thinking of the costume he\r\nfound himself in, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s true. But dress me as well as you are able,\r\nonly make haste; think, my dear girl, it\xe2\x80\x99s life and death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKitty was but too well aware of that. In a turn of the hand she muffled\r\nhim up in a flowered robe, a large hood, and a cloak. She gave him some\r\nslippers, in which he placed his naked feet, and then conducted him\r\ndown the stairs. It was time. Milady had already rung her bell, and\r\nroused the whole h\xc3\xb4tel. The porter was drawing the cord at the moment\r\nMilady cried from her window, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t open!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent\r\ngesture. The moment she lost sight of him, Milady tumbled fainting into\r\nher chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVIII.\r\nHOW, WITHOUT INCOMMDING HIMSELF, ATHOS PROCURES HIS EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was so completely bewildered that without taking any heed of\r\nwhat might become of Kitty he ran at full speed across half Paris, and\r\ndid not stop till he came to Athos\xe2\x80\x99s door. The confusion of his mind,\r\nthe terror which spurred him on, the cries of some of the patrol who\r\nstarted in pursuit of him, and the hooting of the people who,\r\nnotwithstanding the early hour, were going to their work, only made him\r\nprecipitate his course.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the court, ran up the two flights to Athos\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, and\r\nknocked at the door enough to break it down.\r\n\r\nGrimaud came, rubbing his half-open eyes, to answer this noisy summons,\r\nand D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to\r\noverturn the astonished lackey.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his habitual silence, the poor lad this time found his\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHolloa, there!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you want, you strumpet? What\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nbusiness here, you hussy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan threw off his hood, and disengaged his hands from the folds\r\nof the cloak. At sight of the mustaches and the naked sword, the poor\r\ndevil perceived he had to deal with a man. He then concluded it must be\r\nan assassin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp! murder! help!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, you stupid fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man; \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; don\xe2\x80\x99t you know me? Where is your master?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Grimaud, \xe2\x80\x9cimpossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrimaud,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, coming out of his apartment in a dressing gown,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrimaud, I thought I heard you permitting yourself to speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monsieur, it is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrimaud contented himself with pointing D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan out to his master\r\nwith his finger.\r\n\r\nAthos recognized his comrade, and phlegmatic as he was, he burst into a\r\nlaugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his\r\neyes\xe2\x80\x94petticoats falling over his shoes, sleeves tucked up, and\r\nmustaches stiff with agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t laugh, my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cfor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlaugh, for upon my soul, it\xe2\x80\x99s no laughing matter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he pronounced these words with such a solemn air and with such a\r\nreal appearance of terror, that Athos eagerly seized his hand, crying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you wounded, my friend? How pale you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I have just met with a terrible adventure! Are you alone,\r\nAthos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Parbleu!_ whom do you expect to find with me at this hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well!\xe2\x80\x9d and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan rushed into Athos\xe2\x80\x99s chamber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, speak!\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter, closing the door and bolting it, that\r\nthey might not be disturbed. \xe2\x80\x9cIs the king dead? Have you killed the\r\ncardinal? You are quite upset! Come, come, tell me; I am dying with\r\ncuriosity and uneasiness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAthos,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, getting rid of his female garments, and\r\nappearing in his shirt, \xe2\x80\x9cprepare yourself to hear an incredible, an\r\nunheard-of story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but put on this dressing gown first,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Musketeer to his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could, mistaking one sleeve\r\nfor the other, so greatly was he still agitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, bending his mouth to Athos\xe2\x80\x99s ear, and\r\nlowering his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cMilady is marked with a _fleur-de-lis_ upon her\r\nshoulder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Musketeer, as if he had received a ball in his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us see,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you _sure_ that the _other_ is\r\ndead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_The other?_\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, in so stifled a voice that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nscarcely heard him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she of whom you told me one day at Amiens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos uttered a groan, and let his head sink on his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a woman of twenty-six or twenty-eight years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cis she not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlue and clear eyes, of a strange brilliancy, with black eyelids and\r\neyebrows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTall, well-made? She has lost a tooth, next to the eyetooth on the\r\nleft?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _fleur-de-lis_ is small, rosy in color, and looks as if efforts\r\nhad been made to efface it by the application of poultices?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you say she is English?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is called Milady, but she may be French. Lord de Winter is only\r\nher brother-in-law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will see her, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeware, Athos, beware. You tried to kill her; she is a woman to return\r\nyou the like, and not to fail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will not dare to say anything; that would be to denounce herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is capable of anything or everything. Did you ever see her\r\nfurious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA tigress, a panther! Ah, my dear Athos, I am greatly afraid I have\r\ndrawn a terrible vengeance on both of us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan then related all\xe2\x80\x94the mad passion of Milady and her menaces\r\nof death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right; and upon my soul, I would give my life for a hair,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cFortunately, the day after tomorrow we leave Paris. We are\r\ngoing according to all probability to La Rochelle, and once gone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will follow you to the end of the world, Athos, if she recognizes\r\nyou. Let her, then, exhaust her vengeance on me alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend, of what consequence is it if she kills me?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAthos. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you, perchance, think I set any great store by life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is something horribly mysterious under all this, Athos; this\r\nwoman is one of the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s spies, I am sure of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, take care! If the cardinal does not hold you in high\r\nadmiration for the affair of London, he entertains a great hatred for\r\nyou; but as, considering everything, he cannot accuse you openly, and\r\nas hatred must be satisfied, particularly when it\xe2\x80\x99s a cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhatred, take care of yourself. If you go out, do not go out alone; when\r\nyou eat, use every precaution. Mistrust everything, in short, even your\r\nown shadow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFortunately,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9call this will be only necessary till\r\nafter tomorrow evening, for when once with the army, we shall have, I\r\nhope, only men to dread.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cI renounce my plan of seclusion, and\r\nwherever you go, I will go with you. You must return to the Rue des\r\nFossoyeurs; I will accompany you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut however near it may be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot go thither\r\nin this guise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, and he rang the bell.\r\n\r\nGrimaud entered.\r\n\r\nAthos made him a sign to go to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s residence, and bring back\r\nsome clothes. Grimaud replied by another sign that he understood\r\nperfectly, and set off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this will not advance your outfit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cfor if I am not\r\nmistaken, you have left the best of your apparel with Milady, and she\r\nwill certainly not have the politeness to return it to you.\r\nFortunately, you have the sapphire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe jewel is yours, my dear Athos! Did you not tell me it was a family\r\njewel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my grandfather gave two thousand crowns for it, as he once told\r\nme. It formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife, and it is\r\nmagnificent. My mother gave it to me, and I, fool as I was, instead of\r\nkeeping the ring as a holy relic, gave it to this wretch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, my friend, take back this ring, to which I see you attach much\r\nvalue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take back the ring, after it has passed through the hands of that\r\ninfamous creature? Never; that ring is defiled, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSell it, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSell a jewel which came from my mother! I vow I should consider it a\r\nprofanation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPledge it, then; you can borrow at least a thousand crowns on it. With\r\nthat sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties; and\r\nwhen you are full of money again, you can redeem it, and take it back\r\ncleansed from its ancient stains, as it will have passed through the\r\nhands of usurers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a capital companion, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cyour never-failing\r\ncheerfulness raises poor souls in affliction. Well, let us pledge the\r\nring, but upon one condition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat there shall be five hundred crowns for you, and five hundred\r\ncrowns for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t dream it, Athos. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need the quarter of such a sum\xe2\x80\x94I who am\r\nstill only in the Guards\xe2\x80\x94and by selling my saddles, I shall procure it.\r\nWhat do I want? A horse for Planchet, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Besides, you forget\r\nthat I have a ring likewise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo which you attach more value, it seems, than I do to mine; at least,\r\nI have thought so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us\r\nfrom some great embarrassment, but even a great danger. It is not only\r\na valuable diamond, but it is an enchanted talisman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t at all understand you, but I believe all you say to be true.\r\nLet us return to my ring, or rather to yours. You shall take half the\r\nsum that will be advanced upon it, or I will throw it into the Seine;\r\nand I doubt, as was the case with Polycrates, whether any fish will be\r\nsufficiently complaisant to bring it back to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will take it, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Grimaud returned, accompanied by Planchet; the latter,\r\nanxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him,\r\nhad taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan dressed himself, and Athos did the same. When the two were\r\nready to go out, the latter made Grimaud the sign of a man taking aim,\r\nand the lackey immediately took down his musketoon, and prepared to\r\nfollow his master.\r\n\r\nThey arrived without accident at the Rue des Fossoyeurs. Bonacieux was\r\nstanding at the door, and looked at D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan hatefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake haste, dear lodger,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a very pretty girl\r\nwaiting for you upstairs; and you know women don\xe2\x80\x99t like to be kept\r\nwaiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Kitty!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to himself, and darted into the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nSure enough! Upon the landing leading to the chamber, and crouching\r\nagainst the door, he found the poor girl, all in a tremble. As soon as\r\nshe perceived him, she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have promised your protection; you\r\nhave promised to save me from her anger. Remember, it is you who have\r\nruined me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, to be sure, Kitty,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cbe at ease, my girl.\r\nBut what happened after my departure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I tell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lackeys were brought by the cries\r\nshe made. She was mad with passion. There exist no imprecations she did\r\nnot pour out against you. Then I thought she would remember it was\r\nthrough my chamber you had penetrated hers, and that then she would\r\nsuppose I was your accomplice; so I took what little money I had and\r\nthe best of my things, and I got away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor dear girl! But what can I do with you? I am going away the day\r\nafter tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo what you please, Monsieur Chevalier. Help me out of Paris; help me\r\nout of France!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot take you, however, to the siege of La Rochelle,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of\r\nyour acquaintance\xe2\x80\x94in your own country, for instance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear little love! In my country the ladies do without chambermaids.\r\nBut stop! I can manage your business for you. Planchet, go and find\r\nAramis. Request him to come here directly. We have something very\r\nimportant to say to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cbut why not Porthos? I should have thought\r\nthat his duchess\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Porthos\xe2\x80\x99s duchess is dressed by her husband\xe2\x80\x99s clerks,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, Kitty would not like to live in the Rue\r\naux Ours. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it so, Kitty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not care where I live,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty, \xe2\x80\x9cprovided I am well\r\nconcealed, and nobody knows where I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile, Kitty, when we are about to separate, and you are no longer\r\njealous of me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Chevalier, far off or near,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitty, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall always love\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere the devil will constancy niche itself next?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I, also,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI also. I shall always love you; be\r\nsure of that. But now answer me. I attach great importance to the\r\nquestion I am about to put to you. Did you never hear talk of a young\r\nwoman who was carried off one night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, now! Oh, Monsieur Chevalier, do you love that woman still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; it is one of my friends who loves her\xe2\x80\x94Monsieur Athos, this\r\ngentleman here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos, with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is\r\nabout to tread upon an adder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, pressing Athos\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know\r\nthe interest we both take in this poor little Madame Bonacieux.\r\nBesides, Kitty will tell nothing; will you, Kitty? You understand, my\r\ndear girl,\xe2\x80\x9d continued D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is the wife of that frightful\r\nbaboon you saw at the door as you came in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God! You remind me of my fright! If he should have known me\r\nagain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? know you again? Did you ever see that man before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came twice to Milady\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. About what time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, about fifteen or eighteen days ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yesterday evening he came again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, just before you came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Athos, we are enveloped in a network of spies. And do you\r\nbelieve he knew you again, Kitty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pulled down my hood as soon as I saw him, but perhaps it was too\r\nlate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo down, Athos\xe2\x80\x94he mistrusts you less than me\xe2\x80\x94and see if he be still at\r\nhis door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos went down and returned immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has gone,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand the house door is shut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has gone to make his report, and to say that all the pigeons are at\r\nthis moment in the dovecot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, let us all fly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cand leave nobody here but\r\nPlanchet to bring us news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA minute. Aramis, whom we have sent for!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must wait for Aramis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment Aramis entered.\r\n\r\nThe matter was all explained to him, and the friends gave him to\r\nunderstand that among all his high connections he must find a place for\r\nKitty.\r\n\r\nAramis reflected for a minute, and then said, coloring, \xe2\x80\x9cWill it be\r\nreally rendering you a service, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be grateful to you all my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Madame de Bois-Tracy asked me, for one of her friends who\r\nresides in the provinces, I believe, for a trustworthy maid. If you\r\ncan, my dear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, answer for Mademoiselle\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, monsieur, be assured that I shall be entirely devoted to the\r\nperson who will give me the means of quitting Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cthis falls out very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed\r\nwith a ring, and gave the billet to Kitty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, my dear girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know that it is not good\r\nfor any of us to be here. Therefore let us separate. We shall meet\r\nagain in better days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd whenever we find each other, in whatever place it may be,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nKitty, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will find me loving you as I love you today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDicers\xe2\x80\x99 oaths!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, while D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan went to conduct Kitty\r\ndownstairs.\r\n\r\nAn instant afterward the three young men separated, agreeing to meet\r\nagain at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock with Athos, and leaving Planchet to guard the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAramis returned home, and Athos and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan busied themselves about\r\npledging the sapphire.\r\n\r\nAs the Gascon had foreseen, they easily obtained three hundred pistoles\r\non the ring. Still further, the Jew told them that if they would sell\r\nit to him, as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings, he\r\nwould give five hundred pistoles for it.\r\n\r\nAthos and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with the activity of two soldiers and the\r\nknowledge of two connoisseurs, hardly required three hours to purchase\r\nthe entire equipment of the Musketeer. Besides, Athos was very easy,\r\nand a noble to his fingers\xe2\x80\x99 ends. When a thing suited him he paid the\r\nprice demanded, without thinking to ask for any abatement. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nwould have remonstrated at this; but Athos put his hand upon his\r\nshoulder, with a smile, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan understood that it was all very\r\nwell for such a little Gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain,\r\nbut not for a man who had the bearing of a prince. The Musketeer met\r\nwith a superb Andalusian horse, black as jet, nostrils of fire, legs\r\nclean and elegant, rising six years. He examined him, and found him\r\nsound and without blemish. They asked a thousand livres for him.\r\n\r\nHe might perhaps have been bought for less; but while D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was\r\ndiscussing the price with the dealer, Athos was counting out the money\r\non the table.\r\n\r\nGrimaud had a stout, short Picard cob, which cost three hundred livres.\r\n\r\nBut when the saddle and arms for Grimaud were purchased, Athos had not\r\na sou left of his hundred and fifty pistoles. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan offered his\r\nfriend a part of his share which he should return when convenient.\r\n\r\nBut Athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much did the Jew say he would give for the sapphire if he\r\npurchased it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive hundred pistoles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, two hundred more\xe2\x80\x94a hundred pistoles for you and a\r\nhundred pistoles for me. Well, now, that would be a real fortune to us,\r\nmy friend; let us go back to the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! will you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances; then\r\nwe shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it, so\r\nthat we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain. Go and\r\ntell him the ring is his, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and bring back the two hundred\r\npistoles with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReflect, Athos!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReady money is needful for the present time, and we must learn how to\r\nmake sacrifices. Go, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, go; Grimaud will accompany you with\r\nhis musketoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA half hour afterward, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan returned with the two thousand\r\nlivres, and without having met with any accident.\r\n\r\nIt was thus Athos found at home resources which he did not expect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIX.\r\nA VISION\r\n\r\n\r\nAt four o\xe2\x80\x99clock the four friends were all assembled with Athos. Their\r\nanxiety about their outfits had all disappeared, and each countenance\r\nonly preserved the expression of its own secret disquiet\xe2\x80\x94for behind all\r\npresent happiness is concealed a fear for the future.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Planchet entered, bringing two letters for D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\nThe one was a little billet, genteelly folded, with a pretty seal in\r\ngreen wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green branch.\r\n\r\nThe other was a large square epistle, resplendent with the terrible\r\narms of his Eminence the cardinal duke.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the little letter the heart of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan bounded, for\r\nhe believed he recognized the handwriting, and although he had seen\r\nthat writing but once, the memory of it remained at the bottom of his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nHe therefore seized the little epistle, and opened it eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the letter, \xe2\x80\x9con Thursday next, at from six to seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nin the evening, on the road to Chaillot, and look carefully into the\r\ncarriages that pass; but if you have any consideration for your own\r\nlife or that of those who love you, do not speak a single word, do not\r\nmake a movement which may lead anyone to believe you have recognized\r\nher who exposes herself to everything for the sake of seeing you but\r\nfor an instant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo signature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a snare,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t go, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I recognize the writing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be counterfeit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cBetween six and seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the\r\nroad of Chaillot is quite deserted; you might as well go and ride in\r\nthe forest of Bondy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose we all go,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the devil! They won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndevour us all four, four lackeys, horses, arms, and all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd besides, it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if it is a woman who writes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cand that woman desires\r\nnot to be seen, remember, you compromise her, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; which is not\r\nthe part of a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will remain in the background,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cand he will advance\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a\r\ngallop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthey will miss me; if they fire we will ride\r\nafter the carriage, and exterminate those who may be in it. They must\r\nbe enemies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cbattle. Besides, we must try our own\r\narms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah, let us enjoy that pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, with his mild and\r\ncareless manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cit is half past four, and we have\r\nscarcely time to be on the road of Chaillot by six.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, if we go out too late, nobody will see us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand that will be a pity. Let us get ready, gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this second letter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cyou forget that; it appears to\r\nme, however, that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened. For\r\nmy part, I declare, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, I think it of much more consequence\r\nthan the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into\r\nyour bosom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan blushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9clet us see, gentlemen, what are his Eminence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncommands,\xe2\x80\x9d and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan unsealed the letter and read,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM. d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, of the king\xe2\x80\x99s Guards, company Dessessart, is expected\r\nat the Palais-Cardinal this evening, at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLA HOUDINIERE, _Captain of the Guards_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s a rendezvous much more serious than\r\nthe other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go to the second after attending the first,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne is for seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and the other for eight; there will be time\r\nfor both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHum! I would not go at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis. \xe2\x80\x9cA gallant knight cannot\r\ndecline a rendezvous with a lady; but a prudent gentleman may excuse\r\nhimself from not waiting on his Eminence, particularly when he has\r\nreason to believe he is not invited to make his compliments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am of Aramis\xe2\x80\x99s opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI have already received by Monsieur\r\nde Cavois a similar invitation from his Eminence. I neglected it, and\r\non the morrow a serious misfortune happened to me\xe2\x80\x94Constance\r\ndisappeared. Whatever may ensue, I will go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are determined,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cdo so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the Bastille?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah! you will get me out if they put me there,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure we will,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis and Porthos, with admirable\r\npromptness and decision, as if that were the simplest thing in the\r\nworld, \xe2\x80\x9cto be sure we will get you out; but meantime, as we are to set\r\noff the day after tomorrow, you would do much better not to risk this\r\nBastille.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us do better than that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cdo not let us leave him\r\nduring the whole evening. Let each of us wait at a gate of the palace\r\nwith three Musketeers behind him; if we see a close carriage, at all\r\nsuspicious in appearance, come out, let us fall upon it. It is a long\r\ntime since we have had a skirmish with the Guards of Monsieur the\r\nCardinal; Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville must think us dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo a certainty, Athos,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were meant to be a general\r\nof the army! What do you think of the plan, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmirable!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young men in chorus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cI will run to the h\xc3\xb4tel, and engage our comrades\r\nto hold themselves in readiness by eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock; the rendezvous, the\r\nPlace du Palais-Cardinal. Meantime, you see that the lackeys saddle the\r\nhorses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no horse,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that is of no consequence, I\r\ncan take one of Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not worth while,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can have one of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of yours! how many have you, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Certes_,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are the best-mounted poet of France or\r\nNavarre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear Aramis, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want three horses? I cannot comprehend\r\nwhat induced you to buy three!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore I only purchased two,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe third, then, fell from the clouds, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of\r\nlivery, who would not tell me in whose service he was, and who said he\r\nhad received orders from his master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr his mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat makes no difference,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, coloring; \xe2\x80\x9cand who affirmed,\r\nas I said, that he had received orders from his master or mistress to\r\nplace the horse in my stable, without informing me whence it came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only to poets that such things happen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in that case, we can manage famously,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cwhich\r\nof the two horses will you ride\xe2\x80\x94that which you bought or the one that\r\nwas given to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat which was given to me, assuredly. You cannot for a moment\r\nimagine, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, that I would commit such an offense toward\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe unknown giver,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr the mysterious benefactress,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one you bought will then become useless to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearly so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you selected it yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the greatest care. The safety of the horseman, you know, depends\r\nalmost always upon the goodness of his horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, transfer it to me at the price it cost you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to make you the offer, my dear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, giving you all\r\nthe time necessary for repaying me such a trifle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much did it cost you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight hundred livres.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are forty double pistoles, my dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\ntaking the sum from his pocket; \xe2\x80\x9cI know that is the coin in which you\r\nwere paid for your poems.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are rich, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRich? Richest, my dear fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend your saddle, then, to the h\xc3\xb4tel of the Musketeers, and your horse\r\ncan be brought back with ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; but it is already five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, so make haste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour afterward Porthos appeared at the end of the Rue\r\nF\xc3\xa9rou on a very handsome _genet_. Mousqueton followed him upon an\r\nAuvergne horse, small but very handsome. Porthos was resplendent with\r\njoy and pride.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Aramis made his appearance at the other end of the\r\nstreet upon a superb English charger. Bazin followed him upon a roan,\r\nholding by the halter a vigorous Mecklenburg horse; this was\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s mount.\r\n\r\nThe two Musketeers met at the gate. Athos and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan watched their\r\napproach from the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have a magnificent horse there,\r\nPorthos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cit is the one that ought to have been sent to\r\nme at first. A bad joke of the husband\xe2\x80\x99s substituted the other; but the\r\nhusband has been punished since, and I have obtained full\r\nsatisfaction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPlanchet and Grimaud appeared in their turn, leading their masters\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsteeds. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and Athos put themselves into saddle with their\r\ncompanions, and all four set forward; Athos upon a horse he owed to a\r\nwoman, Aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress, Porthos on a horse he\r\nowed to his procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan on a horse he owed to his\r\ngood fortune\xe2\x80\x94the best mistress possible.\r\n\r\nThe lackeys followed.\r\n\r\nAs Porthos had foreseen, the cavalcade produced a good effect; and if\r\nMme. Coquenard had met Porthos and seen what a superb appearance he\r\nmade upon his handsome Spanish _genet_, she would not have regretted\r\nthe bleeding she had inflicted upon the strongbox of her husband.\r\n\r\nNear the Louvre the four friends met with M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, who was\r\nreturning from St. Germain; he stopped them to offer his compliments\r\nupon their appointments, which in an instant drew round them a hundred\r\ngapers.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville of\r\nthe letter with the great red seal and the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s arms. It is well\r\nunderstood that he did not breathe a word about the other.\r\n\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville approved of the resolution he had adopted, and assured\r\nhim that if on the morrow he did not appear, he himself would undertake\r\nto find him, let him be where he might.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the clock of La Samaritaine struck six; the four friends\r\npleaded an engagement, and took leave of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\r\n\r\nA short gallop brought them to the road of Chaillot; the day began to\r\ndecline, carriages were passing and repassing. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, keeping at\r\nsome distance from his friends, darted a scrutinizing glance into every\r\ncarriage that appeared, but saw no face with which he was acquainted.\r\n\r\nAt length, after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was\r\nbeginning to thicken, a carriage appeared, coming at a quick pace on\r\nthe road of S\xc3\xa8vres. A presentiment instantly told D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan that this\r\ncarriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous; the\r\nyoung man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently.\r\nAlmost instantly a female head was put out at the window, with two\r\nfingers placed upon her mouth, either to enjoin silence or to send him\r\na kiss. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan uttered a slight cry of joy; this woman, or rather\r\nthis apparition\xe2\x80\x94for the carriage passed with the rapidity of a\r\nvision\xe2\x80\x94was Mme. Bonacieux.\r\n\r\nBy an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given,\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan put his horse into a gallop, and in a few strides overtook\r\nthe carriage; but the window was hermetically closed, the vision had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan then remembered the injunction: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you value your own life\r\nor that of those who love you, remain motionless, and as if you had\r\nseen nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, therefore, trembling not for himself but for the poor woman\r\nwho had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this\r\nrendezvous.\r\n\r\nThe carriage pursued its way, still going at a great pace, till it\r\ndashed into Paris, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan remained fixed to the spot, astounded and not knowing what\r\nto think. If it was Mme. Bonacieux and if she was returning to Paris,\r\nwhy this fugitive rendezvous, why this simple exchange of a glance, why\r\nthis lost kiss? If, on the other side, it was not she\xe2\x80\x94which was still\r\nquite possible\xe2\x80\x94for the little light that remained rendered a mistake\r\neasy\xe2\x80\x94might it not be the commencement of some plot against him through\r\nthe allurement of this woman, for whom his love was known?\r\n\r\nHis three companions joined him. All had plainly seen a woman\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nappear at the window, but none of them, except Athos, knew Mme.\r\nBonacieux. The opinion of Athos was that it was indeed she; but less\r\npreoccupied by that pretty face than D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, he had fancied he saw\r\na second head, a man\xe2\x80\x99s head, inside the carriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that be the case,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are doubtless\r\ntransporting her from one prison to another. But what can they intend\r\nto do with the poor creature, and how shall I ever meet her again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cremember that it is the dead alone with\r\nwhom we are not likely to meet again on this earth. You know something\r\nof that, as well as I do, I think. Now, if your mistress is not dead,\r\nif it is she we have just seen, you will meet with her again some day\r\nor other. And perhaps, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d added he, with that misanthropic tone\r\nwhich was peculiar to him, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps sooner than you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalf past seven had sounded. The carriage had been twenty minutes\r\nbehind the time appointed. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s friends reminded him that he\r\nhad a visit to pay, but at the same time bade him observe that there\r\nwas yet time to retract.\r\n\r\nBut D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious. He had made\r\nup his mind that he would go to the Palais-Cardinal, and that he would\r\nlearn what his Eminence had to say to him. Nothing could turn him from\r\nhis purpose.\r\n\r\nThey reached the Rue St. Honor\xc3\xa9, and in the Place du Palais-Cardinal\r\nthey found the twelve invited Musketeers, walking about in expectation\r\nof their comrades. There only they explained to them the matter in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMusketeers, in which it was known he would one day take his place; he\r\nwas considered beforehand as a comrade. It resulted from these\r\nantecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which\r\nthey met; besides, it would not be unlikely that they would have an\r\nopportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn,\r\nand for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready.\r\n\r\nAthos divided them into three groups, assumed the command of one, gave\r\nthe second to Aramis, and the third to Porthos; and then each group\r\nwent and took their watch near an entrance.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, on his part, entered boldly at the principal gate.\r\n\r\nAlthough he felt himself ably supported, the young man was not without\r\na little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase, step by step.\r\nHis conduct toward Milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery, and\r\nhe was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between\r\nthat woman and the cardinal. Still further, De Wardes, whom he had\r\ntreated so ill, was one of the tools of his Eminence; and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nknew that while his Eminence was terrible to his enemies, he was\r\nstrongly attached to his friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf De Wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal, which is not\r\nto be doubted, and if he has recognized me, as is probable, I may\r\nconsider myself almost as a condemned man,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, shaking\r\nhis head. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why has he waited till now? That\xe2\x80\x99s all plain enough.\r\nMilady has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief\r\nwhich renders her so interesting, and this last offense has made the\r\ncup overflow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFortunately,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, \xe2\x80\x9cmy good friends are down yonder, and they\r\nwill not allow me to be carried away without a struggle. Nevertheless,\r\nMonsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s company of Musketeers alone cannot maintain a\r\nwar against the cardinal, who disposes of the forces of all France, and\r\nbefore whom the queen is without power and the king without will.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, my friend, you are brave, you are prudent, you have\r\nexcellent qualities; but the women will ruin you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antechamber. He\r\nplaced his letter in the hands of the usher on duty, who led him into\r\nthe waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace.\r\n\r\nIn this waiting room were five or six of the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s Guards, who\r\nrecognized D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and knowing that it was he who had wounded\r\nJussac, they looked upon him with a smile of singular meaning.\r\n\r\nThis smile appeared to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to be of bad augury. Only, as our\r\nGascon was not easily intimidated\xe2\x80\x94or rather, thanks to a great pride\r\nnatural to the men of his country, he did not allow one easily to see\r\nwhat was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all\r\nresembled fear\xe2\x80\x94he placed himself haughtily in front of Messieurs the\r\nGuards, and waited with his hand on his hip, in an attitude by no means\r\ndeficient in majesty.\r\n\r\nThe usher returned and made a sign to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to follow him. It\r\nappeared to the young man that the Guards, on seeing him depart,\r\nchuckled among themselves.\r\n\r\nHe traversed a corridor, crossed a grand saloon, entered a library, and\r\nfound himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing.\r\n\r\nThe usher introduced him, and retired without speaking a word.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan remained standing and examined this man.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge\r\nexamining his papers; but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote,\r\nor rather corrected, lines of unequal length, scanning the words on his\r\nfingers. He saw then that he was with a poet. At the end of an instant\r\nthe poet closed his manuscript, upon the cover of which was written\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMirame, a Tragedy in Five Acts,\xe2\x80\x9d and raised his head.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan recognized the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XL.\r\nA TERRIBLE VISION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript, his cheek upon his\r\nhand, and looked intently at the young man for a moment. No one had a\r\nmore searching eye than the Cardinal de Richelieu, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan felt\r\nthis glance run through his veins like a fever.\r\n\r\nHe however kept a good countenance, holding his hat in his hand and\r\nawaiting the good pleasure of his Eminence, without too much assurance,\r\nbut also without too much humility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9care you a D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan from B\xc3\xa9arn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are several branches of the D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnans at Tarbes and in its\r\nenvirons,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal; \xe2\x80\x9cto which do you belong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the son of him who served in the Religious Wars under the great\r\nKing Henry, the father of his gracious Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well. It is you who set out seven or eight months ago from\r\nyour country to seek your fortune in the capital?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou came through Meung, where something befell you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t very well\r\nknow what, but still something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthis was what happened to me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, never mind!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the cardinal, with a smile which\r\nindicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were recommended to Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, were you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monseigneur; but in that unfortunate affair at Meung\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letter was lost,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his Eminence; \xe2\x80\x9cyes, I know that. But\r\nMonsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville is a skilled physiognomist, who knows men at first\r\nsight; and he placed you in the company of his brother-in-law, Monsieur\r\nDessessart, leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter\r\nthe Musketeers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur is correctly informed,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince that time many things have happened to you. You were walking one\r\nday behind the Chartreux, when it would have been better if you had\r\nbeen elsewhere. Then you took with your friends a journey to the waters\r\nof Forges; they stopped on the road, but you continued yours. That is\r\nall very simple: you had business in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, quite confused, \xe2\x80\x9cI went\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHunting at Windsor, or elsewhere\xe2\x80\x94that concerns nobody. I know, because\r\nit is my office to know everything. On your return you were received by\r\nan august personage, and I perceive with pleasure that you preserve the\r\nsouvenir she gave you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan placed his hand upon the queen\xe2\x80\x99s diamond, which he wore, and\r\nquickly turned the stone inward; but it was too late.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day after that, you received a visit from Cavois,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the\r\ncardinal. \xe2\x80\x9cHe went to desire you to come to the palace. You have not\r\nreturned that visit, and you were wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur, I feared I had incurred disgrace with your Eminence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could that be, monsieur? Could you incur my displeasure by having\r\nfollowed the orders of your superiors with more intelligence and\r\ncourage than another would have done? It is the people who do not obey\r\nthat I punish, and not those who, like you, obey\xe2\x80\x94but too well. As a\r\nproof, remember the date of the day on which I had you bidden to come\r\nto me, and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was the very evening when the abduction of Mme. Bonacieux took\r\nplace. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan trembled; and he likewise recollected that during the\r\npast half hour the poor woman had passed close to him, without doubt\r\ncarried away by the same power that had caused her disappearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cas I have heard nothing of you for\r\nsome time past, I wished to know what you were doing. Besides, you owe\r\nme some thanks. You must yourself have remarked how much you have been\r\nconsidered in all the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan bowed with respect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9carose not only from a feeling of\r\nnatural equity, but likewise from a plan I have marked out with respect\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan became more and more astonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wished to explain this plan to you on the day you received my first\r\ninvitation; but you did not come. Fortunately, nothing is lost by this\r\ndelay, and you are now about to hear it. Sit down there, before me,\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; you are gentleman enough not to listen standing.\xe2\x80\x9d And the\r\ncardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man, who was\r\nso astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from\r\nhis interlocutor before he obeyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are brave, Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d continued his Eminence; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\nprudent, which is still better. I like men of head and heart. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nafraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cBy men of heart I mean men of courage. But\r\nyoung as you are, and scarcely entering into the world, you have\r\npowerful enemies; if you do not take great heed, they will destroy\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, monseigneur!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cvery easily, no doubt, for\r\nthey are strong and well supported, while I am alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s true; but alone as you are, you have done much already,\r\nand will do still more, I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt. Yet you have need, I believe, to\r\nbe guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken; for, if I\r\nmistake not, you came to Paris with the ambitious idea of making your\r\nfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am at the age of extravagant hopes, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no extravagant hopes but for fools, monsieur, and you are a\r\nman of understanding. Now, what would you say to an ensign\xe2\x80\x99s commission\r\nin my Guards, and a company after the campaign?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou accept it, do you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with an embarrassed air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? You refuse?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the cardinal, with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s Guards, monseigneur, and I have no reason to be\r\ndissatisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it appears to me that my Guards\xe2\x80\x94mine\xe2\x80\x94are also his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nGuards; and whoever serves in a French corps serves the king.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur, your Eminence has ill understood my words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want a pretext, do you not? I comprehend. Well, you have this\r\nexcuse: advancement, the opening campaign, the opportunity which I\r\noffer you\xe2\x80\x94so much for the world. As regards yourself, the need of\r\nprotection; for it is fit you should know, Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, that I\r\nhave received heavy and serious complaints against you. You do not\r\nconsecrate your days and nights wholly to the king\xe2\x80\x99s service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan colored.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, placing his hand upon a bundle of papers,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have here a whole pile which concerns you. I know you to be a man of\r\nresolution; and your services, well directed, instead of leading you to\r\nill, might be very advantageous to you. Come; reflect, and decide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour goodness confounds me, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nam conscious of a greatness of soul in your Eminence that makes me mean\r\nas an earthworm; but since Monseigneur permits me to speak freely\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, I will presume to say that all my friends are in the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMusketeers and Guards, and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies\r\nare in the service of your Eminence; I should, therefore, be ill\r\nreceived here and ill regarded there if I accepted what Monseigneur\r\noffers me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you happen to entertain the haughty idea that I have not yet made\r\nyou an offer equal to your value?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the cardinal, with a smile of\r\ndisdain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur, your Eminence is a hundred times too kind to me; and on\r\nthe contrary, I think I have not proved myself worthy of your goodness.\r\nThe siege of La Rochelle is about to be resumed, monseigneur. I shall\r\nserve under the eye of your Eminence, and if I have the good fortune to\r\nconduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention,\r\nthen I shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify\r\nthe protection with which you honor me. Everything is best in its time,\r\nmonseigneur. Hereafter, perhaps, I shall have the right of _giving_\r\nmyself; at present I shall appear to sell myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, you refuse to serve me, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal,\r\nwith a tone of vexation, through which, however, might be seen a sort\r\nof esteem; \xe2\x80\x9cremain free, then, and guard your hatreds and your\r\nsympathies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish you any ill; but you\r\nmust be aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense\r\nour friends. We owe nothing to our enemies; and let me give you a piece\r\nof advice; take care of yourself, Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, for from the\r\nmoment I withdraw my hand from behind you, I would not give an _obolus_\r\nfor your life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will try to do so, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Gascon, with a noble\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember at a later period and at a certain moment, if any mischance\r\nshould happen to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richelieu, significantly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it was I\r\nwho came to seek you, and that I did all in my power to prevent this\r\nmisfortune befalling you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall entertain, whatever may happen,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, placing his\r\nhand upon his breast and bowing, \xe2\x80\x9can eternal gratitude toward your\r\nEminence for that which you now do for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let it be, then, as you have said, Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; we shall\r\nsee each other again after the campaign. I will have my eye upon you,\r\nfor I shall be there,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cardinal, pointing with his finger\r\nto a magnificent suit of armor he was to wear, \xe2\x80\x9cand on our return,\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94we will settle our account!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cspare me the weight of your\r\ndispleasure. Remain neutral monseigneur, if you find that I act as\r\nbecomes a gallant man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richelieu, \xe2\x80\x9cif I shall be able to say to you at\r\nanother time what I have said to you today, I promise you to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis last expression of Richelieu\xe2\x80\x99s conveyed a terrible doubt; it\r\nalarmed D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan more than a menace would have done, for it was a\r\nwarning. The cardinal, then, was seeking to preserve him from some\r\nmisfortune which threatened him. He opened his mouth to reply, but with\r\na haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed him.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan went out, but at the door his heart almost failed him, and\r\nhe felt inclined to return. Then the noble and severe countenance of\r\nAthos crossed his mind; if he made the compact with the cardinal which\r\nhe required, Athos would no more give him his hand\xe2\x80\x94Athos would renounce\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt was this fear that restrained him, so powerful is the influence of a\r\ntruly great character on all that surrounds it.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered, and\r\nfound Athos and the four Musketeers waiting his appearance, and\r\nbeginning to grow uneasy. With a word, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan reassured them; and\r\nPlanchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep\r\nguard longer, as his master had come out safe from the Palais-Cardinal.\r\n\r\nReturned home with Athos, Aramis and Porthos inquired eagerly the cause\r\nof the strange interview; but D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan confined himself to telling\r\nthem that M. de Richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter\r\ninto his guards with the rank of ensign, and that he had refused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you were right,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Aramis and Porthos, with one voice.\r\n\r\nAthos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing. But when they\r\nwere alone he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have done that which you ought to have done,\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; but perhaps you have been wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan sighed deeply, for this voice responded to a secret voice of\r\nhis soul, which told him that great misfortunes awaited him.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan went to take leave of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville. At that time it was\r\nbelieved that the separation of the Musketeers and the Guards would be\r\nbut momentary, the king holding his Parliament that very day and\r\nproposing to set out the day after. M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville contented himself\r\nwith asking D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan if he could do anything for him, but D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nanswered that he was supplied with all he wanted.\r\n\r\nThat night brought together all those comrades of the Guards of M.\r\nDessessart and the company of Musketeers of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville who had been\r\naccustomed to associate together. They were parting to meet again when\r\nit pleased God, and if it pleased God. That night, then, was somewhat\r\nriotous, as may be imagined. In such cases extreme preoccupation is\r\nonly to be combated by extreme carelessness.\r\n\r\nAt the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated; the\r\nMusketeers hastening to the h\xc3\xb4tel of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, the Guards to that\r\nof M. Dessessart. Each of the captains then led his company to the\r\nLouvre, where the king held his review.\r\n\r\nThe king was dull and appeared ill, which detracted a little from his\r\nusual lofty bearing. In fact, the evening before, a fever had seized\r\nhim in the midst of the Parliament, while he was holding his Bed of\r\nJustice. He had, not the less, decided upon setting out that same\r\nevening; and in spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to\r\nhim, he persisted in having the review, hoping by setting it at\r\ndefiance to conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon him.\r\n\r\nThe review over, the Guards set forward alone on their march, the\r\nMusketeers waiting for the king, which allowed Porthos time to go and\r\ntake a turn in his superb equipment in the Rue aux Ours.\r\n\r\nThe procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine\r\nhorse. She loved Porthos too dearly to allow him to part thus; she made\r\nhim a sign to dismount and come to her. Porthos was magnificent; his\r\nspurs jingled, his cuirass glittered, his sword knocked proudly against\r\nhis ample limbs. This time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh,\r\nsuch a real ear clipper did Porthos appear.\r\n\r\nThe Musketeer was introduced to M. Coquenard, whose little gray eyes\r\nsparkled with anger at seeing his cousin all blazing new. Nevertheless,\r\none thing afforded him inward consolation; it was expected by everybody\r\nthat the campaign would be a severe one. He whispered a hope to himself\r\nthat this beloved relative might be killed in the field.\r\n\r\nPorthos paid his compliments to M. Coquenard and bade him farewell. M.\r\nCoquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities. As to Mme. Coquenard,\r\nshe could not restrain her tears; but no evil impressions were taken\r\nfrom her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her\r\nrelatives, about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\nBut the real adieux were made in Mme. Coquenard\xe2\x80\x99s chamber; they were\r\nheartrending.\r\n\r\nAs long as the procurator\xe2\x80\x99s wife could follow him with her eyes, she\r\nwaved her handkerchief to him, leaning so far out of the window as to\r\nlead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself. Porthos\r\nreceived all these attentions like a man accustomed to such\r\ndemonstrations, only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his\r\nhat gracefully, and waved it to her as a sign of adieu.\r\n\r\nOn his part Aramis wrote a long letter. To whom? Nobody knew. Kitty,\r\nwho was to set out that evening for Tours, was waiting in the next\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nAthos sipped the last bottle of his Spanish wine.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was defiling with his company. Arriving at\r\nthe Faubourg St. Antoine, he turned round to look gaily at the\r\nBastille; but as it was the Bastille alone he looked at, he did not\r\nobserve Milady, who, mounted upon a light chestnut horse, designated\r\nhim with her finger to two ill-looking men who came close up to the\r\nranks to take notice of him. To a look of interrogation which they\r\nmade, Milady replied by a sign that it was he. Then, certain that there\r\ncould be no mistake in the execution of her orders, she started her\r\nhorse and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe two men followed the company, and on leaving the Faubourg St.\r\nAntoine, mounted two horses properly equipped, which a servant without\r\nlivery had waiting for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLI.\r\nTHE SIEGE OF LA ROCHELLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Siege of La Rochelle was one of the great political events of the\r\nreign of Louis XIII., and one of the great military enterprises of the\r\ncardinal. It is, then, interesting and even necessary that we should\r\nsay a few words about it, particularly as many details of this siege\r\nare connected in too important a manner with the story we have\r\nundertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence.\r\n\r\nThe political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were\r\nextensive. Let us unfold them first, and then pass on to the private\r\nplans which perhaps had not less influence upon his Eminence than the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nOf the important cities given up by Henry IV. to the Huguenots as places\r\nof safety, there only remained La Rochelle. It became necessary,\r\ntherefore, to destroy this last bulwark of Calvinism\xe2\x80\x94a dangerous leaven\r\nwith which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly\r\nmingling.\r\n\r\nSpaniards, Englishmen, and Italian malcontents, adventurers of all\r\nnations, and soldiers of fortune of every sect, flocked at the first\r\nsummons under the standard of the Protestants, and organized themselves\r\nlike a vast association, whose branches diverged freely over all parts\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\nLa Rochelle, which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the\r\nother Calvinist cities, was, then, the focus of dissensions and\r\nambition. Moreover, its port was the last in the kingdom of France open\r\nto the English, and by closing it against England, our eternal enemy,\r\nthe cardinal completed the work of Joan of Arc and the Duc de Guise.\r\n\r\nThus Bassompierre, who was at once Protestant and Catholic\xe2\x80\x94Protestant\r\nby conviction and Catholic as commander of the order of the Holy Ghost;\r\nBassompierre, who was a German by birth and a Frenchman at heart\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nshort, Bassompierre, who had a distinguished command at the siege of La\r\nRochelle, said, in charging at the head of several other Protestant\r\nnobles like himself, \xe2\x80\x9cYou will see, gentlemen, that we shall be fools\r\nenough to take La Rochelle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Bassompierre was right. The cannonade of the Isle of R\xc3\xa9 presaged to\r\nhim the dragonnades of the C\xc3\xa9vennes; the taking of La Rochelle was the\r\npreface to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.\r\n\r\nWe have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and\r\nsimplifying minister, which belong to history, the chronicler is forced\r\nto recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival.\r\n\r\nRichelieu, as everyone knows, had loved the queen. Was this love a\r\nsimple political affair, or was it naturally one of those profound\r\npassions which Anne of Austria inspired in those who approached her?\r\nThat we are not able to say; but at all events, we have seen, by the\r\nanterior developments of this story, that Buckingham had the advantage\r\nover him, and in two or three circumstances, particularly that of the\r\ndiamond studs, had, thanks to the devotedness of the three Musketeers\r\nand the courage and conduct of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, cruelly mystified him.\r\n\r\nIt was, then, Richelieu\xe2\x80\x99s object, not only to get rid of an enemy of\r\nFrance, but to avenge himself on a rival; but this vengeance must be\r\ngrand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his\r\nhand, as his weapon for combat, the forces of a kingdom.\r\n\r\nRichelieu knew that in combating England he combated Buckingham; that\r\nin triumphing over England he triumphed over Buckingham\xe2\x80\x94in short, that\r\nin humiliating England in the eyes of Europe he humiliated Buckingham\r\nin the eyes of the queen.\r\n\r\nOn his side Buckingham, in pretending to maintain the honor of England,\r\nwas moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal. Buckingham\r\nalso was pursuing a private vengeance. Buckingham could not under any\r\npretense be admitted into France as an ambassador; he wished to enter\r\nit as a conqueror.\r\n\r\nIt resulted from this that the real stake in this game, which two most\r\npowerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men, was\r\nsimply a kind look from Anne of Austria.\r\n\r\nThe first advantage had been gained by Buckingham. Arriving\r\nunexpectedly in sight of the Isle of R\xc3\xa9 with ninety vessels and nearly\r\ntwenty thousand men, he had surprised the Comte de Toiras, who\r\ncommanded for the king in the Isle, and he had, after a bloody\r\nconflict, effected his landing.\r\n\r\nAllow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the Baron de\r\nChantal; that the Baron de Chantal left a little orphan girl eighteen\r\nmonths old, and that this little girl was afterward Mme. de S\xc3\xa9vign\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Toiras retired into the citadel St. Martin with his\r\ngarrison, and threw a hundred men into a little fort called the fort of\r\nLa Pr\xc3\xa9e.\r\n\r\nThis event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal; and till the\r\nking and he could take the command of the siege of La Rochelle, which\r\nwas determined, he had sent Monsieur to direct the first operations,\r\nand had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the\r\ntheater of war. It was of this detachment, sent as a vanguard, that our\r\nfriend D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan formed a part.\r\n\r\nThe king, as we have said, was to follow as soon as his Bed of Justice\r\nhad been held; but on rising from his Bed of Justice on the\r\ntwenty-eighth of June, he felt himself attacked by fever. He was,\r\nnotwithstanding, anxious to set out; but his illness becoming more\r\nserious, he was forced to stop at Villeroy.\r\n\r\nNow, whenever the king halted, the Musketeers halted. It followed that\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who was as yet purely and simply in the Guards, found\r\nhimself, for the time at least, separated from his good friends\xe2\x80\x94Athos,\r\nPorthos, and Aramis. This separation, which was no more than an\r\nunpleasant circumstance, would have certainly become a cause of serious\r\nuneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was\r\nsurrounded.\r\n\r\nHe, however, arrived without accident in the camp established before La\r\nRochelle, on the tenth of the month of September of the year 1627.\r\n\r\nEverything was in the same state. The Duke of Buckingham and his\r\nEnglish, masters of the Isle of R\xc3\xa9, continued to besiege, but without\r\nsuccess, the citadel St. Martin and the fort of La Pr\xc3\xa9e; and\r\nhostilities with La Rochelle had commenced, two or three days before,\r\nabout a fort which the Duc d\xe2\x80\x99Angoul\xc3\xaame had caused to be constructed\r\nnear the city.\r\n\r\nThe Guards, under the command of M. Dessessart, took up their quarters\r\nat the Minimes; but, as we know, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, possessed with ambition to\r\nenter the Musketeers, had formed but few friendships among his\r\ncomrades, and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nHis reflections were not very cheerful. From the time of his arrival in\r\nParis, he had been mixed up with public affairs; but his own private\r\naffairs had made no great progress, either in love or fortune. As to\r\nlove, the only woman he could have loved was Mme. Bonacieux; and Mme.\r\nBonacieux had disappeared, without his being able to discover what had\r\nbecome of her. As to fortune, he had made\xe2\x80\x94he, humble as he was\xe2\x80\x94an enemy\r\nof the cardinal; that is to say, of a man before whom trembled the\r\ngreatest men of the kingdom, beginning with the king.\r\n\r\nThat man had the power to crush him, and yet he had not done so. For a\r\nmind so perspicuous as that of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, this indulgence was a light\r\nby which he caught a glimpse of a better future.\r\n\r\nThen he had made himself another enemy, less to be feared, he thought;\r\nbut nevertheless, he instinctively felt, not to be despised. This enemy\r\nwas Milady.\r\n\r\nIn exchange for all this, he had acquired the protection and good will\r\nof the queen; but the favor of the queen was at the present time an\r\nadditional cause of persecution, and her protection, as it was known,\r\nprotected badly\xe2\x80\x94as witness Chalais and Mme. Bonacieux.\r\n\r\nWhat he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond, worth five or\r\nsix thousand livres, which he wore on his finger; and even this\r\ndiamond\xe2\x80\x94supposing that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in his projects of ambition, wished\r\nto keep it, to make it someday a pledge for the gratitude of the\r\nqueen\xe2\x80\x94had not in the meanwhile, since he could not part with it, more\r\nvalue than the gravel he trod under his feet.\r\n\r\nWe say the gravel he trod under his feet, for D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan made these\r\nreflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which\r\nled from the camp to the village of Angoutin. Now, these reflections\r\nhad led him further than he intended, and the day was beginning to\r\ndecline when, by the last ray of the setting sun, he thought he saw the\r\nbarrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding. He comprehended\r\nthat the musket had not come there of itself, and that he who bore it\r\nhad not concealed himself behind a hedge with any friendly intentions.\r\nHe determined, therefore, to direct his course as clear from it as he\r\ncould when, on the opposite side of the road, from behind a rock, he\r\nperceived the extremity of another musket.\r\n\r\nThis was evidently an ambuscade.\r\n\r\nThe young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw, with a certain\r\ndegree of inquietude, that it was leveled in his direction; but as soon\r\nas he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless, he threw\r\nhimself upon the ground. At the same instant the gun was fired, and he\r\nheard the whistling of a ball pass over his head.\r\n\r\nNo time was to be lost. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan sprang up with a bound, and at the\r\nsame instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the\r\nvery spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous\r\ndeath in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a\r\nsingle step. Besides, courage was out of the question here; D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nhad fallen into an ambush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is a third shot,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a lost man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe immediately, therefore, took to his heels and ran toward the camp,\r\nwith the swiftness of the young men of his country, so renowned for\r\ntheir agility; but whatever might be his speed, the first who fired,\r\nhaving had time to reload, fired a second shot, and this time so well\r\naimed that it struck his hat, and carried it ten paces from him.\r\n\r\nAs he, however, had no other hat, he picked up this as he ran, and\r\narrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of breath. He sat down\r\nwithout saying a word to anybody, and began to reflect.\r\n\r\nThis event might have three causes:\r\n\r\nThe first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the\r\nRochellais, who might not be sorry to kill one of his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s Guards,\r\nbecause it would be an enemy the less, and this enemy might have a\r\nwell-furnished purse in his pocket.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan took his hat, examined the hole made by the ball, and shook\r\nhis head. The ball was not a musket ball\xe2\x80\x94it was an arquebus ball. The\r\naccuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon\r\nhad been employed. This could not, then, be a military ambuscade, as\r\nthe ball was not of the regular caliber.\r\n\r\nThis might be a kind remembrance of Monsieur the Cardinal. It may be\r\nobserved that at the very moment when, thanks to the ray of the sun, he\r\nperceived the gun barrel, he was thinking with astonishment on the\r\nforbearance of his Eminence with respect to him.\r\n\r\nBut D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan again shook his head. For people toward whom he had but\r\nto put forth his hand, his Eminence had rarely recourse to such means.\r\n\r\nIt might be a vengeance of Milady; that was most probable.\r\n\r\nHe tried in vain to remember the faces or dress of the assassins; he\r\nhad escaped so rapidly that he had not had leisure to notice anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my poor friends!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cwhere are you? And that\r\nyou should fail me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan passed a very bad night. Three or four times he started up,\r\nimagining that a man was approaching his bed for the purpose of\r\nstabbing him. Nevertheless, day dawned without darkness having brought\r\nany accident.\r\n\r\nBut D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not\r\nrelinquished.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan remained all day in his quarters, assigning as a reason to\r\nhimself that the weather was bad.\r\n\r\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning, the drums beat to arms. The Duc\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Orl\xc3\xa9ans visited the posts. The guards were under arms, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\ntook his place in the midst of his comrades.\r\n\r\nMonsieur passed along the front of the line; then all the superior\r\nofficers approached him to pay their compliments, M. Dessessart,\r\ncaptain of the Guards, as well as the others.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of a minute or two, it appeared to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan that M.\r\nDessessart made him a sign to approach. He waited for a fresh gesture\r\non the part of his superior, for fear he might be mistaken; but this\r\ngesture being repeated, he left the ranks, and advanced to receive\r\norders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous\r\nmission, but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it;\r\nand I made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in\r\nreadiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, my captain!\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who wished for nothing better\r\nthan an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the\r\nlieutenant general.\r\n\r\nIn fact the Rochellais had made a _sortie_ during the night, and had\r\nretaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two\r\ndays before. The matter was to ascertain, by reconnoitering, how the\r\nenemy guarded this bastion.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a few minutes Monsieur raised his voice, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant for this mission three or four volunteers, led by a man who can be\r\ndepended upon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to the man to be depended upon, I have him under my hand,\r\nmonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. Dessessart, pointing to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cand as to the\r\nfour or five volunteers, Monsieur has but to make his intentions known,\r\nand the men will not be wanting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour men of good will who will risk being killed with me!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, raising his sword.\r\n\r\nTwo of his comrades of the Guards immediately sprang forward, and two\r\nother soldiers having joined them, the number was deemed sufficient.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan declined all others, being unwilling to take the first\r\nchance from those who had the priority.\r\n\r\nIt was not known whether, after the taking of the bastion, the\r\nRochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it; the object then\r\nwas to examine the place near enough to verify the reports.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan set out with his four companions, and followed the trench;\r\nthe two Guards marched abreast with him, and the two soldiers followed\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nThey arrived thus, screened by the lining of the trench, till they came\r\nwithin a hundred paces of the bastion. There, on turning round,\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan perceived that the two soldiers had disappeared.\r\n\r\nHe thought that, beginning to be afraid, they had stayed behind, and he\r\ncontinued to advance.\r\n\r\nAt the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about\r\nsixty paces of the bastion. They saw no one, and the bastion seemed\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nThe three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they\r\nshould proceed any further, when all at once a circle of smoke\r\nenveloped the giant of stone, and a dozen balls came whistling around\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and his companions.\r\n\r\nThey knew all they wished to know; the bastion was guarded. A longer\r\nstay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and his two companions turned their backs, and commenced a\r\nretreat which resembled a flight.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a\r\nrampart, one of the Guardsmen fell. A ball had passed through his\r\nbreast. The other, who was safe and sound, continued his way toward the\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus, and stooped\r\nto raise him and assist him in regaining the lines; but at this moment\r\ntwo shots were fired. One ball struck the head of the already-wounded\r\nguard, and the other flattened itself against a rock, after having\r\npassed within two inches of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\nThe young man turned quickly round, for this attack could not have come\r\nfrom the bastion, which was hidden by the angle of the trench. The idea\r\nof the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind, and\r\nwith them he remembered the assassins of two evenings before. He\r\nresolved this time to know with whom he had to deal, and fell upon the\r\nbody of his comrade as if he were dead.\r\n\r\nHe quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty\r\npaces of him; they were the heads of the two soldiers. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had\r\nnot been deceived; these two men had only followed for the purpose of\r\nassassinating him, hoping that the young man\xe2\x80\x99s death would be placed to\r\nthe account of the enemy.\r\n\r\nAs he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime, they came\r\nup to him with the purpose of making sure. Fortunately, deceived by\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s trick, they neglected to reload their guns.\r\n\r\nWhen they were within ten paces of him, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who in falling had\r\ntaken care not to let go his sword, sprang up close to them.\r\n\r\nThe assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without\r\nhaving killed their man, they should be accused by him; therefore their\r\nfirst idea was to join the enemy. One of them took his gun by the\r\nbarrel, and used it as he would a club. He aimed a terrible blow at\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who avoided it by springing to one side; but by this\r\nmovement he left a passage free to the bandit, who darted off toward\r\nthe bastion. As the Rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of\r\nthe intentions of the man they saw coming toward them, they fired upon\r\nhim, and he fell, struck by a ball which broke his shoulder.\r\n\r\nMeantime D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier,\r\nattacking him with his sword. The conflict was not long; the wretch had\r\nnothing to defend himself with but his discharged arquebus. The sword\r\nof the Guardsman slipped along the barrel of the now-useless weapon,\r\nand passed through the thigh of the assassin, who fell.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do not kill me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the bandit. \xe2\x80\x9cPardon, pardon, my officer,\r\nand I will tell you all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked the young man, withholding his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; if you think existence worth anything to a man of twenty, as you\r\nare, and who may hope for everything, being handsome and brave, as you\r\nare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWretch,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cspeak quickly! Who employed you to\r\nassassinate me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman whom I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but who is called Milady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know this woman, how do you know her name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy comrade knows her, and called her so. It was with him she agreed,\r\nand not with me; he even has in his pocket a letter from that person,\r\nwho attaches great importance to you, as I have heard him say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how did you become concerned in this villainous affair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe proposed to me to undertake it with him, and I agreed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how much did she give you for this fine enterprise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hundred louis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, come!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cshe thinks I am worth\r\nsomething. A hundred louis? Well, that was a temptation for two\r\nwretches like you. I understand why you accepted it, and I grant you my\r\npardon; but upon one condition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the soldier, uneasy at perceiving that all was not\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his\r\npocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the bandit, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is only another way of killing me. How\r\ncan I go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it, or I swear\r\nyou shall die by my hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon, monsieur; pity! In the name of that young lady you love, and\r\nwhom you perhaps believe dead but who is not!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the bandit,\r\nthrowing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his hand\xe2\x80\x94for he began\r\nto lose his strength with his blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do you know there is a young woman whom I love, and that I\r\nbelieved that woman dead?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy that letter which my comrade has in his pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I must have that letter. So no\r\nmore delay, no more hesitation; or else whatever may be my repugnance\r\nto soiling my sword a second time with the blood of a wretch like you,\r\nI swear by my faith as an honest man\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and at these words D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nmade so fierce a gesture that the wounded man sprang up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, stop!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, regaining strength by force of terror. \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\ngo\xe2\x80\x94I will go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan took the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s arquebus, made him go on before him, and\r\nurged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his sword.\r\n\r\nIt was a frightful thing to see this wretch, leaving a long track of\r\nblood on the ground he passed over, pale with approaching death, trying\r\nto drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice,\r\nwhich lay twenty paces from him.\r\n\r\nTerror was so strongly painted on his face, covered with a cold sweat,\r\nthat D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan took pity on him, and casting upon him a look of\r\ncontempt, \xe2\x80\x9cStop,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI will show you the difference between a\r\nman of courage and such a coward as you. Stay where you are; I will go\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with a light step, an eye on the watch, observing the movements of\r\nthe enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground,\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier.\r\n\r\nThere were two means of gaining his object\xe2\x80\x94to search him on the spot,\r\nor to carry him away, making a buckler of his body, and search him in\r\nthe trench.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan preferred the second means, and lifted the assassin onto his\r\nshoulders at the moment the enemy fired.\r\n\r\nA slight shock, the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the\r\nflesh, a last cry, a convulsion of agony, proved to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan that the\r\nwould-be assassin had saved his life.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan regained the trench, and threw the corpse beside the wounded\r\nman, who was as pale as death.\r\n\r\nThen he began to search. A leather pocketbook, a purse, in which was\r\nevidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received, with a dice\r\nbox and dice, completed the possessions of the dead man.\r\n\r\nHe left the box and dice where they fell, threw the purse to the\r\nwounded man, and eagerly opened the pocketbook.\r\n\r\nAmong some unimportant papers he found the following letter, that which\r\nhe had sought at the risk of his life:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince you have lost sight of that woman and she is now in safety in\r\nthe convent, which you should never have allowed her to reach, try, at\r\nleast, not to miss the man. If you do, you know that my hand stretches\r\nfar, and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have\r\nfrom me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nNo signature. Nevertheless it was plain the letter came from Milady. He\r\nconsequently kept it as a piece of evidence, and being in safety behind\r\nthe angle of the trench, he began to interrogate the wounded man. He\r\nconfessed that he had undertaken with his comrade\xe2\x80\x94the same who was\r\nkilled\xe2\x80\x94to carry off a young woman who was to leave Paris by the\r\nBarri\xc3\xa8re de La Villette; but having stopped to drink at a cabaret, they\r\nhad missed the carriage by ten minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what were you to do with that woman?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with\r\nanguish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were to have conveyed her to a h\xc3\xb4tel in the Place Royale,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nwounded man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the place\xe2\x80\x94Milady\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nresidence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for\r\nvengeance urged this woman on to destroy him, as well as all who loved\r\nhim, and how well she must be acquainted with the affairs of the court,\r\nsince she had discovered all. There could be no doubt she owed this\r\ninformation to the cardinal.\r\n\r\nBut amid all this he perceived, with a feeling of real joy, that the\r\nqueen must have discovered the prison in which poor Mme. Bonacieux was\r\nexplaining her devotion, and that she had freed her from that prison;\r\nand the letter he had received from the young woman, and her passage\r\nalong the road of Chaillot like an apparition, were now explained.\r\n\r\nThen also, as Athos had predicted, it became possible to find Mme.\r\nBonacieux, and a convent was not impregnable.\r\n\r\nThis idea completely restored clemency to his heart. He turned toward\r\nthe wounded man, who had watched with intense anxiety all the various\r\nexpressions of his countenance, and holding out his arm to him, said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, I will not abandon you thus. Lean upon me, and let us return to\r\nthe camp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut is it not to have me hanged?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have my word,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cfor the second time I give you your\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wounded man sank upon his knees, to again kiss the feet of his\r\npreserver; but D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who had no longer a motive for staying so\r\nnear the enemy, abridged the testimonials of his gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe Guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the\r\ndeath of his four companions. They were therefore much astonished and\r\ndelighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe\r\nand sound.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a _sortie_\r\nwhich he improvised. He described the death of the other soldier, and\r\nthe perils they had encountered. This recital was for him the occasion\r\nof veritable triumph. The whole army talked of this expedition for a\r\nday, and Monsieur paid him his compliments upon it. Besides this, as\r\nevery great action bears its recompense with it, the brave exploit of\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost.\r\nIn fact, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan believed that he might be tranquil, as one of his\r\ntwo enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests.\r\n\r\nThis tranquillity proved one thing\xe2\x80\x94that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan did not yet know\r\nMilady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLII.\r\nTHE ANJOU WINE\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the most disheartening news of the king\xe2\x80\x99s health, a report of his\r\nconvalescence began to prevail in the camp; and as he was very anxious\r\nto be in person at the siege, it was said that as soon as he could\r\nmount a horse he would set forward.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Monsieur, who knew that from one day to the other he might\r\nexpect to be removed from his command by the Duc d\xe2\x80\x99Angoul\xc3\xaame, by\r\nBassompierre, or by Schomberg, who were all eager for his post, did but\r\nlittle, lost his days in wavering, and did not dare to attempt any\r\ngreat enterprise to drive the English from the Isle of R\xc3\xa9, where they\r\nstill besieged the citadel St. Martin and the fort of La Pr\xc3\xa9e, as on\r\ntheir side the French were besieging La Rochelle.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, as we have said, had become more tranquil, as always\r\nhappens after a past danger, particularly when the danger seems to have\r\nvanished. He only felt one uneasiness, and that was at not hearing any\r\ntidings from his friends.\r\n\r\nBut one morning at the commencement of the month of November everything\r\nwas explained to him by this letter, dated from Villeroy:\r\n\r\nM. D\xe2\x80\x99ARTAGNAN, MM. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, after having had an\r\nentertainment at my house and enjoying themselves very much, created\r\nsuch a disturbance that the provost of the castle, a rigid man, has\r\nordered them to be confined for some days; but I accomplish the order\r\nthey have given me by forwarding to you a dozen bottles of my Anjou\r\nwine, with which they are much pleased. They are desirous that you\r\nshould drink to their health in their favorite wine. I have done this,\r\nand am, monsieur, with great respect,\r\n\r\n\r\nYour very humble and obedient servant,\r\nGODEAU, _Purveyor of the Musketeers_\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all well!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cThey think of me in their\r\npleasures, as I thought of them in my troubles. Well, I will certainly\r\ndrink to their health with all my heart, but I will not drink alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan went among those Guardsmen with whom he had formed\r\ngreater intimacy than with the others, to invite them to enjoy with him\r\nthis present of delicious Anjou wine which had been sent him from\r\nVilleroy.\r\n\r\nOne of the two Guardsmen was engaged that evening, and another the\r\nnext, so the meeting was fixed for the day after that.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, on his return, sent the twelve bottles of wine to the\r\nrefreshment room of the Guards, with strict orders that great care\r\nshould be taken of it; and then, on the day appointed, as the dinner\r\nwas fixed for midday D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan sent Planchet at nine in the morning to\r\nassist in preparing everything for the entertainment.\r\n\r\nPlanchet, very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord,\r\nthought he would make all ready, like an intelligent man; and with this\r\nview called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nguests, named Fourreau, and the false soldier who had tried to kill\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and who, belonging to no corps, had entered into the service\r\nof D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, or rather of Planchet, after D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had saved his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe hour of the banquet being come, the two guards arrived, took their\r\nplaces, and the dishes were arranged on the table. Planchet waited,\r\ntowel on arm; Fourreau uncorked the bottles; and Brisemont, which was\r\nthe name of the convalescent, poured the wine, which was a little\r\nshaken by its journey, carefully into decanters. Of this wine, the\r\nfirst bottle being a little thick at the bottom, Brisemont poured the\r\nlees into a glass, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan desired him to drink it, for the poor\r\ndevil had not yet recovered his strength.\r\n\r\nThe guests having eaten the soup, were about to lift the first glass of\r\nwine to their lips, when all at once the cannon sounded from Fort Louis\r\nand Fort Neuf. The Guardsmen, imagining this to be caused by some\r\nunexpected attack, either of the besieged or the English, sprang to\r\ntheir swords. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, not less forward than they, did likewise, and\r\nall ran out, in order to repair to their posts.\r\n\r\nBut scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of\r\nthe cause of this noise. Cries of \xe2\x80\x9cLive the king! Live the cardinal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nresounded on every side, and the drums were beaten in all directions.\r\n\r\nIn short, the king, impatient, as has been said, had come by forced\r\nmarches, and had that moment arrived with all his household and a\r\nreinforcement of ten thousand troops. His Musketeers proceeded and\r\nfollowed him. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, placed in line with his company, saluted with\r\nan expressive gesture his three friends, whose eyes soon discovered\r\nhim, and M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, who detected him at once.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of reception over, the four friends were soon in one\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pardieu!_\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou could not have arrived in better\r\ntime; the dinner cannot have had time to get cold! Can it, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded the young man, turning to the two Guards, whom he introduced to\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cit appears we are feasting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are no women at your dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any drinkable wine in your tavern?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _pardieu!_ there is yours, my dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur wine!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, astonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that you sent me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe sent you wine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know very well\xe2\x80\x94the wine from the hills of Anjou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know what brand you are talking about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wine you prefer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in the absence of champagne and chambertin, you must content\r\nyourselves with that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so, connoisseurs in wine as we are, we have sent you some Anjou\r\nwine?\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly, it is the wine that was sent by your order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn our account?\xe2\x80\x9d said the three Musketeers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you send this wine, Aramis?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; and you, Porthos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; and you, Athos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it was not you, it was your purveyor,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur purveyor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your purveyor, Godeau\xe2\x80\x94the purveyor of the Musketeers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith! never mind where it comes from,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9clet us taste\r\nit, and if it is good, let us drink it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t let us drink wine which comes from an unknown\r\nsource.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, Athos,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cDid none of you charge your\r\npurveyor, Godeau, to send me some wine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! And yet you say he has sent you some as from us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is his letter,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and he presented the note to his\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not his writing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cI am acquainted with it; before\r\nwe left Villeroy I settled the accounts of the regiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA false letter altogether,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have not been\r\ndisciplined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, in a reproachful tone, \xe2\x80\x9chow could you\r\nbelieve that we had made a disturbance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan grew pale, and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou alarmest me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, who never used _thee_ and _thou_ but\r\nupon very particular occasions, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook you, my friends!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9ca horrible suspicion crosses\r\nmy mind! Can this be another vengeance of that woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was now Athos who turned pale.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan rushed toward the refreshment room, the three Musketeers and\r\nthe two Guards following him.\r\n\r\nThe first object that met the eyes of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan on entering the room\r\nwas Brisemont, stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\nPlanchet and Fourreau, as pale as death, were trying to give him\r\nsuccor; but it was plain that all assistance was useless\xe2\x80\x94all the\r\nfeatures of the dying man were distorted with agony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, on perceiving D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cah! this is frightful! You\r\npretend to pardon me, and you poison me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cI, wretch? What do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say that it was you who gave me the wine; I say that it was you who\r\ndesired me to drink it. I say you wished to avenge yourself on me, and\r\nI say that it is horrible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not think so, Brisemont,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cdo not think so. I\r\nswear to you, I protest\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but God is above! God will punish you! My God, grant that he may\r\none day suffer what I suffer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon the Gospel,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, throwing himself down by the dying\r\nman, \xe2\x80\x9cI swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that I was going to\r\ndrink of it as you did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the soldier, and he expired amid horrible\r\ntortures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrightful! frightful!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Athos, while Porthos broke the bottles\r\nand Aramis gave orders, a little too late, that a confessor should be\r\nsent for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou come once more to save my life,\r\nnot only mine but that of these gentlemen. Gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he,\r\naddressing the Guardsmen, \xe2\x80\x9cI request you will be silent with regard to\r\nthis adventure. Great personages may have had a hand in what you have\r\nseen, and if talked about, the evil would only recoil upon us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Planchet, more dead than alive, \xe2\x80\x9cah,\r\nmonsieur, what an escape I have had!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, sirrah! you were going to drink my wine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the health of the king, monsieur; I was going to drink a small\r\nglass of it if Fourreau had not told me I was called.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d said Fourreau, whose teeth chattered with terror, \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to\r\nget him out of the way that I might drink myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, addressing the Guardsmen, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may easily\r\ncomprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken\r\nplace; so accept my excuses, and put off the party till another day, I\r\nbeg of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two Guardsmen courteously accepted D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s excuses, and\r\nperceiving that the four friends desired to be alone, retired.\r\n\r\nWhen the young Guardsman and the three Musketeers were without\r\nwitnesses, they looked at one another with an air which plainly\r\nexpressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9clet us leave this chamber; the dead\r\nare not agreeable company, particularly when they have died a violent\r\ndeath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlanchet,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI commit the corpse of this poor devil to\r\nyour care. Let him be interred in holy ground. He committed a crime, it\r\nis true; but he repented of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the four friends quit the room, leaving to Planchet and Fourreau\r\nthe duty of paying mortuary honors to Brisemont.\r\n\r\nThe host gave them another chamber, and served them with fresh eggs and\r\nsome water, which Athos went himself to draw at the fountain. In a few\r\nwords, Porthos and Aramis were posted as to the situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see, my dear friend, that this\r\nis war to the death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, \xe2\x80\x9cI perceive that plainly; but do you really\r\nbelieve it is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, I confess I still doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the _fleur-de-lis_ on her shoulder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is some Englishwoman who has committed a crime in France, and has\r\nbeen branded in consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAthos, she is your wife, I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9conly\r\nreflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but I should think the other must be dead, I hanged her so\r\neffectually.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan who now shook his head in his turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in either case, what is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, one cannot remain thus, with a sword hanging eternally\r\nover his head,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must extricate ourselves from this\r\nposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen! You must try to see her, and have an explanation with her. Say\r\nto her: \xe2\x80\x98Peace or war! My word as a gentleman never to say anything of\r\nyou, never to do anything against you; on your side, a solemn oath to\r\nremain neutral with respect to me. If not, I will apply to the\r\nchancellor, I will apply to the king, I will apply to the hangman, I\r\nwill move the courts against you, I will denounce you as branded, I\r\nwill bring you to trial; and if you are acquitted, well, by the faith\r\nof a gentleman, I will kill you at the corner of some wall, as I would\r\na mad dog.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like the means well enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cbut where and how to\r\nmeet with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime, dear friend, time brings round opportunity; opportunity is the\r\nmartingale of man. The more we have ventured the more we gain, when we\r\nknow how to wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cGod has preserved us hitherto, God will preserve us\r\nstill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we. Besides, we are men; and everything considered, it is our lot\r\nto risk our lives; but _she_,\xe2\x80\x9d asked he, in an undertone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat she?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConstance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Bonacieux! Ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s true!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor friend, I had\r\nforgotten you were in love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9chave you not learned by the letter you found\r\non the wretched corpse that she is in a convent? One may be very\r\ncomfortable in a convent; and as soon as the siege of La Rochelle is\r\nterminated, I promise you on my part\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cgood! Yes, my dear Aramis, we all know that your\r\nviews have a religious tendency.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am only temporarily a Musketeer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, humbly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is some time since we heard from his mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, in a\r\nlow voice. \xe2\x80\x9cBut take no notice; we know all about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cit appears to me that the means are very\r\nsimple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say she is in a convent?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. As soon as the siege is over, we\xe2\x80\x99ll carry her off from that\r\nconvent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we must first learn what convent she is in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think I have it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you say, dear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\nthat it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe so, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case Porthos will assist us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how so, if you please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, by your marchioness, your duchess, your princess. She must have a\r\nlong arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, placing a finger on his lips. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe her to\r\nbe a cardinalist; she must know nothing of the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cI take upon myself to obtain intelligence of\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Aramis?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the three friends. \xe2\x80\x9cYou! And how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the queen\xe2\x80\x99s almoner, to whom I am very intimately allied,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAramis, coloring.\r\n\r\nAnd on this assurance, the four friends, who had finished their modest\r\nrepast, separated, with the promise of meeting again that evening.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan returned to less important affairs, and the three Musketeers\r\nrepaired to the king\xe2\x80\x99s quarters, where they had to prepare their\r\nlodging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIII.\r\nTHE SIGN OF THE RED DOVECOT\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the king, who, with more reason than the cardinal, showed his\r\nhatred for Buckingham, although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to\r\nmeet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive\r\nthe English from the Isle of R\xc3\xa9, and afterward to press the siege of La\r\nRochelle; but notwithstanding his earnest wish, he was delayed by the\r\ndissensions which broke out between MM. Bassompierre and Schomberg,\r\nagainst the Duc d\xe2\x80\x99Angoul\xc3\xaame.\r\n\r\nMM. Bassompierre and Schomberg were marshals of France, and claimed\r\ntheir right of commanding the army under the orders of the king; but\r\nthe cardinal, who feared that Bassompierre, a Huguenot at heart, might\r\npress but feebly the English and Rochellais, his brothers in religion,\r\nsupported the Duc d\xe2\x80\x99Angoul\xc3\xaame, whom the king, at his instigation, had\r\nnamed lieutenant general. The result was that to prevent MM.\r\nBassompierre and Schomberg from deserting the army, a separate command\r\nhad to be given to each. Bassompierre took up his quarters on the north\r\nof the city, between Leu and Dompierre; the Duc d\xe2\x80\x99Angoul\xc3\xaame on the\r\neast, from Dompierre to Perigny; and M. de Schomberg on the south, from\r\nPerigny to Angoutin.\r\n\r\nThe quarters of Monsieur were at Dompierre; the quarters of the king\r\nwere sometimes at Estr\xc3\xa9e, sometimes at Jarrie; the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s quarters\r\nwere upon the downs, at the bridge of La Pierre, in a simple house\r\nwithout any entrenchment. So that Monsieur watched Bassompierre; the\r\nking, the Duc d\xe2\x80\x99Angoul\xc3\xaame; and the cardinal, M. de Schomberg.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this organization was established, they set about driving\r\nthe English from the Isle.\r\n\r\nThe juncture was favorable. The English, who require, above everything,\r\ngood living in order to be good soldiers, only eating salt meat and bad\r\nbiscuit, had many invalids in their camp. Still further, the sea, very\r\nrough at this period of the year all along the sea coast, destroyed\r\nevery day some little vessel; and the shore, from the point of\r\nl\xe2\x80\x99Aiguillon to the trenches, was at every tide literally covered with\r\nthe wrecks of pinnacles, _roberges_, and feluccas. The result was that\r\neven if the king\xe2\x80\x99s troops remained quietly in their camp, it was\r\nevident that some day or other, Buckingham, who only continued in the\r\nIsle from obstinacy, would be obliged to raise the siege.\r\n\r\nBut as M. de Toiras gave information that everything was preparing in\r\nthe enemy\xe2\x80\x99s camp for a fresh assault, the king judged that it would be\r\nbest to put an end to the affair, and gave the necessary orders for a\r\ndecisive action.\r\n\r\nAs it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege, but on the\r\ncontrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected\r\nwith the story we are relating, we will content ourselves with saying\r\nin two words that the expedition succeeded, to the great astonishment\r\nof the king and the great glory of the cardinal. The English, repulsed\r\nfoot by foot, beaten in all encounters, and defeated in the passage of\r\nthe Isle of Loie, were obliged to re-embark, leaving on the field of\r\nbattle two thousand men, among whom were five colonels, three\r\nlieutenant colonels, two hundred and fifty captains, twenty gentlemen\r\nof rank, four pieces of cannon, and sixty flags, which were taken to\r\nParis by Claude de St. Simon, and suspended with great pomp in the\r\narches of Notre Dame.\r\n\r\nTe Deums were chanted in camp, and afterward throughout France.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal was left free to carry on the siege, without having, at\r\nleast at the present, anything to fear on the part of the English.\r\n\r\nBut it must be acknowledged, this response was but momentary. An envoy\r\nof the Duke of Buckingham, named Montague, was taken, and proof was\r\nobtained of a league between the German Empire, Spain, England, and\r\nLorraine. This league was directed against France.\r\n\r\nStill further, in Buckingham\xe2\x80\x99s lodging, which he had been forced to\r\nabandon more precipitately than he expected, papers were found which\r\nconfirmed this alliance and which, as the cardinal asserts in his\r\nmemoirs, strongly compromised Mme. de Chevreuse and consequently the\r\nqueen.\r\n\r\nIt was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell, for one is\r\nnot a despotic minister without responsibility. All, therefore, of the\r\nvast resources of his genius were at work night and day, engaged in\r\nlistening to the least report heard in any of the great kingdoms of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal was acquainted with the activity, and more particularly\r\nthe hatred, of Buckingham. If the league which threatened France\r\ntriumphed, all his influence would be lost. Spanish policy and Austrian\r\npolicy would have their representatives in the cabinet of the Louvre,\r\nwhere they had as yet but partisans; and he, Richelieu\xe2\x80\x94the French\r\nminister, the national minister\xe2\x80\x94would be ruined. The king, even while\r\nobeying him like a child, hated him as a child hates his master, and\r\nwould abandon him to the personal vengeance of Monsieur and the queen.\r\nHe would then be lost, and France, perhaps, with him. All this must be\r\nprepared against.\r\n\r\nCourtiers, becoming every instant more numerous, succeeded one another,\r\nday and night, in the little house of the bridge of La Pierre, in which\r\nthe cardinal had established his residence.\r\n\r\nThere were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was\r\neasy to perceive they belonged to the church militant; women a little\r\ninconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could\r\nnot entirely conceal their rounded forms; and peasants with blackened\r\nhands but with fine limbs, savoring of the man of quality a league off.\r\n\r\nThere were also less agreeable visits\xe2\x80\x94for two or three times reports\r\nwere spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself\r\nwho set these bungling assassins to work, in order to have, if wanted,\r\nthe right of using reprisals; but we must not believe everything\r\nministers say, nor everything their enemies say.\r\n\r\nThese attempts did not prevent the cardinal, to whom his most\r\ninveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery, from making\r\nnocturnal excursions, sometimes to communicate to the Duc d\xe2\x80\x99Angoul\xc3\xaame\r\nimportant orders, sometimes to confer with the king, and sometimes to\r\nhave an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home.\r\n\r\nOn their part the Musketeers, who had not much to do with the siege,\r\nwere not under very strict orders and led a joyous life. This was the\r\nmore easy for our three companions in particular; for being friends of\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, they obtained from him special permission to be absent\r\nafter the closing of the camp.\r\n\r\nNow, one evening when D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who was in the trenches, was not able\r\nto accompany them, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, mounted on their battle\r\nsteeds, enveloped in their war cloaks, with their hands upon their\r\npistol butts, were returning from a drinking place called the Red\r\nDovecot, which Athos had discovered two days before upon the route to\r\nJarrie, following the road which led to the camp and quite on their\r\nguard, as we have stated, for fear of an ambuscade, when, about a\r\nquarter of a league from the village of Boisnau, they fancied they\r\nheard the sound of horses approaching them. They immediately all three\r\nhalted, closed in, and waited, occupying the middle of the road. In an\r\ninstant, and as the moon broke from behind a cloud, they saw at a\r\nturning of the road two horsemen who, on perceiving them, stopped in\r\ntheir turn, appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their\r\nroute or go back. The hesitation created some suspicion in the three\r\nfriends, and Athos, advancing a few paces in front of the others, cried\r\nin a firm voice, \xe2\x80\x9cWho goes there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho goes there, yourselves?\xe2\x80\x9d replied one of the horsemen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not an answer,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cWho goes there? Answer, or we\r\ncharge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeware of what you are about, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d said a clear voice which\r\nseemed accustomed to command.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is some superior officer making his night rounds,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you wish, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the same voice, in the same commanding tone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer in your turn, or you may repent of your disobedience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKing\xe2\x80\x99s Musketeers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, more and more convinced that he who\r\ninterrogated them had the right to do so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat company?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompany of Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdvance, and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three companions advanced rather humbly\xe2\x80\x94for all were now convinced\r\nthat they had to do with someone more powerful than themselves\xe2\x80\x94leaving\r\nAthos the post of speaker.\r\n\r\nOne of the two riders, he who had spoken second, was ten paces in front\r\nof his companion. Athos made a sign to Porthos and Aramis also to\r\nremain in the rear, and advanced alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour pardon, my officer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we were ignorant with whom\r\nwe had to do, and you may see that we were keeping good guard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour name?\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, who covered a part of his face with his\r\ncloak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut yourself, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, who began to be annoyed by this\r\ninquisition, \xe2\x80\x9cgive me, I beg you, the proof that you have the right to\r\nquestion me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour name?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the cavalier a second time, letting his cloak\r\nfall, and leaving his face uncovered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur the Cardinal!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the stupefied Musketeer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour name?\xe2\x80\x9d cried his Eminence, for the third time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAthos,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Musketeer.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal made a sign to his attendant, who drew near. \xe2\x80\x9cThese three\r\nMusketeers shall follow us,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in an undertone. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not\r\nwilling it should be known I have left the camp; and if they follow us\r\nwe shall be certain they will tell nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are gentlemen, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9crequire our parole, and\r\ngive yourself no uneasiness. Thank God, we can keep a secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a quick ear, Monsieur Athos,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal; \xe2\x80\x9cbut now\r\nlisten to this. It is not from mistrust that I request you to follow\r\nme, but for my security. Your companions are no doubt Messieurs Porthos\r\nand Aramis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your Eminence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, while the two Musketeers who had\r\nremained behind advanced hat in hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you. I know you are\r\nnot quite my friends, and I am sorry you are not so; but I know you are\r\nbrave and loyal gentlemen, and that confidence may be placed in you.\r\nMonsieur Athos, do me, then, the honor to accompany me; you and your\r\ntwo friends, and then I shall have an escort to excite envy in his\r\nMajesty, if we should meet him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three Musketeers bowed to the necks of their horses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, upon my honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cyour Eminence is right in taking us\r\nwith you; we have seen several ill-looking faces on the road, and we\r\nhave even had a quarrel at the Red Dovecot with four of those faces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA quarrel, and what for, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal; \xe2\x80\x9cyou know I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like quarrelers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is the reason why I have the honor to inform your Eminence of\r\nwhat has happened; for you might learn it from others, and upon a false\r\naccount believe us to be in fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have been the results of your quarrel?\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal,\r\nknitting his brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend, Aramis, here, has received a slight sword wound in the arm,\r\nbut not enough to prevent him, as your Eminence may see, from mounting\r\nto the assault tomorrow, if your Eminence orders an escalade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you\r\nthus,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, be frank, gentlemen, you have settled\r\naccounts with somebody! Confess; you know I have the right of giving\r\nabsolution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, monseigneur?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not even draw my sword, but I took\r\nhim who offended me round the body, and threw him out of the window. It\r\nappears that in falling,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Athos, with some hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nbroke his thigh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal; \xe2\x80\x9cand you, Monsieur Porthos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, monseigneur, knowing that dueling is prohibited\xe2\x80\x94I seized a bench,\r\nand gave one of those brigands such a blow that I believe his shoulder\r\nis broken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal; \xe2\x80\x9cand you, Monsieur Aramis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur, being of a very mild disposition, and being, likewise, of\r\nwhich Monseigneur perhaps is not aware, about to enter into orders, I\r\nendeavored to appease my comrades, when one of these wretches gave me a\r\nwound with a sword, treacherously, across my left arm. Then I admit my\r\npatience failed me; I drew my sword in my turn, and as he came back to\r\nthe charge, I fancied I felt that in throwing himself upon me, he let\r\nit pass through his body. I only know for a certainty that he fell; and\r\nit seemed to me that he was borne away with his two companions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cthree men placed _hors de\r\ncombat_ in a cabaret squabble! You don\xe2\x80\x99t do your work by halves. And\r\npray what was this quarrel about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese fellows were drunk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cand knowing there was a lady\r\nwho had arrived at the cabaret this evening, they wanted to force her\r\ndoor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForce her door!\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cand for what purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo do her violence, without doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cI have had the honor\r\nof informing your Eminence that these men were drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was this lady young and handsome?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the cardinal, with a\r\ncertain degree of anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe did not see her, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did not see her? Ah, very well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cardinal, quickly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did well to defend the honor of a woman; and as I am going to the\r\nRed Dovecot myself, I shall know if you have told me the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, haughtily, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are gentlemen, and to save\r\nour heads we would not be guilty of a falsehood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore I do not doubt what you say, Monsieur Athos, I do not doubt\r\nit for a single instant; but,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, \xe2\x80\x9cto change the conversation,\r\nwas this lady alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lady had a cavalier shut up with her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cbut as\r\nnotwithstanding the noise, this cavalier did not show himself, it is to\r\nbe presumed that he is a coward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Judge not rashly\xe2\x80\x99, says the Gospel,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cardinal.\r\n\r\nAthos bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, gentlemen, that\xe2\x80\x99s well,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the cardinal. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what\r\nI wish to know; follow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence, who again enveloped\r\nhis face in his cloak, and put his horse in motion, keeping from eight\r\nto ten paces in advance of his four companions.\r\n\r\nThey soon arrived at the silent, solitary inn. No doubt the host knew\r\nwhat illustrious visitor was expected, and had consequently sent\r\nintruders out of the way.\r\n\r\nTen paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the\r\nthree Musketeers to halt. A saddled horse was fastened to the window\r\nshutter. The cardinal knocked three times, and in a peculiar manner.\r\n\r\nA man, enveloped in a cloak, came out immediately, and exchanged some\r\nrapid words with the cardinal; after which he mounted his horse, and\r\nset off in the direction of Surg\xc3\xa8res, which was likewise the way to\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdvance, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have told me the truth, my gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, addressing the\r\nMusketeers, \xe2\x80\x9cand it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening\r\nbe not advantageous to you. In the meantime, follow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cardinal alighted; the three Musketeers did likewise. The cardinal\r\nthrew the bridle of his horse to his esquire; the three Musketeers\r\nfastened the horses to the shutters.\r\n\r\nThe host stood at the door. For him, the cardinal was only an officer\r\ncoming to visit a lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can\r\nwait near a good fire?\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal.\r\n\r\nThe host opened the door of a large room, in which an old stove had\r\njust been replaced by a large and excellent chimney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have this,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cardinal. \xe2\x80\x9cEnter, gentlemen, and be kind\r\nenough to wait for me; I shall not be more than half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room, the\r\ncardinal, without asking further information, ascended the staircase\r\nlike a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIV.\r\nTHE UTILITY OF STOVEPIPES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was evident that without suspecting it, and actuated solely by their\r\nchivalrous and adventurous character, our three friends had just\r\nrendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nNow, who was that someone? That was the question the three Musketeers\r\nput to one another. Then, seeing that none of their replies could throw\r\nany light on the subject, Porthos called the host and asked for dice.\r\n\r\nPorthos and Aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play.\r\nAthos walked about in a contemplative mood.\r\n\r\nWhile thinking and walking, Athos passed and repassed before the pipe\r\nof the stove, broken in halves, the other extremity passing into the\r\nchamber above; and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur\r\nof words, which at length fixed his attention. Athos went close to it,\r\nand distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an\r\ninterest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent, remaining\r\nhimself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Milady,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cthe affair is important. Sit\r\ndown, and let us talk it over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMilady!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI listen to your Eminence with greatest attention,\xe2\x80\x9d replied a female\r\nvoice which made the Musketeer start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA small vessel with an English crew, whose captain is on my side,\r\nawaits you at the mouth of Charente, at Fort La Pointe*. He will set\r\nsail tomorrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* Fort La Pointe, or Fort Vasou, was not built until 1672, nearly 50\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go thither tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstantly! That is to say, when you have received my instructions. Two\r\nmen, whom you will find at the door on going out, will serve you as\r\nescort. You will allow me to leave first; then, after half an hour, you\r\ncan go away in your turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monseigneur. Now let us return to the mission with which you wish\r\nto charge me; and as I desire to continue to merit the confidence of\r\nyour Eminence, deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise,\r\nthat I may not commit an error.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocutors.\r\nIt was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in\r\nwhich he was about to speak, and that Milady was collecting all her\r\nintellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say,\r\nand to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken.\r\n\r\nAthos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to\r\nfasten the door inside, and to make them a sign to come and listen with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe two Musketeers, who loved their ease, brought a chair for each of\r\nthemselves and one for Athos. All three then sat down with their heads\r\ntogether and their ears on the alert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will go to London,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the cardinal. \xe2\x80\x9cArrived in London,\r\nyou will seek Buckingham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must beg your Eminence to observe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cthat since the\r\naffair of the diamond studs, about which the duke always suspected me,\r\nhis Grace distrusts me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not necessary to steal his\r\nconfidence, but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a\r\nnegotiator.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrankly and loyally,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Milady, with an unspeakable expression\r\nof duplicity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, frankly and loyally,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cardinal, in the same tone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this negotiation must be carried on openly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will follow your Eminence\xe2\x80\x99s instructions to the letter. I only wait\r\ntill you give them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will go to Buckingham in my behalf, and you will tell him I am\r\nacquainted with all the preparations he has made; but that they give me\r\nno uneasiness, since at the first step he takes I will ruin the queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill he believe that your Eminence is in a position to accomplish the\r\nthreat thus made?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; for I have the proofs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must be able to present these proofs for his appreciation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout doubt. And you will tell him I will publish the report of\r\nBois-Robert and the Marquis de Beautru, upon the interview which the\r\nduke had at the residence of Madame the Constable with the queen on the\r\nevening Madame the Constable gave a masquerade. You will tell him, in\r\norder that he may not doubt, that he came there in the costume of the\r\nGreat Mogul, which the Chevalier de Guise was to have worn, and that he\r\npurchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pistoles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, monseigneur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the details of his coming into and going out of the palace\xe2\x80\x94on the\r\nnight when he introduced himself in the character of an Italian fortune\r\nteller\xe2\x80\x94you will tell him, that he may not doubt the correctness of my\r\ninformation; that he had under his cloak a large white robe dotted with\r\nblack tears, death\xe2\x80\x99s heads, and crossbones\xe2\x80\x94for in case of a surprise,\r\nhe was to pass for the phantom of the White Lady who, as all the world\r\nknows, appears at the Louvre every time any great event is impending.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all, monseigneur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him also that I am acquainted with all the details of the\r\nadventure at Amiens; that I will have a little romance made of it,\r\nwittily turned, with a plan of the garden and portraits of the\r\nprincipal actors in that nocturnal romance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell him that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him further that I hold Montague in my power; that Montague is in\r\nthe Bastille; that no letters were found upon him, it is true, but that\r\ntorture may make him tell much of what he knows, and even what he does\r\nnot know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen add that his Grace has, in the precipitation with which he quit\r\nthe Isle of R\xc3\xa9, forgotten and left behind him in his lodging a certain\r\nletter from Madame de Chevreuse which singularly compromises the queen,\r\ninasmuch as it proves not only that her Majesty can love the enemies of\r\nthe king but that she can conspire with the enemies of France. You\r\nrecollect perfectly all I have told you, do you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Eminence will judge: the ball of Madame the Constable; the night\r\nat the Louvre; the evening at Amiens; the arrest of Montague; the\r\nletter of Madame de Chevreuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s it. You have an excellent\r\nmemory, Milady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering\r\ncompliment, \xe2\x80\x9cif, in spite of all these reasons, the duke does not give\r\nway and continues to menace France?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe duke is in love to madness, or rather to folly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nRichelieu, with great bitterness. \xe2\x80\x9cLike the ancient paladins, he has\r\nonly undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady love. If he\r\nbecomes certain that this war will cost the honor, and perhaps the\r\nliberty, of the lady of his thoughts, as he says, I will answer for it\r\nhe will look twice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, with a persistence that proved she wished to\r\nsee clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be\r\ncharged, \xe2\x80\x9cif he persists?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he persists?\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is not probable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he persists\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d His Eminence made a pause, and resumed: \xe2\x80\x9cIf he\r\npersists\xe2\x80\x94well, then I shall hope for one of those events which change\r\nthe destinies of states.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your Eminence would quote to me some one of these events in\r\nhistory,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps I should partake of your confidence as\r\nto the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here, for example,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richelieu: \xe2\x80\x9cwhen, in 1610, for a cause\r\nsimilar to that which moves the duke, King Henry IV., of glorious\r\nmemory, was about, at the same time, to invade Flanders and Italy, in\r\norder to attack Austria on both sides. Well, did there not happen an\r\nevent which saved Austria? Why should not the king of France have the\r\nsame chance as the emperor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Eminence means, I presume, the knife stab in the Rue de la\r\nFeronnerie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes not your Eminence fear that the punishment inflicted upon\r\nRavaillac may deter anyone who might entertain the idea of imitating\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be, in all times and in all countries, particularly if\r\nreligious divisions exist in those countries, fanatics who ask nothing\r\nbetter than to become martyrs. Ay, and observe\xe2\x80\x94it just occurs to me\r\nthat the Puritans are furious against Buckingham, and their preachers\r\ndesignate him as the Antichrist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the cardinal, in an indifferent tone, \xe2\x80\x9cthe only thing\r\nto be sought for at this moment is some woman, handsome, young, and\r\nclever, who has cause of quarrel with the duke. The duke has had many\r\naffairs of gallantry; and if he has fostered his amours by promises of\r\neternal constancy, he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by\r\nhis eternal infidelities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, coolly, \xe2\x80\x9csuch a woman may be found.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, such a woman, who would place the knife of Jacques Cl\xc3\xa9ment or of\r\nRavaillac in the hands of a fanatic, would save France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere the accomplices of Ravaillac or of Jacques Cl\xc3\xa9ment ever known?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; for perhaps they were too high-placed for anyone to dare look for\r\nthem where they were. The Palace of Justice would not be burned down\r\nfor everybody, monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think, then, that the fire at the Palace of Justice was not caused\r\nby chance?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Richelieu, in the tone with which he would have put a\r\nquestion of no importance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, monseigneur?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady. \xe2\x80\x9cI think nothing; I quote a fact,\r\nthat is all. Only I say that if I were named Madame de Montpensier, or\r\nthe Queen Marie de M\xc3\xa9dicis, I should use less precautions than I take,\r\nbeing simply called Milady Clarik.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is just,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richelieu. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you require, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI require an order which would ratify beforehand all that I should\r\nthink proper to do for the greatest good of France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in the first place, this woman I have described must be found who\r\nis desirous of avenging herself upon the duke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is found,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an\r\ninstrument of God\xe2\x80\x99s justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will be found.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cthen it will be time to claim the order\r\nwhich you just now required.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Eminence is right,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cand I have been wrong in\r\nseeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which\r\nit really is\xe2\x80\x94that is, to announce to his Grace, on the part of your\r\nEminence, that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means\r\nof which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the f\xc3\xaate given by\r\nMadame the Constable; that you have proofs of the interview granted at\r\nthe Louvre by the queen to a certain Italian astrologer who was no\r\nother than the Duke of Buckingham; that you have ordered a little\r\nromance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of\r\nAmiens, with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took\r\nplace, and portraits of the actors who figured in them; that Montague\r\nis in the Bastille, and that the torture may make him say things he\r\nremembers, and even things he has forgotten; that you possess a certain\r\nletter from Madame de Chevreuse, found in his Grace\xe2\x80\x99s lodging, which\r\nsingularly compromises not only her who wrote it, but her in whose name\r\nit was written. Then, if he persists, notwithstanding all this\xe2\x80\x94as that\r\nis, as I have said, the limit of my mission\xe2\x80\x94I shall have nothing to do\r\nbut to pray God to work a miracle for the salvation of France. That is\r\nit, is it not, monseigneur, and I shall have nothing else to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cardinal, dryly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, without appearing to remark the change of the\r\nduke\xe2\x80\x99s tone toward her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnow that I have received the instructions of\r\nyour Eminence as concerns your enemies, Monseigneur will permit me to\r\nsay a few words to him of mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you enemies, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Richelieu.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monseigneur, enemies against whom you owe me all your support,\r\nfor I made them by serving your Eminence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are they?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, there is a little _intrigante_ named Bonacieux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is in the prison of Nantes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, she was there,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the queen has\r\nobtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed\r\nto a convent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo a convent?\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to a convent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to which?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; the secret has been well kept.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _I_ will know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your Eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can see nothing inconvenient in that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now I have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this\r\nlittle Madame Bonacieux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer lover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, your Eminence knows him well,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, carried away by her\r\nanger. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is the evil genius of both of us. It is he who in an\r\nencounter with your Eminence\xe2\x80\x99s Guards decided the victory in favor of\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s Musketeers; it is he who gave three desperate wounds to De\r\nWardes, your emissary, and who caused the affair of the diamond studs\r\nto fail; it is he who, knowing it was I who had Madame Bonacieux\r\ncarried off, has sworn my death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cI know of whom you speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that miserable D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a bold fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to\r\nbe feared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke, \xe2\x80\x9ca proof of his connection with\r\nBuckingham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA proof?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cI will have ten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, it becomes the simplest thing in the world; get me that\r\nproof, and I will send him to the Bastille.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far good, monseigneur; but afterwards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen once in the Bastille, there is no afterward!\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal,\r\nin a low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, _pardieu!_\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9cif it were as easy for\r\nme to get rid of my enemy as it is easy to get rid of yours, and if it\r\nwere against such people you require impunity\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady, \xe2\x80\x9ca fair exchange. Life for life, man for\r\nman; give me one, I will give you the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean, nor do I even desire to know what you\r\nmean,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cardinal; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I wish to please you, and see nothing\r\nout of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so\r\ninfamous a creature\xe2\x80\x94the more so as you tell me this D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan is a\r\nlibertine, a duelist, and a traitor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn infamous scoundrel, monseigneur, a scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me paper, a quill, and some ink, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere they are, monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence, which proved that the cardinal was\r\nemployed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note, or\r\nelse in writing it. Athos, who had not lost a word of the conversation,\r\ntook his two companions by the hand, and led them to the other end of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you want, and why do you not let us\r\nlisten to the end of the conversation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, speaking in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have heard all it was\r\nnecessary we should hear; besides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t prevent you from listening,\r\nbut I must be gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be gone!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cand if the cardinal asks for you,\r\nwhat answer can we make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not wait till he asks; you will speak first, and tell him\r\nthat I am gone on the lookout, because certain expressions of our host\r\nhave given me reason to think the road is not safe. I will say two\r\nwords about it to the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s esquire likewise. The rest concerns\r\nmyself; don\xe2\x80\x99t be uneasy about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe prudent, Athos,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe easy on that head,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cyou know I am cool enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos and Aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe.\r\n\r\nAs to Athos, he went out without any mystery, took his horse, which was\r\ntied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters, in\r\nfour words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for\r\ntheir return, carefully examined the priming of his pistols, drew his\r\nsword, and took, like a forlorn hope, the road to the camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLV.\r\nA CONJUGAL SCENE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Athos had foreseen, it was not long before the cardinal came down.\r\nHe opened the door of the room in which the Musketeers were, and found\r\nPorthos playing an earnest game of dice with Aramis. He cast a rapid\r\nglance around the room, and perceived that one of his men was missing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has become of Monseigneur Athos?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9che has gone as a scout, on account of\r\nsome words of our host, which made him believe the road was not safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, what have you done, Monsieur Porthos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have won five pistoles of Aramis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; now will you return with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are at your Eminence\xe2\x80\x99s orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo horse, then, gentlemen; for it is getting late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe attendant was at the door, holding the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s horse by the\r\nbridle. At a short distance a group of two men and three horses\r\nappeared in the shade. These were the two men who were to conduct\r\nMilady to Fort La Pointe, and superintend her embarkation.\r\n\r\nThe attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two Musketeers had\r\nalready said with respect to Athos. The cardinal made an approving\r\ngesture, and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used\r\nin coming.\r\n\r\nLet us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his\r\nesquire and the two Musketeers, and return to Athos.\r\n\r\nFor a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started; but\r\nwhen out of sight he turned his horse to the right, made a circuit, and\r\ncame back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of\r\nthe little troop. Having recognized the laced hats of his companions\r\nand the golden fringe of the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s cloak, he waited till the\r\nhorsemen had turned the angle of the road, and having lost sight of\r\nthem, he returned at a gallop to the inn, which was opened to him\r\nwithout hesitation.\r\n\r\nThe host recognized him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy officer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9chas forgotten to give a piece of very\r\nimportant information to the lady, and has sent me back to repair his\r\nforgetfulness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo up,\xe2\x80\x9d said the host; \xe2\x80\x9cshe is still in her chamber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos availed himself of the permission, ascended the stairs with his\r\nlightest step, gained the landing, and through the open door perceived\r\nMilady putting on her hat.\r\n\r\nHe entered the chamber and closed the door behind him. At the noise he\r\nmade in pushing the bolt, Milady turned round.\r\n\r\nAthos was standing before the door, enveloped in his cloak, with his\r\nhat pulled down over his eyes. On seeing this figure, mute and\r\nimmovable as a statue, Milady was frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you, and what do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d cried she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cit is certainly she!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd letting fall his cloak and raising his hat, he advanced toward\r\nMilady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know me, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nMilady made one step forward, and then drew back as if she had seen a\r\nserpent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cI perceive you know me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Comte de la F\xc3\xa8re!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Milady, becoming exceedingly pale, and\r\ndrawing back till the wall prevented her from going any farther.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Milady,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Comte de la F\xc3\xa8re in person, who\r\ncomes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you\r\na visit. Sit down, madame, and let us talk, as the cardinal said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady, under the influence of inexpressible terror, sat down without\r\nuttering a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou certainly are a demon sent upon the earth!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\npower is great, I know; but you also know that with the help of God men\r\nhave often conquered the most terrible demons. You have once before\r\nthrown yourself in my path. I thought I had crushed you, madame; but\r\neither I was deceived or hell has resuscitated you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady at these words, which recalled frightful remembrances, hung down\r\nher head with a suppressed groan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, hell has resuscitated you,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cHell has made you\r\nrich, hell has given you another name, hell has almost made you another\r\nface; but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the\r\nbrand from your body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady arose as if moved by a powerful spring, and her eyes flashed\r\nlightning. Athos remained sitting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou believed me to be dead, did you not, as I believed you to be? And\r\nthe name of Athos as well concealed the Comte de la F\xc3\xa8re, as the name\r\nMilady Clarik concealed Anne de Breuil. Was it not so you were called\r\nwhen your honored brother married us? Our position is truly a strange\r\none,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Athos, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have only lived up to the present\r\ntime because we believed each other dead, and because a remembrance is\r\nless oppressive than a living creature, though a remembrance is\r\nsometimes devouring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, in a hollow, faint voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat brings you back to\r\nme, and what do you want with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes, I\r\nhave not lost sight of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what I have done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can relate to you, day by day, your actions from your entrance to\r\nthe service of the cardinal to this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen! It was you who cut off the two diamond studs from the shoulder\r\nof the Duke of Buckingham; it was you who had Madame Bonacieux carried\r\noff; it was you who, in love with De Wardes and thinking to pass the\r\nnight with him, opened the door to Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; it was you who,\r\nbelieving that De Wardes had deceived you, wished to have him killed by\r\nhis rival; it was you who, when this rival had discovered your infamous\r\nsecret, wished to have him killed in his turn by two assassins, whom\r\nyou sent in pursuit of him; it was you who, finding the balls had\r\nmissed their mark, sent poisoned wine with a forged letter, to make\r\nyour victim believe that the wine came from his friends. In short, it\r\nwas you who have but now in this chamber, seated in this chair I now\r\nfill, made an engagement with Cardinal Richelieu to cause the Duke of\r\nBuckingham to be assassinated, in exchange for the promise he has made\r\nyou to allow you to assassinate D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady was livid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be Satan!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cBut at all events listen well to this.\r\nAssassinate the Duke of Buckingham, or cause him to be assassinated\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ncare very little about that! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know him. Besides, he is an\r\nEnglishman. But do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair\r\nof D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who is a faithful friend whom I love and defend, or I\r\nswear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have\r\nendeavored to commit, or shall have committed, shall be the last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan has cruelly insulted me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, in a hollow\r\ntone; \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan shall die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! Is it possible to insult you, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, laughing;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che has insulted you, and he shall die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shall die!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cshe first, and he afterward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos was seized with a kind of vertigo. The sight of this creature,\r\nwho had nothing of the woman about her, recalled awful remembrances. He\r\nthought how one day, in a less dangerous situation than the one in\r\nwhich he was now placed, he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to\r\nhis honor. His desire for blood returned, burning his brain and\r\npervading his frame like a raging fever; he arose in his turn, reached\r\nhis hand to his belt, drew forth a pistol, and cocked it.\r\n\r\nMilady, pale as a corpse, endeavored to cry out; but her swollen tongue\r\ncould utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it\r\nand resembled the rattle of a wild beast. Motionless against the dark\r\ntapestry, with her hair in disorder, she appeared like a horrid image\r\nof terror.\r\n\r\nAthos slowly raised his pistol, stretched out his arm so that the\r\nweapon almost touched Milady\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, and then, in a voice the more\r\nterrible from having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will this instant deliver to me the paper the\r\ncardinal signed; or upon my soul, I will blow your brains out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith another man, Milady might have preserved some doubt; but she knew\r\nAthos. Nevertheless, she remained motionless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have one second to decide,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nMilady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was\r\nabout to be pulled; she reached her hand quickly to her bosom, drew out\r\na paper, and held it toward Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand be accursed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos took the paper, returned the pistol to his belt, approached the\r\nlamp to be assured that it was the paper, unfolded it, and read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDec. 3, 1627\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of\r\nthis has done what he has done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRICHELIEU\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, resuming his cloak and putting on his hat, \xe2\x80\x9cnow\r\nthat I have drawn your teeth, viper, bite if you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he left the chamber without once looking behind him.\r\n\r\nAt the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur\xe2\x80\x99s order is, you know, to conduct\r\nthat woman, without losing time, to Fort La Pointe, and never to leave\r\nher till she is on board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs these words agreed wholly with the order they had received, they\r\nbowed their heads in sign of assent.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Athos, he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at\r\nfull gallop; only instead of following the road, he went across the\r\nfields, urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\nIn one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the road.\r\nHe had no doubt it was the cardinal and his escort. He immediately made\r\na new point in advance, rubbed his horse down with some heath and\r\nleaves of trees, and placed himself across the road, about two hundred\r\npaces from the camp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho goes there?\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, as soon as he perceived the horsemen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is our brave Musketeer, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cit is he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Athos,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richelieu, \xe2\x80\x9creceive my thanks for the good guard\r\nyou have kept. Gentlemen, we are arrived; take the gate on the left.\r\nThe watchword is, \xe2\x80\x98King and R\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaying these words, the cardinal saluted the three friends with an\r\ninclination of his head, and took the right hand, followed by his\r\nattendant\xe2\x80\x94for that night he himself slept in the camp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos and Aramis together, as soon as the cardinal was\r\nout of hearing, \xe2\x80\x9cwell, he signed the paper she required!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, coolly, \xe2\x80\x9csince here it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached\r\ntheir quarters, except to give the watchword to the sentinels. Only\r\nthey sent Mousqueton to tell Planchet that his master was requested,\r\nthe instant that he left the trenches, to come to the quarters of the\r\nMusketeers.\r\n\r\nMilady, as Athos had foreseen, on finding the two men that awaited her,\r\nmade no difficulty in following them. She had had for an instant an\r\ninclination to be reconducted to the cardinal, and relate everything to\r\nhim; but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the\r\npart of Athos. She might say that Athos had hanged her; but then Athos\r\nwould tell that she was branded. She thought it was best to preserve\r\nsilence, to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with\r\nher usual skill; and then, all things being accomplished to the\r\nsatisfaction of the cardinal, to come to him and claim her vengeance.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, after having traveled all night, at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock she\r\nwas at the fort of the Point; at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock she had embarked; and at\r\nnine, the vessel, which with letters of marque from the cardinal was\r\nsupposed to be sailing for Bayonne, raised anchor, and steered its\r\ncourse toward England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVI.\r\nTHE BASTION SAINT-GERVAIS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the lodgings of his three friends, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan found them\r\nassembled in the same chamber. Athos was meditating; Porthos was\r\ntwisting his mustache; Aramis was saying his prayers in a charming\r\nlittle Book of Hours, bound in blue velvet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pardieu_, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope what you have to tell me is\r\nworth the trouble, or else, I warn you, I will not pardon you for\r\nmaking me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night\r\nspent in taking and dismantling a bastion. Ah, why were you not there,\r\ngentlemen? It was warm work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were in a place where it was not very cold,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Porthos,\r\ngiving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, comprehending the slight frown of the\r\nMusketeer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt appears there is something fresh aboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAramis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cyou went to breakfast the day before yesterday\r\nat the inn of the Parpaillot, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you fare?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my part, I ate but little. The day before yesterday was a fish\r\nday, and they had nothing but meat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cno fish at a seaport?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, resuming his pious reading, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the dyke\r\nwhich the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is not quite what I mean to ask you, Aramis,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know if you were left alone, and nobody interrupted you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I think there were not many intruders. Yes, Athos, I know what\r\nyou mean: we shall do very well at the Parpaillot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to the Parpaillot, then, for here the walls are like sheets\r\nof paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who was accustomed to his friend\xe2\x80\x99s manner of acting, and\r\nwho perceived immediately, by a word, a gesture, or a sign from him,\r\nthat the circumstances were serious, took Athos\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and went out\r\nwithout saying anything. Porthos followed, chatting with Aramis.\r\n\r\nOn their way they met Grimaud. Athos made him a sign to come with them.\r\nGrimaud, according to custom, obeyed in silence; the poor lad had\r\nnearly come to the pass of forgetting how to speak.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the drinking room of the Parpaillot. It was seven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, and daylight began to appear. The three friends\r\nordered breakfast, and went into a room in which the host said they\r\nwould not be disturbed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the hour was badly chosen for a private conference. The\r\nmorning drum had just been beaten; everyone shook off the drowsiness of\r\nnight, and to dispel the humid morning air, came to take a drop at the\r\ninn. Dragoons, Swiss, Guardsmen, Musketeers, light-horsemen, succeeded\r\none another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host\r\nvery well, but agreed badly with the views of the four friends. Thus\r\nthey applied very curtly to the salutations, healths, and jokes of\r\ntheir companions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see how it will be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos: \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall get into some pretty\r\nquarrel or other, and we have no need of one just now. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, tell\r\nus what sort of a night you have had, and we will describe ours\r\nafterward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said a light-horseman, with a glass of brandy in his hand,\r\nwhich he sipped slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cI hear you gentlemen of the Guards have been\r\nin the trenches tonight, and that you did not get much the best of the\r\nRochellais.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan looked at Athos to know if he ought to reply to this\r\nintruder who thus mixed unasked in their conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you hear Monsieur de Busigny, who does you\r\nthe honor to ask you a question? Relate what has passed during the\r\nnight, since these gentlemen desire to know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you not taken a bastion?\xe2\x80\x9d said a Swiss, who was drinking rum out\r\nof a beer glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, bowing, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have had that honor. We\r\neven have, as you may have heard, introduced a barrel of powder under\r\none of the angles, which in blowing up made a very pretty breach.\r\nWithout reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the\r\nrest of the building was badly shaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what bastion is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a dragoon, with his saber run through a\r\ngoose which he was taking to be cooked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bastion St. Gervais,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom behind which the\r\nRochellais annoyed our workmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that affair hot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, moderately so. We lost five men, and the Rochellais eight or\r\nten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Balzempleu!_\xe2\x80\x9d said the Swiss, who, notwithstanding the admirable\r\ncollection of oaths possessed by the German language, had acquired a\r\nhabit of swearing in French.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is probable,\xe2\x80\x9d said the light-horseman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they will send\r\npioneers this morning to repair the bastion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s probable,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9ca wager!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, _wooi_, a vager!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Swiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the light-horseman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dragoon, placing his saber like a spit upon the\r\ntwo large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney, \xe2\x80\x9cstop a\r\nbit, I am in it. You cursed host! a dripping pan immediately, that I\r\nmay not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou was right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Swiss; \xe2\x80\x9cgoose grease is kood with basdry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d said the dragoon. \xe2\x80\x9cNow for the wager! We listen, Monsieur\r\nAthos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the wager!\xe2\x80\x9d said the light-horseman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Monsieur de Busigny, I will bet you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my three\r\ncompanions, Messieurs Porthos, Aramis, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and myself, will\r\ngo and breakfast in the bastion St. Gervais, and we will remain there\r\nan hour, by the watch, whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos and Aramis looked at each other; they began to comprehend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in the ear of Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are going to get us\r\nall killed without mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are much more likely to be killed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cif we do not go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, turning round upon his chair and\r\ntwisting his mustache, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a fair bet, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take it,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Busigny; \xe2\x80\x9cso let us fix the stake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are four gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cand we are four; an unlimited\r\ndinner for eight. Will that do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapitally,\xe2\x80\x9d replied M. de Busigny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dragoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat shoots me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Swiss.\r\n\r\nThe fourth auditor, who during all this conversation had played a mute\r\npart, made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe breakfast for these gentlemen is ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said the host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, bring it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\nThe host obeyed. Athos called Grimaud, pointed to a large basket which\r\nlay in a corner, and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the\r\nnapkins.\r\n\r\nGrimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass, took the\r\nbasket, packed up the viands, added the bottles, and then took the\r\nbasket on his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where are you going to eat my breakfast?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat matter, if you are paid for it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, and he threw two\r\npistoles majestically on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I give you the change, my officer?\xe2\x80\x9d said the host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, only add two bottles of champagne, and the difference will be for\r\nthe napkins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for, but\r\nhe made amends by slipping in two bottles of Anjou wine instead of two\r\nbottles of champagne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de Busigny,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you be so kind as to set your\r\nwatch with mine, or permit me to regulate mine by yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich you please, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d said the light-horseman, drawing from his\r\nfob a very handsome watch, studded with diamonds; \xe2\x80\x9chalf past seven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty-five minutes after seven,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cby which you perceive I\r\nam five minutes faster than you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd bowing to all the astonished persons present, the young men took\r\nthe road to the bastion St. Gervais, followed by Grimaud, who carried\r\nthe basket, ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience\r\nwhich Athos had taught him not even thinking of asking.\r\n\r\nAs long as they were within the circle of the camp, the four friends\r\ndid not exchange one word; besides, they were followed by the curious,\r\nwho, hearing of the wager, were anxious to know how they would come out\r\nof it. But when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found\r\nthemselves in the open plain, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who was completely ignorant\r\nof what was going forward, thought it was time to demand an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, my dear Athos,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cdo me the kindness to tell me where\r\nwe are going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are we going to do there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know well that we go to breakfast there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why did we not breakfast at the Parpaillot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we have very important matters to communicate to one another,\r\nand it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being\r\nannoyed by all those importunate fellows, who keep coming in, saluting\r\nyou, and addressing you. Here at least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, pointing to the\r\nbastion, \xe2\x80\x9cthey will not come and disturb us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with that prudence which allied\r\nitself in him so naturally with excessive bravery, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we could have\r\nfound some retired place on the downs or the seashore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere we should have been seen all four conferring together, so that\r\nat the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been\r\ninformed by his spies that we were holding a council.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cAthos is right: _Animadvertuntur in desertis_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA desert would not have been amiss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it behooved us\r\nto find it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no desert where a bird cannot pass over one\xe2\x80\x99s head, where a\r\nfish cannot leap out of the water, where a rabbit cannot come out of\r\nits burrow, and I believe that bird, fish, and rabbit each becomes a\r\nspy of the cardinal. Better, then, pursue our enterprise; from which,\r\nbesides, we cannot retreat without shame. We have made a wager\xe2\x80\x94a wager\r\nwhich could not have been foreseen, and of which I defy anyone to\r\ndivine the true cause. We are going, in order to win it, to remain an\r\nhour in the bastion. Either we shall be attacked, or not. If we are\r\nnot, we shall have all the time to talk, and nobody will hear us\xe2\x80\x94for I\r\nguarantee the walls of the bastion have no ears; if we are, we will\r\ntalk of our affairs just the same. Moreover, in defending ourselves, we\r\nshall cover ourselves with glory. You see that everything is to our\r\nadvantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we shall indubitably attract a ball.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know well that the balls most to\r\nbe dreaded are not from the enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our\r\nmuskets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are stupid, friend Porthos. Why should we load ourselves with a\r\nuseless burden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t find a good musket, twelve cartridges, and a powder flask very\r\nuseless in the face of an enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos, \xe2\x80\x9chave you not heard what D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten\r\nFrenchmen were killed, and as many Rochellais.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bodies were not plundered, were they? It appears the conquerors\r\nhad something else to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we shall find their muskets, their cartridges, and their flasks;\r\nand instead of four musketoons and twelve balls, we shall have fifteen\r\nguns and a hundred charges to fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Athos!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9ctruly you are a great man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos nodded in sign of agreement. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan alone did not seem\r\nconvinced.\r\n\r\nGrimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man, for seeing\r\nthat they continued to advance toward the bastion\xe2\x80\x94something he had till\r\nthen doubted\xe2\x80\x94he pulled his master by the skirt of his coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we going?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he, by a gesture.\r\n\r\nAthos pointed to the bastion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grimaud, in the same silent dialect, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall leave our\r\nskins there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven.\r\n\r\nGrimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nAthos took a pistol from his belt, looked to see if it was properly\r\nprimed, cocked it, and placed the muzzle close to Grimaud\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\r\n\r\nGrimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring. Athos then made him a\r\nsign to take up his basket and to walk on first. Grimaud obeyed. All\r\nthat Grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the\r\nrear guard to the vanguard.\r\n\r\nArrived at the bastion, the four friends turned round.\r\n\r\nMore than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the\r\ngate of the camp; and in a separate group might be distinguished M. de\r\nBusigny, the dragoon, the Swiss, and the fourth bettor.\r\n\r\nAthos took off his hat, placed it on the end of his sword, and waved it\r\nin the air.\r\n\r\nAll the spectators returned him his salute, accompanying this courtesy\r\nwith a loud hurrah which was audible to the four; after which all four\r\ndisappeared in the bastion, whither Grimaud had preceded them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVII.\r\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE MUSKETEERS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Athos had foreseen, the bastion was only occupied by a dozen\r\ncorpses, French and Rochellais.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, who had assumed the command of the expedition,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhile Grimaud spreads the table, let us begin by collecting the guns\r\nand cartridges together. We can talk while performing that necessary\r\ntask. These gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, pointing to the bodies, \xe2\x80\x9ccannot hear\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we could throw them into the ditch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cafter having\r\nassured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s Grimaud\xe2\x80\x99s business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cpray let Grimaud search them and throw\r\nthem over the walls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forfend!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cthey may serve us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese bodies serve us?\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are mad, dear friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJudge not rashly, say the gospel and the cardinal,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many guns, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many shots?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s quite as many as we shall want. Let us load the guns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe four Musketeers went to work; and as they were loading the last\r\nmusket Grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready.\r\n\r\nAthos replied, always by gestures, that that was well, and indicated to\r\nGrimaud, by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster, that\r\nhe was to stand as sentinel. Only, to alleviate the tediousness of the\r\nduty, Athos allowed him to take a loaf, two cutlets, and a bottle of\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now to table,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\nThe four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs\r\ncrossed like Turks, or even tailors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cas there is no longer any fear of being\r\noverheard, I hope you are going to let me into your secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory,\r\ngentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cI have induced you to take a charming\r\npromenade; here is a delicious breakfast; and yonder are five hundred\r\npersons, as you may see through the loopholes, taking us for heroes or\r\nmadmen\xe2\x80\x94two classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the secret!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe secret is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I saw Milady last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was lifting a glass to his lips; but at the name of Milady,\r\nhis hand trembled so, that he was obliged to put the glass on the\r\nground again for fear of spilling the contents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw your wi\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cYou forget, my dear, you forget that these\r\ngentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself. I\r\nhave seen Milady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithin two leagues of this place, at the inn of the Red Dovecot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case I am lost,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so bad yet,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cfor by this time she must have quit\r\nthe shores of France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan breathed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut after all,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cwho is Milady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA charming woman!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, sipping a glass of sparkling wine.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVillainous host!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9che has given us Anjou wine instead of\r\nchampagne, and fancies we know no better! Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\ncharming woman, who entertained kind views toward our friend\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who, on his part, has given her some offense for which she\r\ntried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket\r\nshots, a week ago by trying to poison him, and yesterday by demanding\r\nhis head of the cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! by demanding my head of the cardinal?\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, pale\r\nwith terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is true as the Gospel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cI heard her with my\r\nown ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI also,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, letting his arm fall with discouragement, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nis useless to struggle longer. I may as well blow my brains out, and\r\nall will be over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the last folly to be committed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cseeing it is the\r\nonly one for which there is no remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can never escape,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cwith such enemies. First,\r\nmy stranger of Meung; then De Wardes, to whom I have given three sword\r\nwounds; next Milady, whose secret I have discovered; finally, the\r\ncardinal, whose vengeance I have balked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cthat only makes four; and we are four\xe2\x80\x94one for one.\r\n_Pardieu!_ if we may believe the signs Grimaud is making, we are about\r\nto have to do with a very different number of people. What is it,\r\nGrimaud? Considering the gravity of the occasion, I permit you to\r\nspeak, my friend; but be laconic, I beg. What do you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA troop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf how many persons?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of men?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSixteen pioneers, four soldiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far distant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive hundred paces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! We have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of\r\nwine to your health, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo your health!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Porthos and Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, to my health! although I am very much afraid that your\r\ngood wishes will not be of great service to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cGod is great, as say the followers of Mohammed, and\r\nthe future is in his hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, swallowing the contents of his glass, which he put down close to\r\nhim, Athos arose carelessly, took the musket next to him, and drew near\r\nto one of the loopholes.\r\n\r\nPorthos, Aramis and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan followed his example. As to Grimaud, he\r\nreceived orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to\r\nreload their weapons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pardieu!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cit was hardly worth while to distribute\r\nourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes, mattocks, and\r\nshovels. Grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away, and I am\r\nconvinced they would have left us in peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cfor they are advancing very\r\nresolutely. Besides, in addition to the pioneers, there are four\r\nsoldiers and a brigadier, armed with muskets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s because they don\xe2\x80\x99t see us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cI must confess I feel a great repugnance to\r\nfire on these poor devils of civilians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a bad priest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cwho has pity for heretics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cAramis is right. I will warn them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will be\r\nshot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Athos heeded not his advice. Mounting on the breach, with his\r\nmusket in one hand and his hat in the other, he said, bowing\r\ncourteously and addressing the soldiers and the pioneers, who,\r\nastonished at this apparition, stopped fifty paces from the bastion:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, a few friends and myself are about to breakfast in this\r\nbastion. Now, you know nothing is more disagreeable than being\r\ndisturbed when one is at breakfast. We request you, then, if you really\r\nhave business here, to wait till we have finished our repast, or to\r\ncome again a short time hence; unless, which would be far better, you\r\nform the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels, and come\r\nand drink with us to the health of the King of France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, Athos!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you see they are aiming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cbut they are only civilians\xe2\x80\x94very bad marksmen,\r\nwho will be sure not to hit me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, at the same instant four shots were fired, and the balls were\r\nflattened against the wall around Athos, but not one touched him.\r\n\r\nFour shots replied to them almost instantaneously, but much better\r\naimed than those of the aggressors; three soldiers fell dead, and one\r\nof the pioneers was wounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrimaud,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, still on the breach, \xe2\x80\x9canother musket!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrimaud immediately obeyed. On their part, the three friends had\r\nreloaded their arms; a second discharge followed the first. The\r\nbrigadier and two pioneers fell dead; the rest of the troop took to\r\nflight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, gentlemen, a _sortie!_\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos.\r\n\r\nAnd the four friends rushed out of the fort, gained the field of\r\nbattle, picked up the four muskets of the privates and the half-pike of\r\nthe brigadier, and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till\r\nthey reached the city, turned again toward the bastion, bearing with\r\nthem the trophies of their victory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReload the muskets, Grimaud,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cand we, gentlemen, will go\r\non with our breakfast, and resume our conversation. Where were we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recollect you were saying,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthat after having\r\ndemanded my head of the cardinal, Milady had quit the shores of France.\r\nWhither goes she?\xe2\x80\x9d added he, strongly interested in the route Milady\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe goes into England,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith what view?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the view of assassinating, or causing to be assassinated, the\r\nDuke of Buckingham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is infamous!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg you to believe that I care very little\r\nabout it. Now you have done, Grimaud, take our brigadier\xe2\x80\x99s half-pike,\r\ntie a napkin to it, and plant it on top of our bastion, that these\r\nrebels of Rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and\r\nloyal soldiers of the king.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrimaud obeyed without replying. An instant afterward, the white flag\r\nwas floating over the heads of the four friends. A thunder of applause\r\nsaluted its appearance; half the camp was at the barrier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou care little if she kills Buckingham or\r\ncauses him to be killed? But the duke is our friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe duke is English; the duke fights against us. Let her do what she\r\nlikes with the duke; I care no more about him than an empty bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd Athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he\r\nhad poured the last drop into his glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cI will not abandon Buckingham thus. He\r\ngave us some very fine horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd moreover, very handsome saddles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, who at the moment\r\nwore on his cloak the lace of his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cGod desires the conversion and not the death\r\nof a sinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cand we will return to that subject later, if such\r\nbe your pleasure; but what for the moment engaged my attention most\r\nearnestly, and I am sure you will understand me, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, was the\r\ngetting from this woman a kind of _carte blanche_ which she had\r\nextorted from the cardinal, and by means of which she could with\r\nimpunity get rid of you and perhaps of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this creature must be a demon!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, holding out his\r\nplate to Aramis, who was cutting up a fowl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this _carte blanche_,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthis _carte blanche_,\r\ndoes it remain in her hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it passed into mine; I will not say without trouble, for if I did\r\nI should tell a lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Athos, I shall no longer count the number of times I am\r\nindebted to you for my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it was to go to her that you left us?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have that letter of the cardinal?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; and he took the invaluable paper from the\r\npocket of his uniform. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan unfolded it with one hand, whose\r\ntrembling he did not even attempt to conceal, to read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDec. 3, 1627\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of\r\nthis has done what he has done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRICHELIEU\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cit is an absolution according to rule.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat paper must be torn to pieces,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who fancied he\r\nread in it his sentence of death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cit must be preserved carefully. I would\r\nnot give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will she do now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos, carelessly, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is probably going to write to\r\nthe cardinal that a damned Musketeer, named Athos, has taken her\r\nsafe-conduct from her by force; she will advise him in the same letter\r\nto get rid of his two friends, Aramis and Porthos, at the same time.\r\nThe cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often\r\ncrossed his path; and then some fine morning he will arrest D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\nand for fear he should feel lonely, he will send us to keep him company\r\nin the Bastille.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to! It appears to me you make dull jokes, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not jest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cthat to twist that damned Milady\xe2\x80\x99s neck\r\nwould be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of\r\nHuguenots, who have committed no other crime than singing in French the\r\npsalms we sing in Latin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat says the abb\xc3\xa9?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Athos, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say I am entirely of Porthos\xe2\x80\x99s opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFortunately, she is far off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I confess she would\r\nworry me if she were here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe worries me in England as well as in France,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe worries me everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when you held her in your power, why did you not drown her,\r\nstrangle her, hang her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is only the dead who do not\r\nreturn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so, Porthos?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Musketeer, with a sad smile which\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan alone understood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have an idea,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Musketeers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo arms!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Grimaud.\r\n\r\nThe young men sprang up, and seized their muskets.\r\n\r\nThis time a small troop advanced, consisting of from twenty to\r\ntwenty-five men; but they were not pioneers, they were soldiers of the\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we return to the camp?\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the sides\r\nare equal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible, for three reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first, that we\r\nhave not finished breakfast; the second, that we still have some very\r\nimportant things to say; and the third, that it yet wants ten minutes\r\nbefore the lapse of the hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must form a plan of battle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very simple,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as the enemy are within\r\nmusket shot, we must fire upon them. If they continue to advance, we\r\nmust fire again. We must fire as long as we have loaded guns. If those\r\nwho remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault, we will allow\r\nthe besiegers to get as far as the ditch, and then we will push down\r\nupon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a\r\nmiracle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly, Athos, you were born to be a\r\ngeneral, and the cardinal, who fancies himself a great soldier, is\r\nnothing beside you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cno divided attention, I beg; let each one\r\npick out his man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cover mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I _idem_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFire, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\nThe four muskets made but one report, but four men fell.\r\n\r\nThe drum immediately beat, and the little troop advanced at charging\r\npace.\r\n\r\nThen the shots were repeated without regularity, but always aimed with\r\nthe same accuracy. Nevertheless, as if they had been aware of the\r\nnumerical weakness of the friends, the Rochellais continued to advance\r\nin quick time.\r\n\r\nWith every three shots at least two men fell; but the march of those\r\nwho remained was not slackened.\r\n\r\nArrived at the foot of the bastion, there were still more than a dozen\r\nof the enemy. A last discharge welcomed them, but did not stop them;\r\nthey jumped into the ditch, and prepared to scale the breach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cfinish them at a blow. To the wall; to\r\nthe wall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the four friends, seconded by Grimaud, pushed with the barrels of\r\ntheir muskets an enormous sheet of the wall, which bent as if pushed by\r\nthe wind, and detaching itself from its base, fell with a horrible\r\ncrash into the ditch. Then a fearful crash was heard; a cloud of dust\r\nmounted toward the sky\xe2\x80\x94and all was over!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan we have destroyed them all, from the first to the last?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith, it appears so!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cthere go three or four, limping away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, three or four of these unfortunate men, covered with dirt and\r\nblood, fled along the hollow way, and at length regained the city.\r\nThese were all who were left of the little troop.\r\n\r\nAthos looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have been here an hour, and our wager is won;\r\nbut we will be fair players. Besides, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan has not told us his\r\nidea yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the Musketeer, with his usual coolness, reseated himself before the\r\nremains of the breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy idea?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; you said you had an idea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will go to England a second\r\ntime; I will go and find Buckingham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall not do that, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, coolly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not? Have I not been there once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but at that period we were not at war. At that period Buckingham\r\nwas an ally, and not an enemy. What you would now do amounts to\r\ntreason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan perceived the force of this reasoning, and was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I have an idea, in my turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence for Monsieur Porthos\xe2\x80\x99s idea!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will ask leave of absence of Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, on some pretext\r\nor other which you must invent; I am not very clever at pretexts.\r\nMilady does not know me; I will get access to her without her\r\nsuspecting me, and when I catch my beauty, I will strangle her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not far from approving the idea of\r\nMonsieur Porthos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis. \xe2\x80\x9cKill a woman? No, listen to me; I have the\r\ntrue idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us see your idea, Aramis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, who felt much deference for\r\nthe young Musketeer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must inform the queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my faith, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, at the same time; \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nare coming nearer to it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInform the queen!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cand how? Have we relations with the\r\ncourt? Could we send anyone to Paris without its being known in the\r\ncamp? From here to Paris it is a hundred and forty leagues; before our\r\nletter was at Angers we should be in a dungeon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to remitting a letter with safety to her Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis,\r\ncoloring, \xe2\x80\x9cI will take that upon myself. I know a clever person at\r\nTours\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis stopped on seeing Athos smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do you not adopt this means, Athos?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not reject it altogether,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I wish to remind\r\nAramis that he cannot quit the camp, and that nobody but one of\r\nourselves is trustworthy; that two hours after the messenger has set\r\nout, all the Capuchins, all the police, all the black caps of the\r\ncardinal, will know your letter by heart, and you and your clever\r\nperson will be arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout reckoning,\xe2\x80\x9d objected Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the queen would save\r\nMonsieur de Buckingham, but would take no heed of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat Porthos says is full of sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah! but what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the city yonder?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are beating the general alarm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe four friends listened, and the sound of the drum plainly reached\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, they are going to send a whole regiment against us,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think of holding out against a whole regiment, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPorthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Musketeer. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel myself quite in a humor for it;\r\nand I would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to\r\nbring a dozen more bottles of wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, the drum draws near,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a quarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s journey from\r\nhere to the city, consequently a quarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s journey from the\r\ncity to hither. That is more than time enough for us to devise a plan.\r\nIf we go from this place we shall never find another so suitable. Ah,\r\nstop! I have it, gentlemen; the right idea has just occurred to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to give Grimaud some indispensable orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos made a sign for his lackey to approach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrimaud,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall\r\nof the bastion, \xe2\x80\x9ctake those gentlemen, set them up against the wall,\r\nput their hats upon their heads, and their guns in their hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the great man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cI comprehend now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou comprehend?\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you comprehend, Grimaud?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\nGrimaud made a sign in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all that is necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cnow for my idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like, however, to comprehend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is useless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes! Athos\xe2\x80\x99s idea!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Aramis and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis Milady, this woman, this creature, this demon, has a\r\nbrother-in-law, as I think you told me, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know him very well; and I also believe that he has not a very\r\nwarm affection for his sister-in-law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no harm in that. If he detested her, it would be all the\r\nbetter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case we are as well off as we wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to know what Grimaud is about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence, Porthos!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is her brother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord de Winter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe returned to London at the first sound of war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s just the man we want,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is he whom we\r\nmust warn. We will have him informed that his sister-in-law is on the\r\npoint of having someone assassinated, and beg him not to lose sight of\r\nher. There is in London, I hope, some establishment like that of the\r\nMagdalens, or of the Repentant Daughters. He must place his sister in\r\none of these, and we shall be in peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9ctill she comes out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my faith!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cyou require too much, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. I have\r\ngiven you all I have, and I beg leave to tell you that this is the\r\nbottom of my sack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think it would be still better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cto inform the\r\nqueen and Lord de Winter at the same time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but who is to carry the letter to Tours, and who to London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI answer for Bazin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I for Planchet,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cif we cannot leave the camp, our lackeys may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure they may; and this very day we will write the letters,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Aramis. \xe2\x80\x9cGive the lackeys money, and they will start.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will give them money?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you any money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe four friends looked at one another, and a cloud came over the brows\r\nwhich but lately had been so cheerful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI see black points and red points moving\r\nyonder. Why did you talk of a regiment, Athos? It is a veritable army!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cthere they are. See the sneaks come,\r\nwithout drum or trumpet. Ah, ah! have you finished, Grimaud?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrimaud made a sign in the affirmative, and pointed to a dozen bodies\r\nwhich he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes. Some carried\r\narms, others seemed to be taking aim, and the remainder appeared merely\r\nto be sword in hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cthat does honor to your imagination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I should like to understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us decamp first, and you will understand afterward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA moment, gentlemen, a moment; give Grimaud time to clear away the\r\nbreakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cthe black points and the red points are visibly\r\nenlarging. I am of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s opinion; we have no time to lose in\r\nregaining our camp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to say against a retreat. We\r\nbet upon one hour, and we have stayed an hour and a half. Nothing can\r\nbe said; let us be off, gentlemen, let us be off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrimaud was already ahead, with the basket and the dessert. The four\r\nfriends followed, ten paces behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil shall we do now, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you forgotten anything?\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe white flag, _morbleu!_ We must not leave a flag in the hands of\r\nthe enemy, even if that flag be but a napkin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Athos ran back to the bastion, mounted the platform, and bore off\r\nthe flag; but as the Rochellais had arrived within musket range, they\r\nopened a terrible fire upon this man, who appeared to expose himself\r\nfor pleasure\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\nBut Athos might be said to bear a charmed life. The balls passed and\r\nwhistled all around him; not one struck him.\r\n\r\nAthos waved his flag, turning his back on the guards of the city, and\r\nsaluting those of the camp. On both sides loud cries arose\xe2\x80\x94on the one\r\nside cries of anger, on the other cries of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nA second discharge followed the first, and three balls, by passing\r\nthrough it, made the napkin really a flag. Cries were heard from the\r\ncamp, \xe2\x80\x9cCome down! come down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos came down; his friends, who anxiously awaited him, saw him\r\nreturned with joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along, Athos, come along!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cnow we have found\r\neverything except money, it would be stupid to be killed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Athos continued to march majestically, whatever remarks his\r\ncompanions made; and they, finding their remarks useless, regulated\r\ntheir pace by his.\r\n\r\nGrimaud and his basket were far in advance, out of the range of the\r\nballs.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are they firing at now? I hear no\r\nballs whistle, and I see nobody!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are firing at the corpses,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the dead cannot return their fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not! They will then fancy it is an ambuscade, they will\r\ndeliberate; and by the time they have found out the pleasantry, we\r\nshall be out of the range of their balls. That renders it useless to\r\nget a pleurisy by too much haste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I comprehend now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the astonished Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s lucky,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\nOn their part, the French, on seeing the four friends return at such a\r\nstep, uttered cries of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAt length a fresh discharge was heard, and this time the balls came\r\nrattling among the stones around the four friends, and whistling\r\nsharply in their ears. The Rochellais had at last taken possession of\r\nthe bastion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese Rochellais are bungling fellows,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9chow many have we\r\nkilled of them\xe2\x80\x94a dozen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr fifteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many did we crush under the wall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight or ten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in exchange for all that not even a scratch! Ah, but what is the\r\nmatter with your hand, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan? It bleeds, seemingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA spent ball?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe have said that Athos loved D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan like a child, and this somber\r\nand inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly grazed a little,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cmy fingers were caught\r\nbetween two stones\xe2\x80\x94that of the wall and that of my ring\xe2\x80\x94and the skin\r\nwas broken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat comes of wearing diamonds, my master,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, disdainfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a diamond. Why the devil,\r\nthen, do we plague ourselves about money, when there is a diamond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell thought of, Porthos; this time you have an idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, drawing himself up at Athos\xe2\x80\x99s compliment;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cas there is a diamond, let us sell it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cit is the queen\xe2\x80\x99s diamond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe stronger reason why it should be sold,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cThe queen\r\nsaving Monsieur de Buckingham, her lover; nothing more just. The queen\r\nsaving us, her friends; nothing more moral. Let us sell the diamond.\r\nWhat says Monsieur the Abb\xc3\xa9? I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask Porthos; his opinion has been\r\ngiven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, blushing as usual, \xe2\x80\x9cthat his ring not\r\ncoming from a mistress, and consequently not being a love token,\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan may sell it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Aramis, you speak like theology personified. Your advice,\r\nthen, is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo sell the diamond,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, gaily, \xe2\x80\x9clet us sell the diamond, and say\r\nno more about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fusillade continued; but the four friends were out of reach, and\r\nthe Rochellais only fired to appease their consciences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith, it was time that idea came into Porthos\xe2\x80\x99s head. Here we are\r\nat the camp; therefore, gentlemen, not a word more of this affair. We\r\nare observed; they are coming to meet us. We shall be carried in\r\ntriumph.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, as we have said, the whole camp was in motion. More than two\r\nthousand persons had assisted, as at a spectacle, in this fortunate but\r\nwild undertaking of the four friends\xe2\x80\x94an undertaking of which they were\r\nfar from suspecting the real motive. Nothing was heard but cries of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLive the Musketeers! Live the Guards!\xe2\x80\x9d M. de Busigny was the first to\r\ncome and shake Athos by the hand, and acknowledge that the wager was\r\nlost. The dragoon and the Swiss followed him, and all their comrades\r\nfollowed the dragoon and the Swiss. There was nothing but\r\nfelicitations, pressures of the hand, and embraces; there was no end to\r\nthe inextinguishable laughter at the Rochellais. The tumult at length\r\nbecame so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot, and\r\nsent La Houdini\xc3\xa8re, his captain of the Guards, to inquire what was\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\nThe affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the cardinal, on seeing La Houdini\xc3\xa8re return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the latter, \xe2\x80\x9cthree Musketeers and a\r\nGuardsman laid a wager with Monsieur de Busigny that they would go and\r\nbreakfast in the bastion St. Gervais; and while breakfasting they held\r\nit for two hours against the enemy, and have killed I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nmany Rochellais.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you inquire the names of those three Musketeers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are their names?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMessieurs Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill my three brave fellows!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the cardinal. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the\r\nGuardsman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill my young scapegrace. Positively, these four men must be on my\r\nside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe same evening the cardinal spoke to M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville of the exploit of\r\nthe morning, which was the talk of the whole camp. M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, who\r\nhad received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes\r\nof it, related it in all its details to his Eminence, not forgetting\r\nthe episode of the napkin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s well, Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal; \xe2\x80\x9cpray let that\r\nnapkin be sent to me. I will have three _fleur-de-lis_ embroidered on\r\nit in gold, and will give it to your company as a standard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, \xe2\x80\x9cthat will be unjust to the\r\nGuardsmen. Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan is not with me; he serves under Monsieur\r\nDessessart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, take him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen four men are so much\r\nattached to one another, it is only fair that they should serve in the\r\nsame company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat same evening M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville announced this good news to the three\r\nMusketeers and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, inviting all four to breakfast with him next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was beside himself with joy. We know that the dream of his\r\nlife had been to become a Musketeer. The three friends were likewise\r\ngreatly delighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cyou had a triumphant idea! As\r\nyou said, we have acquired glory, and were enabled to carry on a\r\nconversation of the highest importance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich we can resume now without anybody suspecting us, for, with the\r\nhelp of God, we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat evening D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan went to present his respects to M. Dessessart,\r\nand inform him of his promotion.\r\n\r\nM. Dessessart, who esteemed D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, made him offers of help, as\r\nthis change would entail expenses for equipment.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan refused; but thinking the opportunity a good one, he begged\r\nhim to have the diamond he put into his hand valued, as he wished to\r\nturn it into money.\r\n\r\nThe next day, M. Dessessart\xe2\x80\x99s valet came to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s lodging, and\r\ngave him a bag containing seven thousand livres.\r\n\r\nThis was the price of the queen\xe2\x80\x99s diamond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVIII.\r\nA FAMILY AFFAIR\r\n\r\n\r\nAthos had invented the phrase, family affair. A family affair was not\r\nsubject to the investigation of the cardinal; a family affair concerned\r\nnobody. People might employ themselves in a family affair before all\r\nthe world. Therefore Athos had invented the phrase, _family affair_.\r\n\r\nAramis had discovered the idea, _the lackeys_.\r\n\r\nPorthos had discovered the means, _the diamond_.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan alone had discovered nothing\xe2\x80\x94he, ordinarily the most\r\ninventive of the four; but it must be also said that the very name of\r\nMilady paralyzed him.\r\n\r\nAh! no, we were mistaken; he had discovered a purchaser for his\r\ndiamond.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast at M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville\xe2\x80\x99s was as gay and cheerful as possible.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan already wore his uniform\xe2\x80\x94for being nearly of the same size\r\nas Aramis, and as Aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who\r\npurchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double, he sold\r\nhis friend a complete outfit.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not\r\nconstantly seen Milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, it was agreed that they should meet again in the\r\nevening at Athos\xe2\x80\x99s lodging, and there finish their plans.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan passed the day in exhibiting his Musketeer\xe2\x80\x99s uniform in\r\nevery street of the camp.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, at the appointed hour, the four friends met. There only\r\nremained three things to decide\xe2\x80\x94what they should write to Milady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother; what they should write to the clever person at Tours; and\r\nwhich should be the lackeys to carry the letters.\r\n\r\nEveryone offered his own. Athos talked of the discretion of Grimaud,\r\nwho never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his mouth. Porthos\r\nboasted of the strength of Mousqueton, who was big enough to thrash\r\nfour men of ordinary size. Aramis, confiding in the address of Bazin,\r\nmade a pompous eulogium on his candidate. Finally, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had\r\nentire faith in the bravery of Planchet, and reminded them of the\r\nmanner in which he had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of\r\nBoulogne.\r\n\r\nThese four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time, and gave\r\nbirth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they\r\nshould be deemed too long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9che whom we send must possess in himself\r\nalone the four qualities united.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where is such a lackey to be found?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to be found!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cI know it well, so take Grimaud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake Mousqueton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake Bazin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake Planchet. Planchet is brave and shrewd; they are two qualities\r\nout of the four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cthe principal question is not to know which\r\nof our four lackeys is the most discreet, the most strong, the most\r\nclever, or the most brave; the principal thing is to know which loves\r\nmoney the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Aramis says is very sensible,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must speculate\r\nupon the faults of people, and not upon their virtues. Monsieur Abb\xc3\xa9,\r\nyou are a great moralist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cfor we not only require to be well served in\r\norder to succeed, but moreover, not to fail; for in case of failure,\r\nheads are in question, not for our lackeys\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak lower, Aramis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s wise\xe2\x80\x94not for the lackeys,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cbut for the\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x94for the _masters_, we may say. Are our lackeys sufficiently\r\ndevoted to us to risk their lives for us? No.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cI would almost answer for Planchet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear friend, add to his natural devotedness a good sum of\r\nmoney, and then, instead of answering for him once, answer for him\r\ntwice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, good God! you will be deceived just the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, who\r\nwas an optimist when things were concerned, and a pessimist when men\r\nwere in question. \xe2\x80\x9cThey will promise everything for the sake of the\r\nmoney, and on the road fear will prevent them from acting. Once taken,\r\nthey will be pressed; when pressed, they will confess everything. What\r\nthe devil! we are not children. To reach England\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Athos lowered his\r\nvoice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9call France, covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal,\r\nmust be crossed. A passport for embarkation must be obtained; and the\r\nparty must be acquainted with English in order to ask the way to\r\nLondon. Really, I think the thing very difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who was anxious the matter should be\r\naccomplished; \xe2\x80\x9con the contrary, I think it very easy. It would be, no\r\ndoubt, _parbleu_, if we write to Lord de Winter about affairs of vast\r\nimportance, of the horrors of the cardinal\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak lower!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94of intrigues and secrets of state,\xe2\x80\x9d continued D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, complying\r\nwith the recommendation. \xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no doubt we would all be broken\r\non the wheel; but for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, do not forget, as you yourself said,\r\nAthos, that we only write to him concerning a family affair; that we\r\nonly write to him to entreat that as soon as Milady arrives in London\r\nhe will put it out of her power to injure us. I will write to him,\r\nthen, nearly in these terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, assuming in advance a critical look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Monsieur and dear friend_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes! _Dear friend_ to an Englishman,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cwell\r\ncommenced! Bravo, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan! Only with that word you would be\r\nquartered instead of being broken on the wheel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps. I will say, then, _Monsieur_, quite short.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may even say, _My Lord_,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos, who stickled for\r\npropriety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_My Lord, do you remember the little goat pasture of the Luxembourg?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood, _the Luxembourg!_ One might believe this is an allusion to the\r\nqueen-mother! That\xe2\x80\x99s ingenious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, we will put simply, _My Lord, do you remember a certain\r\nlittle enclosure where your life was spared?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, you will never make anything but a very bad\r\nsecretary. _Where your life was spared!_ For shame! that\xe2\x80\x99s unworthy. A\r\nman of spirit is not to be reminded of such services. A benefit\r\nreproached is an offense committed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are insupportable. If the letter\r\nmust be written under your censure, my faith, I renounce the task.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will do right. Handle the musket and the sword, my dear\r\nfellow. You will come off splendidly at those two exercises; but pass\r\nthe pen over to Monsieur Abb\xc3\xa9. That\xe2\x80\x99s his province.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cpass the pen to Aramis, who writes theses in\r\nLatin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, so be it,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cDraw up this note for us, Aramis;\r\nbut by our Holy Father the Pope, cut it short, for I shall prune you in\r\nmy turn, I warn you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask no better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, with that ingenious air of confidence\r\nwhich every poet has in himself; \xe2\x80\x9cbut let me be properly acquainted\r\nwith the subject. I have heard here and there that this sister-in-law\r\nwas a hussy. I have obtained proof of it by listening to her\r\nconversation with the cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLower! _sacr\xc3\xa9 bleu!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cthe details escape me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me also,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and Athos looked at each other for some time in silence. At\r\nlength Athos, after serious reflection and becoming more pale than\r\nusual, made a sign of assent to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who by it understood he was\r\nat liberty to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is what you have to say,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan: \xe2\x80\x9c_My Lord, your\r\nsister-in-law is an infamous woman, who wished to have you killed that\r\nshe might inherit your wealth; but she could not marry your brother,\r\nbeing already married in France, and having been_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan stopped,\r\nas if seeking for the word, and looked at Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRepudiated by her husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she had been branded,\xe2\x80\x9d continued D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cImpossible! What do you say\xe2\x80\x94that she wanted to\r\nhave her brother-in-law killed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was married?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd her husband found out that she had a _fleur-de-lis_ on her\r\nshoulder?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese three _yeses_ had been pronounced by Athos, each with a sadder\r\nintonation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who has seen this _fleur-de-lis?_\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and I. Or rather, to observe the chronological order, I and\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd does the husband of this frightful creature still live?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe still lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite sure of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of cold silence, during which everyone was affected\r\naccording to his nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, first breaking the silence, \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan has\r\ngiven us an excellent program, and the letter must be written at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil! You are right, Athos,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis; \xe2\x80\x9cand it is a rather\r\ndifficult matter. The chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write\r\nsuch a letter, and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very\r\nreadily. Never mind! Be silent, I will write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis accordingly took the quill, reflected for a few moments, wrote\r\neight or ten lines in a charming little female hand, and then with a\r\nvoice soft and slow, as if each word had been scrupulously weighed, he\r\nread the following:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord, The person who writes these few lines had the honor of\r\ncrossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the Rue d\xe2\x80\x99Enfer. As\r\nyou have several times since declared yourself the friend of that\r\nperson, he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending\r\nyou important information. Twice you have nearly been the victim of a\r\nnear relative, whom you believe to be your heir because you are\r\nignorant that before she contracted a marriage in England she was\r\nalready married in France. But the third time, which is the present,\r\nyou may succumb. Your relative left La Rochelle for England during the\r\nnight. Watch her arrival, for she has great and terrible projects. If\r\nyou require to know positively what she is capable of, read her past\r\nhistory on her left shoulder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now that will do wonderfully well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Aramis,\r\nyou have the pen of a secretary of state. Lord de Winter will now be\r\nupon his guard if the letter should reach him; and even if it should\r\nfall into the hands of the cardinal, we shall not be compromised. But\r\nas the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to London and\r\nmay stop at Ch\xc3\xa2tellerault, let us give him only half the sum promised\r\nhim, with the letter, with an agreement that he shall have the other\r\nhalf in exchange for the reply. Have you the diamond?\xe2\x80\x9d continued Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have what is still better. I have the price;\xe2\x80\x9d and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan threw\r\nthe bag upon the table. At the sound of the gold Aramis raised his eyes\r\nand Porthos started. As to Athos, he remained unmoved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much in that little bag?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven thousand livres, in louis of twelve francs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven thousand livres!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cThat poor little diamond was\r\nworth seven thousand livres?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9csince here they are. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose that\r\nour friend D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan has added any of his own to the amount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, gentlemen, in all this,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cwe do not think of the\r\nqueen. Let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear Buckingham.\r\nThat is the least we owe her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that concerns Aramis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the latter, blushing, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat must I say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s simple enough!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cWrite a second letter for\r\nthat clever personage who lives at Tours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis resumed his pen, reflected a little, and wrote the following\r\nlines, which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_My dear cousin_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cThis clever person is your relative, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCousin-german.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, to your cousin, then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR COUSIN, His Eminence, the cardinal, whom God preserve for the\r\nhappiness of France and the confusion of the enemies of the kingdom, is\r\non the point of putting an end to the hectic rebellion of La Rochelle.\r\nIt is probable that the succor of the English fleet will never even\r\narrive in sight of the place. I will even venture to say that I am\r\ncertain M. de Buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some\r\ngreat event. His Eminence is the most illustrious politician of times\r\npast, of times present, and probably of times to come. He would\r\nextinguish the sun if the sun incommoded him. Give these happy tidings\r\nto your sister, my dear cousin. I have dreamed that the unlucky\r\nEnglishman was dead. I cannot recollect whether it was by steel or by\r\npoison; only of this I am sure, I have dreamed he was dead, and you\r\nknow my dreams never deceive me. Be assured, then, of seeing me soon\r\nreturn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapital!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are the king of poets, my dear Aramis. You\r\nspeak like the Apocalypse, and you are as true as the Gospel. There is\r\nnothing now to do but to put the address to this letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is easily done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\nHe folded the letter fancifully, and took up his pen and wrote:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_To Mlle. Michon, seamstress, Tours_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three friends looked at one another and laughed; they were caught.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will please to understand, gentlemen, that\r\nBazin alone can carry this letter to Tours. My cousin knows nobody but\r\nBazin, and places confidence in nobody but him; any other person would\r\nfail. Besides, Bazin is ambitious and learned; Bazin has read history,\r\ngentlemen, he knows that Sixtus the Fifth became Pope after having kept\r\npigs. Well, as he means to enter the Church at the same time as myself,\r\nhe does not despair of becoming Pope in his turn, or at least a\r\ncardinal. You can understand that a man who has such views will never\r\nallow himself to be taken, or if taken, will undergo martyrdom rather\r\nthan speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI consent to Bazin with all my heart,\r\nbut grant me Planchet. Milady had him one day turned out of doors, with\r\nsundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions. Now, Planchet\r\nhas an excellent memory; and I will be bound that sooner than\r\nrelinquish any possible means of vengeance, he will allow himself to be\r\nbeaten to death. If your arrangements at Tours are your arrangements,\r\nAramis, those of London are mine. I request, then, that Planchet may be\r\nchosen, more particularly as he has already been to London with me, and\r\nknows how to speak correctly: _London, sir, if you please, and my\r\nmaster, Lord D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan_. With that you may be satisfied he can make\r\nhis way, both going and returning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cPlanchet must receive seven hundred livres\r\nfor going, and seven hundred livres for coming back; and Bazin, three\r\nhundred livres for going, and three hundred livres for returning\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwill reduce the sum to five thousand livres. We will each take a\r\nthousand livres to be employed as seems good, and we will leave a fund\r\nof a thousand livres under the guardianship of Monsieur Abb\xc3\xa9 here, for\r\nextraordinary occasions or common wants. Will that do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Athos,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cyou speak like Nestor, who was, as\r\neveryone knows, the wisest among the Greeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cit is agreed. Planchet and Bazin shall go.\r\nEverything considered, I am not sorry to retain Grimaud; he is\r\naccustomed to my ways, and I am particular. Yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s affair must\r\nhave shaken him a little; his voyage would upset him quite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPlanchet was sent for, and instructions were given him. The matter had\r\nbeen named to him by D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who in the first place pointed out the\r\nmoney to him, then the glory, and then the danger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will carry the letter in the lining of my coat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nif I am taken I will swallow it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will give me a copy this evening, which I shall know by heart\r\ntomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan looked at his friends, as if to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what did I tell\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, addressing Planchet, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have eight days to get\r\nan interview with Lord de Winter; you have eight days to return\xe2\x80\x94in all\r\nsixteen days. If, on the sixteenth day after your departure, at eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening you are not here, no money\xe2\x80\x94even if it be but\r\nfive minutes past eight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must buy me a watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, with his usual careless generosity, giving him\r\nhis own, \xe2\x80\x9cand be a good lad. Remember, if you talk, if you babble, if\r\nyou get drunk, you risk your master\xe2\x80\x99s head, who has so much confidence\r\nin your fidelity, and who answers for you. But remember, also, that if\r\nby your fault any evil happens to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, I will find you, wherever\r\nyou may be, for the purpose of ripping up your belly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet, humiliated by the suspicion, and\r\nmoreover, terrified at the calm air of the Musketeer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, rolling his large eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cremember, I will skin\r\nyou alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, with his soft, melodius voice, \xe2\x80\x9cremember that I\r\nwill roast you at a slow fire, like a savage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPlanchet began to weep. We will not venture to say whether it was from\r\nterror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends\r\nso closely united.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan took his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cSee, Planchet,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthese gentlemen\r\nonly say this out of affection for me, but at bottom they all like\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet, \xe2\x80\x9cI will succeed or I will consent to be\r\ncut in quarters; and if they do cut me in quarters, be assured that not\r\na morsel of me will speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was decided that Planchet should set out the next day, at eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, in order, as he had said, that he might during\r\nthe night learn the letter by heart. He gained just twelve hours by\r\nthis engagement; he was to be back on the sixteenth day, by eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, as he was mounting his horse, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who felt at\r\nthe bottom of his heart a partiality for the duke, took Planchet aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have given the letter to Lord de\r\nWinter and he has read it, you will further say to him: _Watch over his\r\nGrace Lord Buckingham, for they wish to assassinate him_. But this,\r\nPlanchet, is so serious and important that I have not informed my\r\nfriends that I would entrust this secret to you; and for a captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncommission I would not write it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe satisfied, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall see if confidence\r\ncan be placed in me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMounted on an excellent horse, which he was to leave at the end of\r\ntwenty leagues in order to take the post, Planchet set off at a gallop,\r\nhis spirits a little depressed by the triple promise made him by the\r\nMusketeers, but otherwise as light-hearted as possible.\r\n\r\nBazin set out the next day for Tours, and was allowed eight days for\r\nperforming his commission.\r\n\r\nThe four friends, during the period of these two absences, had, as may\r\nwell be supposed, the eye on the watch, the nose to the wind, and the\r\near on the hark. Their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all\r\nthat was said, in observing the proceeding of the cardinal, and in\r\nlooking out for all the couriers who arrived. More than once an\r\ninvoluntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected\r\nservice. They had, besides, to look constantly to their own proper\r\nsafety; Milady was a phantom which, when it had once appeared to\r\npeople, did not allow them to sleep very quietly.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the eighth day, Bazin, fresh as ever, and smiling,\r\naccording to custom, entered the cabaret of the Parpaillot as the four\r\nfriends were sitting down to breakfast, saying, as had been agreed\r\nupon: \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Aramis, the answer from your cousin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe four friends exchanged a joyful glance; half of the work was done.\r\nIt is true, however, that it was the shorter and easier part.\r\n\r\nAramis, blushing in spite of himself, took the letter, which was in a\r\nlarge, coarse hand and not particular for its orthography.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cI quite despair of my poor Michon; she\r\nwill never write like Monsieur de Voiture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does you mean by boor Michon?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Swiss, who was chatting\r\nwith the four friends when the letter came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _pardieu_, less than nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis; \xe2\x80\x9ca charming little\r\nseamstress, whom I love dearly and from whose hand I requested a few\r\nlines as a sort of keepsake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe duvil!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Swiss, \xe2\x80\x9cif she is as great a lady as her writing\r\nis large, you are a lucky fellow, gomrade!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis read the letter, and passed it to Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee what she writes to me, Athos,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nAthos cast a glance over the epistle, and to disperse all the\r\nsuspicions that might have been created, read aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY COUSIN, My sister and I are skillful in interpreting dreams, and\r\neven entertain great fear of them; but of yours it may be said, I hope,\r\nevery dream is an illusion. Adieu! Take care of yourself, and act so\r\nthat we may from time to time hear you spoken of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMARIE MICHON\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what dream does she mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the dragoon, who had approached\r\nduring the reading.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYez; what\xe2\x80\x99s the dream?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Swiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _pardieu!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cit was only this: I had a dream, and I\r\nrelated it to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYez, yez,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Swiss; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s simple enough to dell a dream, but I\r\nneffer dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very fortunate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, rising; \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could say as\r\nmuch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeffer,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Swiss, enchanted that a man like Athos could envy\r\nhim anything. \xe2\x80\x9cNeffer, neffer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, seeing Athos rise, did likewise, took his arm, and went\r\nout.\r\n\r\nPorthos and Aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the\r\ndragoon and the Swiss.\r\n\r\nAs to Bazin, he went and lay down on a truss of straw; and as he had\r\nmore imagination than the Swiss, he dreamed that Aramis, having become\r\npope, adorned his head with a cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s hat.\r\n\r\nBut, as we have said, Bazin had not, by his fortunate return, removed\r\nmore than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends.\r\nThe days of expectation are long, and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in particular, would\r\nhave wagered that the days were forty-four hours. He forgot the\r\nnecessary slowness of navigation; he exaggerated to himself the power\r\nof Milady. He credited this woman, who appeared to him the equal of a\r\ndemon, with agents as supernatural as herself; at the least noise, he\r\nimagined himself about to be arrested, and that Planchet was being\r\nbrought back to be confronted with himself and his friends. Still\r\nfurther, his confidence in the worthy Picard, at one time so great,\r\ndiminished day by day. This anxiety became so great that it even\r\nextended to Aramis and Porthos. Athos alone remained unmoved, as if no\r\ndanger hovered over him, and as if he breathed his customary\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nOn the sixteenth day, in particular, these signs were so strong in\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one\r\nplace, and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which Planchet was\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos to them, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not men but children, to let a\r\nwoman terrify you so! And what does it amount to, after all? To be\r\nimprisoned. Well, but we should be taken out of prison; Madame\r\nBonacieux was released. To be decapitated? Why, every day in the\r\ntrenches we go cheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than that\xe2\x80\x94for a\r\nbullet may break a leg, and I am convinced a surgeon would give us more\r\npain in cutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head.\r\nWait quietly, then; in two hours, in four, in six hours at latest,\r\nPlanchet will be here. He promised to be here, and I have very great\r\nfaith in Planchet, who appears to me to be a very good lad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if he does not come?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if he does not come, it will be because he has been delayed,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all. He may have fallen from his horse, he may have cut a caper\r\nfrom the deck; he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have\r\nbrought on a violent catarrh. Eh, gentlemen, let us reckon upon\r\naccidents! Life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher\r\ncounts with a smile. Be philosophers, as I am, gentlemen; sit down at\r\nthe table and let us drink. Nothing makes the future look so bright as\r\nsurveying it through a glass of chambertin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all very well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am tired of fearing\r\nwhen I open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of\r\nMilady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very fastidious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9csuch a beautiful woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman of mark!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos, with his loud laugh.\r\n\r\nAthos started, passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of\r\nperspiration that burst forth, and rose in his turn with a nervous\r\nmovement he could not repress.\r\n\r\nThe day, however, passed away; and the evening came on slowly, but\r\nfinally it came. The bars were filled with drinkers. Athos, who had\r\npocketed his share of the diamond, seldom quit the Parpaillot. He had\r\nfound in M. de Busigny, who, by the by, had given them a magnificent\r\ndinner, a partner worthy of his company. They were playing together, as\r\nusual, when seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock sounded; the patrol was heard passing to\r\ndouble the posts. At half past seven the retreat was sounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are lost,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in the ear of Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to say we _have lost_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, quietly, drawing four\r\npistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table. \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\r\ngentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are beating the tattoo. Let us to bed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Athos went out of the Parpaillot, followed by D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. Aramis\r\ncame behind, giving his arm to Porthos. Aramis mumbled verses to\r\nhimself, and Porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his\r\nmustache, in sign of despair.\r\n\r\nBut all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which\r\nwas familiar to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and a well-known voice said, \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, I\r\nhave brought your cloak; it is chilly this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlanchet!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, beside himself with joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlanchet!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Aramis and Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, Planchet, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is there so\r\nastonishing in that? He promised to be back by eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and eight\r\nis striking. Bravo, Planchet, you are a lad of your word, and if ever\r\nyou leave your master, I will promise you a place in my service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, never,\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet, \xe2\x80\x9cI will never leave Monsieur\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same time D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan felt that Planchet slipped a note into his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace Planchet as he had\r\nembraced him on his departure; but he feared lest this mark of\r\naffection, bestowed upon his lackey in the open street, might appear\r\nextraordinary to passers-by, and he restrained himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the note,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Athos and to his friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9clet us go home and read it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe note burned the hand of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. He wished to hasten their\r\nsteps; but Athos took his arm and passed it under his own, and the\r\nyoung man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend.\r\n\r\nAt length they reached the tent, lit a lamp, and while Planchet stood\r\nat the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised,\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with a trembling hand, broke the seal and opened the so\r\nanxiously expected letter.\r\n\r\nIt contained half a line, in a hand perfectly British, and with a\r\nconciseness as perfectly Spartan:\r\n\r\n_Thank you; be easy_.\r\n\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan translated this for the others.\r\n\r\nAthos took the letter from the hands of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, approached the\r\nlamp, set fire to the paper, and did not let go till it was reduced to\r\na cinder.\r\n\r\nThen, calling Planchet, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, my lad, you may claim your seven\r\nhundred livres, but you did not run much risk with such a note as\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPlanchet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9ctell us all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Dame_, that\xe2\x80\x99s a long job, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, Planchet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cbesides, the tattoo has been\r\nsounded, and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much\r\nlonger than the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cGo to bed, Planchet, and sleep soundly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith, monsieur! that will be the first time I have done so for\r\nsixteen days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me, too!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me, too!\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me, too!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you will have the truth, and me, too!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIX.\r\nFATALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime Milady, drunk with passion, roaring on the deck like a lioness\r\nthat has been embarked, had been tempted to throw herself into the sea\r\nthat she might regain the coast, for she could not get rid of the\r\nthought that she had been insulted by D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, threatened by Athos,\r\nand that she had quit France without being revenged on them. This idea\r\nsoon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever\r\nterrible consequences might result to herself from it, she implored the\r\ncaptain to put her on shore; but the captain, eager to escape from his\r\nfalse position\xe2\x80\x94placed between French and English cruisers, like the bat\r\nbetween the mice and the birds\xe2\x80\x94was in great haste to regain England,\r\nand positively refused to obey what he took for a woman\xe2\x80\x99s caprice,\r\npromising his passenger, who had been particularly recommended to him\r\nby the cardinal, to land her, if the sea and the French permitted him,\r\nat one of the ports of Brittany, either at Lorient or Brest. But the\r\nwind was contrary, the sea bad; they tacked and kept offshore. Nine\r\ndays after leaving the Charente, pale with fatigue and vexation, Milady\r\nsaw only the blue coasts of Finisterre appear.\r\n\r\nShe calculated that to cross this corner of France and return to the\r\ncardinal it would take her at least three days. Add another day for\r\nlanding, and that would make four. Add these four to the nine others,\r\nthat would be thirteen days lost\xe2\x80\x94thirteen days, during which so many\r\nimportant events might pass in London. She reflected likewise that the\r\ncardinal would be furious at her return, and consequently would be more\r\ndisposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the\r\naccusations she brought against others.\r\n\r\nShe allowed the vessel to pass Lorient and Brest without repeating her\r\nrequest to the captain, who, on his part, took care not to remind her\r\nof it. Milady therefore continued her voyage, and on the very day that\r\nPlanchet embarked at Portsmouth for France, the messenger of his\r\nEminence entered the port in triumph.\r\n\r\nAll the city was agitated by an extraordinary movement. Four large\r\nvessels, recently built, had just been launched. At the end of the\r\njetty, his clothes richly laced with gold, glittering, as was customary\r\nwith him, with diamonds and precious stones, his hat ornamented with a\r\nwhite feather which drooped upon his shoulder, Buckingham was seen\r\nsurrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when England\r\nremembers that there is a sun. The star of day, pale but nevertheless\r\nstill splendid, was setting in the horizon, glorifying at once the\r\nheavens and the sea with bands of fire, and casting upon the towers and\r\nthe old houses of the city a last ray of gold which made the windows\r\nsparkle like the reflection of a conflagration. Breathing that sea\r\nbreeze, so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is\r\napproached, contemplating all the power of those preparations she was\r\ncommissioned to destroy, all the power of that army which she was to\r\ncombat alone\xe2\x80\x94she, a woman with a few bags of gold\xe2\x80\x94Milady compared\r\nherself mentally to Judith, the terrible Jewess, when she penetrated\r\nthe camp of the Assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots,\r\nhorses, men, and arms, which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate\r\nlike a cloud of smoke.\r\n\r\nThey entered the roadstead; but as they drew near in order to cast\r\nanchor, a little cutter, looking like a coastguard formidably armed,\r\napproached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which\r\ndirected its course to the ladder. This boat contained an officer, a\r\nmate, and eight rowers. The officer alone went on board, where he was\r\nreceived with all the deference inspired by the uniform.\r\n\r\nThe officer conversed a few instants with the captain, gave him several\r\npapers, of which he was the bearer, to read, and upon the order of the\r\nmerchant captain the whole crew of the vessel, both passengers and\r\nsailors, were called upon deck.\r\n\r\nWhen this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the\r\npoint of the brig\xe2\x80\x99s departure, its route, its landings; and to all\r\nthese questions the captain replied without difficulty and without\r\nhesitation. Then the officer began to pass in review all the people,\r\none after the other, and stopping when he came to Milady, surveyed her\r\nvery closely, but without addressing a single word to her.\r\n\r\nHe then returned to the captain, said a few words to him, and as if\r\nfrom that moment the vessel was under his command, he ordered a\r\nmaneuver which the crew executed immediately. Then the vessel resumed\r\nits course, still escorted by the little cutter, which sailed side by\r\nside with it, menacing it with the mouths of its six cannon. The boat\r\nfollowed in the wake of the ship, a speck near the enormous mass.\r\n\r\nDuring the examination of Milady by the officer, as may well be\r\nimagined, Milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances.\r\nBut however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in\r\nreading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine, she met\r\nthis time with a countenance of such impassivity that no discovery\r\nfollowed her investigation. The officer who had stopped in front of her\r\nand studied her with so much care might have been twenty-five or\r\ntwenty-six years of age. He was of pale complexion, with clear blue\r\neyes, rather deeply set; his mouth, fine and well cut, remained\r\nmotionless in its correct lines; his chin, strongly marked, denoted\r\nthat strength of will which in the ordinary Britannic type denotes\r\nmostly nothing but obstinacy; a brow a little receding, as is proper\r\nfor poets, enthusiasts, and soldiers, was scarcely shaded by short thin\r\nhair which, like the beard which covered the lower part of his face,\r\nwas of a beautiful deep chestnut color.\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the port, it was already night. The fog increased the\r\ndarkness, and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a\r\ncircle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to\r\nbecome rainy. The air they breathed was heavy, damp, and cold.\r\n\r\nMilady, that woman so courageous and firm, shivered in spite of\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThe officer desired to have Milady\xe2\x80\x99s packages pointed out to him, and\r\nordered them to be placed in the boat. When this operation was\r\ncomplete, he invited her to descend by offering her his hand.\r\n\r\nMilady looked at this man, and hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cWho are you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nshe, \xe2\x80\x9cwho has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my\r\naccount?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may perceive, madame, by my uniform, that I am an officer in the\r\nEnglish navy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it the custom for the officers in the English navy to place\r\nthemselves at the service of their female compatriots when they land in\r\na port of Great Britain, and carry their gallantry so far as to conduct\r\nthem ashore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madame, it is the custom, not from gallantry but prudence, that\r\nin time of war foreigners should be conducted to particular h\xc3\xb4tels, in\r\norder that they may remain under the eye of the government until full\r\ninformation can be obtained about them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most\r\nperfect calmness. Nevertheless, they had not the power of convincing\r\nMilady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not a foreigner, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with an accent as pure as\r\never was heard between Portsmouth and Manchester; \xe2\x80\x9cmy name is Lady\r\nClarik, and this measure\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis measure is general, madame; and you will seek in vain to evade\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will follow you, then, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccepting the hand of the officer, she began the descent of the ladder,\r\nat the foot of which the boat waited. The officer followed her. A large\r\ncloak was spread at the stern; the officer requested her to sit down\r\nupon this cloak, and placed himself beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRow!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the sailors.\r\n\r\nThe eight oars fell at once into the sea, making but a single sound,\r\ngiving but a single stroke, and the boat seemed to fly over the surface\r\nof the water.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes they gained the land.\r\n\r\nThe officer leaped to the pier, and offered his hand to Milady. A\r\ncarriage was in waiting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this carriage for us?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe h\xc3\xb4tel, then, is far away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the other end of the town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady; and she resolutely entered the carriage.\r\n\r\nThe officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the\r\ncarriage; and this operation ended, he took his place beside Milady,\r\nand shut the door.\r\n\r\nImmediately, without any order being given or his place of destination\r\nindicated, the coachman set off at a rapid pace, and plunged into the\r\nstreets of the city.\r\n\r\nSo strange a reception naturally gave Milady ample matter for\r\nreflection; so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all\r\ndisposed for conversation, she reclined in her corner of the carriage,\r\nand one after the other passed in review all the surmises which\r\npresented themselves to her mind.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a quarter of an hour, however, surprised at the length of\r\nthe journey, she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was\r\nbeing conducted. Houses were no longer to be seen; trees appeared in\r\nthe darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another. Milady\r\nshuddered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we are no longer in the city, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nThe young officer preserved silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg you to understand, sir, I will go no farther unless you tell me\r\nwhither you are taking me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis threat brought no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, this is too much,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady. \xe2\x80\x9cHelp! help!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo voice replied to hers; the carriage continued to roll on with\r\nrapidity; the officer seemed a statue.\r\n\r\nMilady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions\r\npeculiar to her countenance, and which so rarely failed of their\r\neffect; anger made her eyes flash in the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe young man remained immovable.\r\n\r\nMilady tried to open the door in order to throw herself out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, coolly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will kill\r\nyourself in jumping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady reseated herself, foaming. The officer leaned forward, looked at\r\nher in his turn, and appeared surprised to see that face, just before\r\nso beautiful, distorted with passion and almost hideous. The artful\r\ncreature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing\r\nhim thus to read her soul; she collected her features, and in a\r\ncomplaining voice said: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of heaven, sir, tell me if it is\r\nto you, if it is to your government, if it is to an enemy I am to\r\nattribute the violence that is done me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo violence will be offered to you, madame, and what happens to you is\r\nthe result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with\r\nall who land in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you don\xe2\x80\x99t know me, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the first time I have had the honor of seeing you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd on your honor, you have no cause of hatred against me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone, I swear to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was so much serenity, coolness, mildness even, in the voice of\r\nthe young man, that Milady felt reassured.\r\n\r\nAt length after a journey of nearly an hour, the carriage stopped\r\nbefore an iron gate, which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe\r\nin form, massive, and isolated. Then, as the wheels rolled over a fine\r\ngravel, Milady could hear a vast roaring, which she at once recognized\r\nas the noise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff.\r\n\r\nThe carriage passed under two arched gateways, and at length stopped in\r\na court large, dark, and square. Almost immediately the door of the\r\ncarriage was opened, the young man sprang lightly out and presented his\r\nhand to Milady, who leaned upon it, and in her turn alighted with\r\ntolerable calmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, then, I am a prisoner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, looking around her, and\r\nbringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I feel assured it will not be for long,\xe2\x80\x9d added she. \xe2\x80\x9cMy own\r\nconscience and your politeness, sir, are the guarantees of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever flattering this compliment, the officer made no reply; but\r\ndrawing from his belt a little silver whistle, such as boatswains use\r\nin ships of war, he whistled three times, with three different\r\nmodulations. Immediately several men appeared, who unharnessed the\r\nsmoking horses, and put the carriage into a coach house.\r\n\r\nThen the officer, with the same calm politeness, invited his prisoner\r\nto enter the house. She, with a still-smiling countenance, took his\r\narm, and passed with him under a low arched door, which by a vaulted\r\npassage, lighted only at the farther end, led to a stone staircase\r\naround an angle of stone. They then came to a massive door, which after\r\nthe introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried\r\nwith him, turned heavily upon its hinges, and disclosed the chamber\r\ndestined for Milady.\r\n\r\nWith a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest\r\ndetails. It was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a\r\nprisoner or a free man; and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts\r\nat the door decided the question in favor of the prison.\r\n\r\nIn an instant all the strength of mind of this creature, though drawn\r\nfrom the most vigorous sources, abandoned her; she sank into a large\r\neasy chair, with her arms crossed, her head lowered, and expecting\r\nevery instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her.\r\n\r\nBut no one entered except two or three marines, who brought her trunks\r\nand packages, deposited them in a corner, and retired without speaking.\r\n\r\nThe officer superintended all these details with the same calmness\r\nMilady had constantly seen in him, never pronouncing a word himself,\r\nand making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his\r\nwhistle.\r\n\r\nIt might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken\r\nlanguage did not exist, or had become useless.\r\n\r\nAt length Milady could hold out no longer; she broke the silence. \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nthe name of heaven, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat means all that is passing?\r\nPut an end to my doubts; I have courage enough for any danger I can\r\nforesee, for every misfortune which I understand. Where am I, and why\r\nam I here? If I am free, why these bars and these doors? If I am a\r\nprisoner, what crime have I committed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are here in the apartment destined for you, madame. I received\r\norders to go and take charge of you on the sea, and to conduct you to\r\nthis castle. This order I believe I have accomplished with all the\r\nexactness of a soldier, but also with the courtesy of a gentleman.\r\nThere terminates, at least to the present moment, the duty I had to\r\nfulfill toward you; the rest concerns another person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is that other person?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady, warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you not tell\r\nme his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs. Some\r\nvoices passed and faded away, and the sound of a single footstep\r\napproached the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat person is here, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, leaving the entrance\r\nopen, and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the door opened; a man appeared on the threshold. He\r\nwas without a hat, carried a sword, and flourished a handkerchief in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nMilady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom; she supported\r\nherself with one hand upon the arm of the chair, and advanced her head\r\nas if to meet a certainty.\r\n\r\nThe stranger advanced slowly, and as he advanced, after entering into\r\nthe circle of light projected by the lamp, Milady involuntarily drew\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThen when she had no longer any doubt, she cried, in a state of stupor,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, my brother, is it you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, fair lady!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lord de Winter, making a bow, half courteous,\r\nhalf ironical; \xe2\x80\x9cit is I, myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this castle, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis chamber?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am, then, your prisoner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearly so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is a frightful abuse of power!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo high-sounding words! Let us sit down and chat quietly, as brother\r\nand sister ought to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, turning toward the door, and seeing that the young officer was\r\nwaiting for his last orders, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAll is well, I thank you; now\r\nleave us alone, Mr. Felton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter L.\r\nCHAT BETWEEN BROTHER AND SISTER\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the time which Lord de Winter took to shut the door, close a\r\nshutter, and draw a chair near to his sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s _fauteuil_,\r\nMilady, anxiously thoughtful, plunged her glance into the depths of\r\npossibility, and discovered all the plan, of which she could not even\r\nobtain a glance as long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had\r\nfallen. She knew her brother-in-law to be a worthy gentleman, a bold\r\nhunter, an intrepid player, enterprising with women, but by no means\r\nremarkable for his skill in intrigues. How had he discovered her\r\narrival, and caused her to be seized? Why did he detain her?\r\n\r\nAthos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had\r\nwith the cardinal had fallen into outside ears; but she could not\r\nsuppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly. She\r\nrather feared that her preceding operations in England might have been\r\ndiscovered. Buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut\r\noff the two studs, and avenge himself for that little treachery; but\r\nBuckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman,\r\nparticularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of\r\njealousy.\r\n\r\nThis supposition appeared to her most reasonable. It seemed to her that\r\nthey wanted to revenge the past, and not to anticipate the future. At\r\nall events, she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands\r\nof her brother-in-law, with whom she reckoned she could deal very\r\neasily, rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, let us chat, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with a kind of cheerfulness,\r\ndecided as she was to draw from the conversation, in spite of all the\r\ndissimulation Lord de Winter could bring, the revelations of which she\r\nstood in need to regulate her future conduct.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have, then, decided to come to England again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord de\r\nWinter, \xe2\x80\x9cin spite of the resolutions you so often expressed in Paris\r\nnever to set your feet on British ground?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady replied to this question by another question. \xe2\x80\x9cTo begin with,\r\ntell me,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9chow have you watched me so closely as to be aware\r\nbeforehand not only of my arrival, but even of the day, the hour, and\r\nthe port at which I should arrive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord de Winter adopted the same tactics as Milady, thinking that as his\r\nsister-in-law employed them they must be the best.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me, my dear sister,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat makes you come to\r\nEngland?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady, without knowing how much she\r\naggravated by this reply the suspicions to which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\nhad given birth in the mind of her brother-in-law, and only desiring to\r\ngain the good will of her auditor by a falsehood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d said de Winter, cunningly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, to see you. What is there astonishing in that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you had no other object in coming to England but to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the\r\nChannel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce! What tenderness, my sister!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut am I not your nearest relative?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Milady, with a tone of\r\nthe most touching ingenuousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my only heir, are you not?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord de Winter in his turn,\r\nfixing his eyes on those of Milady.\r\n\r\nWhatever command she had over herself, Milady could not help starting;\r\nand as in pronouncing the last words Lord de Winter placed his hand\r\nupon the arm of his sister, this start did not escape him.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the blow was direct and severe. The first idea that occurred\r\nto Milady\xe2\x80\x99s mind was that she had been betrayed by Kitty, and that she\r\nhad recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which\r\nshe had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant.\r\nShe also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan when he spared the life of her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in order to gain time and\r\nmake her adversary speak out. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean to say? Is there any\r\nsecret meaning concealed beneath your words?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord de Winter, with apparent good nature. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwish to see me, and you come to England. I learn this desire, or rather\r\nI suspect that you feel it; and in order to spare you all the\r\nannoyances of a nocturnal arrival in a port and all the fatigues of\r\nlanding, I send one of my officers to meet you, I place a carriage at\r\nhis orders, and he brings you hither to this castle, of which I am\r\ngovernor, whither I come every day, and where, in order to satisfy our\r\nmutual desire of seeing each other, I have prepared you a chamber. What\r\nis there more astonishing in all that I have said to you than in what\r\nyou have told me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; what I think astonishing is that you should expect my coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet that is the most simple thing in the world, my dear sister.\r\nHave you not observed that the captain of your little vessel, on\r\nentering the roadstead, sent forward, in order to obtain permission to\r\nenter the port, a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of\r\nhis voyagers? I am commandant of the port. They brought me that book. I\r\nrecognized your name in it. My heart told me what your mouth has just\r\nconfirmed\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, with what view you have exposed yourself to\r\nthe dangers of a sea so perilous, or at least so troublesome at this\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x94and I sent my cutter to meet you. You know the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady knew that Lord de Winter lied, and she was the more alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she, \xe2\x80\x9cwas not that my Lord Buckingham whom I\r\nsaw on the jetty this evening as we arrived?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHimself. Ah, I can understand how the sight of him struck you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Lord de Winter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou came from a country where he must be very\r\nmuch talked of, and I know that his armaments against France greatly\r\nengage the attention of your friend the cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend the cardinal!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, seeing that on this point as on\r\nthe other Lord de Winter seemed well instructed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he not your friend?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the baron, negligently. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, pardon! I\r\nthought so; but we will return to my Lord Duke presently. Let us not\r\ndepart from the sentimental turn our conversation had taken. You came,\r\nyou say, to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes,\r\nand that we shall see each other every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I, then, to remain here eternally?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Milady, with a certain\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you find yourself badly lodged, sister? Demand anything you want,\r\nand I will hasten to have you furnished with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have neither my women nor my servants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have all, madame. Tell me on what footing your household was\r\nestablished by your first husband, and although I am only your\r\nbrother-in-law, I will arrange one similar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy first husband!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, looking at Lord de Winter with eyes\r\nalmost starting from their sockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your French husband. I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of my brother. If you have\r\nforgotten, as he is still living, I can write to him and he will send\r\nme information on the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA cold sweat burst from the brow of Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou jest!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in a hollow voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I look so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the baron, rising and going a step backward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr rather you insult me,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she, pressing with her stiffened\r\nhands the two arms of her easy chair, and raising herself upon her\r\nwrists.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI insult you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord de Winter, with contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, madame,\r\ndo you think that can be possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must be either drunk or mad. Leave the\r\nroom, and send me a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen are very indiscreet, my sister. Cannot I serve you as a waiting\r\nmaid? By that means all our secrets will remain in the family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInsolent!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady; and as if acted upon by a spring, she bounded\r\ntoward the baron, who awaited her attack with his arms crossed, but\r\nnevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you are accustomed to assassinate people; but\r\nI warn you I shall defend myself, even against you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have all the appearance of being\r\ncowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps so; and I have an excuse, for mine would not be the first hand\r\nof a man that has been placed upon you, I imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the baron pointed, with a slow and accusing gesture, to the left\r\nshoulder of Milady, which he almost touched with his finger.\r\n\r\nMilady uttered a deep, inward shriek, and retreated to a corner of the\r\nroom like a panther which crouches for a spring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, growl as much as you please,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lord de Winter, \xe2\x80\x9cbut don\xe2\x80\x99t try\r\nto bite, for I warn you that it would be to your disadvantage. There\r\nare here no procurators who regulate successions beforehand. There is\r\nno knight-errant to come and seek a quarrel with me on account of the\r\nfair lady I detain a prisoner; but I have judges quite ready who will\r\nquickly dispose of a woman so shameless as to glide, a bigamist, into\r\nthe bed of Lord de Winter, my brother. And these judges, I warn you,\r\nwill soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders\r\nalike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eyes of Milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and\r\narmed before an unarmed woman, he felt the chill of fear glide through\r\nhis whole frame. However, he continued all the same, but with\r\nincreasing warmth: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I can very well understand that after having\r\ninherited the fortune of my brother it would be very agreeable to you\r\nto be my heir likewise; but know beforehand, if you kill me or cause me\r\nto be killed, my precautions are taken. Not a penny of what I possess\r\nwill pass into your hands. Were you not already rich enough\xe2\x80\x94you who\r\npossess nearly a million? And could you not stop your fatal career, if\r\nyou did not do evil for the infinite and supreme joy of doing it? Oh,\r\nbe assured, if the memory of my brother were not sacred to me, you\r\nshould rot in a state dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at\r\nTyburn. I will be silent, but you must endure your captivity quietly.\r\nIn fifteen or twenty days I shall set out for La Rochelle with the\r\narmy; but on the eve of my departure a vessel which I shall see depart\r\nwill take you hence and convey you to our colonies in the south. And be\r\nassured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains\r\nout at the first attempt you make to return to England or the\r\nContinent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, at present,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Lord de Winter, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will remain in this\r\ncastle. The walls are thick, the doors strong, and the bars solid;\r\nbesides, your window opens immediately over the sea. The men of my\r\ncrew, who are devoted to me for life and death, mount guard around this\r\napartment, and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard. Even\r\nif you gained the yard, there would still be three iron gates for you\r\nto pass. The order is positive. A step, a gesture, a word, on your\r\npart, denoting an effort to escape, and you are to be fired upon. If\r\nthey kill you, English justice will be under an obligation to me for\r\nhaving saved it trouble. Ah! I see your features regain their calmness,\r\nyour countenance recovers its assurance. You are saying to yourself:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fifteen days, twenty days? Bah! I have an inventive mind; before that\r\nis expired some idea will occur to me. I have an infernal spirit. I\r\nshall meet with a victim. Before fifteen days are gone by I shall be\r\naway from here.\xe2\x80\x99 Ah, try it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady, finding her thoughts betrayed, dug her nails into her flesh to\r\nsubdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except\r\nagony.\r\n\r\nLord de Winter continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThe officer who commands here in my absence\r\nyou have already seen, and therefore know him. He knows how, as you\r\nmust have observed, to obey an order\xe2\x80\x94for you did not, I am sure, come\r\nfrom Portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him speak. What do\r\nyou say of him? Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and\r\nmore mute? You have already tried the power of your seductions upon\r\nmany men, and unfortunately you have always succeeded; but I give you\r\nleave to try them upon this one. _Pardieu!_ if you succeed with him, I\r\npronounce you the demon himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went toward the door and opened it hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall Mr. Felton,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute longer, and I will introduce\r\nhim to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere followed between these two personages a strange silence, during\r\nwhich the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching.\r\nShortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor, and the\r\nyoung lieutenant, with whom we are already acquainted, stopped at the\r\nthreshold to receive the orders of the baron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, my dear John,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord de Winter, \xe2\x80\x9ccome in, and shut the\r\ndoor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young officer entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the baron, \xe2\x80\x9clook at this woman. She is young; she is\r\nbeautiful; she possesses all earthly seductions. Well, she is a\r\nmonster, who, at twenty-five years of age, has been guilty of as many\r\ncrimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals.\r\nHer voice prejudices her hearers in her favor; her beauty serves as a\r\nbait to her victims; her body even pays what she promises\xe2\x80\x94I must do her\r\nthat justice. She will try to seduce you, perhaps she will try to kill\r\nyou. I have extricated you from misery, Felton; I have caused you to be\r\nnamed lieutenant; I once saved your life, you know on what occasion. I\r\nam for you not only a protector, but a friend; not only a benefactor,\r\nbut a father. This woman has come back again into England for the\r\npurpose of conspiring against my life. I hold this serpent in my hands.\r\nWell, I call you, and say to you: Friend Felton, John, my child, guard\r\nme, and more particularly guard yourself, against this woman. Swear, by\r\nyour hopes of salvation, to keep her safely for the chastisement she\r\nhas merited. John Felton, I trust your word! John Felton, I put faith\r\nin your loyalty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young officer, summoning to his mild countenance\r\nall the hatred he could find in his heart, \xe2\x80\x9cmy Lord, I swear all shall\r\nbe done as you desire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady received this look like a resigned victim; it was impossible to\r\nimagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which\r\nprevailed on her beautiful countenance. Lord de Winter himself could\r\nscarcely recognize the tigress who, a minute before, prepared\r\napparently for a fight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not to leave this chamber, understand, John,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the\r\nbaron. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is to correspond with nobody; she is to speak to no one but\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94if you will do her the honor to address a word to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is sufficient, my Lord! I have sworn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, madame, try to make your peace with God, for you are judged\r\nby men!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady let her head sink, as if crushed by this sentence. Lord de\r\nWinter went out, making a sign to Felton, who followed him, shutting\r\nthe door after him.\r\n\r\nOne instant after, the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel\r\nwas heard in the corridor\xe2\x80\x94his ax in his girdle and his musket on his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nMilady remained for some minutes in the same position, for she thought\r\nthey might perhaps be examining her through the keyhole; she then\r\nslowly raised her head, which had resumed its formidable expression of\r\nmenace and defiance, ran to the door to listen, looked out of her\r\nwindow, and returning to bury herself again in her large armchair, she\r\nreflected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LI.\r\nOFFICER\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the cardinal looked anxiously for news from England; but no\r\nnews arrived that was not annoying and threatening.\r\n\r\nAlthough La Rochelle was invested, however certain success might\r\nappear\xe2\x80\x94thanks to the precautions taken, and above all to the dyke,\r\nwhich prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged city\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nblockade might last a long time yet. This was a great affront to the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s army, and a great inconvenience to the cardinal, who had no\r\nlonger, it is true, to embroil Louis XIII. with Anne of Austria\xe2\x80\x94for that\r\naffair was over\xe2\x80\x94but he had to adjust matters for M. de Bassompierre,\r\nwho was embroiled with the Duc d\xe2\x80\x99Angoul\xc3\xaame.\r\n\r\nAs to Monsieur, who had begun the siege, he left to the cardinal the\r\ntask of finishing it.\r\n\r\nThe city, notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor, had\r\nattempted a sort of mutiny for a surrender; the mayor had hanged the\r\nmutineers. This execution quieted the ill-disposed, who resolved to\r\nallow themselves to die of hunger\xe2\x80\x94this death always appearing to them\r\nmore slow and less sure than strangulation.\r\n\r\nOn their side, from time to time, the besiegers took the messengers\r\nwhich the Rochellais sent to Buckingham, or the spies which Buckingham\r\nsent to the Rochellais. In one case or the other, the trial was soon\r\nover. The cardinal pronounced the single word, \xe2\x80\x9cHanged!\xe2\x80\x9d The king was\r\ninvited to come and see the hanging. He came languidly, placing himself\r\nin a good situation to see all the details. This amused him sometimes a\r\nlittle, and made him endure the siege with patience; but it did not\r\nprevent his getting very tired, or from talking at every moment of\r\nreturning to Paris\xe2\x80\x94so that if the messengers and the spies had failed,\r\nhis Eminence, notwithstanding all his inventiveness, would have found\r\nhimself much embarrassed.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, time passed on, and the Rochellais did not surrender. The\r\nlast spy that was taken was the bearer of a letter. This letter told\r\nBuckingham that the city was at an extremity; but instead of adding,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your succor does not arrive within fifteen days, we will\r\nsurrender,\xe2\x80\x9d it added, quite simply, \xe2\x80\x9cIf your succor comes not within\r\nfifteen days, we shall all be dead with hunger when it comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Rochellais, then, had no hope but in Buckingham. Buckingham was\r\ntheir Messiah. It was evident that if they one day learned positively\r\nthat they must not count on Buckingham, their courage would fail with\r\ntheir hope.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal looked, then, with great impatience for the news from\r\nEngland which would announce to him that Buckingham would not come.\r\n\r\nThe question of carrying the city by assault, though often debated in\r\nthe council of the king, had been always rejected. In the first place,\r\nLa Rochelle appeared impregnable. Then the cardinal, whatever he said,\r\nvery well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter, in which\r\nFrenchman would combat against Frenchman, was a retrograde movement of\r\nsixty years impressed upon his policy; and the cardinal was at that\r\nperiod what we now call a man of progress. In fact, the sack of La\r\nRochelle, and the assassination of three of four thousand Huguenots who\r\nallowed themselves to be killed, would resemble too closely, in 1628,\r\nthe massacre of St. Bartholomew in 1572; and then, above all this, this\r\nextreme measure, which was not at all repugnant to the king, good\r\nCatholic as he was, always fell before this argument of the besieging\r\ngenerals\xe2\x80\x94La Rochelle is impregnable except to famine.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of\r\nhis terrible emissary\xe2\x80\x94for he comprehended the strange qualities of this\r\nwoman, sometimes a serpent, sometimes a lion. Had she betrayed him? Was\r\nshe dead? He knew her well enough in all cases to know that, whether\r\nacting for or against him, as a friend or an enemy, she would not\r\nremain motionless without great impediments; but whence did these\r\nimpediments arise? That was what he could not know.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he reckoned, and with reason, on Milady. He had divined in the\r\npast of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could\r\ncover; and he felt, from one cause or another, that this woman was his\r\nown, as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior\r\nto the danger which threatened her.\r\n\r\nHe resolved, then, to carry on the war alone, and to look for no\r\nsuccess foreign to himself, but as we look for a fortunate chance. He\r\ncontinued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve\r\nLa Rochelle. Meanwhile, he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city,\r\nwhich contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues, and\r\nrecalling the saying of Louis XI., his political predecessor, as he\r\nhimself was the predecessor of Robespierre, he repeated this maxim of\r\nTristan\xe2\x80\x99s gossip: \xe2\x80\x9cDivide in order to reign.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenry IV., when besieging Paris, had loaves and provisions thrown over\r\nthe walls. The cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he\r\nrepresented to the Rochellais how unjust, selfish, and barbarous was\r\nthe conduct of their leaders. These leaders had corn in abundance, and\r\nwould not let them partake of it; they adopted as a maxim\xe2\x80\x94for they,\r\ntoo, had maxims\xe2\x80\x94that it was of very little consequence that women,\r\nchildren, and old men should die, so long as the men who were to defend\r\nthe walls remained strong and healthy. Up to that time, whether from\r\ndevotedness or from want of power to act against it, this maxim,\r\nwithout being generally adopted, nevertheless passed from theory into\r\npractice; but the notes did it injury. The notes reminded the men that\r\nthe children, women, and old men whom they allowed to die were their\r\nsons, their wives, and their fathers, and that it would be more just\r\nfor everyone to be reduced to the common misery, in order that equal\r\nconditions should give birth to unanimous resolutions.\r\n\r\nThese notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect, in\r\nthat they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private\r\nnegotiations with the royal army.\r\n\r\nBut at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing\r\nfruit, and applauded himself for having put it in action, an inhabitant\r\nof La Rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal lines\xe2\x80\x94God knows how,\r\nsuch was the watchfulness of Bassompierre, Schomberg, and the Duc\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Angoul\xc3\xaame, themselves watched over by the cardinal\xe2\x80\x94an inhabitant of\r\nLa Rochelle, we say, entered the city, coming from Portsmouth, and\r\nsaying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight\r\ndays. Still further, Buckingham announced to the mayor that at length\r\nthe great league was about to declare itself against France, and that\r\nthe kingdom would be at once invaded by the English, Imperial, and\r\nSpanish armies. This letter was read publicly in all parts of the city.\r\nCopies were put up at the corners of the streets; and even they who had\r\nbegun to open negotiations interrupted them, being resolved to await\r\nthe succor so pompously announced.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected circumstance brought back Richelieu\xe2\x80\x99s former anxiety,\r\nand forced him in spite of himself once more to turn his eyes to the\r\nother side of the sea.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief,\r\nthe royal army led a joyous life, neither provisions nor money being\r\nwanting in the camp. All the corps rivaled one another in audacity and\r\ngaiety. To take spies and hang them, to make hazardous expeditions upon\r\nthe dyke or the sea, to imagine wild plans, and to execute them\r\ncoolly\xe2\x80\x94such were the pastimes which made the army find these days short\r\nwhich were not only so long to the Rochellais, a prey to famine and\r\nanxiety, but even to the cardinal, who blockaded them so closely.\r\n\r\nSometimes when the cardinal, always on horseback, like the lowest\r\n_gendarme_ of the army, cast a pensive glance over those works, so\r\nslowly keeping pace with his wishes, which the engineers, brought from\r\nall the corners of France, were executing under his orders, if he met a\r\nMusketeer of the company of Tr\xc3\xa9ville, he drew near and looked at him in\r\na peculiar manner, and not recognizing in him one of our four\r\ncompanions, he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in\r\nanother direction.\r\n\r\nOne day when oppressed with a mortal weariness of mind, without hope in\r\nthe negotiations with the city, without news from England, the cardinal\r\nwent out, without any other aim than to be out of doors, and\r\naccompanied only by Cahusac and La Houdini\xc3\xa8re, strolled along the\r\nbeach. Mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the\r\nocean, he came, his horse going at a foot\xe2\x80\x99s pace, to a hill from the\r\ntop of which he perceived behind a hedge, reclining on the sand and\r\ncatching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this\r\nperiod of the year, seven men surrounded by empty bottles. Four of\r\nthese men were our Musketeers, preparing to listen to a letter one of\r\nthem had just received. This letter was so important that it made them\r\nforsake their cards and their dice on the drumhead.\r\n\r\nThe other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of\r\nCollicure wine; these were the lackeys of these gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal was, as we have said, in very low spirits; and nothing\r\nwhen he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as\r\ngaiety in others. Besides, he had another strange fancy, which was\r\nalways to believe that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of\r\nothers. Making a sign to La Houdini\xc3\xa8re and Cahusac to stop, he alighted\r\nfrom his horse, and went toward these suspected merry companions,\r\nhoping, by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and\r\nof the hedge which concealed his approach, to catch some words of this\r\nconversation which appeared so interesting. At ten paces from the hedge\r\nhe recognized the talkative Gascon; and as he had already perceived\r\nthat these men were Musketeers, he did not doubt that the three others\r\nwere those called the Inseparables; that is to say, Athos, Porthos, and\r\nAramis.\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was\r\naugmented by this discovery. His eyes took a strange expression, and\r\nwith the step of a tiger-cat he advanced toward the hedge; but he had\r\nnot been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any\r\npositive sense, when a sonorous and short cry made him start, and\r\nattracted the attention of the Musketeers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOfficer!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Grimaud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are speaking, you scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, rising upon his elbow,\r\nand transfixing Grimaud with his flaming look.\r\n\r\nGrimaud therefore added nothing to his speech, but contented himself\r\nwith pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge,\r\nannouncing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort.\r\n\r\nWith a single bound the Musketeers were on their feet, and saluted with\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal seemed furious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears that Messieurs the Musketeers keep guard,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\nthe English expected by land, or do the Musketeers consider themselves\r\nsuperior officers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos, for amid the general fright he alone had\r\npreserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur, the Musketeers, when they are not on duty, or when their\r\nduty is over, drink and play at dice, and they are certainly superior\r\nofficers to their lackeys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLackeys?\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled the cardinal. \xe2\x80\x9cLackeys who have the order to warn\r\ntheir masters when anyone passes are not lackeys, they are sentinels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution,\r\nwe should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting\r\nyou our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done\r\nus in uniting us. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cyou, who but lately\r\nwere so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude\r\nto Monseigneur, here it is; avail yourself of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which\r\ndistinguished Athos in the hour of danger, and with that excessive\r\npoliteness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic\r\nthan kings by birth.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude\r\nwhich soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not signify, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the cardinal, without\r\nappearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the\r\ndiversion which Athos had started, \xe2\x80\x9cit does not signify, gentlemen. I\r\ndo not like to have simple soldiers, because they have the advantage of\r\nserving in a privileged corps, thus to play the great lords; discipline\r\nis the same for them as for everybody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely, and bowed\r\nin sign of assent. Then he resumed in his turn: \xe2\x80\x9cDiscipline,\r\nMonseigneur, has, I hope, in no way been forgotten by us. We are not on\r\nduty, and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to\r\ndispose of our time as we pleased. If we are so fortunate as to have\r\nsome particular duty to perform for your Eminence, we are ready to obey\r\nyou. Your Eminence may perceive,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Athos, knitting his brow,\r\nfor this sort of investigation began to annoy him, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we have not\r\ncome out without our arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he showed the cardinal, with his finger, the four muskets piled\r\nnear the drum, on which were the cards and dice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Eminence may believe,\xe2\x80\x9d added D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we would have come\r\nto meet you, if we could have supposed it was Monseigneur coming toward\r\nus with so few attendants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cardinal bit his mustache, and even his lips a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what you look like, all together, as you are armed and\r\nguarded by your lackeys?\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look like four\r\nconspirators.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, as to that, Monseigneur, it is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cwe do conspire,\r\nas your Eminence might have seen the other morning. Only we conspire\r\nagainst the Rochellais.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you gentlemen of policy!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cardinal, knitting his brow\r\nin his turn, \xe2\x80\x9cthe secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found\r\nin your brains, if we could read them as you read that letter which you\r\nconcealed as soon as you saw me coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe color mounted to the face of Athos, and he made a step toward his\r\nEminence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne might think you really suspected us, monseigneur, and we were\r\nundergoing a real interrogatory. If it be so, we trust your Eminence\r\nwill deign to explain yourself, and we should then at least be\r\nacquainted with our real position.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if it were an interrogatory!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cardinal. \xe2\x80\x9cOthers\r\nbesides you have undergone such, Monsieur Athos, and have replied\r\nthereto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus I have told your Eminence that you had but to question us, and we\r\nare ready to reply.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that letter you were about to read, Monsieur Aramis, and\r\nwhich you so promptly concealed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman\xe2\x80\x99s letter, monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must be discreet with this\r\nsort of letters; but nevertheless, we may show them to a confessor, and\r\nyou know I have taken orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, with a calmness the more terrible because he\r\nrisked his head in making this reply, \xe2\x80\x9cthe letter is a woman\xe2\x80\x99s letter,\r\nbut it is neither signed Marion de Lorme, nor Madame d\xe2\x80\x99Aiguillon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cardinal became as pale as death; lightning darted from his eyes.\r\nHe turned round as if to give an order to Cahusac and Houdini\xc3\xa8re. Athos\r\nsaw the movement; he made a step toward the muskets, upon which the\r\nother three friends had fixed their eyes, like men ill-disposed to\r\nallow themselves to be taken. The cardinalists were three; the\r\nMusketeers, lackeys included, were seven. He judged that the match\r\nwould be so much the less equal, if Athos and his companions were\r\nreally plotting; and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at\r\ncommand, all his anger faded away into a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are brave young men, proud in daylight,\r\nfaithful in darkness. We can find no fault with you for watching over\r\nyourselves, when you watch so carefully over others. Gentlemen, I have\r\nnot forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the Red\r\nDovecot. If there were any danger to be apprehended on the road I am\r\ngoing, I would request you to accompany me; but as there is none,\r\nremain where you are, finish your bottles, your game, and your letter.\r\nAdieu, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd remounting his horse, which Cahusac led to him, he saluted them\r\nwith his hand, and rode away.\r\n\r\nThe four young men, standing and motionless, followed him with their\r\neyes without speaking a single word until he had disappeared. Then they\r\nlooked at one another.\r\n\r\nThe countenances of all gave evidence of terror, for notwithstanding\r\nthe friendly adieu of his Eminence, they plainly perceived that the\r\ncardinal went away with rage in his heart.\r\n\r\nAthos alone smiled, with a self-possessed, disdainful smile.\r\n\r\nWhen the cardinal was out of hearing and sight, \xe2\x80\x9cThat Grimaud kept bad\r\nwatch!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos, who had a great inclination to vent his\r\nill-humor on somebody.\r\n\r\nGrimaud was about to reply to excuse himself. Athos lifted his finger,\r\nand Grimaud was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you have given up the letter, Aramis?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, in his most flutelike tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI had made up my mind.\r\nIf he had insisted upon the letter being given up to him, I would have\r\npresented the letter to him with one hand, and with the other I would\r\nhave run my sword through his body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expected as much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cand that was why I threw myself\r\nbetween you and him. Indeed, this man is very much to blame for talking\r\nthus to other men; one would say he had never had to do with any but\r\nwomen and children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Athos, I admire you, but nevertheless we were in the wrong,\r\nafter all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, in the wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cWhose, then, is the air we breathe?\r\nWhose is the ocean upon which we look? Whose is the sand upon which we\r\nwere reclining? Whose is that letter of your mistress? Do these belong\r\nto the cardinal? Upon my honor, this man fancies the world belongs to\r\nhim. There you stood, stammering, stupefied, annihilated. One might\r\nhave supposed the Bastille appeared before you, and that the gigantic\r\nMedusa had converted you into stone. Is being in love conspiring? You\r\nare in love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up,\r\nand you wish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal. That\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmatch you are playing with his Eminence; this letter is your game. Why\r\nshould you expose your game to your adversary? That is never done. Let\r\nhim find it out if he can! We can find out his!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s all very sensible, Athos,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, let there be no more question of what\xe2\x80\x99s past, and let\r\nAramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAramis drew the letter from his pocket; the three friends surrounded\r\nhim, and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine jar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had only read a line or two,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cread the letter\r\nagain from the commencement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillingly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR COUSIN, I think I shall make up my mind to set out for\r\nB\xc3\xa9thune, where my sister has placed our little servant in the convent\r\nof the Carmelites; this poor child is quite resigned, as she knows she\r\ncannot live elsewhere without the salvation of her soul being in\r\ndanger. Nevertheless, if the affairs of our family are arranged, as we\r\nhope they will be, I believe she will run the risk of being damned, and\r\nwill return to those she regrets, particularly as she knows they are\r\nalways thinking of her. Meanwhile, she is not very wretched; what she\r\nmost desires is a letter from her intended. I know that such viands\r\npass with difficulty through convent gratings; but after all, as I have\r\ngiven you proofs, my dear cousin, I am not unskilled in such affairs,\r\nand I will take charge of the commission. My sister thanks you for your\r\ngood and eternal remembrance. She has experienced much anxiety; but she\r\nis now at length a little reassured, having sent her secretary away in\r\norder that nothing may happen unexpectedly.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAdieu, my dear cousin. Tell us news of yourself as often as you\r\n    can; that is to say, as often as you can with safety. I embrace\r\n    you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMARIE MICHON\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what do I not owe you, Aramis?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Constance!\r\nI have at length, then, intelligence of you. She lives; she is in\r\nsafety in a convent; she is at B\xc3\xa9thune! Where is B\xc3\xa9thune, Athos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, upon the frontiers of Artois and of Flanders. The siege once\r\nover, we shall be able to make a tour in that direction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that will not be long, it is to be hoped,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cfor they\r\nhave this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the Rochellais were\r\nreduced to the leather of their shoes. Supposing that after having\r\neaten the leather they eat the soles, I cannot see much that is left\r\nunless they eat one another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fools!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, emptying a glass of excellent Bordeaux wine\r\nwhich, without having at that period the reputation it now enjoys,\r\nmerited it no less, \xe2\x80\x9cpoor fools! As if the Catholic religion was not\r\nthe most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions! All the\r\nsame,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed he, after having clicked his tongue against his palate,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey are brave fellows! But what the devil are you about, Aramis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you are squeezing that letter into your pocket!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cAthos is right, it must be burned. And yet if\r\nwe burn it, who knows whether Monsieur Cardinal has not a secret to\r\ninterrogate ashes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do with the letter, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, Grimaud,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. Grimaud rose and obeyed. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a\r\npunishment for having spoken without permission, my friend, you will\r\nplease to eat this piece of paper; then to recompense you for the\r\nservice you will have rendered us, you shall afterward drink this glass\r\nof wine. First, here is the letter. Eat heartily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrimaud smiled; and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which Athos held\r\nin his hand, he ground the paper well between his teeth and then\r\nswallowed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo, Monsieur Grimaud!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cand now take this. That\xe2\x80\x99s well.\r\nWe dispense with your saying grace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrimaud silently swallowed the glass of Bordeaux wine; but his eyes,\r\nraised toward heaven during this delicious occupation, spoke a language\r\nwhich, though mute, was not the less expressive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cunless Monsieur Cardinal should form the\r\ningenious idea of ripping up Grimaud, I think we may be pretty much at\r\nour ease respecting the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeantime, his Eminence continued his melancholy ride, murmuring between\r\nhis mustaches, \xe2\x80\x9cThese four men must positively be mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LII.\r\nCAPTIVITY: THE FIRST DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us return to Milady, whom a glance thrown upon the coast of France\r\nhas made us lose sight of for an instant.\r\n\r\nWe shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left\r\nher, plunged in an abyss of dismal reflection\xe2\x80\x94a dark hell at the gate\r\nof which she has almost left hope behind, because for the first time\r\nshe doubts, for the first time she fears.\r\n\r\nOn two occasions her fortune has failed her, on two occasions she has\r\nfound herself discovered and betrayed; and on these two occasions it\r\nwas to one fatal genius, sent doubtlessly by the Lord to combat her,\r\nthat she has succumbed. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan has conquered her\xe2\x80\x94her, that\r\ninvincible power of evil.\r\n\r\nHe has deceived her in her love, humbled her in her pride, thwarted her\r\nin her ambition; and now he ruins her fortune, deprives her of liberty,\r\nand even threatens her life. Still more, he has lifted the corner of\r\nher mask\xe2\x80\x94that shield with which she covered herself and which rendered\r\nher so strong.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan has turned aside from Buckingham, whom she hates as she\r\nhates everyone she has loved, the tempest with which Richelieu\r\nthreatened him in the person of the queen. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had passed\r\nhimself upon her as De Wardes, for whom she had conceived one of those\r\ntigerlike fancies common to women of her character. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan knows\r\nthat terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without\r\ndying. In short, at the moment in which she has just obtained from\r\nRichelieu a _carte blanche_ by the means of which she is about to take\r\nvengeance on her enemy, this precious paper is torn from her hands, and\r\nit is D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan who holds her prisoner and is about to send her to\r\nsome filthy Botany Bay, some infamous Tyburn of the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nAll this she owes to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, without doubt. From whom can come so\r\nmany disgraces heaped upon her head, if not from him? He alone could\r\nhave transmitted to Lord de Winter all these frightful secrets which he\r\nhas discovered, one after another, by a train of fatalities. He knows\r\nher brother-in-law. He must have written to him.\r\n\r\nWhat hatred she distills! Motionless, with her burning and fixed\r\nglances, in her solitary apartment, how well the outbursts of passion\r\nwhich at times escape from the depths of her chest with her\r\nrespiration, accompany the sound of the surf which rises, growls,\r\nroars, and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against\r\nthe rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle! How many\r\nmagnificent projects of vengeance she conceives by the light of the\r\nflashes which her tempestuous passion casts over her mind against Mme.\r\nBonacieux, against Buckingham, but above all against\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\xe2\x80\x94projects lost in the distance of the future.\r\n\r\nYes; but in order to avenge herself she must be free. And to be free, a\r\nprisoner has to pierce a wall, detach bars, cut through a floor\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nundertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish, but before\r\nwhich the feverish irritations of a woman must give way. Besides, to do\r\nall this, time is necessary\xe2\x80\x94months, years; and she has ten or twelve\r\ndays, as Lord de Winter, her fraternal and terrible jailer, has told\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, if she were a man she would attempt all this, and perhaps\r\nmight succeed; why, then, did heaven make the mistake of placing that\r\nmanlike soul in that frail and delicate body?\r\n\r\nThe first moments of her captivity were terrible; a few convulsions of\r\nrage which she could not suppress paid her debt of feminine weakness to\r\nnature. But by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion;\r\nand nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared, and she\r\nremained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to, go to! I must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away\r\nso,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, gazing into the glass, which reflects back to her eyes\r\nthe burning glance by which she appears to interrogate herself. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\r\nviolence; violence is the proof of weakness. In the first place, I have\r\nnever succeeded by that means. Perhaps if I employed my strength\r\nagainst women I might perchance find them weaker than myself, and\r\nconsequently conquer them; but it is with men that I struggle, and I am\r\nbut a woman to them. Let me fight like a woman, then; my strength is in\r\nmy weakness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could\r\nplace upon her countenance, so mobile and so expressive, she made it\r\ntake all expressions from that of passionate anger, which convulsed her\r\nfeatures, to that of the most sweet, most affectionate, and most\r\nseducing smile. Then her hair assumed successively, under her skillful\r\nhands, all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her\r\nface. At length she murmured, satisfied with herself, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, nothing is\r\nlost; I am still beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was then nearly eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening. Milady perceived a\r\nbed; she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only\r\nrefresh her head and her ideas, but still further, her complexion. A\r\nbetter idea, however, came into her mind before going to bed. She had\r\nheard something said about supper. She had already been an hour in this\r\napartment; they could not long delay bringing her a repast. The\r\nprisoner did not wish to lose time; and she resolved to make that very\r\nevening some attempts to ascertain the nature of the ground she had to\r\nwork upon, by studying the characters of the men to whose guardianship\r\nshe was committed.\r\n\r\nA light appeared under the door; this light announced the reappearance\r\nof her jailers. Milady, who had arisen, threw herself quickly into the\r\narmchair, her head thrown back, her beautiful hair unbound and\r\ndisheveled, her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace, one hand on\r\nher heart, and the other hanging down.\r\n\r\nThe bolts were drawn; the door groaned upon its hinges. Steps sounded\r\nin the chamber, and drew near.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlace that table there,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice which the prisoner recognized as\r\nthat of Felton.\r\n\r\nThe order was executed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will bring lights, and relieve the sentinel,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Felton.\r\n\r\nAnd this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same\r\nindividuals proved to Milady that her servants were the same men as her\r\nguards; that is to say, soldiers.\r\n\r\nFelton\xe2\x80\x99s orders were, for the rest, executed with a silent rapidity\r\nthat gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained discipline.\r\n\r\nAt length Felton, who had not yet looked at Milady, turned toward her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is asleep; that\xe2\x80\x99s well. When she wakes she can\r\nsup.\xe2\x80\x9d And he made some steps toward the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said a soldier, less stoical than his chief, and\r\nwho had approached Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cthis woman is not asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, not asleep!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is she doing, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has fainted. Her face is very pale, and I have listened in vain; I\r\ndo not hear her breathe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, after having looked at Milady from the\r\nspot on which he stood without moving a step toward her. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and tell\r\nLord de Winter that his prisoner has fainted\xe2\x80\x94for this event not having\r\nbeen foreseen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soldier went out to obey the orders of his officer. Felton sat down\r\nupon an armchair which happened to be near the door, and waited without\r\nspeaking a word, without making a gesture. Milady possessed that great\r\nart, so much studied by women, of looking through her long eyelashes\r\nwithout appearing to open the lids. She perceived Felton, who sat with\r\nhis back toward her. She continued to look at him for nearly ten\r\nminutes, and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned\r\nround once.\r\n\r\nShe then thought that Lord de Winter would come, and by his presence\r\ngive fresh strength to her jailer. Her first trial was lost; she acted\r\nlike a woman who reckons up her resources. As a result she raised her\r\nhead, opened her eyes, and sighed deeply.\r\n\r\nAt this sigh Felton turned round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are awake, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthen I have nothing more to do\r\nhere. If you want anything you can ring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, my God! how I have suffered!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, in that\r\nharmonious voice which, like that of the ancient enchantresses, charmed\r\nall whom she wished to destroy.\r\n\r\nAnd she assumed, upon sitting up in the armchair, a still more graceful\r\nand abandoned position than when she reclined.\r\n\r\nFelton arose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be served, thus, madame, three times a day,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the\r\nmorning at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, in the day at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and in the evening\r\nat eight. If that does not suit you, you can point out what other hours\r\nyou prefer, and in this respect your wishes will be complied with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut am I to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for, who will be tomorrow\r\nat the castle, and will return as often as you desire her presence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the prisoner, humbly.\r\n\r\nFelton made a slight bow, and directed his steps toward the door. At\r\nthe moment he was about to go out, Lord de Winter appeared in the\r\ncorridor, followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of\r\nthe swoon of Milady. He held a vial of salts in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it\xe2\x80\x94what is going on here?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in a jeering voice,\r\non seeing the prisoner sitting up and Felton about to go out. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this\r\ncorpse come to life already? Felton, my lad, did you not perceive that\r\nyou were taken for a novice, and that the first act was being performed\r\nof a comedy of which we shall doubtless have the pleasure of following\r\nout all the developments?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton; \xe2\x80\x9cbut as the prisoner is a woman,\r\nafter all, I wish to pay her the attention that every man of gentle\r\nbirth owes to a woman, if not on her account, at least on my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady shuddered through her whole system. These words of Felton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npassed like ice through her veins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied de Winter, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cthat beautiful hair so skillfully\r\ndisheveled, that white skin, and that languishing look, have not yet\r\nseduced you, you heart of stone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the impassive young man; \xe2\x80\x9cyour Lordship may be\r\nassured that it requires more than the tricks and coquetry of a woman\r\nto corrupt me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, my brave lieutenant, let us leave Milady to find out\r\nsomething else, and go to supper; but be easy! She has a fruitful\r\nimagination, and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps\r\nafter the first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd at these words Lord de Winter passed his arm through that of\r\nFelton, and led him out, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I will be a match for you!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Milady, between her teeth;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbe assured of that, you poor spoiled monk, you poor converted soldier,\r\nwho has cut his uniform out of a monk\xe2\x80\x99s frock!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed de Winter, stopping at the threshold of the door,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou must not, Milady, let this check take away your appetite. Taste\r\nthat fowl and those fish. On my honor, they are not poisoned. I have a\r\nvery good cook, and he is not to be my heir; I have full and perfect\r\nconfidence in him. Do as I do. Adieu, dear sister, till your next\r\nswoon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was all that Milady could endure. Her hands clutched her armchair;\r\nshe ground her teeth inwardly; her eyes followed the motion of the door\r\nas it closed behind Lord de Winter and Felton, and the moment she was\r\nalone a fresh fit of despair seized her. She cast her eyes upon the\r\ntable, saw the glittering of a knife, rushed toward it and clutched it;\r\nbut her disappointment was cruel. The blade was round, and of flexible\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nA burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the ill-closed\r\ndoor, and the door reopened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lord de Winter; \xe2\x80\x9cha, ha! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, my brave\r\nFelton; don\xe2\x80\x99t you see what I told you? That knife was for you, my lad;\r\nshe would have killed you. Observe, this is one of her peculiarities,\r\nto get rid thus, after one fashion or another, of all the people who\r\nbother her. If I had listened to you, the knife would have been pointed\r\nand of steel. Then no more of Felton; she would have cut your throat,\r\nand after that everybody else\xe2\x80\x99s. See, John, see how well she knows how\r\nto handle a knife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, Milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand;\r\nbut these last words, this supreme insult, relaxed her hands, her\r\nstrength, and even her will. The knife fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were right, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, with a tone of profound disgust\r\nwhich sounded to the very bottom of the heart of Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were\r\nright, my Lord, and I was wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd both again left the room.\r\n\r\nBut this time Milady lent a more attentive ear than the first, and she\r\nheard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am lost,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she; \xe2\x80\x9cI am lost! I am in the power of men upon\r\nwhom I can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or\r\ngranite; they know me by heart, and are steeled against all my weapons.\r\nIt is, however, impossible that this should end as they have decreed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, as this last reflection indicated\xe2\x80\x94this instinctive return to\r\nhope\xe2\x80\x94sentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent\r\nspirit. Milady sat down to table, ate from several dishes, drank a\r\nlittle Spanish wine, and felt all her resolution return.\r\n\r\nBefore she went to bed she had pondered, analyzed, turned on all sides,\r\nexamined on all points, the words, the steps, the gestures, the signs,\r\nand even the silence of her interlocutors; and of this profound,\r\nskillful, and anxious study the result was that Felton, everything\r\nconsidered, appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors.\r\n\r\nOne expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\nhad listened to you,\xe2\x80\x9d Lord de Winter had said to Felton.\r\n\r\nFelton, then, had spoken in her favor, since Lord de Winter had not\r\nbeen willing to listen to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeak or strong,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cthat man has, then, a spark of pity\r\nin his soul; of that spark I will make a flame that shall devour him.\r\nAs to the other, he knows me, he fears me, and knows what he has to\r\nexpect of me if ever I escape from his hands. It is useless, then, to\r\nattempt anything with him. But Felton\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s another thing. He is a\r\nyoung, ingenuous, pure man who seems virtuous; him there are means of\r\ndestroying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips.\r\nAnyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl\r\ndreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the\r\nnext festival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIII.\r\nCAPTIVITY: THE SECOND DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nMilady dreamed that she at length had D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan in her power, that she\r\nwas present at his execution; and it was the sight of his odious blood,\r\nflowing beneath the ax of the headsman, which spread that charming\r\nsmile upon her lips.\r\n\r\nShe slept as a prisoner sleeps, rocked by his first hope.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when they entered her chamber she was still in bed.\r\nFelton remained in the corridor. He brought with him the woman of whom\r\nhe had spoken the evening before, and who had just arrived; this woman\r\nentered, and approaching Milady\xe2\x80\x99s bed, offered her services.\r\n\r\nMilady was habitually pale; her complexion might therefore deceive a\r\nperson who saw her for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in a fever,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cI have not slept a single instant during\r\nall this long night. I suffer horribly. Are you likely to be more\r\nhumane to me than others were yesterday? All I ask is permission to\r\nremain abed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to have a physician called?\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman.\r\n\r\nFelton listened to this dialogue without speaking a word.\r\n\r\nMilady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she\r\nwould have to work upon, and Lord de Winter would redouble his watch.\r\nBesides, the physician might declare the ailment feigned; and Milady,\r\nafter having lost the first trick, was not willing to lose the second.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and fetch a physician?\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat could be the good of that?\r\nThese gentlemen declared yesterday that my illness was a comedy; it\r\nwould be just the same today, no doubt\xe2\x80\x94for since yesterday evening they\r\nhave had plenty of time to send for a doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, who became impatient, \xe2\x80\x9csay yourself, madame, what\r\ntreatment you wish followed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, how can I tell? My God! I know that I suffer, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Give me\r\nanything you like, it is of little consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and fetch Lord de Winter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, tired of these eternal\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cno, sir, do not call him, I conjure you. I\r\nam well, I want nothing; do not call him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave so much vehemence, such magnetic eloquence to this\r\nexclamation, that Felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has come!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile, madame, if you really suffer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, \xe2\x80\x9ca physician\r\nshall be sent for; and if you deceive us\xe2\x80\x94well, it will be the worse for\r\nyou. But at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with\r\nanything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady made no reply, but turning her beautiful head round upon her\r\npillow, she burst into tears, and uttered heartbreaking sobs.\r\n\r\nFelton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness; then,\r\nseeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged, he went out. The\r\nwoman followed him, and Lord de Winter did not appear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy I begin to see my way,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Milady, with a savage joy,\r\nburying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be\r\nwatching her this burst of inward satisfaction.\r\n\r\nTwo hours passed away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow it is time that the malady should be over,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9clet me\r\nrise, and obtain some success this very day. I have but ten days, and\r\nthis evening two of them will be gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when they entered Milady\xe2\x80\x99s chamber they had brought her\r\nbreakfast. Now, she thought, they could not long delay coming to clear\r\nthe table, and that Felton would then reappear.\r\n\r\nMilady was not deceived. Felton reappeared, and without observing\r\nwhether Milady had or had not touched her repast, made a sign that the\r\ntable should be carried out of the room, it having been brought in\r\nready spread.\r\n\r\nFelton remained behind; he held a book in his hand.\r\n\r\nMilady, reclining in an armchair near the chimney, beautiful, pale, and\r\nresigned, looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyrdom.\r\n\r\nFelton approached her, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cLord de Winter, who is a Catholic,\r\nlike yourself, madame, thinking that the deprivation of the rites and\r\nceremonies of your church might be painful to you, has consented that\r\nyou should read every day the ordinary of your Mass; and here is a book\r\nwhich contains the ritual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the manner in which Felton laid the book upon the little table near\r\nwhich Milady was sitting, at the tone in which he pronounced the two\r\nwords, _your Mass_, at the disdainful smile with which he accompanied\r\nthem, Milady raised her head, and looked more attentively at the\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nBy that plain arrangement of the hair, by that costume of extreme\r\nsimplicity, by the brow polished like marble and as hard and\r\nimpenetrable, she recognized one of those gloomy Puritans she had so\r\noften met, not only in the court of King James, but in that of the King\r\nof France, where, in spite of the remembrance of the St. Bartholomew,\r\nthey sometimes came to seek refuge.\r\n\r\nShe then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of\r\ngenius receive in great crises, in supreme moments which are to decide\r\ntheir fortunes or their lives.\r\n\r\nThose two words, _your Mass_, and a simple glance cast upon Felton,\r\nrevealed to her all the importance of the reply she was about to make;\r\nbut with that rapidity of intelligence which was peculiar to her, this\r\nreply, ready arranged, presented itself to her lips:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she\r\nhad remarked in the voice of the young officer, \xe2\x80\x9cI, sir? _My Mass?_\r\nLord de Winter, the corrupted Catholic, knows very well that I am not\r\nof his religion, and this is a snare he wishes to lay for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd of what religion are you, then, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Felton, with an\r\nastonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could\r\nnot entirely conceal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, with a feigned exultation, \xe2\x80\x9con the day\r\nwhen I shall have suffered sufficiently for my faith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe look of Felton revealed to Milady the full extent of the space she\r\nhad opened for herself by this single word.\r\n\r\nThe young officer, however, remained mute and motionless; his look\r\nalone had spoken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in the hands of my enemies,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she, with that tone of\r\nenthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the Puritans. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, let my\r\nGod save me, or let me perish for my God! That is the reply I beg you\r\nto make to Lord de Winter. And as to this book,\xe2\x80\x9d added she, pointing to\r\nthe manual with her finger but without touching it, as if she must be\r\ncontaminated by it, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may carry it back and make use of it yourself,\r\nfor doubtless you are doubly the accomplice of Lord de Winter\xe2\x80\x94the\r\naccomplice in his persecutions, the accomplice in his heresies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton made no reply, took the book with the same appearance of\r\nrepugnance which he had before manifested, and retired pensively.\r\n\r\nLord de Winter came toward five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening. Milady had had\r\ntime, during the whole day, to trace her plan of conduct. She received\r\nhim like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears,\xe2\x80\x9d said the baron, seating himself in the armchair opposite\r\nthat occupied by Milady, and stretching out his legs carelessly upon\r\nthe hearth, \xe2\x80\x9cit appears we have made a little apostasy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to say that since we last met you have changed your religion.\r\nYou have not by chance married a Protestant for a third husband, have\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain yourself, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the prisoner, with majesty; \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nthough I hear your words, I declare I do not understand them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you have no religion at all; I like that best,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lord de\r\nWinter, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly that is most in accord with your own principles,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nMilady, frigidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I confess it is all the same to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you need not avow this religious indifference, my Lord; your\r\ndebaucheries and crimes would vouch for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you talk of debaucheries, Madame Messalina, Lady Macbeth! Either\r\nI misunderstand you or you are very shameless!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou only speak thus because you are overheard,\xe2\x80\x9d coolly replied Milady;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand you wish to interest your jailers and your hangmen against me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy jailers and my hangmen! Heyday, madame! you are taking a poetical\r\ntone, and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this evening. As\r\nto the rest, in eight days you will be where you ought to be, and my\r\ntask will be completed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInfamous task! impious task!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, with the exultation of a\r\nvictim who provokes his judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy word,\xe2\x80\x9d said de Winter, rising, \xe2\x80\x9cI think the hussy is going mad!\r\nCome, come, calm yourself, Madame Puritan, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll remove you to a\r\ndungeon. It\xe2\x80\x99s my Spanish wine that has got into your head, is it not?\r\nBut never mind; that sort of intoxication is not dangerous, and will\r\nhave no bad effects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Lord de Winter retired swearing, which at that period was a very\r\nknightly habit.\r\n\r\nFelton was indeed behind the door, and had not lost one word of this\r\nscene. Milady had guessed aright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, go, go!\xe2\x80\x9d said she to her brother; \xe2\x80\x9cthe effects _are_ drawing\r\nnear, on the contrary; but you, weak fool, will not see them until it\r\nis too late to shun them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilence was re-established. Two hours passed away. Milady\xe2\x80\x99s supper was\r\nbrought in, and she was found deeply engaged in saying her prayers\r\naloud\xe2\x80\x94prayers which she had learned of an old servant of her second\r\nhusband, a most austere Puritan. She appeared to be in ecstasy, and did\r\nnot pay the least attention to what was going on around her. Felton\r\nmade a sign that she should not be disturbed; and when all was\r\narranged, he went out quietly with the soldiers.\r\n\r\nMilady knew she might be watched, so she continued her prayers to the\r\nend; and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her\r\ndoor did not march with the same step, and seemed to listen. For the\r\nmoment she wished nothing better. She arose, came to the table, ate but\r\nlittle, and drank only water.\r\n\r\nAn hour after, her table was cleared; but Milady remarked that this\r\ntime Felton did not accompany the soldiers. He feared, then, to see her\r\ntoo often.\r\n\r\nShe turned toward the wall to smile\xe2\x80\x94for there was in this smile such an\r\nexpression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed her.\r\n\r\nShe allowed, therefore, half an hour to pass away; and as at that\r\nmoment all was silence in the old castle, as nothing was heard but the\r\neternal murmur of the waves\xe2\x80\x94that immense breaking of the ocean\xe2\x80\x94with her\r\npure, harmonious, and powerful voice, she began the first couplet of\r\nthe psalm then in great favor with the Puritans:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou leavest thy servants, Lord,\r\n    To see if they be strong;\r\nBut soon thou dost afford\r\n    Thy hand to lead them on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThese verses were not excellent\xe2\x80\x94very far from it; but as it is well\r\nknown, the Puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry.\r\n\r\nWhile singing, Milady listened. The soldier on guard at her door\r\nstopped, as if he had been changed into stone. Milady was then able to\r\njudge of the effect she had produced.\r\n\r\nThen she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling.\r\nIt appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the\r\nvaulted roofs, and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts\r\nof her jailers. It however likewise appeared that the soldier on duty\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nzealous Catholic, no doubt\xe2\x80\x94shook off the charm, for through the door he\r\ncalled: \xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, madame! Your song is as dismal as a \xe2\x80\x98De\r\nprofundis\xe2\x80\x99; and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here, we\r\nmust hear such things as these, no mortal can hold out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d then exclaimed another stern voice which Milady recognized\r\nas that of Felton. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you meddling with, stupid? Did anybody\r\norder you to prevent that woman from singing? No. You were told to\r\nguard her\xe2\x80\x94to fire at her if she attempted to fly. Guard her! If she\r\nflies, kill her; but don\xe2\x80\x99t exceed your orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of Milady;\r\nbut this expression was fleeting as the reflection of lightning.\r\nWithout appearing to have heard the dialogue, of which she had not lost\r\na word, she began again, giving to her voice all the charm, all the\r\npower, all the seduction the demon had bestowed upon it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all my tears, my cares,\r\n    My exile, and my chains,\r\nI have my youth, my prayers,\r\n    And God, who counts my pains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHer voice, of immense power and sublime expression, gave to the rude,\r\nunpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most\r\nexalted Puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren, and which\r\nthey were forced to ornament with all the resources of their\r\nimagination. Felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who\r\nconsoled the three Hebrews in the furnace.\r\n\r\nMilady continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day our doors will ope,\r\n    With God come our desire;\r\nAnd if betrays that hope,\r\n    To death we can aspire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThis verse, into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul,\r\ncompleted the trouble which had seized the heart of the young officer.\r\nHe opened the door quickly; and Milady saw him appear, pale as usual,\r\nbut with his eye inflamed and almost wild.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you sing thus, and with such a voice?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour pardon, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, with mildness. \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot that my songs\r\nare out of place in this castle. I have perhaps offended you in your\r\ncreed; but it was without wishing to do so, I swear. Pardon me, then, a\r\nfault which is perhaps great, but which certainly was involuntary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady was so beautiful at this moment, the religious ecstasy in which\r\nshe appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance,\r\nthat Felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he\r\nhad only just before heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cyou disturb, you agitate the people who live in\r\nthe castle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor, senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his\r\nwords, while Milady was reading with her lynx\xe2\x80\x99s eyes the very depths of\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be silent, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, casting down her eyes with all\r\nthe sweetness she could give to her voice, with all the resignation she\r\ncould impress upon her manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, \xe2\x80\x9conly do not sing so loud, particularly\r\nat night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd at these words Felton, feeling that he could not long maintain his\r\nseverity toward his prisoner, rushed out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have done right, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said the soldier. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch songs\r\ndisturb the mind; and yet we become accustomed to them, her voice is so\r\nbeautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIV.\r\nCAPTIVITY: THE THIRD DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nFelton had fallen; but there was still another step to be taken. He\r\nmust be retained, or rather he must be left quite alone; and Milady but\r\nobscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result.\r\n\r\nStill more must be done. He must be made to speak, in order that he\r\nmight be spoken to\xe2\x80\x94for Milady very well knew that her greatest\r\nseduction was in her voice, which so skillfully ran over the whole\r\ngamut of tones from human speech to language celestial.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of all this seduction Milady might fail\xe2\x80\x94for Felton was\r\nforewarned, and that against the least chance. From that moment she\r\nwatched all his actions, all his words, from the simplest glance of his\r\neyes to his gestures\xe2\x80\x94even to a breath that could be interpreted as a\r\nsigh. In short, she studied everything, as a skillful comedian does to\r\nwhom a new part has been assigned in a line to which he is not\r\naccustomed.\r\n\r\nFace to face with Lord de Winter her plan of conduct was more easy. She\r\nhad laid that down the preceding evening. To remain silent and\r\ndignified in his presence; from time to time to irritate him by\r\naffected disdain, by a contemptuous word; to provoke him to threats and\r\nviolence which would produce a contrast with her own resignation\xe2\x80\x94such\r\nwas her plan. Felton would see all; perhaps he would say nothing, but\r\nhe would see.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, Felton came as usual; but Milady allowed him to preside\r\nover all the preparations for breakfast without addressing a word to\r\nhim. At the moment when he was about to retire, she was cheered with a\r\nray of hope, for she thought he was about to speak; but his lips moved\r\nwithout any sound leaving his mouth, and making a powerful effort to\r\ncontrol himself, he sent back to his heart the words that were about to\r\nescape from his lips, and went out. Toward midday, Lord de Winter\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nIt was a tolerably fine winter\xe2\x80\x99s day, and a ray of that pale English\r\nsun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison.\r\n\r\nMilady was looking out at the window, and pretended not to hear the\r\ndoor as it opened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord de Winter, \xe2\x80\x9cafter having played comedy, after\r\nhaving played tragedy, we are now playing melancholy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prisoner made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Lord de Winter, \xe2\x80\x9cI understand. You would like\r\nvery well to be at liberty on that beach! You would like very well to\r\nbe in a good ship dancing upon the waves of that emerald-green sea; you\r\nwould like very well, either on land or on the ocean, to lay for me one\r\nof those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning.\r\nPatience, patience! In four days\xe2\x80\x99 time the shore will be beneath your\r\nfeet, the sea will be open to you\xe2\x80\x94more open than will perhaps be\r\nagreeable to you, for in four days England will be relieved of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady folded her hands, and raising her fine eyes toward heaven,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with an angelic meekness of gesture and tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpardon this man, as I myself pardon him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, pray, accursed woman!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the baron; \xe2\x80\x9cyour prayer is so much\r\nthe more generous from your being, I swear to you, in the power of a\r\nman who will never pardon you!\xe2\x80\x9d and he went out.\r\n\r\nAt the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening\r\nof the nearly closed door, and she perceived Felton, who drew quickly\r\nto one side to prevent being seen by her.\r\n\r\nThen she threw herself upon her knees, and began to pray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cthou knowest in what holy cause I suffer;\r\ngive me, then, strength to suffer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened gently; the beautiful supplicant pretended not to hear\r\nthe noise, and in a voice broken by tears, she continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod of vengeance! God of goodness! wilt thou allow the frightful\r\nprojects of this man to be accomplished?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen only she pretended to hear the sound of Felton\xe2\x80\x99s steps, and rising\r\nquick as thought, she blushed, as if ashamed of being surprised on her\r\nknees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not like to disturb those who pray, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton,\r\nseriously; \xe2\x80\x9cdo not disturb yourself on my account, I beseech you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know I was praying, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, in a voice broken by\r\nsobs. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were deceived, sir; I was not praying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think, then, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Felton, in the same serious\r\nvoice, but with a milder tone, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think I assume the right of\r\npreventing a creature from prostrating herself before her Creator? God\r\nforbid! Besides, repentance becomes the guilty; whatever crimes they\r\nmay have committed, for me the guilty are sacred at the feet of God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuilty? I?\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, with a smile which might have disarmed the\r\nangel of the last judgment. \xe2\x80\x9cGuilty? Oh, my God, thou knowest whether I\r\nam guilty! Say I am condemned, sir, if you please; but you know that\r\nGod, who loves martyrs, sometimes permits the innocent to be\r\ncondemned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you condemned, were you innocent, were you a martyr,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nFelton, \xe2\x80\x9cthe greater would be the necessity for prayer; and I myself\r\nwould aid you with my prayers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you are a just man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, throwing herself at his feet.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can hold out no longer, for I fear I shall be wanting in strength at\r\nthe moment when I shall be forced to undergo the struggle, and confess\r\nmy faith. Listen, then, to the supplication of a despairing woman. You\r\nare abused, sir; but that is not the question. I only ask you one\r\nfavor; and if you grant it me, I will bless you in this world and in\r\nthe next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to the master, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton; \xe2\x80\x9chappily I am neither\r\ncharged with the power of pardoning nor punishing. It is upon one\r\nhigher placed than I am that God has laid this responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo you\xe2\x80\x94no, to you alone! Listen to me, rather than add to my\r\ndestruction, rather than add to my ignominy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have merited this shame, madame, if you have incurred this\r\nignominy, you must submit to it as an offering to God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say? Oh, you do not understand me! When I speak of\r\nignominy, you think I speak of some chastisement, of imprisonment or\r\ndeath. Would to heaven! Of what consequence to me is imprisonment or\r\ndeath?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I who no longer understand you, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr, rather, who pretend not to understand me, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nprisoner, with a smile of incredulity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madame, on the honor of a soldier, on the faith of a Christian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you are ignorant of Lord de Winter\xe2\x80\x99s designs upon me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible; you are his confidant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never lie, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he conceals them too little for you not to divine them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI seek to divine nothing, madame; I wait till I am confided in, and\r\napart from that which Lord de Winter has said to me before you, he has\r\nconfided nothing to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, then,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, with an incredible tone of truthfulness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou are not his accomplice; you do not know that he destines me to a\r\ndisgrace which all the punishments of the world cannot equal in\r\nhorror?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are deceived, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, blushing; \xe2\x80\x9cLord de Winter is\r\nnot capable of such a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady to herself; \xe2\x80\x9cwithout thinking what it is, he calls\r\nit a crime!\xe2\x80\x9d Then aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cThe friend of that wretch is capable of\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom do you call _that wretch?_\xe2\x80\x9d asked Felton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there, then, in England two men to whom such an epithet can be\r\napplied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean George Villiers?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Felton, whose looks became excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom Pagans and unbelieving Gentiles call Duke of Buckingham,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nMilady. \xe2\x80\x9cI could not have thought that there was an Englishman in all\r\nEngland who would have required so long an explanation to make him\r\nunderstand of whom I was speaking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hand of the Lord is stretched over him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton; \xe2\x80\x9che will not\r\nescape the chastisement he deserves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton only expressed, with regard to the duke, the feeling of\r\nexecration which all the English had declared toward him whom the\r\nCatholics themselves called the extortioner, the pillager, the\r\ndebauchee, and whom the Puritans styled simply Satan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I supplicate thee to pour\r\nupon this man the chastisement which is his due, thou knowest it is not\r\nmy own vengeance I pursue, but the deliverance of a whole nation that I\r\nimplore!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know him, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Felton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt length he interrogates me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady to herself, at the height\r\nof joy at having obtained so quickly such a great result. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, know\r\nhim? Yes, yes! to my misfortune, to my eternal misfortune!\xe2\x80\x9d and Milady\r\ntwisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of grief.\r\n\r\nFelton no doubt felt within himself that his strength was abandoning\r\nhim, and he made several steps toward the door; but the prisoner, whose\r\neye never left him, sprang in pursuit of him and stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, \xe2\x80\x9cbe kind, be clement, listen to my prayer! That\r\nknife, which the fatal prudence of the baron deprived me of, because he\r\nknows the use I would make of it! Oh, hear me to the end! that knife,\r\ngive it to me for a minute only, for mercy\xe2\x80\x99s, for pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake! I will\r\nembrace your knees! You shall shut the door that you may be certain I\r\ncontemplate no injury to you! My God! to you\xe2\x80\x94the only just, good, and\r\ncompassionate being I have met with! To you\xe2\x80\x94my preserver, perhaps! One\r\nminute that knife, one minute, a single minute, and I will restore it\r\nto you through the grating of the door. Only one minute, Mr. Felton,\r\nand you will have saved my honor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo kill yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felton, with terror, forgetting to withdraw\r\nhis hands from the hands of the prisoner, \xe2\x80\x9cto kill yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Milady, lowering her voice, and allowing\r\nherself to sink overpowered to the ground; \xe2\x80\x9cI have told my secret! He\r\nknows all! My God, I am lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton remained standing, motionless and undecided.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe still doubts,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cI have not been earnest enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomeone was heard in the corridor; Milady recognized the step of Lord\r\nde Winter.\r\n\r\nFelton recognized it also, and made a step toward the door.\r\n\r\nMilady sprang toward him. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, not a word,\xe2\x80\x9d said she in a concentrated\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cnot a word of all that I have said to you to this man, or I am\r\nlost, and it would be you\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen as the steps drew near, she became silent for fear of being heard,\r\napplying, with a gesture of infinite terror, her beautiful hand to\r\nFelton\xe2\x80\x99s mouth.\r\n\r\nFelton gently repulsed Milady, and she sank into a chair.\r\n\r\nLord de Winter passed before the door without stopping, and they heard\r\nthe noise of his footsteps soon die away.\r\n\r\nFelton, as pale as death, remained some instants with his ear bent and\r\nlistening; then, when the sound was quite extinct, he breathed like a\r\nman awaking from a dream, and rushed out of the apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, listening in her turn to the noise of Felton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsteps, which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of Lord de\r\nWinter; \xe2\x80\x9cat length you are mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen her brow darkened. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he tells the baron,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nlost\xe2\x80\x94for the baron, who knows very well that I shall not kill myself,\r\nwill place me before him with a knife in my hand, and he will discover\r\nthat all this despair is but acted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe placed herself before the glass, and regarded herself attentively;\r\nnever had she appeared more beautiful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we won\xe2\x80\x99t tell him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the evening Lord de Winter accompanied the supper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cis your presence an indispensable accessory of my\r\ncaptivity? Could you not spare me the increase of torture which your\r\nvisits cause me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, dear sister!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord de Winter. \xe2\x80\x9cDid not you sentimentally\r\ninform me with that pretty mouth of yours, so cruel to me today, that\r\nyou came to England solely for the pleasure of seeing me at your ease,\r\nan enjoyment of which you told me you so sensibly felt the deprivation\r\nthat you had risked everything for it\xe2\x80\x94seasickness, tempest, captivity?\r\nWell, here I am; be satisfied. Besides, this time, my visit has a\r\nmotive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady trembled; she thought Felton had told all. Perhaps never in her\r\nlife had this woman, who had experienced so many opposite and powerful\r\nemotions, felt her heart beat so violently.\r\n\r\nShe was seated. Lord de Winter took a chair, drew it toward her, and\r\nsat down close beside her. Then taking a paper out of his pocket, he\r\nunfolded it slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to show you the kind of passport which I have\r\ndrawn up, and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in\r\nthe life I consent to leave you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen turning his eyes from Milady to the paper, he read: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Order to\r\nconduct\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 The name is blank,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Lord de Winter. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have\r\nany preference you can point it out to me; and if it be not within a\r\nthousand leagues of London, attention will be paid to your wishes. I\r\nwill begin again, then:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Order to conduct to\xe2\x80\x94the person named Charlotte Backson, branded by\r\nthe justice of the kingdom of France, but liberated after chastisement.\r\nShe is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three\r\nleagues from it. In case of any attempt to escape, the penalty of death\r\nis to be applied. She will receive five shillings per day for lodging\r\nand food\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat order does not concern me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady, coldly, \xe2\x80\x9csince it\r\nbears another name than mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA name? Have you a name, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bear that of your brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but you are mistaken. My brother is only your second husband; and\r\nyour first is still living. Tell me his name, and I will put it in the\r\nplace of the name of Charlotte Backson. No? You will not? You are\r\nsilent? Well, then you must be registered as Charlotte Backson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady remained silent; only this time it was no longer from\r\naffectation, but from terror. She believed the order ready for\r\nexecution. She thought that Lord de Winter had hastened her departure;\r\nshe thought she was condemned to set off that very evening. Everything\r\nin her mind was lost for an instant; when all at once she perceived\r\nthat no signature was attached to the order. The joy she felt at this\r\ndiscovery was so great she could not conceal it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord de Winter, who perceived what was passing in her\r\nmind; \xe2\x80\x9cyes, you look for the signature, and you say to yourself: \xe2\x80\x98All\r\nis not lost, for that order is not signed. It is only shown to me to\r\nterrify me, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x99 You are mistaken. Tomorrow this order will be\r\nsent to the Duke of Buckingham. The day after tomorrow it will return\r\nsigned by his hand and marked with his seal; and four-and-twenty hours\r\nafterward I will answer for its being carried into execution. Adieu,\r\nmadame. That is all I had to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I reply to you, sir, that this abuse of power, this exile under a\r\nfictitious name, are infamous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like better to be hanged in your true name, Milady? You know\r\nthat the English laws are inexorable on the abuse of marriage. Speak\r\nfreely. Although my name, or rather that of my brother, would be mixed\r\nup with the affair, I will risk the scandal of a public trial to make\r\nmyself certain of getting rid of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady made no reply, but became as pale as a corpse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see you prefer peregrination. That\xe2\x80\x99s well madame; and there is\r\nan old proverb that says, \xe2\x80\x98Traveling trains youth.\xe2\x80\x99 My faith! you are\r\nnot wrong after all, and life is sweet. That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why I take\r\nsuch care you shall not deprive me of mine. There only remains, then,\r\nthe question of the five shillings to be settled. You think me rather\r\nparsimonious, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? That\xe2\x80\x99s because I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to leave you the\r\nmeans of corrupting your jailers. Besides, you will always have your\r\ncharms left to seduce them with. Employ them, if your check with regard\r\nto Felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFelton has not told him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing is lost,\r\nthen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, madame, till I see you again! Tomorrow I will come and\r\nannounce to you the departure of my messenger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord de Winter rose, saluted her ironically, and went out.\r\n\r\nMilady breathed again. She had still four days before her. Four days\r\nwould quite suffice to complete the seduction of Felton.\r\n\r\nA terrible idea, however, rushed into her mind. She thought that Lord\r\nde Winter would perhaps send Felton himself to get the order signed by\r\nthe Duke of Buckingham. In that case Felton would escape her\xe2\x80\x94for in\r\norder to secure success, the magic of a continuous seduction was\r\nnecessary. Nevertheless, as we have said, one circumstance reassured\r\nher. Felton had not spoken.\r\n\r\nAs she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of Lord de\r\nWinter, she placed herself at the table and ate.\r\n\r\nThen, as she had done the evening before, she fell on her knees and\r\nrepeated her prayers aloud. As on the evening before, the soldier\r\nstopped his march to listen to her.\r\n\r\nSoon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel, which\r\ncame from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is he,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. And she began the same religious chant which had\r\nso strongly excited Felton the evening before.\r\n\r\nBut although her voice\xe2\x80\x94sweet, full, and sonorous\xe2\x80\x94vibrated as\r\nharmoniously and as affectingly as ever, the door remained shut. It\r\nappeared however to Milady that in one of the furtive glances she\r\ndarted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw\r\nthe ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening. But\r\nwhether this was reality or vision, he had this time sufficient\r\nself-command not to enter.\r\n\r\nHowever, a few instants after she had finished her religious song,\r\nMilady thought she heard a profound sigh. Then the same steps she had\r\nheard approach slowly withdrew, as if with regret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LV.\r\nCAPTIVITY: THE FOURTH DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, when Felton entered Milady\xe2\x80\x99s apartment he found her\r\nstanding, mounted upon a chair, holding in her hands a cord made by\r\nmeans of torn cambric handkerchiefs, twisted into a kind of rope one\r\nwith another, and tied at the ends. At the noise Felton made in\r\nentering, Milady leaped lightly to the ground, and tried to conceal\r\nbehind her the improvised cord she held in her hand.\r\n\r\nThe young man was more pale than usual, and his eyes, reddened by want\r\nof sleep, denoted that he had passed a feverish night. Nevertheless,\r\nhis brow was armed with a severity more austere than ever.\r\n\r\nHe advanced slowly toward Milady, who had seated herself, and taking an\r\nend of the murderous rope which by neglect, or perhaps by design, she\r\nallowed to be seen, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat? Nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, smiling with that painful expression\r\nwhich she knew so well how to give to her smile. \xe2\x80\x9cEnnui is the mortal\r\nenemy of prisoners; I had ennui, and I amused myself with twisting that\r\nrope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment\r\nbefore which he had found Milady standing in the armchair in which she\r\nwas now seated, and over her head he perceived a gilt-headed screw,\r\nfixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons.\r\n\r\nHe started, and the prisoner saw that start\xe2\x80\x94for though her eyes were\r\ncast down, nothing escaped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you doing on that armchair?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what consequence?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not question me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prisoner; \xe2\x80\x9cyou know that we who are true\r\nChristians are forbidden to lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you what you were doing, or\r\nrather what you meant to do; you were going to complete the fatal\r\nproject you cherish in your mind. Remember, madame, if our God forbids\r\nfalsehood, he much more severely condemns suicide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen God sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly, placed between\r\nsuicide and dishonor, believe me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady, in a tone of\r\ndeep conviction, \xe2\x80\x9cGod pardons suicide, for then suicide becomes\r\nmartyrdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say either too much or too little; speak, madame. In the name of\r\nheaven, explain yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I may relate my misfortunes for you to treat them as fables; that\r\nI may tell you my projects for you to go and betray them to my\r\npersecutor? No, sir. Besides, of what importance to you is the life or\r\ndeath of a condemned wretch? You are only responsible for my body, is\r\nit not so? And provided you produce a carcass that may be recognized as\r\nmine, they will require no more of you; nay, perhaps you will even have\r\na double reward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, madame, I?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felton. \xe2\x80\x9cYou suppose that I would ever accept the\r\nprice of your life? Oh, you cannot believe what you say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me act as I please, Felton, let me act as I please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady,\r\nelated. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery soldier must be ambitious, must he not? You are a\r\nlieutenant? Well, you will follow me to the grave with the rank of\r\ncaptain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I, then, done to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, much agitated, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\nshould load me with such a responsibility before God and before men? In\r\na few days you will be away from this place; your life, madame, will\r\nthen no longer be under my care, and,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cthen you\r\ncan do what you will with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, as if she could not resist giving utterance to a\r\nholy indignation, \xe2\x80\x9cyou, a pious man, you who are called a just man, you\r\nask but one thing\xe2\x80\x94and that is that you may not be inculpated, annoyed,\r\nby my death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my duty to watch over your life, madame, and I will watch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you understand the mission you are fulfilling? Cruel enough, if\r\nI am guilty; but what name can you give it, what name will the Lord\r\ngive it, if I am innocent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a soldier, madame, and fulfill the orders I have received.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe, then, that at the day of the Last Judgment God will\r\nseparate blind executioners from iniquitous judges? You are not willing\r\nthat I should kill my body, and you make yourself the agent of him who\r\nwould kill my soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I repeat it again to you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Felton, in great emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cno\r\ndanger threatens you; I will answer for Lord de Winter as for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDunce,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cdunce! who dares to answer for another man,\r\nwhen the wisest, when those most after God\xe2\x80\x99s own heart, hesitate to\r\nanswer for themselves, and who ranges himself on the side of the\r\nstrongest and the most fortunate, to crush the weakest and the most\r\nunfortunate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible, madame, impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Felton, who felt to the\r\nbottom of his heart the justness of this argument. \xe2\x80\x9cA prisoner, you\r\nwill not recover your liberty through me; living, you will not lose\r\nyour life through me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I shall lose that which is much dearer to me\r\nthan life, I shall lose my honor, Felton; and it is you, you whom I\r\nmake responsible, before God and before men, for my shame and my\r\ninfamy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time Felton, immovable as he was, or appeared to be, could not\r\nresist the secret influence which had already taken possession of him.\r\nTo see this woman, so beautiful, fair as the brightest vision, to see\r\nher by turns overcome with grief and threatening; to resist at once the\r\nascendancy of grief and beauty\xe2\x80\x94it was too much for a visionary; it was\r\ntoo much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic\r\nfaith; it was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that\r\nburns, by the hatred of men that devours.\r\n\r\nMilady saw the trouble. She felt by intuition the flame of the opposing\r\npassions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic.\r\nAs a skillful general, seeing the enemy ready to surrender, marches\r\ntoward him with a cry of victory, she rose, beautiful as an antique\r\npriestess, inspired like a Christian virgin, her arms extended, her\r\nthroat uncovered, her hair disheveled, holding with one hand her robe\r\nmodestly drawn over her breast, her look illumined by that fire which\r\nhad already created such disorder in the veins of the young Puritan,\r\nand went toward him, crying out with a vehement air, and in her\r\nmelodious voice, to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible\r\nenergy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet this victim to Baal be sent,\r\n    To the lions the martyr be thrown!\r\nThy God shall teach thee to repent!\r\n    From th\xe2\x80\x99 abyss he\xe2\x80\x99ll give ear to my moan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nFelton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho art thou? Who art thou?\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, clasping his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cArt thou a\r\nmessenger from God; art thou a minister from hell; art thou an angel or\r\na demon; callest thou thyself Eloa or Astarte?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not know me, Felton? I am neither an angel nor a demon; I am a\r\ndaughter of earth, I am a sister of thy faith, that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cI doubted, but now I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou believe, and still you are an accomplice of that child of Belial\r\nwho is called Lord de Winter! You believe, and yet you leave me in the\r\nhands of mine enemies, of the enemy of England, of the enemy of God!\r\nYou believe, and yet you deliver me up to him who fills and defiles the\r\nworld with his heresies and debaucheries\xe2\x80\x94to that infamous Sardanapalus\r\nwhom the blind call the Duke of Buckingham, and whom believers name\r\nAntichrist!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI deliver you up to Buckingham? I? what mean you by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they see not; ears have they, but\r\nthey hear not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, passing his hands over his brow, covered with\r\nsweat, as if to remove his last doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I recognize the voice\r\nwhich speaks to me in my dreams; yes, I recognize the features of the\r\nangel who appears to me every night, crying to my soul, which cannot\r\nsleep: \xe2\x80\x98Strike, save England, save thyself\xe2\x80\x94for thou wilt die without\r\nhaving appeased God!\xe2\x80\x99 Speak, speak!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cI can understand\r\nyou now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA flash of terrible joy, but rapid as thought, gleamed from the eyes of\r\nMilady.\r\n\r\nHowever fugitive this homicide flash, Felton saw it, and started as if\r\nits light had revealed the abysses of this woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart. He recalled,\r\nall at once, the warnings of Lord de Winter, the seductions of Milady,\r\nher first attempts after her arrival. He drew back a step, and hung\r\ndown his head, without, however, ceasing to look at her, as if,\r\nfascinated by this strange creature, he could not detach his eyes from\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\nMilady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this hesitation.\r\nUnder her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her.\r\nBefore Felton replied, and before she should be forced to resume this\r\nconversation, so difficult to be sustained in the same exalted tone,\r\nshe let her hands fall; and as if the weakness of the woman overpowered\r\nthe enthusiasm of the inspired fanatic, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cBut no, it is not\r\nfor me to be the Judith to deliver Bethulia from this Holofernes. The\r\nsword of the eternal is too heavy for my arm. Allow me, then, to avoid\r\ndishonor by death; let me take refuge in martyrdom. I do not ask you\r\nfor liberty, as a guilty one would, nor for vengeance, as would a\r\npagan. Let me die; that is all. I supplicate you, I implore you on my\r\nknees\xe2\x80\x94let me die, and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my\r\npreserver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHearing that voice, so sweet and suppliant, seeing that look, so timid\r\nand downcast, Felton reproached himself. By degrees the enchantress had\r\nclothed herself with that magic adornment which she assumed and threw\r\naside at will; that is to say, beauty, meekness, and tears\xe2\x80\x94and above\r\nall, the irresistible attraction of mystical voluptuousness, the most\r\ndevouring of all voluptuousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cI can do but one thing, which is to pity you if\r\nyou prove to me you are a victim! But Lord de Winter makes cruel\r\naccusations against you. You are a Christian; you are my sister in\r\nreligion. I feel myself drawn toward you\xe2\x80\x94I, who have never loved anyone\r\nbut my benefactor\xe2\x80\x94I who have met with nothing but traitors and impious\r\nmen. But you, madame, so beautiful in reality, you, so pure in\r\nappearance, must have committed great iniquities for Lord de Winter to\r\npursue you thus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Milady, with an accent of indescribable\r\ngrief, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they see not; ears have they, but they hear not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young officer, \xe2\x80\x9cspeak, then, speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfide my shame to you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, with the blush of modesty upon\r\nher countenance, \xe2\x80\x9cfor often the crime of one becomes the shame of\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x94confide my shame to you, a man, and I a woman? Oh,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nshe, placing her hand modestly over her beautiful eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cnever!\r\nnever!\xe2\x80\x94I could not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo me, to a brother?\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton.\r\n\r\nMilady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young\r\nman took for doubt, but which, however, was nothing but observation, or\r\nrather the wish to fascinate.\r\n\r\nFelton, in his turn a suppliant, clasped his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cI confide in my brother; I will dare to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the steps of Lord de Winter were heard; but this time\r\nthe terrible brother-in-law of Milady did not content himself, as on\r\nthe preceding day, with passing before the door and going away again.\r\nHe paused, exchanged two words with the sentinel; then the door opened,\r\nand he appeared.\r\n\r\nDuring the exchange of these two words Felton drew back quickly, and\r\nwhen Lord de Winter entered, he was several paces from the prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe baron entered slowly, sending a scrutinizing glance from Milady to\r\nthe young officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been here a very long time, John,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cHas this woman\r\nbeen relating her crimes to you? In that case I can comprehend the\r\nlength of the conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton started; and Milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the\r\nassistance of the disconcerted Puritan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you fear your prisoner should escape!\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, ask your\r\nworthy jailer what favor I this instant solicited of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou demanded a favor?\xe2\x80\x9d said the baron, suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young man, confused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what favor, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lord de Winter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA knife, which she would return to me through the grating of the door\r\na minute after she had received it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Felton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is someone, then, concealed here whose throat this amiable lady\r\nis desirous of cutting,\xe2\x80\x9d said de Winter, in an ironical, contemptuous\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is myself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have given you the choice between America and Tyburn,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lord\r\nde Winter. \xe2\x80\x9cChoose Tyburn, madame. Believe me, the cord is more certain\r\nthan the knife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton grew pale, and made a step forward, remembering that at the\r\nmoment he entered Milady had a rope in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI have often thought of it.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she added\r\nin a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will think of it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones; probably Lord de\r\nWinter perceived this emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMistrust yourself, John,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI have placed reliance upon you,\r\nmy friend. Beware! I have warned you! But be of good courage, my lad;\r\nin three days we shall be delivered from this creature, and where I\r\nshall send her she can harm nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hear him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, with vehemence, so that the baron might\r\nbelieve she was addressing heaven, and that Felton might understand she\r\nwas addressing him.\r\n\r\nFelton lowered his head and reflected.\r\n\r\nThe baron took the young officer by the arm, and turned his head over\r\nhis shoulder, so as not to lose sight of Milady till he was gone out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prisoner, when the door was shut, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not so far\r\nadvanced as I believed. De Winter has changed his usual stupidity into\r\na strange prudence. It is the desire of vengeance, and how desire molds\r\na man! As to Felton, he hesitates. Ah, he is not a man like that cursed\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. A Puritan only adores virgins, and he adores them by\r\nclasping his hands. A Musketeer loves women, and he loves them by\r\nclasping his arms round them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady waited, then, with much impatience, for she feared the day would\r\npass away without her seeing Felton again. At last, in an hour after\r\nthe scene we have just described, she heard someone speaking in a low\r\nvoice at the door. Presently the door opened, and she perceived Felton.\r\n\r\nThe young man advanced rapidly into the chamber, leaving the door open\r\nbehind him, and making a sign to Milady to be silent; his face was much\r\nagitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want with me?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Felton, in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI have just sent away the\r\nsentinel that I might remain here without anybody knowing it, in order\r\nto speak to you without being overheard. The baron has just related a\r\nfrightful story to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady assumed her smile of a resigned victim, and shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEither you are a demon,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cor the baron\xe2\x80\x94my\r\nbenefactor, my father\xe2\x80\x94is a monster. I have known you four days; I have\r\nloved him four years. I therefore may hesitate between you. Be not\r\nalarmed at what I say; I want to be convinced. Tonight, after twelve, I\r\nwill come and see you, and you shall convince me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Felton, no, my brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cthe sacrifice is too great,\r\nand I feel what it must cost you. No, I am lost; do not be lost with\r\nme. My death will be much more eloquent than my life, and the silence\r\nof the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the\r\nprisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe silent, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cand do not speak to me thus; I came\r\nto entreat you to promise me upon your honor, to swear to me by what\r\nyou hold most sacred, that you will make no attempt upon your life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not promise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cfor no one has more respect for a\r\npromise or an oath than I have; and if I make a promise I must keep\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, \xe2\x80\x9conly promise till you have seen me again. If,\r\nwhen you have seen me again, you still persist\xe2\x80\x94well, then you shall be\r\nfree, and I myself will give you the weapon you desire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cfor you I will wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear it, by our God. Are you satisfied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, \xe2\x80\x9ctill tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he darted out of the room, shut the door, and waited in the\r\ncorridor, the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s half-pike in his hand, and as if he had mounted\r\nguard in his place.\r\n\r\nThe soldier returned, and Felton gave him back his weapon.\r\n\r\nThen, through the grating to which she had drawn near, Milady saw the\r\nyoung man make a sign with delirious fervor, and depart in an apparent\r\ntransport of joy.\r\n\r\nAs for her, she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt\r\nupon her lips, and repeated, blaspheming, that terrible name of God, by\r\nwhom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know Him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a senseless fanatic! My God, it is I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthis fellow who will help me to avenge myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVI.\r\nCAPTIVITY: THE FIFTH DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nMilady had however achieved a half-triumph, and success doubled her\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult to conquer, as she had hitherto done, men prompt\r\nto let themselves be seduced, and whom the gallant education of a court\r\nled quickly into her net. Milady was handsome enough not to find much\r\nresistance on the part of the flesh, and she was sufficiently skillful\r\nto prevail over all the obstacles of the mind.\r\n\r\nBut this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature,\r\nconcentrated and insensible by force of austerity. Religion and its\r\nobservances had made Felton a man inaccessible to ordinary seductions.\r\nThere fermented in that sublimated brain plans so vast, projects so\r\ntumultuous, that there remained no room for any capricious or material\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x94that sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with corruption.\r\nMilady had, then, made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a\r\nman horribly prejudiced against her, and by her beauty in the heart of\r\na man hitherto chaste and pure. In short, she had taken the measure of\r\nmotives hitherto unknown to herself, through this experiment, made upon\r\nthe most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to\r\nher study.\r\n\r\nMany a time, nevertheless, during the evening she despaired of fate and\r\nof herself. She did not invoke God, we very well know, but she had\r\nfaith in the genius of evil\xe2\x80\x94that immense sovereignty which reigns in\r\nall the details of human life, and by which, as in the Arabian fable, a\r\nsingle pomegranate seed is sufficient to reconstruct a ruined world.\r\n\r\nMilady, being well prepared for the reception of Felton, was able to\r\nerect her batteries for the next day. She knew she had only two days\r\nleft; that when once the order was signed by Buckingham\xe2\x80\x94and Buckingham\r\nwould sign it the more readily from its bearing a false name, and he\r\ncould not, therefore, recognize the woman in question\xe2\x80\x94once this order\r\nwas signed, we say, the baron would make her embark immediately, and\r\nshe knew very well that women condemned to exile employ arms much less\r\npowerful in their seductions than the pretendedly virtuous woman whose\r\nbeauty is lighted by the sun of the world, whose style the voice of\r\nfashion lauds, and whom a halo of aristocracy gilds with enchanting\r\nsplendors. To be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful\r\npunishment is no impediment to beauty, but it is an obstacle to the\r\nrecovery of power. Like all persons of real genius, Milady knew what\r\nsuited her nature and her means. Poverty was repugnant to her;\r\ndegradation took away two-thirds of her greatness. Milady was only a\r\nqueen while among queens. The pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary\r\nto her domination. To command inferior beings was rather a humiliation\r\nthan a pleasure for her.\r\n\r\nShe should certainly return from her exile\xe2\x80\x94she did not doubt that a\r\nsingle instant; but how long might this exile last? For an active,\r\nambitious nature, like that of Milady, days not spent in climbing are\r\ninauspicious days. What word, then, can be found to describe the days\r\nwhich they occupy in descending? To lose a year, two years, three\r\nyears, is to talk of an eternity; to return after the death or disgrace\r\nof the cardinal, perhaps; to return when D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and his friends,\r\nhappy and triumphant, should have received from the queen the reward\r\nthey had well acquired by the services they had rendered her\xe2\x80\x94these were\r\ndevouring ideas that a woman like Milady could not endure. For the\r\nrest, the storm which raged within her doubled her strength, and she\r\nwould have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to\r\ntake for a single instant the proportions of her mind.\r\n\r\nThen that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this\r\nwas the remembrance of the cardinal. What must the mistrustful,\r\nrestless, suspicious cardinal think of her silence\xe2\x80\x94the cardinal, not\r\nmerely her only support, her only prop, her only protector at present,\r\nbut still further, the principal instrument of her future fortune and\r\nvengeance? She knew him; she knew that at her return from a fruitless\r\njourney it would be in vain to tell him of her imprisonment, in vain to\r\nenlarge upon the sufferings she had undergone. The cardinal would\r\nreply, with the sarcastic calmness of the skeptic, strong at once by\r\npower and genius, \xe2\x80\x9cYou should not have allowed yourself to be taken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Milady collected all her energies, murmuring in the depths of her\r\nsoul the name of Felton\xe2\x80\x94the only beam of light that penetrated to her\r\nin the hell into which she had fallen; and like a serpent which folds\r\nand unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength, she enveloped Felton\r\nbeforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination.\r\n\r\nTime, however, passed away; the hours, one after another, seemed to\r\nawaken the clock as they passed, and every blow of the brass hammer\r\nresounded upon the heart of the prisoner. At nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Lord de\r\nWinter made his customary visit, examined the window and the bars,\r\nsounded the floor and the walls, looked to the chimney and the doors,\r\nwithout, during this long and minute examination, he or Milady\r\npronouncing a single word.\r\n\r\nDoubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too\r\nserious to lose time in useless words and aimless wrath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the baron, on leaving her \xe2\x80\x9cyou will not escape tonight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock Felton came and placed the sentinel. Milady recognized\r\nhis step. She was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with\r\nthat of the lover of her heart; and yet Milady at the same time\r\ndetested and despised this weak fanatic.\r\n\r\nThat was not the appointed hour. Felton did not enter.\r\n\r\nTwo hours after, as midnight sounded, the sentinel was relieved. This\r\ntime it _was_ the hour, and from this moment Milady waited with\r\nimpatience. The new sentinel commenced his walk in the corridor. At the\r\nexpiration of ten minutes Felton came.\r\n\r\nMilady was all attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man to the sentinel. \xe2\x80\x9cOn no pretense leave the\r\ndoor, for you know that last night my Lord punished a soldier for\r\nhaving quit his post for an instant, although I, during his absence,\r\nwatched in his place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the soldier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recommend you therefore to keep the strictest watch. For my part I\r\nam going to pay a second visit to this woman, who I fear entertains\r\nsinister intentions upon her own life, and I have received orders to\r\nwatch her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cthe austere Puritan lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs to the soldier, he only smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZounds, Lieutenant!\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not unlucky in being charged\r\nwith such commissions, particularly if my Lord has authorized you to\r\nlook into her bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton blushed. Under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded\r\nthe soldier for indulging in such pleasantry, but his conscience\r\nmurmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I call, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIf anyone comes, call me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, Lieutenant,\xe2\x80\x9d said the soldier.\r\n\r\nFelton entered Milady\xe2\x80\x99s apartment. Milady arose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are here!\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promised to come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou promised me something else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, who in spite of his self-command\r\nfelt his knees tremble and the sweat start from his brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou promised to bring a knife, and to leave it with me after our\r\ninterview.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay no more of that, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no situation,\r\nhowever terrible it may be, which can authorize a creature of God to\r\ninflict death upon himself. I have reflected, and I cannot, must not be\r\nguilty of such a sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you have reflected!\xe2\x80\x9d said the prisoner, sitting down in her\r\narmchair, with a smile of disdain; \xe2\x80\x9cand I also have reflected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I can have nothing to say to a man who does not keep his word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Felton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may retire,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady. \xe2\x80\x9cI will not talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the knife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, drawing from his pocket the weapon\r\nwhich he had brought, according to his promise, but which he hesitated\r\nto give to his prisoner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my honor, I will instantly return it to you. You shall place it\r\non that table, and you may remain between it and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton offered the weapon to Milady, who examined the temper of it\r\nattentively, and who tried the point on the tip of her finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, returning the knife to the young officer, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is\r\nfine and good steel. You are a faithful friend, Felton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton took back the weapon, and laid it upon the table, as he had\r\nagreed with the prisoner.\r\n\r\nMilady followed him with her eyes, and made a gesture of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9clisten to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe request was needless. The young officer stood upright before her,\r\nawaiting her words as if to devour them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFelton,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, with a solemnity full of melancholy, \xe2\x80\x9cimagine\r\nthat your sister, the daughter of your father, speaks to you. While yet\r\nyoung, unfortunately handsome, I was dragged into a snare. I resisted.\r\nAmbushes and violences multiplied around me, but I resisted. The\r\nreligion I serve, the God I adore, were blasphemed because I called\r\nupon that religion and that God, but still I resisted. Then outrages\r\nwere heaped upon me, and as my soul was not subdued they wished to\r\ndefile my body forever. Finally\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady stopped, and a bitter smile passed over her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinally,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cfinally, what did they do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt length, one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he\r\ncould not conquer. One evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my\r\nwater. Scarcely had I finished my repast, when I felt myself sink by\r\ndegrees into a strange torpor. Although I was without mistrust, a vague\r\nfear seized me, and I tried to struggle against sleepiness. I arose. I\r\nwished to run to the window and call for help, but my legs refused\r\ntheir office. It appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and\r\ncrushed me with its weight. I stretched out my arms. I tried to speak.\r\nI could only utter inarticulate sounds, and irresistible faintness came\r\nover me. I supported myself by a chair, feeling that I was about to\r\nfall, but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak\r\narms. I fell upon one knee, then upon both. I tried to pray, but my\r\ntongue was frozen. God doubtless neither heard nor saw me, and I sank\r\nupon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf all that passed in that sleep, or the time which glided away while\r\nit lasted, I have no remembrance. The only thing I recollect is that I\r\nawoke in bed in a round chamber, the furniture of which was sumptuous,\r\nand into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling. No\r\ndoor gave entrance to the room. It might be called a magnificent\r\nprison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a long time before I was able to make out what place I was in,\r\nor to take account of the details I describe. My mind appeared to\r\nstrive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which\r\nI could not rouse myself. I had vague perceptions of space traversed,\r\nof the rolling of a carriage, of a horrible dream in which my strength\r\nhad become exhausted; but all this was so dark and so indistinct in my\r\nmind that these events seemed to belong to another life than mine, and\r\nyet mixed with mine in fantastic duality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt times the state into which I had fallen appeared so strange that I\r\nbelieved myself dreaming. I arose trembling. My clothes were near me on\r\na chair; I neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to bed.\r\nThen by degrees the reality broke upon me, full of chaste terrors. I\r\nwas no longer in the house where I had dwelt. As well as I could judge\r\nby the light of the sun, the day was already two-thirds gone. It was\r\nthe evening before when I had fallen asleep; my sleep, then, must have\r\nlasted twenty-four hours! What had taken place during this long sleep?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dressed myself as quickly as possible; my slow and stiff motions all\r\nattested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely\r\ndissipated. The chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a\r\nwoman; and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish, but\r\non casting her eyes about the apartment, she would have found that wish\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I was not the first captive that had been shut up in this\r\nsplendid prison; but you may easily comprehend, Felton, that the more\r\nsuperb the prison, the greater was my terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was a prison, for I tried in vain to get out of it. I sounded\r\nall the walls, in the hopes of discovering a door, but everywhere the\r\nwalls returned a full and flat sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made the tour of the room at least twenty times, in search of an\r\noutlet of some kind; but there was none. I sank exhausted with fatigue\r\nand terror into an armchair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeantime, night came on rapidly, and with night my terrors increased.\r\nI did not know but I had better remain where I was seated. It appeared\r\nthat I was surrounded with unknown dangers into which I was about to\r\nfall at every instant. Although I had eaten nothing since the evening\r\nbefore, my fears prevented my feeling hunger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo noise from without by which I could measure the time reached me; I\r\nonly supposed it must be seven or eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, for it\r\nwas in the month of October and it was quite dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll at once the noise of a door, turning on its hinges, made me start.\r\nA globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling,\r\ncasting a strong light into my chamber; and I perceived with terror\r\nthat a man was standing within a few paces of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA table, with two covers, bearing a supper ready prepared, stood, as\r\nif by magic, in the middle of the apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat man was he who had pursued me during a whole year, who had vowed\r\nmy dishonor, and who, by the first words that issued from his mouth,\r\ngave me to understand he had accomplished it the preceding night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Felton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, seeing the interest which the young\r\nofficer, whose soul seemed to hang on her lips, took in this strange\r\nrecital. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, scoundrel! He believed, having triumphed over me in\r\nmy sleep, that all was completed. He came, hoping that I would accept\r\nmy shame, as my shame was consummated; he came to offer his fortune in\r\nexchange for my love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that the heart of a woman could contain of haughty contempt and\r\ndisdainful words, I poured out upon this man. Doubtless he was\r\naccustomed to such reproaches, for he listened to me calm and smiling,\r\nwith his arms crossed over his breast. Then, when he thought I had said\r\nall, he advanced toward me; I sprang toward the table, I seized a\r\nknife, I placed it to my breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake one step more,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand in addition to my dishonor, you\r\nshall have my death to reproach yourself with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was, no doubt, in my look, my voice, my whole person, that\r\nsincerity of gesture, of attitude, of accent, which carries conviction\r\nto the most perverse minds, for he paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Your death?\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98oh, no, you are too charming a mistress to\r\nallow me to consent to lose you thus, after I have had the happiness to\r\npossess you only a single time. Adieu, my charmer; I will wait to pay\r\nyou my next visit till you are in a better humor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt these words he blew a whistle; the globe of fire which lighted the\r\nroom reascended and disappeared. I found myself again in complete\r\ndarkness. The same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated\r\nthe instant afterward; the flaming globe descended afresh, and I was\r\ncompletely alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis moment was frightful; if I had any doubts as to my misfortune,\r\nthese doubts had vanished in an overwhelming reality. I was in the\r\npower of a man whom I not only detested, but despised\xe2\x80\x94of a man capable\r\nof anything, and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was\r\nable to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who, then, was this man?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Felton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI passed the night on a chair, starting at the least noise, for toward\r\nmidnight the lamp went out, and I was again in darkness. But the night\r\npassed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor. Day\r\ncame; the table had disappeared, only I had still the knife in my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis knife was my only hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was worn out with fatigue. Sleeplessness inflamed my eyes; I had not\r\ndared to sleep a single instant. The light of day reassured me; I went\r\nand threw myself on the bed, without parting with the emancipating\r\nknife, which I concealed under my pillow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I awoke, a fresh meal was served.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis time, in spite of my terrors, in spite of my agony, I began to\r\nfeel a devouring hunger. It was forty-eight hours since I had taken any\r\nnourishment. I ate some bread and some fruit; then, remembering the\r\nnarcotic mixed with the water I had drunk, I would not touch that which\r\nwas placed on the table, but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed\r\nin the wall over my dressing table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, notwithstanding these precautions, I remained for some time\r\nin a terrible agitation of mind. But my fears were this time\r\nill-founded; I passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind\r\nI dreaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took the precaution to half empty the _carafe_, in order that my\r\nsuspicions might not be noticed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe evening came on, and with it darkness; but however profound was\r\nthis darkness, my eyes began to accustom themselves to it. I saw, amid\r\nthe shadows, the table sink through the floor; a quarter of an hour\r\nlater it reappeared, bearing my supper. In an instant, thanks to the\r\nlamp, my chamber was once more lighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have\r\nanything soporific introduced into them. Two eggs and some fruit\r\ncomposed my repast; then I drew another glass of water from my\r\nprotecting fountain, and drank it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the first swallow, it appeared to me not to have the same taste as\r\nin the morning. Suspicion instantly seized me. I paused, but I had\r\nalready drunk half a glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI threw the rest away with horror, and waited, with the dew of fear\r\nupon my brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that\r\nfountain, and had taken advantage of my confidence in it, the better to\r\nassure my ruin, so coolly resolved upon, so cruelly pursued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear;\r\nbut as I had only drunk half a glass of the water, I contended longer,\r\nand instead of falling entirely asleep, I sank into a state of\r\ndrowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me,\r\nwhile depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dragged myself toward the bed, to seek the only defense I had\r\nleft\xe2\x80\x94my saving knife; but I could not reach the bolster. I sank on my\r\nknees, my hands clasped round one of the bedposts; then I felt that I\r\nwas lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton became frightfully pale, and a convulsive tremor crept through\r\nhis whole body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what was most frightful,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Milady, her voice altered, as\r\nif she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute, \xe2\x80\x9cwas\r\nthat at this time I retained a consciousness of the danger that\r\nthreatened me; was that my soul, if I may say so, waked in my sleeping\r\nbody; was that I saw, that I heard. It is true that all was like a\r\ndream, but it was not the less frightful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw the lamp ascend, and leave me in darkness; then I heard the\r\nwell-known creaking of the door although I had heard that door open but\r\ntwice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt instinctively that someone approached me; it is said that the\r\ndoomed wretch in the deserts of America thus feels the approach of the\r\nserpent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wished to make an effort; I attempted to cry out. By an incredible\r\neffort of will I even raised myself up, but only to sink down again\r\nimmediately, and to fall into the arms of my persecutor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me who this man was!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young officer.\r\n\r\nMilady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in\r\nFelton by dwelling on every detail of her recital; but she would not\r\nspare him a single pang. The more profoundly she wounded his heart, the\r\nmore certainly he would avenge her. She continued, then, as if she had\r\nnot heard his exclamation, or as if she thought the moment was not yet\r\ncome to reply to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly this time it was no longer an inert body, without feeling, that\r\nthe villain had to deal with. I have told you that without being able\r\nto regain the complete exercise of my faculties, I retained the sense\r\nof my danger. I struggled, then, with all my strength, and doubtless\r\nopposed, weak as I was, a long resistance, for I heard him cry out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98These miserable Puritans! I knew very well that they tired out their\r\nexecutioners, but I did not believe them so strong against their\r\nlovers!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! this desperate resistance could not last long. I felt my\r\nstrength fail, and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the\r\ncoward to prevail, but my swoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton listened without uttering any word or sound, except an inward\r\nexpression of agony. The sweat streamed down his marble forehead, and\r\nhis hand, under his coat, tore his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy first impulse, on coming to myself, was to feel under my pillow for\r\nthe knife I had not been able to reach; if it had not been useful for\r\ndefense, it might at least serve for expiation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut on taking this knife, Felton, a terrible idea occurred to me. I\r\nhave sworn to tell you all, and I will tell you all. I have promised\r\nyou the truth; I will tell it, were it to destroy me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man, did it\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady. \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea was not that of a Christian, I knew; but\r\nwithout doubt, that eternal enemy of our souls, that lion roaring\r\nconstantly around us, breathed it into my mind. In short, what shall I\r\nsay to you, Felton?\xe2\x80\x9d continued Milady, in the tone of a woman accusing\r\nherself of a crime. \xe2\x80\x9cThis idea occurred to me, and did not leave me; it\r\nis of this homicidal thought that I now bear the punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cContinue, continue!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton; \xe2\x80\x9cI am eager to see you attain your\r\nvengeance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I resolved that it should take place as soon as possible. I had no\r\ndoubt he would return the following night. During the day I had nothing\r\nto fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the hour of breakfast came, therefore, I did not hesitate to eat\r\nand drink. I had determined to make believe sup, but to eat nothing. I\r\nwas forced, then, to combat the fast of the evening with the\r\nnourishment of the morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly I concealed a glass of water, which remained after my breakfast,\r\nthirst having been the chief of my sufferings when I remained\r\nforty-eight hours without eating or drinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day passed away without having any other influence on me than to\r\nstrengthen the resolution I had formed; only I took care that my face\r\nshould not betray the thoughts of my heart, for I had no doubt I was\r\nwatched. Several times, even, I felt a smile on my lips. Felton, I dare\r\nnot tell you at what idea I smiled; you would hold me in horror\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on! go on!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton; \xe2\x80\x9cyou see plainly that I listen, and that I\r\nam anxious to know the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvening came; the ordinary events took place. During the darkness, as\r\nbefore, my supper was brought. Then the lamp was lighted, and I sat\r\ndown to table. I only ate some fruit. I pretended to pour out water\r\nfrom the jug, but I only drank that which I had saved in my glass. The\r\nsubstitution was made so carefully that my spies, if I had any, could\r\nhave no suspicion of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter supper I exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding\r\nevening; but this time, as I yielded to fatigue, or as if I had become\r\nfamiliarized with danger, I dragged myself toward my bed, let my robe\r\nfall, and lay down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found my knife where I had placed it, under my pillow, and while\r\nfeigning to sleep, my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo hours passed away without anything fresh happening. Oh, my God!\r\nwho could have said so the evening before? I began to fear that he\r\nwould not come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt length I saw the lamp rise softly, and disappear in the depths of\r\nthe ceiling; my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity, but I\r\nmade a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearly ten minutes passed; I heard no other noise but the beating of\r\nmy own heart. I implored heaven that he might come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt length I heard the well-known noise of the door, which opened and\r\nshut; I heard, notwithstanding the thickness of the carpet, a step\r\nwhich made the floor creak; I saw, notwithstanding the darkness, a\r\nshadow which approached my bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaste! haste!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton; \xe2\x80\x9cdo you not see that each of your words\r\nburns me like molten lead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cthen I collected all my strength; I recalled\r\nto my mind that the moment of vengeance, or rather, of justice, had\r\nstruck. I looked upon myself as another Judith; I gathered myself up,\r\nmy knife in my hand, and when I saw him near me, stretching out his\r\narms to find his victim, then, with the last cry of agony and despair,\r\nI struck him in the middle of his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe miserable villain! He had foreseen all. His breast was covered\r\nwith a coat-of-mail; the knife was bent against it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ah, ah!\xe2\x80\x99 cried he, seizing my arm, and wresting from me the weapon\r\nthat had so badly served me, \xe2\x80\x98you want to take my life, do you, my\r\npretty Puritan? But that\xe2\x80\x99s more than dislike, that\xe2\x80\x99s ingratitude! Come,\r\ncome, calm yourself, my sweet girl! I thought you had softened. I am\r\nnot one of those tyrants who detain women by force. You don\xe2\x80\x99t love me.\r\nWith my usual fatuity I doubted it; now I am convinced. Tomorrow you\r\nshall be free.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had but one wish; that was that he should kill me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Beware!\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98for my liberty is your dishonor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Explain yourself, my pretty sibyl!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes; for as soon as I leave this place I will tell everything. I will\r\nproclaim the violence you have used toward me. I will describe my\r\ncaptivity. I will denounce this place of infamy. You are placed on\r\nhigh, my Lord, but tremble! Above you there is the king; above the king\r\nthere is God!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever perfect master he was over himself, my persecutor allowed a\r\nmovement of anger to escape him. I could not see the expression of his\r\ncountenance, but I felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was placed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Then you shall not leave this place,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 cried I, \xe2\x80\x98then the place of my punishment will be that of\r\nmy tomb. I will die here, and you will see if a phantom that accuses is\r\nnot more terrible than a living being that threatens!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You shall have no weapon left in your power.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98There is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every\r\ncreature who has the courage to use it. I will allow myself to die with\r\nhunger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Come,\xe2\x80\x99 said the wretch, \xe2\x80\x98is not peace much better than such a war as\r\nthat? I will restore you to liberty this moment; I will proclaim you a\r\npiece of immaculate virtue; I will name you the Lucretia of England.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And I will say that you are the Sextus. I will denounce you before\r\nmen, as I have denounced you before God; and if it be necessary that,\r\nlike Lucretia, I should sign my accusation with my blood, I will sign\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said my enemy, in a jeering tone, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s quite another thing.\r\nMy faith! everything considered, you are very well off here. You shall\r\nwant for nothing, and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be\r\nyour own fault.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt these words he retired. I heard the door open and shut, and I\r\nremained overwhelmed, less, I confess it, by my grief than by the\r\nmortification of not having avenged myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe kept his word. All the day, all the next night passed away without\r\nmy seeing him again. But I also kept my word with him, and I neither\r\nate nor drank. I was, as I told him, resolved to die of hunger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI passed the day and the night in prayer, for I hoped that God would\r\npardon me my suicide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe second night the door opened; I was lying on the floor, for my\r\nstrength began to abandon me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the noise I raised myself up on one hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said a voice which vibrated in too terrible a manner in my ear\r\nnot to be recognized, \xe2\x80\x98well! Are we softened a little? Will we not pay\r\nfor our liberty with a single promise of silence? Come, I am a good\r\nsort of a prince,\xe2\x80\x99 added he, \xe2\x80\x98and although I like not Puritans I do\r\nthem justice; and it is the same with Puritanesses, when they are\r\npretty. Come, take a little oath for me on the cross; I won\xe2\x80\x99t ask\r\nanything more of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98On the cross,\xe2\x80\x99 cried I, rising, for at that abhorred voice I had\r\nrecovered all my strength, \xe2\x80\x98on the cross I swear that no promise, no\r\nmenace, no force, no torture, shall close my mouth! On the cross I\r\nswear to denounce you everywhere as a murderer, as a thief of honor, as\r\na base coward! On the cross I swear, if I ever leave this place, to\r\ncall down vengeance upon you from the whole human race!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Beware!\xe2\x80\x99 said the voice, in a threatening accent that I had never yet\r\nheard. \xe2\x80\x98I have an extraordinary means which I will not employ but in\r\nthe last extremity to close your mouth, or at least to prevent anyone\r\nfrom believing a word you may utter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe saw that it was a merciless war between us\xe2\x80\x94a war to the death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Listen!\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98I give you the rest of tonight and all day\r\ntomorrow. Reflect: promise to be silent, and riches, consideration,\r\neven honor, shall surround you; threaten to speak, and I will condemn\r\nyou to infamy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You?\xe2\x80\x99 cried I. \xe2\x80\x98You?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98To interminable, ineffaceable infamy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated I. Oh, I declare to you, Felton, I thought him mad!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, I!\xe2\x80\x99 replied he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oh, leave me!\xe2\x80\x99 said I. \xe2\x80\x98Begone, if you do not desire to see me dash\r\nmy head against that wall before your eyes!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Very well, it is your own doing. Till tomorrow evening, then!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Till tomorrow evening, then!\xe2\x80\x99 replied I, allowing myself to fall, and\r\nbiting the carpet with rage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture; and Milady saw,\r\nwith the joy of a demon, that his strength would fail him perhaps\r\nbefore the end of her recital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVII.\r\nMEANS FOR CLASSICAL TRAGEDY\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a moment of silence employed by Milady in observing the young man\r\nwho listened to her, Milady continued her recital.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was nearly three days since I had eaten or drunk anything. I\r\nsuffered frightful torments. At times there passed before me clouds\r\nwhich pressed my brow, which veiled my eyes; this was delirium.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the evening came I was so weak that every time I fainted I\r\nthanked God, for I thought I was about to die.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the midst of one of these swoons I heard the door open. Terror\r\nrecalled me to myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask. He was masked\r\nlikewise; but I knew his step, I knew his voice, I knew him by that\r\nimposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse\r\nof humanity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said he to me, \xe2\x80\x98have you made your mind up to take the oath I\r\nrequested of you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You have said Puritans have but one word. Mine you have heard, and\r\nthat is to pursue you\xe2\x80\x94on earth to the tribunal of men, in heaven to the\r\ntribunal of God.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You persist, then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I swear it before the God who hears me. I will take the whole world\r\nas a witness of your crime, and that until I have found an avenger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You are a prostitute,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, in a voice of thunder, \xe2\x80\x98and you shall\r\nundergo the punishment of prostitutes! Branded in the eyes of the world\r\nyou invoke, try to prove to that world that you are neither guilty nor\r\nmad!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, addressing the man who accompanied him, \xe2\x80\x98Executioner,\xe2\x80\x99 said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98do your duty.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, his name, his name!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felton. \xe2\x80\x9cHis name, tell it me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen in spite of my cries, in spite of my resistance\xe2\x80\x94for I began to\r\ncomprehend that there was a question of something worse than death\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nexecutioner seized me, threw me on the floor, fastened me with his\r\nbonds, and suffocated by sobs, almost without sense, invoking God, who\r\ndid not listen to me, I uttered all at once a frightful cry of pain and\r\nshame. A burning fire, a red-hot iron, the iron of the executioner, was\r\nimprinted on my shoulder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton uttered a groan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, rising with the majesty of a queen, \xe2\x80\x9chere, Felton,\r\nbehold the new martyrdom invented for a pure young girl, the victim of\r\nthe brutality of a villain. Learn to know the heart of men, and\r\nhenceforth make yourself less easily the instrument of their unjust\r\nvengeance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady, with a rapid gesture, opened her robe, tore the cambric that\r\ncovered her bosom, and red with feigned anger and simulated shame,\r\nshowed the young man the ineffaceable impression which dishonored that\r\nbeautiful shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is a _fleur-de-lis_ which I see there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd therein consisted the infamy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady. \xe2\x80\x9cThe brand of\r\nEngland!\xe2\x80\x94it would be necessary to prove what tribunal had imposed it on\r\nme, and I could have made a public appeal to all the tribunals of the\r\nkingdom; but the brand of France!\xe2\x80\x94oh, by that, by _that_ I was branded\r\nindeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was too much for Felton.\r\n\r\nPale, motionless, overwhelmed by this frightful revelation, dazzled by\r\nthe superhuman beauty of this woman who unveiled herself before him\r\nwith an immodesty which appeared to him sublime, he ended by falling on\r\nhis knees before her as the early Christians did before those pure and\r\nholy martyrs whom the persecution of the emperors gave up in the circus\r\nto the sanguinary sensuality of the populace. The brand disappeared;\r\nthe beauty alone remained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon! Pardon!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felton, \xe2\x80\x9coh, pardon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady read in his eyes _love! love!_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon for what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me for having joined with your persecutors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady held out her hand to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo beautiful! so young!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felton, covering that hand with his\r\nkisses.\r\n\r\nMilady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a\r\nking.\r\n\r\nFelton was a Puritan; he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nHe no longer loved her; he adored her.\r\n\r\nWhen this crisis was past, when Milady appeared to have resumed her\r\nself-possession, which she had never lost; when Felton had seen her\r\nrecover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were\r\nonly concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently, he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, now! I have only one thing to ask of you; that is, the name\r\nof your true executioner. For to me there is but one; the other was an\r\ninstrument, that was all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, brother!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cmust I name him again? Have you not yet\r\ndivined who he is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felton, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x94again he\xe2\x80\x94always he? What\xe2\x80\x94the truly guilty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truly guilty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cis the ravager of England, the\r\npersecutor of true believers, the base ravisher of the honor of so many\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94he who, to satisfy a caprice of his corrupt heart, is about to\r\nmake England shed so much blood, who protects the Protestants today and\r\nwill betray them tomorrow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuckingham! It is, then, Buckingham!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felton, in a high state of\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nMilady concealed her face in her hands, as if she could not endure the\r\nshame which this name recalled to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuckingham, the executioner of this angelic creature!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felton.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou hast not hurled thy thunder at him, my God! And thou hast\r\nleft him noble, honored, powerful, for the ruin of us all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod abandons him who abandons himself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the\r\ndamned!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, with increasing exultation. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wills that human\r\nvengeance should precede celestial justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMen fear him and spare him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not fear him, nor will I spare him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soul of Milady was bathed in an infernal joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can Lord de Winter, my protector, my father,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Felton,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpossibly be mixed up with all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Felton,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cfor by the side of base and\r\ncontemptible men there are often found great and generous natures. I\r\nhad an affianced husband, a man whom I loved, and who loved me\xe2\x80\x94a heart\r\nlike yours, Felton, a man like you. I went to him and told him all; he\r\nknew me, that man did, and did not doubt an instant. He was a nobleman,\r\na man equal to Buckingham in every respect. He said nothing; he only\r\ngirded on his sword, wrapped himself in his cloak, and went straight to\r\nBuckingham Palace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton; \xe2\x80\x9cI understand how he would act. But with such\r\nmen it is not the sword that should be employed; it is the poniard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuckingham had left England the day before, sent as ambassador to\r\nSpain, to demand the hand of the Infanta for King Charles I., who was\r\nthen only Prince of Wales. My affianced husband returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Hear me,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98this man has gone, and for the moment has\r\nconsequently escaped my vengeance; but let us be united, as we were to\r\nhave been, and then leave it to Lord de Winter to maintain his own\r\nhonor and that of his wife.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord de Winter!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cLord de Winter; and now you can understand it all,\r\ncan you not? Buckingham remained nearly a year absent. A week before\r\nhis return Lord de Winter died, leaving me his sole heir. Whence came\r\nthe blow? God who knows all, knows without doubt; but as for me, I\r\naccuse nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what an abyss; what an abyss!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord de Winter died without revealing anything to his brother. The\r\nterrible secret was to be concealed till it burst, like a clap of\r\nthunder, over the head of the guilty. Your protector had seen with pain\r\nthis marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl. I was\r\nsensible that I could look for no support from a man disappointed in\r\nhis hopes of an inheritance. I went to France, with a determination to\r\nremain there for the rest of my life. But all my fortune is in England.\r\nCommunication being closed by the war, I was in want of everything. I\r\nwas then obliged to come back again. Six days ago, I landed at\r\nPortsmouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; Buckingham heard by some means, no doubt, of my return. He spoke\r\nof me to Lord de Winter, already prejudiced against me, and told him\r\nthat his sister-in-law was a prostitute, a branded woman. The noble and\r\npure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend me. Lord de\r\nWinter believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that\r\nit was his interest to believe it. He caused me to be arrested, had me\r\nconducted hither, and placed me under your guard. You know the rest.\r\nThe day after tomorrow he banishes me, he transports me; the day after\r\ntomorrow he exiles me among the infamous. Oh, the train is well laid;\r\nthe plot is clever. My honor will not survive it! You see, then,\r\nFelton, I can do nothing but die. Felton, give me that knife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd at these words, as if all her strength was exhausted, Milady sank,\r\nweak and languishing, into the arms of the young officer, who,\r\nintoxicated with love, anger, and voluptuous sensations hitherto\r\nunknown, received her with transport, pressed her against his heart,\r\nall trembling at the breath from that charming mouth, bewildered by the\r\ncontact with that palpitating bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, you shall live honored and pure; you shall live\r\nto triumph over your enemies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady put him from her slowly with her hand, while drawing him nearer\r\nwith her look; but Felton, in his turn, embraced her more closely,\r\nimploring her like a divinity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, death, death!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, lowering her voice and her eyelids, \xe2\x80\x9coh,\r\ndeath, rather than shame! Felton, my brother, my friend, I conjure\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cno; you shall live and you shall be avenged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFelton, I bring misfortune to all who surround me! Felton, abandon me!\r\nFelton, let me die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, we will live and die together!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, pressing his\r\nlips to those of the prisoner.\r\n\r\nSeveral strokes resounded on the door; this time Milady really pushed\r\nhim away from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have been overheard! Someone is coming! All is\r\nover! We are lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton; it is only the sentinel warning me that they are\r\nabout to change the guard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen run to the door, and open it yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton obeyed; this woman was now his whole thought, his whole soul.\r\n\r\nHe found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a\r\nwatch-patrol.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou told me to open the door if I heard anyone cry out,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nsoldier; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you forgot to leave me the key. I heard you cry out,\r\nwithout understanding what you said. I tried to open the door, but it\r\nwas locked inside; then I called the sergeant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant.\r\n\r\nFelton, quite bewildered, almost mad, stood speechless.\r\n\r\nMilady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the\r\nscene. She ran to the table, and seizing the knife which Felton had\r\nlaid down, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd by what right will you prevent me from\r\ndying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat God!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Felton, on seeing the knife glitter in her hand.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the\r\ncorridor. The baron, attracted by the noise, in his chamber gown, his\r\nsword under his arm, stood in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9chere we are, at the last act of the tragedy. You see,\r\nFelton, the drama has gone through all the phases I named; but be easy,\r\nno blood will flow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady perceived that all was lost unless she gave Felton an immediate\r\nand terrible proof of her courage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken, my Lord, blood will flow; and may that blood fall\r\nback on those who cause it to flow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton uttered a cry, and rushed toward her. He was too late; Milady\r\nhad stabbed herself.\r\n\r\nBut the knife had fortunately, we ought to say skillfully, come in\r\ncontact with the steel busk, which at that period, like a cuirass,\r\ndefended the chests of women. It had glided down it, tearing the robe,\r\nand had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the ribs. Milady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrobe was not the less stained with blood in a second.\r\n\r\nMilady fell down, and seemed to be in a swoon.\r\n\r\nFelton snatched away the knife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in a deep, gloomy tone, \xe2\x80\x9chere is a woman who\r\nwas under my guard, and who has killed herself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe at ease, Felton,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord de Winter. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is not dead; demons do\r\nnot die so easily. Be tranquil, and go wait for me in my chamber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my Lord\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, sir, I command you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this injunction from his superior, Felton obeyed; but in going out,\r\nhe put the knife into his bosom.\r\n\r\nAs to Lord de Winter, he contented himself with calling the woman who\r\nwaited on Milady, and when she was come, he recommended the prisoner,\r\nwho was still fainting, to her care, and left them alone.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions, as\r\nthe wound might be serious, he immediately sent off a mounted man to\r\nfind a physician.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVIII.\r\nESCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Lord de Winter had thought, Milady\xe2\x80\x99s wound was not dangerous. So\r\nsoon as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned\r\nto her assistance she opened her eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, necessary to affect weakness and pain\xe2\x80\x94not a very\r\ndifficult task for so finished an actress as Milady. Thus the poor\r\nwoman was completely the dupe of the prisoner, whom, notwithstanding\r\nher hints, she persisted in watching all night.\r\n\r\nBut the presence of this woman did not prevent Milady from thinking.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer a doubt that Felton was convinced; Felton was hers.\r\nIf an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of Milady, he\r\nwould take him, in the mental disposition in which he now found\r\nhimself, for a messenger sent by the devil.\r\n\r\nMilady smiled at this thought, for Felton was now her only hope\xe2\x80\x94her\r\nonly means of safety.\r\n\r\nBut Lord de Winter might suspect him; Felton himself might now be\r\nwatched!\r\n\r\nToward four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning the doctor arrived; but since the\r\ntime Milady stabbed herself, however short, the wound had closed. The\r\ndoctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of\r\nit; he only satisfied himself by Milady\xe2\x80\x99s pulse that the case was not\r\nserious.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Milady, under the pretext that she had not slept well in\r\nthe night and wanted rest, sent away the woman who attended her.\r\n\r\nShe had one hope, which was that Felton would appear at the breakfast\r\nhour; but Felton did not come.\r\n\r\nWere her fears realized? Was Felton, suspected by the baron, about to\r\nfail her at the decisive moment? She had only one day left. Lord de\r\nWinter had announced her embarkation for the twenty-third, and it was\r\nnow the morning of the twenty-second.\r\n\r\nNevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner.\r\n\r\nAlthough she had eaten nothing in the morning, the dinner was brought\r\nin at its usual time. Milady then perceived, with terror, that the\r\nuniform of the soldiers who guarded her was changed.\r\n\r\nThen she ventured to ask what had become of Felton.\r\n\r\nShe was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horseback.\r\nShe inquired if the baron was still at the castle. The soldier replied\r\nthat he was, and that he had given orders to be informed if the\r\nprisoner wished to speak to him.\r\n\r\nMilady replied that she was too weak at present, and that her only\r\ndesire was to be left alone.\r\n\r\nThe soldier went out, leaving the dinner served.\r\n\r\nFelton was sent away. The marines were removed. Felton was then\r\nmistrusted.\r\n\r\nThis was the last blow to the prisoner.\r\n\r\nLeft alone, she arose. The bed, which she had kept from prudence and\r\nthat they might believe her seriously wounded, burned her like a bed of\r\nfire. She cast a glance at the door; the baron had had a plank nailed\r\nover the grating. He no doubt feared that by this opening she might\r\nstill by some diabolical means corrupt her guards.\r\n\r\nMilady smiled with joy. She was free now to give way to her transports\r\nwithout being observed. She traversed her chamber with the excitement\r\nof a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage. _Certes_,\r\nif the knife had been left in her power, she would now have thought,\r\nnot of killing herself, but of killing the baron.\r\n\r\nAt six o\xe2\x80\x99clock Lord de Winter came in. He was armed at all points. This\r\nman, in whom Milady till that time had only seen a very simple\r\ngentleman, had become an admirable jailer. He appeared to foresee all,\r\nto divine all, to anticipate all.\r\n\r\nA single look at Milady apprised him of all that was passing in her\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI see; but you shall not kill me today. You have no\r\nlonger a weapon; and besides, I am on my guard. You had begun to\r\npervert my poor Felton. He was yielding to your infernal influence; but\r\nI will save him. He will never see you again; all is over. Get your\r\nclothes together. Tomorrow you will go. I had fixed the embarkation for\r\nthe twenty-fourth; but I have reflected that the more promptly the\r\naffair takes place the more sure it will be. Tomorrow, by twelve\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, I shall have the order for your exile, signed, _Buckingham_.\r\nIf you speak a single word to anyone before going aboard ship, my\r\nsergeant will blow your brains out. He has orders to do so. If when on\r\nthe ship you speak a single word to anyone before the captain permits\r\nyou, the captain will have you thrown into the sea. That is agreed\r\nupon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Au revoir_, then; that is all I have to say today. Tomorrow I will\r\nsee you again, to take my leave.\xe2\x80\x9d With these words the baron went out.\r\nMilady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain\r\non her lips, but rage in her heart.\r\n\r\nSupper was served. Milady felt that she stood in need of all her\r\nstrength. She did not know what might take place during this night\r\nwhich approached so menacingly\xe2\x80\x94for large masses of cloud rolled over\r\nthe face of the sky, and distant lightning announced a storm.\r\n\r\nThe storm broke about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Milady felt a consolation in seeing\r\nnature partake of the disorder of her heart. The thunder growled in the\r\nair like the passion and anger in her thoughts. It appeared to her that\r\nthe blast as it swept along disheveled her brow, as it bowed the\r\nbranches of the trees and bore away their leaves. She howled as the\r\nhurricane howled; and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature,\r\nwhich also seemed to groan with despair.\r\n\r\nAll at once she heard a tap at her window, and by the help of a flash\r\nof lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars.\r\n\r\nShe ran to the window and opened it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFelton!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she. \xe2\x80\x9cI am saved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton; \xe2\x80\x9cbut silence, silence! I must have time to file\r\nthrough these bars. Only take care that I am not seen through the\r\nwicket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is a proof that the Lord is on our side, Felton,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nMilady. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have closed up the grating with a board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well; God has made them senseless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what must I do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, nothing, only shut the window. Go to bed, or at least lie\r\ndown in your clothes. As soon as I have done I will knock on one of the\r\npanes of glass. But will you be able to follow me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour wound?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGives me pain, but will not prevent my walking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe ready, then, at the first signal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady shut the window, extinguished the lamp, and went, as Felton had\r\ndesired her, to lie down on the bed. Amid the moaning of the storm she\r\nheard the grinding of the file upon the bars, and by the light of every\r\nflash she perceived the shadow of Felton through the panes.\r\n\r\nShe passed an hour without breathing, panting, with a cold sweat upon\r\nher brow, and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement\r\nshe heard in the corridor.\r\n\r\nThere are hours which last a year.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of an hour, Felton tapped again.\r\n\r\nMilady sprang out of bed and opened the window. Two bars removed formed\r\nan opening for a man to pass through.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Felton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Must I take anything with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney, if you have any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; fortunately they have left me all I had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better, for I have expended all mine in chartering a\r\nvessel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, placing a bag full of louis in Felton\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\n\r\nFelton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body\r\nthrough the window. She saw the young officer suspended over the abyss\r\nby a ladder of ropes. For the first time an emotion of terror reminded\r\nher that she was a woman.\r\n\r\nThe dark space frightened her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expected this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady. \xe2\x80\x9cI will descend with my eyes\r\nshut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you confidence in me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ask that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut your two hands together. Cross them; that\xe2\x80\x99s right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief, and then\r\nwith a cord over the handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady, with surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPass your arms around my neck, and fear nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I shall make you lose your balance, and we shall both be dashed to\r\npieces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid. I am a sailor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot a second was to be lost. Milady passed her two arms round Felton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneck, and let herself slip out of the window. Felton began to descend\r\nthe ladder slowly, step by step. Despite the weight of two bodies, the\r\nblast of the hurricane shook them in the air.\r\n\r\nAll at once Felton stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cI hear footsteps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are discovered!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a silence of several seconds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cit is nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what, then, is the noise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat of the patrol going their rounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is their road?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust under us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will discover us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, if it does not lighten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they will run against the bottom of the ladder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFortunately it is too short by six feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere they are! My God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth remained suspended, motionless and breathless, within twenty paces\r\nof the ground, while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and\r\ntalking. This was a terrible moment for the fugitives.\r\n\r\nThe patrol passed. The noise of their retreating footsteps and the\r\nmurmur of their voices soon died away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady breathed a deep sigh and fainted.\r\n\r\nFelton continued to descend. Near the bottom of the ladder, when he\r\nfound no more support for his feet, he clung with his hands; at length,\r\narrived at the last step, he let himself hang by the strength of his\r\nwrists, and touched the ground. He stooped down, picked up the bag of\r\nmoney, and placed it between his teeth. Then he took Milady in his\r\narms, and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the\r\npatrol had taken. He soon left the pathway of the patrol, descended\r\nacross the rocks, and when arrived on the edge of the sea, whistled.\r\n\r\nA similar signal replied to him; and five minutes after, a boat\r\nappeared, rowed by four men.\r\n\r\nThe boat approached as near as it could to the shore; but there was not\r\ndepth enough of water for it to touch land. Felton walked into the sea\r\nup to his middle, being unwilling to trust his precious burden to\r\nanybody.\r\n\r\nFortunately the storm began to subside, but still the sea was\r\ndisturbed. The little boat bounded over the waves like a nut-shell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the sloop,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cand row quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe four men bent to their oars, but the sea was too high to let them\r\nget much hold of it.\r\n\r\nHowever, they left the castle behind; that was the principal thing. The\r\nnight was extremely dark. It was almost impossible to see the shore\r\nfrom the boat; they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\nA black point floated on the sea. That was the sloop. While the boat\r\nwas advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it, Felton\r\nuntied the cord and then the handkerchief which bound Milady\xe2\x80\x99s hands\r\ntogether. When her hands were loosed he took some sea water and\r\nsprinkled it over her face.\r\n\r\nMilady breathed a sigh, and opened her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaved!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, saved, saved!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, there is the sky; here is the sea!\r\nThe air I breathe is the air of liberty! Ah, thanks, Felton, thanks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man pressed her to his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is the matter with my hands!\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cit seems as if\r\nmy wrists had been crushed in a vice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady held out her arms; her wrists were bruised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, looking at those beautiful hands, and shaking his\r\nhead sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady looked around her, as if in search of something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, touching the bag of money with his foot.\r\n\r\nThey drew near to the sloop. A sailor on watch hailed the boat; the\r\nboat replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat vessel is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one I have hired for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere will it take me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you please, after you have put me on shore at Portsmouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do at Portsmouth?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccomplish the orders of Lord de Winter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, with a gloomy\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat orders?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not understand?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Felton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; explain yourself, I beg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs he mistrusted me, he determined to guard you himself, and sent me\r\nin his place to get Buckingham to sign the order for your\r\ntransportation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if he mistrusted you, how could he confide such an order to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I know what I was the bearer of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true! And you are going to Portsmouth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no time to lose. Tomorrow is the twenty-third, and Buckingham\r\nsets sail tomorrow with his fleet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe sets sail tomorrow! Where for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor La Rochelle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe need not sail!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, forgetting her usual presence of\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Felton; \xe2\x80\x9che will not sail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady started with joy. She could read to the depths of the heart of\r\nthis young man; the death of Buckingham was written there at full\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFelton,\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are as great as Judas Maccabeus! If you die,\r\nI will die with you; that is all I can say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Felton; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, they touched the sloop.\r\n\r\nFelton mounted the ladder first, and gave his hand to Milady, while the\r\nsailors supported her, for the sea was still much agitated.\r\n\r\nAn instant after they were on the deck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is the person of whom I spoke to you, and\r\nwhom you must convey safe and sound to France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a thousand pistoles,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have paid you five hundred of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s correct,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here are the other five hundred,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady, placing her hand\r\nupon the bag of gold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cI make but one bargain; and I have agreed with\r\nthis young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till\r\nwe arrive at Boulogne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd shall we arrive there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSafe and sound, as true as my name\xe2\x80\x99s Jack Butler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cif you keep your word, instead of five hundred, I\r\nwill give you a thousand pistoles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah for you, then, my beautiful lady,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the captain; \xe2\x80\x9cand may\r\nGod often send me such passengers as your Ladyship!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cconvey me to the little bay of\xe2\x80\x94; you know it\r\nwas agreed you should put in there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers, and toward\r\nseven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay\r\nthat had been named.\r\n\r\nDuring this passage, Felton related everything to Milady\xe2\x80\x94how, instead\r\nof going to London, he had chartered the little vessel; how he had\r\nreturned; how he had scaled the wall by fastening cramps in the\r\ninterstices of the stones, as he ascended, to give him foothold; and\r\nhow, when he had reached the bars, he fastened his ladder. Milady knew\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nOn her side, Milady tried to encourage Felton in his project; but at\r\nthe first words which issued from her mouth, she plainly saw that the\r\nyoung fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that Milady should wait for Felton till ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock; if\r\nhe did not return by ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock she was to sail.\r\n\r\nIn that case, and supposing he was at liberty, he was to rejoin her in\r\nFrance, at the convent of the Carmelites at B\xc3\xa9thune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIX.\r\nWHAT TOOK PLACE AT PORTSMOUTH\r\nAUGUST 23, 1628\r\n\r\n\r\nFelton took leave of Milady as a brother about to go for a mere walk\r\ntakes leave of his sister, kissing her hand.\r\n\r\nHis whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness, only an\r\nunusual fire beamed from his eyes, like the effects of a fever; his\r\nbrow was more pale than it generally was; his teeth were clenched, and\r\nhis speech had a short dry accent which indicated that something dark\r\nwas at work within him.\r\n\r\nAs long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land, he kept\r\nhis face toward Milady, who, standing on the deck, followed him with\r\nher eyes. Both were free from the fear of pursuit; nobody ever came\r\ninto Milady\xe2\x80\x99s apartment before nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and it would require three\r\nhours to go from the castle to London.\r\n\r\nFelton jumped onshore, climbed the little ascent which led to the top\r\nof the cliff, saluted Milady a last time, and took his course toward\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a hundred paces, the ground began to decline, and he\r\ncould only see the mast of the sloop.\r\n\r\nHe immediately ran in the direction of Portsmouth, which he saw at\r\nnearly half a league before him, standing out in the haze of the\r\nmorning, with its houses and towers.\r\n\r\nBeyond Portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts, like a\r\nforest of poplars despoiled by the winter, bent with each breath of the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nFelton, in his rapid walk, reviewed in his mind all the accusations\r\nagainst the favorite of James I. and Charles I., furnished by two years\r\nof premature meditation and a long sojourn among the Puritans.\r\n\r\nWhen he compared the public crimes of this minister\xe2\x80\x94startling crimes,\r\nEuropean crimes, if so we may say\xe2\x80\x94with the private and unknown crimes\r\nwith which Milady had charged him, Felton found that the more culpable\r\nof the two men which formed the character of Buckingham was the one of\r\nwhom the public knew not the life. This was because his love, so\r\nstrange, so new, and so ardent, made him view the infamous and\r\nimaginary accusations of Milady de Winter as, through a magnifying\r\nglass, one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible\r\nby the side of an ant.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more; the idea that he\r\nleft behind him, exposed to a frightful vengeance, the woman he loved,\r\nor rather whom he adored as a saint, the emotion he had experienced,\r\npresent fatigue\xe2\x80\x94all together exalted his mind above human feeling.\r\n\r\nHe entered Portsmouth about eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. The whole\r\npopulation was on foot; drums were beating in the streets and in the\r\nport; the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea.\r\n\r\nFelton arrived at the palace of the Admiralty, covered with dust, and\r\nstreaming with perspiration. His countenance, usually so pale, was\r\npurple with heat and passion. The sentinel wanted to repulse him; but\r\nFelton called to the officer of the post, and drawing from his pocket\r\nthe letter of which he was the bearer, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cA pressing message\r\nfrom Lord de Winter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the name of Lord de Winter, who was known to be one of his Grace\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmost intimate friends, the officer of the post gave orders to let\r\nFelton pass, who, besides, wore the uniform of a naval officer.\r\n\r\nFelton darted into the palace.\r\n\r\nAt the moment he entered the vestibule, another man was entering\r\nlikewise, dusty, out of breath, leaving at the gate a post horse,\r\nwhich, on reaching the palace, tumbled on his foreknees.\r\n\r\nFelton and he addressed Patrick, the duke\xe2\x80\x99s confidential lackey, at the\r\nsame moment. Felton named Lord de Winter; the unknown would not name\r\nanybody, and pretended that it was to the duke alone he would make\r\nhimself known. Each was anxious to gain admission before the other.\r\n\r\nPatrick, who knew Lord de Winter was in affairs of the service, and in\r\nrelations of friendship with the duke, gave the preference to the one\r\nwho came in his name. The other was forced to wait, and it was easily\r\nto be seen how he cursed the delay.\r\n\r\nThe valet led Felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies\r\nfrom La Rochelle, headed by the Prince de Soubise, and introduced him\r\ninto a closet where Buckingham, just out of the bath, was finishing his\r\ntoilet, upon which, as at all times, he bestowed extraordinary\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant Felton, from Lord de Winter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Lord de Winter!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Buckingham; \xe2\x80\x9clet him come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton entered. At that moment Buckingham was throwing upon a couch a\r\nrich toilet robe, worked with gold, in order to put on a blue velvet\r\ndoublet embroidered with pearls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t the baron come himself?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Buckingham. \xe2\x80\x9cI expected\r\nhim this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe desired me to tell your Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he very much\r\nregretted not having that honor, but that he was prevented by the guard\r\nhe is obliged to keep at the castle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham; \xe2\x80\x9che has a prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is of that prisoner that I wish to speak to your Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nFelton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat which I have to say of her can only be heard by yourself, my\r\nLord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave us, Patrick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham; \xe2\x80\x9cbut remain within sound of the\r\nbell. I shall call you presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPatrick went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are alone, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham; \xe2\x80\x9cspeak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Baron de Winter wrote to you the other day\r\nto request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young\r\nwoman named Charlotte Backson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; and I answered him, to bring or send me that order and I\r\nwould sign it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is, my Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke.\r\n\r\nAnd taking it from Felton, he cast a rapid glance over the paper, and\r\nperceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him, he\r\nplaced it on the table, took a pen, and prepared to sign it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, stopping the duke; \xe2\x80\x9cbut does your Grace\r\nknow that the name of Charlotte Backson is not the true name of this\r\nyoung woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, I know it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the duke, dipping the quill in the ink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen your Grace knows her real name?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Felton, in a sharp tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x9d; and the duke put the quill to the paper. Felton grew pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd knowing that real name, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Felton, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you sign\r\nit all the same?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham, \xe2\x80\x9cand rather twice than once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot believe,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Felton, in a voice that became more sharp\r\nand rough, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your Grace knows that it is to Milady de Winter this\r\nrelates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it perfectly, although I am astonished that you know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will your Grace sign that order without remorse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBuckingham looked at the young man haughtily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, sir, that you are asking me very strange questions, and\r\nthat I am very foolish to answer them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReply to them, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton; \xe2\x80\x9cthe circumstances are more\r\nserious than you perhaps believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBuckingham reflected that the young man, coming from Lord de Winter,\r\nundoubtedly spoke in his name, and softened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout remorse,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThe baron knows, as well as myself, that\r\nMilady de Winter is a very guilty woman, and it is treating her very\r\nfavorably to commute her punishment to transportation.\xe2\x80\x9d The duke put\r\nhis pen to the paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not sign that order, my Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, making a step\r\ntoward the duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not sign this order! And why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you will look into yourself, and you will do justice to the\r\nlady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should do her justice by sending her to Tyburn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis lady is infamous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord, Milady de Winter is an angel; you know that she is, and I\r\ndemand her liberty of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah! Are you mad, to talk to me thus?\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord, excuse me! I speak as I can; I restrain myself. But, my Lord,\r\nthink of what you\xe2\x80\x99re about to do, and beware of going too far!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say? God pardon me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Buckingham, \xe2\x80\x9cI really think he\r\nthreatens me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my Lord, I still plead. And I say to you: one drop of water\r\nsuffices to make the full vase overflow; one slight fault may draw down\r\npunishment upon the head spared, despite many crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Felton,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will withdraw, and place yourself\r\nat once under arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will hear me to the end, my Lord. You have seduced this young\r\ngirl; you have outraged, defiled her. Repair your crimes toward her;\r\nlet her go free, and I will exact nothing else from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will exact!\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham, looking at Felton with astonishment,\r\nand dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Felton, becoming more excited as he spoke, \xe2\x80\x9cmy\r\nLord, beware! All England is tired of your iniquities; my Lord, you\r\nhave abused the royal power, which you have almost usurped; my Lord,\r\nyou are held in horror by God and men. God will punish you hereafter,\r\nbut I will punish you here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, this is too much!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Buckingham, making a step toward the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nFelton barred his passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask it humbly of you, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9csign the order for the\r\nliberation of Milady de Winter. Remember that she is a woman whom you\r\nhave dishonored.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithdraw, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham, \xe2\x80\x9cor I will call my attendant, and\r\nhave you placed in irons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall not call,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton, throwing himself between the duke\r\nand the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver. \xe2\x80\x9cBeware, my Lord,\r\nyou are in the hands of God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the hands of the devil, you mean!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Buckingham, raising his\r\nvoice so as to attract the notice of his people, without absolutely\r\nshouting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSign, my Lord; sign the liberation of Milady de Winter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Felton,\r\nholding out a paper to the duke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy force? You are joking! Holloa, Patrick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSign, my Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the duke; and at the same time he sprang toward his\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nBut Felton did not give him time to draw it. He held the knife with\r\nwhich Milady had stabbed herself, open in his bosom; at one bound he\r\nwas upon the duke.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Patrick entered the room, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cA letter from France,\r\nmy Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom France!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Buckingham, forgetting everything in thinking from\r\nwhom that letter came.\r\n\r\nFelton took advantage of this moment, and plunged the knife into his\r\nside up to the handle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, traitor,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Buckingham, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have killed me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMurder!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Patrick.\r\n\r\nFelton cast his eyes round for means of escape, and seeing the door\r\nfree, he rushed into the next chamber, in which, as we have said, the\r\ndeputies from La Rochelle were waiting, crossed it as quickly as\r\npossible, and rushed toward the staircase; but upon the first step he\r\nmet Lord de Winter, who, seeing him pale, confused, livid, and stained\r\nwith blood both on his hands and face, seized him by the throat,\r\ncrying, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew it! I guessed it! But too late by a minute,\r\nunfortunate, unfortunate that I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton made no resistance. Lord de Winter placed him in the hands of\r\nthe guards, who led him, while awaiting further orders, to a little\r\nterrace commanding the sea; and then the baron hastened to the duke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nAt the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of Patrick, the man whom\r\nFelton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber.\r\n\r\nHe found the duke reclining upon a sofa, with his hand pressed upon the\r\nwound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaporte,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke, in a dying voice, \xe2\x80\x9cLaporte, do you come from\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the faithful cloak bearer of Anne of\r\nAustria, \xe2\x80\x9cbut too late, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence, Laporte, you may be overheard. Patrick, let no one enter. Oh,\r\nI cannot tell what she says to me! My God, I am dying!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the duke swooned.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Lord de Winter, the deputies, the leaders of the expedition,\r\nthe officers of Buckingham\xe2\x80\x99s household, had all made their way into the\r\nchamber. Cries of despair resounded on all sides. The news, which\r\nfilled the palace with tears and groans, soon became known, and spread\r\nitself throughout the city.\r\n\r\nThe report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nLord de Winter tore his hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo late by a minute!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9ctoo late by a minute! Oh, my God, my\r\nGod! what a misfortune!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had been informed at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning that a rope ladder\r\nfloated from one of the windows of the castle; he had hastened to\r\nMilady\xe2\x80\x99s chamber, had found it empty, the window open, and the bars\r\nfiled, had remembered the verbal caution D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had transmitted to\r\nhim by his messenger, had trembled for the duke, and running to the\r\nstable without taking time to have a horse saddled, had jumped upon the\r\nfirst he found, had galloped off like the wind, had alighted below in\r\nthe courtyard, had ascended the stairs precipitately, and on the top\r\nstep, as we have said, had encountered Felton.\r\n\r\nThe duke, however, was not dead. He recovered a little, reopened his\r\neyes, and hope revived in all hearts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cleave me alone with Patrick and Laporte\xe2\x80\x94ah, is\r\nthat you, De Winter? You sent me a strange madman this morning! See the\r\nstate in which he has put me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the baron, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never console myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you would be quite wrong, my dear De Winter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham,\r\nholding out his hand to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know the man who deserves being\r\nregretted during the whole life of another man; but leave us, I pray\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe baron went out sobbing.\r\n\r\nThere only remained in the closet of the wounded duke Laporte and\r\nPatrick. A physician was sought for, but none was yet found.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will live, my Lord, you will live!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the faithful servant\r\nof Anne of Austria, on his knees before the duke\xe2\x80\x99s sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has she written to me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham, feebly, streaming with\r\nblood, and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat has\r\nshe written to me? Read me her letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d said Laporte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObey, Laporte, do you not see I have no time to lose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaporte broke the seal, and placed the paper before the eyes of the\r\nduke; but Buckingham in vain tried to make out the writing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cread! I cannot see. Read, then! For soon, perhaps, I\r\nshall not hear, and I shall die without knowing what she has written to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaporte made no further objection, and read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY LORD, By that which, since I have known you, have suffered by you\r\nand for you, I conjure you, if you have any care for my repose, to\r\ncountermand those great armaments which you are preparing against\r\nFrance, to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is\r\nthe ostensible cause, and of which, it is generally whispered, your\r\nlove for me is the concealed cause. This war may not only bring great\r\ncatastrophes upon England and France, but misfortune upon you, my Lord,\r\nfor which I should never console myself.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBe careful of your life, which is menaced, and which will be dear\r\n    to me from the moment I am not obliged to see an enemy in you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour affectionate\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cANNE\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBuckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the\r\nreading of the letter; then, when it was ended, as if he had met with a\r\nbitter disappointment, he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you nothing else to say to me by\r\nthe living voice, Laporte?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself, for she had\r\nadvice that your assassination would be attempted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is that all\xe2\x80\x94is that all?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Buckingham, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham, \xe2\x80\x9cGod be praised! My death, then, will not be to\r\nher as the death of a stranger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaporte burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatrick,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke, \xe2\x80\x9cbring me the casket in which the diamond\r\nstuds were kept.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPatrick brought the object desired, which Laporte recognized as having\r\nbelonged to the queen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow the scent bag of white satin, on which her cipher is embroidered\r\nin pearls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPatrick again obeyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Laporte,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buckingham, \xe2\x80\x9cthese are the only tokens I ever\r\nreceived from her\xe2\x80\x94this silver casket and these two letters. You will\r\nrestore them to her Majesty; and as a last memorial\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he looked round\r\nfor some valuable object\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou will add\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe still sought; but his eyes, darkened by death, encountered only the\r\nknife which had fallen from the hand of Felton, still smoking with the\r\nblood spread over its blade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will add to them this knife,\xe2\x80\x9d said the duke, pressing the hand\r\nof Laporte. He had just strength enough to place the scent bag at the\r\nbottom of the silver casket, and to let the knife fall into it, making\r\na sign to Laporte that he was no longer able to speak; then, in a last\r\nconvulsion, which this time he had not the power to combat, he slipped\r\nfrom the sofa to the floor.\r\n\r\nPatrick uttered a loud cry.\r\n\r\nBuckingham tried to smile a last time; but death checked his thought,\r\nwhich remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of love.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the duke\xe2\x80\x99s surgeon arrived, quite terrified; he was\r\nalready on board the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s ship, where they had been obliged to\r\nseek him.\r\n\r\nHe approached the duke, took his hand, held it for an instant in his\r\nown, and letting it fall, \xe2\x80\x9cAll is useless,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9che is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead, dead!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Patrick.\r\n\r\nAt this cry all the crowd re-entered the apartment, and throughout the\r\npalace and town there was nothing but consternation and tumult.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Lord de Winter saw Buckingham was dead, he ran to Felton,\r\nwhom the soldiers still guarded on the terrace of the palace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWretch!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the young man, who since the death of Buckingham\r\nhad regained that coolness and self-possession which never after\r\nabandoned him, \xe2\x80\x9cwretch! what have you done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have avenged myself!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAvenged yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the baron. \xe2\x80\x9cRather say that you have served as\r\nan instrument to that accursed woman; but I swear to you that this\r\ncrime shall be her last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Felton, quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am\r\nignorant of whom you are speaking, my Lord. I killed the Duke of\r\nBuckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint me captain;\r\nI have punished him for his injustice, that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDe Winter, stupefied, looked on while the soldiers bound Felton, and\r\ncould not tell what to think of such insensibility.\r\n\r\nOne thing alone, however, threw a shade over the pallid brow of Felton.\r\nAt every noise he heard, the simple Puritan fancied he recognized the\r\nstep and voice of Milady coming to throw herself into his arms, to\r\naccuse herself, and die with him.\r\n\r\nAll at once he started. His eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea,\r\ncommanded by the terrace where he was. With the eagle glance of a\r\nsailor he had recognized there, where another would have seen only a\r\ngull hovering over the waves, the sail of a sloop which was directed\r\ntoward the coast of France.\r\n\r\nHe grew deadly pale, placed his hand upon his heart, which was\r\nbreaking, and at once perceived all the treachery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne last favor, my Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the baron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his Lordship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat o\xe2\x80\x99clock is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe baron drew out his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wants ten minutes to nine,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nMilady had hastened her departure by an hour and a half. As soon as she\r\nheard the cannon which announced the fatal event, she had ordered the\r\nanchor to be weighed. The vessel was making way under a blue sky, at\r\ngreat distance from the coast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod has so willed it!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with the resignation of a fanatic; but\r\nwithout, however, being able to take his eyes from that ship, on board\r\nof which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of\r\nher to whom he had sacrificed his life.\r\n\r\nDe Winter followed his look, observed his feelings, and guessed all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe punished _alone_, for the first, miserable man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord de\r\nWinter to Felton, who was being dragged away with his eyes turned\r\ntoward the sea; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I swear to you by the memory of my brother whom I\r\nhave loved so much that your accomplice is not saved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFelton lowered his head without pronouncing a syllable.\r\n\r\nAs to Lord de Winter, he descended the stairs rapidly, and went\r\nstraight to the port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LX.\r\nIN FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first fear of the King of England, Charles I., on learning of the\r\ndeath of the duke, was that such terrible news might discourage the\r\nRochellais; he tried, says Richelieu in his _Memoirs_, to conceal it\r\nfrom them as long as possible, closing all the ports of his kingdom,\r\nand carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army\r\nwhich Buckingham was getting together had gone, taking upon himself, in\r\ndefault of Buckingham, to superintend the departure.\r\n\r\nHe carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in England\r\nthe ambassadors of Denmark, who had taken their leave, and the regular\r\nambassador of Holland, who was to take back to the port of Flushing the\r\nIndian merchantmen of which Charles I. had made restitution to the\r\nUnited Provinces.\r\n\r\nBut as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the\r\nevent\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, till two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon\xe2\x80\x94two vessels had\r\nalready left the port, the one bearing, as we know, Milady, who,\r\nalready anticipating the event, was further confirmed in that belief by\r\nseeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admiral\xe2\x80\x99s ship.\r\n\r\nAs to the second vessel, we will tell hereafter whom it carried, and\r\nhow it set sail.\r\n\r\nDuring this time nothing new occurred in the camp at La Rochelle; only\r\nthe king, who was bored, as always, but perhaps a little more so in\r\ncamp than elsewhere, resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of\r\nSt. Louis at St. Germain, and asked the cardinal to order him an escort\r\nof only twenty Musketeers. The cardinal, who sometimes became weary of\r\nthe king, granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his\r\nroyal lieutenant, who promised to return about the fifteenth of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nM. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, being informed of this by his Eminence, packed his\r\nportmanteau; and as without knowing the cause he knew the great desire\r\nand even imperative need which his friends had of returning to Paris,\r\nit goes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the\r\nescort.\r\n\r\nThe four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after M. de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville, for they were the first to whom he communicated it. It was\r\nthen that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred\r\nupon him in making him at last enter the Musketeers\xe2\x80\x94for without that\r\ncircumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his\r\ncompanions left it.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that this impatience to return toward Paris had\r\nfor a cause the danger which Mme. Bonacieux would run of meeting at the\r\nconvent of B\xc3\xa9thune with Milady, her mortal enemy. Aramis therefore had\r\nwritten immediately to Marie Michon, the seamstress at Tours who had\r\nsuch fine acquaintances, to obtain from the queen authority for Mme.\r\nBonacieux to leave the convent, and to retire either into Lorraine or\r\nBelgium. They had not long to wait for an answer. Eight or ten days\r\nafterward Aramis received the following letter:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR COUSIN, Here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw\r\nour little servant from the convent of B\xc3\xa9thune, the air of which you\r\nthink is bad for her. My sister sends you this authorization with great\r\npleasure, for she is very partial to the little girl, to whom she\r\nintends to be more serviceable hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI salute you,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMARIE MICHON\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this letter was added an order, conceived in these terms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the Louvre, August 10, 1628\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe superior of the convent of B\xc3\xa9thune will place in the hands of the\r\nperson who shall present this note to her the novice who entered the\r\nconvent upon my recommendation and under my patronage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cANNE\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be easily imagined how the relationship between Aramis and a\r\nseamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men; but\r\nAramis, after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his\r\neyes at the gross pleasantry of Porthos, begged his friends not to\r\nrevert to the subject again, declaring that if a single word more was\r\nsaid to him about it, he would never again implore his cousins to\r\ninterfere in such affairs.\r\n\r\nThere was no further question, therefore, about Marie Michon among the\r\nfour Musketeers, who besides had what they wanted: that was, the order\r\nto withdraw Mme. Bonacieux from the convent of the Carmelites of\r\nB\xc3\xa9thune. It was true that this order would not be of great use to them\r\nwhile they were in camp at La Rochelle; that is to say, at the other\r\nend of France. Therefore D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was going to ask leave of absence\r\nof M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, confiding to him candidly the importance of his\r\ndeparture, when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three\r\nfriends that the king was about to set out for Paris with an escort of\r\ntwenty Musketeers, and that they formed part of the escort.\r\n\r\nTheir joy was great. The lackeys were sent on before with the baggage,\r\nand they set out on the morning of the sixteenth.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal accompanied his Majesty from Surg\xc3\xa8res to Mauzes; and there\r\nthe king and his minister took leave of each other with great\r\ndemonstrations of friendship.\r\n\r\nThe king, however, who sought distraction, while traveling as fast as\r\npossible\xe2\x80\x94for he was anxious to be in Paris by the twenty-third\xe2\x80\x94stopped\r\nfrom time to time to fly the magpie, a pastime for which the taste had\r\nbeen formerly inspired in him by de Luynes, and for which he had always\r\npreserved a great predilection. Out of the twenty Musketeers sixteen,\r\nwhen this took place, rejoiced greatly at this relaxation; but the\r\nother four cursed it heartily. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, in particular, had a\r\nperpetual buzzing in his ears, which Porthos explained thus: \xe2\x80\x9cA very\r\ngreat lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you\r\nsomewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt length the escort passed through Paris on the twenty-third, in the\r\nnight. The king thanked M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, and permitted him to distribute\r\nfurloughs for four days, on condition that the favored parties should\r\nnot appear in any public place, under penalty of the Bastille.\r\n\r\nThe first four furloughs granted, as may be imagined, were to our four\r\nfriends. Still further, Athos obtained of M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville six days\r\ninstead of four, and introduced into these six days two more nights\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nthey set out on the twenty-fourth at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, and\r\nas a further kindness M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville post-dated the leave to the\r\nmorning of the twenty-fifth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who, as we have often said, never\r\nstumbled at anything. \xe2\x80\x9cIt appears to me that we are making a great\r\ntrouble of a very simple thing. In two days, and by using up two or\r\nthree horses (that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing; I have plenty of money), I am at B\xc3\xa9thune.\r\nI present my letter from the queen to the superior, and I bring back\r\nthe dear treasure I go to seek\xe2\x80\x94not into Lorraine, not into Belgium, but\r\nto Paris, where she will be much better concealed, particularly while\r\nthe cardinal is at La Rochelle. Well, once returned from the country,\r\nhalf by the protection of her cousin, half through what we have\r\npersonally done for her, we shall obtain from the queen what we desire.\r\nRemain, then, where you are, and do not exhaust yourselves with useless\r\nfatigue. Myself and Planchet are all that such a simple expedition\r\nrequires.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this Athos replied quietly: \xe2\x80\x9cWe also have money left\xe2\x80\x94for I have not\r\nyet drunk all my share of the diamond, and Porthos and Aramis have not\r\neaten all theirs. We can therefore use up four horses as well as one.\r\nBut consider, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, in a tone so solemn that it made\r\nthe young man shudder, \xe2\x80\x9cconsider that B\xc3\xa9thune is a city where the\r\ncardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who, wherever she goes, brings\r\nmisery with her. If you had only to deal with four men, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, I\r\nwould allow you to go alone. You have to do with that woman! We four\r\nwill go; and I hope to God that with our four lackeys we may be in\r\nsufficient number.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou terrify me, Athos!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cMy God! what do you fear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan examined the countenances of his companions, which, like\r\nthat of Athos, wore an impression of deep anxiety; and they continued\r\ntheir route as fast as their horses could carry them, but without\r\nadding another word.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the twenty-fifth, as they were entering Arras, and as\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was dismounting at the inn of the Golden Harrow to drink a\r\nglass of wine, a horseman came out of the post yard, where he had just\r\nhad a relay, started off at a gallop, and with a fresh horse took the\r\nroad to Paris. At the moment he passed through the gateway into the\r\nstreet, the wind blew open the cloak in which he was wrapped, although\r\nit was in the month of August, and lifted his hat, which the traveler\r\nseized with his hand the moment it had left his head, pulling it\r\neagerly over his eyes.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who had his eyes fixed upon this man, became very pale, and\r\nlet his glass fall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d said Planchet. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, come, gentlemen, my\r\nmaster is ill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three friends hastened toward D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who, instead of being\r\nill, ran toward his horse. They stopped him at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, where the devil are you going now?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is he!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, pale with anger, and with the sweat on\r\nhis brow, \xe2\x80\x9cit is he! let me overtake him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe? What he?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe, that man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat cursed man, my evil genius, whom I have always met with when\r\nthreatened by some misfortune, he who accompanied that horrible woman\r\nwhen I met her for the first time, he whom I was seeking when I\r\noffended our Athos, he whom I saw on the very morning Madame Bonacieux\r\nwas abducted. I have seen him; that is he! I recognized him when the\r\nwind blew upon his cloak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, musingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo saddle, gentlemen! to saddle! Let us pursue him, and we shall\r\novertake him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cremember that he goes in an opposite\r\ndirection from that in which we are going, that he has a fresh horse,\r\nand ours are fatigued, so that we shall disable our own horses without\r\neven a chance of overtaking him. Let the man go, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; let us\r\nsave the woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a hostler, running out and looking after\r\nthe stranger, \xe2\x80\x9cmonsieur, here is a paper which dropped out of your hat!\r\nEh, monsieur, eh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9ca half-pistole for that paper!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy faith, monsieur, with great pleasure! Here it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hostler, enchanted with the good day\xe2\x80\x99s work he had done, returned\r\nto the yard. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan unfolded the paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d eagerly demanded all his three friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing but one word!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that one word is the name of some town or\r\nvillage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Armenti\xc3\xa8res_,\xe2\x80\x9d read Porthos; \xe2\x80\x9cArmenti\xc3\xa8res? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know such a\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that name of a town or village is written in her hand!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nAthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, come on!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9clet us keep that paper carefully,\r\nperhaps I have not thrown away my half-pistole. To horse, my friends,\r\nto horse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to B\xc3\xa9thune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LXI.\r\nTHE CARMELITE CONVENT AT B\xc3\x89THUNE\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat criminals bear about them a kind of predestination which makes\r\nthem surmount all obstacles, which makes them escape all dangers, up to\r\nthe moment which a wearied Providence has marked as the rock of their\r\nimpious fortunes.\r\n\r\nIt was thus with Milady. She escaped the cruisers of both nations, and\r\narrived at Boulogne without accident.\r\n\r\nWhen landing at Portsmouth, Milady was an Englishwoman whom the\r\npersecutions of the French drove from La Rochelle; when landing at\r\nBoulogne, after a two days\xe2\x80\x99 passage, she passed for a Frenchwoman whom\r\nthe English persecuted at Portsmouth out of their hatred for France.\r\n\r\nMilady had, likewise, the best of passports\xe2\x80\x94her beauty, her noble\r\nappearance, and the liberality with which she distributed her pistoles.\r\nFreed from the usual formalities by the affable smile and gallant\r\nmanners of an old governor of the port, who kissed her hand, she only\r\nremained long enough at Boulogne to put into the post a letter,\r\nconceived in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_To his Eminence Monseigneur the Cardinal Richelieu, in his camp\r\nbefore La Rochelle_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMONSEIGNEUR, Let your Eminence be reassured. His Grace the Duke of\r\nBuckingham _will not set out_ for France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMILADY DE \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBOULOGNE, evening of the twenty-fifth.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S.\xe2\x80\x94According to the desire of your Eminence, I report to the convent\r\nof the Carmelites at B\xc3\xa9thune, where I will await your orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, that same evening Milady commenced her journey. Night\r\novertook her; she stopped, and slept at an inn. At five o\xe2\x80\x99clock the\r\nnext morning she again proceeded, and in three hours after entered\r\nB\xc3\xa9thune. She inquired for the convent of the Carmelites, and went\r\nthither immediately.\r\n\r\nThe superior met her; Milady showed her the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s order. The\r\nabbess assigned her a chamber, and had breakfast served.\r\n\r\nAll the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman; and her looks,\r\nfixed on the future, beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for\r\nher by the cardinal, whom she had so successfully served without his\r\nname being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair. The ever-new\r\npassions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those\r\nclouds which float in the heavens, reflecting sometimes azure,\r\nsometimes fire, sometimes the opaque blackness of the tempest, and\r\nwhich leave no traces upon the earth behind them but devastation and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, the abbess came to pay her a visit. There is very\r\nlittle amusement in the cloister, and the good superior was eager to\r\nmake the acquaintance of her new boarder.\r\n\r\nMilady wished to please the abbess. This was a very easy matter for a\r\nwoman so really superior as she was. She tried to be agreeable, and she\r\nwas charming, winning the good superior by her varied conversation and\r\nby the graces of her whole personality.\r\n\r\nThe abbess, who was the daughter of a noble house, took particular\r\ndelight in stories of the court, which so seldom travel to the\r\nextremities of the kingdom, and which, above all, have so much\r\ndifficulty in penetrating the walls of convents, at whose threshold the\r\nnoise of the world dies away.\r\n\r\nMilady, on the contrary, was quite conversant with all aristocratic\r\nintrigues, amid which she had constantly lived for five or six years.\r\nShe made it her business, therefore, to amuse the good abbess with the\r\nworldly practices of the court of France, mixed with the eccentric\r\npursuits of the king; she made for her the scandalous chronicle of the\r\nlords and ladies of the court, whom the abbess knew perfectly by name,\r\ntouched lightly on the amours of the queen and the Duke of Buckingham,\r\ntalking a great deal to induce her auditor to talk a little.\r\n\r\nBut the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without\r\nreplying a word. Milady, however, saw that this sort of narrative\r\namused her very much, and kept at it; only she now let her conversation\r\ndrift toward the cardinal.\r\n\r\nBut she was greatly embarrassed. She did not know whether the abbess\r\nwas a royalist or a cardinalist; she therefore confined herself to a\r\nprudent middle course. But the abbess, on her part, maintained a\r\nreserve still more prudent, contenting herself with making a profound\r\ninclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the\r\nname of his Eminence.\r\n\r\nMilady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life; she\r\nresolved, then, to risk something in order that she might know how to\r\nact afterward. Desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good\r\nabbess would go, she began to tell a story, obscure at first, but very\r\ncircumstantial afterward, about the cardinal, relating the amours of\r\nthe minister with Mme. d\xe2\x80\x99Aiguillon, Marion de Lorme, and several other\r\ngay women.\r\n\r\nThe abbess listened more attentively, grew animated by degrees, and\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cshe takes a pleasure in my conversation. If\r\nshe is a cardinalist, she has no fanaticism, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal\r\nupon his enemies. The abbess only crossed herself, without approving or\r\ndisapproving.\r\n\r\nThis confirmed Milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather\r\nroyalist than cardinalist. Milady therefore continued, coloring her\r\nnarrations more and more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very ignorant of these matters,\xe2\x80\x9d said the abbess, at length; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nhowever distant from the court we may be, however remote from the\r\ninterests of the world we may be placed, we have very sad examples of\r\nwhat you have related. And one of our boarders has suffered much from\r\nthe vengeance and persecution of the cardinal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of your boarders?\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady; \xe2\x80\x9coh, my God! Poor woman! I pity\r\nher, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have reason, for she is much to be pitied. Imprisonment,\r\nmenaces, ill treatment\xe2\x80\x94she has suffered everything. But after all,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nresumed the abbess, \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Cardinal has perhaps plausible motives\r\nfor acting thus; and though she has the look of an angel, we must not\r\nalways judge people by the appearance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady to herself; \xe2\x80\x9cwho knows! I am about, perhaps, to\r\ndiscover something here; I am in the vein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cI know it is so. It is said that we must not\r\ntrust to the face; but in what, then, shall we place confidence, if not\r\nin the most beautiful work of the Lord? As for me, I shall be deceived\r\nall my life perhaps, but I shall always have faith in a person whose\r\ncountenance inspires me with sympathy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would, then, be tempted to believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the abbess, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this\r\nyoung person is innocent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cardinal pursues not only crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d said she: \xe2\x80\x9cthere are certain\r\nvirtues which he pursues more severely than certain offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me, madame, to express my surprise,\xe2\x80\x9d said the abbess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what?\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, with the utmost ingenuousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the language you use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you find so astonishing in that language?\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the friend of the cardinal, for he sends you hither, and yet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I speak ill of him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady, finishing the thought of\r\nthe superior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least you don\xe2\x80\x99t speak well of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is because I am not his friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, sighing, \xe2\x80\x9cbut his\r\nvictim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this letter in which he recommends you to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison, from which\r\nhe will release me by one of his satellites.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why have you not fled?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhither should I go? Do you believe there is a spot on the earth which\r\nthe cardinal cannot reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his\r\nhand? If I were a man, that would barely be possible; but what can a\r\nwoman do? This young boarder of yours, has she tried to fly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that is true; but she\xe2\x80\x94that is another thing; I believe she is\r\ndetained in France by some love affair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cif she loves she is not altogether\r\nwretched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the abbess, looking at Milady with increasing interest, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbehold another poor victim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady.\r\n\r\nThe abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness, as if a fresh\r\nthought suggested itself to her mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not an enemy of our holy faith?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x94I?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cI a Protestant? Oh, no! I call to witness the\r\nGod who hears us, that on the contrary I am a fervent Catholic!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said the abbess, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cbe reassured; the house in\r\nwhich you are shall not be a very hard prison, and we will do all in\r\nour power to make you cherish your captivity. You will find here,\r\nmoreover, the young woman of whom I spoke, who is persecuted, no doubt,\r\nin consequence of some court intrigue. She is amiable and\r\nwell-behaved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is her name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was sent to me by someone of high rank, under the name of Kitty. I\r\nhave not tried to discover her other name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKitty!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Are you sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat she is called so? Yes, madame. Do you know her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that\r\nthis might be her old chambermaid. There was connected with the\r\nremembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger; and a desire of\r\nvengeance disordered the features of Milady, which, however,\r\nimmediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this\r\nwoman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to lose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when can I see this young lady, for whom I already feel so great a\r\nsympathy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said the abbess; \xe2\x80\x9ctoday even. But you have been\r\ntraveling these four days, as you told me yourself. This morning you\r\nrose at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock; you must stand in need of repose. Go to bed and\r\nsleep; at dinnertime we will rouse you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough Milady would very willingly have gone without sleep, sustained\r\nas she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her\r\nheart, ever thirsting for intrigues, she nevertheless accepted the\r\noffer of the superior. During the last fifteen days she had experienced\r\nso many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still\r\ncapable of supporting fatigue, her mind required repose.\r\n\r\nShe therefore took leave of the abbess, and went to bed, softly rocked\r\nby the ideas of vengeance which the name of Kitty had naturally brought\r\nto her thoughts. She remembered that almost unlimited promise which the\r\ncardinal had given her if she succeeded in her enterprise. She had\r\nsucceeded; D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was then in her power!\r\n\r\nOne thing alone frightened her; that was the remembrance of her\r\nhusband, the Comte de la F\xc3\xa8re, whom she had believed dead, or at least\r\nexpatriated, and whom she found again in Athos\xe2\x80\x94the best friend of\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\nBut alas, if he was the friend of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, he must have lent him his\r\nassistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated\r\nthe project of his Eminence; if he was the friend of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, he was\r\nthe enemy of the cardinal; and she doubtless would succeed in involving\r\nhim in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young Musketeer.\r\n\r\nAll these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for Milady; so, rocked by\r\nthem, she soon fell asleep.\r\n\r\nShe was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed.\r\nShe opened her eyes, and saw the abbess, accompanied by a young woman\r\nwith light hair and delicate complexion, who fixed upon her a look full\r\nof benevolent curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her. Each examined\r\nthe other with great attention, while exchanging the customary\r\ncompliments; both were very handsome, but of quite different styles of\r\nbeauty. Milady, however, smiled in observing that she excelled the\r\nyoung woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing. It is true\r\nthat the habit of a novice, which the young woman wore, was not very\r\nadvantageous in a contest of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe abbess introduced them to each other. When this formality was\r\nended, as her duties called her to chapel, she left the two young women\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThe novice, seeing Milady in bed, was about to follow the example of\r\nthe superior; but Milady stopped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI have scarcely seen you, and you already\r\nwish to deprive me of your company, upon which I had counted a little,\r\nI must confess, for the time I have to pass here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the novice, \xe2\x80\x9conly I thought I had chosen my time\r\nill; you were asleep, you are fatigued.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat can those who sleep wish for\xe2\x80\x94a happy\r\nawakening? This awakening you have given me; allow me, then, to enjoy\r\nit at my ease,\xe2\x80\x9d and taking her hand, she drew her toward the armchair\r\nby the bedside.\r\n\r\nThe novice sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow unfortunate I am!\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cI have been here six months without\r\nthe shadow of recreation. You arrive, and your presence was likely to\r\nafford me delightful company; yet I expect, in all probability, to quit\r\nthe convent at any moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, you are going soon?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least I hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the novice, with an expression of joy which\r\nshe made no effort to disguise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cthat would have been another motive for sympathy\r\nbetween us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I have heard, then, from our good mother is true; you have\r\nlikewise been a victim of that wicked priest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady; \xe2\x80\x9clet us not, even here, speak thus of him. All my\r\nmisfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before\r\na woman whom I thought my friend, and who betrayed me. Are you also the\r\nvictim of a treachery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the novice, \xe2\x80\x9cbut of my devotion\xe2\x80\x94of a devotion to a woman I\r\nloved, for whom I would have laid down my life, for whom I would give\r\nit still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who has abandoned you\xe2\x80\x94is that it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been sufficiently unjust to believe so; but during the last two\r\nor three days I have obtained proof to the contrary, for which I thank\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x94for it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me.\r\nBut you, madame, you appear to be free,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the novice; \xe2\x80\x9cand if\r\nyou were inclined to fly it only rests with yourself to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhither would you have me go, without friends, without money, in a\r\npart of France with which I am unacquainted, and where I have never\r\nbeen before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the novice, \xe2\x80\x9cas to friends, you would have them wherever\r\nyou want, you appear so good and are so beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat does not prevent,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady, softening her smile so as to\r\ngive it an angelic expression, \xe2\x80\x9cmy being alone or being persecuted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the novice; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must trust in heaven. There always\r\ncomes a moment when the good you have done pleads your cause before\r\nGod; and see, perhaps it is a happiness for you, humble and powerless\r\nas I am, that you have met with me, for if I leave this place, well\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nhave powerful friends, who, after having exerted themselves on my\r\naccount, may also exert themselves for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, when I said I was alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, hoping to make the novice\r\ntalk by talking of herself, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not for want of friends in high\r\nplaces; but these friends themselves tremble before the cardinal. The\r\nqueen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister. I have\r\nproof that her Majesty, notwithstanding her excellent heart, has more\r\nthan once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his Eminence persons\r\nwho had served her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust me, madame; the queen may appear to have abandoned those\r\npersons, but we must not put faith in appearances. The more they are\r\npersecuted, the more she thinks of them; and often, when they least\r\nexpect it, they have proof of a kind remembrance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe so; the queen is so good!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you know her, then, that lovely and noble queen, that you speak of\r\nher thus!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the novice, with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady, driven into her entrenchment, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\nhave not the honor of knowing her personally; but I know a great number\r\nof her most intimate friends. I am acquainted with Monsieur de Putange;\r\nI met Monsieur Dujart in England; I know Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the novice, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know Monsieur de\r\nTr\xc3\xa9ville?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, perfectly well\xe2\x80\x94intimately even.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe captain of the king\xe2\x80\x99s Musketeers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe captain of the king\xe2\x80\x99s Musketeers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, then, only see!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the novice; \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall soon be well\r\nacquainted, almost friends. If you know Monsieur de Tr\xc3\xa9ville, you must\r\nhave visited him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOften!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, who, having entered this track, and perceiving\r\nthat falsehood succeeded, was determined to follow it to the end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith him, then, you must have seen some of his Musketeers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll those he is in the habit of receiving!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady, for whom\r\nthis conversation began to have a real interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cName a few of those whom you know, and you will see if they are my\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, embarrassed, \xe2\x80\x9cI know Monsieur de Louvigny,\r\nMonsieur de Courtivron, Monsieur de Ferussac.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe novice let her speak, then seeing that she paused, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou know a gentleman named Athos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying, and\r\nmistress as she was of herself, could not help uttering a cry, seizing\r\nthe hand of the novice, and devouring her with looks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter? Good God!\xe2\x80\x9d asked the poor woman, \xe2\x80\x9chave I said\r\nanything that has wounded you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but the name struck me, because I also have known that gentleman,\r\nand it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know\r\nhim well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, very well; not only him, but some of his friends, Messieurs\r\nPorthos and Aramis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! you know them likewise? I know them,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, who began\r\nto feel a chill penetrate her heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you know them, you know that they are good and free\r\ncompanions. Why do you not apply to them, if you stand in need of\r\nhelp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not really very intimate with\r\nany of them. I know them from having heard one of their friends,\r\nMonsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, say a great deal about them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the novice, in her turn seizing\r\nthe hands of Milady and devouring her with her eyes.\r\n\r\nThen remarking the strange expression of Milady\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, madame; you know him by what title?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Milady, embarrassed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, by the title of friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou deceive me, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said the novice; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have been his\r\nmistress!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is you who have been his mistress, madame!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, in her\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d said the novice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you! I know you now. You are Madame Bonacieux!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young woman drew back, filled with surprise and terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do not deny it! Answer!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said the novice, \xe2\x80\x9cAre we rivals?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under\r\nany other circumstances Mme. Bonacieux would have fled in terror; but\r\nshe was absorbed by jealousy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, madame!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mme. Bonacieux, with an energy of which she\r\nmight not have been believed capable. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you been, or are you, his\r\nmistress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, with an accent that admitted no doubt of her\r\ntruth. \xe2\x80\x9cNever, never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux; \xe2\x80\x9cbut why, then, did you cry out\r\nso?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not understand?\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, who had already overcome her\r\nagitation and recovered all her presence of mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I understand? I know nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you not understand that Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, being my friend,\r\nmight take me into his confidence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not perceive that I know all\xe2\x80\x94your abduction from the little\r\nhouse at St. Germain, his despair, that of his friends, and their\r\nuseless inquiries up to this moment? How could I help being astonished\r\nwhen, without having the least expectation of such a thing, I meet you\r\nface to face\xe2\x80\x94you, of whom we have so often spoken together, you whom he\r\nloves with all his soul, you whom he had taught me to love before I had\r\nseen you! Ah, dear Constance, I have found you, then; I see you at\r\nlast!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Milady stretched out her arms to Mme. Bonacieux, who, convinced by\r\nwhat she had just said, saw nothing in this woman whom an instant\r\nbefore she had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, pardon me, pardon me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, sinking upon the shoulders of\r\nMilady. \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, I love him so much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace.\r\nCertainly, if Milady\xe2\x80\x99s strength had been equal to her hatred, Mme.\r\nBonacieux would never have left that embrace alive. But not being able\r\nto stifle her, she smiled upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you beautiful, good little creature!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady. \xe2\x80\x9cHow delighted\r\nI am to have found you! Let me look at you!\xe2\x80\x9d and while saying these\r\nwords, she absolutely devoured her by her looks. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes it is you\r\nindeed! From what he has told me, I know you now. I recognize you\r\nperfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty\r\nwas behind the rampart of that pure brow, behind those brilliant eyes\r\nin which she read nothing but interest and compassion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you know what I have suffered,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9csince he\r\nhas told you what he has suffered; but to suffer for him is happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady replied mechanically, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d She was thinking\r\nof something else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mme. Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cmy punishment is drawing to a\r\nclose. Tomorrow, this evening, perhaps, I shall see him again; and then\r\nthe past will no longer exist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis evening?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady, roused from her reverie by these words.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? Do you expect news from him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHimself? D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHimself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s impossible! He is at the siege of La Rochelle with the\r\ncardinal. He will not return till after the taking of the city.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you fancy so! But is there anything impossible for my D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\nthe noble and loyal gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I cannot believe you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, read, then!\xe2\x80\x9d said the unhappy young woman, in the excess of her\r\npride and joy, presenting a letter to Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe writing of Madame de Chevreuse!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, I\r\nalways thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd she greedily read the following few lines:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CHILD, Hold yourself ready. _Our friend_ will see you soon, and\r\nhe will only see you to release you from that imprisonment in which\r\nyour safety required you should be concealed. Prepare, then, for your\r\ndeparture, and never despair of us.\r\n    Our charming Gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful\r\n    as ever. Tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning\r\n    he has given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cthe letter is precise. Do you know what that\r\nwarning was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh\r\nmachinations of the cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, no doubt!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, returning the letter to Mme.\r\nBonacieux, and letting her head sink pensively upon her bosom.\r\n\r\nAt that moment they heard the gallop of a horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mme. Bonacieux, darting to the window, \xe2\x80\x9ccan it be he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady remained still in bed, petrified by surprise; so many unexpected\r\nthings happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a\r\nloss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe, he!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she; \xe2\x80\x9ccan it be he?\xe2\x80\x9d And she remained in bed with\r\nher eyes fixed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux; \xe2\x80\x9cit is a man I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, although he\r\nseems to be coming here. Yes, he checks his pace; he stops at the gate;\r\nhe rings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady sprang out of bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure it is not he?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, very sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you did not see well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if I were to see the plume of his hat, the end of his cloak, I\r\nshould know _him!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady was dressing herself all the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he has entered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is for you or me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God, how agitated you seem!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I admit it. I have not your confidence; I fear the cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux; \xe2\x80\x9csomebody is coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nImmediately the door opened, and the superior entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you come from Boulogne?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded she of Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, trying to recover her self-possession. \xe2\x80\x9cWho wants\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man who will not tell his name, but who comes from the cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who wishes to speak with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho wishes to speak to a lady recently come from Boulogne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let him come in, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mme. Bonacieux. \xe2\x80\x9cCan it be bad news?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will leave you with this stranger; but as soon as he is gone, if you\r\nwill permit me, I will return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Permit_ you? I _beseech_ you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe superior and Mme. Bonacieux retired.\r\n\r\nMilady remained alone, with her eyes fixed upon the door. An instant\r\nlater, the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs, steps drew\r\nnear, the door opened, and a man appeared.\r\n\r\nMilady uttered a cry of joy; this man was the Comte de Rochefort\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndemoniacal tool of his Eminence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LXII.\r\nTWO VARIETIES OF DEMONS\r\n\r\n\r\nAh,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady and Rochefort together, \xe2\x80\x9cit is you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you come?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom La Rochelle; and you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuckingham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead or desperately wounded, as I left without having been able to\r\nhear anything of him. A fanatic has just assassinated him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rochefort, with a smile; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a fortunate chance\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nthat will delight his Eminence! Have you informed him of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wrote to him from Boulogne. But what brings you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Eminence was uneasy, and sent me to find you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only arrived yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what have you been doing since yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not lost my time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know whom I have encountered here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat young woman whom the queen took out of prison.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mistress of that fellow D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; Madame Bonacieux, with whose retreat the cardinal was\r\nunacquainted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rochefort, \xe2\x80\x9chere is a chance which may pair off with\r\nthe other! Monsieur Cardinal is indeed a privileged man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImagine my astonishment,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I found myself face\r\nto face with this woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she know you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she looks upon you as a stranger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI am her best friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rochefort, \xe2\x80\x9cit takes you, my dear countess, to\r\nperform such miracles!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is well I can, Chevalier,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cfor do you know what\r\nis going on here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will come for her tomorrow or the day after, with an order from\r\nthe queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! And who?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and his friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, they will go so far that we shall be obliged to send them to\r\nthe Bastille.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it not done already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you? The cardinal has a weakness for these men which I\r\ncannot comprehend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, tell him this, Rochefort. Tell him that our conversation\r\nat the inn of the Red Dovecot was overheard by these four men; tell him\r\nthat after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by\r\nviolence the safe-conduct which he had given me; tell him they warned\r\nLord de Winter of my journey to England; that this time they nearly\r\nfoiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs; tell him that\r\namong these four men two only are to be feared\xe2\x80\x94D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and Athos;\r\ntell him that the third, Aramis, is the lover of Madame de Chevreuse\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nmay be left alone, we know his secret, and it may be useful; as to the\r\nfourth, Porthos, he is a fool, a simpleton, a blustering booby, not\r\nworth troubling himself about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut these four men must be now at the siege of La Rochelle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so, too; but a letter which Madame Bonacieux has received\r\nfrom Madame the Constable, and which she has had the imprudence to show\r\nme, leads me to believe that these four men, on the contrary, are on\r\nthe road hither to take her away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil! What\xe2\x80\x99s to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did the cardinal say about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was to take your dispatches, written or verbal, and return by post;\r\nand when he shall know what you have done, he will advise what you have\r\nto do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must, then, remain here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, or in the neighborhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot take me with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, the order is imperative. Near the camp you might be recognized;\r\nand your presence, you must be aware, would compromise the cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I must wait here, or in the neighborhood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly tell me beforehand where you will wait for intelligence from the\r\ncardinal; let me know always where to find you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObserve, it is probable that I may not be able to remain here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget that my enemies may arrive at any minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true; but is this little woman, then, to escape his Eminence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, with a smile that belonged only to herself; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nforget that I am her best friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s true! I may then tell the cardinal, with respect to this\r\nlittle woman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he may be at ease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will know what that means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will guess, at least. Now, then, what had I better do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReturn instantly. It appears to me that the news you bear is worth the\r\ntrouble of a little diligence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy chaise broke down coming into Lilliers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapital!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, _capital?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I want your chaise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how shall I travel, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn horseback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk very comfortably,\xe2\x80\x94a hundred and eighty leagues!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can do it! Afterward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfterward? Why, in passing through Lilliers you will send me your\r\nchaise, with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have, no doubt, some order from the cardinal about you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have my _full power_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow it to the abbess, and tell her that someone will come and fetch\r\nme, either today or tomorrow, and that I am to follow the person who\r\npresents himself in your name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a victim of the cardinal. It is necessary to inspire confidence\r\nin that poor little Madame Bonacieux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true. Now, will you make me a report of all that has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I have related the events to you. You have a good memory; repeat\r\nwhat I have told you. A paper may be lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right; only let me know where to find you that I may not run\r\nneedlessly about the neighborhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s correct; wait!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want a map?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know this country marvelously!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou? When were you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was brought up here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is worth something, you see, to have been brought up somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will wait for me, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me reflect a little! Ay, that will do\xe2\x80\x94at Armenti\xc3\xa8res.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is that Armenti\xc3\xa8res?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little town on the Lys; I shall only have to cross the river, and I\r\nshall be in a foreign country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapital! but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of\r\ndanger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well understood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in that case, how shall I know where you are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not want your lackey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he a sure man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the proof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him to me. Nobody knows him. I will leave him at the place I\r\nquit, and he will conduct you to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you say you will wait for me at Armenti\xc3\xa8res?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Armenti\xc3\xa8res.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite that name on a bit of paper, lest I should forget it. There is\r\nnothing compromising in the name of a town. Is it not so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, who knows? Never mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, writing the name on half a\r\nsheet of paper; \xe2\x80\x9cI will compromise myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rochefort, taking the paper from Milady, folding it, and\r\nplacing it in the lining of his hat, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may be easy. I will do as\r\nchildren do, for fear of losing the paper\xe2\x80\x94repeat the name along the\r\nroute. Now, is that all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us see: Buckingham dead or grievously wounded; your conversation\r\nwith the cardinal overheard by the four Musketeers; Lord de Winter\r\nwarned of your arrival at Portsmouth; D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and Athos to the\r\nBastille; Aramis the lover of Madame de Chevreuse; Porthos an ass;\r\nMadame Bonacieux found again; to send you the chaise as soon as\r\npossible; to place my lackey at your disposal; to make you out a victim\r\nof the cardinal in order that the abbess may entertain no suspicion;\r\nArmenti\xc3\xa8res, on the banks of the Lys. Is that all, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, my dear Chevalier, you are a miracle of memory. _A propos_,\r\nadd one thing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent garden.\r\nSay that I am permitted to walk in those woods. Who knows? Perhaps I\r\nshall stand in need of a back door for retreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you forget one thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo ask me if I want money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true. How much do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll you have in gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have five hundred pistoles, or thereabouts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have as much. With a thousand pistoles one may face everything.\r\nEmpty your pockets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight. And you go\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn an hour\xe2\x80\x94time to eat a morsel, during which I shall send for a post\r\nhorse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapital! Adieu, Chevalier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdieu, Countess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommend me to the cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommend me to Satan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady and Rochefort exchanged a smile and separated. An hour afterward\r\nRochefort set out at a grand gallop; five hours after that he passed\r\nthrough Arras.\r\n\r\nOur readers already know how he was recognized by D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, and how\r\nthat recognition by inspiring fear in the four Musketeers had given\r\nfresh activity to their journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LXIII.\r\nTHE DROP OF WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nRochefort had scarcely departed when Mme. Bonacieux re-entered. She\r\nfound Milady with a smiling countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat you dreaded has happened. This\r\nevening, or tomorrow, the cardinal will send someone to take you away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you that, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard it from the mouth of the messenger himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and sit down close to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till I assure myself that nobody hears us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy all these precautions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady arose, went to the door, opened it, looked in the corridor, and\r\nthen returned and seated herself close to Mme. Bonacieux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9che has well played his part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from\r\nthe cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was, then, a part he was playing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat man, then, was not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, lowering her voice, \xe2\x80\x9cis my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour brother!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mme. Bonacieux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one must know this secret, my dear, but yourself. If you reveal it\r\nto anyone in the world, I shall be lost, and perhaps yourself\r\nlikewise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen. This is what has happened: My brother, who was coming to my\r\nassistance to take me away by force if it were necessary, met with the\r\nemissary of the cardinal, who was coming in search of me. He followed\r\nhim. At a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword, and\r\nrequired the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was\r\nthe bearer. The messenger resisted; my brother killed him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux, shuddering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, that was the only means. Then my brother determined to\r\nsubstitute cunning for force. He took the papers, and presented himself\r\nhere as the emissary of the cardinal, and in an hour or two a carriage\r\nwill come to take me away by the orders of his Eminence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand. It is your brother who sends this carriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly; but that is not all. That letter you have received, and which\r\nyou believe to be from Madame de Chevreuse\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a forgery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can that be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a forgery; it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance\r\nwhen they come to fetch you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan that will come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not deceive yourself. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and his friends are detained at\r\nthe siege of La Rochelle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of\r\nMusketeers. You would have been summoned to the gate; you would have\r\nbelieved yourself about to meet friends; you would have been abducted,\r\nand conducted back to Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God! My senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniquities. I feel,\r\nif this continues,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux, raising her hands to her\r\nforehead, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall go mad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear a horse\xe2\x80\x99s steps; it is my brother setting off again. I should\r\nlike to offer him a last salute. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady opened the window, and made a sign to Mme. Bonacieux to join\r\nher. The young woman complied.\r\n\r\nRochefort passed at a gallop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdieu, brother!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady.\r\n\r\nThe chevalier raised his head, saw the two young women, and without\r\nstopping, waved his hand in a friendly way to Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe good George!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, closing the window with an expression of\r\ncountenance full of affection and melancholy. And she resumed her seat,\r\nas if plunged in reflections entirely personal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cpardon me for interrupting you; but\r\nwhat do you advise me to do? Good heaven! You have more experience than\r\nI have. Speak; I will listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, \xe2\x80\x9cit is possible I may be deceived,\r\nand that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan and his friends may really come to your\r\nassistance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that would be too much!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mme. Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cso much happiness\r\nis not in store for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you comprehend it would be only a question of time, a sort of\r\nrace, which should arrive first. If your friends are the more speedy,\r\nyou are to be saved; if the satellites of the cardinal, you are lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, yes; lost beyond redemption! What, then, to do? What to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere would be a very simple means, very natural\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me what!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo wait, concealed in the neighborhood, and assure yourself who are\r\nthe men who come to ask for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where can I wait?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there is no difficulty in that. I shall stop and conceal myself a\r\nfew leagues hence until my brother can rejoin me. Well, I take you with\r\nme; we conceal ourselves, and wait together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I shall not be allowed to go; I am almost a prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs they believe that I go in consequence of an order from the\r\ncardinal, no one will believe you anxious to follow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! The carriage is at the door; you bid me adieu; you mount the\r\nstep to embrace me a last time; my brother\xe2\x80\x99s servant, who comes to\r\nfetch me, is told how to proceed; he makes a sign to the postillion,\r\nand we set off at a gallop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan! D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan! if he comes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we not know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing easier. We will send my brother\xe2\x80\x99s servant back to B\xc3\xa9thune,\r\nwhom, as I told you, we can trust. He shall assume a disguise, and\r\nplace himself in front of the convent. If the emissaries of the\r\ncardinal arrive, he will take no notice; if it is Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan\r\nand his friends, he will bring them to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows them, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless. Has he not seen Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan at my house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, yes; you are right. Thus all may go well\xe2\x80\x94all may be for the\r\nbest; but we do not go far from this place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven or eight leagues at the most. We will keep on the frontiers, for\r\ninstance; and at the first alarm we can leave France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what can we do there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if they come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother\xe2\x80\x99s carriage will be here first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes\r\nfor you\xe2\x80\x94at dinner or supper, for instance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo one thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together\r\nas possible, you ask her permission to share my repast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill she permit it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat inconvenience can it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, delightful! In this way we shall not be separated for an instant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go down to her, then, to make your request. I feel my head a\r\nlittle confused; I will take a turn in the garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo; and where shall I find you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, in an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, in an hour. Oh, you are so kind, and I am so grateful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I avoid interesting myself for one who is so beautiful and so\r\namiable? Are you not the beloved of one of my best friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan! Oh, how he will thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so. Now, then, all is agreed; let us go down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going into the garden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo along this corridor, down a little staircase, and you are in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent; thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the two women parted, exchanging charming smiles.\r\n\r\nMilady had told the truth\xe2\x80\x94her head was confused, for her ill-arranged\r\nplans clashed one another like chaos. She required to be alone that she\r\nmight put her thoughts a little into order. She saw vaguely the future;\r\nbut she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her\r\nideas, as yet confused, a distinct form and a regular plan.\r\n\r\nWhat was most pressing was to get Mme. Bonacieux away, and convey her\r\nto a place of safety, and there, if matters required, make her a\r\nhostage. Milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible\r\nduel, in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did\r\nanimosity.\r\n\r\nBesides, she felt as we feel when a storm is coming on\xe2\x80\x94that this issue\r\nwas near, and could not fail to be terrible.\r\n\r\nThe principal thing for her, then, was, as we have said, to keep Mme.\r\nBonacieux in her power. Mme. Bonacieux was the very life of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\nThis was more than his life, the life of the woman he loved; this was,\r\nin case of ill fortune, a means of temporizing and obtaining good\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nNow, this point was settled; Mme. Bonacieux, without any suspicion,\r\naccompanied her. Once concealed with her at Armenti\xc3\xa8res, it would be\r\neasy to make her believe that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had not come to B\xc3\xa9thune. In\r\nfifteen days at most, Rochefort would be back; besides, during that\r\nfifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge\r\nherself on the four friends. She would not be weary, thank God! for she\r\nshould enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of\r\nher character\xe2\x80\x94perfecting a beautiful vengeance.\r\n\r\nRevolving all this in her mind, she cast her eyes around her, and\r\narranged the topography of the garden in her head. Milady was like a\r\ngood general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat, and\r\nwho is quite prepared, according to the chances of the battle, to march\r\nforward or to beat a retreat.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her; it was Mme.\r\nBonacieux\xe2\x80\x99s. The good abbess had naturally consented to her request;\r\nand as a commencement, they were to sup together.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the courtyard, they heard the noise of a carriage which\r\nstopped at the gate.\r\n\r\nMilady listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear anything?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the rolling of a carriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the one my brother sends for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come! courage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bell of the convent gate was sounded; Milady was not mistaken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to your chamber,\xe2\x80\x9d said she to Mme. Bonacieux; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have perhaps\r\nsome jewels you would like to take.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have his letters,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go and fetch them, and come to my apartment. We will snatch some\r\nsupper; we shall perhaps travel part of the night, and must keep our\r\nstrength up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux, placing her hand upon her bosom, \xe2\x80\x9cmy\r\nheart beats so I cannot walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourage, courage! remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be\r\nsafe; and think that what you are about to do is for _his_ sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, everything for him. You have restored my courage by a single\r\nword; go, I will rejoin you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady ran up to her apartment quickly; she there found Rochefort\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlackey, and gave him his instructions.\r\n\r\nHe was to wait at the gate; if by chance the Musketeers should appear,\r\nthe carriage was to set off as fast as possible, pass around the\r\nconvent, and go and wait for Milady at a little village which was\r\nsituated at the other side of the wood. In this case Milady would cross\r\nthe garden and gain the village on foot. As we have already said,\r\nMilady was admirably acquainted with this part of France.\r\n\r\nIf the Musketeers did not appear, things were to go on as had been\r\nagreed; Mme. Bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her\r\nadieu, and she was to take away Mme. Bonacieux.\r\n\r\nMme. Bonacieux came in; and to remove all suspicion, if she had any,\r\nMilady repeated to the lackey, before her, the latter part of her\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nMilady asked some questions about the carriage. It was a chaise drawn\r\nby three horses, driven by a postillion; Rochefort\xe2\x80\x99s lackey would\r\nprecede it, as courier.\r\n\r\nMilady was wrong in fearing that Mme. Bonacieux would have any\r\nsuspicion. The poor young woman was too pure to suppose that any female\r\ncould be guilty of such perfidy; besides, the name of the Comtesse de\r\nWinter, which she had heard the abbess pronounce, was wholly unknown to\r\nher, and she was even ignorant that a woman had had so great and so\r\nfatal a share in the misfortune of her life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, when the lackey had gone out, \xe2\x80\x9ceverything is\r\nready. The abbess suspects nothing, and believes that I am taken by\r\norder of the cardinal. This man goes to give his last orders; take the\r\nleast thing, drink a finger of wine, and let us be gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux, mechanically, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, let us be gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady made her a sign to sit down opposite, poured her a small glass\r\nof Spanish wine, and helped her to the wing of a chicken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cif everything does not second us! Here is night\r\ncoming on; by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat, and nobody\r\ncan guess where we are. Come, courage! take something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMme. Bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically, and just touched the\r\nglass with her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, lifting hers to her mouth, \xe2\x80\x9cdo as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut at the moment the glass touched her lips, her hand remained\r\nsuspended; she heard something on the road which sounded like the\r\nrattling of a distant gallop. Then it grew nearer, and it seemed to\r\nher, almost at the same time, that she heard the neighing of horses.\r\n\r\nThis noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper\r\nin the midst of a happy dream; she grew pale and ran to the window,\r\nwhile Mme. Bonacieux, rising all in a tremble, supported herself upon\r\nher chair to avoid falling. Nothing was yet to be seen, only they heard\r\nthe galloping draw nearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is that noise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat of either our friends or our enemies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, with her\r\nterrible coolness. \xe2\x80\x9cStay where you are, I will tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMme. Bonacieux remained standing, mute, motionless, and pale as a\r\nstatue.\r\n\r\nThe noise became louder; the horses could not be more than a hundred\r\nand fifty paces distant. If they were not yet to be seen, it was\r\nbecause the road made an elbow. The noise became so distinct that the\r\nhorses might be counted by the rattle of their hoofs.\r\n\r\nMilady gazed with all the power of her attention; it was just light\r\nenough for her to see who was coming.\r\n\r\nAll at once, at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced\r\nhats and the waving of feathers; she counted two, then five, then eight\r\nhorsemen. One of them preceded the rest by double the length of his\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nMilady uttered a stifled groan. In the first horseman she recognized\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, my God,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mme. Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the uniform of the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s Guards. Not an instant to be lost!\r\nFly, fly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, let us fly!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mme. Bonacieux, but without being able\r\nto make a step, glued as she was to the spot by terror.\r\n\r\nThey heard the horsemen pass under the windows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, then, come, then!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, trying to drag the young woman\r\nalong by the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks to the garden, we yet can flee; I have the\r\nkey, but make haste! in five minutes it will be too late!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMme. Bonacieux tried to walk, made two steps, and sank upon her knees.\r\nMilady tried to raise and carry her, but could not do it.\r\n\r\nAt this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage, which at the\r\napproach of the Musketeers set off at a gallop. Then three or four\r\nshots were fired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the last time, will you come?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, my God! you see my strength fails me; you see plainly I\r\ncannot walk. Flee alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlee alone, and leave you here? No, no, never!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady.\r\n\r\nAll at once she paused, a livid flash darted from her eyes; she ran to\r\nthe table, emptied into Mme. Bonacieux\xe2\x80\x99s glass the contents of a ring\r\nwhich she opened with singular quickness. It was a grain of a reddish\r\ncolor, which dissolved immediately.\r\n\r\nThen, taking the glass with a firm hand, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cDrink. This wine\r\nwill give you strength, drink!\xe2\x80\x9d And she put the glass to the lips of\r\nthe young woman, who drank mechanically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the way that I wished to avenge myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady,\r\nreplacing the glass upon the table, with an infernal smile, \xe2\x80\x9cbut, my\r\nfaith! we do what we can!\xe2\x80\x9d And she rushed out of the room.\r\n\r\nMme. Bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her; she was\r\nlike people who dream they are pursued, and who in vain try to walk.\r\n\r\nA few moments passed; a great noise was heard at the gate. Every\r\ninstant Mme. Bonacieux expected to see Milady, but she did not return.\r\nSeveral times, with terror, no doubt, the cold sweat burst from her\r\nburning brow.\r\n\r\nAt length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates; the\r\nnoise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs. There was a great\r\nmurmur of voices which continued to draw near, amid which she seemed to\r\nhear her own name pronounced.\r\n\r\nAll at once she uttered a loud cry of joy, and darted toward the door;\r\nshe had recognized the voice of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan! D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, \xe2\x80\x9cis it you? This way! this way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConstance? Constance?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere are you? where\r\nare you? My God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock, rather than\r\nopened; several men rushed into the chamber. Mme. Bonacieux had sunk\r\ninto an armchair, without the power of moving.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan threw down a yet-smoking pistol which he held in his hand,\r\nand fell on his knees before his mistress. Athos replaced his in his\r\nbelt; Porthos and Aramis, who held their drawn swords in their hands,\r\nreturned them to their scabbards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, my beloved D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan! You have come, then, at last!\r\nYou have not deceived me! It is indeed thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, Constance. Reunited!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it was in vain she told me you would not come! I hoped in silence.\r\nI was not willing to fly. Oh, I have done well! How happy I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this word _she_, Athos, who had seated himself quietly, started up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_She!_ What she?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my companion. She who out of friendship for me wished to take me\r\nfrom my persecutors. She who, mistaking you for the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s Guards,\r\nhas just fled away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour companion!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, becoming more pale than the white\r\nveil of his mistress. \xe2\x80\x9cOf what companion are you speaking, dear\r\nConstance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf her whose carriage was at the gate; of a woman who calls herself\r\nyour friend; of a woman to whom you have told everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer name, her name!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cMy God, can you not remember\r\nher name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was pronounced in my hearing once. Stop\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94it is very\r\nstrange\xe2\x80\x94oh, my God, my head swims! I cannot see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp, help, my friends! her hands are icy cold,\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is ill! Great God, she is losing her senses!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong\r\nvoice, Aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water; but he stopped\r\nat seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the\r\ncountenance of Athos, who, standing before the table, his hair rising\r\nfrom his head, his eyes fixed in stupor, was looking at one of the\r\nglasses, and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9coh, no, it is impossible! God would not permit such\r\na crime!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWater, water!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cWater!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, poor woman, poor woman!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Athos, in a broken voice.\r\n\r\nMme. Bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe revives!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, my God, I thank thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cmadame, in the name of heaven, whose empty glass\r\nis this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman, in a dying voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who poured the wine for you that was in this glass?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who is _she?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I remember!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mme. Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Comtesse de Winter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe four friends uttered one and the same cry, but that of Athos\r\ndominated all the rest.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the countenance of Mme. Bonacieux became livid; a\r\nfearful agony pervaded her frame, and she sank panting into the arms of\r\nPorthos and Aramis.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan seized the hands of Athos with an anguish difficult to be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you believe?\xe2\x80\x9d His voice was stifled by sobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, biting his lips till the blood\r\nsprang to avoid sighing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mme. Bonacieux, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere art thou? Do not\r\nleave me! You see I am dying!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan released the hands of Athos which he still held clasped in\r\nboth his own, and hastened to her. Her beautiful face was distorted\r\nwith agony; her glassy eyes had no longer their sight; a convulsive\r\nshuddering shook her whole body; the sweat rolled from her brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of heaven, run, call! Aramis! Porthos! Call for help!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUseless!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cuseless! For the poison which _she_ pours there\r\nis no antidote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes! Help, help!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mme. Bonacieux; \xe2\x80\x9chelp!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, collecting all her strength, she took the head of the young man\r\nbetween her hands, looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul\r\npassed into that look, and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConstance, Constance!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\nA sigh escaped from the mouth of Mme. Bonacieux, and dwelt for an\r\ninstant on the lips of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. That sigh was the soul, so chaste\r\nand so loving, which reascended to heaven.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms. The young man\r\nuttered a cry, and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy\r\nas herself.\r\n\r\nPorthos wept; Aramis pointed toward heaven; Athos made the sign of the\r\ncross.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a man appeared in the doorway, almost as pale as those\r\nin the chamber. He looked around him and saw Mme. Bonacieux dead, and\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan in a swoon. He appeared just at that moment of stupor which\r\nfollows great catastrophes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not deceived,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9chere is Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; and you\r\nare his friends, Messieurs Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger\r\nwith astonishment. It seemed to all three that they knew him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the newcomer, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are, as I am, in search of a\r\nwoman who,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, with a terrible smile, \xe2\x80\x9cmust have passed this\r\nway, for I see a corpse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three friends remained mute\xe2\x80\x94for although the voice as well as the\r\ncountenance reminded them of someone they had seen, they could not\r\nremember under what circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9csince you do not recognize a man\r\nwho probably owes his life to you twice, I must name myself. I am Lord\r\nde Winter, brother-in-law of that _woman_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three friends uttered a cry of surprise.\r\n\r\nAthos rose, and offering him his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cBe welcome, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou are one of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI set out five hours after her from Portsmouth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord de Winter.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI arrived three hours after her at Boulogne. I missed her by twenty\r\nminutes at St. Omer. Finally, at Lilliers I lost all trace of her. I\r\nwas going about at random, inquiring of everybody, when I saw you\r\ngallop past. I recognized Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. I called to you, but you\r\ndid not answer me; I wished to follow you, but my horse was too much\r\nfatigued to go at the same pace with yours. And yet it appears, in\r\nspite of all your diligence, you have arrived too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, pointing to Mme. Bonacieux dead, and to\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, whom Porthos and Aramis were trying to recall to life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they both dead?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lord de Winter, sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cfortunately Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan has only\r\nfainted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, indeed, so much the better!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord de Winter.\r\n\r\nAt that moment D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan opened his eyes. He tore himself from the\r\narms of Porthos and Aramis, and threw himself like a madman on the\r\ncorpse of his mistress.\r\n\r\nAthos rose, walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step,\r\nembraced him tenderly, and as he burst into violent sobs, he said to\r\nhim with his noble and persuasive voice, \xe2\x80\x9cFriend, be a man! Women weep\r\nfor the dead; men avenge them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cyes! If it be to avenge her, I am ready\r\nto follow you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance\r\nrestored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to Porthos and Aramis\r\nto go and fetch the superior.\r\n\r\nThe two friends met her in the corridor, greatly troubled and much\r\nupset by such strange events; she called some of the nuns, who against\r\nall monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, passing his arm under that of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nabandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman. She was\r\nan angel on earth before being an angel in heaven. Treat her as one of\r\nyour sisters. We will return someday to pray over her grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan concealed his face in the bosom of Athos, and sobbed aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cweep, heart full of love, youth, and life! Alas,\r\nwould I could weep like you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he drew away his friend, as affectionate as a father, as consoling\r\nas a priest, noble as a man who has suffered much.\r\n\r\nAll five, followed by their lackeys leading their horses, took their\r\nway to the town of B\xc3\xa9thune, whose outskirts they perceived, and stopped\r\nbefore the first inn they came to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cshall we not pursue that woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLater,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cI have measures to take.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will escape us,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young man; \xe2\x80\x9cshe will escape us, and\r\nit will be your fault, Athos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be accountable for her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he\r\nlowered his head, and entered the inn without reply.\r\n\r\nPorthos and Aramis regarded each other, not understanding this\r\nassurance of Athos.\r\n\r\nLord de Winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, when he had ascertained there were five\r\nchambers free in the h\xc3\xb4tel, \xe2\x80\x9clet everyone retire to his own apartment.\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan needs to be alone, to weep and to sleep. I take charge of\r\neverything; be easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears, however,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord de Winter, \xe2\x80\x9cif there are any measures\r\nto take against the countess, it concerns me; she is my sister-in-law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94she is my wife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan smiled\xe2\x80\x94for he understood that Athos was sure of his\r\nvengeance when he revealed such a secret. Porthos and Aramis looked at\r\neach other, and grew pale. Lord de Winter thought Athos was mad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, retire to your chambers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cand leave me to act. You\r\nmust perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me. Only,\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, if you have not lost it, give me the paper which fell from\r\nthat man\xe2\x80\x99s hat, upon which is written the name of the village of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cI comprehend! that name written in her hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a god in heaven still!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LXIV.\r\nTHE MAN IN THE RED CLOAK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe despair of Athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only\r\nrendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that\r\nextraordinary man.\r\n\r\nPossessed by one single thought\xe2\x80\x94that of the promise he had made, and of\r\nthe responsibility he had taken\xe2\x80\x94he retired last to his chamber, begged\r\nthe host to procure him a map of the province, bent over it, examined\r\nevery line traced upon it, perceived that there were four different\r\nroads from B\xc3\xa9thune to Armenti\xc3\xa8res, and summoned the lackeys.\r\n\r\nPlanchet, Grimaud, Bazin, and Mousqueton presented themselves, and\r\nreceived clear, positive, and serious orders from Athos.\r\n\r\nThey must set out the next morning at daybreak, and go to\r\nArmenti\xc3\xa8res\xe2\x80\x94each by a different route. Planchet, the most intelligent\r\nof the four, was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon\r\nwhich the four friends had fired, and which was accompanied, as may be\r\nremembered, by Rochefort\xe2\x80\x99s servant.\r\n\r\nAthos set the lackeys to work first because, since these men had been\r\nin the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of\r\nthem different and essential qualities. Then, lackeys who ask questions\r\ninspire less mistrust than masters, and meet with more sympathy among\r\nthose to whom they address themselves. Besides, Milady knew the\r\nmasters, and did not know the lackeys; on the contrary, the lackeys\r\nknew Milady perfectly.\r\n\r\nAll four were to meet the next day at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. If they had\r\ndiscovered Milady\xe2\x80\x99s retreat, three were to remain on guard; the fourth\r\nwas to return to B\xc3\xa9thune in order to inform Athos and serve as a guide\r\nto the four friends. These arrangements made, the lackeys retired.\r\n\r\nAthos then arose from his chair, girded on his sword, enveloped himself\r\nin his cloak, and left the h\xc3\xb4tel. It was nearly ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. At ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, it is well known, the streets in provincial\r\ntowns are very little frequented. Athos nevertheless was visibly\r\nanxious to find someone of whom he could ask a question. At length he\r\nmet a belated passenger, went up to him, and spoke a few words to him.\r\nThe man he addressed recoiled with terror, and only answered the few\r\nwords of the Musketeer by pointing. Athos offered the man half a\r\npistole to accompany him, but the man refused.\r\n\r\nAthos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his\r\nfinger; but arriving at four crossroads, he stopped again, visibly\r\nembarrassed. Nevertheless, as the crossroads offered him a better\r\nchance than any other place of meeting somebody, he stood still. In a\r\nfew minutes a night watch passed. Athos repeated to him the same\r\nquestion he had asked the first person he met. The night watch evinced\r\nthe same terror, refused, in his turn, to accompany Athos, and only\r\npointed with his hand to the road he was to take.\r\n\r\nAthos walked in the direction indicated, and reached the suburb\r\nsituated at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he\r\nand his friends had entered it. There he again appeared uneasy and\r\nembarrassed, and stopped for the third time.\r\n\r\nFortunately, a mendicant passed, who, coming up to Athos to ask\r\ncharity, Athos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was\r\ngoing. The mendicant hesitated at first, but at the sight of the piece\r\nof silver which shone in the darkness he consented, and walked on\r\nbefore Athos.\r\n\r\nArrived at the angle of a street, he pointed to a small house,\r\nisolated, solitary, and dismal. Athos went toward the house, while the\r\nmendicant, who had received his reward, left as fast as his legs could\r\ncarry him.\r\n\r\nAthos went round the house before he could distinguish the door, amid\r\nthe red color in which the house was painted. No light appeared through\r\nthe chinks of the shutters; no noise gave reason to believe that it was\r\ninhabited. It was dark and silent as the tomb.\r\n\r\nThree times Athos knocked without receiving an answer. At the third\r\nknock, however, steps were heard inside. The door at length was opened,\r\nand a man appeared, of high stature, pale complexion, and black hair\r\nand beard.\r\n\r\nAthos and he exchanged some words in a low voice, then the tall man\r\nmade a sign to the Musketeer that he might come in. Athos immediately\r\nprofited by the permission, and the door was closed behind him.\r\n\r\nThe man whom Athos had come so far to seek, and whom he had found with\r\nso much trouble, introduced him into his laboratory, where he was\r\nengaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a\r\nskeleton. All the frame was adjusted except the head, which lay on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nAll the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house\r\noccupied himself with the study of natural science. There were large\r\nbottles filled with serpents, ticketed according to their species;\r\ndried lizards shone like emeralds set in great squares of black wood,\r\nand bunches of wild odoriferous herbs, doubtless possessed of virtues\r\nunknown to common men, were fastened to the ceiling and hung down in\r\nthe corners of the apartment. There was no family, no servant; the tall\r\nman alone inhabited this house.\r\n\r\nAthos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have\r\ndescribed, and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down\r\nnear him.\r\n\r\nThen he explained to him the cause of his visit, and the service he\r\nrequired of him. But scarcely had he expressed his request when the\r\nunknown, who remained standing before the Musketeer, drew back with\r\nsigns of terror, and refused. Then Athos took from his pocket a small\r\npaper, on which two lines were written, accompanied by a signature and\r\na seal, and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these\r\nsigns of repugnance. The tall man had scarcely read these lines, seen\r\nthe signature, and recognized the seal, when he bowed to denote that he\r\nhad no longer any objection to make, and that he was ready to obey.\r\n\r\nAthos required no more. He arose, bowed, went out, returned by the same\r\nway he came, re-entered the h\xc3\xb4tel, and went to his apartment.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan entered the chamber, and demanded what was to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo wait,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos.\r\n\r\nSome minutes after, the superior of the convent sent to inform the\r\nMusketeers that the burial would take place at midday. As to the\r\npoisoner, they had heard no tidings of her whatever, only that she must\r\nhave made her escape through the garden, on the sand of which her\r\nfootsteps could be traced, and the door of which had been found shut.\r\nAs to the key, it had disappeared.\r\n\r\nAt the hour appointed, Lord de Winter and the four friends repaired to\r\nthe convent; the bells tolled, the chapel was open, the grating of the\r\nchoir was closed. In the middle of the choir the body of the victim,\r\nclothed in her novitiate dress, was exposed. On each side of the choir\r\nand behind the gratings opening into the convent was assembled the\r\nwhole community of the Carmelites, who listened to the divine service,\r\nand mingled their chant with the chant of the priests, without seeing\r\nthe profane, or being seen by them.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the chapel D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan felt his courage fall anew, and\r\nreturned to look for Athos; but Athos had disappeared.\r\n\r\nFaithful to his mission of vengeance, Athos had requested to be\r\nconducted to the garden; and there upon the sand following the light\r\nsteps of this woman, who left sharp tracks wherever she went, he\r\nadvanced toward the gate which led into the wood, and causing it to be\r\nopened, he went out into the forest.\r\n\r\nThen all his suspicions were confirmed; the road by which the carriage\r\nhad disappeared encircled the forest. Athos followed the road for some\r\ntime, his eyes fixed upon the ground; slight stains of blood, which\r\ncame from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage\r\nas a courier, or from one of the horses, dotted the road. At the end of\r\nthree-quarters of a league, within fifty paces of Festubert, a larger\r\nbloodstain appeared; the ground was trampled by horses. Between the\r\nforest and this accursed spot, a little behind the trampled ground, was\r\nthe same track of small feet as in the garden; the carriage had stopped\r\nhere. At this spot Milady had come out of the wood, and entered the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nSatisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions, Athos\r\nreturned to the h\xc3\xb4tel, and found Planchet impatiently waiting for him.\r\n\r\nEverything was as Athos had foreseen.\r\n\r\nPlanchet had followed the road; like Athos, he had discovered the\r\nstains of blood; like Athos, he had noted the spot where the horses had\r\nhalted. But he had gone farther than Athos\xe2\x80\x94for at the village of\r\nFestubert, while drinking at an inn, he had learned without needing to\r\nask a question that the evening before, at half-past eight, a wounded\r\nman who accompanied a lady traveling in a post-chaise had been obliged\r\nto stop, unable to go further. The accident was set down to the account\r\nof robbers, who had stopped the chaise in the wood. The man remained in\r\nthe village; the woman had had a relay of horses, and continued her\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nPlanchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her, and found\r\nhim. He had taken the lady as far as Fromelles; and from Fromelles she\r\nhad set out for Armenti\xc3\xa8res. Planchet took the crossroad, and by seven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning he was at Armenti\xc3\xa8res.\r\n\r\nThere was but one tavern, the Post. Planchet went and presented himself\r\nas a lackey out of a place, who was in search of a situation. He had\r\nnot chatted ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned\r\nthat a woman had come there alone about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the night\r\nbefore, had engaged a chamber, had sent for the master of the h\xc3\xb4tel,\r\nand told him she desired to remain some time in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nPlanchet had no need to learn more. He hastened to the rendezvous,\r\nfound the lackeys at their posts, placed them as sentinels at all the\r\noutlets of the h\xc3\xb4tel, and came to find Athos, who had just received\r\nthis information when his friends returned.\r\n\r\nAll their countenances were melancholy and gloomy, even the mild\r\ncountenance of Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo wait!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos.\r\n\r\nEach retired to his own apartment.\r\n\r\nAt eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening Athos ordered the horses to be saddled,\r\nand Lord de Winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for\r\nthe expedition.\r\n\r\nIn an instant all five were ready. Each examined his arms, and put them\r\nin order. Athos came down last, and found D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan already on\r\nhorseback, and growing impatient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatience!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cone of our party is still wanting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe four horsemen looked round them with astonishment, for they sought\r\nvainly in their minds to know who this other person could be.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Planchet brought out Athos\xe2\x80\x99s horse; the Musketeer leaped\r\nlightly into the saddle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait for me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9cI will soon be back,\xe2\x80\x9d and he set off at a\r\ngallop.\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of an hour he returned, accompanied by a tall man, masked,\r\nand wrapped in a large red cloak.\r\n\r\nLord de Winter and the three Musketeers looked at one another\r\ninquiringly. Neither could give the others any information, for all\r\nwere ignorant who this man could be; nevertheless, they felt convinced\r\nthat all was as it should be, as it was done by the order of Athos.\r\n\r\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, guided by Planchet, the little cavalcade set out,\r\ntaking the route the carriage had taken.\r\n\r\nIt was a melancholy sight\xe2\x80\x94that of these six men, traveling in silence,\r\neach plunged in his own thoughts, sad as despair, gloomy as\r\nchastisement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LXV.\r\nTRIAL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a stormy and dark night; vast clouds covered the heavens,\r\nconcealing the stars; the moon would not rise till midnight.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along\r\nthe horizon, the road stretched itself before them, white and solitary;\r\nthe flash extinct, all remained in darkness.\r\n\r\nEvery minute Athos was forced to restrain D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, constantly in\r\nadvance of the little troop, and to beg him to keep in the line, which\r\nin an instant he again departed from. He had but one thought\xe2\x80\x94to go\r\nforward; and he went.\r\n\r\nThey passed in silence through the little village of Festubert, where\r\nthe wounded servant was, and then skirted the wood of Richebourg. At\r\nHerlier, Planchet, who led the column, turned to the left.\r\n\r\nSeveral times Lord de Winter, Porthos, or Aramis tried to talk with the\r\nman in the red cloak; but to every interrogation which they put to him\r\nhe bowed, without response. The travelers then comprehended that there\r\nmust be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence, and\r\nceased to address themselves to him.\r\n\r\nThe storm increased, the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly,\r\nthe thunder began to growl, and the wind, the precursor of a hurricane,\r\nwhistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen.\r\n\r\nThe cavalcade trotted on more sharply.\r\n\r\nA little before they came to Fromelles the storm burst. They spread\r\ntheir cloaks. There remained three leagues to travel, and they did it\r\namid torrents of rain.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan took off his hat, and could not be persuaded to make use of\r\nhis cloak. He found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his\r\nburning brow and over his body, agitated by feverish shudders.\r\n\r\nThe moment the little troop passed Goskal and were approaching the\r\nPost, a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk\r\nwith which he had been confounded in the darkness, and advanced into\r\nthe middle of the road, putting his finger on his lips.\r\n\r\nAthos recognized Grimaud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the manner?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cHas she left Armenti\xc3\xa8res?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrimaud made a sign in the affirmative. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan ground his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cI have charged myself with this\r\naffair. It is for me, then, to interrogate Grimaud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Athos.\r\n\r\nGrimaud extended his hands in the direction of the Lys. \xe2\x80\x9cFar from\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Athos.\r\n\r\nGrimaud showed his master his forefinger bent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Athos.\r\n\r\nGrimaud made the sign yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is alone within half a league of us, in\r\nthe direction of the river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s well,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cLead us, Grimaud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrimaud took his course across the country, and acted as guide to the\r\ncavalcade.\r\n\r\nAt the end of five hundred paces, more or less, they came to a rivulet,\r\nwhich they forded.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of Erquinheim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she there, Grimaud?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Athos.\r\n\r\nGrimaud shook his head negatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence, then!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Athos.\r\n\r\nAnd the troop continued their route.\r\n\r\nAnother flash illuminated all around them. Grimaud extended his arm,\r\nand by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a\r\nlittle isolated house on the banks of the river, within a hundred paces\r\nof a ferry.\r\n\r\nOne window was lighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and\r\ncame towards them. It was Mousqueton. He pointed his finger to the\r\nlighted window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is there,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Bazin?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile I watched the window, he guarded the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are good and faithful servants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos sprang from his horse, gave the bridle to Grimaud, and advanced\r\ntoward the window, after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to\r\ngo toward the door.\r\n\r\nThe little house was surrounded by a low, quickset hedge, two or three\r\nfeet high. Athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window, which\r\nwas without shutters, but had the half-curtains closely drawn.\r\n\r\nHe mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the\r\ncurtain.\r\n\r\nBy the light of a lamp he saw a woman, wrapped in a dark mantle, seated\r\nupon a stool near a dying fire. Her elbows were placed upon a mean\r\ntable, and she leaned her head upon her two hands, which were white as\r\nivory.\r\n\r\nHe could not distinguish her countenance, but a sinister smile passed\r\nover the lips of Athos. He was not deceived; it was she whom he sought.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a horse neighed. Milady raised her head, saw close to\r\nthe panes the pale face of Athos, and screamed.\r\n\r\nAthos, perceiving that she knew him, pushed the window with his knee\r\nand hand. The window yielded. The squares were broken to shivers; and\r\nAthos, like the spectre of vengeance, leaped into the room.\r\n\r\nMilady rushed to the door and opened it. More pale and menacing than\r\nAthos, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan stood on the threshold.\r\n\r\nMilady recoiled, uttering a cry. D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, believing she might have\r\nmeans of flight and fearing she should escape, drew a pistol from his\r\nbelt; but Athos raised his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut back that weapon, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan!\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cthis woman must be tried,\r\nnot assassinated. Wait an instant, my friend, and you shall be\r\nsatisfied. Come in, gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan obeyed; for Athos had the solemn voice and the powerful\r\ngesture of a judge sent by the Lord himself. Behind D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan entered\r\nPorthos, Aramis, Lord de Winter, and the man in the red cloak.\r\n\r\nThe four lackeys guarded the door and the window.\r\n\r\nMilady had sunk into a chair, with her hands extended, as if to conjure\r\nthis terrible apparition. Perceiving her brother-in-law, she uttered a\r\nterrible cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cCharlotte Backson, who first was called\r\nComtesse de la F\xc3\xa8re, and afterwards Milady de Winter, Baroness of\r\nSheffield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is I! that is I!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Milady, in extreme terror; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do\r\nyou want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe wish to judge you according to your crime,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall\r\nbe free to defend yourself. Justify yourself if you can. M. d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\nit is for you to accuse her first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan advanced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore God and before men,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI accuse this woman of having\r\npoisoned Constance Bonacieux, who died yesterday evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned towards Porthos and Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe bear witness to this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the two Musketeers, with one voice.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan continued: \xe2\x80\x9cBefore God and before men, I accuse this woman\r\nof having attempted to poison me, in wine which she sent me from\r\nVilleroy, with a forged letter, as if that wine came from my friends.\r\nGod preserved me, but a man named Brisemont died in my place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe bear witness to this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porthos and Aramis, in the same manner\r\nas before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore God and before men, I accuse this woman of having urged me to\r\nthe murder of the Baron de Wardes; but as no one else can attest the\r\ntruth of this accusation, I attest it myself. I have done.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan passed to the other side of the room with Porthos and\r\nAramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour turn, my Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\nThe baron came forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore God and before men,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI accuse this woman of having\r\ncaused the assassination of the Duke of Buckingham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Duke of Buckingham assassinated!\xe2\x80\x9d cried all present, with one\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the baron, \xe2\x80\x9cassassinated. On receiving the warning letter\r\nyou wrote to me, I had this woman arrested, and gave her in charge to a\r\nloyal servant. She corrupted this man; she placed the poniard in his\r\nhand; she made him kill the duke. And at this moment, perhaps, Felton\r\nis paying with his head for the crime of this fury!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown\r\ncrimes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not all,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Lord de Winter. \xe2\x80\x9cMy brother, who made you\r\nhis heir, died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid\r\ntraces all over the body. My sister, how did your husband die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorror!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Porthos and Aramis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssassin of Buckingham, assassin of Felton, assassin of my brother, I\r\ndemand justice upon you, and I swear that if it be not granted to me, I\r\nwill execute it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Lord de Winter ranged himself by the side of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, leaving\r\nthe place free for another accuser.\r\n\r\nMilady let her head sink between her two hands, and tried to recall her\r\nideas, whirling in a mortal vertigo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy turn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, himself trembling as the lion trembles at the\r\nsight of the serpent\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmy turn. I married that woman when she was a\r\nyoung girl; I married her in opposition to the wishes of all my family;\r\nI gave her my wealth, I gave her my name; and one day I discovered that\r\nthis woman was branded\xe2\x80\x94this woman was marked with a _fleur-de-lis_ on\r\nher left shoulder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady, raising herself, \xe2\x80\x9cI defy you to find any tribunal\r\nwhich pronounced that infamous sentence against me. I defy you to find\r\nhim who executed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d said a hollow voice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is for me to reply to that!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthe man in the red cloak came forward in his turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat man is that? What man is that?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, suffocated by\r\nterror, her hair loosening itself, and rising above her livid\r\ncountenance as if alive.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned towards this man\xe2\x80\x94for to all except Athos he was\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nEven Athos looked at him with as much stupefaction as the others, for\r\nhe knew not how he could in any way find himself mixed up with the\r\nhorrible drama then unfolded.\r\n\r\nAfter approaching Milady with a slow and solemn step, so that the table\r\nalone separated them, the unknown took off his mask.\r\n\r\nMilady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face,\r\nframed with black hair and whiskers, the only expression of which was\r\nicy impassibility. Then she suddenly cried, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d rising and\r\nretreating to the very wall. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! it is an infernal apparition! It\r\nis not he! Help, help!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed she, turning towards the wall, as if\r\nshe would tear an opening with her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you, then?\xe2\x80\x9d cried all the witnesses of this scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk that woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man in the red cloak, \xe2\x80\x9cfor you may plainly\r\nsee she knows me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe executioner of Lille, the executioner of Lille!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, a\r\nprey to insensate terror, and clinging with her hands to the wall to\r\navoid falling.\r\n\r\nEveryone drew back, and the man in the red cloak remained standing\r\nalone in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, grace, grace, pardon!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the wretch, falling on her knees.\r\n\r\nThe unknown waited for silence, and then resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cI told you well that\r\nshe would know me. Yes, I am the executioner of Lille, and this is my\r\nhistory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll eyes were fixed upon this man, whose words were listened to with\r\nanxious attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat woman was once a young girl, as beautiful as she is today. She\r\nwas a nun in the convent of the Benedictines of Templemar. A young\r\npriest, with a simple and trustful heart, performed the duties of the\r\nchurch of that convent. She undertook his seduction, and succeeded; she\r\nwould have seduced a saint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir vows were sacred and irrevocable. Their connection could not\r\nlast long without ruining both. She prevailed upon him to leave the\r\ncountry; but to leave the country, to fly together, to reach another\r\npart of France, where they might live at ease because unknown, money\r\nwas necessary. Neither had any. The priest stole the sacred vases, and\r\nsold them; but as they were preparing to escape together, they were\r\nboth arrested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight days later she had seduced the son of the jailer, and escaped.\r\nThe young priest was condemned to ten years of imprisonment, and to be\r\nbranded. I was executioner of the city of Lille, as this woman has\r\nsaid. I was obliged to brand the guilty one; and he, gentlemen, was my\r\nbrother!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI then swore that this woman who had ruined him, who was more than his\r\naccomplice, since she had urged him to the crime, should at least share\r\nhis punishment. I suspected where she was concealed. I followed her, I\r\ncaught her, I bound her; and I imprinted the same disgraceful mark upon\r\nher that I had imprinted upon my poor brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day after my return to Lille, my brother in his turn succeeded in\r\nmaking his escape; I was accused of complicity, and was condemned to\r\nremain in his place till he should be again a prisoner. My poor brother\r\nwas ignorant of this sentence. He rejoined this woman; they fled\r\ntogether into Berry, and there he obtained a little curacy. This woman\r\npassed for his sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated\r\nsaw this pretend sister, and became enamoured of her\xe2\x80\x94amorous to such a\r\ndegree that he proposed to marry her. Then she quitted him she had\r\nruined for him she was destined to ruin, and became the Comtesse de la\r\nF\xc3\xa8re\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned towards Athos, whose real name that was, and who\r\nmade a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed he, \xe2\x80\x9cmad, desperate, determined to get rid of an\r\nexistence from which she had stolen everything, honor and happiness, my\r\npoor brother returned to Lille, and learning the sentence which had\r\ncondemned me in his place, surrendered himself, and hanged himself that\r\nsame night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo do justice to them who had condemned me, they kept their word. As\r\nsoon as the identity of my brother was proved, I was set at liberty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the crime of which I accuse her; that is the cause for which\r\nshe was branded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the penalty you demand\r\nagainst this woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe punishment of death,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord de Winter,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the penalty you demand\r\nagainst this woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe punishment of death,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lord de Winter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMessieurs Porthos and Aramis,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cyou who are her\r\njudges, what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe punishment of death,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Musketeers, in a hollow voice.\r\n\r\nMilady uttered a frightful shriek, and dragged herself along several\r\npaces upon her knees toward her judges.\r\n\r\nAthos stretched out his hand toward her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharlotte Backson, Comtesse de la F\xc3\xa8re, Milady de Winter,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyour crimes have wearied men on earth and God in heaven. If you know a\r\nprayer, say it\xe2\x80\x94for you are condemned, and you shall die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words, which left no hope, Milady raised herself in all her\r\npride, and wished to speak; but her strength failed her. She felt that\r\na powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair, and dragged her\r\naway as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity. She did not, therefore,\r\neven attempt the least resistance, and went out of the cottage.\r\n\r\nLord de Winter, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, went out close\r\nbehind her. The lackeys followed their masters, and the chamber was\r\nleft solitary, with its broken window, its open door, and its smoky\r\nlamp burning sadly on the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LXVI.\r\nEXECUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was near midnight; the moon, lessened by its decline, and reddened\r\nby the last traces of the storm, arose behind the little town of\r\nArmenti\xc3\xa8res, which showed against its pale light the dark outline of\r\nits houses, and the skeleton of its high belfry. In front of them the\r\nLys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin; while on the other\r\nside was a black mass of trees, profiled on a stormy sky, invaded by\r\nlarge coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night.\r\nOn the left was an old abandoned mill, with its motionless wings, from\r\nthe ruins of which an owl threw out its shrill, periodical, and\r\nmonotonous cry. On the right and on the left of the road, which the\r\ndismal procession pursued, appeared a few low, stunted trees, which\r\nlooked like deformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at\r\nthis sinister hour.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its\r\nwhole width, darted like a serpent over the black mass of trees, and\r\nlike a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two\r\nparts. Not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere. A\r\ndeathlike silence oppressed all nature. The soil was humid and\r\nglittering with the rain which had recently fallen, and the refreshed\r\nherbs sent forth their perfume with additional energy.\r\n\r\nTwo lackeys dragged Milady, whom each held by one arm. The executioner\r\nwalked behind them, and Lord de Winter, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis\r\nwalked behind the executioner. Planchet and Bazin came last.\r\n\r\nThe two lackeys conducted Milady to the bank of the river. Her mouth\r\nwas mute; but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence,\r\nsupplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked.\r\n\r\nBeing a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys, \xe2\x80\x9cA thousand\r\npistoles to each of you, if you will assist my escape; but if you\r\ndeliver me up to your masters, I have near at hand avengers who will\r\nmake you pay dearly for my death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrimaud hesitated. Mousqueton trembled in all his members.\r\n\r\nAthos, who heard Milady\xe2\x80\x99s voice, came sharply up. Lord de Winter did\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChange these lackeys,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cshe has spoken to them. They are no\r\nlonger sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPlanchet and Bazin were called, and took the places of Grimaud and\r\nMousqueton.\r\n\r\nOn the bank of the river the executioner approached Milady, and bound\r\nher hands and feet.\r\n\r\nThen she broke the silence to cry out, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are cowards, miserable\r\nassassins\xe2\x80\x94ten men combined to murder one woman. Beware! If I am not\r\nsaved I shall be avenged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, coldly and sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not\r\nbelong to the human species; you are a demon escaped from hell, whither\r\nwe send you back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you virtuous men!\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady; \xe2\x80\x9cplease to remember that he who\r\nshall touch a hair of my head is himself an assassin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe executioner may kill, without being on that account an assassin,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the man in the red cloak, rapping upon his immense sword. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nthe last judge; that is all. _Nachrichter_, as say our neighbors, the\r\nGermans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as he bound her while saying these words, Milady uttered two or\r\nthree savage cries, which produced a strange and melancholy effect in\r\nflying away into the night, and losing themselves in the depths of the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am guilty, if I have committed the crimes you accuse me of,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshrieked Milady, \xe2\x80\x9ctake me before a tribunal. You are not judges! You\r\ncannot condemn me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI offered you Tyburn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord de Winter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you not accept\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am not willing to die!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Milady, struggling. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\r\nam too young to die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman you poisoned at B\xc3\xa9thune was still younger than you, madame,\r\nand yet she is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will enter a cloister; I will become a nun,\xe2\x80\x9d said Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were in a cloister,\xe2\x80\x9d said the executioner, \xe2\x80\x9cand you left it to\r\nruin my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady uttered a cry of terror and sank upon her knees. The executioner\r\ntook her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the boat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, \xe2\x80\x9cmy God! are you going to drown me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese cries had something so heartrending in them that M. d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\nwho had been at first the most eager in pursuit of Milady, sat down on\r\nthe stump of a tree and hung his head, covering his ears with the palms\r\nof his hands; and yet, notwithstanding, he could still hear her cry and\r\nthreaten.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was the youngest of all these men. His heart failed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I cannot behold this frightful spectacle!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot\r\nconsent that this woman should die thus!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she; \xe2\x80\x9cremember that I loved you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man rose and took a step toward her.\r\n\r\nBut Athos rose likewise, drew his sword, and placed himself in the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you take one step farther, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall cross\r\nswords together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan sank on his knees and prayed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Athos, \xe2\x80\x9cexecutioner, do your duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillingly, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the executioner; \xe2\x80\x9cfor as I am a good\r\nCatholic, I firmly believe I am acting justly in performing my\r\nfunctions on this woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos made a step toward Milady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pardon you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe ill you have done me. I pardon you for my\r\nblasted future, my lost honor, my defiled love, and my salvation\r\nforever compromised by the despair into which you have cast me. Die in\r\npeace!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord de Winter advanced in his turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pardon you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the poisoning of my brother, and the\r\nassassination of his Grace, Lord Buckingham. I pardon you for the death\r\nof poor Felton; I pardon you for the attempts upon my own person. Die\r\nin peace!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said M. d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, madame, for having by a trick\r\nunworthy of a gentleman provoked your anger; and I, in exchange, pardon\r\nyou the murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me. I\r\npardon you, and I weep for you. Die in peace!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am lost!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Milady in English. \xe2\x80\x9cI must die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she arose of herself, and cast around her one of those piercing\r\nlooks which seemed to dart from an eye of flame.\r\n\r\nShe saw nothing; she listened, and she heard nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I to die?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the other bank,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the executioner.\r\n\r\nThen he placed her in the boat, and as he was going to set foot in it\r\nhimself, Athos handed him a sum of silver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cis the price of the execution, that it may be plain\r\nwe act as judges.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is correct,\xe2\x80\x9d said the executioner; \xe2\x80\x9cand now in her turn, let this\r\nwoman see that I am not fulfilling my trade, but my debt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he threw the money into the river.\r\n\r\nThe boat moved off toward the left-hand shore of the Lys, bearing the\r\nguilty woman and the executioner; all the others remained on the\r\nright-hand bank, where they fell on their knees.\r\n\r\nThe boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud\r\nwhich hung over the water at that moment.\r\n\r\nThe troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank; the figures were\r\ndefined like black shadows on the red-tinted horizon.\r\n\r\nMilady, during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which\r\nfastened her feet. On coming near the bank, she jumped lightly on shore\r\nand took to flight. But the soil was moist; on reaching the top of the\r\nbank, she slipped and fell upon her knees.\r\n\r\nShe was struck, no doubt, with a superstitious idea; she conceived that\r\nheaven denied its aid, and she remained in the attitude in which she\r\nhad fallen, her head drooping and her hands clasped.\r\n\r\nThen they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms\r\nslowly; a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large sword. The two arms\r\nfell with a sudden force; they heard the hissing of the scimitar and\r\nthe cry of the victim, then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow.\r\n\r\nThe executioner then took off his red cloak, spread it upon the ground,\r\nlaid the body in it, threw in the head, tied all up by the four\r\ncorners, lifted it on his back, and entered the boat again.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the stream he stopped the boat, and suspending his\r\nburden over the water cried in a loud voice, \xe2\x80\x9cLet the justice of God be\r\ndone!\xe2\x80\x9d and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters, which\r\nclosed over it.\r\n\r\nThree days afterward the four Musketeers were in Paris; they had not\r\nexceeded their leave of absence, and that same evening they went to pay\r\ntheir customary visit to M. de Tr\xc3\xa9ville.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the brave captain, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you have been well\r\namused during your excursion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProdigiously,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos in the name of himself and his comrades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LXVII.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the sixth of the following month the king, in compliance with the\r\npromise he had made the cardinal to return to La Rochelle, left his\r\ncapital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of\r\nBuckingham\xe2\x80\x99s assassination.\r\n\r\nAlthough warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger,\r\nthe queen, when his death was announced to her, would not believe the\r\nfact, and even imprudently exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cit is false; he has just written\r\nto me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence;\r\nLaporte, detained in England, as everyone else had been, by the orders\r\nof Charles I., arrived, and was the bearer of the duke\xe2\x80\x99s dying gift to\r\nthe queen.\r\n\r\nThe joy of the king was lively. He did not even give himself the\r\ntrouble to dissemble, and displayed it with affectation before the\r\nqueen. Louis XIII., like every weak mind, was wanting in generosity.\r\n\r\nBut the king soon again became dull and indisposed; his brow was not\r\none of those that long remain clear. He felt that in returning to camp\r\nhe should re-enter slavery; nevertheless, he did return.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent, and himself the bird\r\nwhich flies from branch to branch without power to escape.\r\n\r\nThe return to La Rochelle, therefore, was profoundly dull. Our four\r\nfriends, in particular, astonished their comrades; they traveled\r\ntogether, side by side, with sad eyes and heads lowered. Athos alone\r\nfrom time to time raised his expansive brow; a flash kindled in his\r\neyes, and a bitter smile passed over his lips, then, like his comrades,\r\nhe sank again into reverie.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the escort arrived in a city, when they had conducted the\r\nking to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to\r\nsome secluded cabaret, where they neither drank nor played; they only\r\nconversed in a low voice, looking around attentively to see that no one\r\noverheard them.\r\n\r\nOne day, when the king had halted to fly the magpie, and the four\r\nfriends, according to their custom, instead of following the sport had\r\nstopped at a cabaret on the high road, a man coming from la Rochelle on\r\nhorseback pulled up at the door to drink a glass of wine, and darted a\r\nsearching glance into the room where the four Musketeers were sitting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHolloa, Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cis not that you whom I see\r\nyonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan raised his head and uttered a cry of joy. It was the man he\r\ncalled his phantom; it was his stranger of Meung, of the Rue des\r\nFossoyeurs and of Arras.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan drew his sword, and sprang toward the door.\r\n\r\nBut this time, instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his\r\nhorse, and advanced to meet D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cI meet you, then, at last! This\r\ntime you shall not escape me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither is it my intention, monsieur, for this time I was seeking you;\r\nin the name of the king, I arrest you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow! what do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say that you must surrender your sword to me, monsieur, and that\r\nwithout resistance. This concerns your head, I warn you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you, then?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, lowering the point of his\r\nsword, but without yet surrendering it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the Chevalier de Rochefort,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the other, \xe2\x80\x9cthe equerry of\r\nMonsieur le Cardinal Richelieu, and I have orders to conduct you to his\r\nEminence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are returning to his Eminence, monsieur the Chevalier,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos,\r\nadvancing; \xe2\x80\x9cand you will please to accept the word of Monsieur\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan that he will go straight to La Rochelle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into camp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will be his guards, monsieur, upon our word as gentlemen; but\r\nlikewise, upon our word as gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d added Athos, knitting his brow,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan shall not leave us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier de Rochefort cast a glance backward, and saw that Porthos\r\nand Aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate; he\r\nunderstood that he was completely at the mercy of these four men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cif Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan will surrender his sword\r\nto me and join his word to yours, I shall be satisfied with your\r\npromise to convey Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to the quarters of Monseigneur\r\nthe Cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have my word, monsieur, and here is my sword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis suits me the better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rochefort, \xe2\x80\x9cas I wish to continue my\r\njourney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is for the purpose of rejoining Milady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, coolly, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nis useless; you will not find her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has become of her, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rochefort, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReturn to camp and you shall know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRochefort remained for a moment in thought; then, as they were only a\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s journey from Surg\xc3\xa8res, whither the cardinal was to come to meet\r\nthe king, he resolved to follow the advice of Athos and go with them.\r\nBesides, this return offered him the advantage of watching his\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nThey resumed their route.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon, they arrived at\r\nSurg\xc3\xa8res. The cardinal there awaited Louis XIII. The minister and the\r\nking exchanged numerous caresses, felicitating each other upon the\r\nfortunate chance which had freed France from the inveterate enemy who\r\nset all Europe against her. After which, the cardinal, who had been\r\ninformed that D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him,\r\ntook leave of the king, inviting him to come the next day to view the\r\nwork already done upon the dyke.\r\n\r\nOn returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of La Pierre,\r\nthe cardinal found, standing before the house he occupied, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\r\nwithout his sword, and the three Musketeers armed.\r\n\r\nThis time, as he was well attended, he looked at them sternly, and made\r\na sign with his eye and hand for D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to follow him.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan obeyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall wait for you, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos, loud enough for the\r\ncardinal to hear him.\r\n\r\nHis Eminence bent his brow, stopped for an instant, and then kept on\r\nhis way without uttering a single word.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan entered after the cardinal, and behind D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan the door\r\nwas guarded.\r\n\r\nHis Eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study, and made\r\na sign to Rochefort to bring in the young Musketeer.\r\n\r\nRochefort obeyed and retired.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal; this was his second\r\ninterview with Richelieu, and he afterward confessed that he felt well\r\nassured it would be his last.\r\n\r\nRichelieu remained standing, leaning against the mantelpiece; a table\r\nwas between him and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have been arrested by my orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they tell me, monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monseigneur, for the only thing for which I could be arrested is\r\nstill unknown to your Eminence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRichelieu looked steadfastly at the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHolloa!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does that mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me, in the first place,\r\nwhat crimes are imputed to me, I will then tell him the deeds I have\r\nreally done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads\r\nthan yours, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, monseigneur?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, with a calmness which astonished\r\nthe cardinal himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the\r\nkingdom; you are charged with having surprised state secrets; you are\r\ncharged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who charges me with this, monseigneur?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, who had\r\nno doubt the accusation came from Milady, \xe2\x80\x9ca woman branded by the\r\njustice of the country; a woman who has espoused one man in France and\r\nanother in England; a woman who poisoned her second husband and who\r\nattempted both to poison and assassinate me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the cardinal, astonished; \xe2\x80\x9cand of\r\nwhat woman are you speaking thus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf Milady de Winter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, of Milady de Winter,\r\nof whose crimes your Eminence is doubtless ignorant, since you have\r\nhonored her with your confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cif Milady de Winter has committed the\r\ncrimes you lay to her charge, she shall be punished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been punished, monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who has punished her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is in prison?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the cardinal, who could not believe what he heard,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdead! Did you not say she was dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree times she attempted to kill me, and I pardoned her; but she\r\nmurdered the woman I loved. Then my friends and I took her, tried her,\r\nand condemned her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan then related the poisoning of Mme. Bonacieux in the convent\r\nof the Carmelites at B\xc3\xa9thune, the trial in the isolated house, and the\r\nexecution on the banks of the Lys.\r\n\r\nA shudder crept through the body of the cardinal, who did not shudder\r\nreadily.\r\n\r\nBut all at once, as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought,\r\nthe countenance of the cardinal, till then gloomy, cleared up by\r\ndegrees, and recovered perfect serenity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, in a tone that contrasted strongly with the\r\nseverity of his words, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have constituted yourselves judges, without\r\nremembering that they who punish without license to punish are\r\nassassins?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur, I swear to you that I never for an instant had the\r\nintention of defending my head against you. I willingly submit to any\r\npunishment your Eminence may please to inflict upon me. I do not hold\r\nlife dear enough to be afraid of death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know you are a man of a stout heart, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ncardinal, with a voice almost affectionate; \xe2\x80\x9cI can therefore tell you\r\nbeforehand you shall be tried, and even condemned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother might reply to your Eminence that he had his pardon in his\r\npocket. I content myself with saying: Command, monseigneur; I am\r\nready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour pardon?\xe2\x80\x9d said Richelieu, surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd signed by whom\xe2\x80\x94by the king?\xe2\x80\x9d And the cardinal pronounced these\r\nwords with a singular expression of contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, by your Eminence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy me? You are insane, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper\r\nwhich Athos had forced from Milady, and which he had given to\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to serve him as a safeguard.\r\n\r\nHis Eminence took the paper, and read in a slow voice, dwelling upon\r\nevery syllable:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDec. 3, 1627\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of\r\nthis has done what he has done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRICHELIEU\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cardinal, after having read these two lines, sank into a profound\r\nreverie; but he did not return the paper to D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Gascon to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, my faith! he shall see how a\r\ngentleman can die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young Musketeer was in excellent disposition to die heroically.\r\n\r\nRichelieu still continued thinking, rolling and unrolling the paper in\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\nAt length he raised his head, fixed his eagle look upon that loyal,\r\nopen, and intelligent countenance, read upon that face, furrowed with\r\ntears, all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a\r\nmonth, and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in\r\nthat youth of twenty-one years before him, and what resources his\r\nactivity, his courage, and his shrewdness might offer to a good master.\r\nOn the other side, the crimes, the power, and the infernal genius of\r\nMilady had more than once terrified him. He felt something like a\r\nsecret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice.\r\n\r\nRichelieu slowly tore the paper which D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan had generously\r\nrelinquished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am lost!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan to himself. And he bowed profoundly before\r\nthe cardinal, like a man who says, \xe2\x80\x9cLord, Thy will be done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cardinal approached the table, and without sitting down, wrote a\r\nfew lines upon a parchment of which two-thirds were already filled, and\r\naffixed his seal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my condemnation,\xe2\x80\x9d thought D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9che will spare me the\r\n_ennui_ of the Bastille, or the tediousness of a trial. That\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nkind of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal to the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cI have taken\r\nfrom you one _carte blanche_ to give you another. The name is wanting\r\nin this commission; you can write it yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it; it\r\nwas a lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s commission in the Musketeers.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cmy life is yours; henceforth dispose of it.\r\nBut this favor which you bestow upon me I do not merit. I have three\r\nfriends who are more meritorious and more worthy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a brave youth, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the cardinal, tapping\r\nhim familiarly on the shoulder, charmed at having vanquished this\r\nrebellious nature. \xe2\x80\x9cDo with this commission what you will; only\r\nremember, though the name be blank, it is to you I give it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never forget it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. \xe2\x80\x9cYour Eminence may be\r\ncertain of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cardinal turned and said in a loud voice, \xe2\x80\x9cRochefort!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nchevalier, who no doubt was near the door, entered immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRochefort,\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see Monsieur d\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan. I receive\r\nhim among the number of my friends. Greet each other, then; and be wise\r\nif you wish to preserve your heads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRochefort and D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips; but\r\nthe cardinal was there, observing them with his vigilant eye.\r\n\r\nThey left the chamber at the same time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall meet again, shall we not, monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn opportunity will come,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rochefort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey?\xe2\x80\x9d said the cardinal, opening the door.\r\n\r\nThe two men smiled at each other, shook hands, and saluted his\r\nEminence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were beginning to grow impatient,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cnot only free, but in\r\nfavor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell us about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis evening; but for the moment, let us separate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, that same evening D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan repaired to the quarters of\r\nAthos, whom he found in a fair way to empty a bottle of Spanish wine\xe2\x80\x94an\r\noccupation which he religiously accomplished every night.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and\r\nhimself, and drawing the commission from his pocket, said, \xe2\x80\x9cHere, my\r\ndear Athos, this naturally belongs to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cfor Athos this is too much; for the Comte de la\r\nF\xc3\xa8re it is too little. Keep the commission; it is yours. Alas! you have\r\npurchased it dearly enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan left Athos\xe2\x80\x99s chamber and went to that of Porthos. He found\r\nhim clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery,\r\nadmiring himself before a glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah! is that you, dear friend?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Porthos. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you\r\nthink these garments fit me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonderfully,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I come to offer you a dress which\r\nwill become you still better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Porthos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat of a lieutenant of Musketeers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan related to Porthos the substance of his interview with the\r\ncardinal, and said, taking the commission from his pocket, \xe2\x80\x9cHere, my\r\nfriend, write your name upon it and become my chief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPorthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, to the great astonishment of the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, that would flatter me very much; but I should not\r\nhave time enough to enjoy the distinction. During our expedition to\r\nB\xc3\xa9thune the husband of my duchess died; so, my dear, the coffer of the\r\ndefunct holding out its arms to me, I shall marry the widow. Look here!\r\nI was trying on my wedding suit. Keep the lieutenancy, my dear, keep\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man then entered the apartment of Aramis. He found him\r\nkneeling before a _priedieu_, with his head leaning on an open prayer\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nHe described to him his interview with the cardinal, and said, for the\r\nthird time drawing his commission from his pocket, \xe2\x80\x9cYou, our friend,\r\nour intelligence, our invisible protector, accept this commission. You\r\nhave merited it more than any of us by your wisdom and your counsels,\r\nalways followed by such happy results.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, dear friend!\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramis, \xe2\x80\x9cour late adventures have disgusted\r\nme with military life. This time my determination is irrevocably taken.\r\nAfter the siege I shall enter the house of the Lazarists. Keep the\r\ncommission, D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan; the profession of arms suits you. You will be a\r\nbrave and adventurous captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan, his eye moist with gratitude though beaming with joy, went\r\nback to Athos, whom he found still at table contemplating the charms of\r\nhis last glass of Malaga by the light of his lamp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthey likewise have refused me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, dear friend, is because nobody is more worthy than yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took a quill, wrote the name of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan in the commission, and\r\nreturned it to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall then have no more friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cAlas! nothing\r\nbut bitter recollections.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he let his head sink upon his hands, while two large tears rolled\r\ndown his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are young,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athos; \xe2\x80\x9cand your bitter recollections have\r\ntime to change themselves into sweet remembrances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Rochelle, deprived of the assistance of the English fleet and of the\r\ndiversion promised by Buckingham, surrendered after a siege of a year.\r\nOn the twenty-eighth of October, 1628, the capitulation was signed.\r\n\r\nThe king made his entrance into Paris on the twenty-third of December\r\nof the same year. He was received in triumph, as if he came from\r\nconquering an enemy and not Frenchmen. He entered by the Faubourg St.\r\nJacques, under verdant arches.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan took possession of his command. Porthos left the service,\r\nand in the course of the following year married Mme. Coquenard; the\r\ncoffer so much coveted contained eight hundred thousand livres.\r\n\r\nMousqueton had a magnificent livery, and enjoyed the satisfaction of\r\nwhich he had been ambitious all his life\xe2\x80\x94that of standing behind a\r\ngilded carriage.\r\n\r\nAramis, after a journey into Lorraine, disappeared all at once, and\r\nceased to write to his friends; they learned at a later period through\r\nMme. de Chevreuse, who told it to two or three of her intimates, that,\r\nyielding to his vocation, he had retired into a convent\xe2\x80\x94only into\r\nwhich, nobody knew.\r\n\r\nBazin became a lay brother.\r\n\r\nAthos remained a Musketeer under the command of D\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan till the\r\nyear 1633, at which period, after a journey he made to Touraine, he\r\nalso quit the service, under the pretext of having inherited a small\r\nproperty in Roussillon.\r\n\r\nGrimaud followed Athos.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Artagnan fought three times with Rochefort, and wounded him three\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall probably kill you the fourth,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to him, holding out his\r\nhand to assist him to rise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is much better both for you and for me to stop where we are,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered the wounded man. \xe2\x80\x9c_Corbleu!_ I am more your friend than you\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94for after our very first encounter, I could by saying a word to\r\nthe cardinal have had your throat cut!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey this time embraced heartily, and without retaining any malice.\r\n\r\nPlanchet obtained from Rochefort the rank of sergeant in the Piedmont\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\nM. Bonacieux lived on very quietly, wholly ignorant of what had become\r\nof his wife, and caring very little about it. One day he had the\r\nimprudence to recall himself to the memory of the cardinal. The\r\ncardinal had him informed that he would provide for him so that he\r\nshould never want for anything in future. In fact, M. Bonacieux, having\r\nleft his house at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening to go to the Louvre,\r\nnever appeared again in the Rue des Fossoyeurs; the opinion of those\r\nwho seemed to be best informed was that he was fed and lodged in some\r\nroyal castle, at the expense of his generous Eminence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE THREE MUSKETEERS ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
