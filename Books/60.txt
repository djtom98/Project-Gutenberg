THE ESCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nPARIS: SEPTEMBER, 1792\r\n\r\n\r\nA surging, seething, murmuring crowd of beings that are human only in\r\nname, for to the eye and ear they seem naught but savage creatures,\r\nanimated by vile passions and by the lust of vengeance and of hate. The\r\nhour, some little time before sunset, and the place, the West\r\nBarricade, at the very spot where, a decade later, a proud tyrant\r\nraised an undying monument to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s glory and his own vanity.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of the day the guillotine had been kept busy at\r\nits ghastly work: all that France had boasted of in the past centuries,\r\nof ancient names, and blue blood, had paid toll to her desire for\r\nliberty and for fraternity. The carnage had only ceased at this late\r\nhour of the day because there were other more interesting sights for\r\nthe people to witness, a little while before the final closing of the\r\nbarricades for the night.\r\n\r\nAnd so the crowd rushed away from the Place de la Gr\xc3\xa8ve and made for\r\nthe various barricades in order to watch this interesting and amusing\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nIt was to be seen every day, for those aristos were such fools! They\r\nwere traitors to the people of course, all of them, men, women, and\r\nchildren, who happened to be descendants of the great men who since the\r\nCrusades had made the glory of France: her old _noblesse_. Their\r\nancestors had oppressed the people, had crushed them under the scarlet\r\nheels of their dainty buckled shoes, and now the people had become the\r\nrulers of France and crushed their former masters\xe2\x80\x94not beneath their\r\nheel, for they went shoeless mostly in these days\xe2\x80\x94but beneath a more\r\neffectual weight, the knife of the guillotine.\r\n\r\nAnd daily, hourly, the hideous instrument of torture claimed its many\r\nvictims\xe2\x80\x94old men, young women, tiny children, even until the day when it\r\nwould finally demand the head of a King and of a beautiful young Queen.\r\n\r\nBut this was as it should be: were not the people now the rulers of\r\nFrance? Every aristocrat was a traitor, as his ancestors had been\r\nbefore him: for two hundred years now the people had sweated, and\r\ntoiled, and starved, to keep a lustful court in lavish extravagance;\r\nnow the descendants of those who had helped to make those courts\r\nbrilliant had to hide for their lives\xe2\x80\x94to fly, if they wished to avoid\r\nthe tardy vengeance of the people.\r\n\r\nAnd they did try to hide, and tried to fly: that was just the fun of\r\nthe whole thing. Every afternoon before the gates closed and the market\r\ncarts went out in procession by the various barricades, some fool of an\r\naristo endeavoured to evade the clutches of the Committee of Public\r\nSafety. In various disguises, under various pretexts, they tried to\r\nslip through the barriers which were so well guarded by citizen\r\nsoldiers of the Republic. Men in women\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, women in male attire,\r\nchildren disguised in beggars\xe2\x80\x99 rags: there were some of all sorts:\r\n_ci-devant_ counts, marquises, even dukes, who wanted to fly from\r\nFrance, reach England or some other equally accursed country, and there\r\ntry to rouse foreign feeling against the glorious Revolution, or to\r\nraise an army in order to liberate the wretched prisoners in the\r\nTemple, who had once called themselves sovereigns of France.\r\n\r\nBut they were nearly always caught at the barricades. Sergeant Bibot\r\nespecially at the West Gate had a wonderful nose for scenting an aristo\r\nin the most perfect disguise. Then, of course, the fun began. Bibot\r\nwould look at his prey as a cat looks upon the mouse, play with him,\r\nsometimes for quite a quarter of an hour, pretend to be hoodwinked by\r\nthe disguise, by the wigs and other bits of theatrical make-up which\r\nhid the identity of a _ci-devant_ noble marquise or count.\r\n\r\nOh! Bibot had a keen sense of humour, and it was well worth hanging\r\nround that West Barricade, in order to see him catch an aristo in the\r\nvery act of trying to flee from the vengeance of the people.\r\n\r\nSometimes Bibot would let his prey actually out by the gates, allowing\r\nhim to think for the space of two minutes at least that he really had\r\nescaped out of Paris, and might even manage to reach the coast of\r\nEngland in safety, but Bibot would let the unfortunate wretch walk\r\nabout ten m\xc3\xa8tres towards the open country, then he would send two men\r\nafter him and bring him back, stripped of his disguise.\r\n\r\nOh! that was extremely funny, for as often as not the fugitive would\r\nprove to be a woman, some proud marchioness, who looked terribly\r\ncomical when she found herself in Bibot\xe2\x80\x99s clutches after all, and knew\r\nthat a summary trial would await her the next day and after that, the\r\nfond embrace of Madame la Guillotine.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that on this fine afternoon in September the crowd round\r\nBibot\xe2\x80\x99s gate was eager and excited. The lust of blood grows with its\r\nsatisfaction, there is no satiety: the crowd had seen a hundred noble\r\nheads fall beneath the guillotine to-day, it wanted to make sure that\r\nit would see another hundred fall on the morrow.\r\n\r\nBibot was sitting on an overturned and empty cask close by the gate of\r\nthe barricade; a small detachment of citoyen soldiers was under his\r\ncommand. The work had been very hot lately. Those cursed aristos were\r\nbecoming terrified and tried their hardest to slip out of Paris: men,\r\nwomen and children, whose ancestors, even in remote ages, had served\r\nthose traitorous Bourbons, were all traitors themselves and right food\r\nfor the guillotine. Every day Bibot had had the satisfaction of\r\nunmasking some fugitive royalists and sending them back to be tried by\r\nthe Committee of Public Safety, presided over by that good patriot,\r\nCitoyen Foucquier-Tinville.\r\n\r\nRobespierre and Danton both had commended Bibot for his zeal, and Bibot\r\nwas proud of the fact that he on his own initiative had sent at least\r\nfifty aristos to the guillotine.\r\n\r\nBut to-day all the sergeants in command at the various barricades had\r\nhad special orders. Recently a very great number of aristos had\r\nsucceeded in escaping out of France and in reaching England safely.\r\nThere were curious rumours about these escapes; they had become very\r\nfrequent and singularly daring; the people\xe2\x80\x99s minds were becoming\r\nstrangely excited about it all. Sergeant Grospierre had been sent to\r\nthe guillotine for allowing a whole family of aristos to slip out of\r\nthe North Gate under his very nose.\r\n\r\nIt was asserted that these escapes were organised by a band of\r\nEnglishmen, whose daring seemed to be unparalleled, and who, from sheer\r\ndesire to meddle in what did not concern them, spent their spare time\r\nin snatching away lawful victims destined for Madame la Guillotine.\r\nThese rumours soon grew in extravagance; there was no doubt that this\r\nband of meddlesome Englishmen did exist; moreover, they seemed to be\r\nunder the leadership of a man whose pluck and audacity were almost\r\nfabulous. Strange stories were afloat of how he and those aristos whom\r\nhe rescued became suddenly invisible as they reached the barricades and\r\nescaped out of the gates by sheer supernatural agency.\r\n\r\nNo one had seen these mysterious Englishmen; as for their leader, he\r\nwas never spoken of, save with a superstitious shudder. Citoyen\r\nFoucquier-Tinville would in the course of the day receive a scrap of\r\npaper from some mysterious source; sometimes he would find it in the\r\npocket of his coat, at others it would be handed to him by someone in\r\nthe crowd, whilst he was on his way to the sitting of the Committee of\r\nPublic Safety. The paper always contained a brief notice that the band\r\nof meddlesome Englishmen were at work, and it was always signed with a\r\ndevice drawn in red\xe2\x80\x94a little star-shaped flower, which we in England\r\ncall the Scarlet Pimpernel. Within a few hours of the receipt of this\r\nimpudent notice, the citoyens of the Committee of Public Safety would\r\nhear that so many royalists and aristocrats had succeeded in reaching\r\nthe coast, and were on their way to England and safety.\r\n\r\nThe guards at the gates had been doubled, the sergeants in command had\r\nbeen threatened with death, whilst liberal rewards were offered for the\r\ncapture of these daring and impudent Englishmen. There was a sum of\r\nfive thousand francs promised to the man who laid hands on the\r\nmysterious and elusive Scarlet Pimpernel.\r\n\r\nEveryone felt that Bibot would be that man, and Bibot allowed that\r\nbelief to take firm root in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s mind; and so, day after day,\r\npeople came to watch him at the West Gate, so as to be present when he\r\nlaid hands on any fugitive aristo who perhaps might be accompanied by\r\nthat mysterious Englishman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his trusted corporal, \xe2\x80\x9cCitoyen Grospierre was a fool!\r\nHad it been me now, at that North Gate last week . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCitoyen Bibot spat on the ground to express his contempt for his\r\ncomrade\xe2\x80\x99s stupidity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did it happen, citoyen?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the corporal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrospierre was at the gate, keeping good watch,\xe2\x80\x9d began Bibot,\r\npompously, as the crowd closed in round him, listening eagerly to his\r\nnarrative. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve all heard of this meddlesome Englishman, this\r\naccursed Scarlet Pimpernel. He won\xe2\x80\x99t get through _my_ gate, _morbleu!_\r\nunless he be the devil himself. But Grospierre was a fool. The market\r\ncarts were going through the gates; there was one laden with casks, and\r\ndriven by an old man, with a boy beside him. Grospierre was a bit\r\ndrunk, but he thought himself very clever; he looked into the\r\ncasks\xe2\x80\x94most of them, at least\xe2\x80\x94and saw they were empty, and let the cart\r\ngo through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA murmur of wrath and contempt went round the group of ill-clad\r\nwretches, who crowded round Citoyen Bibot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf an hour later,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cup comes a captain of\r\nthe guard with a squad of some dozen soldiers with him. \xe2\x80\x98Has a cart\r\ngone through?\xe2\x80\x99 he asks of Grospierre, breathlessly. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nGrospierre, \xe2\x80\x98not half an hour ago.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And you have let them escape,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshouts the captain furiously. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the guillotine for this,\r\ncitoyen sergeant! that cart held concealed the _ci-devant_ Duc de\r\nChalis and all his family!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What!\xe2\x80\x99 thunders Grospierre, aghast. \xe2\x80\x98Aye!\r\nand the driver was none other than that cursed Englishman, the Scarlet\r\nPimpernel.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA howl of execration greeted this tale. Citoyen Grospierre had paid for\r\nhis blunder on the guillotine, but what a fool! oh! what a fool!\r\n\r\nBibot was laughing so much at his own tale that it was some time before\r\nhe could continue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98After them, my men,\xe2\x80\x99 shouts the captain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after a while,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98remember the reward; after them, they cannot have gone far!\xe2\x80\x99 And with\r\nthat he rushes through the gate, followed by his dozen soldiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it was too late!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the crowd, excitedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey never got them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurse that Grospierre for his folly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe deserved his fate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFancy not examining those casks properly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut these sallies seemed to amuse Citoyen Bibot exceedingly; he laughed\r\nuntil his sides ached, and the tears streamed down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay!\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cthose aristos weren\xe2\x80\x99t in the cart; the\r\ndriver was not the Scarlet Pimpernel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! The captain of the guard was that damned Englishman in disguise,\r\nand every one of his soldiers aristos!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crowd this time said nothing: the story certainly savoured of the\r\nsupernatural, and though the Republic had abolished God, it had not\r\nquite succeeded in killing the fear of the supernatural in the hearts\r\nof the people. Truly that Englishman must be the devil himself.\r\n\r\nThe sun was sinking low down in the west. Bibot prepared himself to\r\nclose the gates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_En avant_ the carts,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nSome dozen covered carts were drawn up in a row, ready to leave town,\r\nin order to fetch the produce from the country close by, for market the\r\nnext morning. They were mostly well known to Bibot, as they went\r\nthrough his gate twice every day on their way to and from the town. He\r\nspoke to one or two of their drivers\xe2\x80\x94mostly women\xe2\x80\x94and was at great\r\npains to examine the inside of the carts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never know,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be caught like\r\nthat fool Grospierre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe women who drove the carts usually spent their day on the Place de\r\nla Gr\xc3\xa8ve, beneath the platform of the guillotine, knitting and\r\ngossiping, whilst they watched the rows of tumbrils arriving with the\r\nvictims the Reign of Terror claimed every day. It was great fun to see\r\nthe aristos arriving for the reception of Madame la Guillotine, and the\r\nplaces close by the platform were very much sought after. Bibot, during\r\nthe day, had been on duty on the Place. He recognized most of the old\r\nhags, \xe2\x80\x9ctricotteuses,\xe2\x80\x9d as they were called, who sat there and knitted,\r\nwhilst head after head fell beneath the knife, and they themselves got\r\nquite bespattered with the blood of those cursed aristos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xc3\xa9! la m\xc3\xa8re!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bibot to one of these horrible hags, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat have you\r\ngot there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had seen her earlier in the day, with her knitting and the whip of\r\nher cart close beside her. Now she had fastened a row of curly locks to\r\nthe whip handle, all colours, from gold to silver, fair to dark, and\r\nshe stroked them with her huge, bony fingers as she laughed at Bibot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made friends with Madame Guillotine\xe2\x80\x99s lover,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a coarse\r\nlaugh, \xe2\x80\x9che cut these off for me from the heads as they rolled down. He\r\nhas promised me some more to-morrow, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I shall be at\r\nmy usual place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! how is that, la m\xc3\xa8re?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bibot, who, hardened soldier though\r\nhe was, could not help shuddering at the awful loathsomeness of this\r\nsemblance of a woman, with her ghastly trophy on the handle of her\r\nwhip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy grandson has got the small-pox,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a jerk of her thumb\r\ntowards the inside of her cart, \xe2\x80\x9csome say it\xe2\x80\x99s the plague! If it is, I\r\nsha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be allowed to come into Paris to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the first mention of the word small-pox, Bibot had stepped hastily\r\nbackwards, and when the old hag spoke of the plague, he retreated from\r\nher as fast as he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurse you!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, whilst the whole crowd hastily avoided the\r\ncart, leaving it standing all alone in the midst of the place.\r\n\r\nThe old hag laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurse you, citoyen, for being a coward,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBah! what a man to\r\nbe afraid of sickness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Morbleu!_ the plague!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEveryone was awe-struck and silent, filled with horror for the\r\nloathsome malady, the one thing which still had the power to arouse\r\nterror and disgust in these savage, brutalised creatures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet out with you and with your plague-stricken brood!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Bibot,\r\nhoarsely.\r\n\r\nAnd with another rough laugh and coarse jest, the old hag whipped up\r\nher lean nag and drove her cart out of the gate.\r\n\r\nThis incident had spoilt the afternoon. The people were terrified of\r\nthese two horrible curses, the two maladies which nothing could cure,\r\nand which were the precursors of an awful and lonely death. They hung\r\nabout the barricades, silent and sullen for a while, eyeing one another\r\nsuspiciously, avoiding each other as if by instinct, lest the plague\r\nlurked already in their midst. Presently, as in the case of Grospierre,\r\na captain of the guard appeared suddenly. But he was known to Bibot,\r\nand there was no fear of his turning out to be a sly Englishman in\r\ndisguise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cart, . . .\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted breathlessly, even before he had reached the\r\ngates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat cart?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bibot, roughly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDriven by an old hag. . . . A covered cart . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were a dozen . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn old hag who said her son had the plague?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not let them go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Morbleu!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Bibot, whose purple cheeks had suddenly become white\r\nwith fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cart contained the _ci-devant_ Comtesse de Tournay and her two\r\nchildren, all of them traitors and condemned to death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd their driver?\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Bibot, as a superstitious shudder ran down\r\nhis spine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Sacr\xc3\xa9 tonnerre_,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is feared that it was\r\nthat accursed Englishman himself\xe2\x80\x94the Scarlet Pimpernel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE FISHERMAN\xe2\x80\x99S REST\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the kitchen Sally was extremely busy\xe2\x80\x94saucepans and frying-pans were\r\nstanding in rows on the gigantic hearth, the huge stock-pot stood in a\r\ncorner, and the jack turned with slow deliberation, and presented\r\nalternately to the glow every side of a noble sirloin of beef. The two\r\nlittle kitchen-maids bustled around, eager to help, hot and panting,\r\nwith cotton sleeves well tucked up above the dimpled elbows, and\r\ngiggling over some private jokes of their own, whenever Miss Sally\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nback was turned for a moment. And old Jemima, stolid in temper and\r\nsolid in bulk, kept up a long and subdued grumble, while she stirred\r\nthe stock-pot methodically over the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ho! Sally!\xe2\x80\x9d came in cheerful if none too melodious accents from\r\nthe coffee-room close by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLud bless my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sally, with a good-humoured laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nbe they all wanting now, I wonder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeer, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled Jemima, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99xpect Jimmy Pitkin to\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ave done with one tankard, do ye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. \xe2\x80\x99Arry, \xe2\x80\x99e looked uncommon thirsty too,\xe2\x80\x9d simpered Martha, one of\r\nthe little kitchen-maids; and her beady black eyes twinkled as they met\r\nthose of her companion, whereupon both started on a round of short and\r\nsuppressed giggles.\r\n\r\nSally looked cross for a moment, and thoughtfully rubbed her hands\r\nagainst her shapely hips; her palms were itching, evidently, to come in\r\ncontact with Martha\xe2\x80\x99s rosy cheeks\xe2\x80\x94but inherent good-humour prevailed,\r\nand with a pout and a shrug of the shoulders, she turned her attention\r\nto the fried potatoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ho, Sally! hey, Sally!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd a chorus of pewter mugs, tapped with impatient hands against the\r\noak tables of the coffee-room, accompanied the shouts for mine host\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbuxom daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSally!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a more persistent voice, \xe2\x80\x9care ye goin\xe2\x80\x99 to be all night\r\nwith that there beer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do think father might get the beer for them,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Sally, as\r\nJemima, stolidly and without further comment, took a couple of\r\nfoam-crowned jugs from the shelf, and began filling a number of pewter\r\ntankards with some of that home-brewed ale for which \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nRest\xe2\x80\x9d had been famous since the days of King Charles. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99E knows \xe2\x80\x99ow\r\nbusy we are in \xe2\x80\x99ere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father is too busy discussing politics with Mr. \xe2\x80\x99Empseed to worry\r\n\xe2\x80\x99isself about you and the kitchen,\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled Jemima under her breath.\r\n\r\nSally had gone to the small mirror which hung in a corner of the\r\nkitchen, and was hastily smoothing her hair and setting her frilled cap\r\nat its most becoming angle over her dark curls; then she took up the\r\ntankards by their handles, three in each strong, brown hand, and\r\nlaughing, grumbling, blushing, carried them through into the\r\ncoffee-room.\r\n\r\nThere, there was certainly no sign of that bustle and activity which\r\nkept four women busy and hot in the glowing kitchen beyond.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-room of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest\xe2\x80\x9d is a show place now at the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century. At the end of the eighteenth, in\r\nthe year of grace 1792, it had not yet gained that notoriety and\r\nimportance which a hundred additional years and the craze of the age\r\nhave since bestowed upon it. Yet it was an old place, even then, for\r\nthe oak rafters and beams were already black with age\xe2\x80\x94as were the\r\npanelled seats, with their tall backs, and the long polished tables\r\nbetween, on which innumerable pewter tankards had left fantastic\r\npatterns of many-sized rings. In the leaded window, high up, a row of\r\npots of scarlet geraniums and blue larkspur gave the bright note of\r\ncolour against the dull background of the oak.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Jellyband, landlord of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest\xe2\x80\x9d at Dover, was a\r\nprosperous man, was of course clear to the most casual observer. The\r\npewter on the fine old dressers, the brass above the gigantic hearth,\r\nshone like silver and gold\xe2\x80\x94the red-tiled floor was as brilliant as the\r\nscarlet geranium on the window sill\xe2\x80\x94this meant that his servants were\r\ngood and plentiful, that the custom was constant, and of that order\r\nwhich necessitated the keeping up of the coffee-room to a high standard\r\nof elegance and order.\r\n\r\nAs Sally came in, laughing through her frowns, and displaying a row of\r\ndazzling white teeth, she was greeted with shouts and chorus of\r\napplause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, here\xe2\x80\x99s Sally! What ho, Sally! Hurrah for pretty Sally!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you\xe2\x80\x99d grown deaf in that kitchen of yours,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Jimmy\r\nPitkin, as he passed the back of his hand across his very dry lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll ri\xe2\x80\x99! all ri\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Sally, as she deposited the freshly-filled\r\ntankards upon the tables, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, what a \xe2\x80\x99urry, to be sure! And is your\r\ngran\xe2\x80\x99mother a-dyin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 you wantin\xe2\x80\x99 to see the pore soul afore she\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngone! I never see\xe2\x80\x99d such a mighty rushin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA chorus of good-humoured laughter greeted this witticism, which gave\r\nthe company there present food for many jokes, for some considerable\r\ntime. Sally now seemed in less of a hurry to get back to her pots and\r\npans. A young man with fair curly hair, and eager, bright blue eyes,\r\nwas engaging most of her attention and the whole of her time, whilst\r\nbroad witticisms anent Jimmy Pitkin\xe2\x80\x99s fictitious grandmother flew from\r\nmouth to mouth, mixed with heavy puffs of pungent tobacco smoke.\r\n\r\nFacing the hearth, his legs wide apart, a long clay pipe in his mouth,\r\nstood mine host himself, worthy Mr. Jellyband, landlord of \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nFisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest,\xe2\x80\x9d as his father had been before him, aye, and his\r\ngrandfather and great-grandfather too, for that matter. Portly in\r\nbuild, jovial in countenance and somewhat bald of pate, Mr. Jellyband\r\nwas indeed a typical rural John Bull of those days\xe2\x80\x94the days when our\r\nprejudiced insularity was at its height, when to an Englishman, be he\r\nlord, yeoman, or peasant, the whole of the continent of Europe was a\r\nden of immorality, and the rest of the world an unexploited land of\r\nsavages and cannibals.\r\n\r\nThere he stood, mine worthy host, firm and well set up on his limbs,\r\nsmoking his long churchwarden and caring nothing for nobody at home,\r\nand despising everybody abroad. He wore the typical scarlet waistcoat,\r\nwith shiny brass buttons, the corduroy breeches, the grey worsted\r\nstockings and smart buckled shoes, that characterised every\r\nself-respecting innkeeper in Great Britain in these days\xe2\x80\x94and while\r\npretty, motherless Sally had need of four pairs of brown hands to do\r\nall the work that fell on her shapely shoulders, worthy Jellyband\r\ndiscussed the affairs of nations with his most privileged guests.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-room indeed, lighted by two well-polished lamps, which hung\r\nfrom the raftered ceiling, looked cheerful and cosy in the extreme.\r\nThrough the dense clouds of tobacco smoke that hung about in every\r\ncorner, the faces of Mr. Jellyband\xe2\x80\x99s customers appeared red and\r\npleasant to look at, and on good terms with themselves, their host and\r\nall the world; from every side of the room loud guffaws accompanied\r\npleasant, if not highly intellectual, conversation\xe2\x80\x94while Sally\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrepeated giggles testified to the good use Mr. Harry Waite was making\r\nof the short time she seemed inclined to spare him.\r\n\r\nThey were mostly fisher-folk who patronised Mr. Jellyband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncoffee-room, but fishermen are known to be very thirsty people; the\r\nsalt which they breathe in, when they are on the sea, accounts for\r\ntheir parched throats when on shore. But \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nsomething more than a rendezvous for these humble folk. The London and\r\nDover coach started from the hostel daily, and passengers who had come\r\nacross the Channel, and those who started for the \xe2\x80\x9cgrand tour,\xe2\x80\x9d all\r\nbecame acquainted with Mr. Jellyband, his French wines and his\r\nhome-brewed ales.\r\n\r\nIt was towards the close of September, 1792, and the weather which had\r\nbeen brilliant and hot throughout the month had suddenly broken up; for\r\ntwo days torrents of rain had deluged the south of England, doing its\r\nlevel best to ruin what chances the apples and pears and late plums had\r\nof becoming really fine, self-respecting fruit. Even now it was beating\r\nagainst the leaded windows, and tumbling down the chimney, making the\r\ncheerful wood fire sizzle in the hearth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLud! did you ever see such a wet September, Mr. Jellyband?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr.\r\nHempseed.\r\n\r\nHe sat in one of the seats inside the hearth, did Mr. Hempseed, for he\r\nwas an authority and an important personage not only at \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nFisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest,\xe2\x80\x9d where Mr. Jellyband always made a special selection\r\nof him as a foil for political arguments, but throughout the\r\nneighbourhood, where his learning and notably his knowledge of the\r\nScriptures was held in the most profound awe and respect. With one hand\r\nburied in the capacious pockets of his corduroys underneath his\r\nelaborately-worked, well-worn smock, the other holding his long clay\r\npipe, Mr. Hempseed sat there looking dejectedly across the room at the\r\nrivulets of moisture which trickled down the window panes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Jellyband, sententiously, \xe2\x80\x9cI dunno, Mr. \xe2\x80\x99Empseed, as\r\nI ever did. An\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in these parts nigh on sixty years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye! you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rec\xe2\x80\x99llect the first three years of them sixty, Mr.\r\nJellyband,\xe2\x80\x9d quietly interposed Mr. Hempseed. \xe2\x80\x9cI dunno as I ever see\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nan infant take much note of the weather, leastways not in these parts,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 _I_\xe2\x80\x99ve lived \xe2\x80\x99ere nigh on seventy-five years, Mr. Jellyband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe superiority of this wisdom was so incontestable that for the moment\r\nMr. Jellyband was not ready with his usual flow of argument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt do seem more like April than September, don\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr.\r\nHempseed, dolefully, as a shower of raindrops fell with a sizzle upon\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye! that it do,\xe2\x80\x9d assented the worthy host, \xe2\x80\x9cbut then what can you\r\n\xe2\x80\x99xpect, Mr. \xe2\x80\x99Empseed, I says, with sich a government as we\xe2\x80\x99ve got?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Hempseed shook his head with an infinity of wisdom, tempered by\r\ndeeply-rooted mistrust of the British climate and the British\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99xpect nothing, Mr. Jellyband,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPore folks like us\r\nis of no account up there in Lunnon, I knows that, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not often\r\nas I do complain. But when it comes to sich wet weather in September,\r\nand all me fruit a-rottin\xe2\x80\x99 and a-dyin\xe2\x80\x99 like the \xe2\x80\x99Guptian mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfirst-born, and doin\xe2\x80\x99 no more good than they did, pore dears, save to a\r\nlot of Jews, pedlars and sich, with their oranges and sich like foreign\r\nungodly fruit, which nobody\xe2\x80\x99d buy if English apples and pears was\r\nnicely swelled. As the Scriptures say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s quite right, Mr. \xe2\x80\x99Empseed,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Jellyband, \xe2\x80\x9cand as I says,\r\nwhat can you \xe2\x80\x99xpect? There\xe2\x80\x99s all them Frenchy devils over the Channel\r\nyonder a-murderin\xe2\x80\x99 their king and nobility, and Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox\r\nand Mr. Burke a-fightin\xe2\x80\x99 and a-wranglin\xe2\x80\x99 between them, if we Englishmen\r\nshould \xe2\x80\x99low them to go on in their ungodly way. \xe2\x80\x98Let \xe2\x80\x99em murder!\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nMr. Pitt. \xe2\x80\x98Stop \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x99 says Mr. Burke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd let \xe2\x80\x99em murder, says I, and be demmed to \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hempseed,\r\nemphatically, for he had but little liking for his friend Jellyband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npolitical arguments, wherein he always got out of his depth, and had\r\nbut little chance for displaying those pearls of wisdom which had\r\nearned for him so high a reputation in the neighbourhood and so many\r\nfree tankards of ale at \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet \xe2\x80\x99em murder,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated again, \xe2\x80\x9cbut don\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99ave sich rain in\r\nSeptember, for that is agin the law and the Scriptures which says\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLud! Mr. \xe2\x80\x99Arry, \xe2\x80\x99ow you made me jump!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was unfortunate for Sally and her flirtation that this remark of\r\nhers should have occurred at the precise moment when Mr. Hempseed was\r\ncollecting his breath, in order to deliver himself of one of those\r\nScriptural utterances which had made him famous, for it brought down\r\nupon her pretty head the full flood of her father\xe2\x80\x99s wrath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, Sally, me girl, now then!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, trying to force a frown\r\nupon his good-humoured face, \xe2\x80\x9cstop that fooling with them young\r\njackanapes and get on with the work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe work\xe2\x80\x99s gettin\xe2\x80\x99 on all ri\xe2\x80\x99, father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Jellyband was peremptory. He had other views for his buxom\r\ndaughter, his only child, who would in God\xe2\x80\x99s good time become the owner\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest,\xe2\x80\x9d than to see her married to one of these\r\nyoung fellows who earned but a precarious livelihood with their net.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid ye hear me speak, me girl?\xe2\x80\x9d he said in that quiet tone, which no\r\none inside the inn dared to disobey. \xe2\x80\x9cGet on with my Lord Tony\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsupper, for, if it ain\xe2\x80\x99t the best we can do, and \xe2\x80\x99e not satisfied, see\r\nwhat you\xe2\x80\x99ll get, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReluctantly Sally obeyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs you \xe2\x80\x99xpecting special guests then to-night, Mr. Jellyband?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nJimmy Pitkin, in a loyal attempt to divert his host\xe2\x80\x99s attention from\r\nthe circumstances connected with Sally\xe2\x80\x99s exit from the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye! that I be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jellyband, \xe2\x80\x9cfriends of my Lord Tony hisself.\r\nDukes and duchesses from over the water yonder, whom the young lord and\r\nhis friend, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, and other young noblemen have helped\r\nout of the clutches of them murderin\xe2\x80\x99 devils.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut this was too much for Mr. Hempseed\xe2\x80\x99s querulous philosophy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLud!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat they do that for, I wonder? I don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99old not with\r\ninterferin\xe2\x80\x99 in other folks\xe2\x80\x99 ways. As the Scriptures say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe, Mr. \xe2\x80\x99Empseed,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Jellyband, with biting sarcasm, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a personal friend of Mr. Pitt, and as you says along with Mr.\r\nFox: \xe2\x80\x98Let \xe2\x80\x99em murder!\xe2\x80\x99 says you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, Mr. Jellyband,\xe2\x80\x9d feebly protested Mr. Hempseed, \xe2\x80\x9cI dunno as\r\nI ever did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Jellyband had at last succeeded in getting upon his favourite\r\nhobby-horse, and had no intention of dismounting in any hurry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ve made friends with some of them French chaps \xe2\x80\x99oo they\r\ndo say have come over here o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose to make us Englishmen agree with\r\ntheir murderin\xe2\x80\x99 ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dunno what you mean, Mr. Jellyband,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mr. Hempseed, \xe2\x80\x9call I\r\nknow is\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll _I_ know is,\xe2\x80\x9d loudly asserted mine host, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there was my friend\r\nPeppercorn, \xe2\x80\x99oo owns the \xe2\x80\x98Blue-Faced Boar,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 as true and loyal an\r\nEnglishman as you\xe2\x80\x99d see in the land. And now look at \xe2\x80\x99im!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99E made\r\nfriends with some o\xe2\x80\x99 them frog-eaters, \xe2\x80\x99obnobbed with them just as if\r\nthey was Englishmen, and not just a lot of immoral, God-forsaking\r\nfurrin\xe2\x80\x99 spies. Well! and what happened? Peppercorn \xe2\x80\x99e now ups and talks\r\nof revolutions, and liberty, and down with the aristocrats, just like\r\nMr. \xe2\x80\x99Empseed over \xe2\x80\x99ere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, Mr. Jellyband,\xe2\x80\x9d again interposed Mr. Hempseed, feebly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndunno as I ever did\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Jellyband had appealed to the company in general, who were\r\nlistening awe-struck and open-mouthed at the recital of Mr.\r\nPeppercorn\xe2\x80\x99s defalcations. At one table two customers\xe2\x80\x94gentlemen\r\napparently by their clothes\xe2\x80\x94had pushed aside their half-finished game\r\nof dominoes, and had been listening for some time, and evidently with\r\nmuch amusement at Mr. Jellyband\xe2\x80\x99s international opinions. One of them\r\nnow, with a quiet, sarcastic smile still lurking round the corners of\r\nhis mobile mouth, turned towards the centre of the room where Mr.\r\nJellyband was standing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to think, mine honest friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat these\r\nFrenchmen\xe2\x80\x94spies I think you called them\xe2\x80\x94are mighty clever fellows to\r\nhave made mincemeat so to speak of your friend Mr. Peppercorn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopinions. How did they accomplish that now, think you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLud! sir, I suppose they talked \xe2\x80\x99im over. Those Frenchies, I\xe2\x80\x99ve \xe2\x80\x99eard\r\nit said, \xe2\x80\x99ave got the gift of gab\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. \xe2\x80\x99Empseed \xe2\x80\x99ere will tell you\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ow it is that they just twist some people round their little finger\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, and is that so, Mr. Hempseed?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the stranger politely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Hempseed, much irritated, \xe2\x80\x9cI dunno as I can\r\ngive you the information you require.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9clet us hope, my worthy host, that\r\nthese clever spies will not succeed in upsetting your extremely loyal\r\nopinions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut this was too much for Mr. Jellyband\xe2\x80\x99s pleasant equanimity. He burst\r\ninto an uproarious fit of laughter, which was soon echoed by those who\r\nhappened to be in his debt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHahaha! hohoho! hehehe!\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed in every key, did my worthy host,\r\nand laughed until his sides ached, and his eyes streamed. \xe2\x80\x9cAt me! hark\r\nat that! Did ye \xe2\x80\x99ear \xe2\x80\x99im say that they\xe2\x80\x99d be upsettin\xe2\x80\x99 my\r\nopinions?\xe2\x80\x94Eh?\xe2\x80\x94Lud love you, sir, but you do say some queer things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Jellyband,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Hempseed, sententiously, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know what\r\nthe Scriptures say: \xe2\x80\x98Let \xe2\x80\x99im \xe2\x80\x99oo stands take \xe2\x80\x99eed lest \xe2\x80\x99e fall.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then hark\xe2\x80\x99ee, Mr. \xe2\x80\x99Empseed,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Jellyband, still holding his\r\nsides with laughter, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Scriptures didn\xe2\x80\x99t know me. Why, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t so\r\nmuch as drink a glass of ale with one o\xe2\x80\x99 them murderin\xe2\x80\x99 Frenchmen, and\r\nnothin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99d make me change my opinions. Why! I\xe2\x80\x99ve \xe2\x80\x99eard it said that\r\nthem frog-eaters can\xe2\x80\x99t even speak the King\xe2\x80\x99s English, so, of course, if\r\nany of \xe2\x80\x99em tried to speak their God-forsaken lingo to me, why, I should\r\nspot them directly, see!\xe2\x80\x94and forewarned is forearmed, as the saying\r\ngoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye! my honest friend,\xe2\x80\x9d assented the stranger cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9cI see that\r\nyou are much too sharp, and a match for any twenty Frenchmen, and\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s to your very good health, my worthy host, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll do me the\r\nhonour to finish this bottle of mine with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure you\xe2\x80\x99re very polite, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jellyband, wiping his\r\neyes which were still streaming with the abundance of his laughter,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger poured out a couple of tankards full of wine, and having\r\noffered one to mine host, he took the other himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLoyal Englishmen as we all are,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, whilst the same humorous\r\nsmile played round the corners of his thin lips\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cloyal as we are, we\r\nmust admit that this at least is one good thing which comes to us from\r\nFrance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye! we\xe2\x80\x99ll none of us deny that, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d assented mine host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here\xe2\x80\x99s to the best landlord in England, our worthy host, Mr.\r\nJellyband,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger in a loud tone of voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHip, hip, hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the whole company present. Then there was\r\nloud clapping of hands, and mugs and tankards made a rattling music\r\nupon the tables to the accompaniment of loud laughter at nothing in\r\nparticular, and of Mr. Jellyband\xe2\x80\x99s muttered exclamations:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust fancy _me_ bein\xe2\x80\x99 talked over by any God-forsaken\r\nfurriner!\xe2\x80\x94What?\xe2\x80\x94Lud love you, sir, but you do say some queer things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which obvious fact the stranger heartily assented. It was certainly\r\na preposterous suggestion that anyone could ever upset Mr. Jellyband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfirmly-rooted opinions anent the utter worthlessness of the inhabitants\r\nof the whole continent of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nTHE REFUGEES\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeling in every part of England certainly ran very high at this time\r\nagainst the French and their doings. Smugglers and legitimate traders\r\nbetween the French and English coasts brought snatches of news from\r\nover the water, which made every honest Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s blood boil, and\r\nmade him long to have \xe2\x80\x9ca good go\xe2\x80\x9d at those murderers, who had\r\nimprisoned their king and all his family, subjected the queen and the\r\nroyal children to every species of indignity, and were even now loudly\r\ndemanding the blood of the whole Bourbon family and of every one of its\r\nadherents.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the Princesse de Lamballe, Marie Antoinette\xe2\x80\x99s young\r\nand charming friend, had filled everyone in England with unspeakable\r\nhorror, the daily execution of scores of royalists of good family,\r\nwhose only sin was their aristocratic name, seemed to cry for vengeance\r\nto the whole of civilised Europe.\r\n\r\nYet, with all that, no one dared to interfere. Burke had exhausted all\r\nhis eloquence in trying to induce the British Government to fight the\r\nrevolutionary government of France, but Mr. Pitt, with characteristic\r\nprudence, did not feel that this country was fit yet to embark on\r\nanother arduous and costly war. It was for Austria to take the\r\ninitiative; Austria, whose fairest daughter was even now a dethroned\r\nqueen, imprisoned and insulted by a howling mob; and surely \xe2\x80\x99twas\r\nnot\xe2\x80\x94so argued Mr. Fox\xe2\x80\x94for the whole of England to take up arms, because\r\none set of Frenchmen chose to murder another.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Jellyband and his fellow John Bulls, though they looked upon\r\nall foreigners with withering contempt, they were royalist and\r\nanti-revolutionists to a man, and at this present moment were furious\r\nwith Pitt for his caution and moderation, although they naturally\r\nunderstood nothing of the diplomatic reasons which guided that great\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s policy.\r\n\r\nBut now Sally came running back, very excited and very eager. The\r\njoyous company in the coffee-room had heard nothing of the noise\r\noutside, but she had spied a dripping horse and rider who had stopped\r\nat the door of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest,\xe2\x80\x9d and while the stable boy ran\r\nforward to take charge of the horse, pretty Miss Sally went to the\r\nfront door to greet the welcome visitor.\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cI think I see\xe2\x80\x99d my Lord Antony\xe2\x80\x99s horse out in the yard, father,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\n said, as she ran across the coffee-room.\r\n\r\nBut already the door had been thrown open from outside, and the next\r\nmoment an arm, covered in drab cloth and dripping with the heavy rain,\r\nwas round pretty Sally\xe2\x80\x99s waist, while a hearty voice echoed along the\r\npolished rafters of the coffee-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, and bless your brown eyes for being so sharp, my pretty Sally,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the man who had just entered, whilst worthy Mr. Jellyband came\r\nbustling forward, eager, alert and fussy, as became the advent of one\r\nof the most favoured guests of his hostel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLud, I protest, Sally,\xe2\x80\x9d added Lord Antony, as he deposited a kiss on\r\nMiss Sally\xe2\x80\x99s blooming cheeks, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you are growing prettier and\r\nprettier every time I see you\xe2\x80\x94and my honest friend, Jellyband here,\r\nmust have hard work to keep the fellows off that slim waist of yours.\r\nWhat say you, Mr. Waite?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Waite\xe2\x80\x94torn between his respect for my lord and his dislike of that\r\nparticular type of joke\xe2\x80\x94only replied with a doubtful grunt.\r\n\r\nLord Antony Dewhurst, one of the sons of the Duke of Exeter, was in\r\nthose days a very perfect type of a young English gentleman\xe2\x80\x94tall, well\r\nset-up, broad of shoulders and merry of face, his laughter rang loudly\r\nwherever he went. A good sportsman, a lively companion, a courteous,\r\nwell-bred man of the world, with not too much brains to spoil his\r\ntemper, he was a universal favourite in London drawing-rooms or in the\r\ncoffee-rooms of village inns. At \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest\xe2\x80\x9d everyone knew\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94for he was fond of a trip across to France, and always spent a\r\nnight under worthy Mr. Jellyband\xe2\x80\x99s roof on his way there or back.\r\n\r\nHe nodded to Waite, Pitkin and the others as he at last released\r\nSally\xe2\x80\x99s waist, and crossed over to the hearth to warm and dry himself:\r\nas he did so, he cast a quick, somewhat suspicious glance at the two\r\nstrangers, who had quietly resumed their game of dominoes, and for a\r\nmoment a look of deep earnestness, even of anxiety, clouded his jovial\r\nyoung face.\r\n\r\nBut only for a moment; the next he had turned to Mr. Hempseed, who was\r\nrespectfully touching his forelock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Hempseed, and how is the fruit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBadly, my lord, badly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Hempseed, dolefully, \xe2\x80\x9cbut what can\r\nyou \xe2\x80\x99xpect with this \xe2\x80\x99ere government favourin\xe2\x80\x99 them rascals over in\r\nFrance, who would murder their king and all their nobility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOdd\xe2\x80\x99s life!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Lord Antony; \xe2\x80\x9cso they would, honest Hempseed,\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nleast those they can get hold of, worse luck! But we have got some\r\nfriends coming here to-night, who at any rate have evaded their\r\nclutches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt almost seemed, when the young man said these words, as if he threw a\r\ndefiant look towards the quiet strangers in the corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks to you, my lord, and to your friends, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it said,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Jellyband.\r\n\r\nBut in a moment Lord Antony\xe2\x80\x99s hand fell warningly on mine host\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d he said peremptorily, and instinctively once again looked\r\ntowards the strangers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Lud love you, they are all right, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Jellyband;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you be afraid. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have spoken, only I knew we were among\r\nfriends. That gentleman over there is as true and loyal a subject of\r\nKing George as you are yourself, my lord, saving your presence. He is\r\nbut lately arrived in Dover, and is settling down in business in these\r\nparts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn business? Faith, then, it must be as an undertaker, for I vow I\r\nnever beheld a more rueful countenance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, my lord, I believe that the gentleman is a widower, which no\r\ndoubt would account for the melancholy of his bearing\xe2\x80\x94but he is a\r\nfriend, nevertheless, I\xe2\x80\x99ll vouch for that\xe2\x80\x94and you will own, my lord,\r\nthat who should judge of a face better than the landlord of a popular\r\ninn\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right, then, if we are among friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord\r\nAntony, who evidently did not care to discuss the subject with his\r\nhost. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, tell me, you have no one else staying here, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one, my lord, and no one coming, either, leastways\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeastways?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one your lordship would object to, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my lord, Sir Percy Blakeney and his lady will be here presently,\r\nbut they ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-goin\xe2\x80\x99 to stay\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Blakeney?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Lord Antony, in some astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, my lord. Sir Percy\xe2\x80\x99s skipper was here just now. He says that my\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s brother is crossing over to France to-day in the _Day Dream_,\r\nwhich is Sir Percy\xe2\x80\x99s yacht, and Sir Percy and my lady will come with\r\nhim as far as here to see the last of him. It don\xe2\x80\x99t put you out, do it,\r\nmy lord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t put me out, friend; nothing will put me out, unless\r\nthat supper is not the very best which Miss Sally can cook, and which\r\nhas ever been served in \xe2\x80\x98The Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need have no fear of that, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally, who all this\r\nwhile had been busy setting the table for supper. And very gay and\r\ninviting it looked, with a large bunch of brilliantly coloured dahlias\r\nin the centre, and the bright pewter goblets and blue china about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many shall I lay for, my lord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive places, pretty Sally, but let the supper be enough for ten at\r\nleast\xe2\x80\x94our friends will be tired, and, I hope, hungry. As for me, I vow\r\nI could demolish a baron of beef to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere they are, I do believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally, excitedly, as a distant\r\nclatter of horses and wheels could now be distinctly heard, drawing\r\nrapidly nearer.\r\n\r\nThere was general commotion in the coffee-room. Everyone was curious to\r\nsee my Lord Antony\xe2\x80\x99s swell friends from over the water. Miss Sally cast\r\none or two quick glances at the little bit of mirror which hung on the\r\nwall, and worthy Mr. Jellyband bustled out in order to give the first\r\nwelcome himself to his distinguished guests. Only the two strangers in\r\nthe corner did not participate in the general excitement. They were\r\ncalmly finishing their game of dominoes, and did not even look once\r\ntowards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStraight ahead, Comtesse, the door on your right,\xe2\x80\x9d said a pleasant\r\nvoice outside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye! there they are, all right enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Antony, joyfully;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9coff with you, my pretty Sally, and see how quickly you can dish up the\r\nsoup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door was thrown wide open, and, preceded by Mr. Jellyband, who was\r\nprofuse in his bows and welcomes, a party of four\xe2\x80\x94two ladies and two\r\ngentlemen\xe2\x80\x94entered the coffee-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome! Welcome to old England!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Antony, effusively, as he\r\ncame eagerly forward with both hands outstretched towards the\r\nnewcomers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are Lord Antony Dewhurst, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the ladies,\r\nspeaking with a strong foreign accent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt your service, Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, as he ceremoniously kissed the\r\nhands of both the ladies, then turned to the men and shook them both\r\nwarmly by the hand.\r\n\r\nSally was already helping the ladies to take off their travelling\r\ncloaks, and both turned, with a shiver, towards the brightly-blazing\r\nhearth.\r\n\r\nThere was a general movement among the company in the coffee-room.\r\nSally had bustled off to her kitchen, whilst Jellyband, still profuse\r\nwith his respectful salutations, arranged one or two chairs around the\r\nfire. Mr. Hempseed, touching his forelock, was quietly vacating the\r\nseat in the hearth. Everyone was staring curiously, yet deferentially,\r\nat the foreigners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Messieurs! what can I say?\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder of the two ladies, as\r\nshe stretched a pair of fine, aristocratic hands to the warmth of the\r\nblaze, and looked with unspeakable gratitude first at Lord Antony, then\r\nat one of the young men who had accompanied her party, and who was busy\r\ndivesting himself of his heavy, caped coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly that you are glad to be in England, Comtesse,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lord\r\nAntony, \xe2\x80\x9cand that you have not suffered too much from your trying\r\nvoyage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, indeed, we are glad to be in England,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, while her\r\neyes filled with tears, \xe2\x80\x9cand we have already forgotten all that we have\r\nsuffered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice was musical and low, and there was a great deal of calm\r\ndignity and of many sufferings nobly endured marked in the handsome,\r\naristocratic face, with its wealth of snow-white hair dressed high\r\nabove the forehead, after the fashion of the times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope my friend, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, proved an entertaining\r\ntravelling companion, Madame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, indeed, Sir Andrew was kindness itself. How could my children and\r\nI ever show enough gratitude to you all, Messieurs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer companion, a dainty, girlish figure, childlike and pathetic in its\r\nlook of fatigue and of sorrow, had said nothing as yet, but her eyes,\r\nlarge, brown, and full of tears, looked up from the fire and sought\r\nthose of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, who had drawn near to the hearth and to\r\nher; then, as they met his, which were fixed with unconcealed\r\nadmiration upon the sweet face before him, a thought of warmer colour\r\nrushed up to her pale cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo this is England,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she looked round with childlike\r\ncuriosity at the great open hearth, the oak rafters, and the yokels\r\nwith their elaborate smocks and jovial, rubicund, British countenances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bit of it, Mademoiselle,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir Andrew, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cbut all of\r\nit, at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young girl blushed again, but this time a bright smile, fleet and\r\nsweet, illumined her dainty face. She said nothing, and Sir Andrew too\r\nwas silent, yet those two young people understood one another, as young\r\npeople have a way of doing all the world over, and have done since the\r\nworld began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, I say, supper!\xe2\x80\x9d here broke in Lord Antony\xe2\x80\x99s jovial voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csupper, honest Jellyband. Where is that pretty wench of yours and the\r\ndish of soup? Zooks, man, while you stand there gaping at the ladies,\r\nthey will faint with hunger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment! one moment, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jellyband, as he threw open the\r\ndoor that led to the kitchen and shouted lustily: \xe2\x80\x9cSally! Hey, Sally\r\nthere, are ye ready, my girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSally was ready, and the next moment she appeared in the doorway\r\ncarrying a gigantic tureen, from which rose a cloud of steam and an\r\nabundance of savoury odour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOdd\xe2\x80\x99s my life, supper at last!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Lord Antony, merrily, as he\r\ngallantly offered his arm to the Comtesse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I have the honour?\xe2\x80\x9d he added ceremoniously, as he led her towards\r\nthe supper table.\r\n\r\nThere was general bustle in the coffee-room: Mr. Hempseed and most of\r\nthe yokels and fisher-folk had gone to make way for \xe2\x80\x9cthe quality,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nto finish smoking their pipes elsewhere. Only the two strangers stayed\r\non, quietly and unconcernedly playing their game of dominoes and\r\nsipping their wine; whilst at another table Harry Waite, who was fast\r\nlosing his temper, watched pretty Sally bustling round the table.\r\n\r\nShe looked a very dainty picture of English rural life, and no wonder\r\nthat the susceptible young Frenchman could scarce take his eyes off her\r\npretty face. The Vicomte de Tournay was scarce nineteen, a beardless\r\nboy, on whom the terrible tragedies which were being enacted in his own\r\ncountry had made but little impression. He was elegantly and even\r\nfoppishly dressed, and once safely landed in England he was evidently\r\nready to forget the horrors of the Revolution in the delights of\r\nEnglish life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardi, if zis is England,\xe2\x80\x9d he said as he continued to ogle Sally with\r\nmarked satisfaction, \xe2\x80\x9cI am of it satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible at this point to record the exact exclamation\r\nwhich escaped through Mr. Harry Waite\xe2\x80\x99s clenched teeth. Only respect\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x9cthe quality,\xe2\x80\x9d and notably for my Lord Antony, kept his marked\r\ndisapproval of the young foreigner in check.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but this _is_ England, you abandoned young reprobate,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed\r\nLord Antony with a laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cand do not, I pray, bring your loose foreign\r\nways into this most moral country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord Antony had already sat down at the head of the table with the\r\nComtesse on his right. Jellyband was bustling round, filling glasses\r\nand putting chairs straight. Sally waited, ready to hand round the\r\nsoup. Mr. Harry Waite\xe2\x80\x99s friends had at last succeeded in taking him out\r\nof the room, for his temper was growing more and more violent under the\r\nVicomte\xe2\x80\x99s obvious admiration for Sally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuzanne,\xe2\x80\x9d came in stern, commanding accents from the rigid Comtesse.\r\n\r\nSuzanne blushed again; she had lost count of time and of place whilst\r\nshe had stood beside the fire, allowing the handsome young Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes to dwell upon her sweet face, and his hand, as if unconsciously,\r\nto rest upon hers. Her mother\xe2\x80\x99s voice brought her back to reality once\r\nmore, and with a submissive \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mama,\xe2\x80\x9d she too took her place at the\r\nsupper table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nTHE LEAGUE OF THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThey all looked a merry, even a happy party, as they sat round the\r\ntable; Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and Lord Antony Dewhurst, two typical\r\ngood-looking, well-born and well-bred Englishmen of that year of grace\r\n1792, and the aristocratic French comtesse with her two children, who\r\nhad just escaped from such dire perils, and found a safe retreat at\r\nlast on the shores of protecting England.\r\n\r\nIn the corner the two strangers had apparently finished their game; one\r\nof them arose, and standing with his back to the merry company at the\r\ntable, he adjusted with much deliberation his large triple caped coat.\r\nAs he did so, he gave one quick glance all around him. Everyone was\r\nbusy laughing and chatting, and he murmured the words \xe2\x80\x9cAll safe!\xe2\x80\x9d: his\r\ncompanion then, with the alertness borne of long practice, slipped on\r\nto his knees in a moment, and the next had crept noiselessly under the\r\noak bench. The stranger then, with a loud \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d quietly walked\r\nout of the coffee-room.\r\n\r\nNot one of those at the supper table had noticed this curious and\r\nsilent man\xc5\x93uvre, but when the stranger finally closed the door of the\r\ncoffee-room behind him, they all instinctively sighed a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone, at last!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Antony, jovially.\r\n\r\nThen the young Vicomte de Tournay rose, glass in hand, and with the\r\ngraceful affectation peculiar to the times, he raised it aloft, and\r\nsaid in broken English,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo His Majesty George Three of England. God bless him for his\r\nhospitality to us all, poor exiles from France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Majesty the King!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Lord Antony and Sir Andrew as they drank\r\nloyally to the toast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo His Majesty King Louis of France,\xe2\x80\x9d added Sir Andrew, with\r\nsolemnity. \xe2\x80\x9cMay God protect him, and give him victory over his\r\nenemies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEveryone rose and drank this toast in silence. The fate of the\r\nunfortunate King of France, then a prisoner of his own people, seemed\r\nto cast a gloom even over Mr. Jellyband\xe2\x80\x99s pleasant countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to M. le Comte de Tournay de Basserive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Antony,\r\nmerrily. \xe2\x80\x9cMay we welcome him in England before many days are over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Comtesse, as with a slightly trembling hand\r\nshe conveyed her glass to her lips, \xe2\x80\x9cI scarcely dare to hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut already Lord Antony had served out the soup, and for the next few\r\nmoments all conversation ceased, while Jellyband and Sally handed round\r\nthe plates and everyone began to eat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, Madame!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Antony, after a while, \xe2\x80\x9cmine was no idle\r\ntoast; seeing yourself, Mademoiselle Suzanne and my friend the Vicomte\r\nsafely in England now, surely you must feel reassured as to the fate of\r\nMonsieur le Comte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Comtesse, with a heavy sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cI trust in\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x94I can but pray\xe2\x80\x94and hope . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, Madame!\xe2\x80\x9d here interposed Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, \xe2\x80\x9ctrust in God by\r\nall means, but believe also a little in your English friends, who have\r\nsworn to bring the Count safely across the Channel, even as they have\r\nbrought you to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, indeed, Monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI have the fullest confidence\r\nin you and in your friends. Your fame, I assure you, has spread\r\nthroughout the whole of France. The way some of my own friends have\r\nescaped from the clutches of that awful revolutionary tribunal was\r\nnothing short of a miracle\xe2\x80\x94and all done by you and your friends\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were but the hands, Madame la Comtesse . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my husband, Monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Comtesse, whilst unshed tears\r\nseemed to veil her voice, \xe2\x80\x9che is in such deadly peril\xe2\x80\x94I would never\r\nhave left him, only . . . there were my children . . . I was torn\r\nbetween my duty to him, and to them. They refused to go without me . .\r\n. and you and your friends assured me so solemnly that my husband would\r\nbe safe. But, oh! now that I am here\xe2\x80\x94amongst you all\xe2\x80\x94in this beautiful,\r\nfree England\xe2\x80\x94I think of him, flying for his life, hunted like a poor\r\nbeast . . . in such peril. . . . Ah! I should not have left him . . . I\r\nshould not have left him! . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor woman had completely broken down; fatigue, sorrow and emotion\r\nhad overmastered her rigid, aristocratic bearing. She was crying gently\r\nto herself, whilst Suzanne ran up to her and tried to kiss away her\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nLord Antony and Sir Andrew had said nothing to interrupt the Comtesse\r\nwhilst she was speaking. There was no doubt that they felt deeply for\r\nher; their very silence testified to that\xe2\x80\x94but in every century, and\r\never since England has been what it is, an Englishman has always felt\r\nsomewhat ashamed of his own emotion and of his own sympathy. And so the\r\ntwo young men said nothing, and busied themselves in trying to hide\r\ntheir feelings, only succeeding in looking immeasurably sheepish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for me, Monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Suzanne, suddenly, as she looked through a\r\nwealth of brown curls across at Sir Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cI trust you absolutely,\r\nand I _know_ that you will bring my dear father safely to England, just\r\nas you brought us to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was said with so much confidence, such unuttered hope and belief,\r\nthat it seemed as if by magic to dry the mother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and to bring a\r\nsmile upon everybody\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay! you shame me, Mademoiselle,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir Andrew; \xe2\x80\x9cthough my life\r\nis at your service, I have been but a humble tool in the hands of our\r\ngreat leader, who organised and effected your escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had spoken with so much warmth and vehemence that Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\nfastened upon him in undisguised wonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour leader, Monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Comtesse, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! of course,\r\nyou must have a leader. And I did not think of that before! But tell me\r\nwhere is he? I must go to him at once, and I and my children must throw\r\nourselves at his feet, and thank him for all that he has done for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas, Madame!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Antony, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible?\xe2\x80\x94Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the Scarlet Pimpernel works in the dark, and his identity is\r\nonly known under a solemn oath of secrecy to his immediate followers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Scarlet Pimpernel?\xe2\x80\x9d said Suzanne, with a merry laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy! what a\r\ndroll name! What is the Scarlet Pimpernel, Monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at Sir Andrew with eager curiosity. The young man\xe2\x80\x99s face had\r\nbecome almost transfigured. His eyes shone with enthusiasm;\r\nhero-worship, love, admiration for his leader seemed literally to glow\r\nupon his face.\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cThe Scarlet Pimpernel, Mademoiselle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cis the name\r\n of a humble English wayside flower; but it is also the name chosen to\r\n hide the identity of the best and bravest man in all the world, so\r\n that he may better succeed in accomplishing the noble task he has set\r\n himself to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d here interposed the young Vicomte, \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard speak of\r\nthis Scarlet Pimpernel. A little flower\xe2\x80\x94red?\xe2\x80\x94yes! They say in Paris\r\nthat every time a royalist escapes to England that devil,\r\nFoucquier-Tinville, the Public Prosecutor, receives a paper with that\r\nlittle flower dessinated in red upon it. . . . Yes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is so,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Lord Antony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he will have received one such paper to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I wonder what he will say!\xe2\x80\x9d said Suzanne, merrily. \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard\r\nthat the picture of that little red flower is the only thing that\r\nfrightens him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9che will have many more opportunities\r\nof studying the shape of that small scarlet flower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed the Comtesse, \xe2\x80\x9cit all sounds like a romance, and\r\nI cannot understand it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you try, Madame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, tell me, why should your leader\xe2\x80\x94why should you all\xe2\x80\x94spend your\r\nmoney and risk your lives\xe2\x80\x94for it is your lives you risk, Messieurs,\r\nwhen you set foot in France\xe2\x80\x94and all for us French men and women, who\r\nare nothing to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSport, Madame la Comtesse, sport,\xe2\x80\x9d asserted Lord Antony, with his\r\njovial, loud and pleasant voice; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are a nation of sportsmen, you\r\nknow, and just now it is the fashion to pull the hare from between the\r\nteeth of the hound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no, no, not sport only, Monsieur . . . you have a more noble\r\nmotive, I am sure, for the good work you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, Madame, I would like you to find it then . . . as for me, I\r\nvow, I love the game, for this is the finest sport I have yet\r\nencountered.\xe2\x80\x94Hair-breadth escapes . . . the devil\xe2\x80\x99s own risks!\xe2\x80\x94Tally\r\nho!\xe2\x80\x94and away we go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the Comtesse shook her head, still incredulously. To her it seemed\r\npreposterous that these young men and their great leader, all of them\r\nrich, probably well-born, and young, should for no other motive than\r\nsport, run the terrible risks, which she knew they were constantly\r\ndoing. Their nationality, once they had set foot in France, would be no\r\nsafeguard to them. Anyone found harbouring or assisting suspected\r\nroyalists would be ruthlessly condemned and summarily executed,\r\nwhatever his nationality might be. And this band of young Englishmen\r\nhad, to her own knowledge, bearded the implacable and bloodthirsty\r\ntribunal of the Revolution, within the very walls of Paris itself, and\r\nhad snatched away condemned victims, almost from the very foot of the\r\nguillotine. With a shudder, she recalled the events of the last few\r\ndays, her escape from Paris with her two children, all three of them\r\nhidden beneath the hood of a rickety cart, and lying amidst a heap of\r\nturnips and cabbages, not daring to breathe, whilst the mob howled \xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\x80\r\nla lanterne les aristos!\xe2\x80\x9d at that awful West Barricade.\r\n\r\nIt had all occurred in such a miraculous way; she and her husband had\r\nunderstood that they had been placed on the list of \xe2\x80\x9csuspected\r\npersons,\xe2\x80\x9d which meant that their trial and death were but a matter of\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x94of hours, perhaps.\r\n\r\nThen came the hope of salvation; the mysterious epistle, signed with\r\nthe enigmatical scarlet device; the clear, peremptory directions; the\r\nparting from the Comte de Tournay, which had torn the poor wife\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nin two; the hope of reunion; the flight with her two children; the\r\ncovered cart; that awful hag driving it, who looked like some horrible\r\nevil demon, with the ghastly trophy on her whip handle!\r\n\r\nThe Comtesse looked round at the quaint, old-fashioned English inn, the\r\npeace of this land of civil and religious liberty, and she closed her\r\neyes to shut out the haunting vision of that West Barricade, and of the\r\nmob retreating panic-stricken when the old hag spoke of the plague.\r\n\r\nEvery moment under that cart she expected recognition, arrest, herself\r\nand her children tried and condemned, and these young Englishmen, under\r\nthe guidance of their brave and mysterious leader, had risked their\r\nlives to save them all, as they had already saved scores of other\r\ninnocent people.\r\n\r\nAnd all only for sport? Impossible! Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as she sought those\r\nof Sir Andrew plainly told him that she thought that _he_ at any rate\r\nrescued his fellow-men from terrible and unmerited death, through a\r\nhigher and nobler motive than his friend would have her believe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many are there in your brave league, Monsieur?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty all told, Mademoiselle,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cone to command, and\r\nnineteen to obey. All of us Englishmen, and all pledged to the same\r\ncause\xe2\x80\x94to obey our leader and to rescue the innocent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay God protect you all, Messieurs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Comtesse, fervently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has done that so far, Madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is wonderful to me, wonderful!\xe2\x80\x94That you should all be so brave, so\r\ndevoted to your fellow-men\xe2\x80\x94yet you are English!\xe2\x80\x94and in France treachery\r\nis rife\xe2\x80\x94all in the name of liberty and fraternity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe women even, in France, have been more bitter against us\r\naristocrats than the men,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Vicomte, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Comtesse, whilst a look of haughty disdain and\r\nintense bitterness shot through her melancholy eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was that\r\nwoman, Marguerite St. Just, for instance. She denounced the Marquis de\r\nSt. Cyr and all his family to the awful tribunal of the Terror.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarguerite St. Just?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Antony, as he shot a quick and\r\napprehensive glance across at Sir Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cMarguerite St. Just?\xe2\x80\x94Surely\r\n. . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Comtesse, \xe2\x80\x9csurely you know her. She was a leading\r\nactress of the Com\xc3\xa9die Fran\xc3\xa7aise, and she married an Englishman lately.\r\nYou must know her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Antony. \xe2\x80\x9cKnow Lady Blakeney\xe2\x80\x94the most fashionable\r\nwoman in London\xe2\x80\x94the wife of the richest man in England? Of course, we\r\nall know Lady Blakeney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was a school-fellow of mine at the convent in Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed\r\nSuzanne, \xe2\x80\x9cand we came over to England together to learn your language.\r\nI was very fond of Marguerite, and I cannot believe that she ever did\r\nanything so wicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly seems incredible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say that she\r\nactually denounced the Marquis de St. Cyr? Why should she have done\r\nsuch a thing? Surely there must be some mistake\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo mistake is possible, Monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the Comtesse, coldly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarguerite St. Just\xe2\x80\x99s brother is a noted republican. There was some\r\ntalk of a family feud between him and my cousin, the Marquis de St.\r\nCyr. The St. Justs\xe2\x80\x99 are quite plebeian, and the republican government\r\nemploys many spies. I assure you there is no mistake. . . . You had not\r\nheard this story?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, Madame, I did hear some vague rumours of it, but in England no\r\none would credit it. . . . Sir Percy Blakeney, her husband, is a very\r\nwealthy man, of high social position, the intimate friend of the Prince\r\nof Wales . . . and Lady Blakeney leads both fashion and society in\r\nLondon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be, Monsieur, and we shall, of course, lead a very quiet life\r\nin England, but I pray God that while I remain in this beautiful\r\ncountry, I may never meet Marguerite St. Just.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proverbial wet-blanket seemed to have fallen over the merry little\r\ncompany gathered round the table. Suzanne looked sad and silent; Sir\r\nAndrew fidgeted uneasily with his fork, whilst the Comtesse, encased in\r\nthe plate-armour of her aristocratic prejudices, sat, rigid and\r\nunbending, in her straight-backed chair. As for Lord Antony, he looked\r\nextremely uncomfortable, and glanced once or twice apprehensively\r\ntowards Jellyband, who looked just as uncomfortable as himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what time do you expect Sir Percy and Lady Blakeney?\xe2\x80\x9d he contrived\r\nto whisper unobserved, to mine host.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny moment, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Jellyband in reply.\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke, a distant clatter was heard of an approaching coach;\r\nlouder and louder it grew, one or two shouts became distinguishable,\r\nthen the rattle of horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs on the uneven cobble stones, and the\r\nnext moment a stable boy had thrown open the coffee-room door and\r\nrushed in excitedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Percy Blakeney and my lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted at the top of his voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re just arriving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with more shouting, jingling of harness, and iron hoofs upon the\r\nstones, a magnificent coach, drawn by four superb bays, had halted\r\noutside the porch of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nMARGUERITE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a moment the pleasant oak-raftered coffee-room of the inn became the\r\nscene of hopeless confusion and discomfort. At the first announcement\r\nmade by the stable boy, Lord Antony, with a fashionable oath, had\r\njumped up from his seat and was now giving many and confused directions\r\nto poor bewildered Jellyband, who seemed at his wits\xe2\x80\x99 end what to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake, man,\xe2\x80\x9d admonished his lordship, \xe2\x80\x9ctry to keep Lady\r\nBlakeney talking outside for a moment, while the ladies withdraw.\r\nZounds!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with another more emphatic oath, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is most\r\nunfortunate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick, Sally! the candles!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Jellyband, as hopping about from\r\none leg to another, he ran hither and thither, adding to the general\r\ndiscomfort of everybody.\r\n\r\nThe Comtesse, too, had risen to her feet: rigid and erect, trying to\r\nhide her excitement beneath more becoming _sang-froid_, she repeated\r\nmechanically,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not see her!\xe2\x80\x94I will not see her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOutside, the excitement attendant upon the arrival of very important\r\nguests grew apace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-day, Sir Percy!\xe2\x80\x94Good-day to your ladyship! Your servant, Sir\r\nPercy!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94was heard in one long, continued chorus, with alternate more\r\nfeeble tones of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cRemember the poor blind man! of your charity, lady and\r\ngentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen suddenly a singularly sweet voice was heard through all the din.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the poor man be\xe2\x80\x94and give him some supper at my expense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice was low and musical, with a slight sing-song in it, and a\r\nfaint _soup\xc3\xa7on_ of foreign intonation in the pronunciation of the\r\nconsonants.\r\n\r\nEveryone in the coffee-room heard it and paused, instinctively\r\nlistening to it for a moment. Sally was holding the candles by the\r\nopposite door, which led to the bedrooms upstairs, and the Comtesse was\r\nin the act of beating a hasty retreat before that enemy who owned such\r\na sweet musical voice; Suzanne reluctantly was preparing to follow her\r\nmother, whilst casting regretful glances towards the door, where she\r\nhoped still to see her dearly-beloved, erstwhile school-fellow.\r\n\r\nThen Jellyband threw open the door, still stupidly and blindly hoping\r\nto avert the catastrophe which he felt was in the air, and the same\r\nlow, musical voice said, with a merry laugh and mock consternation,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cB-r-r-r-r! I am as wet as a herring! _Dieu!_ has anyone ever seen such\r\na contemptible climate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuzanne, come with me at once\xe2\x80\x94I wish it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Comtesse,\r\nperemptorily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Mama!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Suzanne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lady . . . er . . . h\xe2\x80\x99m! . . . my lady! . . .\xe2\x80\x9d came in feeble\r\naccents from Jellyband, who stood clumsily trying to bar the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pardieu_, my good man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Blakeney, with some impatience,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat are you standing in my way for, dancing about like a turkey with\r\na sore foot? Let me get to the fire, I am perished with the cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the next moment Lady Blakeney, gently pushing mine host on one\r\nside, had swept into the coffee-room.\r\n\r\nThere are many portraits and miniatures extant of Marguerite St.\r\nJust\xe2\x80\x94Lady Blakeney as she was then\xe2\x80\x94but it is doubtful if any of these\r\nreally do her singular beauty justice. Tall, above the average, with\r\nmagnificent presence and regal figure, it is small wonder that even the\r\nComtesse paused for a moment in involuntary admiration before turning\r\nher back on so fascinating an apparition.\r\n\r\nMarguerite Blakeney was then scarcely five-and-twenty, and her beauty\r\nwas at its most dazzling stage. The large hat, with its undulating and\r\nwaving plumes, threw a soft shadow across the classic brow with the\r\naureole of auburn hair\xe2\x80\x94free at the moment from any powder; the sweet,\r\nalmost childlike mouth, the straight chiselled nose, round chin, and\r\ndelicate throat, all seemed set off by the picturesque costume of the\r\nperiod. The rich blue velvet robe moulded in its every line the\r\ngraceful contour of the figure, whilst one tiny hand held, with a\r\ndignity all its own, the tall stick adorned with a large bunch of\r\nribbons which fashionable ladies of the period had taken to carrying\r\nrecently.\r\n\r\nWith a quick glance all around the room, Marguerite Blakeney had taken\r\nstock of everyone there. She nodded pleasantly to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes,\r\nwhilst extending a hand to Lord Antony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello! my Lord Tony, why\xe2\x80\x94what are _you_ doing here in Dover?\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nmerrily.\r\n\r\nThen, without waiting for a reply, she turned and faced the Comtesse\r\nand Suzanne. Her whole face lighted up with additional brightness, as\r\nshe stretched out both arms towards the young girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy! if that isn\xe2\x80\x99t my little Suzanne over there. _Pardieu_, little\r\ncitizeness, how came you to be in England? And Madame too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went up effusively to them both, with not a single touch of\r\nembarrassment in her manner or in her smile. Lord Tony and Sir Andrew\r\nwatched the little scene with eager apprehension. English though they\r\nwere, they had often been in France, and had mixed sufficiently with\r\nthe French to realise the unbending hauteur, the bitter hatred with\r\nwhich the old _noblesse_ of France viewed all those who had helped to\r\ncontribute to their downfall. Armand St. Just, the brother of beautiful\r\nLady Blakeney\xe2\x80\x94though known to hold moderate and conciliatory views\xe2\x80\x94was\r\nan ardent republican; his feud with the ancient family of St. Cyr\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nrights and wrongs of which no outsider ever knew\xe2\x80\x94had culminated in the\r\ndownfall, the almost total extinction, of the latter. In France, St.\r\nJust and his party had triumphed, and here in England, face to face\r\nwith these three refugees driven from their country, flying for their\r\nlives, bereft of all which centuries of luxury had given them, there\r\nstood a fair scion of those same republican families which had hurled\r\ndown a throne, and uprooted an aristocracy whose origin was lost in the\r\ndim and distant vista of bygone centuries.\r\n\r\nShe stood there before them, in all the unconscious insolence of\r\nbeauty, and stretched out her dainty hand to them, as if she would, by\r\nthat one act, bridge over the conflict and bloodshed of the past\r\ndecade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuzanne, I forbid you to speak to that woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Comtesse,\r\nsternly, as she placed a restraining hand upon her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\nShe had spoken in English, so that all might hear and understand; the\r\ntwo young English gentlemen as well as the common innkeeper and his\r\ndaughter. The latter literally gasped with horror at this foreign\r\ninsolence, this impudence before her ladyship\xe2\x80\x94who was English, now that\r\nshe was Sir Percy\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and a friend of the Princess of Wales to\r\nboot.\r\n\r\nAs for Lord Antony and Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, their very hearts seemed to\r\nstand still with horror at this gratuitous insult. One of them uttered\r\nan exclamation of appeal, the other one of warning, and instinctively\r\nboth glanced hurriedly towards the door, whence a slow, drawly, not\r\nunpleasant voice had already been heard.\r\n\r\nAlone among those present Marguerite Blakeney and the Comtesse de\r\nTournay had remained seemingly unmoved. The latter, rigid, erect and\r\ndefiant, with one hand still upon her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s arm, seemed the very\r\npersonification of unbending pride. For the moment Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s sweet\r\nface had become as white as the soft fichu which swathed her throat,\r\nand a very keen observer might have noted that the hand which held the\r\ntall, beribboned stick was clenched, and trembled somewhat.\r\n\r\nBut this was only momentary; the next instant the delicate eyebrows\r\nwere raised slightly, the lips curved sarcastically upwards, the clear\r\nblue eyes looked straight at the rigid Comtesse, and with a slight\r\nshrug of the shoulders\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoity-toity, citizeness,\xe2\x80\x9d she said gaily, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat fly stings you, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are in England now, Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the Comtesse, coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nam at liberty to forbid my daughter to touch your hand in friendship.\r\nCome, Suzanne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe beckoned to her daughter, and without another look at Marguerite\r\nBlakeney, but with a deep, old-fashioned curtsey to the two young men,\r\nshe sailed majestically out of the room.\r\n\r\nThere was silence in the old inn parlour for a moment, as the rustle of\r\nthe Comtesse\xe2\x80\x99s skirts died away down the passage. Marguerite, rigid as\r\na statue, followed with hard, set eyes the upright figure, as it\r\ndisappeared through the doorway\xe2\x80\x94but as little Suzanne, humble and\r\nobedient, was about to follow her mother, the hard, set expression\r\nsuddenly vanished, and a wistful, almost pathetic and childlike look\r\nstole into Lady Blakeney\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\nLittle Suzanne caught that look; the child\xe2\x80\x99s sweet nature went out to\r\nthe beautiful woman, scarce older than herself; filial obedience\r\nvanished before girlish sympathy; at the door she turned, ran back to\r\nMarguerite, and putting her arms round her, kissed her effusively; then\r\nonly did she follow her mother, Sally bringing up the rear, with a\r\npleasant smile on her dimpled face, and with a final curtsey to my\r\nlady.\r\n\r\nSuzanne\xe2\x80\x99s sweet and dainty impulse had relieved the unpleasant tension.\r\nSir Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s eyes followed the pretty little figure, until it had quite\r\ndisappeared, then they met Lady Blakeney\xe2\x80\x99s with unassumed merriment.\r\n\r\nMarguerite, with dainty affectation, had kissed her hand to the ladies,\r\nas they disappeared through the door, then a humorous smile began\r\nhovering round the corners of her mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that\xe2\x80\x99s it, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said gaily. \xe2\x80\x9cLa! Sir Andrew, did you ever\r\nsee such an unpleasant person? I hope when I grow old I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t look\r\nlike that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gathered up her skirts, and assuming a majestic gait, stalked\r\ntowards the fireplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuzanne,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, mimicking the Comtesse\xe2\x80\x99s voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI forbid you to\r\nspeak to that woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe laugh which accompanied this sally sounded perhaps a trifle forced\r\nand hard, but neither Sir Andrew nor Lord Tony were very keen\r\nobservers. The mimicry was so perfect, the tone of the voice so\r\naccurately reproduced, that both the young men joined in a hearty\r\ncheerful \xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Lady Blakeney!\xe2\x80\x9d added Lord Tony, \xe2\x80\x9chow they must miss you at the\r\nCom\xc3\xa9die Fran\xc3\xa7aise, and how the Parisians must hate Sir Percy for having\r\ntaken you away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLud, man,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Marguerite, with a shrug of her graceful\r\nshoulders, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis impossible to hate Sir Percy for anything; his witty\r\nsallies would disarm even Madame la Comtesse herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young Vicomte, who had not elected to follow his mother in her\r\ndignified exit, now made a step forward, ready to champion the Comtesse\r\nshould Lady Blakeney aim any further shafts at her. But before he could\r\nutter a preliminary word of protest, a pleasant, though distinctly\r\ninane laugh, was heard from outside, and the next moment an unusually\r\ntall and very richly dressed figure appeared in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nAN EXQUISITE OF \xe2\x80\x9992\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Percy Blakeney, as the chronicles of the time inform us, was in\r\nthis year of grace 1792, still a year or two on the right side of\r\nthirty. Tall, above the average, even for an Englishman,\r\nbroad-shouldered and massively built, he would have been called\r\nunusually good-looking, but for a certain lazy expression in his\r\ndeep-set blue eyes, and that perpetual inane laugh which seemed to\r\ndisfigure his strong, clearly-cut mouth.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly a year ago now that Sir Percy Blakeney, Bart., one of the\r\nrichest men in England, leader of all the fashions, and intimate friend\r\nof the Prince of Wales, had astonished fashionable society in London\r\nand Bath by bringing home, from one of his journeys abroad, a\r\nbeautiful, fascinating, clever, French wife. He, the sleepiest,\r\ndullest, most British Britisher that had ever set a pretty woman\r\nyawning, had secured a brilliant matrimonial prize for which, as all\r\nchroniclers aver, there had been many competitors.\r\n\r\nMarguerite St. Just had first made her _d\xc3\xa9but_ in artistic Parisian\r\ncircles, at the very moment when the greatest social upheaval the world\r\nhas ever known was taking place within its very walls. Scarcely\r\neighteen, lavishly gifted with beauty and talent, chaperoned only by a\r\nyoung and devoted brother, she had soon gathered round her, in her\r\ncharming apartment in the Rue Richelieu, a coterie which was as\r\nbrilliant as it was exclusive\xe2\x80\x94exclusive, that is to say, only from one\r\npoint of view: Marguerite St. Just was from principle and by conviction\r\na republican\xe2\x80\x94equality of birth was her motto\xe2\x80\x94inequality of fortune was\r\nin her eyes a mere untoward accident, but the only inequality she\r\nadmitted was that of talent. \xe2\x80\x9cMoney and titles may be hereditary,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwould say, \xe2\x80\x9cbut brains are not,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus her charming salon was\r\nreserved for originality and intellect, for brilliance and wit, for\r\nclever men and talented women, and the entrance into it was soon looked\r\nupon in the world of intellect\xe2\x80\x94which even in those days and in those\r\ntroublous times found its pivot in Paris\xe2\x80\x94as the seal to an artistic\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nClever men, distinguished men, and even men of exalted station formed a\r\nperpetual and brilliant court round the fascinating young actress of\r\nthe Com\xc3\xa9die Fran\xc3\xa7aise, and she glided through republican,\r\nrevolutionary, bloodthirsty Paris like a shining comet with a trail\r\nbehind her of all that was most distinguished, most interesting, in\r\nintellectual Europe.\r\n\r\nThen the climax came. Some smiled indulgently and called it an artistic\r\neccentricity, others looked upon it as a wise provision, in view of the\r\nmany events which were crowding thick and fast in Paris just then, but\r\nto all, the real motive of that climax remained a puzzle and a mystery.\r\nAnyway, Marguerite St. Just married Sir Percy Blakeney one fine day,\r\njust like that, without any warning to her friends, without a _soir\xc3\xa9e\r\nde contrat_ or _d\xc3\xaener de fian\xc3\xa7ailles_ or other appurtenances of a\r\nfashionable French wedding.\r\n\r\nHow that stupid, dull Englishman ever came to be admitted within the\r\nintellectual circle which revolved round \xe2\x80\x9cthe cleverest woman in\r\nEurope,\xe2\x80\x9d as her friends unanimously called her, no one ventured to\r\nguess\xe2\x80\x94a golden key is said to open every door, asserted the more\r\nmalignantly inclined.\r\n\r\nEnough, she married him, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe cleverest woman in Europe\xe2\x80\x9d had linked\r\nher fate to that \xe2\x80\x9cdemmed idiot\xe2\x80\x9d Blakeney, and not even her most\r\nintimate friends could assign to this strange step any other motive\r\nthan that of supreme eccentricity. Those friends who knew, laughed to\r\nscorn the idea that Marguerite St. Just had married a fool for the sake\r\nof the worldly advantages with which he might endow her. They knew, as\r\na matter of fact, that Marguerite St. Just cared nothing about money,\r\nand still less about a title; moreover, there were at least half a\r\ndozen other men in the cosmopolitan world equally well-born, if not so\r\nwealthy as Blakeney, who would have been only too happy to give\r\nMarguerite St. Just any position she might choose to covet.\r\n\r\nAs for Sir Percy himself, he was universally voted to be totally\r\nunqualified for the onerous post he had taken upon himself. His chief\r\nqualifications for it seemed to consist in his blind adoration for her,\r\nhis great wealth, and the high favour in which he stood at the English\r\ncourt; but London society thought that, taking into consideration his\r\nown intellectual limitations, it would have been wiser on his part had\r\nhe bestowed those worldly advantages upon a less brilliant and witty\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nAlthough lately he had been so prominent a figure in fashionable\r\nEnglish society, he had spent most of his early life abroad. His\r\nfather, the late Sir Algernon Blakeney, had had the terrible misfortune\r\nof seeing an idolized young wife become hopelessly insane after two\r\nyears of happy married life. Percy had just been born when the late\r\nLady Blakeney fell a prey to the terrible malady which in those days\r\nwas looked upon as hopelessly incurable and nothing short of a curse of\r\nGod upon the entire family. Sir Algernon took his afflicted young wife\r\nabroad, and there presumably Percy was educated, and grew up between an\r\nimbecile mother and a distracted father, until he attained his\r\nmajority. The death of his parents following close upon one another\r\nleft him a free man, and as Sir Algernon had led a forcibly simple and\r\nretired life, the large Blakeney fortune had increased tenfold.\r\n\r\nSir Percy Blakeney had travelled a great deal abroad, before he brought\r\nhome his beautiful, young, French wife. The fashionable circles of the\r\ntime were ready to receive them both with open arms. Sir Percy was\r\nrich, his wife was accomplished, the Prince of Wales took a very great\r\nliking to them both. Within six months they were the acknowledged\r\nleaders of fashion and of style. Sir Percy\xe2\x80\x99s coats were the talk of the\r\ntown, his inanities were quoted, his foolish laugh copied by the gilded\r\nyouth at Almack\xe2\x80\x99s or the Mall. Everyone knew that he was hopelessly\r\nstupid, but then that was scarcely to be wondered at, seeing that all\r\nthe Blakeneys, for generations, had been notoriously dull, and that his\r\nmother had died an imbecile.\r\n\r\nThus society accepted him, petted him, made much of him, since his\r\nhorses were the finest in the country, his _f\xc3\xaates_ and wines the most\r\nsought after. As for his marriage with \xe2\x80\x9cthe cleverest woman in Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwell! the inevitable came with sure and rapid footsteps. No one pitied\r\nhim, since his fate was of his own making. There were plenty of young\r\nladies in England, of high birth and good looks, who would have been\r\nquite willing to help him to spend the Blakeney fortune, whilst smiling\r\nindulgently at his inanities and his good-humoured foolishness.\r\nMoreover, Sir Percy got no pity, because he seemed to require none\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nseemed very proud of his clever wife, and to care little that she took\r\nno pains to disguise that good-natured contempt which she evidently\r\nfelt for him, and that she even amused herself by sharpening her ready\r\nwits at his expense.\r\n\r\nBut then Blakeney was really too stupid to notice the ridicule with\r\nwhich his clever wife covered him, and if his matrimonial relations\r\nwith the fascinating Parisienne had not turned out all that his hopes\r\nand his dog-like devotion for her had pictured, society could never do\r\nmore than vaguely guess at it.\r\n\r\nIn his beautiful house at Richmond he played second fiddle to his\r\nclever wife with imperturbable _bonhomie_; he lavished jewels and\r\nluxuries of all kinds upon her, which she took with inimitable grace,\r\ndispensing the hospitality of his superb mansion with the same\r\ngraciousness with which she had welcomed the intellectual coterie of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nPhysically, Sir Percy Blakeney was undeniably handsome\xe2\x80\x94always excepting\r\nthe lazy, bored look which was habitual to him. He was always\r\nirreproachably dressed, and wore the exaggerated \xe2\x80\x9cIncroyable\xe2\x80\x9d fashions,\r\nwhich had just crept across from Paris to England, with the perfect\r\ngood taste innate in an English gentleman. On this special afternoon in\r\nSeptember, in spite of the long journey by coach, in spite of rain and\r\nmud, his coat set irreproachably across his fine shoulders, his hands\r\nlooked almost femininely white, as they emerged through billowy frills\r\nof finest Mechlin lace: the extravagantly short-waisted satin coat,\r\nwide-lapelled waistcoat, and tight-fitting striped breeches, set off\r\nhis massive figure to perfection, and in repose one might have admired\r\nso fine a specimen of English manhood, until the foppish ways, the\r\naffected movements, the perpetual inane laugh, brought one\xe2\x80\x99s admiration\r\nof Sir Percy Blakeney to an abrupt close.\r\n\r\nHe had lolled into the old-fashioned inn parlour, shaking the wet off\r\nhis fine overcoat; then putting up a gold-rimmed eye-glass to his lazy\r\nblue eye, he surveyed the company, upon whom an embarrassed silence had\r\nsuddenly fallen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do, Tony? How do, Ffoulkes?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, recognising the two young\r\nmen and shaking them by the hand. \xe2\x80\x9cZounds, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nsmothering a slight yawn, \xe2\x80\x9cdid you ever see such a beastly day? Demmed\r\nclimate this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a quaint little laugh, half of embarrassment and half of sarcasm,\r\nMarguerite had turned towards her husband, and was surveying him from\r\nhead to foot, with an amused little twinkle in her merry blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Percy, after a moment or two\xe2\x80\x99s silence, as no one\r\noffered any comment, \xe2\x80\x9chow sheepish you all look. . . . What\xe2\x80\x99s up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing, Sir Percy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Marguerite, with a certain amount of\r\ngaiety, which, however, sounded somewhat forced, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing to disturb\r\nyour equanimity\xe2\x80\x94only an insult to your wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe laugh which accompanied this remark was evidently intended to\r\nreassure Sir Percy as to the gravity of the incident. It apparently\r\nsucceeded in that, for, echoing the laugh, he rejoined placidly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa, m\xe2\x80\x99dear! you don\xe2\x80\x99t say so. Begad! who was the bold man who dared to\r\ntackle you\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord Tony tried to interpose, but had no time to do so, for the young\r\nVicomte had already quickly stepped forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, prefixing his little speech with an elaborate bow,\r\nand speaking in broken English, \xe2\x80\x9cmy mother, the Comtesse de Tournay de\r\nBasserive, has offenced Madame, who, I see, is your wife. I cannot ask\r\nyour pardon for my mother; what she does is right in my eyes. But I am\r\nready to offer you the usual reparation between men of honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man drew up his slim stature to its full height and looked\r\nvery enthusiastic, very proud, and very hot as he gazed at six foot odd\r\nof gorgeousness, as represented by Sir Percy Blakeney, Bart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLud, Sir Andrew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite, with one of her merry infectious\r\nlaughs, \xe2\x80\x9clook on that pretty picture\xe2\x80\x94the English turkey and the French\r\nbantam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe simile was quite perfect, and the English turkey looked down with\r\ncomplete bewilderment upon the dainty little French bantam, which\r\nhovered quite threateningly around him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa! sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Percy at last, putting up his eye-glass and\r\nsurveying the young Frenchman with undisguised wonderment, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere, in\r\nthe cuckoo\xe2\x80\x99s name, did you learn to speak English?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d protested the Vicomte, somewhat abashed at the way his\r\nwarlike attitude had been taken by the ponderous-looking Englishman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI protest \xe2\x80\x99tis marvellous!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sir Percy, imperturbably,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdemmed marvellous! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so, Tony\xe2\x80\x94eh? I vow I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak\r\nthe French lingo like that. What?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll vouch for that!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Marguerite. \xe2\x80\x9cSir Percy has a\r\nBritish accent you could cut with a knife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the Vicomte earnestly, and in still more broken\r\nEnglish, \xe2\x80\x9cI fear you have not understand. I offer you the only\r\nposseeble reparation among gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sir Percy, blandly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sword, Monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Vicomte, who, though still\r\nbewildered, was beginning to lose his temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a sportsman, Lord Tony,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite, merrily; \xe2\x80\x9cten to one\r\non the little bantam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Sir Percy was staring sleepily at the Vicomte for a moment or two,\r\nthrough his partly closed heavy lids, then he smothered another yawn,\r\nstretched his long limbs, and turned leisurely away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLud love you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered good-humouredly. \xe2\x80\x9cDemmit, young man,\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of your sword to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat the Vicomte thought and felt at that moment, when that long-limbed\r\nEnglishman treated him with such marked insolence, might fill volumes\r\nof sound reflections. . . . What he said resolved itself into a single\r\narticulate word, for all the others were choked in his throat by his\r\nsurging wrath\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA duel, Monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered.\r\n\r\nOnce more Blakeney turned, and from his high altitude looked down on\r\nthe choleric little man before him; but not even for a second did he\r\nseem to lose his own imperturbable good-humour. He laughed his own\r\npleasant and inane laugh, and burying his slender, long hands into the\r\ncapacious pockets of his overcoat, he said leisurely\xe2\x80\x94\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cA duel? La! is that what he meant? Odd\xe2\x80\x99s fish! you are a bloodthirsty\r\n young ruffian. Do you want to make a hole in a law-abiding man? . . .\r\n As for me, sir, I never fight duels,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as he placidly sat\r\n down and stretched his long, lazy legs out before him. \xe2\x80\x9cDemmed\r\n uncomfortable things, duels, ain\xe2\x80\x99t they, Tony?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow the Vicomte had no doubt vaguely heard that in England the fashion\r\nof duelling amongst gentlemen had been suppressed by the law with a\r\nvery stern hand; still to him, a Frenchman, whose notions of bravery\r\nand honour were based upon a code that had centuries of tradition to\r\nback it, the spectacle of a gentleman actually refusing to fight a duel\r\nwas little short of an enormity. In his mind he vaguely pondered\r\nwhether he should strike that long-legged Englishman in the face and\r\ncall him a coward, or whether such conduct in a lady\xe2\x80\x99s presence might\r\nbe deemed ungentlemanly, when Marguerite happily interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pray you, Lord Tony,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in that gentle, sweet, musical voice\r\nof hers, \xe2\x80\x9cI pray you play the peacemaker. The child is bursting with\r\nrage, and,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with a _soup\xc3\xa7on_ of dry sarcasm, \xe2\x80\x9cmight do Sir\r\nPercy an injury.\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed a mocking little laugh, which, however,\r\ndid not in the least disturb her husband\xe2\x80\x99s placid equanimity. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nBritish turkey has had the day,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSir Percy would provoke all\r\nthe saints in the calendar and keep his temper the while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut already Blakeney, good-humoured as ever, had joined in the laugh\r\nagainst himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemmed smart that now, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning pleasantly to the\r\nVicomte. \xe2\x80\x9cClever woman my wife, sir. . . . You will find _that_ out if\r\nyou live long enough in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Percy is in the right, Vicomte,\xe2\x80\x9d here interposed Lord Antony,\r\nlaying a friendly hand on the young Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would\r\nhardly be fitting that you should commence your career in England by\r\nprovoking him to a duel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment longer the Vicomte hesitated, then with a slight shrug of\r\nthe shoulders directed against the extraordinary code of honour\r\nprevailing in this fog-ridden island, he said with becoming dignity,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well! if Monsieur is satisfied, I have no griefs. You, mi\xe2\x80\x99lor\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nare our protector. If I have done wrong, I withdraw myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, do!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Blakeney, with a long sigh of satisfaction,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwithdraw yourself over there. Demmed excitable little puppy,\xe2\x80\x9d he added\r\nunder his breath. \xe2\x80\x9cFaith, Ffoulkes, if that\xe2\x80\x99s a specimen of the goods\r\nyou and your friends bring over from France, my advice to you is, drop\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em \xe2\x80\x99mid Channel, my friend, or I shall have to see old Pitt about it,\r\nget him to clap on a prohibitive tariff, and put you in the stocks an\r\nyou smuggle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa, Sir Percy, your chivalry misguides you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite,\r\ncoquettishly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou forget that you yourself have imported one bundle of\r\ngoods from France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlakeney slowly rose to his feet, and, making a deep and elaborate bow\r\nbefore his wife, he said with consummate gallantry,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had the pick of the market, Madame, and my taste is unerring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore so than your chivalry, I fear,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOdd\xe2\x80\x99s life, m\xe2\x80\x99dear! be reasonable! Do you think I am going to allow my\r\nbody to be made a pincushion of, by every little frog-eater who don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike the shape of your nose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLud, Sir Percy!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Lady Blakeney as she bobbed him a quaint and\r\npretty curtsey, \xe2\x80\x9cyou need not be afraid! \xe2\x80\x99Tis not the _men_ who dislike\r\nthe shape of my nose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid be demmed! Do you impugn my bravery, Madame? I don\xe2\x80\x99t patronise\r\nthe ring for nothing, do I, Tony? I\xe2\x80\x99ve put up the fists with Red Sam\r\nbefore now, and\xe2\x80\x94and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it all his own way either\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x99faith, Sir Percy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite, with a long and merry laugh,\r\nthat went echoing along the old oak rafters of the parlour, \xe2\x80\x9cI would I\r\nhad seen you then . . . ha! ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x94you must have looked a pretty\r\npicture . . . and . . . and to be afraid of a little French boy . . .\r\nha! ha! . . . ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha! ha! he! he! he!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Sir Percy, good-humouredly. \xe2\x80\x9cLa,\r\nMadame, you honour me! Zooks! Ffoulkes, mark ye that! I have made my\r\nwife laugh!\xe2\x80\x94The cleverest woman in Europe! . . . Odd\xe2\x80\x99s fish, we must\r\nhave a bowl on that!\xe2\x80\x9d and he tapped vigorously on the table near him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey! Jelly! Quick, man! Here, Jelly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarmony was once more restored. Mr. Jellyband, with a mighty effort,\r\nrecovered himself from the many emotions he had experienced within the\r\nlast half hour.\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cA bowl of punch, Jelly, hot and strong, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Percy. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\n wits that have just made a clever woman laugh must be whetted! Ha! ha!\r\n ha! Hasten, my good Jelly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, there is no time, Sir Percy,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Marguerite. \xe2\x80\x9cThe skipper\r\nwill be here directly and my brother must get on board, or the _Day\r\nDream_ will miss the tide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime, m\xe2\x80\x99dear? There is plenty of time for any gentleman to get drunk\r\nand get on board before the turn of the tide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, your ladyship,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jellyband, respectfully, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the young\r\ngentleman is coming along now with Sir Percy\xe2\x80\x99s skipper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blakeney, \xe2\x80\x9cthen Armand can join us in the merry\r\nbowl. Think you, Tony,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning towards the Vicomte, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nthat jackanapes of yours will join us in a glass? Tell him that we\r\ndrink in token of reconciliation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact you are all such merry company,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\ntrust you will forgive me if I bid my brother good-bye in another\r\nroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt would have been bad form to protest. Both Lord Antony and Sir Andrew\r\nfelt that Lady Blakeney could not altogether be in tune with them at\r\nthat moment. Her love for her brother, Armand St. Just, was deep and\r\ntouching in the extreme. He had just spent a few weeks with her in her\r\nEnglish home, and was going back to serve his country, at a moment when\r\ndeath was the usual reward for the most enduring devotion.\r\n\r\nSir Percy also made no attempt to detain his wife. With that perfect,\r\nsomewhat affected gallantry which characterised his every movement, he\r\nopened the coffee-room door for her, and made her the most approved and\r\nelaborate bow, which the fashion of the time dictated, as she sailed\r\nout of the room without bestowing on him more than a passing, slightly\r\ncontemptuous glance. Only Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, whose every thought\r\nsince he had met Suzanne de Tournay seemed keener, more gentle, more\r\ninnately sympathetic, noted the curious look of intense longing, of\r\ndeep and hopeless passion, with which the inane and flippant Sir Percy\r\nfollowed the retreating figure of his brilliant wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nTHE SECRET ORCHARD\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce outside the noisy coffee-room, alone in the dimly-lighted passage,\r\nMarguerite Blakeney seemed to breathe more freely. She heaved a deep\r\nsigh, like one who had long been oppressed with the heavy weight of\r\nconstant self-control, and she allowed a few tears to fall unheeded\r\ndown her cheeks.\r\n\r\nOutside the rain had ceased, and through the swiftly passing clouds,\r\nthe pale rays of an after-storm sun shone upon the beautiful white\r\ncoast of Kent and the quaint, irregular houses that clustered round the\r\nAdmiralty Pier. Marguerite Blakeney stepped on to the porch and looked\r\nout to sea. Silhouetted against the ever-changing sky, a graceful\r\nschooner, with white sails set, was gently dancing in the breeze. The\r\n_Day Dream_ it was, Sir Percy Blakeney\xe2\x80\x99s yacht, which was ready to take\r\nArmand St. Just back to France into the very midst of that seething,\r\nbloody Revolution which was overthrowing a monarchy, attacking a\r\nreligion, destroying a society, in order to try and rebuild upon the\r\nashes of tradition a new Utopia, of which a few men dreamed, but which\r\nnone had the power to establish.\r\n\r\nIn the distance two figures were approaching \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest\xe2\x80\x9d:\r\none, an oldish man, with a curious fringe of grey hairs round a rotund\r\nand massive chin, and who walked with that peculiar rolling gait which\r\ninvariably betrays the seafaring man: the other, a young, slight\r\nfigure, neatly and becomingly dressed in a dark, many-caped overcoat;\r\nhe was clean-shaved, and his dark hair was taken well back over a clear\r\nand noble forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmand!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite Blakeney, as soon as she saw him approaching\r\nfrom the distance, and a happy smile shone on her sweet face, even\r\nthrough the tears.\r\n\r\nA minute or two later brother and sister were locked in each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narms, while the old skipper stood respectfully on one side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much time have we got, Briggs?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lady Blakeney, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore M.\r\nSt. Just need go on board?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe ought to weigh anchor before half an hour, your ladyship,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nthe old man, pulling at his grey forelock.\r\n\r\nLinking her arm in his, Marguerite led her brother towards the cliffs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking wistfully out to sea, \xe2\x80\x9chalf an hour\r\nmore and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be far from me, Armand! Oh! I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that you\r\nare going, dear! These last few days\xe2\x80\x94whilst Percy has been away, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve had you all to myself, have slipped by like a dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not going far, sweet one,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man gently, \xe2\x80\x9ca narrow\r\nchannel to cross\xe2\x80\x94a few miles of road\xe2\x80\x94I can soon come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, \xe2\x80\x99tis not the distance, Armand\xe2\x80\x94but that awful Paris . . . just now\r\n. . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had reached the edge of the cliff. The gentle sea-breeze blew\r\nMarguerite\xe2\x80\x99s hair about her face, and sent the ends of her soft lace\r\nfichu waving round her, like a white and supple snake. She tried to\r\npierce the distance far away, beyond which lay the shores of France:\r\nthat relentless and stern France which was exacting her pound of flesh,\r\nthe blood-tax from the noblest of her sons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur own beautiful country, Marguerite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Armand, who seemed to\r\nhave divined her thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are going too far, Armand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a\r\nrepublican, so am I . . . we have the same thoughts, the same\r\nenthusiasm for liberty and equality . . . but even _you_ must think\r\nthat they are going too far . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Armand, instinctively, as he threw a quick, apprehensive\r\nglance around him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you see: you don\xe2\x80\x99t think yourself that it is safe even to speak of\r\nthese things\xe2\x80\x94here in England!\xe2\x80\x9d She clung to him suddenly with strong,\r\nalmost motherly, passion: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go, Armand!\xe2\x80\x9d she begged; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nback! What should I do if . . . if . . . if . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice was choked in sobs, her eyes, tender, blue and loving, gazed\r\nappealingly at the young man, who in his turn looked steadfastly into\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would in any case be my own brave sister,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gently, \xe2\x80\x9cwho\r\nwould remember that, when France is in peril, it is not for her sons to\r\nturn their backs on her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke, that sweet, childlike smile crept back into her face,\r\npathetic in the extreme, for it seemed drowned in tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Armand!\xe2\x80\x9d she said quaintly, \xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes wish you had not so many\r\nlofty virtues. . . . I assure you little sins are far less dangerous\r\nand uncomfortable. But you _will_ be prudent?\xe2\x80\x9d she added earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as possible . . . I promise you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, dear, I have only you . . . to . . . to care for me. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, sweet one, you have other interests now. Percy cares for you. . .\r\n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA look of strange wistfulness crept into her eyes as she murmured,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did . . . once . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t distress yourself on my account. Percy is\r\nvery good . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay!\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted energetically, \xe2\x80\x9cI will distress myself on your\r\naccount, my Margot. Listen, dear, I have not spoken of these things to\r\nyou before; something always seemed to stop me when I wished to\r\nquestion you. But, somehow, I feel as if I could not go away and leave\r\nyou now without asking you one question. . . . You need not answer it\r\nif you do not wish,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as he noted a sudden hard look, almost\r\nof apprehension, darting through her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Sir Percy Blakeney know that . . . I mean, does he know the part\r\nyou played in the arrest of the Marquis de St. Cyr?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed\xe2\x80\x94a mirthless, bitter, contemptuous laugh, which was like a\r\njarring chord in the music of her voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I denounced the Marquis de St. Cyr, you mean, to the tribunal\r\nthat ultimately sent him and all his family to the guillotine? Yes, he\r\ndoes know. . . . I told him after I married him. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou told him all the circumstances\xe2\x80\x94which so completely exonerated you\r\nfrom any blame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was too late to talk of \xe2\x80\x98circumstances\xe2\x80\x99; he heard the story from\r\nother sources; my confession came too tardily, it seems. I could no\r\nlonger plead extenuating circumstances: I could not bemean myself by\r\ntrying to explain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now I have the satisfaction, Armand, of knowing that the biggest\r\nfool in England has the most complete contempt for his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke with vehement bitterness this time, and Armand St. Just, who\r\nloved her so dearly, felt that he had placed a somewhat clumsy finger\r\nupon an aching wound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Sir Percy loved you, Margot,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLoved me?\xe2\x80\x94Well, Armand, I thought at one time that he did, or I should\r\nnot have married him. I daresay,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, speaking very rapidly, as\r\nif she were glad at last to lay down a heavy burden, which had\r\noppressed her for months, \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay that even you thought\xe2\x80\x94as everybody\r\nelse did\xe2\x80\x94that I married Sir Percy because of his wealth\xe2\x80\x94but I assure\r\nyou, dear, that it was not so. He seemed to worship me with a curious\r\nintensity of concentrated passion, which went straight to my heart. I\r\nhad never loved anyone before, as you know, and I was four-and-twenty\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94so I naturally thought that it was not in my nature to love. But\r\nit has always seemed to me that it _must_ be _heavenly_ to be loved\r\nblindly, passionately, wholly . . . worshipped, in fact\xe2\x80\x94and the very\r\nfact that Percy was slow and stupid was an attraction for me, as I\r\nthought he would love me all the more. A clever man would naturally\r\nhave other interests, an ambitious man other hopes. . . . I thought\r\nthat a fool would worship, and think of nothing else. And I was ready\r\nto respond, Armand; I would have allowed myself to be worshipped, and\r\ngiven infinite tenderness in return. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sighed\xe2\x80\x94and there was a world of disillusionment in that sigh.\r\nArmand St. Just had allowed her to speak on without interruption: he\r\nlistened to her, whilst allowing his own thoughts to run riot. It was\r\nterrible to see a young and beautiful woman\xe2\x80\x94a girl in all but\r\nname\xe2\x80\x94still standing almost at the threshold of her life, yet bereft of\r\nhope, bereft of illusions, bereft of those golden and fantastic dreams,\r\nwhich should have made her youth one long, perpetual holiday.\r\n\r\nYet perhaps\xe2\x80\x94though he loved his sister dearly\xe2\x80\x94perhaps he understood: he\r\nhad studied men in many countries, men of all ages, men of every grade\r\nof social and intellectual status, and inwardly he understood what\r\nMarguerite had left unsaid. Granted that Percy Blakeney was\r\ndull-witted, but in his slow-going mind, there would still be room for\r\nthat ineradicable pride of a descendant of a long line of English\r\ngentlemen. A Blakeney had died on Bosworth Field, another had\r\nsacrificed life and fortune for the sake of a treacherous Stuart: and\r\nthat same pride\xe2\x80\x94foolish and prejudiced as the republican Armand would\r\ncall it\xe2\x80\x94must have been stung to the quick on hearing of the sin which\r\nlay at Lady Blakeney\xe2\x80\x99s door. She had been young, misguided, ill-advised\r\nperhaps. Armand knew that: and those who took advantage of Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyouth, her impulses and imprudence, knew it still better; but Blakeney\r\nwas slow-witted, he would not listen to \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d he only clung\r\nto facts, and these had shown him Lady Blakeney denouncing a fellow-man\r\nto a tribunal that knew no pardon: and the contempt he would feel for\r\nthe deed she had done, however unwittingly, would kill that same love\r\nin him, in which sympathy and intellectuality could never have had a\r\npart.\r\n\r\nYet even now, his own sister puzzled him. Life and love have such\r\nstrange vagaries. Could it be that with the waning of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlove, Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s heart had awakened with love for him? Strange\r\nextremes meet in love\xe2\x80\x99s pathway: this woman, who had had half\r\nintellectual Europe at her feet, might perhaps have set her affections\r\non a fool. Marguerite was gazing out towards the sunset. Armand could\r\nnot see her face, but presently it seemed to him that something which\r\nglittered for a moment in the golden evening light, fell from her eyes\r\nonto her dainty fichu of lace.\r\n\r\nBut he could not broach that subject with her. He knew her strange,\r\npassionate nature so well, and knew that reserve which lurked behind\r\nher frank, open ways.\r\n They had always been together, these two, for their parents had died\r\n when Armand was still a youth, and Marguerite but a child. He, some\r\n eight years her senior, had watched over her until her marriage; had\r\n chaperoned her during those brilliant years spent in the flat of the\r\n Rue de Richelieu, and had seen her enter upon this new life of hers,\r\n here in England, with much sorrow and some foreboding.\r\n\r\nThis was his first visit to England since her marriage, and the few\r\nmonths of separation had already seemed to have built up a slight, thin\r\npartition between brother and sister; the same deep, intense love was\r\nstill there, on both sides, but each now seemed to have a secret\r\norchard, into which the other dared not penetrate.\r\n\r\nThere was much Armand St. Just could not tell his sister; the political\r\naspect of the revolution in France was changing almost every day; she\r\nmight not understand how his own views and sympathies might become\r\nmodified, even as the excesses, committed by those who had been his\r\nfriends, grew in horror and in intensity. And Marguerite could not\r\nspeak to her brother about the secrets of her heart; she hardly\r\nunderstood them herself, she only knew that, in the midst of luxury,\r\nshe felt lonely and unhappy.\r\n\r\nAnd now Armand was going away; she feared for his safety, she longed\r\nfor his presence. She would not spoil these last few sadly-sweet\r\nmoments by speaking about herself. She led him gently along the cliffs,\r\nthen down to the beach; their arms linked in one another\xe2\x80\x99s, they had\r\nstill so much to say that lay just outside that secret orchard of\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nTHE ACCREDITED AGENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was rapidly drawing to a close; and a long, chilly\r\nEnglish summer\xe2\x80\x99s evening was throwing a misty pall over the green\r\nKentish landscape.\r\n\r\nThe _Day Dream_ had set sail, and Marguerite Blakeney stood alone on\r\nthe edge of the cliff for over an hour, watching those white sails,\r\nwhich bore so swiftly away from her the only being who really cared for\r\nher, whom she dared to love, whom she knew she could trust.\r\n\r\nSome little distance away to her left the lights from the coffee-room\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest\xe2\x80\x9d glittered yellow in the gathering mist; from\r\ntime to time it seemed to her aching nerves as if she could catch from\r\nthence the sound of merry-making and of jovial talk, or even that\r\nperpetual, senseless laugh of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s, which grated continually\r\nupon her sensitive ears.\r\n\r\nSir Percy had had the delicacy to leave her severely alone. She\r\nsupposed that, in his own stupid, good-natured way, he may have\r\nunderstood that she would wish to remain alone, while those white sails\r\ndisappeared into the vague horizon, so many miles away. He, whose\r\nnotions of propriety and decorum were supersensitive, had not suggested\r\neven that an attendant should remain within call. Marguerite was\r\ngrateful to her husband for all this; she always tried to be grateful\r\nto him for his thoughtfulness, which was constant, and for his\r\ngenerosity, which really was boundless. She tried even at times to curb\r\nthe sarcastic, bitter thoughts of him, which made her\xe2\x80\x94in spite of\r\nherself\xe2\x80\x94say cruel, insulting things, which she vaguely hoped would\r\nwound him.\r\n\r\nYes! she often wished to wound him, to make him feel that she too held\r\nhim in contempt, that she too had forgotten that once she had almost\r\nloved him. Loved that inane fop! whose thoughts seemed unable to soar\r\nbeyond the tying of a cravat or the new cut of a coat. Bah! And yet! .\r\n. . vague memories, that were sweet and ardent and attuned to this calm\r\nsummer\xe2\x80\x99s evening, came wafted back to her memory, on the invisible\r\nwings of the light sea-breeze: the time when first he worshipped her;\r\nhe seemed so devoted\xe2\x80\x94a very slave\xe2\x80\x94and there was a certain latent\r\nintensity in that love which had fascinated her.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly that love, that devotion, which throughout his courtship\r\nshe had looked upon as the slavish fidelity of a dog, seemed to vanish\r\ncompletely. Twenty-four hours after the simple little ceremony at old\r\nSt. Roch, she had told him the story of how, inadvertently, she had\r\nspoken of certain matters connected with the Marquis de St. Cyr before\r\nsome men\xe2\x80\x94her friends\xe2\x80\x94who had used this information against the\r\nunfortunate Marquis, and sent him and his family to the guillotine.\r\n\r\nShe hated the Marquis. Years ago, Armand, her dear brother, had loved\r\nAng\xc3\xa8le de St. Cyr, but St. Just was a plebeian, and the Marquis full of\r\nthe pride and arrogant prejudices of his caste. One day Armand, the\r\nrespectful, timid lover, ventured on sending a small poem\xe2\x80\x94enthusiastic,\r\nardent, passionate\xe2\x80\x94to the idol of his dreams. The next night he was\r\nwaylaid just outside Paris by the valets of the Marquis de St. Cyr, and\r\nignominiously thrashed\xe2\x80\x94thrashed like a dog within an inch of his\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94because he had dared to raise his eyes to the daughter of the\r\naristocrat. The incident was one which, in those days, some two years\r\nbefore the great Revolution, was of almost daily occurrence in France;\r\nincidents of that type, in fact, led to the bloody reprisals, which a\r\nfew years later sent most of those haughty heads to the guillotine.\r\n\r\nMarguerite remembered it all: what her brother must have suffered in\r\nhis manhood and his pride must have been appalling; what she suffered\r\nthrough him and with him she never attempted even to analyse.\r\n\r\nThen the day of retribution came. St. Cyr and his kind had found their\r\nmasters, in those same plebeians whom they had despised. Armand and\r\nMarguerite, both intellectual, thinking beings, adopted with the\r\nenthusiasm of their years the Utopian doctrines of the Revolution,\r\nwhile the Marquis de St. Cyr and his family fought inch by inch for the\r\nretention of those privileges which had placed them socially above\r\ntheir fellow-men. Marguerite, impulsive, thoughtless, not calculating\r\nthe purport of her words, still smarting under the terrible insult her\r\nbrother had suffered at the Marquis\xe2\x80\x99 hands, happened to hear\xe2\x80\x94amongst\r\nher own coterie\xe2\x80\x94that the St. Cyrs were in treasonable correspondence\r\nwith Austria, hoping to obtain the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s support to quell the\r\ngrowing revolution in their own country.\r\n\r\nIn those days one denunciation was sufficient: Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s few\r\nthoughtless words anent the Marquis de St. Cyr bore fruit within\r\ntwenty-four hours. He was arrested. His papers were searched: letters\r\nfrom the Austrian Emperor, promising to send troops against the Paris\r\npopulace, were found in his desk. He was arraigned for treason against\r\nthe nation, and sent to the guillotine, whilst his family, his wife and\r\nhis sons, shared this awful fate.\r\n\r\nMarguerite, horrified at the terrible consequences of her own\r\nthoughtlessness, was powerless to save the Marquis: her own coterie,\r\nthe leaders of the revolutionary movement, all proclaimed her as a\r\nheroine: and when she married Sir Percy Blakeney, she did not perhaps\r\naltogether realise how severely he would look upon the sin, which she\r\nhad so inadvertently committed, and which still lay heavily upon her\r\nsoul. She made full confession of it to her husband, trusting to his\r\nblind love for her, her boundless power over him, to soon make him\r\nforget what might have sounded unpleasant to an English ear.\r\n\r\nCertainly at the moment he seemed to take it very quietly; hardly, in\r\nfact, did he appear to understand the meaning of all she said; but what\r\nwas more certain still, was that never after that could she detect the\r\nslightest sign of that love, which she once believed had been wholly\r\nhers. Now they had drifted quite apart, and Sir Percy seemed to have\r\nlaid aside his love for her, as he would an ill-fitting glove. She\r\ntried to rouse him by sharpening her ready wit against his dull\r\nintellect; endeavoured to excite his jealousy, if she could not rouse\r\nhis love; tried to goad him to self-assertion, but all in vain. He\r\nremained the same, always passive, drawling, sleepy, always courteous,\r\ninvariably a gentleman: she had all that the world and a wealthy\r\nhusband can give to a pretty woman, yet on this beautiful summer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nevening, with the white sails of the _Day Dream_ finally hidden by the\r\nevening shadows, she felt more lonely than that poor tramp who plodded\r\nhis way wearily along the rugged cliffs.\r\n\r\nWith another heavy sigh, Marguerite Blakeney turned her back upon the\r\nsea and cliffs, and walked slowly back towards \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAs she drew near, the sound of revelry, of gay, jovial laughter, grew\r\nlouder and more distinct. She could distinguish Sir Andrew Ffoulkes\xe2\x80\x99\r\npleasant voice, Lord Tony\xe2\x80\x99s boisterous guffaws, her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noccasional, drawly, sleepy comments; then realising the loneliness of\r\nthe road and the fast gathering gloom round her, she quickened her\r\nsteps . . . the next moment she perceived a stranger coming rapidly\r\ntowards her. Marguerite did not look up: she was not the least nervous,\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest\xe2\x80\x9d was now well within call.\r\n\r\nThe stranger paused when he saw Marguerite coming quickly towards him,\r\nand just as she was about to slip past him, he said very quietly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCitoyenne St. Just.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite uttered a little cry of astonishment, at thus hearing her\r\nown familiar maiden name uttered so close to her. She looked up at the\r\nstranger, and this time, with a cry of unfeigned pleasure, she put out\r\nboth her hands effusively towards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChauvelin!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHimself, citoyenne, at your service,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, gallantly\r\nkissing the tips of her fingers.\r\n\r\nMarguerite said nothing for a moment or two, as she surveyed with\r\nobvious delight the not very prepossessing little figure before her.\r\nChauvelin was then nearer forty than thirty\xe2\x80\x94a clever, shrewd-looking\r\npersonality, with a curious fox-like expression in the deep, sunken\r\neyes. He was the same stranger who an hour or two previously had joined\r\nMr. Jellyband in a friendly glass of wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChauvelin . . . my friend . . .\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite, with a pretty little\r\nsigh of satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cI am mightily pleased to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo doubt poor Marguerite St. Just, lonely in the midst of her grandeur,\r\nand of her starchy friends, was happy to see a face that brought back\r\nmemories of that happy time in Paris, when she reigned\xe2\x80\x94a queen\xe2\x80\x94over the\r\nintellectual coterie of the Rue de Richelieu. She did not notice the\r\nsarcastic little smile, however, that hovered round the thin lips of\r\nChauvelin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d she added merrily, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat in the world, or whom in the\r\nworld, are you doing here in England?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She had resumed her walk towards the inn, and Chauvelin turned and\r\n walked beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might return the subtle compliment, fair lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat of\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a shrug of the shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cJe m\xe2\x80\x99ennuie, mon\r\nami, that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had reached the porch of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest,\xe2\x80\x9d but Marguerite\r\nseemed loth to go within. The evening air was lovely after the storm,\r\nand she had found a friend who exhaled the breath of Paris, who knew\r\nArmand well, who could talk of all the merry, brilliant friends whom\r\nshe had left behind. So she lingered on under the pretty porch, while\r\nthrough the gaily-lighted dormer-window of the coffee-room came sounds\r\nof laughter, of calls for \xe2\x80\x9cSally\xe2\x80\x9d and for beer, of tapping of mugs, and\r\nclinking of dice, mingled with Sir Percy Blakeney\xe2\x80\x99s inane and mirthless\r\nlaugh. Chauvelin stood beside her, his shrewd, pale, yellow eyes fixed\r\non the pretty face, which looked so sweet and childlike in this soft\r\nEnglish summer twilight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou surprise me, citoyenne,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quietly, as he took a pinch of\r\nsnuff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I now?\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted gaily. \xe2\x80\x9cFaith, my little Chauvelin, I should\r\nhave thought that, with your penetration, you would have guessed that\r\nan atmosphere composed of fogs and virtues would never suit Marguerite\r\nSt. Just.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me! is it as bad as that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in mock consternation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted, \xe2\x80\x9cand worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange! Now, I thought that a pretty woman would have found English\r\ncountry life peculiarly attractive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! so did I,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cPretty women,\xe2\x80\x9d she added\r\nmeditatively, \xe2\x80\x9cought to have a good time in England, since all the\r\npleasant things are forbidden them\xe2\x80\x94the very things they do every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll hardly believe it, my little Chauvelin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said earnestly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I often pass a whole day\xe2\x80\x94a whole day\xe2\x80\x94without encountering a single\r\ntemptation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Chauvelin, gallantly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the cleverest woman\r\nin Europe is troubled with _ennui_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed one of her melodious, rippling, childlike laughs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be pretty bad, mustn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said archly, \xe2\x80\x9cor I should not\r\nhave been so pleased to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this within a year of a romantic love match! . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! . . . a year of a romantic love match . . . that\xe2\x80\x99s just the\r\ndifficulty . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! . . . that idyllic folly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin, with quiet sarcasm,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdid not then survive the lapse of . . . weeks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIdyllic follies never last, my little Chauvelin. . . . They come upon\r\nus like the measles . . . and are as easily cured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChauvelin took another pinch of snuff: he seemed very much addicted to\r\nthat pernicious habit, so prevalent in those days; perhaps, too, he\r\nfound the taking of snuff a convenient veil for disguising the quick,\r\nshrewd glances with which he strove to read the very souls of those\r\nwith whom he came in contact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, with the same gallantry, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the most\r\nactive brain in Europe is troubled with _ennui_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in hopes that you had a prescription against the malady, my\r\nlittle Chauvelin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I hope to succeed in that which Sir Percy Blakeney has failed\r\nto accomplish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we leave Sir Percy out of the question for the present, my dear\r\nfriend?\xe2\x80\x9d she said drily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my dear lady, pardon me, but that is just what we cannot very well\r\ndo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin, whilst once again his eyes, keen as those of a fox\r\non the alert, darted a quick glance at Marguerite. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a most\r\nperfect prescription against the worst form of _ennui_, which I would\r\nhave been happy to submit to you, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere _is_ Sir Percy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has he to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite a good deal, I am afraid. The prescription I would offer, fair\r\nlady, is called by a very plebeian name: Work!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWork?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChauvelin looked at Marguerite long and scrutinisingly. It seemed as if\r\nthose keen, pale eyes of his were reading every one of her thoughts.\r\nThey were alone together; the evening air was quite still, and their\r\nsoft whispers were drowned in the noise which came from the\r\ncoffee-room. Still, Chauvelin took a step or two from under the porch,\r\nlooked quickly and keenly all round him, then, seeing that indeed no\r\none was within earshot, he once more came back close to Marguerite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you render France a small service, citoyenne?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with a\r\nsudden change of manner, which lent his thin, fox-like face singular\r\nearnestness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa, man!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied flippantly, \xe2\x80\x9chow serious you look all of a\r\nsudden. . . . Indeed I do not know if I _would_ render France a small\r\nservice\xe2\x80\x94at any rate, it depends upon the kind of service she\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever heard of the Scarlet Pimpernel, Citoyenne St. Just?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked Chauvelin, abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeard of the Scarlet Pimpernel?\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted with a long and merry\r\nlaugh, \xe2\x80\x9cFaith, man! we talk of nothing else. . . . We have hats \xe2\x80\x98\xc3\xa0 la\r\nScarlet Pimpernel\xe2\x80\x99; our horses are called \xe2\x80\x98Scarlet Pimpernel\xe2\x80\x99; at the\r\nPrince of Wales\xe2\x80\x99 supper party the other night we had a \xe2\x80\x98ouffl\xc3\xa9 \xc3\xa0 la\r\nScarlet Pimpernel.\xe2\x80\x99 . . . Lud!\xe2\x80\x9d she added gaily, \xe2\x80\x9cthe other day I\r\nordered at my milliner\xe2\x80\x99s a blue dress trimmed with green, and bless me,\r\nif she did not call that \xe2\x80\x98\xc3\xa0 la Scarlet Pimpernel.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChauvelin had not moved while she prattled merrily along; he did not\r\neven attempt to stop her when her musical voice and her childlike laugh\r\nwent echoing through the still evening air. But he remained serious and\r\nearnest whilst she laughed, and his voice, clear, incisive, and hard,\r\nwas not raised above his breath as he said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, as you have heard of that enigmatical personage, citoyenne, you\r\nmust also have guessed, and known, that the man who hides his identity\r\nunder that strange pseudonym, is the most bitter enemy of our republic,\r\nof France . . . of men like Armand St. Just.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa! . . .\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a quaint little sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cI dare swear he is. .\r\n. . France has many bitter enemies these days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you, citoyenne, are a daughter of France, and should be ready to\r\nhelp her in a moment of deadly peril.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother Armand devotes his life to France,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted proudly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cas for me, I can do nothing . . . here in England. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you . . .\xe2\x80\x9d he urged still more earnestly, whilst his thin\r\nfox-like face seemed suddenly to have grown impressive and full of\r\ndignity, \xe2\x80\x9chere, in England, citoyenne . . . you alone can help us. . .\r\n. Listen!\xe2\x80\x94I have been sent over here by the Republican Government as\r\nits representative: I present my credentials to Mr. Pitt in London\r\nto-morrow. One of my duties here is to find out all about this League\r\nof the Scarlet Pimpernel, which has become a standing menace to France,\r\nsince it is pledged to help our cursed aristocrats\xe2\x80\x94traitors to their\r\ncountry, and enemies of the people\xe2\x80\x94to escape from the just punishment\r\nwhich they deserve. You know as well as I do, citoyenne, that once they\r\nare over here, those French _\xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s_ try to rouse public feeling\r\nagainst the Republic. . . . They are ready to join issue with any enemy\r\nbold enough to attack France. . . . Now, within the last month, scores\r\nof these _\xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s_, some only suspected of treason, others actually\r\ncondemned by the Tribunal of Public Safety, have succeeded in crossing\r\nthe Channel. Their escape in each instance was planned, organised and\r\neffected by this society of young English jackanapes, headed by a man\r\nwhose brain seems as resourceful as his identity is mysterious. All the\r\nmost strenuous efforts on the part of my spies have failed to discover\r\nwho he is; whilst the others are the hands, he is the head, who beneath\r\nthis strange anonymity calmly works at the destruction of France. I\r\nmean to strike at that head, and for this I want your help\xe2\x80\x94through him\r\nafterwards I can reach the rest of the gang: he is a young buck in\r\nEnglish society, of that I feel sure. Find that man for me, citoyenne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe urged, \xe2\x80\x9cfind him for France!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite had listened to Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s impassioned speech without\r\nuttering a word, scarce making a movement, hardly daring to breathe.\r\nShe had told him before that this mysterious hero of romance was the\r\ntalk of the smart set to which she belonged; already, before this, her\r\nheart and her imagination had been stirred by the thought of the brave\r\nman, who, unknown to fame, had rescued hundreds of lives from a\r\nterrible, often an unmerciful fate. She had but little real sympathy\r\nwith those haughty French aristocrats, insolent in their pride of\r\ncaste, of whom the Comtesse de Tournay de Basserive was so typical an\r\nexample; but, republican and liberal-minded though she was from\r\nprinciple, she hated and loathed the methods which the young Republic\r\nhad chosen for establishing itself. She had not been in Paris for some\r\nmonths; the horrors and bloodshed of the Reign of Terror, culminating\r\nin the September massacres, had only come across the Channel to her as\r\na faint echo. Robespierre, Danton, Marat, she had not known in their\r\nnew guise of bloody justiciaries, merciless wielders of the guillotine.\r\nHer very soul recoiled in horror from these excesses, to which she\r\nfeared her brother Armand\xe2\x80\x94moderate republican as he was\xe2\x80\x94might become\r\none day the holocaust.\r\n\r\nThen, when first she heard of this band of young English enthusiasts,\r\nwho, for sheer love of their fellow-men, dragged women and children,\r\nold and young men, from a horrible death, her heart had glowed with\r\npride for them, and now, as Chauvelin spoke, her very soul went out to\r\nthe gallant and mysterious leader of the reckless little band, who\r\nrisked his life daily, who gave it freely and without ostentation, for\r\nthe sake of humanity.\r\n\r\nHer eyes were moist when Chauvelin had finished speaking, the lace at\r\nher bosom rose and fell with her quick, excited breathing; she no\r\nlonger heard the noise of drinking from the inn, she did not heed her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s voice or his inane laugh, her thoughts had gone wandering in\r\nsearch of the mysterious hero! Ah! there was a man she might have\r\nloved, had he come her way: everything in him appealed to her romantic\r\nimagination; his personality, his strength, his bravery, the loyalty of\r\nthose who served under him in the same noble cause, and, above all,\r\nthat anonymity which crowned him, as if with a halo of romantic glory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind him for France, citoyenne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s voice close to her ear roused her from her dreams. The\r\nmysterious hero had vanished, and, not twenty yards away from her, a\r\nman was drinking and laughing, to whom she had sworn faith and loyalty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa! man,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a return of her assumed flippancy, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\nastonishing. Where in the world am I to look for him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go everywhere, citoyenne,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Chauvelin, insinuatingly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Blakeney is the pivot of social London, so I am told . . . you\r\nsee everything, you _hear_ everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasy, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Marguerite, drawing herself up to her full\r\nheight and looking down, with a slight thought of contempt on the\r\nsmall, thin figure before her. \xe2\x80\x9cEasy! you seem to forget that there are\r\nsix feet of Sir Percy Blakeney, and a long line of ancestors to stand\r\nbetween Lady Blakeney and such a thing as you propose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the sake of France, citoyenne!\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Chauvelin, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTush, man, you talk nonsense anyway; for even if you did know who this\r\nScarlet Pimpernel is, you could do nothing to him\xe2\x80\x94an Englishman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d take my chance of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin, with a dry, rasping\r\nlittle laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate we could send him to the guillotine first to\r\ncool his ardour, then, when there is a diplomatic fuss about it, we can\r\napologise\xe2\x80\x94humbly\xe2\x80\x94to the British Government, and, if necessary, pay\r\ncompensation to the bereaved family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you propose is horrible, Chauvelin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, drawing away from\r\nhim as from some noisome insect. \xe2\x80\x9cWhoever the man may be, he is brave\r\nand noble, and never\xe2\x80\x94do you hear me?\xe2\x80\x94never would I lend a hand to such\r\nvillainy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou prefer to be insulted by every French aristocrat who comes to this\r\ncountry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChauvelin had taken sure aim when he shot this tiny shaft. Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfresh young cheeks became a thought more pale and she bit her under\r\nlip, for she would not let him see that the shaft had struck home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is beside the question,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last with indifference. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan defend myself, but I refuse to do any dirty work for you\xe2\x80\x94or for\r\nFrance. You have other means at your disposal; you must use them, my\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd without another look at Chauvelin, Marguerite Blakeney turned her\r\nback on him and walked straight into the inn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not your last word, citoyenne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin, as a flood of\r\nlight from the passage illumined her elegant, richly-clad figure, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nmeet in London, I hope!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe meet in London,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, speaking over her shoulder at him, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nthat is my last word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe threw open the coffee-room door and disappeared from his view, but\r\nhe remained under the porch for a moment or two, taking a pinch of\r\nsnuff. He had received a rebuke and a snub, but his shrewd, fox-like\r\nface looked neither abashed nor disappointed; on the contrary, a\r\ncurious smile, half sarcastic and wholly satisfied, played around the\r\ncorners of his thin lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nTHE OUTRAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nA beautiful starlit night had followed on the day of incessant rain: a\r\ncool, balmy, late summer\xe2\x80\x99s night, essentially English in its suggestion\r\nof moisture and scent of wet earth and dripping leaves.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent coach, drawn by four of the finest thoroughbreds in\r\nEngland, had driven off along the London road, with Sir Percy Blakeney\r\non the box, holding the reins in his slender feminine hands, and beside\r\nhim Lady Blakeney wrapped in costly furs. A fifty-mile drive on a\r\nstarlit summer\xe2\x80\x99s night! Marguerite had hailed the notion of it with\r\ndelight. . . . Sir Percy was an enthusiastic whip; his four\r\nthoroughbreds, which had been sent down to Dover a couple of days\r\nbefore, were just sufficiently fresh and restive to add zest to the\r\nexpedition, and Marguerite revelled in anticipation of the few hours of\r\nsolitude, with the soft night breeze fanning her cheeks, her thoughts\r\nwandering, whither away? She knew from old experience that Sir Percy\r\nwould speak little, if at all: he had often driven her on his beautiful\r\ncoach for hours at night, from point to point, without making more than\r\none or two casual remarks upon the weather or the state of the roads.\r\nHe was very fond of driving by night, and she had very quickly adopted\r\nhis fancy: as she sat next to him hour after hour, admiring the\r\ndexterous, certain way in which he handled the reins, she often\r\nwondered what went on in that slow-going head of his. He never told\r\nher, and she had never cared to ask.\r\n\r\nAt \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Jellyband was going the round, putting\r\nout the lights. His bar customers had all gone, but upstairs in the\r\nsnug little bedrooms, Mr. Jellyband had quite a few important guests:\r\nthe Comtesse de Tournay, with Suzanne, and the Vicomte, and there were\r\ntwo more bedrooms ready for Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and Lord Antony\r\nDewhurst, if the two young men should elect to honour the ancient\r\nhostelry and stay the night.\r\n\r\nFor the moment these two young gallants were comfortably installed in\r\nthe coffee-room, before the huge log-fire, which, in spite of the\r\nmildness of the evening, had been allowed to burn merrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Jelly, has everyone gone?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lord Tony, as the worthy\r\nlandlord still busied himself clearing away glasses and mugs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone, as you see, my lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all your servants gone to bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll except the boy on duty in the bar, and,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr. Jellyband with\r\na laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cI expect he\xe2\x80\x99ll be asleep afore long, the rascal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we can talk here undisturbed for half an hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt your service, my lord. . . . I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave your candles on the dresser\r\n. . . and your rooms are quite ready . . . I sleep at the top of the\r\nhouse myself, but if your lordship\xe2\x80\x99ll only call loudly enough, I\r\ndaresay I shall hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Jelly . . . and . . . I say, put the lamp out\xe2\x80\x94the fire\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngive us all the light we need\xe2\x80\x94and we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to attract the\r\npasser-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll ri\xe2\x80\x99, my lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Jellyband did as he was bid\xe2\x80\x94he turned out the quaint old lamp that\r\nhung from the raftered ceiling and blew out all the candles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have a bottle of wine, Jelly,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll ri\xe2\x80\x99, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJellyband went off to fetch the wine. The room now was quite dark, save\r\nfor the circle of ruddy and fitful light formed by the brightly blazing\r\nlogs in the hearth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jellyband, as he returned with a bottle\r\nof wine and a couple of glasses, which he placed on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do nicely, thanks, Jelly!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Tony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, my lord! Good-night, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Jelly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two young men listened, whilst the heavy tread of Mr. Jellyband was\r\nheard echoing along the passage and staircase. Presently even that\r\nsound died out, and the whole of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest\xe2\x80\x9d seemed wrapt in\r\nsleep, save the two young men drinking in silence beside the hearth.\r\n\r\nFor a while no sound was heard, even in the coffee-room, save the\r\nticking of the old grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s clock and the crackling of the burning\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right again this time, Ffoulkes?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lord Antony at last.\r\n\r\nSir Andrew had been dreaming evidently, gazing into the fire, and\r\nseeing therein, no doubt, a pretty, piquant face, with large brown eyes\r\nand a wealth of dark curls round a childish forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, still musing, \xe2\x80\x9call right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo hitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord Antony laughed pleasantly as he poured himself out another glass\r\nof wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need not ask, I suppose, whether you found the journey pleasant this\r\ntime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, friend, you need not ask,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir Andrew, gaily. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was all\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen here\xe2\x80\x99s to her very good health,\xe2\x80\x9d said jovial Lord Tony. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbonnie lass, though she _is_ a French one. And here\xe2\x80\x99s to your\r\ncourtship\xe2\x80\x94may it flourish and prosper exceedingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drained his glass to the last drop, then joined his friend beside\r\nthe hearth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! you\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing the journey next, Tony, I expect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir\r\nAndrew, rousing himself from his meditations, \xe2\x80\x9cyou and Hastings,\r\ncertainly; and I hope you may have as pleasant a task as I had, and as\r\ncharming a travelling companion. You have no idea, Tony. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted his friend pleasantly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your\r\nword for it. And now,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, whilst a sudden earnestness crept over\r\nhis jovial young face, \xe2\x80\x9chow about business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The two young men drew their chairs closer together, and\r\n instinctively, though they were alone, their voices sank to a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw the Scarlet Pimpernel alone, for a few moments in Calais,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSir Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9ca day or two ago. He crossed over to England two days\r\nbefore we did. He had escorted the party all the way from Paris,\r\ndressed\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll never credit it!\xe2\x80\x94as an old market woman, and\r\ndriving\xe2\x80\x94until they were safely out of the city\xe2\x80\x94the covered cart, under\r\nwhich the Comtesse de Tournay, Mlle. Suzanne, and the Vicomte lay\r\nconcealed among the turnips and cabbages. They, themselves, of course,\r\nnever suspected who their driver was. He drove them right through a\r\nline of soldiery and a yelling mob, who were screaming, \xe2\x80\x98\xc3\x80 bas les\r\naristos!\xe2\x80\x99 But the market cart got through along with some others, and\r\nthe Scarlet Pimpernel, in shawl, petticoat and hood, yelled \xe2\x80\x98\xc3\x80 bas les\r\naristos!\xe2\x80\x99 louder than anybody. Faith!\xe2\x80\x9d added the young man, as his eyes\r\nglowed with enthusiasm for the beloved leader, \xe2\x80\x9cthat man\xe2\x80\x99s a marvel!\r\nHis cheek is preposterous, I vow!\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s what carries him through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord Antony, whose vocabulary was more limited than that of his friend,\r\ncould only find an oath or two with which to show his admiration for\r\nhis leader.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wants you and Hastings to meet him at Calais,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Andrew,\r\nmore quietly, \xe2\x80\x9con the 2nd of next month. Let me see! that will be next\r\nWednesday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, of course, the case of the Comte de Tournay, this time; a\r\ndangerous task, for the Comte, whose escape from his ch\xc3\xa2teau, after he\r\nhad been declared a \xe2\x80\x98suspect\xe2\x80\x99 by the Committee of Public Safety, was a\r\nmasterpiece of the Scarlet Pimpernel\xe2\x80\x99s ingenuity, is now under sentence\r\nof death. It will be rare sport to get _him_ out of France, and you\r\nwill have a narrow escape, if you get through at all. St. Just has\r\nactually gone to meet him\xe2\x80\x94of course, no one suspects St. Just as yet;\r\nbut after that . . . to get them both out of the country! I\xe2\x80\x99faith,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99twill be a tough job, and tax even the ingenuity of our chief. I hope\r\nI may yet have orders to be of the party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any special instructions for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! rather more precise ones than usual. It appears that the\r\nRepublican Government have sent an accredited agent over to England, a\r\nman named Chauvelin, who is said to be terribly bitter against our\r\nleague, and determined to discover the identity of our leader, so that\r\nhe may have him kidnapped, the next time he attempts to set foot in\r\nFrance. This Chauvelin has brought a whole army of spies with him, and\r\nuntil the chief has sampled the lot, he thinks we should meet as seldom\r\nas possible on the business of the league, and on no account should\r\ntalk to each other in public places for a time. When he wants to speak\r\nto us, he will contrive to let us know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two young men were both bending over the fire, for the blaze had\r\ndied down, and only a red glow from the dying embers cast a lurid light\r\non a narrow semicircle in front of the hearth. The rest of the room lay\r\nburied in complete gloom; Sir Andrew had taken a pocket-book from his\r\npocket, and drawn therefrom a paper, which he unfolded, and together\r\nthey tried to read it by the dim red firelight. So intent were they\r\nupon this, so wrapt up in the cause, the business they had so much at\r\nheart, so precious was this document which came from the very hand of\r\ntheir adored leader, that they had eyes and ears only for that. They\r\nlost count of the sounds around them, of the dropping of crisp ash from\r\nthe grate, of the monotonous ticking of the clock, of the soft, almost\r\nimperceptible rustle of something on the floor close beside them. A\r\nfigure had emerged from under one of the benches; with snake-like,\r\nnoiseless movements it crept closer and closer to the two young men,\r\nnot breathing, only gliding along the floor, in the inky blackness of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are to read these instructions and commit them to memory,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSir Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cthen destroy them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was about to replace the letter-case into his pocket, when a tiny\r\nslip of paper fluttered from it and fell on to the floor. Lord Antony\r\nstooped and picked it up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir Andrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt dropped out of your pocket just now. It certainly did not seem to\r\nbe with the other paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange!\xe2\x80\x94I wonder when it got there? It is from the chief,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nglancing at the paper.\r\n\r\nBoth stooped to try and decipher this last tiny scrap of paper on which\r\na few words had been hastily scrawled, when suddenly a slight noise\r\nattracted their attention, which seemed to come from the passage\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said both instinctively. Lord Antony crossed the room\r\ntowards the door, which he threw open quickly and suddenly; at that\r\nvery moment he received a stunning blow between the eyes, which threw\r\nhim back violently into the room. Simultaneously the crouching,\r\nsnake-like figure in the gloom had jumped up and hurled itself from\r\nbehind upon the unsuspecting Sir Andrew, felling him to the ground.\r\n\r\nAll this occurred within the short space of two or three seconds, and\r\nbefore either Lord Antony or Sir Andrew had time or chance to utter a\r\ncry or to make the faintest struggle. They were each seized by two men,\r\na muffler was quickly tied round the mouth of each, and they were\r\npinioned to one another back to back, their arms, hands, and legs\r\nsecurely fastened.\r\n\r\nOne man had in the meanwhile quietly shut the door; he wore a mask and\r\nnow stood motionless while the others completed their work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll safe, citoyen!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the men, as he took a final survey of\r\nthe bonds which secured the two young men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man at the door; \xe2\x80\x9cnow search their pockets and give\r\nme all the papers you find.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was promptly and quietly done. The masked man having taken\r\npossession of all the papers, listened for a moment or two if there\r\nwere any sound within \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest.\xe2\x80\x9d Evidently satisfied that\r\nthis dastardly outrage had remained unheard, he once more opened the\r\ndoor and pointed peremptorily down the passage. The four men lifted Sir\r\nAndrew and Lord Antony from the ground, and as quietly, as noiselessly\r\nas they had come, they bore the two pinioned young gallants out of the\r\ninn and along the Dover Road into the gloom beyond.\r\n\r\nIn the coffee-room the masked leader of this daring attempt was quickly\r\nglancing through the stolen papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bad day\xe2\x80\x99s work on the whole,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, as he quietly took\r\noff his mask, and his pale, fox-like eyes glittered in the red glow of\r\nthe fire. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a bad day\xe2\x80\x99s work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe opened one or two more letters from Sir Andrew Ffoulkes\xe2\x80\x99\r\npocket-book, noted the tiny scrap of paper which the two young men had\r\nonly just had time to read; but one letter specially, signed Armand St.\r\nJust, seemed to give him strange satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmand St. Just a traitor after all,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, fair\r\nMarguerite Blakeney,\xe2\x80\x9d he added viciously between his clenched teeth, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink that you will help me to find the Scarlet Pimpernel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nIN THE OPERA BOX\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one of the gala nights at Covent Garden Theatre, the first of\r\nthe autumn season in this memorable year of grace 1792.\r\n\r\nThe house was packed, both in the smart orchestra boxes and the pit, as\r\nwell as in the more plebeian balconies and galleries above. Gl\xc3\xbcck\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_Orpheus_ made a strong appeal to the more intellectual portions of the\r\nhouse, whilst the fashionable women, the gaily-dressed and brilliant\r\nthrong, spoke to the eye of those who cared but little for this \xe2\x80\x9clatest\r\nimportation from Germany.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelina Storace had been duly applauded after her grand _aria_ by her\r\nnumerous admirers; Benjamin Incledon, the acknowledged favourite of the\r\nladies, had received special gracious recognition from the royal box;\r\nand now the curtain came down after the glorious finale to the second\r\nact, and the audience, which had hung spell-bound on the magic strains\r\nof the great maestro, seemed collectively to breathe a long sigh of\r\nsatisfaction, previous to letting loose its hundreds of waggish and\r\nfrivolous tongues.\r\n\r\n In the smart orchestra boxes many well-known faces were to be seen.\r\n Mr. Pitt, overweighted with cares of state, was finding brief\r\n relaxation in to-night\xe2\x80\x99s musical treat; the Prince of Wales, jovial,\r\n rotund, somewhat coarse and commonplace in appearance, moved about\r\n from box to box, spending brief quarters of an hour with those of his\r\n more intimate friends.\r\n\r\nIn Lord Grenville\xe2\x80\x99s box, too, a curious, interesting personality\r\nattracted everyone\xe2\x80\x99s attention; a thin, small figure with shrewd,\r\nsarcastic face and deep-set eyes, attentive to the music, keenly\r\ncritical of the audience, dressed in immaculate black, with dark hair\r\nfree from any powder. Lord Grenville\xe2\x80\x94Foreign Secretary of State\xe2\x80\x94paid\r\nhim marked, though frigid deference.\r\n\r\nHere and there, dotted about among distinctly English types of beauty,\r\none or two foreign faces stood out in marked contrast: the haughty\r\naristocratic cast of countenance of the many French royalist _\xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s_\r\nwho, persecuted by the relentless, revolutionary faction of their\r\ncountry, had found a peaceful refuge in England. On these faces sorrow\r\nand care were deeply writ; the women especially paid but little heed,\r\neither to the music or to the brilliant audience; no doubt their\r\nthoughts were far away with husband, brother, son maybe, still in\r\nperil, or lately succumbed to a cruel fate.\r\n\r\nAmong these the Comtesse de Tournay de Basserive, but lately arrived\r\nfrom France, was a most conspicuous figure: dressed in deep, heavy\r\nblack silk, with only a white lace kerchief to relieve the aspect of\r\nmourning about her person, she sat beside Lady Portarles, who was\r\nvainly trying by witty sallies and somewhat broad jokes, to bring a\r\nsmile to the Comtesse\xe2\x80\x99s sad mouth. Behind her sat little Suzanne and\r\nthe Vicomte, both silent and somewhat shy among so many strangers.\r\nSuzanne\xe2\x80\x99s eyes seemed wistful; when she first entered the crowded\r\nhouse, she had looked eagerly all around, scanned every face,\r\nscrutinised every box. Evidently the one face she wished to see was not\r\nthere, for she settled herself down quietly behind her mother, listened\r\napathetically to the music, and took no further interest in the\r\naudience itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Lord Grenville,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Portarles, as following a discreet\r\nknock, the clever, interesting head of the Secretary of State appeared\r\nin the doorway of the box, \xe2\x80\x9cyou could not arrive more _\xc3\xa0 propos_. Here\r\nis Madame la Comtesse de Tournay positively dying to hear the latest\r\nnews from France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe distinguished diplomatist had come forward and was shaking hands\r\nwith the ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d he said sadly, \xe2\x80\x9cit is of the very worst. The massacres\r\ncontinue; Paris literally reeks with blood; and the guillotine claims a\r\nhundred victims a day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPale and tearful, the Comtesse was leaning back in her chair, listening\r\nhorror-struck to this brief and graphic account of what went on in her\r\nown misguided country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Monsieur!\xe2\x80\x9d she said in broken English, \xe2\x80\x9cit is dreadful to hear all\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94and my poor husband still in that awful country. It is terrible\r\nfor me to be sitting here, in a theatre, all safe and in peace, whilst\r\nhe is in such peril.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLud, Madame!\xe2\x80\x9d said honest, bluff Lady Portarles, \xe2\x80\x9cyour sitting in a\r\nconvent won\xe2\x80\x99t make your husband safe, and you have your children to\r\nconsider: they are too young to be dosed with anxiety and premature\r\nmourning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Comtesse smiled through her tears at the vehemence of her friend.\r\nLady Portarles, whose voice and manner would not have misfitted a\r\njockey, had a heart of gold, and hid the most genuine sympathy and most\r\ngentle kindliness, beneath the somewhat coarse manners affected by some\r\nladies at that time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides which, Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d added Lord Grenville, \xe2\x80\x9cdid you not tell me\r\nyesterday that the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel had pledged their\r\nhonour to bring M. le Comte safely across the Channel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Comtesse, \xe2\x80\x9cand that is my only hope. I saw Lord\r\nHastings yesterday . . . he reassured me again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I am sure you need have no fear. What the league have sworn, that\r\nthey surely will accomplish. Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d added the old diplomatist with a\r\nsigh, \xe2\x80\x9cif I were but a few years younger . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa, man!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted honest Lady Portarles, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are still young\r\nenough to turn your back on that French scarecrow that sits enthroned\r\nin your box to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could . . . but your ladyship must remember that in serving\r\nour country we must put prejudices aside. M. Chauvelin is the\r\naccredited agent of his Government . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOdd\xe2\x80\x99s fish, man!\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t call those bloodthirsty\r\nruffians over there a government, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has not been thought advisable as yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Minister,\r\nguardedly, \xe2\x80\x9cfor England to break off diplomatic relations with France,\r\nand we cannot therefore refuse to receive with courtesy the agent she\r\nwishes to send to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiplomatic relations be demmed, my lord! That sly little fox over\r\nthere is nothing but a spy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find\xe2\x80\x94an I\xe2\x80\x99m much\r\nmistaken, that he\xe2\x80\x99ll concern himself little with diplomacy, beyond\r\ntrying to do mischief to royalist refugees\xe2\x80\x94to our heroic Scarlet\r\nPimpernel and to the members of that brave little league.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Comtesse, pursing up her thin lips, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if this\r\nChauvelin wishes to do us mischief, he will find a faithful ally in\r\nLady Blakeney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless the woman!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Lady Portarles, \xe2\x80\x9cdid ever anyone see such\r\nperversity? My Lord Grenville, you have the gift of the gab, will you\r\nplease explain to Madame la Comtesse that she is acting like a fool. In\r\nyour position here in England, Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, turning a wrathful\r\nand resolute face towards the Comtesse, \xe2\x80\x9cyou cannot afford to put on\r\nthe hoity-toity airs you French aristocrats are so fond of. Lady\r\nBlakeney may or may not be in sympathy with those ruffians in France;\r\nshe may or may not have had anything to do with the arrest and\r\ncondemnation of St. Cyr, or whatever the man\xe2\x80\x99s name is, but she is the\r\nleader of fashion in this country; Sir Percy Blakeney has more money\r\nthan any half-dozen other men put together, he is hand and glove with\r\nroyalty, and your trying to snub Lady Blakeney will not harm her, but\r\nwill make you look a fool. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that so, my lord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut what Lord Grenville thought of this matter, or to what reflections\r\nthis homely tirade of Lady Portarles led the Comtesse de Tournay,\r\nremained unspoken, for the curtain had just risen on the third act of\r\n_Orpheus_, and admonishments to silence came from every part of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nLord Grenville took a hasty farewell of the ladies and slipped back\r\ninto his box, where M. Chauvelin had sat all through this _entr\xe2\x80\x99acte_,\r\nwith his eternal snuff-box in his hand, and with his keen pale eyes\r\nintently fixed upon a box opposite to him, where, with much frou-frou\r\nof silken skirts, much laughter and general stir of curiosity amongst\r\nthe audience, Marguerite Blakeney had just entered, accompanied by her\r\nhusband, and looking divinely pretty beneath the wealth of her golden,\r\nreddish curls, slightly besprinkled with powder, and tied back at the\r\nnape of her graceful neck with a gigantic black bow. Always dressed in\r\nthe very latest vagary of fashion, Marguerite alone among the ladies\r\nthat night had discarded the cross-over fichu and broad-lapelled\r\nover-dress, which had been in fashion for the last two or three years.\r\nShe wore the short-waisted classical-shaped gown, which so soon was to\r\nbecome the approved mode in every country in Europe. It suited her\r\ngraceful, regal figure to perfection, composed as it was of shimmering\r\nstuff which seemed a mass of rich gold embroidery.\r\n\r\nAs she entered, she leant for a moment out of the box, taking stock of\r\nall those present whom she knew. Many bowed to her as she did so, and\r\nfrom the royal box there came also a quick and gracious salute.\r\n\r\nChauvelin watched her intently all through the commencement of the\r\nthird act, as she sat enthralled with the music, her exquisite little\r\nhand toying with a small jewelled fan, her regal head, her throat, arms\r\nand neck covered with magnificent diamonds and rare gems, the gift of\r\nthe adoring husband who sprawled leisurely by her side.\r\n\r\nMarguerite was passionately fond of music. _Orpheus_ charmed her\r\nto-night. The very joy of living was writ plainly upon the sweet young\r\nface, it sparkled out of the merry blue eyes and lit up the smile that\r\nlurked around the lips. She was after all but five-and-twenty, in the\r\nheyday of youth, the darling of a brilliant throng, adored, _f\xc3\xaated_,\r\npetted, cherished. Two days ago the _Day Dream_ had returned from\r\nCalais, bringing her news that her idolised brother had safely landed,\r\nthat he thought of her, and would be prudent for her sake.\r\n\r\nWhat wonder for the moment, and listening to Gl\xc3\xbcck\xe2\x80\x99s impassioned\r\nstrains, that she forgot her disillusionments, forgot her vanished\r\nlove-dreams, forgot even the lazy, good-humoured nonentity who had made\r\nup for his lack of spiritual attainments by lavishing worldly\r\nadvantages upon her.\r\n\r\nHe had stayed beside her in the box just as long as convention\r\ndemanded, making way for His Royal Highness, and for the host of\r\nadmirers who in a continued procession came to pay homage to the queen\r\nof fashion. Sir Percy had strolled away, to talk to more congenial\r\nfriends probably. Marguerite did not even wonder whither he had\r\ngone\xe2\x80\x94she cared so little; she had had a little court round her,\r\ncomposed of the _jeunesse dor\xc3\xa9e_ of London, and had just dismissed them\r\nall, wishing to be alone with Gl\xc3\xbcck for a brief while.\r\n\r\nA discreet knock at the door roused her from her enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with some impatience, without turning to look at\r\nthe intruder.\r\n\r\nChauvelin, waiting for his opportunity, noted that she was alone, and\r\nnow, without pausing for that impatient \xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d he quietly slipped\r\ninto the box, and the next moment was standing behind Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA word with you, citoyenne,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quietly.\r\n\r\nMarguerite turned quickly, in alarm, which was not altogether feigned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLud, man! you frightened me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a forced little laugh,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyour presence is entirely inopportune. I want to listen to Gl\xc3\xbcck, and\r\nhave no mind for talking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is my only opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as quietly, and without\r\nwaiting for permission, he drew a chair close behind her\xe2\x80\x94so close that\r\nhe could whisper in her ear, without disturbing the audience, and\r\nwithout being seen, in the dark background of the box. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my only\r\nopportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, as she vouchsafed him no reply, \xe2\x80\x9cLady\r\nBlakeney is always so surrounded, so _f\xc3\xaated_ by her court, that a mere\r\nold friend has but very little chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, man!\xe2\x80\x9d she said impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must seek for another\r\nopportunity then. I am going to Lord Grenville\xe2\x80\x99s ball to-night after\r\nthe opera. So are you, probably. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you five minutes then. . .\r\n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree minutes in the privacy of this box are quite sufficient for me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe rejoined placidly, \xe2\x80\x9cand I think that you would be wise to listen to\r\nme, Citoyenne St. Just.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite instinctively shivered. Chauvelin had not raised his voice\r\nabove a whisper; he was now quietly taking a pinch of snuff, yet there\r\nwas something in his attitude, something in those pale, foxy eyes,\r\nwhich seemed to freeze the blood in her veins, as would the sight of\r\nsome deadly hitherto unguessed peril.\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cIs that a threat, citoyen?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, fair lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gallantly, \xe2\x80\x9conly an arrow shot into the air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, like a cat which sees a mouse running heedlessly\r\nby, ready to spring, yet waiting with that feline sense of enjoyment of\r\nmischief about to be done. Then he said quietly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour brother, St. Just, is in peril.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot a muscle moved in the beautiful face before him. He could only see\r\nit in profile, for Marguerite seemed to be watching the stage intently,\r\nbut Chauvelin was a keen observer; he noticed the sudden rigidity of\r\nthe eyes, the hardening of the mouth, the sharp, almost paralysed\r\ntension of the beautiful, graceful figure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLud, then,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with affected merriment, \xe2\x80\x9csince \xe2\x80\x99tis one of your\r\nimaginary plots, you\xe2\x80\x99d best go back to your own seat and leave me to\r\nenjoy the music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with her hand she began to beat time nervously against the cushion\r\nof the box. Selina Storace was singing the \xe2\x80\x9cChe far\xc3\xb2\xe2\x80\x9d to an audience\r\nthat hung spellbound upon the prima donna\xe2\x80\x99s lips. Chauvelin did not\r\nmove from his seat; he quietly watched that tiny nervous hand, the only\r\nindication that his shaft had indeed struck home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d she said suddenly and irrelevantly, and with the same feigned\r\nunconcern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, citoyenne?\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined placidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout my brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have news of him for you which, I think, will interest you, but\r\nfirst let me explain. . . . May I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question was unnecessary. He felt, though Marguerite still held her\r\nhead steadily averted from him, that her every nerve was strained to\r\nhear what he had to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other day, citoyenne,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI asked for your help. . . .\r\nFrance needed it, and I thought I could rely on you, but you gave me\r\nyour answer. . . . Since then the exigencies of my own affairs and your\r\nown social duties have kept us apart . . . although many things have\r\nhappened. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the point, I pray you, citoyen,\xe2\x80\x9d she said lightly; \xe2\x80\x9cthe music is\r\nentrancing, and the audience will get impatient of your talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment, citoyenne. The day on which I had the honour of meeting\r\nyou at Dover, and less than an hour after I had your final answer, I\r\nobtained possession of some papers, which revealed another of those\r\nsubtle schemes for the escape of a batch of French aristocrats\xe2\x80\x94that\r\ntraitor de Tournay amongst others\xe2\x80\x94all organised by that arch-meddler,\r\nthe Scarlet Pimpernel. Some of the threads, too, of this mysterious\r\norganisation have fallen into my hands, but not all, and I want\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94nay! you _must_ help me to gather them together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite seemed to have listened to him with marked impatience; she\r\nnow shrugged her shoulders and said gaily\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah! man. Have I not already told you that I care nought about your\r\nschemes or about the Scarlet Pimpernel. And had you not spoken about my\r\nbrother . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little patience, I entreat, citoyenne,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued imperturbably.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo gentlemen, Lord Antony Dewhurst and Sir Andrew Ffoulkes were at\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest\xe2\x80\x99 at Dover that same night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. I saw them there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were already known to my spies as members of that accursed\r\nleague. It was Sir Andrew Ffoulkes who escorted the Comtesse de Tournay\r\nand her children across the Channel. When the two young men were alone,\r\nmy spies forced their way into the coffee-room of the inn, gagged and\r\npinioned the two gallants, seized their papers, and brought them to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a moment she had guessed the danger. Papers? . . . Had Armand been\r\nimprudent? . . . The very thought struck her with nameless terror.\r\nStill she would not let this man see that she feared; she laughed gaily\r\nand lightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith! and your impudence passes belief,\xe2\x80\x9d she said merrily. \xe2\x80\x9cRobbery\r\nand violence!\xe2\x80\x94in England!\xe2\x80\x94in a crowded inn! Your men might have been\r\ncaught in the act!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if they had? They are children of France, and have been trained\r\nby your humble servant. Had they been caught they would have gone to\r\njail, or even to the gallows, without a word of protest or\r\nindiscretion; at any rate it was well worth the risk. A crowded inn is\r\nsafer for these little operations than you think, and my men have\r\nexperience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? And those papers?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked carelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, though they have given me cognisance of certain names .\r\n. . certain movements . . . enough, I think, to thwart their projected\r\n_coup_ for the moment, it would only be for the moment, and still\r\nleaves me in ignorance of the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa! my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with the same assumed flippancy of manner,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthen you are where you were before, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you? and you can let me\r\nenjoy the last strophe of the _aria_. Faith!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, ostentatiously\r\nsmothering an imaginary yawn, \xe2\x80\x9chad you not spoken about my brother . .\r\n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am coming to him now, citoyenne. Among the papers there was a letter\r\nto Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, written by your brother, St. Just.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? And?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat letter shows him to be not only in sympathy with the enemies of\r\nFrance, but actually a helper, if not a member, of the League of the\r\nScarlet Pimpernel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blow had been struck at last. All along, Marguerite had been\r\nexpecting it; she would not show fear, she was determined to seem\r\nunconcerned, flippant even. She wished, when the shock came, to be\r\nprepared for it, to have all her wits about her\xe2\x80\x94those wits which had\r\nbeen nicknamed the keenest in Europe. Even now she did not flinch. She\r\nknew that Chauvelin had spoken the truth; the man was too earnest, too\r\nblindly devoted to the misguided cause he had at heart, too proud of\r\nhis countrymen, of those makers of revolutions, to stoop to low,\r\npurposeless falsehoods.\r\n\r\nThat letter of Armand\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94foolish, imprudent Armand\xe2\x80\x94was in Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands. Marguerite knew that as if she had seen the letter with her own\r\neyes; and Chauvelin would hold that letter for purposes of his own,\r\nuntil it suited him to destroy it or to make use of it against Armand.\r\nAll that she knew, and yet she continued to laugh more gaily, more\r\nloudly than she had done before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa, man!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, speaking over her shoulder and looking him full\r\nand squarely in the face, \xe2\x80\x9cdid I not say it was some imaginary plot. .\r\n. . Armand in league with that enigmatic Scarlet Pimpernel! . . .\r\nArmand busy helping those French aristocrats whom he despises! . . .\r\nFaith, the tale does infinite credit to your imagination!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me make my point clear, citoyenne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin, with the same\r\nunruffled calm, \xe2\x80\x9cI must assure you that St. Just is compromised beyond\r\nthe slightest hope of pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInside the orchestra box all was silent for a moment or two. Marguerite\r\nsat, straight upright, rigid and inert, trying to think, trying to face\r\nthe situation, to realise what had best be done.\r\n\r\nIn the house Storace had finished the _aria_, and was even now bowing\r\nin her classic garb, but in approved eighteenth-century fashion, to the\r\nenthusiastic audience, who cheered her to the echo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChauvelin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite Blakeney at last, quietly, and without\r\nthat touch of bravado which had characterised her attitude all along,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChauvelin, my friend, shall we try to understand one another. It seems\r\nthat my wits have become rusty by contact with this damp climate. Now,\r\ntell me, you are very anxious to discover the identity of the Scarlet\r\nPimpernel, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrance\xe2\x80\x99s most bitter enemy, citoyenne . . . all the more dangerous, as\r\nhe works in the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the more noble, you mean. . . . Well!\xe2\x80\x94and you would now force me\r\nto do some spying work for you in exchange for my brother Armand\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsafety?\xe2\x80\x94Is that it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFie! two very ugly words, fair lady,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Chauvelin, urbanely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no question of force, and the service which I would ask\r\nof you, in the name of France, could never be called by the shocking\r\nname of spying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate, that is what it is called over here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said drily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is your intention, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy intention is, that you yourself win a free pardon for Armand St.\r\nJust by doing me a small service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly watch for me to-night, Citoyenne St. Just,\xe2\x80\x9d he said eagerly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen: among the papers which were found about the person of Sir\r\nAndrew Ffoulkes there was a tiny note. See!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, taking a tiny\r\nscrap of paper from his pocket-book and handing it to her.\r\n\r\nIt was the same scrap of paper which, four days ago, the two young men\r\nhad been in the act of reading, at the very moment when they were\r\nattacked by Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s minions. Marguerite took it mechanically and\r\nstooped to read it. There were only two lines, written in a distorted,\r\nevidently disguised, handwriting; she read them half aloud\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Remember we must not meet more often than is strictly necessary. You\r\nhave all instructions for the 2nd. If you wish to speak to me again, I\r\nshall be at G.\xe2\x80\x99s ball.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook again, citoyenne, and you will understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a device here in the corner, a small red flower . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Scarlet Pimpernel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cand G.\xe2\x80\x99s ball means\r\nGrenville\xe2\x80\x99s ball. . . . He will be at my Lord Grenville\xe2\x80\x99s ball\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is how I interpret the note, citoyenne,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Chauvelin,\r\nblandly. \xe2\x80\x9cLord Antony Dewhurst and Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, after they were\r\npinioned and searched by my spies, were carried by my orders to a\r\nlonely house on the Dover Road, which I had rented for the purpose:\r\nthere they remained close prisoners until this morning. But having\r\nfound this tiny scrap of paper, my intention was that they should be in\r\nLondon, in time to attend my Lord Grenville\xe2\x80\x99s ball. You see, do you\r\nnot? that they must have a great deal to say to their chief . . . and\r\nthus they will have an opportunity of speaking to him to-night, just as\r\nhe directed them to do. Therefore, this morning, those two young\r\ngallants found every bar and bolt open in that lonely house on the\r\nDover Road, their jailers disappeared, and two good horses standing\r\nready saddled and tethered in the yard. I have not seen them yet, but I\r\nthink we may safely conclude that they did not draw rein until they\r\nreached London. Now you see how simple it all is, citoyenne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does seem simple, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a final bitter\r\nattempt at flippancy, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you want to kill a chicken . . . you take\r\nhold of it . . . then you wring its neck . . . it\xe2\x80\x99s only the chicken\r\nwho does not find it quite so simple. Now you hold a knife at my\r\nthroat, and a hostage for my obedience. . . . You find it simple. . . .\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, citoyenne, I offer you a chance of saving the brother you love\r\nfrom the consequences of his own folly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite\xe2\x80\x99s face softened, her eyes at last grew moist, as she\r\nmurmured, half to herself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only being in the world who has loved me truly and constantly. . .\r\n. But what do you want me to do, Chauvelin?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a world of\r\ndespair in her tear-choked voice. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my present position, it is\r\nwell-nigh impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, citoyenne,\xe2\x80\x9d he said drily and relentlessly, not heeding that\r\ndespairing, childlike appeal, which might have melted a heart of stone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cas Lady Blakeney, no one suspects you, and with your help to-night I\r\nmay\xe2\x80\x94who knows?\xe2\x80\x94succeed in finally establishing the identity of the\r\nScarlet Pimpernel. . . . You are going to the ball anon. . . . Watch\r\nfor me there, citoyenne, watch and listen. . . . You can tell me if you\r\nhear a chance word or whisper. . . . You can note everyone to whom Sir\r\nAndrew Ffoulkes or Lord Antony Dewhurst will speak. You are absolutely\r\nbeyond suspicion now. The Scarlet Pimpernel will be at Lord Grenville\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nball to-night. Find out who he is, and I will pledge the word of France\r\nthat your brother shall be safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChauvelin was putting the knife to her throat. Marguerite felt herself\r\nentangled in one of those webs, from which she could hope for no\r\nescape. A precious hostage was being held for her obedience: for she\r\nknew that this man would never make an empty threat. No doubt Armand\r\nwas already signalled to the Committee of Public Safety as one of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csuspect\xe2\x80\x9d; he would not be allowed to leave France again, and would be\r\nruthlessly struck, if she refused to obey Chauvelin. For a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x94woman-like\xe2\x80\x94she still hoped to temporise. She held out her hand\r\nto this man, whom she now feared and hated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I promise to help you in this matter, Chauvelin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\npleasantly, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you give me that letter of St. Just\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you render me useful assistance to-night, citoyenne,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied\r\nwith a sarcastic smile, \xe2\x80\x9cI will give you that letter . . . to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not trust me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust you absolutely, dear lady, but St. Just\xe2\x80\x99s life is forfeit to\r\nhis country . . . it rests with you to redeem it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may be powerless to help you,\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded, \xe2\x80\x9cwere I ever so\r\nwilling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be terrible indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cfor you . . . and\r\nfor St. Just.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite shuddered. She felt that from this man she could expect no\r\nmercy. All-powerful, he held the beloved life in the hollow of his\r\nhand. She knew him too well not to know that, if he failed in gaining\r\nhis own ends, he would be pitiless.\r\n\r\nShe felt cold in spite of the oppressive air of the opera-house. The\r\nheart-appealing strains of the music seemed to reach her, as from a\r\ndistant land. She drew her costly lace scarf up around her shoulders,\r\nand sat silently watching the brilliant scene, as if in a dream.\r\n\r\nFor a moment her thoughts wandered away from the loved one who was in\r\ndanger, to that other man who also had a claim on her confidence and\r\nher affection. She felt lonely, frightened for Armand\xe2\x80\x99s sake; she\r\nlonged to seek comfort and advice from someone who would know how to\r\nhelp and console. Sir Percy Blakeney had loved her once; he was her\r\nhusband; why should she stand alone through this terrible ordeal? He\r\nhad very little brains, it is true, but he had plenty of muscle:\r\nsurely, if she provided the thought, and he the manly energy and pluck,\r\ntogether they could outwit the astute diplomatist, and save the hostage\r\nfrom his vengeful hands, without imperilling the life of the noble\r\nleader of that gallant little band of heroes. Sir Percy knew St. Just\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94he seemed attached to him\xe2\x80\x94she was sure that he could help.\r\n\r\nChauvelin was taking no further heed of her. He had said his cruel\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEither\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and left her to decide. He, in his turn now, appeared to\r\nbe absorbed in the soul-stirring melodies of _Orpheus_, and was beating\r\ntime to the music with his sharp, ferret-like head.\r\n\r\nA discreet rap at the door roused Marguerite from her thoughts. It was\r\nSir Percy Blakeney, tall, sleepy, good-humoured, and wearing that\r\nhalf-shy, half-inane smile, which just now seemed to irritate her every\r\nnerve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEr . . . your chair is outside . . . m\xe2\x80\x99dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with his most\r\nexasperating drawl, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you will want to go to that demmed ball.\r\n. . . Excuse me\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94Monsieur Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x94I had not observed you. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe extended two slender, white fingers towards Chauvelin, who had risen\r\nwhen Sir Percy entered the box.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you coming, m\xe2\x80\x99dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! Sh! Sh!\xe2\x80\x9d came in angry remonstrance from different parts of the\r\nhouse.\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cDemmed impudence,\xe2\x80\x9d commented Sir Percy with a good-natured smile.\r\n\r\nMarguerite sighed impatiently. Her last hope seemed suddenly to have\r\nvanished away. She wrapped her cloak round her and without looking at\r\nher husband:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ready to go,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, taking his arm. At the door of the box\r\nshe turned and looked straight at Chauvelin, who, with his\r\n_chapeau-bras_ under his arm, and a curious smile round his thin lips,\r\nwas preparing to follow the strangely ill-assorted couple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only _au revoir_, Chauvelin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said pleasantly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall\r\nmeet at my Lord Grenville\xe2\x80\x99s ball, anon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in her eyes the astute Frenchman read, no doubt, something which\r\ncaused him profound satisfaction, for, with a sarcastic smile, he took\r\na delicate pinch of snuff, then, having dusted his dainty lace jabot,\r\nhe rubbed his thin, bony hands contentedly together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nLORD GRENVILLE\xe2\x80\x99S BALL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe historic ball given by the then Secretary of State for Foreign\r\nAffairs\xe2\x80\x94Lord Grenville\xe2\x80\x94was the most brilliant function of the year.\r\nThough the autumn season had only just begun, everybody who was anybody\r\nhad contrived to be in London in time to be present there, and to shine\r\nat this ball, to the best of his or her respective ability.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Prince of Wales had promised to be present. He\r\nwas coming on presently from the opera. Lord Grenville himself had\r\nlistened to the two first acts of _Orpheus_, before preparing to\r\nreceive his guests. At ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94an unusually late hour in those\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x94the grand rooms of the Foreign Office, exquisitely decorated with\r\nexotic palms and flowers, were filled to overflowing. One room had been\r\nset apart for dancing, and the dainty strains of the minuet made a soft\r\naccompaniment to the gay chatter, the merry laughter of the numerous\r\nand brilliant company.\r\n\r\nIn a smaller chamber, facing the top of the fine stairway, the\r\ndistinguished host stood ready to receive his guests. Distinguished\r\nmen, beautiful women, notabilities from every European country had\r\nalready filed past him, had exchanged the elaborate bows and curtsies\r\nwith him, which the extravagant fashion of the time demanded, and then,\r\nlaughing and talking, had dispersed in the ball, reception, and card\r\nrooms beyond.\r\n\r\nNot far from Lord Grenville\xe2\x80\x99s elbow, leaning against one of the console\r\ntables, Chauvelin, in his irreproachable black costume, was taking a\r\nquiet survey of the brilliant throng. He noted that Sir Percy and Lady\r\nBlakeney had not yet arrived, and his keen, pale eyes glanced quickly\r\ntowards the door every time a newcomer appeared.\r\n\r\nHe stood somewhat isolated: the envoy of the Revolutionary Government\r\nof France was not likely to be very popular in England, at a time when\r\nthe news of the awful September massacres, and of the Reign of Terror\r\nand Anarchy, had just begun to filtrate across the Channel.\r\n\r\nIn his official capacity he had been received courteously by his\r\nEnglish colleagues: Mr. Pitt had shaken him by the hand; Lord Grenville\r\nhad entertained him more than once; but the more intimate circles of\r\nLondon society ignored him altogether; the women openly turned their\r\nbacks upon him; the men who held no official position refused to shake\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nBut Chauvelin was not the man to trouble himself about these social\r\namenities, which he called mere incidents in his diplomatic career. He\r\nwas blindly enthusiastic for the revolutionary cause, he despised all\r\nsocial inequalities, and he had a burning love for his own country:\r\nthese three sentiments made him supremely indifferent to the snubs he\r\nreceived in this fog-ridden, loyalist, old-fashioned England.\r\n\r\nBut, above all, Chauvelin had a purpose at heart. He firmly believed\r\nthat the French aristocrat was the most bitter enemy of France; he\r\nwould have wished to see every one of them annihilated: he was one of\r\nthose who, during this awful Reign of Terror, had been the first to\r\nutter the historic and ferocious desire \xe2\x80\x9cthat aristocrats might have\r\nbut one head between them, so that it might be cut off with a single\r\nstroke of the guillotine.\xe2\x80\x9d And thus he looked upon every French\r\naristocrat, who had succeeded in escaping from France, as so much prey\r\nof which the guillotine had been unwarrantably cheated. There is no\r\ndoubt that those royalist _\xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s_, once they had managed to cross the\r\nfrontier, did their very best to stir up foreign indignation against\r\nFrance. Plots without end were hatched in England, in Belgium, in\r\nHolland, to try and induce some great power to send troops into\r\nrevolutionary Paris, to free King Louis, and to summarily hang the\r\nbloodthirsty leaders of that monster republic.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder, therefore, that the romantic and mysterious personality\r\nof the Scarlet Pimpernel was a source of bitter hatred to Chauvelin. He\r\nand the few young jackanapes under his command, well furnished with\r\nmoney, armed with boundless daring, and acute cunning, had succeeded in\r\nrescuing hundreds of aristocrats from France. Nine-tenths of the\r\n_\xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s_, who were _f\xc3\xaated_ at the English court, owed their safety to\r\nthat man and to his league.\r\n\r\nChauvelin had sworn to his colleagues in Paris that he would discover\r\nthe identity of that meddlesome Englishman, entice him over to France,\r\nand then . . . Chauvelin drew a deep breath of satisfaction at the very\r\nthought of seeing that enigmatic head falling under the knife of the\r\nguillotine, as easily as that of any other man.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a great stir on the handsome staircase, all\r\nconversation stopped for a moment as the major-domo\xe2\x80\x99s voice outside\r\nannounced,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and suite, Sir Percy Blakeney,\r\nLady Blakeney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord Grenville went quickly to the door to receive his exalted guest.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, dressed in a magnificent court suit of\r\nsalmon-coloured velvet richly embroidered with gold, entered with\r\nMarguerite Blakeney on his arm; and on his left Sir Percy, in gorgeous\r\nshimmering cream satin, cut in the extravagant \xe2\x80\x9cIncroyable\xe2\x80\x9d style, his\r\nfair hair free from powder, priceless lace at his neck and wrists, and\r\nthe flat _chapeau-bras_ under his arm.\r\n\r\nAfter the few conventional words of deferential greeting, Lord\r\nGrenville said to his royal guest,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill your Highness permit me to introduce M. Chauvelin, the accredited\r\nagent of the French Government?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChauvelin, immediately the Prince entered, had stepped forward,\r\nexpecting this introduction. He bowed very low, whilst the Prince\r\nreturned his salute with a curt nod of the head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d said His Royal Highness coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will try to forget the\r\ngovernment that sent you, and look upon you merely as our guest\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nprivate gentleman from France. As such you are welcome, Monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Chauvelin, bowing once again. \xe2\x80\x9cMadame,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, bowing ceremoniously before Marguerite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my little Chauvelin!\xe2\x80\x9d she said with unconcerned gaiety, and\r\nextending her tiny hand to him. \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur and I are old friends, your\r\nRoyal Highness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, this time very graciously, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are doubly\r\nwelcome, Monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is someone else I would crave permission to present to your\r\nRoyal Highness,\xe2\x80\x9d here interposed Lord Grenville.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! who is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Prince.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame la Comtesse de Tournay de Basserive and her family, who have\r\nbut recently come from France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means!\xe2\x80\x94They are among the lucky ones then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord Grenville turned in search of the Comtesse, who sat at the further\r\nend of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLud love me!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered His Royal Highness to Marguerite, as soon as\r\nhe had caught sight of the rigid figure of the old lady; \xe2\x80\x9cLud love me!\r\nshe looks very virtuous and very melancholy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, your Royal Highness,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cvirtue is\r\nlike precious odours, most fragrant when it is crushed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVirtue, alas!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed the Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cis mostly unbecoming to your\r\ncharming sex, Madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame la Comtesse de Tournay de Basserive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Grenville,\r\nintroducing the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a pleasure, Madame; my royal father, as you know, is ever glad\r\nto welcome those of your compatriots whom France has driven from her\r\nshores.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Royal Highness is ever gracious,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Comtesse with\r\nbecoming dignity. Then, indicating her daughter, who stood timidly by\r\nher side: \xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter Suzanne, Monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! charming!\xe2\x80\x94charming!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cand now allow me, Comtesse,\r\nto introduce to you, Lady Blakeney, who honours us with her friendship.\r\nYou and she will have much to say to one another, I vow. Every\r\ncompatriot of Lady Blakeney\xe2\x80\x99s is doubly welcome for her sake . . . her\r\nfriends are our friends . . . her enemies, the enemies of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite\xe2\x80\x99s blue eyes had twinkled with merriment at this gracious\r\nspeech from her exalted friend. The Comtesse de Tournay, who lately had\r\nso flagrantly insulted her, was here receiving a public lesson, at\r\nwhich Marguerite could not help but rejoice. But the Comtesse, for whom\r\nrespect of royalty amounted almost to a religion, was too well-schooled\r\nin courtly etiquette to show the slightest sign of embarrassment, as\r\nthe two ladies curtsied ceremoniously to one another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Royal Highness is ever gracious, Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite,\r\ndemurely, and with a wealth of mischief in her twinkling blue eyes,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut here there is no need for his kind mediation. . . . Your amiable\r\nreception of me at our last meeting still dwells pleasantly in my\r\nmemory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe poor exiles, Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the Comtesse, frigidly, \xe2\x80\x9cshow our\r\ngratitude to England by devotion to the wishes of Monseigneur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite, with another ceremonious curtsey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame,\xe2\x80\x9d responded the Comtesse with equal dignity.\r\n\r\nThe Prince in the meanwhile was saying a few gracious words to the\r\nyoung Vicomte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am happy to know you, Monsieur le Vicomte,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew your\r\nfather well when he was ambassador in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Monseigneur!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Vicomte, \xe2\x80\x9cI was a leetle boy then . . .\r\nand now I owe the honour of this meeting to our protector, the Scarlet\r\nPimpernel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, earnestly and quickly, as he indicated\r\nChauvelin, who had stood a little on one side throughout the whole of\r\nthis little scene, watching Marguerite and the Comtesse with an amused,\r\nsarcastic little smile around his thin lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d he said now, as if in direct response to the\r\nPrince\xe2\x80\x99s challenge, \xe2\x80\x9cpray do not check this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s display of\r\ngratitude; the name of that interesting red flower is well known to\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94and to France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince looked at him keenly for a moment or two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, then, Monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps you know more about our\r\nnational hero than we do ourselves . . . perchance you know who he is.\r\n. . . See!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to the groups round the room, \xe2\x80\x9cthe ladies\r\nhang upon your lips . . . you would render yourself popular among the\r\nfair sex if you were to gratify their curiosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin, significantly, \xe2\x80\x9crumour has it in\r\nFrance that your Highness could\xe2\x80\x94an you would\xe2\x80\x94give the truest account of\r\nthat enigmatical wayside flower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked quickly and keenly at Marguerite as he spoke; but she\r\nbetrayed no emotion, and her eyes met his quite fearlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, man,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cmy lips are sealed! and the members of\r\nthe league jealously guard the secret of their chief . . . so his fair\r\nadorers have to be content with worshipping a shadow. Here in England,\r\nMonsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with wonderful charm and dignity, \xe2\x80\x9cwe but name the\r\nScarlet Pimpernel, and every fair cheek is suffused with a blush of\r\nenthusiasm. None have seen him save his faithful lieutenants. We know\r\nnot if he be tall or short, fair or dark, handsome or ill-formed; but\r\nwe know that he is the bravest gentleman in all the world, and we all\r\nfeel a little proud, Monsieur, when we remember that he is an\r\nEnglishman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Monsieur Chauvelin,\xe2\x80\x9d added Marguerite, looking almost with\r\ndefiance across at the placid, sphinx-like face of the Frenchman, \xe2\x80\x9cHis\r\nRoyal Highness should add that we ladies think of him as of a hero of\r\nold . . . we worship him . . . we wear his badge . . . we tremble for\r\nhim when he is in danger, and exult with him in the hour of his\r\nvictory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChauvelin did no more than bow placidly both to the Prince and to\r\nMarguerite; he felt that both speeches were intended\xe2\x80\x94each in their\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94to convey contempt or defiance. The pleasure-loving, idle Prince he\r\ndespised; the beautiful woman, who in her golden hair wore a spray of\r\nsmall red flowers composed of rubies and diamonds\xe2\x80\x94her he held in the\r\nhollow of his hand: he could afford to remain silent and to await\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nA long, jovial, inane laugh broke the sudden silence which had fallen\r\nover everyone.\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we poor husbands,\xe2\x80\x9d came in slow, affected accents from gorgeous\r\n Sir Percy, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have to stand by . . . while they worship a demmed\r\n shadow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEveryone laughed\xe2\x80\x94the Prince more loudly than anyone. The tension of\r\nsubdued excitement was relieved, and the next moment everyone was\r\nlaughing and chatting merrily as the gay crowd broke up and dispersed\r\nin the adjoining rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nTHE SCRAP OF PAPER\r\n\r\n\r\nMarguerite suffered intensely. Though she laughed and chatted, though\r\nshe was more admired, more surrounded, more _f\xc3\xaated_ than any woman\r\nthere, she felt like one condemned to death, living her last day upon\r\nthis earth.\r\n\r\nHer nerves were in a state of painful tension, which had increased a\r\nhundredfold during that brief hour which she had spent in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany, between the opera and the ball. The short ray of hope\xe2\x80\x94that she\r\nmight find in this good-natured, lazy individual a valuable friend and\r\nadviser\xe2\x80\x94had vanished as quickly as it had come, the moment she found\r\nherself alone with him. The same feeling of good-humoured contempt\r\nwhich one feels for an animal or a faithful servant, made her turn away\r\nwith a smile from the man who should have been her moral support in\r\nthis heart-rending crisis through which she was passing: who should\r\nhave been her cool-headed adviser, when feminine sympathy and sentiment\r\ntossed her hither and thither, between her love for her brother, who\r\nwas far away and in mortal peril, and horror of the awful service which\r\nChauvelin had exacted from her, in exchange for Armand\xe2\x80\x99s safety.\r\n\r\nThere he stood, the moral support, the cool-headed adviser, surrounded\r\nby a crowd of brainless, empty-headed young fops, who were even now\r\nrepeating from mouth to mouth, and with every sign of the keenest\r\nenjoyment, a doggerel quatrain which he had just given forth.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the absurd, silly words met her: people seemed to have\r\nlittle else to speak about, even the Prince had asked her, with a\r\nlaugh, whether she appreciated her husband\xe2\x80\x99s latest poetic efforts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll done in the tying of a cravat,\xe2\x80\x9d Sir Percy had declared to his\r\nclique of admirers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe seek him here, we seek him there,\r\nThose Frenchies seek him everywhere.\r\nIs he in heaven?\xe2\x80\x94Is he in hell?\r\nThat demmed, elusive Pimpernel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Percy\xe2\x80\x99s _bon mot_ had gone the round of the brilliant\r\nreception-rooms. The Prince was enchanted. He vowed that life without\r\nBlakeney would be but a dreary desert. Then, taking him by the arm, had\r\nled him to the card-room, and engaged him in a long game of hazard.\r\n\r\nSir Percy, whose chief interest in most social gatherings seemed to\r\ncentre round the card-table, usually allowed his wife to flirt, dance,\r\nto amuse or bore herself as much as she liked. And to-night, having\r\ndelivered himself of his _bon mot_, he had left Marguerite surrounded\r\nby a crowd of admirers of all ages, all anxious and willing to help her\r\nto forget that somewhere in the spacious reception-rooms, there was a\r\nlong, lazy being who had been fool enough to suppose that the cleverest\r\nwoman in Europe would settle down to the prosaic bonds of English\r\nmatrimony.\r\n\r\nHer still overwrought nerves, her excitement and agitation, lent\r\nbeautiful Marguerite Blakeney much additional charm: escorted by a\r\nveritable bevy of men of all ages and of most nationalities, she called\r\nforth many exclamations of admiration from everyone as she passed.\r\n\r\nShe would not allow herself any more time to think. Her early, somewhat\r\nBohemian training had made her something of a fatalist. She felt that\r\nevents would shape themselves, that the directing of them was not in\r\nher hands. From Chauvelin she knew that she could expect no mercy. He\r\nhad set a price upon Armand\xe2\x80\x99s head, and left it to her to pay or not,\r\nas she chose.\r\n\r\nLater on in the evening she caught sight of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and\r\nLord Antony Dewhurst, who seemingly had just arrived. She noticed at\r\nonce that Sir Andrew immediately made for little Suzanne de Tournay,\r\nand that the two young people soon managed to isolate themselves in one\r\nof the deep embrasures of the mullioned windows, there to carry on a\r\nlong conversation, which seemed very earnest and very pleasant on both\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nBoth the young men looked a little haggard and anxious, but otherwise\r\nthey were irreproachably dressed, and there was not the slightest sign,\r\nabout their courtly demeanour, of the terrible catastrophe, which they\r\nmust have felt hovering round them and round their chief.\r\n\r\nThat the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel had no intention of abandoning\r\nits cause, she had gathered through little Suzanne herself, who spoke\r\nopenly of the assurance she and her mother had had that the Comte de\r\nTournay would be rescued from France by the league, within the next few\r\ndays. Vaguely she began to wonder, as she looked at the brilliant and\r\nfashionable crowd in the gaily-lighted ball-room, which of these\r\nworldly men round her was the mysterious \xe2\x80\x9cScarlet Pimpernel,\xe2\x80\x9d who held\r\nthe threads of such daring plots, and the fate of valuable lives in his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nA burning curiosity seized her to know him: although for months she had\r\nheard of him and had accepted his anonymity, as everyone else in\r\nsociety had done; but now she longed to know\xe2\x80\x94quite impersonally, quite\r\napart from Armand, and oh! quite apart from Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x94only for her own\r\nsake, for the sake of the enthusiastic admiration she had always\r\nbestowed on his bravery and cunning.\r\n\r\nHe was at the ball, of course, somewhere, since Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and\r\nLord Antony Dewhurst were here, evidently expecting to meet their\r\nchief\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps to get a fresh _mot d\xe2\x80\x99ordre_ from him.\r\n\r\nMarguerite looked round at everyone, at the aristocratic high-typed\r\nNorman faces, the squarely-built, fair-haired Saxon, the more gentle,\r\nhumorous caste of the Celt, wondering which of these betrayed the\r\npower, the energy, the cunning which had imposed its will and its\r\nleadership upon a number of high-born English gentlemen, among whom\r\nrumour asserted was His Royal Highness himself.\r\n\r\nSir Andrew Ffoulkes? Surely not, with his gentle blue eyes, which were\r\nlooking so tenderly and longingly after little Suzanne, who was being\r\nled away from the pleasant _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ by her stern mother.\r\nMarguerite watched him across the room, as he finally turned away with\r\na sigh, and seemed to stand, aimless and lonely, now that Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndainty little figure had disappeared in the crowd.\r\n\r\nShe watched him as he strolled towards the doorway, which led to a\r\nsmall boudoir beyond, then paused and leaned against the framework of\r\nit, looking still anxiously all round him.\r\n\r\nMarguerite contrived for the moment to evade her present attentive\r\ncavalier, and she skirted the fashionable crowd, drawing nearer to the\r\ndoorway, against which Sir Andrew was leaning. Why she wished to get\r\ncloser to him, she could not have said: perhaps she was impelled by an\r\nall-powerful fatality, which so often seems to rule the destinies of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she stopped: her very heart seemed to stand still, her eyes,\r\nlarge and excited, flashed for a moment towards that doorway, then as\r\nquickly were turned away again. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes was still in the\r\nsame listless position by the door, but Marguerite had distinctly seen\r\nthat Lord Hastings\xe2\x80\x94a young buck, a friend of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s and one of\r\nthe Prince\xe2\x80\x99s set\xe2\x80\x94had, as he quickly brushed past him, slipped something\r\ninto his hand.\r\n\r\nFor one moment longer\xe2\x80\x94oh! it was the merest flash\xe2\x80\x94Marguerite paused:\r\nthe next she had, with admirably played unconcern, resumed her walk\r\nacross the room\xe2\x80\x94but this time more quickly towards that doorway whence\r\nSir Andrew had now disappeared.\r\n\r\nAll this, from the moment that Marguerite had caught sight of Sir\r\nAndrew leaning against the doorway, until she followed him into the\r\nlittle boudoir beyond, had occurred in less than a minute. Fate is\r\nusually swift when she deals a blow.\r\n\r\nNow Lady Blakeney had suddenly ceased to exist. It was Marguerite St.\r\nJust who was there only: Marguerite St. Just who had passed her\r\nchildhood, her early youth, in the protecting arms of her brother\r\nArmand. She had forgotten everything else\xe2\x80\x94her rank, her dignity, her\r\nsecret enthusiasms\xe2\x80\x94everything save that Armand stood in peril of his\r\nlife, and that there, not twenty feet away from her, in the small\r\nboudoir which was quite deserted, in the very hands of Sir Andrew\r\nFfoulkes, might be the talisman which would save her brother\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\nBarely another thirty seconds had elapsed between the moment when Lord\r\nHastings slipped the mysterious \xe2\x80\x9csomething\xe2\x80\x9d into Sir Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and\r\nthe one when she, in her turn, reached the deserted boudoir. Sir Andrew\r\nwas standing with his back to her and close to a table upon which stood\r\na massive silver candelabra. A slip of paper was in his hand, and he\r\nwas in the very act of perusing its contents.\r\n\r\nUnperceived, her soft clinging robe making not the slightest sound upon\r\nthe heavy carpet, not daring to breathe until she had accomplished her\r\npurpose, Marguerite slipped close behind him. . . . At that moment he\r\nlooked round and saw her; she uttered a groan, passed her hand across\r\nher forehead, and murmured faintly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe heat in the room was terrible . . . I felt so faint. . . . Ah! . .\r\n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tottered almost as if she would fall, and Sir Andrew, quickly\r\nrecovering himself, and crumpling in his hand the tiny note he had been\r\nreading, was only, apparently, just in time to support her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are ill, Lady Blakeney?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with much concern. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me . .\r\n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, nothing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cA chair\xe2\x80\x94quick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sank into a chair close to the table, and throwing back her head,\r\nclosed her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, still faintly; \xe2\x80\x9cthe giddiness is passing off. .\r\n. . Do not heed me, Sir Andrew; I assure you I already feel better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt moments like these there is no doubt\xe2\x80\x94and psychologists actually\r\nassert it\xe2\x80\x94that there is in us a sense which has absolutely nothing to\r\ndo with the other five: it is not that we see, it is not that we hear\r\nor touch, yet we seem to do all three at once. Marguerite sat there\r\nwith her eyes apparently closed. Sir Andrew was immediately behind her,\r\nand on her right was the table with the five-armed candelabra upon it.\r\nBefore her mental vision there was absolutely nothing but Armand\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface. Armand, whose life was in the most imminent danger, and who\r\nseemed to be looking at her from a background upon which were dimly\r\npainted the seething crowd of Paris, the bare walls of the Tribunal of\r\nPublic Safety, with Foucquier-Tinville, the Public Prosecutor,\r\ndemanding Armand\xe2\x80\x99s life in the name of the people of France, and the\r\nlurid guillotine with its stained knife waiting for another victim . .\r\n. Armand! . . .\r\n\r\nFor one moment there was dead silence in the little boudoir. Beyond,\r\nfrom the brilliant ball-room, the sweet notes of the gavotte, the\r\nfrou-frou of rich dresses, the talk and laughter of a large and merry\r\ncrowd, came as a strange, weird accompaniment to the drama which was\r\nbeing enacted here.\r\n\r\n Sir Andrew had not uttered another word. Then it was that that extra\r\n sense became potent in Marguerite Blakeney. She could not see, for her\r\n eyes were closed; she could not hear, for the noise from the ball-room\r\n drowned the soft rustle of that momentous scrap of paper; nevertheless\r\n she knew\xe2\x80\x94as if she had both seen and heard\xe2\x80\x94that Sir Andrew was even\r\n now holding the paper to the flame of one of the candles.\r\n\r\nAt the exact moment that it began to catch fire, she opened her eyes,\r\nraised her hand and, with two dainty fingers, had taken the burning\r\nscrap of paper from the young man\xe2\x80\x99s hand. Then she blew out the flame,\r\nand held the paper to her nostril with perfect unconcern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow thoughtful of you, Sir Andrew,\xe2\x80\x9d she said gaily, \xe2\x80\x9csurely \xe2\x80\x99twas your\r\ngrandmother who taught you that the smell of burnt paper was a\r\nsovereign remedy against giddiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sighed with satisfaction, holding the paper tightly between her\r\njewelled fingers; that talisman which perhaps would save her brother\r\nArmand\xe2\x80\x99s life. Sir Andrew was staring at her, too dazed for the moment\r\nto realise what had actually happened; he had been taken so completely\r\nby surprise, that he seemed quite unable to grasp the fact that the\r\nslip of paper, which she held in her dainty hand, was one perhaps on\r\nwhich the life of his comrade might depend.\r\n\r\nMarguerite burst into a long, merry peal of laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you stare at me like that?\xe2\x80\x9d she said playfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI assure you I\r\nfeel much better; your remedy has proved most effectual. This room is\r\nmost delightfully cool,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with the same perfect composure,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand the sound of the gavotte from the ball-room is fascinating and\r\nsoothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was prattling on in the most unconcerned and pleasant way, whilst\r\nSir Andrew, in an agony of mind, was racking his brains as to the\r\nquickest method he could employ to get that bit of paper out of that\r\nbeautiful woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand. Instinctively, vague and tumultuous thoughts\r\nrushed through his mind: he suddenly remembered her nationality, and\r\nworst of all, recollected that horrible tale anent the Marquis de St.\r\nCyr, which in England no one had credited, for the sake of Sir Percy,\r\nas well as for her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Still dreaming and staring?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a merry laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nare most ungallant, Sir Andrew; and now I come to think of it, you\r\nseemed more startled than pleased when you saw me just now. I do\r\nbelieve, after all, that it was not concern for my health, nor yet a\r\nremedy taught you by your grandmother that caused you to burn this tiny\r\nscrap of paper. . . . I vow it must have been your lady love\xe2\x80\x99s last\r\ncruel epistle you were trying to destroy. Now confess!\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\nplayfully holding up the scrap of paper, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes this contain her final\r\n_cong\xc3\xa9_, or a last appeal to kiss and make friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhichever it is, Lady Blakeney,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Andrew, who was gradually\r\nrecovering his self-possession, \xe2\x80\x9cthis little note is undoubtedly mine,\r\nand . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Not caring whether his action was one that would be styled ill-bred\r\n towards a lady, the young man had made a bold dash for the note; but\r\n Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts flew quicker than his own; her actions, under\r\n pressure of this intense excitement, were swifter and more sure. She\r\n was tall and strong; she took a quick step backwards and knocked over\r\n the small Sheraton table which was already top-heavy, and which fell\r\n down with a crash, together with the massive candelabra upon it.\r\n\r\nShe gave a quick cry of alarm:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe candles, Sir Andrew\xe2\x80\x94quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was not much damage done; one or two of the candles had blown out\r\nas the candelabra fell; others had merely sent some grease upon the\r\nvaluable carpet; one had ignited the paper shade over it. Sir Andrew\r\nquickly and dexterously put out the flames and replaced the candelabra\r\nupon the table; but this had taken him a few seconds to do, and those\r\nseconds had been all that Marguerite needed to cast a quick glance at\r\nthe paper, and to note its contents\xe2\x80\x94a dozen words in the same distorted\r\nhandwriting she had seen before, and bearing the same device\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nstar-shaped flower drawn in red ink.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Andrew once more looked at her, he only saw on her face alarm\r\nat the untoward accident and relief at its happy issue; whilst the tiny\r\nand momentous note had apparently fluttered to the ground. Eagerly the\r\nyoung man picked it up, and his face looked much relieved, as his\r\nfingers closed tightly over it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame, Sir Andrew,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, shaking her head with a playful\r\nsigh, \xe2\x80\x9cmaking havoc in the heart of some impressionable duchess, whilst\r\nconquering the affections of my sweet little Suzanne. Well, well! I do\r\nbelieve it was Cupid himself who stood by you, and threatened the\r\nentire Foreign Office with destruction by fire, just on purpose to make\r\nme drop love\xe2\x80\x99s message, before it had been polluted by my indiscreet\r\neyes. To think that, a moment longer, and I might have known the\r\nsecrets of an erring duchess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will forgive me, Lady Blakeney,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Andrew, now as calm as\r\nshe was herself, \xe2\x80\x9cif I resume the interesting occupation which you had\r\ninterrupted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means, Sir Andrew! How should I venture to thwart the love-god\r\nagain? Perhaps he would mete out some terrible chastisement against my\r\npresumption. Burn your love-token, by all means!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Andrew had already twisted the paper into a long spill, and was\r\nonce again holding it to the flame of the candle, which had remained\r\nalight. He did not notice the strange smile on the face of his fair\r\n_vis-\xc3\xa0-vis_, so intent was he on the work of destruction; perhaps, had\r\nhe done so, the look of relief would have faded from his face. He\r\nwatched the fateful note, as it curled under the flame. Soon the last\r\nfragment fell on the floor, and he placed his heel upon the ashes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Sir Andrew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite Blakeney, with the pretty\r\nnonchalance peculiar to herself, and with the most winning of smiles,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwill you venture to excite the jealousy of your fair lady by asking me\r\nto dance the minuet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nEITHER\xe2\x80\x94OR?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe few words which Marguerite Blakeney had managed to read on the\r\nhalf-scorched piece of paper, seemed literally to be the words of Fate.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStart myself to-morrow. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d This she had read quite distinctly;\r\nthen came a blur caused by the smoke of the candle, which obliterated\r\nthe next few words; but, right at the bottom, there was another\r\nsentence, which was now standing clearly and distinctly, like letters\r\nof fire, before her mental vision. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish to speak to me again, I\r\nshall be in the supper-room at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock precisely.\xe2\x80\x9d The whole was\r\nsigned with the hastily-scrawled little device\xe2\x80\x94a tiny star-shaped\r\nflower, which had become so familiar to her.\r\n\r\nOne o\xe2\x80\x99clock precisely! It was now close upon eleven, the last minuet\r\nwas being danced, with Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and beautiful Lady Blakeney\r\nleading the couples, through its delicate and intricate figures.\r\n\r\nClose upon eleven! the hands of the handsome Louis XV. clock upon its\r\normolu bracket seemed to move along with maddening rapidity. Two hours\r\nmore, and her fate and that of Armand would be sealed. In two hours she\r\nmust make up her mind whether she will keep the knowledge so cunningly\r\ngained to herself, and leave her brother to his fate, or whether she\r\nwill wilfully betray a brave man, whose life was devoted to his\r\nfellow-men, who was noble, generous, and above all, unsuspecting. It\r\nseemed a horrible thing to do. But then, there was Armand! Armand, too,\r\nwas noble and brave, Armand, too, was unsuspecting. And Armand loved\r\nher, would have willingly trusted his life in her hands, and now, when\r\nshe could save him from death, she hesitated. Oh! it was monstrous; her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s kind, gentle face, so full of love for her, seemed to be\r\nlooking reproachfully at her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might have saved me, Margot!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nseemed to say to her, \xe2\x80\x9cand you chose the life of a stranger, a man you\r\ndo not know, whom you have never seen, and preferred that he should be\r\nsafe, whilst you sent me to the guillotine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll these conflicting thoughts raged through Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s brain, while,\r\nwith a smile upon her lips, she glided through the graceful mazes of\r\nthe minuet. She noted\xe2\x80\x94with that acute sense of hers\xe2\x80\x94that she had\r\nsucceeded in completely allaying Sir Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s fears. Her self-control\r\nhad been absolutely perfect\xe2\x80\x94she was a finer actress at this moment, and\r\nthroughout the whole of this minuet, than she had ever been upon the\r\nboards of the Com\xc3\xa9die Fran\xc3\xa7aise; but then, a beloved brother\xe2\x80\x99s life had\r\nnot depended upon her histrionic powers.\r\n\r\nShe was too clever to overdo her part, and made no further allusions to\r\nthe supposed _billet doux_, which had caused Sir Andrew Ffoulkes such\r\nan agonising five minutes. She watched his anxiety melting away under\r\nher sunny smile, and soon perceived that, whatever doubt may have\r\ncrossed his mind at the moment, she had, by the time the last bars of\r\nthe minuet had been played, succeeded in completely dispelling it; he\r\nnever realised in what a fever of excitement she was, what effort it\r\ncost her to keep up a constant ripple of _banal_ conversation.\r\n\r\nWhen the minuet was over, she asked Sir Andrew to take her into the\r\nnext room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have promised to go down to supper with His Royal Highness,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cbut before we part, tell me . . . am I forgiven?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgiven?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! Confess, I gave you a fright just now. . . . But, remember, I am\r\nnot an Englishwoman, and I do not look upon the exchanging of _billet\r\ndoux_ as a crime, and I vow I\xe2\x80\x99ll not tell my little Suzanne. But now,\r\ntell me, shall I welcome you at my water-party on Wednesday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure, Lady Blakeney,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied evasively. \xe2\x80\x9cI may have to\r\nleave London to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not do that, if I were you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said earnestly; then seeing\r\nthe anxious look once more reappearing in his eyes, she added gaily;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one can throw a ball better than you can, Sir Andrew, we should so\r\nmiss you on the bowling-green.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had led her across the room, to one beyond, where already His Royal\r\nHighness was waiting for the beautiful Lady Blakeney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame, supper awaits us,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, offering his arm to\r\nMarguerite, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am full of hope. The goddess Fortune has frowned so\r\npersistently on me at hazard, that I look with confidence for the\r\nsmiles of the goddess of Beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Highness has been unfortunate at the card tables?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMarguerite, as she took the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye! most unfortunate. Blakeney, not content with being the richest\r\namong my father\xe2\x80\x99s subjects, has also the most outrageous luck. By the\r\nway, where is that inimitable wit? I vow, Madam, that this life would\r\nbe but a dreary desert without your smiles and his sallies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nONE O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK PRECISELY!\r\n\r\n\r\nSupper had been extremely gay. All those present declared that never\r\nhad Lady Blakeney been more adorable, nor that \xe2\x80\x9cdemmed idiot\xe2\x80\x9d Sir Percy\r\nmore amusing.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness had laughed until the tears streamed down his cheeks\r\nat Blakeney\xe2\x80\x99s foolish yet funny repartees. His doggerel verse, \xe2\x80\x9cWe seek\r\nhim here, we seek him there,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., was sung to the tune of \xe2\x80\x9cHo! Merry\r\nBritons!\xe2\x80\x9d and to the accompaniment of glasses knocked loudly against\r\nthe table. Lord Grenville, moreover, had a most perfect cook\xe2\x80\x94some wags\r\nasserted that he was a scion of the old French _noblesse_, who, having\r\nlost his fortune, had come to seek it in the _cuisine_ of the Foreign\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nMarguerite Blakeney was in her most brilliant mood, and surely not a\r\nsoul in that crowded supper-room had even an inkling of the terrible\r\nstruggle which was raging within her heart.\r\n\r\nThe clock was ticking so mercilessly on. It was long past midnight, and\r\neven the Prince of Wales was thinking of leaving the supper-table.\r\nWithin the next half-hour the destinies of two brave men would be\r\npitted against one another\xe2\x80\x94the dearly-beloved brother and he, the\r\nunknown hero.\r\n\r\nMarguerite had not even tried to see Chauvelin during this last hour;\r\nshe knew that his keen, fox-like eyes would terrify her at once, and\r\nincline the balance of her decision towards Armand. Whilst she did not\r\nsee him, there still lingered in her heart of hearts a vague, undefined\r\nhope that \xe2\x80\x9csomething\xe2\x80\x9d would occur, something big, enormous,\r\nepoch-making, which would shift from her young, weak shoulders this\r\nterrible burden of responsibility, of having to choose between two such\r\ncruel alternatives.\r\n\r\nBut the minutes ticked on with that dull monotony which they invariably\r\nseem to assume when our very nerves ache with their incessant ticking.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, dancing was resumed. His Royal Highness had left, and\r\nthere was general talk of departing among the older guests; the young\r\nones were indefatigable and had started on a new gavotte, which would\r\nfill the next quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nMarguerite did not feel equal to another dance; there is a limit to the\r\nmost enduring self-control. Escorted by a Cabinet Minister, she had\r\nonce more found her way to the tiny boudoir, still the most deserted\r\namong all the rooms. She knew that Chauvelin must be lying in wait for\r\nher somewhere, ready to seize the first possible opportunity for a\r\n_t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_. His eyes had met hers for a moment after the\r\n\xe2\x80\x99fore-supper minuet, and she knew that the keen diplomatist, with those\r\nsearching pale eyes of his, had divined that her work was accomplished.\r\n\r\nFate had willed it so. Marguerite, torn by the most terrible conflict\r\nheart of woman can ever know, had resigned herself to its decrees. But\r\nArmand must be saved at any cost; he, first of all, for he was her\r\nbrother, had been mother, father, friend to her ever since she, a tiny\r\nbabe, had lost both her parents. To think of Armand dying a traitor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath on the guillotine was too horrible even to dwell upon\xe2\x80\x94impossible,\r\nin fact. That could never be, never. . . . As for the stranger, the\r\nhero . . . well! there, let Fate decide. Marguerite would redeem her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s life at the hands of the relentless enemy, then let that\r\ncunning Scarlet Pimpernel extricate himself after that.\r\n\r\nPerhaps\xe2\x80\x94vaguely\xe2\x80\x94Marguerite hoped that the daring plotter, who for so\r\nmany months had baffled an army of spies, would still manage to evade\r\nChauvelin and remain immune to the end.\r\n\r\nShe thought of all this, as she sat listening to the witty discourse of\r\nthe Cabinet Minister, who, no doubt, felt that he had found in Lady\r\nBlakeney a most perfect listener. Suddenly she saw the keen, fox-like\r\nface of Chauvelin peeping through the curtained doorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord Fancourt,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the Minister, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you do me a service?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am entirely at your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s service,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied gallantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you see if my husband is still in the card-room? And if he is,\r\nwill you tell him that I am very tired, and would be glad to go home\r\nsoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe commands of a beautiful woman are binding on all mankind, even on\r\nCabinet Ministers. Lord Fancourt prepared to obey instantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not like to leave your ladyship alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever fear. I shall be quite safe here\xe2\x80\x94and, I think, undisturbed . . .\r\nbut I am really tired. You know Sir Percy will drive back to Richmond.\r\nIt is a long way, and we shall not\xe2\x80\x94an we do not hurry\xe2\x80\x94get home before\r\ndaybreak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord Fancourt had perforce to go.\r\n\r\nThe moment he had disappeared, Chauvelin slipped into the room, and the\r\nnext instant stood calm and impassive by her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have news for me?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nAn icy mantle seemed to have suddenly settled round Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulders; though her cheeks glowed with fire, she felt chilled and\r\nnumbed. Oh, Armand! will you ever know the terrible sacrifice of pride,\r\nof dignity, of womanliness a devoted sister is making for your sake?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of importance,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, staring mechanically before her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut it might prove a clue. I contrived\xe2\x80\x94no matter how\xe2\x80\x94to detect Sir\r\nAndrew Ffoulkes in the very act of burning a paper at one of these\r\ncandles, in this very room. That paper I succeeded in holding between\r\nmy fingers for the space of two minutes, and to cast my eye on it for\r\nthat of ten seconds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime enough to learn its contents?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Chauvelin, quietly.\r\n\r\nShe nodded. Then she continued in the same even, mechanical tone of\r\nvoice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the corner of the paper there was the usual rough device of a small\r\nstar-shaped flower. Above it I read two lines, everything else was\r\nscorched and blackened by the flame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what were these two lines?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer throat seemed suddenly to have contracted. For an instant she felt\r\nthat she could not speak the words, which might send a brave man to his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is lucky that the whole paper was not burned,\xe2\x80\x9d added Chauvelin,\r\nwith dry sarcasm, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it might have fared ill with Armand St. Just.\r\nWhat were the two lines, citoyenne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne was, \xe2\x80\x98I start myself to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly; \xe2\x80\x9cthe other\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98If\r\nyou wish to speak to me, I shall be in the supper-room at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nprecisely.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChauvelin looked up at the clock just above the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I have plenty of time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said placidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nShe was pale as a statue, her hands were icy cold, her head and heart\r\nthrobbed with the awful strain upon her nerves. Oh, this was cruel!\r\ncruel! What had she done to have deserved all this? Her choice was\r\nmade: had she done a vile action or one that was sublime? The recording\r\nangel, who writes in the book of gold, alone could give an answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated mechanically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing for the present. After that it will depend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn whom I shall see in the supper-room at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock precisely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will see the Scarlet Pimpernel, of course. But you do not know\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. But I shall presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Andrew will have warned him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not. When you parted from him after the minuet he stood and\r\nwatched you, for a moment or two, with a look which gave me to\r\nunderstand that something had happened between you. It was only\r\nnatural, was it not? that I should make a shrewd guess as to the nature\r\nof that \xe2\x80\x98something.\xe2\x80\x99 I thereupon engaged the young gallant in a long\r\nand animated conversation\xe2\x80\x94we discussed Herr Gl\xc3\xbcck\xe2\x80\x99s singular success in\r\nLondon\xe2\x80\x94until a lady claimed his arm for supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not lose sight of him through supper. When we all came upstairs\r\nagain, Lady Portarles buttonholed him and started on the subject of\r\npretty Mlle. Suzanne de Tournay. I knew he would not move until Lady\r\nPortarles had exhausted the subject, which will not be for another\r\nquarter of an hour at least, and it is five minutes to one now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was preparing to go, and went up to the doorway, where, drawing\r\naside the curtain, he stood for a moment pointing out to Marguerite the\r\ndistant figure of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes in close conversation with Lady\r\nPortarles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a triumphant smile, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I may safely expect\r\nto find the person I seek in the dining-room, fair lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere may be more than one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever is there, as the clock strikes one, will be shadowed by one of\r\nmy men; of these, one, or perhaps two, or even three, will leave for\r\nFrance to-morrow. _One_ of these will be the \xe2\x80\x98Scarlet Pimpernel.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x94And?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI also, fair lady, will leave for France to-morrow. The papers found\r\nat Dover upon the person of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes speak of the\r\nneighbourhood of Calais, of an inn which I know well, called \xe2\x80\x98Le Chat\r\nGris,\xe2\x80\x99 of a lonely place somewhere on the coast\xe2\x80\x94the P\xc3\xa8re Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhut\xe2\x80\x94which I must endeavour to find. All these places are given as the\r\npoint where this meddlesome Englishman has bidden the traitor de\r\nTournay and others to meet his emissaries. But it seems that he has\r\ndecided not to send his emissaries, that \xe2\x80\x98he will start himself\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99 Now, one of those persons whom I shall see anon in the\r\nsupper-room, will be journeying to Calais, and I shall follow that\r\nperson, until I have tracked him to where those fugitive aristocrats\r\nawait him; for that person, fair lady, will be the man whom I have\r\nsought for, for nearly a year, the man whose energy has outdone me,\r\nwhose ingenuity has baffled me, whose audacity has set me\r\nwondering\xe2\x80\x94yes! me!\xe2\x80\x94who have seen a trick or two in my time\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nmysterious and elusive Scarlet Pimpernel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Armand?\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I ever broken my word? I promise you that the day the Scarlet\r\nPimpernel and I start for France, I will send you that imprudent letter\r\nof his by special courier. More than that, I will pledge you the word\r\nof France, that the day I lay hands on that meddlesome Englishman, St.\r\nJust will be here in England, safe in the arms of his charming sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with a deep and elaborate bow and another look at the clock,\r\nChauvelin glided out of the room.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Marguerite that through all the noise, all the din of\r\nmusic, dancing, and laughter, she could hear his cat-like tread,\r\ngliding through the vast reception-rooms; that she could hear him go\r\ndown the massive staircase, reach the dining-room and open the door.\r\nFate _had_ decided, had made her speak, had made her do a vile and\r\nabominable thing, for the sake of the brother she loved. She lay back\r\nin her chair, passive and still, seeing the figure of her relentless\r\nenemy ever present before her aching eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen Chauvelin reached the supper-room it was quite deserted. It had\r\nthat woebegone, forsaken, tawdry appearance, which reminds one so much\r\nof a ball-dress, the morning after.\r\n\r\nHalf-empty glasses littered the table, unfolded napkins lay about, the\r\nchairs\xe2\x80\x94turned towards one another in groups of twos and threes\xe2\x80\x94seemed\r\nlike the seats of ghosts, in close conversation with one another. There\r\nwere sets of two chairs\xe2\x80\x94very close to one another\xe2\x80\x94in the far corners of\r\nthe room, which spoke of recent whispered flirtations, over cold\r\ngame-pie and champagne; there were sets of three and four chairs, that\r\nrecalled pleasant, animated discussions over the latest scandals; there\r\nwere chairs straight up in a row that still looked starchy, critical,\r\nacid, like antiquated dowagers; there were a few isolated, single\r\nchairs, close to the table, that spoke of gourmands intent on the most\r\n_recherch\xc3\xa9_ dishes, and others overturned on the floor, that spoke\r\nvolumes on the subject of my Lord Grenville\xe2\x80\x99s cellars.\r\n\r\nIt was a ghostlike replica, in fact, of that fashionable gathering\r\nupstairs; a ghost that haunts every house where balls and good suppers\r\nare given; a picture drawn with white chalk on grey cardboard, dull and\r\ncolourless, now that the bright silk dresses and gorgeously embroidered\r\ncoats were no longer there to fill in the foreground, and now that the\r\ncandles flickered sleepily in their sockets.\r\n\r\nChauvelin smiled benignly, and rubbing his long, thin hands together,\r\nhe looked round the deserted supper-room, whence even the last flunkey\r\nhad retired in order to join his friends in the hall below. All was\r\nsilence in the dimly-lighted room, whilst the sound of the gavotte, the\r\nhum of distant talk and laughter, and the rumble of an occasional coach\r\noutside, only seemed to reach this palace of the Sleeping Beauty as the\r\nmurmur of some flitting spooks far away.\r\n\r\nIt all looked so peaceful, so luxurious, and so still, that the keenest\r\nobserver\xe2\x80\x94a veritable prophet\xe2\x80\x94could never have guessed that, at this\r\npresent moment, that deserted supper-room was nothing but a trap laid\r\nfor the capture of the most cunning and audacious plotter those\r\nstirring times had ever seen.\r\n\r\nChauvelin pondered and tried to peer into the immediate future. What\r\nwould this man be like, whom he and the leaders of a whole revolution\r\nhad sworn to bring to his death? Everything about him was weird and\r\nmysterious; his personality, which he had so cunningly concealed, the\r\npower he wielded over nineteen English gentlemen who seemed to obey his\r\nevery command blindly and enthusiastically, the passionate love and\r\nsubmission he had roused in his little trained band, and, above all,\r\nhis marvellous audacity, the boundless impudence which had caused him\r\nto beard his most implacable enemies, within the very walls of Paris.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that in France the _sobriquet_ of the mysterious Englishman\r\nroused in the people a superstitious shudder. Chauvelin himself as he\r\ngazed round the deserted room, where presently the weird hero would\r\nappear, felt a strange feeling of awe creeping all down his spine.\r\n\r\nBut his plans were well laid. He felt sure that the Scarlet Pimpernel\r\nhad not been warned, and felt equally sure that Marguerite Blakeney had\r\nnot played him false. If she had . . . a cruel look, that would have\r\nmade her shudder, gleamed in Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s keen, pale eyes. If she had\r\nplayed him a trick, Armand St. Just would suffer the extreme penalty.\r\n\r\nBut no, no! of course she had not played him false!\r\n\r\nFortunately the supper-room was deserted: this would make Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntask all the easier, when presently that unsuspecting enigma would\r\nenter it alone. No one was here now save Chauvelin himself.\r\n\r\nStay! as he surveyed with a satisfied smile the solitude of the room,\r\nthe cunning agent of the French Government became aware of the\r\npeaceful, monotonous breathing of some one of my Lord Grenville\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nguests, who, no doubt, had supped both wisely and well, and was\r\nenjoying a quiet sleep, away from the din of the dancing above.\r\n\r\nChauvelin looked round once more, and there in the corner of a sofa, in\r\nthe dark angle of the room, his mouth open, his eyes shut, the sweet\r\nsounds of peaceful slumbers proceeding from his nostrils, reclined the\r\ngorgeously-apparelled, long-limbed husband of the cleverest woman in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nChauvelin looked at him as he lay there, placid, unconscious, at peace\r\nwith all the world and himself, after the best of suppers, and a smile,\r\nthat was almost one of pity, softened for a moment the hard lines of\r\nthe Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s face and the sarcastic twinkle of his pale eyes.\r\n\r\nEvidently the slumberer, deep in dreamless sleep, would not interfere\r\nwith Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s trap for catching that cunning Scarlet Pimpernel.\r\nAgain he rubbed his hands together, and, following the example of Sir\r\nPercy Blakeney, he, too, stretched himself out in the corner of another\r\nsofa, shut his eyes, opened his mouth, gave forth sounds of peaceful\r\nbreathing, and . . . waited!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nDOUBT\r\n\r\n\r\nMarguerite Blakeney had watched the slight sable-clad figure of\r\nChauvelin, as he worked his way through the ball-room. Then perforce\r\nshe had had to wait, while her nerves tingled with excitement.\r\n\r\nListlessly she sat in the small, still deserted boudoir, looking out\r\nthrough the curtained doorway on the dancing couples beyond: looking at\r\nthem, yet seeing nothing, hearing the music, yet conscious of naught\r\nsave a feeling of expectancy, of anxious, weary waiting.\r\n\r\nHer mind conjured up before her the vision of what was, perhaps at this\r\nvery moment, passing downstairs. The half-deserted dining-room, the\r\nfateful hour\xe2\x80\x94Chauvelin on the watch!\xe2\x80\x94then, precise to the moment, the\r\nentrance of a man, he, the Scarlet Pimpernel, the mysterious leader,\r\nwho to Marguerite had become almost unreal, so strange, so weird was\r\nthis hidden identity.\r\n\r\nShe wished she were in the supper-room, too, at this moment, watching\r\nhim as he entered; she knew that her woman\xe2\x80\x99s penetration would at once\r\nrecognise in the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s face\xe2\x80\x94whoever he might be\xe2\x80\x94that strong\r\nindividuality which belongs to a leader of men\xe2\x80\x94to a hero: to the\r\nmighty, high-soaring eagle, whose daring wings were becoming entangled\r\nin the ferret\xe2\x80\x99s trap.\r\n\r\nWoman-like, she thought of him with unmixed sadness; the irony of that\r\nfate seemed so cruel which allowed the fearless lion to succumb to the\r\ngnawing of a rat! Ah! had Armand\xe2\x80\x99s life not been at stake! . . .\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith! your ladyship must have thought me very remiss,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice\r\nsuddenly, close to her elbow. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a deal of difficulty in delivering\r\nyour message, for I could not find Blakeney anywhere at first . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite had forgotten all about her husband and her message to him;\r\nhis very name, as spoken by Lord Fancourt, sounded strange and\r\nunfamiliar to her, so completely had she in the last five minutes lived\r\nher old life in the Rue de Richelieu again, with Armand always near her\r\nto love and protect her, to guard her from the many subtle intrigues\r\nwhich were forever raging in Paris in those days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did find him at last,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Lord Fancourt, \xe2\x80\x9cand gave him your\r\nmessage. He said that he would give orders at once for the horses to be\r\nput to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, still very absently, \xe2\x80\x9cyou found my husband, and gave\r\nhim my message?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; he was in the dining-room fast asleep. I could not manage to wake\r\nhim up at first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much,\xe2\x80\x9d she said mechanically, trying to collect her\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill your ladyship honour me with the _contredanse_ until your coach\r\nis ready?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lord Fancourt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I thank you, my lord, but\xe2\x80\x94and you will forgive me\xe2\x80\x94I really am too\r\ntired, and the heat in the ball-room has become oppressive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe conservatory is deliciously cool; let me take you there, and then\r\nget you something. You seem ailing, Lady Blakeney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am only very tired,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated wearily, as she allowed Lord\r\nFancourt to lead her, where subdued lights and green plants lent\r\ncoolness to the air. He got her a chair, into which she sank. This long\r\ninterval of waiting was intolerable. Why did not Chauvelin come and\r\ntell her the result of his watch?\r\n\r\nLord Fancourt was very attentive. She scarcely heard what he said, and\r\nsuddenly startled him by asking abruptly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord Fancourt, did you perceive who was in the dining-room just now\r\nbesides Sir Percy Blakeney?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly the agent of the French Government, M. Chauvelin, equally fast\r\nasleep in another corner,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy does your ladyship ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not . . . I . . . Did you notice the time when you were there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been about five or ten minutes past one. . . . I wonder\r\nwhat your ladyship is thinking about,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, for evidently the fair\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts were very far away, and she had not been listening to\r\nhis intellectual conversation.\r\n\r\nBut indeed her thoughts were not very far away: only one storey below,\r\nin this same house, in the dining-room where sat Chauvelin still on the\r\nwatch. Had he failed? For one instant that possibility rose before her\r\nas a hope\xe2\x80\x94the hope that the Scarlet Pimpernel had been warned by Sir\r\nAndrew, and that Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s trap had failed to catch his bird; but\r\nthat hope soon gave way to fear. Had he failed? But then\xe2\x80\x94Armand!\r\n\r\nLord Fancourt had given up talking since he found that he had no\r\nlistener. He wanted an opportunity for slipping away: for sitting\r\nopposite to a lady, however fair, who is evidently not heeding the most\r\nvigorous efforts made for her entertainment, is not exhilarating, even\r\nto a Cabinet Minister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I find out if your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s coach is ready,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last,\r\ntentatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thank you . . . thank you . . . if you would be so kind . . . I\r\nfear I am but sorry company . . . but I am really tired . . . and,\r\nperhaps, would be best alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She had been longing to be rid of him, for she hoped that, like the\r\n fox he so resembled, Chauvelin would be prowling round, thinking to\r\n find her alone.\r\n\r\nBut Lord Fancourt went, and still Chauvelin did not come. Oh! what had\r\nhappened? She felt Armand\xe2\x80\x99s fate trembling in the balance . . . she\r\nfeared\xe2\x80\x94now with a deadly fear\xe2\x80\x94that Chauvelin _had_ failed, and that the\r\nmysterious Scarlet Pimpernel had proved elusive once more; then she\r\nknew that she need hope for no pity, no mercy, from him.\r\n\r\nHe had pronounced his \xe2\x80\x9cEither\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and nothing less would content him:\r\nhe was very spiteful, and would affect the belief that she had wilfully\r\nmisled him, and having failed to trap the eagle once again, his\r\nrevengeful mind would be content with the humble prey\xe2\x80\x94Armand!\r\n\r\nYet she had done her best; had strained every nerve for Armand\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\nShe could not bear to think that all had failed. She could not sit\r\nstill; she wanted to go and hear the worst at once; she wondered even\r\nthat Chauvelin had not come yet, to vent his wrath and satire upon her.\r\n\r\nLord Grenville himself came presently to tell her that her coach was\r\nready, and that Sir Percy was already waiting for her\xe2\x80\x94ribbons in hand.\r\nMarguerite said \xe2\x80\x9cFarewell\xe2\x80\x9d to her distinguished host; many of her\r\nfriends stopped her, as she crossed the rooms, to talk to her, and\r\nexchange pleasant _au revoirs_.\r\n\r\nThe Minister only took final leave of beautiful Lady Blakeney on the\r\ntop of the stairs; below, on the landing, a veritable army of gallant\r\ngentlemen were waiting to bid \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye\xe2\x80\x9d to the queen of beauty and\r\nfashion, whilst outside, under the massive portico, Sir Percy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmagnificent bays were impatiently pawing the ground.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the stairs, just after she had taken final leave of her\r\nhost, she suddenly saw Chauvelin; he was coming up the stairs slowly,\r\nand rubbing his thin hands very softly together.\r\n\r\nThere was a curious look on his mobile face, partly amused and wholly\r\npuzzled, and as his keen eyes met Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s they became strangely\r\nsarcastic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM. Chauvelin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as he stopped on the top of the stairs,\r\nbowing elaborately before her, \xe2\x80\x9cmy coach is outside; may I claim your\r\narm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs gallant as ever, he offered her his arm and led her downstairs. The\r\ncrowd was very great, some of the Minister\xe2\x80\x99s guests were departing,\r\nothers were leaning against the banisters watching the throng as it\r\nfiled up and down the wide staircase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChauvelin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last desperately, \xe2\x80\x9cI must know what has\r\nhappened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened, dear lady?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with affected surprise.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? When?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are torturing me, Chauvelin. I have helped you to-night . . .\r\nsurely I have the right to know. What happened in the dining-room at\r\none o\xe2\x80\x99clock just now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke in a whisper, trusting that in the general hubbub of the\r\ncrowd her words would remain unheeded by all, save the man at her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuiet and peace reigned supreme, fair lady; at that hour I was asleep\r\nin the corner of one sofa and Sir Percy Blakeney in another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody came into the room at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we have failed, you and I? . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! we have failed\xe2\x80\x94perhaps . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Armand?\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Armand St. Just\xe2\x80\x99s chances hang on a thread . . . pray heaven, dear\r\nlady, that that thread may not snap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChauvelin, I worked for you, sincerely, earnestly . . . remember. . .\r\n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember my promise,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quietly; \xe2\x80\x9cthe day that the Scarlet\r\nPimpernel and I meet on French soil, St. Just will be in the arms of\r\nhis charming sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich means that a brave man\xe2\x80\x99s blood will be on my hands,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nwith a shudder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis blood, or that of your brother. Surely at the present moment you\r\nmust hope, as I do, that the enigmatical Scarlet Pimpernel will start\r\nfor Calais to-day\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am only conscious of one hope, citoyen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Satan, your master, will have need of you elsewhere, before the\r\nsun rises to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou flatter me, citoyenne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had detained him for a while, midway down the stairs, trying to get\r\nat the thoughts which lay beyond that thin, fox-like mask. But\r\nChauvelin remained urbane, sarcastic, mysterious; not a line betrayed\r\nto the poor, anxious woman whether she need fear or whether she dared\r\nto hope.\r\n\r\nDownstairs on the landing she was soon surrounded. Lady Blakeney never\r\nstepped from any house into her coach, without an escort of fluttering\r\nhuman moths around the dazzling light of her beauty. But before she\r\nfinally turned away from Chauvelin, she held out a tiny hand to him,\r\nwith that pretty gesture of childish appeal which was so essentially\r\nher own.\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cGive me some hope, my little Chauvelin,\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded.\r\n\r\nWith perfect gallantry he bowed over that tiny hand, which looked so\r\ndainty and white through the delicately transparent black lace mitten,\r\nand kissing the tips of the rosy fingers:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray heaven that the thread may not snap,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, with his\r\nenigmatic smile.\r\n\r\nAnd stepping aside, he allowed the moths to flutter more closely round\r\nthe candle, and the brilliant throng of the _jeunesse dor\xc3\xa9e_, eagerly\r\nattentive to Lady Blakeney\xe2\x80\x99s every movement, hid the keen, fox-like\r\nface from her view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nRICHMOND\r\n\r\n\r\nA few minutes later she was sitting, wrapped in costly furs, near Sir\r\nPercy Blakeney on the box-seat of his magnificent coach, and the four\r\nsplendid bays had thundered down the quiet street.\r\n\r\nThe night was warm in spite of the gentle breeze which fanned\r\nMarguerite\xe2\x80\x99s burning cheeks. Soon London houses were left behind, and\r\nrattling over old Hammersmith Bridge, Sir Percy was driving his bays\r\nrapidly towards Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe river wound in and out in its pretty delicate curves, looking like\r\na silver serpent beneath the glittering rays of the moon. Long shadows\r\nfrom overhanging trees spread occasional deep palls right across the\r\nroad. The bays were rushing along at breakneck speed, held but slightly\r\nback by Sir Percy\xe2\x80\x99s strong, unerring hands.\r\n\r\nThese nightly drives after balls and suppers in London were a source of\r\nperpetual delight to Marguerite, and she appreciated her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neccentricity keenly, which caused him to adopt this mode of taking her\r\nhome every night, to their beautiful home by the river, instead of\r\nliving in a stuffy London house. He loved driving his spirited horses\r\nalong the lonely, moonlit roads, and she loved to sit on the box-seat,\r\nwith the soft air of an English late summer\xe2\x80\x99s night fanning her face\r\nafter the hot atmosphere of a ball or supper-party. The drive was not a\r\nlong one\xe2\x80\x94less than an hour, sometimes, when the bays were very fresh,\r\nand Sir Percy gave them full rein.\r\n\r\nTo-night he seemed to have a very devil in his fingers, and the coach\r\nseemed to fly along the road, beside the river. As usual, he did not\r\nspeak to her, but stared straight in front of him, the ribbons seeming\r\nto lie quite loosely in his slender, white hands. Marguerite looked at\r\nhim tentatively once or twice; she could see his handsome profile, and\r\none lazy eye, with its straight fine brow and drooping heavy lid.\r\n\r\nThe face in the moonlight looked singularly earnest, and recalled to\r\nMarguerite\xe2\x80\x99s aching heart those happy days of courtship, before he had\r\nbecome the lazy nincompoop, the effete fop, whose life seemed spent in\r\ncard and supper rooms.\r\n\r\nBut now, in the moonlight, she could not catch the expression of the\r\nlazy blue eyes; she could only see the outline of the firm chin, the\r\ncorner of the strong mouth, the well-cut massive shape of the forehead;\r\ntruly, nature had meant well by Sir Percy; his faults must all be laid\r\nat the door of that poor, half-crazy mother, and of the distracted\r\nheart-broken father, neither of whom had cared for the young life which\r\nwas sprouting up between them, and which, perhaps, their very\r\ncarelessness was already beginning to wreck.\r\n\r\nMarguerite suddenly felt intense sympathy for her husband. The moral\r\ncrisis she had just gone through made her feel indulgent towards the\r\nfaults, the delinquencies, of others.\r\n\r\nHow thoroughly a human being can be buffeted and overmastered by Fate,\r\nhad been borne in upon her with appalling force. Had anyone told her a\r\nweek ago that she would stoop to spy upon her friends, that she would\r\nbetray a brave and unsuspecting man into the hands of a relentless\r\nenemy, she would have laughed the idea to scorn.\r\n\r\nYet she had done these things; anon, perhaps the death of that brave\r\nman would be at her door, just as two years ago the Marquis de St. Cyr\r\nhad perished through a thoughtless word of hers; but in that case she\r\nwas morally innocent\xe2\x80\x94she had meant no serious harm\xe2\x80\x94fate merely had\r\nstepped in. But this time she had done a thing that obviously was base,\r\nhad done it deliberately, for a motive which, perhaps, high moralists\r\nwould not even appreciate.\r\n\r\nAnd as she felt her husband\xe2\x80\x99s strong arm beside her, she also felt how\r\nmuch more he would dislike and despise her, if he knew of this night\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork. Thus human beings judge of one another, superficially, casually,\r\nthrowing contempt on one another, with but little reason, and no\r\ncharity. She despised her husband for his inanities and vulgar,\r\nunintellectual occupations; and he, she felt, would despise her still\r\nworse, because she had not been strong enough to do right for right\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, and to sacrifice her brother to the dictates of her conscience.\r\n\r\nBuried in her thoughts, Marguerite had found this hour in the breezy\r\nsummer night all too brief; and it was with a feeling of keen\r\ndisappointment, that she suddenly realised that the bays had turned\r\ninto the massive gates of her beautiful English home.\r\n\r\nSir Percy Blakeney\xe2\x80\x99s house on the river has become a historic one:\r\npalatial in its dimensions, it stands in the midst of exquisitely\r\nlaid-out gardens, with a picturesque terrace and frontage to the river.\r\nBuilt in Tudor days, the old red brick of the walls looks eminently\r\npicturesque in the midst of a bower of green, the beautiful lawn, with\r\nits old sun-dial, adding the true note of harmony to its foreground.\r\nGreat secular trees lent cool shadows to the grounds, and now, on this\r\nwarm early autumn night, the leaves slightly turned to russets and\r\ngold, the old garden looked singularly poetic and peaceful in the\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\nWith unerring precision, Sir Percy had brought the four bays to a\r\nstandstill immediately in front of the fine Elizabethan entrance hall;\r\nin spite of the lateness of the hour, an army of grooms seemed to have\r\nemerged from the very ground, as the coach had thundered up, and were\r\nstanding respectfully round.\r\n\r\nSir Percy jumped down quickly, then helped Marguerite to alight. She\r\nlingered outside for a moment, whilst he gave a few orders to one of\r\nhis men. She skirted the house, and stepped on to the lawn, looking out\r\ndreamily into the silvery landscape. Nature seemed exquisitely at\r\npeace, in comparison with the tumultuous emotions she had gone through:\r\nshe could faintly hear the ripple of the river and the occasional soft\r\nand ghostlike fall of a dead leaf from a tree.\r\n\r\nAll else was quiet round her. She had heard the horses prancing as they\r\nwere being led away to their distant stables, the hurrying of servants\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfeet as they had all gone within to rest: the house also was quite\r\nstill. In two separate suites of apartments, just above the magnificent\r\nreception-rooms, lights were still burning; they were her rooms, and\r\nhis, well divided from each other by the whole width of the house, as\r\nfar apart as their own lives had become. Involuntarily she sighed\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nthat moment she could really not have told why.\r\n\r\nShe was suffering from unconquerable heartache. Deeply and achingly she\r\nwas sorry for herself. Never had she felt so pitiably lonely, so\r\nbitterly in want of comfort and of sympathy. With another sigh she\r\nturned away from the river towards the house, vaguely wondering if,\r\nafter such a night, she could ever find rest and sleep.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, before she reached the terrace, she heard a firm step upon\r\nthe crisp gravel, and the next moment her husband\xe2\x80\x99s figure emerged out\r\nof the shadow. He, too, had skirted the house, and was wandering along\r\nthe lawn, towards the river. He still wore his heavy driving coat with\r\nthe numerous lapels and collars he himself had set in fashion, but he\r\nhad thrown it well back, burying his hands as was his wont, in the deep\r\npockets of his satin breeches: the gorgeous white costume he had worn\r\nat Lord Grenville\xe2\x80\x99s ball, with its jabot of priceless lace, looked\r\nstrangely ghostly against the dark background of the house.\r\n\r\nHe apparently did not notice her, for, after a few moments\xe2\x80\x99 pause, he\r\npresently turned back towards the house, and walked straight up to the\r\nterrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Percy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe already had one foot on the lowest of the terrace steps, but at her\r\nvoice he started, and paused, then looked searchingly into the shadows\r\nwhence she had called to him.\r\n\r\nShe came forward quickly into the moonlight, and, as soon as he saw\r\nher, he said, with that air of consummate gallantry he always wore when\r\nspeaking to her,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt your service, Madame!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n But his foot was still on the step, and in his whole attitude there\r\n was a remote suggestion, distinctly visible to her, that he wished to\r\n go, and had no desire for a midnight interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe air is deliciously cool,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe moonlight peaceful and\r\npoetic, and the garden inviting. Will you not stay in it awhile; the\r\nhour is not yet late, or is my company so distasteful to you, that you\r\nare in a hurry to rid yourself of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined placidly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut \xe2\x80\x99tis on the other foot the\r\nshoe happens to be, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant you\xe2\x80\x99ll find the midnight air more\r\npoetic without my company: no doubt the sooner I remove the obstruction\r\nthe better your ladyship will like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned once more to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI protest you mistake me, Sir Percy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hurriedly, and drawing\r\na little closer to him; \xe2\x80\x9cthe estrangement, which, alas! has arisen\r\nbetween us, was none of my making, remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegad! you must pardon me there, Madame!\xe2\x80\x9d he protested coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cmy\r\nmemory was always of the shortest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked her straight in the eyes, with that lazy nonchalance which\r\nhad become second nature to him. She returned his gaze for a moment,\r\nthen her eyes softened, as she came up quite close to him, to the foot\r\nof the terrace steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the shortest, Sir Percy? Faith! how it must have altered! Was it\r\nthree years ago or four that you saw me for one hour in Paris, on your\r\nway to the East? When you came back two years later you had not\r\nforgotten me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked divinely pretty as she stood there in the moonlight, with\r\nthe fur-cloak sliding off her beautiful shoulders, the gold embroidery\r\non her dress shimmering around her, her childlike blue eyes turned up\r\nfully at him.\r\n\r\nHe stood for a moment, rigid and still, but for the clenching of his\r\nhand against the stone balustrade of the terrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou desired my presence, Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d he said frigidly. \xe2\x80\x9cI take it that it\r\nwas not with a view to indulging in tender reminiscences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice certainly was cold and uncompromising: his attitude before\r\nher, stiff and unbending. Womanly decorum would have suggested that\r\nMarguerite should return coldness for coldness, and should sweep past\r\nhim without another word, only with a curt nod of the head: but womanly\r\ninstinct suggested that she should remain\xe2\x80\x94that keen instinct, which\r\nmakes a beautiful woman conscious of her powers long to bring to her\r\nknees the one man who pays her no homage. She stretched out her hand to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Sir Percy, why not? the present is not so glorious but that I\r\nshould not wish to dwell a little in the past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bent his tall figure, and taking hold of the extreme tip of the\r\nfingers which she still held out to him, he kissed them ceremoniously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99 faith, Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthen you will pardon me, if my dull wits\r\ncannot accompany you there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce again he attempted to go, once more her voice, sweet, childlike,\r\nalmost tender, called him back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Percy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour servant, Madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that love can die?\xe2\x80\x9d she said with sudden, unreasoning\r\nvehemence. \xe2\x80\x9cMethought that the passion which you once felt for me would\r\noutlast the span of human life. Is there nothing left of that love,\r\nPercy . . . which might help you . . . to bridge over that sad\r\nestrangement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis massive figure seemed, while she spoke thus to him, to stiffen\r\nstill more, the strong mouth hardened, a look of relentless obstinacy\r\ncrept into the habitually lazy blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith what object, I pray you, Madame?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet \xe2\x80\x99tis simple enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with sudden bitterness, which seemed\r\nliterally to surge through his words, though he was making visible\r\nefforts to suppress it, \xe2\x80\x9cI humbly put the question to you, for my slow\r\nwits are unable to grasp the cause of this, your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s sudden new\r\nmood. Is it that you have the taste to renew the devilish sport which\r\nyou played so successfully last year? Do you wish to see me once more a\r\nlove-sick suppliant at your feet, so that you might again have the\r\npleasure of kicking me aside, like a troublesome lap-dog?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had succeeded in rousing him for the moment: and again she looked\r\nstraight at him, for it was thus she remembered him a year ago.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPercy! I entreat you!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9ccan we not bury the past?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, Madame, but I understood you to say that your desire was to\r\ndwell in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay! I spoke not of _that_ past, Percy!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, while a tone of\r\ntenderness crept into her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cRather did I speak of the time when\r\nyou loved me still! and I . . . oh! I was vain and frivolous; your\r\nwealth and position allured me: I married you, hoping in my heart that\r\nyour great love for me would beget in me a love for you . . . but,\r\nalas! . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe moon had sunk low down behind a bank of clouds. In the east a soft\r\ngrey light was beginning to chase away the heavy mantle of the night.\r\nHe could only see her graceful outline now, the small queenly head,\r\nwith its wealth of reddish golden curls, and the glittering gems\r\nforming the small, star-shaped, red flower which she wore as a diadem\r\nin her hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-four hours after our marriage, Madame, the Marquis de St. Cyr\r\nand all his family perished on the guillotine, and the popular rumour\r\nreached me that it was the wife of Sir Percy Blakeney who helped to\r\nsend them there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay! I myself told you the truth of that odious tale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot till after it had been recounted to me by strangers, with all its\r\nhorrible details.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you believed them then and there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with great vehemence,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwithout a proof or question\xe2\x80\x94you believed that I, whom you vowed you\r\nloved more than life, whom you professed you worshipped, that _I_ could\r\ndo a thing so base as these _strangers_ chose to recount. You thought I\r\nmeant to deceive you about it all\xe2\x80\x94that I ought to have spoken before I\r\nmarried you: yet, had you listened, I would have told you that up to\r\nthe very morning on which St. Cyr went to the guillotine, I was\r\nstraining every nerve, using every influence I possessed, to save him\r\nand his family. But my pride sealed my lips, when your love seemed to\r\nperish, as if under the knife of that same guillotine. Yet I would have\r\ntold you how I was duped! Aye! I, whom that same popular rumour had\r\nendowed with the sharpest wits in France! I was tricked into doing this\r\nthing, by men who knew how to play upon my love for an only brother,\r\nand my desire for revenge. Was it unnatural?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice became choked with tears. She paused for a moment or two,\r\ntrying to regain some sort of composure. She looked appealingly at him,\r\nalmost as if he were her judge. He had allowed her to speak on in her\r\nown vehement, impassioned way, offering no comment, no word of\r\nsympathy: and now, while she paused, trying to swallow down the hot\r\ntears that gushed to her eyes, he waited, impassive and still. The dim,\r\ngrey light of early dawn seemed to make his tall form look taller and\r\nmore rigid. The lazy, good-natured face looked strangely altered.\r\nMarguerite, excited, as she was, could see that the eyes were no longer\r\nlanguid, the mouth no longer good-humoured and inane. A curious look of\r\nintense passion seemed to glow from beneath his drooping lids, the\r\nmouth was tightly closed, the lips compressed, as if the will alone\r\nheld that surging passion in check.\r\n\r\nMarguerite Blakeney was, above all, a woman, with all a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfascinating foibles, all a woman\xe2\x80\x99s most lovable sins. She knew in a\r\nmoment that for the past few months she had been mistaken: that this\r\nman who stood here before her, cold as a statue, when her musical voice\r\nstruck upon his ear, loved her, as he had loved her a year ago: that\r\nhis passion might have been dormant, but that it was there, as strong,\r\nas intense, as overwhelming, as when first her lips met his in one\r\nlong, maddening kiss.\r\n\r\n Pride had kept him from her, and, woman-like, she meant to win back\r\n that conquest which had been hers before. Suddenly it seemed to her\r\n that the only happiness life could ever hold for her again would be in\r\n feeling that man\xe2\x80\x99s kiss once more upon her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to the tale, Sir Percy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and her voice now was low,\r\nsweet, infinitely tender. \xe2\x80\x9cArmand was all in all to me! We had no\r\nparents, and brought one another up. He was my little father, and I,\r\nhis tiny mother; we loved one another so. Then one day\xe2\x80\x94do you mind me,\r\nSir Percy? the Marquis de St. Cyr had my brother Armand\r\nthrashed\xe2\x80\x94thrashed by his lacqueys\xe2\x80\x94that brother whom I loved better than\r\nall the world! And his offence? That he, a plebeian, had dared to love\r\nthe daughter of the aristocrat; for that he was waylaid and thrashed .\r\n. . thrashed like a dog within an inch of his life! Oh, how I suffered!\r\nhis humiliation had eaten into my very soul! When the opportunity\r\noccurred, and I was able to take my revenge, I took it. But I only\r\nthought to bring that proud marquis to trouble and humiliation. He\r\nplotted with Austria against his own country. Chance gave me knowledge\r\nof this; I spoke of it, but I did not know\xe2\x80\x94how could I guess?\xe2\x80\x94they\r\ntrapped and duped me. When I realised what I had done, it was too\r\nlate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is perhaps a little difficult, Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Percy, after a\r\nmoment of silence between them, \xe2\x80\x9cto go back over the past. I have\r\nconfessed to you that my memory is short, but the thought certainly\r\nlingered in my mind that, at the time of the Marquis\xe2\x80\x99 death, I\r\nentreated you for an explanation of those same noisome popular rumours.\r\nIf that same memory does not, even now, play me a trick, I fancy that\r\nyou refused me _all_ explanation then, and demanded of my love a\r\nhumiliating allegiance it was not prepared to give.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wished to test your love for me, and it did not bear the test. You\r\nused to tell me that you drew the very breath of life but for me, and\r\nfor love of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to probe that love, you demanded that I should forfeit mine\r\nhonour,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, whilst gradually his impassiveness seemed to leave\r\nhim, his rigidity to relax; \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should accept without murmur or\r\nquestion, as a dumb and submissive slave, every action of my mistress.\r\nMy heart overflowing with love and passion, I _asked_ for no\r\nexplanation\xe2\x80\x94I _waited_ for one, not doubting\xe2\x80\x94only hoping. Had you\r\nspoken but one word, from you I would have accepted any explanation and\r\nbelieved it. But you left me without a word, beyond a bald confession\r\nof the actual horrible facts; proudly you returned to your brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, and left me alone . . . for weeks . . . not knowing, now, in\r\nwhom to believe, since the shrine, which contained my one illusion, lay\r\nshattered to earth at my feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe need not complain now that he was cold and impassive; his very\r\nvoice shook with an intensity of passion, which he was making\r\nsuperhuman efforts to keep in check.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye! the madness of my pride!\xe2\x80\x9d she said sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cHardly had I gone,\r\nalready I had repented. But when I returned, I found you, oh, so\r\naltered! wearing already that mask of somnolent indifference which you\r\nhave never laid aside until . . . until now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was so close to him that her soft, loose hair was wafted against\r\nhis cheek; her eyes, glowing with tears, maddened him, the music in her\r\nvoice sent fire through his veins. But he would not yield to the magic\r\ncharm of this woman whom he had so deeply loved, and at whose hands his\r\npride had suffered so bitterly. He closed his eyes to shut out the\r\ndainty vision of that sweet face, of that snow-white neck and graceful\r\nfigure, round which the faint rosy light of dawn was just beginning to\r\nhover playfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Madame, it is no mask,\xe2\x80\x9d he said icily; \xe2\x80\x9cI swore to you . . .\r\nonce, that my life was yours. For months now it has been your plaything\r\n. . . it has served its purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut now she knew that that very coldness was a mask. The trouble, the\r\nsorrow she had gone through last night, suddenly came back to her mind,\r\nbut no longer with bitterness, rather with a feeling that this man who\r\nloved her, would help her to bear the burden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Percy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said impulsively, \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven knows you have been at pains\r\nto make the task, which I had set to myself, terribly difficult to\r\naccomplish. You spoke of my mood just now; well! we will call it that,\r\nif you will. I wished to speak to you . . . because . . . because I was\r\nin trouble . . . and had need . . . of your sympathy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is yours to command, Madame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow cold you are!\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cFaith! I can scarce believe that but a\r\nfew months ago one tear in my eye had set you well-nigh crazy. Now I\r\ncome to you . . . with a half-broken heart . . . and . . . and . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pray you, Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, whilst his voice shook almost as much as\r\nhers, \xe2\x80\x9cin what way can I serve you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPercy!\xe2\x80\x94Armand is in deadly danger. A letter of his . . . rash,\r\nimpetuous, as were all his actions, and written to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes,\r\nhas fallen into the hands of a fanatic. Armand is hopelessly\r\ncompromised . . . to-morrow, perhaps he will be arrested . . . after\r\nthat the guillotine . . . unless . . . unless . . . oh! it is\r\nhorrible!\xe2\x80\x9d . . . she said, with a sudden wail of anguish, as all the\r\nevents of the past night came rushing back to her mind, \xe2\x80\x9chorrible! . .\r\n. and you do not understand . . . you cannot . . . and I have no one to\r\nwhom I can turn . . . for help . . . or even for sympathy. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTears now refused to be held back. All her trouble, her struggles, the\r\nawful uncertainty of Armand\xe2\x80\x99s fate overwhelmed her. She tottered, ready\r\nto fall, and leaning against the stone balustrade, she buried her face\r\nin her hands and sobbed bitterly.\r\n\r\nAt first mention of Armand St. Just\xe2\x80\x99s name and of the peril in which he\r\nstood, Sir Percy\xe2\x80\x99s face had become a shade more pale; and the look of\r\ndetermination and obstinacy appeared more marked than ever between his\r\neyes. However, he said nothing for the moment, but watched her, as her\r\ndelicate frame was shaken with sobs, watched her until unconsciously\r\nhis face softened, and what looked almost like tears seemed to glisten\r\nin his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with bitter sarcasm, \xe2\x80\x9cthe murderous dog of the\r\nrevolution is turning upon the very hands that fed it? . . . Begad,\r\nMadame,\xe2\x80\x9d he added very gently, as Marguerite continued to sob\r\nhysterically, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you dry your tears? . . . I never could bear to see\r\na pretty woman cry, and I . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstinctively, with sudden, overmastering passion, at sight of her\r\nhelplessness and of her grief, he stretched out his arms, and the next,\r\nwould have seized her and held her to him, protected from every evil\r\nwith his very life, his very heart\xe2\x80\x99s blood. . . . But pride had the\r\nbetter of it in this struggle once again; he restrained himself with a\r\ntremendous effort of will, and said coldly, though still very gently,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you not turn to me, Madame, and tell me in what way I may have\r\nthe honour to serve you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made a violent effort to control herself, and turning her\r\ntear-stained face to him, she once more held out her hand, which he\r\nkissed with the same punctilious gallantry; but Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s fingers,\r\nthis time, lingered in his hand for a second or two longer than was\r\nabsolutely necessary, and this was because she had felt that his hand\r\ntrembled perceptibly and was burning hot, whilst his lips felt as cold\r\nas marble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you do aught for Armand?\xe2\x80\x9d she said sweetly and simply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\nso much influence at court . . . so many friends . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Madame, should you not rather seek the influence of your French\r\nfriend, M. Chauvelin? His extends, if I mistake not, even as far as the\r\nRepublican Government of France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot ask him, Percy. . . . Oh! I wish I dared to tell you . . .\r\nbut . . . but . . . he has put a price on my brother\xe2\x80\x99s head, which . .\r\n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe would have given worlds if she had felt the courage then to tell\r\nhim everything . . . all she had done that night\xe2\x80\x94how she had suffered\r\nand how her hand had been forced. But she dared not give way to that\r\nimpulse . . . not now, when she was just beginning to feel that he\r\nstill loved her, when she hoped that she could win him back. She dared\r\nnot make another confession to him. After all, he might not understand;\r\nhe might not sympathise with her struggles and temptation. His love\r\nstill dormant might sleep the sleep of death.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he divined what was passing in her mind. His whole attitude was\r\none of intense longing\xe2\x80\x94a veritable prayer for that confidence, which\r\nher foolish pride withheld from him. When she remained silent he\r\nsighed, and said with marked coldness\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, Madame, since it distresses you, we will not speak of it. . . .\r\nAs for Armand, I pray you have no fear. I pledge you my word that he\r\nshall be safe. Now, have I your permission to go? The hour is getting\r\nlate, and . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will at least accept my gratitude?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she drew quite\r\nclose to him, and speaking with real tenderness.\r\n\r\nWith a quick, almost involuntary effort he would have taken her then in\r\nhis arms, for her eyes were swimming in tears, which he longed to kiss\r\naway; but she had lured him once, just like this, then cast him aside\r\nlike an ill-fitting glove. He thought this was but a mood, a caprice,\r\nand he was too proud to lend himself to it once again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too soon, Madame!\xe2\x80\x9d he said quietly; \xe2\x80\x9cI have done nothing as yet.\r\nThe hour is late, and you must be fatigued. Your women will be waiting\r\nfor you upstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood aside to allow her to pass. She sighed, a quick sigh of\r\ndisappointment. His pride and her beauty had been in direct conflict,\r\nand his pride had remained the conqueror. Perhaps, after all, she had\r\nbeen deceived just now; what she took to be the light of love in his\r\neyes might only have been the passion of pride or, who knows, of hatred\r\ninstead of love. She stood looking at him for a moment or two longer.\r\nHe was again as rigid, as impassive, as before. Pride had conquered,\r\nand he cared naught for her. The grey of dawn was gradually yielding to\r\nthe rosy light of the rising sun. Birds began to twitter; Nature\r\nawakened, smiling in happy response to the warmth of this glorious\r\nOctober morning. Only between these two hearts there lay a strong,\r\nimpassable barrier, built up of pride on both sides, which neither of\r\nthem cared to be the first to demolish.\r\n\r\nHe had bent his tall figure in a low ceremonious bow, as she finally,\r\nwith another bitter little sigh, began to mount the terrace steps.\r\n\r\nThe long train of her gold-embroidered gown swept the dead leaves off\r\nthe steps, making a faint harmonious sh\xe2\x80\x94sh\xe2\x80\x94sh as she glided up, with\r\none hand resting on the balustrade, the rosy light of dawn making an\r\naureole of gold round her hair, and causing the rubies on her head and\r\narms to sparkle. She reached the tall glass doors which led into the\r\nhouse. Before entering, she paused once again to look at him, hoping\r\nagainst hope to see his arms stretched out to her, and to hear his\r\nvoice calling her back. But he had not moved; his massive figure looked\r\nthe very personification of unbending pride, of fierce obstinacy.\r\n\r\nHot tears again surged to her eyes, and as she would not let him see\r\nthem, she turned quickly within, and ran as fast as she could up to her\r\nown rooms.\r\n\r\nHad she but turned back then, and looked out once more on to the\r\nrose-lit garden, she would have seen that which would have made her own\r\nsufferings seem but light and easy to bear\xe2\x80\x94a strong man, overwhelmed\r\nwith his own passion and his own despair. Pride had given way at last,\r\nobstinacy was gone: the will was powerless. He was but a man madly,\r\nblindly, passionately in love, and as soon as her light footsteps had\r\ndied away within the house, he knelt down upon the terrace steps, and\r\nin the very madness of his love he kissed one by one the places where\r\nher small foot had trodden, and the stone balustrade there, where her\r\ntiny hand had rested last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nFAREWELL\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Marguerite reached her room, she found her maid terribly anxious\r\nabout her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour ladyship will be so tired,\xe2\x80\x9d said the poor woman, whose own eyes\r\nwere half closed with sleep. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is past five o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes, Louise, I daresay I shall be tired presently,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMarguerite, kindly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you are very tired now, so go to bed at once.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll get into bed alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my lady . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t argue, Louise, but go to bed. Give me a wrap, and leave me\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLouise was only too glad to obey. She took off her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s gorgeous\r\nball-dress, and wrapped her up in a soft billowy gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes your ladyship wish for anything else?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, when that was\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nothing more. Put out the lights as you go out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lady. Good-night, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Louise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the maid was gone, Marguerite drew aside the curtains and threw\r\nopen the windows. The garden and the river beyond were flooded with\r\nrosy light. Far away to the east, the rays of the rising sun had\r\nchanged the rose into vivid gold. The lawn was deserted now, and\r\nMarguerite looked down upon the terrace where she had stood a few\r\nmoments ago trying vainly to win back a man\xe2\x80\x99s love, which once had been\r\nso wholly hers.\r\n\r\nIt was strange that through all her troubles, all her anxiety for\r\nArmand, she was mostly conscious at the present moment of a keen and\r\nbitter heartache.\r\n\r\nHer very limbs seemed to ache with longing for the love of a man who\r\nhad spurned her, who had resisted her tenderness, remained cold to her\r\nappeals, and had not responded to the glow of passion, which had caused\r\nher to feel and hope that those happy olden days in Paris were not all\r\ndead and forgotten.\r\n\r\nHow strange it all was! She loved him still. And now that she looked\r\nback upon the last few months of misunderstandings and of loneliness,\r\nshe realised that she had never ceased to love him; that deep down in\r\nher heart she had always vaguely felt that his foolish inanities, his\r\nempty laugh, his lazy nonchalance were nothing but a mask; that the\r\nreal man, strong, passionate, wilful, was there still\xe2\x80\x94the man she had\r\nloved, whose intensity had fascinated her, whose personality attracted\r\nher, since she always felt that behind his apparently slow wits there\r\nwas a certain something, which he kept hidden from all the world, and\r\nmost especially from her.\r\n\r\nA woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart is such a complex problem\xe2\x80\x94the owner thereof is often\r\nmost incompetent to find the solution of this puzzle.\r\n\r\nDid Marguerite Blakeney, \xe2\x80\x9cthe cleverest woman in Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d really love a\r\nfool? Was it love that she had felt for him a year ago when she married\r\nhim? Was it love she felt for him now that she realised that he still\r\nloved her, but that he would not become her slave, her passionate,\r\nardent lover once again? Nay! Marguerite herself could not have told\r\nthat. Not at this moment at any rate; perhaps her pride had sealed her\r\nmind against a better understanding of her own heart. But this she did\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94that she meant to capture that obstinate heart back again. That\r\nshe would conquer once more . . . and then, that she would never lose\r\nhim . . . . She would keep him, keep his love, deserve it, and cherish\r\nit; for this much was certain, that there was no longer any happiness\r\npossible for her without that one man\xe2\x80\x99s love.\r\n\r\nThus the most contradictory thoughts and emotions rushed madly through\r\nher mind. Absorbed in them, she had allowed time to slip by; perhaps,\r\ntired out with long excitement, she had actually closed her eyes and\r\nsunk into a troubled sleep, wherein quickly fleeting dreams seemed but\r\nthe continuation of her anxious thoughts\xe2\x80\x94when suddenly she was roused,\r\nfrom dream or meditation, by the noise of footsteps outside her door.\r\n\r\nNervously she jumped up and listened; the house itself was as still as\r\never; the footsteps had retreated. Through her wide-open windows the\r\nbrilliant rays of the morning sun were flooding her room with light.\r\nShe looked up at the clock; it was half-past six\xe2\x80\x94too early for any of\r\nthe household to be already astir.\r\n\r\nShe certainly must have dropped asleep, quite unconsciously. The noise\r\nof the footsteps, also of hushed, subdued voices had awakened her\xe2\x80\x94what\r\ncould they be?\r\n\r\nGently, on tip-toe, she crossed the room and opened the door to listen;\r\nnot a sound\xe2\x80\x94that peculiar stillness of the early morning when sleep\r\nwith all mankind is at its heaviest. But the noise had made her\r\nnervous, and when, suddenly, at her feet, on the very doorstep, she saw\r\nsomething white lying there\xe2\x80\x94a letter evidently\xe2\x80\x94she hardly dared touch\r\nit. It seemed so ghostlike. It certainly was not there when she came\r\nupstairs; had Louise dropped it? or was some tantalising spook at play,\r\nshowing her fairy letters where none existed?\r\n\r\nAt last she stooped to pick it up, and, amazed, puzzled beyond measure,\r\nshe saw that the letter was addressed to herself in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlarge, businesslike-looking hand. What could he have to say to her, in\r\nthe middle of the night, which could not be put off until the morning?\r\n\r\nShe tore open the envelope and read:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA most unforeseen circumstance forces me to leave for the North\r\nimmediately, so I beg your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s pardon if I do not avail myself\r\nof the honour of bidding you good-bye. My business may keep me employed\r\nfor about a week, so I shall not have the privilege of being present at\r\nyour ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s water-party on Wednesday. I remain your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s most\r\nhumble and most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\r\nPERCY BLAKENEY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nMarguerite must suddenly have been imbued with her husband\xe2\x80\x99s slowness\r\nof intellect, for she had perforce to read the few simple lines over\r\nand over again, before she could fully grasp their meaning.\r\n\r\nShe stood on the landing, turning over and over in her hand this curt\r\nand mysterious epistle, her mind a blank, her nerves strained with\r\nagitation and a presentiment she could not very well have explained.\r\n\r\nSir Percy owned considerable property in the North, certainly, and he\r\nhad often before gone there alone and stayed away a week at a time; but\r\nit seemed so very strange that circumstances should have arisen between\r\nfive and six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning that compelled him to start in this\r\nextreme hurry.\r\n\r\nVainly she tried to shake off an unaccustomed feeling of nervousness:\r\nshe was trembling from head to foot. A wild, unconquerable desire\r\nseized her to see her husband again, at once, if only he had not\r\nalready started.\r\n\r\nForgetting the fact that she was only very lightly clad in a morning\r\nwrap, and that her hair lay loosely about her shoulders, she flew down\r\nthe stairs, right through the hall towards the front door.\r\n\r\nIt was as usual barred and bolted, for the indoor servants were not yet\r\nup; but her keen ears had detected the sound of voices and the pawing\r\nof a horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoof against the flag-stones.\r\n\r\nWith nervous, trembling fingers Marguerite undid the bolts one by one,\r\nbruising her hands, hurting her nails, for the locks were heavy and\r\nstiff. But she did not care; her whole frame shook with anxiety at the\r\nvery thought that she might be too late; that he might have gone\r\nwithout her seeing him and bidding him \xe2\x80\x9cGod-speed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last, she had turned the key and thrown open the door. Her ears had\r\nnot deceived her. A groom was standing close by holding a couple of\r\nhorses; one of these was Sultan, Sir Percy\xe2\x80\x99s favourite and swiftest\r\nhorse, saddled ready for a journey.\r\n\r\nThe next moment Sir Percy himself appeared round the further corner of\r\nthe house and came quickly towards the horses. He had changed his\r\ngorgeous ball costume, but was as usual irreproachably and richly\r\napparelled in a suit of fine cloth, with lace jabot and ruffles, high\r\ntop-boots, and riding breeches.\r\n\r\nMarguerite went forward a few steps. He looked up and saw her. A slight\r\nfrown appeared between his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going?\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly and feverishly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhither?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I have had the honour of informing your ladyship, urgent, most\r\nunexpected business calls me to the North this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in\r\nhis usual cold, drawly manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut . . . your guests to-morrow . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have prayed your ladyship to offer my humble excuses to His Royal\r\nHighness. You are such a perfect hostess, I do not think that I shall\r\nbe missed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you might have waited for your journey . . . until after\r\nour water-party . . .\xe2\x80\x9d she said, still speaking quickly and nervously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely the business is not so urgent . . . and you said nothing about\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy business, as I had the honour to tell you, Madame, is as unexpected\r\nas it is urgent. . . . May I therefore crave your permission to\r\ngo. . . . Can I do aught for you in town? . . . on my way back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo . . . no . . . thanks . . . nothing. . . . But you will be back\r\nsoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore the end of the week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was evidently trying to get away, whilst she was straining every\r\nnerve to keep him back for a moment or two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPercy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you not tell me why you go to-day? Surely I,\r\nas your wife, have the right to know. You have _not_ been called away\r\nto the North. I know it. There were no letters, no couriers from there\r\nbefore we left for the opera last night, and nothing was waiting for\r\nyou when we returned from the ball. . . . You are _not_ going to the\r\nNorth, I feel convinced. . . . There is some mystery . . . and . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, there is no mystery, Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, with a slight tone of\r\nimpatience. \xe2\x80\x9cMy business has to do with Armand . . . there! Now, have I\r\nyour leave to depart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Armand? . . . But you will run no danger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDanger? I? . . . Nay, Madame, your solicitude does me honour. As you\r\nsay, I have some influence; my intention is to exert it before it be\r\ntoo late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you allow me to thank you at least?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d he said coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no need for that. My life is\r\nat your service, and I am already more than repaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd mine will be at yours, Sir Percy, if you will but accept it, in\r\nexchange for what you do for Armand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as, impulsively, she\r\nstretched out both her hands to him. \xe2\x80\x9cThere! I will not detain you . .\r\n. my thoughts go with you . . . Farewell! . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow lovely she looked in this morning sunlight, with her ardent hair\r\nstreaming around her shoulders. He bowed very low and kissed her hand;\r\nshe felt the burning kiss and her heart thrilled with joy and hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will come back?\xe2\x80\x9d she said tenderly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery soon!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, looking longingly into her blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd . . . you will remember? . . .\xe2\x80\x9d she asked as her eyes, in response\r\nto his look, gave him an infinity of promise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will always remember, Madame, that you have honoured me by\r\ncommanding my services.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words were cold and formal, but they did not chill her this time.\r\nHer woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart had read his, beneath the impassive mask his pride\r\nstill forced him to wear.\r\n\r\nHe bowed to her again, then begged her leave to depart. She stood on\r\none side whilst he jumped on to Sultan\xe2\x80\x99s back, then, as he galloped out\r\nof the gates, she waved him a final \xe2\x80\x9cAdieu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA bend in the road soon hid him from view; his confidential groom had\r\nsome difficulty in keeping pace with him, for Sultan flew along in\r\nresponse to his master\xe2\x80\x99s excited mood. Marguerite, with a sigh that was\r\nalmost a happy one, turned and went within. She went back to her room,\r\nfor suddenly, like a tired child, she felt quite sleepy.\r\n\r\nHer heart seemed all at once to be in complete peace, and, though it\r\nstill ached with undefined longing, a vague and delicious hope soothed\r\nit as with a balm.\r\n\r\nShe felt no longer anxious about Armand. The man who had just ridden\r\naway, bent on helping her brother, inspired her with complete\r\nconfidence in his strength and in his power. She marvelled at herself\r\nfor having ever looked upon him as an inane fool; of course, _that_ was\r\na mask worn to hide the bitter wound she had dealt to his faith and to\r\nhis love. His passion would have overmastered him, and he would not let\r\nher see how much he still cared and how deeply he suffered.\r\n\r\nBut now all would be well: she would crush her own pride, humble it\r\nbefore him, tell him everything, trust him in everything; and those\r\nhappy days would come back, when they used to wander off together in\r\nthe forests of Fontainebleau, when they spoke little\xe2\x80\x94for he was always\r\na silent man\xe2\x80\x94but when she felt that against that strong heart she would\r\nalways find rest and happiness.\r\n\r\nThe more she thought of the events of the past night, the less fear had\r\nshe of Chauvelin and his schemes. He had failed to discover the\r\nidentity of the Scarlet Pimpernel, of that she felt sure. Both Lord\r\nFancourt and Chauvelin himself had assured her that no one had been in\r\nthe dining-room at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock except the Frenchman himself and\r\nPercy\xe2\x80\x94Yes!\xe2\x80\x94Percy! she might have asked him, had she thought of it!\r\nAnyway, she had no fears that the unknown and brave hero would fall in\r\nChauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s trap; his death at any rate would not be at her door.\r\n\r\nArmand certainly was still in danger, but Percy had pledged his word\r\nthat Armand would be safe, and somehow, as Marguerite had seen him\r\nriding away, the possibility that he could fail in whatever he\r\nundertook never even remotely crossed her mind. When Armand was safely\r\nover in England she would not allow him to go back to France.\r\n\r\nShe felt almost happy now, and, drawing the curtains closely together\r\nagain to shut out the piercing sun, she went to bed at last, laid her\r\nhead upon the pillow, and, like a wearied child, soon fell into a\r\npeaceful and dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nTHE MYSTERIOUS DEVICE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day was well advanced when Marguerite woke, refreshed by her long\r\nsleep. Louise had brought her some fresh milk and a dish of fruit, and\r\nshe partook of this frugal breakfast with hearty appetite.\r\n\r\nThoughts crowded thick and fast in her mind as she munched her grapes;\r\nmost of them went galloping away after the tall, erect figure of her\r\nhusband, whom she had watched riding out of sight more than five hours\r\nago.\r\n\r\nIn answer to her eager inquiries, Louise brought back the news that the\r\ngroom had come home with Sultan, having left Sir Percy in London. The\r\ngroom thought that his master was about to get on board his schooner,\r\nwhich was lying off just below London Bridge. Sir Percy had ridden thus\r\nfar, had then met Briggs, the skipper of the _Day Dream_, and had sent\r\nthe groom back to Richmond with Sultan and the empty saddle.\r\n\r\nThis news puzzled Marguerite more than ever. Where could Sir Percy be\r\ngoing just now in the _Day Dream_? On Armand\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, he had said.\r\nWell! Sir Percy had influential friends everywhere. Perhaps he was\r\ngoing to Greenwich, or . . . but Marguerite ceased to conjecture; all\r\nwould be explained anon: he said that he would come back, and that he\r\nwould remember.\r\n A long, idle day lay before Marguerite. She was expecting the visit of\r\n her old school-fellow, little Suzanne de Tournay. With all the merry\r\n mischief at her command, she had tendered her request for Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n company to the Comtesse in the presence of the Prince of Wales last\r\n night. His Royal Highness had loudly applauded the notion, and\r\n declared that he would give himself the pleasure of calling on the two\r\n ladies in the course of the afternoon. The Comtesse had not dared to\r\n refuse, and then and there was entrapped into a promise to send little\r\n Suzanne to spend a long and happy day at Richmond with her friend.\r\n\r\nMarguerite expected her eagerly; she longed for a chat about old\r\nschooldays with the child; she felt that she would prefer Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany to that of anyone else, and together they would roam through\r\nthe fine old garden and rich deer park, or stroll along the river.\r\n\r\nBut Suzanne had not come yet, and Marguerite being dressed, prepared to\r\ngo downstairs. She looked quite a girl this morning in her simple\r\nmuslin frock, with a broad blue sash round her slim waist, and the\r\ndainty cross-over fichu into which, at her bosom, she had fastened a\r\nfew late crimson roses.\r\n\r\nShe crossed the landing outside her own suite of apartments, and stood\r\nstill for a moment at the head of the fine oak staircase, which led to\r\nthe lower floor. On her left were her husband\xe2\x80\x99s apartments, a suite of\r\nrooms which she practically never entered.\r\n\r\nThey consisted of bedroom, dressing and reception-room, and, at the\r\nextreme end of the landing, of a small study, which, when Sir Percy did\r\nnot use it, was always kept locked. His own special and confidential\r\nvalet, Frank, had charge of this room. No one was ever allowed to go\r\ninside. My lady had never cared to do so, and the other servants had,\r\nof course, not dared to break this hard-and-fast rule.\r\n\r\nMarguerite had often, with that good-natured contempt which she had\r\nrecently adopted towards her husband, chaffed him about this secrecy\r\nwhich surrounded his private study. Laughingly she had always declared\r\nthat he strictly excluded all prying eyes from his sanctum for fear\r\nthey should detect how very little \xe2\x80\x9cstudy\xe2\x80\x9d went on within its four\r\nwalls: a comfortable arm-chair for Sir Percy\xe2\x80\x99s sweet slumbers was, no\r\ndoubt, its most conspicuous piece of furniture.\r\n\r\nMarguerite thought of all this on this bright October morning as she\r\nglanced along the corridor. Frank was evidently busy with his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrooms, for most of the doors stood open, that of the study amongst the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nA sudden, burning, childish curiosity seized her to have a peep at Sir\r\nPercy\xe2\x80\x99s sanctum. The restriction, of course, did not apply to her, and\r\nFrank would, of course, not dare to oppose her. Still, she hoped that\r\nthe valet would be busy in one of the other rooms, that she might have\r\nthat one quick peep in secret, and unmolested.\r\n\r\nGently, on tip-toe, she crossed the landing and, like Blue Beard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife, trembling half with excitement and wonder, she paused a moment on\r\nthe threshold, strangely perturbed and irresolute.\r\n\r\nThe door was ajar, and she could not see anything within. She pushed it\r\nopen tentatively: there was no sound: Frank was evidently not there,\r\nand she walked boldly in.\r\n\r\nAt once she was struck by the severe simplicity of everything around\r\nher: the dark and heavy hangings, the massive oak furniture, the one or\r\ntwo maps on the wall, in no way recalled to her mind the lazy man about\r\ntown, the lover of race-courses, the dandified leader of fashion, that\r\nwas the outward representation of Sir Percy Blakeney.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign here, at any rate, of hurried departure. Everything\r\nwas in its place, not a scrap of paper littered the floor, not a\r\ncupboard or drawer was left open. The curtains were drawn aside, and\r\nthrough the open window the fresh morning air was streaming in.\r\n\r\nFacing the window, and well into the centre of the room, stood a\r\nponderous business-like desk, which looked as if it had seen much\r\nservice. On the wall to the left of the desk, reaching almost from\r\nfloor to ceiling, was a large full-length portrait of a woman,\r\nmagnificently framed, exquisitely painted, and signed with the name of\r\nBoucher. It was Percy\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\r\n\r\nMarguerite knew very little about her, except that she had died abroad,\r\nailing in body as well as in mind, when Percy was still a lad. She must\r\nhave been a very beautiful woman once, when Boucher painted her, and as\r\nMarguerite looked at the portrait, she could not but be struck by the\r\nextraordinary resemblance which must have existed between mother and\r\nson. There was the same low, square forehead, crowned with thick, fair\r\nhair, smooth and heavy; the same deep-set, somewhat lazy blue eyes\r\nbeneath firmly marked, straight brows; and in those eyes there was the\r\nsame intensity behind that apparent laziness, the same latent passion\r\nwhich used to light up Percy\xe2\x80\x99s face in the olden days before his\r\nmarriage, and which Marguerite had again noted, last night at dawn,\r\nwhen she had come quite close to him, and had allowed a note of\r\ntenderness to creep into her voice.\r\n\r\nMarguerite studied the portrait, for it interested her: after that she\r\nturned and looked again at the ponderous desk. It was covered with a\r\nmass of papers, all neatly tied and docketed, which looked like\r\naccounts and receipts arrayed with perfect method. It had never before\r\nstruck Marguerite\xe2\x80\x94nor had she, alas! found it worth while to inquire\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nto how Sir Percy, whom all the world had credited with a total lack of\r\nbrains, administered the vast fortune which his father had left him.\r\n\r\nSince she had entered this neat, orderly room, she had been taken so\r\nmuch by surprise, that this obvious proof of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s strong\r\nbusiness capacities did not cause her more than a passing thought of\r\nwonder. But it also strengthened her in the now certain knowledge that,\r\nwith his worldly inanities, his foppish ways, and foolish talk, he was\r\nnot only wearing a mask, but was playing a deliberate and studied part.\r\n\r\nMarguerite wondered again. Why should he take all this trouble? Why\r\nshould he\xe2\x80\x94who was obviously a serious, earnest man\xe2\x80\x94wish to appear\r\nbefore his fellow-men as an empty-headed nincompoop?\r\n\r\nHe may have wished to hide his love for a wife who held him in contempt\r\n. . . but surely such an object could have been gained at less\r\nsacrifice, and with far less trouble than constant incessant acting of\r\nan unnatural part.\r\n\r\nShe looked round her quite aimlessly now: she was horribly puzzled, and\r\na nameless dread, before all this strange, unaccountable mystery, had\r\nbegun to seize upon her. She felt cold and uncomfortable suddenly in\r\nthis severe and dark room. There were no pictures on the wall, save the\r\nfine Boucher portrait, only a couple of maps, both of parts of France,\r\none of the North coast and the other of the environs of Paris. What did\r\nSir Percy want with those, she wondered.\r\n\r\nHer head began to ache, she turned away from this strange Blue Beard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchamber, which she had entered, and which she did not understand. She\r\ndid not wish Frank to find her here, and with a last look round, she\r\nonce more turned to the door. As she did so, her foot knocked against a\r\nsmall object, which had apparently been lying close to the desk, on the\r\ncarpet, and which now went rolling, right across the room.\r\n\r\nShe stooped to pick it up. It was a solid gold ring, with a flat\r\nshield, on which was engraved a small device.\r\n\r\nMarguerite turned it over in her fingers, and then studied the\r\nengraving on the shield. It represented a small star-shaped flower, of\r\na shape she had seen so distinctly twice before: once at the opera, and\r\nonce at Lord Grenville\xe2\x80\x99s ball.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nTHE SCARLET PIMPERNEL\r\n\r\n\r\nAt what particular moment the strange doubt first crept into\r\nMarguerite\xe2\x80\x99s mind, she could not herself afterwards have said. With the\r\nring tightly clutched in her hand, she had run out of the room, down\r\nthe stairs, and out into the garden, where, in complete seclusion,\r\nalone with the flowers, and the river and the birds, she could look\r\nagain at the ring, and study that device more closely.\r\n\r\nStupidly, senselessly, now, sitting beneath the shade of an overhanging\r\nsycamore, she was looking at the plain gold shield, with the\r\nstar-shaped little flower engraved upon it.\r\n\r\nBah! It was ridiculous! she was dreaming! her nerves were overwrought,\r\nand she saw signs and mysteries in the most trivial coincidences. Had\r\nnot everybody about town recently made a point of affecting the device\r\nof that mysterious and heroic Scarlet Pimpernel?\r\n\r\nDid she not herself wear it embroidered on her gowns? set in gems and\r\nenamel in her hair? What was there strange in the fact that Sir Percy\r\nshould have chosen to use the device as a seal-ring? He might easily\r\nhave done that . . . yes . . . quite easily . . . and . . . besides . .\r\n. what connection could there be between her exquisite dandy of a\r\nhusband, with his fine clothes and refined, lazy ways, and the daring\r\nplotter who rescued French victims from beneath the very eyes of the\r\nleaders of a bloodthirsty revolution?\r\n\r\nHer thoughts were in a whirl\xe2\x80\x94her mind a blank . . . She did not see\r\nanything that was going on around her, and was quite startled when a\r\nfresh young voice called to her across the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ch\xc3\xa9rie!\xe2\x80\x94ch\xc3\xa9rie!_ where are you?\xe2\x80\x9d and little Suzanne, fresh as a\r\nrosebud, with eyes dancing with glee, and brown curls fluttering in the\r\nsoft morning breeze, came running across the lawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey told me you were in the garden,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on prattling merrily,\r\nand throwing herself with pretty, girlish impulse into Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narms, \xe2\x80\x9cso I ran out to give you a surprise. You did not expect me quite\r\nso soon, did you, my darling little Margot _ch\xc3\xa9rie_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite, who had hastily concealed the ring in the folds of her\r\nkerchief, tried to respond gaily and unconcernedly to the young girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpulsiveness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, sweet one,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cit is delightful to have\r\nyou all to myself, and for a nice whole long day. . . . You won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nbored?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! bored! Margot, how _can_ you say such a wicked thing. Why! when we\r\nwere in the dear old convent together, we were always happy when we\r\nwere allowed to be alone together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to talk secrets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two young girls had linked their arms in one another\xe2\x80\x99s and began\r\nwandering round the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! how lovely your home is, Margot, darling,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Suzanne,\r\nenthusiastically, \xe2\x80\x9cand how happy you must be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, indeed! I ought to be happy\xe2\x80\x94oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t I, sweet one?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMarguerite, with a wistful little sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow sadly you say it, _ch\xc3\xa9rie_. . . . Ah, well, I suppose now that you\r\nare a married woman you won\xe2\x80\x99t care to talk secrets with me any longer.\r\nOh! what lots and lots of secrets we used to have at school! Do you\r\nremember?\xe2\x80\x94some we did not even confide to Sister Theresa of the Holy\r\nAngels\xe2\x80\x94though she was such a dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you have one all-important secret, eh, little one?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMarguerite, merrily, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich you are forthwith going to confide to me.\r\nNay, you need not blush, _ch\xc3\xa9rie_,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, as she saw Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npretty little face crimson with blushes. \xe2\x80\x9cFaith, there\xe2\x80\x99s naught to be\r\nashamed of! He is a noble and true man, and one to be proud of as a\r\nlover, and . . . as a husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, _ch\xc3\xa9rie_, I am not ashamed,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Suzanne, softly; \xe2\x80\x9cand it\r\nmakes me very, very proud to hear you speak so well of him. I think\r\nmaman will consent,\xe2\x80\x9d she added thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cand I shall be\xe2\x80\x94oh! so\r\nhappy\xe2\x80\x94but, of course, nothing is to be thought of until papa is safe. .\r\n. .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite started. Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s father! the Comte de Tournay!\xe2\x80\x94one of\r\nthose whose life would be jeopardised if Chauvelin succeeded in\r\nestablishing the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel.\r\n\r\nShe had understood all along from the Comtesse, and also from one or\r\ntwo of the members of the league, that their mysterious leader had\r\npledged his honour to bring the fugitive Comte de Tournay safely out of\r\nFrance. Whilst little Suzanne\xe2\x80\x94unconscious of all\xe2\x80\x94save her own\r\nall-important little secret, went prattling on, Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts\r\nwent back to the events of the past night.\r\n\r\nArmand\xe2\x80\x99s peril, Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s threat, his cruel \xe2\x80\x9cEither\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d which she\r\nhad accepted.\r\n\r\nAnd then her own work in the matter, which should have culminated at\r\none o\xe2\x80\x99clock in Lord Grenville\xe2\x80\x99s dining-room, when the relentless agent\r\nof the French Government would finally learn who was this mysterious\r\nScarlet Pimpernel, who so openly defied an army of spies and placed\r\nhimself so boldly, and for mere sport, on the side of the enemies of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nSince then she had heard nothing from Chauvelin. She had concluded that\r\nhe had failed, and yet, she had not felt anxious about Armand, because\r\nher husband had promised her that Armand would be safe.\r\n\r\nBut now, suddenly, as Suzanne prattled merrily along, an awful horror\r\ncame upon her for what she had done. Chauvelin had told her nothing, it\r\nwas true; but she remembered how sarcastic and evil he looked when she\r\ntook final leave of him after the ball. Had he discovered something\r\nthen? Had he already laid his plans for catching the daring plotter,\r\nred-handed, in France, and sending him to the guillotine without\r\ncompunction or delay?\r\n\r\nMarguerite turned sick with horror, and her hand convulsively clutched\r\nthe ring in her dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not listening, _ch\xc3\xa9rie_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Suzanne, reproachfully, as she\r\npaused in her long, highly interesting narrative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, darling\xe2\x80\x94indeed I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite with an effort,\r\nforcing herself to smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI love to hear you talking . . . and your\r\nhappiness makes me so very glad. . . . Have no fear, we will manage to\r\npropitiate maman. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes is a noble English gentleman; he\r\nhas money and position, the Comtesse will not refuse her consent. . . .\r\nBut . . . now, little one . . . tell me . . . what is the latest news\r\nabout your father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Suzanne, with mad glee, \xe2\x80\x9cthe best we could possibly hear. My\r\nLord Hastings came to see maman early this morning. He said that all is\r\nnow well with dear papa, and we may safely expect him here in England\r\nin less than four days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite, whose glowing eyes were fastened on Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlips, as she continued merrily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we have no fear now! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know, _ch\xc3\xa9rie_, that that great and\r\nnoble Scarlet Pimpernel himself has gone to save papa. He has gone,\r\n_ch\xc3\xa9rie_ . . . actually gone . . .\xe2\x80\x9d added Suzanne excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was in\r\nLondon this morning; he will be in Calais, perhaps, to-morrow . . .\r\nwhere he will meet papa . . . and then . . . and then . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blow had fallen. She had expected it all along, though she had\r\ntried for the last half-hour to delude herself and to cheat her fears.\r\nHe had gone to Calais, had been in London this morning . . . he . . .\r\nthe Scarlet Pimpernel . . . Percy Blakeney . . . her husband . . . whom\r\nshe had betrayed last night to Chauvelin. . . .\r\n\r\nPercy . . . Percy . . . her husband . . . the Scarlet Pimpernel. . . .\r\nOh! how could she have been so blind? She understood it now\xe2\x80\x94all at once\r\n. . . that part he played\xe2\x80\x94the mask he wore . . . in order to throw dust\r\nin everybody\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd all for sheer sport and devilry of course!\xe2\x80\x94saving men, women and\r\nchildren from death, as other men destroy and kill animals for the\r\nexcitement, the love of the thing. The idle, rich man wanted some aim\r\nin life\xe2\x80\x94he, and the few young bucks he enrolled under his banner, had\r\namused themselves for months in risking their lives for the sake of an\r\ninnocent few.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he had meant to tell her when they were first married; and then\r\nthe story of the Marquis de St. Cyr had come to his ears, and he had\r\nsuddenly turned from her, thinking, no doubt, that she might some day\r\nbetray him and his comrades, who had sworn to follow him; and so he had\r\ntricked her, as he tricked all others, whilst hundreds now owed their\r\nlives to him, and many families owed him both life and happiness.\r\n\r\nThe mask of the inane fop had been a good one, and the part\r\nconsummately well played. No wonder that Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s spies had failed\r\nto detect, in the apparently brainless nincompoop, the man whose\r\nreckless daring and resourceful ingenuity had baffled the keenest\r\nFrench spies, both in France and in England. Even last night when\r\nChauvelin went to Lord Grenville\xe2\x80\x99s dining-room to seek that daring\r\nScarlet Pimpernel, he only saw that inane Sir Percy Blakeney fast\r\nasleep in a corner of the sofa.\r\n\r\nHad his astute mind guessed the secret, then? Here lay the whole awful,\r\nhorrible, amazing puzzle. In betraying a nameless stranger to his fate\r\nin order to save her brother, had Marguerite Blakeney sent her husband\r\nto his death?\r\n\r\nNo! no! no! a thousand times no! Surely Fate could not deal a blow like\r\nthat: Nature itself would rise in revolt: her hand, when it held that\r\ntiny scrap of paper last night, would surely have been struck numb ere\r\nit committed a deed so appalling and so terrible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is it, _ch\xc3\xa9rie_?\xe2\x80\x9d said little Suzanne, now genuinely alarmed,\r\nfor Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s colour had become dull and ashen. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you ill,\r\nMarguerite? What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, nothing, child,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, as in a dream. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment\r\n. . . let me think . . . think! . . . You said . . . the Scarlet\r\nPimpernel had gone to-day. . . . ?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarguerite, _ch\xc3\xa9rie_, what is it? You frighten me. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing, child, I tell you . . . nothing. . . . I must be alone\r\na minute\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94dear one . . . I may have to curtail our time together\r\nto-day. . . . I may have to go away\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand that something has happened, _ch\xc3\xa9rie_, and that you want\r\nto be alone. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be a hindrance to you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think of me. My maid,\r\nLucile, has not yet gone . . . we will go back together . . . don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe threw her arms impulsively round Marguerite. Child as she was, she\r\nfelt the poignancy of her friend\xe2\x80\x99s grief, and with the infinite tact of\r\nher girlish tenderness, she did not try to pry into it, but was ready\r\nto efface herself.\r\n\r\nShe kissed Marguerite again and again, then walked sadly back across\r\nthe lawn. Marguerite did not move, she remained there, thinking . . .\r\nwondering what was to be done.\r\n\r\nJust as little Suzanne was about to mount the terrace steps, a groom\r\ncame running round the house towards his mistress. He carried a sealed\r\nletter in his hand. Suzanne instinctively turned back; her heart told\r\nher that here perhaps was further ill news for her friend, and she felt\r\nthat her poor Margot was not in a fit state to bear any more.\r\n\r\nThe groom stood respectfully beside his mistress, then he handed her\r\nthe sealed letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Marguerite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust come by runner, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite took the letter mechanically, and turned it over in her\r\ntrembling fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho sent it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe runner said, my lady,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the groom, \xe2\x80\x9cthat his orders were to\r\ndeliver this, and that your ladyship would understand from whom it\r\ncame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite tore open the envelope. Already her instinct had told her\r\nwhat it contained, and her eyes only glanced at it mechanically.\r\n\r\nIt was a letter written by Armand St. Just to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nletter which Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s spies had stolen at \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand which Chauvelin had held as a rod over her to enforce her\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nNow he had kept his word\xe2\x80\x94he had sent her back St. Just\xe2\x80\x99s compromising\r\nletter . . . for he was on the track of the Scarlet Pimpernel.\r\n\r\nMarguerite\xe2\x80\x99s senses reeled, her very soul seemed to be leaving her\r\nbody; she tottered, and would have fallen but for Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s arm round\r\nher waist. With superhuman effort she regained control over\r\nherself\xe2\x80\x94there was yet much to be done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring that runner here to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the servant, with much\r\ncalm. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has not gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe groom went, and Marguerite turned to Suzanne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, child, run within. Tell Lucile to get ready. I fear I must\r\nsend you home, child. And\xe2\x80\x94stay, tell one of the maids to prepare a\r\ntravelling dress and cloak for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuzanne made no reply. She kissed Marguerite tenderly, and obeyed\r\nwithout a word; the child was overawed by the terrible, nameless misery\r\nin her friend\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\nA minute later the groom returned, followed by the runner who had\r\nbrought the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho gave you this packet?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Marguerite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gentleman, my lady,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man, \xe2\x80\x9cat \xe2\x80\x98The Rose and Thistle\xe2\x80\x99 inn\r\nopposite Charing Cross. He said you would understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt \xe2\x80\x98The Rose and Thistle\xe2\x80\x99? What was he doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was waiting for the coach, your ladyship, which he had ordered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe coach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lady. A special coach he had ordered. I understood from his\r\nman that he was posting straight to Dover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s enough. You may go.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she turned to the groom: \xe2\x80\x9cMy coach\r\nand the four swiftest horses in the stables, to be ready at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe groom and runner both went quickly off to obey. Marguerite remained\r\nstanding for a moment on the lawn quite alone. Her graceful figure was\r\nas rigid as a statue, her eyes were fixed, her hands were tightly\r\nclasped across her breast; her lips moved as they murmured with\r\npathetic heart-breaking persistence,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s to be done? What\xe2\x80\x99s to be done? Where to find him?\xe2\x80\x94Oh, God!\r\ngrant me light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut this was not the moment for remorse and despair. She had\r\ndone\xe2\x80\x94unwittingly\xe2\x80\x94an awful and terrible thing\xe2\x80\x94the very worst crime, in\r\nher eyes, that woman ever committed\xe2\x80\x94she saw it in all its horror. Her\r\nvery blindness in not having guessed her husband\xe2\x80\x99s secret seemed now to\r\nher another deadly sin. She ought to have known! she ought to have\r\nknown!\r\n\r\nHow could she imagine that a man who could love with so much intensity\r\nas Percy Blakeney had loved her from the first\xe2\x80\x94how could such a man be\r\nthe brainless idiot he chose to appear? She, at least, ought to have\r\nknown that he was wearing a mask, and having found that out, she should\r\nhave torn it from his face, whenever they were alone together.\r\n\r\nHer love for him had been paltry and weak, easily crushed by her own\r\npride; and she, too, had worn a mask in assuming a contempt for him,\r\nwhilst, as a matter of fact, she completely misunderstood him.\r\n\r\nBut there was no time now to go over the past. By her own blindness she\r\nhad sinned; now she must repay, not by empty remorse, but by prompt and\r\nuseful action.\r\n\r\nPercy had started for Calais, utterly unconscious of the fact that his\r\nmost relentless enemy was on his heels. He had set sail early that\r\nmorning from London Bridge. Provided he had a favourable wind, he would\r\nno doubt be in France within twenty-four hours; no doubt he had\r\nreckoned on the wind and chosen this route.\r\n\r\nChauvelin, on the other hand, would post to Dover, charter a vessel\r\nthere, and undoubtedly reach Calais much about the same time. Once in\r\nCalais, Percy would meet all those who were eagerly waiting for the\r\nnoble and brave Scarlet Pimpernel, who had come to rescue them from\r\nhorrible and unmerited death. With Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s eyes now fixed upon his\r\nevery movement, Percy would thus not only be endangering his own life,\r\nbut that of Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s father, the old Comte de Tournay, and of those\r\nother fugitives who were waiting for him and trusting in him. There was\r\nalso Armand, who had gone to meet de Tournay, secure in the knowledge\r\nthat the Scarlet Pimpernel was watching over his safety.\r\n\r\nAll these lives, and that of her husband, lay in Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s hands;\r\nthese she must save, if human pluck and ingenuity were equal to the\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, she could not do all this quite alone. Once in Calais\r\nshe would not know where to find her husband, whilst Chauvelin, in\r\nstealing the papers at Dover, had obtained the whole itinerary. Above\r\neverything, she wished to warn Percy.\r\n\r\nShe knew enough about him by now to understand that he would never\r\nabandon those who trusted in him, that he would not turn back from\r\ndanger, and leave the Comte de Tournay to fall into the bloodthirsty\r\nhands that knew of no mercy. But if he were warned, he might form new\r\nplans, be more wary, more prudent. Unconsciously, he might fall into a\r\ncunning trap, but\xe2\x80\x94once warned\xe2\x80\x94he might yet succeed.\r\n\r\nAnd if he failed\xe2\x80\x94if indeed Fate, and Chauvelin, with all the resources\r\nat his command, proved too strong for the daring plotter after all\xe2\x80\x94then\r\nat least she would be there by his side, to comfort, love and cherish,\r\nto cheat death perhaps at the last by making it seem sweet, if they\r\ndied both together, locked in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms, with the supreme\r\nhappiness of knowing that passion had responded to passion, and that\r\nall misunderstandings were at an end.\r\n\r\nHer whole body stiffened as with a great and firm resolution. This she\r\nmeant to do, if God gave her wits and strength. Her eyes lost their\r\nfixed look; they glowed with inward fire at the thought of meeting him\r\nagain so soon, in the very midst of most deadly perils; they sparkled\r\nwith the joy of sharing these dangers with him\xe2\x80\x94of helping him\r\nperhaps\xe2\x80\x94of being with him at the last\xe2\x80\x94if she failed.\r\n\r\nThe childlike sweet face had become hard and set, the curved mouth was\r\nclosed tightly over her clenched teeth. She meant to do or die, with\r\nhim and for his sake. A frown, which spoke of an iron will and\r\nunbending resolution, appeared between the two straight brows; already\r\nher plans were formed. She would go and find Sir Andrew Ffoulkes first;\r\nhe was Percy\xe2\x80\x99s best friend, and Marguerite remembered with a thrill,\r\nwith what blind enthusiasm the young man always spoke of his mysterious\r\nleader.\r\n\r\nHe would help her where she needed help; her coach was ready. A change\r\nof raiment, and a farewell to little Suzanne, and she could be on her\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWithout haste, but without hesitation, she walked quietly into the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nTHE FRIEND\r\n\r\n\r\nLess than half an hour later, Marguerite, buried in thoughts, sat\r\ninside her coach, which was bearing her swiftly to London.\r\n\r\nShe had taken an affectionate farewell of little Suzanne, and seen the\r\nchild safely started with her maid, and in her own coach, back to town.\r\nShe had sent one courier with a respectful letter of excuse to His\r\nRoyal Highness, begging for a postponement of the august visit on\r\naccount of pressing and urgent business, and another on ahead to\r\nbespeak a fresh relay of horses at Faversham.\r\n\r\nThen she had changed her muslin frock for a dark travelling costume and\r\nmantle, had provided herself with money\xe2\x80\x94which her husband\xe2\x80\x99s lavishness\r\nalways placed fully at her disposal\xe2\x80\x94and had started on her way.\r\n\r\nShe did not attempt to delude herself with any vain and futile hopes;\r\nthe safety of her brother Armand was to have been conditional on the\r\nimminent capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel. As Chauvelin had sent her\r\nback Armand\xe2\x80\x99s compromising letter, there was no doubt that he was quite\r\nsatisfied in his own mind that Percy Blakeney was the man whose death\r\nhe had sworn to bring about.\r\n\r\nNo! there was no room for any fond delusions! Percy, the husband whom\r\nshe loved with all the ardour which her admiration for his bravery had\r\nkindled, was in immediate, deadly peril, through her hand. She had\r\nbetrayed him to his enemy\xe2\x80\x94unwittingly \xe2\x80\x99tis true\xe2\x80\x94but she _had_ betrayed\r\nhim, and if Chauvelin succeeded in trapping him, who so far was unaware\r\nof his danger, then his death would be at her door. His death! when\r\nwith her very heart\xe2\x80\x99s blood, she would have defended him and given\r\nwillingly her life for his.\r\n\r\nShe had ordered her coach to drive her to the \xe2\x80\x9cCrown\xe2\x80\x9d inn; once there,\r\nshe told her coachman to give the horses food and rest. Then she\r\nordered a chair, and had herself carried to the house in Pall Mall\r\nwhere Sir Andrew Ffoulkes lived.\r\n\r\nAmong all Percy\xe2\x80\x99s friends who were enrolled under his daring banner,\r\nshe felt that she would prefer to confide in Sir Andrew Ffoulkes. He\r\nhad always been her friend, and now his love for little Suzanne had\r\nbrought him closer to her still. Had he been away from home, gone on\r\nthe mad errand with Percy, perhaps, then she would have called on Lord\r\nHastings or Lord Tony\xe2\x80\x94for she wanted the help of one of these young\r\nmen, or she would be indeed powerless to save her husband.\r\n\r\nSir Andrew Ffoulkes, however, was at home, and his servant introduced\r\nher ladyship immediately. She went upstairs to the young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomfortable bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s chambers, and was shown into a small, though\r\nluxuriously furnished, dining-room. A moment or two later Sir Andrew\r\nhimself appeared.\r\n\r\nHe had evidently been much startled when he heard who his lady visitor\r\nwas, for he looked anxiously\xe2\x80\x94even suspiciously\xe2\x80\x94at Marguerite, whilst\r\nperforming the elaborate bows before her, which the rigid etiquette of\r\nthe time demanded.\r\n\r\nMarguerite had laid aside every vestige of nervousness; she was\r\nperfectly calm, and having returned the young man\xe2\x80\x99s elaborate salute,\r\nshe began very calmly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Andrew, I have no desire to waste valuable time in much talk. You\r\nmust take certain things I am going to tell you for granted. These will\r\nbe of no importance. What is important is that your leader and comrade,\r\nthe Scarlet Pimpernel . . . my husband . . . Percy Blakeney . . . is in\r\ndeadly peril.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHad she had the remotest doubt of the correctness of her deductions,\r\nshe would have had them confirmed now, for Sir Andrew, completely taken\r\nby surprise, had grown very pale, and was quite incapable of making the\r\nslightest attempt at clever parrying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter how I know this, Sir Andrew,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cthank\r\nGod that I do, and that perhaps it is not too late to save him.\r\nUnfortunately, I cannot do this quite alone, and therefore have come to\r\nyou for help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Blakeney,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, trying to recover himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI . .\r\n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you hear me first?\xe2\x80\x9d she interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is how the matter\r\nstands. When the agent of the French Government stole your papers that\r\nnight in Dover, he found amongst them certain plans, which you or your\r\nleader meant to carry out for the rescue of the Comte de Tournay and\r\nothers. The Scarlet Pimpernel\xe2\x80\x94Percy, my husband\xe2\x80\x94has gone on this errand\r\nhimself to-day. Chauvelin knows that the Scarlet Pimpernel and Percy\r\nBlakeney are one and the same person. He will follow him to Calais, and\r\nthere will lay hands on him. You know as well as I do the fate that\r\nawaits him at the hands of the Revolutionary Government of France. No\r\ninterference from England\xe2\x80\x94from King George himself\xe2\x80\x94would save him.\r\nRobespierre and his gang would see to it that the interference came too\r\nlate. But not only that, the much-trusted leader will also have been\r\nunconsciously the means of revealing the hiding-place of the Comte de\r\nTournay and of all those who, even now, are placing their hopes in\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had spoken quietly, dispassionately, and with firm, unbending\r\nresolution. Her purpose was to make that young man trust and help her,\r\nfor she could do nothing without him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, trying to gain time, to think what\r\nwas best to be done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye! but I think you do, Sir Andrew. You must know that I am speaking\r\nthe truth. Look these facts straight in the face. Percy has sailed for\r\nCalais, I presume for some lonely part of the coast, and Chauvelin is\r\non his track. _He_ has posted for Dover, and will cross the Channel\r\nprobably to-night. What do you think will happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPercy will arrive at his destination: unconscious of being followed he\r\nwill seek out de Tournay and the others\xe2\x80\x94among these is Armand St. Just,\r\nmy brother\xe2\x80\x94he will seek them out, one after another, probably, not\r\nknowing that the sharpest eyes in the world are watching his every\r\nmovement. When he has thus unconsciously betrayed those who blindly\r\ntrust in him, when nothing can be gained from him, and he is ready to\r\ncome back to England, with those whom he has gone so bravely to save,\r\nthe doors of the trap will close upon him, and he will be sent to end\r\nhis noble life upon the guillotine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill Sir Andrew was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not trust me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, God! cannot you see\r\nthat I am in deadly earnest? Man, man,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, while, with her tiny\r\nhands she seized the young man suddenly by the shoulders, forcing him\r\nto look straight at her, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me, do I look like that vilest thing on\r\nearth\xe2\x80\x94a woman who would betray her own husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid, Lady Blakeney,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man at last, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should\r\nattribute such evil motives to you, but . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what? . . . tell me. . . . Quick, man! . . . the very seconds are\r\nprecious!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked resolutely, and looking searchingly into\r\nher blue eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cwhose hand helped to guide M. Chauvelin to the\r\nknowledge which you say he possesses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cI own it\xe2\x80\x94I will not lie to you, for I wish\r\nyou to trust me absolutely. But I had no idea\xe2\x80\x94how _could_ I have?\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nthe identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel . . . and my brother\xe2\x80\x99s safety was\r\nto be my prize if I succeeded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn helping Chauvelin to track the Scarlet Pimpernel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no use telling you how he forced my hand. Armand is more than a\r\nbrother to me, and . . . and . . . how _could_ I guess? . . . But we\r\nwaste time, Sir Andrew . . . every second is precious . . . in the name\r\nof God! . . . my husband is in peril . . . your friend!\xe2\x80\x94your\r\ncomrade!\xe2\x80\x94Help me to save him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Andrew felt his position to be a very awkward one. The oath he had\r\ntaken before his leader and comrade was one of obedience and secrecy;\r\nand yet the beautiful woman, who was asking him to trust her, was\r\nundoubtedly in earnest; his friend and leader was equally undoubtedly\r\nin imminent danger and . . .\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Blakeney,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cGod knows you have perplexed me, so\r\nthat I do not know which way my duty lies. Tell me what you wish me to\r\ndo. There are nineteen of us ready to lay down our lives for the\r\nScarlet Pimpernel if he is in danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need for lives just now, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she said drily; \xe2\x80\x9cmy\r\nwits and four swift horses will serve the necessary purpose. But I must\r\nknow where to find him. See,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, while her eyes filled with\r\ntears, \xe2\x80\x9cI have humbled myself before you, I have owned my fault to you;\r\nshall I also confess my weakness?\xe2\x80\x94My husband and I have been estranged,\r\nbecause he did not trust me, and because I was too blind to understand.\r\nYou must confess that the bandage which he put over my eyes was a very\r\nthick one. Is it small wonder that I did not see through it? But last\r\nnight, after I led him unwittingly into such deadly peril, it suddenly\r\nfell from my eyes. If you will not help me, Sir Andrew, I would still\r\nstrive to save my husband. I would still exert every faculty I possess\r\nfor his sake; but I might be powerless, for I might arrive too late,\r\nand nothing would be left for you but lifelong remorse, and . . . and .\r\n. . for me, a broken heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Lady Blakeney,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, touched by the gentle\r\nearnestness of this exquisitely beautiful woman, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know that what\r\nyou propose doing is man\xe2\x80\x99s work?\xe2\x80\x94you cannot possibly journey to Calais\r\nalone. You would be running the greatest possible risks to yourself,\r\nand your chances of finding your husband now\xe2\x80\x94were I to direct you ever\r\nso carefully\xe2\x80\x94are infinitely remote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I hope there are risks!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured softly. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope there are\r\ndangers, too!\xe2\x80\x94I have so much to atone for. But I fear you are mistaken.\r\nChauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are fixed upon you all, he will scarce notice me.\r\nQuick, Sir Andrew!\xe2\x80\x94the coach is ready, and there is not a moment to be\r\nlost. . . . I _must_ get to him! I _must_!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated with almost\r\nsavage energy, \xe2\x80\x9cto warn him that that man is on his track. . . . Can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t you see, that I _must_ get to him . . . even . . . even\r\nif it be too late to save him . . . at least . . . to be by his side .\r\n. . at the last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, Madame, you must command me. Gladly would I or any of my\r\ncomrades lay down our lives for your husband. If you _will_ go yourself\r\n. . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, friend, do you not see that I would go mad if I let you go\r\nwithout me?\xe2\x80\x9d She stretched out her hand to him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _will_ trust me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI await your orders,\xe2\x80\x9d he said simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, then. My coach is ready to take me to Dover. Do you follow me,\r\nas swiftly as horses will take you. We meet at nightfall at \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nFisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest.\xe2\x80\x99 Chauvelin would avoid it, as he is known there, and\r\nI think it would be the safest. I will gladly accept your escort to\r\nCalais . . . as you say, I might miss Sir Percy were you to direct me\r\never so carefully. We\xe2\x80\x99ll charter a schooner at Dover and cross over\r\nduring the night. Disguised, if you will agree to it, as my lacquey,\r\nyou will, I think, escape detection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am entirely at your service, Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the young man\r\nearnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cI trust to God that you will sight the _Day Dream_ before\r\nwe reach Calais. With Chauvelin at his heels, every step the Scarlet\r\nPimpernel takes on French soil is fraught with danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod grant it, Sir Andrew. But now, farewell. We meet to-night at\r\nDover! It will be a race between Chauvelin and me across the Channel\r\nto-night\xe2\x80\x94and the prize\xe2\x80\x94the life of the Scarlet Pimpernel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kissed her hand, and then escorted her to her chair. A quarter of an\r\nhour later she was back at the \xe2\x80\x9cCrown\xe2\x80\x9d inn, where her coach and horses\r\nwere ready and waiting for her. The next moment they thundered along\r\nthe London streets, and then straight on to the Dover road at maddening\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nShe had no time for despair now. She was up and doing and had no\r\nleisure to think. With Sir Andrew Ffoulkes as her companion and ally,\r\nhope had once again revived in her heart.\r\n\r\nGod would be merciful. He would not allow so appalling a crime to be\r\ncommitted, as the death of a brave man, through the hand of a woman who\r\nloved him, and worshipped him, and who would gladly have died for his\r\nsake.\r\n\r\nMarguerite\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts flew back to him, the mysterious hero, whom she\r\nhad always unconsciously loved, when his identity was still unknown to\r\nher. Laughingly, in the olden days, she used to call him the shadowy\r\nking of her heart, and now she had suddenly found that this enigmatic\r\npersonality whom she had worshipped, and the man who loved her so\r\npassionately, were one and the same: what wonder that one or two\r\nhappier Visions began to force their way before her mind? She vaguely\r\nwondered what she would say to him when first they would stand face to\r\nface.\r\n\r\nShe had had so many anxieties, so much excitement during the past few\r\nhours, that she allowed herself the luxury of nursing these few more\r\nhopeful, brighter thoughts. Gradually the rumble of the coach wheels,\r\nwith its incessant monotony, acted soothingly on her nerves: her eyes,\r\naching with fatigue and many shed and unshed tears, closed\r\ninvoluntarily, and she fell into a troubled sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nSUSPENSE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was late into the night when she at last reached \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nRest.\xe2\x80\x9d She had done the whole journey in less than eight hours, thanks\r\nto innumerable changes of horses at the various coaching stations, for\r\nwhich she always paid lavishly, thus obtaining the very best and\r\nswiftest that could be had.\r\n\r\nHer coachman, too, had been indefatigable; the promise of special and\r\nrich reward had no doubt helped to keep him up, and he had literally\r\nburned the ground beneath his mistress\xe2\x80\x99 coach wheels.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Lady Blakeney in the middle of the night caused a\r\nconsiderable flutter at \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest.\xe2\x80\x9d Sally jumped hastily\r\nout of bed, and Mr. Jellyband was at great pains how to make his\r\nimportant guest comfortable.\r\n\r\nBoth these good folk were far too well drilled in the manners\r\nappertaining to innkeepers, to exhibit the slightest surprise at Lady\r\nBlakeney\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, alone, at this extraordinary hour. No doubt they\r\nthought all the more, but Marguerite was far too absorbed in the\r\nimportance\xe2\x80\x94the deadly earnestness\xe2\x80\x94of her journey, to stop and ponder\r\nover trifles of that sort.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-room\xe2\x80\x94the scene lately of the dastardly outrage on two\r\nEnglish gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94was quite deserted. Mr. Jellyband hastily relit the\r\nlamp, rekindled a cheerful bit of fire in the great hearth, and then\r\nwheeled a comfortable chair by it, into which Marguerite gratefully\r\nsank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill your ladyship stay the night?\xe2\x80\x9d asked pretty Miss Sally, who was\r\nalready busy laying a snow-white cloth on the table, preparatory to\r\nproviding a simple supper for her ladyship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! not the whole night,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Marguerite. \xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate, I shall\r\nnot want any room but this, if I can have it to myself for an hour or\r\ntwo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is at your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s service,\xe2\x80\x9d said honest Jellyband, whose\r\nrubicund face was set in its tightest folds, lest it should betray\r\nbefore \xe2\x80\x9cthe quality\xe2\x80\x9d that boundless astonishment which the worthy\r\nfellow had begun to feel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be crossing over at the first turn of the tide,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMarguerite, \xe2\x80\x9cand in the first schooner I can get. But my coachman and\r\nmen will stay the night, and probably several days longer, so I hope\r\nyou will make them comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lady; I\xe2\x80\x99ll look after them. Shall Sally bring your ladyship\r\nsome supper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, please. Put something cold on the table, and as soon as Sir\r\nAndrew Ffoulkes comes, show him in here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHonest Jellyband\xe2\x80\x99s face now expressed distress in spite of himself. He\r\nhad great regard for Sir Percy Blakeney, and did not like to see his\r\nlady running away with young Sir Andrew. Of course, it was no business\r\nof his, and Mr. Jellyband was no gossip. Still, in his heart, he\r\nrecollected that her ladyship was after all only one of them\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfurriners\xe2\x80\x9d; what wonder that she was immoral like the rest of them?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t sit up, honest Jellyband,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Marguerite, kindly, \xe2\x80\x9cnor\r\nyou either, Mistress Sally. Sir Andrew may be late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJellyband was only too willing that Sally should go to bed. He was\r\nbeginning not to like these goings-on at all. Still, Lady Blakeney\r\nwould pay handsomely for the accommodation, and it certainly was no\r\nbusiness of his.\r\n\r\nSally arranged a simple supper of cold meat, wine, and fruit on the\r\ntable, then with a respectful curtsey, she retired, wondering in her\r\nlittle mind why her ladyship looked so serious, when she was about to\r\nelope with her gallant.\r\n\r\nThen commenced a period of weary waiting for Marguerite. She knew that\r\nSir Andrew\xe2\x80\x94who would have to provide himself with clothes befitting a\r\nlacquey\xe2\x80\x94could not possibly reach Dover for at least a couple of hours.\r\nHe was a splendid horseman of course, and would make light in such an\r\nemergency of the seventy odd miles between London and Dover. He would,\r\ntoo, literally burn the ground beneath his horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoofs, but he might\r\nnot always get very good remounts, and in any case, he could not have\r\nstarted from London until at least an hour after she did.\r\n\r\nShe had seen nothing of Chauvelin on the road. Her coachman, whom she\r\nquestioned, had not seen anyone answering the description his mistress\r\ngave him of the wizened figure of the little Frenchman.\r\n\r\nEvidently, therefore, he had been ahead of her all the time. She had\r\nnot dared to question the people at the various inns, where they had\r\nstopped to change horses. She feared that Chauvelin had spies all along\r\nthe route, who might overhear her questions, then outdistance her and\r\nwarn her enemy of her approach.\r\n\r\nNow she wondered at what inn he might be stopping, or whether he had\r\nhad the good luck of chartering a vessel already, and was now himself\r\non the way to France. That thought gripped her at the heart as with an\r\niron vice. If indeed she should be too late already!\r\n\r\nThe loneliness of the room overwhelmed her; everything within was so\r\nhorribly still; the ticking of the grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s clock\xe2\x80\x94dreadfully slow\r\nand measured\xe2\x80\x94was the only sound which broke this awful loneliness.\r\n\r\nMarguerite had need of all her energy, all her steadfastness of\r\npurpose, to keep up her courage through this weary midnight waiting.\r\n\r\nEveryone else in the house but herself must have been asleep. She had\r\nheard Sally go upstairs. Mr. Jellyband had gone to see to her coachman\r\nand men, and then had returned and taken up a position under the porch\r\noutside, just where Marguerite had first met Chauvelin about a week\r\nago. He evidently meant to wait up for Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, but was\r\nsoon overcome by sweet slumbers, for presently\xe2\x80\x94in addition to the slow\r\nticking of the clock\xe2\x80\x94Marguerite could hear the monotonous and dulcet\r\ntones of the worthy fellow\xe2\x80\x99s breathing.\r\n\r\nFor some time now, she had realised that the beautiful warm October\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nday, so happily begun, had turned into a rough and cold night. She had\r\nfelt very chilly, and was glad of the cheerful blaze in the hearth: but\r\ngradually, as time wore on, the weather became more rough, and the\r\nsound of the great breakers against the Admiralty Pier, though some\r\ndistance from the inn, came to her as the noise of muffled thunder.\r\n\r\nThe wind was becoming boisterous, rattling the leaded windows and the\r\nmassive doors of the old-fashioned house: it shook the trees outside\r\nand roared down the vast chimney. Marguerite wondered if the wind would\r\nbe favourable for her journey. She had no fear of the storm, and would\r\nhave braved worse risks sooner than delay the crossing by an hour.\r\n\r\nA sudden commotion outside roused her from her meditations. Evidently\r\nit was Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, just arrived in mad haste, for she heard\r\nhis horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoofs thundering on the flag-stones outside, then Mr.\r\nJellyband\xe2\x80\x99s sleepy, yet cheerful tones bidding him welcome.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, then, the awkwardness of her position struck Marguerite;\r\nalone at this hour, in a place where she was well known, and having\r\nmade an assignation with a young cavalier equally well known, and who\r\narrives in disguise! What food for gossip to those mischievously\r\ninclined.\r\n\r\nThe idea struck Marguerite chiefly from its humorous side: there was\r\nsuch quaint contrast between the seriousness of her errand, and the\r\nconstruction which would naturally be put on her actions by honest Mr.\r\nJellyband, that, for the first time since many hours, a little smile\r\nbegan playing round the corners of her childlike mouth, and when,\r\npresently, Sir Andrew, almost unrecognisable in his lacquey-like garb,\r\nentered the coffee-room, she was able to greet him with quite a merry\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith! Monsieur, my lacquey,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am satisfied with your\r\nappearance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Jellyband had followed Sir Andrew, looking strangely perplexed. The\r\nyoung gallant\xe2\x80\x99s disguise had confirmed his worst suspicions. Without a\r\nsmile upon his jovial face, he drew the cork from the bottle of wine,\r\nset the chairs ready, and prepared to wait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, honest friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite, who was still smiling at the\r\nthought of what the worthy fellow must be thinking at that very moment,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe shall require nothing more; and here\xe2\x80\x99s for all the trouble you have\r\nbeen put to on our account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe handed two or three gold pieces to Jellyband, who took them\r\nrespectfully, and with becoming gratitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay, Lady Blakeney,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Sir Andrew, as Jellyband was about to\r\nretire, \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid we shall require something more of my friend\r\nJelly\xe2\x80\x99s hospitality. I am sorry to say we cannot cross over to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot cross over to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated in amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we must, Sir\r\nAndrew, we must! There can be no question of cannot, and whatever it\r\nmay cost, we must get a vessel to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the young man shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid it is not a question of cost, Lady Blakeney. There is a\r\nnasty storm blowing from France, the wind is dead against us, we cannot\r\npossibly sail until it has changed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite became deadly pale. She had not foreseen this. Nature\r\nherself was playing her a horrible, cruel trick. Percy was in danger,\r\nand she could not go to him, because the wind happened to blow from the\r\ncoast of France.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we must go!\xe2\x80\x94we must!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated with strange, persistent\r\nenergy, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know, we must go!\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t you find a way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been down to the shore already,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand had a talk to\r\none or two skippers. It is quite impossible to set sail to-night, so\r\nevery sailor assured me. No one,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, looking significantly at\r\nMarguerite, \xe2\x80\x9c_no one_ could possibly put out of Dover to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite at once understood what he meant. _No one_ included\r\nChauvelin as well as herself. She nodded pleasantly to Jellyband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I must resign myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you a room\r\nfor me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, your ladyship. A nice, bright, airy room. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see to it at\r\nonce. . . . And there is another one for Sir Andrew\xe2\x80\x94both quite ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s brave now, mine honest Jelly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Andrew, gaily, and\r\nclapping his worthy host vigorously on the back. \xe2\x80\x9cYou unlock both those\r\nrooms, and leave our candles here on the dresser. I vow you are dead\r\nwith sleep, and her ladyship must have some supper before she retires.\r\nThere, have no fear, friend of the rueful countenance, her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvisit, though at this unusual hour, is a great honour to thy house, and\r\nSir Percy Blakeney will reward thee doubly, if thou seest well to her\r\nprivacy and comfort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Andrew had no doubt guessed the many conflicting doubts and fears\r\nwhich raged in honest Jellyband\xe2\x80\x99s head; and, as he was a gallant\r\ngentleman, he tried by this brave hint to allay some of the worthy\r\ninnkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions. He had the satisfaction of seeing that he had\r\npartially succeeded. Jellyband\xe2\x80\x99s rubicund countenance brightened\r\nsomewhat, at mention of Sir Percy\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see to it at once, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with alacrity, and with\r\nless frigidity in his manner. \xe2\x80\x9cHas her ladyship everything she wants\r\nfor supper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything, thanks, honest friend, and as I am famished and dead with\r\nfatigue, I pray you see to the rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said eagerly, as soon as Jellyband had gone from the\r\nroom, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me all your news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing else much to tell you, Lady Blakeney,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nyoung man. \xe2\x80\x9cThe storm makes it quite impossible for any vessel to put\r\nout of Dover this tide. But, what seemed to you at first a terrible\r\ncalamity is really a blessing in disguise. If we cannot cross over to\r\nFrance to-night, Chauvelin is in the same quandary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may have left before the storm broke out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod grant he may,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Andrew, merrily, \xe2\x80\x9cfor very likely then\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll have been driven out of his course! Who knows? He may now even be\r\nlying at the bottom of the sea, for there is a furious storm raging,\r\nand it will fare ill with all small craft which happen to be out. But I\r\nfear me we cannot build our hopes upon the shipwreck of that cunning\r\ndevil, and of all his murderous plans. The sailors I spoke to, all\r\nassured me that no schooner had put out of Dover for several hours: on\r\nthe other hand, I ascertained that a stranger had arrived by coach this\r\nafternoon, and had, like myself, made some inquiries about crossing\r\nover to France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Chauvelin is still in Dover?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly. Shall I go waylay him and run my sword through him? That\r\nwere indeed the quickest way out of the difficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay! Sir Andrew, do not jest! Alas! I have often since last night\r\ncaught myself wishing for that fiend\xe2\x80\x99s death. But what you suggest is\r\nimpossible! The laws of this country do not permit of murder! It is\r\nonly in our beautiful France that wholesale slaughter is done lawfully,\r\nin the name of Liberty and of brotherly love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Andrew had persuaded her to sit down to the table, to partake of\r\nsome supper and to drink a little wine. This enforced rest of at least\r\ntwelve hours, until the next tide, was sure to be terribly difficult to\r\nbear in the state of intense excitement in which she was. Obedient in\r\nthese small matters like a child, Marguerite tried to eat and drink.\r\n\r\nSir Andrew, with that profound sympathy born in all those who are in\r\nlove, made her almost happy by talking to her about her husband. He\r\nrecounted to her some of the daring escapes the brave Scarlet Pimpernel\r\nhad contrived for the poor French fugitives, whom a relentless and\r\nbloody revolution was driving out of their country. He made her eyes\r\nglow with enthusiasm by telling her of his bravery, his ingenuity, his\r\nresourcefulness, when it meant snatching the lives of men, women, and\r\neven children from beneath the very edge of that murderous, ever-ready\r\nguillotine.\r\n\r\nHe even made her smile quite merrily by telling her of the Scarlet\r\nPimpernel\xe2\x80\x99s quaint and many disguises, through which he had baffled the\r\nstrictest watch set against him at the barricades of Paris. This last\r\ntime, the escape of the Comtesse de Tournay and her children had been a\r\nveritable masterpiece\xe2\x80\x94Blakeney disguised as a hideous old market-woman,\r\nin filthy cap and straggling grey locks, was a sight fit to make the\r\ngods laugh.\r\n\r\nMarguerite laughed heartily as Sir Andrew tried to describe Blakeney\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappearance, whose gravest difficulty always consisted in his great\r\nheight, which in France made disguise doubly difficult.\r\n\r\nThus an hour wore on. There were many more to spend in enforced\r\ninactivity in Dover. Marguerite rose from the table with an impatient\r\nsigh. She looked forward with dread to the night in the bed upstairs,\r\nwith terribly anxious thoughts to keep her company, and the howling of\r\nthe storm to help chase sleep away.\r\n\r\nShe wondered where Percy was now. The _Day Dream_ was a strong,\r\nwell-built, sea-going yacht. Sir Andrew had expressed the opinion that\r\nno doubt she had got in the lee of the wind before the storm broke out,\r\nor else perhaps had not ventured into the open at all, but was lying\r\nquietly at Gravesend.\r\n\r\nBriggs was an expert skipper, and Sir Percy handled a schooner as well\r\nas any master mariner. There was no danger for them from the storm.\r\n\r\nIt was long past midnight when at last Marguerite retired to rest. As\r\nshe had feared, sleep sedulously avoided her eyes. Her thoughts were of\r\nthe blackest during these long, weary hours, whilst that incessant\r\nstorm raged which was keeping her away from Percy. The sound of the\r\ndistant breakers made her heart ache with melancholy. She was in the\r\nmood when the sea has a saddening effect upon the nerves. It is only\r\nwhen we are very happy, that we can bear to gaze merrily upon the vast\r\nand limitless expanse of water, rolling on and on with such persistent,\r\nirritating monotony, to the accompaniment of our thoughts, whether\r\ngrave or gay. When they are gay, the waves echo their gaiety; but when\r\nthey are sad, then every breaker, as it rolls, seems to bring\r\nadditional sadness, and to speak to us of hopelessness and of the\r\npettiness of all our joys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nCALAIS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weariest nights, the longest days, sooner or later must perforce\r\ncome to an end.\r\n\r\nMarguerite had spent over fifteen hours in such acute mental torture as\r\nwell-nigh drove her crazy. After a sleepless night, she rose early,\r\nwild with excitement, dying to start on her journey, terrified lest\r\nfurther obstacles lay in her way. She rose before anyone else in the\r\nhouse was astir, so frightened was she, lest she should miss the one\r\ngolden opportunity of making a start.\r\n\r\nWhen she came downstairs, she found Sir Andrew Ffoulkes sitting in the\r\ncoffee-room. He had been out half an hour earlier, and had gone to the\r\nAdmiralty Pier, only to find that neither the French packet nor any\r\nprivately chartered vessel could put out of Dover yet. The storm was\r\nthen at its fullest, and the tide was on the turn. If the wind did not\r\nabate or change, they would perforce have to wait another ten or twelve\r\nhours until the next tide, before a start could be made. And the storm\r\nhad not abated, the wind had not changed, and the tide was rapidly\r\ndrawing out.\r\n\r\nMarguerite felt the sickness of despair when she heard this melancholy\r\nnews. Only the most firm resolution kept her from totally breaking\r\ndown, and thus adding to the young man\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety, which evidently had\r\nbecome very keen.\r\n\r\nThough he tried to disguise it, Marguerite could see that Sir Andrew\r\nwas just as anxious as she was to reach his comrade and friend. This\r\nenforced inactivity was terrible to them both.\r\n\r\nHow they spent that wearisome day at Dover, Marguerite could never\r\nafterwards say. She was in terror of showing herself, lest Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspies happened to be about, so she had a private sitting-room, and she\r\nand Sir Andrew sat there hour after hour, trying to take, at long\r\nintervals, some perfunctory meals, which little Sally would bring them,\r\nwith nothing to do but to think, to conjecture, and only occasionally\r\nto hope.\r\n\r\nThe storm had abated just too late; the tide was by then too far out to\r\nallow a vessel to put off to sea. The wind had changed, and was\r\nsettling down to a comfortable north-westerly breeze\xe2\x80\x94a veritable\r\ngodsend for a speedy passage across to France.\r\n\r\nAnd there those two waited, wondering if the hour would ever come when\r\nthey could finally make a start. There had been one happy interval in\r\nthis long weary day, and that was when Sir Andrew went down once again\r\nto the pier, and presently came back to tell Marguerite that he had\r\nchartered a quick schooner, whose skipper was ready to put to sea the\r\nmoment the tide was favourable.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the hours seemed less wearisome; there was less\r\nhopelessness in the waiting; and at last, at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nafternoon, Marguerite, closely veiled and followed by Sir Andrew\r\nFfoulkes, who, in the guise of her lacquey, was carrying a number of\r\nimpedimenta, found her way down to the pier.\r\n\r\nOnce on board, the keen, fresh sea-air revived her, the breeze was just\r\nstrong enough to nicely swell the sails of the _Foam Crest_, as she cut\r\nher way merrily towards the open.\r\n\r\nThe sunset was glorious after the storm, and Marguerite, as she watched\r\nthe white cliffs of Dover gradually disappearing from view, felt more\r\nat peace and once more almost hopeful.\r\n\r\nSir Andrew was full of kind attentions, and she felt how lucky she had\r\nbeen to have him by her side in this, her great trouble.\r\n\r\nGradually the grey coast of France began to emerge from the\r\nfast-gathering evening mists. One or two lights could be seen\r\nflickering, and the spires of several churches to rise out of the\r\nsurrounding haze.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later Marguerite had landed upon French shore. She was\r\nback in that country where at this very moment men slaughtered their\r\nfellow-creatures by the hundreds, and sent innocent women and children\r\nin thousands to the block.\r\n\r\nThe very aspect of the country and its people, even in this remote\r\nsea-coast town, spoke of that seething revolution, three hundred miles\r\naway, in beautiful Paris, now rendered hideous by the constant flow of\r\nthe blood of her noblest sons, by the wailing of the widows, and the\r\ncries of fatherless children.\r\n\r\nThe men all wore red caps\xe2\x80\x94in various stages of cleanliness\xe2\x80\x94but all with\r\nthe tricolour cockade pinned on the left-hand side. Marguerite noticed\r\nwith a shudder that, instead of the laughing, merry countenance\r\nhabitual to her own countrymen, their faces now invariably wore a look\r\nof sly distrust.\r\n\r\nEvery man nowadays was a spy upon his fellows: the most innocent word\r\nuttered in jest might at any time be brought up as a proof of\r\naristocratic tendencies, or of treachery against the people. Even the\r\nwomen went about with a curious look of fear and of hate lurking in\r\ntheir brown eyes; and all watched Marguerite as she stepped on shore,\r\nfollowed by Sir Andrew, and murmured as she passed along: \xe2\x80\x9c_Sacr\xc3\xa9s\r\naristos!_\xe2\x80\x9d or else \xe2\x80\x9c_Sacr\xc3\xa9s Anglais!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOtherwise their presence excited no further comment. Calais, even in\r\nthose days, was in constant business communication with England, and\r\nEnglish merchants were often to be seen on this coast. It was well\r\nknown that in view of the heavy duties in England, a vast deal of\r\nFrench wines and brandies were smuggled across. This pleased the French\r\n_bourgeois_ immensely; he liked to see the English Government and the\r\nEnglish king, both of whom he hated, cheated out of their revenues; and\r\nan English smuggler was always a welcome guest at the tumble-down\r\ntaverns of Calais and Boulogne.\r\n\r\nSo, perhaps, as Sir Andrew gradually directed Marguerite through the\r\ntortuous streets of Calais, many of the population, who turned with an\r\noath to look at the strangers clad in the English fashion, thought that\r\nthey were bent on purchasing dutiable articles for their own fog-ridden\r\ncountry, and gave them no more than a passing thought.\r\n\r\nMarguerite, however, wondered how her husband\xe2\x80\x99s tall, massive figure\r\ncould have passed through Calais unobserved: she marvelled what\r\ndisguise he assumed to do his noble work, without exciting too much\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nWithout exchanging more than a few words, Sir Andrew was leading her\r\nright across the town, to the other side from that where they had\r\nlanded, and on the way towards Cap Gris Nez. The streets were narrow,\r\ntortuous, and mostly evil-smelling, with a mixture of stale fish and\r\ndamp cellar odours. There had been heavy rain here during the storm\r\nlast night, and sometimes Marguerite sank ankle-deep in the mud, for\r\nthe roads were not lighted save by the occasional glimmer from a lamp\r\ninside a house.\r\n\r\nBut she did not heed any of these petty discomforts: \xe2\x80\x9cWe may meet\r\nBlakeney at the \xe2\x80\x98Chat Gris,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Sir Andrew had said, when they landed,\r\nand she was walking as if on a carpet of rose-leaves, for she was going\r\nto meet him almost at once.\r\n\r\nAt last they reached their destination. Sir Andrew evidently knew the\r\nroad, for he had walked unerringly in the dark, and had not asked his\r\nway from anyone. It was too dark then for Marguerite to notice the\r\noutside aspect of this house. The \xe2\x80\x9cChat Gris,\xe2\x80\x9d as Sir Andrew had called\r\nit, was evidently a small wayside inn on the outskirts of Calais, and\r\non the way to Gris Nez. It lay some little distance from the coast, for\r\nthe sound of the sea seemed to come from afar.\r\n\r\nSir Andrew knocked at the door with the knob of his cane, and from\r\nwithin Marguerite heard a sort of grunt and the muttering of a number\r\nof oaths. Sir Andrew knocked again, this time more peremptorily: more\r\noaths were heard, and then shuffling steps seemed to draw near the\r\ndoor. Presently this was thrown open, and Marguerite found herself on\r\nthe threshold of the most dilapidated, most squalid room she had ever\r\nseen in all her life.\r\n\r\nThe paper, such as it was, was hanging from the walls in strips; there\r\ndid not seem to be a single piece of furniture in the room that could,\r\nby the wildest stretch of imagination, be called \xe2\x80\x9cwhole.\xe2\x80\x9d Most of the\r\nchairs had broken backs, others had no seats to them, one corner of the\r\ntable was propped up with a bundle of faggots, there where the fourth\r\nleg had been broken.\r\n\r\nIn one corner of the room there was a huge hearth, over which hung a\r\nstock-pot, with a not altogether unpalatable odour of hot soup\r\nemanating therefrom. On one side of the room, high up in the wall,\r\nthere was a species of loft, before which hung a tattered\r\nblue-and-white checked curtain. A rickety set of steps led up to this\r\nloft.\r\n\r\nOn the great bare walls, with their colourless paper, all stained with\r\nvaried filth, there were chalked up at intervals in great bold\r\ncharacters, the words: \xe2\x80\x9cLibert\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x94Egalit\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x94Fraternit\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole of this sordid abode was dimly lighted by an evil-smelling\r\noil-lamp, which hung from the rickety rafters of the ceiling. It all\r\nlooked so horribly squalid, so dirty and uninviting, that Marguerite\r\nhardly dared to cross the threshold.\r\n\r\nSir Andrew, however, had stepped unhesitatingly forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnglish travellers, citoyen!\xe2\x80\x9d he said boldly, and speaking in French.\r\n\r\nThe individual who had come to the door in response to Sir Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknock, and who, presumably, was the owner of this squalid abode, was an\r\nelderly, heavily-built peasant, dressed in a dirty blue blouse, heavy\r\nsabots, from which wisps of straw protruded all round, shabby blue\r\ntrousers, and the inevitable red cap with the tricolour cockade, that\r\nproclaimed his momentary political views. He carried a short wooden\r\npipe, from which the odour of rank tobacco emanated. He looked with\r\nsome suspicion and a great deal of contempt at the two travellers,\r\nmuttered \xe2\x80\x9c_Sacrrr\xc3\xa9s Anglais!_\xe2\x80\x9d and spat upon the ground to further show\r\nhis independence of spirit, but, nevertheless, he stood aside to let\r\nthem enter, no doubt well aware that these same _sacrrr\xc3\xa9s Anglais_\r\nalways had well-filled purses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, lud!\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite, as she advanced into the room, holding her\r\nhandkerchief to her dainty nose, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a dreadful hole! Are you sure\r\nthis is the place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye! \xe2\x80\x99tis the place, sure enough,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young man as, with his\r\nlace-edged, fashionable handkerchief, he dusted a chair for Marguerite\r\nto sit on; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I vow I never saw a more villainous hole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking round with some curiosity and a great deal\r\nof horror at the dilapidated walls, the broken chairs, the rickety\r\ntable, \xe2\x80\x9cit certainly does not look inviting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlord of the \xe2\x80\x9cChat Gris\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94by name, Brogard\xe2\x80\x94had taken no further\r\nnotice of his guests; he concluded that presently they would order\r\nsupper, and in the meanwhile it was not for a free citizen to show\r\ndeference, or even courtesy, to anyone, however smartly they might be\r\ndressed.\r\n\r\nBy the hearth sat a huddled-up figure clad, seemingly, mostly in rags:\r\nthat figure was apparently a woman, although even that would have been\r\nhard to distinguish, except for the cap, which had once been white, and\r\nfor what looked like the semblance of a petticoat. She was sitting\r\nmumbling to herself, and from time to time stirring the brew in her\r\nstock-pot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Andrew at last, \xe2\x80\x9cwe should like some supper.\r\n. . . The citoyenne there,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, pointing to the huddled-up bundle\r\nof rags by the hearth, \xe2\x80\x9cis concocting some delicious soup, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwarrant, and my mistress has not tasted food for several hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt took Brogard some few moments to consider the question. A free\r\ncitizen does not respond too readily to the wishes of those who happen\r\nto require something of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Sacrrr\xc3\xa9s aristos!_\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, and once more spat upon the ground.\r\n\r\nThen he went very slowly up to a dresser which stood in a corner of the\r\nroom; from this he took an old pewter soup-tureen and slowly, and\r\nwithout a word, he handed it to his better-half, who, in the same\r\nsilence, began filling the tureen with the soup out of her stock-pot.\r\n\r\nMarguerite had watched all these preparations with absolute horror;\r\nwere it not for the earnestness of her purpose, she would incontinently\r\nhave fled from this abode of dirt and evil smells.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith! our host and hostess are not cheerful people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Andrew,\r\nseeing the look of horror on Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cI would I could offer\r\nyou a more hearty and more appetising meal . . . but I think you will\r\nfind the soup eatable and the wine good; these people wallow in dirt,\r\nbut live well as a rule.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay! I pray you, Sir Andrew,\xe2\x80\x9d she said gently, \xe2\x80\x9cbe not anxious about\r\nme. My mind is scarce inclined to dwell on thoughts of supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrogard was slowly pursuing his gruesome preparations; he had placed a\r\ncouple of spoons, also two glasses on the table, both of which Sir\r\nAndrew took the precaution of wiping carefully.\r\n\r\nBrogard had also produced a bottle of wine and some bread, and\r\nMarguerite made an effort to draw her chair to the table and to make\r\nsome pretence at eating. Sir Andrew, as befitting his _r\xc3\xb4le_ of\r\nlacquey, stood behind her chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Madame, I pray you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, seeing that Marguerite seemed quite\r\nunable to eat, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg of you to try and swallow some food\xe2\x80\x94remember you\r\nhave need of all your strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soup certainly was not bad; it smelt and tasted good. Marguerite\r\nmight have enjoyed it, but for the horrible surroundings. She broke the\r\nbread, however, and drank some of the wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, Sir Andrew,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not like to see you standing. You\r\nhave need of food just as much as I have. This creature will only think\r\nthat I am an eccentric Englishwoman eloping with her lacquey, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsit down and partake of this semblance of supper beside me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndeed, Brogard having placed what was strictly necessary upon the\r\ntable, seemed not to trouble himself any further about his guests. The\r\nMere Brogard had quietly shuffled out of the room, and the man stood\r\nand lounged about, smoking his evil-smelling pipe, sometimes under\r\nMarguerite\xe2\x80\x99s very nose, as any free-born citizen who was anybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nequal should do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound the brute!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Andrew, with native British wrath, as\r\nBrogard leant up against the table, smoking and looking down\r\nsuperciliously at these two _sacrrr\xc3\xa9s Anglais_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name, man,\xe2\x80\x9d admonished Marguerite, hurriedly, seeing that\r\nSir Andrew, with British-born instinct, was ominously clenching his\r\nfist, \xe2\x80\x9cremember that you are in France, and that in this year of grace\r\nthis is the temper of the people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to scrag the brute!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Sir Andrew, savagely.\r\n\r\nHe had taken Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s advice and sat next to her at table, and they\r\nwere both making noble efforts to deceive one another, by pretending to\r\neat and drink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pray you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite, \xe2\x80\x9ckeep the creature in a good temper, so\r\nthat he may answer the questions we must put to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best, but, begad! I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner scrag him than question him.\r\nHey! my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he said pleasantly in French, and tapping Brogard\r\nlightly on the shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you see many of our quality along these\r\nparts? Many English travellers, I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrogard looked round at him, over his near shoulder, puffed away at his\r\npipe for a moment or two as he was in no hurry, then muttered,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeu!\xe2\x80\x94sometimes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Andrew, carelessly, \xe2\x80\x9cEnglish travellers always know\r\nwhere they can get good wine, eh! my friend?\xe2\x80\x94Now, tell me, my lady was\r\ndesiring to know if by any chance you happen to have seen a great\r\nfriend of hers, an English gentleman, who often comes to Calais on\r\nbusiness; he is tall, and recently was on his way to Paris\xe2\x80\x94my lady\r\nhoped to have met him in Calais.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite tried not to look at Brogard, lest she should betray before\r\nhim the burning anxiety with which she waited for his reply. But a\r\nfree-born French citizen is never in any hurry to answer questions:\r\nBrogard took his time, then he said very slowly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTall Englishman?\xe2\x80\x94To-day!\xe2\x80\x94Yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sir Andrew, carelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Brogard, sullenly. Then he quietly took Sir\r\nAndrew\xe2\x80\x99s hat from a chair close by, put it on his own head, tugged at\r\nhis dirty blouse, and generally tried to express in pantomime that the\r\nindividual in question wore very fine clothes. \xe2\x80\x9c_Sacrr\xc3\xa9 aristo!_\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmuttered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat tall Englishman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite could scarce repress a scream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Sir Percy right enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cand not even in\r\ndisguise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled, in the midst of all her anxiety and through her gathering\r\ntears, at thought of \xe2\x80\x9cthe ruling passion strong in death\xe2\x80\x9d; of Percy\r\nrunning into the wildest, maddest dangers, with the latest-cut coat\r\nupon his back, and the laces of his jabot unruffled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the foolhardiness of it!\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cQuick, Sir Andrew! ask the\r\nman when he went.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Andrew, addressing Brogard, with the\r\nsame assumption of carelessness, \xe2\x80\x9cmy lord always wears beautiful\r\nclothes; the tall Englishman you saw, was certainly my lady\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\r\nAnd he has gone, you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went . . . yes . . . but he\xe2\x80\x99s coming back . . . here\xe2\x80\x94he ordered\r\nsupper . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Andrew put his hand with a quick gesture of warning upon\r\nMarguerite\xe2\x80\x99s arm; it came none too soon, for the next moment her wild,\r\nmad joy would have betrayed her. He was safe and well, was coming back\r\nhere presently, she would see him in a few moments perhaps. . . . Oh!\r\nthe wildness of her joy seemed almost more than she could bear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Brogard, who seemed suddenly to have been\r\ntransformed in her eyes into some heaven-born messenger of bliss.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x94did you say the English gentleman was coming back here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe heaven-born messenger of bliss spat upon the floor, to express his\r\ncontempt for all and sundry _aristos_, who chose to haunt the \xe2\x80\x9cChat\r\nGris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeu!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, \xe2\x80\x9che ordered supper\xe2\x80\x94he will come back. . . . _Sacrr\xc3\xa9\r\nAnglais!_\xe2\x80\x9d he added, by way of protest against all this fuss for a mere\r\nEnglishman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where is he now?\xe2\x80\x94Do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked eagerly, placing her\r\ndainty white hand upon the dirty sleeve of his blue blouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went to get a horse and cart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brogard, laconically, as, with\r\na surly gesture, he shook off from his arm that pretty hand which\r\nprinces had been proud to kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what time did he go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Brogard had evidently had enough of these questionings. He did not\r\nthink that it was fitting for a citizen\xe2\x80\x94who was the equal of anybody\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nbe thus catechised by these _sacrr\xc3\xa9s aristos_, even though they were\r\nrich English ones. It was distinctly more fitting to his new-born\r\ndignity to be as rude as possible; it was a sure sign of servility to\r\nmeekly reply to civil questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said surlily. \xe2\x80\x9cI have said enough, _voyons, les\r\naristos!_ . . . He came to-day. He ordered supper. He went out.\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncome back. _Voil\xc3\xa0!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with this parting assertion of his rights as a citizen and a free\r\nman, to be as rude as he well pleased, Brogard shuffled out of the\r\nroom, banging the door after him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nHOPE\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, Madame!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Andrew, seeing that Marguerite seemed\r\ndesirous to call her surly host back again, \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99d better leave\r\nhim alone. We shall not get anything more out of him, and we might\r\narouse his suspicions. One never knows what spies may be lurking around\r\nthese God-forsaken places.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat care I?\xe2\x80\x9d she replied lightly, \xe2\x80\x9cnow I know that my husband is\r\nsafe, and that I shall see him almost directly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d he said in genuine alarm, for she had talked quite loudly, in\r\nthe fulness of her glee, \xe2\x80\x9cthe very walls have ears in France, these\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose quickly from the table, and walked round the bare, squalid\r\nroom, listening attentively at the door, through which Brogard had just\r\ndisappeared, and whence only muttered oaths and shuffling footsteps\r\ncould be heard. He also ran up the rickety steps that led to the attic,\r\nto assure himself that there were no spies of Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s about the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we alone, Monsieur, my lacquey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite, gaily, as the\r\nyoung man once more sat down beside her. \xe2\x80\x9cMay we talk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs cautiously as possible!\xe2\x80\x9d he entreated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, man! but you wear a glum face! As for me, I could dance with\r\njoy! Surely there is no longer any cause for fear. Our boat is on the\r\nbeach, the _Foam Crest_ not two miles out at sea, and my husband will\r\nbe here, under this very roof, within the next half hour perhaps. Sure!\r\nthere is naught to hinder us. Chauvelin and his gang have not yet\r\narrived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, madam! that I fear we do not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was at Dover at the same time that we were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeld up by the same storm, which kept us from starting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. But\xe2\x80\x94I did not speak of it before, for I feared to alarm you\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nsaw him on the beach not five minutes before we embarked. At least, I\r\nswore to myself at the time that it was himself; he was disguised as a\r\n_cur\xc3\xa9_, so that Satan, his own guardian, would scarce have known him.\r\nBut I heard him then, bargaining for a vessel to take him swiftly to\r\nCalais; and he must have set sail less than an hour after we did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite\xe2\x80\x99s face had quickly lost its look of joy. The terrible danger\r\nin which Percy stood, now that he was actually on French soil, became\r\nsuddenly and horribly clear to her. Chauvelin was close upon his heels;\r\nhere in Calais, the astute diplomatist was all-powerful; a word from\r\nhim and Percy could be tracked and arrested and . . .\r\n\r\nEvery drop of blood seemed to freeze in her veins; not even during the\r\nmoments of her wildest anguish in England had she so completely\r\nrealised the imminence of the peril in which her husband stood.\r\nChauvelin had sworn to bring the Scarlet Pimpernel to the guillotine,\r\nand now the daring plotter, whose anonymity hitherto had been his\r\nsafeguard, stood revealed through her own hand, to his most bitter,\r\nmost relentless enemy.\r\n\r\nChauvelin\xe2\x80\x94when he waylaid Lord Tony and Sir Andrew Ffoulkes in the\r\ncoffee-room of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Rest\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94had obtained possession of all\r\nthe plans of this latest expedition. Armand St. Just, the Comte de\r\nTournay and other fugitive royalists were to have met the Scarlet\r\nPimpernel\xe2\x80\x94or rather, as it had been originally arranged, two of his\r\nemissaries\xe2\x80\x94on this day, the 2nd of October, at a place evidently known\r\nto the league, and vaguely alluded to as the \xe2\x80\x9cP\xc3\xa8re Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s hut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArmand, whose connection with the Scarlet Pimpernel and disavowal of\r\nthe brutal policy of the Reign of Terror was still unknown to his\r\ncountrymen, had left England a little more than a week ago, carrying\r\nwith him the necessary instructions, which would enable him to meet the\r\nother fugitives and to convey them to this place of safety.\r\n\r\nThis much Marguerite had fully understood from the first, and Sir\r\nAndrew Ffoulkes had confirmed her surmises. She knew, too, that when\r\nSir Percy realised that his own plans and his directions to his\r\nlieutenants had been stolen by Chauvelin, it was too late to\r\ncommunicate with Armand, or to send fresh instructions to the\r\nfugitives.\r\n\r\nThey would, of necessity, be at the appointed time and place, not\r\nknowing how grave was the danger which now awaited their brave rescuer.\r\n\r\nBlakeney, who as usual had planned and organised the whole expedition,\r\nwould not allow any of his younger comrades to run the risk of almost\r\ncertain capture. Hence his hurried note to them at Lord Grenville\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nball\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cStart myself to-morrow\xe2\x80\x94alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now with his identity known to his most bitter enemy, his every\r\nstep would be dogged, the moment he set foot in France. He would be\r\ntracked by Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s emissaries, followed until he reached that\r\nmysterious hut where the fugitives were waiting for him, and there the\r\ntrap would be closed on him and on them.\r\n\r\nThere was but one hour\xe2\x80\x94the hour\xe2\x80\x99s start which Marguerite and Sir Andrew\r\nhad of their enemy\xe2\x80\x94in which to warn Percy of the imminence of his\r\ndanger, and to persuade him to give up the foolhardy expedition, which\r\ncould only end in his own death.\r\n\r\nBut there _was_ that one hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChauvelin knows of this inn, from the papers he stole,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir\r\nAndrew, earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cand on landing will make straight for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not landed yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have an hour\xe2\x80\x99s start on him, and\r\nPercy will be here directly. We shall be mid-Channel ere Chauvelin has\r\nrealised that we have slipped through his fingers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke excitedly and eagerly, wishing to infuse into her young\r\nfriend some of that buoyant hope which still clung to her heart. But he\r\nshook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilent again, Sir Andrew?\xe2\x80\x9d she said with some impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you\r\nshake your head and look so glum?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, Madame,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis only because in making your\r\nrose-coloured plans, you are forgetting the most important factor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world do you mean?\xe2\x80\x94I am forgetting nothing. . . . What\r\nfactor do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she added with more impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt stands six foot odd high,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir Andrew, quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cand hath\r\nname Percy Blakeney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think that Blakeney would leave Calais without having\r\naccomplished what he set out to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean . . . ?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the old Comte de Tournay . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Comte . . . ?\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd St. Just . . . and others . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother!\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a heart-broken sob of anguish. \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven help\r\nme, but I fear I had forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFugitives as they are, these men at this moment await with perfect\r\nconfidence and unshaken faith the arrival of the Scarlet Pimpernel, who\r\nhas pledged his honour to take them safely across the Channel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndeed, she had forgotten! With the sublime selfishness of a woman who\r\nloves with her whole heart, she had in the last twenty-four hours had\r\nno thought save for him. His precious, noble life, his danger\xe2\x80\x94he, the\r\nloved one, the brave hero, he alone dwelt in her mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, as one by one the heavy tears gathered in\r\nher eyes, as memory came back to her of Armand, the companion and\r\ndarling of her childhood, the man for whom she had committed the deadly\r\nsin, which had so hopelessly imperilled her brave husband\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Percy Blakeney would not be the trusted, honoured leader of a\r\nscore of English gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Andrew, proudly, \xe2\x80\x9cif he abandoned\r\nthose who placed their trust in him. As for breaking his word, the very\r\nthought is preposterous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment or two. Marguerite had buried her face\r\nin her hands, and was letting the tears slowly trickle through her\r\ntrembling fingers. The young man said nothing; his heart ached for this\r\nbeautiful woman in her awful grief. All along he had felt the terrible\r\n_impasse_ in which her own rash act had plunged them all. He knew his\r\nfriend and leader so well, with his reckless daring, his mad bravery,\r\nhis worship of his own word of honour. Sir Andrew knew that Blakeney\r\nwould brave any danger, run the wildest risks sooner than break it,\r\nand, with Chauvelin at his very heels, would make a final attempt,\r\nhowever desperate, to rescue those who trusted in him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, Sir Andrew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite at last, making brave efforts to\r\ndry her tears, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are right, and I would not now shame myself by\r\ntrying to dissuade him from doing his duty. As you say, I should plead\r\nin vain. God grant him strength and ability,\xe2\x80\x9d she added fervently and\r\nresolutely, \xe2\x80\x9cto outwit his pursuers. He will not refuse to take you\r\nwith him, perhaps, when he starts on his noble work; between you, you\r\nwill have cunning as well as valour! God guard you both! In the\r\nmeanwhile I think we should lose no time. I still believe that his\r\nsafety depends upon his knowing that Chauvelin is on his track.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly. He has wonderful resources at his command. As soon as he\r\nis aware of his danger he will exercise more caution: his ingenuity is\r\na veritable miracle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, what say you to a voyage of reconnaissance in the village whilst\r\nI wait here against his coming!\xe2\x80\x94You might come across Percy\xe2\x80\x99s track and\r\nthus save valuable time. If you find him, tell him to beware!\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nbitterest enemy is on his heels!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is such a villainous hole for you to wait in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, that I do not mind!\xe2\x80\x94But you might ask our surly host if he could\r\nlet me wait in another room, where I could be safer from the prying\r\neyes of any chance traveller. Offer him some ready money, so that he\r\nshould not fail to give me word the moment the tall Englishman\r\nreturns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke quite calmly, even cheerfully now, thinking out her plans,\r\nready for the worst if need be; she would show no more weakness, she\r\nwould prove herself worthy of him, who was about to give his life for\r\nthe sake of his fellow-men.\r\n\r\nSir Andrew obeyed her without further comment. Instinctively he felt\r\nthat hers now was the stronger mind; he was willing to give himself\r\nover to her guidance, to become the hand, whilst she was the directing\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nHe went to the door of the inner room, through which Brogard and his\r\nwife had disappeared before, and knocked; as usual, he was answered by\r\na salvo of muttered oaths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey! friend Brogard!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man peremptorily, \xe2\x80\x9cmy lady would\r\nwish to rest here awhile. Could you give her the use of another room?\r\nShe would wish to be alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took some money out of his pocket, and allowed it to jingle\r\nsignificantly in his hand. Brogard had opened the door, and listened,\r\nwith his usual surly apathy, to the young man\xe2\x80\x99s request. At sight of\r\nthe gold, however, his lazy attitude relaxed slightly; he took his pipe\r\nfrom his mouth and shuffled into the room.\r\n\r\nHe then pointed over his shoulder at the attic up in the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can wait up there!\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a grunt. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable, and I\r\nhave no other room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing could be better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marguerite in English; she at once\r\nrealised the advantages such a position hidden from view would give\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cGive him the money, Sir Andrew; I shall be quite happy up there,\r\nand can see everything without being seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded to Brogard, who condescended to go up to the attic, and to\r\nshake up the straw that lay on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I entreat you, madam, to do nothing rash,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Andrew, as\r\nMarguerite prepared in her turn to ascend the rickety flight of steps.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember this place is infested with spies. Do not, I beg of you,\r\nreveal yourself to Sir Percy, unless you are absolutely certain that\r\nyou are alone with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke, he felt how unnecessary was this caution: Marguerite\r\nwas as calm, as clear-headed as any man. There was no fear of her doing\r\nanything that was rash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a slight attempt at cheerfulness, \xe2\x80\x9cthat can I\r\nfaithfully promise you. I would not jeopardise my husband\xe2\x80\x99s life, nor\r\nyet his plans, by speaking to him before strangers. Have no fear, I\r\nwill watch my opportunity, and serve him in the manner I think he needs\r\nit most.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrogard had come down the steps again, and Marguerite was ready to go\r\nup to her safe retreat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare not kiss your hand, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Andrew, as she began to\r\nmount the steps, \xe2\x80\x9csince I am your lacquey, but I pray you be of good\r\ncheer. If I do not come across Blakeney in half an hour, I shall\r\nreturn, expecting to find him here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that will be best. We can afford to wait for half an hour.\r\nChauvelin cannot possibly be here before that. God grant that either\r\nyou or I may have seen Percy by then. Good luck to you, friend! Have no\r\nfear for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLightly she mounted the rickety wooden steps that led to the attic.\r\nBrogard was taking no further heed of her. She could make herself\r\ncomfortable there or not as she chose. Sir Andrew watched her until she\r\nhad reached the loft and sat down upon the straw. She pulled the\r\ntattered curtains across, and the young man noted that she was\r\nsingularly well placed there, for seeing and hearing, whilst remaining\r\nunobserved.\r\n\r\nHe had paid Brogard well; the surly old innkeeper would have no object\r\nin betraying her. Then Sir Andrew prepared to go. At the door he turned\r\nonce again and looked up at the loft. Through the ragged curtains\r\nMarguerite\xe2\x80\x99s sweet face was peeping down at him, and the young man\r\nrejoiced to see that it looked serene, and even gently smiling. With a\r\nfinal nod of farewell to her, he walked out into the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nTHE DEATH-TRAP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next quarter of an hour went by swiftly and noiselessly. In the\r\nroom downstairs, Brogard had for a while busied himself with clearing\r\nthe table, and re-arranging it for another guest.\r\n\r\nIt was because she watched these preparations that Marguerite found the\r\ntime slipping by more pleasantly. It was for Percy that this semblance\r\nof supper was being got ready. Evidently Brogard had a certain amount\r\nof respect for the tall Englishman, as he seemed to take some trouble\r\nin making the place look a trifle less uninviting than it had done\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nHe even produced, from some hidden recess in the old dresser, what\r\nactually looked like a table-cloth; and when he spread it out, and saw\r\nit was full of holes, he shook his head dubiously for a while, then was\r\nat much pains so to spread it over the table as to hide most of its\r\nblemishes.\r\n\r\nThen he got out a serviette, also old and ragged, but possessing some\r\nmeasure of cleanliness, and with this he carefully wiped the glasses,\r\nspoons and plates, which he put on the table.\r\n\r\nMarguerite could not help smiling to herself as she watched all these\r\npreparations, which Brogard accomplished to an accompaniment of\r\nmuttered oaths. Clearly the great height and bulk of the Englishman, or\r\nperhaps the weight of his fist, had overawed this free-born citizen of\r\nFrance, or he would never have been at such trouble for any _sacrr\xc3\xa9\r\naristo_.\r\n\r\nWhen the table was set\xe2\x80\x94such as it was\xe2\x80\x94Brogard surveyed it with evident\r\nsatisfaction. He then dusted one of the chairs with the corner of his\r\nblouse, gave a stir to the stock-pot, threw a fresh bundle of faggots\r\non to the fire, and slouched out of the room.\r\n\r\nMarguerite was left alone with her reflections. She had spread her\r\ntravelling cloak over the straw, and was sitting fairly comfortably, as\r\nthe straw was fresh, and the evil odours from below came up to her only\r\nin a modified form.\r\n\r\nBut, momentarily, she was almost happy; happy because, when she peeped\r\nthrough the tattered curtains, she could see a rickety chair, a torn\r\ntable-cloth, a glass, a plate and a spoon; that was all. But those mute\r\nand ugly things seemed to say to her that they were waiting for Percy;\r\nthat soon, very soon, he would be here, that the squalid room being\r\nstill empty, they would be alone together.\r\n\r\nThat thought was so heavenly, that Marguerite closed her eyes in order\r\nto shut out everything but that. In a few minutes she would be alone\r\nwith him; she would run down the ladder, and let him see her; then he\r\nwould take her in his arms, and she would let him see that, after that,\r\nshe would gladly die for him, and with him, for earth could hold no\r\ngreater happiness than that.\r\n\r\nAnd then what would happen? She could not even remotely conjecture. She\r\nknew, of course, that Sir Andrew was right, that Percy would do\r\neverything he had set out to accomplish; that she\xe2\x80\x94now she was\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94could do nothing, beyond warning him to be cautious, since\r\nChauvelin himself was on his track. After having cautioned him, she\r\nwould perforce have to see him go off upon his terrible and daring\r\nmission; she could not even with a word or look, attempt to keep him\r\nback. She would have to obey, whatever he told her to do, even perhaps\r\nhave to efface herself, and wait, in indescribable agony, whilst he,\r\nperhaps, went to his death.\r\n\r\nBut even that seemed less terrible to bear than the thought that he\r\nshould never know how much she loved him\xe2\x80\x94that at any rate would be\r\nspared her; the squalid room itself, which seemed to be waiting for\r\nhim, told her that he would be here soon.\r\n\r\nSuddenly her over-sensitive ears caught the sound of distant footsteps\r\ndrawing near; her heart gave a wild leap of joy! Was it Percy at last?\r\nNo! the step did not seem quite as long, nor quite as firm as his; she\r\nalso thought that she could hear two distinct sets of footsteps. Yes!\r\nthat was it! two men were coming this way. Two strangers perhaps, to\r\nget a drink, or . . .\r\n\r\nBut she had not time to conjecture, for presently there was a\r\nperemptory call at the door, and the next moment it was violently\r\nthrown open from the outside, whilst a rough, commanding voice\r\nshouted,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey! Citoyen Brogard! Hol\xc3\xa1!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite could not see the newcomers, but, through a hole in one of\r\nthe curtains, she could observe one portion of the room below.\r\n\r\nShe heard Brogard\xe2\x80\x99s shuffling footsteps, as he came out of the inner\r\nroom, muttering his usual string of oaths. On seeing the strangers,\r\nhowever, he paused in the middle of the room, well within range of\r\nMarguerite\xe2\x80\x99s vision, looked at them, with even more withering contempt\r\nthan he had bestowed upon his former guests, and muttered, \xe2\x80\x9c_Sacrrr\xc3\xa9e\r\nsoutane!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite\xe2\x80\x99s heart seemed all at once to stop beating; her eyes, large\r\nand dilated, had fastened on one of the newcomers, who, at this point,\r\nhad taken a quick step forward towards Brogard. He was dressed in the\r\nsoutane, broad-brimmed hat and buckled shoes habitual to the French\r\n_cur\xc3\xa9_, but as he stood opposite the innkeeper, he threw open his\r\nsoutane for a moment, displaying the tricolour scarf of officialism,\r\nwhich sight immediately had the effect of transforming Brogard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattitude of contempt, into one of cringing obsequiousness.\r\n\r\nIt was the sight of this French _cur\xc3\xa9_, which seemed to freeze the very\r\nblood in Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s veins. She could not see his face, which was\r\nshaded by his broad-brimmed hat, but she recognised the thin, bony\r\nhands, the slight stoop, the whole gait of the man! It was Chauvelin!\r\n\r\nThe horror of the situation struck her as with a physical blow; the\r\nawful disappointment, the dread of what was to come, made her very\r\nsenses reel, and she needed almost superhuman effort, not to fall\r\nsenseless beneath it all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA plate of soup and a bottle of wine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin imperiously to\r\nBrogard, \xe2\x80\x9cthen clear out of here\xe2\x80\x94understand? I want to be alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilently, and without any muttering this time, Brogard obeyed.\r\nChauvelin sat down at the table, which had been prepared for the tall\r\nEnglishman, and the innkeeper busied himself obsequiously round him,\r\ndishing up the soup and pouring out the wine. The man who had entered\r\nwith Chauvelin and whom Marguerite could not see, stood waiting close\r\nby the door.\r\n\r\nAt a brusque sign from Chauvelin, Brogard had hurried back to the inner\r\nroom, and the former now beckoned to the man who had accompanied him.\r\n\r\nIn him Marguerite at once recognised Desgas, Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s secretary and\r\nconfidential factotum, whom she had often seen in Paris, in the days\r\ngone by. He crossed the room, and for a moment or two listened\r\nattentively at the Brogards\xe2\x80\x99 door.\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cNot listening?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Chauvelin, curtly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, citoyen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a second Marguerite dreaded lest Chauvelin should order Desgas to\r\nsearch the place; what would happen if she were to be discovered, she\r\nhardly dared to imagine. Fortunately, however, Chauvelin seemed more\r\nimpatient to talk to his secretary than afraid of spies, for he called\r\nDesgas quickly back to his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe English schooner?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was lost sight of at sundown, citoyen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Desgas, \xe2\x80\x9cbut was\r\nthen making west, towards Cap Gris Nez.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x94good!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Chauvelin, \xe2\x80\x9cand now, about Captain Jutley?\xe2\x80\x94what\r\ndid he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe assured me that all the orders you sent him last week have been\r\nimplicitly obeyed. All the roads which converge to this place have been\r\npatrolled night and day ever since: and the beach and cliffs have been\r\nmost rigorously searched and guarded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he know where this \xe2\x80\x98P\xc3\xa8re Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s hut\xe2\x80\x99 is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, citoyen, nobody seems to know of it by that name. There are any\r\namount of fishermen\xe2\x80\x99s huts all along the coast, of course . . . but . .\r\n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do. Now about to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Chauvelin, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe roads and the beach are patrolled as usual, citoyen, and Captain\r\nJutley awaits further orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo back to him at once, then. Tell him to send reinforcements to the\r\nvarious patrols; and especially to those along the beach\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nunderstand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChauvelin spoke curtly and to the point, and every word he uttered\r\nstruck at Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s heart like the death-knell of her fondest hopes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe men,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9care to keep the sharpest possible look-out\r\nfor any stranger who may be walking, riding, or driving, along the road\r\nor the beach, more especially for a tall stranger, whom I need not\r\ndescribe further, as probably he will be disguised; but he cannot very\r\nwell conceal his height, except by stooping. You understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly, citoyen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Desgas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as any of the men have sighted a stranger, two of them are to\r\nkeep him in view. The man who loses sight of the tall stranger, after\r\nhe is once seen, will pay for his negligence with his life; but one man\r\nis to ride straight back here and report to me. Is that clear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely clear, citoyen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then. Go and see Jutley at once. See the reinforcements\r\nstart off for the patrol duty, then ask the captain to let you have\r\nhalf-a-dozen more men and bring them here with you. You can be back in\r\nten minutes. Go\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDesgas saluted and went to the door.\r\n\r\nAs Marguerite, sick with horror, listened to Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s directions to\r\nhis underling, the whole of the plan for the capture of the Scarlet\r\nPimpernel became appallingly clear to her. Chauvelin wished that the\r\nfugitives should be left in false security waiting in their hidden\r\nretreat until Percy joined them. Then the daring plotter was to be\r\nsurrounded and caught red-handed, in the very act of aiding and\r\nabetting royalists, who were traitors to the republic. Thus, if his\r\ncapture were noised abroad, even the British Government could not\r\nlegally protest in his favour; having plotted with the enemies of the\r\nFrench Government, France had the right to put him to death.\r\n\r\nEscape for him and them would be impossible. All the roads patrolled\r\nand watched, the trap well set, the net, wide at present, but drawing\r\ntogether tighter and tighter, until it closed upon the daring plotter,\r\nwhose superhuman cunning even could not rescue him from its meshes now.\r\n\r\nDesgas was about to go, but Chauvelin once more called him back.\r\nMarguerite vaguely wondered what further devilish plans he could have\r\nformed, in order to entrap one brave man, alone, against two-score of\r\nothers. She looked at him as he turned to speak to Desgas; she could\r\njust see his face beneath the broad-brimmed _cur\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s_ hat. There was at\r\nthat moment so much deadly hatred, such fiendish malice in the thin\r\nface and pale, small eyes, that Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s last hope died in her\r\nheart, for she felt that from this man she could expect no mercy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Chauvelin, with a weird chuckle, as he\r\nrubbed his bony, talon-like hands one against the other, with a gesture\r\nof fiendish satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cThe tall stranger may show fight. In any\r\ncase no shooting, remember, except as a last resort. I want that tall\r\nstranger alive . . . if possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed, as Dante has told us that the devils laugh at sight of the\r\ntorture of the damned. Marguerite had thought that by now she had lived\r\nthrough the whole gamut of horror and anguish that human heart could\r\nbear; yet now, when Desgas left the house, and she remained alone in\r\nthis lonely, squalid room, with that fiend for company, she felt as if\r\nall that she had suffered was nothing compared with this. He continued\r\nto laugh and chuckle to himself for a while, rubbing his hands together\r\nin anticipation of his triumph.\r\n\r\nHis plans were well laid, and he might well triumph! Not a loophole was\r\nleft, through which the bravest, the most cunning man might escape.\r\nEvery road guarded, every corner watched, and in that lonely hut\r\nsomewhere on the coast, a small band of fugitives waiting for their\r\nrescuer, and leading him to his death\xe2\x80\x94nay! to worse than death. That\r\nfiend there, in a holy man\xe2\x80\x99s garb, was too much of a devil to allow a\r\nbrave man to die the quick, sudden death of a soldier at the post of\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nHe, above all, longed to have the cunning enemy, who had so long\r\nbaffled him, helpless in his power; he wished to gloat over him, to\r\nenjoy his downfall, to inflict upon him what moral and mental torture a\r\ndeadly hatred alone can devise. The brave eagle, captured, and with\r\nnoble wings clipped, was doomed to endure the gnawing of the rat. And\r\nshe, his wife, who loved him, and who had brought him to this, could do\r\nnothing to help him.\r\n\r\nNothing, save to hope for death by his side, and for one brief moment\r\nin which to tell him that her love\xe2\x80\x94whole, true and passionate\xe2\x80\x94was\r\nentirely his.\r\n\r\nChauvelin was now sitting close to the table; he had taken off his hat,\r\nand Marguerite could just see the outline of his thin profile and\r\npointed chin, as he bent over his meagre supper. He was evidently quite\r\ncontented, and awaited events with perfect calm; he even seemed to\r\nenjoy Brogard\xe2\x80\x99s unsavoury fare. Marguerite wondered how so much hatred\r\ncould lurk in one human being against another.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as she watched Chauvelin, a sound caught her ear, which\r\nturned her very heart to stone. And yet that sound was not calculated\r\nto inspire anyone with horror, for it was merely the cheerful sound of\r\na gay, fresh voice singing lustily, \xe2\x80\x9cGod save the King!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nTHE EAGLE AND THE FOX\r\n\r\n\r\nMarguerite\xe2\x80\x99s breath stopped short; she seemed to feel her very life\r\nstanding still momentarily whilst she listened to that voice and to\r\nthat song. In the singer she had recognised her husband. Chauvelin,\r\ntoo, had heard it, for he darted a quick glance towards the door, then\r\nhurriedly took up his broad-brimmed hat and clapped it over his head.\r\n\r\nThe voice drew nearer; for one brief second the wild desire seized\r\nMarguerite to rush down the steps and fly across the room, to stop that\r\nsong at any cost, to beg the cheerful singer to fly\xe2\x80\x94fly for his life,\r\nbefore it be too late. She checked the impulse just in time. Chauvelin\r\nwould stop her before she reached the door, and, moreover, she had no\r\nidea if he had any soldiers posted within his call. Her impetuous act\r\nmight prove the death-signal of the man she would have died to save.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong to reign over us,\r\nGod save the King!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nsang the voice more lustily than ever. The next moment the door was\r\nthrown open and there was dead silence for a second or so.\r\n\r\nMarguerite could not see the door: she held her breath, trying to\r\nimagine what was happening.\r\n\r\nPercy Blakeney on entering had, of course, at once caught sight of the\r\n_cur\xc3\xa9_ at the table; his hesitation lasted less than five seconds, the\r\nnext moment Marguerite saw his tall figure crossing the room, whilst he\r\ncalled in a loud, cheerful voice,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, there! no one about? Where\xe2\x80\x99s that fool Brogard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wore the magnificent coat and riding-suit which he had on when\r\nMarguerite last saw him at Richmond, so many hours ago. As usual, his\r\nget-up was absolutely irreproachable, the fine Mechlin lace at his neck\r\nand wrists was immaculate in its gossamer daintiness, his hands looked\r\nslender and white, his fair hair was carefully brushed, and he carried\r\nhis eye-glass with his usual affected gesture. In fact, at this moment,\r\nSir Percy Blakeney, Bart., might have been on his way to a garden-party\r\nat the Prince of Wales\xe2\x80\x99, instead of deliberately, cold-bloodedly\r\nrunning his head in a trap, set for him by his deadliest enemy.\r\n\r\nHe stood for a moment in the middle of the room, whilst Marguerite,\r\nabsolutely paralysed with horror, seemed unable even to breathe.\r\n\r\nEvery moment she expected that Chauvelin would give a signal, that the\r\nplace would fill with soldiers, that she would rush down and help Percy\r\nto sell his life dearly. As he stood there, suavely unconscious, she\r\nvery nearly screamed out to him,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFly, Percy!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis your deadly enemy!\xe2\x80\x94fly before it be too late!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she had not time even to do that, for the next moment Blakeney\r\nquietly walked to the table, and, jovially clapping the _cur\xc3\xa9_ on the\r\nback, said in his own drawly, affected way,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOdd\xe2\x80\x99s fish! . . . er . . . M. Chauvelin. . . . I vow I never thought\r\nof meeting you here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChauvelin, who had been in the very act of conveying soup to his mouth,\r\nfairly choked. His thin face became absolutely purple, and a violent\r\nfit of coughing saved this cunning representative of France from\r\nbetraying the most boundless surprise he had ever experienced. There\r\nwas no doubt that this bold move on the part of the enemy had been\r\nwholly unexpected, as far as he was concerned: and the daring impudence\r\nof it completely nonplussed him for the moment.\r\n\r\nObviously he had not taken the precaution of having the inn surrounded\r\nwith soldiers. Blakeney had evidently guessed that much, and no doubt\r\nhis resourceful brain had already formed some plan by which he could\r\nturn this unexpected interview to account.\r\n\r\nMarguerite up in the loft had not moved. She had made a solemn promise\r\nto Sir Andrew not to speak to her husband before strangers, and she had\r\nsufficient self-control not to throw herself unreasoningly and\r\nimpulsively across his plans. To sit still and watch these two men\r\ntogether was a terrible trial of fortitude. Marguerite had heard\r\nChauvelin give the orders for the patrolling of all the roads. She knew\r\nthat if Percy now left the \xe2\x80\x9cChat Gris\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in whichever direction he\r\nhappened to go\xe2\x80\x94he could not go far without being sighted by some of\r\nCaptain Jutley\xe2\x80\x99s men on patrol. On the other hand, if he stayed, then\r\nDesgas would have time to come back with the half-dozen men Chauvelin\r\nhad specially ordered.\r\n\r\nThe trap was closing in, and Marguerite could do nothing but watch and\r\nwonder. The two men looked such a strange contrast, and of the two it\r\nwas Chauvelin who exhibited a slight touch of fear. Marguerite knew him\r\nwell enough to guess what was passing in his mind. He had no fear for\r\nhis own person, although he certainly was alone in a lonely inn with a\r\nman who was powerfully built, and who was daring and reckless beyond\r\nthe bounds of probability. She knew that Chauvelin would willingly have\r\nbraved perilous encounters for the sake of the cause he had at heart,\r\nbut what he did fear was that this impudent Englishman would, by\r\nknocking him down, double his own chances of escape; his underlings\r\nmight not succeed so well in capturing the Scarlet Pimpernel, when not\r\ndirected by the cunning hand and the shrewd brain, which had deadly\r\nhate for an incentive.\r\n\r\nEvidently, however, the representative of the French Government had\r\nnothing to fear for the moment, at the hands of his powerful adversary.\r\nBlakeney, with his most inane laugh and pleasant good-nature, was\r\nsolemnly patting him on the back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so demmed sorry . . .\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9cso very sorry .\r\n. . I seem to have upset you . . . eating soup, too . . . nasty,\r\nawkward thing, soup . . . er . . . Begad!\xe2\x80\x94a friend of mine died once .\r\n. . er . . . choked . . . just like you . . . with a spoonful of soup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he smiled shyly, good-humouredly, down at Chauvelin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOdd\xe2\x80\x99s life!\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, as soon as the latter had somewhat\r\nrecovered himself, \xe2\x80\x9cbeastly hole this . . . ain\xe2\x80\x99t it now? La! you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, apologetically, as he sat down on a chair close to the\r\ntable and drew the soup tureen towards him. \xe2\x80\x9cThat fool Brogard seems to\r\nbe asleep or something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a second plate on the table, and he calmly helped himself to\r\nsoup, then poured himself out a glass of wine.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Marguerite wondered what Chauvelin would do. His disguise\r\nwas so good that perhaps he meant, on recovering himself, to deny his\r\nidentity: but Chauvelin was too astute to make such an obviously false\r\nand childish move, and already he too had stretched out his hand and\r\nsaid pleasantly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am indeed charmed to see you, Sir Percy. You must excuse me\xe2\x80\x94h\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nthought you the other side of the Channel. Sudden surprise almost took\r\nmy breath away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Percy, with a good-humoured grin, \xe2\x80\x9cit did that quite,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t it\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94M.\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94Chaubertin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me\xe2\x80\x94Chauvelin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg pardon\xe2\x80\x94a thousand times. Yes\xe2\x80\x94Chauvelin of course. . . . Er . . .\r\nI never could cotton to foreign names. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was calmly eating his soup, laughing with pleasant good-humour, as\r\nif he had come all the way to Calais for the express purpose of\r\nenjoying supper at this filthy inn, in the company of his arch-enemy.\r\n\r\nFor the moment Marguerite wondered why Percy did not knock the little\r\nFrenchman down then and there\xe2\x80\x94and no doubt something of the sort must\r\nhave darted through his mind, for every now and then his lazy eyes\r\nseemed to flash ominously, as they rested on the slight figure of\r\nChauvelin, who had now quite recovered himself and was also calmly\r\neating his soup.\r\n\r\nBut the keen brain, which had planned and carried through so many\r\ndaring plots, was too far-seeing to take unnecessary risks. This place,\r\nafter all, might be infested with spies; the innkeeper might be in\r\nChauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s pay. One call on Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s part might bring twenty men\r\nabout Blakeney\xe2\x80\x99s ears for aught he knew, and he might be caught and\r\ntrapped before he could help or, at least, warn the fugitives. This he\r\nwould not risk; he meant to help the others, to get _them_ safely away;\r\nfor he had pledged his word to them, and his word he _would_ keep. And\r\nwhilst he ate and chatted, he thought and planned, whilst, up in the\r\nloft, the poor, anxious woman racked her brain as to what she should\r\ndo, and endured agonies of longing to rush down to him, yet not daring\r\nto move for fear of upsetting his plans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Blakeney was saying jovially, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you . . . er . . .\r\nwere in holy orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI . . . er . . . hem . . .\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Chauvelin. The calm impudence of\r\nhis antagonist had evidently thrown him off his usual balance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, la! I should have known you anywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sir Percy,\r\nplacidly, as he poured himself out another glass of wine, \xe2\x80\x9calthough the\r\nwig and hat have changed you a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLud! they alter a man so . . . but . . . begad! I hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nmy having made the remark? . . . Demmed bad form making remarks. . . .\r\nI hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, not at all\xe2\x80\x94hem! I hope Lady Blakeney is well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin,\r\nhurriedly changing the topic of conversation.\r\n\r\nBlakeney, with much deliberation, finished his plate of soup, drank his\r\nglass of wine, and, momentarily, it seemed to Marguerite as if he\r\nglanced quickly all round the room.\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cQuite well, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, drily. There was a pause,\r\n during which Marguerite could watch these two antagonists who,\r\n evidently in their minds, were measuring themselves against one\r\n another. She could see Percy almost full face where he sat at the\r\n table not ten yards from where she herself was crouching, puzzled, not\r\n knowing what to do, or what she should think. She had quite controlled\r\n her impulse by now of rushing down and disclosing herself to her\r\n husband. A man capable of acting a part, in the way he was doing at\r\n the present moment, did not need a woman\xe2\x80\x99s word to warn him to be\r\n cautious.\r\n\r\nMarguerite indulged in the luxury, dear to every tender woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart,\r\nof looking at the man she loved. She looked through the tattered\r\ncurtain, across at the handsome face of her husband, in whose lazy blue\r\neyes, and behind whose inane smile, she could now so plainly see the\r\nstrength, energy, and resourcefulness which had caused the Scarlet\r\nPimpernel to be reverenced and trusted by his followers. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are\r\nnineteen of us ready to lay down our lives for your husband, Lady\r\nBlakeney,\xe2\x80\x9d Sir Andrew had said to her; and as she looked at the\r\nforehead, low, but square and broad, the eyes, blue, yet deep-set and\r\nintense, the whole aspect of the man, of indomitable energy, hiding,\r\nbehind a perfectly acted comedy, his almost superhuman strength of will\r\nand marvellous ingenuity, she understood the fascination which he\r\nexercised over his followers, for had he not also cast his spells over\r\nher heart and her imagination?\r\n\r\nChauvelin, who was trying to conceal his impatience beneath his usual\r\nurbane manner, took a quick look at his watch. Desgas should not be\r\nlong: another two or three minutes, and this impudent Englishman would\r\nbe secure in the keeping of half a dozen of Captain Jutley\xe2\x80\x99s most\r\ntrusted men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are on your way to Paris, Sir Percy?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked carelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOdd\xe2\x80\x99s life, no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Blakeney, with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly as far as\r\nLille\xe2\x80\x94not Paris for me . . . beastly uncomfortable place Paris, just\r\nnow . . . eh, Monsieur Chaubertin . . . beg pardon . . . Chauvelin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for an English gentleman like yourself, Sir Percy,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined\r\nChauvelin, sarcastically, \xe2\x80\x9cwho takes no interest in the conflict that\r\nis raging there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa! you see it\xe2\x80\x99s no business of mine, and our demmed government is all\r\non your side of the business. Old Pitt daren\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98Bo\xe2\x80\x99 to a goose. You\r\nare in a hurry, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as Chauvelin once again took out his\r\nwatch; \xe2\x80\x9can appointment, perhaps. . . . I pray you take no heed of\r\nme. . . . My time\xe2\x80\x99s my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose from the table and dragged a chair to the hearth. Once more\r\nMarguerite was terribly tempted to go to him, for time was getting on;\r\nDesgas might be back at any moment with his men. Percy did not know\r\nthat and . . . oh! how horrible it all was\xe2\x80\x94and how helpless she felt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in no hurry,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Percy, pleasantly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut, la! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto spend any more time than I can help in this God-forsaken hole! But,\r\nbegad! sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as Chauvelin had surreptitiously looked at his\r\nwatch for the third time, \xe2\x80\x9cthat watch of yours won\xe2\x80\x99t go any faster for\r\nall the looking you give it. You are expecting a friend, maybe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye\xe2\x80\x94a friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a lady\xe2\x80\x94I trust, Monsieur l\xe2\x80\x99Abb\xc3\xa9,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Blakeney; \xe2\x80\x9csurely the\r\nholy Church does not allow? . . . eh? . . . what! But, I say, come by\r\nthe fire . . . it\xe2\x80\x99s getting demmed cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kicked the fire with the heel of his boot, making the logs blaze in\r\nthe old hearth. He seemed in no hurry to go, and apparently was quite\r\nunconscious of his immediate danger. He dragged another chair to the\r\nfire, and Chauvelin, whose impatience was by now quite beyond control,\r\nsat down beside the hearth, in such a way as to command a view of the\r\ndoor. Desgas had been gone nearly a quarter of an hour. It was quite\r\nplain to Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s aching senses that as soon as he arrived,\r\nChauvelin would abandon all his other plans with regard to the\r\nfugitives, and capture this impudent Scarlet Pimpernel at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, M. Chauvelin,\xe2\x80\x9d the latter was saying airily, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me, I pray\r\nyou, is your friend pretty? Demmed smart these little French women\r\nsometimes\xe2\x80\x94what? But I protest I need not ask,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as he\r\ncarelessly strode back towards the supper-table. \xe2\x80\x9cIn matters of taste\r\nthe Church has never been backward. . . . Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Chauvelin was not listening. His every faculty was now concentrated\r\non that door through which presently Desgas would enter. Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthoughts, too, were centred there, for her ears had suddenly caught,\r\nthrough the stillness of the night, the sound of numerous and measured\r\ntreads some distance away.\r\n\r\nIt was Desgas and his men. Another three minutes and they would be\r\nhere! Another three minutes and the awful thing would have occurred:\r\nthe brave eagle would have fallen in the ferret\xe2\x80\x99s trap! She would have\r\nmoved now and screamed, but she dared not; for whilst she heard the\r\nsoldiers approaching, she was looking at Percy and watching his every\r\nmovement. He was standing by the table whereon the remnants of the\r\nsupper, plates, glasses, spoons, salt and pepper-pots were scattered\r\npell-mell. His back was turned to Chauvelin and he was still prattling\r\nalong in his own affected and inane way, but from his pocket he had\r\ntaken his snuff-box, and quickly and suddenly he emptied the contents\r\nof the pepper-pot into it.\r\n\r\nThen he again turned with an inane laugh to Chauvelin,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh? Did you speak, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChauvelin had been too intent on listening to the sound of those\r\napproaching footsteps, to notice what his cunning adversary had been\r\ndoing. He now pulled himself together, trying to look unconcerned in\r\nthe very midst of his anticipated triumph.\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said presently, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is\xe2\x80\x94as you were saying, Sir Percy\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was saying,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blakeney, going up to Chauvelin, by the fire,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat the Jew in Piccadilly has sold me better snuff this time than I\r\nhave ever tasted. Will you honour me, Monsieur l\xe2\x80\x99Abb\xc3\xa9?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood close to Chauvelin in his own careless, _d\xc3\xa9bonnaire_ way,\r\nholding out his snuff-box to his arch-enemy.\r\n\r\nChauvelin, who, as he told Marguerite once, had seen a trick or two in\r\nhis day, had never dreamed of this one. With one ear fixed on those\r\nfast-approaching footsteps, one eye turned to that door where Desgas\r\nand his men would presently appear, lulled into false security by the\r\nimpudent Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s airy manner, he never even remotely guessed the\r\ntrick which was being played upon him.\r\n\r\nHe took a pinch of snuff.\r\n\r\nOnly he, who has ever by accident sniffed vigorously a dose of pepper,\r\ncan have the faintest conception of the hopeless condition in which\r\nsuch a sniff would reduce any human being.\r\n\r\nChauvelin felt as if his head would burst\xe2\x80\x94sneeze after sneeze seemed\r\nnearly to choke him; he was blind, deaf, and dumb for the moment, and\r\nduring that moment Blakeney quietly, without the slightest haste, took\r\nup his hat, took some money out of his pocket, which he left on the\r\ntable, then calmly stalked out of the room!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nTHE JEW\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took Marguerite some time to collect her scattered senses; the whole\r\nof this last short episode had taken place in less than a minute, and\r\nDesgas and the soldiers were still about two hundred yards away from\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cChat Gris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she realised what had happened, a curious mixture of joy and\r\nwonder filled her heart. It all was so neat, so ingenious. Chauvelin\r\nwas still absolutely helpless, far more so than he could even have been\r\nunder a blow from the fist, for now he could neither see, nor hear, nor\r\nspeak, whilst his cunning adversary had quietly slipped through his\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nBlakeney was gone, obviously to try and join the fugitives at the P\xc3\xa8re\r\nBlanchard\xe2\x80\x99s hut. For the moment, true, Chauvelin was helpless; for the\r\nmoment the daring Scarlet Pimpernel had not been caught by Desgas and\r\nhis men. But all the roads and the beach were patrolled. Every place\r\nwas watched, and every stranger kept in sight. How far could Percy go,\r\nthus arrayed in his gorgeous clothes, without being sighted and\r\nfollowed?\r\n\r\nNow she blamed herself terribly for not having gone down to him sooner, and\r\ngiven him that word of warning and of love which, perhaps, after all, he\r\nneeded. He could not know of the orders which Chauvelin had given for his\r\ncapture, and even now, perhaps . . .\r\n\r\nBut before all these horrible thoughts had taken concrete form in her\r\nbrain, she heard the grounding of arms outside, close to the door, and\r\nDesgas\xe2\x80\x99 voice shouting \xe2\x80\x9cHalt!\xe2\x80\x9d to his men.\r\n\r\nChauvelin had partially recovered; his sneezing had become less\r\nviolent, and he had struggled to his feet. He managed to reach the door\r\njust as Desgas\xe2\x80\x99 knock was heard on the outside.\r\n\r\nChauvelin threw open the door, and before his secretary could say a\r\nword, he had managed to stammer between two sneezes\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tall stranger\xe2\x80\x94quick!\xe2\x80\x94did any of you see him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, citoyen?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Desgas, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, man! through that door! not five minutes ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe saw nothing, citoyen! The moon is not yet up, and . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are just five minutes too late, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin,\r\nwith concentrated fury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCitoyen . . . I . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did what I ordered you to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin, with impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow that, but you were a precious long time about it. Fortunately,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s not much harm done, or it had fared ill with you, Citoyen\r\nDesgas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDesgas turned a little pale. There was so much rage and hatred in his\r\nsuperior\xe2\x80\x99s whole attitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tall stranger, citoyen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas here, in this room, five minutes ago, having supper at that table.\r\nDamn his impudence! For obvious reasons, I dared not tackle him alone.\r\nBrogard is too big a fool, and that cursed Englishman appears to have\r\nthe strength of a bullock, and so he slipped away under your very\r\nnose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe cannot go far without being sighted, citoyen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Jutley sent forty men as reinforcements for the patrol duty:\r\ntwenty went down to the beach. He again assured me that the watch has\r\nbeen constant all day, and that no stranger could possibly get to the\r\nbeach, or reach a boat, without being sighted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s good.\xe2\x80\x94Do the men know their work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have had very clear orders, citoyen: and I myself spoke to those\r\nwho were about to start. They are to shadow\xe2\x80\x94as secretly as possible\xe2\x80\x94any\r\nstranger they may see, especially if he be tall, or stoop as if he\r\nwould disguise his height.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn no case to detain such a person, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin,\r\neagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat impudent Scarlet Pimpernel would slip through clumsy\r\nfingers. We must let him get to the P\xc3\xa8re Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s hut now; there\r\nsurround and capture him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe men understand that, citoyen, and also that, as soon as a tall\r\nstranger has been sighted, he must be shadowed, whilst one man is to\r\nturn straight back and report to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin, rubbing his hands, well pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have further news for you, citoyen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA tall Englishman had a long conversation about three-quarters of an\r\nhour ago with a Jew, Reuben by name, who lives not ten paces from\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94and?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Chauvelin, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe conversation was all about a horse and cart, which the tall\r\nEnglishman wished to hire, and which was to have been ready for him by\r\neleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is past that now. Where does that Reuben live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk from this door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend one of the men to find out if the stranger has driven off in\r\nReuben\xe2\x80\x99s cart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, citoyen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDesgas went to give the necessary orders to one of the men. Not a word\r\nof this conversation between him and Chauvelin had escaped Marguerite,\r\nand every word they had spoken seemed to strike at her heart, with\r\nterrible hopelessness and dark foreboding.\r\n\r\nShe had come all this way, and with such high hopes and firm\r\ndetermination to help her husband, and so far she had been able to do\r\nnothing, but to watch, with a heart breaking with anguish, the meshes\r\nof the deadly net closing round the daring Scarlet Pimpernel.\r\n\r\nHe could not now advance many steps, without spying eyes to track and\r\ndenounce him. Her own helplessness struck her with the terrible sense\r\nof utter disappointment. The possibility of being of the slightest use\r\nto her husband had become almost _nil_, and her only hope rested in\r\nbeing allowed to share his fate, whatever it might ultimately be.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, even her chance of ever seeing the man she loved again,\r\nhad become a remote one. Still, she was determined to keep a close\r\nwatch over his enemy, and a vague hope filled her heart, that whilst\r\nshe kept Chauvelin in sight, Percy\xe2\x80\x99s fate might still be hanging in the\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\nDesgas had left Chauvelin moodily pacing up and down the room, whilst\r\nhe himself waited outside for the return of the man whom he had sent in\r\nsearch of Reuben. Thus several minutes went by. Chauvelin was evidently\r\ndevoured with impatience. Apparently he trusted no one: this last trick\r\nplayed upon him by the daring Scarlet Pimpernel had made him suddenly\r\ndoubtful of success, unless he himself was there to watch, direct and\r\nsuperintend the capture of this impudent Englishman.\r\n\r\nAbout five minutes later, Desgas returned, followed by an elderly Jew,\r\nin a dirty, threadbare gaberdine, worn greasy across the shoulders. His\r\nred hair, which he wore after the fashion of the Polish Jews, with the\r\ncorkscrew curls each side of his face, was plentifully sprinkled with\r\ngrey\xe2\x80\x94a general coating of grime, about his cheeks and his chin, gave\r\nhim a peculiarly dirty and loathsome appearance. He had the habitual\r\nstoop, those of his race affected in mock humility in past centuries,\r\nbefore the dawn of equality and freedom in matters of faith, and he\r\nwalked behind Desgas with the peculiar shuffling gait which has\r\nremained the characteristic of the Jew trader in continental Europe to\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\nChauvelin, who had all the Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s prejudice against the despised\r\nrace, motioned to the fellow to keep at a respectful distance. The\r\ngroup of the three men were standing just underneath the hanging\r\noil-lamp, and Marguerite had a clear view of them all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the man?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Chauvelin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, citoyen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Desgas, \xe2\x80\x9cReuben could not be found, so\r\npresumably his cart has gone with the stranger; but this man here seems\r\nto know something, which he is willing to sell for a consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin, turning away with disgust from the loathsome\r\nspecimen of humanity before him.\r\n\r\nThe Jew, with characteristic patience, stood humbly on one side,\r\nleaning on a thick knotted staff, his greasy, broad-brimmed hat casting\r\na deep shadow over his grimy face, waiting for the noble Excellency to\r\ndeign to put some questions to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe citoyen tells me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin peremptorily to him, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\nknow something of my friend, the tall Englishman, whom I desire to\r\nmeet. . . . _Morbleu!_ keep your distance, man,\xe2\x80\x9d he added hurriedly, as\r\nthe Jew took a quick and eager step forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your Excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew, who spoke the language with\r\nthat peculiar lisp which denotes Eastern origin, \xe2\x80\x9cI and Reuben\r\nGoldstein met a tall Englishman, on the road, close by here this\r\nevening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you speak to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe spoke to us, your Excellency. He wanted to know if he could hire a\r\nhorse and cart to go down along the St. Martin Road, to a place he\r\nwanted to reach to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not say anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew in an injured tone, \xe2\x80\x9cReuben\r\nGoldstein, that accursed traitor, that son of Belial . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCut that short, man,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Chauvelin, roughly, \xe2\x80\x9cand go on with\r\nyour story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe took the words out of my mouth, your Excellency; when I was about\r\nto offer the wealthy Englishman my horse and cart, to take him\r\nwheresoever he chose, Reuben had already spoken, and offered his\r\nhalf-starved nag, and his broken-down cart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did the Englishman do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe listened to Reuben Goldstein, your Excellency, and put his hand in\r\nhis pocket then and there, and took out a handful of gold, which he\r\nshowed to that descendant of Beelzebub, telling him that all that would\r\nbe his, if the horse and cart were ready for him by eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, of course, the horse and cart were ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! they were ready in a manner, so to speak, your Excellency.\r\nReuben\xe2\x80\x99s nag was lame as usual; she refused to budge at first. It was\r\nonly after a time and with plenty of kicks, that she at last could be\r\nmade to move,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew with a malicious chuckle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen they started?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they started about five minutes ago. I was disgusted with that\r\nstranger\xe2\x80\x99s folly. An Englishman too!\xe2\x80\x94He ought to have known Reuben\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnag was not fit to drive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if he had no choice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo choice, your Excellency?\xe2\x80\x9d protested the Jew, in a rasping voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdid I not repeat to him a dozen times, that my horse and cart would\r\ntake him quicker, and more comfortably than Reuben\xe2\x80\x99s bag of bones. He\r\nwould not listen. Reuben is such a liar, and has such insinuating ways.\r\nThe stranger was deceived. If he was in a hurry, he would have had\r\nbetter value for his money by taking my cart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a horse and cart too, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Chauvelin, peremptorily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye! that I have, your Excellency, and if your Excellency wants to\r\ndrive . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you happen to know which way my friend went in Reuben Goldstein\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThoughtfully the Jew rubbed his dirty chin. Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s heart was\r\nbeating well-nigh to bursting. She had heard the peremptory question;\r\nshe looked anxiously at the Jew, but could not read his face beneath\r\nthe shadow of his broad-brimmed hat. Vaguely she felt somehow as if he\r\nheld Percy\xe2\x80\x99s fate in his long, dirty hands.\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause, whilst Chauvelin frowned impatiently at the\r\nstooping figure before him: at last the Jew slowly put his hand in his\r\nbreast pocket, and drew out from its capacious depths a number of\r\nsilver coins. He gazed at them thoughtfully, then remarked, in a quiet\r\ntone of voice,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what the tall stranger gave me, when he drove away with\r\nReuben, for holding my tongue about him, and his doings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChauvelin shrugged his shoulders impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much is there there?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty francs, your Excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have been an\r\nhonest man all my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChauvelin without further comment took a few pieces of gold out of his\r\nown pocket, and leaving them in the palm of his hand, he allowed them\r\nto jingle as he held them out towards the Jew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many gold pieces are there in the palm of my hand?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\nEvidently he had no desire to terrorise the man, but to conciliate him,\r\nfor his own purposes, for his manner was pleasant and suave. No doubt\r\nhe feared that threats of the guillotine, and various other persuasive\r\nmethods of that type, might addle the old man\xe2\x80\x99s brains, and that he\r\nwould be more likely to be useful through greed of gain, than through\r\nterror of death.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the Jew shot a quick, keen glance at the gold in his\r\ninterlocutor\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least five, I should say, your Excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied\r\nobsequiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough, do you think, to loosen that honest tongue of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does your Excellency wish to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether your horse and cart can take me to where I can find my friend\r\nthe tall stranger, who has driven off in Reuben Goldstein\xe2\x80\x99s cart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy horse and cart can take your Honour there, where you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo a place called the P\xc3\xa8re Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s hut?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Honour has guessed?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know the place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it, your Honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich road leads to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe St. Martin Road, your Honour, then a footpath from there to the\r\ncliffs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know the road?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Chauvelin, roughly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery stone, every blade of grass, your Honour,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\nChauvelin without another word threw the five pieces of gold one by one\r\nbefore the Jew, who knelt down, and on his hands and knees struggled to\r\ncollect them. One rolled away, and he had some trouble to get it, for\r\nit had lodged underneath the dresser. Chauvelin quietly waited while\r\nthe old man scrambled on the floor, to find the piece of gold.\r\n\r\nWhen the Jew was again on his feet, Chauvelin said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow soon can your horse and cart be ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are ready now, your Honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot ten m\xc3\xa8tres from this door. Will your Excellency deign to look?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see it. How far can you drive me in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as the P\xc3\xa8re Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s hut, your Honour, and further than\r\nReuben\xe2\x80\x99s nag took your friend. I am sure that, not two leagues from\r\nhere, we shall come across that wily Reuben, his nag, his cart and the\r\ntall stranger all in a heap in the middle of the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far is the nearest village from here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the road which the Englishman took, Miquelon is the nearest\r\nvillage, not two leagues from here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he could get fresh conveyance, if he wanted to go further?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe could\xe2\x80\x94if he ever got so far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill your Excellency try?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my intention,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin very quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut remember, if\r\nyou have deceived me, I shall tell off two of my most stalwart soldiers\r\nto give you such a beating, that your breath will perhaps leave your\r\nugly body for ever. But if we find my friend the tall Englishman,\r\neither on the road or at the P\xc3\xa8re Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s hut, there will be ten\r\nmore gold pieces for you. Do you accept the bargain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew again thoughtfully rubbed his chin. He looked at the money in\r\nhis hand, then at his stern interlocutor, and at Desgas, who had stood\r\nsilently behind him all this while. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, he said\r\ndeliberately,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accept.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and wait outside then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin, \xe2\x80\x9cand remember to stick to\r\nyour bargain, or by Heaven, I will keep to mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a final, most abject and cringing bow, the old Jew shuffled out of\r\nthe room. Chauvelin seemed pleased with his interview, for he rubbed\r\nhis hands together, with that usual gesture of his, of malignant\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy coat and boots,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Desgas at last.\r\n\r\nDesgas went to the door, and apparently gave the necessary orders, for\r\npresently a soldier entered, carrying Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s coat, boots, and hat.\r\n\r\nHe took off his soutane, beneath which he was wearing close-fitting\r\nbreeches and a cloth waistcoat, and began changing his attire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, citoyen, in the meanwhile,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Desgas, \xe2\x80\x9cgo back to\r\nCaptain Jutley as fast as you can, and tell him to let you have another\r\ndozen men, and bring them with you along the St. Martin Road, where I\r\ndaresay you will soon overtake the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s cart with myself in it. There\r\nwill be hot work presently, if I mistake not, in the P\xc3\xa8re Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhut. We shall corner our game there, I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant, for this impudent\r\nScarlet Pimpernel has had the audacity\xe2\x80\x94or the stupidity, I hardly know\r\nwhich\xe2\x80\x94to adhere to his original plans. He has gone to meet de Tournay,\r\nSt. Just and the other traitors, which for the moment, I thought,\r\nperhaps, he did not intend to do. When we find them, there will be a\r\nband of desperate men at bay. Some of our men will, I presume, be put\r\n_hors de combat_. These royalists are good swordsmen, and the\r\nEnglishman is devilish cunning, and looks very powerful. Still, we\r\nshall be five against one at least. You can follow the cart closely\r\nwith your men, all along the St. Martin Road, through Miquelon. The\r\nEnglishman is ahead of us, and not likely to look behind him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhilst he gave these curt and concise orders, he had completed his\r\nchange of attire. The priest\xe2\x80\x99s costume had been laid aside, and he was\r\nonce more dressed in his usual dark, tight-fitting clothes. At last he\r\ntook up his hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have an interesting prisoner to deliver into your hands,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid with a chuckle, as with unwonted familiarity he took Desgas\xe2\x80\x99 arm,\r\nand led him towards the door. \xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t kill him outright, eh, friend\r\nDesgas? The P\xc3\xa8re Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s hut is\xe2\x80\x94an I mistake not\xe2\x80\x94a lonely spot upon\r\nthe beach, and our men will enjoy a bit of rough sport there with the\r\nwounded fox. Choose your men well, friend Desgas . . . of the sort who\r\nwould enjoy that type of sport\xe2\x80\x94eh? We must see that Scarlet Pimpernel\r\nwither a bit\xe2\x80\x94what?\xe2\x80\x94shrink and tremble, eh? . . . before we finally . .\r\n.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he made an expressive gesture, whilst he laughed a low, evil laugh,\r\nwhich filled Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s soul with sickening horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChoose your men well, Citoyen Desgas,\xe2\x80\x9d he said once more, as he led\r\nhis secretary finally out of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nON THE TRACK\r\n\r\n\r\nNever for a moment did Marguerite Blakeney hesitate. The last sounds\r\noutside the \xe2\x80\x9cChat Gris\xe2\x80\x9d had died away in the night. She had heard\r\nDesgas giving orders to his men, and then starting off towards the\r\nfort, to get a reinforcement of a dozen more men: six were not thought\r\nsufficient to capture the cunning Englishman, whose resourceful brain\r\nwas even more dangerous than his valour and his strength.\r\n\r\nThen a few minutes later, she heard the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s husky voice again,\r\nevidently shouting to his nag, then the rumble of wheels, and noise of\r\na rickety cart bumping over the rough road.\r\n\r\nInside the inn, everything was still. Brogard and his wife, terrified\r\nof Chauvelin, had given no sign of life; they hoped to be forgotten,\r\nand at any rate to remain unperceived: Marguerite could not even hear\r\ntheir usual volleys of muttered oaths.\r\n\r\nShe waited a moment or two longer, then she quietly slipped down the\r\nbroken stairs, wrapped her dark cloak closely round her and slipped out\r\nof the inn.\r\n\r\nThe night was fairly dark, sufficiently so at any rate to hide her dark\r\nfigure from view, whilst her keen ears kept count of the sound of the\r\ncart going on ahead. She hoped by keeping well within the shadow of the\r\nditches which lined the road, that she would not be seen by Desgas\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmen, when they approached, or by the patrols, which she concluded were\r\nstill on duty.\r\n\r\nThus she started to do this, the last stage of her weary journey,\r\nalone, at night, and on foot. Nearly three leagues to Miquelon, and\r\nthen on to the P\xc3\xa8re Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s hut, wherever that fatal spot might be,\r\nprobably over rough roads: she cared not.\r\n\r\nThe Jew\xe2\x80\x99s nag could not get on very fast, and though she was weary with\r\nmental fatigue and nerve strain, she knew that she could easily keep up\r\nwith it, on a hilly road, where the poor beast, who was sure to be\r\nhalf-starved, would have to be allowed long and frequent rests. The\r\nroad lay some distance from the sea, bordered on either side by shrubs\r\nand stunted trees, sparsely covered with meagre foliage, all turning\r\naway from the North, with their branches looking in the semi-darkness,\r\nlike stiff, ghostly hair, blown by a perpetual wind.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the moon showed no desire to peep between the clouds, and\r\nMarguerite hugging the edge of the road, and keeping close to the low\r\nline of shrubs, was fairly safe from view. Everything around her was so\r\nstill: only from far, very far away, there came like a long, soft moan,\r\nthe sound of the distant sea.\r\n\r\nThe air was keen and full of brine; after that enforced period of\r\ninactivity, inside the evil-smelling, squalid inn, Marguerite would\r\nhave enjoyed the sweet scent of this autumnal night, and the distant\r\nmelancholy rumble of the waves; she would have revelled in the calm and\r\nstillness of this lonely spot, a calm, broken only at intervals by the\r\nstrident and mournful cry of some distant gull, and by the creaking of\r\nthe wheels, some way down the road: she would have loved the cool\r\natmosphere, the peaceful immensity of Nature, in this lonely part of\r\nthe coast: but her heart was too full of cruel foreboding, of a great\r\nache and longing for a being who had become infinitely dear to her.\r\n\r\nHer feet slipped on the grassy bank, for she thought it safest not to\r\nwalk near the centre of the road, and she found it difficult to keep up\r\na sharp pace along the muddy incline. She even thought it best not to\r\nkeep too near to the cart; everything was so still, that the rumble of\r\nthe wheels could not fail to be a safe guide.\r\n\r\nThe loneliness was absolute. Already the few dim lights of Calais lay\r\nfar behind, and on this road there was not a sign of human habitation,\r\nnot even the hut of a fisherman or of a woodcutter anywhere near; far\r\naway on her right was the edge of the cliff, below it the rough beach,\r\nagainst which the incoming tide was dashing itself with its constant,\r\ndistant murmur. And ahead the rumble of the wheels, bearing an\r\nimplacable enemy to his triumph.\r\n\r\nMarguerite wondered at what particular spot, on this lonely coast,\r\nPercy could be at this moment. Not very far surely, for he had had less\r\nthan a quarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s start of Chauvelin. She wondered if he knew\r\nthat in this cool, ocean-scented bit of France, there lurked many\r\nspies, all eager to sight his tall figure, to track him to where his\r\nunsuspecting friends waited for him, and then, to close the net over\r\nhim and them.\r\n\r\nChauvelin, on ahead, jolted and jostled in the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle, was\r\nnursing comfortable thoughts. He rubbed his hands together, with\r\ncontent, as he thought of the web which he had woven, and through which\r\nthat ubiquitous and daring Englishman could not hope to escape. As the\r\ntime went on, and the old Jew drove him leisurely but surely along the\r\ndark road, he felt more and more eager for the grand finale of this\r\nexciting chase after the mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel.\r\n The capture of the audacious plotter would be the finest leaf in\r\n Citoyen Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s wreath of glory. Caught, red-handed, on the spot,\r\n in the very act of aiding and abetting the traitors against the\r\n Republic of France, the Englishman could claim no protection from his\r\n own country. Chauvelin had, in any case, fully made up his mind that\r\n all intervention should come too late.\r\n\r\nNever for a moment did the slightest remorse enter his heart, as to the\r\nterrible position in which he had placed the unfortunate wife, who had\r\nunconsciously betrayed her husband. As a matter of fact, Chauvelin had\r\nceased even to think of her: she had been a useful tool, that was all.\r\n\r\nThe Jew\xe2\x80\x99s lean nag did little more than walk. She was going along at a\r\nslow jog trot, and her driver had to give her long and frequent halts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we a long way yet from Miquelon?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Chauvelin from time to\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot very far, your Honour,\xe2\x80\x9d was the uniform placid reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have not yet come across your friend and mine, lying in a heap in\r\nthe roadway,\xe2\x80\x9d was Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s sarcastic comment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatience, noble Excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the son of Moses, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are\r\nahead of us. I can see the imprint of the cart wheels, driven by that\r\ntraitor, that son of the Amalekite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure of the road?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs sure as I am of the presence of those ten gold pieces in the noble\r\nExcellency\xe2\x80\x99s pockets, which I trust will presently be mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I have shaken hands with my friend the tall stranger, they\r\nwill certainly be yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark, what was that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew suddenly.\r\n\r\nThrough the stillness, which had been absolute, there could now be\r\nheard distinctly the sound of horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs on the muddy road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are soldiers,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in an awed whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a moment, I want to hear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin.\r\n\r\nMarguerite had also heard the sound of galloping hoofs, coming towards\r\nthe cart, and towards herself. For some time she had been on the alert\r\nthinking that Desgas and his squad would soon overtake them, but these\r\ncame from the opposite direction, presumably from Miquelon. The\r\ndarkness lent her sufficient cover. She had perceived that the cart had\r\nstopped, and with utmost caution, treading noiselessly on the soft\r\nroad, she crept a little nearer.\r\n\r\nHer heart was beating fast, she was trembling in every limb; already\r\nshe had guessed what news these mounted men would bring. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery\r\nstranger on these roads or on the beach must be shadowed, especially if\r\nhe be tall or stoops as if he would disguise his height; when sighted a\r\nmounted messenger must at once ride back and report.\xe2\x80\x9d Those had been\r\nChauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s orders. Had then the tall stranger been sighted, and was\r\nthis the mounted messenger, come to bring the great news, that the\r\nhunted hare had run its head into the noose at last?\r\n\r\nMarguerite, realising that the cart had come to a standstill, managed\r\nto slip nearer to it in the darkness; she crept close up, hoping to get\r\nwithin earshot, to hear what the messenger had to say.\r\n\r\nShe heard the quick words of challenge\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLibert\xc3\xa9, Fraternit\xc3\xa9, Egalit\xc3\xa9!\xe2\x80\x9d then Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s quick query:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat news?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo men on horseback had halted beside the vehicle.\r\n\r\nMarguerite could see them silhouetted against the midnight sky. She\r\ncould hear their voices, and the snorting of their horses, and now,\r\nbehind her, some little distance off, the regular and measured tread of\r\na body of advancing men: Desgas and his soldiers.\r\n\r\nThere had been a long pause, during which, no doubt, Chauvelin\r\nsatisfied the men as to his identity, for presently, questions and\r\nanswers followed each other in quick succession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen the stranger?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Chauvelin, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, citoyen, we have seen no tall stranger; we came by the edge of the\r\ncliff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLess than a quarter of a league beyond Miquelon, we came across a\r\nrough construction of wood, which looked like the hut of a fisherman,\r\nwhere he might keep his tools and nets. When we first sighted it, it\r\nseemed to be empty, and at first we thought that there was nothing\r\nsuspicious about it, until we saw some smoke issuing through an\r\naperture at the side. I dismounted and crept close to it. It was then\r\nempty, but in one corner of the hut, there was a charcoal fire, and a\r\ncouple of stools were also in the hut. I consulted with my comrades,\r\nand we decided that they should take cover with the horses, well out of\r\nsight, and that I should remain on the watch, which I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! and did you see anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout half an hour later, I heard voices, citoyen, and presently, two\r\nmen came along towards the edge of the cliff; they seemed to me to have\r\ncome from the Lille Road. One was young, the other quite old. They were\r\ntalking in a whisper, to one another, and I could not hear what they\r\nsaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne was young, the other quite old. Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s aching heart almost stopped\r\nbeating as she listened: was the young one Armand?\xe2\x80\x94her brother?\xe2\x80\x94and the old one\r\nde Tournay\xe2\x80\x94were they the two fugitives who, unconsciously, were used as a\r\ndecoy, to entrap their fearless and noble rescuer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe two men presently went into the hut,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the soldier,\r\nwhilst Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s aching nerves seemed to catch the sound of\r\nChauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s triumphant chuckle, \xe2\x80\x9cand I crept nearer to it then. The hut\r\nis very roughly built, and I caught snatches of their conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x94Quick!\xe2\x80\x94What did you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old man asked the young one if he were sure that was the right\r\nplace. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99tis the place sure enough,\xe2\x80\x99 and by the\r\nlight of the charcoal fire he showed to his companion a paper, which he\r\ncarried. \xe2\x80\x98Here is the plan,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98which he gave me before I left\r\nLondon. We were to adhere strictly to that plan, unless I had contrary\r\norders, and I have had none. Here is the road we followed, see . . .\r\nhere the fork . . . here we cut across the St. Martin Road . . . and\r\nhere is the footpath which brought us to the edge of the cliff.\xe2\x80\x99 I must\r\nhave made a slight noise then, for the young man came to the door of\r\nthe hut, and peered anxiously all round him. When he again joined his\r\ncompanion, they whispered so low, that I could no longer hear them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x94and?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Chauvelin, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were six of us altogether, patrolling that part of the beach, so\r\nwe consulted together, and thought it best that four should remain\r\nbehind and keep the hut in sight, and I and my comrade rode back at\r\nonce to make report of what we had seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw nothing of the tall stranger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, citoyen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your comrades see him, what would they do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot lose sight of him for a moment, and if he showed signs of escape,\r\nor any boat came in sight, they would close in on him, and, if\r\nnecessary, they would shoot: the firing would bring the rest of the\r\npatrol to the spot. In any case they would not let the stranger go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye! but I did not want the stranger hurt\xe2\x80\x94not just yet,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured\r\nChauvelin, savagely, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there, you\xe2\x80\x99ve done your best. The Fates grant\r\nthat I may not be too late . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe met half a dozen men just now, who have been patrolling this road\r\nfor several hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have seen no stranger either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet he is on ahead somewhere, in a cart or else . . . . Here! there is\r\nnot a moment to lose. How far is that hut from here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout a couple of leagues, citoyen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can find it again?\xe2\x80\x94at once?\xe2\x80\x94without hesitation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have absolutely no doubt, citoyen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe footpath, to the edge of the cliff?\xe2\x80\x94Even in the dark?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not a dark night, citoyen, and I know I can find my way,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nrepeated the soldier firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFall in behind then. Let your comrade take both your horses back to\r\nCalais. You won\xe2\x80\x99t want them. Keep beside the cart, and direct the Jew\r\nto drive straight ahead; then stop him, within a quarter of a league of\r\nthe footpath; see that he takes the most direct road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhilst Chauvelin spoke, Desgas and his men were fast approaching, and\r\nMarguerite could hear their footsteps within a hundred yards behind her\r\nnow. She thought it unsafe to stay where she was, and unnecessary too,\r\nas she had heard enough. She seemed suddenly to have lost all faculty\r\neven for suffering: her heart, her nerves, her brain seemed to have\r\nbecome numb after all these hours of ceaseless anguish, culminating in\r\nthis awful despair.\r\n\r\nFor now there was absolutely not the faintest hope. Within two short\r\nleagues of this spot, the fugitives were waiting for their brave\r\ndeliverer. He was on his way, somewhere on this lonely road, and\r\npresently he would join them; then the well-laid trap would close, two\r\ndozen men, led by one whose hatred was as deadly as his cunning was\r\nmalicious, would close round the small band of fugitives, and their\r\ndaring leader. They would all be captured. Armand, according to\r\nChauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s pledged word, would be restored to her, but her husband,\r\nPercy, whom with every breath she drew she seemed to love and worship\r\nmore and more, he would fall into the hands of a remorseless enemy, who\r\nhad no pity for a brave heart, no admiration for the courage of a noble\r\nsoul, who would show nothing but hatred for the cunning antagonist, who\r\nhad baffled him so long.\r\n\r\nShe heard the soldier giving a few brief directions to the Jew, then\r\nshe retired quickly to the edge of the road, and cowered behind some\r\nlow shrubs, whilst Desgas and his men came up.\r\n\r\nAll fell in noiselessly behind the cart, and slowly they all started\r\ndown the dark road. Marguerite waited until she reckoned that they were\r\nwell outside the range of earshot, then, she too in the darkness, which\r\nsuddenly seemed to have become more intense, crept noiselessly along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nTHE P\xc3\x88RE BLANCHARD\xe2\x80\x99S HUT\r\n\r\n\r\nAs in a dream, Marguerite followed on; the web was drawing more and\r\nmore tightly every moment round the beloved life, which had become\r\ndearer than all. To see her husband once again, to tell him how she had\r\nsuffered, how much she had wronged, and how little understood him, had\r\nbecome now her only aim. She had abandoned all hope of saving him: she\r\nsaw him gradually hemmed in on all sides, and, in despair, she gazed\r\nround her into the darkness, and wondered whence he would presently\r\ncome, to fall into the death-trap which his relentless enemy had\r\nprepared for him.\r\n\r\nThe distant roar of the waves now made her shudder; the occasional\r\ndismal cry of an owl, or a sea-gull, filled her with unspeakable\r\nhorror. She thought of the ravenous beasts\xe2\x80\x94in human shape\xe2\x80\x94who lay in\r\nwait for their prey, and destroyed them, as mercilessly as any hungry\r\nwolf, for the satisfaction of their own appetite of hate. Marguerite\r\nwas not afraid of the darkness, she only feared that man, on ahead, who\r\nwas sitting at the bottom of a rough wooden cart, nursing thoughts of\r\nvengeance, which would have made the very demons in hell chuckle with\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nHer feet were sore. Her knees shook under her, from sheer bodily\r\nfatigue. For days now she had lived in a wild turmoil of excitement;\r\nshe had not had a quiet rest for three nights; now, she had walked on a\r\nslippery road for nearly two hours, and yet her determination never\r\nswerved for a moment. She would see her husband, tell him all, and, if\r\nhe was ready to forgive the crime, which she had committed in her blind\r\nignorance, she would yet have the happiness of dying by his side.\r\n\r\nShe must have walked on almost in a trance, instinct alone keeping her\r\nup, and guiding her in the wake of the enemy, when suddenly her ears,\r\nattuned to the slightest sound, by that same blind instinct, told her\r\nthat the cart had stopped, and that the soldiers had halted. They had\r\ncome to their destination. No doubt on the right, somewhere close\r\nahead, was the footpath that led to the edge of the cliff and to the\r\nhut.\r\n\r\nHeedless of any risks, she crept quite close up to where Chauvelin\r\nstood, surrounded by his little troop: he had descended from the cart,\r\nand was giving some orders to the men. These she wanted to hear: what\r\nlittle chance she yet had, of being useful to Percy, consisted in\r\nhearing absolutely every word of his enemy\xe2\x80\x99s plans.\r\n\r\nThe spot where all the party had halted must have lain some eight\r\nhundred m\xc3\xa8tres from the coast; the sound of the sea came only very\r\nfaintly, as from a distance. Chauvelin and Desgas, followed by the\r\nsoldiers, had turned off sharply to the right of the road, apparently\r\non to the footpath, which led to the cliffs. The Jew had remained on\r\nthe road, with his cart and nag.\r\n\r\nMarguerite, with infinite caution, and literally crawling on her hands\r\nand knees, had also turned off to the right: to accomplish this she had\r\nto creep through the rough, low shrubs, trying to make as little noise\r\nas possible as she went along, tearing her face and hands against the\r\ndry twigs, intent only upon hearing without being seen or heard.\r\nFortunately\xe2\x80\x94as is usual in this part of France\xe2\x80\x94the footpath was\r\nbordered by a low, rough hedge, beyond which was a dry ditch, filled\r\nwith coarse grass. In this Marguerite managed to find shelter; she was\r\nquite hidden from view, yet could contrive to get within three yards of\r\nwhere Chauvelin stood, giving orders to his men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying in a low and peremptory whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere is the\r\nP\xc3\xa8re Blanchard\xe2\x80\x99s hut?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout eight hundred m\xc3\xa8tres from here, along the footpath,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nsoldier who had lately been directing the party, \xe2\x80\x9cand half-way down the\r\ncliff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. You shall lead us. Before we begin to descend the cliff,\r\nyou shall creep down to the hut, as noiselessly as possible, and\r\nascertain if the traitor royalists are there? Do you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand, citoyen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow listen very attentively, all of you,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Chauvelin,\r\nimpressively, and addressing the soldiers collectively, \xe2\x80\x9cfor after this\r\nwe may not be able to exchange another word, so remember every syllable\r\nI utter, as if your very lives depended on your memory. Perhaps they\r\ndo,\xe2\x80\x9d he added drily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe listen, citoyen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Desgas, \xe2\x80\x9cand a soldier of the Republic never\r\nforgets an order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, who have crept up to the hut, will try to peep inside. If an\r\nEnglishman is there with those traitors, a man who is tall above the\r\naverage, or who stoops as if he would disguise his height, then give a\r\nsharp, quick whistle as a signal to your comrades. All of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, once more speaking to the soldiers collectively, \xe2\x80\x9cthen quickly\r\nsurround and rush into the hut, and each seize one of the men there,\r\nbefore they have time to draw their firearms; if any of them struggle,\r\nshoot at their legs or arms, but on no account kill the tall man. Do\r\nyou understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe understand, citoyen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man who is tall above the average is probably also strong above\r\nthe average; it will take four or five of you at least to overpower\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a little pause, then Chauvelin continued,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the royalist traitors are still alone, which is more than likely to\r\nbe the case, then warn your comrades who are lying in wait there, and\r\nall of you creep and take cover behind the rocks and boulders round the\r\nhut, and wait there, in dead silence, until the tall Englishman\r\narrives; then only rush the hut, when he is safely within its doors.\r\nBut remember that you must be as silent as the wolf is at night, when\r\nhe prowls around the pens. I do not wish those royalists to be on the\r\nalert\xe2\x80\x94the firing of a pistol, a shriek or call on their part would be\r\nsufficient, perhaps, to warn the tall personage to keep clear of the\r\ncliffs, and of the hut, and,\xe2\x80\x9d he added emphatically, \xe2\x80\x9cit is the tall\r\nEnglishman whom it is your duty to capture to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall be implicitly obeyed, citoyen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen get along as noiselessly as possible, and I will follow you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the Jew, citoyen?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Desgas, as silently like noiseless\r\nshadows, one by one the soldiers began to creep along the rough and\r\nnarrow footpath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes; I had forgotten the Jew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin, and, turning\r\ntowards the Jew, he called him peremptorily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, you . . . Aaron, Moses, Abraham, or whatever your confounded\r\nname may be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the old man, who had quietly stood beside his\r\nlean nag, as far away from the soldiers as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBenjamin Rosenbaum, so it please your Honour,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied humbly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not please me to hear your voice, but it does please me to\r\ngive you certain orders, which you will find it wise to obey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it please your Honour . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your confounded tongue. You shall stay here, do you hear? with\r\nyour horse and cart until our return. You are on no account to utter\r\nthe faintest sound, or even to breathe louder than you can help; nor\r\nare you, on any consideration whatever, to leave your post, until I\r\ngive you orders to do so. Do you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your Honour\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d protested the Jew pitiably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no question of \xe2\x80\x98but\xe2\x80\x99 or of any argument,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin, in\r\na tone that made the timid old man tremble from head to foot. \xe2\x80\x9cIf, when\r\nI return, I do not find you here, I most solemnly assure you that,\r\nwherever you may try to hide yourself, I can find you, and that\r\npunishment swift, sure and terrible, will sooner or later overtake you.\r\nDo you hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your Excellency . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said, do you hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soldiers had all crept away; the three men stood alone together in\r\nthe dark and lonely road, with Marguerite there, behind the hedge,\r\nlistening to Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s orders, as she would to her own death\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard your Honour,\xe2\x80\x9d protested the Jew again, while he tried to draw\r\nnearer to Chauvelin, \xe2\x80\x9cand I swear by Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that I\r\nwould obey your Honour most absolutely, and that I would not move from\r\nthis place until your Honour once more deigned to shed the light of\r\nyour countenance upon your humble servant; but remember, your Honour, I\r\nam a poor old man; my nerves are not as strong as those of a young\r\nsoldier. If midnight marauders should come prowling round this lonely\r\nroad, I might scream or run in my fright! And is my life to be forfeit,\r\nis some terrible punishment to come on my poor old head for that which\r\nI cannot help?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew seemed in real distress; he was shaking from head to foot.\r\nClearly he was not the man to be left by himself on this lonely road.\r\nThe man spoke truly; he might unwittingly, in sheer terror, utter the\r\nshriek that might prove a warning to the wily Scarlet Pimpernel.\r\n\r\nChauvelin reflected for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill your horse and cart be safe alone, here, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nroughly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy, citoyen,\xe2\x80\x9d here interposed Desgas, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they will be safer\r\nwithout that dirty, cowardly Jew than with him. There seems no doubt\r\nthat, if he gets scared, he will either make a bolt of it, or shriek\r\nhis head off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what am I to do with the brute?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you send him back to Calais, citoyen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, for we shall want him to drive back the wounded presently,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nChauvelin, with grim significance.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause again\xe2\x80\x94Desgas, waiting for the decision of his chief,\r\nand the old Jew whining beside his nag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you lazy, lumbering old coward,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin at last, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nhad better shuffle along behind us. Here, Citoyen Desgas, tie this\r\nhandkerchief tightly round the fellow\xe2\x80\x99s mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChauvelin handed a scarf to Desgas, who solemnly began winding it round\r\nthe Jew\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. Meekly Benjamin Rosenbaum allowed himself to be\r\ngagged; he, evidently, preferred this uncomfortable state to that of\r\nbeing left alone, on the dark St. Martin Road. Then the three men fell\r\nin line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick!\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin, impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have already wasted much\r\nvaluable time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the firm footsteps of Chauvelin and Desgas, the shuffling gait of\r\nthe old Jew, soon died away along the footpath.\r\n\r\nMarguerite had not lost a single one of Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s words of command.\r\nHer every nerve was strained to completely grasp the situation first,\r\nthen to make a final appeal to those wits which had so often been\r\ncalled the sharpest in Europe, and which alone might be of service now.\r\n\r\nCertainly the situation was desperate enough; a tiny band of\r\nunsuspecting men, quietly awaiting the arrival of their rescuer, who\r\nwas equally unconscious of the trap laid for them all. It seemed so\r\nhorrible, this net, as it were drawn in a circle, at dead of night, on\r\na lonely beach, round a few defenceless men, defenceless because they\r\nwere tricked and unsuspecting; of these one was the husband she\r\nidolised, another the brother she loved. She vaguely wondered who the\r\nothers were, who were also calmly waiting for the Scarlet Pimpernel,\r\nwhile death lurked behind every boulder of the cliffs.\r\n\r\nFor the moment she could do nothing but follow the soldiers and\r\nChauvelin. She feared to lose her way, or she would have rushed forward\r\nand found that wooden hut, and perhaps been in time to warn the\r\nfugitives and their brave deliverer yet.\r\n\r\nFor a second, the thought flashed through her mind of uttering the\r\npiercing shrieks, which Chauvelin seemed to dread, as a possible\r\nwarning to the Scarlet Pimpernel and his friends\xe2\x80\x94in the wild hope that\r\nthey would hear, and have yet time to escape before it was too late.\r\nBut she did not know how far from the edge of the cliff she was; she\r\ndid not know if her shrieks would reach the ears of the doomed men. Her\r\neffort might be premature, and she would never be allowed to make\r\nanother. Her mouth would be securely gagged, like that of the Jew, and\r\nshe, a helpless prisoner in the hands of Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s men.\r\n\r\nLike a ghost she flitted noiselessly behind that hedge: she had taken\r\nher shoes off, and her stockings were by now torn off her feet. She\r\nfelt neither soreness nor weariness; indomitable will to reach her\r\nhusband in spite of adverse Fate, and of a cunning enemy, killed all\r\nsense of bodily pain within her, and rendered her instincts doubly\r\nacute.\r\n\r\nShe heard nothing save the soft and measured footsteps of Percy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenemies on in front; she saw nothing but\xe2\x80\x94in her mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye\xe2\x80\x94that wooden\r\nhut, and he, her husband, walking blindly to his doom.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, those same keen instincts within her made her pause in her\r\nmad haste, and cower still further within the shadow of the hedge. The\r\nmoon, which had proved a friend to her by remaining hidden behind a\r\nbank of clouds, now emerged in all the glory of an early autumn night,\r\nand in a moment flooded the weird and lonely landscape with a rush of\r\nbrilliant light.\r\n\r\nThere, not two hundred m\xc3\xa8tres ahead, was the edge of the cliff, and\r\nbelow, stretching far away to free and happy England, the sea rolled on\r\nsmoothly and peaceably. Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s gaze rested for an instant on the\r\nbrilliant, silvery waters; and as she gazed, her heart, which had been\r\nnumb with pain for all these hours, seemed to soften and distend, and\r\nher eyes filled with hot tears: not three miles away, with white sails\r\nset, a graceful schooner lay in wait.\r\n\r\nMarguerite had guessed rather than recognised her. It was the _Day\r\nDream_, Percy\xe2\x80\x99s favourite yacht, with old Briggs, that prince of\r\nskippers, aboard, and all her crew of British sailors: her white sails,\r\nglistening in the moonlight, seemed to convey a message to Marguerite\r\nof joy and hope, which yet she feared could never be. She waited there,\r\nout at sea, waited for her master, like a beautiful white bird all\r\nready to take flight, and he would never reach her, never see her\r\nsmooth deck again, never gaze any more on the white cliffs of England,\r\nthe land of liberty and of hope.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the schooner seemed to infuse into the poor, wearied woman\r\nthe superhuman strength of despair. There was the edge of the cliff,\r\nand some way below was the hut, where presently, her husband would meet\r\nhis death. But the moon was out: she could see her way now: she would\r\nsee the hut from a distance, run to it, rouse them all, warn them at\r\nany rate to be prepared and to sell their lives dearly, rather than be\r\ncaught like so many rats in a hole.\r\n\r\nShe stumbled on behind the hedge in the low, thick grass of the ditch.\r\nShe must have run on very fast, and had outdistanced Chauvelin and\r\nDesgas, for presently she reached the edge of the cliff, and heard\r\ntheir footsteps distinctly behind her. But only a very few yards away,\r\nand now the moonlight was full upon her, her figure must have been\r\ndistinctly silhouetted against the silvery background of the sea.\r\n\r\nOnly for a moment, though; the next she had cowered, like some animal\r\ndoubled up within itself. She peeped down the great rugged cliffs\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndescent would be easy enough, as they were not precipitous, and the\r\ngreat boulders afforded plenty of foothold. Suddenly, as she gazed, she\r\nsaw at some little distance on her left, and about midway down the\r\ncliffs, a rough wooden construction, through the walls of which a tiny\r\nred light glimmered like a beacon. Her very heart seemed to stand\r\nstill, the eagerness of joy was so great that it felt like an awful\r\npain.\r\n\r\nShe could not gauge how distant the hut was, but without hesitation she\r\nbegan the steep descent, creeping from boulder to boulder, caring\r\nnothing for the enemy behind, or for the soldiers, who evidently had\r\nall taken cover since the tall Englishman had not yet appeared.\r\n\r\nOn she pressed, forgetting the deadly foe on her track, running,\r\nstumbling, foot-sore, half-dazed, but still on . . . When, suddenly, a\r\ncrevice, or stone, or slippery bit of rock, threw her violently to the\r\nground. She struggled again to her feet, and started running forward\r\nonce more to give them that timely warning, to beg them to flee before\r\nhe came, and to tell him to keep away\xe2\x80\x94away from this death-trap\xe2\x80\x94away\r\nfrom this awful doom. But now she realised that other steps, quicker\r\nthan her own, were already close at her heels. The next instant a hand\r\ndragged at her skirt, and she was down on her knees again, whilst\r\nsomething was wound round her mouth to prevent her uttering a scream.\r\n\r\nBewildered, half frantic with the bitterness of disappointment, she\r\nlooked round her helplessly, and, bending down quite close to her, she\r\nsaw through the mist, which seemed to gather round her, a pair of keen,\r\nmalicious eyes, which appeared to her excited brain to have a weird,\r\nsupernatural green light in them.\r\n She lay in the shadow of a great boulder; Chauvelin could not see her\r\n features, but he passed his thin, white fingers over her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cby all the Saints in the calendar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot let her loose, that\xe2\x80\x99s certain,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwonder now . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly he paused, and after a few seconds of deadly silence, he gave\r\nforth a long, low, curious chuckle, while once again Marguerite felt,\r\nwith a horrible shudder, his thin fingers wandering over her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me! dear me!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, with affected gallantry, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is\r\nindeed a charming surprise,\xe2\x80\x9d and Marguerite felt her resistless hand\r\nraised to Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s thin, mocking lips.\r\n\r\nThe situation was indeed grotesque, had it not been at the same time so\r\nfearfully tragic: the poor, weary woman, broken in spirit, and half\r\nfrantic with the bitterness of her disappointment, receiving on her\r\nknees the _banal_ gallantries of her deadly enemy.\r\n\r\nHer senses were leaving her; half choked with the tight grip round her\r\nmouth, she had no strength to move or to utter the faintest sound. The\r\nexcitement which all along had kept up her delicate body seemed at once\r\nto have subsided, and the feeling of blank despair to have completely\r\nparalysed her brain and nerves.\r\n\r\nChauvelin must have given some directions, which she was too dazed to\r\nhear, for she felt herself lifted from off her feet: the bandage round\r\nher mouth was made more secure, and a pair of strong arms carried her\r\ntowards that tiny, red light, on ahead, which she had looked upon as a\r\nbeacon and the last faint glimmer of hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nTRAPPED\r\n\r\n\r\nShe did not know how long she was thus carried along, she had lost all\r\nnotion of time and space, and for a few seconds tired nature,\r\nmercifully, deprived her of consciousness.\r\n\r\nWhen she once more realised her state, she felt that she was placed\r\nwith some degree of comfort upon a man\xe2\x80\x99s coat, with her back resting\r\nagainst a fragment of rock. The moon was hidden again behind some\r\nclouds, and the darkness seemed in comparison more intense. The sea was\r\nroaring some two hundred feet below her, and on looking all round she\r\ncould no longer see any vestige of the tiny glimmer of red light.\r\n\r\nThat the end of the journey had been reached, she gathered from the\r\nfact that she heard rapid questions and answers spoken in a whisper\r\nquite close to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are four men in there, citoyen; they are sitting by the fire,\r\nand seem to be waiting quietly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hour?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearly two o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tide?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComing in quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe schooner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObviously an English one, lying some three kilometres out. But we\r\ncannot see her boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave the men taken cover?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, citoyen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will not blunder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will not stir until the tall Englishman comes, then they will\r\nsurround and overpower the five men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight. And the lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill dazed, I fancy. She\xe2\x80\x99s close beside you, citoyen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Jew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gagged, and his legs strapped together. He cannot move or\r\nscream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. Then have your gun ready, in case you want it. Get close to the\r\nhut and leave me to look after the lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDesgas evidently obeyed, for Marguerite heard him creeping away along\r\nthe stony cliff, then she felt that a pair of warm, thin, talon-like\r\nhands took hold of both her own, and held them in a grip of steel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore that handkerchief is removed from your pretty mouth, fair\r\nlady,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Chauvelin close to her ear, \xe2\x80\x9cI think it right to give\r\nyou one small word of warning. What has procured me the honour of being\r\nfollowed across the Channel by so charming a companion, I cannot, of\r\ncourse, conceive, but, if I mistake not, the purpose of this flattering\r\nattention is not one that would commend itself to my vanity, and I\r\nthink that I am right in surmising, moreover, that the first sound\r\nwhich your pretty lips would utter, as soon as the cruel gag is\r\nremoved, would be one that would perhaps prove a warning to the cunning\r\nfox, which I have been at such pains to track to his lair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, while the steel-like grasp seemed to tighten round\r\nher wrist; then he resumed in the same hurried whisper:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInside that hut, if again I am not mistaken, your brother, Armand St.\r\nJust, waits with that traitor de Tournay, and two other men unknown to\r\nyou, for the arrival of the mysterious rescuer, whose identity has for\r\nso long puzzled our Committee of Public Safety\xe2\x80\x94the audacious Scarlet\r\nPimpernel. No doubt if you scream, if there is a scuffle here, if shots\r\nare fired, it is more than likely that the same long legs that brought\r\nthis scarlet enigma here, will as quickly take him to some place of\r\nsafety. The purpose then, for which I have travelled all these miles,\r\nwill remain unaccomplished. On the other hand it only rests with\r\nyourself that your brother\xe2\x80\x94Armand\xe2\x80\x94shall be free to go off with you\r\nto-night if you like, to England, or any other place of safety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite could not utter a sound, as the handkerchief was wound very\r\ntightly round her mouth, but Chauvelin was peering through the darkness\r\nvery closely into her face; no doubt too her hand gave a responsive\r\nappeal to his last suggestion, for presently he continued:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I want you to do to ensure Armand\xe2\x80\x99s safety is a very simple\r\nthing, dear lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s hand seemed to convey to his, in response.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo remain\xe2\x80\x94on this spot, without uttering a sound, until I give you\r\nleave to speak. Ah! but I think you will obey,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with that\r\nfunny dry chuckle of his as Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s whole figure seemed to\r\nstiffen, in defiance of this order, \xe2\x80\x9cfor let me tell you that if you\r\nscream, nay! if you utter one sound, or attempt to move from here, my\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x94there are thirty of them about\xe2\x80\x94will seize St. Just, de Tournay, and\r\ntheir two friends, and shoot them here\xe2\x80\x94by my orders\xe2\x80\x94before your eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite had listened to her implacable enemy\xe2\x80\x99s speech with\r\never-increasing terror. Numbed with physical pain, she yet had\r\nsufficient mental vitality in her to realise the full horror of this\r\nterrible \xe2\x80\x9ceither\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x9d he was once more putting before her; an\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ceither\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x9d ten thousand times more appalling and horrible, than the\r\none he had suggested to her that fatal night at the ball.\r\n\r\nThis time it meant that she should keep still, and allow the husband\r\nshe worshipped to walk unconsciously to his death, or that she should,\r\nby trying to give him a word of warning, which perhaps might even be\r\nunavailing, actually give the signal for her own brother\xe2\x80\x99s death, and\r\nthat of three other unsuspecting men.\r\n\r\nShe could not see Chauvelin, but she could almost feel those keen, pale\r\neyes of his fixed maliciously upon her helpless form, and his hurried,\r\nwhispered words reached her ear, as the death-knell of her last faint,\r\nlingering hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, fair lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he added urbanely, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can have no interest in\r\nanyone save in St. Just, and all you need do for his safety is to\r\nremain where you are, and to keep silent. My men have strict orders to\r\nspare him in every way. As for that enigmatic Scarlet Pimpernel, what\r\nis he to you? Believe me, no warning from you could possibly save him.\r\nAnd now dear lady, let me remove this unpleasant coercion, which has\r\nbeen placed before your pretty mouth. You see I wish you to be\r\nperfectly free, in the choice which you are about to make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer thoughts in a whirl, her temples aching, her nerves paralyzed, her\r\nbody numb with pain, Marguerite sat there, in the darkness which\r\nsurrounded her as with a pall. From where she sat she could not see the\r\nsea, but she heard the incessant mournful murmur of the incoming tide,\r\nwhich spoke of her dead hopes, her lost love, the husband she had with\r\nher own hand betrayed, and sent to his death.\r\n\r\nChauvelin removed the handkerchief from her mouth. She certainly did\r\nnot scream: at that moment, she had no strength to do anything but\r\nbarely to hold herself upright, and to force herself to think.\r\n\r\nOh! think! think! think! of what she should do. The minutes flew on; in\r\nthis awful stillness she could not tell how fast or how slowly; she\r\nheard nothing, she saw nothing: she did not feel the sweet-smelling\r\nautumn air, scented with the briny odour of the sea, she no longer\r\nheard the murmur of the waves, the occasional rattling of a pebble, as\r\nit rolled down some steep incline. More and more unreal did the whole\r\nsituation seem. It was impossible that she, Marguerite Blakeney, the\r\nqueen of London society, should actually be sitting here on this bit of\r\nlonely coast, in the middle of the night, side by side with a most\r\nbitter enemy: and oh! it was not possible that somewhere, not many\r\nhundred feet away perhaps, from where she stood, the being she had once\r\ndespised, but who now, in every moment of this weird, dreamlike life,\r\nbecame more and more dear\xe2\x80\x94it was not possible that _he_ was\r\nunconsciously, even now walking to his doom, whilst she did nothing to\r\nsave him.\r\n\r\nWhy did she not with unearthly screams, that would re-echo from one end\r\nof the lonely beach to the other, send out a warning to him to desist,\r\nto retrace his steps, for death lurked here whilst he advanced? Once or\r\ntwice the screams rose to her throat\xe2\x80\x94as if by instinct: then, before\r\nher eyes there stood the awful alternative: her brother and those three\r\nmen shot before her eyes, practically by her orders: she their\r\nmurderer.\r\n\r\nOh! that fiend in human shape, next to her, knew human\xe2\x80\x94female\xe2\x80\x94nature\r\nwell. He had played upon her feelings as a skilful musician plays upon\r\nan instrument. He had gauged her very thoughts to a nicety.\r\n\r\nShe could not give that signal\xe2\x80\x94for she was weak, and she was a woman.\r\nHow could she deliberately order Armand to be shot before her eyes, to\r\nhave his dear blood upon her head, he dying perhaps with a curse on\r\nher, upon his lips. And little Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s father, too! he, an old man;\r\nand the others!\xe2\x80\x94oh! it was all too, too horrible.\r\n\r\nWait! wait! wait! how long? The early morning hours sped on, and yet it\r\nwas not dawn: the sea continued its incessant mournful murmur, the\r\nautumnal breeze sighed gently in the night: the lonely beach was\r\nsilent, even as the grave.\r\n\r\nSuddenly from somewhere, not very far away, a cheerful, strong voice\r\nwas heard singing \xe2\x80\x9cGod save the King!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nTHE SCHOONER\r\n\r\n\r\nMarguerite\xe2\x80\x99s aching heart stood still. She felt, more than she heard,\r\nthe men on the watch preparing for the fight. Her senses told her that\r\neach, with sword in hand, was crouching, ready for the spring.\r\n\r\nThe voice came nearer and nearer; in the vast immensity of these lonely\r\ncliffs, with the loud murmur of the sea below, it was impossible to say\r\nhow near, or how far, nor yet from which direction came that cheerful\r\nsinger, who sang to God to save his King, whilst he himself was in such\r\ndeadly danger. Faint at first, the voice grew louder and louder; from\r\ntime to time a small pebble detached itself apparently from beneath the\r\nfirm tread of the singer, and went rolling down the rocky cliffs to the\r\nbeach below.\r\n\r\nMarguerite as she heard, felt that her very life was slipping away, as\r\nif when that voice drew nearer, when that singer became entrapped . . .\r\n\r\nShe distinctly heard the click of Desgas\xe2\x80\x99 gun close to her. . . .\r\n\r\nNo! no! no! no! Oh, God in heaven! this cannot be! let Armand\xe2\x80\x99s blood\r\nthen be upon her own head! let her be branded as his murderer! let even\r\nhe, whom she loved, despise and loathe her for this, but God! oh God!\r\nsave him at any cost!\r\n\r\nWith a wild shriek, she sprang to her feet, and darted round the rock,\r\nagainst which she had been cowering; she saw the little red gleam\r\nthrough the chinks of the hut; she ran up to it and fell against its\r\nwooden walls, which she began to hammer with clenched fists in an\r\nalmost maniacal frenzy, while she shouted,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmand! Armand! for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake fire! your leader is near! he is\r\ncoming! he is betrayed! Armand! Armand! fire in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was seized and thrown to the ground. She lay there moaning,\r\nbruised, not caring, but still half-sobbing, half-shrieking,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPercy, my husband, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake fly! Armand! Armand! why don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nfire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of you stop that woman screaming,\xe2\x80\x9d hissed Chauvelin, who hardly\r\ncould refrain from striking her.\r\n\r\nSomething was thrown over her face; she could not breathe, and perforce\r\nshe was silent.\r\n\r\nThe bold singer, too, had become silent, warned, no doubt, of his\r\nimpending danger by Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s frantic shrieks. The men had sprung to\r\ntheir feet, there was no need for further silence on their part; the\r\nvery cliffs echoed the poor, heart-broken woman\xe2\x80\x99s screams.\r\n\r\nChauvelin, with a muttered oath, which boded no good to her, who had\r\ndared to upset his most cherished plans, had hastily shouted the word\r\nof command,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInto it, my men, and let no one escape from that hut alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe moon had once more emerged from between the clouds: the darkness on\r\nthe cliffs had gone, giving place once more to brilliant, silvery\r\nlight. Some of the soldiers had rushed to the rough, wooden door of the\r\nhut, whilst one of them kept guard over Marguerite.\r\n\r\nThe door was partially open; one of the soldiers pushed it further, but\r\nwithin all was darkness, the charcoal fire only lighting with a dim,\r\nred light the furthest corner of the hut. The soldiers paused\r\nautomatically at the door, like machines waiting for further orders.\r\n\r\nChauvelin, who was prepared for a violent onslaught from within, and\r\nfor a vigorous resistance from the four fugitives, under cover of the\r\ndarkness, was for the moment paralyzed with astonishment when he saw\r\nthe soldiers standing there at attention, like sentries on guard,\r\nwhilst not a sound proceeded from the hut.\r\n\r\nFilled with strange, anxious foreboding, he, too, went to the door of\r\nthe hut, and peering into the gloom, he asked quickly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the meaning of this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, citoyen, that there is no one there now,\xe2\x80\x9d replied one of the\r\nsoldiers imperturbably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not let those four men go?\xe2\x80\x9d thundered Chauvelin, menacingly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ordered you to let no man escape alive!\xe2\x80\x94Quick, after them all of\r\nyou! Quick, in every direction!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men, obedient as machines, rushed down the rocky incline towards\r\nthe beach, some going off to right and left, as fast as their feet\r\ncould carry them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and your men will pay with your lives for this blunder, citoyen\r\nsergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin viciously to the sergeant who had been in\r\ncharge of the men; \xe2\x80\x9cand you, too, citoyen,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning with a\r\nsnarl to Desgas, \xe2\x80\x9cfor disobeying my orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ordered us to wait, citoyen, until the tall Englishman arrived and\r\njoined the four men in the hut. No one came,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant\r\nsullenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I ordered you just now, when the woman screamed, to rush in and\r\nlet no one escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, citoyen, the four men who were there before had been gone some\r\ntime, I think . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think?\xe2\x80\x94You? . . .\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin, almost choking with fury, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nyou let them go . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ordered us to wait, citoyen,\xe2\x80\x9d protested the sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cand to\r\nimplicitly obey your commands on pain of death. We waited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard the men creep out of the hut, not many minutes after we took\r\ncover, and long before the woman screamed,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as Chauvelin\r\nseemed still quite speechless with rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark!\xe2\x80\x9d said Desgas suddenly.\r\n\r\nIn the distance the sound of repeated firing was heard. Chauvelin tried\r\nto peer along the beach below, but as luck would have it, the fitful\r\nmoon once more hid her light behind a bank of clouds, and he could see\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of you go into the hut and strike a light,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered at last.\r\n\r\nStolidly the sergeant obeyed: he went up to the charcoal fire and lit\r\nthe small lantern he carried in his belt; it was evident that the hut\r\nwas quite empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich way did they go?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Chauvelin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not tell, citoyen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant; \xe2\x80\x9cthey went straight\r\ndown the cliff first, then disappeared behind some boulders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! what was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll three men listened attentively. In the far, very far distance,\r\ncould be heard faintly echoing and already dying away, the quick, sharp\r\nsplash of half a dozen oars. Chauvelin took out his handkerchief and\r\nwiped the perspiration from his forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe schooner\xe2\x80\x99s boat!\xe2\x80\x9d was all he gasped.\r\n\r\nEvidently Armand St. Just and his three companions had managed to creep\r\nalong the side of the cliffs, whilst the men, like true soldiers of the\r\nwell-drilled Republican army, had with blind obedience, and in fear of\r\ntheir lives, implicitly obeyed Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s orders\xe2\x80\x94to wait for the tall\r\nEnglishman, who was the important capture.\r\n\r\nThey had no doubt reached one of the creeks which jut far out to sea on\r\nthis coast at intervals; behind this, the boat of the _Day Dream_ must\r\nhave been on the look-out for them, and they were by now safely on\r\nboard the British schooner.\r\n\r\nAs if to confirm this last supposition, the dull boom of a gun was\r\nheard from out at sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe schooner, citoyen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Desgas, quietly; \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt needed all Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s nerve and presence of mind not to give way to\r\na useless and undignified access of rage. There was no doubt now, that\r\nonce again, that accursed British head had completely outwitted him.\r\nHow he had contrived to reach the hut, without being seen by one of the\r\nthirty soldiers who guarded the spot, was more than Chauvelin could\r\nconceive. That he had done so before the thirty men had arrived on the\r\ncliff was, of course, fairly clear, but how he had come over in Reuben\r\nGoldstein\xe2\x80\x99s cart, all the way from Calais, without being sighted by the\r\nvarious patrols on duty was impossible of explanation. It really seemed\r\nas if some potent Fate watched over that daring Scarlet Pimpernel, and\r\nhis astute enemy almost felt a superstitious shudder pass through him,\r\nas he looked round at the towering cliffs, and the loneliness of this\r\noutlying coast.\r\n\r\nBut surely this was reality! and the year of grace 1792: there were no\r\nfairies and hobgoblins about. Chauvelin and his thirty men had all\r\nheard with their own ears that accursed voice singing \xe2\x80\x9cGod save the\r\nKing,\xe2\x80\x9d fully twenty minutes _after_ they had all taken cover around the\r\nhut; by that time the four fugitives must have reached the creek, and\r\ngot into the boat, and the nearest creek was more than a mile from the\r\nhut.\r\n\r\nWhere had that daring singer got to? Unless Satan himself had lent him\r\nwings, he could not have covered that mile on a rocky cliff in the\r\nspace of two minutes; and only two minutes had elapsed between his song\r\nand the sound of the boat\xe2\x80\x99s oars away at sea. He must have remained\r\nbehind, and was even now hiding somewhere about the cliffs; the patrols\r\nwere still about, he would still be sighted, no doubt. Chauvelin felt\r\nhopeful once again.\r\n\r\nOne or two of the men, who had run after the fugitives, were now slowly\r\nworking their way up the cliff: one of them reached Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s side,\r\nat the very moment that this hope arose in the astute diplomatist\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were too late, citoyen,\xe2\x80\x9d the soldier said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe reached the beach\r\njust before the moon was hidden by that bank of clouds. The boat had\r\nundoubtedly been on the look-out behind that first creek, a mile off,\r\nbut she had shoved off some time ago, when we got to the beach, and was\r\nalready some way out to sea. We fired after her, but of course, it was\r\nno good. She was making straight and quickly for the schooner. We saw\r\nher very clearly in the moonlight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin, with eager impatience, \xe2\x80\x9cshe had shoved off some\r\ntime ago, you said, and the nearest creek is a mile further on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, citoyen! I ran all the way, straight to the beach, though I\r\nguessed the boat would have waited somewhere near the creek, as the\r\ntide would reach there earliest. The boat must have shoved off some\r\nminutes before the woman began to scream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Some minutes before the woman began to scream! Then Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s hopes\r\n had not deceived him. The Scarlet Pimpernel may have contrived to send\r\n the fugitives on ahead by the boat, but he himself had not had time to\r\n reach it; he was still on shore, and all the roads were well\r\n patrolled. At any rate, all was not yet lost, and would not be, whilst\r\n that impudent Britisher was still on French soil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring the light in here!\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded eagerly, as he once more\r\nentered the hut.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant brought his lantern, and together the two men explored the\r\nlittle place: with a rapid glance Chauvelin noted its contents: the\r\ncauldron placed close under an aperture in the wall, and containing the\r\nlast few dying embers of burned charcoal, a couple of stools,\r\noverturned as if in the haste of sudden departure, then the fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntools and his nets lying in one corner, and beside them, something\r\nsmall and white.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPick that up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin to the sergeant, pointing to this white\r\nscrap, \xe2\x80\x9cand bring it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a crumpled piece of paper, evidently forgotten there by the\r\nfugitives, in their hurry to get away. The sergeant, much awed by the\r\ncitoyen\xe2\x80\x99s obvious rage and impatience, picked the paper up and handed\r\nit respectfully to Chauvelin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead it, sergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter curtly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is almost illegible, citoyen . . . a fearful scrawl. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ordered you to read it,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Chauvelin, viciously.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant, by the light of his lantern, began deciphering the few\r\nhastily scrawled words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot quite reach you, without risking your lives and endangering\r\nthe success of your rescue. When you receive this, wait two minutes,\r\nthen creep out of the hut one by one, turn to your left sharply, and\r\ncreep cautiously down the cliff; keep to the left all the time, till\r\nyou reach the first rock, which you see jutting far out to sea\xe2\x80\x94behind\r\nit in the creek the boat is on the look-out for you\xe2\x80\x94give a long, sharp\r\nwhistle\xe2\x80\x94she will come up\xe2\x80\x94get into her\xe2\x80\x94my men will row you to the\r\nschooner, and thence to England and safety\xe2\x80\x94once on board the _Day\r\nDream_ send the boat back for me, tell my men that I shall be at the\r\ncreek, which is in a direct line opposite the \xe2\x80\x98Chat Gris\xe2\x80\x99 near Calais.\r\nThey know it. I shall be there as soon as possible\xe2\x80\x94they must wait for\r\nme at a safe distance out at sea, till they hear the usual signal. Do\r\nnot delay\xe2\x80\x94and obey these instructions implicitly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there is the signature, citoyen,\xe2\x80\x9d added the sergeant, as he\r\nhanded the paper back to Chauvelin.\r\n\r\nBut the latter had not waited an instant. One phrase of the momentous\r\nscrawl had caught his ear. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be at the creek which is in a\r\ndirect line opposite the \xe2\x80\x98Chat Gris\xe2\x80\x99 near Calais\xe2\x80\x9d: that phrase might\r\nyet mean victory for him.\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cWhich of you knows this coast well?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to his men who now\r\n one by one had all returned from their fruitless run, and were all\r\n assembled once more round the hut.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, citoyen,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them, \xe2\x80\x9cI was born in Calais, and know\r\nevery stone of these cliffs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a creek in a direct line from the \xe2\x80\x98Chat Gris\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is, citoyen. I know it well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Englishman is hoping to reach that creek. He does _not_ know every\r\nstone of these cliffs, he may go there by the longest way round, and in\r\nany case he will proceed cautiously for fear of the patrols. At any\r\nrate, there is a chance to get him yet. A thousand francs to each man\r\nwho gets to that creek before that long-legged Englishman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know a short cut across the cliffs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the soldier, and with an\r\nenthusiastic shout, he rushed forward, followed closely by his\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\nWithin a few minutes their running footsteps had died away in the\r\ndistance. Chauvelin listened to them for a moment; the promise of the\r\nreward was lending spurs to the soldiers of the Republic. The gleam of\r\nhate and anticipated triumph was once more apparent on his face.\r\n\r\nClose to him Desgas still stood mute and impassive, waiting for further\r\norders, whilst two soldiers were kneeling beside the prostrate form of\r\nMarguerite. Chauvelin gave his secretary a vicious look. His well-laid\r\nplan had failed, its sequel was problematical; there was still a great\r\nchance now that the Scarlet Pimpernel might yet escape, and Chauvelin,\r\nwith that unreasoning fury, which sometimes assails a strong nature,\r\nwas longing to vent his rage on somebody.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were holding Marguerite pinioned to the ground, though\r\nshe, poor soul, was not making the faintest struggle. Overwrought\r\nnature had at last peremptorily asserted herself, and she lay there in\r\na dead swoon: her eyes circled by deep purple lines, that told of long,\r\nsleepless nights, her hair matted and damp round her forehead, her lips\r\nparted in a sharp curve that spoke of physical pain.\r\n\r\nThe cleverest woman in Europe, the elegant and fashionable Lady\r\nBlakeney, who had dazzled London society with her beauty, her wit and\r\nher extravagances, presented a very pathetic picture of tired-out,\r\nsuffering womanhood, which would have appealed to any, but the hard,\r\nvengeful heart of her baffled enemy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no use mounting guard over a woman who is half dead,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nspitefully to the soldiers, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you have allowed five men who were\r\nvery much alive to escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nObediently the soldiers rose to their feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better try and find that footpath again for me, and that\r\nbroken-down cart we left on the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen suddenly a bright idea seemed to strike him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! by-the-bye! where is the Jew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClose by here, citoyen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Desgas; \xe2\x80\x9cI gagged him and tied his legs\r\ntogether as you commanded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom the immediate vicinity, a plaintive moan reached Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s ears.\r\nHe followed his secretary, who led the way to the other side of the\r\nhut, where, fallen into an absolute heap of dejection, with his legs\r\ntightly pinioned together and his mouth gagged, lay the unfortunate\r\ndescendant of Israel.\r\n\r\nHis face in the silvery light of the moon looked positively ghastly\r\nwith terror: his eyes were wide open and almost glassy, and his whole\r\nbody was trembling, as if with ague, while a piteous wail escaped his\r\nbloodless lips. The rope which had originally been wound round his\r\nshoulders and arms had evidently given way, for it lay in a tangle\r\nabout his body, but he seemed quite unconscious of this, for he had not\r\nmade the slightest attempt to move from the place where Desgas had\r\noriginally put him: like a terrified chicken which looks upon a line of\r\nwhite chalk, drawn on a table, as on a string which paralyzes its\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring the cowardly brute here,\xe2\x80\x9d commanded Chauvelin.\r\n\r\nHe certainly felt exceedingly vicious, and since he had no reasonable\r\ngrounds for venting his ill-humour on the soldiers who had but too\r\npunctually obeyed his orders, he felt that the son of the despised race\r\nwould prove an excellent butt. With true French contempt of the Jew,\r\nwhich has survived the lapse of centuries even to this day, he would\r\nnot go too near him, but said with biting sarcasm, as the wretched old\r\nman was brought in full light of the moon by the two soldiers,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose now, that being a Jew, you have a good memory for bargains?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer!\xe2\x80\x9d he again commanded, as the Jew with trembling lips seemed too\r\nfrightened to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your Honour,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered the poor wretch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember, then, the one you and I made together in Calais, when\r\nyou undertook to overtake Reuben Goldstein, his nag and my friend the\r\ntall stranger? Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cB . . . b . . . but . . . your Honour . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no \xe2\x80\x98but.\xe2\x80\x99 I said, do you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cY . . . y . . . y . . . yes . . . your Honour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the bargain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was dead silence. The unfortunate man looked round at the great\r\ncliffs, the moon above, the stolid faces of the soldiers, and even at\r\nthe poor, prostrate, inanimate woman close by, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d thundered Chauvelin, menacingly.\r\n\r\nHe did try, poor wretch, but, obviously, he could not. There was no\r\ndoubt, however, that he knew what to expect from the stern man before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Honour . . .\xe2\x80\x9d he ventured imploringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince your terror seems to have paralyzed your tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nChauvelin, sarcastically, \xe2\x80\x9cI must needs refresh your memory. It was\r\nagreed between us, that if we overtook my friend the tall stranger,\r\nbefore he reached this place, you were to have ten pieces of gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA low moan escaped from the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s trembling lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d added Chauvelin, with slow emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cif you deceived me in your\r\npromise, you were to have a sound beating, one that would teach you not\r\nto tell lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not, your Honour; I swear it by Abraham . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd by all the other patriarchs, I know. Unfortunately, they are still\r\nin Hades, I believe, according to your creed, and cannot help you much\r\nin your present trouble. Now, you did not fulfil your share of the\r\nbargain, but I am ready to fulfil mine. Here,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to the\r\nsoldiers, \xe2\x80\x9cthe buckle-end of your two belts to this confounded Jew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the soldiers obediently unbuckled their heavy leather belts, the Jew\r\nset up a howl that surely would have been enough to bring all the\r\npatriarchs out of Hades and elsewhere, to defend their descendant from\r\nthe brutality of this French official.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I can rely on you, citoyen soldiers,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Chauvelin,\r\nmaliciously, \xe2\x80\x9cto give this old liar the best and soundest beating he\r\nhas ever experienced. But don\xe2\x80\x99t kill him,\xe2\x80\x9d he added drily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will obey, citoyen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the soldiers as imperturbably as ever.\r\n\r\nHe did not wait to see his orders carried out: he knew that he could\r\ntrust these soldiers\xe2\x80\x94who were still smarting under his rebuke\xe2\x80\x94not to\r\nmince matters, when given a free hand to belabour a third party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen that lumbering coward has had his punishment,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Desgas,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe men can guide us as far as the cart, and one of them can drive us\r\nin it back to Calais. The Jew and the woman can look after each other,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added roughly, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil we can send somebody for them in the morning.\r\nThey can\xe2\x80\x99t run away very far, in their present condition, and we cannot\r\nbe troubled with them just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChauvelin had not given up all hope. His men, he knew, were spurred on\r\nby the hope of the reward. That enigmatic and audacious Scarlet\r\nPimpernel, alone and with thirty men at his heels, could not reasonably\r\nbe expected to escape a second time.\r\n\r\nBut he felt less sure now: the Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s audacity had baffled him\r\nonce, whilst the wooden-headed stupidity of the soldiers, and the\r\ninterference of a woman had turned his hand, which held all the trumps,\r\ninto a losing one. If Marguerite had not taken up his time, if the\r\nsoldiers had had a grain of intelligence, if . . . it was a long \xe2\x80\x9cif,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand Chauvelin stood for a moment quite still, and enrolled thirty odd\r\npeople in one long, overwhelming anathema. Nature, poetic, silent,\r\nbalmy, the bright moon, the calm, silvery sea spoke of beauty and of\r\nrest, and Chauvelin cursed nature, cursed man and woman, and, above\r\nall, he cursed all long-legged, meddlesome British enigmas with one\r\ngigantic curse.\r\n\r\nThe howls of the Jew behind him, undergoing his punishment, sent a balm\r\nthrough his heart, overburdened as it was with revengeful malice. He\r\nsmiled. It eased his mind to think that some human being at least was,\r\nlike himself, not altogether at peace with mankind.\r\n\r\nHe turned and took a last look at the lonely bit of coast, where stood\r\nthe wooden hut, now bathed in moonlight, the scene of the greatest\r\ndiscomfiture ever experienced by a leading member of the Committee of\r\nPublic Safety.\r\n\r\nAgainst a rock, on a hard bed of stone, lay the unconscious figure of\r\nMarguerite Blakeney, while some few paces further on, the unfortunate\r\nJew was receiving on his broad back the blows of two stout leather\r\nbelts, wielded by the stolid arms of two sturdy soldiers of the\r\nRepublic. The howls of Benjamin Rosenbaum were fit to make the dead\r\nrise from their graves. They must have wakened all the gulls from\r\nsleep, and made them look down with great interest at the doings of the\r\nlords of the creation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d commanded Chauvelin, as the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s moans became more\r\nfeeble, and the poor wretch seemed to have fainted away, \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto kill him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nObediently the soldiers buckled on their belts, one of them viciously\r\nkicking the Jew to one side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave him there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chauvelin, \xe2\x80\x9cand lead the way now quickly to the\r\ncart. I\xe2\x80\x99ll follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked up to where Marguerite lay, and looked down into her face.\r\nShe had evidently recovered consciousness, and was making feeble\r\nefforts to raise herself. Her large, blue eyes were looking at the\r\nmoonlit scene round her with a scared and terrified look; they rested\r\nwith a mixture of horror and pity on the Jew, whose luckless fate and\r\nwild howls had been the first signs that struck her, with her returning\r\nsenses; then she caught sight of Chauvelin, in his neat, dark clothes,\r\nwhich seemed hardly crumpled after the stirring events of the last few\r\nhours. He was smiling sarcastically, and his pale eyes peered down at\r\nher with a look of intense malice.\r\n\r\nWith mock gallantry, he stooped and raised her icy-cold hand to his\r\nlips, which sent a thrill of indescribable loathing through\r\nMarguerite\xe2\x80\x99s weary frame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI much regret, fair lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in his most suave tones, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\ncircumstances, over which I have no control, compel me to leave you\r\nhere for the moment. But I go away, secure in the knowledge that I do\r\nnot leave you unprotected. Our friend Benjamin here, though a trifle\r\nthe worse for wear at the present moment, will prove a gallant defender\r\nof your fair person, I have no doubt. At dawn I will send an escort for\r\nyou; until then, I feel sure that you will find him devoted, though\r\nperhaps a trifle slow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite only had the strength to turn her head away. Her heart was\r\nbroken with cruel anguish. One awful thought had returned to her mind,\r\ntogether with gathering consciousness: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat had become of Percy?\xe2\x80\x94What\r\nof Armand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knew nothing of what had happened after she heard the cheerful\r\nsong, \xe2\x80\x9cGod save the King,\xe2\x80\x9d which she believed to be the signal of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, myself,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Chauvelin, \xe2\x80\x9cmust now very reluctantly leave you.\r\n_Au revoir_, fair lady. We meet, I hope, soon in London. Shall I see\r\nyou at the Prince of Wales\xe2\x80\x99 garden party?\xe2\x80\x94No?\xe2\x80\x94Ah, well, _au\r\nrevoir!_\xe2\x80\x94Remember me, I pray, to Sir Percy Blakeney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, with a last ironical smile and bow, he once more kissed her hand,\r\nand disappeared down the footpath in the wake of the soldiers, and\r\nfollowed by the imperturbable Desgas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\nTHE ESCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nMarguerite listened\xe2\x80\x94half-dazed as she was\xe2\x80\x94to the fast-retreating, firm\r\nfootsteps of the four men.\r\n\r\nAll nature was so still that she, lying with her ear close to the\r\nground, could distinctly trace the sound of their tread, as they\r\nultimately turned into the road, and presently the faint echo of the\r\nold cart-wheels, the halting gait of the lean nag, told her that her\r\nenemy was a quarter of a league away. How long she lay there she knew\r\nnot. She had lost count of time; dreamily she looked up at the moonlit\r\nsky, and listened to the monotonous roll of the waves.\r\n\r\nThe invigorating scent of the sea was nectar to her wearied body, the\r\nimmensity of the lonely cliffs was silent and dreamlike. Her brain only\r\nremained conscious of its ceaseless, its intolerable torture of\r\nuncertainty.\r\n\r\nShe did not know!\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nShe did not know whether Percy was even now, at this moment, in the\r\nhands of the soldiers of the Republic, enduring\xe2\x80\x94as she had done\r\nherself\xe2\x80\x94the gibes and jeers of his malicious enemy. She did not know,\r\non the other hand, whether Armand\xe2\x80\x99s lifeless body did not lie there, in\r\nthe hut, whilst Percy had escaped, only to hear that his wife\xe2\x80\x99s hands\r\nhad guided the human bloodhounds to the murder of Armand and his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe physical pain of utter weariness was so great, that she hoped\r\nconfidently her tired body could rest here for ever, after all the\r\nturmoil, the passion, and the intrigues of the last few days\xe2\x80\x94here,\r\nbeneath that clear sky, within sound of the sea, and with this balmy\r\nautumn breeze whispering to her a last lullaby. All was so solitary, so\r\nsilent, like unto dreamland. Even the last faint echo of the distant\r\ncart had long ago died away, afar.\r\n\r\nSuddenly . . . a sound . . . the strangest, undoubtedly, that these\r\nlonely cliffs of France had ever heard, broke the silent solemnity of\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\nSo strange a sound was it that the gentle breeze ceased to murmur, the\r\ntiny pebbles to roll down the steep incline! So strange, that\r\nMarguerite, wearied, overwrought as she was, thought that the\r\nbeneficial unconsciousness of the approach of death was playing her\r\nhalf-sleeping senses a weird and elusive trick.\r\n\r\nIt was the sound of a good, solid, absolutely British \xe2\x80\x9cDamn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sea-gulls in their nests awoke and looked round in astonishment; a\r\ndistant and solitary owl set up a midnight hoot, the tall cliffs\r\nfrowned down majestically at the strange, unheard-of sacrilege.\r\n\r\nMarguerite did not trust her ears. Half-raising herself on her hands,\r\nshe strained every sense to see or hear, to know the meaning of this\r\nvery earthly sound.\r\n\r\nAll was still again for the space of a few seconds; the same silence\r\nonce more fell upon the great and lonely vastness.\r\n\r\nThen Marguerite, who had listened as in a trance, who felt she must be\r\ndreaming with that cool, magnetic moonlight overhead, heard again; and\r\nthis time her heart stood still, her eyes large and dilated, looked\r\nround her, not daring to trust to her other sense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOdd\xe2\x80\x99s life! but I wish those demmed fellows had not hit quite so\r\nhard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time it was quite unmistakable, only one particular pair of\r\nessentially British lips could have uttered those words, in sleepy,\r\ndrawly, affected tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated those same British lips, emphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cZounds! but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m as weak as a rat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a moment Marguerite was on her feet.\r\n\r\nWas she dreaming? Were those great, stony cliffs the gates of paradise?\r\nWas the fragrant breath of the breeze suddenly caused by the flutter of\r\nangels\xe2\x80\x99 wings, bringing tidings of unearthly joys to her, after all her\r\nsuffering, or\xe2\x80\x94faint and ill\xe2\x80\x94was she the prey of delirium?\r\n\r\nShe listened again, and once again she heard the same very earthly\r\nsounds of good, honest British language, not the least akin to\r\nwhisperings from paradise or flutter of angels\xe2\x80\x99 wings.\r\n\r\nShe looked round her eagerly at the tall cliffs, the lonely hut, the\r\ngreat stretch of rocky beach. Somewhere there, above or below her,\r\nbehind a boulder or inside a crevice, but still hidden from her\r\nlonging, feverish eyes, must be the owner of that voice, which once\r\nused to irritate her, but which now would make her the happiest woman\r\nin Europe, if only she could locate it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPercy! Percy!\xe2\x80\x9d she shrieked hysterically, tortured between doubt and\r\nhope, \xe2\x80\x9cI am here! Come to me! Where are you? Percy! Percy! . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very well calling me, m\xe2\x80\x99dear!\xe2\x80\x9d said the same sleepy, drawly\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cbut odd\xe2\x80\x99s my life, I cannot come to you: those demmed\r\nfrog-eaters have trussed me like a goose on a spit, and I am as weak as\r\na mouse . . . I cannot get away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd still Marguerite did not understand. She did not realise for at\r\nleast another ten seconds whence came that voice, so drawly, so dear,\r\nbut alas! with a strange accent of weakness and of suffering. There was\r\nno one within sight . . . except by that rock . . . Great God! . . .\r\nthe Jew! . . . Was she mad or dreaming? . . .\r\n\r\nHis back was against the pale moonlight, he was half-crouching, trying\r\nvainly to raise himself with his arms tightly pinioned. Marguerite ran\r\nup to him, took his head in both her hands . . . and looked straight\r\ninto a pair of blue eyes, good-natured, even a trifle amused\xe2\x80\x94shining\r\nout of the weird and distorted mask of the Jew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPercy! . . . Percy! . . . my husband!\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped, faint with the\r\nfulness of her joy. \xe2\x80\x9cThank God! Thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa! m\xe2\x80\x99dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined good-humouredly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will both do that anon,\r\nan you think you can loosen these demmed ropes, and release me from my\r\ninelegant attitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had no knife, her fingers were numb and weak, but she worked away\r\nwith her teeth, while great welcome tears poured from her eyes, onto\r\nthose poor, pinioned hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOdd\xe2\x80\x99s life!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when at last, after frantic efforts on her part,\r\nthe ropes seemed at last to be giving way, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I marvel whether it has\r\never happened before, that an English gentleman allowed himself to be\r\nlicked by a demmed foreigner, and made no attempt to give as good as he\r\ngot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was very obvious that he was exhausted from sheer physical pain, and\r\nwhen at last the rope gave way, he fell in a heap against the rock.\r\n\r\nMarguerite looked helplessly round her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! for a drop of water on this awful beach!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried in agony,\r\nseeing that he was ready to faint again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, m\xe2\x80\x99dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured with his good-humoured smile, \xe2\x80\x9cpersonally I\r\nshould prefer a drop of good French brandy! an you\xe2\x80\x99ll dive in the\r\npocket of this dirty old garment, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find my flask. . . . I am\r\ndemmed if I can move.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he had drunk some brandy, he forced Marguerite to do likewise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa! that\xe2\x80\x99s better now! Eh! little woman?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a sigh of\r\nsatisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cHeigh-ho! but this is a queer rig-up for Sir Percy\r\nBlakeney, Bart., to be found in by his lady, and no mistake. Begad!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, passing his hand over his chin, \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t been shaved for\r\nnearly twenty hours: I must look a disgusting object. As for these\r\ncurls . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd laughingly he took off the disfiguring wig and curls, and stretched\r\nout his long limbs, which were cramped from many hours\xe2\x80\x99 stooping. Then\r\nhe bent forward and looked long and searchingly into his wife\xe2\x80\x99s blue\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPercy,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, while a deep blush suffused her delicate cheeks\r\nand neck, \xe2\x80\x9cif you only knew . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do know, dear . . . everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with infinite gentleness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd can you ever forgive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have naught to forgive, sweetheart; your heroism, your devotion,\r\nwhich I, alas! so little deserved, have more than atoned for that\r\nunfortunate episode at the ball.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you knew? . . .\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9call the time . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied tenderly, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew . . . all the time. . . . But,\r\nbegad! had I but known what a noble heart yours was, my Margot, I\r\nshould have trusted you, as you deserved to be trusted, and you would\r\nnot have had to undergo the terrible sufferings of the past few hours,\r\nin order to run after a husband, who has done so much that needs\r\nforgiveness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were sitting side by side, leaning up against a rock, and he had\r\nrested his aching head on her shoulder. She certainly now deserved the\r\nname of \xe2\x80\x9cthe happiest woman in Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a case of the blind leading the lame, sweetheart, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid with his good-natured smile of old. \xe2\x80\x9cOdd\xe2\x80\x99s life! but I do not know\r\nwhich are the more sore, my shoulders or your little feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bent forward to kiss them, for they peeped out through her torn\r\nstockings, and bore pathetic witness to her endurance and devotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Armand . . .\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with sudden terror and remorse, as in the\r\nmidst of her happiness the image of the beloved brother, for whose sake\r\nshe had so deeply sinned, rose now before her mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! have no fear for Armand, sweetheart,\xe2\x80\x9d he said tenderly, \xe2\x80\x9cdid I not\r\npledge you my word that he should be safe? He with de Tournay and the\r\nothers are even now on board the _Day Dream_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how?\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet, \xe2\x80\x99tis simple enough, m\xe2\x80\x99dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with that funny, half-shy,\r\nhalf-inane laugh of his, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see! when I found that that brute\r\nChauvelin meant to stick to me like a leech, I thought the best thing I\r\ncould do, as I could not shake him off, was to take him along with me.\r\nI had to get to Armand and the others somehow, and all the roads were\r\npatrolled, and everyone on the look-out for your humble servant. I knew\r\nthat when I slipped through Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s fingers at the \xe2\x80\x98Chat Gris,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat he would lie in wait for me here, whichever way I took. I wanted\r\nto keep an eye on him and his doings, and a British head is as good as\r\na French one any day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndeed it had proved to be infinitely better, and Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nwas filled with joy and marvel, as he continued to recount to her the\r\ndaring manner in which he had snatched the fugitives away, right from\r\nunder Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s very nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDressed as the dirty old Jew,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gaily, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew I should not be\r\nrecognised. I had met Reuben Goldstein in Calais earlier in the\r\nevening. For a few gold pieces he supplied me with this rig-out, and\r\nundertook to bury himself out of sight of everybody, whilst he lent me\r\nhis cart and nag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if Chauvelin had discovered you,\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped excitedly, \xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\ndisguise was good . . . but he is so sharp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOdd\xe2\x80\x99s fish!\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cthen certainly the game would have\r\nbeen up. I could but take the risk. I know human nature pretty well by\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a note of sadness in his cheery, young voice, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nI know these Frenchmen out and out. They so loathe a Jew, that they\r\nnever come nearer than a couple of yards of him, and begad! I fancy\r\nthat I contrived to make myself look about as loathsome an object as it\r\nis possible to conceive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x94and then?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZooks!\xe2\x80\x94then I carried out my little plan: that is to say, at first I\r\nonly determined to leave everything to chance, but when I heard\r\nChauvelin giving his orders to the soldiers, I thought that Fate and I\r\nwere going to work together after all. I reckoned on the blind\r\nobedience of the soldiers. Chauvelin had ordered them on pain of death\r\nnot to stir until the tall Englishman came. Desgas had thrown me down\r\nin a heap quite close to the hut; the soldiers took no notice of the\r\nJew, who had driven Citoyen Chauvelin to this spot. I managed to free\r\nmy hands from the ropes, with which the brute had trussed me; I always\r\ncarry pencil and paper with me wherever I go, and I hastily scrawled a\r\nfew important instructions on a scrap of paper; then I looked about me.\r\nI crawled up to the hut, under the very noses of the soldiers, who lay\r\nunder cover without stirring, just as Chauvelin had ordered them to do,\r\nthen I dropped my little note into the hut, through a chink in the\r\nwall, and waited. In this note I told the fugitives to walk noiselessly\r\nout of the hut, creep down the cliffs, keep to the left until they came\r\nto the first creek, to give a certain signal, when the boat of the _Day\r\nDream_, which lay in wait not far out to sea, would pick them up. They\r\nobeyed implicitly, fortunately for them and for me. The soldiers who\r\nsaw them were equally obedient to Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s orders. They did not\r\nstir! I waited for nearly half an hour; when I knew that the fugitives\r\nwere safe I gave the signal, which caused so much stir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd that was the whole story. It seemed so simple! and Marguerite could\r\nbut marvel at the wonderful ingenuity, the boundless pluck and audacity\r\nwhich had evolved and helped to carry out this daring plan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut those brutes struck you!\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped in horror, at the bare\r\nrecollection of the fearful indignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! that could not be helped,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gently, \xe2\x80\x9cwhilst my little\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s fate was so uncertain, I had to remain here by her side. Odd\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlife!\xe2\x80\x9d he added merrily, \xe2\x80\x9cnever fear! Chauvelin will lose nothing by\r\nwaiting, I warrant! Wait till I get him back to England!\xe2\x80\x94La! he shall\r\npay for the thrashing he gave me with compound interest, I promise\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite laughed. It was so good to be beside him, to hear his cheery\r\nvoice, to watch that good-humoured twinkle in his blue eyes, as he\r\nstretched out his strong arms, in longing for that foe, and\r\nanticipation of his well-deserved punishment.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however, she started: the happy blush left her cheek, the\r\nlight of joy died out of her eyes: she had heard a stealthy footfall\r\noverhead, and a stone had rolled down from the top of the cliffs right\r\ndown to the beach below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered in horror and alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! nothing, m\xe2\x80\x99dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered with a pleasant laugh, \xe2\x80\x9conly a\r\ntrifle you happened to have forgotten . . . my friend, Ffoulkes . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Andrew!\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped.\r\n\r\nIndeed, she had wholly forgotten the devoted friend and companion, who\r\nhad trusted and stood by her during all these hours of anxiety and\r\nsuffering. She remembered him now, tardily and with a pang of remorse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye! you had forgotten him, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you, m\xe2\x80\x99dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Percy,\r\nmerrily. \xe2\x80\x9cFortunately, I met him, not far from the \xe2\x80\x98Chat Gris,\xe2\x80\x99 before\r\nI had that interesting supper party, with my friend Chauvelin. . . .\r\nOdd\xe2\x80\x99s life! but I have a score to settle with that young reprobate!\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nin the meanwhile, I told him of a very long, very roundabout road, that\r\nwould bring him here by a very circuitous road which Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s men\r\nwould never suspect, just about the time when we are ready for him, eh,\r\nlittle woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he obeyed?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Marguerite, in utter astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout word or question. See, here he comes. He was not in the way\r\nwhen I did not want him, and now he arrives in the nick of time. Ah! he\r\nwill make pretty little Suzanne a most admirable and methodical\r\nhusband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Sir Andrew Ffoulkes had cautiously worked his way down\r\nthe cliffs: he stopped once or twice, pausing to listen for the\r\nwhispered words, which would guide him to Blakeney\xe2\x80\x99s hiding-place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlakeney!\xe2\x80\x9d he ventured to say at last cautiously, \xe2\x80\x9cBlakeney! are you\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next moment he rounded the rock against which Sir Percy and\r\nMarguerite were leaning, and seeing the weird figure still clad in the\r\nlong Jew\xe2\x80\x99s gaberdine, he paused in sudden, complete bewilderment.\r\n\r\nBut already Blakeney had struggled to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with his funny, inane laugh, \xe2\x80\x9call alive!\r\nthough I do look a begad scarecrow in these demmed things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZooks!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Sir Andrew in boundless astonishment as he\r\nrecognised his leader, \xe2\x80\x9cof all the . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man had seen Marguerite, and happily checked the forcible\r\nlanguage that rose to his lips, at sight of the exquisite Sir Percy in\r\nthis weird and dirty garb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Blakeney, calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cof all the . . . hem! . . . My friend!\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nhave not yet had time to ask you what you were doing in France, when I\r\nordered you to remain in London? Insubordination? What? Wait till my\r\nshoulders are less sore, and, by Gad, see the punishment you\xe2\x80\x99ll get.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOdd\xe2\x80\x99s fish! I\xe2\x80\x99ll bear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Andrew, with a merry laugh,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cseeing that you are alive to give it. . . . Would you have had me\r\nallow Lady Blakeney to do the journey alone? But, in the name of\r\nheaven, man, where did you get these extraordinary clothes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLud! they are a bit quaint, ain\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Sir Percy, jovially.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, odd\xe2\x80\x99s fish!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with sudden earnestness and authority,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnow you are here, Ffoulkes, we must lose no more time: that brute\r\nChauvelin may send some one to look after us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarguerite was so happy, she could have stayed here for ever, hearing\r\nhis voice, asking a hundred questions. But at mention of Chauvelin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname she started in quick alarm, afraid for the dear life she would\r\nhave died to save.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can we get back?\xe2\x80\x9d she gasped; \xe2\x80\x9cthe roads are full of soldiers\r\nbetween here and Calais, and . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not going back to Calais, sweetheart,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut just the\r\nother side of Gris Nez, not half a league from here. The boat of the\r\n_Day Dream_ will meet us there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boat of the _Day Dream_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a merry laugh; \xe2\x80\x9canother little trick of mine. I\r\nshould have told you before that when I slipped that note into the hut,\r\nI also added another for Armand, which I directed him to leave behind,\r\nand which has sent Chauvelin and his men running full tilt back to the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Chat Gris\xe2\x80\x99 after me; but the first little note contained my real\r\ninstructions, including those to old Briggs. He had my orders to go out\r\nfurther to sea, and then towards the west. When well out of sight of\r\nCalais, he will send the galley to a little creek he and I know of,\r\njust beyond Gris Nez. The men will look out for me\xe2\x80\x94we have a\r\npreconcerted signal, and we will all be safely aboard, whilst Chauvelin\r\nand his men solemnly sit and watch the creek which is \xe2\x80\x98just opposite\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cChat Gris.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other side of Gris Nez? But I . . . I cannot walk, Percy,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmoaned helplessly as, trying to struggle to her tired feet, she found\r\nherself unable even to stand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will carry you, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said simply; \xe2\x80\x9cthe blind leading the lame,\r\nyou know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Andrew was ready, too, to help with the precious burden, but Sir\r\nPercy would not entrust his beloved to any arms but his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you and she are both safely on board the _Day Dream_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nhis young comrade, \xe2\x80\x9cand I feel that Mlle. Suzanne\xe2\x80\x99s eyes will not greet\r\nme in England with reproachful looks, then it will be my turn to rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd his arms, still vigorous in spite of fatigue and suffering, closed\r\nround Marguerite\xe2\x80\x99s poor, weary body, and lifted her as gently as if she\r\nhad been a feather.\r\n\r\nThen, as Sir Andrew discreetly kept out of earshot, there were many\r\nthings said\xe2\x80\x94or rather whispered\xe2\x80\x94which even the autumn breeze did not\r\ncatch, for it had gone to rest.\r\n\r\nAll his fatigue was forgotten; his shoulders must have been very sore,\r\nfor the soldiers had hit hard, but the man\xe2\x80\x99s muscles seemed made of\r\nsteel, and his energy was almost supernatural. It was a weary tramp,\r\nhalf a league along the stony side of the cliffs, but never for a\r\nmoment did his courage give way or his muscles yield to fatigue. On he\r\ntramped, with firm footstep, his vigorous arms encircling the precious\r\nburden, and . . . no doubt, as she lay, quiet and happy, at times\r\nlulled to momentary drowsiness, at others watching, through the slowly\r\ngathering morning light, the pleasant face with the lazy, drooping blue\r\neyes, ever cheerful, ever illumined with a good-humoured smile, she\r\nwhispered many things, which helped to shorten the weary road, and\r\nacted as a soothing balsam to his aching sinews.\r\n\r\nThe many-hued light of dawn was breaking in the east, when at last they\r\nreached the creek beyond Gris Nez. The galley lay in wait: in answer to\r\na signal from Sir Percy, she drew near, and two sturdy British sailors\r\nhad the honour of carrying my lady into the boat.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, they were on board the _Day Dream_. The crew, who\r\nof necessity were in their master\xe2\x80\x99s secrets, and who were devoted to\r\nhim heart and soul, were not surprised to see him arriving in so\r\nextraordinary a disguise.\r\n\r\nArmand St. Just and the other fugitives were eagerly awaiting the\r\nadvent of their brave rescuer; he would not stay to hear the\r\nexpressions of their gratitude, but found his way to his private cabin\r\nas quickly as he could, leaving Marguerite quite happy in the arms of\r\nher brother.\r\n\r\nEverything on board the _Day Dream_ was fitted with that exquisite\r\nluxury, so dear to Sir Percy Blakeney\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and by the time they all\r\nlanded at Dover he had found time to get into some of the sumptuous\r\nclothes which he loved, and of which he always kept a supply on board\r\nhis yacht.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty was to provide Marguerite with a pair of shoes, and\r\ngreat was the little middy\xe2\x80\x99s joy when my lady found that she could put\r\nfoot on English shore in his best pair.\r\n\r\nThe rest is silence!\xe2\x80\x94silence and joy for those who had endured so much\r\nsuffering, yet found at last a great and lasting happiness.\r\n\r\nBut it is on record that at the brilliant wedding of Sir Andrew\r\nFfoulkes, Bart., with Mlle. Suzanne de Tournay de Basserive, a function\r\nat which H.R.H. the Prince of Wales and all the _\xc3\xa9lite_ of fashionable\r\nsociety were present, the most beautiful woman there was unquestionably\r\nLady Blakeney, whilst the clothes Sir Percy Blakeney wore were the talk\r\nof the _jeunesse dor\xc3\xa9e_ of London for many days.\r\n\r\nIt is also a fact that M. Chauvelin, the accredited agent of the French\r\nRepublican Government, was not present at that or any other social\r\nfunction in London, after that memorable evening at Lord Grenville\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nball.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
