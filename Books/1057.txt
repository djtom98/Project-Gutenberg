leave it for a subtle memory\r\n      Of those sweet tremulous days of rain and sun,\r\n   When April laughed between her tears to see\r\n      The early primrose with shy footsteps run\r\n   From the gnarled oak-tree roots till all the wold,\r\n   Spite of its brown and trampled leaves, grew bright with shimmering\r\n   gold.\r\n\r\n   Nay, pluck it too, it is not half so sweet\r\n      As thou thyself, my soul\xe2\x80\x99s idolatry!\r\n   And when thou art a-wearied at thy feet\r\n      Shall oxlips weave their brightest tapestry,\r\n   For thee the woodbine shall forget its pride\r\n   And veil its tangled whorls, and thou shalt walk on daisies pied.\r\n\r\n   And I will cut a reed by yonder spring\r\n      And make the wood-gods jealous, and old Pan\r\n   Wonder what young intruder dares to sing\r\n      In these still haunts, where never foot of man\r\n   Should tread at evening, lest he chance to spy\r\n   The marble limbs of Artemis and all her company.\r\n\r\n   And I will tell thee why the jacinth wears\r\n      Such dread embroidery of dolorous moan,\r\n   And why the hapless nightingale forbears\r\n      To sing her song at noon, but weeps alone\r\n   When the fleet swallow sleeps, and rich men feast,\r\n   And why the laurel trembles when she sees the lightening east.\r\n\r\n   And I will sing how sad Proserpina\r\n      Unto a grave and gloomy Lord was wed,\r\n   And lure the silver-breasted Helena\r\n      Back from the lotus meadows of the dead,\r\n   So shalt thou see that awful loveliness\r\n   For which two mighty Hosts met fearfully in war\xe2\x80\x99s abyss!\r\n\r\n   And then I\xe2\x80\x99ll pipe to thee that Grecian tale\r\n      How Cynthia loves the lad Endymion,\r\n   And hidden in a grey and misty veil\r\n      Hies to the cliffs of Latmos once the Sun\r\n   Leaps from his ocean bed in fruitless chase\r\n   Of those pale flying feet which fade away in his embrace.\r\n\r\n   And if my flute can breathe sweet melody,\r\n      We may behold Her face who long ago\r\n   Dwelt among men by the \xc3\x86gean sea,\r\n      And whose sad house with pillaged portico\r\n   And friezeless wall and columns toppled down\r\n   Looms o\xe2\x80\x99er the ruins of that fair and violet cinctured town.\r\n\r\n   Spirit of Beauty!

tarry still, there are a few\r\n\r\n   Who for thy sake would give their manlihood\r\n      And consecrate their being; I at least\r\n   Have done so, made thy lips my daily food,\r\n      And in thy temples found a goodlier feast\r\n   Than this starved age can give me, spite of all\r\n   Its new-found creeds so sceptical and so dogmatical.\r\n\r\n   Here not Cephissos, not Ilissos flows,\r\n      The woods of white Colonos are not here,\r\n   On our bleak hills the olive never blows,\r\n      No simple priest conducts his lowing steer\r\n   Up the steep marble way, nor through the town\r\n   Do laughing maidens bear to thee the crocus-flowered gown.\r\n\r\n   Yet tarry! for the boy who loved thee best,\r\n      Whose very name should be a memory\r\n   To make thee linger, sleeps in silent rest\r\n      Beneath the Roman walls, and melody\r\n   Still mourns her sweetest lyre; none can play\r\n   The lute of Adonais: with his lips Song passed away.\r\n\r\n   Nay, when Keats died the Muses still had left\r\n      One silver voice to sing his threnody,\r\n   But ah! too soon of it we were bereft\r\n      When on that riven night and stormy sea\r\n   Panthea claimed her singer as her own,\r\n   And slew the mouth that praised her; since which time we walk alone,\r\n\r\n   Save for that fiery heart, that morning star\r\n      Of re-arisen England, whose clear eye\r\n   Saw from our tottering throne and waste of war\r\n      The grand Greek limbs of young Democracy\r\n   Rise mightily like Hesperus and bring\r\n   The great Republic!

even now the glory of thy fame\r\n      Burns in those fields of trampled asphodel,\r\n      Where the high lords whom Ilion knew so well\r\n   Clash ghostly shields, and call upon thy name.\r\n\r\n   Where hast thou been? in that enchanted land\r\n      Whose slumbering vales forlorn Calypso knew,\r\n         Where never mower rose at break of day\r\n      But all unswathed the trammelling grasses grew,\r\n   And the sad shepherd saw the tall corn stand\r\n         Till summer\xe2\x80\x99s red had changed to withered grey?\r\n   Didst thou lie there by some Leth\xc3\xa6an stream\r\n      Deep brooding on thine ancient memory,\r\n      The crash of broken spears, the fiery gleam\r\n   From shivered helm, the Grecian battle-cry?\r\n\r\n   Nay, thou wert hidden in that hollow hill\r\n      With one who is forgotten utterly,\r\n         That discrowned Queen men call the Erycine;\r\n      Hidden away that never mightst thou see\r\n   The face of Her, before whose mouldering shrine\r\n         To-day at Rome the silent nations kneel;\r\n   Who gat from Love no joyous gladdening,\r\n      But only Love\xe2\x80\x99s intolerable pain,\r\n      Only a sword to pierce her heart in twain,\r\n   Only the bitterness of child-bearing.\r\n\r\n   The lotus-leaves which heal the wounds of Death\r\n      Lie in thy hand; O, be thou kind to me,\r\n         While yet I know the summer of my days;\r\n      For hardly can my tremulous lips draw breath\r\n   To fill the silver trumpet with thy praise,\r\n         So bowed am I before thy mystery;\r\n   So bowed and broken on Love\xe2\x80\x99s terrible wheel,\r\n      That I have lost all hope and heart to sing,\r\n      Yet care I not what ruin time may bring\r\n   If in thy temple thou wilt let me kneel.\r\n\r\n   Alas, alas, thou wilt not tarry here,\r\n      But, like that bird, the servant of the sun,\r\n         Who flies before the north wind and the night,\r\n      So wilt thou fly our evil land and drear,\r\n   Back to the tower of thine old delight,\r\n         And the red lips of young Euphorion;\r\n   Nor shall I ever see thy face again,\r\n      But in this poisonous garden-close must stay,\r\n      Crowning my brows with the thorn-crown of pain,\r\n   Till all my loveless life shall pass away.\r\n\r\n   O Helen!  Helen! Helen! yet a while,\r\n      Yet for a little while, O, tarry here,\r\n         Till the dawn cometh and the shadows flee!\r\n      For in the gladsome sunlight of thy smile\r\n   Of heaven or hell I have no thought or fear,\r\n         Seeing I know no other god but thee:\r\n   No other god save him, before whose feet\r\n      In nets of gold the tired planets move,\r\n      The incarnate spirit of spiritual love\r\n   Who in thy body holds his joyous seat.\r\n\r\n   Thou wert not born as common women are!\r\n      But, girt with silver splendour of the foam,\r\n         Didst from the depths of sapphire seas arise!\r\n      And at thy coming some immortal star,\r\n   Bearded with flame, blazed in the Eastern skies,\r\n         And waked the shepherds on thine island-home.\r\n   Thou shalt not die: no asps of Egypt creep\r\n      Close at thy heels to taint the delicate air;\r\n      No sullen-blooming poppies stain thy hair,\r\n   Those scarlet heralds of eternal sleep.\r\n\r\n   Lily of love, pure and inviolate!\r\n      Tower of ivory! red rose of fire!\r\n         Thou hast come down our darkness to illume:\r\n   For we, close-caught in the wide nets of Fate,\r\n      Wearied with waiting for the World\xe2\x80\x99s Desire,\r\n         Aimlessly wandered in the House of gloom,\r\n   Aimlessly sought some slumberous anodyne\r\n      For wasted lives, for lingering wretchedness,\r\n   Till we beheld thy re-arisen shrine,\r\n      And the white glory of thy loveliness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BURDEN OF ITYS\r\n\r\n\r\n   THIS English Thames is holier far than Rome,\r\n      Those harebells like a sudden flush of sea\r\n   Breaking across the woodland, with the foam\r\n      Of meadow-sweet and white anemone\r\n   To fleck their blue waves,\xe2\x80\x94God is likelier there\r\n   Than hidden in that crystal-hearted star the pale monks bear!\r\n\r\n   Those violet-gleaming butterflies that take\r\n      Yon creamy lily for their pavilion\r\n   Are monsignores, and where the rushes shake\r\n      A lazy pike lies basking in the sun,\r\n   His eyes half shut,\xe2\x80\x94he is some mitred old\r\n   Bishop in _partibus_! look at those gaudy scales all green and gold.\r\n\r\n   The wind the restless prisoner of the trees\r\n      Does well for Pal\xc3\xa6strina, one would say\r\n   The mighty master\xe2\x80\x99s hands were on the keys\r\n      Of the Maria organ, which they play\r\n   When early on some sapphire Easter morn\r\n   In a high litter red as blood or sin the Pope is borne\r\n\r\n   From his dark House out to the Balcony\r\n      Above the bronze gates and the crowded square,\r\n   Whose very fountains seem for ecstasy\r\n      To toss their silver lances in the air,\r\n   And stretching out weak hands to East and West\r\n   In vain sends peace to peaceless lands, to restless nations rest.\r\n\r\n   Is not yon lingering orange after-glow\r\n      That stays to vex the moon more fair than all\r\n   Rome\xe2\x80\x99s lordliest pageants! strange, a year ago\r\n      I knelt before some crimson Cardinal\r\n   Who bare the Host across the Esquiline,\r\n   And now\xe2\x80\x94those common poppies in the wheat seem twice as fine.\r\n\r\n   The blue-green beanfields yonder, tremulous\r\n      With the last shower, sweeter perfume bring\r\n   Through this cool evening than the odorous\r\n      Flame-jewelled censers the young deacons swing,\r\n   When the grey priest unlocks the curtained shrine,\r\n   And makes God\xe2\x80\x99s body from the common fruit of corn and vine.\r\n\r\n   Poor Fra Giovanni bawling at the mass\r\n      Were out of tune now, for a small brown bird\r\n   Sings overhead, and through the long cool grass\r\n      I see that throbbing throat which once I heard\r\n   On starlit hills of flower-starred Arcady,\r\n   Once where the white and crescent sand of Salamis meets sea.\r\n\r\n   Sweet is the swallow twittering on the eaves\r\n      At daybreak, when the mower whets his scythe,\r\n   And stock-doves murmur, and the milkmaid leaves\r\n      Her little lonely bed, and carols blithe\r\n   To see the heavy-lowing cattle wait\r\n   Stretching their huge and dripping mouths across the farmyard gate.\r\n\r\n   And sweet the hops upon the Kentish leas,\r\n      And sweet the wind that lifts the new-mown hay,\r\n   And sweet the fretful swarms of grumbling bees\r\n      That round and round the linden blossoms play;\r\n   And sweet the heifer breathing in the stall,\r\n   And the green bursting figs that hang upon the red-brick wall,\r\n\r\n   And sweet to hear the cuckoo mock the spring\r\n      While the last violet loiters by the well,\r\n   And sweet to hear the shepherd Daphnis sing\r\n      The song of Linus through a sunny dell\r\n   Of warm Arcadia where the corn is gold\r\n   And the slight lithe-limbed reapers dance about the wattled fold.\r\n\r\n   And sweet with young Lycoris to recline\r\n      In some Illyrian valley far away,\r\n   Where canopied on herbs amaracine\r\n      We too might waste the summer-tranc\xc3\xa8d day\r\n   Matching our reeds in sportive rivalry,\r\n   While far beneath us frets the troubled purple of the sea.\r\n\r\n   But sweeter far if silver-sandalled foot\r\n      Of some long-hidden God should ever tread\r\n   The Nuneham meadows, if with reeded flute\r\n      Pressed to his lips some Faun might raise his head\r\n   By the green water-flags, ah! sweet indeed\r\n   To see the heavenly herdsman call his white-fleeced flock to feed.\r\n\r\n   Then sing to me thou tuneful chorister,\r\n      Though what thou sing\xe2\x80\x99st be thine own requiem!\r\n   Tell me thy tale thou hapless chronicler\r\n      Of thine own tragedies! do not contemn\r\n   These unfamiliar haunts, this English field,\r\n   For many a lovely coronal our northern isle can yield\r\n\r\n   Which Grecian meadows know not, many a rose\r\n      Which all day long in vales \xc3\x86olian\r\n   A lad might seek in vain for over-grows\r\n      Our hedges like a wanton courtesan\r\n   Unthrifty of its beauty; lilies too\r\n   Ilissos never mirrored star our streams, and cockles blue\r\n\r\n   Dot the green wheat which, though they are the signs\r\n      For swallows going south, would never spread\r\n   Their azure tents between the Attic vines;\r\n      Even that little weed of ragged red,\r\n   Which bids the robin pipe, in Arcady\r\n   Would be a trespasser, and many an unsung elegy\r\n\r\n   Sleeps in the reeds that fringe our winding Thames\r\n      Which to awake were sweeter ravishment\r\n   Than ever Syrinx wept for; diadems\r\n      Of brown bee-studded orchids which were meant\r\n   For Cyther\xc3\xa6a\xe2\x80\x99s brows are hidden here\r\n   Unknown to Cyther\xc3\xa6a, and by yonder pasturing steer\r\n\r\n   There is a tiny yellow daffodil,\r\n      The butterfly can see it from afar,\r\n   Although one summer evening\xe2\x80\x99s dew could fill\r\n      Its little cup twice over ere the star\r\n   Had called the lazy shepherd to his fold\r\n   And be no prodigal; each leaf is flecked with spotted gold\r\n\r\n   As if Jove\xe2\x80\x99s gorgeous leman Danae\r\n      Hot from his gilded arms had stooped to kiss\r\n   The trembling petals, or young Mercury\r\n      Low-flying to the dusky ford of Dis\r\n   Had with one feather of his pinions\r\n   Just brushed them! the slight stem which bears the burden of its suns\r\n\r\n   Is hardly thicker than the gossamer,\r\n      Or poor Arachne\xe2\x80\x99s silver tapestry,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n   Men say it bloomed upon the sepulchre\r\n      Of One I sometime worshipped, but to me\r\n   It seems to bring diviner memories\r\n   Of faun-loved Heliconian glades and blue nymph-haunted seas,\r\n\r\n   Of an untrodden vale at Tempe where\r\n      On the clear river\xe2\x80\x99s marge Narcissus lies,\r\n   The tangle of the forest in his hair,\r\n      The silence of the woodland in his eyes,\r\n   Wooing that drifting imagery which is\r\n   No sooner kissed than broken; memories of Salmacis\r\n\r\n   Who is not boy nor girl and yet is both,\r\n      Fed by two fires and unsatisfied\r\n   Through their excess, each passion being loth\r\n      For love\xe2\x80\x99s own sake to leave the other\xe2\x80\x99s side\r\n   Yet killing love by staying; memories\r\n   Of Oreads peeping through the leaves of silent moonlit trees,\r\n\r\n   Of lonely Ariadne on the wharf\r\n      At Naxos, when she saw the treacherous crew\r\n   Far out at sea, and waved her crimson scarf\r\n      And called false Theseus back again nor knew\r\n   That Dionysos on an amber pard\r\n   Was close behind her; memories of what M\xc3\xa6onia\xe2\x80\x99s bard\r\n\r\n   With sightless eyes beheld, the wall of Troy,\r\n      Queen Helen lying in the ivory room,\r\n   And at her side an amorous red-lipped boy\r\n      Trimming with dainty hand his helmet\xe2\x80\x99s plume,\r\n   And far away the moil, the shout, the groan,\r\n   As Hector shielded off the spear and Ajax hurled the stone;\r\n\r\n   Of wing\xc3\xa8d Perseus with his flawless sword\r\n      Cleaving the snaky tresses of the witch,\r\n   And all those tales imperishably stored\r\n      In little Grecian urns, freightage more rich\r\n   Than any gaudy galleon of Spain\r\n   Bare from the Indies ever! these at least bring back again,\r\n\r\n   For well I know they are not dead at all,\r\n      The ancient Gods of Grecian poesy:\r\n   They are asleep, and when they hear thee call\r\n      Will wake and think \xe2\x80\x99t is very Thessaly,\r\n   This Thames the Daulian waters, this cool glade\r\n   The yellow-irised mead where once young Itys laughed and played.\r\n\r\n   If it was thou dear jasmine-cradled bird\r\n      Who from the leafy stillness of thy throne\r\n   Sang to the wondrous boy, until he heard\r\n      The horn of Atalanta faintly blown\r\n   Across the Cumnor hills, and wandering\r\n   Through Bagley wood at evening found the Attic poets\xe2\x80\x99 spring,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n   Ah! tiny sober-suited advocate\r\n      That pleadest for the moon against the day!\r\n   If thou didst make the shepherd seek his mate\r\n      On that sweet questing, when Proserpina\r\n   Forgot it was not Sicily and leant\r\n   Across the mossy Sandford stile in ravished wonderment,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n   Light-winged and bright-eyed miracle of the wood!\r\n      If ever thou didst soothe with melody\r\n   One of that little clan, that brotherhood\r\n      Which loved the morning-star of Tuscany\r\n   More than the perfect sun of Raphael\r\n   And is immortal, sing to me! for I too love thee well.\r\n\r\n   Sing on! sing on! let the dull world grow young,\r\n      Let elemental things take form again,\r\n   And the old shapes of Beauty walk among\r\n      The simple garths and open crofts, as when\r\n   The son of Leto bare the willow rod,\r\n   And the soft sheep and shaggy goats followed the boyish God.\r\n\r\n   Sing on! sing on! and Bacchus will be here\r\n      Astride upon his gorgeous Indian throne,\r\n   And over whimpering tigers shake the spear\r\n      With yellow ivy crowned and gummy cone,\r\n   While at his side the wanton Bassarid\r\n   Will throw the lion by the mane and catch the mountain kid!\r\n\r\n   Sing on! and I will wear the leopard skin,\r\n      And steal the moon\xc3\xa8d wings of Ashtaroth,\r\n   Upon whose icy chariot we could win\r\n      Cith\xc3\xa6ron in an hour ere the froth\r\n   Has over-brimmed the wine-vat or the Faun\r\n   Ceased from the treading! ay, before the flickering lamp of dawn\r\n\r\n   Has scared the hooting owlet to its nest,\r\n      And warned the bat to close its filmy vans,\r\n   Some M\xc3\xa6nad girl with vine-leaves on her breast\r\n      Will filch their beech-nuts from the sleeping Pans\r\n   So softly that the little nested thrush\r\n   Will never wake, and then with shrilly laugh and leap will rush\r\n\r\n   Down the green valley where the fallen dew\r\n      Lies thick beneath the elm and count her store,\r\n   Till the brown Satyrs in a jolly crew\r\n      Trample the loosestrife down along the shore,\r\n   And where their horn\xc3\xa8d master sits in state\r\n   Bring strawberries and bloomy plums upon a wicker crate!\r\n\r\n   Sing on! and soon with passion-wearied face\r\n      Through the cool leaves Apollo\xe2\x80\x99s lad will come,\r\n   The Tyrian prince his bristled boar will chase\r\n      Adown the chestnut-copses all a-bloom,\r\n   And ivory-limbed, grey-eyed, with look of pride,\r\n   After yon velvet-coated deer the virgin maid will ride.\r\n\r\n   Sing on! and I the dying boy will see\r\n      Stain with his purple blood the waxen bell\r\n   That overweighs the jacinth, and to me\r\n      The wretched Cyprian her woe will tell,\r\n   And I will kiss her mouth and streaming eyes,\r\n   And lead her to the myrtle-hidden grove where Adon lies!\r\n\r\n   Cry out aloud on Itys! memory\r\n      That foster-brother of remorse and pain\r\n   Drops poison in mine ear,\xe2\x80\x94O to be free,\r\n      To burn one\xe2\x80\x99s old ships! and to launch again\r\n   Into the white-plumed battle of the waves\r\n   And fight old Proteus for the spoil of coral-flowered caves!\r\n\r\n   O for Medea with her poppied spell!\r\n      O for the secret of the Colchian shrine!\r\n   O for one leaf of that pale asphodel\r\n      Which binds the tired brows of Proserpine,\r\n   And sheds such wondrous dews at eve that she\r\n   Dreams of the fields of Enna, by the far Sicilian sea,\r\n\r\n   Where oft the golden-girdled bee she chased\r\n      From lily to lily on the level mead,\r\n   Ere yet her sombre Lord had bid her taste\r\n      The deadly fruit of that pomegranate seed,\r\n   Ere the black steeds had harried her away\r\n   Down to the faint and flowerless land, the sick and sunless day.\r\n\r\n   O for one midnight and as paramour\r\n      The Venus of the little Melian farm!\r\n   O that some antique statue for one hour\r\n      Might wake to passion, and that I could charm\r\n   The Dawn at Florence from its dumb despair,\r\n   Mix with those mighty limbs and make that giant breast my lair!\r\n\r\n   Sing on! sing on!

cease and let the north wind bear thy lay\r\n   Back to the rocky hills of Thrace, the stormy Daulian bay.\r\n\r\n   A moment more, the startled leaves had stirred,\r\n      Endymion would have passed across the mead\r\n   Moonstruck with love, and this still Thames had heard\r\n      Pan plash and paddle groping for some reed\r\n   To lure from her blue cave that Naiad maid\r\n   Who for such piping listens half in joy and half afraid.\r\n\r\n   A moment more, the waking dove had cooed,\r\n      The silver daughter of the silver sea\r\n   With the fond gyves of clinging hands had wooed\r\n      Her wanton from the chase, and Dryope\r\n   Had thrust aside the branches of her oak\r\n   To see the lusty gold-haired lad rein in his snorting yoke.\r\n\r\n   A moment more, the trees had stooped to kiss\r\n      Pale Daphne just awakening from the swoon\r\n   Of tremulous laurels, lonely Salmacis\r\n      Had bared his barren beauty to the moon,\r\n   And through the vale with sad voluptuous smile\r\n   Antinous had wandered, the red lotus of the Nile\r\n\r\n   Down leaning from his black and clustering hair,\r\n      To shade those slumberous eyelids\xe2\x80\x99 caverned bliss,\r\n   Or else on yonder grassy slope with bare\r\n      High-tuniced limbs unravished Artemis\r\n   Had bade her hounds give tongue, and roused the deer\r\n   From his green ambuscade with shrill halloo and pricking spear.\r\n\r\n   Lie still, lie still, O passionate heart, lie still!\r\n      O Melancholy, fold thy raven wing!\r\n   O sobbing Dryad, from thy hollow hill\r\n      Come not with such despondent answering!\r\n   No more thou wing\xc3\xa8d Marsyas complain,\r\n   Apollo loveth not to hear such troubled songs of pain!\r\n\r\n   It was a dream, the glade is tenantless,\r\n      No soft Ionian laughter moves the air,\r\n   The Thames creeps on in sluggish leadenness,\r\n      And from the copse left desolate and bare\r\n   Fled is young Bacchus with his revelry,\r\n   Yet still from Nuneham wood there comes that thrilling melody\r\n\r\n   So sad, that one might think a human heart\r\n      Brake in each separate note, a quality\r\n   Which music sometimes has, being the Art\r\n      Which is most nigh to tears and memory;\r\n   Poor mourning Philomel, what dost thou fear?\r\n   Thy sister doth not haunt these fields, Pandion is not here,\r\n\r\n   Here is no cruel Lord with murderous blade,\r\n      No woven web of bloody heraldries,\r\n   But mossy dells for roving comrades made,\r\n      Warm valleys where the tired student lies\r\n   With half-shut book, and many a winding walk\r\n   Where rustic lovers stray at eve in happy simple talk.\r\n\r\n   The harmless rabbit gambols with its young\r\n      Across the trampled towing-path, where late\r\n   A troop of laughing boys in jostling throng\r\n      Cheered with their noisy cries the racing eight;\r\n   The gossamer, with ravelled silver threads,\r\n   Works at its little loom, and from the dusky red-eaved sheds\r\n\r\n   Of the lone Farm a flickering light shines out\r\n      Where the swinked shepherd drives his bleating flock\r\n   Back to their wattled sheep-cotes, a faint shout\r\n      Comes from some Oxford boat at Sandford lock,\r\n   And starts the moor-hen from the sedgy rill,\r\n   And the dim lengthening shadows flit like swallows up the hill.\r\n\r\n   The heron passes homeward to the mere,\r\n      The blue mist creeps among the shivering trees,\r\n   Gold world by world the silent stars appear,\r\n      And like a blossom blown before the breeze\r\n   A white moon drifts across the shimmering sky,\r\n   Mute arbitress of all thy sad, thy rapturous threnody.\r\n\r\n   She does not heed thee, wherefore should she heed,\r\n      She knows Endymion is not far away;\r\n   \xe2\x80\x99Tis I, \xe2\x80\x99tis I, whose soul is as the reed\r\n      Which has no message of its own to play,\r\n   So pipes another\xe2\x80\x99s bidding, it is I,\r\n   Drifting with every wind on the wide sea of misery.\r\n\r\n   Ah!

the lark starts up from his bed in the meadow there,\r\n      Breaking the gossamer threads and the nets of dew,\r\n      And flashing adown the river, a flame of blue!\r\n   The kingfisher flies like an arrow, and wounds the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nATHANASIA\r\n\r\n\r\n   TO that gaunt House of Art which lacks for naught\r\n      Of all the great things men have saved from Time,\r\n   The withered body of a girl was brought\r\n      Dead ere the world\xe2\x80\x99s glad youth had touched its prime,\r\n   And seen by lonely Arabs lying hid\r\n   In the dim womb of some black pyramid.\r\n\r\n   But when they had unloosed the linen band\r\n      Which swathed the Egyptian\xe2\x80\x99s body,\xe2\x80\x94lo! was found\r\n   Closed in the wasted hollow of her hand\r\n      A little seed, which sown in English ground\r\n   Did wondrous snow of starry blossoms bear\r\n   And spread rich odours through our spring-tide air.\r\n\r\n   With such strange arts this flower did allure\r\n      That all forgotten was the asphodel,\r\n   And the brown bee, the lily\xe2\x80\x99s paramour,\r\n      Forsook the cup where he was wont to dwell,\r\n   For not a thing of earth it seemed to be,\r\n   But stolen from some heavenly Arcady.\r\n\r\n   In vain the sad narcissus, wan and white\r\n      At its own beauty, hung across the stream,\r\n   The purple dragon-fly had no delight\r\n      With its gold dust to make his wings a-gleam,\r\n   Ah!

   I.\r\n\r\n   HE was a Grecian lad, who coming home\r\n      With pulpy figs and wine from Sicily\r\n   Stood at his galley\xe2\x80\x99s prow, and let the foam\r\n      Blow through his crisp brown curls unconsciously,\r\n   And holding wave and wind in boy\xe2\x80\x99s despite\r\n   Peered from his dripping seat across the wet and stormy night.\r\n\r\n   Till with the dawn he saw a burnished spear\r\n      Like a thin thread of gold against the sky,\r\n   And hoisted sail, and strained the creaking gear,\r\n      And bade the pilot head her lustily\r\n   Against the nor\xe2\x80\x99west gale, and all day long\r\n   Held on his way, and marked the rowers\xe2\x80\x99 time with measured song.\r\n\r\n   And when the faint Corinthian hills were red\r\n      Dropped anchor in a little sandy bay,\r\n   And with fresh boughs of olive crowned his head,\r\n      And brushed from cheek and throat the hoary spray,\r\n   And washed his limbs with oil, and from the hold\r\n   Brought out his linen tunic and his sandals brazen-soled,\r\n\r\n   And a rich robe stained with the fishers\xe2\x80\x99 juice\r\n      Which of some swarthy trader he had bought\r\n   Upon the sunny quay at Syracuse,\r\n      And was with Tyrian broideries inwrought,\r\n   And by the questioning merchants made his way\r\n   Up through the soft and silver woods, and when the labouring day\r\n\r\n   Had spun its tangled web of crimson cloud,\r\n      Clomb the high hill, and with swift silent feet\r\n   Crept to the fane unnoticed by the crowd\r\n      Of busy priests, and from some dark retreat\r\n   Watched the young swains his frolic playmates bring\r\n   The firstling of their little flock, and the shy shepherd fling\r\n\r\n   The crackling salt upon the flame, or hang\r\n      His studded crook against the temple wall\r\n   To Her who keeps away the ravenous fang\r\n      Of the base wolf from homestead and from stall;\r\n   And then the clear-voiced maidens \xe2\x80\x99gan to sing,\r\n   And to the altar each man brought some goodly offering,\r\n\r\n   A beechen cup brimming with milky foam,\r\n      A fair cloth wrought with cunning imagery\r\n   Of hounds in chase, a waxen honey-comb\r\n      Dripping with oozy gold which scarce the bee\r\n   Had ceased from building, a black skin of oil\r\n   Meet for the wrestlers, a great boar the fierce and white-tusked spoil\r\n\r\n   Stolen from Artemis that jealous maid\r\n      To please Athena, and the dappled hide\r\n   Of a tall stag who in some mountain glade\r\n      Had met the shaft; and then the herald cried,\r\n   And from the pillared precinct one by one\r\n   Went the glad Greeks well pleased that they their simple vows had\r\n   done.\r\n\r\n   And the old priest put out the waning fires\r\n      Save that one lamp whose restless ruby glowed\r\n   For ever in the cell, and the shrill lyres\r\n      Came fainter on the wind, as down the road\r\n   In joyous dance these country folk did pass,\r\n   And with stout hands the warder closed the gates of polished brass.\r\n\r\n   Long time he lay and hardly dared to breathe,\r\n      And heard the cadenced drip of spilt-out wine,\r\n   And the rose-petals falling from the wreath\r\n      As the night breezes wandered through the shrine,\r\n   And seemed to be in some entranc\xc3\xa8d swoon\r\n   Till through the open roof above the full and brimming moon\r\n\r\n   Flooded with sheeny waves the marble floor,\r\n      When from his nook up leapt the venturous lad,\r\n   And flinging wide the cedar-carven door\r\n      Beheld an awful image saffron-clad\r\n   And armed for battle! the gaunt Griffin glared\r\n   From the huge helm, and the long lance of wreck and ruin flared\r\n\r\n   Like a red rod of flame, stony and steeled\r\n      The Gorgon\xe2\x80\x99s head its leaden eyeballs rolled,\r\n   And writhed its snaky horrors through the shield,\r\n      And gaped aghast with bloodless lips and cold\r\n   In passion impotent, while with blind gaze\r\n   The blinking owl between the feet hooted in shrill amaze.\r\n\r\n   The lonely fisher as he trimmed his lamp\r\n      Far out at sea off Sunium, or cast\r\n   The net for tunnies, heard a brazen tramp\r\n      Of horses smite the waves, and a wild blast\r\n   Divide the folded curtains of the night,\r\n   And knelt upon the little poop, and prayed in holy fright.\r\n\r\n   And guilty lovers in their venery\r\n      Forgat a little while their stolen sweets,\r\n   Deeming they heard dread Dian\xe2\x80\x99s bitter cry;\r\n      And the grim watchmen on their lofty seats\r\n   Ran to their shields in haste precipitate,\r\n   Or strained black-bearded throats across the dusky parapet.\r\n\r\n   For round the temple rolled the clang of arms,\r\n      And the twelve Gods leapt up in marble fear,\r\n   And the air quaked with dissonant alarums\r\n      Till huge Poseidon shook his mighty spear,\r\n   And on the frieze the prancing horses neighed,\r\n   And the low tread of hurrying feet rang from the cavalcade.\r\n\r\n   Ready for death with parted lips he stood,\r\n      And well content at such a price to see\r\n   That calm wide brow, that terrible maidenhood,\r\n      The marvel of that pitiless chastity,\r\n   Ah! well content indeed, for never wight\r\n   Since Troy\xe2\x80\x99s young shepherd prince had seen so wonderful a sight.\r\n\r\n   Ready for death he stood, but lo! the air\r\n      Grew silent, and the horses ceased to neigh,\r\n   And off his brow he tossed the clustering hair,\r\n      And from his limbs he throw the cloak away;\r\n   For whom would not such love make desperate?\r\n   And nigher came, and touched her throat, and with hands violate\r\n\r\n   Undid the cuirass, and the crocus gown,\r\n      And bared the breasts of polished ivory,\r\n   Till from the waist the peplos falling down\r\n      Left visible the secret mystery\r\n   Which to no lover will Athena show,\r\n   The grand cool flanks, the crescent thighs, the bossy hills of snow.\r\n\r\n   Those who have never known a lover\xe2\x80\x99s sin\r\n      Let them not read my ditty, it will be\r\n   To their dull ears so musicless and thin\r\n      That they will have no joy of it, but ye\r\n   To whose wan cheeks now creeps the lingering smile,\r\n   Ye who have learned who Eros is,\xe2\x80\x94O listen yet awhile.\r\n\r\n   A little space he let his greedy eyes\r\n      Rest on the burnished image, till mere sight\r\n   Half swooned for surfeit of such luxuries,\r\n      And then his lips in hungering delight\r\n   Fed on her lips, and round the towered neck\r\n   He flung his arms, nor cared at all his passion\xe2\x80\x99s will to check.\r\n\r\n   Never I ween did lover hold such tryst,\r\n      For all night long he murmured honeyed word,\r\n   And saw her sweet unravished limbs, and kissed\r\n      Her pale and argent body undisturbed,\r\n   And paddled with the polished throat, and pressed\r\n   His hot and beating heart upon her chill and icy breast.\r\n\r\n   It was as if Numidian javelins\r\n      Pierced through and through his wild and whirling brain,\r\n   And his nerves thrilled like throbbing violins\r\n      In exquisite pulsation, and the pain\r\n   Was such sweet anguish that he never drew\r\n   His lips from hers till overhead the lark of warning flew.\r\n\r\n   They who have never seen the daylight peer\r\n      Into a darkened room, and drawn the curtain,\r\n   And with dull eyes and wearied from some dear\r\n      And worshipped body risen, they for certain\r\n   Will never know of what I try to sing,\r\n   How long the last kiss was, how fond and late his lingering.\r\n\r\n   The moon was girdled with a crystal rim,\r\n      The sign which shipmen say is ominous\r\n   Of wrath in heaven, the wan stars were dim,\r\n      And the low lightening east was tremulous\r\n   With the faint fluttering wings of flying dawn,\r\n   Ere from the silent sombre shrine his lover had withdrawn.\r\n\r\n   Down the steep rock with hurried feet and fast\r\n      Clomb the brave lad, and reached the cave of Pan,\r\n   And heard the goat-foot snoring as he passed,\r\n      And leapt upon a grassy knoll and ran\r\n   Like a young fawn unto an olive wood\r\n   Which in a shady valley by the well-built city stood;\r\n\r\n   And sought a little stream, which well he knew,\r\n      For oftentimes with boyish careless shout\r\n   The green and crested grebe he would pursue,\r\n      Or snare in woven net the silver trout,\r\n   And down amid the startled reeds he lay\r\n   Panting in breathless sweet affright, and waited for the day.\r\n\r\n   On the green bank he lay, and let one hand\r\n      Dip in the cool dark eddies listlessly,\r\n   And soon the breath of morning came and fanned\r\n      His hot flushed cheeks, or lifted wantonly\r\n   The tangled curls from off his forehead, while\r\n   He on the running water gazed with strange and secret smile.\r\n\r\n   And soon the shepherd in rough woollen cloak\r\n      With his long crook undid the wattled cotes,\r\n   And from the stack a thin blue wreath of smoke\r\n      Curled through the air across the ripening oats,\r\n   And on the hill the yellow house-dog bayed\r\n   As through the crisp and rustling fern the heavy cattle strayed.\r\n\r\n   And when the light-foot mower went afield\r\n      Across the meadows laced with threaded dew,\r\n   And the sheep bleated on the misty weald,\r\n      And from its nest the waking corncrake flew,\r\n   Some woodmen saw him lying by the stream\r\n   And marvelled much that any lad so beautiful could seem,\r\n\r\n   Nor deemed him born of mortals, and one said,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98It is young Hylas, that false runaway\r\n   Who with a Naiad now would make his bed\r\n      Forgetting Herakles,\xe2\x80\x99 but others, \xe2\x80\x98Nay,\r\n   It is Narcissus, his own paramour,\r\n   Those are the fond and crimson lips no woman can allure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n   And when they nearer came a third one cried,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98It is young Dionysos who has hid\r\n   His spear and fawnskin by the river side\r\n      Weary of hunting with the Bassarid,\r\n   And wise indeed were we away to fly:\r\n   They live not long who on the gods immortal come to spy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n   So turned they back, and feared to look behind,\r\n      And told the timid swain how they had seen\r\n   Amid the reeds some woodland god reclined,\r\n      And no man dared to cross the open green,\r\n   And on that day no olive-tree was slain,\r\n   Nor rushes cut, but all deserted was the fair domain,\r\n\r\n   Save when the neat-herd\xe2\x80\x99s lad, his empty pail\r\n      Well slung upon his back, with leap and bound\r\n   Raced on the other side, and stopped to hail,\r\n      Hoping that he some comrade new had found,\r\n   And gat no answer, and then half afraid\r\n   Passed on his simple way, or down the still and silent glade\r\n\r\n   A little girl ran laughing from the farm,\r\n      Not thinking of love\xe2\x80\x99s secret mysteries,\r\n   And when she saw the white and gleaming arm\r\n      And all his manlihood, with longing eyes\r\n   Whose passion mocked her sweet virginity\r\n   Watched him awhile, and then stole back sadly and wearily.\r\n\r\n   Far off he heard the city\xe2\x80\x99s hum and noise,\r\n      And now and then the shriller laughter where\r\n   The passionate purity of brown-limbed boys\r\n      Wrestled or raced in the clear healthful air,\r\n   And now and then a little tinkling bell\r\n   As the shorn wether led the sheep down to the mossy well.\r\n\r\n   Through the grey willows danced the fretful gnat,\r\n      The grasshopper chirped idly from the tree,\r\n   In sleek and oily coat the water-rat\r\n      Breasting the little ripples manfully\r\n   Made for the wild-duck\xe2\x80\x99s nest, from bough to bough\r\n   Hopped the shy finch, and the huge tortoise crept across the slough.\r\n\r\n   On the faint wind floated the silky seeds\r\n      As the bright scythe swept through the waving grass,\r\n   The ouzel-cock splashed circles in the reeds\r\n      And flecked with silver whorls the forest\xe2\x80\x99s glass,\r\n   Which scarce had caught again its imagery\r\n   Ere from its bed the dusky tench leapt at the dragon-fly.\r\n\r\n   But little care had he for any thing\r\n      Though up and down the beech the squirrel played,\r\n   And from the copse the linnet \xe2\x80\x99gan to sing\r\n      To its brown mate its sweetest serenade;\r\n   Ah! little care indeed, for he had seen\r\n   The breasts of Pallas and the naked wonder of the Queen.\r\n\r\n   But when the herdsman called his straggling goats\r\n      With whistling pipe across the rocky road,\r\n   And the shard-beetle with its trumpet-notes\r\n      Boomed through the darkening woods, and seemed to bode\r\n   Of coming storm, and the belated crane\r\n   Passed homeward like a shadow, and the dull big drops of rain\r\n\r\n   Fell on the pattering fig-leaves, up he rose,\r\n      And from the gloomy forest went his way\r\n   Past sombre homestead and wet orchard-close,\r\n      And came at last unto a little quay,\r\n   And called his mates aboard, and took his seat\r\n   On the high poop, and pushed from land, and loosed the dripping sheet,\r\n\r\n   And steered across the bay, and when nine suns\r\n      Passed down the long and laddered way of gold,\r\n   And nine pale moons had breathed their orisons\r\n      To the chaste stars their confessors, or told\r\n   Their dearest secret to the downy moth\r\n   That will not fly at noonday, through the foam and surging froth\r\n\r\n   Came a great owl with yellow sulphurous eyes\r\n      And lit upon the ship, whose timbers creaked\r\n   As though the lading of three argosies\r\n      Were in the hold, and flapped its wings and shrieked,\r\n   And darkness straightway stole across the deep,\r\n   Sheathed was Orion\xe2\x80\x99s sword, dread Mars himself fled down the steep,\r\n\r\n   And the moon hid behind a tawny mask\r\n      Of drifting cloud, and from the ocean\xe2\x80\x99s marge\r\n   Rose the red plume, the huge and horn\xc3\xa8d casque,\r\n      The seven-cubit spear, the brazen targe!\r\n   And clad in bright and burnished panoply\r\n   Athena strode across the stretch of sick and shivering sea!\r\n\r\n   To the dull sailors\xe2\x80\x99 sight her loosened looks\r\n      Seemed like the jagged storm-rack, and her feet\r\n   Only the spume that floats on hidden rocks,\r\n      And, marking how the rising waters beat\r\n   Against the rolling ship, the pilot cried\r\n   To the young helmsman at the stern to luff to windward side\r\n\r\n   But he, the overbold adulterer,\r\n      A dear profaner of great mysteries,\r\n   An ardent amorous idolater,\r\n      When he beheld those grand relentless eyes\r\n   Laughed loud for joy, and crying out \xe2\x80\x98I come\xe2\x80\x99\r\n   Leapt from the lofty poop into the chill and churning foam.\r\n\r\n   Then fell from the high heaven one bright star,\r\n      One dancer left the circling galaxy,\r\n   And back to Athens on her clattering car\r\n      In all the pride of venged divinity\r\n   Pale Pallas swept with shrill and steely clank,\r\n   And a few gurgling bubbles rose where her boy lover sank.\r\n\r\n   And the mast shuddered as the gaunt owl flew\r\n      With mocking hoots after the wrathful Queen,\r\n   And the old pilot bade the trembling crew\r\n      Hoist the big sail, and told how he had seen\r\n   Close to the stern a dim and giant form,\r\n   And like a dipping swallow the stout ship dashed through the storm.\r\n\r\n   And no man dared to speak of Charmides\r\n      Deeming that he some evil thing had wrought,\r\n   And when they reached the strait Symplegades\r\n      They beached their galley on the shore, and sought\r\n   The toll-gate of the city hastily,\r\n   And in the market showed their brown and pictured pottery.\r\n\r\n                                     II.\r\n\r\n   BUT some good Triton-god had ruth, and bare\r\n      The boy\xe2\x80\x99s drowned body back to Grecian land,\r\n   And mermaids combed his dank and dripping hair\r\n      And smoothed his brow, and loosed his clenching hand;\r\n   Some brought sweet spices from far Araby,\r\n   And others bade the halcyon sing her softest lullaby.\r\n\r\n   And when he neared his old Athenian home,\r\n      A mighty billow rose up suddenly\r\n   Upon whose oily back the clotted foam\r\n      Lay diapered in some strange fantasy,\r\n   And clasping him unto its glassy breast\r\n   Swept landward, like a white-maned steed upon a venturous quest!\r\n\r\n   Now where Colonos leans unto the sea\r\n      There lies a long and level stretch of lawn;\r\n   The rabbit knows it, and the mountain bee\r\n      For it deserts Hymettus, and the Faun\r\n   Is not afraid, for never through the day\r\n   Comes a cry ruder than the shout of shepherd lads at play.\r\n\r\n   But often from the thorny labyrinth\r\n      And tangled branches of the circling wood\r\n   The stealthy hunter sees young Hyacinth\r\n      Hurling the polished disk, and draws his hood\r\n   Over his guilty gaze, and creeps away,\r\n   Nor dares to wind his horn, or\xe2\x80\x94else at the first break of day\r\n\r\n   The Dryads come and throw the leathern ball\r\n      Along the reedy shore, and circumvent\r\n   Some goat-eared Pan to be their seneschal\r\n      For fear of bold Poseidon\xe2\x80\x99s ravishment,\r\n   And loose their girdles, with shy timorous eyes,\r\n   Lest from the surf his azure arms and purple beard should rise.\r\n\r\n   On this side and on that a rocky cave,\r\n      Hung with the yellow-belled laburnum, stands\r\n   Smooth is the beach, save where some ebbing wave\r\n      Leaves its faint outline etched upon the sands,\r\n   As though it feared to be too soon forgot\r\n   By the green rush, its playfellow,\xe2\x80\x94and yet, it is a spot\r\n\r\n   So small, that the inconstant butterfly\r\n      Could steal the hoarded money from each flower\r\n   Ere it was noon, and still not satisfy\r\n      Its over-greedy love,\xe2\x80\x94within an hour\r\n   A sailor boy, were he but rude enow\r\n   To land and pluck a garland for his galley\xe2\x80\x99s painted prow,\r\n\r\n   Would almost leave the little meadow bare,\r\n      For it knows nothing of great pageantry,\r\n   Only a few narcissi here and there\r\n      Stand separate in sweet austerity,\r\n   Dotting the unmown grass with silver stars,\r\n   And here and there a daffodil waves tiny scimitars.\r\n\r\n   Hither the billow brought him, and was glad\r\n      Of such dear servitude, and where the land\r\n   Was virgin of all waters laid the lad\r\n      Upon the golden margent of the strand,\r\n   And like a lingering lover oft returned\r\n   To kiss those pallid limbs which once with intense fire burned,\r\n\r\n   Ere the wet seas had quenched that holocaust,\r\n      That self-fed flame, that passionate lustihead,\r\n   Ere grisly death with chill and nipping frost\r\n      Had withered up those lilies white and red\r\n   Which, while the boy would through the forest range,\r\n   Answered each other in a sweet antiphonal counter-change.\r\n\r\n   And when at dawn the wood-nymphs, hand-in-hand,\r\n      Threaded the bosky dell, their satyr spied\r\n   The boy\xe2\x80\x99s pale body stretched upon the sand,\r\n      And feared Poseidon\xe2\x80\x99s treachery, and cried,\r\n   And like bright sunbeams flitting through a glade\r\n   Each startled Dryad sought some safe and leafy ambuscade.\r\n\r\n   Save one white girl, who deemed it would not be\r\n      So dread a thing to feel a sea-god\xe2\x80\x99s arms\r\n   Crushing her breasts in amorous tyranny,\r\n      And longed to listen to those subtle charms\r\n   Insidious lovers weave when they would win\r\n   Some fenc\xc3\xa8d fortress, and stole back again, nor thought it sin\r\n\r\n   To yield her treasure unto one so fair,\r\n      And lay beside him, thirsty with love\xe2\x80\x99s drouth,\r\n   Called him soft names, played with his tangled hair,\r\n      And with hot lips made havoc of his mouth\r\n   Afraid he might not wake, and then afraid\r\n   Lest he might wake too soon, fled back, and then, fond renegade,\r\n\r\n   Returned to fresh assault, and all day long\r\n      Sat at his side, and laughed at her new toy,\r\n   And held his hand, and sang her sweetest song,\r\n      Then frowned to see how froward was the boy\r\n   Who would not with her maidenhood entwine,\r\n   Nor knew that three days since his eyes had looked on Proserpine;\r\n\r\n   Nor knew what sacrilege his lips had done,\r\n      But said, \xe2\x80\x98He will awake, I know him well,\r\n   He will awake at evening when the sun\r\n      Hangs his red shield on Corinth\xe2\x80\x99s citadel;\r\n   This sleep is but a cruel treachery\r\n   To make me love him more, and in some cavern of the sea\r\n\r\n   Deeper than ever falls the fisher\xe2\x80\x99s line\r\n      Already a huge Triton blows his horn,\r\n   And weaves a garland from the crystalline\r\n      And drifting ocean-tendrils to adorn\r\n   The emerald pillars of our bridal bed,\r\n   For sphered in foaming silver, and with coral crown\xc3\xa8d head,\r\n\r\n   We two will sit upon a throne of pearl,\r\n      And a blue wave will be our canopy,\r\n   And at our feet the water-snakes will curl\r\n      In all their amethystine panoply\r\n   Of diamonded mail, and we will mark\r\n   The mullets swimming by the mast of some storm-foundered bark,\r\n\r\n   Vermilion-finned with eyes of bossy gold\r\n      Like flakes of crimson light, and the great deep\r\n   His glassy-portaled chamber will unfold,\r\n      And we will see the painted dolphins sleep\r\n   Cradled by murmuring halcyons on the rocks\r\n   Where Proteus in quaint suit of green pastures his monstrous flocks.\r\n\r\n   And tremulous opal-hued anemones\r\n      Will wave their purple fringes where we tread\r\n   Upon the mirrored floor, and argosies\r\n      Of fishes flecked with tawny scales will thread\r\n   The drifting cordage of the shattered wreck,\r\n   And honey-coloured amber beads our twining limbs will deck.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n   But when that baffled Lord of War the Sun\r\n      With gaudy pennon flying passed away\r\n   Into his brazen House, and one by one\r\n      The little yellow stars began to stray\r\n   Across the field of heaven, ah! then indeed\r\n   She feared his lips upon her lips would never care to feed,\r\n\r\n   And cried, \xe2\x80\x98Awake, already the pale moon\r\n      Washes the trees with silver, and the wave\r\n   Creeps grey and chilly up this sandy dune,\r\n      The croaking frogs are out, and from the cave\r\n   The nightjar shrieks, the fluttering bats repass,\r\n   And the brown stoat with hollow flanks creeps through the dusky grass.\r\n\r\n   Nay, though thou art a god, be not so coy,\r\n      For in yon stream there is a little reed\r\n   That often whispers how a lovely boy\r\n      Lay with her once upon a grassy mead,\r\n   Who when his cruel pleasure he had done\r\n   Spread wings of rustling gold and soared aloft into the sun.\r\n\r\n   Be not so coy, the laurel trembles still\r\n      With great Apollo\xe2\x80\x99s kisses, and the fir\r\n   Whose clustering sisters fringe the seaward hill\r\n      Hath many a tale of that bold ravisher\r\n   Whom men call Boreas, and I have seen\r\n   The mocking eyes of Hermes through the poplar\xe2\x80\x99s silvery sheen.\r\n\r\n   Even the jealous Naiads call me fair,\r\n      And every morn a young and ruddy swain\r\n   Woos me with apples and with locks of hair,\r\n      And seeks to soothe my virginal disdain\r\n   By all the gifts the gentle wood-nymphs love;\r\n   But yesterday he brought to me an iris-plumaged dove\r\n\r\n   With little crimson feet, which with its store\r\n      Of seven spotted eggs the cruel lad\r\n   Had stolen from the lofty sycamore\r\n      At daybreak, when her amorous comrade had\r\n   Flown off in search of berried juniper\r\n   Which most they love; the fretful wasp, that earliest vintager\r\n\r\n   Of the blue grapes, hath not persistency\r\n      So constant as this simple shepherd-boy\r\n   For my poor lips, his joyous purity\r\n      And laughing sunny eyes might well decoy\r\n   A Dryad from her oath to Artemis;\r\n   For very beautiful is he, his mouth was made to kiss;\r\n\r\n   His argent forehead, like a rising moon\r\n      Over the dusky hills of meeting brows,\r\n   Is crescent shaped, the hot and Tyrian noon\r\n      Leads from the myrtle-grove no goodlier spouse\r\n   For Cyther\xc3\xa6a, the first silky down\r\n   Fringes his blushing cheeks, and his young limbs are strong and brown;\r\n\r\n   And he is rich, and fat and fleecy herds\r\n      Of bleating sheep upon his meadows lie,\r\n   And many an earthen bowl of yellow curds\r\n      Is in his homestead for the thievish fly\r\n   To swim and drown in, the pink clover mead\r\n   Keeps its sweet store for him, and he can pipe on oaten reed.\r\n\r\n   And yet I love him not; it was for thee\r\n      I kept my love; I knew that thou would\xe2\x80\x99st come\r\n   To rid me of this pallid chastity,\r\n      Thou fairest flower of the flowerless foam\r\n   Of all the wide \xc3\x86gean, brightest star\r\n   Of ocean\xe2\x80\x99s azure heavens where the mirrored planets are!\r\n\r\n   I knew that thou would\xe2\x80\x99st come, for when at first\r\n      The dry wood burgeoned, and the sap of spring\r\n   Swelled in my green and tender bark or burst\r\n      To myriad multitudinous blossoming\r\n   Which mocked the midnight with its mimic moons\r\n   That did not dread the dawn, and first the thrushes\xe2\x80\x99 rapturous tunes\r\n\r\n   Startled the squirrel from its granary,\r\n      And cuckoo flowers fringed the narrow lane,\r\n   Through my young leaves a sensuous ecstasy\r\n      Crept like new wine, and every mossy vein\r\n   Throbbed with the fitful pulse of amorous blood,\r\n   And the wild winds of passion shook my slim stem\xe2\x80\x99s maidenhood.\r\n\r\n   The trooping fawns at evening came and laid\r\n      Their cool black noses on my lowest boughs,\r\n   And on my topmost branch the blackbird made\r\n      A little nest of grasses for his spouse,\r\n   And now and then a twittering wren would light\r\n   On a thin twig which hardly bare the weight of such delight.\r\n\r\n   I was the Attic shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s trysting place,\r\n      Beneath my shadow Amaryllis lay,\r\n   And round my trunk would laughing Daphnis chase\r\n      The timorous girl, till tired out with play\r\n   She felt his hot breath stir her tangled hair,\r\n   And turned, and looked, and fled no more from such delightful snare.\r\n\r\n   Then come away unto my ambuscade\r\n      Where clustering woodbine weaves a canopy\r\n   For amorous pleasaunce, and the rustling shade\r\n      Of Paphian myrtles seems to sanctify\r\n   The dearest rites of love; there in the cool\r\n   And green recesses of its farthest depth there is pool,\r\n\r\n   The ouzel\xe2\x80\x99s haunt, the wild bee\xe2\x80\x99s pasturage,\r\n      For round its rim great creamy lilies float\r\n   Through their flat leaves in verdant anchorage,\r\n      Each cup a white-sailed golden-laden boat\r\n   Steered by a dragon-fly,\xe2\x80\x94be not afraid\r\n   To leave this wan and wave-kissed shore, surely the place was made\r\n\r\n   For lovers such as we; the Cyprian Queen,\r\n      One arm around her boyish paramour,\r\n   Strays often there at eve, and I have seen\r\n      The moon strip off her misty vestiture\r\n   For young Endymion\xe2\x80\x99s eyes; be not afraid,\r\n   The panther feet of Dian never tread that secret glade.\r\n\r\n   Nay if thou will\xe2\x80\x99st, back to the beating brine,\r\n      Back to the boisterous billow let us go,\r\n   And walk all day beneath the hyaline\r\n      Huge vault of Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s watery portico,\r\n   And watch the purple monsters of the deep\r\n   Sport in ungainly play, and from his lair keen Xiphias leap.\r\n\r\n   For if my mistress find me lying here\r\n      She will not ruth or gentle pity show,\r\n   But lay her boar-spear down, and with austere\r\n      Relentless fingers string the cornel bow,\r\n   And draw the feathered notch against her breast,\r\n   And loose the arch\xc3\xa8d cord; aye, even now upon the quest\r\n\r\n   I hear her hurrying feet,\xe2\x80\x94awake, awake,\r\n      Thou laggard in love\xe2\x80\x99s battle! once at least\r\n   Let me drink deep of passion\xe2\x80\x99s wine, and slake\r\n      My parch\xc3\xa8d being with the nectarous feast\r\n   Which even gods affect!  O come, Love, come,\r\n   Still we have time to reach the cavern of thine azure home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n   Scarce had she spoken when the shuddering trees\r\n      Shook, and the leaves divided, and the air\r\n   Grew conscious of a god, and the grey seas\r\n      Crawled backward, and a long and dismal blare\r\n   Blew from some tasselled horn, a sleuth-hound bayed,\r\n   And like a flame a barb\xc3\xa8d reed flew whizzing down the glade.\r\n\r\n   And where the little flowers of her breast\r\n      Just brake into their milky blossoming,\r\n   This murderous paramour, this unbidden guest,\r\n      Pierced and struck deep in horrid chambering,\r\n   And ploughed a bloody furrow with its dart,\r\n   And dug a long red road, and cleft with wing\xc3\xa8d death her heart.\r\n\r\n   Sobbing her life out with a bitter cry\r\n      On the boy\xe2\x80\x99s body fell the Dryad maid,\r\n   Sobbing for incomplete virginity,\r\n      And raptures unenjoyed, and pleasures dead,\r\n   And all the pain of things unsatisfied,\r\n   And the bright drops of crimson youth crept down her throbbing side.\r\n\r\n   Ah! pitiful it was to hear her moan,\r\n      And very pitiful to see her die\r\n   Ere she had yielded up her sweets, or known\r\n      The joy of passion, that dread mystery\r\n   Which not to know is not to live at all,\r\n   And yet to know is to be held in death\xe2\x80\x99s most deadly thrall.\r\n\r\n   But as it hapt the Queen of Cythere,\r\n      Who with Adonis all night long had lain\r\n   Within some shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s hut in Arcady,\r\n      On team of silver doves and gilded wain\r\n   Was journeying Paphos-ward, high up afar\r\n   From mortal ken between the mountains and the morning star,\r\n\r\n   And when low down she spied the hapless pair,\r\n      And heard the Oread\xe2\x80\x99s faint despairing cry,\r\n   Whose cadence seemed to play upon the air\r\n      As though it were a viol, hastily\r\n   She bade her pigeons fold each straining plume,\r\n   And dropt to earth, and reached the strand, and saw their dolorous\r\n   doom.\r\n\r\n   For as a gardener turning back his head\r\n      To catch the last notes of the linnet, mows\r\n   With careless scythe too near some flower bed,\r\n      And cuts the thorny pillar of the rose,\r\n   And with the flower\xe2\x80\x99s loosened loneliness\r\n   Strews the brown mould; or as some shepherd lad in wantonness\r\n\r\n   Driving his little flock along the mead\r\n      Treads down two daffodils, which side by aide\r\n   Have lured the lady-bird with yellow brede\r\n      And made the gaudy moth forget its pride,\r\n   Treads down their brimming golden chalices\r\n   Under light feet which were not made for such rude ravages;\r\n\r\n   Or as a schoolboy tired of his book\r\n      Flings himself down upon the reedy grass\r\n   And plucks two water-lilies from the brook,\r\n      And for a time forgets the hour glass,\r\n   Then wearies of their sweets, and goes his way,\r\n   And lets the hot sun kill them, even go these lovers lay.\r\n\r\n   And Venus cried, \xe2\x80\x98It is dread Artemis\r\n      Whose bitter hand hath wrought this cruelty,\r\n   Or else that mightier maid whose care it is\r\n      To guard her strong and stainless majesty\r\n   Upon the hill Athenian,\xe2\x80\x94alas!\r\n   That they who loved so well unloved into Death\xe2\x80\x99s house should pass.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n   So with soft hands she laid the boy and girl\r\n      In the great golden waggon tenderly\r\n   (Her white throat whiter than a moony pearl\r\n      Just threaded with a blue vein\xe2\x80\x99s tapestry\r\n   Had not yet ceased to throb, and still her breast\r\n   Swayed like a wind-stirred lily in ambiguous unrest)\r\n\r\n   And then each pigeon spread its milky van,\r\n      The bright car soared into the dawning sky,\r\n   And like a cloud the aerial caravan\r\n      Passed over the \xc3\x86gean silently,\r\n   Till the faint air was troubled with the song\r\n   From the wan mouths that call on bleeding Thammuz all night long.\r\n\r\n   But when the doves had reached their wonted goal\r\n      Where the wide stair of orb\xc3\xa8d marble dips\r\n   Its snows into the sea, her fluttering soul\r\n      Just shook the trembling petals of her lips\r\n   And passed into the void, and Venus knew\r\n   That one fair maid the less would walk amid her retinue,\r\n\r\n   And bade her servants carve a cedar chest\r\n      With all the wonder of this history,\r\n   Within whose scented womb their limbs should rest\r\n      Where olive-trees make tender the blue sky\r\n   On the low hills of Paphos, and the Faun\r\n   Pipes in the noonday, and the nightingale sings on till dawn.\r\n\r\n   Nor failed they to obey her hest, and ere\r\n      The morning bee had stung the daffodil\r\n   With tiny fretful spear, or from its lair\r\n      The waking stag had leapt across the rill\r\n   And roused the ouzel, or the lizard crept\r\n   Athwart the sunny rock, beneath the grass their bodies slept.\r\n\r\n   And when day brake, within that silver shrine\r\n      Fed by the flames of cressets tremulous,\r\n   Queen Venus knelt and prayed to Proserpine\r\n      That she whose beauty made Death amorous\r\n   Should beg a guerdon from her pallid Lord,\r\n   And let Desire pass across dread Charon\xe2\x80\x99s icy ford.\r\n\r\n                                     III\r\n\r\n   IN melancholy moonless Acheron,\r\n      Farm for the goodly earth and joyous day\r\n   Where no spring ever buds, nor ripening sun\r\n      Weighs down the apple trees, nor flowery May\r\n   Chequers with chestnut blooms the grassy floor,\r\n   Where thrushes never sing, and piping linnets mate no more,\r\n\r\n   There by a dim and dark Leth\xc3\xa6an well\r\n      Young Charmides was lying; wearily\r\n   He plucked the blossoms from the asphodel,\r\n      And with its little rifled treasury\r\n   Strewed the dull waters of the dusky stream,\r\n   And watched the white stars founder, and the land was like a dream,\r\n\r\n   When as he gazed into the watery glass\r\n      And through his brown hair\xe2\x80\x99s curly tangles scanned\r\n   His own wan face, a shadow seemed to pass\r\n      Across the mirror, and a little hand\r\n   Stole into his, and warm lips timidly\r\n   Brushed his pale cheeks, and breathed their secret forth into a sigh.\r\n\r\n   Then turned he round his weary eyes and saw,\r\n      And ever nigher still their faces came,\r\n   And nigher ever did their young mouths draw\r\n      Until they seemed one perfect rose of flame,\r\n   And longing arms around her neck he cast,\r\n   And felt her throbbing bosom, and his breath came hot and fast,\r\n\r\n   And all his hoarded sweets were hers to kiss,\r\n      And all her maidenhood was his to slay,\r\n   And limb to limb in long and rapturous bliss\r\n      Their passion waxed and waned,\xe2\x80\x94O why essay\r\n   To pipe again of love, too venturous reed!\r\n   Enough, enough that Eros laughed upon that flowerless mead.\r\n\r\n   Too venturous poesy, O why essay\r\n      To pipe again of passion! fold thy wings\r\n   O\xe2\x80\x99er daring Icarus and bid thy lay\r\n      Sleep hidden in the lyre\xe2\x80\x99s silent strings\r\n   Till thou hast found the old Castalian rill,\r\n   Or from the Lesbian waters plucked drowned Sappho\xe2\x80\x99s golden quid!\r\n\r\n   Enough, enough that he whose life had been\r\n      A fiery pulse of sin, a splendid shame,\r\n   Could in the loveless land of Hades glean\r\n      One scorching harvest from those fields of flame\r\n   Where passion walks with naked unshod feet\r\n   And is not wounded,\xe2\x80\x94ah! enough that once their lips could meet\r\n\r\n   In that wild throb when all existences\r\n      Seemed narrowed to one single ecstasy\r\n   Which dies through its own sweetness and the stress\r\n      Of too much pleasure, ere Persephone\r\n   Had bade them serve her by the ebon throne\r\n   Of the pale God who in the fields of Enna loosed her zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOWERS OF GOLD\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPRESSIONS\r\n\r\nI\r\nLES SILHOUETTES\r\n\r\n\r\n      THE sea is flecked with bars of grey,\r\n      The dull dead wind is out of tune,\r\n      And like a withered leaf the moon\r\n   Is blown across the stormy bay.\r\n\r\n      Etched clear upon the pallid sand\r\n      Lies the black boat: a sailor boy\r\n      Clambers aboard in careless joy\r\n   With laughing face and gleaming hand.\r\n\r\n      And overhead the curlews cry,\r\n      Where through the dusky upland grass\r\n      The young brown-throated reapers pass,\r\n   Like silhouettes against the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nLA FUITE DE LA LUNE\r\n\r\n\r\n      TO outer senses there is peace,\r\n      A dreamy peace on either hand\r\n      Deep silence in the shadowy land,\r\n   Deep silence where the shadows cease.\r\n\r\n      Save for a cry that echoes shrill\r\n      From some lone bird disconsolate;\r\n      A corncrake calling to its mate;\r\n   The answer from the misty hill.\r\n\r\n      And suddenly the moon withdraws\r\n      Her sickle from the lightening skies,\r\n      And to her sombre cavern flies,\r\n   Wrapped in a veil of yellow gauze.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAVE OF KEATS\r\n\r\n\r\n   RID of the world\xe2\x80\x99s injustice, and his pain,\r\n      He rests at last

waves show their teeth in the flying breeze.\r\n\r\n   Her gold hair fell on the wall of gold\r\n      Like the delicate gossamer tangles spun\r\n   On the burnished disk of the marigold,\r\n      Or

might ravel the threads by the fire-light.\r\n\r\n   Perchance she is hunting of the deer,\r\n   How could you follow o\xe2\x80\x99er hill and mere?\r\n\r\n   Ah, if she is riding with the court,\r\n   I might run beside her and wind the morte.\r\n\r\n   Perchance she is kneeling in St. Denys,\r\n   (On her soul may our Lady have gramercy!)\r\n\r\n   Ah, if she is praying in lone chapelle,\r\n   I might swing the censer and ring the bell.\r\n\r\n   Come in, my son, for you look sae pale,\r\n   The father shall fill thee a stoup of ale.\r\n\r\n   But who are these knights in bright array?\r\n

O forehead crowned with thorn!\r\n      O chalice of all common miseries!\r\n   Thou for our sakes that loved thee not hast borne\r\n      An agony of endless centuries,\r\n   And we were vain and

fade,\r\n   The spear that pierces and the side that bleeds,\r\n      The lips betraying and the life betrayed;\r\n   The deep hath calm: the moon hath rest: but we\r\n   Lords of the natural world are yet our own dread enemy.\r\n\r\n   Is this the end of all that primal force\r\n      Which, in its changes being still the same,\r\n   From eyeless Chaos cleft its upward course,\r\n      Through ravenous seas and whirling rocks and flame,\r\n   Till the suns met in heaven and began\r\n   Their cycles, and the morning stars sang, and the Word was Man!\r\n\r\n   Nay, nay, we are but crucified, and though\r\n      The bloody sweat falls from our brows like rain\r\n   Loosen the nails\xe2\x80\x94we shall come down I know,\r\n      Staunch the red wounds\xe2\x80\x94we shall be whole again,\r\n

   was, had I not been made of common clay\r\n   I had climbed the higher heights unclimbed\r\n      yet, seen the fuller air, the larger day.\r\n\r\n   From the wildness of my wasted passion I had\r\n      struck a better, clearer song,\r\n   Lit some lighter light of freer freedom, battled\r\n      with some Hydra-headed wrong.\r\n\r\n   Had my lips been smitten into music by the\r\n      kisses that but made them bleed,\r\n   You had walked with Bice and the angels on\r\n      that verdant and enamelled mead.\r\n\r\n   I had trod the road which Dante treading saw\r\n      the suns of seven circles shine,\r\n   Ay! perchance had seen the heavens opening,\r\n      as they opened to the Florentine.\r\n\r\n   And the mighty nations would have crowned\r\n      me, who am crownless now and without name,\r\n   And some orient dawn had found me kneeling\r\n      on the threshold of the House of Fame.\r\n\r\n   I had sat within that marble circle where the\r\n      oldest bard is as the young,\r\n   And the pipe is ever dropping honey, and the\r\n      lyre\xe2\x80\x99s strings are ever strung.\r\n\r\n   Keats had lifted up his hymeneal curls from out\r\n      the poppy-seeded wine,\r\n   With ambrosial mouth had kissed my forehead,\r\n      clasped the hand of noble love in mine.\r\n\r\n   And at springtide, when the apple-blossoms brush\r\n      the burnished bosom of the dove,\r\n   Two young lovers lying in an orchard would\r\n      have read the story of our love.\r\n\r\n   Would have read the legend of my passion,\r\n      known the bitter secret of my heart,\r\n   Kissed as we have kissed, but never parted as\r\n      we two are fated now to part.\r\n\r\n   For the crimson flower of our life is eaten by\r\n      the cankerworm of truth,\r\n   And no hand can gather up the fallen withered\r\n      petals of the rose of youth.\r\n\r\n   Yet I am not sorry that I loved you\xe2\x80\x94ah! what\r\n      else had I a boy to do,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n   For the hungry teeth of time devour, and the\r\n      silent-footed years pursue.\r\n\r\n   Rudderless, we drift athwart a tempest, and\r\n      when once the storm of youth is past,\r\n   Without lyre, without lute

the tree of\r\n      Passion bears no fruit.\r\n\r\n   Ah! what else had I to do but love you, God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      own mother was less dear to me,\r\n   And less dear the Cyther\xc3\xa6an rising

gold,\r\n      And from the beech-trees on the wold\r\n   The last wood-pigeon coos and calls.\r\n\r\n   The gaudy leonine sunflower\r\n      Hangs black and barren on its stalk,\r\n      And down the windy garden walk\r\n   The dead leaves scatter,\xe2\x80\x94hour by hour.\r\n\r\n   Pale privet-petals white as milk\r\n      Are blown into a snowy mass:\r\n      The roses lie upon the grass\r\n   Like little shreds of crimson silk.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nLA MER\r\n\r\n\r\n   A WHITE mist drifts across the shrouds,\r\n      A wild moon in this wintry sky\r\n      Gleams like an angry lion\xe2\x80\x99s eye\r\n   Out of a mane of tawny clouds.\r\n\r\n   The muffled steersman at the wheel\r\n      Is but a shadow in the gloom;\xe2\x80\x94\r\n      And in the throbbing engine-room\r\n   Leap the long rods of polished steel.\r\n\r\n   The shattered storm has left its trace\r\n      Upon this huge and heaving dome,\r\n      For the thin threads of yellow foam\r\n   Float on the waves like ravelled lace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDER THE BALCONY\r\n\r\n\r\n   O BEAUTIFUL star with the crimson mouth!\r\n      O moon with the brows of gold!\r\n   Rise up, rise up, from the odorous south!\r\n         And light for my love her way,\r\n         Lest her little feet should stray\r\n      On the windy hill and the wold!\r\n   O beautiful star with the crimson mouth!\r\n      O moon with the brows of gold!\r\n\r\n   O ship that shakes on the desolate sea!\r\n      O ship with the wet, white sail!\r\n   Put in, put in, to the port to me!\r\n         For my love and I would go\r\n         To the land where the daffodils blow\r\n      In the heart of a violet dale!\r\n   O ship that shakes on the desolate sea!\r\n      O ship with the wet, white sail!\r\n\r\n   O rapturous bird with the low, sweet note!\r\n      O bird that sits on the spray!\r\n   Sing on, sing on, from your soft brown throat!\r\n         And my love in her little bed\r\n         Will listen, and lift her head\r\n      From the pillow, and come my way!\r\n   O rapturous bird with the low, sweet note!\r\n      O bird that sits on the spray!\r\n\r\n   O blossom that hangs in the tremulous air!\r\n      O blossom with lips of snow!\r\n   Come down, come down, for my love to wear!\r\n         You will die on her head in a crown,\r\n         You will die in a fold of her gown,\r\n      To her little light heart you will go!\r\n   O blossom that hangs in the tremulous air!\r\n      O blossom with lips of snow!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HARLOT\xe2\x80\x99S HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\n   WE caught the tread of dancing feet,\r\n   We loitered down the moonlit street,\r\n   And stopped beneath the harlot\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n   Inside, above the din and fray,\r\n   We heard the loud musicians play\r\n   The \xe2\x80\x98Treues Liebes Herz\xe2\x80\x99 of Strauss.\r\n\r\n   Like strange mechanical grotesques,\r\n   Making fantastic arabesques,\r\n   The shadows raced across the blind.\r\n\r\n   We watched the ghostly dancers spin\r\n   To sound of horn and violin,\r\n   Like black leaves wheeling in the wind.\r\n\r\n   Like wire-pulled automatons,\r\n   Slim silhouetted skeletons\r\n   Went sidling through the slow quadrille,\r\n\r\n   Then took each other by the hand,\r\n   And danced a stately saraband;\r\n   Their laughter echoed thin and shrill.\r\n\r\n   Sometimes a clockwork puppet pressed\r\n   A phantom lover to her breast,\r\n   Sometimes they seemed to try to sing.\r\n\r\n   Sometimes a horrible marionette\r\n   Came out, and smoked its cigarette\r\n   Upon the steps like a live thing.\r\n\r\n   Then, turning to my love, I said,\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98The dead are dancing with the dead,\r\n   The dust is whirling with the dust.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n   But she\xe2\x80\x94she heard the violin,\r\n   And left my side, and entered in:\r\n   Love passed into the house of lust.\r\n\r\n   Then suddenly the tune went false,\r\n   The dancers wearied of the waltz,\r\n   The shadows ceased to wheel and whirl.\r\n\r\n   And down the long and silent street,\r\n   The dawn, with silver-sandalled feet,\r\n   Crept like a frightened girl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLE JARDIN DES TUILERIES\r\n\r\n\r\n   THIS winter air is keen and cold,\r\n      And keen and cold this winter sun,\r\n      But round my chair the children run\r\n   Like little things of dancing gold.\r\n\r\n   Sometimes about the painted kiosk\r\n      The mimic soldiers strut and stride,\r\n      Sometimes the blue-eyed brigands hide\r\n   In the bleak tangles of the bosk.\r\n\r\n   And sometimes, while the old nurse cons\r\n      Her book, they steal across the square,\r\n      And launch their paper navies where\r\n   Huge Triton writhes in greenish bronze.\r\n\r\n   And now in mimic flight they flee,\r\n      And now they rush, a boisterous band\xe2\x80\x94\r\n      And, tiny hand on tiny hand,\r\n   Climb up the black and leafless tree.\r\n\r\n   Ah! cruel tree! if I were you,\r\n      And children climbed me, for their sake\r\n      Though it be winter I would break\r\n   Into spring blossoms white and blue!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE SALE BY AUCTION OF KEATS\xe2\x80\x99 LOVE LETTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n   THESE are the letters which Endymion wrote\r\n      To one he loved in secret, and apart.\r\n      And now the brawlers of the auction mart\r\n   Bargain and bid for each poor blotted note,\r\n   Ay! for each separate pulse of passion quote\r\n      The merchant\xe2\x80\x99s price.  I think they love not art\r\n      Who break the crystal of a poet\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\n   That small and sickly eyes may glare and gloat.\r\n\r\n   Is it not said that many years ago,\r\n      In a far Eastern town, some soldiers ran\r\n      With torches through the midnight, and began\r\n   To wrangle for mean raiment, and to throw\r\n      Dice for the garments of a wretched man,\r\n   Not knowing the God\xe2\x80\x99s wonder, or His woe?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW REMORSE\r\n\r\n\r\n   THE sin was mine; I did not understand.\r\n      So now is music prisoned in her cave,\r\n      Save where some ebbing desultory wave\r\n   Frets with its restless whirls this meagre strand.\r\n   And in the withered hollow of this land\r\n      Hath Summer dug herself so deep a grave,\r\n      That hardly can the leaden willow crave\r\n   One silver blossom from keen Winter\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n   But who is this who cometh by the shore?\r\n   (Nay, love, look up and wonder!)  Who is this\r\n      Who cometh in dyed garments from the South?\r\n   It is thy new-found Lord, and he shall kiss\r\n      The yet unravished roses of thy mouth,\r\n   And I shall weep and worship, as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFANTAISIES D\xc3\x89CORATIVES\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nLE PANNEAU\r\n\r\n\r\n   UNDER the rose-tree\xe2\x80\x99s dancing shade\r\n      There stands a little ivory girl,\r\n      Pulling the leaves of pink and pearl\r\n   With pale green nails of polished jade.\r\n\r\n   The red leaves fall upon the mould,\r\n      The white leaves flutter, one by one,\r\n      Down to a blue bowl where the sun,\r\n   Like a great dragon, writhes in gold.\r\n\r\n   The white leaves float upon the air,\r\n      The red leaves flutter idly down,\r\n      Some fall upon her yellow gown,\r\n   And some upon her raven hair.\r\n\r\n   She takes an amber lute and sings,\r\n      And as she sings a silver crane\r\n      Begins his scarlet neck to strain,\r\n   And flap his burnished metal wings.\r\n\r\n   She takes a lute of amber bright,\r\n      And from the thicket where he lies\r\n      Her lover, with his almond eyes,\r\n   Watches her movements in delight.\r\n\r\n   And now she gives a cry of fear,\r\n      And tiny tears begin to start:\r\n      A thorn has wounded with its dart\r\n   The pink-veined sea-shell of her ear.\r\n\r\n   And now she laughs a merry note:\r\n      There has fallen a petal of the rose\r\n      Just where the yellow satin shows\r\n   The blue-veined flower of her throat.\r\n\r\n   With pale green nails of polished jade,\r\n      Pulling the leaves of pink and pearl,\r\n      There stands a little ivory girl\r\n   Under the rose-tree\xe2\x80\x99s dancing shade.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nLES BALLONS\r\n\r\n\r\n   AGAINST these turbid turquoise skies\r\n      The light and luminous balloons\r\n      Dip and drift like satin moons,\r\n   Drift like silken butterflies;\r\n\r\n   Reel with every windy gust,\r\n      Rise and reel like dancing girls,\r\n      Float like strange transparent pearls,\r\n   Fall and float like silver dust.\r\n\r\n   Now to the low leaves they cling,\r\n      Each with coy fantastic pose,\r\n      Each a petal of a rose\r\n   Straining at a gossamer string.\r\n\r\n   Then to the tall trees they climb,\r\n      Like thin globes of amethyst,\r\n      Wandering opals keeping tryst\r\n   With the rubies of the lime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANZONET\r\n\r\n\r\n      I HAVE no store\r\n   Of gryphon-guarded gold;\r\n      Now, as before,\r\n   Bare is the shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s fold.\r\n      Rubies nor pearls\r\n   Have I to gem thy throat;\r\n      Yet woodland girls\r\n   Have loved the shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s note.\r\n\r\n      Then pluck a reed\r\n   And bid me sing to thee,\r\n      For I would feed\r\n   Thine ears with melody,\r\n      Who art more fair\r\n   Than fairest fleur-de-lys,\r\n      More sweet and rare\r\n   Than sweetest ambergris.\r\n\r\n      What dost thou fear?\r\n   Young Hyacinth is slain,\r\n      Pan is not here,\r\n   And will not come again.\r\n      No horn\xc3\xa8d Faun\r\n   Treads down the yellow leas,\r\n      No God at dawn\r\n   Steals through the olive

Silver and still\r\n   Sinks the sad autumn day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPHONY IN YELLOW\r\n\r\n\r\n   AN omnibus across the bridge\r\n      Crawls like a yellow butterfly,\r\n      And, here and there, a passer-by\r\n   Shows like a little restless midge.\r\n\r\n   Big barges full of yellow hay\r\n      Are moored against the shadowy wharf,\r\n      And, like a yellow silken scarf,\r\n   The thick fog hangs along the quay.\r\n\r\n   The yellow leaves begin to fade\r\n      And flutter from the Temple elms,\r\n      And at my feet the pale green Thames\r\n   Lies like a rod of rippled jade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE FOREST\r\n\r\n\r\n   OUT of the mid-wood\xe2\x80\x99s twilight\r\n      Into the meadow\xe2\x80\x99s dawn,\r\n   Ivory limbed and brown-eyed,\r\n      Flashes my Faun!\r\n\r\n   He skips through the copses singing,\r\n      And his shadow dances along,\r\n   And I know not which I should follow,\r\n      Shadow or song!\r\n\r\n   O Hunter, snare me his shadow!\r\n      O Nightingale, catch me his strain!\r\n   Else moonstruck with music and madness\r\n      I track him in vain!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MY WIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n                         WITH A

to you seem fair,\r\n   Love will waft it till it settles\r\n      On your hair.\r\n\r\n   And when wind and winter harden\r\n      All the loveless land,\r\n   It will whisper of the garden,\r\n

                     (To L. L.)\r\n\r\n   COULD we dig up this long-buried treasure,\r\n      Were it worth the pleasure,\r\n   We never could learn love\xe2\x80\x99s song,\r\n      We are parted too long.\r\n\r\n   Could the passionate past that is fled\r\n      Call back its dead,\r\n   Could we live it all over again,\r\n      Were it worth the pain!\r\n\r\n   I remember we used to meet\r\n      By an ivied seat,\r\n   And you warbled each pretty word\r\n      With the air of a bird;\r\n\r\n   And your voice had a quaver in it,\r\n      Just like a linnet,\r\n   And shook, as the blackbird\xe2\x80\x99s throat\r\n      With its last big note;\r\n\r\n   And your eyes, they were green and grey\r\n      Like an April day,\r\n   But lit into amethyst\r\n      When I stooped and kissed;\r\n\r\n   And your mouth, it would never smile\r\n      For a long, long while,\r\n   Then it rippled all over with laughter\r\n      Five minutes after.\r\n\r\n   You were always afraid of a shower,\r\n      Just like a flower:\r\n   I remember you started and ran\r\n      When the rain began.\r\n\r\n   I remember I never could catch you,\r\n      For no one could match you,\r\n   You had wonderful, luminous, fleet,\r\n      Little wings to your feet.\r\n\r\n   I remember your hair\xe2\x80\x94did I tie it?\r\n      For it always ran riot\xe2\x80\x94\r\n   Like a tangled sunbeam of gold:\r\n      These things are old.\r\n\r\n   I remember so well the room,\r\n      And the lilac bloom\r\n   That beat at the dripping pane\r\n      In the warm June rain;\r\n\r\n   And the colour of your gown,\r\n      It was amber-brown,\r\n   And two yellow satin bows\r\n      From your shoulders rose.\r\n\r\n   And the handkerchief of French lace\r\n      Which you held to your face\xe2\x80\x94\r\n   Had a small tear left a stain?\r\n      Or was it the rain?\r\n\r\n   On your hand as it waved adieu\r\n      There were veins of blue;\r\n   In your voice as it said good-bye\r\n      Was a petulant cry,\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98You have only wasted your life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n      (Ah, that was the knife!)\r\n   When I rushed through the garden gate\r\n      It was all too late.\r\n\r\n   Could we live it over again,\r\n      Were it worth the pain,\r\n   Could the passionate past that is fled\r\n      Call back its dead!\r\n\r\n   Well, if my heart must break,\r\n      Dear love, for your sake,\r\n   It will break in music, I know,\r\n      Poets\xe2\x80\x99 hearts break so.\r\n\r\n   But strange that I was not told\r\n      That the brain can hold\r\n   In a tiny ivory cell\r\n      God\xe2\x80\x99s

when crouching by the marge\r\n   You heard from Adrian\xe2\x80\x99s gilded barge the laughter of Antinous\r\n\r\n   And lapped the stream and fed your drouth and watched with hot and\r\n   hungry stare\r\n   The ivory body of that rare young slave with his pomegranate mouth!\r\n\r\n   Sing to me of the Labyrinth in which the twi-formed bull was stalled!\r\n   Sing to me of the night you

Mandragores,\r\n\r\n   And the great torpid crocodile within the tank shed slimy tears,\r\n   And tare the jewels from his ears and staggered back into the Nile,\r\n\r\n   And the priests cursed you with shrill psalms as in your claws you\r\n   seized their snake\r\n   And crept away with it to slake your passion by the shuddering palms.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n

scarlet coat,\r\n      For blood and wine are red,\r\n   And blood and wine were on his hands\r\n      When they found him with the dead,\r\n   The poor dead woman whom he loved,\r\n      And murdered in her bed.\r\n\r\n   He walked amongst the Trial Men\r\n      In a suit of shabby grey;\r\n   A cricket cap was on his head,\r\n      And his step seemed light and gay;\r\n   But I never saw a man who looked\r\n      So wistfully at the day.\r\n\r\n   I never saw a man who looked\r\n      With such a wistful eye\r\n   Upon that little tent of blue\r\n      Which prisoners call the sky,\r\n   And at every drifting cloud that went\r\n      With sails of silver by.\r\n\r\n   I walked, with other souls in pain,\r\n      Within another ring,\r\n   And was wondering if the man had done\r\n      A great or little thing,\r\n   When a voice behind me whispered low,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98_That fellow\xe2\x80\x99s got to swing_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n   Dear Christ! the very prison walls\r\n      Suddenly seemed to reel,\r\n   And the sky above my head became\r\n      Like a casque of scorching steel;\r\n   And, though I was a soul in pain,\r\n      My pain I could not feel.\r\n\r\n   I only knew what hunted thought\r\n      Quickened his step, and why\r\n   He looked upon the garish day\r\n      With such a wistful eye;\r\n   The man had killed the thing he loved,\r\n      And so he had to die.\r\n\r\n                      [Picture: Decorative graphic]\r\n\r\n   Yet each man kills the thing he loves,\r\n      By each let this be heard,\r\n   Some do it with a bitter look,\r\n      Some with a flattering word,\r\n   The coward does it with a kiss,\r\n      The brave man with a sword!\r\n\r\n   Some kill their love when they are young,\r\n      And some when they are old;\r\n   Some strangle with the hands of Lust,\r\n      Some with the hands of Gold:\r\n   The kindest use a knife, because\r\n      The dead so soon grow cold.\r\n\r\n   Some love too little, some too long,\r\n      Some sell, and others buy;\r\n   Some do the deed with many tears,\r\n      And some without a sigh:\r\n   For each man kills the thing he loves,\r\n      Yet each man does not die.\r\n\r\n   He does not die a death of shame\r\n      On a day of dark disgrace,\r\n   Nor have a noose about his neck,\r\n      Nor a cloth upon his face,\r\n   Nor drop feet foremost through the floor\r\n      Into an empty space.\r\n\r\n                      [Picture: Decorative graphic]\r\n\r\n   He does not sit with silent men\r\n      Who watch him night and day;\r\n   Who watch him when he tries to weep,\r\n      And when he tries to pray;\r\n   Who watch him lest himself should rob\r\n      The prison of its prey.\r\n\r\n   He does not wake at dawn to see\r\n      Dread figures throng his room,\r\n   The shivering Chaplain robed in white,\r\n      The Sheriff stern with gloom,\r\n   And the Governor all in shiny black,\r\n      With the yellow face of Doom.\r\n\r\n   He does not rise in piteous haste\r\n      To put on convict-clothes,\r\n   While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes\r\n      Each new and nerve-twitched pose,\r\n   Fingering a watch whose little ticks\r\n      Are like horrible hammer-blows.\r\n\r\n   He does not know that sickening thirst\r\n      That sands one\xe2\x80\x99s throat, before\r\n   The hangman with his gardener\xe2\x80\x99s gloves\r\n      Slips through the padded door,\r\n   And binds one with three leathern thongs,\r\n      That the throat may thirst no more.\r\n\r\n   He does not bend his head to hear\r\n      The Burial Office read,\r\n   Nor, while the terror of his soul\r\n      Tells him he is not dead,\r\n   Cross his own coffin, as he moves\r\n      Into the hideous shed.\r\n\r\n   He does not stare upon the air\r\n      Through a little roof of glass:\r\n   He does not pray with lips of clay\r\n      For his agony to pass;\r\n   Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek\r\n      The kiss of Caiaphas.\r\n\r\n                                     II\r\n\r\n   SIX weeks our guardsman walked the yard,\r\n      In the suit of shabby grey:\r\n   His cricket cap was on his head,\r\n      And his step seemed light and gay,\r\n   But I never saw a man who looked\r\n      So wistfully at the day.\r\n\r\n   I never saw a man who looked\r\n      With such a wistful eye\r\n   Upon that little tent of blue\r\n      Which prisoners call the sky,\r\n   And at every wandering cloud that trailed\r\n      Its ravelled fleeces by.\r\n\r\n   He did not wring his hands, as do\r\n      Those witless men who dare\r\n   To try to rear the changeling Hope\r\n      In the cave of black Despair:\r\n   He only looked upon the sun,\r\n      And drank the morning air.\r\n\r\n   He did not wring his hands nor weep,\r\n      Nor did he peek or pine,\r\n   But he drank the air as though it held\r\n      Some healthful anodyne;\r\n   With open mouth he drank the sun\r\n      As though it had been wine!\r\n\r\n   And I and all the souls in pain,\r\n      Who tramped the other ring,\r\n   Forgot if we ourselves had done\r\n      A great or little thing,\r\n   And watched with gaze of dull amaze\r\n      The man who had to swing.\r\n\r\n   And strange it was to see him pass\r\n      With a step so light and gay,\r\n   And strange it was to see him look\r\n      So wistfully at the day,\r\n   And strange it was to think that he\r\n      Had such a debt to pay.\r\n\r\n                      [Picture: Decorative graphic]\r\n\r\n   For oak and elm have pleasant leaves\r\n      That in the springtime shoot:\r\n   But grim to see is the gallows-tree,\r\n      With its adder-bitten root,\r\n   And, green or dry, a man must die\r\n      Before it bears its fruit!\r\n\r\n   The loftiest place is that seat of grace\r\n      For which all worldlings try:\r\n   But who would stand in hempen band\r\n      Upon a scaffold high,\r\n   And through a murderer\xe2\x80\x99s collar take\r\n      His last look at the sky?\r\n\r\n   It is sweet to dance to violins\r\n      When Love and Life are fair:\r\n   To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes\r\n      Is delicate and rare:\r\n   But it is not sweet with nimble feet\r\n      To dance upon the air!\r\n\r\n   So with curious eyes and sick surmise\r\n      We watched him day by day,\r\n   And wondered if each one of us\r\n      Would end the self-same way,\r\n   For none can tell to what red Hell\r\n      His sightless soul may stray.\r\n\r\n   At last the dead man walked no more\r\n      Amongst the Trial Men,\r\n   And I knew that he was standing up\r\n      In the black dock\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful pen,\r\n   And that never would I see his face\r\n      In God\xe2\x80\x99s sweet world again.\r\n\r\n   Like two doomed ships that pass in storm\r\n      We had crossed each other\xe2\x80\x99s way:\r\n   But we made no sign, we said no word,\r\n      We had no word to say;\r\n   For we did not meet in the holy night,\r\n      But in the shameful day.\r\n\r\n   A prison wall was round us both,\r\n      Two outcast men we were:\r\n   The world had thrust us from its heart,\r\n      And God from out His care:\r\n   And the iron gin that waits for Sin\r\n      Had caught us in its snare.\r\n\r\n                                     III\r\n\r\n   IN Debtors\xe2\x80\x99 Yard the stones are hard,\r\n      And the dripping wall is high,\r\n   So it was there he took the air\r\n      Beneath the leaden sky,\r\n   And by each side a Warder walked,\r\n      For fear the man might die.\r\n\r\n   Or else he sat with those who watched\r\n      His anguish night and day;\r\n   Who watched him when he rose to weep,\r\n      And when he crouched to pray;\r\n   Who watched him lest himself should rob\r\n      Their scaffold of its prey.\r\n\r\n   The Governor was strong upon\r\n      The Regulations Act:\r\n   The Doctor said that Death was but\r\n      A scientific fact:\r\n   And twice a day the Chaplain called,\r\n      And left a little tract.\r\n\r\n   And twice a day he smoked his pipe,\r\n      And drank his quart of beer:\r\n   His soul was resolute, and held\r\n      No hiding-place for

Devil\xe2\x80\x99s Own Brigade:\r\n   And shaven head and feet of lead\r\n      Make a merry masquerade.\r\n\r\n   We tore the tarry rope to shreds\r\n      With blunt and bleeding nails;\r\n   We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,\r\n      And cleaned the shining rails:\r\n   And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,\r\n      And clattered with the pails.\r\n\r\n   We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,\r\n      We turned the dusty drill:\r\n   We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,\r\n      And sweated on the mill:\r\n   But in the heart of every man\r\n      Terror was lying still.\r\n\r\n   So still it lay that every day\r\n      Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:\r\n   And we forgot the bitter lot\r\n      That waits for fool and knave,\r\n   Till once, as we tramped in from work,\r\n      We passed an open grave.\r\n\r\n   With yawning mouth the yellow hole\r\n      Gaped for a living thing;\r\n   The very mud cried out for blood\r\n      To the thirsty asphalte ring:\r\n   And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair\r\n      Some prisoner had to swing.\r\n\r\n   Right in we went, with soul intent\r\n      On Death and Dread and Doom:\r\n   The hangman, with his little bag,\r\n      Went shuffling through the gloom:\r\n   And each man trembled as he crept\r\n      Into his numbered tomb.\r\n\r\n                      [Picture: Decorative graphic]\r\n\r\n

White faces seemed to peer.\r\n\r\n   He lay as one who lies and dreams\r\n      In a pleasant meadow-land,\r\n   The watchers watched him as he slept,\r\n      And could not understand\r\n   How one could sleep so sweet a sleep\r\n      With a hangman close at hand.\r\n\r\n   But there is no sleep when men must weep\r\n      Who never yet have wept:\r\n   So we\xe2\x80\x94the fool, the fraud, the

another\xe2\x80\x99s guilt!\r\n   For, right within, the sword of Sin\r\n      Pierced to its poisoned hilt,\r\n   And as molten lead were the tears we shed\r\n      For the blood we had not spilt.\r\n\r\n   The Warders with their shoes of felt\r\n      Crept by each padlocked door,\r\n   And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,\r\n      Grey figures on the floor,\r\n   And wondered why men knelt to pray\r\n      Who never prayed before.\r\n\r\n   All through the night we knelt and prayed,\r\n      Mad mourners of a corse!\r\n   The troubled plumes of midnight were\r\n      The plumes upon a hearse:\r\n   And bitter wine upon a sponge\r\n      Was the savour of Remorse.\r\n\r\n                                  * * * * *\r\n\r\n   The grey cock crew, the red cock crew,\r\n      But

glided past, they glided fast,\r\n      Like travellers through a mist:\r\n   They mocked the moon in a rigadoon\r\n      Of delicate turn and twist,\r\n   And with formal pace and loathsome grace\r\n      The phantoms kept their tryst.\r\n\r\n   With mop and mow, we saw them go,\r\n      Slim shadows hand in hand:\r\n   About, about, in ghostly rout\r\n      They trod a saraband:\r\n   And the damned grotesques made arabesques,\r\n      Like the wind upon the sand!\r\n\r\n   With the pirouettes of marionettes,\r\n      They tripped on pointed tread:\r\n   But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,\r\n      As their grisly masque they led,\r\n   And loud they sang, and long they sang,\r\n      For they sang to wake the dead.\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98_Oho_!\xe2\x80\x99 _they cried_,

And whose feet might not go free,\r\n   Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,\r\n      Most terrible to see.\r\n\r\n   Around, around, they waltzed and wound;\r\n      Some wheeled in smirking pairs;\r\n   With the mincing step of a demirep\r\n      Some sidled up the stairs:\r\n   And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,\r\n      Each helped us at our prayers.\r\n\r\n   The morning wind began to moan,\r\n      But still the night went on:\r\n   Through its giant loom the web of gloom\r\n      Crept till each thread was spun:\r\n   And, as we prayed, we grew afraid\r\n      Of the Justice of the Sun.\r\n\r\n   The moaning wind went wandering round\r\n      The weeping prison-wall:\r\n   Till like a wheel of turning steel\r\n      We felt the minutes crawl:\r\n   O moaning wind! what had we done\r\n      To have such a seneschal?\r\n\r\n   At last I saw the shadowed bars,\r\n      Like a lattice wrought in lead,\r\n   Move right across the whitewashed wall\r\n      That faced my three-plank bed,\r\n   And I knew that somewhere in the world\r\n      God\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful dawn was red.\r\n\r\n   At six o\xe2\x80\x99clock we cleaned our cells,\r\n      At seven all was still,\r\n   But the sough and swing of a mighty wing\r\n      The prison seemed to fill,\r\n   For the Lord of Death with icy breath\r\n      Had entered in to kill.\r\n\r\n   He did not pass in purple pomp,\r\n      Nor ride a moon-white steed.\r\n   Three yards of cord and a sliding board\r\n      Are all the gallows\xe2\x80\x99 need:\r\n   So with rope of shame the Herald came\r\n      To do the secret deed.\r\n\r\n   We were as men who through a fen\r\n      Of filthy darkness grope:\r\n   We did not dare to breathe a prayer,\r\n      Or to give our anguish scope:\r\n   Something was dead in each of us,\r\n      And what was dead was Hope.\r\n\r\n   For Man\xe2\x80\x99s grim Justice goes its way,\r\n      And will not swerve aside:\r\n   It slays the weak, it slays the strong,\r\n      It has a deadly stride:\r\n   With iron heel it slays the strong,\r\n      The monstrous parricide!\r\n\r\n   We waited for the stroke of eight:\r\n      Each tongue was thick with thirst:\r\n   For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate\r\n      That makes a man accursed,\r\n   And Fate will use a running noose\r\n      For the best man and the worst.\r\n\r\n   We had no other thing to do,\r\n      Save to wait for the sign to come:\r\n   So, like things of stone in a valley lone,\r\n      Quiet we sat and dumb:\r\n   But each man\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat thick and quick,\r\n      Like a madman on a drum!\r\n\r\n   With sudden shock the prison-clock\r\n      Smote on the shivering air,\r\n   And from all the gaol rose up a wail\r\n      Of impotent despair,\r\n   Like the sound that frightened marshes hear\r\n      From some leper in his lair.\r\n\r\n   And as one sees most fearful things\r\n      In the crystal of a dream,\r\n   We saw the greasy hempen rope\r\n      Hooked to the blackened beam,\r\n   And heard the prayer the hangman\xe2\x80\x99s snare\r\n      Strangled into a scream.\r\n\r\n   And all the woe that moved him so\r\n      That he gave that bitter cry,\r\n   And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,\r\n      None knew so well as I:\r\n   For he who lives more lives than one\r\n      More deaths than one must die.\r\n\r\n                                     IV\r\n\r\n   THERE is no chapel on the day\r\n      On which they hang a man:\r\n   The Chaplain\xe2\x80\x99s heart is far too sick,\r\n      Or his face is far too wan,\r\n   Or there is that written in his eyes\r\n      Which none should look upon.\r\n\r\n   So they kept us close till nigh on noon,\r\n      And then they rang the bell,\r\n   And the Warders with their jingling keys\r\n      Opened each listening cell,\r\n   And down the iron stair we tramped,\r\n      Each from his separate Hell.\r\n\r\n   Out into God\xe2\x80\x99s sweet air we went,\r\n      But not in wonted way,\r\n   For this man\xe2\x80\x99s face was white with fear,\r\n      And that man\xe2\x80\x99s face was grey,\r\n   And I never saw sad men who looked\r\n      So wistfully at the day.\r\n\r\n   I never saw sad men who looked\r\n      With such a wistful eye\r\n   Upon that little tent of blue\r\n      We prisoners called the sky,\r\n   And at every careless cloud that passed\r\n      In happy freedom by.\r\n\r\n   But there were those amongst us all\r\n      Who walked with downcast head,\r\n   And knew that, had each got his due,\r\n      They should have died instead:\r\n   He had but killed a thing that lived,\r\n      Whilst they had killed the dead.\r\n\r\n   For he who sins a second time\r\n      Wakes a dead soul to pain,\r\n   And draws it from its spotted shroud,\r\n      And makes it bleed again,\r\n   And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,\r\n      And makes it bleed in vain!\r\n\r\n                      [Picture: Decorative

and round,\r\n      And no man spoke a word.\r\n\r\n   Silently we went round and round,\r\n      And through each hollow mind\r\n   The Memory of dreadful things\r\n      Rushed like a dreadful wind,\r\n   And Horror stalked before each man,\r\n      And Terror crept behind.\r\n\r\n                      [Picture: Decorative graphic]\r\n\r\n   The Warders strutted up and down,\r\n      And kept their herd of brutes,\r\n   Their uniforms were spick and span,\r\n      And they wore their Sunday suits,\r\n   But we knew the work they had been at,\r\n      By the quicklime on their boots.\r\n\r\n   For where a grave had opened wide,\r\n      There was no grave at all:\r\n   Only a stretch of mud and sand\r\n      By the hideous prison-wall,\r\n   And a little heap of burning lime,\r\n      That the man should have his pall.\r\n\r\n   For he has a pall, this wretched man,\r\n      Such as few men can claim:\r\n   Deep down below a prison-yard,\r\n      Naked for greater shame,\r\n   He lies, with fetters on each foot,\r\n      Wrapt in a sheet of flame!\r\n\r\n   And all the while the burning lime\r\n      Eats flesh and bone away,\r\n   It eats the brittle bone by night,\r\n      And the soft flesh by day,\r\n   It eats the flesh and bone by turns,\r\n      But it eats the heart alway.\r\n\r\n                      [Picture: Decorative graphic]\r\n\r\n   For

   Out of his heart a white!\r\n   For who can say by what strange way,\r\n      Christ brings His will to light,\r\n   Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore\r\n      Bloomed in the great

air,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n   And yet, methinks this northern Spring is fair,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n   These fields made golden with the flower of March,\r\n   The throstle singing on the feathered larch,\r\n   The cawing rooks, the wood-doves fluttering by,\r\n   The little clouds that race across the sky;\r\n   And fair the violet\xe2\x80\x99s gentle drooping head,\r\n   The primrose, pale for love uncomforted,\r\n   The rose that burgeons on the climbing briar,\r\n   The crocus-bed, (that seems a moon of fire\r\n   Round-girdled with a purple marriage-ring);\r\n   And all the flowers of our English Spring,\r\n   Fond snowdrops, and the bright-starred daffodil.\r\n   Up starts the lark beside the murmuring mill,\r\n   And breaks the gossamer-threads of early dew;\r\n   And down the river, like a flame of blue,\r\n   Keen as an arrow flies the water-king,\r\n   While the brown linnets in the greenwood sing.\r\n   A year ago!\xe2\x80\x94it seems a little time\r\n   Since last I saw that lordly southern clime,\r\n   Where flower and fruit to purple radiance blow,\r\n   And like bright lamps the fabled apples glow.\r\n   Full Spring it was\xe2\x80\x94and by rich flowering vines,\r\n   Dark olive-groves and noble forest-pines,\r\n   I rode at will; the moist glad air was sweet,\r\n   The white road rang beneath my horse\xe2\x80\x99s feet,\r\n   And musing on Ravenna\xe2\x80\x99s ancient name,\r\n   I watched the day till, marked with wounds of flame,\r\n   The turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned.\r\n\r\n      O how my heart with boyish passion burned,\r\n   When far away across the sedge and mere\r\n   I saw that Holy City rising clear,\r\n   Crowned with her crown of towers!\xe2\x80\x94On and on\r\n   I galloped, racing with the setting sun,\r\n   And ere the crimson after-glow was passed,\r\n   I stood within Ravenna\xe2\x80\x99s walls at last!\r\n\r\n                                     II.\r\n\r\n      How strangely still! no sound of life or joy\r\n   Startles the air; no laughing shepherd-boy\r\n   Pipes on his reed, nor ever through the day\r\n   Comes the glad sound of children at their play:\r\n   O sad, and sweet, and silent! surely here\r\n   A man might dwell apart from troublous fear,\r\n   Watching the tide of seasons as they flow\r\n   From amorous Spring to Winter\xe2\x80\x99s rain and snow,\r\n   And have no thought of sorrow;\xe2\x80\x94here, indeed,\r\n   Are Lethe\xe2\x80\x99s waters, and that fatal weed\r\n   Which makes a man forget his fatherland.\r\n\r\n      Ay! amid lotus-meadows dost thou stand,\r\n   Like Proserpine, with poppy-laden head,\r\n   Guarding the holy ashes of the dead.\r\n   For though thy brood of warrior sons hath ceased,\r\n   Thy noble dead are with thee!\xe2\x80\x94they at least\r\n   Are faithful to thine honour:\xe2\x80\x94guard them well,\r\n   O childless city! for a mighty spell,\r\n   To wake men\xe2\x80\x99s hearts to dreams of things sublime,\r\n   Are the lone tombs where rest the Great of Time.\r\n\r\n                                    III.\r\n\r\n      Yon lonely pillar, rising on the plain,\r\n   Marks where the bravest knight of France was slain,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n   The Prince of chivalry, the Lord of war,\r\n   Gaston de Foix: for some untimely star\r\n   Led him against thy city, and he fell,\r\n   As falls some forest-lion fighting well.\r\n   Taken from life while life and love were new,\r\n   He lies beneath God\xe2\x80\x99s seamless veil of blue;\r\n   Tall lance-like reeds wave sadly o\xe2\x80\x99er his head,\r\n   And oleanders bloom to deeper red,\r\n   Where his bright youth flowed crimson on the ground.\r\n\r\n      Look farther north unto that broken mound,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n   There, prisoned now within a lordly tomb\r\n   Raised by a daughter\xe2\x80\x99s hand, in lonely gloom,\r\n   Huge-limbed Theodoric, the Gothic king,\r\n   Sleeps after all his weary conquering.\r\n   Time hath not spared his ruin,\xe2\x80\x94wind and rain\r\n   Have broken down his stronghold; and again\r\n   We see that Death is mighty lord of all,\r\n   And king and clown to ashen dust must fall\r\n\r\n      Mighty indeed _their_ glory! yet to me\r\n   Barbaric king, or knight of chivalry,\r\n   Or the great queen herself, were poor and vain,\r\n   Beside the grave where Dante rests from pain.\r\n   His gilded shrine lies open to the air;\r\n   And cunning sculptor\xe2\x80\x99s hands have carven there\r\n   The calm white brow, as calm as earliest morn,\r\n   The eyes that flashed with passionate love and scorn,\r\n   The lips that sang of Heaven and of Hell,\r\n   The almond-face which Giotto drew so well,\r\n   The weary face of Dante;\xe2\x80\x94to this day,\r\n   Here in his place of resting, far away\r\n   From Arno\xe2\x80\x99s yellow waters, rushing down\r\n   Through the wide bridges of that fairy town,\r\n   Where the tall tower of Giotto seems to rise\r\n   A marble lily under sapphire skies!\r\n\r\n   Alas! my Dante! thou hast known the pain\r\n   Of meaner lives,\xe2\x80\x94the exile\xe2\x80\x99s galling chain,\r\n   How steep the stairs within kings\xe2\x80\x99 houses are,\r\n   And all the petty miseries which mar\r\n   Man\xe2\x80\x99s nobler nature with the sense of wrong.\r\n   Yet this dull world is grateful for thy song;\r\n   Our nations do thee homage,\xe2\x80\x94even she,\r\n   That cruel queen of vine-clad Tuscany,\r\n   Who bound with crown of thorns thy living brow,\r\n   Hath decked thine empty tomb with laurels now,\r\n   And begs in vain the ashes of her son.\r\n\r\n      O mightiest exile! all thy grief is done:\r\n   Thy soul walks now beside thy Beatrice;\r\n   Ravenna guards thine ashes: sleep in peace.\r\n\r\n                                     IV.\r\n\r\n      How lone this palace is; how grey the walls!\r\n   No minstrel now wakes echoes in these halls.\r\n   The broken chain lies rusting on the door,\r\n   And noisome weeds have split the marble floor:\r\n   Here lurks the snake, and here the lizards run\r\n   By the stone lions blinking in the sun.\r\n   Byron dwelt here in love and revelry\r\n   For two long years\xe2\x80\x94a second Anthony,\r\n   Who of the world another Actium made!\r\n   Yet suffered not his royal soul to fade,\r\n   Or lyre to break, or lance to grow less keen,\r\n   \xe2\x80\x99Neath any wiles of an Egyptian queen.\r\n   For from the East there came a mighty cry,\r\n   And Greece stood up to fight for Liberty,\r\n   And called him from Ravenna: never knight\r\n   Rode forth more nobly to wild scenes of fight!\r\n   None fell more bravely on ensanguined field,\r\n   Borne like a Spartan back upon his shield!\r\n   O Hellas!  Hellas! in thine hour of pride,\r\n   Thy day of might, remember him who died\r\n   To wrest from off thy limbs the trammelling chain:\r\n   O Salamis!  O lone Plat\xc3\xa6an plain!\r\n   O tossing waves of wild Euboean sea!\r\n   O wind-swept heights of lone Thermopyl\xc3\xa6!\r\n   He loved you well\xe2\x80\x94ay, not alone in word,\r\n   Who freely gave to thee his lyre and sword,\r\n   Like \xc3\x86schylos at well-fought Marathon:\r\n\r\n      And England, too, shall glory in her son,\r\n   Her warrior-poet, first in song and fight.\r\n   No longer now shall Slander\xe2\x80\x99s venomed spite\r\n   Crawl like a snake across his perfect name,\r\n   Or mar the lordly scutcheon of his fame.\r\n\r\n      For as the olive-garland of the race,\r\n   Which lights with joy each eager runner\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\n   As the red cross which saveth men in war,\r\n   As a flame-bearded beacon seen from far\r\n   By mariners upon a storm-tossed sea,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n   Such was his love for Greece and Liberty!\r\n\r\n      Byron, thy crowns are ever fresh and green:\r\n   Red leaves of rose from Sapphic Mitylene\r\n   Shall bind thy brows; the myrtle blooms for thee,\r\n   In hidden glades by lonely Castaly;\r\n   The laurels wait thy coming: all are thine,\r\n   And round thy head one perfect wreath will twine.\r\n\r\n                                     V.\r\n\r\n      The pine-tops rocked before the evening breeze\r\n   With the hoarse murmur of the wintry seas,\r\n   And the tall stems were streaked with amber bright;\xe2\x80\x94\r\n   I wandered through the wood in wild delight,\r\n   Some startled bird, with fluttering wings and fleet,\r\n   Made snow of all the blossoms; at my feet,\r\n   Like silver crowns, the pale narcissi lay,\r\n   And small birds sang on every twining spray.\r\n   O waving trees, O forest liberty!\r\n   Within your haunts at least a man is free,\r\n   And half forgets the weary world of strife:\r\n   The blood flows hotter, and a sense of life\r\n   Wakes i\xe2\x80\x99 the quickening veins, while once again\r\n   The woods are filled with gods we fancied slain.\r\n   Long time I watched, and surely hoped to see\r\n   Some goat-foot Pan make merry minstrelsy\r\n   Amid the reeds! some startled Dryad-maid\r\n   In girlish flight! or lurking in the glade,\r\n   The soft brown limbs, the wanton treacherous face\r\n   Of woodland god! Queen Dian in the chase,\r\n   White-limbed and terrible, with look of pride,\r\n   And leash of boar-hounds leaping at her side!\r\n   Or Hylas mirrored in the perfect stream.\r\n\r\n      O idle heart!  O fond Hellenic dream!\r\n   Ere long, with melancholy rise and swell,\r\n   The evening chimes, the convent\xe2\x80\x99s vesper bell,\r\n   Struck on mine ears amid the amorous flowers.\r\n   Alas! alas! these sweet and honied hours\r\n   Had whelmed my heart like some encroaching sea,\r\n   And drowned all thoughts of black Gethsemane.\r\n\r\n                                     VI.\r\n\r\n      O lone Ravenna! many a tale is told\r\n   Of thy great glories in the days of old:\r\n   Two thousand years have passed since thou didst see\r\n   C\xc3\xa6sar ride forth to royal victory.\r\n   Mighty thy name when Rome\xe2\x80\x99s lean eagles flew\r\n   From Britain\xe2\x80\x99s isles to far Euphrates blue;\r\n   And of the peoples thou wast noble queen,\r\n   Till in thy streets the Goth and Hun were seen.\r\n   Discrowned by man, deserted by the sea,\r\n   Thou sleepest, rocked in lonely misery!\r\n   No longer now upon thy swelling tide,\r\n   Pine-forest-like, thy myriad galleys ride!\r\n   For where the brass-beaked ships were wont to float,\r\n   The weary shepherd pipes his mournful note;\r\n   And the white sheep are free to come and go\r\n   Where Adria\xe2\x80\x99s purple waters used to flow.\r\n\r\n      O fair!  O sad!  O Queen uncomforted!\r\n   In ruined loveliness thou liest dead,\r\n   Alone of all thy sisters; for at last\r\n   Italia\xe2\x80\x99s royal warrior hath passed\r\n   Rome\xe2\x80\x99s lordliest entrance, and hath worn his crown\r\n   In the high temples of the Eternal Town!\r\n   The Palatine hath welcomed back her king,\r\n   And with his name the seven mountains ring!\r\n\r\n      And Naples hath outlived her dream of pain,\r\n   And mocks her tyrant!  Venice lives again,\r\n   New risen from the waters! and the cry\r\n   Of Light and Truth, of Love and Liberty,\r\n   Is heard in lordly Genoa, and where\r\n   The marble spires of Milan wound the air,\r\n   Rings from the Alps to the Sicilian shore,\r\n   And Dante\xe2\x80\x99s dream is now a dream no more.\r\n\r\n      But thou, Ravenna, better loved than all,\r\n   Thy ruined palaces are but a pall\r\n   That hides thy fallen greatness! and thy name\r\n   Burns like a grey and flickering candle-flame\r\n   Beneath the noonday splendour of the sun\r\n   Of new Italia! for the night is done,\r\n   The night of dark oppression, and the day\r\n   Hath dawned in passionate splendour: far away\r\n   The Austrian hounds are hunted from the land,\r\n   Beyond those ice-crowned citadels which stand\r\n   Girdling the plain of royal Lombardy,\r\n   From the far West unto the Eastern sea.\r\n\r\n      I know, indeed, that sons of thine have died\r\n   In Lissa\xe2\x80\x99s waters, by the mountain-side\r\n   Of Aspromonte, on Novara\xe2\x80\x99s plain,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n   Nor have thy children died for thee in vain:\r\n   And yet, methinks, thou hast not drunk this wine\r\n   From grapes new-crushed of Liberty divine,\r\n   Thou hast not followed that immortal Star\r\n   Which leads the people forth to deeds of war.\r\n   Weary of life, thou liest in silent sleep,\r\n   As one who marks the lengthening shadows creep,\r\n   Careless of all the hurrying hours that run,\r\n   Mourning some day of glory, for the sun\r\n   Of Freedom hath not shewn to thee his face,\r\n   And thou hast caught no flambeau in the race.\r\n\r\n      Yet wake not from thy slumbers,\xe2\x80\x94rest thee well,\r\n   Amidst thy fields of amber asphodel,\r\n   Thy lily-sprinkled meadows,\xe2\x80\x94rest thee there,\r\n   To mock all human greatness: who would dare\r\n   To vent the paltry sorrows of his life\r\n   Before thy ruins, or to praise the strife\r\n   Of kings\xe2\x80\x99 ambition, and the barren pride\r\n   Of warring nations! wert not thou the Bride\r\n   Of the wild Lord of Adria\xe2\x80\x99s stormy sea!\r\n   The Queen of double Empires! and to thee\r\n   Were not the nations given as thy prey!\r\n   And now\xe2\x80\x94thy gates lie open night and day,\r\n   The grass grows green on every tower and hall,\r\n   The ghastly fig hath cleft thy bastioned wall;\r\n   And where thy mail\xc3\xa8d warriors stood at rest\r\n   The midnight owl hath made her secret nest.\r\n   O fallen! fallen! from thy high estate,\r\n   O city trammelled in the toils of Fate,\r\n   Doth nought remain of all thy glorious days,\r\n   But a dull shield, a crown of withered bays!\r\n\r\n      Yet who beneath this night of wars and fears,\r\n   From tranquil tower can watch the coming years;\r\n   Who can foretell what joys the day shall bring,\r\n   Or why before the dawn the linnets sing?\r\n   Thou, even thou, mayst wake, as wakes the rose\r\n   To crimson splendour from its grave of snows;\r\n   As the rich corn-fields rise to red and gold\r\n   From these brown lands, now stiff with Winter\xe2\x80\x99s cold;\r\n   As from the storm-rack comes a perfect star!\r\n\r\n      O much-loved city!  I have wandered far\r\n   From the wave-circled islands of my home;\r\n   Have seen the gloomy mystery of the Dome\r\n   Rise slowly from the drear Campagna\xe2\x80\x99s way,\r\n   Clothed in the royal purple of the day:\r\n   I from the city of the violet crown\r\n   Have watched the sun by Corinth\xe2\x80\x99s hill go down,\r\n   And marked the \xe2\x80\x98myriad laughter\xe2\x80\x99 of the sea\r\n   From starlit hills of flower-starred Arcady;\r\n   Yet back to thee returns my perfect love,\r\n   As to its forest-nest the evening dove.\r\n\r\n      O poet\xe2\x80\x99s city! one who scarce has seen\r\n   Some twenty summers cast their doublets green\r\n   For Autumn\xe2\x80\x99s livery, would seek in vain\r\n   To wake his lyre to sing a louder strain,\r\n   Or tell thy days of glory;\xe2\x80\x94poor indeed\r\n   Is the low murmur of the shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s reed,\r\n   Where the loud clarion\xe2\x80\x99s blast should shake the sky,\r\n   And flame across the heavens! and to try\r\n   Such lofty themes were folly: yet I know\r\n   That never felt my heart a nobler glow\r\n   Than when I woke the silence of thy street\r\n   With clamorous trampling of my horse\xe2\x80\x99s feet,\r\n   And saw the city which now I try to sing,\r\n   After long days of weary travelling.\r\n\r\n                                    VII.\r\n\r\n      Adieu, Ravenna! but a year ago,\r\n   I stood and watched the crimson sunset glow\r\n   From the lone chapel on thy marshy plain:\r\n   The sky was as a shield that caught the stain\r\n   Of blood and battle from the dying sun,\r\n   And in the west the circling clouds had spun\r\n   A royal robe, which some great God might wear,\r\n   While into ocean-seas of purple air\r\n   Sank the gold galley of the Lord of Light.\r\n\r\n      Yet here the gentle stillness of the night\r\n   Brings back the swelling tide of memory,\r\n   And wakes again my passionate love for thee:\r\n   Now is the Spring of Love, yet soon will come\r\n   On meadow and tree the Summer\xe2\x80\x99s lordly bloom;\r\n   And soon the grass with brighter flowers will blow,\r\n   And send up lilies for some boy to mow.\r\n   Then before long the Summer\xe2\x80\x99s conqueror,\r\n   Rich Autumn-time, the season\xe2\x80\x99s usurer,\r\n   Will lend his hoarded gold to all the trees,\r\n   And see it scattered by the spendthrift breeze;\r\n   And after that the Winter cold and drear.\r\n   So runs the perfect cycle of the year.\r\n   And so from youth to manhood do we go,\r\n   And fall to weary days and locks of snow.\r\n   Love only knows no winter; never dies:\r\n   Nor cares for frowning storms or leaden skies\r\n   And mine for thee shall never pass away,\r\n   Though my weak lips may falter in my lay.\r\n\r\n      Adieu!  Adieu! yon silent evening star,\r\n   The night\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador, doth gleam afar,\r\n   And bid the shepherd bring his flocks to fold.\r\n   Perchance before our inland seas of gold\r\n   Are garnered by the reapers into sheaves,\r\n   Perchance before I see the Autumn leaves,\r\n   I may behold thy city; and lay down\r\n   Low at thy feet the poet\xe2\x80\x99s laurel crown.\r\n\r\n      Adieu!  Adieu! yon silver lamp, the moon,\r\n   Which turns our midnight into perfect noon,\r\n   Doth surely light thy towers, guarding well\r\n   Where Dante sleeps, where Byron loved to dwell.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n         Printed by T. and A.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\r\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\r\nFoundation\'s web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
