You might search the coast for miles and\r\nnot find another bit of nature so bare and rent and ragged as this. So\r\nfiercely had the storms driven over it, so wildly had the wind and\r\nwaves beat, that the few cedars which once flourished as its only bit\r\nof greenness were long ago dead, and now held up only bleached and\r\nragged hands. Jutting out into the sea, the surf rolled and thundered\r\nalong its jagged shore of rock and sand, and was never silent. It\r\nwould have been an island but for the narrow strips of sand, heaped\r\nhigh and ridgelike, which bound it to the main land; and this slender\r\nbridge, it often seemed, would be torn away by the ravenous sea which\r\ngnawed and engulfed great tracts at once, and yet heaped it higher and\r\nbroader in the next storm. Beyond, on the firm and unyielding land,\r\nthe pine woods stood up, vast, dim, and silent, stretching away into\r\nthe interior. So, with the great dark barrier of forest behind and the\r\nwaste of shining sea in front, Culm Rock seemed shut out from all the\r\nrest of the world. True, sails flitted along the horizon, and the\r\nsmoke of foreign-bound steamers trailed against the sky, giving token\r\nof the great world\'s life and stir; and there were Skipper Ben and the\r\n"White Gull" who touched at the little wharf at Culm every week; but\r\nfor these, the people--for there were people who dwelt here--might\r\nhave lived in another sphere for aught they knew or were conscious of\r\nwhat was transpiring in the wonderful land which lay beyond the\r\nstretch of sea, and between which and themselves the "White Gull" was\r\nthe only means of communication.\r\n\r\n  Do you wonder that people could spend their lives here, die, and never\r\nhave seen the world without? There were only a dozen houses,--poor,\r\nracked, weather-beaten things, nestled on a bit of sand on a far\r\ncorner of Culm,--inhabited by fishermen and their families. They were\r\nrough, hardy folk, but ignorant, and with only ambition enough to get\r\ntheir living out of the great sea, and a poor and scanty enough living\r\nat that. Skipper Ben brought them molasses and calicoes down in the\r\n"White Gull," and took their fish in exchange; and if he told them a\r\nbit of news from the great city and the greater world, it was all very\r\nwell. If he failed to do this, it was all very well too.\r\n\r\n  Back of the fisher huts, the rocks rose high and dark, and quite hid\r\nthe pine woods and the isthmus of yellow sand, and everything that\r\ncould make Culm at all cheery or pleasant. This eminence was Wind\r\nCliff, and served as a landmark for all the sailors whose path lay\r\nalong the coast. Around this the gulls were alway flitting and\r\nscreaming, and their nests were everywhere in the crevices of the\r\nrocks. Bald and gray it rose, scarred and rent with storms and age,\r\nand so steep as to be almost inaccessible. It fronted the north-west,\r\nand from its sharp tip the rock sloped south to the sea, and held in\r\none of its great hollows down by the shore a house--such a house as\r\nyou would not have looked for at Culm--with walls of stone and tall,\r\nancient chimneys and deep-set windows, like eyes looking forever at\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n  It was so dark and weather-beaten that at first sight you might almost\r\nfancy it to be but some quaint, odd shape which the rocks had taken,\r\nby dint of the stress of winds and waves beating upon them for long\r\nages. But a house it was, and made by human hands, and human beings\r\ndwelt in it. At night the red light from its windows streamed out upon\r\nthe water, and in many a dark and tempestuous watch had Skipper Ben\r\nguided the "White Gull" into port through the friendly gleaming of\r\nthis beacon. For a long period of years the old house had stood empty\r\nand tenantless, the windows and doors broken and gone, the wind\r\nsweeping through and the rain beating in, and everything but the stout\r\nwalls and chimneys a ruin. The superstitious fishermen would not\r\ninhabit it, and told tales of smugglers and pirates who made it their\r\nhaunt, with other fanciful stories which always seem to linger about\r\nthe sea, and in which there was not the faintest shadow of truth.\r\nDesolate and neglected, it stood there year after year, till, one day,\r\nSkipper Ben brought down carpenters and masons on the "White Gull,"\r\nand straightway they went at work upon the old house. Doors went up,\r\nwindows went in, a piazza pushed itself out towards the sea-front,\r\nand there was great bustle and activity about it for weeks. Then the\r\nlaborers went away, and when the skipper came again, he brought,\r\ninstead of groceries and store-cloth, a great quantity of furniture,\r\nthe like of which the poor people at Culm Rock had never seen, and\r\nwith the furniture came the master of the new house--a sorrowful,\r\nbowed man--and his housekeeper, a thin, wrinkled negro woman.\r\n\r\n  Then the smoke curled out of the great stone chimneys once more, the\r\nlight streamed from the windows at night, and the fishermen and\r\nsailors rejoiced that at last the old house had found a tenant and no\r\nlonger yawned bare and empty. The "White Gull" came more than once\r\nwith a cargo for the master of the stone house, who, the skipper told\r\nthe Culm folk, "was a mighty rich man, but the down-heartedest chap\r\nhe\'d ever cast eyes on. Why, man, he just sot lookin\' over the rail\r\nthe best part o\' the way down, with his eyes in the water, and said no\r\nmore nor a stone. What ye think? Now lookee here, men, let me give ye\r\na bit o\' advice. Don\'t ye go to pesterin\' him with yer talk and yer\r\nquestions; fur he\'s diff\'rent make \'an I be, an\' \'twon\'t do. Let him\r\nalone, an\' keep yer own side o\' the Rock."\r\n\r\n  The skipper\'s word was looked upon with respect by all the fish-folk,\r\nand they heeded his advice. So, in consequence, the owner of the stone\r\nmansion was undisturbed, and lived in the greatest seclusion. He never\r\ncame within the limits of the little village, and whenever he was\r\nseen, it was only as pacing slowly along the shore. He passed the\r\nfishermen as they were hanging up their seines in the sun without\r\nheeding them, or acknowledging their respectful bows. The old black\r\nhousekeeper came down to the village sometimes after fish or gulls\'\r\neggs, but went her way without satisfying the eager questions with\r\nwhich the women plied her. So one year passed away, then a second, and\r\nthe master of the stone house was still as much a mystery to the poor\r\nfishers as ever. He rarely walked upon the sand, gave them not a look\r\nif ever they chanced to meet, and living, apparently, for no one but\r\nhimself, took not the slightest interest in their welfare, cared\r\nnaught for wreck or disaster on the shore, and seemed always stern and\r\nsorrowful.\r\n\r\n  No company ever came down on the "White Gull" to visit this strange\r\nand silent man, and he had no friends, apparently. Skipper Ben\r\nbrought stores for him occasionally, and sometimes a letter; but this\r\nlast event was a rare one, and the man seemed to have little more\r\ncommunication with the great world out of which he had come than did\r\nthe humble Culm fishermen. With winds and storms, the third year\r\nrolled around, and the master of the old house was still as much of a\r\nrecluse as ever; but the Culm people had ceased to regard him with any\r\ninterest, and the man led a most solitary life, hardly seeing a human\r\nbeing, other than his housekeeper, from month to month. Do you wonder\r\nwhat could make him so stern and sad? Here is his story:--\r\n\r\n  One sweet and golden summer day, a man stood by the bedside of his\r\nwife,--he, crushed and heart-broken; she, faint and dying, but calm\r\nand loving and comforting. She held his hand, and whispered brokenly\r\nsuch words as she could only hope to comfort him with; and the last\r\nfaint whisper which trembled on her lips was, "Oh, Richard, don\'t\r\nfail--don\'t fail to--to find Him and cling to Him, and come--come\r\nup--too." And with that she was dead. And the man left the bedside,\r\nand went out into the summer fields, where the birds were flitting and\r\nthe bees droning and the wide earth seemed brimming with life and joy,\r\nand prayed that he might die too, since she was gone. But the birds\r\nsang on as joyously as ever, and the sun shone no less brightly\r\nbecause of the sorrow in the earth, and after his first tears were\r\nshed, his heart began to grow hard and bitter, and he put away the\r\ndying whisper, and went back to the dear dead face, cold and stern.\r\nHis friends came to console him, but he would not listen, and after it\r\nwas all over, and the gentle face hidden forever under the brown\r\nearth, he began to think of fleeing to some spot where he might find\r\nrest and quietness, and hide himself from all thoughts of the dear one\r\nwho had left him, smothering his sorrow, and living as if she had not\r\nbeen. "I have been robbed," he said, bitterly; "all my happiness has\r\nbeen stolen from me. I can\'t seek Him; I will not. Oh, if there is a\r\nkind and merciful God, why has he stricken me? why has he taken all\r\nthe joy out of my life? why has he left me without a comforter in the\r\nworld?" So, without seeking for a Comforter, without striving to "find\r\nHim," as the dear voice had whispered, he turned away and strove to\r\ncrush out the love and the tender memories which haunted his heart,\r\nand most of all that dying whisper which said, "Don\'t fail--don\'t fail\r\nto find _Him_."\r\n\r\n  Grown suddenly stern and morose, Richard Trafford looked about him for\r\na refuge where he might flee from all society, and most of all from\r\nthe spot where _her_ presence seemed yet to linger. He discovered wild\r\nand solitary Culm Rock, and purchased the old stone house. Here, he\r\nthought, with the everlasting sound of the sea in his ears, with all\r\nthe wildness and barrenness about him, and apart from the rest of\r\nmankind, he would bury himself, and forget all the bright and happy\r\ndays which had passed. He left his friends without giving them any\r\nclew to his whereabouts, and with faithful old Hagar, who persisted in\r\nfollowing him, took up his abode by the sea. But do you think his\r\nsorrow lessened? Do you think he found peace and happiness again? He\r\ncarried his hard and bitter heart with him, and there was no happiness\r\nto be found by the sea. One year after another rolled away until the\r\nthree were gone, and still he was wandering along his own thorny path,\r\nbowed with his sorrow, sighing and lamenting for the bright form which\r\nhad left him, and still deaf to its whisper, "Find _Him_, and come up\r\ntoo." He walked on the sands, lonely and desolate; he paced about the\r\ngreat rooms of the stone house, oppressed and heavy-hearted; he shut\r\nhimself up in his library and pored over books in vain. His sorrow\r\nclung to him, followed him everywhere; his heart was stubborn and\r\nbitter and rebellious. Perhaps he despaired of ever losing the\r\nburden, for one day he brought out a portrait, wrapped and swathed\r\nwith great care, and, tearing all the veilings off, gazed once more on\r\nthe sainted face which he had not looked upon for three long and heavy\r\nyears. He did not hide it again, but hung it upon his library wall,\r\nwhere the tender face and calm and loving eyes looked down and almost\r\nmelted him to tears.\r\n\r\n  He wondered how he could have kept it veiled and hidden so long. He\r\nwondered if those three years had not been spent in vain, unless it\r\nwere to learn that he could not crush out his sweet memories if he\r\ntried.\r\n\r\n  He sank down into his chair as he thought of this, and going back over\r\nthe three past dreary years, remembered what a weary blank they were,\r\nthought, with a heavy sigh, what a shipwreck his life had been, and\r\nhow he was now floating about without rudder or compass or anchor,\r\nmerely a drifting wreck. And as he sits there in the sunshine which\r\nstreams through the wide, high old window, we will see him for the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLETTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Richard Trafford was a man of forty; but his hair was tinged with\r\ngray, and grief and wretchedness had worn heavy lines in his face. As\r\nhe sat in the library this September afternoon, looking up at the\r\nportrait on the wall, he seemed almost an old man. The room was wide\r\nand high, with tall oaken bookcases at either end. Two great windows,\r\nbefore one of which he sat, looked out upon the sea and the white line\r\nof foam curling upon the sand. The waves were but mere ripples this\r\ncalm afternoon, but from the shore there came up a ceaseless, steady\r\nmurmur that made itself heard in the quiet of the room; and by and by\r\nTrafford\'s eyes turned from the calm face above him and looked out\r\nseaward. White and shining lay the vast expanse, with here and there\r\nthe faint film of a sail upon the horizon. Nothing to be seen but\r\nwater and the great dome of sky and the little spit of yellow sand\r\nwhere the tide was murmuring. How many sunny afternoons he had thus\r\nlooked out upon the sea, vast and gleaming! How many lonely afternoons\r\nand long, weary nights he had listened to the slow chanting of the\r\ntide, watched it creep up the sand with its puffs of thick foam,\r\nwatched it as it slowly receded and left its burden of weed and shell\r\nbehind! Flowing and ebbing forever, alway at its work, in and out, in\r\nand out, through storm and shine, through night and day, it seemed to\r\nmock his own idle, useless life, and reproach him with its never\r\nsilent voice. Of what use, he wondered as he sat there, was such a\r\nlife as his? To-morrow the tide would be at its work again, the ships\r\ngo on, the sun shine warm and bright over all,--and he? For him\r\nto-morrow would be but the repetition of to-day; the same dragging\r\nhours, the same apathetic poring over books, the same half-hours at\r\nthe organ with the music-books, playing sad melodies which accorded\r\nwell with his own sombre feelings. He looked up at the portrait and\r\nsighed; remembered the dear one\'s dying words, and thought, "I might\r\nhave found Him once; but it\'s too late now. All that passed away a\r\nlong time ago, and now,--it\'s only to plod on and on, year in and year\r\nout, till the end." And what then?\r\n\r\n  There came a soft rap at the door.\r\n\r\n  "Come in, Hagar," said he, heavily, without taking his eyes off the\r\nsea; and then the door was pushed open, and a head, surmounted by a\r\ngreat yellow turban, looked in.\r\n\r\n  "Somethin\' fur you, Mas\'r Dick," said the owner of the turban, without\r\ncoming in, however.\r\n\r\n  "What is it?" said Trafford, abstractedly.\r\n\r\n  The door opened wider, and the old housekeeper entered. She was bent\r\nand thin, with great wrinkles in her forehead and face, and wherever a\r\ntuft of wool peeped out from under the fanciful headgear, it showed\r\nquite gray; but her step was quick and firm as she went across the\r\nfloor to the figure by the great window.\r\n\r\n  "A letter, Mas\'r Dick," said she, standing by Trafford\'s chair; "dat\r\nyer old skipper brought it. Said he brung it straight from de city."\r\n\r\n  "Ben Tate?" asked the master.\r\n\r\n  Hagar nodded assent. "Said ye was to hev it dis yer afternoon, sure,"\r\nsaid she; "\'twa\'n\'t no letter to be lyin\' \'round in dem Culm huts, so\r\nhe cum up here wid it hisself. Be it frum Hastings, Mas\'r Dick?"\r\n\r\n  Hagar had lived in the Trafford family from childhood, and Richard had\r\ngrown up to manhood under her eyes, had married, and she went to live\r\nwith the young people. She had seen the wife fade and die, and the\r\nhusband grow stern and gloomy, and out of solicitude and affection had\r\nclung faithfully to him through all fortunes. It would seem, to hear\r\nher talk, that she never had quite realized that Richard Trafford, the\r\nman of forty, was any other than "Mas\'r Dick," the boy whose smartness\r\nat school, and whose popularity among his companions, had always been\r\nher boast and pride. Gray and worn he was getting, gloomy, sad, even\r\nharsh at times to her, yet he was only "Mas\'r Dick," and her own\r\nlittle boy, for whom she must watch and care to the best of her\r\nability. Now, as she queried where the letter might be from, she\r\ndropped down in a chair a little way from him, and waited till he\r\nshould see fit to answer her question; for could there be a paradise\r\non earth, it would have been represented to Hagar by Hastings,--that\r\ngreat city where their old home had been, where her own childhood had\r\nbeen spent, and where all the friends of her kin and color dwelt. It\r\nwas a hard matter to tear herself away from them all and follow\r\nRichard Trafford to dreary Culm Rock; but, with some tears and\r\nsighing, she had said to her people, "Yer don\'t know nuffin about it.\r\nYe habn\'t got any \'Mas\'r Dick;\' so how ken ye? \'Tain\'t in dis yer old\r\nheart to let de chile go off sufferin\' all by hisself, now! Bress de\r\nLord, I\'ll stick to de poor boy, an\' keep him frum jes\' worryin\' his\r\nlife out." So here she was in her old age, away from all her people,\r\nyet happy because it was to serve "Mas\'r Dick."\r\n\r\n  Trafford took up the letter,--a large, thick one, bearing the marks\r\nof the skipper\'s great fingers on its envelope, and smelling of fish,\r\nas if it had performed its journey in company with herring and\r\ncod,--and said, "Yes, Hagar; it\'s from Hastings, of course."\r\n\r\n  The old housekeeper lingered, looked at the master in hopes that he\r\nwould bid her stay, and then, as he tore open the letter with a moody\r\nface, went slowly out, closing the door softly behind her.\r\n\r\n  The handwriting was unfamiliar, and Trafford wondered where it came\r\nfrom, feeling vexed that it should have arrived at that moment; and so\r\nbegan to read an emphatically business letter:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                       "HASTINGS, Sept. 7th.\r\n\r\n"_To Mr. Richard Trafford, of Culm Rock_:\r\n\r\n  "SIR,--I am sorry to be under the painful necessity of informing you\r\nof your brother\'s death. The Rev. Oliver Trafford died the 15th of\r\nMarch last, leaving me as the executor of his estate. He was anxious\r\nto see you till the very last; but as we had no clew to your\r\nwhereabouts, and only discovered your place of residence by accident a\r\nshort time ago, that pleasure was denied him. He left one child--a boy\r\nof fourteen, or thereabouts--for whose welfare he was much distressed.\r\nHe often expressed it as his desire that, should you ever make your\r\nappearance, this boy might be received by you as your own, and,\r\nindeed, left written statements to that effect. There is, also, among\r\nhis private papers, a sealed letter for you, which, I doubt not,\r\ncontains some such request. The boy, I am happy to say, is not likely\r\nto prove a burden or trouble to you, being obedient and all that\r\ncould be desired. He is smart and sprightly, and quite a favorite in\r\nthe circle in which his father moved, and from my own acquaintance\r\nwith him (very intimate during the past six months) can assure you\r\nthat he will prove anything but a poor acquisition.\r\n\r\n  "As to the estate, I am sorry to say that Mr. Trafford left but little\r\nof value,--enough, perhaps, to educate the boy; but, as I hear you are\r\na gentleman of fortune, this, I presume, is a matter of very little\r\nmoment. I shall be happy to show you your brother\'s accounts at any\r\ntime, and to have the honor of answering any inquiries which you may\r\nbe disposed to make. I enclose a note from your nephew. Awaiting your\r\ndecision in the matter, I am, sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                        "Thomas Gray.\r\n"Room 8, at No. 67 Court St."\r\n\r\n\r\n  With a gloomy face, Trafford laid down the lawyer\'s letter, and took\r\nup his nephew\'s. He did not remember ever having seen the boy. He was,\r\nmost likely, a crazy, boisterous lad, that would be forever in\r\nmischief, and bring the house about their heads. As for having him at\r\nCulm Rock, it was too preposterous a thought to be entertained for a\r\nmoment. He had decided at once how Mr. Gray\'s letter should be\r\nanswered, and felt too indifferent to care about reading his nephew\'s.\r\nWhat did these things matter to him? Yet, after a time, he thought\r\nbetter of it, and took up the note again, saying to himself, "I\'ll\r\nread it, if only because it\'s poor Noll\'s boy;" and opening the\r\nmissive, found therein the following frank boy\'s letter:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     "HASTINGS, Sept. 7th.\r\n\r\n  "DEAR UNCLE RICHARD,--I don\'t know what to say to you--it all seems so\r\nstrange and awkward. Mr. Gray said I was to write, however, and send\r\nthe note with his; so I am trying. It is such a long time since I saw\r\nyou that I\'ve forgotten your face, and I think you must have forgotten\r\nthat there was such a person as myself in the world. Papa died almost\r\nsix months ago, and he said all the time, at the last, \'Go for Uncle\r\nRichard!\' but I didn\'t know where you were, and Mr. Gray could not\r\nfind out till a short time ago; so papa died without seeing you. I\r\ndon\'t know what he wanted to say, but he told me that I was to live\r\nwith you and be your boy; and Mr. Gray says the papers say the same\r\nthing." Here the writer had evidently faltered, and been at a loss\r\nhow to proceed further with intelligence which it, apparently, was\r\nvery irksome for him to disclose; but he continued with, "There are\r\nonly you and me left, and I am sure I would like very much to be your\r\nboy and live with you, as papa said; but--but I don\'t know--I\r\nmean--Well, I can\'t say it, Uncle Richard, but I mean that I wish I\r\nmight know what you thought about it first. I wouldn\'t like to come,\r\nyou know, unless you liked,--unless you were _glad_ to have me. Mr.\r\nGray has all papa\'s business to settle, and I suspect he wants to get\r\nme settled, too, somewhere, pretty quick; and so, if you please, I\r\nhope you won\'t mind whatever he may say about me, and only do just as\r\nyou like about giving him permission to send me. I can find a home\r\nsomewhere, if you would rather.\r\n\r\n  "My name is Oliver,--Noll, everybody calls me; I\'m almost fifteen, and\r\nhave always been at school in Hastings, and papa used to give me\r\nlessons beside. Is there a school at Culm Rock? I do wish you could\r\nhave seen papa, dear Uncle Richard, he longed so for you when he died;\r\nbut there is a letter for you among his papers, which will be sent to\r\nCulm Rock, if I do not come to bring it. Mr. Gray will tell you all\r\nabout me, I suppose, and the affairs besides; so I will stop.\r\n\r\n                                             "Your nephew,\r\n\r\n                                             "NOLL TRAFFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n  "--And don\'t mind what Mr. Gray says, please, and only do as you like."\r\n\r\n\r\n  Richard Trafford finished this letter with something like a grim smile\r\non his lips.\r\n\r\n  "The boy has got the true Trafford spirit," he said to himself, "and\r\nsome of Brother Noll\'s gentleness, I fancy. Ah, Noll was always a\r\nhappier man than I!"\r\n\r\n  He read the boy\'s letter again, wondering what made it seem so bright\r\nand pleasant, and feeling vexed with himself for doing it. Why should\r\nhe care for this boy or this boy\'s letter? Had he not fled to Culm\r\nRock to escape all knowledge of what was transpiring in the world\r\nwithout,--to forget friends and kin, if that was possible? He looked\r\nup and met the sweet, grave eyes of his wife looking down into his,\r\nand read something there which made his eyes fill and his lip quiver.\r\n\r\n  "Ah," he sighed, "why did I not try to follow after?" And with this\r\nthought in his heart, he rose and stood by the window, looking down at\r\nthe crawling tide. His thoughts came back to the boy, presently, and\r\nwith another grim smile upon his face, he remembered what a dull and\r\ndreary place Culm Rock would be for a lad of fourteen. He would soon\r\ntire of it, and be glad enough to go back to Hastings, he fancied. If\r\nhe was a wild boy, he should go back on the return of the "White\r\nGull;" if he could be tolerated, he might stay till he tired of it. It\r\nwas poor Brother Noll\'s boy, after all, he thought, and he could not\r\nmake his heart quite hard enough to refuse him a home. So, when\r\nSkipper Ben returned to Hastings with his next cargo of fish, he\r\ncarried a letter hidden away under his pea-jacket, and this was what\r\nit contained:--\r\n\r\n                        "CULM ROCK, Sept. 12th.\r\n\r\n"_To Noll Trafford_:\r\n\r\n  "Come; you are welcome.\r\n\r\n"UNCLE RICHARD."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nON THE "WHITE GULL."\r\n\r\n\r\n  The breeze was crisp and fresh that morning, and the skipper anxious\r\nto set sail. Everything was in readiness on board the "White Gull,"\r\nbut still its master did not give the word to cast off, and stumped up\r\nand down the deck, muttering and grumbling to his mate.\r\n\r\n  "Allus jes\' so!" he said, wrathfully; "these town folks never up to\r\ntime. Think on\'t, Jack, that \'ere lawyer, Gray, promised to get the\r\nyoungster here a good half-hour afore sunrise! Here it\'s sun-up\r\nalready, and this breeze won\'t last forever, nuther."\r\n\r\n  "Why don\'t ye go \'long \'thout him?" queried Jack Snape from his seat\r\non a bucket.\r\n\r\n  "Would, ef \'twa\'n\'t fur that pesky lawyer!" growled the skipper; "an\'\r\n\'tain\'t every day ye can get a passenger fur the Rock, nuther. Mought\r\nas well take what passage-money he can, a fellow mought, Jack."\r\n\r\n  The mate of the "White Gull" began to whistle, and fumbling in his\r\npea-jacket brought out a pipe and tobacco, with which he proceeded to\r\nconsole himself. Skipper Ben took a few more impatient turns up and\r\ndown the deck, and sat down at last in grim despair, while the wind\r\ncame in strong, steady puffs, and the craft rocked and swayed gently\r\non the swell of the tide. The city behind them was hardly awake yet.\r\nIts roofs and steeples loomed through a veil of haze or smoke which\r\nhovered over and clung about the towers, and only a faint murmur told\r\nof the stir and bustle which were presently to reign. On the wharves a\r\nfew early drays were rumbling down after their loads of merchandise,\r\nand one or two vessels had left their moorings, and, taking advantage\r\nof the favorable breeze, were standing out to sea, which fact did not\r\nat all add to Skipper Ben\'s good-nature.\r\n\r\n  "Here they come," drawled the mate, putting up his pipe; and then a\r\ncarriage came rattling down the wharf, stopping in front of the "White\r\nGull."\r\n\r\n  "Come at last, hev ye?" shouted the skipper, gruffly. "Call this a\r\nhalf-hour afore sunrise, squire?"\r\n\r\n  "Well," said the lawyer, looking at his watch, "I thought we were\r\nprodigiously early. Driver, put these trunks aboard in a hurry, since\r\nthe skipper is waiting; and--Noll, are you ready?"\r\n\r\n  The skipper left his craft and came to bear a hand with the trunks,\r\nlooking askance, meanwhile, at the boy who had got out of the carriage\r\nand stood on the wharf\'s edge, surveying the "Gull."\r\n\r\n  "Hope you\'ll have a good run, skipper," said the lawyer, as the\r\nbaggage went over into a cavernous aperture in the deck; "fine breeze,\r\nI should say. Have a good care of this passenger of yours, man."\r\n\r\n  "Ay, squire, we\'ll manage. Can\'t stop fur words from ye this morning;\r\nshould ha\' been a long piece down the coast afore this time o\' day.\r\nBear a hand there, Jack!"\r\n\r\n  "Good-by, Noll," said the lawyer; "keep up a stout heart, my boy, and\r\ndon\'t forget your city friends. You\'ll have a fine run down to Culm,\r\nand you must send me a line back by the skipper. Good-by!" and Mr.\r\nGray got into his carriage and rolled back toward the city.\r\n\r\n  Noll Trafford stood leaning against a great post and looking after the\r\nlawyer\'s carriage with a slight choking in his throat, till the\r\nskipper\'s gruff "Get aboard here, lad!" warned him that the "Gull" was\r\nabout to cast off. Slowly the wharf glided away, and the little\r\ncoasting vessel stood out into the channel. The city spread itself out\r\nbehind them, a long maze of brick and slate, with spires and domes\r\nshowing dimly through the blue haze which wrapped them about. On the\r\nfar, watery horizon lay a belt of vapory clouds which presently began\r\nto rend and tear and float off in ragged masses, and then a great red\r\nsun gleamed through and made a golden roadway across the sea, and\r\ntransformed the misty fleeces of vapor to wonderful hangings of\r\namethyst, streaked with great threads of scarlet.\r\n\r\n  "Jes\' sunrise!" muttered the skipper; "make the best o\' this \'ere\r\nbreeze, eh, Jack?"\r\n\r\n  "Ay," drawled the mate, "we\'ll catch it afore long, skipper."\r\n\r\n  The city\'s old cold front suddenly gleamed out in vivid gold, the\r\nspires grew rosy in the first rays of sunlight, and, all its dimness\r\nand dulness gone, Hastings lay gleaming and glowing in the fair\r\nmorning light like some vision of fairyland.\r\n\r\n  Noll Trafford, sitting on a great bale of merchandise near the stern\r\nof the "Gull," gazed at the city, slowly sinking and fading in the\r\nsea, with a feeling somewhat akin to homesickness. It had never looked\r\nso bright to him before as at this moment of his departure from it,\r\nand he was leaving behind a great many friends--all his school\r\nacquaintances, all the scenes and haunts that were dear to him--to\r\ngo--where? He hardly knew, himself, but his bright fancy had pictured\r\nCulm as some pleasant little sea town, where there would, perhaps, be\r\na great beach to ramble upon and hunt for minerals and shells, and\r\nwhere he would soon make plenty of new acquaintances. And Uncle\r\nRichard he had pictured to himself as a gentle, kind man,--grave,\r\nperhaps, but who would love him and try to fill the place of his own\r\ndead father. So, with these bright visions filling his mind, it was\r\nlittle wonder that he turned from the stern, after Hastings had faded\r\ninto the merest blue dot on the horizon-line, and looked forward to\r\nthe time when the journey\'s end should be reached, with happy\r\nanticipations. Before them lay the vast and boundless sea, with no\r\ntrace of shore or island save a low blue belt in the south, like a\r\ncloud, and the "Gull" began to pitch and toss somewhat with the great\r\nocean-swell. Skipper Ben, having got well in the way of the breeze\r\nwhich was carrying his vessel steadily before it, began to regain his\r\ngood-humor. Sitting on the top of a cask, he puffed away at his pipe\r\nand soliloquized to himself about his passenger, who sat regarding\r\nJack Snape\'s movements at the helm with much interest. The skipper\r\nhad three or four boys at home,--great sturdy, brown-faced,\r\nstout-armed fellows,--between whom and this fair-faced, curly-headed\r\nboy there was little resemblance, he felt. "Town breedin\', town\r\nbreedin\'," muttered he; "it\'s curi\'s what it\'ll make of a lad. This\r\nchap\'ll grow up with his head full o\' le\'rnin\' into a lawyer or parson\r\nor somethin\' like, and my lads\'ll be skippers like their dad, with no\r\nle\'rnin\' to speak on. I\'ll warrant this lad could get off more\r\nbook-stuff in five minutes \'an mine ever heerd on." His eyes followed\r\nthe boy as he went out to stand by Jack\'s elbow and ply this\r\nslow-witted gentleman with quick, eager questions. He was slender and\r\nrather tall for one of his age, but lithe and agile, as the skipper\r\nnoted. "One o\' mine could jes\' trip him with a turn o\' his hand,"\r\nthought he; yet he regarded the lad with a mixture of kindness and\r\nrespect, after all. There were other things in the world beside bone\r\nand muscle, he remembered, and when the boy came slowly along the\r\ndeck, after a fruitless attempt to coax the mate into conversation, he\r\nput out one of his big red hands and stopped him. Noll looked up,\r\ninquiringly.\r\n\r\n  "Goin\' down to Culm for a bit o\' vacation?--to git scarce o\' the\r\nbooks, eh?" queried the skipper.\r\n\r\n  "Vacation? Oh, no," said the boy, quickly; "I\'m going there to\r\nlive,--to have a home."\r\n\r\n  The master of the "Gull" came near dropping his pipe with amazement.\r\n"_You_ live at Culm!" said he, incredulous; "what ye goin\' to live\r\nin?"\r\n\r\n  It was Noll\'s turn to look amazed. He suddenly faced the skipper,\r\nsaying, very earnestly, "What kind of a place is Culm Rock, anyhow?\r\nIsn\'t it a town?"\r\n\r\n  A broad grin stretched across the old sailor\'s face, then he laughed\r\naloud. "Did ye hear that, Jack?" he cried; "here\'s a lad what\'s goin\'\r\nto Culm to live, an\' he wants to know ef it\'s a town!"\r\n\r\n  "\'Twon\'t take him long to find out arter he gets there," drawled Mr.\r\nSnape.\r\n\r\n  Noll turned away and walked to the stern, thinking the skipper was a\r\nvery uncivil fellow to laugh at his ignorance, and sat down again on\r\nthe bale, secretly ill at ease on account of these sailors\' words.\r\nWhat kind of a place could Culm Rock be?\r\n\r\n  All around the boundless waste of waves flashed and glittered under\r\nthe sun, and the "Gull" sailed steadily on her course with not a\r\nfleck of land in sight,--nothing around but the vast blue of the\r\nsea,--above, only the great azure arch of sky. It was a new and\r\nstrange sight to Noll Trafford. He lay on his back on the bale, and\r\nlooked up into the wonderful depths of the blue dome, where no clouds\r\nsailed, and speculated about his destination. Somehow, the bright\r\nvision of a pleasant sea town with a shining beach of sand and pebbles\r\nhad faded, and in its stead there was doubt and perplexity. Was it\r\nonly a rock, as the name suggested, and no town? However, Uncle\r\nRichard was there, and that was one comfort; and perhaps the skipper\r\nwas only joking, after all. He wished, though, that he might know what\r\nto expect; he wondered why he had not thought to ask Mr. Gray before\r\nstarting. He lay a long time listening to the rush of water about the\r\nvessel, a strange and unusual sound to his ears. By and by a brawny\r\nhand touched his shoulder, and a gruff voice said,--\r\n\r\n  "Lookee here, lad!" Noll turned about and saw the skipper. "\'Twa\'n\'t\r\nmanners in me to laugh at ye, I \'low," said he, good-humoredly; "but\r\n\'twas droll, ennyhow. Hain\'t ye never been to Culm afore?"\r\n\r\n  "Never," said Noll.\r\n\r\n  "An\' ye don\'t know nuthin\' what it\'s like?"\r\n\r\n  "No; how should I?" said his passenger; "I didn\'t know there was such\r\na place in the world a month ago."\r\n\r\n  The skipper looked incredulous once more. "An\' now ye goin\' there to\r\nlive!" he exclaimed; "why, there ben\'t but one house there fit fur\r\nsuch as you, an\' \'tain\'t there ye\'re bound, not by a long shot!"\r\n\r\n  "But _one_ house! Whose is it?" cried Noll, eagerly.\r\n\r\n  "Why, it be one Trafford\'s, one o\' the strangest--" A sudden\r\nexpression in the boy\'s face checked the words on the skipper\'s\r\ntongue, and the truth began to dawn upon his slow brain. "Great\r\nfishes!" cried he, falling back a step or two, "ye ben\'t goin\'\r\n_there_?"\r\n\r\n  "Yes," said Noll, as quietly as he could. "Why not?"\r\n\r\n  The skipper gave him a long, steady survey, and then stumped away\r\nacross the deck without another word, leaned over the rail, and began\r\nto whistle. Noll looked after him, half determined to follow and\r\ndemand what he meant, yet half dreading to learn that all his visions\r\nwere a great way from the truth. Perhaps it would be better to wait,\r\nhe thought; night would bring the journey to an end, and then he\r\nshould know all. So he did not follow the skipper, but kept his seat,\r\nwhile a great many shadowy forebodings crept into his heart, and he\r\nbegan to look back over the trackless waste which they had come, and\r\nwish, almost, that he was back in dear old Hastings--in the old home\r\nwhere papa and he had spent so many happy hours--and that Culm Rock\r\nwas a myth. The sun rose royally up to noon, and odors of dinner began\r\nto ascend from the hatchway. Noll had a dinner of his own somewhere in\r\na basket, which he brought forth and ate on the bale which served him\r\nfor a seat, enjoying the novelty in spite of the anxious speculations\r\nconcerning his new home in which he could not help indulging.\r\n\r\n  After dinner the skipper was in better humor than ever, and took his\r\nturn at the helm. Noll, wandering about the deck, stopped to watch\r\nhim, whereupon the master of the "Gull" good-naturedly answered all\r\nhis questions, and even allowed him to take the tiller a few minutes,\r\nlaughing the while at his white hands that could hardly grasp it.\r\n\r\n  "Wish ye could see my lads\' hands!" he said; "could take both \'o\'\r\nyourn in one uv \'em, an\' not know they was holding anything. But\r\nyou\'ll have browner paws afore ye leave Culm!"\r\n\r\n  "Of course!" said Noll, "for I\'m going to get Uncle Richard to teach\r\nme to row,--I can swim now,--and I\'m going to be around the shore half\r\nthe time."\r\n\r\n  "Likely enough, likely enough!" said the skipper, meditatively; and\r\nwhen Noll had passed on, he muttered, "It\'s a pesky shame fur the lad\r\nto be sent off and cooped up on the Rock! Don\'t know what he\'s comin\'\r\nto, nuther. I\'ll be blamed ef I ain\'t sorry for the boy!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nDISAPPOINTMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It was late afternoon when land loomed up blue on the horizon. Mr.\r\nSnape had taken the tiller, and Noll stood leaning over the rail by\r\nhim, eager and watchful for the first look at Culm. "Mought as well\r\nwait a bit," Jack Snape had drawled out; "we sha\'n\'t get there fur a\r\nlong while yet, lad."\r\n\r\n  But the boy chose to keep his place, and kept his eyes unweariedly on\r\nthe distant point for which the "Gull" was making. Yet it was but\r\ntiresome watching, after all, and the brisk breeze seemed to have\r\nfailed them somewhat, for the vessel\'s speed had sensibly diminished.\r\n\r\n  "He\'ll be glad \'nough to look t\'other way arter he gits there,"\r\nmuttered Skipper Ben, between the whiffs at his pipe; "my lads \'ud\r\nthink they\'s killed for sartin to be shut up there a week." He got up\r\nat last, knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and disappeared down the\r\nhatchway, returning presently with a spy-glass, which he carried to\r\nhis passenger with, "Lookee here, boy, take this an\' make out what ye\r\nken. \'Tain\'t much ye\'ll see yet, but mebby ye\'ll get a look arter a\r\ntime." He sat down again, looking at the boy\'s face from time to time,\r\nand wondering if this sending him to Culm Rock was not some of that\r\nLawyer Gray\'s work. The skipper had not a very high opinion of\r\nlawyers.\r\n\r\n  Slowly, slowly the blue point began to take shape, and Noll\'s glass\r\nbrought it to his eyes all too faithfully. The skipper saw the eager\r\nlook and the warm color which had been on his face fade slowly out as\r\nthe "Gull" drew nearer and nearer the journey\'s end, and the\r\nwarm-hearted sailor waxed indignant. "Mought ha\' told him what ter\r\nexpect, anyhow!" he muttered, shaking a great bale with his brawny\r\nhands as if it had been Lawyer Gray\'s shoulders.\r\n\r\n  The "Gull" stood in toward shore. First, the pine woods, vast and\r\nsombre, showed themselves; then, a little way on, Culm Rock came\r\nslowly into view, bald, ragged, and desolate. Noll\'s face was very\r\ngrave, but he kept his place and said nothing. Slowly the curve of\r\nthe shore unfolded itself, a long line of yellow sand, length after\r\nlength of scarred and jagged rock. The sound of the surf came faintly\r\nout, sounding over the ripple of water about the "Gull\'s" prow. Not a\r\nsign of life, as yet, had showed itself. The vessel kept steadily on\r\ntill, at last, the whole great breadth of the Rock lay before them,\r\nrising huge and massive out of the sea, and, in a sheltered hollow on\r\nthe shore, a great stone house stood up, gray and weather-beaten as\r\nthe cliffs about it.\r\n\r\n  "Is that the house?" Noll asked, turning to the skipper, and laying\r\ndown his glass.\r\n\r\n  The old sailor nodded assent, thinking to himself that he had never\r\nseen it look darker and gloomier, and wondering what the boy thought.\r\n\r\n  "Aren\'t you going to stop?" Noll asked, as the "Gull" kept on, and the\r\nstone house dropped astern.\r\n\r\n  "Goin\' round to the landin\'," explained Mr. Snape; "\'tain\'t good\r\nmoorin\'s till ye git half a mile fu\'ther round. Ye\'ll git ashore\r\npretty quick."\r\n\r\n  Under the cool and heavy shadow of the Rock they crept, coming out of\r\nit at last into the full glory of the sun\'s setting. All the west was\r\naflame, and the sea glowed and sparkled like molten gold. Even the\r\nwretched little Culm fish-huts looked almost fair and comely in this\r\nflood of light.\r\n\r\n  Noll Trafford scanned the little wharf, where a motley collection of\r\nmen were gathered, with a quick-beating heart. Which of them could be\r\nUncle Richard? Would he give him a kind welcome? The boy\'s spirits\r\nbegan to rise somewhat under the influence of the broad, cheerful glow\r\nof sunshine and the speedy prospect of meeting this uncle who was to\r\nbe as a father to him. The remembrance of the gray old house under the\r\nshadow of the rocks around the curve of the shore still lay somewhat\r\nheavily on his heart; but if Uncle Richard were only glad to see him,\r\nall that would not matter, he thought. He stood by the prow as the\r\n"Gull" moved slowly up to the wharf, eagerly scanning every face that\r\nwas watching the craft\'s motions. A sudden pang of disappointment\r\nchilled him from head to foot, for among that idle, shiftless-looking\r\ngroup, there was not one whom he could possibly mistake for his uncle.\r\nThey were all fishermen, dull-faced, dirty, and out at their elbows.\r\nSome frowsy, ill-clad women had come out of their houses, and, with\r\nchildren clinging to their skirts, looked on with idle curiosity.\r\n\r\n  So this was Culm Rock! Noll\'s bright fancies had all fled, and his\r\nheart was suddenly very heavy. He looked back across the sea toward\r\nHastings, longingly, and thus verified the skipper\'s prediction. If\r\nUncle Richard had only been there to greet him, he thought, chokingly,\r\nit would not have mattered so much, but now, it was all forlorn and\r\ndreary enough.\r\n\r\n  "\'Tain\'t much uv a town arter all; is it?" drawled Mr. Snape, with a\r\nbroad grin on his thick features.\r\n\r\n  "Shut up, Jack!" growled the skipper. "Can\'t ye see the lad\'s got all\r\nhe ken weather?" Then he turned to Noll, proffering his rough\r\nsympathy. "Sorry fur ye!" he said. "Culm ain\'t the place for the like\r\no\' you, an\' what ye cum here fur, I can\'t see. But keep a stout heart,\r\nlad, an\' rough it out best way ye can; ain\'t no other way now."\r\n\r\n  "I\'m going to," said Noll, with an effort; "I won\'t mind after a\r\nlittle, I guess. Good-by, skipper;" and he stepped out on to the\r\nlittle wharf among the fish-folk, who made way, regarding him\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n  "Keep \'long up the shore," called the master of the "Gull" after him,\r\n"and you\'ll cum to the house afore long. I\'ll send yer trunks up by\r\nsome o\' these \'ere good-fur-nothin\' Culm folks. Good-by, lad!"\r\n\r\n  The skipper watched the boyish figure walking away up the sands, and\r\nremarked to his mate, "Ef I knew that was some o\' Gray\'s work, I\'d\r\njes\' like the fun o\' bringin\' the ole chap down here on the \'Gull,\'\r\nan\' lettin\' him loose to browse on the rocks,--jes\' to see how _he\'d_\r\nlike it!"\r\n\r\n  Noll walked briskly, trying to keep up good heart by whistling and\r\nhumming snatches of tunes, looking back over his shoulder at the\r\nwonderful gleaming of the west, and the queer picture which the\r\nfish-huts and the group of idlers made, with the "Gull" lying by the\r\nlittle wharf, her cloud of canvas yet unfurled and its shadow gleaming\r\nwhite as ivory in the depth of water on which she floated. At his feet\r\nthe tide was murmuring. How far and vast stretched the sea! What a\r\nminute atom of earth was Culm Rock, compared with the boundless waste\r\nof waves which compassed it about! Bending over all, the evening sky\r\nlay cool and serene, flushed, where it met the water, with lovely\r\nstains of color. Noll was but dimly conscious of these things as he\r\nhurried on, because his heart was filled with conjectures about the\r\nstone house and the friend he was to find there. The disappointment of\r\nnot finding his uncle awaiting him with a warm greeting still lay\r\nheavily on his heart; and as he passed the curve of the shore, and the\r\nstone house came in sight, his quick pace slackened, and he walked but\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n  There was no one visible on the piazza. All the doors and windows were\r\nclosed, though the evening was warm and mild.\r\n\r\n  The boy wondered if his uncle was absent. Perhaps, he thought, with a\r\nlittle thrill of pleasure, that, after all, was the reason why Uncle\r\nRichard had failed to meet him.\r\n\r\n  A thin blue film of smoke crept up from one of the tall chimneys,\r\ntelling him that some one was within the gloomy old structure, which,\r\nit seemed to him, looked much more like a grim fortress than a\r\n_peaceful_ dwelling. Not a blade of grass or anything green flourished\r\nabout it; all was rock and sand and stranded kelp.\r\n\r\n  His heart beat fast as he went up the piazza-steps, and noted how his\r\nfootsteps echoed in the silence. He rapped on the great oaken\r\nfront-door. No one answered the summons. He rapped again, wondering if\r\nUncle Richard was really gone, and his heart began to grow heavy\r\nagain, as it had done upon his first disappointment at the wharf. The\r\nlonely voice of the sea stole up to his ears, and he turned about to\r\nlook. Twilight was fast settling down upon it, and already the far\r\nhorizon was hidden; but along the shore the waves shone and gleamed\r\nwhitely. Noll\'s first pang of genuine homesickness came upon him here.\r\nIt seemed as if he had not a friend this side of the wide, dark sea.\r\n\r\n  This second summons met with no better success than the first. Noll\r\nturned away, went back down the steps, and there stopped to look about\r\nhim. He discovered some straggling footprints in the sand leading\r\naround the corner of the house, and these he followed for lack of a\r\nbetter guide. They led him to a long, low projection from the main\r\nbody of the house, a kitchen it appeared to be, and here he found a\r\nwide-open door, from whence came the strains of a hymn half chanted,\r\nhalf sung. Noll rapped. The singing ceased. A slow step came across\r\nthe kitchen floor, and a voice said, "Bress us! who\'s dis?"\r\n\r\n  Noll looked up at the wrinkled black face framed by a great yellow\r\nturban, and said,--\r\n\r\n  "I\'m Noll Trafford. Didn\'t--didn\'t Uncle Richard expect me?"\r\n\r\n  Old Hagar threw up both hands crying, shrilly, "Bress de Lord! is dis\r\nNoll Trafford\'s boy?" and then stared blankly at him.\r\n\r\n  "Yes, if you mean Uncle Richard\'s brother," said Noll, still very\r\nsad-hearted; "and wasn\'t he looking for me at all?"\r\n\r\n  "Bress ye, honey!" said Hagar, recovering her senses, "he didn\'t say\r\none single word to me \'bout ye! Dun forgot it, I \'spose. But don\'t ye\r\nstan\' on dem yer steps another minnit; come right in, honey. I\'ll see\r\nMas\'r Dick dis instant."\r\n\r\n  Noll followed her into the little kitchen, where on the hearth a fire\r\nwas crackling and flashing its red flicker over the walls. He sat down\r\non a rough wooden bench by the door, wondering if his uncle could\r\nreally have forgotten that he was coming, and feeling not all\r\nlight-hearted, while Hagar clattered away to "see Mas\'r Dick." She\r\ncame back pretty quick, saying,--\r\n\r\n  "You\'s to go right in to de lib\'ry, chile, right in jes\' as soon as I\r\ngit dis yer candle lit;" and getting down on her knees she puffed away\r\nat the coals and burned splinters till she succeeded in coaxing her\r\ntallow candle to burn. She got up, came back to where Noll was\r\nsitting, and holding the light close to his face, looked down at him\r\nlong and steadily.\r\n\r\n  "Bress de Lord!" she said, stroking his curly hair, "you\'s de bery\r\npicter ob yer father. \'Pears like \'twas him I see\'d dis minnit \'fore\r\nme! Did ye drop down frum de sky, or what, chile?"\r\n\r\n  "I came down on the \'White Gull,\'" Noll answered.\r\n\r\n  "Well, now!" said Hagar; "an\' why didn\'t yer father come too?"\r\n\r\n  "Papa? Oh, why--papa is dead," said Noll, with a little quiver in his\r\nvoice which he could not possibly prevent, he was so lonely and\r\nhomesick.\r\n\r\n  Old Hagar gave a shrill wail and set her candle down.\r\n\r\n  "Now don\'t tell me dat!" she cried. "Mas\'r Oliver dead? Well, well,\r\nhoney, we dunno nuffin on dis yer Rock? De whole ob creation might cum\r\nto an\' end, an\' we nebber hear on\'t. An\' you\'s all alone now, chile?"\r\n\r\n  "Yes," said Noll, feeling at that moment as if there wore never truer\r\nwords spoken.\r\n\r\n  "An\' you\'s come down to lib wid yer Uncle Dick?"\r\n\r\n  "Yes."\r\n\r\n  "Well, bress de Lord fur dat!" said Hagar, joyfully; "couldn\'t a\r\nbetter ting happened to dat yer man, nohow. Jes\' what he wants,--a boy\r\nlike yerself, wid yer own father\'s face. An\' did Mas\'r Dick know ye\'s\r\ncomin\'?"\r\n\r\n  "Yes, he knew," said Noll; "he--he told me I\'d be welcome. Do you\r\nthink I am?"\r\n\r\n  "Why, yes, honey! What made ye ask dat? Yer Uncle Dick is a strange\r\nman, an\' ye mustn\'t mind if he don\'t say much to ye, an\'--but come\r\nright in de libr\'y, chile, fur he\'s waitin\' fur ye. Come right along;\r\nI\'s lit de lamp in dar;" and taking up her candle, she led the way.\r\n\r\n  "Don\'t yer mind dis ole hall," said Hagar, by way of apology as they\r\nentered a long, bare, chilly corridor; "nobody comes here but me, an\'\r\nI don\'t mind. It\'s only my road frum de libr\'y to de kitchen. _He_\r\nnebber comes out here."\r\n\r\n  From this hall they passed into the dining-room, where stood a\r\nsupper-table very plainly spread.\r\n\r\n  "Mas\'r Dick didn\'t eat nuffin to-night," said Hagar, glancing around\r\nas she clattered on. At one end of the dining-room they came to a door\r\nwhich the old housekeeper softly opened.\r\n\r\n  "Go right in, honey," she said to Noll, in a whisper; "he\'s dar," and\r\nthen turned away.\r\n\r\n  Richard Trafford sat by one of the great bookcases, reading. The\r\nlamplight fell full upon his worn and sorrowful face. He did not hear\r\nthe door open, did not hear Noll\'s light step, and was first conscious\r\nof the boy\'s presence when two arms were suddenly clasped about his\r\nneck, and a voice, trembling with a mixture of joy and sadness, cried,\r\n"Oh, Uncle Richard!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST EVENING.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Richard Trafford, a little startled, unclasped the boy\'s hands without\r\na word, and held him off by one arm. Full in the light he held him,\r\ngazing in his face long and keenly. Then he said, "So this is Noll!"\r\n\r\n  Oh, how coldly the words fell upon the boy\'s heart! How the stern\r\nvoice and the keen gray eyes chilled him! Not a word of welcome,\r\nafter all,--only those four chilling words. The boy\'s disappointment\r\nwas so great, his heart so lonely and homesick, that he stood with\r\ndowncast eyes, before his uncle, to hide the tears that glittered in\r\nthem, and could not answer a word. Trafford released his nephew\'s arm\r\nwith a sigh. The boy was the very counterpart of his father, of\r\nBrother Noll, he thought,--the same fair, high forehead and curling\r\nlocks, the same deep blue eyes, the same eager, impetuous manner. This\r\nresemblance touched him somewhat; he noted, also, that the boy\'s lips\r\nquivered a little, and so said, in a kindlier tone,--\r\n\r\n  "You\'re very welcome to Culm, Noll. Are you tired with the journey?"\r\n\r\n  "No--yes--some, I mean," stammered poor Noll, winking hard to keep\r\nthe tears back.\r\n\r\n  "And you\'d like some supper, I dare say," continued his uncle.\r\n\r\n  "Yes, by and by," the nephew managed to answer.\r\n\r\n  A silence fell upon them here,--long and deep,--in which the eternal\r\nmurmur of the sea stole in. Trafford\'s eyes did not move from the\r\nboy\'s face; and at last he said, taking his hand,--\r\n\r\n  "You\'re wonderfully like your father, Noll,--in more ways than one, I\r\nhope. Can a lad like you ever be contented in this old house?"\r\n\r\n  "I--I hope so, Uncle Richard," Noll replied, mocking these words,\r\nhowever, by a very despairing tone.\r\n\r\n  Trafford smiled grimly. "He\'s weary of it already," he thought; "and\r\nwho can wonder? Noll and I couldn\'t have endured it at his age, I\r\nsuppose." Then he added aloud, "If you tire of it, Noll, you shall\r\nhave liberty to return to Hastings whenever you choose. You\'re not to\r\nstay against your will, remember. You may find it lonely and dull,\r\nperhaps; if so, I leave you to go or stay, as you choose."\r\n\r\n  The tone in which this was spoken was so sad that Noll ventured to\r\nlook up into his uncle\'s face. The gray eyes had lost their stern\r\nlight, and looked very sorrowful.\r\n\r\n  "I--I will never want to go back, Uncle Richard, if you would like me\r\nto stay," he said, quickly.\r\n\r\n  "Ah, you don\'t know what you say, Noll," Trafford answered, stroking\r\nthe boy\'s hair; "it\'s a lonely place. For a boy it is horrible. Even\r\nI sometimes find it but a weary resting-place. Ah! wait and see, wait\r\nand see. I\'ve little hope you\'ll stay longer than a month."\r\n\r\n  At this Noll\'s heart gave a leap of joy. "Do you really _hope_ I\'ll\r\nstay, Uncle Richard?" he cried.\r\n\r\n  Trafford looked at the boy\'s eager, searching face for a second, then\r\nanswered, "Yes, if you can be contented." This was hardly such an\r\nanswer as Noll craved, yet it made his heart lighter. Perhaps it was\r\nonly Uncle Richard\'s way, he thought, which made it seem as though he\r\nwas not welcome. The old black housekeeper, he remembered, had warned\r\nhim not to mind it. With this thought, his heart grew somewhat more\r\ncheerful, and he began to take a brighter view of things. He noted the\r\ntall cases of books and the open organ, and unconsciously these\r\nevidences of taste and refinement made the thought of dwelling in the\r\nstone house more acceptable. If Uncle Richard would only care for him,\r\nhe thought, all the rest would not matter.\r\n\r\n  Trafford let go his hand, saying, "Go and get your supper, Noll; Hagar\r\nwill show you. Then, if you like, you can come back."\r\n\r\n  The boy took two or three steps toward obeying, then, as if\r\nremembering some duty unperformed, turned and came back.\r\n\r\n  "I had forgotten the letter,--papa\'s letter,--Uncle Richard," he said,\r\ndrawing the missive from his pocket. "Would you like it now?"\r\n\r\n  Trafford extended his hand without a word. Noll placed the precious\r\nletter therein, and walked away, looking back at the door to see that\r\nhis uncle had broken the seal. Not till the boy\'s footsteps had died\r\naway did the uncle look upon the hurriedly-traced lines which the note\r\ncontained. The letters were feebly made, hinting of the weakness of\r\nthe hand which traced them. This was what he found:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  "MY DEAR DICK,--I write this to you from my dying-bed, not knowing\r\nthat it will ever reach you, or that you are even upon the face of the\r\nearth. If ever you _do_ return,--if ever you receive this, be kind to\r\nmy poor Noll for my sake. Make him your own,--he\'ll love you,--and\r\nmake him such a man, before God, as you know I would have him.\r\n\r\n  "If he has disappeared, look him up, search for him, and cherish the\r\nboy as my precious legacy. And, dear Dick, look well to yourself. A\r\nman needs much when he lies where I am lying. We ought to have been\r\nmore to each other these past years, not living with a great gulf, as\r\nit were, atween us. This and the thought of my boy is all that weighs\r\nupon me now.\r\n\r\n  "And, dear Dick, till we meet again, farewell, farewell. O. TRAFFORD."\r\n\r\n  A sudden mist came across the reader\'s eyes, a sudden throb to his\r\nheart. Brother Noll! the blithe, warm-hearted, once precious brother!\r\nhe who had astonished all his friends by studying for a minister, and\r\nwho, with all the fervor of youth, had devoted every talent and energy\r\nto the sacred cause. How he had loved him once! How proud and happy\r\nhe had been at his success! And here were words, his last thoughts on\r\nearth, breathed from the very depths of his heart, and thrilling with\r\nlove for himself and this boy. They stirred the man\'s heart as it had\r\nnot been stirred before since that dreary afternoon when all the joy\r\nand sunshine fled out of his heart and left it so cold and bitter. He\r\nhad not realized before that Brother Noll had really ended his\r\npilgrimage, and passed out of the earth, which, to himself, was such a\r\nweary abiding-place. Now, with the last whispers of that dear heart\r\nbefore him, the whole bitter sense of his loss came upon him, and he\r\ncovered his face, sighing heavily. Back came the remembrance of the\r\nlong and happy days of boyhood, with visions of the shining meadows\r\nwhere they strayed together; with visions of careless, joyful hours,\r\nwhen they sailed and fished and hunted the woods for purple grapes and\r\nglossy nuts; with visions of those calmer days when they grew up to\r\nmanhood together,--Noll always bright and brave and loving, and a\r\ncheck upon his own wilder spirits. Now he was gone; and all the years\r\nto come could never again bring joy so deep and love so everlasting.\r\nYet, true and dear to the last, he had breathed his life out in one\r\nsweet message to himself, confiding his love and this boy to him as a\r\nprecious legacy. Trafford almost groaned when he thought of his loss.\r\nOh, what a cruel thing was Death! A fierce, pitiless robber, seeking\r\nfor the loveliest and brightest, it had lain in wait, all his life\r\nlong, despoiling him of whatever he set his heart upon, he thought,\r\nand leaving him wrecked and desolate. He had thought that no death or\r\nsorrow could ever move him again; yet here was his heart aching as\r\nwretchedly as ever. Was there no place in the wide, wide earth where\r\nsuch wretchedness could not pursue? He had hoped to find it in this\r\nwild and barren Rock; yet here sorrow had crept in, bitter and\r\npoignant as in the busy city.\r\n\r\n  Trafford rose from his chair, put away the message from out of his\r\nsight, and sat down at his organ to still the pain in his heart with\r\nthe charm of its music.\r\n\r\n  Noll had had his supper, and was sitting, sad and solitary, by Hagar\'s\r\nfire in the kitchen. He would wait a little, he thought, before going\r\nback to the library, that Uncle Richard might have time to read his\r\nletter. He wondered what its contents could be, and wished and hoped\r\nthat papa had written some message there for himself. Would Uncle\r\nRichard tell him if there were? he wondered. Then his thoughts went\r\nback over the sea to Hastings, and there came up such pictures of the\r\ndear old home there, and the faces of his school friends flocked\r\nbefore him so vividly,--Ned Thorn\'s in particular,--that he could look\r\nabout him only through tears that he strove in vain to banish.\r\n\r\n  Hagar had gone out with the candle, so the kitchen was quite dusk,\r\nsave where the fire flared scarlet light on the wall and ceiling.\r\nSuddenly, in this silence, there stole in a heavy throbbing, like the\r\nbeating of a great, muffled heart, and with a slow and solemn\r\nmovement, rolled and swept in long chains of sound through the house,\r\ntill, at last, a clear, sweet, flutelike warble broke in and ran up\r\nand down, seeming to wind in and out with the heavy undertone. Hagar\r\ncame in just then with her flaming candle, and began to rattle about\r\namong her pots and kettles.\r\n\r\n  "What is that?" Noll asked, quickly, as the strains kept stealing in\r\nabove the clatter which the old negress made. It had startled him at\r\nfirst, coming so suddenly, and corresponding so well with the gloom\r\nand mystery which seemed to fill the house.\r\n\r\n  "Bress ye, honey!" said the black old figure, stooping over the\r\ncooking utensils on the stone hearth, "don\'t ye know? Dat\'s Mas\'r Dick\r\nat his organ. He sits dar mos\' times at ebenin\', an\' \'pears like I ken\r\njes\' tell his feelin\'s by de music he makes. Sometimes I ken hear it\r\njes\' as sad as nuffin ye ken think ob, an\' sometimes it\'s singin\' as\r\nef \'twas \'live and \'joicin.\' It dun make ye homesick?" queried Hagar,\r\ndropping her dishcloth and looking up into the boy\'s face.\r\n\r\n  "No," Noll answered, with a sigh, "\'tisn\'t the music. It will all be\r\ngone in the morning, I guess," and tried to look his cheeriest.\r\n\r\n  "You\'s tired out, chile," said Hagar, with ready sympathy; "better go\r\nto bed. I\'s been makin\' ye one in de room jes\' side o\' Mas\'r Dick\'s.\r\nBes\' room in de whole house!"\r\n\r\n  The music had ceased, and Noll left his seat and went groping his way\r\nalong the dark, echoing hall, through the dimly-lighted dining-room to\r\nthe library-door. Entering, he found his uncle still seated before the\r\norgan, but with his head bent forward upon the music-rack, and\r\napparently lost in deep thought, for he did not look up till Noll\r\nstood beside him. Trafford made a faint attempt to smile, and asked,--\r\n\r\n  "Could Hagar find you anything fit to eat? We can\'t live here as at\r\nHastings. The sea brings us our food."\r\n\r\n  Noll said something about not being hungry, and presently Trafford\r\nasked, with the stem and gloomy look upon his face,--\r\n\r\n  "Did you know that Brother Noll, your father, did a very unwise thing\r\nwhen he put you into my hands?"\r\n\r\n  Noll started at the strangeness of the question, and the bright color\r\ncame into his face.\r\n\r\n  "Do you mean that papa did wrong?" he asked, quickly.\r\n\r\n  "Yes, so far as your good is concerned. I can be no companion for you.\r\nYou would have got more good anywhere else than here."\r\n\r\n  "Don\'t say that, Uncle Richard!" Noll pleaded.\r\n\r\n  "Why not?" Trafford queried, not unkindly; "it is the truth."\r\n\r\n  "Papa said that you--you--" There was such a choking in Noll\'s throat\r\nthat he could get no further, and stopped, looking very much\r\ndistressed. Trafford took the boy\'s hand in his own.\r\n\r\n  "My boy," he said, huskily, calling him by that title for the first\r\ntime, "I\'m but a poor wreck at best. I can teach you no good, and God\r\nknows I wouldn\'t be the means of putting a shadow of evil in your\r\nheart. Your father says, \'Make him such a man, before God, as you know\r\nI would have him.\' He asked too much, Noll. Why, boy, I can\'t rule\r\nmyself." Noll said not a word. Uncle Richard was getting to be more of\r\na mystery to him than Culm Rock had been. "And," continued Trafford,\r\n"we will leave the matter thus: you shall be at liberty, after the\r\nfirst month, to go or stay, as you like. If you go, it shall be to\r\nstay away forever; if you stay, it shall be at your own risk. Do you\r\nunderstand?"\r\n\r\n  "Yes, Uncle Richard."\r\n\r\n  Trafford saw the boy\'s lips quiver again, and turned quickly away; the\r\nface was so much like his dead brother\'s. Noll came to him pretty\r\nsoon, said "Good-night," and went away. Hagar guided the boy up to his\r\nroom, bidding him good-night with many assurances that "\'tw\'u\'d be\r\npleasanter to-morrow, \'nough sight!" and left him to himself. The\r\nstars shone brightly over the sea. Noll could not read his Bible\r\nverses that night, for the familiar, precious gift of mamma was\r\nlocked in the trunk away round the shore at Culm; but he prayed with\r\nall the stronger longing for the Saviour\'s pity and help; and then\r\nfrom his bed by one of the great windows, lay listening to the moaning\r\nof the tide below, which seemed the saddest, lonesomest sound he had\r\never heard. And his heart ached too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCULM SIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When Noll awoke the next morning, the sun was shining brightly in. It\r\nwas not until after some long minutes of yawning and rubbing his eyes,\r\nthat he comprehended where he was; then, with some chills of\r\ndisappointment, he remembered, and bounded up to look out the window.\r\nThe sea lay rippling, cool and fresh below. Here and there faint\r\ntrails of mist floated and hovered over the waves, but the breeze was\r\nfast tearing and blowing them away. With a feeling of delight, he saw\r\non the far horizon-line the white film of shadowy sails. It showed\r\nthat there was life and stir somewhere, he thought, and it was\r\npleasant to think of them as bound for far-off Hastings. Then he\r\nremembered Skipper Ben and the "White Gull," and wondered when he\r\nwould return; and then Mr. Gray\'s note had not been written, he\r\nrecollected.\r\n\r\n  "Well," thought Noll, "I\'ll find time for it to-day, I guess. I wonder\r\nif my trunks will come this morning? and--When am I to begin my\r\nstudies, and who am I to recite to?" This last thought had not entered\r\nhis head before. There was evidently not a school of any kind upon\r\nCulm Rock, and of course Uncle Richard was the only person capable of\r\nteaching him anything. "I wonder if he will offer to teach me?" Noll\r\nthought in perplexity, "or shall I have to ask him? I can\'t do that!\r\nhe\'s so cold and stern; and besides, I don\'t believe he would like the\r\ntrouble. I wonder if I am to grow up like those dull Culm people?" He\r\ndressed himself, thinking busily enough of a dozen troublesome matters\r\nwhich had already sprung up to puzzle him, and with these in his head,\r\nwent down-stairs. He found the dining-room at last, after getting into\r\nthree or four empty, unoccupied rooms, and there found Hagar putting\r\nthe last dishes upon the breakfast-table.\r\n\r\n  "You\'s lookin\' brighter, honey," said she, gleefully. "Didn\'t dis yer\r\nole woman tell ye so? Ki! I knowed how \'tw\'u\'d be las\' night."\r\n\r\n  "It _does_ seem pleasanter," Noll admitted; "and where\'s Uncle\r\nRichard?"\r\n\r\n  "Mas\'r Dick? He\'s in de libr\'y; goin\' to call him dis minnit.\r\nBreakfas\' dun waitin\' for ye both, honey; an\', bress de Lord! how much\r\nye looks like yer father dis mornin\'!" and Hagar caressed the boy\'s\r\nhair with her skinny old hands, muttering, as she gazed affectionately\r\nin his face, "You\'s de bery picter ob him,--de bery picter!"\r\n\r\n  So Richard Trafford thought as he answered the old housekeeper\'s call\r\nand entered the dining-room where his nephew was waiting with a cheery\r\n"Good-morning, Uncle Richard." The boy\'s sunshiny face, somehow, made\r\nthe great room brighter, Trafford thought, and Hagar bustled about and\r\npoured the coffee with a lighter heart than she had had since leaving\r\nher people at Hastings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Good morning, Uncle Richard," Page 92.]\r\n\r\n  "Jes\' what\'s been lackin\' de whole time!" she thought to herself;\r\n"Mas\'r Dick wants somethin\' he ken love and talk to. \'Pears like\r\ndar\'ll be a change in dis yer ole house afore long, de Lord willin\'."\r\nIt was such a long time since the old negress had seen a young face,\r\nor heard the pleasant accents of a young voice, that she made various\r\npretexts for lingering in the room while the two sat at the table, and\r\nthough it was for the most part a silent meal, yet it was a wonderful\r\npleasure to see Noll eat, Hagar thought. And when the two had left the\r\ntable and gone to the library, she soliloquized, "Nebber thought I\'d\r\nsee a day like dis yer, agen! Wonder what Mas\'r Dick t\'inks o\' de boy?\r\nBress de chile! if mas\'r don\'t take to him, \'pears like he\'ll nebber\r\ntake to nuffin. Be like habbin\' poor Mas\'r Noll\'s face afore him de\r\nwhole time, an\' ef he ken stan\' _dat_, athought lubbin\' him, I\'s\r\n\'feard he\'s dun got colder\'n a stone, de whole ob him. You jes\' wait\r\nan\' see, Hagar!"\r\n\r\n  Noll followed his uncle from the breakfast-table into the library,\r\nhoping that he would at once say something about his books or studies,\r\nor at least hint what plans he had made concerning himself. It would\r\nbe a great deal pleasanter, Noll thought, to have Uncle Richard\r\ndispose of him, even in a stern, cold way, than to do nothing at all\r\nwith him and remain indifferent as to whether he studied or grew up in\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\n  But Trafford had relapsed into one of his gloomy, absent moods, and\r\ntook up a book as soon as he reached the library, without a look or\r\nword for Noll. The boy stood by one of the great windows and looked\r\nout on the sea, striving to drown his disappointment by thinking of\r\nother matters. When he had tired of this, and found that\r\ndisappointment was long-lived, and would not be drowned, he loitered\r\nby the bookcases, reading the titles, now and then peering into a\r\nvolume and looking over its top at his uncle, and thinking him a very\r\ncold or else a very forgetful man. When he had made the tour of the\r\nroom several times, and was about to go out in despair, Trafford\r\nlooked up.\r\n\r\n  "Noll, did you wish to speak to me?" he asked, abruptly.\r\n\r\n  The question came upon Noll unawares.\r\n\r\n  "Yes, if--if you were not too--too busy," he stammered. "I thought--I\r\nhoped you would say something about my books--my studies, I mean,\r\nUncle Richard."\r\n\r\n  "What about them?"\r\n\r\n  "Why, whether I were to study with you, or by myself, or how; and\r\nwhether I am to begin now, or wait a while," said Noll, wishing that\r\nhis uncle would look less keenly at him.\r\n\r\n  Trafford leaned his head upon his hand and reflected a little. At last\r\nhe said,--\r\n\r\n  "You will wait, Noll, till your month is up. There would be no use in\r\nbeginning studies which, perchance, may end in so short a time. If, at\r\nthe end of four weeks, you conclude to stay, then we will talk about\r\nstudy. Till then, you will wait."\r\n\r\n  Noll\'s blue eyes said, as plainly as eyes could, "Don\'t mention that\r\nmonth again, Uncle Richard!" but his tongue was silent, and he\r\nacquiesced in this decision by a nod of his head.\r\n\r\n  "You can fill up the time," continued his uncle, "as you like. You had\r\nbest make yourself acquainted with the Rock before you decide to stay\r\nhere. You will hardly explore it all in one day, I think;" and with\r\nthis Trafford turned again to his book.\r\n\r\n  Noll found his hat and went out, determined to keep a brave heart if\r\nUncle Richard _was_ cold and gloomy. If there was no other way, he\r\nwould _make_ him love him, he thought, though how that was to be done\r\nhe had, as yet, but a very slight idea. He went through the\r\ndining-room, and from thence found his way to the broad front piazza\r\nwhich faced the sea, and where, the previous evening, he had stood so\r\nlonely and homesick. Everything looked much cheerier to him now, and\r\nhe ran down the sand, in front of the house, to the water\'s edge,\r\nresolved to see the bright side of everything which pertained to gray,\r\nbarren Culm. There were stranded shells and bright-hued weeds on the\r\nwet, glittering sand, which made Noll\'s eyes sparkle with delight.\r\n\r\n  "Wouldn\'t Ned\'s eyes open to see these!" he thought, "and wouldn\'t the\r\ndear old fellow like some for his museum! I\'ll gather a whole box full\r\nand send them up by the skipper some day."\r\n\r\n  Thinking of the skipper made Noll remember his trunks, and he wondered\r\nif the "White Gull" had continued her voyage farther down the shore.\r\n\r\n  "There\'s a whole month to explore and pick up shells in," he said to\r\nhimself, "and I\'ll take this forenoon to go around to the landing and\r\nsee the skipper, if he\'s there."\r\n\r\n  With this thought, he started off, hoping to find the "Gull" still\r\nlying off the little wharf. The skipper seemed almost like an old\r\nfriend, already; and, however rough he might be, he came from\r\nHastings, and this fact alone made the boy long for a sight of his\r\nface. So he hastened along the sand, toward Culm, with an eye and ear\r\nfor everything which he passed. Great boulders, all green and fringed\r\nwith sea-weed, were strewn everywhere,--in the yellow sand of the\r\nbeach, in the line of the tide and waves which whitened themselves to\r\nfoam, and murmured hoarsely against them. In some places the great\r\nmass of the rock came down so near the water\'s edge that only a\r\nslender path of pebbles was left between it and the waves. In high\r\ntide, Noll thought, this narrow way must be quite covered, and he\r\nwondered why the sea did not carry it quite away. But in other places\r\nthe beach was broad and smooth, quite wide enough for many horsemen to\r\nride abreast. This morning the sea was peaceful and calm. Neither did\r\nit look so vast and illimitable as on the previous night. The tide was\r\ngoing out, stranding great quantities of glittering weeds and all\r\nsorts of curious objects, the sight of which made Noll\'s heart glad;\r\nbut, without stopping to examine or preserve them, he hastened on,\r\nhoping to soon catch sight of the "Gull." But in this he was\r\ndisappointed. No sooner had he passed the curve of the shore than he\r\nsaw that the skipper and his craft were gone. There were his trunks to\r\nsee to, however; so he kept on, though at a slower pace, wondering if\r\nthose dull-looking fishermen could tell him when the "Gull" would\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n  Not half so fair or comely did the dozen houses look as in the gold of\r\nsunset. Such racked, weather-beaten dwellings Noll had never seen\r\nbefore. It was a mystery how they could ever stand in a high gale. Not\r\na solitary vestige of anything green was there to enliven the\r\nbarrenness. Long lines of seine were stretched upon stakes, and\r\ndangled from the sides of boulders upon the shore. In the sand some\r\ndirty-faced children were playing, who got up and ran away at his\r\napproach. A little farther on he came upon two fishermen dividing a\r\nbasket of fish. They looked up, stared, and nodded respectfully.\r\n\r\n  "When did the skipper go?" Noll asked, pausing.\r\n\r\n  "Ben, ye mean?" asked one of the men, suspending his labor to take a\r\nmore leisurely survey of the questioner.\r\n\r\n  "Yes, Ben Tate," said Noll.\r\n\r\n  "Afore sunrise," said the other. "Did ye want the skipper, lad?"\r\n\r\n  "No, not particularly. When is he going to stop here again?"\r\n\r\n  "Ben? Why, he comes Mondays and Thursdays, he does," said the\r\nfisherman; "ye\'ll find him here day after to-morrow, lad,--early, too,\r\nmos\' like."\r\n\r\n  "Can you tell me where he left my trunks?" queried Noll.\r\n\r\n  At this question, the men looked perplexed. "Do ye mean boxes like?"\r\nthey asked, after a time.\r\n\r\n  Noll was astonished at this lack of knowledge, but managed to explain\r\nto the two what he meant.\r\n\r\n  "Ye\'d best go up to Dirk Sharp\'s," said one; "the skipper leaves much\r\nwith Dirk, he does, an\' ye\'ll be like to find \'em there."\r\n\r\n  "Back o\' the wharf, lad,--back o\' the wharf Dirk lives," the other\r\ncalled to Noll, as he walked away.\r\n\r\n  Dirk Sharp\'s house was rather smarter than the others,--at least, it\r\nwas in better repair; but the look which Noll caught of its interior,\r\nas he stood rapping by the open door, sufficed to destroy any\r\nanticipations of industry or thriftiness which he might have formed\r\nfrom the dwelling\'s exterior. Dirk was a great broad-shouldered,\r\nslouching fellow, with a general air of shiftlessness about him. At\r\nNoll\'s summons, he came lounging out of an inner room, and, catching\r\nsight of the boy, said,--\r\n\r\n  "Lookin\' for yer trunks, lad? The skipper said ye was to hev \'em las\'\r\nnight, shore; but ye see," pulling up his sleeve, "as how I got a cut\r\nwhat\'s hindered," displaying a long, bloody wound upon his arm. "Ye\r\nsh\'u\'d ha\' had \'em, lad, but for that, as the skipper said. But ef ye\r\nken wait till the men get back from their seinin\'--Ho! there be Bob\r\nan\' Darby now," he exclaimed, as he spied the two whom Noll had just\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n  "Ahoy there, lads! here be a job fur ye!" he cried to the fishermen.\r\n\r\n  The two left their work and came up to Dirk.\r\n\r\n  "Here be two trunks to go \'roun\' to the stone house fur this lad,"\r\nsaid he. "Ef ye\'ll shoulder \'em roun\' the shore, yer welcome to what\r\nthe skipper left fur\'t. What ye say, lads?"\r\n\r\n  "We\'ll do\'t fur ye, Dirk, seein\' yer cut," said the one who was called\r\nDarby. "Where be the boxes, man?"\r\n\r\n  Dirk led them into the inner room, from whence they presently\r\nemerged, each with a trunk on his shoulder, and, bending with their\r\nburdens, started up the shore.\r\n\r\n  Noll followed slowly after, wondering why they did not use their boat,\r\ninstead of enduring such back-breaking toil. It struck him that he had\r\nnever seen such dull, apathetic faces as these Culm people had. Such\r\nutter shiftlessness as everything about the cluster of tumble-downs\r\nbetokened he had never imagined. Perhaps all this dreariness and\r\ndesolation made itself more keenly felt because the boy was just from\r\nthe city, which teemed with life and bustle and energy. In its poorest\r\nquarter he had never seen such a lack of tidiness as the interior of\r\nDirk Sharp\'s house presented. He followed the slowly-plodding\r\ntrunk-bearers up the yellow sand, wondering if there was such another\r\nwretched, desolate, and forlorn place as Culm Rock in the whole wide\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nHOW THE MONTH WAS SPENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  They were a long time in getting to the stone house. Before they\r\npassed the curve of the shore, the sun was well up in the sky and beat\r\ndown with fervid rays upon the sweating, toiling fishermen. Noll\r\nrejoiced when the trunks were safely landed in his room at the top of\r\nthe stairs, and the men had taken their departure, each with a piece\r\nof silver in addition to the skipper\'s fee. It seemed to him that\r\nthere was no bright side to the life over in those wretched Culm huts.\r\nIf there was, he could not see it. It puzzled and perplexed him to\r\nimagine how human beings could live in such ignorance and apathy of\r\nall that was transpiring about them; and the sights which he had seen\r\nin the miserable, tumbledown village left a very disagreeable feeling\r\nin his heart. Somehow, his hitherto blithe spirits were dampened by\r\nthis morning\'s walk, and he thought the great bare Rock would be a\r\ngreat deal more endurable if the fish-huts and their inmates were only\r\noff it. True, it would be much lonelier, but that was far more\r\nendurable than the sight of such shiftlessness and ignorance. He\r\nwondered if Uncle Richard ever went among them, and whether he really\r\nknew what a degraded people they had got to be. If he did know, Noll\r\nthought, it was very strange that he did not try to lift them up,\r\nteach them something, or, at least, have a school opened for the\r\nchildren. Papa, he thought, would have done something for them long\r\nago. There would have been a little schoolhouse and a teacher. A new\r\nwharf, he was sure, would have taken the place of the rickety old\r\nthing; and by degrees the women would have learned thrift and\r\nneatness, and the men energy and industry. To be sure, it seemed a\r\ngreat deal to do for such dull, apathetic people, who seemed not to\r\nhave a particle of energy and ambition about them; but papa, he\r\nthought, could have done it, and _would_ have done it, had he lived\r\nhere as long as Uncle Richard. He remembered a little sea-town, where\r\nthey had lived before dwelling in Hastings, how wretched and dirty and\r\nignorant the fishermen were, and what a great change for the better\r\ncame over the place through his father\'s efforts.\r\n\r\n  But now papa was gone, and Uncle Richard? The man was so much of a\r\nmystery to Noll, as yet, that he did not know whether there were any\r\nhopes of his setting himself to the task of lifting the Culm people\r\nout of their slough of wretchedness; but he hoped that his uncle would\r\nsee and realize what needed to be done before another year had worn\r\naway. And if he did not? Why, then they would have to go on in their\r\nold way, he thought. He wished that he might do something toward the\r\nwork; but, then, how could he? He had no money, and no means of\r\ngetting any, and he was not fifteen.\r\n\r\n  Noll put away, or tried to do so, all thoughts of the Culm people and\r\ntheir life, and went to writing the note which Skipper Ben was to\r\ncarry to Mr. Gray on his return to Hastings. When it was finished, he\r\nunlocked his trunk, took a look at the thumbed, worn little Bible\r\nwhich had been mamma\'s; at the familiar covers of his school-books,\r\nwhich brought up a hundred visions of pleasant, happy hours in the\r\ngreat, buzzing schoolroom,--wondered if he should ever know such\r\njoyful moments again,--it seemed quite an impossibility, now,--and\r\ntook up, one by one, the keepsakes and knick-knacks which his boy\r\nfriends had given him on his departure. There was the new ball which\r\nSam Scott had given him,--how Sam _did_ love ball-playing!--and which\r\nwas now not of the least possible use to him. There was a great bundle\r\nof fish-hooks which Archie Phillips had bestowed upon him, more in fun\r\nthan in earnest, but which Noll had treasured because Archie was his\r\nseat-mate. Then there were all sorts of relics and mementos, such as\r\nboys set their hearts upon,--bits of carved wood, favorite drawing\r\npencils, a purple amethyst, which Johnny Moore, whose father had been\r\nin India, had given him, and, best of all, there was Ned Thorn\'s dear,\r\nmerry face beaming upon him from out the little ebony frame in which\r\nNed\'s own hands had placed it the night before his departure.\r\n\r\n  Looking at this face, and gazing upon these mementos of his friends,\r\ndid not serve to make Noll at all more contented with Culm Rock and\r\nthe prospect before him, and, being presently made aware of this by\r\nthe heaviness which began to settle upon his heart, he closed the\r\ntrunks in great haste, and ran off.\r\n\r\n  The day passed quickly enough, even for Noll, and was only the first\r\nof many happy ones spent by the shore and on the rocks. The boy had a\r\ntaste for treasuring curiosities, and in the wonderful wealth of weed\r\nand shell which the sea was continually throwing upon the sand, his\r\nlove of collecting and preserving was gratified. Every return of the\r\ntide was a great sweeping in of the wonders and beauties of the sea to\r\nadd to his stores. There was always something new and strange to\r\nexcite his delight and admiration. Then, too, there were long hours\r\nspent in climbing the rocks, till all its cliffs and hollows began to\r\ngrow familiar to the boy. He climbed to Wind Cliff, and from its top\r\nlooked down on the Culm houses on the sand, and into the gulls\' nests\r\nfar below in the crevices of the rock, and enjoyed their wild wheeling\r\nand screaming about him as he stood there. From this high look-out he\r\noften stood looking upon such sunsets as he had never seen before.\r\nHigh up toward the zenith the sun shot its great banners of flame as\r\nit dipped in the sea, and made the vast expanse glow and glitter. In\r\nthe east the sails flitted along the purple line of the horizon, and\r\ndown in the dusk shadow of the Rock he could see the grim stone house\r\nand the blue thread of smoke from Hagar\'s kitchen chimney. Sometimes\r\nhe made use of Archie Phillips\' gift, and caught fish off the rocks,\r\nmuch to the advantage of the old housekeeper\'s dinner-table.\r\n\r\n  One week after another passed, and still there seemed plenty of\r\nvariety and amusement for every day. In one of his rambles, Noll came\r\nupon a little cluster of graves, with the rudest of monuments to mark\r\nthem,--most of them were rough head-boards in which the sleeper\'s name\r\nwas cut or scratched,--and this sight of such poor, uncared-for\r\nresting-places in the sand made him sad and thoughtful for more than\r\none day. What if he were to die and be buried there, too? he surmised.\r\nThe thought chilled him. True, he knew that heaven beyond was just as\r\nbright and fair for all that the graves were so forlorn and dreary;\r\nbut the thought of lying far from all his friends, on bare and lonely\r\nCulm Rock, oppressed him till new sights and adventures had somewhat\r\neffaced the remembrance of the sight from his mind. Nearly one day was\r\nspent in the pine woods, whose fragrance and sombre light, and the\r\ndeep hush reigning within, both awed and delighted him. Then there\r\nwere days of storm and mist which could only be spent in his chamber\r\nor in the library.\r\n\r\n  Uncle Richard was generally as silent and stern as ever, and sometimes\r\nchilled the boy\'s heart with his coldness, and sometimes touched it by\r\nhis prolonged and heavy sadness. Noll found more ways than one to make\r\nhis affection known, and even when his uncle was stern almost to\r\nharshness, found some excuse for his unkindness in his warm heart,\r\nthinking that all would come right at last, and Uncle Richard lose his\r\ncoldness and be as kind and regardful as he could wish. Only once did\r\nhe lose his temper and rebel, and for this Noll repented heartily as\r\nsoon as it was done. He went into the library one afternoon and asked\r\npermission to go around to Culm and climb up to the gulls\' nests on\r\nWind Cliff. He had explored every nook of the Rock, and this was a\r\npleasure which he had reserved till the last, and, though not quite\r\nconfident of being successful in an attempt to scale the precipitous\r\ncliff, yet he was eager and anxious enough to make the trial. Trafford\r\nwas in one of his gloomiest moods, and replied, sternly,--\r\n\r\n  "You would like to break your neck, I suppose, sir, and give me the\r\npleasure of seeing you brought home bruised and bleeding! No, you\r\nshall not go near Wind Cliff!"\r\n\r\n  The angry color came into Noll\'s face in an instant. "I believe it\r\n_would_ be a pleasure for you to see me brought home with a broken\r\nneck!" he cried, impetuously; "and oh, I wish I were back in Hastings,\r\nwhere somebody cared for me!" And with this Noll hurried out of the\r\nlibrary, slamming the door behind him.\r\n\r\n  Trafford heard these words with astonishment; then, as his nephew\'s\r\nfootsteps died away along the hall, he covered his face and sighed\r\nheavily.\r\n\r\n  "Ah," he thought, "I did it for his good; yet--the boy distrusts me.\r\nHe can\'t know what I would be to him if I could; how can he? He thinks\r\nme cold and unloving, and--well, he has reason to."\r\n\r\n  Hardly had ten minutes elapsed before the door swung softly open, and\r\nNoll re-entered. Trafford did not look up, did not hear him, in fact,\r\nand presently was startled by a voice saying, brokenly,--\r\n\r\n  "Uncle Richard!"\r\n\r\n  Then he looked up. Noll stood before him with downcast eyes and a\r\ntrembling lip.\r\n\r\n  "Well?" said Trafford, speaking neither with coldness nor yet with\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\n  "I--I--I didn\'t mean what I said a few minutes ago, Uncle Richard,"\r\nsaid Noll, chokingly; "there was not a word of truth in it, and I\r\noughtn\'t to have said such a thing."\r\n\r\n  A deep silence followed, broken at last by another "Well?" from\r\nTrafford\'s lips.\r\n\r\n  "Will you forgive me, Uncle Richard? I was angry then, and I _don\'t_\r\nwish I was back at Hastings," said Noll, grieved, and fearful lest he\r\nhad only put a wider gulf between himself and his uncle.\r\n\r\n  Trafford was silent so long that the boy ventured to raise his eyes.\r\nTo his surprise and astonishment, his uncle was regarding him with\r\neyes that were neither cold nor stern, but almost tender and yearning.\r\n\r\n  "Oh! do you forgive me?" Noll cried, taking hope.\r\n\r\n  Trafford laid his hand on his nephew\'s fair, curly hair, stroking it\r\ngently as he had once before done on the boy\'s arrival.\r\n\r\n  "You need not ask that, Noll," he said. "Go where you will,--I can\r\ntrust you."\r\n\r\n  "But I\'ll not go to Wind Cliff?" said Noll, "and I wish--you don\'t\r\nknow how much, Uncle Richard!--that I could take back those words."\r\n\r\n  "There is no need," said his uncle. "Go where you will."\r\n\r\n  Noll took his departure, more confident than ever that under Uncle\r\nRichard\'s coldness and seeming indifference there lurked love and\r\nregard for himself, and, true to his word, gave up all idea of\r\nascending the cliff.\r\n\r\n  As for Trafford, though outwardly stern and cold as ever, his heart\r\nwent out to the boy more yearningly after that. The month was drawing\r\nnear its close, and in spite of himself, he could not regard the\r\napproaching day on which Noll\'s decision was to be made without some\r\nforebodings. Yet, lest the boy should be influenced by perceiving that\r\nhis uncle wished his presence, Trafford was gloomier and more\r\nforbidding than ever, those last days. The boy should be perfectly\r\nfree to make his choice, he thought; he would use no influence to\r\nchange or bias his decision in any manner.\r\n\r\n  "Everything I have set my heart upon has been snatched away by death,"\r\nhe said to himself; "Noll shall stay only because it is his choice.\r\nNever will I, by look or voice, influence him to share my life and\r\nloneliness. If he stays, and I love him as my own, just so surely will\r\ndeath snatch him away."\r\n\r\n  But that the boy was a great comfort and delight to him he could not\r\nbut confess to himself. He was surprised to find how, in those few\r\nshort weeks, his cheery presence had won upon his heart. He watched\r\nhim from the window as he walked on the sand below, searching for sea\r\ntreasures, and could not endure the thought of having the boyish\r\nfigure gone forever out of his sight. Neither could he think of the\r\nloneliness and silence which would settle down upon the old house\r\nwhen the gladsome voice and quick footsteps were gone, without a sigh.\r\nNow it was a great pleasure to go out to the tea-table at evening and\r\nfind Noll, fresh and ruddy from his ramble on the shore and rocks,\r\nawaiting him one side the table with his grave and yet merry face. How\r\nwould it be when he was gone? It were a great deal better, Trafford\r\nthought, that the boy had never come to brighten the old house with\r\nsunshine for a brief space, if now he went and left it darker and\r\ngloomier than before. And would he go? He should be left to choose for\r\nhimself, the uncle thought, though the decision proved an unfavorable\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nNOLL\'S DECISION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Noll stayed. The day on which the decision was to be made he came into\r\nthe library, where Trafford sat, saying, gravely, "Uncle Richard,\r\nto-day I was to choose, you know; and I would rather stay at Culm Rock\r\nand be your boy than to go back. May I?"\r\n\r\n  "May you?" exclaimed Trafford, on the impulse of the moment, while\r\neven his heavy heart was glad. "How can you ask that? Oh, Noll! do\r\nyou know what you are doing?"\r\n\r\n  "To be sure, Uncle Richard! I\'m going to stay with you," replied Noll,\r\nwithout any shadow of regret in his eyes.\r\n\r\n  "Ah, boy, I fear you will rue it," said his uncle, shaking his head\r\nmournfully; "remember, whatever befalls, that I did not bid you\r\nstay,--it was at your own risk."\r\n\r\n  "Why, what do you mean?" Noll asked, with a puzzled face,--"what is to\r\nbefall me, Uncle Richard?"\r\n\r\n  "I know not,--I know not," Trafford answered; "there may be nothing to\r\nharm you; yet death ever snatches all that is dear to me, and I\r\ntremble for you, my boy."\r\n\r\n  Noll looked grave and puzzled still. "I don\'t understand, Uncle\r\nRichard," he said.\r\n\r\n  "No; how can you?" his uncle said, after a pause. "To _you_, death is\r\nonly God\'s hand; to me, it--oh, Noll, I cannot tell you what it is! I\r\ndon\'t wish to shock you, boy, but I\'m a long way from where your\r\nfather was when he penned me that calm note,--lying in the very arms\r\nof death at the moment." Noll was silent. "Yes," continued Trafford,\r\n"for me there is no brightness beyond the depths of the grave. All is\r\ndark,--dark! and so many of my friends have vanished in it,--so many\r\nhave been lost to me there! Ah, my hope was all wrecked long ago!"\r\n\r\n  Noll looked up quickly, with, "Papa lost to you, to me, Uncle Richard?\r\nOh, that is not true at all! Papa _lost_ to us?"\r\n\r\n  "Not to you, not to you, Noll, thank God!" Trafford replied; "but to\r\nme,--yes! His faith he left to you,--I can see, I feel it; but I have\r\nnone."\r\n\r\n  Noll looked up to the sad-eyed, gloomy man, and fathomed the mystery\r\nof his sorrow at once. Who would not be forever sad with nothing\r\nbeyond the grave but blank and darkness in which loved hearts were\r\nalway vanishing?\r\n\r\n  "Oh, Uncle Richard," said he, "I\'m sorry for you!"\r\n\r\n  "I don\'t deserve it," Trafford said, with unusual tenderness. "How can\r\nyou love such a man as myself? Oh, my boy, I\'ve been harsh with you,\r\nand cold and stern; go where you\'ll find some one that can care for\r\nyou better than I!"\r\n\r\n  But Noll\'s face suddenly grew bright. "I wouldn\'t do that," he said,\r\nearnestly,--"never, Uncle Richard! Papa said I was to live with you\r\nand love you, and I _will_, unless you wish me to go. And if you do\r\nnot, don\'t tell me to leave you again!"\r\n\r\n  "I will not, Noll," Trafford said.\r\n\r\n  So it was all settled, at last, and Noll\'s heart--in spite of Uncle\r\nRichard\'s gloominess--was light and glad. He would stay and see if the\r\nman\'s sorrow and wretchedness could not be driven away, he thought;\r\nperhaps--who could tell?--he would lose his sternness, and become kind\r\nand regardful, and follow in the path which papa had trod. It all\r\nseemed very doubtful now, it was true, but such a thing _might_ be,\r\nafter a time.\r\n\r\n  "Yes," said Noll, as he thought of these things, "I would much rather\r\nstay with you, Uncle Richard--always. And now shall we talk about\r\nstudies?"\r\n\r\n  "True, we were to consider that matter," said his uncle; "yet I had\r\nlittle hope that you would stay, then. What do you study, Noll?"\r\n\r\n  "At Hastings I had arithmetic and geography and Latin. Then with papa\r\nI studied history, and a little--a very little, Uncle Richard--in\r\nmineralogy,--he liked that so, you know."\r\n\r\n  "And what do you propose to do here?" asked his uncle.\r\n\r\n  "I would like to do just the same," said Noll, "and keep up with my\r\nclass, perhaps."\r\n\r\n  "He has still some thoughts of returning?" Trafford wondered; then\r\nsaid aloud, "Well, it shall be as you like. And when will you\r\ncommence?"\r\n\r\n  "At once, if you please, Uncle Richard. I\'ve had such a long vacation\r\nthat it will seem good to get back to books once more; they\'re all\r\nwaiting for me up-stairs. Shall I get them?"\r\n\r\n  Noll bounded away as his uncle nodded assent, and went up-stairs with\r\na merry whistle. Trafford listened to the quick footsteps and the\r\nlight-hearted music, and really rejoiced that they were not to flee\r\nand leave the old house desolate. It would be a brighter dwelling than\r\nit had been till--till death came, he thought. And if he could not\r\nteach the boy as Brother Noll had desired him to do, yet he would see\r\nthat in the matter of books and study he had every advantage. So, when\r\nthe boy came down with his arms full of books, he set himself to his\r\ntask with an earnestness that pleased Noll wonderfully.\r\n\r\n  "Uncle Richard means that I shall progress," he thought; "and oh, I\r\n_do_ hope I can keep up with Ned and the rest!"\r\n\r\n  Trafford found his nephew an apt scholar. He had expected that,\r\nhowever, for the boy came of a book-loving race. Very likely, had the\r\npupil proved but a dull one, he would sometimes have wearied of his\r\ntask of hearing the recitations every day; but as it was, he found a\r\npositive pleasure in his capacity as Noll\'s instructor, and generally\r\na relief from his gloominess.\r\n\r\n  Noll\'s study-hours were at his own discretion; the recitations came in\r\nthe afternoon, and after four the boy had the remainder of the day to\r\nspend as he liked. Sometimes the shore claimed him, sometimes the\r\nrocks. Then there were excursions, in company with old Hagar, to the\r\nsolitude of the pines, after cones and dry, resinous branches for the\r\nkitchen fire, which never seemed to burn well unless the old\r\nhousekeeper had an abundance of this kindling material.\r\n\r\n  "Nuffin like dem yer pine cones fur winter mornin\'s," Hagar always\r\nsaid; and many were the visits which she and "Mas\'r Noll" paid to the\r\nwoods, returning with laden baskets.\r\n\r\n  Somehow, after a time, the boy found more delight in these simple\r\npleasures than at first. Once, with all his friends about him, he\r\nwould have found no entertainment in a journey into the forest after\r\ncones,--there were other delights in abundance, then; but now, forced\r\nto get all his enjoyment out of the simplest, humblest events, this\r\nwork of gathering winter fuel grew to be a positive pleasure, after\r\nthe recitations were over, and the short October days drawing to a\r\nclose. Then, too, the winter stores were being brought down from\r\nHastings on the "Gull," and Skipper Ben and his crew came often to the\r\nstone house, to break the monotony of days in some little manner.\r\n\r\n  "Yer \'live an\' hearty yet, lad!" was his greeting as he came around in\r\nthe "Gull\'s" boat with a variety of provisions for winter use, one\r\ncloudy afternoon. "Well, I mus\' say I didn\'t think to find ye so?\r\nLonesome any? Goin\' to let me carry ye back to Hastings afore the\r\n\'Gull\' stops runnin\'?"\r\n\r\n  "No," said Noll, bravely, "I\'m going to stay, skipper."\r\n\r\n  "Ye\'ll find the weather a tough un, bime-by," drawled Mr. Snape, as he\r\nrolled a flour-barrel up the sand.\r\n\r\n  "Yes," said the skipper, "winters are mos\'ly hard uns down here. An\'\r\nwhat ye goin\' to do when the \'Gull\' stops cruisin\' fur the season, an\'\r\nye can\'t get a word frum the city?"\r\n\r\n  This was a contingency for which Noll had made no calculation. Not\r\nhear a word from Hastings for a whole long winter?\r\n\r\n  "Well," he said at last, "that isn\'t pleasant to think of, but I\'ll\r\nmanage somehow, skipper. And you must bring me a great packet of\r\nletters to last till the \'Gull\' commences her trips again."\r\n\r\n  "Ay, lad," said the skipper, his eyes twinkling. "What be these?"\r\ndrawing a parcel from under his pea-jacket.\r\n\r\n  Noll\'s eager "Letters! and for me?" tickled the old sailor\r\nwonderfully.\r\n\r\n  "Yes, these be letters," he said, chuckling; "Jack, here, talks o\'\r\nrunnin\' a smack down this winter purpose to bring yer mail!"\r\n\r\n  "\'Tw\'u\'d take something bigger\'n a smack," observed Mr. Snape, looking\r\naskance to see how Noll grasped the precious parcel.\r\n\r\n  "All yer frien\'s said as how I was to bring ye back on the \'Gull,\'"\r\ncalled the skipper after him, as Noll went running across the sand\r\ntoward the house.\r\n\r\n  "Oh, how I wish--No! I can\'t go, skipper; it\'s no use talking," Noll\r\nanswered back as he gained the piazza, and there sat down to open his\r\nprecious missives.\r\n\r\n  Five or six of his boy friends had agreed to surprise him each with a\r\nletter, and here they were, together with a kind note from Mr. Gray.\r\nWhat a comfort and pleasure they were! It was almost like seeing the\r\nwriters\' faces and talking with them, Noll thought.\r\n\r\n  Trafford came out upon the piazza while he sat there absorbed in their\r\ncontents, and as he walked along toward the skipper, who stood waiting\r\nat the bottom of the steps, noted the boy\'s eager, delighted face, and\r\nwondered why the lad did not return to his friends, where, it was\r\nquite evident, he was much desired and longed for. Why did he stay on\r\nthis dreary Rock? What was there here to make the place endurable for\r\na boy of his age and tastes? He could not see.\r\n\r\n  Those were the last letters which Noll received. The "Gull" made one\r\nor two trips after that, but the first of November brought keen,\r\nsleety weather, and Skipper Ben came no more; so that for the long\r\nmonths ahead Culm Rock was to be shut out from the world entirely. The\r\nthought of being isolated from all assistance, in case of illness or\r\ntrouble, oppressed Noll somewhat till he had accustomed himself to the\r\nthought, and then a vague dread of loneliness and homesickness in the\r\ndragging days of winter haunted him for a time. But getting bravely\r\nover these, and interested in his studies, he began to find that the\r\nNovember days were not so intolerable, after all.\r\n\r\n  Uncle Richard had surprised him one day by bringing in a\r\nwriting-table, from one of the unoccupied rooms, and placing it\r\nopposite his own chair by one of the tall windows. "For your books,\r\nNoll," he had said; and from thenceforth the boy\'s well-worn school\r\nvolumes had a place there, and study in the cold chamber was exchanged\r\nfor the comfortable warmth of the library. It was not an unpleasant\r\nschoolroom, by any means, though the high, old window framed nothing\r\nbut a great stretch of sea and sky,--both, this chilly month of\r\nNovember, often gray and misty.\r\n\r\n  Instead of the roar and din of the city which sounded about the\r\ndearly-remembered room at Hastings, there was the hoarse murmur of the\r\ntide on its rocks and pebbles, the wild whirling of the wind and its\r\nscreaming around the corners and over the chimney,--not cheery sounds,\r\nany of them; yet, in the still afternoons, and the cozy quietness of\r\nlong evenings when the lamp shed its mild light over the room, and the\r\nfire on the hearth shone redly, there was such calm and peace for\r\nbooks and study as Noll found both pleasant and profitable.\r\n\r\n  In these days, you may be sure, the boy\'s thoughts were often across\r\nthe vast gray sea in front of his window, even when he was bending\r\nover his problems or translations; not that he regretted his decision\r\nto share Uncle Richard\'s life with him, nor that he had any thoughts\r\nof fleeing away, but those flitting sails on the far horizon were\r\nmessengers which alway bore on their white wings thoughts of hope and\r\nlove and patience to those over the sea.\r\n\r\n  It was not the natural sphere of a boy,--this monotonous, unvarying\r\nround of days, with no companions of his age or tastes; and, as week\r\nafter week passed, and Noll was still blithe and apparently contented,\r\nTrafford wondered and conjectured, and could not surmise a reason for\r\nit; though, had he observed closely, it would not have been a great\r\nmystery. For Noll there was the unfailing comfort of the little Bible\r\nwhich lay beside the huge old bed up-stairs, and which gave the double\r\ncomfort of its own blessedness and the remembrance of its preciousness\r\nto her who turned its pages to the last; and there were ever the\r\npitying ears of Jesus ready to hear the story of discouragement and\r\nloneliness, when the burden of slow, weary days seemed _too_ heavy to\r\nbear.\r\n\r\n  Into Trafford\'s life had come more brightness and content than he had\r\nknown since that dark day when his wife left him and vanished in the\r\ndarkness which, to his eyes, filled and hovered over the grave. It did\r\nnot, as yet, seem like a real and lasting joy; he trembled lest some\r\nday it should prove but a dream, a vision, and so vanish. He often\r\nlaid aside his book and looked up, half expecting to find the room as\r\nsilent and lonely as when, of old, he was the only inhabitant of the\r\ngreat library; but there, at the opposite window, sat the pleasant\r\nfigure of the boy, busy with his books, and as real and tangible as\r\nheart could wish. It was a perpetual delight, though he hid all\r\nknowledge of it from Noll, to feel that the boy was present, to see\r\nhim curled up in a great chair by the fire, watching the flames or the\r\ndepths of rosy coal, of a twilight, and to feel that he was _his_,--a\r\nprecious gift to love and cherish. So the man\'s heart began to go out\r\ntoward the boy,--tremblingly, warningly at first, then, as he found\r\nhim true and worthy, with all its might and all the fervor of which it\r\nwas capable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nDIRK\'S TROUBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Noll closed his books one afternoon after recitations, saying, "I\'ll\r\nput on my overcoat, Uncle Richard, and take a run up the shore,--just\r\nfor exercise. The waves are monstrous, and how they thunder! I haven\'t\r\nseen them so large since I came to Culm."\r\n\r\n  "Look out for the tide," continued his uncle; "keep away from that\r\nnarrow strip of sand up the shore, for the waves will cover it in an\r\nhour."\r\n\r\n  Noll promised to be cautious, and ran off after cap and overcoat.\r\nHagar met him as he came down from his room all muffled for the walk,\r\nand exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n  "Bress ye, honey! where ye bound fur now? Dis yer is a drefful bad\r\ntime on de shore! I\'s \'feard to hev ye roun\' dar!" looking at him\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n  Noll laughed merrily. "Do you think I\'m too small to take care of\r\nmyself, Hagar?" he asked; "I\'m only going for a walk, and to see the\r\nwaves. I\'ll be back for supper with Uncle Richard."\r\n\r\n  The sky was wild and gray with clouds. A keen, chilly wind swept\r\nfiercely over the rocks and along the shore, and the dark,\r\nfoam-fringed waves rode grandly in upon the beach with a thunderous\r\nshock as they flew into spray. Some of the spray mist wet Noll\'s face,\r\neven as he stood upon the piazza steps. But, warmly clad, and loving\r\nthe sight of the wild tumult, he started with a light heart for his\r\nwalk up the shore. As far as he could see, the sea was dark and\r\ngloomy, with long curves of foam whitening its surface and gleaming on\r\nthe crests of its racing waves. At his feet, on the sand, lay great\r\ntangles of kelp and flecks of yeasty froth. The air was keen, and\r\nfrosty enough to film the still pools in the hollows with brittle ice,\r\nand where the spray fell upon the rocks, it congealed and cased the\r\nold boulders with glittering mail. Not a sail was there in sight, and\r\nNoll thought the sea had never looked so vast and lonely as now. Along\r\nthe horizon the clouds were white-edged, and seemed to open and lead\r\naway into illimitable distances of vapor. He stopped under the shelter\r\nof a rock to look behind him, over the path which he had trodden. The\r\nstone house looked dark and forbidding, like everything else under\r\nthis wild gray sky; but Noll had long ago ceased to consider it as\r\nresembling a prison. It was home, now, and so took a fairer, brighter\r\nshape in his eyes. Beyond, the pines stood up against the sky, full of\r\nsombreness and inky shadow.\r\n\r\n  "How cold and desolate everything is!" thought Noll; "but it\'s not\r\nhalf so gloomy as it seems, after all. I wish, though, that Ned--dear\r\nfellow!--was here, just to make it lively once in a while." He walked\r\non, listening to the heavy thunder of waves, and looking upon the\r\ntroubled waste of sea, till he came to the curve of the shore. Here\r\nlay the narrow path of pebbles against which his uncle had warned him.\r\nBut there seemed no immediate danger, for the path looked as wide as\r\never, and as there was yet an hour before the tide would be in, Noll\r\nhurried across, the salt spray flying wildly about him.\r\n\r\n  "I\'ll go on a little further," he thought, "and I shall get home long\r\nenough before tea-time, then."\r\n\r\n  Having gone a little way, however, he chanced to remember that he had\r\nnot been at Culm village for a month, at least, and longed to take a\r\nrun down to the little cluster of houses.\r\n\r\n  "How the waves will dash in there!" he thought; "and I wonder how\r\nthose huts stand such a tempest as this? I\'ve a good mind to go,\r\nanyhow,--it\'s such a good chance to see the place in a gale." He\r\nwavered and walked hesitatingly about in the sand for a few minutes,\r\nand at last decided to go. He ran and walked by turns, the wind\r\nblowing his curly locks in his eyes and taking his breath almost away\r\nwith its fierce gusts; yet he kept on. It seemed as if the waves\r\njarred and thundered heavier on this Culm side than on his own quarter\r\nof the Rock; at any rate, the wind was more powerful, and blew the\r\nspray upon him in showers.\r\n\r\n  "I\'ll get drenched, if the wind keeps on like this!" he thought; "if I\r\nweren\'t so near, I\'d turn back; but the houses are in sight, already,\r\nand I\'ve got to get acquainted with salt water. I\'ll keep on!"\r\n\r\n  When he drew near the little settlement, he was tired enough with\r\nrunning and battling the wind, and was content to take a slower pace.\r\nNever had the fishermen\'s huts looked so forlorn and miserable as now.\r\nNoll half expected to see them come tumbling and rolling along the\r\nsand in every gust of wind which struck them; yet, with some\r\nmysterious attraction to their sandy foundations, they held their own,\r\nthough some of them creaked and groaned with the strain which was\r\nbrought to bear upon their timbers.\r\n\r\n  The boy kept on toward the little wharf, over which the waves rolled\r\nand tumbled furiously, without meeting a soul. The water dashed so\r\nhigh and wildly up the sand that he was obliged to keep well up beside\r\nthe houses to escape a drenching. He thought he had never looked upon\r\nso grand a sight as the sea presented here,--all its vast waste\r\nlashed into great waves that came roaring in like white-maned monsters\r\nto dash themselves upon the laud.\r\n\r\n  Standing here, close by Dirk Sharp\'s door, Noll suddenly fancied he\r\nheard a faint wail within. He was not at all sure, the sea thundered\r\nso, and the wind screamed so shrilly about the miserable dwelling; but\r\npresently, in a slight lull of the tempest, he heard the wail--if wail\r\nit was--again. It sounded like the voice of a child,--a child\r\nsuffering illness or pain.\r\n\r\n  "I wonder if Dirk has any little ones?" thought Noll; "and what can he\r\ndo with them, if they are ill?"\r\n\r\n  Mentally hoping that his ears had deceived him, and that no one on the\r\ndesolate Rock stood in need of aid which they could not have, he was\r\nabout to turn away and retrace his steps homeward, as the sky seemed\r\nto shut down grayer and darker than before, and nightfall was\r\napproaching. But at that instant the door of the dwelling opened, and\r\nout came Dirk, beating his breast and crying aloud, whether with pain\r\nor grief Noll was too surprised to notice at first.\r\n\r\n  The man failed to see the lad standing close by his door-step till he\r\nhad taken several strides up and down the sand, where the wind blew\r\nthe spray full upon him,--walking there hatless and coatless. When he\r\ndid perceive him, he stopped short, exclaiming, almost fiercely,--\r\n\r\n  "What _ye_ here fur, lad?--what ye here fur? The Lord knows it\'s no\r\nplace fur the sort ye b\'long to!"\r\n\r\n  "I was looking at the sea," said Noll; "and--and--what\'s the matter,\r\nDirk?"\r\n\r\n  "Nothin\' that\'ll do ye any good ter know!" cried Dirk, roughly,\r\nbeginning to pace up and down the sand again. "Ye can\'t know nothin\'\r\no\' trouble, lad! How ken ye?"\r\n\r\n  Noll hardly knew what answer to make to this vehement question, and\r\nfinally made none at all, but asked,--\r\n\r\n  "Are any of your family ill, Dirk?"\r\n\r\n  "Ill? Sick, ye mean? O Lord! yes, yes,--and dyin\'!"\r\n\r\n  Noll started. Some one ill and dying on this dreary, wretched Rock!\r\nand no doctor to give aid. He did not know how far he might dare to\r\ninterrogate Dirk in his present half-frenzied condition, but ventured,\r\nafter a minute or two of silence, to ask,--\r\n\r\n  "Is it one of the children?"\r\n\r\n  "Yes, my little gal!" said Dirk, groaning,--"my little gal it is, an\'\r\nnothin\' to keep her frum it. O Lord! seems as ef I sh\'u\'d go mad!" and\r\nhe threw up his hands to the lowering sky in despair, and faced about\r\nto the sea, letting the cold drops drive into his face.\r\n\r\n  Noll was fain to comfort him, but was at a loss how to offer\r\nconsolation to such anguish as Dirk\'s.\r\n\r\n  "Isn\'t there some one on the Rock that can help, that knows something\r\nabout medicine?" he asked, eagerly.\r\n\r\n  "No, no, lad!" Dirk cried, "there ain\'t a soul this side o\' the sea\r\nken help my little gal! Ye don\' know nothin\' o\' trouble, lad! Ye don\'\r\nknow what \'tis ter feel that yer chile\'s dyin\' fur want o\' somethin\'\r\nto save it! O Lord! seems as ef I c\'u\'d swim through this sea to\r\nHastings fur my little gal!"\r\n\r\n  He rushed down to the boiling surf, and Noll half expected to see him\r\nthrow himself into the sea; but he came back, drenched with a great\r\nwave, with despair and agony upon his face.\r\n\r\n  "Here, lad," he exclaimed, "come in,--come in an\' see what trouble is!\r\nYe don\' know. How ken ye?"\r\n\r\n  Noll followed, and Dirk pushed open the door of his dwelling. The air\r\nwhich met the boy as he entered the small, low room was so close and\r\nfoul that he almost staggered back. The floor was bare, and through a\r\ncrack under the door the keen wind swept in across it, flaring the\r\nfire on the stone hearth and puffing ashes and smoke about. A fishy\r\nodor was upon everything. Household utensils were scattered about in\r\nfront of the hearth, occupying a quarter of the room, and what few\r\nchairs and other articles of wooden furniture there were, were fairly\r\nblack with dirt and smoke. Noll had never before entered a dwelling so\r\nfilthy, wretched, and miserable as this.\r\n\r\n  "Here, lad," said Dirk, brokenly,--"here--be--the--little gal," and\r\npointed to one corner, where, watched over by a thin, slovenly woman,\r\nthe child lay on its little bed.\r\n\r\n  The mother did not take her eyes off the girl, and Noll went forward,\r\nwith much inward repugnance, to look upon Dirk\'s treasure. The child\'s\r\ncheeks were flushed a bright red, and it lay with drowsy, heavy-lidded\r\neyes, uttering, at intervals, a low wail.\r\n\r\n  Noll shivered, and involuntarily thought of those dreary, desolate\r\ngraves which he stumbled upon in one of his rambles. Could nothing be\r\ndone? Must the child die for lack of a little medicine? He looked\r\nthrough the little dirt-crusted window upon the tossing sea, and saw\r\nwhat a hopeless barrier it interposed between them and aid. He thought\r\nof Uncle Richard, and knew that it was useless to expect aid from that\r\ndirection; and then he thought of _Hagar_! She was a good nurse, he\r\nremembered, and knew--or claimed to know--a vast deal about medicine.\r\nPerhaps she could help this child! he thought, with a glad heart, and\r\nif she could! His heart suddenly sank, for he remembered that the old\r\nhousekeeper could not make a journey through the storm and tempest,\r\neven had she the necessary skill.\r\n\r\n  "But," he thought to himself, "I can tell her about the child,--it\'s\r\ngot a fever,--and she can send medicines; and to-morrow, if it\'s\r\npleasant, she can come herself!" and thinking thus, Noll turned to\r\nDirk, with--\r\n\r\n  "I can get you some medicines, I think, from our old housekeeper. May\r\nI? Shall I try?"\r\n\r\n  The fisherman was silent with surprise. He would probably have sooner\r\nexpected aid from across the raging sea than from this lad.\r\n\r\n  Noll read an answer in his eyes, and hastened to the door, and bounded\r\naway without waiting for any more words or explanations.\r\n\r\n  How fast it had grown dark while he was in Dirk\'s hut! The horizon was\r\nquite hidden, so was all the wide waste a half-mile from shore; but\r\nwith the coming of night the sea had lost none of its thunder, nor\r\nthe wind aught of its fierceness. Noll ran till he was out of breath.\r\nThen he walked, thinking that the homeward path was wonderfully long.\r\nThen he ran again, feeling almost as if the child\'s life depended upon\r\nhis exertions, and seeming to hear its wail above all the din of wind\r\nand waves.\r\n\r\n  Suddenly he plashed to his ankles, and this brought his headlong race\r\nto an abrupt termination. What could it mean? Then he remembered, with\r\na sudden chill, what, in his eagerness and anxiety, he had entirely\r\nforgotten,--the tide was coming in, and was already over the path\r\nwhich Uncle Richard warned him against.\r\n\r\n  He looked back. The beach over which he had come glimmered faintly in\r\nthe dusk, with its long line of breakers gleaming far up and down.\r\nBack there in the darkness, he thought, Dirk\'s child was dying for\r\nwant of medicine. Oh! what to do? He looked down at the foam creeping\r\nabout his ankles, and said to himself,--\r\n\r\n  "Pshaw! it\'s only over shoe, now, and my feet are wet already. I\'ll\r\ndash through; \'twon\'t take but three minutes, and I _can\'t_ wait!"\r\n\r\n  He sprang on, thinking to clear the short strip, which the tide had\r\ncovered, with a few bounds. A wave, high and broad, which had been\r\ngathering power and volume in all its long, onward course, came\r\nsweeping thunderingly in and engulfed him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nIN THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Noll\'s presence of mind enabled him to clutch the jagged sides of the\r\nrock desperately, so that in the wave\'s return he was not drawn with\r\nit into the sea depths. Stunned, strangled, half blinded, and impelled\r\nby a sudden horror of death in the cold, treacherous sea, he took two\r\nor three forward steps, fell, then rose and strove to struggle on.\r\nBut a little hollow in the path let him down into the flood to his\r\nwaist. The spray flew into his eyes and mouth, and breathless and\r\nbewildered he fell again, this time to disappear under the\r\nfoam-flecked water. He struggled up to air and life at last, with many\r\ngasps for breath, and once more clutched at the rocks behind him. It\r\nall seemed like the terror of a dream, not real and threatening. Was\r\nhe to be drowned? Some sudden thought of the pleasantness of life, of\r\ndear friends across this same cruel, ravenous sea, of Uncle Richard\r\nand his warning, came to him here. To be drowned in this dark, chill,\r\nraging flood? Oh! no, no! Then he saw, out in the gloom and mistiness,\r\nthe white gleaming of a wave-crest, rising and sinking, but sweeping\r\nsteadily toward him, and knew that it would dash upon his narrow\r\nfoothold. Could he survive another?\r\n\r\n  Then from Noll\'s lips came a shrill cry, which rose above the thunder\r\nand battering of the sea; and, whether from terror or whether from the\r\nfact that the dear name was so warm and vivid in his heart at that\r\nmoment, the cry was not "Help!" but, "Papa, papa!"\r\n\r\n  The cry was answered!--at least, Noll fancied it was, and clung to the\r\njagged edges of rock with a new love of life in his heart, and, with\r\nhis eyes on the approaching wave, which began to loom up dark and\r\nvast, cried out again with all his might.\r\n\r\n  Out of the darkness which hovered over his submerged path beyond, a\r\nfigure came struggling,--battling the water and making desperate\r\nefforts to run,--crying,--\r\n\r\n  "Noll, Noll! where are you?"\r\n\r\n  "Here,--Uncle Richard,--quick!" answered the boy, clinging desperately\r\nto his only refuge,--the slippery, icy rocks.\r\n\r\n  The wave came thunderingly in, burst, and hid uncle and nephew from\r\neach other. Trafford uttered a groan of despair, and stood, for an\r\ninstant, like one palsied. Back swept the flood, leaving the sand bare\r\nfor a minute, and with a shout, the master of the stone house rushed\r\nforward, seized the figure which had fallen there, and sprang away\r\ntoward the sand and safety. He gained it, and tremblingly laid his\r\nburden down. Had he only saved a body from which the life had flown?\r\n\r\n  "Oh, Noll!" he cried, brokenly,--"Noll, Noll!"\r\n\r\n  Only the sea and the wailing of the wind answered him. Hurriedly\r\ngathering the boy in his arms, he started for the house, running and\r\nstumbling through the sand and over the rocks, fearful lest he should\r\nreach its warmth and shelter too late. But before he had gained half\r\nthe distance between him and the redly-gleaming window, where he knew\r\nHagar was sitting before her fire, Noll stirred in his arms. Trafford\r\nstopped, fearing that his excited imagination had deceived him.\r\n\r\n  "Noll," he cried, "speak to me,--speak!"\r\n\r\n  "Yes--only--I\'m--I\'m so cold," chattered Noll, faintly; "and--Uncle\r\nRichard--you--you\'ve saved me!"\r\n\r\n  Trafford could not speak, so great was the load which had suddenly\r\nlifted from his heart. He started on with his burden, though Noll\r\nprotested against being carried, and at every step rejoiced within\r\nhimself. What cared he for the thunder of the sea, the wind\'s\r\nscreaming, and the terror of death which they boded? _His_ treasure\r\nwas safe, safe!--torn from the very yawning mouth of the deep, and\r\nwhat were wreck and disaster of others to him? He came to the little\r\nkitchen, presently, the light from its one window toward the shore\r\nbeaming cheerily upon him, and threw open the door and entered so\r\nsuddenly that Hagar screamed out with affright.\r\n\r\n  "De good Lord help us now!" she cried at the sight of the master and\r\nhis burden. "What\'s happened, Mas\'r Dick?"\r\n\r\n  Noll answered, assuringly, "Nothing very serious, Hagar. I\'ve been\r\nin--the sea. Oh, Uncle Richard! how did you find me?"\r\n\r\n  Trafford set his burden down upon the three-legged stool which Hagar\r\nhad just vacated, saying,--\r\n\r\n  "I was looking for you, Noll, and heard your cry. O Heaven! what if I\r\nhad failed to hear it!"\r\n\r\n  "I should have been swept away," said Noll.\r\n\r\n  Here Hagar recovered her wits sufficiently to give a little howl of\r\nlamentation.\r\n\r\n  "Out ob de sea! out ob de sea!" she cried; "de Lord be t\'anked fur it!\r\nDat yer sea am a drefful t\'ing, honey,--allers swallerin\', swallerin\',\r\nan\' nebber ken get \'nough fur itself, nohow. Hagar\'s seen it; she\r\nknows what dat yer sea is, an\' t\'ank de Lord, he\'s let ye come out of\r\nit alive. Mas\'r Dick, why don\'t ye t\'ank Him fur savin\' ob yer boy fur\r\nye?"\r\n\r\n  "Hush!" said Trafford, his face growing gloomy; "find Noll some dry\r\nclothes, Hagar. Quick, woman!"\r\n\r\n  "Yes, in a minnit, Mas\'r Dick; quick\'s I ken git dis yer ole candle\r\nlit. But ef ye don\'t t\'ank de Lord now, ye\'ll have to come to it \'fore\r\nlong, Mas\'r Dick; Hagar tells ye so! dat yer time\'ll come! it\'ll\r\ncome!"\r\n\r\n  "Hush!" said Trafford, harshly, "and do as I bade you."\r\n\r\n  Hagar went out, sighing, "Dat time\'ll come, dat time\'ll come, bress de\r\nLord!"\r\n\r\n  Noll looked up from his seat by the fire, where he sat dripping and\r\nshivering, and said,--\r\n\r\n  "But aren\'t you glad I\'m safe, Uncle Richard?--aren\'t you thankful?"\r\n\r\n  Trafford answered this question with a look which made his nephew\r\nexclaim,--\r\n\r\n  "I know you are, Uncle Richard! Then why--why--aren\'t you thankful to\r\nGod?"\r\n\r\n  "Don\'t, don\'t, Noll!" said his uncle. "Strip off those wet garments\r\nand make haste to get warm again. Culm Rock is no place for one to be\r\nsick in. Hurry, boy?"\r\n\r\n  Instead of hurrying, however, Noll suddenly grew very grave and\r\nexclaimed,--\r\n\r\n  "Oh, I\'ve forgotten something, Uncle Richard! That tide drove it all\r\nout of my head. What can I do? Dirk Sharp\'s little girl is\r\nsick--dying, and I was to bring her some medicine, if Hagar had any!"\r\n\r\n  "What is Dirk or his to you?" exclaimed Trafford. "Was that what kept\r\nyou so late? Is that how you came to be caught by the tide?"\r\n\r\n  "Yes," said Noll, "I--"\r\n\r\n  His uncle interrupted him with a stern, "Noll, you reckless lad! What\r\nare those Culm people to us,--to me? You put your life in peril--oh,\r\nI tremble to think _what_ peril!--for Dirk\'s miserable child? What\r\nwere you thinking of? Have you no regard for your life,--for my\r\nhappiness?"\r\n\r\n  "Why," said Noll, quickly, "Dirk loves his child as well as you love\r\nme, and I thought perhaps Hagar\'s medicines could help it, and I\r\ndidn\'t know there was any peril till I got into it; and oh, Uncle\r\nRichard, what will they do now that I can\'t come back?"\r\n\r\n  "I don\'t know," said Trafford, gloomily; "they are accustomed to such\r\nthings, I suppose. Shall I have to command you to take off those wet\r\nclothes?"\r\n\r\n  Noll began to remove his ice-cold garments, but presently said,--\r\n\r\n  "Is there,--do you think there\'ll be any hope of my going back\r\nto-night, Uncle Richard? The child is dreadful sick, you know."\r\n\r\n  "Going back!--to-night! Are you crazy, Noll?" Trafford cried. "No, you\r\nwill not put foot outside the door this night!"\r\n\r\n  "But, Un--"\r\n\r\n  "Hush! not another word," said his uncle, sternly. "If you have no\r\nregard for your life, I must have for you. Hagar is waiting at the\r\ndoor with your dry clothes. Are you ready for them?"\r\n\r\n  Noll answered "Yes," his heart suddenly filled with a dreary\r\nrecollection of the sight which he had seen in Dirk\'s miserable abode.\r\nIt seemed to him as if he could hear the sick child\'s wail above the\r\nwar of the storm. Dirk, he thought, would watch and wait for his\r\nreturn, peering through the dirty little window into the gathering\r\ngloom and darkness, and, finding that he did not come, would settle\r\nback into despair again.\r\n\r\n  Noll put on the dry garments with a heavy heart. He was sure he felt\r\nstrong enough to return to Culm, and although the sea barred the beach\r\npath, yet, with a lantern, he could find a way over the rocks, he\r\nthought. But Uncle Richard had utterly refused; so there was no hope,\r\nand the child must suffer on, and Dirk watch in vain.\r\n\r\n  "Oh," thought Noll, "why wasn\'t I more careful? Why _didn\'t_ I think\r\nof the tide? Then nothing would have happened, and I could have gone\r\nback!"\r\n\r\n  Hagar came in, saying, "Ye\'ll hab yer supper here, in de kitchen,\r\nMas\'r Noll, \'cause it\'s warmer fur ye dan in de dinin\'-room. Ye won\'t\r\nmind Hagar\'s ole kitchen jes\' fur once, honey?"\r\n\r\n  "No," said Noll, sadly, "I won\'t mind at all, Hagar, and I\'m not\r\nhungry--much."\r\n\r\n  Trafford went out to change his own wet clothing. The old housekeeper\r\nbustled between her cupboards and a little round table which she had\r\ndrawn before the fire, casting wistful looks at Noll as he sat gravely\r\ngazing in the coals.\r\n\r\n  "Bress de Lord! bress de Lord fur savin\' ye!" she ejaculated,\r\nfervently, as she bent down over her tea-pot which was spouting\r\nodorous jets of steam from its place on the hearth; "\'pears like dar\r\nwouldn\'t be nuffin left in dis ole house ef de sea had swallered ye,\r\nMas\'r Noll. Don\'t _ye_ t\'ank de Lord?" she asked, peering up into the\r\nboy\'s sober face.\r\n\r\n  "Yes; I\'m glad to live, and I thank God for saving me; but oh, Hagar,"\r\nsaid Noll, almost with tears in his eyes, "there\'s somebody on this\r\nRock to-night that\'s as sad as you or Uncle Richard would have been\r\nif the tide had swept me away!"\r\n\r\n  "Now!" said Hagar; "an\' who is dem yer?"\r\n\r\n  "Dirk Sharp\'s little girl is sick with a fever, and I think she\'s\r\ngoing to die,--though of course I can\'t tell,--and they haven\'t a drop\r\nof medicine. Just think, Hagar,--dying, and nothing to save!"\r\n\r\n  Hagar thought, and sighed heavily over her tea-pot. "Don\' know what\'s\r\ngoin\' to \'come o\' them yer Culm folks!" she said.\r\n\r\n  "And," continued Noll, "I promised to bring Dirk some medicine,--I was\r\ngoing to get it of you; but I got into that fearful tide and was half\r\ndrowned, and now--oh, what can I do?"\r\n\r\n  "Bress ye, honey, ye didn\'t \'spect to go back in de dark to Culm?"\r\ncried Hagar.\r\n\r\n  "I would--if Uncle Richard hadn\'t forbidden," said Noll; "do you think\r\nyou have any medicines that can help the child, Hagar?"\r\n\r\n  "Don\' know," shaking her turbaned head. "Ef \'twas rheumatiz, or ef\r\n\'twas a cut, or ef \'twas one o\' dem yer colds, Hagar\'d \'spect to know;\r\nbut can\'t tell nuffin \'bout fevers, nohow. \'Tw\'u\'d be jes\' as de\r\nLord\'s willin\'!"\r\n\r\n  "Will you go, or send something in the morning?" queried Noll.\r\n\r\n  "Ef it\'s pleasant, honey, Hagar\'ll go wid ye. Yer supper\'s waiting fur\r\nye!"\r\n\r\n  Noll sighed, and did not stir. The misery which he had seen in Dirk\'s\r\nwretched hut haunted him.\r\n\r\n  Hagar poured out the boy\'s cup of tea, waited a little space, then\r\nreturned it to its steaming pot again.\r\n\r\n  "Come, yer supper\'s cold \'nough, now, honey," said she, coming up to\r\nNoll\'s seat. "What ye waitin\' fur? Oh, chile, ye grows more\'n\' more\r\nlike yer poor father. T\'inkin\' ob de mis\'ry ober dar; ain\'t ye?"\r\n\r\n  "_Such_ misery, too!" said Noll.\r\n\r\n  "Well, dar\'s mis\'ry eberywhere!" said Hagar; "can\'t go nowhere but\r\nwhat ye\'ll find it. Yer Uncle Dick has had mis\'ry \'nough in his day,\r\nbut \'tain\'t done him no good \'tall. Jes\' froze his heart up harder\'n a\r\nstone."\r\n\r\n  "It isn\'t all stone," said Noll.\r\n\r\n  "Don\' ye t\'ink so? Well, \'pears like ye\'s sent here by de Lord, jes\'\r\nto break dat heart ob his all to pieces!" said Hagar, earnestly.\r\n\r\n  "Sent here to break Uncle Richard\'s heart?" laughed Noll. "Well, I\r\nwonder if he thinks I came here for that purpose?"\r\n\r\n  "Don\' know," said the old housekeeper, with a shake of her head; "but\r\ndat\'s what I t\'ink de Lord sent ye here fur. Dat heart ob his is all\r\nfrizzed up. \'Spects \'twon\'t be so allus, chile,--de Lord helpin\'."\r\n\r\n  Noll ate his supper, bade Hagar good-night, admonishing her to "be sure\r\nand have the medicines ready the first thing!" and groped his way to\r\nthe library, where his uncle was sitting at his organ.\r\n\r\n  Trafford stopped playing the instant the door opened, and as Noll drew\r\nnear, put his arm about him, saying,--\r\n\r\n  "My boy!--_mine!_--doubly my own since I snatched you from death! Oh,\r\nNoll! if I had lost you!"\r\n\r\n  The boy sighed. "Dirk has got to lose _his_ child," he said, "and oh,\r\nUncle Richard, I should be a great deal happier if I might only try to\r\nsave it!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nDIRK\'S TREASURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  At the first gray glimmer of the wintry dawn, Noll was awake. He felt\r\nstiff and lame after his adventure of the previous evening, and not at\r\nall inclined to stir. But a sudden recollection of Dirk and his child,\r\nand the aid which he had promised them, came to him almost as soon as\r\nhe was conscious of the day\'s dawning, and he got up and limped to\r\nthe window to see whether there was any prospect of Hagar\'s journey to\r\nCulm being realized. The sky was as gray and sombre as yesterday\'s had\r\nbeen. All the sea was in a great turmoil, and rolled in a flood of\r\nfoam upon the shore as far as he could see. Not a sail in sight upon\r\nthe lonely waste, not a sign of human life anywhere. Now and then a\r\nsnow-flake fluttered down; and the wind screamed shrilly about the\r\nhouse-corners, and wailed hoarsely in the casements.\r\n\r\n  "Hagar can\'t go to-day," thought Noll, with a sinking heart; "and, oh!\r\nwhat _can_ be done?"\r\n\r\n  He trembled for fear Uncle Richard would forbid him to go to Culm\r\nagain. He felt as if he could never bear to meet Dirk\'s eyes after\r\npromising him aid and failing to bring it; and, with this thought\r\noppressing him, and the lonely cry of the sea filling his ears, he\r\ndressed himself, and went down to the library with a downcast heart.\r\nHis uncle sat by a window, looking, with a sad and gloomy face, upon\r\nthe sea; and, as his nephew entered, acknowledged his "Good-morning,\r\nUncle Richard," with only a cold nod. But Noll, resolved to have the\r\nmatter settled at once, came up to his chair, saying,--\r\n\r\n  "I\'ve got a great favor to ask of you, Uncle Richard. May I go around\r\nto Culm after breakfast?"\r\n\r\n  Trafford\'s face grew gloomier than before.\r\n\r\n  "For what?" he asked.\r\n\r\n  "To carry something for Dirk\'s child," Noll answered, meeting his\r\nuncle\'s stern eyes with his own pleading blue ones.\r\n\r\n  "Pshaw!" exclaimed Trafford, impatiently, "what are these miserable\r\nfish-folks to you? I don\'t want you to care for them!"\r\n\r\n  "But, Uncle Richard--"\r\n\r\n  "Well?"\r\n\r\n  "Dirk\'s child is sick,--dying, I\'m afraid!"\r\n\r\n  "So are hundreds in this world. There\'s misery everywhere."\r\n\r\n  "Perhaps I might aid this misery, Uncle Richard, if you\'ll let me try.\r\nWill you?"\r\n\r\n  "You will have more than your hands full if you are going to look\r\nafter these Culm people," said Trafford, coldly; "you had better not\r\nbegin."\r\n\r\n  Noll\'s face grew graver and graver, and he made no reply to his\r\nuncle\'s last remark.\r\n\r\n  "Well," said Trafford, after a long silence, "do you wish anything\r\nmore, Noll?"\r\n\r\n  The boy turned away, as if hurt by his uncle\'s coldness, and walked\r\nquickly to the library door. There he wavered--stopped--then turned\r\nabout, and came back.\r\n\r\n  "Uncle Richard," said he, tremulously, "papa said I was to do all the\r\ngood I could in the world, and never pass by any trouble that I might\r\nhelp, and--and I think he would tell me to go to Dirk\'s, if he were\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n  Trafford turned about with an impatient word upon his lips, but it was\r\nnot spoken. It seemed to him as if his dead brother stood before\r\nhim,--as he had known him when they were boys together,--and that\r\nthose words were meant for a reproach. He put out his hand and touched\r\nNoll\'s shoulder, as if to make sure that it was really his nephew and\r\nno vision.\r\n\r\n  "Ah!" said he, with a sigh, "your father looks out at me from your\r\neyes, Noll. Turn them away from me. Go to Culm, if you like,--you\r\nhave my permission."\r\n\r\n  "Breakfas\'s waitin\' fur ye!" said Hagar, at the door.\r\n\r\n  "But, Uncle Richard," said Noll, in some perplexity, "I don\'t like to\r\ngo and have you all the time wishing me at home."\r\n\r\n  "I cannot help that," said Trafford, as he rose to answer Hagar\'s\r\ncall. "I have given you permission,--go."\r\n\r\n  The breakfast was a silent one. After it was over, and the door had\r\nclosed upon the grim master of the house as he went back to his books,\r\nHagar said,--\r\n\r\n  "Don\'t ye let nuffin make ye downhearted, honey! De Lord\'ll help ye,\r\nef yer Uncle Dick won\'t. \'Tain\'t de might nor de money dat\'ll do\r\neberyting, chile. All \'pends on whether de Lord\'s on yer\r\nside. Jes\' come in my ole kitchen and see what I\'s put up fur ye to\r\ncarry to dem yer mis\'able folks."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Dis yer is brof." Page 183.]\r\n\r\n  Noll got his overcoat and cap, and followed the old housekeeper into\r\nher cozy and comfortable dominion.\r\n\r\n"Look at dis yer," said Hagar, taking a basket off the table;\r\n"jes\' as chock full as nuffin ye ken think ob. Dis yer is\r\nbrof,--chicken-brof,--an\' dat yer bundle is crackers. Dis bottle\'s de\r\nmed\'cine, an\' de chile is to hab a teaspoonful ebery half an hour. Ef\r\nI could be there, de chile should hab a sweat, sure; but dis\r\nmed\'cine\'ll hev to answer! Dis yer is a teaspoon an\' a teacup, \'cause\r\nye won\'t find nuffin fit fur to drink nuffin out ob. Hagar knows how\r\ndem yer Culm folks lib! Now, ken ye \'member all dat, honey?"\r\n\r\n  "Yes," said Noll, "and I thank you a hundred times, Hagar. I\'d better\r\nstart at once, without waiting another minute."\r\n\r\n  The old housekeeper followed him to the door, cautioning, "Keep \'way\r\nfrom dat yer sea, chile! Don\'t yer git into dat yer drefful tide,\r\nhoney! an\' de Lord bress ye an\' bring ye safe back!"\r\n\r\n  The wind was keen and bitter, and the sea thundered as mightily as on\r\nthe previous evening. Noll hurried along over the great patches of icy\r\nsea-weed and frozen pools of water in the rocks and hollows, and\r\nthought, now that he was making such haste, that the way had never\r\nseemed quite so long before. He paused for a moment to look upon the\r\nscene of last night\'s peril, and remember, with a shudder, how the\r\nwaves battered, and how they pierced and numbed him with their cold.\r\nThen he ran along the hard, sandy beach as fast as the wind and his\r\nburden would let him. The Culm huts came in sight at last, cheerless\r\nand desolate, and with no sign of life or occupancy about them, save\r\nthe faint smoke which the wind whirled down from the chimneys.\r\n\r\n  Noll began to regard Dirk\'s habitation with anxious eyes long before\r\nhe drew near. He half expected to see the fisherman\'s tall figure\r\npacing up and down the sand, beating his breast and groaning with\r\ndespair, perhaps; but instead, the sands were deserted. Noll came\r\nopposite the miserable dwelling, and paused a few seconds before\r\nrapping, waiting to hear the sick child\'s low wail. He heard only a\r\nconfused, unintelligible murmur of voices.\r\n\r\n  A woman answered his summons,--not the child\'s mother, but a neighbor,\r\nevidently,--and stood staring blankly at him.\r\n\r\n  "Can I see Dirk,--Dirk Sharp?" Noll asked.\r\n\r\n  At the sound of the boy\'s voice, the fisherman himself came to the\r\ndoor. His face was haggard, and looked wan and worn, for all the\r\nbronze of wind and weather that was upon it.\r\n\r\n  "Lord bless ye, lad!" he cried to Noll, "but ye be too late."\r\n\r\n  "Too late?"\r\n\r\n  "Yes," brokenly, "my little gal died las\' night."\r\n\r\n  Noll was silent with surprise. He was too late,--too late.\r\n\r\n  "Oh, Dirk," he said, as soon as he could speak, "I would have come\r\nback last night, but I got into the sea, and--and it was impossible.\r\nSo I brought what I could this morning."\r\n\r\n  Dirk looked at the lad and his basket, and choked. At last he said,\r\ngratefully, "It be good in ye to care for the like o\' us, lad. We be\r\npoor folks fur ye to look at, the Lord knows! What did ye bring fur my\r\nlittle gal?"\r\n\r\n  Noll lifted the cover of his basket, and Dirk peered in, exclaiming,\r\n"My little gal never seed the like o\' them, lad! She wur a tender\r\nthing, my little gal wur, and mabby ef she\'d had a bit o\' somethin\'\r\nbetter\'n the salt fish--Well, she be beyond meat and drink now," he\r\nsaid, choking again.\r\n\r\n  Noll knew not whether to turn back, or to stay. Dirk, however,\r\npresently said, "Come, lad, step in an\' see my little gal. She wur as\r\nwhite an\' sof\'-cheeked as yerself. O Lord! I might ha\' knowed she\'d\r\nnever come up stout an\' growin\' like the rest," he groaned as he\r\nturned back to lead the way for Noll.\r\n\r\n  In the room where the little one had lain sat three or four old\r\nfish-wives,--wrinkled, weather-beaten old faces they had,--who were\r\nnodding and whispering over their pipes in a solemn kind of way,\r\noccasionally addressing a word to the mother, who sat enveloped in the\r\nsmoke which poured into the room from the ill-constructed fireplace.\r\nThey regarded Noll with many curious glances as he passed through\r\nafter Dirk to the apartment where the child was laid, and one old\r\ncreature followed after them, apparently to ascertain the boy\'s\r\nerrand.\r\n\r\n  It was a bare room where Dirk\'s treasure was sleeping,--not a thing in\r\nit save the two wooden stools and rough board which upheld their still\r\nlittle burden. Pure and white the child lay,--a fair, delicate flower\r\nwhen compared with the dinginess and squalor of everything about it;\r\nand something of this contrast seemed to glimmer upon Dirk\'s rough\r\nperceptions, for he said to Noll,--\r\n\r\n  "Ye wouldn\'t think she could be mine, lad! Ye don\'t wonder the little\r\ngal couldn\'t come up like the rest o\' the young uns?"\r\n\r\n  "It wur a fair gal, Lord knows," said the old fish-wife who had\r\nfollowed them in; "it warn\'t black and freckly, never. Sich kinds\r\ndon\'t love this salt water, Dirk Sharp,--ye couldn\'t ha\' raised her,\r\nman!"\r\n\r\n  "Oh, my little gal!" murmured Dirk, smoothing a fleck of golden hair\r\nwith his great brawny hand.\r\n\r\n  "Ye be fair an\' white," said the old fish-wife, touching Noll\'s cheek\r\nwith her skinny finger, "an\' what be ye here on the Rock fur?"\r\n\r\n  "Sh!--ye let the lad alone, mother," said Dirk; "he be come here to\r\nbring my little gal somethin\', an\' she be beyond eatin\' an\' drinkin\'.\r\nHe be a good lad to do it!"\r\n\r\n  Noll looked upon the little sleeper\'s face, and then at the wretched\r\nsurroundings, and was glad for the child\'s sake that sleep and peace\r\nhad come at last. Yet his heart was heavy as he looked upon his basket\r\nand its now useless contents, and he thought, "Oh, if I had only been\r\nmore careful last night!--perhaps--perhaps Hagar\'s medicines could\r\nhave helped it." He turned to Dirk, saying, quietly,--\r\n\r\n  "I must go now. I\'m--I\'m _so_ sorry I was too late!"\r\n\r\n  The fisherman followed Noll out on to the sand, and, as the boy was\r\nabout to turn away homeward, took both his hands in one of his own\r\ngreat brown ones, saying,--\r\n\r\n  "Ye be kinder to me \'an I ken tell ye, lad. I thought yer kind had no\r\nheart fur us folk. Bless ye, lad, bless ye!"\r\n\r\n  Noll\'s homeward walk seemed somewhat brighter to him, even though he\r\nleft the child dead behind him. Dirk\'s gratitude, a small matter\r\nthough it may have been, gave him a thrill of pleasure. It was\r\npleasant to think that he had one friend among the fish-folk, rough\r\nand ignorant though they were. He remembered how, in the little\r\nsea-town in which his father had once dwelt, the fishermen came at\r\nlast to love and respect the kind minister who worked so patiently to\r\nraise them out of their slough of ignorance and degradation, and that\r\nwhenever his father walked among them, they flocked about him to\r\nlisten to his words and counsel, and watch for his look or smile of\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n  "And," thought Noll, "if Uncle Richard would only do as papa did, what\r\na happy man he would be, and what good he could do for Culm!" But that\r\ntime--if ever it came--was yet a long, long way off, he thought, and\r\nso the people must live on their old, dreary, wretched life till some\r\none taught them better.\r\n\r\n  The boy walked soberly home, with a great many serious, earnest\r\nthoughts in his heart. Somehow, this morning\'s sight had made another\r\nimpression upon his mind beside that of sadness and disappointment. He\r\nfelt and saw that there was a great work to do. Who was to do it?\r\n\r\n  Hagar met him at the door, rejoicing that he had returned in safety,\r\nbut, stopping only to tell her that the child was dead, Noll went on\r\nto the library. It was the boy\'s intention to open his heart to his\r\nuncle, and tell him of all the want and wretchedness there was at\r\nCulm, while the impression was so deep and vivid in his mind; but\r\nTrafford sat at the organ and took no notice of his nephew\'s presence,\r\nand, after a long lingering, Noll gave up the attempt for that day, at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\n  It was late in the afternoon when he went out for his accustomed walk.\r\nPartly by accident, partly by design, he came to the little place of\r\ngraves in the frozen sand, and there found the funeral party from the\r\nfish-huts just gathering about the shallow resting-place which had\r\nbeen scooped for Dirk\'s treasure. The huddling crowd of poorly-clad\r\nmen and women respectfully made way for him, and Dirk looked\r\nunutterable thanks for what he considered a great honor. Without a\r\nprayer, without a word of consolation, the little one was lowered\r\ninto the earth amid the wailing of the women, and the shrill and\r\nlonely screaming of the fierce and bitter wind.\r\n\r\n  Noll had never seen anything so unutterably dreary, and when all was\r\nover, and the mourners had disappeared over the other side of the\r\nRock, he went home, thinking more deeply than ever of the work to be\r\ndone, and wondering who was to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nFIRELIGHT TALK.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The warmth and quietness of the library made such a bright and\r\npleasant contrast to the dreary scene in the Culm burying-ground that\r\nNoll gave a great sigh of pleasure and relief as he entered the room\r\nand found it light and cheerful with the blaze of a brisk fire on the\r\nhearth. He sat down in one of the big arm-chairs which stood either\r\nside of the fireplace, and held his numbed hands in the warmth, and\r\nlooked about him, thinking that the old stone house was a palace in\r\ncomparison with the other Culm habitations. Uncle Richard sat in his\r\nusual seat by the window, with his face toward the darkening sea, and,\r\nwith the dismal scene which he had just witnessed fresh in his mind,\r\nNoll felt a tenderer yearning toward the stern man,--feeling, somehow,\r\nas if they could not be too near and dear to each other on this lonely\r\nRock, where, just now, it seemed as if there was little else than\r\nwretchedness. Perhaps it was this feeling which led the boy to leave\r\nhis seat and stand by his uncle\'s chair, and, with one hand on the\r\ngrim man\'s shoulder, to say, "Dirk\'s child is dead, Uncle Richard, and\r\nthey\'ve just buried it. Oh! what a lonely place to be buried in! I\r\nwould rather lie in the sea, it seems to me."\r\n\r\n  Trafford turned suddenly about at these words, exclaiming, "Hush,\r\nhush! don\'t talk about death, boy! What have you been up to that\r\ndreary little heap of graves for?"\r\n\r\n  "Partly to please Dirk,--partly because I wished, Uncle Richard. It\'s\r\na dismal place! I\'m glad enough to get back."\r\n\r\n  "We shall both sleep there soon enough," said Trafford, who seemed to\r\nbe in one of his gloomiest moods. "Why go there till we go for the\r\nlast time?"\r\n\r\n  Noll\'s arm went about his uncle\'s neck. "Don\'t say such things!" he\r\nsaid. "Perhaps we\'ll not live here always, Uncle Richard; and, if we\r\ndo have to be buried up there in the sand, heaven is just as near,\r\nafter all."\r\n\r\n  Trafford looked at the boy\'s face, ruddy and glowing from the long\r\nwalk in the wind, and sighed,--\r\n\r\n  "Yes, for you, Noll. But for me,--no, no!"\r\n\r\n  "Why, Uncle Richard?"\r\n\r\n  "Because--it is all dark,--dark! I have nothing, see nothing to hope\r\nfor beyond."\r\n\r\n  "Why won\'t you try to hope?" said Noll, softly.\r\n\r\n  "Hush! it\'s no use. Your Aunt Marguerite bade me follow after her long\r\nago. I did not try. Your father said almost the same, Noll. Yet here I\r\nam,--I have not tried, I see no light, there is no hope for me."\r\n\r\n  The crackle of the fire and the hoarse voice of the sea had the\r\nsilence all to themselves for a long time. At last Noll said,--\r\n\r\n  "When papa died, he did not fear at all, Uncle Richard. He said it was\r\nonly the end of his journey, and that I was to follow on in the same\r\nway till I got to him at last. And papa said the truth, Uncle\r\nRichard."\r\n\r\n  "Yes! he never said aught else, Noll,--never!"\r\n\r\n  "And," continued the boy, his face growing grave, "papa said I was\r\nnever to forget God, and never to forget to help any of his creatures\r\nif they were in trouble, and, oh! Uncle Richard, I hope I never\r\nshall!"\r\n\r\n  "Ah!" said Trafford, thoughtfully, "your father ever had others\'\r\nwelfare at heart. I remember, when we were lads, how, one day, in\r\ncoming from the woods with nuts and grapes, we passed a poor creature\r\nby the roadside, who seemed fainting with fatigue or hunger. We both\r\nlaughed at the queer figure at first, and passed by merrily, and went\r\non our way; but Noll\'s face grew graver and graver, I remember, and by\r\nand by he would turn about, in spite of me, and go all the long way\r\nback to empty his pockets of their pennies and bits of silver into the\r\nwanderer\'s lap. Yes, he had a heart for every unfortunate, and it was\r\nnot closed against them as he grew older."\r\n\r\n  Again the room was silent, while the fire flickered and painted\r\nflame-shadows on the wall, and lit up the dusky corners with its red\r\nglow. Noll sat on the arm of his uncle\'s chair, and watched the\r\nquivering shapes, and, in fancy, went back over the sea to Hastings.\r\nIt was something such a night as this, he remembered, that papa had\r\nbidden him farewell,--lying so calm and patient in the great south\r\nchamber, where people were stepping softly about, and speaking in\r\nwhispers and sighs. And papa\'s dear arms had been around him till the\r\nlast, Noll thought, with his eyes brimming, and seeming yet to feel\r\ntheir gentle pressure; and, as long as it could whisper, the dear\r\nvoice had breathed love and solemn counsel and fervent prayer into his\r\nears. Back to the boy came the vivid recollection of all the hushed\r\nvoice had said,--all the injunctions, the earnest entreaties to follow\r\nin the path which led only heavenward, and his heart was so full that\r\nhe longed to cry out, "Papa, papa! If I might only see your face in\r\nthis dreary place!"\r\n\r\n  Trafford presently said, speaking his thoughts aloud, "It was an evil\r\nday that separated us. God only knows what I might have been, had I\r\nalways lived in the sunshine of his pure, warm heart. Why are you so\r\nsilent, Noll?"\r\n\r\n  The boy could not trust himself to speak, and Trafford suddenly saw\r\nthat there were tears shining in his eyes. Noll felt his uncle\'s hand\r\nlaid upon his head, and the stern voice said, with all the tenderness\r\nof which it was capable,--\r\n\r\n  "It\'s a hard life for you, Noll. I can see,--I know it."\r\n\r\n  "No, no!" said the boy, quickly, "it\'s not that, Uncle Richard! I was\r\nonly thinking of--of papa,--that was all."\r\n\r\n  "What about him?" queried Trafford; "I never knew that you mourned\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\n  "Why," said Noll, chokingly, "papa told me so much,--so much that he\r\nwished me to do and be,--and it all came to me just then, as if he\r\nwere saying it over again."\r\n\r\n  "What did he wish you to do and be?" Trafford quietly asked.\r\n\r\n  "He said that--that I should find Christ\'s work to do wherever I might\r\nbe, and that I must do his work and follow him wherever I should go;\r\nand--and I\'m a long way from that, Uncle Richard; though," Noll added,\r\nturning his face away from the shining firelight, "I do try to do it,\r\nand not forget him nor his work."\r\n\r\n  Again Trafford\'s hand was laid upon the boy\'s head, this time to\r\nstroke his curly locks away from his eyes, where the wind had blown\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n  "Did he tell you aught of me?" he asked, presently.\r\n\r\n  "No,--only that if you ever found me, or I you, that I was to be your\r\nboy. Papa said you would care for me."\r\n\r\n  "He believed in me still! He trusted me!" said Trafford. "Alas! he\r\nknew not what a father I should make his child."\r\n\r\n  Noll slipped off the chair arm, saying, "Don\'t say that again, Uncle\r\nRichard. Papa trusted you,--so do I. And, if you please, will you go\r\nout to supper? Hagar called a long time ago. Come, Uncle Richard,\r\ndon\'t look so gloomy! Papa smiled even when--when he was saying\r\ngood-by to me."\r\n\r\n  The instant these words escaped Noll\'s lips he half regretted them. He\r\nhad never before allowed his uncle to know that he thought him sad and\r\ngloomy, and he was not quite sure that the careless word would strike\r\nagreeably upon his ears. But Trafford only said,--\r\n\r\n  "Yes, Noll, I know. We will go out to supper," and rose from the chair\r\nand followed after his nephew.\r\n\r\n  The boy did his best to make the meal a cheery one, thinking to\r\nhimself that this, as much as anything, was a part of the work which\r\npapa wished him to do; and, observing his efforts, Trafford endeavored\r\nto keep pace with his nephew\'s cheerful talk. Noll did not go back to\r\nthe library after tea was over, but followed Hagar out to her kitchen\r\nas she went thither with her tray of dishes, and sat down in the cozy\r\ncorner by the fireplace. Somehow, the boy thought, the old\r\nhousekeeper\'s humble kitchen seemed to gather more brightness and\r\ncheerfulness into its rough and smoke-tarnished precincts than the\r\ngreat library, with all its comforts and elegancies, ever held. The\r\nreason for this he did not seek; he only knew that it was so, and\r\nliked the wooden seat in the chimney-corner accordingly. Hagar came\r\nout with her last tray-load from the dining-room, and set it down upon\r\nthe table with,--\r\n\r\n  "Bress ye, honey, Hagar\'s glad \'nough to see ye sittin\' dar. \'Pears\r\nlike I never heard de sea shoutin\' like it is dis yer ebenin\'. Seems\r\nas ef all de folks dat de cruel ole monster hab swallered wur jes\'\r\nopenin\' the\'r moufs and cryin\' \'loud! Hagar t\'anks de Lord dat yer\r\nain\'t in de bottom ob it, honey."\r\n\r\n  The old housekeeper took two or three side glances at the boy\'s sober\r\nface as she poured the hot water over her dishes, and said at last,\r\n"Now don\' ye s\'pose Hagar knows what ye\'re t\'inkin\' ob so hard, chile?\r\nKi! she c\'u\'d tell ye quicker\'n nuffin. You\'s t\'inkin\' ob dem mis\'able\r\nCulm folks, you is."\r\n\r\n  "You are partly right," said Noll. "It seems to me as if I couldn\'t\r\nthink of anything else. I try to sometimes, but the sight of their\r\nwretched ways keeps coming to me, and it\'s no use to try and put it\r\naway. Oh, dear, I wish something could be done for them!"\r\n\r\n  "Dat\'s yer bressed father all ober!" said Hagar. "\'Spects ef he was\r\n\'live an\' livin\' on dis yer wild\'ness, we\'d see somethin\' did fur \'em.\r\nBut Mas\'r Dick--well, his heart is all frizzed up, jes\' as I telled ye\r\nafore. But de Lord\'ll open it sometime, honey,--Hagar\'s got faith\r\n\'nough to b\'lieve dat!"\r\n\r\n  "Oh! I hope so," said Noll; "but what are the people going to do till\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\n  "Can\'t tell ye nuffin \'bout dat," said Hagar, making a vigorous\r\nclatter among her dishes; "\'spects the day\'s comin\', tho\', when de\r\nLord gets ready fur\'t. \'Tain\'t till _he_ says, honey."\r\n\r\n  Noll gravely replenished the fire from the great basket of cones and\r\nchips which stood on the hearth, and stood listening, for a little\r\ntime, to their brisk snap and crackle, then turned to Hagar, saying,--\r\n\r\n  "Do you think I could do anything for them, Hagar? I\'ve been thinking\r\nthis long time about it, and there\'s no one to ask but you, for I\r\ncan\'t quite get courage enough to say anything to Uncle Richard about\r\nit,--he would be angry, I\'m afraid. Do you think I could do anything,\r\nHagar?"\r\n\r\n  The old housekeeper let go her dishcloth, and turned about to look at\r\nNoll, as he stood before the fire. Her eyes surveyed the lad from head\r\nto foot,--as if it was the first time she had seen him,--and after a\r\nfew minutes of silence she slowly said, "What put dat in yer head,\r\nchile?"\r\n\r\n  "I don\'t know; it\'s been there this great while. It was the misery\r\nover there, I suppose," said Noll.\r\n\r\n  "Well, well," said she, turning back to her dishes, "Hagar\'s\r\n\'stonished, she is! Does I \'spect ye ken do anything fur dem yer?\r\nBress de Lord! He\'ll help ye, honey!--he\'ll help ye! An\' ef it wa\'n\'t\r\nde Lord dat put it in yer head--Well, chile," Hagar added, "de Lord\'s\r\neberywhere, an\' \'pears to me like as ef it was his doin\'. What ye\r\nt\'ink, honey?"\r\n\r\n  Noll was looking in the rosy bed of coals, and for a few minutes made\r\nno reply; then he said, in answer to Hagar\'s question,--\r\n\r\n  "I\'d like to think that, Hagar. I\'d like to have all my thoughts and\r\nplans come from him, and I\'d like to do the Lord\'s work; for that\'s\r\nwhat I promised,--that\'s what I am trying to do."\r\n\r\n  Hagar wiped a pile of plates, and laying down her towel, said,\r\nreverently,--\r\n\r\n  "Promise, chile? Did ye promise de Lord, or who?"\r\n\r\n  After she had asked this question, she looked furtively over her\r\nshoulder at Noll, as if fearing she had asked about something which\r\nshe had no right to know.\r\n\r\n  But Noll, with hands clasped over knee, was looking straight into the\r\nfirelight, and did not appear offended; and pretty soon he said,\r\nslowly and softly, Hagar stopping her clatter to listen,--\r\n\r\n  "Before mamma died--Did you know mamma, Hagar?"\r\n\r\n  "Not muchly, chile," said Hagar; "yer Uncle Dick\'s wife was my lady."\r\n\r\n  "Well, before mamma died," continued Noll, "we used to take long walks\r\nupon the shore by the town. A great shining shore it was, I remember,\r\nand yellow like gold sometimes when the sun shone upon it."\r\n\r\n  "Like de shore ob de new Jerusalem," interposed Hagar, gazing\r\nabstractedly in her dish-pan.\r\n\r\n  "And there were great cedars and pines drooping down from the rocks,"\r\ncontinued Noll, "and here mamma and I used to walk up and down when\r\npapa was busy in his study; and almost always he used to come out to\r\nwalk a little with us before we were through. And one day we waited a\r\nlong time for him to come out, and at last sat down on a rock, for\r\nmamma was not well then, and could not walk long without a rest; and\r\nas she looked across the smooth water, she said, \'And the building of\r\nthe wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto\r\nclear glass.\' Though I was a good deal smaller than I am now, I knew\r\nwhat she meant, and of what she was thinking, for mamma used to talk\r\nabout leaving me then; and I laid my head in her lap and cried a\r\nlittle, and said,--\r\n\r\n  "\'Oh, don\'t talk of that, mamma, for what am I going to do?\'"\r\n\r\n  Noll choked a little here at the remembrance, and Hagar drew a long\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n  "Then," continued Noll, with a quivering voice, "she bent her face\r\nover me and the tears in her eyes ran over on to my cheeks, and she\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n  "\'Oh, my little Noll, if mamma could feel sure that you were ready to\r\ncome after her into that city, she would never cry or mourn again!\'\r\n\r\n  "It seemed as if my heart would break to see her cry and to know that\r\nI was _not_ ready, and that I could not stop her tears. I wanted to\r\nscream and groan, my heart swelled so."\r\n\r\n  "Ob course ye did," said Hagar, with ready sympathy.\r\n\r\n  Noll was silent for a long minute. Somehow, the talk with Uncle\r\nRichard in the library had brought back the remembrance of all these\r\npast events so brightly and vividly that it was like living them over\r\nagain. But he had not yet got to the "promise," and Hagar was waiting\r\npatiently. So he continued, with a slight effort, saying,--\r\n\r\n  "Mamma dried her tears very suddenly, for papa came in sight just\r\nthen, and I suppose she feared he would be worried or anxious about\r\nher, and though she said nothing more to me about the city to which\r\nshe was going, I couldn\'t forget her tears, nor that she was sorrowful\r\nand unhappy on my account. It made me miserable. I didn\'t want to walk\r\nwith her the next day, for fear I should see her tears again; and I\r\nknew I could not bear _that_. So when it came time to go, I hid away,\r\nand she went alone."\r\n\r\n  "Poor honey!" said Hagar, reflectively.\r\n\r\n  "But that only made it all worse. I knew that I was all wrong, and\r\nthat I ought to try and find Jesus, through whom, mamma said, she\r\ncould only enter into the city. But it seemed as if he had hidden away\r\nfrom me; and the way was all dark and I was afraid and wretched and\r\nmiserable."\r\n\r\n  "Oh, chile," said Hagar, "de bressed Lord was waitin\' an\' ready to\r\ntake ye up in his arms de berry minnit ye frowed yerself on his\r\nmercy!"\r\n\r\n  "Yes," said Noll, "but I was not ready. I held back, and was wicked\r\nand wretched; but it couldn\'t last alway, and one night when I had\r\nsaid my prayer and been tucked in bed by mamma\'s poor weak, patient\r\nhands, I could delay no longer, and throwing my arms about her neck\r\nwhen she bent down to kiss me, I cried and sobbed, and begged her to\r\nhelp me find Jesus, who reigned over the city, and mamma cried\r\ntoo,--tears of joy they were, she said,--and told me that I had not to\r\nseek for him as for a great stranger, but that he stood ready to enter\r\nin and dwell in my heart the moment I yielded it up to him."\r\n\r\n  "Dat was de bressed troof!" said Hagar, with shining eyes; "an\' what\r\ndid ye do den, honey?"\r\n\r\n  "Mamma called papa to come, and he prayed that Jesus would forgive me\r\nand make my heart his own, and help me to always walk in the path that\r\nends at last at the gate of his city. And," Noll added, turning partly\r\nabout to Hagar, "I did give up, and--and I think he forgave me. The\r\ndreary load went off my heart, and I promised Jesus then to never\r\nforget him nor his work. When mamma did at last go to the city, I\r\npromised her the same; when papa went, I promised him too. That is my\r\npromise," said Noll, a little tremulously. "Do you think I can forget\r\nit, Hagar? Do you think I can help wanting to do what is his work?"\r\n\r\n  Hagar wiped her eyes. "\'Spects dere\'s no need ob answerin\' dat\r\nquestion," said she, quietly; "when de Lord\'s wid ye, dar ain\'t nobody\r\ngwine to \'vent yer workin\' good, nohow."\r\n\r\n  "But I don\'t know how to begin," said Noll, "even if I could do\r\nanything. There\'s so much to be done, and I\'ve nothing to do with. And\r\nI\'m afraid that Uncle Richard will forbid me to do anything about it.\r\nHe doesn\'t want me to go to Culm, he says, and he dislikes the Culm\r\npeople."\r\n\r\n  Hagar did not know what consolation to offer for this unfavorable\r\nprospect. She could not counsel the boy to disobey his uncle\'s\r\ncommands, neither did she accept the idea of having Noll\'s projects\r\ndefeated for lack of permission to carry them out.\r\n\r\n  "Don\' know, honey," said she, after a long meditation; "can\'t tell ye\r\nnuffin \'bout dat, nohow. But jes\' go right on wid yer plans, an\' de\r\nLord\'ll find a way fur ye. He ken do it,--he ken do it, chile."\r\n\r\n  But the question was not settled in Noll\'s mind. It was not a thing to\r\nbe undertaken without much deliberation, and, as yet, only the vaguest\r\nof schemes floated through his mind. He wished to aid, he longed to be\r\ndoing something of the work that was to be done, but there did not\r\nseem to be the smallest prospect of a commencement.\r\n\r\n  Christmas came and went. The eve was not an unpleasant one to Noll,\r\nthough he remembered all too well what a blithe evening the last\r\nChristmas-eve had been, and could not help thinking yearningly of the\r\ndear friends gathered merrily together across the sea, and wonder\r\nwhether he was missed from the throng, as he sat by the fire all the\r\nsolitary evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE WINTER\'S WANING.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dirk\'s little one was not the only fever-stricken sleeper that was\r\nlaid to rest in the dreary little burying-ground that winter. The\r\nfever, born of want and filth and exposure, lingered among the\r\nwretched huts, taking down the strong men and wasting the lives of the\r\nlittle ones, till, after weary lingering, they flickered out. Of\r\ncourse the sick ones had but the poorest of care and the rudest of\r\nmedical aid. The people were disheartened and apathetic, and seemed to\r\nhave no idea of cleansing their habitations or reforming their way of\r\nliving. Noll once ventured to hint to Dirk, with whom he was more\r\nintimately acquainted than the others, that cleanliness and care might\r\ndo much toward ridding them of the haunting fever. The fisherman\r\nstared blankly at this suggestion, and replied,--\r\n\r\n  "It mought do fur the like o\' ye, lad; but we be poor folks, an\' I\r\ndon\'t think \'tw\'u\'d do the good ye think. The fever be come, an\' it be\r\ngoin\' to stay till we be all lyin\' up in the sand yender."\r\n\r\n  So the sickness lingered, meeting no resistance and no attempts to\r\ncheck its progress. It smote heaviest the little ones just toddling\r\nabout, and who had not enough of strength and endurance in their\r\nlittle bodies to resist the slowly-destroying fever. So Dirk\'s\r\ntreasure did not sleep alone in the sand, for many another father\'s\r\nwas there to keep it company. Oh! the weariness of the days, the slow\r\ndragging of the weeks! When the sickness seemed to have spent itself,\r\nand hope was beginning to flicker up, back came the destroyer and fell\r\nupon some little one whom father and mother had fondly hoped to\r\nsave,--for these Culm people, dull and ignorant though they were, had\r\na strong and passionate love for their children that showed itself\r\nmost vividly in these days of death,--and then the people settled into\r\ntheir old apathetic despair and found no light nor comfort for their\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\n  Was it any wonder that--with all this misery and death about him, and\r\nthe sight of it distressing him--Noll should grow sick at heart? The\r\ngloom of the old stone house and the desolateness of his new home,\r\nwhen compared with the one which he had left, had, at first, been all\r\nthat his fresh young spirits could bear; and, having grown to like his\r\nnew abode in a measure, he found, even then, that it would not do to\r\nremember Hastings and his friends too often; and now, in these dreary\r\ndays, the boy began to grow less cheerful and to feel an unconquerable\r\ndesire to go back to those who loved him and whose homes knew nothing\r\nof dreariness or gloom. This longing for friends he kept bravely to\r\nhimself, because he thought it was a part of his work--the work which\r\nit seemed to him was God\'s--to be as brave and cheerful as possible\r\nbefore Uncle Richard, and win him out of his gloom and moroseness. So\r\nthis yearning and desire for brighter scenes and faces was kept a\r\nsecret, and Trafford suspected nothing of it. His keen eyes, however,\r\ndetected that Noll was graver and less talkative than usual, and he\r\nbegan to look about for a reason. Some dim knowledge of the sickness\r\nand death in the village had crept in to him through Noll\'s and\r\nHagar\'s talk, and a sudden fear chilled him lest his nephew, too, was\r\nto be stricken down with the lingering fever. What if it should be so?\r\nWhat if even now the boy was oppressed with the languor and depression\r\nwhich precedes illness? With this thought torturing him, he called to\r\nNoll one afternoon from the library window, as the boy was idly\r\nwalking up and down the frozen sand. After a few minutes of waiting,\r\nNoll made his appearance at the library door, looking a little\r\nsurprised, perhaps, at this unusual summons. Trafford bade him come up\r\nto his chair, and Noll obeyed.\r\n\r\n  "Where were you all the forenoon?" questioned the uncle. "I saw you\r\nbut once after breakfast."\r\n\r\n  Noll looked as if he had much rather refrain from answering, but said,\r\nafter a few seconds of hesitation, "Over at Culm, Uncle Richard."\r\n\r\n  "At Culm!" exclaimed Trafford, sternly. "Isn\'t the fever raging\r\nthere?"\r\n\r\n  "Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n  "And you have been exposing yourself? Speak, Noll!"\r\n\r\n  "Why--yes--I suppose so, Uncle Richard. I was in the room where Hark\r\nDarby\'s little boy was sick."\r\n\r\n  Trafford stamped upon the floor with impatience. "What were you there\r\nfor?" he cried.\r\n\r\n  "To carry something that Hagar made for it to drink. There\'s no\r\ndoctor, you know; and they\'re terribly poor, Uncle Richard. Oh! if you\r\ncould only--"\r\n\r\n  "Stop! I wish to hear naught of those fish-folks," cried Trafford.\r\n"Oh! you careless lad, what can I do with you? Are you determined to\r\ncatch the fever? Are you bound to be always in danger?"\r\n\r\n  "No; but it\'s terrible over there, and--and they\'re dying with the\r\nsickness, and nothing to make them comfortable! Oh! how can I help it,\r\nUncle Richard?"\r\n\r\n  Trafford looked into the lad\'s earnest eyes and sighed. "Would you\r\nlike to take the fever and be buried with the rest up there in the\r\nsand?" he asked.\r\n\r\n  Noll shivered a little, and answered, "No, I don\'t want to die, Uncle\r\nRichard. But I think I ought to help them all I can, over there, for\r\nall that. And it\'s such a little--such a _very_ little--that I can do!\r\nOh! Uncle Richard, don\'t you think it is terrible to see them so\r\nwretched, and no one to help them?"\r\n\r\n  "I don\'t see them!" said Trafford; "I should know nothing of it but\r\nfor you, and I don\'t want you to see them or know aught of the misery\r\nor the sickness. Do you understand?"\r\n\r\n  Noll looked at his uncle as if he failed to comprehend.\r\n\r\n  "You don\'t mean that I\'m not to go there any more?" he said.\r\n\r\n  "Yes, since you are not disposed to incline to my wishes, I must\r\ncommand you. You are not to go near--"\r\n\r\n  This time it was Noll who interrupted. Before Trafford could finish\r\nhis command, the boy had taken two or three quick steps forward and\r\nclasped his arms so quickly and convulsively about the stern man\'s\r\nneck that he was startled into silence.\r\n\r\n  "Don\'t, don\'t say that, Uncle Richard!" cried Noll; "I couldn\'t mind\r\nyou if you did! It wouldn\'t be right,--when they\'re all sick and\r\nalmost starving,--and I couldn\'t do it, and it is not as papa told me\r\nto do! And--"\r\n\r\n  Trafford endeavored to release Noll\'s hold, but the boy only clung the\r\ntighter, exclaiming,--\r\n\r\n  "No, no! don\'t say it, Uncle Richard, for I couldn\'t mind you! Papa\r\nnever would wish me to! And oh, why don\'t _you_ help those poor, dying\r\npeople? Why don\'t you help them, Uncle Richard? Why don\'t you,--why\r\n_don\'t_ you?"\r\n\r\n  Surprised at this unusual vehemence on the part of his nephew,\r\nTrafford was silent, hardly knowing whether to be angry or\r\nindifferent. That this matter lay very near the boy\'s heart, he had no\r\nlonger any doubt. What could he do with him?\r\n\r\n  "Noll," said he after a long silence, "do you mean that you will not\r\nobey me?"\r\n\r\n  The boy hesitated. "In everything else, Uncle Richard," he answered,\r\nwith red cheeks and downcast eyes; "but this--but this--oh, how can\r\nyou ask me to stop? There isn\'t any one else to do anything, and it\r\nhelps a little, and they look for me to come every day; and if I did\r\nnot--oh, Uncle Richard, it would be too cruel! I can\'t do it! Do _you_\r\nthink papa would be pleased?"\r\n\r\n  "But you are mine, now, not his," said Trafford; with something like\r\ndispleasure in his tone; "aren\'t you aware of it?"\r\n\r\n  Noll said not a word, but stood with his eyes turned away from his\r\nuncle\'s, and his cheeks crimsoning, while his breath came quick and\r\nfast.\r\n\r\n  "Will you obey me or not?" Trafford asked, sternly.\r\n\r\n  Noll turned around and met his uncle\'s eye. He began to plead. His awe\r\nof his uncle seemed to have vanished for the time, and Trafford was\r\nastonished at the boy\'s earnestness and vehemence. Two or three times\r\nhe was about to put up his hand to command silence, but Noll redoubled\r\nhis pleading, and he continued to listen. All the remembrances of the\r\npast dreary weeks--the want, the slow wasting, the flickering out of\r\nlife, the dismal laying away of the poor body in the sand--came to\r\nNoll as vividly as the reality which he had witnessed, and made him\r\npray for relief with an earnestness and entreaty which ordinarily were\r\nnot his.\r\n\r\n  "Just think, Uncle Richard," said he, in conclusion, "papa would have\r\ngone to their aid long ago. He bade me do all the good I could, and\r\nyou won\'t forbid me?--oh, I know you will not!--and won\'t you help me\r\nto do more,--won\'t you, Uncle Richard?"\r\n\r\n  Trafford gloomily pushed his nephew away.\r\n\r\n  "Go!" he said; "I do not care to see you any more this afternoon."\r\n\r\n  Hardly had the boy turned away, however, before the quick thought\r\nflashed into his mind that he had failed to ask him the question for\r\nwhich he had called him. He might even now be ill, and he was sending\r\nhim away in anger!\r\n\r\n  "Noll!" exclaimed Trafford, "come back. Are you ill, my boy?"\r\n\r\n  "No, sir."\r\n\r\n  "Why are you so grave and sober of late?"\r\n\r\n  "I didn\'t know that I was, Uncle Richard."\r\n\r\n  Trafford looked keenly in his nephew\'s face, and at last drew him\r\ntoward himself. What if the fever should get a hold of the boy? he\r\nthought, anxiously. There was no aid, no succor!\r\n\r\n  "Oh, Noll," he said, as tenderly as he might, "you cannot know what a\r\nblow it would be to me to lose you. Won\'t you be careful for my sake?"\r\n\r\n  "Yes, Uncle Richard; I don\'t think there is much danger, though. It is\r\nonly the weak, half-starved ones that are ill."\r\n\r\n  A long silence followed. Then Noll asked, softly,--\r\n\r\n  "Do you give me permission to help them all I can, Uncle Richard?"\r\n\r\n  Trafford drew a great sigh, as if he felt himself to be yielding,\r\nperhaps, the boy\'s very life, and answered, "Yes."\r\n\r\n  "And you\'ll help me, too?" said Noll, brightly.\r\n\r\n  "No! Isn\'t this enough? What more would you have?"\r\n\r\n  "I thought that--that perhaps you would help a little, too,--you can\r\ndo so much more than I," said Noll.\r\n\r\n  Trafford shook his head, gloomily. "No," he said; "I can give you\r\nnothing but money. I have no heart for the work. And now I think of\r\nit, you\'ve had no allowance since you came here, Noll. I had not\r\nthought of it before. Brother Noll and I always had spending-money."\r\n\r\n  "But I\'ve no use for it," said Noll, with a little laugh; "I couldn\'t\r\nspend it if I tried, Uncle Richard!"\r\n\r\n  "You may find a use for it when the \'Gull\' begins her trips again,"\r\nsaid his uncle; "at any rate, you shall have an allowance. You will\r\nfind it on your study table every Monday morning."\r\n\r\n  Noll thanked his uncle for this kindness, but at the time, was much at\r\na loss what to do with his weekly allowance which every Monday morning\r\nbrought him. He found a use for it, however, as time will show.\r\n\r\n  After this long talk, Noll felt somewhat lighter-hearted, if for no\r\nother reason than because he had received Uncle Richard\'s permission\r\nto go on with his work of aid. Spring was not far off, and with its\r\ncoming the fever would most likely flee, and then, he thought, there\r\nwould be some hope of doing something for the Culm people. And was he\r\nnot already doing something?\r\n\r\n  To Noll, it seemed but the merest trifle; in the eyes of the poor\r\nfish-folk, his deeds were great and wonderful. All unconsciously, the\r\nboy was accomplishing one of the most difficult portions of the task\r\nwhich he had set for himself,--the winning of those rough, untaught\r\nhearts. Many an uncouth blessing was called down upon the lad\'s head\r\nas he made his appearance day after day at the doors of the\r\nhabitations which the fever had entered. His cheery, gladsome\r\npresence, the Culm folk thought, was like a ray of sunshine in the\r\ngloom of their hovels. It was curious to see how those great brawny\r\nmen confided in him, and watched to see him coming down the sands of a\r\nmorning-time, with his basket of delicacies on one arm, balanced by a\r\nbasket of more substantial food on the other. Not one of the men but\r\nwhat, in their hearts, loved the boy and blessed the day which brought\r\nhim to Culm Rock. And, quite before he was aware of it, Noll had\r\naccomplished one great object, and won the love and confidence of the\r\nfish-folk.\r\n\r\n  The snow melted and ran into the sea, the ice in the rock hollows\r\ntrickled its life away, and warmer winds and sunnier clouds gave token\r\nof the spring\'s coming; and Noll grew happier every day and looked\r\ngleefully forward to the coming of the "Gull," and the tidings which\r\nshe would bring. Often in these days, when returning from his morning\r\nround, it seemed to the boy as if his own father\'s blessing rested\r\nupon his heart, it was so light and glad, and that God\'s love was all\r\nabout him and smiling over the barren Rock and the far, wide sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nNED THORN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It was on one of the balmiest of spring afternoons that Noll went over\r\nto Culm to see a little child who was recovering from the fever. The\r\nsickness, apparently, had run its course, and the people were\r\nbeginning to take heart; and the men were overhauling their nets and\r\nmaking ready for their summer\'s work. There had been a heavy storm on\r\nthe previous evening, and Noll found quantities of brilliant\r\nsea-weeds and curious shells and pebbles on his walk along the beach,\r\nand lingered long to search for treasures and enjoy the bright\r\nloveliness of the day. Culm Rock and the great sea had never looked\r\nfairer to him than on this afternoon,--the one lying warm and silent,\r\nits great stone ribs purpling under the sun, and the other flecked\r\nwith curling ripples of snowy foam and emerald light.\r\n\r\n  It was late afternoon when he arrived at the Culm houses, and so long\r\ndid he linger that the sun was dipping in the waves before he was\r\nready to leave his little patient. He was standing in the door,\r\nswinging his basket to and fro, and on the point of taking his\r\ndeparture, when a sudden shout of voices from without turned his\r\nattention in that direction. There, slowly riding in over the waves\r\nall burnished and aflame with ruddy sunlight, was the "Gull"!\r\n\r\n  For a few short seconds Noll actually stood still with pleasure and\r\ndelight, then dropping his basket, he ran off across the sand toward\r\nthe wharf, as fast as he could go. The fishermen were already\r\ncongregating there, and their wives were standing in the doors of\r\ntheir dwellings to gaze upon the welcome sight.\r\n\r\n  The vessel\'s white wings slowly brought her round to the little wharf,\r\nrevealing the skipper\'s sturdy person, and Mr. Snape\'s long and solemn\r\nvisage. Noll could hardly wait for the craft to touch the planks, and\r\nSkipper Ben spied the lad before the "Gull" came up, with a dull thump\r\nand jar, alongside.\r\n\r\n  "Great fishes!" cried he, extending his hand to aid Noll in clambering\r\naboard, "if here ben\'t the lad, alive an\' hearty! Glad ter see\r\nye,--glad ter see ye!" shaking the boy\'s hand as if he never would\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\n  "You may believe I\'m glad to see you!" said Noll; "I never was so glad\r\nto see anything as the old \'Gull\' in my life; and oh, why didn\'t you\r\ncome earlier, skipper?"\r\n\r\n  Ben laughed. "I knowed ye hev a hard time on\'t," he said; "reckoned\r\nye\'d be glad ter see the old skipper once more. An\', lad, how goes\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n  Mr. Snape came up just here, drawling, "What ye think o\' the winters\r\ndown \'ere, now, lad?"\r\n\r\n  "They _are_ long," said Noll; "but I\'ve got through one, somehow. If\r\nit weren\'t for the sickness, and such a long time without letters, I\r\nwouldn\'t mind. Oh! skipper, haven\'t you got a great packet of \'em for\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n  "Been sick down \'ere; hev ye?" said Ben, evading Noll\'s question.\r\n"Well, that\'s wuss\'n bein\' without letters, eh, lad?"\r\n\r\n  "But haven\'t you got a bundle of \'em for me?" queried Noll. "I can\'t\r\nwait, skipper!"\r\n\r\n  The skipper began to slowly shake his head. "Sorry," he said, "but I\r\ndidn\'t bring ye nary letter this time. Don\' know but all yer frien\'s\r\nhev forgot ye, fur they didn\'t give a single scrap o\' paper to bring,\r\nnor a message, nuther."\r\n\r\n  Mr. Snape began to grin, seeing how Noll\'s face fell, and how all his\r\njoy and eagerness had suddenly vanished, and stepping along to the\r\nhatchway, made certain mysterious signs and beckonings to something or\r\nsome one, there. Noll, filled with disappointment, walked away to the\r\nstern and looked down into the green depths of water rippling there,\r\nand strove to conceal his feelings from the watchful skipper. Up from\r\nthe hatchway and along the deck came a light step,--eager,\r\nhurrying,--and before Noll could turn around, two arms had clasped him\r\nabout and held him fast against the rail, while a voice--just as full\r\nof laughter and merriness as a voice could be--cried,--\r\n\r\n  "Oh, Noll, Noll Trafford! not to know me! not to _guess_ that I was\r\nhere! Why, you dear old fellow, ain\'t I better than letters? I\'ve a\r\ngood mind to never let you look around to pay for not mistrusting that\r\nI was here! Oh, Noll!"\r\n\r\n  "Well, I be beat!" said the skipper. "I never seed a lad so\r\ndumbfounded afore. What ye goin\' to give me fur bringin\' ye sech a\r\nparcel, Master Noll?"\r\n\r\n  But Noll had only eyes and ears for his friend.\r\n\r\n  "Ned, Ned Thorn!" he exclaimed, looking at his friend with wide-open\r\neyes, as if he thought he was seeing a vision. "It is really you, only\r\ngrown a little taller!"\r\n\r\n  "Of course it is; who else should it be?" said Ned, drawing his friend\r\nout to one of the skipper\'s bales, where they could both sit down.\r\n"You\'re brown as an old salt, Noll; but you haven\'t grown a bit! Oh,\r\nbut you may believe I\'m glad to see you! I thought you\'d be dying by\r\nthis time to see some one from Hastings, and when the skipper pointed\r\nout the old stone dungeon where you live, I thought likely you were\r\ndead already. What a horrid old fortress \'tis! and weren\'t you awful\r\nhomesick? and aren\'t you terribly moped up in such quarters? and, you\r\ndear old Noll, how _have_ you managed to live it through, anyhow?"\r\n\r\n  "Beats everything at questions, that lad does," observed Mr. Snape to\r\nthe skipper; "nigh about pestered me to death, comin\' down. You\'d\r\nbetter charge double ef yer goin\' to carry him home, \'cause it\'s two\r\ndays\' work fur one man ter tend to his talk. I ben\'t goin\' to do\'t fur\r\nnothin\'."\r\n\r\n  "They ben\'t glad to see each other, eh, Jack?" said Ben; "wish there\r\nwas some prospect o\' taking t\'other home, too."\r\n\r\n  "I sh\'u\'d be \'feared the \'Gull\'\'d founder," said Mr. Snape.\r\n\r\n  Noll, in the midst of happy talk, suddenly recollected that it was\r\nafter sundown, and that Uncle Richard and the tea-table would be\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\n  "Come, Ned," he said, gleefully, "I\'d forgotten all about sunset and\r\nhome till this minute. It\'s a good long walk, and we must start."\r\n\r\n  "I\'m ready," said Ned, jumping up. "Skipper, where\'s my carpet-bag?\r\nI\'m going to stay, Noll, just as long as you\'ll keep me; and now I\'m\r\nanxious for a look inside your old dungeon and a peep at that grim\r\nold--that\'s what the skipper said he was--uncle of yours. Do you think\r\nhe\'ll scold because I\'ve come?"\r\n\r\n  "Indeed not!" said Noll; "and Uncle Richard\'s not so very grim,\r\neither. We\'ll have splendid times in the old house, and now see if you\r\naren\'t sorry when it comes time for you to leave Culm Rock."\r\n\r\n  They clambered over the "Gull\'s" side on to the wharf, and passed\r\nthrough in the little lane which the fishermen made for them, to the\r\nsmooth and shining sand, and so started for the stone house.\r\n\r\n  Ned Thorn was a boy of Noll\'s own age, and much resembled him in\r\nappearance, though, of the two, Ned was a trifle the taller. Indeed,\r\nas Mr. Snape observed, leaning over the rail and smoking his pipe\r\nwhile he watched the two lads walking briskly homeward,--\r\n\r\n  "They\'re as like as two peas, Ben,--did ye note?--only one\'s more so\r\nthan t\'other."\r\n\r\n  It seemed to Noll, while on this homeward walk, that nothing was\r\nlacking to make home pleasant, now that Ned had come. His friend\'s\r\npresence did not seem a reality, as yet, and he had to listen a long\r\ntime to Ned\'s merry chatter before he could realize that it was\r\nactually Ned Thorn who was walking beside him in this purple twilight,\r\nalong the shore of the glimmering, sounding sea.\r\n\r\n  "What a queer place!" said Ned, stopping, at the curve of the shore,\r\nto look off at the horizon, which seemed to rise higher than their\r\nheads, and turning to look at the dark wall of rock behind them; "and\r\nwhat a lonesome sound the waves make! I should have died of the blues\r\nin three weeks. And what a miserable set those fishermen are! They all\r\nseem to like you, though. Did you see how they made way for us, and\r\ntouched their caps, some of them? What a capital place to fish, off\r\nthose rocks! I\'m glad I brought hooks and lines, and--What\'s that\r\nlight ahead? A lighthouse?"\r\n\r\n  "No, only Hagar\'s kitchen window," said Noll; "Hagar\'s our black\r\ncook, and there\'s only three of us in that great house, Ned!"\r\n\r\n  "I should think you\'d lose each other! Is your uncle like your father\r\nat all?"\r\n\r\n  "No, Uncle Richard\'s not much like papa," said Noll, with sudden\r\ngraveness; "but he loves me, and--and I hope you\'ll like him, Ned."\r\n\r\n  They walked the rest of the way in silence till they came to the\r\npiazza steps under the shadow of the great stone house.\r\n\r\n  "It looks just as it did when I saw it first," said Noll,--"the sea\r\ngetting dark and shadowy and making that lonesome sound on the\r\npebbles, and oh, how I had to rap and search before I could find my\r\nway in! But come on, Ned."\r\n\r\n  Noll led his friend along the echoing hall, straight to Uncle\r\nRichard\'s library, where the lamp had been lighted.\r\n\r\n  "This is Ned Thorn, Uncle Richard," said he, as they entered, "and\r\nhe\'s come clear from Hastings to see me."\r\n\r\n  "Ned is very welcome," said Trafford, who chanced to be in a cheerful\r\nmood, "and if you boys are ready, we will go out to tea."\r\n\r\n  Noll ran on before to Hagar\'s kitchen, where he burst in,\r\nexclaiming,--\r\n\r\n  "Another plate and teacup, Hagar! Did you know that we have actually\r\ngot company? It\'s Ned Thorn, a dear friend of mine, and he\'s from\r\nHastings, and going to stay--I don\'t know how long. Will you bring\r\nthem? Is tea all ready?"\r\n\r\n  "Bress ye!" said Hagar, "I\'s \'stonished to see ye so \'cited, honey.\r\nI\'ll bring de dishes in a minnit."\r\n\r\n  The old housekeeper followed him back to the dining-room, where the\r\nnew-comer was endeavoring to interest Trafford in the account of the\r\nday\'s journey, telling it in such a sprightly manner that the grim\r\nmaster was betrayed into more than one smile.\r\n\r\n  "And now, Mr. Trafford, I\'m going to stay here in this dismal old\r\nhouse just as long as you\'ll keep me," said Ned, in conclusion. "And\r\nNoll and I are going to have tip-top good times! I don\'t know as\r\nthere\'s a thing we can have fun out of, but if there isn\'t, we\'ll\r\ninvent something. We can fish,--there\'s one consolation! Why, Mr.\r\nTrafford, what does Noll do with himself, anyhow? I think he\'s grown\r\nas sober as--as--I don\'t know what!"\r\n\r\n  "Very likely," said Trafford, with a shadow of gloom on his face;\r\n"this is a sober place. Noll has seen much of which you know nothing,\r\nand it has made him graver and more thoughtful, I suppose; yet--"\r\n\r\n  "Yet you think he\'s all the better for that?" said Ned, merrily.\r\n"Well, so do I! Papa always says I\'m too much of a rattle-box; but I\r\ncan\'t help it. I couldn\'t be sober, like Noll, if I should try; and\r\nyou wouldn\'t want me to; would you, old fellow?"\r\n\r\n  Noll looked as if he was entirely suited, now, and secretly wondered\r\nwhat Uncle Richard thought of his merry, light-hearted friend. The\r\ndays which followed were happy ones. Trafford recollected that Noll\r\nhad had a long winter of study, and granted a vacation to last during\r\nNed Thorn\'s stay; so the two boys were at liberty to fish and ramble\r\nand explore rock and sand to their hearts\' content. They gathered\r\nbasket after basket full of sea flowers and weeds of vivid dye, to be\r\npressed and packed for transportation to Hastings, and such quantities\r\nof shells, with an occasional pebble of agate or carnelian, that Ned\r\nlaughingly declared,--\r\n\r\n  "I\'ll have just all the baggage the \'Gull\' can float under, Noll. I\'ll\r\nhave to charter it to convey me and mine; for the skipper won\'t take\r\nme under any other condition, you may be sure."\r\n\r\n  And these days were merry ones too. Hagar declared, "Dat yer Thorn boy\r\nbeat eberyt\'ing dis ole woman eber seed. \'Peared like ther\' was more\'n\r\nforty boys racin\' up an\' down dem yer stairs, an\' laughin\' at de tops\r\nob ther voices. Neber seed nuffn like it, nohow! But is ye sorry,\r\nHagar? Ye knows ye isn\'t! Ye likes to hear dis yer ole house waked up\r\nan\' \'pear as ef \'twas good fur somethin\' \'sides holdin\' mis\'ry."\r\n\r\n  Noll more than once trembled lest Uncle Richard should be displeased\r\nat this unusual clamor and mirthfulness, and banish Ned in anger; but\r\nday after day passed, and Trafford made no opposition to the boys\'\r\nplans or proceedings, and apparently took quite a fancy to Noll\'s\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n  "I\'d just like to coax your uncle into playing a game of ball with\r\nus," said Ned, as the two sat on the piazza one evening at twilight;\r\n"do you suppose he would consent?"\r\n\r\n  "Uncle Richard play ball!" exclaimed Noll, laughing at the idea. "No!\r\nI would almost as soon expect to see this old stone house playing at\r\ntoss and catch."\r\n\r\n  "Well, he _is_ the strangest man!" observed Ned; "but he loves\r\nyou,--I can see that, every day,---and perhaps he\'ll come out as\r\nbright as a dollar, by and by. And--do you remember?--you was to tell\r\nme about that plan to-night. Go in, Noll dear,--I\'m all attention."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nPLANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Noll looked thoughtfully on the sea a few minutes before he said, "I\r\ndon\'t know what you\'ll say, Ned, the plan is so difficult; but I\'ve\r\nthought of it a long time,--I believe it\'s been in my head every day\r\nfor the last two months,--and it seems to me it is possible. Oh! if it\r\n_were_, I\'d be the happiest boy in the land!"\r\n\r\n  "Well, now what have you got in your head, I\'d like to know?" said\r\nNed; "tell me quickly, for I hate long speeches, you know."\r\n\r\n  "Well, in the first place, you must know I want to help those Culm\r\npeople, somehow. That\'s--"\r\n\r\n  "Yes," interrupted Ned, "they need \'helping,\' I should think! They\'re\r\nthe laziest, miserablest set of people I ever saw. Some of \'em need\r\n\'helping\' with a good, sound punching,--\'twould stir \'em up a little."\r\n\r\n  "That\'s the object of the plan, and the next thing is how to do it,"\r\ncontinued Noll. "If papa had only lived here a little time, I know it\r\nwould have been a different place, and I want to make it what he would\r\nhave made it; but, though I can\'t do that, I want to do something."\r\n\r\n  "I\'ll warrant you do!" said Ned, edging nearer his friend. "What do\r\nyou think Hagar has told me about your work this winter? You _are_ the\r\nfunniest fellow, and I don\'t see what puts such ideas in your head,\r\nanyhow!--they never get into mine."\r\n\r\n  "Well, I\'ll never get to my plan at this rate," said Noll, laughing a\r\nbit. "I don\'t believe the people will ever be any cleaner or more\r\nindustrious till they have better houses to live in, and they\'re too\r\npoor to buy lumber and make repairs. Now, if I could only accomplish\r\nthat, I think they\'d soon have some pride in keeping their dwellings\r\nnice and neat, and that would keep the fever away, and perhaps--I\r\nalmost _know_--they\'d soon be a different people!"\r\n\r\n  "My stars!" exclaimed Ned, "what\'re you thinking of? Do you really\r\nmean that--that you\'re going to repair their huts for them?"\r\n\r\n  "Yes, that is what I wish to do, and what I\'ve been planning for,"\r\nsaid Noll, peering through the dusk to see how Ned received the\r\nproject; "and do you think I\'ll succeed?--do you think it is\r\npossible?"\r\n\r\n  Ned was silent a few seconds, and the low voice of the sea rose and\r\nmurmured far up and down the beach-line and died away in a faint\r\nwhisper before he replied, "Well, I _am_ astonished! and if any one\r\nelse had proposed it, I should say they were out of their wits. Now,\r\nwhat are those dirty fishermen to you, Noll?"\r\n\r\n  "That was not the question," said Noll. "Do you think I can succeed?"\r\n\r\n  "I don\'t know,--can\'t tell,--it\'s all so sudden. Where will you get\r\nthe money? and why don\'t your Uncle Richard do the work, instead of\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n  "Uncle Richard? why, he--he doesn\'t care for the Culm people," Noll\r\nwas obliged to confess; "but as for the money, I think I can manage\r\nthat. You see, he gives me more spending-money every week than I used\r\nto have in a whole quarter,--I showed you all my savings the other\r\nnight, you remember,--and it has got to be quite a sum. Then I have\r\nabout as much more that Mr. Gray gave me when I came away, and with\r\nthis I\'ll make a commencement. The--"\r\n\r\n  "But what will your uncle say? Does he know?" queried Ned.\r\n\r\n  "No, he knows nothing about it. But he gave me permission, a long time\r\nago, to aid the Culm people, and he lets me do as I choose with my\r\nmoney. So doesn\'t my plan seem possible?"\r\n\r\n  "Yes, if you can tell where lumber and nails and a carpenter are to\r\ncome from," said Ned.\r\n\r\n  "Oh! but those will have to come down from Hastings, on the \'Gull,\' of\r\ncourse. There\'s nothing here to do with," said Noll; "and I mean to\r\ncoax Ben Tate to buy the lumber and hire a carpenter for me. You see,\r\nI\'ve got it all planned, and if it will only work!"\r\n\r\n  "My stars!" said Ned, "I didn\'t know you were such a fellow. Why, I\r\ndon\'t wonder these fish-folks all touch their hats to you,--they can\r\nafford to, I think. And, Noll, won\'t you tell me what these people are\r\nto you? I can\'t see, for the life of me! And why should you spend all\r\nyour money for them?"\r\n\r\n  Noll hesitated, not feeling certain that Ned would understand his\r\nreason, if he told him, and, looking up at the stars, which had come\r\nout in great fleets over the sea, was silent. But Ned got up, came to\r\nNoll\'s end of the step, and, sitting down beside him, said,--\r\n\r\n  "Now for your reason! I\'ll not be put off at all. Won\'t you tell me?"\r\n\r\n  "Yes, if you wish very much to know," said Noll, in a lower tone. "I\r\nthink everybody has a work to do,--a work that God gives them,--and I\r\nthink this is mine, that he has given me. And I promised always to do\r\nhis work, and I mean to do it, if I can. Besides," he added, softly\r\ntaking Ned\'s hand in his, "it is work that papa would do if he were\r\nhere, and I know that he, too, would be glad to have me do it.\r\nWouldn\'t you be anxious to get about it at once, and without waiting\r\nfor the Culm people to sink lower, if you thought it was your work\r\nand waiting for your hands? Wouldn\'t you, Ned?"\r\n\r\n  Noll\'s friend was suddenly silent. It was hardly such a reason as he\r\nhad expected to hear, and what to reply he did not know. "Noll always\r\nwas the funniest fellow ever since I knew him!" he thought to himself.\r\n\r\n  Noll waited, and tried to look into his friend\'s face, and feared that\r\nNed did not comprehend his motives, after all. At last he said, "Don\'t\r\nyou understand?"\r\n\r\n  "Oh, yes," said Ned, quickly, "but I--well--I didn\'t know what to say,\r\nand, somehow, you make me ashamed. It seems too bad for you to\r\nwaste--spend, I mean--your money for those fishermen."\r\n\r\n  "Oh, no," said Noll, "I\'ve no need of it for myself, and if I had,\r\nthey need it more than I. And, Ned, I want to beg you to help me.\r\nWill you?"\r\n\r\n  "Pshaw! I\'d be no help at all!" said Ned; "I\'m no good at such\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n  "But will you try?" said Noll, eagerly.\r\n\r\n  "Yes, if you wish. But I\'ll be sure to bother or make a mess of\r\nsomething,--see if I don\'t!"\r\n\r\n  At that instant the hall door behind them opened, and Trafford stepped\r\nout. So dark had it grown that he failed, at first, to see the two\r\nfigures on the step; but when a little stir of Ned\'s betrayed them, he\r\nexclaimed, in a tone of great relief,--\r\n\r\n  "Ah, here you are, boys! I feared that--that you were up the shore,\r\nperhaps. Come in, come in. Why do you sit here in the darkness?"\r\n\r\n  "So I say!" said Ned, briskly, and not regretting this interruption;\r\n"what _are_ we sitting here in the dark for, Noll? Let\'s go in!"\r\n\r\n  As they were groping along their darksome way to the library, Ned\r\nwhispered,--\r\n\r\n  "When are you going to begin your plan, or \'put it in execution,\' as\r\nthe books say?"\r\n\r\n  "The skipper will touch here to-morrow; I\'d like to see him then,"\r\nsaid Noll.\r\n\r\n  "Why not?" returned Ned. "We can get up early and run over to Culm\r\nbefore breakfast, and coax Ben into doing the business for you."\r\n\r\n  "We will!" said Noll, gladly, "and have the work begun at once; and I\r\nknew you\'d be willing to help. Oh, Ned, I wish you were to stay here\r\nalways."\r\n\r\n  The boys did not linger long in the library after arriving there, but\r\nwent up to Noll\'s chamber, where his little hoard of money was\r\nbrought forth and counted. Neither of the lads knew how far it would\r\ngo toward purchasing lumber, but to them the sum in hand seemed a\r\nlarge one, and they decided, after much deliberation, to place it in\r\nBen\'s hands, and trust to his judgment and discretion.\r\n\r\n  "But how is the carpenter to be paid for his labor, if this all goes\r\nfor lumber?" queried Ned.\r\n\r\n  "Why, my spending-money is accumulating all the time," said Noll, "and\r\nthough that won\'t be enough, I\'ll manage to get the rest, somehow.\r\nI\'ll write to Mr. Gray, or do something that will bring it."\r\n\r\n  They were both up at the first glimmer of dawn the next morning, and\r\non their way to Culm long before the mist had fled from off the face\r\nof the sea. They ran, and made all possible haste, and were only just\r\nin time after all; for Ben was about to stand out on the day\'s journey\r\nas they came panting and breathless on to the little wharf.\r\n\r\n  "What be wantin\' now, lads?" he cried, gruffly; "we be in a hurry to\r\nget off!"\r\n\r\n  "But you must wait a few minutes," said Ned, "for we want to come\r\naboard, skipper. We can\'t run a mile for nothing, and before breakfast\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\n  "S\'pose I shall hev ter!" grumbled Ben, as he gave them each a hand to\r\nhelp them up.\r\n\r\n  Noll brought forth his roll of money, and narrated his errand,\r\ndisclosing for what object the lumber was to be purchased. Ben sat\r\ndown and stared blankly at the boy, while Mr. Snape, who had drawn\r\nnear, looked utterly bewildered.\r\n\r\n  "Let me hear ye say that agen," said Ben, when his scattered senses\r\nbegan to return; "I think I did not hear ye rightly."\r\n\r\n  Noll repeated his errand, aided by some impatient explanations which\r\nNed threw in for the skipper\'s benefit.\r\n\r\n  "Well," said the "Gull\'s" master, as he concluded, "I be beat! Why,\r\nlad, \'tw\'u\'d be like throwin\' yer silver into the sea to spend it on\r\nthem good-fur-nothin\', shif\'less critters. An\' what be the like o\'\r\nthem to you?"\r\n\r\n  "Why," said Ned, coming to Noll\'s relief, "he want\'s to do them good.\r\nCan\'t you see through a ladder, Ben? And what we want to know is\r\nwhether you will do the business?"\r\n\r\n  The skipper was silent for a time. What was passing in his mind, the\r\nboys did not suspect, and they feared lest he should refuse. But\r\npresently he got up, saying, with gruffness which was assumed to hide\r\na sudden tenderness in the old sailor\'s heart,--\r\n\r\n  "I ken do\'t fur ye, lad, I s\'pose!--tho\' I call ye foolish all the\r\nsame. The \'Gull\' be engaged fur the next run, but the next arter that\r\nye shall hev yer boards an\' yer carpenter."\r\n\r\n  "That will be week after next," said Ned. "Hurrah for you, Ben! And I\r\nwant to engage a passage home for next week. Come, Noll, let\'s go back\r\nand let the skipper put out, if he\'s in such a hurry. A good voyage to\r\nyou, Ben!--and don\'t you forget that I\'m to go next week, now!"\r\n\r\n  "Ay, ay," said Ben, "get along with you!" and over the side went the\r\nboys, and, after a little delay, off went the "Gull" with Noll\'s\r\nprecious savings on board.\r\n\r\n  "Wait," said Noll, as they left the wharf, "there\'s Dirk Sharp out\r\nthere with his boat, ready to put off. Wait here, Ned, till I\'ve\r\nspoken with him." And Noll ran off across the sand.\r\n\r\n  Ned sat down on the wharf and watched his friend and the fisherman.\r\nThey were sufficiently near for him to note the expressions upon their\r\nfaces, and when he saw the blank look of wonder and incredulity that\r\nsuddenly came over Dirk\'s coarse features, he suspected that Noll was\r\ndisclosing his project.\r\n\r\n  "Oh, but Noll _is_ a queer fellow," he said to himself. "How can he\r\ncare for these dirty, dull-witted fellows that can\'t spell their own\r\nnames, when he is so smart and such a long, long way above them?"\r\n\r\n  But Noll, he remembered, had answered this question on the previous\r\nevening; yet Ned could hardly comprehend such motives, and so sat\r\npuzzling his head over it till his friend came back with a pleased and\r\nhappy face, to say,--\r\n\r\n  "I\'m ready now. You should have seen Dirk when I told what was going\r\nto be done! The great fellow almost cried before I could finish; and\r\nhe\'s promised to aid me in a dozen ways, at least, and promised, oh!\r\nso much besides. And it seems as if I\'ll be the happiest boy in the\r\nworld when once things are under way."\r\n\r\n  "I suppose you will be," said Ned, with something like a sigh, "and\r\nI wish I could stay and see how the huts\'ll look after you\'ve done\r\nwith them. However," he added, brightly, "I can come again\r\nsometime,--there\'s one consolation."\r\n\r\n  The fair spring days went on with the speed with which all happy days\r\nfly by, and little by little the Culm people began to talk among\r\nthemselves of the--to them--great event which was to take place so\r\nsoon. Noll overheard one old fish-wife say, "We ben\'t slick \'nough for\r\nnew housen; ther\'ll hev to be great scrubbin\' an\' scourin\' that day,\r\neh, Janet?" to her slatternly daughter-in-law; and the boy mentally\r\nprayed that this opinion would gain ground among all the fish-folk. If\r\nthere was only some one to teach the children, and save them from the\r\nutter ignorance which was their parents\', there would be great hope\r\nfor Culm, he thought.\r\n\r\n  Ned Thorn went home, and this was the only sad day which Noll knew\r\nduring the two weeks\' waiting. He could not bid Ned good-by and see\r\nthe dear, merry face fade away, as the "Gull" departed, without a\r\ngreat choking in his throat and a heaviness of heart that made one day\r\na lonely, homesick one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE WORK BEGUN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  You may be sure that Noll did not fail to be at Culm village when the\r\n"Gull" and its precious freight arrived. The sky had been overcast all\r\nday and the sea somewhat rough, so that he was not certain that Ben\r\nwould set sail from Hastings. But about half-past four in the\r\nafternoon the white wings of the skipper\'s craft hovered on the\r\nhorizon, and soon after began to loom into shape and proportion. Noll\r\nfirst descried the welcome sight while standing on the piazza steps,\r\nanxiously surveying the sea and sky. A strong and vigorous breeze bore\r\nthe "Gull" rapidly before it, and it was soon evident that it would\r\narrive at the wharf before himself, unless he started soon.\r\nRecitations were over an hour ago, and he was now at liberty to go\r\nwhere he chose, and accordingly started for Culm at once. He arrived\r\nthere some time before Ben and his craft, after all, and was forced to\r\nsit and wait impatiently. He could see the yellow lumber long enough\r\nbefore the "Gull" was in hailing distance, and knew that Ben had been\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n  The skipper came alongside at last, shouting at the top of his voice,\r\n"Ahoy, there, men! Give us a hand at this \'ere lumber, an\' be spry\r\nabout it, fur there\'s a storm brewin\', an\' I\'ve got ter be twenty mile\r\ndown the coast afore it breaks!"\r\n\r\n  The fishermen drew near at this summons, and as soon as the "Gull" was\r\nfast, they began to unload the cargo, under the carpenter\'s\r\ndirections. It was carried well up the sand to preserve it from the\r\ndash of the sea and the treachery of the tide, and Noll stood looking\r\non with a heart so full of joy and satisfaction that he forgot all\r\nabout the skipper till a gruff voice cried, "Why don\'t ye come aboard,\r\nlad? Here be sumat fur ye that come from the city. It be a mighty\r\nthick letter, somehow. Give us yer hand an\' come up, lad!"\r\n\r\n  Noll got aboard quickly enough after this intelligence, and took the\r\npacket which the skipper fished out from under his pea-jacket,\r\nsaying, "I wonder if it can be from Ned?"\r\n\r\n  "How ken I tell?" said Ben, evasively. "Best open it, lad,--best open\r\nit."\r\n\r\n  Noll quickly had the envelope open, and, holding the packet upside\r\ndown, there fell out upon the deck a thick little wad of bank-notes,\r\nwhich the wind threatened to take off into the sea before the boy\'s\r\nastonished senses returned to him. Ben prevented such a disaster,\r\nhowever, by picking up the roll and placing it in Noll\'s hand, with,\r\n"It\'s worth savin\', lad, fur \'tain\'t every bush that grows sech\r\nblossoms, eh?"\r\n\r\n  "I should think not," said Noll, still full of amazement, and\r\nhurriedly opened his letter to see where this bounty hailed from,\r\nwhile Ben walked off to assist in his craft\'s unlading. This is what\r\nNoll\'s wondering eyes found:--\r\n\r\n                         "HASTINGS, May 20th.\r\n\r\n"DEAR NOLL,--I can imagine just how your eyes are staring by this\r\ntime; but you needn\'t be alarmed, for I came by the money honestly.\r\nThis is how it was: Papa said I might have a new pony if I would save\r\nmy spending-money till I got a third of the sum which one would cost,\r\nand so, though I didn\'t hint of it to you when I was down at Culm,\r\nI\'ve been laying up and laying up, like an old miser; and last Monday\r\nmorning I found that I had got the sum, and so papa made up the rest\r\nto me. But when I thought of you and those miserable Culm people, and\r\nhow you were making a fool of yourself (as Ben T. said), I thought I\'d\r\nlike to--to--well, let pony go, and help you a bit. So here\'s the\r\nwhole sum (if you get it safe), and you\'re just as welcome as you can\r\nbe, and don\'t you make any fuss about it, for it\'s your own, and I can\r\ngo without spending-money if you can, and am willing to too. And it\'s\r\nno great denial, either, for the pony\'ll come sometime, I\'m quite\r\nsure. So don\'t you worry any more about how the carpenter is to be\r\npaid. Good-by, dear old fellow,\r\n\r\n                                             "NED THORN.\r\n\r\n  "P.S.--I was just as dismal as I could be after I got home, longing to\r\ngo back to that dreary, dismal, good-for-nothing Culm Rock. The\r\nshells, etc., got here all right. Give my respects to Uncle Richard,\r\nand tell him I\'ll come down and turn his house topsy-turvy for him\r\nagain next summer, if he wants me to. Don\'t you forget to send a\r\nletter back by Ben, now."\r\n\r\n  Noll finished this characteristic letter with something very like\r\ntears in his eyes. "The dear, generous fellow!" he thought to himself;\r\n"how could he ever bring himself to do it? for it _is_ a denial,\r\nbecause Ned is _so_ fond of a horse! And he claimed, all the time,\r\nthat he never could help at all!"\r\n\r\n  Ben came stumping along the deck with his gruff, "Well, we hev brought\r\nyer lumber an\' yer carpenter, lad,--both on \'em the best I c\'u\'d find.\r\nOne\'s \'bout stacked up on the sand, yender, and t\'other\'ll be waitin\'\r\nfur yer orders purty soon. He\'s good at his trade, John Sampson\r\nbe, an\' he\'ll do fair an\' square by ye. John ben\'t delicate\r\nneither, an\' won\'t mind the livin\' he\'ll get \'mongst these \'ere\r\ngood-fur-nothin\'s,--I looked out fur that, ye see."\r\n\r\n  "I thank you more than I can tell, Ben," said Noll, taking the\r\nskipper\'s hand; "and have you taken your pay for the freight and all\r\nthe trouble?"\r\n\r\n  "The freight be paid fur," said Ben, "an\' the trouble likewise. An\' ef\r\nye hev anythin\' more fur the \'Gull\' ter do, don\'t ye be backward, boy,\r\nabout lettin\' her know\'t."\r\n\r\n  The last of the lumber was now being dragged up the sand, and the\r\nskipper hurried away, saying,--\r\n\r\n  "Luck ter ye an\' yer undertakin\', lad! We be in a desput hurry to get\r\noff, fur we\'d stan\' a poor chance on this shore in a storm."\r\n\r\n  Noll wished the skipper a safe run to a better harbor, and went back\r\nto the wharf, where the carpenter intercepted him. He was a rough,\r\nblunt-spoken man, but was evidently "good at his trade," as Ben had\r\nsaid, and did not despair of making the Culm huts decent and\r\nhabitable; and after a long talk with him, Noll started for home, as\r\nthe afternoon was fast giving way to a gray and lowery night. His\r\nheart was full of gratitude and love to Ned, and he stopped more than\r\nonce on his homeward walk to read the letter over by the gray glimmer\r\nof twilight. At first he was more than half resolved to return the\r\nmoney, and bid his friend to buy the pony,--it seemed such a great\r\ndenial for horse-loving, mirthful Ned to make,--but as he read the\r\nletter again and again, and pondered over its contents, he began to\r\nthink that his friend had more earnestness and love for kind-doing\r\nthan he had ever suspected.\r\n\r\n  "I wronged the poor fellow," he thought to himself, "because he was\r\nso merry and careless all the time. And now he\'s sent me this great\r\nroll of bills to help those people whom he pretended to hate! Oh, I\r\nwonder if it is best to keep them?"\r\n\r\n  This question was not decided then. It took more than one day\'s\r\nthought about the matter before he at last concluded to accept Ned\'s\r\nbounty, and perhaps he would not have decided thus at all if he had\r\nbeen quite sure that his friend would not be greatly grieved and\r\noffended at having the money returned.\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile, the carpenter commenced operations. Dirk\'s house was the\r\nfirst to undergo repairs, and Noll took every opportunity to go over\r\nto Culm to see how matters were progressing. It was a great delight to\r\nhim to watch John Sampson at his labor, and note how saw and hammer\r\nand plane, guided by his strong and skilful hand, repaired the rents,\r\nbrought the shackling doors and windows to comfortable tightness, made\r\nthe crooked and twisted roofs to assume something like straight and\r\neven proportions, and righted matters generally. When Dirk\'s\r\nhabitation was thoroughly repaired, it was the wonder and admiration\r\nof all the Culm people.\r\n\r\n  "It be like what it was when I was a gal, an\' all the housen was new,"\r\nsaid one old fish-wife, who had tottered in with the others.\r\n\r\n  "Ay, mother," said Dirk, "an\' it be time we had new habits to go with\r\nthe new housen, eh?"\r\n\r\n  Noll had not allowed any good opportunities, wherein he might hint to\r\nDirk that cleanliness and industry should reign in the snug new\r\nquarters, to pass without improving them. Dirk, out of regard and\r\ngratitude to "the young master," as he called him, was willing to make\r\nthe attempt, and strove, in his bungling way, to impress his neighbors\r\nwith the fact that they were expected to reform their way of living.\r\nBut it was up-hill work for people who had lived all their life in\r\nfilth and wretchedness, and progressed but slowly. Many were the\r\nhours, after the recitations were over, that Noll spent over at the\r\nlittle village those warm days, planning with John Sampson about\r\nbroken doors and shattered beams, which were to be made strong and\r\nserviceable, or, sitting on a pile of lumber, watching the carpenter\r\nas he put in execution the plans which they had made. The children of\r\nthe village were generally playing near by, in the sand, with blocks\r\nand chips,--growing up as unlettered and ignorant as their parents.\r\nSome of them were great boys and girls,--almost as tall as Noll\r\nhimself,--and had never yet seen the inside of a book.\r\n\r\n  "If Uncle Richard would only hire a teacher," thought Noll, "and have\r\nthem grow up with some knowledge in their heads, they\'d never get so\r\nlow and wretched as their parents. But that never\'ll be, I\'m afraid.\r\nOh! if I were only rich, how quick I\'d change it all!"\r\n\r\n  But there was no prospect of any such fortune befalling him, and he\r\nusually turned away from the cluster of dirty, unkempt children with a\r\nhopeless sigh. He said, one day, while sitting on a great heap of\r\nshingles beside the carpenter,--\r\n\r\n  "What\'s to become of all these children, Mr. Sampson? Will they be\r\nleft to grow up like their fathers and mothers?"\r\n\r\n  "Well, I don\'t see much to hinder," said the carpenter, with a glance\r\nat the dirty little ones who were throwing sand over their heads.\r\n"Don\'t think you\'ll ever see many lawyers and ministers out o\' the\r\nlot."\r\n\r\n  "If there could only be a school here," continued Noll, "what a change\r\nit would make! But there\'s no teacher, no schoolroom, no nothing, and\r\nno prospect of there ever being anything!"\r\n\r\n  "Why don\'t you teach \'em yourself?" said Sampson, between the\r\ncreakings and rasping of his saw.\r\n\r\n  Noll was silent for a few minutes before he answered, "Why, to tell\r\nthe truth, I never had thought of the thing. But how can I? I don\'t\r\nhave any time till after four o\'clock."\r\n\r\n  The carpenter sawed and planed, and made no reply, being entirely\r\nindifferent to the whole matter; but his chance question had put an\r\nidea in Noll\'s head which was not out of it for that afternoon, at\r\nleast. Could he teach those idle, ignorant children? he wondered.\r\nWould they ever sit still long enough to look in a book? And where\r\ncould a room for the school be found? And where was the leisure time\r\nto come from? Noll pondered over these questions many days, and\r\nseveral times came near discarding the plan as impracticable. He knew\r\nthat he could only have the time after recitations were over for his\r\nown, and that, at the most, would be only an hour or two,--the time\r\nbetween four o\'clock and the supper-hour. He was quite sure that he\r\nwas willing to give this time to the Culm children, if it would do any\r\ngood, and if a room could be found for them to assemble in. A whole\r\nweek of days went by before he mentioned this plan to any one, and\r\nthen it was only Dirk to whom he mentioned it. The rough fisherman\r\nlooked upon reading and writing as some of the wonderful and\r\nmysterious arts to which dull and humble people like himself had no\r\nright. He looked blank and mystified at Noll\'s proposition, and\r\nexpressed himself thus:--\r\n\r\n  "I don\' know, I don\' know, lad,--we but poor folk anyway. But ye ken\r\ndo as ye like, an\' ef ye say so, the youngsters shall take ter books\r\nan\' sech, an\' ye ken hev a room where ye say, I\'ll say fur\'t. I don\'\r\nknow, I don\' know, lad; ye mus\' do as ye think it best, anyway."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE WORK PROGRESSING.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Studies at home progressed steadily under Uncle Richard\'s supervision,\r\nmeanwhile, and that grim gentleman found much more pleasure and\r\nsatisfaction in directing his nephew\'s tasks than he would have been\r\nwilling to acknowledge. The boy brought so much brightness and\r\npleasant life into the gloomy stone house that the stern master, as\r\nweek after week passed by, visibly began to lose something of his\r\ngrimness and gloominess, and to take something like a faint interest\r\nin what was passing around him. And, after a time, he himself began to\r\nbe sensible of this gradual change which was stealing over his\r\nthoughts and actions, and, vexed with himself, strove to check these\r\nnew emotions, and wrap himself again in the cloak of sadness and\r\nmelancholy which so long had shielded him from everything bright and\r\ncheerful and happy. But he found it hardly an easy task. Noll was\r\nalmost always blithe and light-hearted, and Trafford found his bright\r\ninfluence a hard one to struggle against. He loved the boy so well\r\nthat it was almost an impossibility to harden his heart to all his\r\nwinning ways and pleasant talk, which met him so constantly, and\r\nthese summer days, which Noll found such delight in, were days of\r\nstruggle and wavering to his uncle. He could not but acknowledge to\r\nhimself that he was interested in all the boy\'s plans for the\r\nfuture,--all his youthful anticipations of happiness and success,--all\r\nhis present little projects for progress and self-improvement,--and\r\nthese matters, trivial though they may have been, gradually drew his\r\nthoughts from himself and his sorrow, put them farther and farther\r\naway into the dimness and silence of the past, and made the present a\r\nmore vivid and earnest reality. Was it any wonder that, seeing he\r\ncould not maintain his gloom and grimness in Noll\'s sunshine, and\r\nfinding it slipping away from him in spite of his endeavors to retain\r\nit, he should astonish his nephew by strange fits of moroseness,\r\nalternating with the utmost kindness and indulgence?\r\n\r\n  The boy sometimes fancied that his uncle had grown to utterly dislike\r\nhim,--being so irritable and unjust at times; then again his heart was\r\nlight with joy and hope, for he fancied that the grim man was just on\r\nthe point of losing his great burden of gloom, and becoming hopeful\r\nand unoppressed. But how could he be hopeful for whom there was no\r\nhope?--who refused to trust in God\'s promises?--for whom the shadow of\r\nthe grave was utter darkness and horror, wherein dear faces had\r\nvanished--forever?\r\n\r\n  One day Noll had begged him to come out for a walk on the beach,\r\nthinking he would lead his uncle on and on till they should come out\r\nupon Culm village, and in this manner disclose what he had been doing\r\nfor the dwellings and their inmates.\r\n\r\n  Trafford at first appeared inclined to consent, and followed his\r\nnephew out as far as the piazza steps, but here he stopped, and all\r\nNoll\'s entreaties could not prevail upon him to go further. He sat\r\ndown, looking dispiritedly across the tranquil sea, all warm and fair\r\nwith changing lights, and down at his feet at the bit of verdure which\r\nNoll had caused to flourish by dint of much seed-sowing and watering,\r\nsaying, "No, I\'ve no part in it all. I\'ll go no further."\r\n\r\n  So Noll was obliged to set off for Culm alone, consoling himself with\r\nthe thought that next time, perhaps, he should be so successful as to\r\nget Uncle Richard a little farther, and next time a little way farther\r\nstill, till, at last, they might walk together as uncle and nephew\r\nshould. Would that happy day ever come? he wondered.\r\n\r\n  At last, after many delays and hindrances, the plan of a school was\r\ndecided upon. Noll did not begin the undertaking with much confidence\r\nof success, or with any great hope of making the Culm children very\r\nbright or vigorous scholars; but it would be something toward\r\nsupplying the great want, he thought, and who could tell what this\r\nlittle beginning might lead to? So, about half-past four one misty,\r\nlowery afternoon, he found himself in a little room in Dirk\'s\r\ndwelling, with ten dirty-faced, frowsy-headed children huddled\r\ntogether in one corner, each of them regarding him with wide-open\r\neyes, and apparently without the remotest idea what they were there\r\nfor. The only furniture which the "schoolroom" could boast were two\r\nrough benches, just from John Sampson\'s hands, and a three-legged\r\nstool, which Noll appropriated to himself. Of course none of the ten\r\nhad anything in the shape of books or primers, and here the boy had\r\nreason to rejoice that all his old school-books had made the journey\r\nwith himself to Culm.\r\n\r\n  After getting the wondering assemblage seated in proper order, Noll\r\nbegan by asking, "Who wants to learn to read?"\r\n\r\n  It seemed as if the sound of his voice had wrought a spell, for each\r\nof the ten were as silent as so many mutes.\r\n\r\n  "Who would like to know how to read?" Noll repeated.\r\n\r\n  Still a long silence, most discouraging to the teacher. At last--the\r\nsound of his voice a most welcome one to Noll--a little fellow, who\r\nsat on the end of one of the benches, ventured to query, "What be\r\n\'read\'?"\r\n\r\n  "Well," thought the would-be teacher, "I\'ve got to explain what \'read\'\r\nis before they\'ll know whether they fancy it, to be sure! I didn\'t\r\nthink of that."\r\n\r\n  Among his books was a great primer, with painted letters and pictures,\r\nand bringing this forth, he gathered the ten around him, and used all\r\nhis powers of description and story-telling to endeavor to awaken the\r\nslumbering interest of these unpromising pupils. It was a weary hour\'s\r\nwork. A few of them betrayed a slight curiosity in regard to the\r\nbright colors, which Noll endeavored to stimulate; but it soon died\r\nout, and all looked on and listened with listless attention. They\r\nappeared much more inclined to stand with their fingers in their\r\nmouths, and gaze steadfastly into Noll\'s face, than to put eyes on the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n  "If I had the alphabet stamped upon my face, I believe they\'d learn\r\nit easily enough!" he thought to himself, in despair, as, on looking\r\nup, he found the whole ten staring in his face, instead of having had\r\ntheir eyes upon the primer during his long explanation. As a last\r\nresort, he stepped out upon the sand in front of the door, and there\r\ndrew a great A.\r\n\r\n  "Now," said he, "see which of you can make a letter like that. Take a\r\nstick and try, every one of you. Look sharp, and make it just like the\r\none I\'ve made."\r\n\r\n  Thereupon, there was a great searching for sticks, and when all the\r\nlittle ones had been supplied, there was a great scratching and\r\nmarking in the sand. To Noll\'s great delight, the result was two or\r\nthree tolerable A\'s, which were allowed to stand, and the rest were\r\nbrushed away. Then a new attempt at making the wonderful symbol\r\nensued, and added another to the successful list, and so the\r\nletter-making was kept up till all the pupils had succeeded in making\r\na tolerably faithful representation of the letter. Noll began to take\r\nheart. What the children cared nothing for, when seen in the book,\r\nthey were apparently delighted to draw on the sand, and soon learned\r\nto give the proper pronunciation of the character. The night came on\r\napace, and Noll began to perceive that it was time for him to be on\r\nhis homeward way.\r\n\r\n  "Remember," he said to his pupils, who were scratching A\'s all about\r\nthe door, "you\'re not to forget this while I\'m gone. To-morrow\r\nafternoon I\'ll come again, and then I shall want to see you make it\r\nover, and you are to have a new letter, besides. Will you all be\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\n  "Yes! yes!" one after another promised; and, once more bidding them\r\nremember, Noll walked away,--the children still making the mysterious\r\ncharacter along the beach, and keeping it up till darkness came over\r\nsea and land.\r\n\r\n  "Only one letter!" Noll said to himself, as he hurried homeward. "Why,\r\nthat\'s not a tenth of what I meant to do this afternoon! What dull\r\nwits they\'ve got! and will they ever, ever learn the whole alphabet?"\r\nThe prospect did not seem very encouraging, and he was obliged to\r\nconfess himself disappointed with the result of the first day\'s\r\nlesson. "However, one can\'t tell much by the first afternoon," he\r\nthought. "Perhaps they\'ll be quicker and brighter when we\'re better\r\nacquainted."\r\n\r\n  The next afternoon he arrived at Dirk\'s house at the appointed time,\r\nand found not ten, but twelve awaiting him, sticks in hand, and all\r\neager for the lesson to commence. Noll could not refrain from laughing\r\nat the sight which the sand directly in front of the house presented,\r\ncovered as it was with A\'s of all shapes and sizes. It looked much as\r\nif a great bird, with a peculiarly-constructed foot, had been walking\r\nthere. He did not need to be assured that his pupils had all\r\nremembered yesterday\'s lesson, and proceeded at once to instruct them\r\nin the art of making B. This the young learners of the alphabet found\r\nto be somewhat more difficult of execution, but appeared to like it\r\nnone the less on that account, and, after its curves were mastered,\r\nwere much delighted with this acquisition to their stock of\r\naccomplishments.\r\n\r\n  While this second lesson was yet in progress, Dirk and one or two\r\nother fishermen came up from their boats, and stopped to look on, with\r\nwonder and astonishment written on their countenances.\r\n\r\n  "I don\' know," said Dirk, shaking his head as he eyed the mystic\r\ncharacters traced before him; "we be all poor folk, anyhow, an\' this\r\ndo beat me! Why, what be this?" he exclaimed, pointing at a letter\r\nstaring up at him from the sand at his feet.\r\n\r\n  "That be A!" said half a dozen voices at once.\r\n\r\n  "An\' what be this?" said Hark Darby, pointing to a character by his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n  "That be B!" chorused the voices again.\r\n\r\n  The two fishermen exchanged wondering glances. "That do beat me!" said\r\npoor Dirk, regarding the letters before him with much awe. "Ah, lad,"\r\nturning to Noll, "my little gal w\'u\'d liked yer teaching, an\' yer B\'s\r\nan\' A\'s, eh?" and Dirk drew his hand across his eyes.\r\n\r\n  Noll went home much encouraged after this second alphabet lesson. Time\r\nand patience would do something for these Culm children, after all, he\r\nthought. And could he have the patience and skill which was necessary?\r\n"I\'ll try,--I\'ll try hard for it!" he thought, "and pray Christ to\r\nkeep me from losing my patience and courage. It\'s his work, and he\'ll\r\nhelp me to teach them, and by winter there\'ll be something\r\naccomplished." And of his help he had great need, for patience and\r\ncourage were often sorely tried in the days which followed, and it was\r\nnot always his pupils\' obtuseness which brought the greatest strain to\r\nbear upon them. One old fish-wife, the oldest woman in the village,\r\nhad regarded the whole plan of teaching the children as suspicious and\r\nill-omened.\r\n\r\n  "It be a bad day fur us, lads," she warned, standing on Dirk\'s\r\ndoor-step among the fishermen, and looking frowningly upon Noll as he\r\ninstructed his pupils in the making of U. "It be no good fur yer chile\r\nto be ther\', Hark Darby, learnin\' ye don\' know what! Yes, lads, I say\r\nit be an evil day, and ye\'ll find no good cum from it! I warn ye, I\r\nwarn ye!" shaking her skinny forefinger and solemnly nodding her head.\r\nNoll\'s face flushed at these words, and he half resolved to go home,\r\nand leave these Culm children to their parents\' ignorance.\r\n\r\n  "I warn ye! I--" The old crone was about to continue her forebodings;\r\nbut Dirk interposed with a gruff, "Hush ye, hush ye, Mother Deb! ye\r\nbe doin\' the lad wrong. D\'ye think he be one to teach our young uns\r\nwrong, eh? Be it evil, think ye? W\'u\'d he be doin\' us a bad turn who\'s\r\nmendin\' the housen an\' makin\' us comf\'table? I\'d like ye ter show\'t,\r\nmother, ef it be!"\r\n\r\n  "Ay," said Hark Darby, "an\' ef he ken do us evil, who ha\' been so good\r\nan\' kind in the sickness, we w\'u\'d like ye ter show\'t, Mother Deb!"\r\n\r\n  The old woman said no more, but went muttering homeward, not all\r\nconvinced that Noll was not teaching the children some evil,\r\nmysterious art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE WORK FINISHED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The days went by,--busy enough for Noll with lessons and the afternoon\r\nlesson at Culm,--and John Sampson\'s labors began to draw to a close.\r\nThe carpenter had worked steadily and faithfully, and the result was a\r\ngratifying one to more than one person. True, the houses were not\r\nmodels of elegance; that was not needed; and they _did_ look somewhat\r\npatchy, with here and there a fresh new board over the old\r\nweather-beaten gray of the dwelling, and new doors staring blank and\r\nyellow out of the dinginess of their surroundings; but, if they were\r\nnot handsome, they were thoroughly repaired and now stood warmer and\r\nmore comfortable than any of the present generation of Culm people had\r\never known them.\r\n\r\n  If they could only have a coat of paint or whitewash to make them look\r\nfresh and cheerful, what an improvement it would be! Noll thought. How\r\nthe sun would gleam upon them with his last ruddy rays as he sank into\r\nthe sea! How fair and pleasant they would look from the sea, when the\r\ncoast first came upon the mariner\'s vision! It would be one bright\r\nspot against the black background of the Rock,--those twelve\r\nhouses,--if only they might have a coat of fresh white paint. But\r\nafter counting his stock of money, this desire was obliged to remain\r\nungratified; for there was the carpenter\'s bill, which would shortly\r\nbe due, and must be paid upon the completion of the work.\r\n\r\n  "The houses must wait till--till another year," Noll thought, with\r\nsomething like a sigh; "they can wait, after all, for the painting\r\nisn\'t really necessary, though it would improve them wonderfully! And\r\nI\'m thankful enough that I can pay the carpenter. Oh, but I wonder if\r\nNed ever regrets his denial, and longs for the pony?"\r\n\r\n  Letters came down from Ned Thorn with almost every trip of the "Gull,"\r\nbut not a word about the pony did they contain, nor the least sentence\r\nwhich Noll could interpret to mean a sigh or regret for the pet which\r\nhe had given up. If Ned felt any regret, it was all carefully hidden\r\nfrom his friend\'s observation, and the missives, which Noll received\r\nthrough the skipper\'s kindness, were fairly bubbling over with the\r\nbriskness and bright spirits of Ned\'s light heart.\r\n\r\n  "If they should stop coming, I don\'t know how I _could_ manage,"\r\nthought Noll; "I\'m afraid Culm Rock would grow dreadfully lonesome and\r\ndreary." It was always, "And how do you get on with your plan?--and\r\nare the houses \'most finished?" or, "Have you got those Culm savages\r\nalmost civilized, you dear old Noll?--and does Uncle Richard know\r\nanything about it yet? Won\'t he stare! and what do you suppose he\'ll\r\nsay?" or, "Oh, now I think of it, how many scholars in Latin have you\r\ngot down there? and how do they manage with their Greek? And are you\r\nputting on airs because you\'ve got to be a pedagogue? And how much is\r\nthe tuition a term?--because, you see, I\'ve some idea of going away to\r\nboarding-school, and yours might suit me, if the charges aren\'t too\r\nhigh." And the whole generally concluded with, "P. S.--I don\'t mean a\r\nword of all that last I\'ve written, my dear Noll, and you\'re not to\r\nthink so. How does the money hold out? Don\'t fail to let me know if\r\nyou\'re in a tight place, and I\'ll try to get a few dollars somehow.\r\nAnd hurry up and answer this letter by return steamer (what should we\r\ndo if the old \'Gull\' went to the bottom?), and so good-night," etc.,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n  Perhaps Noll expected a great deal too much of the Culm people when he\r\nlooked to see them give up their filthy and slovenly habits at once,\r\nafter getting fairly settled again in their whole and comfortable\r\nabodes. If he really expected to see this, he was disappointed. People\r\ndo not follow a habit for the best part of a lifetime, to give it up\r\nsuddenly and at once, even when gratitude and a sense of their\r\nshort-coming are both urging them to do so. So he was obliged to\r\ncontent himself with some few faint evidences of thrift, and a desire\r\nto do better, on the part of those whom he had befriended, and wait\r\npatiently for the rest.\r\n\r\n  Dirk\'s household improved somewhat. Dirk was the most intelligent of\r\nthe fishermen, and began to dimly perceive that it was much better and\r\npleasanter to live cleanly and neatly than to pattern his household\r\narrangements after the beasts of the field. He was, moreover, strongly\r\nactuated to reform his way of living by his deep, strong sense of\r\ngratitude to Noll, which led him to endeavor to accomplish whatever\r\nthe boy suggested. It gave the stalwart fisherman something like a\r\nfeeling of shame to see the lad--bright, fresh, and ruddy--enter his\r\ndirty and smoke-begrimed hovel and hardly be able to find himself a\r\nseat among the litter of old nets, broken chairs, household utensils,\r\nand all conceivable kinds of rubbish which strewed the floors and\r\nfilled the corners.\r\n\r\n  "It be a shame," Dirk said to his wife, after Noll had gone, one day,\r\n"that the lad hev ter stan\' up, an\' ben\'t able ter find a seat, nohow.\r\nI tell ye it be a shame, woman!"\r\n\r\n  "Ye might mend the chairs a bit, man!" retorted Mrs. Sharp. "I\'ll\r\nwarrant the lad be able ter find a seat then."\r\n\r\n  Dirk was sulky for a while after this, but saw that there could be\r\nnothing to sit upon so long as the chairs were for the most part\r\nlegless, and at last got energy enough to mend them after a rude\r\nfashion. Then another place was found for the old nets besides the two\r\ncorners by the fireplace, and when these had been removed, Mrs. Sharp\r\ntook her broom and--well, it was not exactly sweeping, for the woman\r\nhad not much idea of what a good housekeeper would call sweeping, but\r\nit was a feeble attempt at cleanliness, and she really thought she had\r\nmade a great exertion, and was certainly proud of the achievement.\r\nDirk chanced to be at home when Noll came again, and the flash of\r\nsurprise and pleasure which swept over the boy\'s face as he entered\r\nand noted the change which had taken place since his last call pleased\r\nDirk amazingly.\r\n\r\n  "Here be a seat fur ye, lad," he said, not without some pride in his\r\ntone, as he brought forward a rough three-legged block and placed it\r\nfor his visitor. A faint stir of worthy ambition having slightly\r\nroused Dirk and his wife, they were hardly contented to allow matters\r\nto remain as they were. Mrs. Sharp once more took her broom, and used\r\nit with rather better effect. Dirk made an onslaught upon the rubbish\r\nwhich had been collecting in their kitchen and about the doorsteps for\r\nyears, and which no one had had the energy to remove, and threw many a\r\nbasketful into the sea.\r\n\r\n  The neighbors, meanwhile, were not entirely insensible to the fact\r\nthat Dirk\'s house began to present--both within and without--a much\r\nmore cleanly and respectable appearance than their own. They stopped\r\nat the door to look in and say, "La, ye be slickin\' up finely, Dirk!"\r\nor, "Ye be gittin\' fine ways, lately, man. An\' what be all this fur?"\r\n\r\n  "Why," Dirk would answer, "I be \'shamed of livin\' like a beast, man.\r\nAn\' the young master be wishin\' us to hev cleaner housen an\' slicker,\r\nan\' I be willin\' to do\'t ef he wish, now! He be a good lad to mend our\r\nhousen so finely, and w\'u\'d ye think I ben\'t willin\' to do his wish?"\r\n\r\n  Noll was greatly encouraged at these signs of improvement, and\r\nmentally rejoiced, hoping to see this new ambition spread till the\r\nwhole twelve houses were reclaimed from their present filth and\r\nwretchedness.\r\n\r\n  The carpenter\'s work came to an end at last,--his labor all plain and\r\nvisible to every eye in patched walls, roofs, mended doors and\r\nwindows, and the general look of repair about the whole line of what\r\nwere once but the poorest of shelters. Sampson\'s task had been a hard\r\nand bothersome one,--"Couldn\'t ha\' got another man to teched it," the\r\nskipper said,--and Noll expected, as he walked around to Culm one\r\nafternoon with his roll of bills to pay the carpenter, that the bill\r\nwould be a large one,--perhaps even more than Ned\'s generous bounty\r\nand his own amount of spending-money, saved since the lumber was\r\npurchased, could meet. He found Sampson packing up his tools,--he was\r\nto leave on the "Gull" the next morning,--with the bill all ready,\r\nadded up and written out on a bit of smooth shingle. It proved to be\r\nfive dollars less than the sum which Noll held in his hand.\r\n\r\n  "I swun!" said Sampson, roughly, as he counted over the bills which\r\nthe boy placed in his hands, "I told the skipper, comin\' down, that\r\nyou was a born fool to be layin\' out your money in this style. Now,\r\nI\'ve been thinkin\' on\'t over all the while I\'ve been hammerin\' and\r\nsawin\', and I can\'t make out, to save my neck, how you\'re goin\' to get\r\nany return from this \'ere investment. \'Tain\'t payin\' property, I\r\nshould judge," said the carpenter, looking up and down the beach.\r\n\r\n  "Of course I don\'t expect to get any money back from it," said Noll,\r\nlaughing a little at the idea. "It was to help these fish-folk and to\r\ntry and make them more comfortable that I did it."\r\n\r\n  Sampson put the roll of bills away in his capacious purse, remarking,\r\n"Well, you\'re a queer un. I did the job right well, though, if I do\r\nsay it, and I ha\'n\'t charged very steep for it, neither. Couldn\'t do\r\nit, somehow!--went too much against the grain. And--well, can\'t you\r\nshake hands over it? You\'re a tip-top paymaster, and if you want\r\nanything done, I\'ll come and do it, if I\'m in China--there! Don\'t you\r\nlay out another cent on this settlement, though,--\'tain\'t worth it."\r\n\r\n  Noll did not promise to take this advice, and started homeward,\r\nSampson calling after him, "Good-by, good-by, lad! Hope you\'ll get\r\nsome return from this \'ere investment!"\r\n\r\n  So the work was done, and a glad and happy letter went over the sea to\r\nHastings, telling Ned Thorn that the labor was accomplished, and the\r\nhouses all as whole and comfortable as when new, and that the people\r\nwere actually beginning to show a little thrift and ambition; and\r\nsaying, among other things, "I send you back five dollars that were\r\nleft,--so you can begin to save your money again for that pony. And,\r\noh! Ned, I don\'t think you can know how much good that money did!\r\nPerhaps you never will know (it must seem to you almost like throwing\r\nit away, because you are where you cannot see any result from it), and\r\nI felt, at first, as if you ought not to make the denial; but,\r\nsomehow, I\'m very glad, now, and I shall always feel sure that if you\r\n_do_ make fun and pretend to laugh at a plan, you\'re all the time\r\nmeaning to \'give it a lift,\' as you say. And, oh! Ned, I believe I\'m\r\none of the happiest boys in the world! and I\'m sure Uncle Richard has\r\nchanged a great deal since last spring, when you were here, for he\'s\r\ngot over being cross and gloomy, and actually asked me yesterday\r\nwhere I spent so much of my time. I\'m going, if I can, to persuade him\r\nto take a walk with me, one of these afternoons, and so bring him\r\naround to the new houses. Wouldn\'t you like to be here to see us then?\r\nAs for my school, it flourishes a little. There are still twelve\r\nscholars, and all but four have got through with their sand letters,\r\nand are at work at their \'a-b, ab,\' and \'b-a, ba.\' They\'ll get into\r\nspelling-books, sometime. Now, I\'ll end this long letter with telling\r\nyou once more that you can\'t know how much good your money has done\r\nand will do, and say,\r\n\r\n                       Good-night, "NOLL TRAFFORD."\r\n\r\n\r\n  Noll did not lose sight for a moment of his plan to persuade Uncle\r\nRichard to take a walk with him. It filled his thoughts all the\r\npleasant days that followed after Mr. Sampson\'s departure, and several\r\ntimes he hinted very broadly to his uncle that it was "a splendid\r\nafternoon for a walk! the beach is hard as a floor, and the tide out."\r\nBut Trafford was oblivious to all hints, and at last, on one warm,\r\nbalmy, cloudless afternoon, Noll thought, "It is now, or never! I\'ll\r\nask him at once." And straightway he started for the library, where he\r\nknew his uncle sat reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nA HAPPY WALK.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Trafford looked up from his books as his nephew entered, and greeted\r\nhim with a smile. Noll thought this welcome portended good, and\r\nremembered, with a grateful thrill in his heart, that Uncle Richard\r\nhad fallen into the habit of greeting him thus of late. He went up to\r\nthe reader\'s chair, and without waiting for his courage to cool, laid\r\na hand on the reader\'s arm, saying,--\r\n\r\n  "Uncle Richard, I\'ve come to ask a great favor of you. Do you think\r\nyou\'ll grant it? Can\'t you guess what it is?"\r\n\r\n  Trafford did not reply at once, but sat looking steadfastly into his\r\nnephew\'s face, his eyes wearing the dreamy, far-away look which\r\nlingered in them much of late, and it was not until Noll had repeated\r\nhis question that he replied, musingly,--\r\n\r\n  "I\'m sure I cannot think. Perhaps you wish more pocket-money, or--"\r\n\r\n  "Oh, no!" answered the boy, quickly, "it\'s nothing like that, Uncle\r\nRichard! It\'s--it\'s--oh, it\'s will you take a walk?"\r\n\r\n  Trafford\'s forehead began to wrinkle and slowly gather the shade of\r\ngloom which seemed always hovering about him, even in his most\r\ncheerful moments; but before it had time to cover the man\'s brow, and\r\nbefore he could utter a refusal, Noll\'s hand was endeavoring to\r\nsmooth away the wrinkles, and he was saying,--\r\n\r\n  "There, don\'t say \'No,\'--don\'t, Uncle Richard! I won\'t ask you to go\r\nagain if you are not pleased with this walk, but _this_ time--just\r\n_this_ once--do say \'Yes,\' uncle! There can\'t be a pleasanter\r\nafternoon in the whole year than this, and I\'ve walked alone, always\r\ntill now. Why, Uncle Richard, you won\'t say \'No\' _this_ time?"\r\n\r\n  Trafford hesitated, a refusal trembling on his lips, which he did not\r\nquite wish to utter. The boy _had_ walked alone, he remembered, and it\r\nwas a very simple request to grant; and if it was going to be such a\r\npleasure and gratification to Noll, why not yield, and for once put\r\naside his own preferences and inclinations? It is not an easy matter\r\nfor a man who has lived only for himself and his own pleasure to put\r\nthe gratification of these aside to give place to the happiness and\r\ncomfort of another; but, with an effort, Trafford put his books away,\r\nand rose from his chair, saying,--\r\n\r\n  "This once, Noll,--this once. One walk with me will suffice you, I\r\nthink. When shall we start?"\r\n\r\n  "Now,--at once, Uncle Richard!" said Noll, joyfully; "it\'s two o\'clock\r\nalready, and the tide a long, long way out. Don\'t let\'s wait a minute\r\nlonger."\r\n\r\n  Trafford smiled a little at his nephew\'s eagerness, and taking his\r\nhat, followed the boy to the piazza. It was a great change from the\r\nhalf-gloom of the library, and the chilliness of the long, dark halls,\r\nto the bright, sunny piazza, where the light fell so warm and broadly,\r\nand from whence the blue and shining sea stretched far and wide and\r\nvast.\r\n\r\n  Noll felt sure that Uncle Richard must notice it and rejoice, even\r\nthough it might be secretly. From east to west there were no clouds,\r\nand nothing to hinder the sunbeams from finding the earth and working\r\nwondrous charms on land and rock and sea. They stood for a few minutes\r\nthere, one of them, at least, enjoying the wide view very much, then\r\nNoll said,--\r\n\r\n  "We\'ll go up the shore, if you\'d as lief, Uncle Richard. It\'s much\r\npleasanter that way, I think."\r\n\r\n  "Very well," said Trafford, with an indifference which was not\r\nencouraging, and they passed down the steps on to the sand. It was a\r\nsilent and uncomfortable walk for the first few rods, Trafford walking\r\nwith his head bowed upon his breast and looking only at the yellow\r\nsand upon which he trod. He seemed to have no eyes for the calm and\r\ngentle peace which had descended upon that afternoon, robbing the sea\r\nof its terror and making it enchanting and lovely, and weaving a\r\nmystic charm about the bare, bald Rock basking warm and purple under\r\nthe sun. Even the waves murmured only softly and soothingly and with\r\ndrowsy echoes, as they rippled in and out among the rocks and along\r\nthe sand. Fortunately for their pleasure, Noll picked up a curious\r\npebble before they had gone a great way. It was not an agate, nor was\r\nit like the rounded pebbles of porphyry which the tide washed up, and\r\npuzzling over this, and asking Uncle Richard, at last, to explain its\r\nnature, somehow broke the heavy silence which had been between them,\r\nand questions and pleasant talk came naturally enough after this.\r\n\r\n  Trafford lost his gloom and reserve, and followed after his nephew,\r\nchatting and explaining strange matters of rock and sea, and stopping\r\nnow and then to pull over great bunches of freshly-stranded kelp to\r\nhelp Noll search for rare shells or bits of scarlet or purple weed\r\nwhich were hidden and entangled there. How brightly shone the sun!\r\nWhat peace and calm hovered over land and sea! He was just beginning\r\nto be conscious of the joy and loveliness which the afternoon held. It\r\nwas no wonder, he thought, that Noll\'s blithe, unclouded heart loved\r\nsuch a pleasant earth, and found delight in all the hours which\r\nflitted by. But for himself, alas! all this brightness was clouded\r\nover by the ever-present, ever-shadowing darkness of the future. It\r\nmight have been different if--if--But with a sigh Trafford put away\r\nthese thoughts, and followed on. They lingered around the rocks in\r\ntheir path, black with fringes of dry sea-weed, and talked of gneiss\r\nand sienite, granite and trap; they stopped at the curve in the shore,\r\nand sat down to watch the white flitting of sails on the far\r\nhorizon-line, and somehow, the sight of them led to a long talk about\r\nHastings and Noll\'s papa, and happy memories of other days. Trafford\r\nwas in a softened mood as they rose up from their seat on a great\r\nfragment which had fallen from the cliff above, and Noll said,--\r\n\r\n  "Come, Uncle Richard, let\'s keep on toward Culm. It\'s _so_ pleasant,\r\nand night is a long way off yet."\r\n\r\n  If he had followed his own inclinations, the uncle would have turned\r\nabout and retraced his steps, but Noll had started on, and Trafford\r\nfollowed, thinking, "It isn\'t often the boy has company in his\r\nrambles. I can humor him for once."\r\n\r\n  Slowly enough they approached the Culm houses, loitering along the\r\nmoist, shining sand, over which the waves had rolled and rippled but a\r\nfew hours before, and marking their devious path with straying\r\nfootprints. Noll\'s heart began to beat somewhat faster as they neared\r\nthe fishermen\'s houses, and he kept a keen watch upon his uncle\'s face\r\nin order to detect the first look of surprise and astonishment that\r\nshould come across it when he perceived how the huts had been\r\nimproved. But Trafford\'s eyes were turned toward the sea, thoughtfully\r\nand gravely, and they drew very near the village without the discovery\r\nbeing made. They came upon Dirk, Hark Darby, and two or three other\r\nfishermen, spreading their nets in the sun, all of whom touched their\r\nhats and nodded respectfully to Noll, eying the uncle, meanwhile, with\r\ncurious eyes and half-averted faces. The sight of these men brought\r\nTrafford\'s eyes and thoughts back to Culm and the present. He turned\r\nto Noll, saying, with a little smile,--\r\n\r\n  "Some of your sworn friends?"\r\n\r\n  "Yes, they\'re my friends, Uncle Richard," said Noll, expecting every\r\nmoment to see Trafford raise his eyes to the houses, which they were\r\npassing, "and they do me a great many favors too."\r\n\r\n  "In what way?" Trafford was about to ask; but just then he looked up\r\nand about him, and the words died on his lips. Noll paused, waiting in\r\nsuspense for what was to come next. His uncle stood still, and looked\r\nfor a full minute upon Dirk\'s house, then cast his eyes up and down\r\nthe line of dwellings, while a look of wonder and amazement came over\r\nhis face. He turned about, and looked at Noll, who could not, for the\r\nlife of him, keep the bright color from creeping up into his cheeks\r\nand over his forehead, and then he looked at the houses again. A\r\nsudden suspicion came into Trafford\'s mind, and turning his keen eyes\r\nupon Noll, he exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n  "Can you explain this?"\r\n\r\n  The nephew hesitated, looked down in some embarrassment, then\r\ngathering sudden courage, looked up and answered, brightly, "Yes,\r\nUncle Richard, I know all about it."\r\n\r\n  It was all plain to Trafford then. For a moment his own eyes faltered\r\nand refused to meet Noll\'s, and he showed some signs of emotion. But\r\nhis voice and tone were as calm as ever when he said, a few minutes\r\nafter,--\r\n\r\n  "_You_ did this? How can I believe it? What had you to do with? And\r\nwhy was I not consulted, if this was your work?"\r\n\r\n  "Oh, Uncle Richard!" said Noll, quickly, "don\'t be vexed with me. You\r\ngave me permission to help these Culm people. Don\'t you remember?"\r\n\r\n  Trafford made no reply, and again looked at the line of comfortable,\r\nwell-repaired houses. There were deeper thoughts and emotions in his\r\nheart at that moment than Noll could know or guess.\r\n\r\n  The long silence was so uncomfortable that the boy was fain to break\r\nit, with, "I\'ve one more thing to show you, Uncle Richard. It\'s not\r\nmuch,--only just a beginning,--but I\'d like you to see and know about\r\nit."\r\n\r\n  Trafford followed, without a word, and Noll led the way to the little\r\nschoolroom, with its two benches and three-legged stool and pile of\r\nwell-thumbed primers and spelling-books.\r\n\r\n  "It\'s not much," said Noll, apologetically, "but it\'s a beginning, and\r\nthey all know their letters, and some can spell a little."\r\n\r\n  Trafford evinced no surprise, much to Noll\'s wonder, and merely asked,\r\n"Where do you find the time?"\r\n\r\n  "After recitations," replied the nephew; and that was all that was\r\nsaid about the matter.\r\n\r\n  Trafford went out and sat down on the little wharf, and Noll lingered\r\nin the doorway of his schoolroom, thinking that he had never seen\r\nUncle Richard act more strangely. Was he offended at what he had done\r\nand was doing for the Culm people? he wondered. He looked out and saw\r\nthat his uncle had turned his face away, and was looking off upon the\r\nsea with the same dreamy, thoughtful look which he had noticed in his\r\neyes of late. Noll would have given a great deal could he have known\r\nhis thoughts at that moment. To human eyes this grave and thoughtful\r\nman, who sat on the wharf, was not a whit less the stern and gloomy\r\ncreature that he had been an hour before. Yet, all hidden from others\'\r\ngaze, and almost from his own consciousness, a sudden sense of regret\r\nand of a great short-coming in himself had welled up through the crust\r\nof his hardened heart. His heart had been deeply stirred, and now it\r\nsmote him. His thoughts took some such shape as this,--even while he\r\nwas looking with such apparent calmness upon the changing, shadowy\r\nlights of the sea:--\r\n\r\n  "This boy has done more in this short summer for his fellow-men and\r\nfor his God than I have done in my whole forty years of life! Oh, what\r\na life mine has been!--all a wreck, a failure, a miserable waste! And\r\nhe? Why, in this short summer-time, and on this barren Rock, he has\r\nmade his very life a blessing to every one upon it. I suppose those\r\ndirty, ignorant fishermen bless the day that brought him here. And I?\r\nO Heaven! what a failure, what a failure! I\'ve done the world no\r\ngood,--it\'s no better for my having lived in it,--it would miss me no\r\nmore than one of these useless pebbles which I cast into the sea. And\r\nthis boy--_my_ boy--always at work to make others rejoice that he was\r\nborn into the world!"\r\n\r\n  For all the calmness and repose that was on his face, he longed to cry\r\nout. Oh! was there no deliverance? Might not these long wasted years\r\nyet be paid for by deeds of mercy and charity? But where was there a\r\ndeliverer? and who could tell how many years of good deeds and charity\r\ncould pay for forty years of wasted ones?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nNEW THOUGHTS AND NEW PLANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Noll, sitting in the doorway, was presently aroused from a little\r\nreverie into which he had fallen by hearing a voice call, "Noll, my\r\nboy, come here." He obeyed the call, and started for the little wharf,\r\nhalf expecting that Uncle Richard was about to reprove him for what he\r\nhad done. Trafford gazed in his nephew\'s face for a short space, and\r\nthen, smothering what his heart longed to cry out, and what he had\r\nintended to say to the boy, he sighed only, "We will start homeward,\r\nif you are ready."\r\n\r\n  Noll was sure that his uncle had kept back something which it was in\r\nhis heart to say, and, wondering what it could be, he followed after\r\nthe tall figure along the homeward path.\r\n\r\n  The sun was getting well down into the west. The fair clearness of the\r\nsky was broken by a soft, mellow haze which began to steal across it,\r\nyet the afternoon was no less beautiful, and along the horizon there\r\nwere long and lovely trails of misty color,--faint, delicate flushes\r\nof amber and purple,--which gave an added charm to the day\'s\r\ndeclining.\r\n\r\n  Not a word did uncle and nephew speak till, as they rounded the curve\r\nof the shore, and the stone house came in sight, Trafford asked,\r\nabruptly, "Noll, where did your pocket-money go?"\r\n\r\n  The boy explained the whole matter, with an account of Ned Thorn\'s\r\nbounty and help, at the last, and then they paced along the sand in\r\nsilence, as before. Noll managed to get many looks at his uncle\'s\r\nface, and seeing that it wore no stern nor forbidding aspect, ventured\r\nto ask,--\r\n\r\n  "Are you offended with me, or what, Uncle Richard?"\r\n\r\n  Trafford took his nephew\'s hand as he replied, "Not in the least,\r\nNoll."\r\n\r\n  His voice was strangely kind and tender, and Noll exclaimed, looking\r\nup joyfully and brightly, "I\'m very glad, Uncle Richard! and do you\r\nknow your voice sounded like papa\'s just now?"\r\n\r\n  They walked hand in hand along the shore,--Noll, at least, very\r\nhappy,--and looking afar at the sea through glad and hopeful eyes. He\r\nmentally prayed that Uncle Richard\'s gloom and sternness might never\r\nreturn, and that he might always be in his present softened and\r\nsubdued mood. They came to the stone house at last, and, as they\r\nreached the steps, Noll took one long look at his uncle\'s face,\r\nthinking to himself that not soon again should he see it so gentle and\r\ntender, for the gloom of the library would soon shadow it, and make it\r\nonce more stern and forbidding. But, just as if he felt something of\r\nthis himself, Trafford lingered on the steps, as if loath to go in,\r\nand at last sat down. Noll inwardly rejoiced, and seated himself on\r\nthe bit of green which he had caused to grow, by much watering and\r\nnourishing, close beside the piazza. That little breadth of grass,\r\nwith its deep verdure, was a wonderfully pleasant thing for the eyes\r\nto rest upon in this waste of rock and sand. Trafford looked down at\r\nit and at the boy sitting there,--his curly locks blown all about his\r\nface by the warm wind,--and thought to himself, that, wherever the lad\r\nwent, brightness and pleasantness sprang up about him, even though the\r\nsoil was naught but sand and barrenness. His heart was full of\r\nreproachful cries. "What this boy has done,--and _I_!" was a thought\r\ncontinually haunting him. And he did not try to put it away; but, as\r\nhe sat there, went back over all the months of the lad\'s stay,\r\nremembering what he had done to brighten the old stone house and\r\nhimself, and contrasting all the boy\'s actions and motives with his\r\nown,--sparing himself not at all in the condemnation which his own\r\nheart was ready to pronounce. "What this boy has done,--and _I_! I?\r\nNothing, nothing! The earth will never miss me, for I have had no part\r\nin its life, and have cared naught for its joys or its sorrows; and\r\nbeyond--where this boy\'s heaven lies--there will be no place for me,\r\nbecause I have not sought it, and have cared only for my own peace. So\r\nI have no part nor place in the world or out of it." A more vivid\r\nsense of this truth came to Trafford here, and he sighed long and\r\nheavily, thinking of what might have been. He saw and felt what a\r\ngreat matter it was to have a heart wherein God\'s love dwelt so\r\nsteadfastly that eye nor ear could ever be closed against the wants of\r\nhis creatures, and the work of his that lay waiting for the doing. And\r\nit was another matter to have a heart so cold and frozen that no\r\nwarmth of his love ever thrilled it with pity or compassion,--ever\r\ndrew it with tender, gentle guidance toward himself,--ever stirred it\r\nwith longings for his love and his blessing and upholding. It was no\r\nwonder, he thought, that for one heart the earth was joyous and\r\nbeautiful, while for the other it was but a gloomy, unhappy waste; for\r\nover the pure, warm heart\'s earth God reigned, and his sunshine\r\nlighted it, and his flowers blossomed by the wayside, and they who\r\nlived in the land were his own, and their needs the needs of his\r\nchildren. All doing was but doing for God, while in a cold, frozen\r\nheart his work is not remembered, and the sunshine is but gloom,\r\nbecause it does not come from him, and the flowers are not his, and\r\nthe poor soul mourns and sorrows, wrapped up in its own darkness and\r\nchilliness, and fails to find the earth bright or beautiful.\r\n\r\n  With such thoughts as these in his heart, Trafford was silent a long\r\ntime. The sun set, and shadows began to steal over the sea, gradually\r\nand softly wrapping its farther distances in hazy indistinctness.\r\nHagar\'s voice, from the kitchen-door, where she was calling her\r\nchickens to their supper, floated around to his ears and awoke him\r\nfrom his long and sorrowful reverie. He started up, surprised to see\r\nhow fast the light had flitted from sky and earth. Noll still sat on\r\nthe bit of grass, busy over a heap of shells and pebbles, which he had\r\ngathered during his afternoon walk. Trafford looked at him a few\r\nminutes in silence, and finally asked,--\r\n\r\n  "What plans have you made for winter about your school, my boy?"\r\n\r\n  A sudden look of surprise flitted over the boy\'s face ere he answered,\r\n"I haven\'t made any, Uncle Richard. I can\'t, you see, because the days\r\nwill be so short that I\'m afraid there\'ll not be time after my\r\nrecitations. And there\'s no stove nor fireplace in the room, and not\r\nmuch of anything comfortable. But I\'m going to try, though," he added,\r\nhopefully.\r\n\r\n  Trafford was silent and thoughtful for a long time. At last he said,\r\n"What would you say if I forbade you to continue your school through\r\nthe winter?"\r\n\r\n  "I don\'t think you\'ll say that, Uncle Richard," said Noll,--not very\r\nconfidently, however. "I should be very sorry to give it up now."\r\n\r\n  "Even if I thought it best?"\r\n\r\n  Noll could not deny but that he should. "They\'re just beginning to\r\nlearn," he said, "and it would be too bad for them to lose all they have\r\ngained. Don\'t you really think so, too, Uncle Richard?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Culm Rock.]\r\n\r\n  Trafford made no reply to this question, but, when he spoke again,\r\nsaid, "Not even if another teacher filled your place, Noll?"\r\n\r\n  The boy\'s tongue was silent with wonder and astonishment. Then,\r\nthinking his ears had deceived him, he said, "Why--why--what did you\r\nsay, Uncle Richard?"\r\n\r\n  "I asked you," said Trafford, "whether you would be willing to give up\r\nthe school if another teacher took your place?"\r\n\r\n  The warm, eager color rushed into Noll\'s face, and he cried, "Do you\r\nmean that--that--a teacher might take my place, Uncle Richard? Do you\r\nreally mean it? Were you in earnest, and shall I answer?"\r\n\r\n  "To be sure," said his uncle, gravely enough.\r\n\r\n  "Oh, Uncle Richard!" cried Noll, "I _knew_ the time would come some\r\nday! I knew it! I knew it! And will you hire a teacher for those Culm\r\nchildren? Was that what you meant?"\r\n\r\n  "I do not know that they need two," said Trafford.\r\n\r\n  "Yes, I\'ll give up the school this minute!" said Noll, remembering\r\nthat he had not answered his uncle\'s question; "I\'m willing to, if the\r\nchildren can only have a teacher. Oh, but it seems too good to be\r\ntrue! And are you really going to hire some one to take my place?"\r\n\r\n  "I have hardly thought yet; you must not press questions upon me too\r\nfast. I do not know my own mind."\r\n\r\n  Hagar heard their voices, and came around the piazza corner to say,\r\n"Tea hab been waitin\' fur ye dis yer whole hour, Mas\'r Dick, an\'\r\n\'tain\'t growin\' better, nohow. Will ye hab it wait any longer?"\r\n\r\n  "No, we\'re coming, shortly," said Trafford, and presently they went in\r\nto tea, for which Noll had not the least appetite, in spite of his\r\nlong walk,--it being quite driven away by the question which his uncle\r\nhad put to him,--and he spent most of the meal-time in taking keen and\r\nwatchful looks at Uncle Richard\'s face, to see when it began to cloud\r\nover with gloom and grow stern and moody again. But the shadow which\r\nhe so much dreaded did not make its appearance, and from the\r\nsupper-table they went to the library, where Hagar had lit the lamp,\r\nNoll feeling wonderfully happy and quite sure that this was the eve of\r\na brighter day for Uncle Richard and the Culm people.\r\n\r\n  Contrary to his usual habit, Trafford did not take up his books on\r\nreaching the library, but sat looking thoughtfully at Noll, and at\r\nlast, as if speaking his thoughts aloud, he said,--\r\n\r\n  "If a new teacher comes, a new schoolroom will have to follow, as a\r\nmatter of consequence; and those two rough benches which I saw over at\r\nCulm are hardly the best style of school furniture. And how is it\r\nabout books?"\r\n\r\n  "There are none but primers and leaves from old spelling-books," said\r\nNoll, sitting very still and quiet with delight at hearing Uncle\r\nRichard ask such questions. It all seemed like a dream, and not at all\r\na matter of reality. What could have come across the man\'s feelings so\r\nsuddenly and with such effect?\r\n\r\n  Trafford resumed his inquiries after a short silence, and little by\r\nlittle drew from his nephew the whole story of the school\'s\r\ncommencement, and what drawbacks the lack of a good room, with seats\r\nand desks and the necessary books, were, till he had made himself\r\nacquainted with all the needs of the school. He talked with Noll about\r\nthe Culm people, and listened to the boy\'s hopeful and enthusiastic\r\naccount of their slight improvement, with something that was very like\r\ninterest. But the school seemed to interest him most. He proposed that\r\na teacher be sent for to take charge of the school during the winter,\r\nand that the best room which could be found among the houses be fitted\r\nup as a schoolroom, and as nicely and warmly as possible. The teacher\r\nand the furniture would have to come from Hastings, and most likely a\r\ncarpenter would be needed. Noll thought of John Sampson at once.\r\n\r\n  So the evening passed away in planning and discussion, and when Noll\r\nwent to bed, it seemed as if all the events of the afternoon and\r\nevening were but phases of a happy dream, which morning light would\r\nbanish as unreal. His thankfulness for this token of dawn, after the\r\nlong, black, weary night of gloom through which he had struggled,\r\ncould not find words enough in which to praise God for this promise of\r\nbrighter days. He prayed that it might not be fleeting, and that\r\nmorning might not show this gleam of brightness to be only imaginary.\r\nBut the morrow came, and proved yesterday\'s events to be real and\r\ntrue, and Uncle Richard still without his stern and gloomy face, and\r\nready to perfect the plans which they had discussed the previous\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n  One day after another passed, till Noll began to be certain that\r\nUncle Richard\'s gloom and moroseness had departed from him forever.\r\nThe boy wondered and surmised, but could not account for this sudden\r\ndisappearance of the shadow. What had wrought the change so suddenly?\r\nWould it last alway? True, Uncle Richard was not cheerful yet, and he\r\nseemed to be carrying some heavy grief or sorrow about with him; but\r\nfrom his face the grimness and gloominess were gone, and Noll was sure\r\nthat there must be some little change in his heart, else he would not\r\ncare for the welfare of these Culm children.\r\n\r\n  A week or two elapsed before this new plan was put in operation, or\r\nrather before anything was done toward carrying it out. The skipper\r\nwas hardly the person to intrust with the care of finding a teacher\r\nand looking up school-books, and for a time they were in doubt and\r\nperplexity. Then Noll proposed--what he had long been wishing--to go\r\nto Hastings himself, and find such a teacher as was needed, procure\r\nthe suitable books and furniture, and bring John Sampson back with\r\nhim. It would require but a week\'s absence, and in that time all the\r\nbusiness could be done, and some happy days be spent with Ned Thorn\r\nand old friends.\r\n\r\n  Trafford hesitated a long time. Who could tell what peril the boy\r\nmight be in while crossing the sea? How could he lose him now? And,\r\nwhen once in the charmed circle of old friends and associations, would\r\nhe not dislike to return to gray and barren Culm Rock? But Noll went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nIN PERIL OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The day had dawned clear and brilliant, but as the afternoon waned, a\r\ngray curtain of ragged cloud slowly rose and hid the sun, and brought\r\nan early nightfall. The wind was strong, and the sea--calm and silvery\r\nbut a few hours before--began to toss and thunder heavily. Hagar came\r\nfrom the pine woods with a great basket of cones, just as the early\r\ndusk began to settle over the windy sea and to wrap the forest in\r\nheavy shadow, and as the old woman crossed the narrow bar of sand\r\nwhich connected Culm Rock with the main-land, the wind swept over in\r\nsuch strong gusts, and with such blinding sheets of spray, that her\r\nsafety was more than once endangered. But she reached the firm,\r\nunyielding Rock, with no worse misfortune than a drenching befalling\r\nher, and made her way to the warm and comfortable precincts of her\r\nkitchen, with many ejaculations of delight and thankfulness. The first\r\nsound which greeted her ears on entering was the long-drawn, solemn\r\nvoice of the organ.\r\n\r\n  "Wonder what Mas\'r Dick\'s got on his heart dis yer night?" she\r\nmuttered, bustling about to prepare supper; "\'tain\'t sech music as dat\r\nyer organ make lately. \'Pears like somethin\' was de matter, anyhow."\r\n\r\n  She prepared supper in the dining-room, muttering to herself about the\r\nlonesomeness and silence of the house since "Mas\'r Noll dun gone off;"\r\nand when the solitary meal was in readiness, put her head in at the\r\nlibrary-door and called her master to tea. When she had got back to\r\nher kitchen, and was standing in the open door, her grizzled head\r\nthrust out into the gathering gloom and tempest to watch the progress\r\nof the storm, she noticed that the music did not cease, but kept on in\r\nits slow and solemn measure, rising and falling and stealing\r\nplaintively in.\r\n\r\n  "Something\'s de matter, sure," Hagar said, turning about and shutting\r\nthe door; "dat ain\'t de kind of music dat Mas\'r Dick\'s made lately.\r\n\'Pears like he\'s \'stressed \'bout somethin\'! But, Hagar, ye can\'t do\r\nnuffin but jes\' trust de Lord, nohow. Ye\'d better get yer own supper,\r\nef yer Mas\'r Dick don\'t tech his."\r\n\r\n  She ate her supper and washed the dishes, and gave the little kitchen\r\na stroke or two with her broom, and yet the music from the library\r\ncame stealing in as sad-voiced and heavy as ever.\r\n\r\n  "\'Pears as if he\'d never eat his supper," Hagar grumbled; "de chile\r\ncan\'t live on music, allers, nohow. Reckon he\'ll nebber hab much\r\nsperits till he eats more. But jes\' stop yer talkin\', chile, ye can\'t\r\ndo nuffin\' but trust de Lord."\r\n\r\n  By and by the wandering notes ceased, and in the deep silence there\r\ncame up the hoarse and awful roar of the surf, with the wailing of the\r\nwind over the chimney, and filled the house with their echoes. Hagar\r\nheaped wood on the fire, drew her little low chair nearer the light\r\nand gladsome blaze, shivering and muttering as she did so. She had a\r\ngreat dread of cold and darkness, and the deep hush, broken by the\r\nclamor of the sea, made her afraid.\r\n\r\n  "De Lord\'s about," said she, drawing her old woollen shawl close\r\naround her; "de Lord\'s on de sea, an\' \'pears like nobody need be\r\nfeared when he holds it in his hand like as I holds dis yer silber ob\r\nMas\'r Noll\'s dat he lost under de rug in de dinin\'-room,"--looking\r\ndown at the shining coin which she had picked up that morning, and\r\nwondering where the boy was at that moment. "\'Pears as ef de sunshine\r\nhad been hid de whole time sence he went off to de city," she\r\nmuttered, gazing in the coals. "Wonder ef Mas\'r Dick misses him?\r\nWonder ef dis yer ole woman won\'t be tickled \'nuff to see him when de\r\nday comes? Ki! Hagar, ye knows ye will."\r\n\r\n  The roar of the sea and the cry of the wind came in again, more\r\nlonesome, sadder than ever. The old negress shivered, peered about her\r\ninto the dark corners of the kitchen, and crooned to herself,--a wild,\r\nmonotonous air, set to words which came to her lips for the\r\noccasion:--\r\n\r\n      "Oh, Hagar, don\'t ye know\r\n      De Lord\'s on de sea?\r\n      He rides on de waves,\r\n      And de wind is in his hand,--\r\n      De Lord keeps dem all!\r\n\r\n  What ye feared of, Hagar? Kase, don\'t ye know de Lord\'s in it? \'Pears\r\nlike ye done forget dat de whole time--Now!" and she broke into her\r\nrhymeless chant again. It was only a way she had got of setting her\r\nthoughts to music, drawing the words out very slowly, and weaving to\r\nand fro the while. When she had repeated her first lines, she kept on\r\nwith her thoughts, peering over her shoulder at the flickering shadows\r\nwhich the fire cast on the wall behind her, shivering with awe at the\r\nclamor without, and chanting, waveringly,--\r\n\r\n     "Oh, Hagar, don\'t ye know\r\n     De Lord\'s on de sea?\r\n     De wind blows, an\' de sky is dark,\r\n     An\' de sea _cries like a little chile_,\r\n     An\' de boats will be blowed away;\r\n     But de Lord is good, an\' mornin\' will come,\r\n     An\', oh, Hagar, sing hallelujah!\r\n     Fur de Lord is in it all!"\r\n\r\n  Here she stopped her chanting, and began to sing "Hallelujah!" softly,\r\nceasing her swaying, to look into the coals. The fire burned down to\r\nrosy embers, in which little blue-tongued flames darted up\r\nfitfully,--anon lighting up the room brilliantly, then dying away and\r\nleaving it almost in darkness,--while Hagar\'s crooning died away to a\r\nwhisper. A little gray light still shone in at the kitchen-window, but\r\nit was fast flitting. The roar of the sea became thunder, the wind\r\ngrew tempestuous. By and by the rain began to fall, sounding strangely\r\nsoft and still, when compared with the din of wind and waves.\r\n\r\n  "God bress us!" said Hagar, "dis yer is an awful night. Keep de boats\r\noff de Rock, Lord, and pity de sailors in dis yer awful storm!"\r\n\r\n  The old woman knew how the sea must look now,--yeasty, horrible, its\r\nwhite wave-caps shining through the darkness and hurrying to topple\r\nover and thunder against the rocks. To her, as she sat crouched before\r\nthe fire, it seemed to howl and scream and mourn hoarsely, like some\r\ngreat voice rending the night with lamentation.\r\n\r\n  "Call on de Lord, Hagar," she muttered frequently; "can\'t nuffin else\r\nhelp ye now!"\r\n\r\n  Sometimes she fell to chanting her thoughts,--the sound of her own\r\nvoice was pleasant to her in the loneliness,--and she piled cedar\r\nchips on the fire to see their cheerful blaze and enjoy their brisk\r\ncrackle.\r\n\r\n  "Might as well hab a candle," she said, after a time. "Git yer\r\nknittin\', chile, an\' \'pear as ef ye didn\'t distrus\' de Lord. What ef\r\nde wind is blowin\'? what ef de sea is a-screamin\'? Don\'t ye know whose\r\nwind and whose sea \'tis?" She got up to grope for a candle on the\r\nshelf over the fireplace.\r\n\r\n  "Hagar!" exclaimed a voice at the farther end of the kitchen,--a\r\nvoice so full of compressed fear and anxiety that the old negress\r\ntumbled back in her chair with affright,--"Hagar! are you here?"\r\ndemanded the voice.\r\n\r\n  "Bress ye! yes, I\'s here, Mas\'r Dick!" she answered, catching sight of\r\nhis white face by the dining-room door. "I\'s here, but ye spoke so\r\nsuddent! Jes\' wait, an\' I\'ll hab a candle in a minnit."\r\n\r\n  The candle was found, and, after a long blowing of coals and burning\r\nof splinters, began to burn dimly. Hagar set it on the table, and\r\nlooked up at her master with a start of alarm, his face was so white\r\nand anxious.\r\n\r\n  "Hagar," said he, huskily, "_Noll was to start from Hastings this\r\nmorning!_"\r\n\r\n  The old negress stood looking at him a full minute,--a fearful,\r\nlonesome minute in which the rain beat against the panes, and the\r\nawful voice of the sea filled the room,--then she sank down by the\r\nfire with a low cry.\r\n\r\n  "Lord bress us all!" she wailed, as she looked up, "fur he\'ll nebber\r\nget here, Mas\'r Dick!"\r\n\r\n  Trafford looked at her silently. Oh, that awful voice without!--the\r\nthunder, the tremble of the earth, the screaming of the wind! At\r\nlast,--\r\n\r\n  "Is ye certain sure, Mas\'r Dick? D\'ye _know_ he started? Did he say?"\r\n\r\n  "Oh, Hagar, if I did not--_not know_,--if I had any doubt that he\r\nstarted, I would give all my possessions this very moment!"\r\n\r\n  "\'Tain\'t de money nor de lands dat\'ll do now!" moaned Hagar, beginning\r\nto sway back and forth; "it\'s only de Lord! De Lord\'s on de sea\r\nto-night, an\' \'tain\'t fur man to say! Oh, Mas\'r Dick! t\'ink o\' dat\r\nbressed boy in dese waves an\' dis wind!"\r\n\r\n  "Hush!" said the master, imperatively, "I will _not_ think of it! It\r\ncan\'t be! Noll? Oh, Hagar, I believe I\'m going mad!" He turned away\r\nfrom the old negress and opened the door. The tempest swept in,\r\noverturning the candle and flaring up the fire, and bearing the rain,\r\nin one long gust, across the little kitchen, even into Hagar\'s face.\r\n\r\n  Trafford stood there, regardless of wind and rain, looking out upon\r\nthe sea. The mighty tumult awed him and filled his heart with a sense\r\nof man\'s utter weakness and helplessness. The foamy expanse gleamed\r\nwhitely through the night,--awful with the terror of death,--and its\r\ndeafening roar smote upon his ears, and in the slightest lull, the\r\nrain-drops fell with a soft, dull patter. Noll in it all?--in this\r\nfearful, yawning sea,--in this wild tumult of wind and rain,--in the\r\nvast waste of waves which the thick darkness shrouded, and where death\r\nwas riding? "God help me!" he cried in sudden frenzy,--"God help me!"\r\nHe looked up at the thick, black depths of sky with a groan of agony\r\nwhen he remembered his utter powerlessness. But what right had he to\r\nlook to Heaven for aid?--he who knew not God, nor sought him, nor\r\ndesired his love? The bitterness of this thought made him groan and\r\nbeat his breast. Would He--whom all his life long he had refused and\r\nrejected--hear his cries?\r\n\r\n  Hagar\'s voice came to him here through all the din and thunder,\r\nbeseeching that the door might be closed. He closed it behind him,\r\nand stepped out into the darkness. It was already past the hour for\r\nthe "Gull" to arrive, he remembered, and then a sudden thought flashed\r\nthrough his brain that beacons ought to be kindled to guide the\r\nskipper, if he were not already beyond the need of earthly guides and\r\nbeacons. And close upon this thought came a remembrance of the Culm\r\nfishermen,--stout, skilful sailors, all of them,--and a great hope\r\nfilled his heart that in them he might find aid in his extremity. And\r\nwithout waiting for a second thought, he started through the inky\r\ndarkness and the tempest for Culm village. He ran till he was\r\nbreathless. He climbed and groped his way over and along the slippery\r\nrocks, the awful voice of the sea filling his ears and goading him on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nWEARY WATCHING.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The evening wore on. They were all on the beach,--Trafford and the\r\nCulm fishermen,--and now a beacon fire streamed up into the darkness,\r\nand made the night seem even more black and intense. They had piled\r\ntheir heap of driftwood somewhat in the shelter of a great rock, and\r\naround it the men were huddled, muttering and whispering to each\r\nother, and casting sober glances at Trafford, who stood apart from\r\nthem in the shadow. Not a word had he spoken since the fire was\r\nkindled, but, grim and silent as a statue, had stood there, with his\r\neyes looking upon the gleaming sea, and the rain beating in his face.\r\nHe had worked desperately while gathering driftwood.\r\n\r\n  "The master be crazed, like," Dirk had whispered to the men as they\r\ncame in with armfuls of fuel. "D\'ye see his eyes? D\'ye see the way he\r\nbe runnin\' up an\' down, poor man?"\r\n\r\n  "Ay, an\' his lad be where many o\' your\'n an\' mine ha\' been, eh, Dirk?"\r\nsaid Hark Harby. "Mabby he ken tell what \'tis ter be losin\' his own,\r\nan\' no help fur it, eh?"\r\n\r\n  "Sh!" said Dirk; "the sea ben\'t able ter get sech a lad as his every\r\nday. If he be lost, \'tis a losin\' fur more\'n he, yender."\r\n\r\n  This was before the beacon was kindled. Now they huddled in a gloomy\r\ncircle about the hissing, sputtering fire, some crouching close to the\r\nrock to save themselves from the rain, and the others drawing their\r\nheads down into their wide-collared jackets, that bade defiance to the\r\nwet. The wind whirled and raved, and the sea thundered on. The fire\r\ncast a little pathway of light through the darkness, down to the sea\'s\r\nedge, and they could see its waves all beaten to foam as white as\r\nmilk, flecking the sand in great patches. It was an awful waiting.\r\n\r\n  By and by Hagar came down along the sand in a great hood-cloak that\r\ngave her a most weird and witchlike appearance. The fishermen looked\r\nat her with startled, suspicious eyes as the bent old figure suddenly\r\nemerged from the darkness into the full glare of the firelight. The\r\nold negress passed on to where Trafford was standing.\r\n\r\n  "I\'s here, Mas\'r Dick," she said, touching his arm, as if fain to\r\nassure him of her presence and sympathy.\r\n\r\n  He did not repel her, but said, with much of kindness in his tone,\r\n"This is no place for you, Hagar."\r\n\r\n  "De Lord\'s here," said Hagar, quietly, "an\' I\'s gwine ter stay. I\r\nisn\'t feared, Mas\'r Dick."\r\n\r\n  Trafford looked in her wrinkled, time-worn old face yearningly. This\r\nblack, ignorant old woman had something within her heart that gave her\r\na peace and serenity in this fearful hour that he envied. He felt the\r\ntruth of this as he had never felt it before. She was stayed and\r\nupheld by some invisible hand. Somehow, in her humble life, this old\r\nnegress had found some great truth which all his own study and\r\nresearch had failed to teach him. He turned about and made her a seat\r\nof boards on an old spar which lay on the sand, under the shelter of\r\nthe rock by the fire.\r\n\r\n  "T\'ank ye, Mas\'r Dick," said Hagar, tremulously, as she sat down. This\r\nunusual kindness touched her. It was like his old-time thoughtfulness\r\nand gentleness, when he was her own blithe, merry schoolboy, she\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n  The rain began to fall less heavily. Only now and then a great drop\r\nfell with a hiss and sputter into the fire; but the wind grew fiercer\r\nas the evening waned, and the thunder and pounding of the sea was\r\ndeafening. The spray dashed higher and higher, quite up to the backs\r\nof the men who huddled about the fire, and its fine mist sifted even\r\ninto Hagar\'s face and grizzled locks.\r\n\r\n  "\'Tain\'t nuffin tu what dat bressed boy is suff\'rin\'," she sighed,\r\nwiping the cold drops off her cheeks; "\'pears as ef dis ole heart \'ud\r\nsplit\'n two, thinkin\' ob it. O good Lord, bress de chile!--bress\r\nhim,--bress him!--dat\'s all Hagar ken say."\r\n\r\n  It was a weary watching. As the war of the sea grew louder and the\r\nwind fiercer, the Culm fishermen gathered into a yet closer group, and\r\nlooked with awed and sober faces in the fire. For all that these men\r\nfollowed the sea, and it was almost a native element to them, they\r\nseemed to have a great dread and awe of it. Trafford yet stood apart\r\nfrom them with his eyes looking into the dense night, and Hagar, all\r\nmuffled in her great cloak, swayed slowly to and fro with her face\r\nhidden. Oh, the suspense and agony of those minutes!--the weary\r\nwatching and waiting for--what?\r\n\r\n  It came at last. In the short space of silence between the bursting of\r\ntwo great waves, there rose a cry from out the great waste of darkness\r\nbeyond their little length and breadth of light. Trafford started and\r\nsprang forward. The men around the fire were startled from their\r\ncrouching positions by this shrill, sudden shout, and looked in one\r\nanother\'s faces and--waited. But the cry was not repeated. Then Dirk\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n  "It wur the skipper, sure. O Lord, men! but I be feared the \'Gull\' be\r\non the rocks, yender."\r\n\r\n  The sweat stood in drops on his forehead, and he slowly clinched and\r\nunclinched his great brawny hands. Trafford heard his words, and a\r\nsudden faintness like death smote him. But it passed away, and in\r\nsudden frenzy and despair he rushed up to Dirk, exclaiming,--\r\n\r\n  "How do you know, man? How can you tell? There was only a cry!"\r\n\r\n  Before Dirk could answer, there rose, clear and distinct, that one\r\nsolitary voice from out the darkness,--a fearful, appealing cry for\r\naid from some human heart out there in the awful presence of death.\r\nAnd that thrilling cry was all. It never came again. Trafford beat his\r\nbreast with agony. Then he turned upon the fishermen.\r\n\r\n  "Why do you stand here," he cried, furiously, "when they are perishing\r\nout there? My boy is there!--my boy that\'s done so much for you and\r\nyours! Will you let him drown without lifting a hand to save him?"\r\n\r\n  "It be no use to try," said the men, pointing to the surf; "boat\'s ud\r\ncrack like a gull\'s shell out there."\r\n\r\n  "But try,--only try!" shouted Trafford, in an agonized tone. "If money\r\nwill tempt you, you shall have all of mine! You shall have more than\r\never your eyes saw before! I will make you all rich!--only try,--only\r\ntry!"\r\n\r\n  "We\'d try soon enough for the young master\'s sake, an\' ye might keep\r\nyer gold," said Dirk; "but it wud be no use, an\' only losin\' of life.\r\nThe lad be beyont our help or yer gold, either."\r\n\r\n  "\'Tain\'t de money nor de lands dat\'ll do, now," moaned Hagar; "it\'s\r\nonly de Lord!"\r\n\r\n  "But think of it, you ungrateful wretches!" cried Trafford,\r\nfrantically,--"the lad has done more for you and yours than you can\r\never repay! He went across the sea this time to do you good, and it\'s\r\nfor your sakes that he\'s out in the peril yonder! Will you let him\r\ndrown without even an attempt to save him? Will you?"\r\n\r\n  Dirk shook his head. "It be no use," he said, "but we ken try. I be\r\nnot one to hev it said that I be unthankful. Here, lads, give us a\r\nhand! Ef I\'ll be riskin\' my life fur any one, \'tis fur the lad\r\nyender."\r\n\r\n  They dragged a boat down to the curling line of foam, and watching for\r\na favorable opportunity, launched it. Trafford sprang in with them,\r\nand they pushed into the darkness. It seemed hardly three minutes to\r\nthose who stood around the fire, before a great wave came riding in\r\nand threw the boat and its load upon the sand. Dirk sprang up and\r\nseized Trafford before the returning flood had engulfed him. He\r\npointed to the rent ribs of the boat, saying, as he shook himself,--\r\n\r\n  "It be as I told ye. Yer lad be beyont yer gold or yer help."\r\n\r\n  They made no more attempts. Trafford gave up the idea of a rescue, and\r\npaced up and down the sand in the very face of the surf that drenched\r\nhim at every tumble. Utterly helpless! The cold, cruel sea mocked his\r\ndespair and frenzy. It was great and mighty, and even now was\r\nswallowing his treasure, he thought, which lay almost within his power\r\nto save. So near!--and yet death between! The thought made him half\r\nwild with despair and horror. Yet there was no help,--nowhere to turn\r\nfor aid or succor,--not the faintest hope of saving the boy\'s life.\r\nThe sea must swallow him.\r\n\r\n  The fishermen looked askance at the wild, desperate figure that rushed\r\nup and down the sand as if it sought to burst through the sea and save\r\nits treasure, and whispered gloomily among themselves. Suddenly the\r\nman wheeled about and came up to the fire, crying, fiercely,--\r\n\r\n  "Hagar, you have a God! I cannot find him. Pray to him,--pray to him!\r\nQuick, woman!--pray to him before it\'s too late!"\r\n\r\n  "Lord help ye, Mas\'r Dick!" said Hagar, "I\'s jes\' prayin\' fur de dear\r\nchile ebery minnit! Don\'t ye know it? But de Lord\'s out\r\nthar!"--pointing with her skinny finger to the depths of darkness\r\nwhich shrouded the sea, with such vehemence as to startle the\r\nfishermen; "he\'s wid dat boy, and thar can\'t nuffin kill his soul.\r\nIt\'s only goin\' to glory quicker\'n de rest ob us. Don\'t ye know it,\r\nMas\'r Dick?--can\'t ye feel it? What\'s de winds or de waves, so long as\r\nde Lord\'s got ye in his arms, holdin\' ye up?--as he\'s got dat boy ob\r\nyour\'n. Oh, Mas\'r Dick! jes\' humble yerself \'fore de Lord, right off.\r\nWhat\'s de use ob stribin\' to fight him?--what\'s de use? \'Tain\'t no\r\nuse!--ye knows it dis minnit!--ye knows it all ober! Call on de Lord\r\nyerself, Mas\'r Dick!--call on de Lord \'fore it\'s too late!"\r\n\r\n  "I cannot, I cannot!" groaned Trafford, dropping down on the sand by\r\nhis old nurse; "I don\'t know him, and he will not hear me. Oh, my boy,\r\nmy boy!"\r\n\r\n  He gave up then. Hagar knew by the way he sank back upon the sand, all\r\nthe wildness and fierceness gone out of his face, and the crushed,\r\nbroken-hearted manner in which his head drooped, that he had given up\r\nthe boy. She gathered his head on her knee, as she had often done when\r\nhe was a youth, and stroked it tenderly, saying, as her tears\r\ndropped,--\r\n\r\n  "Poor chile, poor honey! Hagar\'s sorry fur ye. It\'s a dreadful t\'ing\r\nnot ter know de Lord; ain\'t it, chile? Can\'t do nuffin widout him,\r\nsomehow. But Hagar hopes ye\'ll find him; she hopes ye\'ll find him dis\r\nberry night. \'Pears like he ain\'t fur off dis awful night; an\', O Lord\r\nJesus!"--folding her hands reverently, and looking toward the sea as\r\nif she saw her Redeemer walking there,--"come an\' bress dis poor\r\nbroken heart dat can\'t find ye. It\'s jes\' waitin\' fur de bressin\',\r\nan\' \'pears like \'twould faint ter def ef ye didn\'t come. Come, Lord,\r\ncome."\r\n\r\n  The night wore slowly on. The "Gull" began to break in pieces and\r\nfloat ashore. The fishermen had enough to do to snatch the boxes and\r\nbales which the sea hurled up. As yet, none of the "Gull\'s" more\r\nprecious freight of life had made its way through the sea to the\r\nshore. Dirk was watching keenly for it. A half-dozen draggled, fearful\r\nwomen had stolen down from their houses, and were standing by the\r\nfire, whispering and talking in undertones, with many glances of pity\r\nat the figure lying prone on the sand with its head in the old black\r\nwoman\'s lap.\r\n\r\n  "Alack!" said Dirk, with a great sigh, "it wur a fine lad. I never\r\nknowed kinder nor better. Ye ken all say that, women, an\' this be the\r\nsorriest night I ever knowed, \'cept when my little gal died. He wur\r\ngood to my little gal, the lad wur, an\' he giv\' me a bit o\' flower to\r\nput on the sand where she be sleepin\', an\' it growed an\' growed an\'\r\nblossomed, an\' the blossom wur like a great blue eye,--like my little\r\ngal\'s eye,--an\' many\'s the night after fishin\' I\'ve gone up ter the\r\nburyin\'-place ter look at it. An\' now the lad himself be gone," said\r\nDirk, wiping his eyes and snuffling.\r\n\r\n  "Ay, it be a heavy night!" moaned the women, wiping their eyes with\r\nthe corners of their aprons.\r\n\r\n  A great heap of bales and boxes and bits of the "Gull\'s" timbers was\r\naccumulating on the sand by the fire. The women sat down on them,\r\nkeeping up their low talk and whispers, and watching the two silent\r\nfigures the other side of the fire. The man moved not a muscle. The\r\nold negress bent over him, stroking his forehead and whispering and\r\ncrooning. Only once he had said, chokingly, "My Noll!--all that was\r\nleft to me," and now lay passive and unheeding, overwhelmed and\r\ncrushed by the sense of his loss and the consciousness that the sea\r\nhad quenched the brave, bright life forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nWAITING.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The long, long, weary night gave way to a gray and gloomy dawn. The\r\ntempest had not abated, and the sea thundered as furiously as ever.\r\nThe wet and shivering women had gone back to their houses and their\r\nlittle ones; and as the cold, steely light of the coming day began\r\nto whiten in the east, Hagar made her way back to her kitchen,\r\nwhere she kindled a fire to warm her numb limbs. Never more, she\r\nthought,--rocking to and fro before the pleasant blaze,--could the old\r\nhouse be bright or cheerful. The sea had quenched its life and its\r\njoy, and never again would the merry voice echo in the great rooms, or\r\nthe quick, eager steps sound along the hall and in at her\r\nkitchen-door.\r\n\r\n  "O good, bressed Lord!" moaned she, "bress yer poor chil\'en dat\'s lef\'\r\nbehind! \'Pears like dey was jes\' ready ter fall down an\' faint ter def\r\nef ye didn\'t hold \'em up. O Lord, keep Hagar up, an\' \'vent her from\r\n\'strustin\' ye! Bress us, Lord, fur we ain\'t nuffin dis yer time. Ye\'s\r\nall we hab ter hold on ter."\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile, Trafford and the fishermen lingered on the shore, waiting\r\nfor the sea to give up its dead. The east grew whiter, and light\r\nbroke dimly over the waste of waves, and faintly showed them where the\r\n"Gull" had struck. There was not much left of the little craft,--only\r\na few timbers and the taper point of a mast, wedged in between some\r\noutlying rocks, which the sea thundered over. It was a dreary\r\nsight,--the vast, immeasurable waste lashed into foam, and dimly\r\ndiscerned through the gray gleaming of the dawn, with the bit of wreck\r\nswaying in the wares, where those lives had gone out in the awful\r\nthunder and darkness; but Trafford gazed upon it with a calm face.\r\nGroans and lamentation could not express the agony which rent his\r\nheart, and he walked up and down the drenched sand with a calm, white\r\nface that awed Dirk whenever he looked upon it.\r\n\r\n  "It be a heavier stroke for the master an\' we ken tell, lads," he\r\nsaid to his comrades, as they kept keen lookout for the poor bodies\r\nwhich the sea still kept.\r\n\r\n  "Ay, there be a heart within him like the rest of us," said one of the\r\nfishermen, looking at Trafford as he kept his watchful vigil; "an\' he\r\nbe only losin\' what we hev lost afore."\r\n\r\n  "But the lad wur not like ours," said Dirk, pityingly, "an\' it wur a\r\nfiner lad an\' ever I see afore."\r\n\r\n  So they talked as they watched and waited, and the light grew, and\r\nsomewhere behind the lowering banks of clouds in the east the sun had\r\nrisen, and all the land and sea lay cold and warmthless and forlorn.\r\nTrafford relinquished not his keen search for a moment, fearful lest\r\nthe waves should cast his lost treasure at his feet and snatch it back\r\nbefore he could grasp it. The dear face might be bruised and battered\r\nby the cruel, remorseless sea, and the eyes could never beam upon him\r\nwith any light of love or recognition, he thought; yet find it and\r\nlook upon it he must, even though the sight agonized him. So he\r\nwatched and waited, with his tearless eyes roaming along the line of\r\nfoam.\r\n\r\n  An hour fled. The sea relented, and gave up one poor form into the\r\nfishermen\'s hands. Trafford walked calmly out to where the men were\r\nbending over it with pale, awed faces, and saw that it was not Noll.\r\nHe shivered, looking at the skipper\'s stalwart figure, and wondered\r\nwhether, if the sailor but had the power of speech, he might not tell\r\nhim something of his boy,--whether he met death\'s dark face calmly and\r\nfearlessly, and whether he sent a message to those whom he saw on the\r\nshore and could not call to. This thought gave him fresh anguish. If\r\nNoll had sent him a farewell,--a last message,--oh, what would he not\r\ngive to hear it? But, if that were really the case, it had died with\r\nthose to whom it was intrusted. The sea would never whisper it,--the\r\ndead could not. He went back to his lonely pacing.\r\n\r\n  Another long, long hour passed. The bit of wreck that was jammed\r\nbetween the rocks went to pieces and came ashore. Ben\'s mate came with\r\nit, but no Noll. The men began to straggle homeward, weary and worn\r\nwith the night\'s vigil, till only Dirk and Hark Darby were left to\r\nkeep the stricken master of the stone house company. Oh, such a weary\r\nwaiting it was!--the ceaseless pouring of the waves upon the sand\r\nfilling their ears with clamor, and the fearful tide bringing them\r\nnot the treasure which they sought. Would the sea never give it up?\r\nWas the dear form caught and held by the entangling arms of some\r\npurple weed in the sea depths? or was it cradled in the calm,\r\nunruffled quiet of some crevice of the rocks?\r\n\r\n  "Oh, cruel, cruel sea!" he cried to himself, "to rob me of my boy, and\r\nrefuse to give back the poor boon of his body."\r\n\r\n  It never came. The morning wore on to noon, the noon to night, and\r\nstill the lonely watcher paced up and down. Toward night the tempest\r\nabated, and the turmoil of the sea subsided somewhat. The gray clouds\r\nbroke and let through a slant mist of yellow sunshine as the sun\r\ndeparted, and the storm was over. Its work was done; and as the clouds\r\nfled in ragged squadrons, the calm, untroubled stars shone out over\r\nthe sea, and mocked, with their deep, unutterable peace, the aching,\r\nwretched heart of him who still kept up his lonely pacing. Trafford\'s\r\neyes suddenly caught sight of their silvery glitter, and he stopped,\r\nlooking up at them, while the sudden thought flashed through his mind,\r\n"Is my boy up there? beyond those shining worlds, in that happy heaven\r\nwhich he trusted in?"\r\n\r\n  The thought held him silent and motionless. It had not entered his\r\nheart before. He had been searching for the lad upon this dreary,\r\nsea-beaten shore, without a thought of anything beyond. Was he really\r\nstanding upon a heavenly shore, where no waves beat nor tempest raved,\r\nand, perhaps, looking down upon his own lonely vigil?\r\n\r\n  There was something in this thought which brought a great calm upon\r\nhis heart. True, the boy was no less dead nor separated from him; the\r\nmerry voice was no less hushed to him for all his life and journeying,\r\nand the echo of his footsteps might never float down from heavenly\r\npaths to gladden his ears; yet, though he realized this, there was a\r\nwonderful peace and joy in thinking of the lad as happy and joyous in\r\na sphere where nothing would ever blight his happiness; where he had\r\nfound those who bore him a great love and had been long waiting for\r\nhis coming. Trafford sat down on the great pile of broken timbers, and\r\nonce more looked upward at the stars. Pure and unwavering their gentle\r\neyes looked down at him. And then peaceful as an angel\'s whisper, came\r\nthe remembered words of one who was an angel too: "Oh, Richard! don\'t\r\nfail--don\'t fail to find Him and cling to Him, and come up,--come up\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\n  Why, oh, why, of all times, did this gentle breathing come to him\r\nhere? It seemed to Trafford as if his wife\'s lips had whispered it\r\nclose to his ear, and he bowed his head upon his breast, while his\r\nbreath came quick and fast, and bitter tears of grief stood in his\r\neyes. Had God taken his treasures, one after another, and placed them\r\nin that heaven which they all looked forward to, that his own wayward,\r\nstraying heart might be drawn thither? Was this last loss meant to be\r\nthe great affliction which, through love, should turn his heart toward\r\nGod and his kingdom? He could not tell; his heart was strangely\r\nstirred and melted within him. It seemed to him as if that angel\r\nwhisper had driven the great burden of despair and agony out of his\r\nheart by its gentle breathing, and left it broken and sorrowful, yet\r\nnot without peace and hope. He looked up at the stars and thought of\r\nNoll, and wept. They were not tears of agony, and he did not rave and\r\ngroan. A slow step came along the sand, turning hither and thither, as\r\nif in quest of some one. It drew near Trafford, at last, and a\r\ntremulous old voice said,--\r\n\r\n  "Is dis ye, Mas\'r Dick? Hagar\'s glad \'nough ter find ye, anyhow.\r\n\'Pears like she couldn\'t stay up ter de house, nohow,--\'twas so\r\nlonesome."\r\n\r\n  "Yes, I know, Hagar," said the man, without raising his head.\r\n\r\n  The twilight was so thick that the old negress could not see the\r\nspeaker\'s face, but a certain tremble and softness of his voice did\r\nnot escape her notice.\r\n\r\n  "Have ye foun\' de Lord, Mas\'r Dick?" she asked, quickly.\r\n\r\n  "I know not what I have found," Trafford answered, while his tears\r\nfell; "but if I might find his face, and know that it smiled upon me,\r\nI should care for little else."\r\n\r\n  "Now praise de Lord!" said Hagar, fervently; "dat\'s more\'n ye ever\r\nfelt afore. Thar\'s help fur ye, Mas\'r Dick, an\' \'tain\'t fur off!"\r\n\r\n  "Too far for me to find it!" said Trafford; "he does not smile upon\r\nthose who have rejected him."\r\n\r\n  "Oh, chile!" said Hagar, in a shocked tone; "don\'t ye know de Lord\'s\r\nall mercy an\' lubbin\' kin\'ness? Don\'t ye know he won\'t \'spise an\' hate\r\nye jes\' as ef he was like a man? Oh, honey! Hagar\'s feared ter hear ye\r\ntalk like dat. \'Pears as ef ye made de Lord jes\' like poor, eble,\r\ngood-fur-nuffin man."\r\n\r\n  Trafford made no reply. A sudden darkness seemed shutting down upon\r\nhim. It was as if a great golden gleam had fallen out of heaven upon\r\nhim, warming and softening his heart, and when he turned with tears\r\nand joy to look along its pathway heavenward, it vanished and left him\r\ngroping in confusion and dismay. He got up from off his seat, saying,\r\nmournfully,--\r\n\r\n  "The brightness is all gone from me! I\'m in doubt and fear. Oh, how\r\ncan I ever find his face?--and how can he ever smile upon me who have\r\nrejected him?"\r\n\r\n  Hagar sighed heavily as she said, "Ye don\'t \'preciate de Lord, chile.\r\nYe talks jes\' as ef he was a man, an\' could feel \'vengeful towards ye!\r\nDon\'t s\'pose any _man_ could forgive ye, honey, but de bressed Lord\r\nis all lub,--Hagar knows _dat_,--an\' Jesus died jes\' as much fur ye as\r\nhe did fur anybody. Ye\'s got to look to dat bressed Lord Jesus, an\' ef\r\nye looks hard \'nough, ye\'ll find him. Oh, Hagar t\'anks de Lord frum de\r\nbottom ob her heart fur yer feelin\' so to-night."\r\n\r\n  "But I have not found him! He is hidden from me!" said Trafford.\r\n\r\n  "But ye will ef ye looks long enough!" said Hagar, cheerfully; "he\'ll\r\ncome out ob de darkness to ye: bimeby. Bress ye, chile, dis ole woman\r\nwas lookin\' an\' seekin\' an\' stribin\' in mis\'ry till she was \'bout\r\nready to give up in \'spair; but I foun\' him at las\', an\' he nebber\r\n\'sook Hagar,--nebber!"\r\n\r\n  The sea was growing calmer with every hour that passed. But it was\r\nrough and thunderous still, and its wave-crests gleamed whitely under\r\nthe starlight. Trafford at last remembered the lateness of the hour,\r\nand said, "Come, Hagar, this is no place for us. We will go in."\r\n\r\n  The two slowly made their way along the shore up to the dark and\r\ndeserted stone house. Hagar smothered the sigh that rose up from her\r\nheart as the silence and loneliness smote upon it, and led the way\r\naround to her kitchen-door.\r\n\r\n  "Poor chile! ye habn\'t had nuffin to eat dis day," said she, after\r\nthey were once within her little dominion and she had kindled the\r\nfire; "go into de libr\'y, honey, an\' I\'ll hab ye sumfin\' purty quick."\r\n\r\n  But Trafford shook his head, saying, "Not there!--not there, yet!" and\r\nsat down on the bench by the fire.\r\n\r\n  Hagar moved wearily about from the cupboard to the table, saying to\r\nherself,--\r\n\r\n  "What ye t\'inkin\' ob, Hagar, to tell him dat? Dar\'s all poor Mas\'r\r\nNoll\'s books an\' t\'ings lyin\' \'bout eberywhar, an\' how ken de poor\r\nchile stan\' it? De Lord\'s han\' is heaby upon him, an\', O good Lord\r\nJesus, jes\' come an\' bress de poor chile an\' sabe him!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nDAYS OF CALM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  He found it at last,--the peace which comes after a long, weary,\r\ndespairing struggle. But it was not easily won. It seemed to Trafford\r\nas if God had hidden himself in a thick, awful darkness, through which\r\nnot the faintest ray of light or hope could glimmer upon his heavy,\r\ndespairing heart. He sought for him as one who, feeling himself in\r\nthe grasp of Death, would seek for Life. He had long rejected him and\r\nput him away; now, in his hour of anguish and extremity, his face and\r\nhis peace were hard to find. Never had such utter silence reigned in\r\nthe stone house since its occupancy as reigned there now. Hagar kept\r\nmostly within her own province, and Trafford sat day after day in the\r\ndining-room, hardly stirring from thence. He had not entered the\r\nlibrary since the night of the shipwreck, neither had Hagar stepped\r\nwithin the room, where all Noll\'s books and shells and treasures\r\ngathered from the sea lay, and where everything hinted of the sunny,\r\njoyous life which once had made the great room cheerful. Neither\r\nlooked within, as if they dreaded to recall the dear and pleasant\r\nvision of the curly-haired boy who had lived and studied there. These\r\nwere the days in which Trafford groped in darkness and despondency.\r\nHagar set the table by his side, and brought him his meals, and\r\ncarried away the untasted viands, with much sighing and regret, but,\r\nnevertheless, with joy in her heart.\r\n\r\n  "\'Pears as ef \'twas a drefful t\'ing fur de poor chile ter be suff\'rin\'\r\nso," she would sigh to herself as she watched his worn and heavy face\r\non her passages through the room; "but Hagar\'s t\'ankful \'nough to see\r\nit, \'cause de poor chile\'ll find de Lord bimeby. Bress de Lord! Mas\'r\r\nDick\'ll find him some time!"\r\n\r\n  A long and weary week passed away. Without, the world had never been\r\nfairer, nor the sea lovelier. No storms lashed it, and the great world\r\nof waves glittered calm and untroubled under the sun, with no hint of\r\ndeath or woe in its purple evening lights or its bright morning\r\ngleams.\r\n\r\n  Then, after this long seeking, a faint hope began to dawn in\r\nTrafford\'s heart. He did not dare to give it heed or trust at\r\nfirst,--he who had been in despair so long,--and when, at last, he\r\nbegan to put forth feeble, trembling anticipations of the peace and\r\njoy which might come when God\'s smile and forgiveness shone upon him,\r\nthis little ray of hope broadened and grew warmer and brighter, and he\r\nbegan to look up out of his depths of anguish. It was long coming,--it\r\nseemed at times to be utterly unattainable,--it was sometimes almost\r\nwithin his heart, and then it fled from him; but at last it came, and\r\nabode with him,--this peace which a poor, wandering soul feels after\r\nit has found its Lord. Then he was at rest. He came out into Hagar\'s\r\nkitchen one sunshiny afternoon, and, in answer to the old negress\'\r\nlook of wonder and surprise at seeing him there, said, with a grave\r\njoy thrilling his words,--\r\n\r\n  "Hagar, I have found him; and I do not think that his peace will ever\r\nleave me, or that my heart will ever forget him."\r\n\r\n  Hagar got up off the bench where she was sitting, and came slowly\r\nforward, saying, brokenly, "Bress de Lord, bress de Lord! dat\'s all\r\nHagar ken say. Oh, chile, ef ye knew how dis ole heart felt ter hear\r\nye say dem words! ef ye only c\'u\'d know! But ye nebber will till dis\r\nole woman gits such a tongue as de Lord\'ll gib her when she gets ter\r\nheaben. Den Hagar ken tell ye!"\r\n\r\n  She followed him to the door, and sat down there in the sunshine,\r\nsoftly blessing him again and again as she watched him follow the\r\nthread of a path which led around to the piazza. Trafford paused\r\nhere, on the smooth sand by the piazza-steps, and looked out upon the\r\nsea. It was like a new sea, and the very earth seemed not as of old,\r\nfor now God reigned over them, and it was his sunshine which fell so\r\nbrightly and broadly everywhere, and his smile and the knowledge of\r\nhis forgiveness which filled his heart with such utter peace and\r\ntranquillity. This great joy and calm held him quiet for a little\r\nspace, and, when he turned about, his eyes fell upon the little\r\nbreadth of grass waving there by the step. One or two gay, crimson\r\nasters nodded in the warm wind, planted there by the same hand that\r\nwatered and cared for the bit of turf. Trafford sat down by them,\r\nstroking the turf\'s green blades, and gazing at the warm-hued flowers\r\nthrough tears. "Gone--gone," they seemed to whisper as they softly\r\nrustled. Somehow these tender, soulless things brought up the boy\'s\r\nmemory most vividly. He remembered how Noll sat on the same bit of\r\nturf only those two short weeks ago with the warm wind blowing his\r\ncurly locks about his eyes while he looked off upon the sea. Who\r\nthought of danger or death then? Who thought of death lying in wait in\r\nthat calm, shadowy sea? Trafford\'s tears fell thick and fast upon the\r\ngreen blades, thinking of the lad. Did ever the sea quench a fairer,\r\nbrighter life? he wondered,--a life fuller of rich and generous\r\npromise? Yet, only two short weeks ago,--short, in reality, but slow\r\nand long in passing,--the boy had sat upon this little breadth of\r\nverdure full of life and spirits and happiness.\r\n\r\n  "Ah!" sighed he, "I knew not a treasure I possessed till it passed\r\nfrom me. Now that I have lost it, I see what a blissful life I might\r\nhave made for myself and it. God forgive me! but I was harsh and cruel\r\nto the boy. I made his life darker and less joyous than it ought to\r\nhave been."\r\n\r\n  He sat here for a long time, till once more his face was calm and\r\nundisturbed. Sometime, he thought, he might meet the boy face to face,\r\nand tell him all that his heart longed to unburden itself of. He rose\r\nup, at last, and went slowly in, pausing at the library-door. After a\r\nfew seconds of indecision, he opened it, and went softly in. The room\r\nwas cold and chilly from its long unoccupancy; but through one of the\r\nhigh windows, and along the floor, streamed a broad bar of cheerful\r\nsunlight. It fell right across Noll\'s study-table and the chair which\r\nhe was wont to occupy. Trafford moved forward, sat down in the chair,\r\nand looked about him with misty eyes. Traces of the boy\'s presence\r\neverywhere! The familiar school-books, open to the last lessons which\r\nTrafford had heard him recite; bits of paper, with sums and solutions\r\ntraced thereon; copies of the fine and feathery sea-moss, which it was\r\nthe boy\'s delight to gather, with odd pebbles and shells, met his gaze\r\non either hand. He took up a scrap of paper from among the rest, and\r\nfound something thereon which the boy had written, evidently in an\r\nidle moment. Trafford, however, read it not without emotion. It merely\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n  "_Wednes., Aug. 24._--This is a long, gray, rainy day, and I have not\r\nstirred out of the house. I am at this moment (or ought to be)\r\nstudying my Latin lesson. Uncle Richard has not spoken a word to me\r\nsince breakfast. I wish I knew what made him look so grim and sober\r\nto-day, and I _do_ wish he would speak to me. When the fog lifted just\r\nnow, I fancied I saw a ship on the horizon, bound for Hastings, I\r\nsuppose. Oh, but I--"\r\n\r\n  Here the slight record was broken off. Perhaps the boy had gone back\r\nto his Latin, or perhaps the passing ship had taken his thoughts along\r\nwith it to Hastings, and thus left the half-commenced exclamation\r\nunfinished. Trafford read and reread the little bit of paper, and\r\nfolded it carefully, and put it away with the precious letter which\r\nthe boy\'s father had written on his dying-bed. Then he began to\r\ngather up Noll\'s books, thinking to put them out of his sight, but\r\nstopped before he had taken the third in his hand. Why hide them? Why\r\nshut them up in darkness, as if some evil, dreaded memory were\r\nconnected with the sight of them? Had not everything about the boy and\r\nhis life been bright and pleasant to think of? He put the books back\r\nin their places, saying to himself, "They shall stay where they are.\r\nHagar shall not move them, and I will have them before my eyes alway,\r\njust as his dear hands left them? Why should I try to hide aught that\r\nhis blessed memory lingers around?"\r\n\r\n  So he left everything just as Noll\'s hands had placed them last, and\r\nrose up from his chair, and went to his old familiar seat by the great\r\nbookcase, where he had sat and pored over great volumes day after\r\nday, and watched the boy at his studies. The portrait on the wall\r\nlooked down at him with its soft and tender eyes, and he thought, "Now\r\nI may look at it without its reproaching me; for, dear heart, I have\r\nbegun to \'come up.\' I have turned my eyes toward thy abode, and, God\r\nhelping me, I may some day hear thy own sweet voice. And though I may\r\nnever see the boy\'s face, and rejoice to look upon it as I do upon\r\nthine, yet his pure memory lingers about everything that he loved and\r\ntouched, and his face can never be removed from my heart."\r\n\r\n  Calm and peaceful days passed, and the third week after the shipwreck\r\nwent by, and life in the stone house began to move on as it was wont\r\nto do. Once more the red light from the library-window streamed out\r\ninto the night, but there was no Skipper Ben and his "Gull" for it to\r\nguide. Not a sail had been seen near the Rock, and its inhabitants had\r\nbeen shut out from the rest of mankind for three long weeks. That\r\nwhich at first was only an inconvenience grew to be a serious matter\r\nat last. The Culm folk, never very provident, exhausted their supply\r\nof flour and meal, and had only fish to eat; and fish, with a little\r\nsalt, was not an extensive nor varied bill of fare.\r\n\r\n  In some way or another, Hagar discovered that the people had exhausted\r\nall their stores, and through her it came to Trafford\'s ears.\r\n\r\n  "Nuffin but fish ter live on, an\' not de greatest plenty o\' dat,"\r\nHagar had said, standing beside Trafford\'s chair in the library.\r\n\r\n  The man started, as a sudden remembrance of forgotten duties came\r\ninto his mind. He had neglected to look after those Culm people,--he\r\nhad forgotten about Noll\'s school and its pupils. But it should be so\r\nno longer, he resolved at once. That work which the boy loved and\r\ndesired to complete, he would take up and carry out. It should be a\r\npleasure and delight. He would gather up the broken, half-completed\r\nplans, and make it the work of his life to perfect them as Noll would\r\nhave done. Now the inmates of the stone house were not well supplied\r\nwith provisions, as the winter stores had not been laid in. There was\r\nno telling when another ship would touch at Culm, but, in all\r\nprobability, it would be soon. The skipper must have friends\r\nsomewhere, who would be searching for his whereabouts. Trafford\r\ndivided his supplies with the fishermen, trusting that ere long some\r\nsail would appear, bound for the Rock, or within signalling distance\r\nof it. He walked often by the sea, looking toward Hastings, and trying\r\nin vain to discern some sail bound hitherward. He walked over to Culm\r\nvillage, and lingered about the little room where Noll\'s school had\r\nbeen, and resolved that the plan of a new schoolroom, with good seats,\r\nbenches, and a faithful teacher, should be carried out if ever\r\ncommunication was opened between the Rock and Hastings. And if no\r\nteacher could be got for the winter, he would teach the children\r\nhimself. He wondered whether there were any chairs or benches left\r\nfrom the cargo of the "Gull," remembering that Noll was to bring\r\nschool-furniture from Hastings with him; but, though he searched long\r\nand keenly among the timbers and refuse which the sea had thrown up,\r\nhe could not find so much as a bit of varnished wood that looked as if\r\nit might have belonged to a desk or chair. At this he wondered, but\r\nthought, "The poor boy was unsuccessful, or else the sea refuses to\r\ngive up aught that was his, as well as himself."\r\n\r\n  And still he watched and waited for a sail, thinking that if none came\r\nsoon, a way must be devised for getting to Hastings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nOUT OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The fourth week after the shipwreck dragged slowly away,--spent in\r\nwatching and waiting for a sail. None came. The lack of good food was\r\ngetting to be a serious matter for both Culm folk and the inmates of\r\nthe stone house. Trafford\'s stores were well-nigh exhausted, and the\r\nlast day of that long fourth week was spent in company with Dirk\r\nSharp and some of his comrades, devising plans by which they might\r\ncommunicate with Hastings. The master of the stone house walked\r\nhomeward after his conference with the fishermen, and paused in the\r\ngathering dusk on the spot where he had stood that fearful night when\r\nthe "Gull" and her crew were on the rocks in the awful roar and\r\nthunder of the tempest. How silent and peaceful it all lay now,--the\r\nsea purpling in its calm and shadowy depths, its waves faintly\r\nmurmuring on the pebbles, and, overhead, the arch of silvery sky\r\nbending down to the far horizon, full of the tender lights of the\r\nafter-glow! Only one month since that fearful night, yet how far in\r\nthe dim past the event seemed! What a great darkness and despair he\r\nhad struggled through! How full and real every minute of those four\r\nweeks had been! And, as he stood there, such strong and tender\r\nmemories of the lad he had lost came back to him that he turned away\r\nwith a throbbing heart, and walked homeward along the sand with a\r\nbowed head, and so failed to see the white gleaming of a sail which\r\nrose out of the sea and stood toward the Rock. The lingering daylight\r\ntouched it with a rosy flush as the rising night-breeze bore it\r\nsteadily onward; but Trafford saw it not, and went up the\r\npiazza-steps, and into the stone house, without turning his eyes\r\nseaward.\r\n\r\n  He ate his scanty supper, which Hagar--poor heart!--had placed upon\r\nthe table with a wonderful display of dishes, as if to make up for the\r\nlack of food by a board spread with cups and plates enough for a\r\nfeast, and then took his way to the silent library. He sat down at\r\nhis organ, and from its long-silent pipes drew soft and tender music\r\nthat filled the room and stole gently through the house. The tears\r\ncame into Hagar\'s eyes as she listened to it.\r\n\r\n  "\'Pears as ef de angels was singin\'," she said, wiping her cheeks.\r\n"Hagar wonders ef de Lord\'ll gib her a voice like dat when she gets\r\nter glory."\r\n\r\n  It died away at last in gentle, tremulous whispers, and Trafford\r\nwalked to the window and looked out. Twilight had settled so thickly\r\nthat the sea was quite hidden, save a faint glimmer of ripples along\r\nthe sand. Deep quiet reigned over land and sea, and nowhere with such\r\nundisputed sway as in the stone house. Trafford lit his study-lamp and\r\nsat down, with no desire, however, to read or study. Hardly had he\r\nseated himself, when, with startling suddenness, a shrill scream broke\r\nupon the deep quiet. It was Hagar\'s voice, and the cry came from her\r\nkitchen; and before Trafford had recovered from his surprise, there\r\nwas a little sound of commotion in her distant province,--doors were\r\nthrown open, voices echoed, and then along the silent hall came a\r\nsound--the rush of eager feet--that drove every trace of color from\r\nTrafford\'s face, as well it might, and made his heart beat so loud and\r\nwildly that he pressed his hands over it to stay its tumultuous\r\nbeating. He started up, gazing with wide-open eyes at the\r\nlibrary-door, while at every echo of those coming footsteps, he\r\nstarted and trembled, and grew faint with anticipation. The door burst\r\nopen, and there stood--Noll Trafford!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "It\'s I, Uncle Richard" Page 421.]\r\n\r\n  One moment the boy paused, perhaps frightened by the white face of the\r\nman who sat gazing motionlessly at him, then he bounded forward,\r\ncrying, "It\'s I, Uncle Richard!--your own Noll!"\r\n\r\n  Trafford\'s arms did not clasp the boy about; his tongue refused to\r\narticulate; his heart could not take in this great, overwhelming joy.\r\nBut Noll\'s arms were about his neck, the boy\'s warm breath was upon\r\nhis cheek, and in his ears was the lad\'s whisper, "It\'s I,--I, Uncle\r\nRichard! no one else!"\r\n\r\n  Then the man began to sigh, just as if he were awakening from a long\r\nand troubled dream, and presently he put out his hand and touched the\r\nboy\'s cheeks, as if to assure himself that it was not all a vision,\r\nand then he said, chokingly, "My boy,--_mine_! O God! I don\'t deserve\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n  His arms clasped the lad in one long, fervent embrace. He bent his\r\nhead over the curly locks, and wept for joy, stroking the lad\'s\r\nshoulders and pressing his hands the while, as if he were not yet sure\r\nthat the boy was a reality. He looked upon him as one from the dead.\r\nHad the sea given him up?--had that terrible tempest spared him in its\r\nwild fury? Why had the boy lingered so long? Where had he been\r\nsojourning all these long weeks? But too happy in the consciousness\r\nthat it was really Noll, safe and unharmed, who was before him, to\r\ncare for aught further at present, he sat silently holding the boy\'s\r\nhands, while his heart gave grateful thanks to God.\r\n\r\n  "Poor Uncle Richard!" said the boy, at last.\r\n\r\n  Trafford\'s lips moved, and with an effort he said, "No, no,--not\r\n_poor_! I\'m rich, rich!--_so_ rich! O God, help me! I can\'t believe my\r\nown happiness."\r\n\r\n  "But it\'s really I, Uncle Richard!" said Noll, assuringly; "you\'ve\r\nfelt my hands, my face, my shoulders, and aren\'t they alive and warm?"\r\n\r\n  "Yes, it is really you, thank God!" said Trafford, drawing a long\r\nbreath, while he gazed upon the merry face that he never more expected\r\nto see on earth.\r\n\r\n  "Yes, and oh, Uncle Richard, you can\'t know how I longed to see you,\r\nto tell you that I was alive and safe! I knew you would worry, but I\r\ndidn\'t think you\'d think me dead. I didn\'t think _that_ till we got to\r\nCulm, and Dirk and all the rest trembled, and were actually going to\r\nrun away from me!"\r\n\r\n  "Then you have not been harmed?" said Trafford: "but oh, my boy,\r\nwhere were you on that awful night?"\r\n\r\n  "Safe and sound, with Ned Thorn, at Hastings, Uncle Richard, and not\r\neven dreaming of danger or shipwreck. You see, the furniture was not\r\nready, and I hadn\'t found a teacher, and so I stayed. Ned and I went\r\ndown to the wharf the night before the \'Gull\' was to sail, and carried\r\na letter to the skipper to give to you, telling you why I couldn\'t\r\ncome; but poor Ben never got here alive, and the letter was lost with\r\nhim, I suppose. Oh, Uncle Richard, if I _had_ started,--if the\r\nfurniture had been ready--"\r\n\r\n  "Thank God it was not!" interrupted Trafford, presently; "he watched\r\nover you, he stayed your coming, and now he has brought you out of the\r\nsea, as it were, to me. Oh, Noll!"\r\n\r\n  The boy looked up eagerly. "Have--have you found the Lord Jesus, Uncle\r\nRichard?" he asked.\r\n\r\n  Trafford\'s hands rested tenderly on the boy\'s head. "Yes," he said,\r\nwith a great calm and peace in his voice, "I found him through great\r\nsorrow and grief. I think God led me through all this suffering that\r\nmy heart might be softened and turned toward him. And now this Saviour\r\nhas brought you back to me!"\r\n\r\n  A deep silence followed, full of unutterable joy. Trafford reverently\r\nbent his head, his lips quivering with emotion, and with his nephew\'s\r\nhands clasped in his, silently thanked God for his goodness, for this\r\ngreat joy which was come into his life, for this precious lad that was\r\ndead and now was alive again. It seemed as if God had brought him out\r\nof the sea to him. At last Noll said, taking up his explanation where\r\nhe had left it off,--\r\n\r\n  "After we had given the letter to the skipper, I thought no more about\r\nit, and Ned and I were busy enough with seeing about the furniture for\r\na day or two, and we didn\'t notice the storm, or even think of the\r\n\'Gull\' being in danger. And Mr. Gray helped me to find a teacher, and\r\nwe were so busy with plans that the time passed away before I knew it,\r\nand when I came to go down on the wharf to engage a passage with Ben,\r\nthe men said the \'Gull\' had never got back from her last trip, and\r\nthey were afraid it was lost. Ned didn\'t believe there had been a\r\nshipwreck, neither did Mr. Gray. He said that most likely the skipper\r\nhad been kept by some business, or perhaps the \'Gull\' had gone farther\r\ndown the coast than usual. Oh, Uncle Richard! we didn\'t think that\r\npoor Ben was drowned, nor that you thought me wrecked with him."\r\n\r\n  Trafford said, "Those were fearful days for me. Go on, go on, Noll."\r\n\r\n  "We went down to the wharf every night till another week was gone, and\r\nthen, we began to be certain that Ben was either wrecked or sick, and\r\nI began to be anxious to get some word to you. I thought that perhaps\r\nyou might be worried about me, though Mr. Gray said that if the \'Gull\'\r\nwas wrecked anywhere near Culm, you could not help but know I was not\r\non board. We waited and waited till the three weeks were gone, and\r\nthen some of Ben\'s friends began to talk of going in search of him.\r\nBut it was only till last night that they were ready to go, and we\r\ncame off before daylight this morning. Oh, the time has seemed so\r\nlong, Uncle Richard! but here I am, safe and sound, once more."\r\n\r\n  Trafford looked at his nephew as if he could yet hardly believe his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n  "And you should have seen Dirk and the rest!" continued Noll; "why, he\r\nwouldn\'t speak to me at first, but was going to run away; but when he\r\ndid find that it was really I, he cried like a great child. He said\r\nthat you thought me dead,--you can\'t know how I felt when he said\r\nthat, Uncle Richard,--and so Ned and I didn\'t wait any longer, but ran\r\nall the way here. I can think, now, why you looked so white when I\r\ncame in at the door!"\r\n\r\n  Trafford stroked the boy\'s hair, saying, "I never thought to hear the\r\nechoes of your feet again. God knows. Oh, my boy, _you_ can never\r\nknow what this night has brought to me. He who led you thither only\r\ncan. But whose name did you mention?"\r\n\r\n  "Ned\'s; he came down with me, Uncle Richard, for it\'s vacation at\r\nHastings. We came up to the kitchen-door, because Hagar\'s light shone\r\nso brightly, and what do you think? she threw up her hands and\r\nscreamed at the sight of me. But it didn\'t take long to make her\r\ncertain that I was real, and not a vision. And, oh, there\'s one thing\r\nI\'d forgotten! The new teacher is at Culm, waiting for Dirk to come\r\nover with his trunks. It\'s one of papa\'s old scholars, Uncle Richard,\r\nand his name is Henry Fields. He worked with papa in the old sea-town\r\nwhere we lived, and he\'s come down to work here at Culm among our\r\nfish-folk. I like him very much, and you can\'t help but like him,\r\ntoo; and we\'ve brought a cargo of benches and desks all ready to--"\r\n\r\n  The library-door began to swing softly open,--not so softly, however,\r\nbut that Noll heard and stopped.\r\n\r\n  "It\'s Ned," he said, looking over his shoulder. "Come in!"\r\n\r\n  Ned came shyly around to where they were sitting, his usually merry\r\nface sobered by something which he perceived in the faces of his\r\nfriends before him. A silence fell upon them here. Ned leaned against\r\nhis friend, looking soberly at Trafford\'s rapt face, and wondering\r\nwhere all the man\'s grimness and gloominess had gone. And just then a\r\nsudden thought came into Noll\'s heart, and he said, looking up\r\nbrightly,--\r\n\r\n  "It\'s a year this very night since I came to you, Uncle Richard!\r\nDon\'t you remember? What a long, long time!"\r\n\r\n  Trafford said, "Yes, I remember. Through all the days since then God\r\nhas been teaching me, and he has led me on to this; and, oh! my boy,\r\nthe sea may never divide us again, for, though through its dark floods\r\nwe go down to death, beyond there is light and God and heaven!" And in\r\nhis voice there was peace unutterable.\r\n\r\n                               *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\n  If this Story of a Year, and what it taught, is not already too long,\r\nyou may know that a schoolhouse was built at Culm, and that Henry\r\nFields proved a good and faithful teacher; that a stanch, new "White\r\nGull" was built, and one of Skipper Ben\'s sea-loving sons was its\r\ncaptain; that the Culm children and their parents slowly improved in\r\nmore ways than one under the constant, unfailing care and effort of\r\nTrafford and his nephew; that the Rock was not always Noll Trafford\'s\r\nhome, but exchanged for a pleasanter one in Hastings, though the old\r\nstone house was often brightened by his presence, and never got to be\r\nentirely gloomy and deserted again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Culm Rock, by Glance Gaylord\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CULM ROCK ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 20524.txt or 20524.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/0/5/2/20524/\r\n\r\nProduced by Barbara Tozier, David T.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
