But if theology and\r\ntheosophy, then why not theography and theometry, why not theognomy,\r\ntheotrophy, theotomy, theogamy? Why not theophysics and theo-chemistry?\r\nWhy not that ingenious toy, the theotrope or wheel of gods? Why not a\r\nmonumental theodrome?\r\n\r\nIn the great window opposite, young David stood like a cock, crowing on\r\nthe dunghill of a tumbled giant. From the middle of Goliath\xe2\x80\x99s forehead\r\nthere issued, like a narwhal\xe2\x80\x99s budding horn, a curious excrescence. Was\r\nit the embedded pebble? Or perhaps the giant\xe2\x80\x99s married life?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... with all thine heart,\xe2\x80\x9d declaimed the Reverend Pelvey, \xe2\x80\x9cand with all\r\nthy soul, and with all thy might.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo, but seriously, Gumbril reminded himself, the problem was very\r\ntroublesome indeed. God as a sense of warmth about the heart, God as\r\nexultation, God as tears in the eyes, God as a rush of power or\r\nthought\xe2\x80\x94that was all right. But God as truth, God as 2 + 2 = 4\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t so clearly all right. Was there any chance of their being the\r\nsame? Were there bridges to join the two worlds? And could it be that\r\nthe Reverend Pelvey, M.A., fog-horning away from behind the imperial\r\nbird, could it be that he had an answer and a clue? That was hardly\r\nbelievable. Particularly if one knew Mr. Pelvey personally. And Gumbril\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd these words which I command thee this day,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr. Pelvey,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshall be in thine heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOr in the heart, or in the head? Reply, Mr. Pelvey, reply. Gumbril\r\njumped between the horns of the dilemma and voted for other organs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou shalt teach them diligently to thy children, and shalt talk of\r\nthem when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way,\r\nand when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDiligently to thy children.... Gumbril remembered his own childhood;\r\nthey had not been very diligently taught to him. \xe2\x80\x98Beetles, black\r\nbeetles\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94his father had a really passionate feeling about the clergy.\r\nMumbojumbery was another of his favourite words. An atheist and an\r\nanti-clerical of the strict old school he was. Not that, in any case, he\r\ngave himself much time to think about these things; he was too busy\r\nbeing an unsuccessful architect. As for Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s mother, her diligence\r\nhad not been dogmatic. She had just been diligently good, that was all.\r\nGood; good? It was a word people only used nowadays with a kind of\r\ndeprecating humorousness. Good. Beyond good and evil? We are all that\r\nnowadays. Or merely below them, like earwigs? I glory in the name of\r\nearwig. Gumbril made a mental gesture and inwardly declaimed. But good\r\nin any case, there was no getting out of that, good she had been. Not\r\nnice, not merely _molto simpatica_\xe2\x80\x94how charmingly and effectively these\r\nforeign tags assist one in the great task of calling a spade by some\r\nother name!\xe2\x80\x94but good. You felt the active radiance of her goodness when\r\nyou were near her.... And that feeling, was that less real and valid\r\nthan two plus two?\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Pelvey had nothing to reply. He was reading with a holy\r\ngusto of \xe2\x80\x9chouses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and\r\nwells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which\r\nthou plantedst not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had been good and she had died when he was still a boy; died\xe2\x80\x94but he\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been told that till much later\xe2\x80\x94of creeping and devouring pain.\r\nMalignant disease\xe2\x80\x94oh, _caro nome_!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt fear the Lord thy God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pelvey.\r\n\r\nEven when the ulcers are benign; thou shalt fear. He had travelled up\r\nfrom school to see her, just before she died. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t known that she\r\nwas going to die, but when he entered her room, when he saw her lying so\r\nweakly in the bed, he had suddenly begun to cry, uncontrollably. All the\r\nfortitude, the laughter even, had been hers. And she had spoken to him.\r\nA few words only; but they had contained all the wisdom he needed to\r\nlive by. She had told him what he was, and what he should try to be, and\r\nhow to be it. And crying, still crying, he had promised that he would\r\ntry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pelvey,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd had he kept his promise, Gumbril wondered, had he preserved himself\r\nalive?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere endeth the First Lesson.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pelvey retreated from the eagle, and\r\nthe organ presaged the coming _Te Deum_.\r\n\r\nGumbril hoisted himself to his feet; the folds of his B.A. gown billowed\r\nnobly about him as he rose. He sighed and shook his head with the\r\ngesture of one who tries to shake off a fly or an importunate thought.\r\nWhen the time came for singing, he sang. On the opposite side of the\r\nchapel two boys were grinning and whispering to one another behind their\r\nlifted Prayer Books. Gumbril frowned at them ferociously. The two boys\r\ncaught his eye and their faces at once took on an expression of sickly\r\npiety; they began to sing with unction. They were two ugly,\r\nstupid-looking louts, who ought to have been apprenticed years ago to\r\nsome useful trade. Instead of which they were wasting their own and\r\ntheir teacher\xe2\x80\x99s and their more intelligent comrades\xe2\x80\x99 time in trying,\r\nquite vainly, to acquire an elegant literary education. The minds of\r\ndogs, Gumbril reflected, do not benefit by being treated as though they\r\nwere the minds of men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord, have mercy upon us: have mercy upon us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril shrugged his shoulders and looked round the chapel at the faces\r\nof the boys. Lord, indeed, have mercy upon us! He was disturbed to find\r\nthe sentiment echoed on a somewhat different note in the Second Lesson,\r\nwhich was drawn from the twenty-third chapter of St. Luke. \xe2\x80\x9cFather,\r\nforgive them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pelvey in his unvaryingly juicy voice; \xe2\x80\x9cfor they\r\nknow not what they do.\xe2\x80\x9d Ah, but suppose one did know what one was doing?\r\nsuppose one knew only too well? And of course one always did know. One\r\nwas not a fool.\r\n\r\nBut this was all nonsense, all nonsense. One must think of something\r\nbetter than this. What a comfort it would be, for example, if one could\r\nbring air cushions into chapel! These polished oaken stalls were\r\ndevilishly hard; they were meant for stout and lusty pedagogues, not for\r\nbony starvelings like himself. An air cushion, a delicious pneu.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere endeth,\xe2\x80\x9d boomed Mr. Pelvey, closing his book on the back of the\r\nGerman eagle.\r\n\r\nAs if by magic, Dr. Jolly was ready at the organ with the _Benedictus_.\r\nIt was positively a relief to stand again; this oak was adamantine. But\r\nair cushions, alas, would be too bad an example for the boys. Hardy\r\nyoung Spartans! it was an essential part of their education that they\r\nshould listen to the word of revelation without pneumatic easement. No,\r\nair cushions wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do. The real remedy, it suddenly flashed across\r\nhis mind, would be trousers with pneumatic seats. For all occasions; not\r\nmerely for churchgoing.\r\n\r\nThe organ blew a thin Puritan-preacher\xe2\x80\x99s note through one of its hundred\r\nnostrils. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe....\xe2\x80\x9d With a noise like the breaking of a wave, five\r\nhundred turned towards the East. The view of David and Goliath was\r\nexchanged for a Crucifixion in the grand manner of eighteen hundred and\r\nsixty. \xe2\x80\x9cFather, forgive them; for they know not what they do.\xe2\x80\x9d No, no,\r\nGumbril preferred to look at the grooved stonework rushing smoothly up\r\non either side of the great east window towards the vaulted roof;\r\npreferred to reflect, like the dutiful son of an architect he was, that\r\nPerpendicular at its best\xe2\x80\x94and its best is its largest\xe2\x80\x94is the finest sort\r\nof English Gothic. At its worst and smallest, as in most of the colleges\r\nof Oxford, it is mean, petty, and, but for a certain picturesqueness,\r\nalmost wholly disgusting. He felt like a lecturer: next slide, please.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the life everlasting. Amen.\xe2\x80\x9d Like an oboe, Mr. Pelvey intoned: \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nLord be with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor prayer, Gumbril reflected, there would be Dunlop knees. Still, in\r\nthe days when he had made a habit of praying, they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nnecessary. \xe2\x80\x9cOur Father....\xe2\x80\x9d The words were the same as they were in the\r\nold days; but Mr. Pelvey\xe2\x80\x99s method of reciting them made them sound\r\nrather different. Her dresses, when he had leaned his forehead against\r\nher knee to say those words\xe2\x80\x94those words, good Lord! that Mr. Pelvey was\r\noboeing out of existence\xe2\x80\x94were always black in the evenings, and of silk,\r\nand smelt of orris root. And when she was dying, she had said to him:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember the Parable of the Sower, and the seeds that fell in shallow\r\nground.\xe2\x80\x9d No, no. Amen, decidedly. \xe2\x80\x9cO Lord, show thy mercy upon us,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nchanted oboe Pelvey, and Gumbril trombone responded, profoundly and\r\ngrotesquely: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd grant us thy salvation.\xe2\x80\x9d No, the knees were obviously\r\nless important, except for people like revivalists and housemaids, than\r\nthe seat. Sedentary are commoner than genuflectory professions. One\r\nwould introduce little flat rubber bladders between two layers of cloth.\r\nAt the upper end, hidden when one wore a coat, would be a tube with a\r\nvalve: like a hollow tail. Blow it up\xe2\x80\x94and there would be perfect comfort\r\neven for the boniest, even on rock. How did the Greeks stand marble\r\nbenches in their theatres?\r\n\r\nThe moment had now come for the Hymn. This being the first Sunday of the\r\nSummer term, they sang that special hymn, written by the Headmaster,\r\nwith music by Dr. Jolly, on purpose to be sung on the first Sundays of\r\nterms. The organ quietly sketched out the tune. Simple it was, uplifting\r\nand manly.\r\n\r\n           One, two, three, four; one, two THREE\xe2\x80\x944.\r\n           One, two-and three-and four-and; One, two THREE\xe2\x80\x944.\r\n           ONE\xe2\x80\x942, THREE\xe2\x80\x944; ONE\xe2\x80\x942\xe2\x80\x943\xe2\x80\x944,\r\n           and-ONE\xe2\x80\x942, THREE\xe2\x80\x944; ONE\xe2\x80\x942\xe2\x80\x943\xe2\x80\x944.\r\n           One, two-and three, four; One, two THREE\xe2\x80\x944.\r\n\r\nFive hundred flawed adolescent voices took it up. For good example\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, Gumbril opened and closed his mouth; noiselessly, however. It was\r\nonly at the third verse that he gave rein to his uncertain baritone. He\r\nparticularly liked the third verse; it marked, in his opinion, the\r\nHeadmaster\xe2\x80\x99s highest poetical achievement.\r\n\r\n             (_f_) For slack hands and (_dim._) idle minds\r\n             (_mf_) Mischief still the Tempter finds.\r\n             (_ff_) Keep him captive in his lair.\r\n\r\nAt this point Dr. Jolly enriched his tune with a thick accompaniment in\r\nthe lower registers, artfully designed to symbolize the depth, the gloom\r\nand general repulsiveness of the Tempter\xe2\x80\x99s home.\r\n\r\n       (_ff_) Keep him captive in his lair.\r\n       (_f_) Work will bind him. (_dim._) Work is (_pp_) prayer.\r\n\r\nWork, thought Gumbril, work. Lord, how passionately he disliked work!\r\nLet Austin have his swink to him reserved! Ah, if only one had work of\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s own, proper work, decent work\xe2\x80\x94not forced upon one by the griping\r\nof one\xe2\x80\x99s belly! Amen! Dr. Jolly blew the two sumptuous jets of reverence\r\ninto the air; Gumbril accompanied them with all his heart. Amen, indeed.\r\n\r\nGumbril sat down again. It might be convenient, he thought, to have the\r\ntail so long that one could blow up one\xe2\x80\x99s trousers while one actually\r\nhad them on. In which case, it would have to be coiled round the waist\r\nlike a belt; or looped up, perhaps, and fastened to a clip on one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbraces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nineteenth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, part of the\r\nthirty-fourth verse.\xe2\x80\x9d The Headmaster\xe2\x80\x99s loud, harsh voice broke violently\r\nout from the pulpit. \xe2\x80\x9cAll with one voice for the space of about two\r\nhours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril composed himself as comfortably as he could on his oaken seat.\r\nIt was going to be one of the Headmaster\xe2\x80\x99s real swingeing sermons. Great\r\nis Diana. And Venus? Ah, these seats, these seats!\r\n\r\nGumbril did not attend evening chapel. He stayed at home in his lodgings\r\nto correct the sixty-three Holiday Task Papers which had fallen to his\r\nshare. They lay, thick piles of them, on the floor beside his chair:\r\nsixty-three answers to ten questions about the Italian Risorgimento. The\r\nRisorgimento, of all subjects! It had been one of the Headmaster\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncaprices. He had called a special master\xe2\x80\x99s meeting at the end of last\r\nterm to tell them all about the Risorgimento. It was his latest\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Risorgimento, gentlemen, is the most important event in modern\r\nEuropean history.\xe2\x80\x9d And he had banged the table; he had looked defiantly\r\nround the room in search of contradictors.\r\n\r\nBut nobody had contradicted him. Nobody ever did; they all knew better.\r\nFor the Headmaster was as fierce as he was capricious. He was for ever\r\ndiscovering something new. Two terms ago it had been singeing; after the\r\nhair-cut and before the shampoo, there must be singeing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hair, gentlemen, is a tube. If you cut it and leave the end\r\nunsealed, the water will get in and rot the tube. Hence the importance\r\nof singeing, gentlemen. Singeing seals the tube. I shall address the\r\nboys about it after chapel to-morrow morning; and I trust that all\r\nhouse-masters\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he had glared around him from under his savage\r\neyebrows\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwill see that their boys get themselves regularly singed after\r\ncutting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor weeks afterwards every boy trailed behind him a faint and nauseating\r\nwhiff of burning, as though he were fresh from hell. And now it was the\r\nRisorgimento. One of these days, Gumbril reflected, it would be birth\r\ncontrol, or the decimal system, or rational dress.\r\n\r\nHe picked up the nearest batch of papers. The printed questions were\r\npinned to the topmost of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive a brief account of the character and career of Pope Pius IX, _with\r\ndates wherever possible_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril leaned back in his chair and thought of his own character, with\r\ndates. 1896: the first serious and conscious and deliberate lie. Did you\r\nbreak that vase, Theodore? No, mother. It lay on his conscience for\r\nnearly a month, eating deeper and deeper. Then he had confessed the\r\ntruth. Or rather he had not confessed; that was too difficult. He led\r\nthe conversation, very subtly, as he thought, round through the\r\nnon-malleability of glass, through breakages in general, to this\r\nparticular broken vase; he practically forced his mother to repeat her\r\nquestion. And then, with a burst of tears, he had answered, yes. It had\r\nalways been difficult for him to say things directly, point-blank. His\r\nmother had told him, when she was dying.... No, no; not that.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 or 1899\xe2\x80\x94oh, these dates!\xe2\x80\x94he had made a pact with his little\r\ncousin, Molly, that she should let him see her with no clothes on, if he\r\nwould do the same by her. She had fulfilled her part of the bargain; but\r\nhe, overwhelmed at the last moment by a passion of modesty, had broken\r\nhis promise.\r\n\r\nThen, when he was about twelve and still at his preparatory school, in\r\n1902 or 1903 he had done badly in his exams., on purpose; he had been\r\nfrightened of Sadler, who was in the same form, and wanted to get the\r\nprize. Sadler was stronger than he was, and had a genius for\r\npersecution. He had done so badly that his mother was unhappy; and it\r\nwas impossible for him to explain.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 he had fallen in love for the first time\xe2\x80\x94ah, much more violently\r\nthan ever since\xe2\x80\x94with a boy of his own age. Platonic it had been and\r\nprofound. He had done badly that term, too; not on purpose, but because\r\nhe had spent so much time helping young Vickers with his work. Vickers\r\nwas really very stupid. The next term he had \xe2\x80\x98come out\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94_Staphylococcus\r\npyogenes_ is a lover of growing adolescence\xe2\x80\x94with spots and boils all\r\nover his face and neck. Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s affection ceased as suddenly as it had\r\nbegun. He finished that term, he remembered, with a second prize.\r\n\r\nBut it was time to be thinking seriously of Pio Nono. With a sigh of\r\ndisgusted weariness, Gumbril looked at his papers. What had Falarope\r\nMajor to say of the Pontiff? \xe2\x80\x9cPius IX was called Ferretti. He was a\r\nliberal before he was a Pope. A kindly man of less than average\r\nintelligence, he thought that all difficulties could be settled by a\r\nlittle goodwill, a few reforms and a political amnesty. He wrote several\r\nencyclicals and a syllabus.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril admired the phrase about less than\r\naverage intelligence; Falarope Major should have at least one mark for\r\nhaving learnt it so well by heart. He turned to the next paper. Higgs\r\nwas of opinion that \xe2\x80\x9cPius the Ninth was a good but stupid man, who\r\nthought he could settle the Risorgimento with a few reforms and a\r\npolitical armistice.\xe2\x80\x9d Beddoes was severer. \xe2\x80\x9cPius IX was a bad man, who\r\nsaid that he was infallible, which showed he had a less than average\r\nintelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d Sopwith Minor shared the general opinion about Pio\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nintelligence, and displayed a great familiarity with the wrong dates.\r\nClegg-Weller was voluminous and informative. \xe2\x80\x9cPius IX was not so clever\r\nas his prime minister, Cardinal Antonelli. When he came to the tiara he\r\nwas a liberal, and Metternich said he had never reckoned on a liberal\r\npope. He then became a conservative. He was kindly, but not intelligent,\r\nand he thought Garibaldi and Cavour would be content with a few reforms\r\nand an amnesty.\xe2\x80\x9d At the top of Garstang\xe2\x80\x99s paper was written: \xe2\x80\x9cI have had\r\nmeasles all the holidays, so have been unable to read more than the\r\nfirst thirty pages of the book. Pope Pius IX does not come into these\r\npages, of the contents of which I will proceed to give the following\r\npr\xc3\xa9cis.\xe2\x80\x9d And the pr\xc3\xa9cis duly followed. Gumbril would have liked to give\r\nhim full marks. But the business-like answer of Appleyard called him\r\nback to a better sense of his duty. \xe2\x80\x9cPius IX became Pope in 1846 and\r\ndied in 1878. He was a kindly man, but his intelligence was below\r\nthe....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril laid the paper down and shut his eyes. No, this was really\r\nimpossible. Definitely, it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go on, it could not go on. There\r\nwere thirteen weeks in the summer term, there would be thirteen in the\r\nautumn and eleven or twelve in the spring; and then another summer of\r\nthirteen, and so it would go on for ever. For ever. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do. He\r\nwould go away and live uncomfortably on his three hundred. Or, no, he\r\nwould go away and he would make money\xe2\x80\x94that was more like it\xe2\x80\x94money on a\r\nlarge scale, easily; he would be free and he would live. For the first\r\ntime, he would live. Behind his closed eyes, he saw himself living.\r\n\r\nOver the plushy floors of some vast and ignoble Ritz slowly he walked,\r\nat ease, with confidence: over the plushy floors and there, at the end\r\nof a long vista, there was Myra Viveash, waiting, this time, for him;\r\ncoming forward impatiently to meet him, his abject lover now, not the\r\ncool, free, laughing mistress who had lent herself contemptuously once\r\nto his pathetic and silent importunity and then, after a day, withdrawn\r\nthe gift again. Over the plushy floors to dine. Not that he was in love\r\nwith Myra any longer: but revenge is sweet.\r\n\r\nHe sat in his own house. The Chinese statues looked out from the niches;\r\nthe Maillols passionately meditated, slept, and were more than alive.\r\nThe Goyas hung on the walls, there was a Boucher in the bathroom; and\r\nwhen he entered with his guests, what a Piazzetta exploded above the\r\ndining-room mantelpiece! Over the ancient wine they talked together, and\r\nhe knew everything they knew and more; he gave, he inspired, it was the\r\nothers who assimilated and were enriched. After dinner there were Mozart\r\nquartets; he opened his portfolios and showed his Daumiers, his\r\nTiepolos, his Canaletto sketches, his drawings by Picasso and Lewis, and\r\nthe purity of his naked Ingres. And later, talking of Odalisques, there\r\nwere orgies without fatigue or disgust, and the women were pictures and\r\nlust in action, art.\r\n\r\nOver the empty plains forty horses impelled him towards Mantua:\r\nrubadub\xe2\x80\x94adubadub, with the silencer out. Towards the most romantic city\r\nin all the world.\r\n\r\nWhen he spoke to women\xe2\x80\x94how easily and insolently he spoke now!\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nlistened and laughed and looked at him sideways and dropped their\r\neyelids over the admission, the invitation, of their glance. With\r\nPhyllis once he had sat, for how long? in a warm and moonless darkness,\r\nsaying nothing, risking no gesture. And in the end they had parted,\r\nreluctantly and still in silence. Phyllis now was with him once again in\r\nthe summer night; but this time he spoke, now softly, now in the angry\r\nbreathless whisper of desire, he reached out and took her, and she was\r\nnaked in his arms. All chance encounters, all plotted opportunities\r\nrecurred; he knew, now, how to live, how to take advantage of them.\r\n\r\nOver the empty plains towards Mantua, towards Mantua, he slid along at\r\nease, free and alone. He explored the horrors of Roman society; visited\r\nAthens and Seville. To Unamuno and Papini he conversed familiarly in\r\ntheir own tongues. He understood perfectly and without effort the\r\nquantum theory. To his friend Shearwater he gave half a million for\r\nphysiological research. He visited Schoenberg and persuaded him to write\r\nstill better music. He exhibited to the politicians the full extent of\r\ntheir stupidity and their wickedness; he set them working for the\r\nsalvation, not the destruction, of humanity. Once in the past when he\r\nhad been called upon to make a public speech, he had felt so nervous\r\nthat he was sick; the thousands who listened to him now bent like wheat\r\nunder the wind of his eloquence. But it was only by the way and\r\noccasionally that he troubled himself to move them. He found it easy now\r\nto come to terms with every one he met, to understand all points of\r\nview, to identify himself with even the most unfamiliar spirit. And he\r\nknew how everybody lived, and what it was like to be a mill girl, a\r\ndustman, an engine-driver, a Jew, an Anglican bishop, a\r\nconfidence-trickster. Accustomed as he was to being swindled and imposed\r\nupon without protest, he now knew the art of being brutal. He was just\r\ndressing down that insolent porter at the Continental, who had\r\ncomplained that ten francs wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough (and had got, as a matter of\r\nhistoric fact, another five in addition), when his landlady gave a\r\nknock, opened the door and said: \xe2\x80\x9cDinner\xe2\x80\x99s ready, Mr. Gumbril.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFeeling a little ashamed at having been interrupted in what was, after\r\nall, one of the ignobler and more trivial occupations of his new life,\r\nGumbril went down to his fatty chop and green peas. It was the first\r\nmeal to be eaten under the new dispensation; he ate it, for all that it\r\nwas unhappily indistinguishable from the meals of the past, with elation\r\nand a certain solemnity, as though he were partaking of a sacrament. He\r\nfelt buoyant with the thought that at last, at last, he was doing\r\nsomething about life.\r\n\r\nWhen the chop was eaten, he went upstairs and, after filling two\r\nsuit-cases and a Gladstone bag with the most valued of his possessions,\r\naddressed himself to the task of writing to the Headmaster. He might\r\nhave gone away, of course, without writing. But it would be nobler, more\r\nin keeping, he felt, with his new life, to leave a justification\r\nbehind\xe2\x80\x94or rather not a justification, a denouncement. He picked up his\r\npen and denounced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nGumbril senior occupied a tall, narrow-shouldered and rachitic house in\r\na little obscure square not far from Paddington. There were five floors,\r\nand a basement with beetles, and nearly a hundred stairs, which shook\r\nwhen any one ran too rudely down them. It was a prematurely old and\r\ndecaying house in a decaying quarter. The square in which it stood was\r\nsteadily coming down in the world. The houses which a few years ago had\r\nall been occupied by respectable families, were now split up into\r\nsqualid little maisonnettes, and from the neighbouring slums, which\r\nalong with most other unpleasant things the old bourgeois families had\r\nbeen able to ignore, invading bands of children came to sport on the\r\nonce sacred pavements.\r\n\r\nMr. Gumbril was almost the last survivor of the old inhabitants. He\r\nliked his house, and he liked his square. Social decadence had not\r\naffected the fourteen plane trees which adorned its little garden, and\r\nthe gambols of the dirty children did not disturb the starlings who\r\ncame, evening by evening in summer-time, to roost in their branches.\r\n\r\nOn fine evenings he used to sit out on his balcony waiting for the\r\ncoming of the birds. And just at sunset, when the sky was most golden,\r\nthere would be a twittering overhead, and the black, innumerable flocks\r\nof starlings would come sweeping across on the way from their daily\r\nhaunts to their roosting-places, chosen so capriciously among the\r\ntree-planted squares and gardens of the city and so tenaciously\r\nretained, year after year, to the exclusion of every other place. Why\r\nhis fourteen plane trees should have been chosen, Mr. Gumbril could\r\nnever imagine. There were plenty of larger and more umbrageous gardens\r\nall round; but they remained birdless, while every evening, from the\r\nlarger flocks, a faithful legion detached itself to settle clamorously\r\namong his trees. They sat and chattered till the sun went down and\r\ntwilight was past, with intervals every now and then of silence that\r\nfell suddenly and inexplicably on all the birds at once, lasted through\r\na few seconds of thrilling suspense, to end as suddenly and senselessly\r\nin an outburst of the same loud and simultaneous conversation.\r\n\r\nThe starlings were Mr. Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s most affectionately cherished friends;\r\nsitting out on his balcony to watch and listen to them, he had caught at\r\nthe shut of treacherous evenings many colds and chills on the liver, he\r\nhad laid up for himself many painful hours of rheumatism. These little\r\naccidents did nothing, however, to damp his affection for the birds; and\r\nstill on every evening that could possibly be called fine, he was always\r\nto be seen in the twilight, sitting on the balcony, gazing up,\r\nround-spectacled and rapt, at the fourteen plane trees. The breezes\r\nstirred in his grey hair, tossing it up in long, light wisps that fell\r\nacross his forehead and over his spectacles; and then he would shake his\r\nhead impatiently, and the bony hand would be freed for a moment from its\r\nunceasing combing and clutching of the sparse grey beard to push back\r\nthe strayed tendrils, to smooth and reduce to order the whole ruffled\r\nhead. The birds chattered on, the hand went back to its clutching and\r\ncombing; once more the wind blew; darkness came down, and the gas lamps\r\nround the square lit up the outer leaves of the plane trees, touched the\r\nprivet bushes inside the railings with an emerald light; behind them was\r\nimpenetrable night; instead of shorn grass and bedded geraniums there\r\nwas mystery, there were endless depths. And the birds at last were\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nMr. Gumbril would get up from his iron chair, stretch his arms and his\r\nstiff cold legs and go in through the French window to work. The birds\r\nwere his diversion; when they were silent, it was time to think of\r\nserious matters.\r\n\r\nTo-night, however, he was not working; for always on Sunday evenings his\r\nold friend Porteous came to dine and talk. Breaking in unexpectedly at\r\nmidnight, Gumbril Junior found them sitting in front of the gas fire in\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s study.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, what on earth are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Senior\r\njumped up excitedly at his son\xe2\x80\x99s entrance. The light silky hair floated\r\nup with the movement, turned for a moment into a silver aureole, then\r\nsubsided again. Mr. Porteous stayed where he was, calm, solid and\r\nundishevelled as a seated pillar-box. He wore a monocle on a black\r\nribbon, a black stock tie that revealed above its double folds a quarter\r\nof an inch of stiff white collar, a double-breasted black coat, a pair\r\nof pale checked trousers and patent leather boots with cloth tops. Mr.\r\nPorteous was very particular about his appearance. Meeting him casually\r\nfor the first time, one would not have guessed that Mr. Porteous was an\r\nexpert on Late Latin poetry; and he did not mean that you should guess.\r\nThin-limbed, bent and agile in his loose, crumpled clothes, Gumbril\r\nSenior had the air, beside Mr. Porteous, of a strangely animated\r\nscarecrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth?\xe2\x80\x9d the old gentleman repeated his question.\r\n\r\nGumbril Junior shrugged his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cI was bored, I decided to cease\r\nbeing a schoolmaster.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke with a fine airy assumption of\r\ncarelessness. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are you, Mr. Porteous?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, invariably well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril Senior, sitting down again, \xe2\x80\x9cI must say I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nnot surprised. I\xe2\x80\x99m only surprised that you stood it, not being a born\r\npedagogue, for as long as you did. What ever induced you to think of\r\nturning usher, I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at his son first through his\r\nspectacles, then over the top of them; the motives of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s conduct\r\nrevealed themselves to neither vision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else was there for me to do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gumbril Junior, pulling up a\r\nchair towards the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cYou gave me a pedagogue\xe2\x80\x99s education and washed\r\nyour hands of me. No opportunities, no openings. I had no alternative.\r\nAnd now you reproach me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Gumbril made an impatient gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re talking nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only point of the kind of education you had is this, it gives\r\na young man leisure to find out what he\xe2\x80\x99s interested in. You apparently\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t sufficiently interested in anything\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am interested in everything,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Gumbril Junior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich comes to the same thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said his father parenthetically, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nbeing interested in nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d And he went on from the point at which he\r\nhad been interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou weren\xe2\x80\x99t sufficiently interested in anything\r\nto want to devote yourself to it. That was why you sought the last\r\nrefuge of feeble minds with classical educations, you became a\r\nschoolmaster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Porteous. \xe2\x80\x9cI do a little teaching myself; I must\r\nstand up for the profession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril Senior let go his beard and brushed back the hair that the wind\r\nof his own vehemence had brought tumbling into his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndenigrate the profession,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. It would be an\r\nexcellent profession if every one who went into it were as much\r\ninterested in teaching as you are in your job, Porteous, or I in mine.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s these undecided creatures like Theodore, who ruin it by drifting\r\nin. Until all teachers are geniuses and enthusiasts, nobody will learn\r\nanything, except what they teach themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Porteous, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had to learn so much by\r\nmyself. I wasted a lot of time finding out how to set to work and where\r\nto discover what I wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril Junior was lighting his pipe. \xe2\x80\x9cI have come to the conclusion,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, speaking in little jerks between each suck of the flame into\r\nthe bowl, \xe2\x80\x9cthat most people ... ought never ... to be taught anything at\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d He threw away the match. \xe2\x80\x9cLord have mercy upon us, they\xe2\x80\x99re dogs.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use of teaching them anything except to behave well, to work\r\nand obey. Facts, theories, the truth about the universe\xe2\x80\x94what good are\r\nthose to them? Teach them to understand\xe2\x80\x94why, it only confuses them;\r\nmakes them lose hold of the simple real appearance. Not more than one in\r\na hundred can get any good out of a scientific or literary education.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re one of the ones?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat goes without saying,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Junior replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you mayn\xe2\x80\x99t be so far wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Porteous. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I think\r\nof my own children, for example....\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought they\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\ninterested in the things that interested me; they don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be\r\ninterested in anything but behaving like little apes\xe2\x80\x94not very anthropoid\r\nones either, for that matter. At my eldest boy\xe2\x80\x99s age I used to sit up\r\nmost of the night reading Latin texts. He sits up\xe2\x80\x94or rather stands,\r\nreels, trots up\xe2\x80\x94dancing and drinking. Do you remember St. Bernard?\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vigilet tota nocte luxuriosus non solum patienter\xe2\x80\x99 (the ascetic and the\r\nscholar only watch patiently); \xe2\x80\x98sed et libenter, ut suam expleat\r\nvoluptatem.\xe2\x80\x99 What the wise man does out of a sense of duty, the fool\r\ndoes for fun. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried very hard to make him like Latin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell in any case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril Junior, \xe2\x80\x9cyou didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to feed him on\r\nhistory. That\xe2\x80\x99s the real unforgivable sin. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ndoing, up till this evening\xe2\x80\x94encouraging boys of fifteen and sixteen to\r\nspecialize in history, hours and hours a week, making them read bad\r\nwriters\xe2\x80\x99 generalizations about subjects on which only our ignorance\r\nallows us to generalize; teaching them to reproduce these\r\ngeneralizations in horrid little \xe2\x80\x98Essays\xe2\x80\x99 of their own; rotting their\r\nminds, in fact, with a diet of soft vagueness; scandalous it was. If\r\nthese creatures are to be taught anything, it should be something hard\r\nand definite. Latin\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s excellent. Mathematics, physical science. Let\r\nthem read history for amusement, certainly. But for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake it the staple of education!\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Junior spoke with the greatest\r\nearnestness, as though he were an inspector of schools, making a report.\r\nIt was a subject on which, at the moment, he felt very profoundly; he\r\nfelt profoundly on all subjects while he was talking about them. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwrote a long letter to the Headmaster about the teaching of history this\r\nevening,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s most important.\xe2\x80\x9d He shook his head\r\nthoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cMost important.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHora novissima, tempora pessimma sunt, vigilemus,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Porteous,\r\nin the words of St. Peter Damianus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Senior applauded. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd talking about bad times,\r\nTheodore, what do you propose to do now, may I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to begin by making some money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril Senior put his hands on his knees, bent forward and laughed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d He had a profound bell-like laugh that was like the\r\ncroaking of a very large and melodious frog. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and\r\nshook his head till the hair fell into his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\nlaughed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo make money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Porteous, \xe2\x80\x9cone must be really interested in\r\nmoney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril Senior. \xe2\x80\x9cNone of us are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was still uncommonly hard up,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Porteous continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwe used\r\nto lodge in the same house with a Russian Jew, who was a furrier. That\r\nman was interested in money, if you like. It was a passion, an\r\nenthusiasm, an ideal. He could have led a comfortable, easy life, and\r\nstill have made enough to put by something for his old age. But for his\r\nhigh abstract ideal of money he suffered more than Michelangelo ever\r\nsuffered for his art. He used to work nineteen hours a day, and the\r\nother five he slept, lying under his bench, in the dirt, breathing into\r\nhis lungs the stink and the broken hairs. He is now very rich indeed and\r\ndoes nothing with his money, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to do anything, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat one does do with it. He desires neither power nor pleasure. His\r\ndesire for lucre is purely disinterested. He reminds me of Browning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Grammarian.\xe2\x80\x99 I have a great admiration for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Porteous\xe2\x80\x99s own passion had been for the poems of Notker Balbulus and\r\nSt. Bernard. It had taken him nearly twenty years to get himself and his\r\nfamily out of the house where the Russian furrier used to lodge. But\r\nNotker was worth it, he used to say; Notker was worth even the weariness\r\nand the pallor of a wife who worked beyond her strength, even the\r\nshabbiness of ill-dressed and none too well-fed children. He had\r\nreadjusted his monocle and gone on. But there had been occasions when it\r\nneeded more than the monocle and the careful, distinguished clothes to\r\nkeep up his _morale_. Still, those times were over now; Notker had\r\nbrought him at last a kind of fame\xe2\x80\x94even, indirectly, a certain small\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nGumbril Senior turned once more towards his son. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do you\r\npropose,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cto make this money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril Junior explained. He had thought it all out in the cab on the\r\nway from the station. \xe2\x80\x9cIt came to me this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cin chapel,\r\nduring service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonstrous,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Gumbril Senior, with a genuine indignation,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmonstrous these medi\xc3\xa6val survivals in schools! Chapel, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt came,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Junior went on, \xe2\x80\x9clike an apocalypse, suddenly, like a\r\ndivine inspiration. A grand and luminous idea came to me\xe2\x80\x94the idea of\r\nGumbril\xe2\x80\x99s Patent Small-Clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s Patent Small-Clothes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA boon to those whose occupation is sedentary\xe2\x80\x9d; Gumbril Junior had\r\nalready composed his prospectus and his first advertisements: \xe2\x80\x9ca comfort\r\nto all travellers, civilization\xe2\x80\x99s substitute for steatopygism,\r\nindispensable to first-nighters, the concert-goers\xe2\x80\x99 friend, the....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLectulus Dei floridus,\xe2\x80\x9d intoned Mr. Porteous.\r\n\r\n             \xe2\x80\x9cGazophylacium Ecclesi\xc3\xa6,\r\n             Cithara benesonans Dei,\r\n             Cymbalum jubilationis Christi,\r\n             Promptuarium mysteriorum fidei, ora pro nobis.\r\n\r\nYour small-clothes sound to me very like one of my old litanies,\r\nTheodore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want scientific descriptions, not litanies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril Senior.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _are_ Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s Patent Small-Clothes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScientifically, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril Junior, \xe2\x80\x9cmy Patent Small-Clothes\r\nmay be described as trousers with a pneumatic seat, inflateable by means\r\nof a tube fitted with a valve; the whole constructed of stout seamless\r\nred rubber, enclosed between two layers of cloth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril Senior on a tone of somewhat grudging\r\napprobation, \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of worse inventions. You are too stout,\r\nPorteous, to be able to appreciate the idea. We Gumbrils are all a bony\r\nlot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I have taken out a patent for my invention,\xe2\x80\x9d his son went on, very\r\nbusiness-like and cool, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall either sell it to some capitalist, or I\r\nshall exploit it commercially myself. In either case, I shall make\r\nmoney, which is more, I may say, than you or any other Gumbril have ever\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril Senior, \xe2\x80\x9cquite right\xe2\x80\x9d; and he laughed very\r\ncheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd nor will you. You can be grateful to your intolerable\r\nAunt Flo for having left you that three hundred a year. You\xe2\x80\x99ll need it.\r\nBut if you really want a capitalist,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI have exactly the\r\nman for you. He\xe2\x80\x99s a man who has a mania for buying Tudor houses and\r\nmaking them more Tudor than they are. I\xe2\x80\x99ve pulled half a dozen of the\r\nwretched things to pieces and put them together again differently for\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound much good to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said his son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but that\xe2\x80\x99s only his vice. Only his amusement. His business,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGumbril Senior hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is his business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it seems to be everything. Patent medicine, trade newspapers,\r\nbankrupt tobacconist\xe2\x80\x99s stock\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s talked to me about those and heaps\r\nmore. He seems to flit like a butterfly in search of honey, or rather\r\nmoney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he makes it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he pays my fees and he buys more Tudor houses, and he gives me\r\nluncheons at the Ritz. That\xe2\x80\x99s all I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in trying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll write to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril Senior. \xe2\x80\x9cHis name is Boldero. He\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\neither laugh at your idea or take it and give you nothing for it.\r\nStill,\xe2\x80\x9d he looked at his son over the top of his spectacles, \xe2\x80\x9cif by any\r\nconceivable chance you ever should become rich; if, if, if....\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nemphasized the remoteness of the conditional by raising his eyebrows a\r\nlittle higher, by throwing out his hands in a dubious gesture a little\r\nfarther at every repetition of the word, \xe2\x80\x9cif\xe2\x80\x94why, then I\xe2\x80\x99ve got exactly\r\nthe thing for you. Look at this really delightful little idea I had this\r\nafternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d He put his hand in his coat pocket and after some sorting\r\nand sifting produced a sheet of squared paper on which was roughly drawn\r\nthe elevation of a house. \xe2\x80\x9cFor any one with eight or ten thousand to\r\nspend, this would be\xe2\x80\x94this would be....\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Senior smoothed his hair\r\nand hesitated, searching for something strong enough to say of his\r\nlittle idea. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, this would be much too good for most of the greasy\r\ndevils who do have eight or ten thousand to spend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe passed the sheet to Gumbril Junior, who held it out so that both Mr.\r\nPorteous and himself could look at it. Gumbril Senior got up from his\r\nchair and, standing behind them, leant over to elucidate and explain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see the idea,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, anxious lest they should fail to\r\nunderstand. \xe2\x80\x9cA central block of three stories, with low wings of only\r\none, ending in pavilions with a second floor. And the flat roofs of the\r\nwings are used as gardens\xe2\x80\x94you see?\xe2\x80\x94protected from the north by a wall.\r\nIn the east wing there is the kitchen and the garage, with the maids\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrooms in the pavilion at the end. The west is a library, and it has an\r\narcaded loggia along the front. And instead of a solid superstructure\r\ncorresponding to the maids\xe2\x80\x99 rooms, there\xe2\x80\x99s a pergola with brick piers.\r\nYou see? And in the main block there\xe2\x80\x99s a Spanish sort of balcony along\r\nthe whole length at first-floor level; that gives a good horizontal\r\nline. And you get the perpendiculars with coigns and raised panels. And\r\nthe roof\xe2\x80\x99s hidden by a balustrade, and there are balustrades along the\r\nopen sides of the roof gardens on the wings. All in brick it is. This is\r\nthe garden front; the entrance front will be admirable too. Do you like\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril Junior nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cVery much,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHis father sighed and taking the sketch put it back in his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmust hurry up with your ten thousand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you Porteous, and\r\nyou. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting so long to build your splendid house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaughing, Mr. Porteous got up from his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd long, dear Gumbril,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cmay you continue to wait. For my splendid house won\xe2\x80\x99t be built\r\nthis side of New Jerusalem, and you must go on living a long time yet. A\r\nlong, long time,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Porteous repeated; and carefully he buttoned up\r\nhis double-breasted coat, carefully, as though he were adjusting an\r\ninstrument of precision, he took out and replaced his monocle. Then,\r\nvery erect and neat, very soldierly and pillar-boxical, he marched\r\ntowards the door. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve kept me very late to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnconscionably late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe front door closed heavily behind Mr. Porteous\xe2\x80\x99s departure. Gumbril\r\nSenior came upstairs again into the big room on the first floor\r\nsmoothing down his hair, which the impetuosity of his ascent had once\r\nmore disarranged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of his departed guest, \xe2\x80\x9ca splendid\r\nfellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always admire the monocle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril Junior irrelevantly. But his\r\nfather turned the irrelevance into relevance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come through without it, I believe. It was a symbol, a\r\nproud flag. Poverty\xe2\x80\x99s squalid, not fine at all. The monocle made a kind\r\nof difference, you understand. I\xe2\x80\x99m always so enormously thankful I had a\r\nlittle money. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have stuck it without. It needs strength, more\r\nstrength than I\xe2\x80\x99ve got.\xe2\x80\x9d He clutched his beard close under the chin and\r\nremained for a moment pensively silent. \xe2\x80\x9cThe advantage of Porteous\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nline of business,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on at last, reflectively, \xe2\x80\x9cis that it can be\r\ncarried on by oneself, without collaboration. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to appeal\r\nto any one outside oneself, or to have any dealings with other people at\r\nall, if one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to. That\xe2\x80\x99s so deplorable about architecture.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no privacy, so to speak; always this horrible jostling with\r\nclients and builders and contractors and people, before one can get\r\nanything done. It\xe2\x80\x99s really revolting. I\xe2\x80\x99m not good at people. Most of\r\nthem I don\xe2\x80\x99t like at all, not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gumbril repeated with\r\nvehemence. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t deal with them very well; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t my business. My\r\nbusiness is architecture. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t often get a chance of practising\r\nit. Not properly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril Senior smiled rather sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cStill,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI can do\r\nsomething. I have my talent, I have my imagination. They can\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nthose from me. Come and see what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing lately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led the way out of the room and mounted, two steps at a time, towards\r\na higher floor. He opened the door of what should have been, in a\r\nwell-ordered house, the Best Bedroom, and slipped into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t rush in,\xe2\x80\x9d he called back to his son, \xe2\x80\x9cfor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t rush\r\nin. You\xe2\x80\x99ll smash something. Wait till I\xe2\x80\x99ve turned on the light. It\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nlike these asinine electricians to have hidden the switch behind the\r\ndoor like this.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Junior heard him fumbling in the darkness;\r\nthere was suddenly light. He stepped in.\r\n\r\nThe only furniture in the room consisted of a couple of long trestle\r\ntables. On these, on the mantelpiece and all over the floor, were\r\nscattered confusedly, like the elements of a jumbled city, a vast\r\ncollection of architectural models. There were cathedrals, there were\r\ntown halls, universities, public libraries, there were three or four\r\nelegant little sky-scrapers, there were blocks of offices, huge\r\nwarehouses, factories, and finally dozens of magnificent country\r\nmansions, complete with their terraced gardens, their noble flights of\r\nsteps, their fountains and ornamental waters and grandly bridged canals,\r\ntheir little rococo pavilions and garden houses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t they beautiful?\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Senior turned enthusiastically towards\r\nhis son. His long grey hair floated wispily about his head, his\r\nspectacles flashed, and behind them his eyes shone with emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Junior agreed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re really rich,\xe2\x80\x9d said his father, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll build you one of\r\nthese.\xe2\x80\x9d And he pointed to a little village of Chatsworths clustering, at\r\none end of a long table, round the dome of a vaster and austerer St.\r\nPeter\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at this one, for example.\xe2\x80\x9d He picked his way nimbly\r\nacross the room, seized the little electric reading-lamp that stood\r\nbetween a railway station and a baptistery on the mantelpiece, and was\r\nback again in an instant, trailing behind him a long flex that, as it\r\ntautened out, twitched one of the crowning pinnacles off the top of a\r\nsky-scraper near the fireplace. \xe2\x80\x9cLook,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, \xe2\x80\x9clook.\xe2\x80\x9d He switched\r\non the current, and moving the lamp back and forth, up and down in front\r\nof the miniature palace. \xe2\x80\x9cSee the beauty of the light and shade,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, underneath the great, ponderous cornice, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that fine?\r\nAnd look how splendidly the pilasters carry up the vertical lines. And\r\nthen the solidity of it, the size, the immense, impending bleakness of\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d He threw up his arms, he turned his eyes upwards as though standing\r\noverwhelmed at the foot of some huge precipitous fa\xc3\xa7ade. The lights and\r\nshadows vacillated wildly through all the city of palaces and domes as\r\nhe brandished the lamp in ecstasy above his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then,\xe2\x80\x9d he had suddenly stooped down, he was peering and pointing\r\nonce more into the details of his palace, \xe2\x80\x9cthen there\xe2\x80\x99s the doorway\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nflorid and rich with carving. How magnificently and surprisingly it\r\nflowers out of the bare walls! Like the colossal writing of Darius, like\r\nthe figures graven in the bald face of the precipice over\r\nBehistun\xe2\x80\x94unexpected and beautiful and human, human in the surrounding\r\nemptiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril Senior brushed back his hair and turned, smiling, to look at his\r\nson over the top of his spectacles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery fine,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Junior nodded to him. \xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t the wall a little\r\ntoo blank? You seem to allow very few windows in this vast palazzo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d his father replied, \xe2\x80\x9cvery true.\xe2\x80\x9d He sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid this\r\ndesign would hardly do for England. It\xe2\x80\x99s meant for a place where there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsome sun\xe2\x80\x94where you do your best to keep the light out, instead of\r\nletting it in, as you have to do here. Windows are the curse of\r\narchitecture in this country. Your walls have to be like sieves, all\r\nholes, it\xe2\x80\x99s heart-breaking. If you wanted me to build you this house,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d have to live in Barbados or somewhere like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I should like better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril Junior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother great advantage of sunny countries,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Senior pursued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis that one can really live like an aristocrat, in privacy, by oneself.\r\nNo need to look out on the dirty world or to let the dirty world look in\r\non you. Here\xe2\x80\x99s this great house, for example, looking out on the world\r\nthrough a few dark portholes and a single cavernous doorway. But look\r\ninside.\xe2\x80\x9d He held his lamp above the courtyard that was at the heart of\r\nthe palace. Gumbril Junior leaned and looked, like his father. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the\r\nlife looks inwards\xe2\x80\x94into a lovely courtyard, a more than Spanish _patio_.\r\nLook there at the treble tiers of arcades, the vaulted cloisters for\r\nyour cool peripatetic meditations, the central Triton spouting white\r\nwater into a marble pool, the mosaic work on the floor and flowering up\r\nthe walls, brilliant against the white stucco. And there\xe2\x80\x99s the archway\r\nthat leads out into the gardens. And now you must come and have a look\r\nat the garden front.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe walked round with his lamp to the other side of the table. There was\r\nsuddenly a crash; the wire had twitched a cathedral from off the table.\r\nIt lay on the floor in disastrous ruin as though shattered by some\r\nappalling cataclysm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHell and death!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril Senior in an outburst of Elizabethan\r\nfury. He put down the lamp and ran to see how irreparable the disaster\r\nhad been. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re so horribly expensive, these models,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained,\r\nas he bent over the ruins. Tenderly he picked up the pieces and replaced\r\nthem on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cIt might have been worse,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, brushing\r\nthe dust off his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cThough I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid that dome will never be quite\r\nthe same again.\xe2\x80\x9d Picking up the lamp once more, he held it high above\r\nhis head and stood looking out, with a melancholy satisfaction, over his\r\ncreations. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd to think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nspending these last days designing model cottages for workmen at\r\nBletchley! I\xe2\x80\x99m in luck to have got the job, of course, but really, that\r\na civilized man should have to do jobs like that! It\xe2\x80\x99s too much. In the\r\nold days these creatures built their own hovels, and very nice and\r\nsuitable they were too. The architects busied themselves with\r\narchitecture\xe2\x80\x94which is the expression of human dignity and greatness,\r\nwhich is man\xe2\x80\x99s protest, not his miserable acquiescence. You can\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nmuch protesting in a model cottage at seven hundred pounds a time. A\r\nlittle, no doubt, you can protest a little; you can give your cottage\r\ndecent proportions and avoid sordidness and vulgarity. But that\xe2\x80\x99s all;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s really a negative process. You can only begin to protest positively\r\nand actively when you abandon the petty human scale and build for\r\ngiants\xe2\x80\x94when you build for the spirit and the imagination of man, not for\r\nhis little body. Model cottages, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Gumbril snorted with indignation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I think of Alberti!\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nthought of Alberti\xe2\x80\x94Alberti, the noblest Roman of them all, the true and\r\nonly Roman. For the Romans themselves had lived their own actual lives,\r\nsordidly and extravagantly in the middle of a vulgar empire. Alberti and\r\nhis followers in the Renaissance lived the ideal Roman life. They put\r\nPlutarch into their architecture. They took the detestable real Cato,\r\nthe Brutus of history, and made of them Roman heroes to walk as guides\r\nand models before them. Before Alberti there were no true Romans, and\r\nwith Piranesi\xe2\x80\x99s death the race began to wither towards extinction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when I think of Brunelleschi!\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Senior went on to remember\r\nwith passion the architect who had suspended on eight thin flying ribs\r\nof marble the lightest of all domes and the loveliest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when of Michelangelo! The grim, enormous apse.... And of Wren and\r\nof Palladio, when I think of all these\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Senior waved his arms\r\nand was silent. He could not put into words what he felt when he thought\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nGumbril Junior looked at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cHalf-past two,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTime to\r\ngo to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMister Gumbril!\xe2\x80\x9d Surprise was mingled with delight. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is indeed a\r\npleasure!\xe2\x80\x9d Delight was now the prevailing emotion expressed by the voice\r\nthat advanced, as yet without a visible source, from the dark recesses\r\nof the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pleasure, Mr. Bojanus, is mine.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril closed the shop door\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nA very small man, dressed in a frock-coat, popped out from a canyon that\r\nopened, a mere black crevice, between two stratified precipices of\r\nmid-season suitings, and advancing into the open space before the door\r\nbowed with an old-world grace, revealing a nacreous scalp thinly mantled\r\nwith long damp creepers of brown hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to what, may I ask, do I owe this pleasure, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bojanus\r\nlooked up archly with a sideways cock of his head that tilted the rigid\r\npoints of his waxed moustache. The fingers of his right hand were thrust\r\ninto the bosom of his frock-coat and his toes were turned out in the\r\ndancing-master\xe2\x80\x99s First Position. \xe2\x80\x9cA light spring great-coat, is it? Or a\r\nnew suit? I notice,\xe2\x80\x9d his eye travelled professionally up and down\r\nGumbril\xe2\x80\x99s long, thin form, \xe2\x80\x9cI notice that the garments you are wearing\r\nat present, Mr. Gumbril, look\xe2\x80\x94how shall I say?\xe2\x80\x94well, a trifle negleejay,\r\nas the French would put it, a trifle negleejay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril looked down at himself. He resented Mr. Bojanus\xe2\x80\x99s negleejay, he\r\nwas pained and wounded by the aspersion. Negleejay? And he had fancied\r\nthat he really looked rather elegant and distinguished (but, after all,\r\nhe always looked that, even in rags)\xe2\x80\x94no, that he looked positively neat,\r\nlike Mr. Porteous, positively soldierly in his black jacket and his\r\nmusical comedy trousers and his patent leather shoes. And the black felt\r\nhat\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t that just add the foreign, the Southern touch which saved the\r\nwhole composition from banality? He regarded himself, trying to see his\r\nclothes\xe2\x80\x94garments, Mr. Bojanus had called them; garments, good\r\nLord!\xe2\x80\x94through the tailor\xe2\x80\x99s expert eyes. There were sagging folds about\r\nthe overloaded pockets, there was a stain on his waistcoat, the knees of\r\nhis trousers were baggy and puckered like the bare knees of H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\r\nFourmont in Rubens\xe2\x80\x99s fur-coat portrait at Vienna. Yes, it was all\r\nhorribly negleejay. He felt depressed; but looking at Mr. Bojanus\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstudied and professional correctness, he was a little comforted. That\r\nfrock-coat, for example. It was like something in a very modern\r\npicture\xe2\x80\x94such a smooth, unwrinkled cylinder about the chest, such a sense\r\nof pure and abstract conic-ness in the sleekly rounded skirts! Nothing\r\ncould have been less negleejay. He was reassured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, clearing his throat importantly, \xe2\x80\x9cto make\r\nme a pair of trousers to a novel specification of my own. It\xe2\x80\x99s a new\r\nidea.\xe2\x80\x9d And he gave a brief description of Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s Patent Small\r\nClothes.\r\n\r\nMr. Bojanus listened with attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can make them for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when the description was finished.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can make them for you\xe2\x80\x94if you _really_ wish, Mr. Gumbril,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you intend, may I ask, Mr. Gumbril, to _wear_ these ... these\r\ngarments?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGuiltily, Gumbril denied himself. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly to demonstrate the idea, Mr.\r\nBojanus. I am exploiting the invention commercially, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommercially? I see, Mr. Gumbril.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you would like a share,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Gumbril.\r\n\r\nMr. Bojanus shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do for my cleeantail, I fear,\r\nMr. Gumbril. You could \xe2\x80\x99ardly expect the Best People to wear such\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bojanus went on shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI know them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nthe Best People. Well.\xe2\x80\x9d And he added with an irrelevance that was,\r\nperhaps, only apparent, \xe2\x80\x9cBetween ourselves, Mr. Gumbril, I am a great\r\nadmirer of Lenin....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, \xe2\x80\x9ctheoretically. But then I have so little to\r\nlose to Lenin. I can afford to admire him. But you, Mr. Bojanus, you,\r\nthe prosperous bourgeois\xe2\x80\x94oh, purely in the economic sense of the word,\r\nMr. Bojanus....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bojanus accepted the explanation with one of his old-world bows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... you would be among the first to suffer if an English Lenin were to\r\nstart his activities here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, Mr. Gumbril, if I may be allowed to say so, you are wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nBojanus removed his hand from his bosom and employed it to emphasize the\r\npoints of his discourse. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the revolution comes, Mr. Gumbril\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ngreat and necessary revolution, as Alderman Beckford called it\xe2\x80\x94it won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe the owning of a little money that\xe2\x80\x99ll get a man into trouble. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nhis class-habits, Mr. Gumbril, his class-speech, his class-education.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be Shibboleth all over again, Mr. Gumbril; mark my words. The Red\r\nGuards will stop people in the street and ask them to say some such word\r\nas \xe2\x80\x98towel.\xe2\x80\x99 If they call it \xe2\x80\x98towel,\xe2\x80\x99 like you and your friends, Mr.\r\nGumbril, why then....\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bojanus went through the gestures of pointing\r\na rifle and pulling the trigger; he clicked his tongue against his teeth\r\nto symbolize the report.... \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll be the end of them. But if they say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98t\xc3\xa8aul,\xe2\x80\x99 like the rest of us, Mr. Gumbril, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be: \xe2\x80\x98Pass Friend and\r\nLong Live the Proletariat.\xe2\x80\x99 Long live T\xc3\xa8aul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you may be right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m convinced of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bojanus. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my clients, Mr. Gumbril,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s the Best People that the other people resent. It\xe2\x80\x99s their\r\nconfidence, their ease, it\xe2\x80\x99s the habit their money and their position\r\ngive them of ordering people about, it\xe2\x80\x99s the way they take their place\r\nin the world for granted, it\xe2\x80\x99s their prestige, which the other people\r\nwould like to deny, but can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all that, Mr. Gumbril, that\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\ngalling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril nodded. He himself had envied his securer friends their power of\r\nignoring the humanity of those who were not of their class. To do that\r\nreally well, one must always have lived in a large house full of\r\nclockwork servants; one must never have been short of money, never at a\r\nrestaurant ordered the cheaper thing instead of the more delicious; one\r\nmust never have regarded a policeman as anything but one\xe2\x80\x99s paid defender\r\nagainst the lower orders, never for a moment have doubted one\xe2\x80\x99s divine\r\nright to do, within the accepted limits, exactly what one liked without\r\na further thought to anything or any one but oneself and one\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nenjoyment. Gumbril had been brought up among these blessed beings; but\r\nhe was not one of them. Alas? or fortunately? He hardly knew which.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what good do you expect the revolution to do, Mr. Bojanus?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked at last.\r\n\r\nMr. Bojanus replaced his hand in his bosom. \xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever, Mr.\r\nGumbril,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cequality and all that. What about\r\nthose, Mr. Bojanus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bojanus smiled up at him tolerantly and kindly, as he might have\r\nsmiled at some one who had suggested, shall we say, that evening\r\ntrousers should be turned up at the bottom. \xe2\x80\x9cLiberty, Mr. Gumbril?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid; \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose any serious-minded person imagines a revolution\r\nis going to bring liberty, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe people who make the revolution always seem to ask for liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do they ever get it, Mr. Gumbril?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bojanus cocked his head\r\nplayfully and smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at \xe2\x80\x99istory, Mr. Gumbril, look at \xe2\x80\x99istory.\r\nFirst it\xe2\x80\x99s the French Revolution. They ask for political liberty. And\r\nthey gets it. Then comes the Reform Bill, then Forty-Eight, then all the\r\nFranchise Acts and Votes for Women\xe2\x80\x94always more and more political\r\nliberty. And what\xe2\x80\x99s the result, Mr. Gumbril? Nothing at all. Who\xe2\x80\x99s freer\r\nfor political liberty? Not a soul, Mr. Gumbril. There was never a\r\ngreater swindle \xe2\x80\x99atched in the \xe2\x80\x99ole of \xe2\x80\x99istory. And when you think \xe2\x80\x99ow\r\nthose poor young men like Shelley talked about it\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s pathetic,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Bojanus, shaking his head, \xe2\x80\x9creelly pathetic. Political liberty\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nswindle because a man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t spend his time being political. He spends\r\nit sleeping, eating, amusing himself a little and working\xe2\x80\x94mostly\r\nworking. When they\xe2\x80\x99d got all the political liberty they wanted\xe2\x80\x94or found\r\nthey didn\xe2\x80\x99t want\xe2\x80\x94they began to understand this. And so now it\xe2\x80\x99s all for\r\nthe industrial revolution, Mr. Gumbril. But bless you, that\xe2\x80\x99s as big a\r\nswindle as the other. How can there ever be liberty under any system? No\r\namount of profit-sharing or self-government by the workers, no amount of\r\nhyjeenic conditions or cocoa villages or recreation grounds can get rid\r\nof the fundamental slavery\xe2\x80\x94the necessity of working. Liberty? why, it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist! There\xe2\x80\x99s no liberty in this world; only gilded cages. And\r\nthen, Mr. Gumbril, even suppose you could somehow get rid of the\r\nnecessity of working, suppose a man\xe2\x80\x99s time were all leisure. Would he be\r\nfree then? I say nothing of the natural slavery of eating and sleeping\r\nand all that, Mr. Gumbril; I say nothing of that, because that, if I may\r\nsay so, would be too \xe2\x80\x99air-splitting and metaphysical. But what I do ask\r\nyou is this,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Bojanus wagged his forefinger almost menacingly at\r\nthe sleeping partner in this dialogue: \xe2\x80\x9cwould a man with unlimited\r\nleisure be free, Mr. Gumbril? I say he would not. Not unless he \xe2\x80\x99appened\r\nto be a man like you or me, Mr. Gumbril, a man of sense, a man of\r\nindependent judgment. An ordinary man would not be free. Because he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to occupy his leisure except in some way that would be\r\nforced on \xe2\x80\x99im by other people. People don\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\x99ow to entertain\r\nthemselves now; they leave it to other people to do it for them. They\r\nswallow what\xe2\x80\x99s given them. They \xe2\x80\x99ave to swallow it, whether they like it\r\nor not. Cinemas, newspapers, magazines, gramophones, football matches,\r\nwireless telephones\xe2\x80\x94take them or leave them, if you want to amuse\r\nyouself. The ordinary man can\xe2\x80\x99t leave them. He takes; and what\xe2\x80\x99s that\r\nbut slavery? And so you see, Mr. Gumbril,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bojanus smiled with a\r\nkind of roguish triumph, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see that even in the purely \xe2\x80\x99ypothetical\r\ncase of a man with indefinite leisure, there still would be no\r\nfreedom.... And the case, as I have said, is purely \xe2\x80\x99ypothetical; at any\r\nrate so far as concerns the sort of people who want a revolution. And as\r\nfor the sort of people who do enjoy leisure, even now\xe2\x80\x94why I think, Mr.\r\nGumbril, you and I know enough about the Best People to know that\r\nfreedom, except possibly sexual freedom, is not their strongest point.\r\nAnd sexual freedom\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bojanus dramatically inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nand I, Mr. Gumbril,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered confidentially, \xe2\x80\x9cwe know. It\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\n\xe2\x80\x99orrible, \xe2\x80\x99ideous slavery. That\xe2\x80\x99s what it is. Or am I wrong, Mr.\r\nGumbril?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, quite right, Mr. Bojanus,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril hastened to reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom all of which,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Bojanus, \xe2\x80\x9cit follows that, except for\r\na few, a very few people like you and me, Mr. Gumbril, there\xe2\x80\x99s no such\r\nthing as liberty. It\xe2\x80\x99s an \xe2\x80\x99oax, Mr. Gumbril. An \xe2\x80\x99orrible plant. And if I\r\nmay be allowed to say so,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bojanus lowered his voice, but still\r\nspoke with emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9ca bloody swindle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in that case, Mr. Bojanus, why are you so anxious to have a\r\nrevolution?\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril inquired.\r\n\r\nThoughtfully, Mr. Bojanus twisted to a finer point his waxed moustaches.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be a nice change. I was always one\r\nfor change and a little excitement. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s the scientific\r\ninterest. You never quite know \xe2\x80\x99ow an experiment will turn out, do you,\r\nMr. Gumbril? I remember when I was a boy, my old dad\xe2\x80\x94a great gardener he\r\nwas, a regular floriculturist, you might say, Mr. Gumbril\xe2\x80\x94he tried the\r\nexperiment of grafting a sprig of Gloire de Dijon on to a black currant\r\nbush. And, would you believe it? the roses came out black, coal black,\r\nMr. Gumbril. Nobody would ever have guessed that if the thing had never\r\nbeen tried. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what I say about the revolution. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99ll come of it till you try. Black roses, blue roses\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99oo knows, Mr.\r\nGumbril, \xe2\x80\x99oo knows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril looked at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cAbout those trousers ...\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose garments,\xe2\x80\x9d corrected Mr. Bojanus. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes. Should we say next\r\nTuesday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us say next Tuesday.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril opened the shop door. \xe2\x80\x9cGood morning,\r\nMr. Bojanus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bojanus bowed him out, as though he had been a prince of the blood.\r\n\r\nThe sun was shining and at the end of the street between the houses the\r\nsky was blue. Gauzily the distances faded to a soft rich indistinctness;\r\nthere were veils of golden muslin thickening down the length of every\r\nvista. On the trees in the Hanover Square gardens the young leaves were\r\nstill so green that they seemed to be alight, green fire, and the sooty\r\ntrunks looked blacker and dirtier than ever. It would have been a\r\npleasant and apposite thing if a cuckoo had started calling. But though\r\nthe cuckoo was silent it was a happy day. A day, Gumbril reflected, as\r\nhe strolled idly along, to be in love.\r\n\r\nFrom the world of tailors Gumbril passed into that of the artificial\r\npearl merchants and with a still keener appreciation of the amorous\r\nqualities of this clear spring day, he began a leisured march along the\r\nperfumed pavements of Bond Street. He thought with a profound\r\nsatisfaction of those sixty-three papers on the Risorgimento. How\r\npleasant it was to waste time! And Bond Street offered so many\r\nopportunities for wasting it agreeably. He trotted round the Spring\r\nExhibition at the Grosvenor and came out, a little regretting, he had to\r\nconfess, his eighteen pence for admission. After that, he pretended that\r\nhe wanted to buy a grand piano. When he had finished practising his\r\nfavourite passages on the magnificent instrument to which they\r\nobsequiously introduced him, he looked in for a few moments at\r\nSotheby\xe2\x80\x99s, sniffed among the ancient books and strolled on again,\r\nadmiring the cigars, the lucid scent-bottles, the socks, the old\r\nmasters, the emerald necklaces, everything, in fact, in all the shops he\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Forthcoming Exhibition of Works by Casimir Lypiatt.\xe2\x80\x99 The announcement\r\ncaught his eye. And so poor old Lypiatt was on the warpath again, he\r\nreflected, as he pushed open the doors of the Albemarle Galleries. Poor\r\nold Lypiatt! Dear old Lypiatt, even. He liked Lypiatt. Though he had his\r\ndefects. It would be fun to see him again.\r\n\r\nGumbril found himself in the midst of a dismal collection of etchings.\r\nHe passed them in review, wondering why it was that, in these hard days\r\nwhen no painter can sell a picture, almost any dull fool who can scratch\r\na conventional etcher\xe2\x80\x99s view of two boats, a suggested cloud and the\r\nflat sea should be able to get rid of his prints by the dozen and at\r\nguineas apiece. He was interrupted in his speculations by the approach\r\nof the assistant in charge of the gallery. He came up shyly and\r\nuncomfortably, but with the conscientious determination of one ambitious\r\nto do his duty and make good. He was a very young man with pale hair, to\r\nwhich heavy oiling had given a curious greyish colour, and a face of\r\nsuch childish contour and so imberb that he looked like a little boy\r\nplaying at grown-ups. He had only been at this job a few weeks and he\r\nfound it very difficult.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, with a little introductory cough, pointing to one\r\nview of the two boats and the flat sea, \xe2\x80\x9cis an earlier state than this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he pointed to another view, where the boats were still two and the\r\nsea seemed just as flat\xe2\x80\x94though possibly, on a closer inspection, it\r\nmight really have been flatter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\nThe assistant was rather pained by his coldness. He blushed; but\r\nconstrained himself to go on. \xe2\x80\x9cSome excellent judges,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cprefer\r\nthe earlier state, though it is less highly finished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful atmosphere, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d The assistant put his head on one side\r\nand pursed his childish lips appreciatively.\r\n\r\nGumbril nodded.\r\n\r\nWith desperation, the assistant indicated the shadowed rump of one of\r\nthe boats. \xe2\x80\x9cA wonderful feeling in this passage,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, redder than\r\never.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery intense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\nThe assistant smiled at him gratefully. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the word,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\ndelighted. \xe2\x80\x9cIntense. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. Very intense.\xe2\x80\x9d He repeated the word\r\nseveral times as though to make sure of remembering it when the occasion\r\nnext presented itself. He was determined to make good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see Mr. Lypiatt is to have a show here soon,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Gumbril, who\r\nhad had enough of the boats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is making the final arrangements with Mr. Albemarle at this very\r\nmoment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the assistant triumphantly, with the air of one who\r\nproduces, at the dramatic and critical moment, a rabbit out of the empty\r\nhat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say so?\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril was duly impressed. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait till he\r\ncomes out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and sat down with his back to the boats.\r\n\r\nThe assistant returned to his desk and picked up the gold-belted\r\nfountain pen which his Aunt had given him when he first went into\r\nbusiness, last Christmas. \xe2\x80\x9cVery intense,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in capitals on a\r\nhalf-sheet of notepaper. \xe2\x80\x9cThe feeling in this passage is very intense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe studied the paper for a few moments, then folded it up carefully and\r\nput it away in his waistcoat pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cAlways make a note of it.\xe2\x80\x9d That\r\nwas one of the business mottoes he had himself written out so\r\nlaboriously in Indian ink and old English lettering. It hung over his\r\nbed between \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord is my Shepherd,\xe2\x80\x9d which his mother had given him,\r\nand a quotation from Dr. Frank Crane, \xe2\x80\x9cA smiling face sells more goods\r\nthan a clever tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d Still, a clever tongue, the young assistant had\r\noften reflected, was a very useful thing, especially in this job. He\r\nwondered whether one could say that the composition of a picture was\r\nvery intense. Mr. Albemarle was very keen on the composition, he\r\nnoticed. But perhaps it was better to stick to plain \xe2\x80\x98fine,\xe2\x80\x99 which was a\r\nlittle commonplace, perhaps, but very safe. He would ask Mr. Albemarle\r\nabout it. And then there was all that stuff about plastic values and\r\npure plasticity. He sighed. It was all very difficult. A chap might be\r\nas willing and eager to make good as he liked; but when it came to this\r\nabout atmosphere and intense passages and plasticity\xe2\x80\x94well, really, what\r\ncould a chap do? Make a note of it. It was the only thing.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Albemarle\xe2\x80\x99s private room Casimir Lypiatt thumped the table.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSize, Mr. Albemarle,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying, \xe2\x80\x9csize and vehemence and spiritual\r\nsignificance\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what the old fellows had, and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t....\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ngesticulated as he talked, his face worked and his green eyes, set in\r\ntheir dark, charred orbits, were full of a troubled light. The forehead\r\nwas precipitous, the nose long and sharp; in the bony and almost\r\nfleshless face, the lips of the wide mouth were surprisingly full.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely, precisely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Albemarle in his juicy voice. He was a\r\nround, smooth, little man with a head like an egg; he spoke, he moved\r\nwith a certain pomp, a butlerish gravity, that were evidently meant to\r\nbe ducal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve set myself to recapture,\xe2\x80\x9d Lypiatt went on: \xe2\x80\x9cthe size,\r\nthe masterfulness of the masters.\xe2\x80\x9d He felt a warmth running through him\r\nas he spoke, flushing his cheeks, pulsing hotly behind the eyes, as\r\nthough he had drunk a draught of some heartening red wine. His own words\r\nelated him, and drunkenly gesticulating, he was as though drunken. The\r\ngreatness of the masters\xe2\x80\x94he felt it in him. He knew his own power, he\r\nknew, he knew. He could do all that they had done. Nothing was beyond\r\nhis strength.\r\n\r\nEgg-headed Albemarle confronted him, impeccably the butler,\r\nexacerbatingly serene. Albemarle too should be fired. He struck the\r\ntable once more, he broke out again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been my mission,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, \xe2\x80\x9call these years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll these years.... Time had worn the hair from his temples; the high,\r\nsteep forehead seemed higher than it really was. He was forty now; the\r\nturbulent young Lypiatt who had once declared that no man could do\r\nanything worth doing after he was thirty, was forty now. But in these\r\nfiery moments he could forget the years, he could forget the\r\ndisappointments, the unsold pictures, the bad reviews. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mission,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated; \xe2\x80\x9cand by God! I feel, I know I can carry it through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWarmly the blood pulsed behind his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Albemarle, nodding the egg. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how small the scale is nowadays!\xe2\x80\x9d Lypiatt went on, rhapsodically.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow trivial the conception, how limited the scope! You see no\r\npainter-sculptor-poets, like Michelangelo; no scientist-artists, like\r\nLeonardo; no mathematician-courtiers, like Boscovitch; no\r\nimpresario-musicians, like Handel; no geniuses of all trades, like Wren.\r\nI have set myself against this abject specialization of ours. I stand\r\nalone, opposing it with my example.\xe2\x80\x9d Lypiatt raised his hand. Like the\r\nstatue of Liberty, standing colossal and alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d began Mr. Albemarle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPainter, poet, musician,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lypiatt. \xe2\x80\x9cI am all three. I....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... there is a danger of\xe2\x80\x94how shall I put it\xe2\x80\x94dissipating one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenergies,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Albemarle went on with determination. Discreetly, he\r\nlooked at his watch. This conversation, he thought, seemed to be\r\nprolonging itself unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a greater danger in letting them stagnate and atrophy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nLypiatt retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me give you my experience.\xe2\x80\x9d Vehemently, he gave\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOut in the gallery, among the boats, the views of the Grand Canal, and\r\nthe Firth of Forth, Gumbril placidly ruminated. Poor old Lypiatt, he was\r\nthinking. Dear old Lypiatt, even, in spite of his fantastic egotism.\r\nSuch a bad painter, such a bombinating poet, such a loud emotional\r\nimproviser on the piano! And going on like this, year after year,\r\npegging away at the same old things\xe2\x80\x94always badly! And always without a\r\npenny, always living in the most hideous squalor! Magnificent and\r\npathetic old Lypiatt!\r\n\r\nA door suddenly opened and a loud, unsteady voice, now deep and harsh,\r\nnow breaking to shrillness, exploded into the gallery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... like a Veronese,\xe2\x80\x9d it was saying; \xe2\x80\x9cenormous, vehement, a great\r\nswirling composition\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x98swirling composition\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94mentally, the young\r\nassistant made a note of that), \xe2\x80\x9cbut much more serious, of course, much\r\nmore spiritually significant, much more\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLypiatt!\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril had risen from his chair, had turned, had advanced,\r\nholding out his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s Gumbril. Good Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d and Lypiatt seized the proffered hand\r\nwith an excruciating cordiality. He seemed to be in exuberantly good\r\nspirits. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re settling about my show, Mr. Albemarle and I,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexplained. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know Gumbril, Mr. Albemarle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPleased to meet you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Albemarle. \xe2\x80\x9cOur friend, Mr. Lypiatt,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded richly, \xe2\x80\x9chas the true artistic temp\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to be magnificent.\xe2\x80\x9d Lypiatt could not wait till Mr.\r\nAlbemarle had finished speaking. He gave Gumbril a heroic blow on the\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... artistic temperament, as I was saying,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr. Albemarle. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nis altogether too impatient and enthusiastic for us poor people ...\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\nducal smile of condescension accompanied this graceful act of\r\nself-abasement ... \xe2\x80\x9cwho move in the prosaic, practical, workaday world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLypiatt laughed, a loud, discordant peal. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to mind being\r\naccused of having an artistic temperament; he seemed, indeed, to enjoy\r\nit, if anything. \xe2\x80\x9cFire and water,\xe2\x80\x9d he said aphoristically, \xe2\x80\x9cbrought\r\ntogether, beget steam. Mr. Albemarle and I go driving along like a steam\r\nengine. Psh, psh!\xe2\x80\x9d He worked his arms like a pair of alternate pistons.\r\nHe laughed; but Mr. Albemarle only coldly and courteously smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\njust telling Mr. Albemarle about the great Crucifixion I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been\r\ndoing. It\xe2\x80\x99s as big and headlong as a Veronese, but much more serious,\r\nmore....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBehind them the little assistant was expounding to a new visitor the\r\nbeauties of the etchings. \xe2\x80\x9cVery intense,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cthe feeling in\r\nthis passage.\xe2\x80\x9d The shadow, indeed, clung with an insistent affection\r\nround the stern of the boat. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what a fine, what a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he hesitated\r\nfor an instant, and under his pale, oiled hair his face became suddenly\r\nvery red\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat a swirling composition.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked anxiously at the\r\nvisitor. The remark had been received without comment. He felt immensely\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\nThey left the galleries together. Lypiatt set the pace, striding along\r\nat a great rate and with a magnificent brutality through the elegant and\r\nleisured crowd, gesticulating and loudly talking as he went. He carried\r\nhis hat in his hand; his tie was brilliantly orange. People turned to\r\nlook at him as he passed and he liked it. He had, indeed, a remarkable\r\nface\xe2\x80\x94a face that ought by rights to have belonged to a man of genius.\r\nLypiatt was aware of it. The man of genius, he liked to say, bears upon\r\nhis brow a kind of mark of Cain, by which men recognize him at once\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nhaving recognized, generally stone him,\xe2\x80\x9d he would add with that peculiar\r\nlaugh he always uttered whenever he said anything rather bitter or\r\ncynical; a laugh that was meant to show that the bitterness, the\r\ncynicism, justifiable as events might have made them, were really only a\r\nmask, and that beneath it the artist was still serenely and tragically\r\nsmiling. Lypiatt thought a great deal about the ideal artist. That\r\ntitanic abstraction stalked within his own skin. He was it\xe2\x80\x94a little too\r\nconsciously, perhaps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis time,\xe2\x80\x9d he kept repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99ll be bowled over. This time....\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to be terrific.\xe2\x80\x9d And with the blood beating behind his eyes,\r\nwith the exultant consciousness and certainty of power growing and\r\ngrowing in him with every word he spoke, Lypiatt began to describe the\r\npictures there would be at his show; he talked about the preface he was\r\nwriting to the catalogue, the poems that would be printed in it by way\r\nof literary complement to the pictures. He talked, he talked.\r\n\r\nGumbril listened, not very attentively. He was wondering how any one\r\ncould talk so loud, could boast so extravagantly. It was as though the\r\nman had to shout in order to convince himself of his own existence. Poor\r\nLypiatt; after all these years, Gumbril supposed, he must have some\r\ndoubts about it. Ah, but this time, this time he was going to bowl them\r\nall over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re pleased, then, with what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done recently,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at the\r\nend of one of Lypiatt\xe2\x80\x99s long tirades.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPleased?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lypiatt; \xe2\x80\x9cI should think I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril might have reminded him that he had been as well pleased in the\r\npast and that \xe2\x80\x98they\xe2\x80\x99 had by no means been bowled over. He preferred,\r\nhowever, to say nothing. Lypiatt went on about the size and universality\r\nof the old masters. He himself, it was tacitly understood, was one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey parted near the bottom of the Tottenham Court Road, Lypiatt to go\r\nnorthward to his studio off Maple Street, Gumbril to pay one of his\r\nsecret visits to those rooms of his in Great Russell Street. He had\r\ntaken them nearly a year ago now, two little rooms over a grocer\xe2\x80\x99s shop,\r\npromising himself goodness only knew what adventures in them. But\r\nsomehow there had been no adventures. Still, it had pleased him, all the\r\nsame, to be able to go there from time to time when he was in London and\r\nto think, as he sat in solitude before his gas fire, that there was\r\nliterally not a soul in the universe who knew where he was. He had an\r\nalmost childish affection for mysteries and secrets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, raising his hand to the salute. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll beat\r\nup some people for dinner on Friday.\xe2\x80\x9d (For they had agreed to meet\r\nagain.) He turned away, thinking that he had spoken the last words; but\r\nhe was mistaken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, by the way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lypiatt, who had also turned to go, but who now\r\ncame stepping quickly after his companion. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you, by any chance, lend\r\nme five pounds. Only till after the exhibition, you know. I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit\r\nshort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor old Lypiatt! But it was with reluctance that Gumbril parted from\r\nhis Treasury notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nLypiatt had a habit, which some of his friends found rather trying\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nnot only friends, for Lypiatt was ready to let the merest acquaintances,\r\nthe most absolute strangers, even, into the secrets of his inspiration\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nhabit of reciting at every possible opportunity his own verses. He would\r\ndeclaim in a voice loud and tremulous, with an emotion that never seemed\r\nto vary with the varying subject-matter of his poems, for whole quarters\r\nof an hour at a stretch; would go on declaiming till his auditors were\r\noverwhelmed with such a confusion of embarrassment and shame, that the\r\nblood rushed to their cheeks and they dared not meet one another\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\nHe was declaiming now; not merely across the dinner table to his own\r\nfriends, but to the whole restaurant. For at the first reverberating\r\nlines of his latest, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Conquistador,\xe2\x80\x9d there had been a startled\r\nturning of heads, a craning of necks from every corner of the room. The\r\npeople who came to this Soho restaurant because it was, notoriously, so\r\n\xe2\x80\x98artistic,\xe2\x80\x99 looked at one another significantly and nodded; they were\r\ngetting their money\xe2\x80\x99s worth, this time. And Lypiatt, with a fine air of\r\nrapt unconsciousness, went on with his recitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook down on Mexico, Conquistador\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that was the refrain.\r\n\r\nThe Conquistador, Lypiatt had made it clear, was the Artist, and the\r\nVale of Mexico on which he looked down, the towered cities of Tlacopan\r\nand Chalco, of Tenochtitlan and Iztapalapan symbolized\xe2\x80\x94well, it was\r\ndifficult to say precisely what. The universe, perhaps?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook down,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lypiatt, with a quivering voice.\r\n\r\n            \xe2\x80\x9cLook down, Conquistador!\r\n            There on the valley\xe2\x80\x99s broad green floor,\r\n            There lies the lake; the jewelled cities gleam;\r\n            Chalco and Tlacopan\r\n            Awaiting the coming Man.\r\n            Look down on Mexico, Conquistador,\r\n            Land of your golden dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot \xe2\x80\x98dream,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, putting down the glass from which he had\r\nbeen profoundly drinking. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly say \xe2\x80\x98dream,\xe2\x80\x99 you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you interrupt me?\xe2\x80\x9d Lypiatt turned on him angrily. His wide mouth\r\ntwitched at the corners, his whole long face worked with excitement.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you let me finish?\xe2\x80\x9d He allowed his hand, which had hung\r\nawkwardly in the air above him, suspended, as it were, at the top of a\r\ngesture, to sink slowly to the table. \xe2\x80\x9cImbecile!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and once more\r\npicked up his knife and fork.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut really,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril insisted, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98dream.\xe2\x80\x99 Can you now,\r\nseriously?\xe2\x80\x9d He had drunk the best part of a bottle of Burgundy and he\r\nfelt good-humoured, obstinate and a little bellicose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not?\xe2\x80\x9d Lypiatt asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, because one simply can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril leaned back in his chair, smiled\r\nand caressed his drooping blond moustache. \xe2\x80\x9cNot in this year of grace,\r\nnineteen twenty-two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d Lypiatt repeated, with exasperation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s altogether _too_ late in the day,\xe2\x80\x9d declared precious Mr.\r\nMercaptan, rushing up to his emphasis with flutes and roaring, like a\r\ntrue Conquistador, to fall back, however, at the end of the sentence\r\nrather ignominiously into a breathless confusion. He was a sleek,\r\ncomfortable young man with smooth brown hair parted in the centre and\r\nconducted in a pair of flowing curves across the temples, to be looped\r\nin damp curls behind his ears. His face ought to have been rather more\r\nexquisite, rather more refinedly _dix-huiti\xc3\xa8me_ than it actually was. It\r\nhad a rather gross, snouty look, which was sadly out of harmony with Mr.\r\nMercaptan\xe2\x80\x99s inimitably graceful style. For Mr. Mercaptan had a style and\r\nused it, delightfully, in his middle articles for the literary weeklies.\r\nHis most precious work, however, was that little volume of essays, prose\r\npoems, vignettes and paradoxes, in which he had so brilliantly\r\nillustrated his favourite theme\xe2\x80\x94the pettiness, the simian limitations,\r\nthe insignificance and the absurd pretentiousness of _Homo_ soi-disant\r\n_Sapiens_. Those who met Mr. Mercaptan personally often came away with\r\nthe feeling that perhaps, after all, he was right in judging so severely\r\nof humanity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Too_ late in the day,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cTimes have changed. _Sunt lacrym\xc3\xa6\r\nrerum, nos et mutamur in illis._\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed his own applause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Quot homines, tot disputandum est_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, taking another sip\r\nof his Beaune Sup\xc3\xa9rieure. At the moment, he was all for Mercaptan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _why_ is it too late?\xe2\x80\x9d Lypiatt insisted.\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan made a delicate gesture. \xe2\x80\x9c_\xc3\x87a se sent, mon cher ami_,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9c_\xc3\xa7a ne s\xe2\x80\x99explique pas._\xe2\x80\x9d Satan, it is said, carries hell in his\r\nheart; so it was with Mr. Mercaptan\xe2\x80\x94wherever he was, it was Paris.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDreams in nineteen twenty-two....\xe2\x80\x9d He shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter you\xe2\x80\x99ve accepted the war, swallowed the Russian famine,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cDreams!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey belonged to the _Rostand_ epoch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mercaptan, with a\r\nlittle titter. \xe2\x80\x9c_Le R\xc3\xa8ve_\xe2\x80\x94ah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLypiatt dropped his knife and fork with a clatter and leaned forward,\r\neager for battle. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I have you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cnow I have you on the hip.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve given yourselves away. You\xe2\x80\x99ve given away the secret of your\r\nspiritual poverty, your weakness and pettiness and impotence....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpotence? You malign me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\nShearwater ponderously stirred. He had been silent all this time,\r\nsitting with hunched shoulders, his elbows on the table, his big round\r\nhead bent forward, absorbed, apparently, in the slow meticulous\r\ncrumbling of a piece of bread. Sometimes he put a piece of crust in his\r\nmouth and under the bushy brown moustache his jaw moved slowly,\r\nruminatively, with a sideways motion, like a cow\xe2\x80\x99s. He nudged Gumbril\r\nwith his elbow. \xe2\x80\x9cAss,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbe quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLypiatt went on torrentially. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of ideals, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it\r\nis. You daren\xe2\x80\x99t admit to having dreams. Oh, I call them dreams,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded parenthetically. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind being thought a fool and\r\nold-fashioned. The word\xe2\x80\x99s shorter and more English. Besides, it rhymes\r\nwith gleams. Ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d And Lypiatt laughed his loud Titan\xe2\x80\x99s laugh, the\r\nlaugh of cynicism which seems to belie, but which, for those who have\r\nunderstanding, reveals the high, positive spirit within. \xe2\x80\x9cIdeals\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nnot sufficiently genteel for you civilized young men. You\xe2\x80\x99ve quite\r\noutgrown that sort of thing. No dream, no religion, no morality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI glory in the name of earwig,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. He was pleased with that\r\nlittle invention. It was felicitous; it was well chosen. \xe2\x80\x9cOne\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\nearwig in sheer self-protection,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Mercaptan refused to accept the name of earwig at any price.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_What_ there is to be ashamed of in being civilized, I _really_ don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a voice that was now the bull\xe2\x80\x99s, now the piping\r\nrobin\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, if I glory in anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s in my little rococo boudoir,\r\nand the conversations across the polished mahogany, and the delicate,\r\nlascivious, _witty_ little flirtations on ample sofas inhabited by the\r\nsoul of Crebillon Fils. We needn\xe2\x80\x99t _all_ be Russians, I hope. These\r\nrevolting Dostoievskys.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mercaptan spoke with a profound feeling.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor all Utopians. Homo _au naturel_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mercaptan applied his thumb\r\nand forefinger to his, alas! too snout-like nose, \xe2\x80\x9c_\xc3\xa7a pue_. And as for\r\nHomo \xc3\xa0 la H. G. Wells\xe2\x80\x94_\xc3\xa7a ne pue pas assez_. What I glory in is the\r\ncivilized, middle way between stink and asepsis. Give me a little musk,\r\na little intoxicating feminine exhalation, the bouquet of old wine and\r\nstrawberries, a lavender bag under every pillow and pot-pourri in the\r\ncorners of the drawing-room. Readable books, amusing conversation,\r\ncivilized women, graceful art and dry vintage, music, with a quiet life\r\nand reasonable comfort\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s _all_ I ask for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalking about comfort,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril put in, before Lypiatt had time to\r\nfling his answering thunders, \xe2\x80\x9cI must tell you about my new invention.\r\nPneumatic trousers,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cBlow them up. Perfect comfort. You\r\nsee the idea? You\xe2\x80\x99re a sedentary man, Mercaptan. Let me put you down for\r\na couple of pairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cToo Wellsian,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cToo horribly\r\nUtopian. They\xe2\x80\x99d be ludicrously out of place in my boudoir. And besides,\r\nmy sofa is well enough sprung already, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what about Tolstoy?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Lypiatt, letting out his impatience in\r\na violent blast.\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan waved his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cRussian,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cRussian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Michelangelo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlberti,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, very seriously, giving them all a piece of his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s mind\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAlberti was much the better architect, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pretentiousness for pretentiousness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mercaptan, \xe2\x80\x9cI prefer\r\nold Borromini and the baroque.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about Beethoven?\xe2\x80\x9d went on Lypiatt. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about Blake? Where do\r\nthey come in under your scheme of things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan shrugged his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cThey stay in the hall,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t let them into the boudoir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou disgust me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lypiatt, with rising indignation, and making\r\nwider gestures. \xe2\x80\x9cYou disgust me\xe2\x80\x94you and your odious little sham\r\neighteenth-century civilization; your piddling little poetry; your art\r\nfor art\xe2\x80\x99s sake instead of for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake; your nauseating little\r\ncopulations without love or passion; your hoggish materialism; your\r\nbestial indifference to all that\xe2\x80\x99s unhappy and your yelping hatred of\r\nall that\xe2\x80\x99s great.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming, charming,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mr. Mercaptan, who was pouring oil on his\r\nsalad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you ever hope to achieve anything decent or solid, when you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t even believe in decency or solidity? I look about me,\xe2\x80\x9d and Lypiatt\r\ncast his eyes wildly round the crowded room, \xe2\x80\x9cand I find myself alone,\r\nspiritually alone. I strive on by myself, by myself.\xe2\x80\x9d He struck his\r\nbreast, a giant, a solitary giant. \xe2\x80\x9cI have set myself to restore\r\npainting and poetry to their rightful position among the great moral\r\nforces. They have been amusements, they have been mere games for too\r\nlong. I am giving my life for that. My life.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice trembled a\r\nlittle. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople mock me, hate me, stone me, deride me. But I go on, I go\r\non. For I know I\xe2\x80\x99m right. And in the end they too will recognize that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been right.\xe2\x80\x9d It was a loud soliloquy. One could fancy that Lypiatt\r\nhad been engaged in recognizing himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril with a cheerful stubbornness, \xe2\x80\x9cI persist\r\nthat the word \xe2\x80\x98dreams\xe2\x80\x99 is inadmissible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Inadmissible_,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Mercaptan, imparting to the word an\r\nadditional significance by giving it its French pronunciation. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the\r\nage of Rostand, well and good. But now....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, \xe2\x80\x9cthe word merely connotes Freud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of literary tact,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Mr. Mercaptan. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you no\r\nliterary tact?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lypiatt, with emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cthank God, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. I have no tact\r\nof any kind. I do things straightforwardly, frankly, as the spirit moves\r\nme. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like compromises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe struck the table. The gesture startlingly let loose a peal of cracked\r\nand diabolic laughter. Gumbril and Lypiatt and Mr. Mercaptan looked\r\nquickly up; even Shearwater lifted his great spherical head and turned\r\ntowards the sound the large disk of his face. A young man with a blond,\r\nfan-shaped beard stood by the table, looking down at them through a pair\r\nof bright blue eyes and smiling equivocally and disquietingly as though\r\nhis mind were full of some nameless and fantastic malice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Come sta la Sua Terribilt\xc3\xa0?_\xe2\x80\x9d he asked; and, taking off his\r\npreposterous bowler hat, he bowed profoundly to Lypiatt. \xe2\x80\x9cHow I\r\nrecognize my Buonarotti!\xe2\x80\x9d he added affectionately.\r\n\r\nLypiatt laughed, rather uncomfortably, and no longer on the Titanic\r\nscale. \xe2\x80\x9cHow I recognize my Coleman!\xe2\x80\x9d he echoed, rather feebly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril corrected, \xe2\x80\x9chow almost completely I fail to\r\nrecognize. This beard\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he pointed to the blond fan\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhy, may I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore Russianism,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mercaptan, and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, why indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman lowered his voice to a confidential whisper.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor religious reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and made the sign of the cross.\r\n\r\n                      \xe2\x80\x9cChristlike in my behaviour,\r\n                      Like every good believer,\r\n                      I imitate the Saviour,\r\n                      And cultivate a beaver.\r\n\r\nThere be beavers which have made themselves beavers for the kingdom of\r\nheaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake. But there are some beavers, on the other hand, which were\r\nso born from their mother\xe2\x80\x99s womb.\xe2\x80\x9d He burst into a fit of outrageous\r\nlaughter which stopped as suddenly and as voluntarily as it had begun.\r\n\r\nLypiatt shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cHideous,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chideous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoreover,\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman went on, without paying any attention, \xe2\x80\x9cI have other\r\nand, alas! less holy reasons for this change of face. It enables one to\r\nmake such delightful acquaintances in the street. You hear some one\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x98Beaver,\xe2\x80\x99 as you pass, and you immediately have the right to\r\nrush up and get into conversation. I owe to this dear symbol,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\ncaressed the golden beard tenderly with the palm of his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cthe most\r\nadmirably dangerous relations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagnificent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, drinking his own health. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall stop\r\nshaving at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShearwater looked round the table with raised eyebrows and a wrinkled\r\nforehead. \xe2\x80\x9cThis conversation is rather beyond me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gravely.\r\nUnder the formidable moustache, under the thick, tufted eyebrows, the\r\nmouth was small and ingenuous, the mild grey eyes full of an almost\r\nchildish inquiry. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does the word \xe2\x80\x98beaver\xe2\x80\x99 signify in this context?\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t refer, I suppose, to the rodent, _Castor fiber_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is a very great man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman, raising his bowler. \xe2\x80\x9cTell\r\nme who he is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur friend Shearwater,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, \xe2\x80\x9cthe physiologist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColeman bowed. \xe2\x80\x9cPhysiological Shearwater,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAccept my homage.\r\nTo one who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what a beaver is, I resign all my claims to\r\nsuperiority. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing else but beavers in all the papers. Tell\r\nme, do you never read the _Daily Express_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor the _Daily Mail_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShearwater shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor the _Mirror_? nor the _Sketch_? nor the _Graphic_? nor even (for I\r\nwas forgetting that physiologists must surely have Liberal\r\nopinions)\xe2\x80\x94even the _Daily News_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShearwater continued to shake his large spherical head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor any of the evening papers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColeman once more lifted his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cO eloquent, just and mighty Death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe exclaimed, and replaced it on his head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never read any papers at\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94not even our friend Mercaptan\xe2\x80\x99s delicious little middles in the\r\nweeklies? How is your delicious little middle, by the way?\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman\r\nturned to Mr. Mercaptan and with the point of his huge stick gave him a\r\nlittle prod in the stomach. \xe2\x80\x9c_\xc3\x87a marche\xe2\x80\x94les tripes_? Hein?\xe2\x80\x9d He turned\r\nback to Shearwater. \xe2\x80\x9cNot even those?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater. \xe2\x80\x9cI have more serious things to think about\r\nthan newspapers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what serious thing, may I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, at the present moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater, \xe2\x80\x9cI am chiefly\r\npreoccupied with the kidneys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe kidneys!\xe2\x80\x9d In an ecstasy of delight, Coleman thumped the floor with\r\nthe ferrule of his stick. \xe2\x80\x9cThe kidneys! Tell me all about kidneys. This\r\nis of the first importance. This is really life. And I shall sit down at\r\nyour table without asking permission of Buonarotti here, and in the\r\nteeth of Mercaptan, and without so much as thinking about this species\r\nof Gumbril, who might as well not be there at all. I shall sit down\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalking of sitting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could persuade you to\r\norder a pair of my patent pneumatic trousers. They will\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColeman waved him away. \xe2\x80\x9cNot now, not now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall sit down\r\nand listen to the physiologue talking about runions, while I myself\r\nactually eat them\xe2\x80\x94_saut\xc3\xa9s_. _Saut\xc3\xa9s_, mark my words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaying his hat and stick on the floor beside him, he sat down at the end\r\nof the table, between Lypiatt and Shearwater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo believers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, laying his hand for a moment on Lypiatt\xe2\x80\x99s arm,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand three black-hearted unbelievers\xe2\x80\x94confronted. Eh, Buonarotti? You and\r\nI are both _croyants et pratiquants_, as Mercaptan would say. I believe\r\nin one devil, father quasi-almighty, Samael and his wife, the Woman of\r\nWhoredom. Ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed his ferocious, artificial laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s an end to any civilized conversation,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mercaptan complained,\r\nhissing on the _c_, labiating lingeringly on the _v_ of \xe2\x80\x98civilized\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\ngiving the first two _i_\xe2\x80\x99s their fullest value. The word, in his mouth,\r\nseemed to take on a special and a richer significance.\r\n\r\nColeman ignored him. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me, you physiologue,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me\r\nabout the physiology of the Archetypal Man. This is most important;\r\nBuonarotti shares my opinion about this, I know. Has the Archetypal Man\r\na _boyau rectum_, as Mercaptan would say again, or not? Everything\r\ndepends on this, as Voltaire realized ages ago. \xe2\x80\x98His feet,\xe2\x80\x99 as we know\r\nalready on inspired authority, \xe2\x80\x98were straight feet; and the sole of his\r\nfeet were like the sole of a calf\xe2\x80\x99s foot.\xe2\x80\x99 But the viscera, you must\r\ntell us something about the viscera. Mustn\xe2\x80\x99t he, Buonarotti? And where\r\nare my _rognons saut\xc3\xa9s_?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted at the waiter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou revolt me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lypiatt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot mortually, I \xe2\x80\x99ope?\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman turned with solicitude to his\r\nneighbour; then shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cMortually I fear. Kiss me \xe2\x80\x99Ardy, and I\r\ndie happy.\xe2\x80\x9d He blew a kiss into the air. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why is the physiologue so\r\nslow? Up, pachyderm, up! Answer. You hold the key to everything. The\r\nkey, I tell you, the key. I remember, when I used to hang about the\r\nbiological laboratories at school, eviscerating frogs\xe2\x80\x94crucified with\r\npins, they were, belly upwards, like little green Christs\xe2\x80\x94I remember\r\nonce, when I was sitting there, quietly poring over the entrails, in\r\ncame the laboratory boy and said to the stinks usher: \xe2\x80\x98Please, sir, may\r\nI have the key of the Absolute?\xe2\x80\x99 And, would you believe it, that usher\r\ncalmly put his hand in his trouser pocket and fished out a small Yale\r\nkey and gave it him without a word. What a gesture! The key of the\r\nAbsolute. But it was only the absolute alcohol the urchin wanted\xe2\x80\x94to\r\npickle some loathsome f\xc5\x93tus in, I suppose. God rot his soul in peace!\r\nAnd now, Castor Fiber, out with your key. Tell us about the Archetypal\r\nMan, tell us about the primordial Adam. Tell us all about the _boyau\r\nrectum_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPonderously, Shearwater moved his clumsy frame; leaning back in his\r\nchair he scrutinized Coleman with a large, benevolent curiosity. The\r\neyes under the savage eyebrows were mild and gentle; behind the fearful\r\ndisguise of the moustache he smiled poutingly, like a baby who sees the\r\napproaching bottle. The broad, domed forehead was serene. He ran his\r\nhand through his thick brown hair, scratched his head meditatively and\r\nthen, when he had thoroughly examined, had comprehended and duly\r\nclassified the strange phenomenon of Coleman, opened his mouth and\r\nuttered a little good-natured laugh of amusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVoltaire\xe2\x80\x99s question,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, in his slow, deep voice, \xe2\x80\x9cseemed\r\nat the time he asked it an unanswerable piece of irony. It would have\r\nseemed almost equally ironic to his contemporaries, if he had asked\r\nwhether God had a pair of kidneys. We know a little more about the\r\nkidneys nowadays. If he had asked me, I should answer: why not? The\r\nkidneys are so beautifully organized; they do their work of regulation\r\nwith such a miraculous\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to find another word\xe2\x80\x94such a positively\r\ndivine precision, such knowledge and wisdom, that there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why\r\nyour archetypal man, whoever he is, or any one else, for that matter,\r\nshould be ashamed of owning a pair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColeman clapped his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cThe key,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthe key. Out of the\r\ntrouser pocket of babes and sucklings it comes. The genuine, the unique\r\nYale. How right I was to come here to-night! But, holy Sephiroth,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s my trollop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe picked up his stick, jumped from his chair and threaded his way\r\nbetween the tables. A woman was standing near the door. Coleman came up\r\nto her, pointed without speaking to the table, and returned, driving her\r\nalong in front of him, tapping her gently over the haunches with his\r\nstick, as one might drive a docile animal to the slaughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to introduce,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sharer of my joys and\r\nsorrows. _La compagne de mes nuits blanches et de mes jours plut\xc3\xb4t\r\nsales._ In a word, Zoe. _Qui ne comprend pas le fran\xc3\xa7ais, qui me d\xc3\xa9teste\r\navec une passion \xc3\xa9gale \xc3\xa0 la mienne, et qui mangera, ma foi, des rognons\r\npour faire honneur au physiologue._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave some Burgundy?\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril proffered the bottle.\r\n\r\nZoe nodded and pushed forward her glass. She was dark-haired, had a pale\r\nskin and eyes like round blackberries. Her mouth was small and floridly\r\ncurved. She was dressed, rather depressingly, like a picture by Augustus\r\nJohn, in blue and orange. Her expression was sullen and ferocious, and\r\nshe looked about her with an air of profound contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShearwater\xe2\x80\x99s no better than a mystic,\xe2\x80\x9d fluted Mr. Mercaptan. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nmystical scientist; really, one hadn\xe2\x80\x99t reckoned on that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike a Liberal Pope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Metternich, you remember? Pio\r\nNono.\xe2\x80\x9d And he burst into a fit of esoteric laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cOf less than\r\naverage intelligence,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured delightedly, and refilled his glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only the deliberately blind who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t reckon on the\r\ncombination,\xe2\x80\x9d Lypiatt put in, indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are science and art,\r\nwhat are religion and philosophy but so many expressions in human terms\r\nof some reality more than human? Newton and Boehme and Michelangelo\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nare they doing but expressing, in different ways, different aspects of\r\nthe same thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlberti, I beg you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cI assure you he was the better\r\narchitect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Fi donc!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mercaptan. \xe2\x80\x9cSan Carlo alle Quatro Fontane\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nhe got no further. Lypiatt abolished him with a gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne reality,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is only one reality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne reality,\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman reached out a hand across the table and caressed\r\nZoe\xe2\x80\x99s bare white arm, \xe2\x80\x9cand that is callipygous.\xe2\x80\x9d Zoe jabbed at his hand\r\nwith her fork.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all trying to talk about it,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Lypiatt. \xe2\x80\x9cThe physicists\r\nhave formulated their laws, which are after all no more than stammering\r\nprovisional theories about a part of it. The physiologists are\r\npenetrating into the secrets of life, psychologists into the mind. And\r\nwe artists are trying to say what is revealed to us about the moral\r\nnature, the personality of that reality, which is the universe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan threw up his hands in affected horror. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, _barbaridad,\r\nbarbaridad_!\xe2\x80\x9d Nothing less than the pure Castilian would relieve his\r\nfeelings. \xe2\x80\x9cBut all this is meaningless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right about the chemists and physicists,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re always trying to pretend that they\xe2\x80\x99re nearer the truth than we\r\nare. They take their crude theories as facts and try to make us accept\r\nthem when we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with life. Oh, they are sacred, their theories.\r\nLaws of Nature they call them; and they talk about their known truths\r\nand our romantic biological fancies. What a fuss they make when we talk\r\nabout life! Bloody fools!\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater, mild and crushing. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody\r\nbut a fool could talk of mechanism in face of the kidneys. And there are\r\nactually imbeciles who talk about the mechanism of heredity and\r\nreproduction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same,\xe2\x80\x9d began Mr. Mercaptan very earnestly, anxious to deny his\r\nown life, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are eminent authorities. I can only quote what they\r\nsay, of course. I can\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know anything about it myself. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReproduction, reproduction,\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman murmured the word to himself\r\necstatically. \xe2\x80\x9cDelightful and horrifying to think they all come to that,\r\neven the most virginal; that they were all made for that, little\r\nshe-dogs, in spite of their china blue eyes. What sort of a mandrake\r\nshall we produce, Zoe and I?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, turning to Shearwater. \xe2\x80\x9cHow I\r\nshould like to have a child,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on without waiting for an answer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t teach it anything; no language, nothing at all. Just a\r\nchild of nature. I believe it would really be the devil. And then what\r\nfun it would be if it suddenly started to say \xe2\x80\x98Bekkos,\xe2\x80\x99 like the\r\nchildren in Herodotus. And Buonarotti here would paint an allegorical\r\npicture of it and write an epic called \xe2\x80\x98The Ignoble Savage.\xe2\x80\x99 And Castor\r\nFiber would come and sound its kidneys and investigate its sexual\r\ninstincts. And Mercaptan would write one of his inimitable middle\r\narticles about it. And Gumbril would make it a pair of patent trousers.\r\nAnd Zoe and I would look parentally on and fairly swell with pride.\r\nShouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we, Zoe?\xe2\x80\x9d Zoe preserved her expression of sullen, unchanging\r\ncontempt and did not deign to answer. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, how delightful it would be! I\r\nlong for posterity. I live in hopes. I stope against Stopes. I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZoe threw a piece of bread, which caught him on the cheek, a little\r\nbelow the eye. Coleman leaned back and laughed and laughed till the\r\ntears rolled down his face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nOne after another, they engaged themselves in the revolving doors of the\r\nrestaurant, trotted round in the moving cage of glass and ejected\r\nthemselves into the coolness and darkness of the street. Shearwater\r\nlifted up his large face and took two or three deep breaths. \xe2\x80\x9cToo much\r\ncarbon dioxide and ammonia in there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is unfortunate that when two or three are gathered together in God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname, or even in the more civilized name of Mercaptan of the delicious\r\nmiddle,\xe2\x80\x9d Mercaptan dexterously parried the prod which Coleman aimed at\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cit is altogether deplorable that they should necessarily empest\r\nthe air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLypiatt had turned his eyes heavenwards. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat stars,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nwhat prodigious gaps between the stars!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA real light opera summer night.\xe2\x80\x9d And Mercaptan began to sing, in\r\nfragmentary German, the \xe2\x80\x98Barcarolle\xe2\x80\x99 from the _Tales of Hoffmann_.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiebe Nacht, du sch\xc3\xb6ne Nacht, oh stille mein tumpty-tum. Te, tum, Te\r\ntum.... Delicious Offenbach. Ah, if only we could have a third Empire!\r\nAnother comic Napoleon! That would make Paris look like Paris again.\r\nTiddy, tumpty-ti-tum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked along without any particular destination, but simply for the\r\nsake of walking through this soft cool night. Coleman led the way,\r\ntapping the pavement at every step with the ferrule of his stick. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nblind leading the blind,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, if only there were a ditch,\r\na crevasse, a great hole full of stinging centipedes and dung. How\r\ngleefully I should lead you all into it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you would do well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cto go and see a\r\ndoctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColeman gave vent to a howl of delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it occur to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat at this moment we are walking\r\nthrough the midst of seven million distinct and separate individuals,\r\neach with distinct and separate lives and all completely indifferent to\r\nour existence? Seven million people, each one of whom thinks himself\r\nquite as important as each of us does. Millions of them are now sleeping\r\nin an empested atmosphere. Hundreds of thousands of couples are at this\r\nmoment engaged in mutually caressing one another in a manner too hideous\r\nto be thought of, but in no way differing from the manner in which each\r\nof us performs, delightfully, passionately and beautifully, his similar\r\nwork of love. Thousands of women are now in the throes of parturition,\r\nand of both sexes thousands are dying of the most diverse and appalling\r\ndiseases, or simply because they have lived too long. Thousands are\r\ndrunk, thousands have over-eaten, thousands have not had enough to eat.\r\nAnd they are all alive, all unique and separate and sensitive, like you\r\nand me. It\xe2\x80\x99s a horrible thought. Ah, if I could lead them all into that\r\ngreat hole of centipedes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tapped and tapped on the pavement in front of him, as though\r\nsearching for the crevasse. At the top of his voice he began to chant:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO all ye Beasts and Cattle, curse ye the Lord: curse him and vilify him\r\nfor ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this religion,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mercaptan. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat with Lypiatt on one side,\r\nbeing a muscular Christian artist, and Coleman on the other, howling the\r\nblack mass.... Really!\xe2\x80\x9d He elaborated an Italianate gesture, and turned\r\nto Zoe. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of it all?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nZoe jerked her head in Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s direction. \xe2\x80\x9cI think e\xe2\x80\x99s a bloody\r\nswine,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. They were the first words she had spoken since she had\r\njoined the party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear, hear!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Coleman, and he waved his stick.\r\n\r\nIn the warm yellow light of the coffee-stall at Hyde Park Corner\r\nloitered a little group of people. Among the peaked caps and the\r\nchauffeurs\xe2\x80\x99 dust-coats, among the weather-stained workmen\xe2\x80\x99s jackets and\r\nthe knotted handkerchiefs, there emerged an alien elegance. A tall tubed\r\nhat and a silk-faced overcoat, a cloak of flame-coloured satin, and in\r\nbright, coppery hair a great Spanish comb of carved tortoiseshell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m damned,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril as they approached. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMyra Viveash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lypiatt, peering in his turn. He began suddenly to walk\r\nwith an affected swagger, kicking his heels at every step. Looking at\r\nhimself from outside, his divining eyes pierced through the veil of\r\ncynical _je-m\xe2\x80\x99en-fichisme_ to the bruised heart beneath. Besides, he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want any one to guess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Viveash is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman quickened his rapping along the pavement.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is the present incumbent?\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed at the top hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan it be Bruin Opps?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril dubiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpps!\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman yelled out the name. \xe2\x80\x9cOpps!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe top hat turned, revealing a shirt front, a long grey face, a glitter\r\nof circular glass over the left eye. \xe2\x80\x9cWho the devil are you?\xe2\x80\x9d The voice\r\nwas harsh and arrogantly offensive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am that I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have with me\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he pointed to\r\nShearwater, to Gumbril, to Zoe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca physiologue, a pedagogue and a\r\npriapagogue; for I leave out of account mere artists and journalists\r\nwhose titles do not end with the magic syllable. And finally,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nindicating himself, \xe2\x80\x9cplain Dog, which being interpreted kabbalistically\r\nbackwards, signifies God. All at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d He took off his hat and\r\nbowed.\r\n\r\nThe top hat turned back towards the Spanish comb. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is this horrible\r\ndrunk?\xe2\x80\x9d it inquired.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash did not answer him, but stepped forward to meet the\r\nnewcomers. In one hand she held a peeled, hard-boiled egg and a thick\r\nslice of bread and butter in the other, and between her sentences she\r\nbit at them alternately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColeman!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, and her voice, as she spoke, seemed always on\r\nthe point of expiring, as though each word were the last, utterly\r\nfaintly and breakingly from a death-bed\xe2\x80\x94the last, with all the profound\r\nand nameless significance of the ultimate word. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very long time\r\nsince I heard you raving last. And you, Theodore darling, why do I never\r\nsee you now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril shrugged his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nMyra laughed and took another bite at her bread and butter.... She laid\r\nthe back of her hand\xe2\x80\x94for she was still holding the butt end of her\r\nhard-boiled egg\xe2\x80\x94on Lypiatt\xe2\x80\x99s arm. The Titan, who had been looking at the\r\nsky, seemed to be surprised to find her standing there. \xe2\x80\x9cYou?\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nsmiling and wrinkling up his forehead interrogatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s to-morrow I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting for you, Casimir, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you remembered.\xe2\x80\x9d The veil parted for a moment. Poor Lypiatt! \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nhappy Mercaptan? Always happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGallantly Mercaptan kissed the back of the hand which held the egg. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmight be happier,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, rolling up at her from the snouty face a\r\npair of small brown eyes. \xe2\x80\x9c_Puis-je esp\xc3\xa9rer?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash laughed expiringly from her inward death-bed and turned on\r\nhim, without speaking, her pale unwavering glance. Her eyes had a\r\nformidable capacity for looking and expressing nothing; they were like\r\nthe pale blue eyes which peer out of the Siamese cat\xe2\x80\x99s black velvet\r\nmask.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBellissima,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mercaptan, flowering under their cool light.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash addressed herself to the company at large. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have had the\r\nmost appalling evening,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t we, Bruin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruin Opps said nothing, but only scowled. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t like these damned\r\nintruders. The skin of his contracted brows oozed over the rim of his\r\nmonocle, on to the shining glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it would be fun,\xe2\x80\x9d Myra went on, \xe2\x80\x9cto go to that place at\r\nHampton Court, where you have dinner on an island and dance....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there about islands,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Mercaptan, in a deliciously\r\nwhimsical parenthesis, \xe2\x80\x9cthat makes them so peculiarly voluptuous?\r\nCythera, Monkey Island, Capri. _Je me demande._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother charming middle.\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman pointed his stick menacingly; Mr.\r\nMercaptan stepped quickly out of range.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we took a cab,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand set out. And what a\r\ncab, my God! A cab with only one gear and that the lowest. A cab as old\r\nas the century, a museum specimen, a collector\xe2\x80\x99s piece.\xe2\x80\x9d They had been\r\nhours and hours on the way. And when they got there, the food they were\r\noffered to eat, the wine they were expected to drink! From her eternal\r\ndeath-bed Mrs. Viveash cried out in unaffected horror. Everything tasted\r\nas though it has been kept soaking for a week in the river before being\r\nserved up\xe2\x80\x94rather weedy, with that delicious typhoid flavour of Thames\r\nwater. There was Thames even in the champagne. They had not been able to\r\neat so much as a crust of bread. Hungry and thirsty, they had\r\nre-embarked in their antique taxi, and here, at last, they were, at the\r\nfirst outpost of civilization, eating for dear life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a terrible evening,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing which\r\nkept up my spirits was the spectacle of Bruin\xe2\x80\x99s bad temper. You\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\nidea, Bruin, what an incomparable comic you can be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBruin ignored the remark. With an expression of painfully repressed\r\ndisgust he was eating a hard-boiled egg. Myra\xe2\x80\x99s caprices were becoming\r\nmore and more impossible. That Hampton Court business had been bad\r\nenough; but when it came to eating in the street, in the middle of a lot\r\nof filthy workmen\xe2\x80\x94well, really, that was rather too much.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash looked about her. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I never to know who this mysterious\r\nperson is?\xe2\x80\x9d She pointed to Shearwater, who was standing a little apart\r\nfrom the group, his back leaning against the Park railings and staring\r\nthoughtfully at the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe physiologue,\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman explained, \xe2\x80\x9cand he has the key. The key, the\r\nkey!\xe2\x80\x9d He hammered the pavement with his stick.\r\n\r\nGumbril performed the introduction in more commonplace style.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to take much interest in us, Mr. Shearwater,\xe2\x80\x9d Myra\r\ncalled expiringly. Shearwater looked up; Mrs. Viveash regarded him\r\nintently through pale, unwavering eyes, smiling as she looked that\r\nqueer, downward-turning smile which gave to her face, through its mask\r\nof laughter, a peculiar expression of agony. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to take\r\nmuch interest in us,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\nShearwater shook his heavy head. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I? There\xe2\x80\x99s not time to be interested in everything. One can\r\nonly be interested in what\xe2\x80\x99s worth while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re not worth while?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to me personally,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Shearwater with candour. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great Wall\r\nof China, the political situation in Italy, the habits of Trematodes\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nthese are most interesting in themselves. But they aren\xe2\x80\x99t interesting to\r\nme; I don\xe2\x80\x99t permit them to be. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the leisure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you allow yourself to be interested in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we go?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruin impatiently; he had succeeded in swallowing\r\nthe last fragment of his hard-boiled egg. Mrs. Viveash did not answer,\r\ndid not even look at him.\r\n\r\nShearwater, who had hesitated before replying, was about to speak. But\r\nColeman answered for him. \xe2\x80\x9cBe respectful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a great man. He reads no papers, not even those in which our\r\nMercaptan so beautifully writes. He does not know what a beaver is. And\r\nhe lives for nothing but the kidneys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash smiled her smile of agony. \xe2\x80\x9cKidneys? But what a _memento\r\nmori_. There are other portions of the anatomy.\xe2\x80\x9d She threw back her\r\ncloak revealing an arm, a bare shoulder, a slant of pectoral muscle. She\r\nwas wearing a white dress that, leaving her back and shoulders bare,\r\ncame up, under either arm, to a point in front and was held there by a\r\ngolden thread about the neck. \xe2\x80\x9cFor example,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and twisted her\r\nhand several times over and over, making the slender arm turn at the\r\nelbow, as though to demonstrate the movement of the articulations and\r\nthe muscular play.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Memento vivere_,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mercaptan aptly commented. \xe2\x80\x9c_Vivamus, mea\r\nLesbia, atque amemus._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash dropped her arm and pulled the cloak back into place. She\r\nlooked at Shearwater, who had followed all her movements with\r\nconscientious attention, and who now nodded with an expression of\r\ninterrogation on his face, as though to ask: what next?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe all know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got beautiful arms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruin angrily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no need for you to make an exhibition of them in the street, at\r\nmidnight. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get out of this.\xe2\x80\x9d He laid his hand on her shoulder and\r\nmade as if to draw her away. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d better be going. Goodness knows\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s happening behind us.\xe2\x80\x9d He indicated with a little movement of the\r\nhead the loiterers round the coffee-stall. \xe2\x80\x9cSome disturbance among the\r\n_canaille_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash looked round. The cab-drivers and the other consumers of\r\nmidnight coffee had gathered in an interested circle, curious and\r\nsympathetic, round the figure of a woman who was sitting, like a limp\r\nbundle tied up in black cotton and mackintosh, on the stall-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhigh stool, leaning wearily against the wall of the booth. A man stood\r\nbeside her drinking tea out of a thick white cup. Every one was talking\r\nat once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMayn\xe2\x80\x99t the poor wretches talk?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Viveash, turning back to\r\nBruin. \xe2\x80\x9cI never knew any one who had the lower classes on the brain as\r\nmuch as you have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI loathe them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruin. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate every one poor, or ill, or old.\r\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t abide them; they make me positively sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Quelle \xc3\xa2me bien-n\xc3\xa9e_,\xe2\x80\x9d piped Mr. Mercaptan. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how well and frankly\r\nyou express what we all feel and lack the courage to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLypiatt gave vent to indignant laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember when I was a little boy,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruin went on, \xe2\x80\x9cmy old grandfather\r\nused to tell me stories about his childhood. He told me that when he was\r\nabout five or six, just before the passing of the Reform Bill of\r\n\xe2\x80\x99thirty-two, there was a song which all right-thinking people used to\r\nsing, with a chorus that went like this: \xe2\x80\x98Rot the People, blast the\r\nPeople, damn the Lower Classes.\xe2\x80\x99 I wish I knew the rest of the words and\r\nthe tune. It must have been a good song.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColeman was enraptured with the song. He shouldered his walking-stick\r\nand began marching round and round the nearest lamp-post chanting the\r\nwords to a stirring march tune. \xe2\x80\x9cRot the People, blast the People....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe marked the rhythm with heavy stamps of his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, if only they\xe2\x80\x99d invent servants with internal combustion engines,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Bruin, almost pathetically. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever well trained they are, they\r\nalways betray their humanity occasionally. And that is really\r\nintolerable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow tedious is a guilty conscience!\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril murmured the quotation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mr. Shearwater,\xe2\x80\x9d said Myra, bringing back the conversation to more\r\ncongenial themes, \xe2\x80\x9chasn\xe2\x80\x99t told us yet what he thinks of arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m occupied with the regulation of\r\nthe blood at the moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it true what he says, Theodore?\xe2\x80\x9d She appealed to Gumbril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s answer was rather dim and remote. He was\r\nstraining to hear the talk of Bruin\xe2\x80\x99s _canaille_, and Mrs. Viveash\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquestion seemed a little irrelevant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI used to do cartin\xe2\x80\x99 jobs,\xe2\x80\x9d the man with the teacup was saying. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Ad a\r\nvan and a nold pony of me own. And didn\xe2\x80\x99t do so badly neither. The only\r\ntrouble was me lifting furniture and \xe2\x80\x99eavy weights about the place.\r\nBecause I \xe2\x80\x99ad malaria out in India, in the war....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor even\xe2\x80\x94you compel me to violate the laws of modesty\xe2\x80\x94nor even,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nViveash went on, smiling painfully, speaking huskily, expiringly, \xe2\x80\x9cof\r\nlegs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA spring of blasphemy was touched in Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s brain. \xe2\x80\x9cNeither\r\ndelighteth He in any man\xe2\x80\x99s legs,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, and with an extravagant\r\nshow of affection he embraced Zoe, who caught hold of his hand and bit\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt comes back on you when you get tired like, malaria does.\xe2\x80\x9d The man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface was sallow and there was an air of peculiar listlessness and\r\nhopelessness about his misery. \xe2\x80\x9cIt comes back on you, and then you go\r\ndown with fever and you\xe2\x80\x99re as weak as a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShearwater shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor even of the heart?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash lifted her eyebrows. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, now the\r\ninevitable word has been pronounced, the real subject of every\r\nconversation has appeared on the scene. Love, Mr. Shearwater!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut as I says,\xe2\x80\x9d recapitulated the man with the teacup, \xe2\x80\x9cwe didn\xe2\x80\x99t do so\r\nbadly after all. We \xe2\x80\x99ad nothing to complain about. \xe2\x80\x99Ad we, Florrie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe black bundle made an affirmative movement with its upper extremity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s one of the subjects,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater, \xe2\x80\x9clike the Great Wall of\r\nChina and the habits of Trematodes, I don\xe2\x80\x99t allow myself to be\r\ninterested in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash laughed, breathed out a little \xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d of incredulity\r\nand astonishment, and asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo time,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cYou people of leisure have nothing else to do\r\nor think about. I\xe2\x80\x99m busy and so naturally less interested in the subject\r\nthan you; and I take care, what\xe2\x80\x99s more, to limit such interest as I\r\nhave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was goin\xe2\x80\x99 up Ludgate \xe2\x80\x99Ill one day with a vanload of stuff for a chap\r\nin Clerkenwell. I was leadin\xe2\x80\x99 Jerry up the \xe2\x80\x99ill\xe2\x80\x94Jerry\xe2\x80\x99s the name of our\r\nole pony....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can\xe2\x80\x99t have everything,\xe2\x80\x9d Shearwater was explaining, \xe2\x80\x9cnot all at the\r\nsame time, in any case. I\xe2\x80\x99ve arranged my life for work now. I\xe2\x80\x99m quietly\r\nmarried, I simmer away domestically.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Quelle horreur!_\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mercaptan. All the Louis Quinze Abb\xc3\xa9 in him\r\nwas shocked and revolted by the thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut love?\xe2\x80\x9d questioned Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cLove?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove!\xe2\x80\x9d Lypiatt echoed. He was looking up at the Milky Way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll of a sudden out jumps a copper at me. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Ow old is that \xe2\x80\x99orse?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99e\r\nsays. \xe2\x80\x98It ain\xe2\x80\x99t fit to drawr a load, it limps in all four feet,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99e\r\nsays. \xe2\x80\x98No, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 I says. \xe2\x80\x98None of your answerin\xe2\x80\x99 back,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99e says.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take it outer the shafts at once.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I know all about love already. I know precious little still about\r\nkidneys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my good Shearwater, how can you know all about love before you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nmade it with all women?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOff we goes, me and the cop and the \xe2\x80\x99orse, up in front of the police\r\ncourt magistrate....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr are you one of those imbeciles,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwho speak of\r\nwomen with a large W and pretend we\xe2\x80\x99re all the same? Poor Theodore here\r\nmight possibly think so in his feebler moments.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril smiled vaguely\r\nfrom a distance. He was following the man with the teacup into the\r\nmagistrate\xe2\x80\x99s stuffy court. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mercaptan certainly does, because all\r\nthe women who ever sat on his _dix-huiti\xc3\xa8me_ sofa certainly were exactly\r\nlike one another. And perhaps Casimir does too; all women look like his\r\nabsurd ideal. But you, Shearwater, you\xe2\x80\x99re intelligent. Surely you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve anything so stupid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShearwater shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cop, \xe2\x80\x99e gave evidence against me. \xe2\x80\x98Limping in all four feet,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99e\r\nsays. \xe2\x80\x98It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 I says, and the police court vet, \xe2\x80\x99e bore me out.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The \xe2\x80\x99orse \xe2\x80\x99as been very well treated,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99e says. \xe2\x80\x98But \xe2\x80\x99e\xe2\x80\x99s old, \xe2\x80\x99e\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery old.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I know \xe2\x80\x99e\xe2\x80\x99s old,\xe2\x80\x99 I says. \xe2\x80\x98But where am I goin\xe2\x80\x99 to find the\r\nprice for a young one?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_x_^2 \xe2\x80\x93 _y_^2,\xe2\x80\x9d Shearwater was saying, \xe2\x80\x9c= (_x_ + _y_)(_x_ \xe2\x80\x93 _y_). And\r\nthe equation holds good whatever the values of _x_ and _y_.... It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nsame with your love business, Mrs. Viveash. The relation is still\r\nfundamentally the same, whatever the value of the unknown personal\r\nquantities concerned. Little individual tics and peculiarities\xe2\x80\x94after\r\nall, what do they matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman. \xe2\x80\x9cTics, mere tics. Sheep ticks, horse ticks,\r\nbed bugs, tape worms, taint worms, guinea worms, liver flukes....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The \xe2\x80\x99orse must be destroyed,\xe2\x80\x9d says the beak. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99E\xe2\x80\x99s too old for work.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I\xe2\x80\x99m not,\xe2\x80\x99 I says. \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t get a old age pension at thirty-two, can\r\nI? \xe2\x80\x99Ow am I to earn my living if you take away what I earns my living\r\nby?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash smiled agonizingly. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a man who thinks personal\r\npeculiarities are trivial and unimportant,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not even\r\ninterested in people, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you can do,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99e says. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m only \xe2\x80\x99ere to administer\r\nthe law.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Seems a queer sort of law,\xe2\x80\x99 I says. \xe2\x80\x98What law is it?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShearwater scratched his head. Under his formidable black moustache he\r\nsmiled at last his ingenuous, childish smile. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\r\nsuppose I\xe2\x80\x99m not. It hadn\xe2\x80\x99t occurred to me, until you said it. But I\r\nsuppose I\xe2\x80\x99m not. No.\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed, quite delighted, it seemed, by this\r\ndiscovery about himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What law is it?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99e says. \xe2\x80\x98The Croolty to Animals law. That\xe2\x80\x99s what it\r\nis,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99e says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe smile of mockery and suffering appeared and faded. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of these\r\ndays,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may find them more absorbing than you do\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a job \xe2\x80\x99ere, and \xe2\x80\x99aving been workin\xe2\x80\x99 on my own, my own\r\nmaster like, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get unemployment pay. So when we \xe2\x80\x99eard of jobs at\r\nPortsmouth, we thought we\xe2\x80\x99d try to get one, even if it did mean walkin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile, I have my kidneys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Opeless,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99e says to me, \xe2\x80\x98quite \xe2\x80\x99opeless. More than two hundred come\r\nfor three vacancies.\xe2\x80\x99 So there was nothing for it but to walk back\r\nagain. Took us four days it did, this time. She was very bad on the way,\r\nvery bad. Being nearly six months gone. Our first it is. Things will be\r\n\xe2\x80\x99arder still, when it comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom the black bundle there issued a sound of quiet sobbing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, making a sudden irruption into the\r\nconversation. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is really too awful.\xe2\x80\x9d He was consumed with\r\nindignation and pity; he felt like a prophet in Nineveh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are two wretched people here,\xe2\x80\x9d and Gumbril told them\r\nbreathlessly, what he had overheard. It was terrible, terrible. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the\r\nway to Portsmouth and back again; on foot; without proper food; and the\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s with child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColeman exploded with delight. \xe2\x80\x9cGravid,\xe2\x80\x9d he kept repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cgravid,\r\ngravid. The laws of gravidy, first formulated by Newton, now recodified\r\nby the immortal Einstein. God said, Let Newstein be, and there was\r\nlight. And God said, Let there be Light; and there was darkness o\xe2\x80\x99er the\r\nface of the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d He roared with laughter.\r\n\r\nBetween them they raised five pounds. Mrs. Viveash undertook to give\r\nthem to the black bundle. The cabmen made way for her as she advanced;\r\nthere was an uncomfortable silence. The black bundle lifted a face that\r\nwas old and worn, like the face of a statue in the portal of a\r\ncathedral; an old face, but one was aware somehow, that it belonged to a\r\nwoman still young by the reckoning of years. Her hands trembled as she\r\ntook the notes, and when she opened her mouth to speak her hardly\r\narticulate whisper of gratitude, one saw that she had lost several of\r\nher teeth.\r\n\r\nThe party disintegrated. All went their ways: Mr. Mercaptan to his\r\nrococo boudoir, his sweet barocco bedroom in Sloane Street; Coleman and\r\nZoe towards goodness only knew what scenes of intimate life in Pimlico;\r\nLypiatt to his studio off the Tottenham Court Road, alone, silently\r\nbrooding and perhaps too consciously bowed with unhappiness. But the\r\nunhappiness, poor Titan! was real enough, for had he not seen Mrs.\r\nViveash and the insufferable, the stupid and loutish Opps driving off in\r\none taxi? \xe2\x80\x9cMust finish up with a little dancing,\xe2\x80\x9d Myra had huskily\r\nuttered from that death-bed on which her restless spirit for ever and\r\nwearily exerted itself. Obediently, Bruin had given an address and they\r\nhad driven off. But after the dancing? Oh, was it possible that that\r\nodious, bad-blooded young cad was her lover? And that she should like\r\nhim? It was no wonder that Lypiatt should have walked, bent like Atlas\r\nunder the weight of a world. And when, in Piccadilly, a belated and\r\nstill unsuccessful prostitute sidled out of the darkness, as he strode\r\nby unseeing in his misery when she squeaked up at him a despairing\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheer up, duckie,\xe2\x80\x9d Lypiatt suddenly threw up his head and laughed\r\ntitanically, with the terrible bitterness of a noble soul in pain. Even\r\nthe poor drabs at the street corners were affected by the unhappiness\r\nthat radiated out from him, wave after throbbing wave, like music, he\r\nliked to fancy, into the night. Even the wretched drabs. He walked on,\r\nmore desperately bowed than ever; but met no further adventure on his\r\nway.\r\n\r\nGumbril and Shearwater both lived in Paddington; they set off in company\r\nup Park Lane, walking in silence. Gumbril gave a little skip to get\r\nhimself into step with his companion. To be out of step, when steps so\r\nloudly and flat-footedly flapped on empty pavements, was disagreeable,\r\nhe found, was embarrassing, was somehow dangerous. Stepping, like this,\r\nout of time, one gave oneself away, so to speak, one made the night\r\naware of two presences, when there might, if steps sounded in unison, be\r\nonly one, heavier, more formidable, more secure than either of the\r\nseparate two. In unison, then, they flapped up Park Lane. A policeman\r\nand the three poets, sulking back to back on their fountain, were the\r\nonly human things besides themselves under the mauve electric moons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s appalling, it\xe2\x80\x99s horrible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril at last, after a long,\r\nlong silence, during which he had, indeed, been relishing to the full\r\nthe horror of it all. Life, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s appalling?\xe2\x80\x9d Shearwater inquired. He walked with his big head\r\nbowed, his hands clasped behind his back and clutching his hat; walked\r\nclumsily, with sudden lurches of his whole massive anatomy. Wherever he\r\nwas, Shearwater always seemed to take up the space that two or three\r\nordinary people would normally occupy. Cool fingers of wind passed\r\nrefreshingly through his hair. He was thinking of the experiment he\r\nmeant to try, in the next few days, down at the physiological\r\nlaboratory. You\xe2\x80\x99d put a man on an ergometer in a heated chamber and set\r\nhim to work\xe2\x80\x94hours at a time. He\xe2\x80\x99d sweat, of course, prodigiously. You\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nmake arrangements for collecting the sweat, weighing it, analysing it\r\nand so on. The interesting thing would be to see what happened at the\r\nend of a few days. The man would have got rid of so much of his salts,\r\nthat the blood composition might be altered and all sorts of delightful\r\nconsequences might follow. It ought to be a capital experiment.\r\nGumbril\xe2\x80\x99s exclamation disturbed him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s appalling?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked rather\r\nirritably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose people at the coffee-stall,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s appalling\r\nthat human beings should have to live like that. Worse than dogs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDogs have nothing to complain of.\xe2\x80\x9d Shearwater went off at a tangent.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor guinea-pigs, nor rats. It\xe2\x80\x99s these blasted anti-vivisection maniacs\r\nwho make all the fuss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut think,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Gumbril, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat these wretched people have had to\r\nsuffer! Walking all the way to Portsmouth in search of work; and the\r\nwoman with child. It\xe2\x80\x99s horrifying. And then, the way people of that\r\nclass are habitually treated. One has no idea of it until one has\r\nactually been treated that way oneself. In the war, for example, when\r\none went to have one\xe2\x80\x99s mitral murmurs listened to by the medical\r\nboard\xe2\x80\x94they treated one then as though one belonged to the lower orders,\r\nlike all the rest of the poor wretches. It was a real eye-opener. One\r\nfelt like a cow being got into a train. And to think that the majority\r\nof one\xe2\x80\x99s fellow-beings pass their whole lives being shoved about like\r\nmaltreated animals!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater. If you went on sweating indefinitely, he\r\nsupposed, you would end by dying.\r\n\r\nGumbril looked through the railings at the profound darkness of the\r\npark. Vast it was and melancholy, with a string, here and there, of\r\nreceding lights. \xe2\x80\x9cTerrible,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and repeated the word several\r\ntimes. \xe2\x80\x9cTerrible, terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d All the legless soldiers grinding\r\nbarrel-organs, all the hawkers of toys stamping their leaky boots in the\r\ngutters of the Strand; at the corner of Cursitor Street and Chancery\r\nLane, the old woman with matches, for ever holding to her left eye a\r\nhandkerchief as yellow and dirty as the winter fog. What was wrong with\r\nthe eye? He had never dared to look, but hurried past as though she were\r\nnot there, or sometimes, when the fog was more than ordinarily cold and\r\nstifling, paused for an instant with averted eyes to drop a brown coin\r\ninto her tray of matches. And then there were the murderers hanged at\r\neight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, while one was savouring, almost with voluptuous\r\nconsciousness, the final dream-haunted doze. There was the phthisical\r\ncharwoman who used to work at his father\xe2\x80\x99s house, until she got too weak\r\nand died. There were the lovers who turned on the gas and the ruined\r\nshopkeepers jumping in front of trains. Had one a right to be contented\r\nand well-fed, had one a right to one\xe2\x80\x99s education and good taste, a right\r\nto knowledge and conversation and the leisurely complexities of love?\r\n\r\nHe looked once more through the railings at the park\xe2\x80\x99s impenetrable,\r\nrustic night, at the lines of beaded lamps. He looked, and remembered\r\nanother night, years ago, during the war, when there were no lights in\r\nthe park and the electric moons above the roadway were in almost total\r\neclipse. He had walked up this street alone, full of melancholy emotions\r\nwhich, though the cause of them was different, were in themselves much\r\nthe same as the melancholy emotions which swelled windily up within him\r\nto-night. He had been most horribly in love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you think,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cof Myra Viveash?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink?\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I thought very much about\r\nher. Not a case for ratiocination exactly, is she? She seemed to me\r\nentertaining enough, as women go. I said I\xe2\x80\x99d lunch with her on\r\nThursday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril felt, all of a sudden, the need to speak confidentially. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nwas a time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a tone that was quite unreally airy, off-hand\r\nand disengaged, \xe2\x80\x9cyears ago, when I totally lost my head about her.\r\nTotally.\xe2\x80\x9d Those tear-wet patches on his pillow, cold against his cheek\r\nin the darkness; and oh, the horrible pain of weeping, vainly, for\r\nsomething that was nothing, that was everything in the world! \xe2\x80\x9cTowards\r\nthe end of the war it was. I remember walking up this dismal street one\r\nnight, in the pitch darkness, writhing with jealousy.\xe2\x80\x9d He was silent.\r\nSpectrally, like a dim, haunting ghost, he had hung about her; dumbly,\r\ndumbly imploring, appealing. \xe2\x80\x9cThe weak, silent man,\xe2\x80\x9d she used to call\r\nhim. And once for two or three days, out of pity, out of affection, out\r\nof a mere desire, perhaps, to lay the tiresome ghost, she had given him\r\nwhat his mournful silence implored\xe2\x80\x94only to take it back, almost as soon\r\nas accorded. That other night, when he had walked up this street before,\r\ndesire had eaten out his vitals and his body seemed empty, sickeningly\r\nand achingly void; jealousy was busily reminding him, with an unflagging\r\nmalice, of her beauty\xe2\x80\x94of her beauty and the hateful, ruffian hands which\r\nnow caressed, the eyes which looked on it. That was all long ago.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is certainly handsome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater, commenting, at one or two\r\nremoves, on Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s last remark. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see that she might make any\r\none who got involved in her decidedly uncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d After a day or\r\ntwo\xe2\x80\x99s continuous sweating, it suddenly occurred to him, one might\r\nperhaps find sea-water more refreshing than fresh water. That would be\r\nqueer.\r\n\r\nGumbril burst out ferociously laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there were other times,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on jauntily, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen other people were jealous of me.\xe2\x80\x9d Ah, revenge,\r\nrevenge. In the better world of the imagination it was possible to get\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s own back. What fiendish vendettas were there carried to successful\r\nends! \xe2\x80\x9cI remember once writing her a quatrain in French.\xe2\x80\x9d (He had\r\nwritten it years after the whole thing was over, he had never sent it to\r\nany one at all; but that was all one.) \xe2\x80\x9cHow did it go? Ah, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nrecited, with suitable gestures:\r\n\r\n                  \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Puisque nous sommes l\xc3\xa0, je dois,\r\n                    Vous avertir, sans trop de honte,\r\n                  Que je n\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9gale pas le Comte\r\n                    Casanovesque de Sixfois.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRather prettily turned, I flatter myself. Rather elegantly gross.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril\xe2\x80\x99s laughter went hooting past the Marble Arch. It stopped rather\r\nsuddenly, however, at the corner of the Edgware Road. He had suddenly\r\nremembered Mr. Mercaptan, and the thought depressed him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was between Whitefield Street and the Tottenham Court Road, in a\r\n\xe2\x80\x98heavenly Mews,\xe2\x80\x99 as he liked to call it (for he had a characteristic\r\nweakness for philosophical paronomasia), that Casimir Lypiatt lived and\r\nworked. You passed under an archway of bald and sooty brick\xe2\x80\x94and at\r\nnight, when the green gas-lamp underneath the arch threw livid lights\r\nand enormous architectural shadows, you could fancy yourself at the\r\nentrance of one of Piranesi\xe2\x80\x99s prisons\xe2\x80\x94and you found yourself in a long\r\ncul-de-sac, flanked on either side by low buildings, having stabling for\r\nhorses below and, less commodiously, stabling for human beings in the\r\nattics above. An old-fashioned smell of animals mingled with the more\r\nprogressive stink of burnt oil. The air was a little thicker here, it\r\nseemed, than in the streets outside; looking down the mews on even the\r\nclearest day, you could see the forms of things dimming and softening,\r\nthe colours growing richer and deeper with every yard of distance. It\r\nwas the best place in the world, Lypiatt used to say, for studying\r\naerial perspective; that was why he lived there. But you always felt\r\nabout poor Lypiatt that he was facing misfortune with a jest a little\r\ntoo self-consciously.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash\xe2\x80\x99s taxi drove in under the Piranesian arch, drove in slowly\r\nand as though with a gingerly reluctance to soil its white wheels on\r\npavements so sordid. The cabman looked round inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis right?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nWith a white-gloved finger Mrs. Viveash prodded the air two or three\r\ntimes, indicating that he was to drive straight on. Half-way down the\r\nmews she rapped the glass; the man drew up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever been down _\xe2\x80\x99ere_ before,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, for the sake of making a\r\nlittle conversation, while Mrs. Viveash fumbled for her money. He looked\r\nat her with a polite and slightly ironic curiosity that was frankly\r\nmingled with admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re lucky,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cWe poor decayed gentlewomen\xe2\x80\x94you see\r\nwhat we\xe2\x80\x99re reduced to.\xe2\x80\x9d And she handed him a florin.\r\n\r\nSlowly the taxi-man unbuttoned his coat and put the coin away in an\r\ninner pocket. He watched her as she crossed the dirty street, placing\r\nher feet with a meticulous precision one after the other in the same\r\nstraight line, as though she were treading a knife edge between goodness\r\nonly knew what invisible gulfs. Floating she seemed to go, with a little\r\nspring at every step and the skirt of her summery dress\xe2\x80\x94white it was,\r\nwith a florid pattern printed in black all over it\xe2\x80\x94blowing airily out\r\naround her swaying march. Decayed gentlewomen indeed! The driver started\r\nhis machine with an unnecessary violence; he felt, for some reason,\r\npositively indignant.\r\n\r\nBetween the broad double-doors through which the horses passed to their\r\nfodder and repose were little narrow human doors\xe2\x80\x94for the Yahoos, Lypiatt\r\nused to say in his large allusive way; and when he said it he laughed\r\nwith the loud and bell-mouthed cynicism of one who sees himself as a\r\nmisunderstood and embittered Prometheus. At one of these little Yahoo\r\ndoors Mrs. Viveash halted and rapped as loudly as a small and\r\nstiff-hinged knocker would permit. Patiently she waited; several small\r\nand dirty children collected to stare at her. She knocked again and\r\nagain waited. More children came running up from the farther end of the\r\nmews; two young girls of fifteen or sixteen appeared at a neighbouring\r\ndoorway and immediately gave tongue in whoops of mirthless, hyena-like\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever read about the pied piper of Hamelin?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash asked\r\nthe nearest child. Terrified, it shrank away. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought not,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nand knocked again.\r\n\r\nThere was a sound, at last, of heavy feet slowly descending steep\r\nstairs; the door opened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome to the palazzo!\xe2\x80\x9d It was Lypiatt\xe2\x80\x99s heroic formula of\r\nhospitality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome at last,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash corrected, and followed him up a narrow,\r\ndark staircase that was as steep as a ladder. He was dressed in a\r\nvelveteen jacket and linen trousers that should have been white, but\r\nneeded washing. He was dishevelled and his hands were dirty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you knock more than once?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, looking back over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than twenty times,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash justifiably exaggerated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m infinitely sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Lypiatt. \xe2\x80\x9cI get so deeply absorbed in\r\nmy work, you know. Did you wait long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe children enjoyed it, at any rate.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash was irritated by a\r\nsuspicion, which was probably, after all, quite unjustified, that\r\nCasimir had been rather consciously absorbed in his work; that he had\r\nheard her first knock and plunged the more profoundly into those depths\r\nof absorption where the true artist always dwells, or at any rate ought\r\nto dwell; to rise at her third appeal with a slow, pained reluctance,\r\ncursing, perhaps, at the importunity of a world which thus noisily\r\ninterrupted the flow of his inspiration. \xe2\x80\x9cQueer, the way they stare at\r\none,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, with a note in her dying voice of a petulance that\r\nthe children had not inspired. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes one look such a guy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLypiatt threw open the door at the head of the stairs and stood there on\r\nthe threshold, waiting for her. \xe2\x80\x9cQueer?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nas she moved past him into the room, he laid his hand on her shoulder\r\nand fell into step with her, leaving the door to slam behind them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerely an example of the mob\xe2\x80\x99s instinctive dislike of the aristocratic\r\nindividual. That\xe2\x80\x99s all. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, why was I born with a different face?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThank God I was, though. And so were you. But the difference has its\r\ndisadvantages; the children throw stones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t throw stones.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash was too truthful, this time.\r\n\r\nThey halted in the middle of the studio. It was not a very large room\r\nand there were too many things in it. The easel stood near the centre of\r\nthe studio; round it Lypiatt kept a space permanently cleared. There was\r\na broad fairway leading to the door, and another, narrower and\r\ntortuously winding between boxes and piled-up furniture and tumbled\r\nbooks, gave access to his bed. There was a piano and a table permanently\r\nset with dirty plates and strewed with the relics of two or three meals.\r\nBookshelves stood on either side of the fireplace and lying on the floor\r\nwere still more books, piles on dusty piles. Mrs. Viveash stood looking\r\nat the picture on the easel (abstract again\xe2\x80\x94she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it), and\r\nLypiatt, who had dropped his hand from her shoulder, had stepped back\r\nthe better to see her, stood earnestly looking at Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I kiss you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked after a silence.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash turned towards him, smiling agonizingly, her eyebrows\r\nironically lifted, her eyes steady and calm and palely, brightly\r\ninexpressive. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it really gives you any pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t, I may say, to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou make me suffer a great deal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lypiatt, and said it so quietly\r\nand unaffectedly, that Myra was almost startled; she was accustomed,\r\nwith Casimir, to noisier and more magniloquent protestations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; and, really, she felt sorry. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp it, can I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated and his voice\r\nhad now become the voice of Prometheus in his bitterness. \xe2\x80\x9cNor can\r\ntigresses.\xe2\x80\x9d He had begun to pace up and down the unobstructed fairway\r\nbetween his easel and the door; Lypiatt liked pacing while he talked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou like playing with the victim,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on; \xe2\x80\x9che must die slowly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReassured, Mrs. Viveash faintly smiled. This was the familiar Casimir.\r\nSo long as he could talk like this, could talk like an old-fashioned\r\nFrench novel, it was all right; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really be so very unhappy.\r\nShe sat down on the nearest unencumbered chair. Lypiatt continued to\r\nwalk back and forth, waving his arms as he walked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s good for one to suffer,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunavoidable and necessary. Perhaps I ought to thank you. Can an artist\r\ndo anything if he\xe2\x80\x99s happy? Would he ever want to do anything? What is\r\nart, after all, but a protest against the horrible inclemency of life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe halted in front of her, with arms extended in a questioning gesture.\r\nMrs. Viveash slightly shrugged her shoulders. She really didn\xe2\x80\x99t know;\r\nshe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, but that\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out again,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9call rot. I want to be happy and contented and successful; and of course\r\nI should work better if I were. And I want, oh, above everything,\r\neverything, I want you: to possess you completely and exclusively and\r\njealously and for ever. And the desire is like rust corroding my heart,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s like moth eating holes in the fabric of my mind. And you merely\r\nlaugh.\xe2\x80\x9d He threw up his hands and let them limply fall again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t laugh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. On the contrary, she was very\r\nsorry for him; and, what was more, he rather bored her. For a few days,\r\nonce, she had thought she might be in love with him. His impetuosity had\r\nseemed a torrent strong enough to carry her away. She had found out her\r\nmistake very soon. After that he had rather amused her: and now he\r\nrather bored her. No, decidedly, she never laughed. She wondered why she\r\nstill went on seeing him. Simply because one must see some one? or why?\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to go on with my portrait?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nLypiatt sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I\xe2\x80\x99d better be getting on with\r\nmy work. Work\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing. \xe2\x80\x98Portrait of a Tigress.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d The cynical\r\nTitan spoke again. \xe2\x80\x9cOr shall I call it, \xe2\x80\x98Portrait of a Woman who has\r\nnever been in Love?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be a very stupid title,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr, \xe2\x80\x98Portrait of the Artist\xe2\x80\x99s Heart Disease\xe2\x80\x99? That would be good, that\r\nwould be damned good!\xe2\x80\x9d Lypiatt laughed very loudly and slapped his\r\nthighs. He looked, Mrs. Viveash thought, peculiarly ugly when he\r\nlaughed. His face seemed to go all to pieces; not a corner of it but was\r\nwrinkled and distorted by the violent grimace of mirth. Even the\r\nforehead was ruined when he laughed. Foreheads are generally the human\r\npart of people\xe2\x80\x99s faces. Let the nose twitch and the mouth grin and the\r\neyes twinkle as monkeyishly as you like; the forehead can still be calm\r\nand serene, the forehead still knows how to be human. But when Casimir\r\nlaughed, his forehead joined in the general disintegrating grimace. And\r\nsometimes even when he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t laughing, when he was just vivaciously\r\ntalking, his forehead seemed to lose its calm and would twitch and\r\nwrinkle itself in a dreadful kind of agitation. \xe2\x80\x98Portrait of the\r\nArtist\xe2\x80\x99s Heart Disease\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94she didn\xe2\x80\x99t find it so very funny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe critics would think it was a problem picture,\xe2\x80\x9d Lypiatt went on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so it would be, by God, so it would be. You _are_ a problem. You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nthe Sphinx. I wish I were \xc5\x92dipus and could kill you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this mythology! Mrs. Viveash shook her head.\r\n\r\nHe made his way through the intervening litter and picked up a canvas\r\nthat was leaning with averted face against the wall near the window. He\r\nheld it out at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length and examined it, his head critically cocked\r\non one side. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s good,\xe2\x80\x9d he said softly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good. Look at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd, stepping out once more into the open, he propped it up against the\r\ntable so that Mrs. Viveash could see it without moving from her chair.\r\n\r\nIt was a stormy vision of her; it was Myra seen, so to speak, through a\r\ntornado. He had distorted her in the portrait, had made her longer and\r\nthinner than she really was, had turned her arms into sleek tubes and\r\nput a bright, metallic polish on the curve of her cheek. The figure in\r\nthe portrait seemed to be leaning backwards a little from the surface of\r\nthe canvas, leaning sideways too, with the twist of an ivory statuette\r\ncarved out of the curving tip of a great tusk. Only somehow in Lypiatt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nportrait the curve seemed to lack grace, it was without point, it had no\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve made me look,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash at last, \xe2\x80\x9cas though I were\r\nbeing blown out of shape by the wind.\xe2\x80\x9d All this show of violence\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nwas the point of it? She didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it at all. But\r\nCasimir was delighted with her comment. He slapped his thighs and once\r\nmore laughed his restless, sharp-featured face to pieces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, by God,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cby God, that\xe2\x80\x99s right! Blown out of shape by\r\nthe wind. That\xe2\x80\x99s it: you\xe2\x80\x99ve said it.\xe2\x80\x9d He began stamping up and down the\r\nroom again, gesticulating. \xe2\x80\x9cThe wind, the great wind that\xe2\x80\x99s in me.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nstruck his forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cThe wind of life, the wild west wind. I feel it\r\ninside me, blowing, blowing. It carries me along with it; for though\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s inside me, it\xe2\x80\x99s more than I am, it\xe2\x80\x99s a force that comes from\r\nsomewhere else, it\xe2\x80\x99s Life itself, it\xe2\x80\x99s God. It blows me along in the\r\nteeth of opposing fate, it makes me work on, fight on.\xe2\x80\x9d He was like a\r\nman who walks along a sinister road at night and sings to keep up his\r\nown spirits, to emphasize and magnify his own existence. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when I\r\npaint, when I write or improvise my music, it bends the things I have in\r\nmy mind, it pushes them in one direction, so that everything I do has\r\nthe look of a tree that streams north-east with all its branches and all\r\nits trunk from the root upwards, as though it were trying to run from\r\nbefore the Atlantic gale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLypiatt stretched out his two hands and, with fingers splayed out to the\r\nwidest and trembling in the excessive tension of the muscles, moved them\r\nslowly upwards and sideways, as though he were running his palms up the\r\nstem of a little wind-wizened tree on a hilltop above the ocean.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash continued to look at the unfinished portrait. It was as\r\nnoisy and easy and immediately effective as a Vermouth advertisement in\r\nthe streets of Padua. Cinzano, Bonomelli, Campari\xe2\x80\x94illustrious names.\r\nGiotto and Mantegna mouldered meanwhile in their respective chapels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd look at this,\xe2\x80\x9d Lypiatt went on. He took down the canvas that was\r\nclamped to the easel and held it out for her inspection. It was one of\r\nCasimir\xe2\x80\x99s abstract paintings: a procession of machine-like forms rushing\r\nup diagonally from right to left across the canvas, with as it were a\r\nspray of energy blowing back from the crest of the wave towards the top\r\nright-hand corner. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this painting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI symbolize the\r\nArtist\xe2\x80\x99s conquering spirit\xe2\x80\x94rushing on the universe, making it its own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe began to declaim:\r\n\r\n            \xe2\x80\x9cLook down, Conquistador,\r\n            There on the valley\xe2\x80\x99s broad green floor,\r\n            There lies the lake, the jewelled cities gleam,\r\n            Chalco and Tlacopan\r\n            Awaiting the coming Man;\r\n            Look down on Mexico, Conquistador,\r\n            Land of your golden dream.\r\n\r\nOr the same idea in terms of music\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and Lypiatt dashed to the piano\r\nand evoked a distorted ghost of Scriabin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nfeverishly, when the ghost was laid again and the sad cheap jangling had\r\nfaded again into silence. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _feel_? The artist rushes on the world,\r\nconquers it, gives it beauty, imposes a moral significance.\xe2\x80\x9d He returned\r\nto the picture. \xe2\x80\x9cThis will be fine when it\xe2\x80\x99s finished,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTremendous. You feel the wind blowing there, too.\xe2\x80\x9d And with a pointing\r\nfinger he followed up the onrush of the forms. \xe2\x80\x9cThe great southwester\r\ndriving them on. \xe2\x80\x98Like leaves from an enchanter fleeing.\xe2\x80\x99 Only not\r\nchaotically, not in disorder. They\xe2\x80\x99re blown, so to speak, in column of\r\nfour\xe2\x80\x94by a conscious wind.\xe2\x80\x9d He leaned the canvas against the table and\r\nwas free again to march and brandish his conquering fists.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLife,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9clife\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the great, essential thing. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nget life into your art, otherwise it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing. And life only comes out\r\nof life, out of passion and feeling; it can\xe2\x80\x99t come out of theories.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the stupidity of all this chatter about art for art\xe2\x80\x99s sake and\r\nthe \xc3\xa6sthetic emotions and purely formal values and all that. It\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nthe formal relations that matter; one subject is just as good as\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the theory. You\xe2\x80\x99ve only got to look at the pictures of\r\nthe people who put it into practice to see that it won\xe2\x80\x99t do. Life comes\r\nout of life. You must paint with passion and the passion will stimulate\r\nyour intellect to create the right formal relations. And to paint with\r\npassion, you must paint things that passionately interest you, moving\r\nthings, human things. Nobody, except a mystical pantheist, like Van\r\nGogh, can seriously be as much interested in napkins, apples and bottles\r\nas in his lover\xe2\x80\x99s face, or the resurrection, or the destiny of man.\r\nCould Mantegna have devised his splendid compositions if he had painted\r\narrangements of Chianti flasks and cheeses instead of Crucifixions,\r\nmartyrs and triumphs of great men? Nobody but a fool could believe it.\r\nAnd could I have painted that portrait if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t loved you, if you\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t killing me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh, Bonomelli and illustrious Cinzano!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPassionately I paint passion. I draw life out of life. And I wish them\r\njoy of their bottles and their Canadian apples and their muddy table\r\nnapkins with the beastly folds in them that look like loops of tripe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nOnce more Lypiatt disintegrated himself with laughter; then was silent.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash nodded, slowly and reflectively. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x99re right,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said. Yes, he was surely right; there must be life, life was the\r\nimportant thing. That was precisely why his paintings were so bad\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nsaw now; there was no life in them. Plenty of noise there was, and\r\ngesticulation and a violent galvanized twitching; but no life, only the\r\ntheatrical show of it. There was a flaw in the conduit; somewhere\r\nbetween the man and his work life leaked out. He protested too much. But\r\nit was no good; there was no disguising the deadness. Her portrait was a\r\ndancing mummy. He bored her now. Did she even positively dislike him?\r\nBehind her unchanging pale eyes Mrs. Viveash wondered. But in any case,\r\nshe reflected, one needn\xe2\x80\x99t always like the people with whom one\r\nassociates. There are music halls as well as confidential boudoirs; some\r\npeople are admitted to the tea-party and the _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_, others, on a\r\nstage invisible, poor things! to themselves, do their little\r\nsong-and-dance, roll out their characteristic patter, and having\r\nprovided you with your entertainment are dismissed with their due share\r\nof applause. But then, what if they become boring?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lypiatt at last\xe2\x80\x94he had stood there, motionless, for a long\r\ntime, biting his nails, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we\xe2\x80\x99d better begin our sitting.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\npicked up the unfinished portrait and adjusted it on the easel. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nwasted a lot of time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand there isn\xe2\x80\x99t, after all, so much of\r\nit to waste.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke gloomily, and his whole person had become, all of\r\na sudden, curiously shrunken and deflated. \xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t so much of it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe repeated, and sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cI still think of myself as a young man, young\r\nand promising, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know. Casimir Lypiatt\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a young, promising\r\nsort of name, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? But I\xe2\x80\x99m not young, I\xe2\x80\x99ve passed the age of\r\npromise. Every now and then I realize it, and it\xe2\x80\x99s painful, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndepressing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash stepped up on to the model\xe2\x80\x99s dais and took her seat. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nthat right?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nLypiatt looked first at her, then at his picture. Her beauty, his\r\npassion\xe2\x80\x94were they only to meet on the canvas? Opps was her lover. Time\r\nwas passing; he felt tired. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said and began painting.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow young are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked after a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-five, I should imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-five? Good Lord, it\xe2\x80\x99s nearly fifteen years since I was\r\ntwenty-five. Fifteen years, fighting all the time. God, how I hate\r\npeople sometimes! Everybody. It\xe2\x80\x99s not their malignity I mind; I can give\r\nthem back as good as they give me. It\xe2\x80\x99s their power of silence and\r\nindifference, it\xe2\x80\x99s their capacity for making themselves deaf. Here am I\r\nwith something to say to them, something important and essential. And\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying it for more than fifteen years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been shouting it.\r\nThey pay no attention. I bring them my head and heart on a charger, and\r\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t even notice that the things are there. I sometimes wonder how\r\nmuch longer I can manage to go on.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice had become very low, and\r\nit trembled. \xe2\x80\x9cOne\xe2\x80\x99s nearly forty, you know....\xe2\x80\x9d The voice faded huskily\r\naway into silence. Languidly and as though the business exhausted him,\r\nhe began mixing colours on his palette.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash looked at him. No, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t young; at the moment, indeed,\r\nhe seemed to have become much older than he really was. An old man was\r\nstanding there, peaked and sharp and worn. He had failed, he was\r\nunhappy. But the world would have been unjuster, less discriminating if\r\nit had given him success.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome people believe in you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; there was nothing else for her\r\nto say.\r\n\r\nLypiatt looked up at her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash nodded, deliberately. It was a lie. But was it possible to\r\ntell the truth? \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then there is the future,\xe2\x80\x9d she reassured him, and\r\nher faint death-bed voice seemed to prophesy with a perfect certainty.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not forty yet; you\xe2\x80\x99ve got twenty, thirty years of work in front\r\nof you. And there were others, after all, who had to wait\xe2\x80\x94a long\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94sometimes till after they were dead. Great men; Blake, for\r\ninstance....\xe2\x80\x9d She felt positively ashamed; it was like a little talk by\r\nDoctor Frank Crane. But she felt still more ashamed, when she saw that\r\nCasimir had begun to cry and that the tears were rolling, one after\r\nanother, slowly down his face.\r\n\r\nHe put down his palette, he stepped on to the dais, he came and knelt at\r\nMrs. Viveash\xe2\x80\x99s feet. He took one of her hands between his own and he\r\nbent over it, pressing it to his forehead, as though it were a charm\r\nagainst unhappy thoughts, sometimes kissing it; soon it was wet with\r\ntears. He wept almost in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash kept repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d and she\r\nlaid her free hand on his bowed head, she patted it comfortingly as one\r\nmight pat the head of a large dog that comes and thrusts its muzzle\r\nbetween one\xe2\x80\x99s knees. She felt, even as she made it, how meaningless and\r\nunintimate the gesture was. If she had liked him, she would have run her\r\nfingers through his hair; but somehow his hair rather disgusted her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right, all right.\xe2\x80\x9d But, of course, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all right; and\r\nshe was comforting him under false pretences and he was kneeling at the\r\nfeet of somebody who simply wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there\xe2\x80\x94so utterly detached, so far\r\naway she was from all this scene and all his misery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re the only person,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cwho cares or understands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash could almost have laughed.\r\n\r\nHe began once more to kiss her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful and enchanting Myra\xe2\x80\x94you were always that. But now you\xe2\x80\x99re good\r\nand dear as well, now I know you\xe2\x80\x99re kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Casimir!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Why was it that people always got involved in\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s life? If only one could manage things on the principle of the\r\nrailways! Parallel tracks\xe2\x80\x94that was the thing. For a few miles you\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nrunning at the same speed. There\xe2\x80\x99d be delightful conversation out of the\r\nwindows; you\xe2\x80\x99d exchange the omelette in your restaurant car for the\r\nvol-au-vent in theirs. And when you\xe2\x80\x99d said all there was to say, you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nput on a little more steam, wave your hand, blow a kiss and away you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngo, forging ahead along the smooth, polished rails. But instead of that,\r\nthere were these dreadful accidents; the points were wrongly set, the\r\ntrains came crashing together; or people jumped on as you were passing\r\nthrough the stations and made a nuisance of themselves and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nallow themselves to be turned off. Poor Casimir! But he irritated her,\r\nhe was a horrible bore. She ought to have stopped seeing him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t wholly dislike me, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut of course not, my poor Casimir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you knew how horribly I loved you!\xe2\x80\x9d He looked up at her\r\ndespairingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xe2\x80\x99s the good?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever known what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to love some one so much that you\r\nfeel you could die of it? So that it hurts all the time. As though there\r\nwere a wound. Have you ever known that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash smiled her agonizing smile, nodded slowly and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps. And one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t die, you know. One doesn\xe2\x80\x99t die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLypiatt was leaning back, staring fixedly up at her. The tears were dry\r\non his face, his cheeks were flushed. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cto love so much, that you begin to long for the anodyne of\r\nphysical pain to quench the pain in the soul? You don\xe2\x80\x99t know that.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nsuddenly, with his clenched fist, he began to bang the wooden dais on\r\nwhich he was kneeling, blow after blow, with all his strength.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash leant forward and tried to arrest his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re mad,\r\nCasimir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re mad. Don\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke with anger.\r\n\r\nLypiatt laughed till his face was all broken up with the grimace, and\r\nproffered for her inspection his bleeding knuckles. The skin hung in\r\nlittle white tags and tatters, and from below the blood was slowly\r\noozing up to the surface. \xe2\x80\x9cLook,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and laughed again. Then\r\nsuddenly, with an extraordinary agility, he jumped to his feet, bounded\r\nfrom the dais and began once more to stride up and down the fairway\r\nbetween his easel and the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God,\xe2\x80\x9d he kept repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cby God, by God. I feel it in me. I can\r\nface the whole lot of you; the whole damned lot. Yes, and I shall get\r\nthe better of you yet. An Artist\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he called up that traditional ghost\r\nand it comforted him; he wrapped himself with a protective gesture\r\nwithin the ample folds of its bright mantle\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9can Artist doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fail\r\nunder unhappiness. He gets new strength from it. The torture makes him\r\nsweat new masterpieces....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to talk about his books, his poems and pictures; all the great\r\nthings in his head, the things he had already done. He talked about his\r\nexhibition\xe2\x80\x94ah, by God, that would astonish them, that would bowl them\r\nover, this time. The blood mounted to his face; there was a flush over\r\nthe high projecting cheek-bones. He could feel the warm blood behind his\r\neyes. He laughed aloud; he was a laughing lion. He stretched out his\r\narms; he was enormous, his arms reached out like the branches of a\r\ncedar. The Artist walked across the world and the mangy dogs ran yelping\r\nand snapping behind him. The great wind blew and blew, driving him on;\r\nit lifted him and he began to fly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash listened. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t look as though he would get much\r\nfurther with the portrait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Press Day. The critics had begun to arrive; Mr. Albemarle\r\ncirculated among them with a ducal amiability. The young assistant\r\nhovered vaguely about, straining to hear what the great men had to say\r\nand trying to pretend that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t eavesdropping. Lypiatt\xe2\x80\x99s pictures\r\nhung on the walls, and Lypiatt\xe2\x80\x99s catalogue, thick with its preface and\r\nits explanatory notes, was in all hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery strong,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Albemarle kept repeating, \xe2\x80\x9cvery strong indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d It\r\nwas his password for the day.\r\n\r\nLittle Mr. Clew, who represented the _Daily Post_, was inclined to be\r\nenthusiastic. \xe2\x80\x9cHow well he writes!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mr. Albemarle, looking up\r\nfrom the catalogue. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how well he paints! What _impasto_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_Impasto, impasto_\xe2\x80\x94the young assistant sidled off unobtrusively to the\r\ndesk and made a note of it. He would look the word up in Grubb\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_Dictionary of Art and Artists_ later on. He made his way back,\r\ncircuitously and as though by accident, into Mr. Clew\xe2\x80\x99s neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nMr. Clew was one of those rare people who have a real passion for art.\r\nHe loved painting, all painting, indiscriminately. In a picture gallery\r\nhe was like a Turk in a harem; he adored them all. He loved Memling as\r\nmuch as Raphael, he loved Gr\xc3\xbcnewald and Michelangelo, Holman Hunt and\r\nManet, Romney and Tintoretto; how happy he could be with all of them!\r\nSometimes, it is true, he hated; but that was only when familiarity had\r\nnot yet bred love. At the first Post-Impressionist Exhibition, for\r\nexample, in 1911, he had taken a very firm stand. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is an obscene\r\nfarce,\xe2\x80\x9d he had written then. Now, however, there was no more passionate\r\nadmirer of Matisse\xe2\x80\x99s genius. As a connoisseur and _kunstforscher_, Mr.\r\nClew was much esteemed. People would bring him dirty old pictures to\r\nlook at, and he would exclaim at once: Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s an El Greco, a\r\nPiazetta, or some other suitable name. Asked how he knew, he would shrug\r\nhis shoulders and say: But it\xe2\x80\x99s signed all over. His certainty and his\r\nenthusiasm were infectious. Since the coming of El Greco into fashion,\r\nhe had discovered dozens of early works by that great artist. For Lord\r\nPetersfield\xe2\x80\x99s collection alone he had found four early El Grecos, all by\r\npupils of Bassano. Lord Petersfield\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in Mr. Clew was\r\nunbounded; not even that affair of the Primitives had shaken it. It was\r\na sad affair: Lord Petersfield\xe2\x80\x99s Duccio had shown signs of cracking; the\r\nestate carpenter was sent for to take a look at the panel; he had\r\nlooked. \xe2\x80\x9cA worse-seasoned piece of Illinois hickory,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnever seen.\xe2\x80\x9d After that he looked at the Simone Martini; for that, on\r\nthe contrary, he was full of praise. Smooth-grained, well-seasoned\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t crack, no, not in a hundred years. \xe2\x80\x9cA nicer slice of board\r\nnever came out of America.\xe2\x80\x9d He had a hyperbolical way of speaking. Lord\r\nPetersfield was extremely angry; he dismissed the estate carpenter on\r\nthe spot. After that he told Mr. Clew that he wanted a Giorgione, and\r\nMr. Clew went out and found him one which was signed all over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like this very much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Clew, pointing to one of the thoughts\r\nwith which Lypiatt had prefaced his catalogue. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Genius,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he adjusted\r\nhis spectacles and began to read aloud, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98is life. Genius is a force of\r\nnature. In art, nothing else counts. The modern impotents, who are\r\nafraid of genius and who are envious of it, have invented in\r\nself-defence the notion of the Artist. The Artist with his sense of\r\nform, his style, his devotion to pure beauty, et cetera, et cetera. But\r\nGenius includes the Artist; every Genius has, among very many others,\r\nthe qualities attributed by the impotents to the Artist. The Artist\r\nwithout genius is a carver of fountains through which no water flows.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nVery true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Clew, \xe2\x80\x9cvery true indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d He marked the passage\r\nwith his pencil.\r\n\r\nMr. Albemarle produced the password. \xe2\x80\x9cVery strongly put,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always felt that myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Clew. \xe2\x80\x9cEl Greco, for\r\nexample....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, what about El Greco?\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice, all in one breath.\r\nThe thin, long, skin-covered skeleton of Mr. Mallard hung over them like\r\na guilty conscience. Mr. Mallard wrote every week in the _Hebdomadal\r\nDigest_. He had an immense knowledge of art, and a sincere dislike of\r\nall that was beautiful. The only modern painter whom he really admired\r\nwas Hodler. All others were treated by him with a merciless savagery; he\r\ntore them to pieces in his weekly articles with all the holy gusto of a\r\nCalvinist iconoclast smashing images of the Virgin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about El Greco?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. He had a peculiarly passionate\r\nloathing of El Greco.\r\n\r\nMr. Clew smiled up at him propitiatingly; he was afraid of Mr. Mallard.\r\nHis enthusiasms were no match for Mr. Mallard\xe2\x80\x99s erudite and logical\r\ndisgusts. \xe2\x80\x9cI was merely quoting him as an example,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn example, I hope, of incompetent drawing, baroque composition,\r\ndisgusting forms, garish colouring and hysterical subject-matter.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nMallard showed his old ivory teeth in a menacing smile. \xe2\x80\x9cThose are the\r\nonly things which El Greco\xe2\x80\x99s work exemplifies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Clew gave a nervous little laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of these?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked, pointing to Lypiatt\xe2\x80\x99s canvases.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey look to me very ordinarily bad,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Mallard.\r\n\r\nThe young assistant listened appalled. In a business like this, how was\r\nit possible to make good?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Clew courageously, \xe2\x80\x9cI like that bowl of roses\r\nin the window with the landscape behind. Number twenty-nine.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked\r\nin the catalogue. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s a really charming little verse about it:\r\n\r\n             \xe2\x80\x98O beauty of the rose,\r\n             Goodness as well as perfume exhaling!\r\n             Who gazes on these flowers,\r\n             On this blue hill and ripening field\xe2\x80\x94he knows\r\n             Where duty leads and that the nameless Powers\r\n             In a rose can speak their will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nReally charming!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Clew made another mark with his pencil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut commonplace, commonplace.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mallard shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd in any\r\ncase a verse can\xe2\x80\x99t justify a bad picture. What an unsubtle harmony of\r\ncolour! And how uninteresting the composition is! That receding\r\ndiagonal\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s been worked to death.\xe2\x80\x9d He too made a mark in his\r\ncatalogue\xe2\x80\x94a cross and a little circle, arranged like the skull and\r\ncross-bones on a pirate\xe2\x80\x99s flag. Mr. Mallard\xe2\x80\x99s catalogues were always\r\ncovered with these little marks: they were his symbols of condemnation.\r\n\r\nMr. Albemarle, meanwhile, had moved away to greet the new arrivals. To\r\nthe critic of the _Daily Cinema_ he had to explain that there were no\r\nportraits of celebrities. The reporter from the _Evening Planet_ had to\r\nbe told which were the best pictures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Lypiatt,\xe2\x80\x9d he dictated, \xe2\x80\x9cis a poet and philosopher as well as a\r\npainter. His catalogue is a\xe2\x80\x94h\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94declaration of faith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reporter took it down in shorthand. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd very nice too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m most grateful to you, sir, most grateful.\xe2\x80\x9d And he hurried away, to\r\nget to the Cattle Show before the King should arrive. Mr. Albemarle\r\naffably addressed himself to the critic of the _Morning Globe_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _al_ways regard this gallery,\xe2\x80\x9d said a loud and cheerful voice, full\r\nof bulls and canaries in chorus, \xe2\x80\x9cas positively a _mauvais lieu_. Such\r\nexhibitions!\xe2\x80\x9d And Mr. Mercaptan shrugged his shoulders expressively. He\r\nhalted to wait for his companion.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash had lagged behind, reading the catalogue as she slowly\r\nwalked along. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a complete book,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cfull of poems and\r\nessays and short stories even, so far as I can see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the usual cracker mottoes.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mercaptan laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI know the sort\r\nof thing. \xe2\x80\x98Look after the past and the future will look after itself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98God squared minus Man squared equals Art-plus-life times\r\nArt-minus-Life.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98The Higher the Art the fewer the morals\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94only that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo nearly good sense to have been invented by Lypiatt. But I know the\r\nsort of thing. I could go on like that for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mercaptan was\r\ndelighted with himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll read you one of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A picture is a\r\nchemical combination of plastic form and spiritual significance.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrikey!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mercaptan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Those who think that a picture is a matter of nothing but plastic form\r\nare like those who imagine that water is made of nothing but hydrogen.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan made a grimace. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat writing!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9c_le style\r\nc\xe2\x80\x99est l\xe2\x80\x99homme_. Lypiatt hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got a style. Argal\xe2\x80\x94inexorable\r\nconclusion\xe2\x80\x94Lypiatt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist. My word, though. Look at those\r\nhorrible great nudes there. Like Carracis with cubical muscles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSampson and Delilah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you like me to read\r\nabout them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash did not press the matter. Casimir, she thought, must have\r\nbeen thinking of her when he wrote this little poem about Poets and\r\nWomen, crossed genius, torments, the sweating of masterpieces. She\r\nsighed. \xe2\x80\x9cThose leopards are rather nice,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and looked at the\r\ncatalogue again. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98An animal is a symbol and its form is significant. In\r\nthe long process of adaptation, evolution has refined and simplified and\r\nshaped, till every part of the animal expresses one desire, a single\r\nidea. Man, who has become what he is, not by specialization, but by\r\ngeneralization, symbolizes with his body no one thing. He is a symbol of\r\neverything from the most hideous and ferocious bestiality to godhead.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mercaptan.\r\n\r\nA canvas of mountains and enormous clouds like nascent sculptures\r\npresented itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Aerial Alps\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash began to read.\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Aerial Alps of amber and of snow,\r\n               Junonian flesh, and bosomy alabaster\r\n               Carved by the wind\xe2\x80\x99s uncertain hands....\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan stopped his ears. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, please,\xe2\x80\x9d he begged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNumber seventeen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, \xe2\x80\x9cis called \xe2\x80\x98Woman on a Cosmic\r\nbackground,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d A female figure stood leaning against a pillar on a\r\nhilltop, and beyond was a blue night with stars. \xe2\x80\x9cUnderneath is written:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For one at least, she is more than the starry universe.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash\r\nremembered that Lypiatt had once said very much that sort of thing to\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cSo many of Casimir\xe2\x80\x99s things remind me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cof those\r\nItalian vermouth advertisements. You know\xe2\x80\x94Cinzano, Bonomelli and all\r\nthese. I wish they didn\xe2\x80\x99t. This woman in white with her head in the\r\nGreat Bear....\xe2\x80\x9d She shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Casimir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan roared and squealed with laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cBonomelli,\xe2\x80\x9d he said;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s precisely it. What a critic, Myra! I take off my hat.\xe2\x80\x9d They\r\nmoved on. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s this grand transformation scene?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash looked at the catalogue. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x98The Sermon on the\r\nMount,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd really, do you know, I rather like it. All that\r\ncrowd of figures slanting up the hill and the single figure on the\r\ntop\xe2\x80\x94it seems to me very dramatic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy _dear_,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Mr. Mercaptan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in spite of everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, feeling suddenly and\r\nuncomfortably that she had somehow been betraying the man, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s really\r\nvery nice, you know. Very nice, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d Her expiring voice sounded very\r\ndecidedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, _ces femmes_,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Mercaptan, \xe2\x80\x9c_ces femmes_! They\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\nPasiphaes and Ledas. They all in their hearts prefer beasts to men,\r\nsavages to civilized beings. _Even_ you, Myra, I _really_ believe.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash ignored the outburst. \xe2\x80\x9cVery nice,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated\r\nthoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly rather a bore....\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice expired altogether.\r\n\r\nThey continued their round of the gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nCritically, in the glasses of Mr. Bojanus\xe2\x80\x99s fitting-room, Gumbril\r\nexamined his profile, his back view. Inflated, the Patent Small-Clothes\r\nbulged, bulged decidedly, though with a certain gracious opulence that\r\nmight, in a person of the other sex, have seemed only deliciously\r\nnatural. In him, however, Gumbril had to admit, the opulence seemed a\r\nlittle misplaced and paradoxical. Still, if one has to suffer in order\r\nto be beautiful, one must also expect to be ugly in order not to suffer.\r\nPractically, the trousers were a tremendous success. He sat down heavily\r\non the hard wooden bench of the fitting-room and was received as though\r\non a lap of bounding resiliency; the Patent Small-Clothes, there was no\r\ndoubt, would be proof even against marble. And the coat, he comforted\r\nhimself, would mask with its skirts the too decided bulge. Or if it\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t, well, there was no help for it. One must resign oneself to\r\nbulging, that was all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery nice,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared at last.\r\n\r\nMr. Bojanus, who had been watching his client in silence and with a\r\npolite but also, Gumbril could not help feeling, a somewhat ironical\r\nsmile, coughed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt depends,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely what you mean by\r\n\xe2\x80\x98nice.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d He cocked his head on one side, and the fine waxed end of his\r\nmoustache was like a pointer aimed up at some remote star.\r\n\r\nGumbril said nothing, but catching sight once more of his own side view,\r\nnodded a dubious agreement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf by nice,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Bojanus, \xe2\x80\x9cyou mean comfortable, well and\r\ngood. If, however, you mean elegant, then, Mr. Gumbril, I fear I must\r\ndisagree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut elegance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, feebly playing the philosopher, \xe2\x80\x9cis only\r\nrelative, Mr. Bojanus. There are certain African negroes, among whom it\r\nis considered elegant to pierce the lips and distend them with wooden\r\nplates, until the mouth looks like a pelican\xe2\x80\x99s beak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bojanus placed his hand in his bosom and slightly bowed. \xe2\x80\x9cVery\r\npossibly, Mr. Gumbril,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you\xe2\x80\x99ll pardon my saying so,\r\nwe are not African negroes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril was crushed, deservedly. He looked at himself again in the\r\nmirrors. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you object,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cto all eccentricities\r\nin dress, Mr. Bojanus? Would you put us all into your elegant uniform?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bojanus. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are certain walks of life\r\nin which eccentricity in appearance is positively a _sine qua non_, Mr.\r\nGumbril, and I might almost say _de rigueur_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd which walks of life, Mr. Bojanus, may I ask? You refer, perhaps, to\r\nthe artistic walks? Sombreros and Byronic collars and possibly velveteen\r\ntrousers? Though all that sort of thing is surely a little out of date,\r\nnowadays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEnigmatically Mr. Bojanus smiled, a playful Sphinx. He thrust his right\r\nhand deeper into his bosom and with his left twisted to a finer needle\r\nthe point of his moustache. \xe2\x80\x9cNot artists, Mr. Gumbril.\xe2\x80\x9d He shook his\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x9cIn practice they may show themselves a little eccentric and\r\nnegleejay. But they have no need to look unusual on principle. It\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nthe politicians who need do it on principle. It\xe2\x80\x99s only _de rigueur_, as\r\none might say, in the political walks, Mr. Gumbril.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou surprise me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought that it was to\r\nthe politician\xe2\x80\x99s interest to look respectable and normal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is still more to his interest as a leader of men to look\r\ndistinguished,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bojanus replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, not precisely\r\ndistinguished,\xe2\x80\x9d he corrected himself, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause that implies that\r\npoliticians look _distangay_, which I regret to say, Mr. Gumbril, they\r\nvery often don\xe2\x80\x99t. Distinguishable, is more what I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEccentricity is their badge of office?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Gumbril. He sat down\r\nluxuriously on the Patent Small-Clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s more like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bojanus, tilting his moustaches. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nleader has got to look different from the other ones. In the good old\r\ndays they always wore their official badges. The leader \xe2\x80\x99ad his livery,\r\nlike every one else, to show who he was. That was sensible, Mr. Gumbril.\r\nNowadays he has no badge\xe2\x80\x94at least not for ordinary occasions\xe2\x80\x94for I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncount Privy Councillors\xe2\x80\x99 uniforms and all that sort of once-a-year fancy\r\ndress. \xe2\x80\x99E\xe2\x80\x99s reduced to dressing in some eccentric way or making the most\r\nof the peculiarities of \xe2\x80\x99is personal appearance. A very \xe2\x80\x99apazard method\r\nof doing things, Mr. Gumbril, very \xe2\x80\x99apazard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril agreed.\r\n\r\nMr. Bojanus went on, making small, neat gestures as he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwear \xe2\x80\x99uge collars, like Mr. Gladstone. Some wear\r\norchids and eyeglasses, like Joe Chamberlain. Some let their \xe2\x80\x99air grow,\r\nlike Lloyd George. Some wear curious \xe2\x80\x99ats, like Winston Churchill. Some\r\nput on black shirts, like this Mussolini, and some put on red ones, like\r\nGaribaldi. Some turn up their moustaches, like the German Emperor. Some\r\nturn them down, like Clemenceau. Some grow whiskers, like Tirpitz. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t speak of all the uniforms, orders, ornaments, \xe2\x80\x99ead-dresses,\r\nfeathers, crowns, buttons, tattooings, ear-rings, sashes, swords,\r\ntrains, tiaras, urims, thummims and what not, Mr. Gumbril, that \xe2\x80\x99ave\r\nbeen used in the past and in other parts of the world to distinguish the\r\nleader. We, \xe2\x80\x99oo know our \xe2\x80\x99istory, Mr. Gumbril, we know all about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril made a deprecating gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cYou speak for yourself, Mr.\r\nBojanus,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Bojanus bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray continue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\nMr. Bojanus bowed again. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Gumbril,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe point of all\r\nthese things, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve already remarked, is to make the leader look\r\ndifferent, so that \xe2\x80\x99e can be recognized at the first _coop d\xe2\x80\x99oil_, as\r\nyou might say, by the \xe2\x80\x99erd \xe2\x80\x99e \xe2\x80\x99appens to be leading. For the \xe2\x80\x99uman \xe2\x80\x99erd,\r\nMr. Gumbril, is an \xe2\x80\x99erd which can\xe2\x80\x99t do without a leader. Sheep, for\r\nexample: I never noticed that they \xe2\x80\x99ad a leader; nor rooks. Bees, on the\r\nother \xe2\x80\x99and, I take it, \xe2\x80\x99ave. At least when they\xe2\x80\x99re swarming. Correct me,\r\nMr. Gumbril, if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong. Natural \xe2\x80\x99istory was never, as you might say,\r\nmy _forty_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor mine,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Gumbril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for elephants and wolves, Mr. Gumbril, I can\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to speak of\r\nthem with first-\xe2\x80\x99and knowledge. Nor llamas, nor locusts, nor squab\r\npigeons, nor lemmings. But \xe2\x80\x99uman beings, Mr. Gumbril, those I can claim\r\nto talk of with authority, if I may say so in all modesty, and not as\r\nthe scribes. I \xe2\x80\x99ave made a special study of them, Mr. Gumbril. And my\r\nprofession \xe2\x80\x99as brought me into contact with very numerous specimens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril could not help wondering where precisely in Mr. Bojanus\xe2\x80\x99s museum\r\nhe himself had his place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x99uman \xe2\x80\x99erd,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bojanus went on, \xe2\x80\x9cmust have a leader. And a leader\r\nmust have something to distinguish him from the \xe2\x80\x99erd. It\xe2\x80\x99s important for\r\n\xe2\x80\x99is interests that he should be recognized easily. See a baby reaching\r\nout of a bath and you immediately think of Pears\xe2\x80\x99 Soap; see the white\r\n\xe2\x80\x99air waving out behind and think of Lloyd George. That\xe2\x80\x99s the secret. But\r\nin my opinion, Mr. Gumbril, the old system was much more sensible, give\r\nthem regular uniforms and badges, I say; make Cabinet Ministers wear\r\nfeathers in their \xe2\x80\x99air. Then the people will be looking to a real fixed\r\nsymbol of leadership, not to the peculiarities of the mere individuals.\r\nBeards and \xe2\x80\x99air and funny collars change; but a good uniform is always\r\nthe same. Give them feathers, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I say, Mr. Gumbril. Feathers\r\nwill increase the dignity of the State and lessen the importance of the\r\nindividual. And that,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Mr. Bojanus with emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, Mr.\r\nGumbril, will be all to the good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if I chose to show\r\nmyself to the multitude in my inflated trousers, I could become a\r\nleader\xe2\x80\x94do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bojanus. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99ave to \xe2\x80\x99ave the talent for talking\r\nand ordering people about, to begin with. Feathers wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give the\r\ngenius, but they\xe2\x80\x99d magnify the effect of what there was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril got up and began to divest himself of the Small-Clothes. He\r\nunscrewed the valve and the air whistled out, dyingly. He too sighed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurious,\xe2\x80\x9d he said pensively, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\xe2\x80\x99ve never felt the need for a\r\nleader. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never met any one I felt I could whole-heartedly admire or\r\nbelieve in, never any one I wanted to follow. It must be pleasant, I\r\nshould think, to hand oneself over to somebody else. It must give you a\r\nwarm, splendid, comfortable feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bojanus smiled and shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou and I, Mr. Gumbril,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re not the sort of people to be impressed with feathers or\r\neven by talking and ordering about. We may not be leaders ourselves. But\r\nat any rate we aren\xe2\x80\x99t the \xe2\x80\x99erd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the main herd, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot any \xe2\x80\x99erd,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bojanus insisted proudly.\r\n\r\nGumbril shook his head dubiously and buttoned up his trousers. He was\r\nnot sure, now he came to think of it, that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to all the\r\nherds\xe2\x80\x94by a sort of honorary membership and temporarily, as occasion\r\noffered, as one belongs to the Union at the sister university or to the\r\nNaval and Military Club while one\xe2\x80\x99s own is having its annual clean-out.\r\nShearwater\xe2\x80\x99s herd, Lypiatt\xe2\x80\x99s herd, Mr. Mercaptan\xe2\x80\x99s herd, Mrs. Viveash\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nherd, the architectural herd of his father, the educational herd (but\r\nthat, thank God! was now bleating on distant pastures), the herd of Mr.\r\nBojanus\xe2\x80\x94he belonged to them all a little, to none of them completely.\r\nNobody belonged to his herd. How could they? No chameleon can live with\r\ncomfort on a tartan. He put on his coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send the garments this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bojanus. Gumbril left\r\nthe shop. At the theatrical wig-maker\xe2\x80\x99s in Leicester Square he ordered a\r\nblond fan-shaped beard to match his own hair and moustache. He would, at\r\nany rate, be his own leader; he would wear a badge, a symbol of\r\nauthority. And Coleman had said that there were dangerous relations to\r\nbe entered into by the symbol\xe2\x80\x99s aid.\r\n\r\nAh, now he was provisionally a member of Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s herd. It was all very\r\ndepressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nFan-shaped, blond, mounted on gauze and guaranteed undetectable, it\r\narrived from the wig-maker, preciously packed in a stout cardboard box\r\nsix times too large for it and accompanied by a quarter of a pint of the\r\nchoicest spirit gum. In the privacy of his bedroom Gumbril uncoffined\r\nit, held it out for his own admiration, caressed its silkiness and\r\nfinally tried it on, holding it provisionally to his chin, in front of\r\nthe looking-glass. The effect, he decided immediately, was stunning, was\r\ngrandiose. From melancholy and all too mild he saw himself transformed\r\non the instant into a sort of jovial Henry the Eighth, into a massive\r\nRabelaisian man, broad and powerful and exuberant with vitality and\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of his face were startlingly altered. The podium, below\r\nthe mouth, had been insufficiently massive to carry the stately order of\r\nthe nose; and the ratiocinative attic of the forehead, noble enough, no\r\ndoubt, in itself, had been disproportionately high. The beard now\r\nsupplied the deficiencies in the stylobate, and planted now on a firm\r\nbasement of will, the order of the senses, the aerial attic of ideas,\r\nreared themselves with a more classical harmoniousness of proportion. It\r\nonly remained for him to order from Mr. Bojanus an American coat, padded\r\nout at the shoulders as squarely and heroically as a doublet of the\r\nCinquecento, and he would look the complete Rabelaisian man. Great\r\neater, deep drinker, stout fighter, prodigious lover; clear thinker,\r\ncreator of beauty, seeker of truth and prophet of heroic grandeurs.\r\nFitted out with coat and beard, he could qualify for the next vacancy\r\namong the c\xc5\x93nobites of Thelema.\r\n\r\nHe removed his beard\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cput his beaver up,\xe2\x80\x9d as they used to say in the\r\nfine old days of chivalry; he would have to remember that little joke\r\nfor Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s benefit. He put his beaver up\xe2\x80\x94ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x94and stared ruefully\r\nat the far from Rabelaisian figure which now confronted him. The\r\nmoustache\xe2\x80\x94that was genuine enough\xe2\x80\x94which had looked, in conjunction with\r\nthe splendid work of art below, so fierce and manly, served by itself,\r\nhe now perceived, only droopily to emphasize his native mildness and\r\nmelancholy.\r\n\r\nIt was a dismal affair, which might have belonged to Maurice Barr\xc3\xa8s in\r\nyouth; a slanting, flagging, sagging thing, such as could only grow on\r\nthe lip of an assiduous Cultivator of the Me, and would become, as one\r\ngrew older, ludicrously out of place on the visage of a roaring\r\nNationalist. If it weren\xe2\x80\x99t that it fitted in so splendidly with the\r\nbeard, if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t that it became so marvellously different in the new\r\ncontext he had now discovered for it, he would have shaved it off then\r\nand there.\r\n\r\nMournful appendage. But now he would transform it, he would add to it\r\nits better half. Zadig\xe2\x80\x99s quatrain to his mistress, when the tablet on\r\nwhich it was written was broken in two, became a treasonable libel on\r\nthe king. So this moustache, thought Gumbril, as gingerly he applied the\r\nspirit gum to his cheeks and chin, this moustache which by itself serves\r\nonly to betray me, becomes, as soon as it is joined to its missing\r\ncontext, an amorous arm for the conquest of the fair sex.\r\n\r\nA little far-fetched, he decided; a little ponderous. And besides, as so\r\nfew people had read Zadig, not much use in conversation. Cautiously and\r\nwith neat, meticulous finger-tips he adjusted the transformation to his\r\ngummed face, pressed it firmly, held it while it stuck fast. The portals\r\nof Thelema opened before him; he was free of those rich orchards, those\r\nhalls and courts, those broad staircases winding in noble spirals within\r\nthe flanks of each of the fair round towers. And it was Coleman who had\r\npointed out the way; he felt duly grateful. One last look at the\r\nComplete Man, one final and definitive constatation that the Mild and\r\nMelancholy one was, for the time at least, no more; and he was ready in\r\nall confidence to set out. He selected a loose, light great-coat\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nthat he needed a coat at all, for the day was bright and warm; but until\r\nMr. Bojanus had done his labour of padding he would have to broaden\r\nhimself out in this way, even if it did mean that he might be\r\nuncomfortably hot. To fall short of Complete Manhood for fear of a\r\nlittle inconvenience would be absurd. He slipped, therefore, into his\r\nlight coat\xe2\x80\x94a toga, Mr. Bojanus called it, a very neat toga in real West\r\nCountry whipcord. He put on his broadest and blackest felt hat, for\r\nbreadth above everything was what he needed to give him completeness,\r\nbreadth of stature, breadth of mind, breadth of human sympathy, breadth\r\nof smile, breadth of humour, breadth of everything. The final touch was\r\na massive and antique Malacca cane belonging to his father. If he had\r\npossessed a bulldog, he would have taken it out on a leash. But he did\r\nnot. He issued into the sunshine, unaccompanied.\r\n\r\nBut unaccompanied he did not mean to remain for long. These warm, bright\r\nMay days were wonderful days for being in love on. And to be alone on\r\nsuch days was like a malady. It was a malady from which the Mild and\r\nMelancholy Man suffered all too frequently. And yet there were millions\r\nof superfluous women in the country; millions of them. Every day, in the\r\nstreets, one saw thousands of them passing; and some were exquisite,\r\nwere ravishing, the only possible soul-mates. Thousands of unique\r\nsoul-mates every day. The Mild and Melancholy one allowed them to\r\npass\xe2\x80\x94for ever. But to-day\xe2\x80\x94to-day he was the complete and Rabelaisian\r\nman; he was bearded to the teeth; the imbecile game was at its height;\r\nthere would be opportunities, and the Complete Man could know how to\r\ntake them. No, he would not be unaccompanied for long.\r\n\r\nOutside in the square the fourteen plane trees glowed in their young,\r\nunsullied green. At the end of every street the golden muslin of the\r\nhaze hung in an unwrinkled curtain that thinned away above the sky\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngauzy horizon to transparent nothing against the intenser blue. The dim,\r\nconch-like murmur that in a city is silence seemed hazily to identify\r\nitself with the golden mistiness of summer, and against this dim, wide\r\nbackground the yells of the playing children detached themselves,\r\ndistinct and piercing. \xe2\x80\x9cBeaver\xe2\x80\x9d they shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cbeaver!\xe2\x80\x9d and, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it cold\r\nup there?\xe2\x80\x9d Full of playful menace, the Complete Man shook at them his\r\nborrowed Malacca. He accepted their prompt hail as the most favourable\r\nof omens.\r\n\r\nAt the first tobacconist\xe2\x80\x99s Gumbril bought the longest cigar he could\r\nfind, and trailing behind him expiring blue wreaths of Cuban smoke, he\r\nmade his way slowly and with an ample swagger towards the Park. It was\r\nthere, under the elms, on the shores of the ornamental waters, that he\r\nexpected to find his opportunity, that he intended\xe2\x80\x94how confidently\r\nbehind his Gargantuan mask!\xe2\x80\x94to take it.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity offered itself sooner than he expected.\r\n\r\nHe had just turned into the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Road and was sauntering past\r\nWhiteley\xe2\x80\x99s with the air of one who knows that he has a right to a good\r\nplace, to two or three good places even, in the sun, when he noticed\r\njust in front of him, peering intently at the New Season\xe2\x80\x99s Models, a\r\nyoung woman whom in his mild and melancholy days he would have only\r\nhopelessly admired, but who now, to the Complete Man, seemed a destined\r\nand accessible prey. She was fairly tall, but seemed taller than she\r\nactually was, by reason of her remarkable slenderness. Not that she\r\nlooked disagreeably thin, far from it. It was a rounded slenderness. The\r\nComplete Man decided to consider her as tubular\xe2\x80\x94flexible and tubular,\r\nlike a section of boa constrictor, should one say. She was dressed in\r\nclothes that emphasized this serpentine slimness, in a close-fitting\r\ngrey jacket that buttoned up to the neck and a long, narrow grey skirt\r\nthat came down to her ankles. On her head was a small, sleek black hat,\r\nthat looked almost as though it were made of metal. It was trimmed on\r\none side with a bunch of dull golden foliage.\r\n\r\nThose golden leaves were the only touch of ornament in all the severe\r\nsmoothness and unbroken tubularity of her person. As for her face, that\r\nwas neither strictly beautiful nor strictly ugly, but combined elements\r\nof both beauty and ugliness into a whole that was unexpected, that was\r\noddly and somehow unnaturally attractive.\r\n\r\nPretending, he too, to take an interest in the New Season\xe2\x80\x99s Models,\r\nGumbril made, squinting sideways over the burning tip of his cigar, an\r\ninventory of her features. The forehead, that was mostly hidden by her\r\nhat; it might be pensively and serenely high, it might be of that degree\r\nof lowness which in men is villainous, but in women is only another\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nrather rustic one perhaps, rather _canaille_ even, but definitely\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x94attraction. There was no telling. As for her eyes, they were\r\ngreen, and limpid; set wide apart in her head they looked out from under\r\nheavy lids and through openings that slanted up towards the outer\r\ncorners. Her nose was slightly aquiline. Her mouth was full-lipped, but\r\nstraight and unexpectedly wide. Her chin was small, round and firm. She\r\nhad a pale skin, a little flushed over the cheek-bones, which were\r\nprominent.\r\n\r\nOn the left cheek, close under the corner of the slanting eye, she had a\r\nbrown mole. Such hair as Gumbril could see beneath her hat was pale and\r\ninconspicuously blond. When she had finished looking at the New Season\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nModels she moved slowly on, halting for a moment before the travelling\r\ntrunks and the fitted picnic baskets; dwelling for a full minute over\r\nthe corsets, passing the hats, for some reason, rather contemptuously,\r\nbut pausing, which seemed strange, for a long pensive look at the cigars\r\nand wine. As for the tennis rackets and cricket bats, the school outfits\r\nand the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s hosiery\xe2\x80\x94she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t so much as a look for one of\r\nthem. But how lovingly she lingered before the boots and shoes! Her own\r\nfeet, the Complete Man noticed with satisfaction, had an elegance of\r\nflorid curves. And while other folk walked on neat\xe2\x80\x99s leather she was\r\ncontent to be shod with nothing coarser than mottled serpent\xe2\x80\x99s skin.\r\n\r\nSlowly they drifted up Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Road, lingering before every jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nevery antiquarian\xe2\x80\x99s, every milliner\xe2\x80\x99s on the way. The stranger gave him\r\nno opportunity, and indeed, Gumbril reflected, how should she? For the\r\nimbecile game on which he was relying is a travelling piquet for two\r\nplayers, not a game of patience. No sane human being could play it in\r\nsolitude. He would have to make the opportunity himself.\r\n\r\nAll that was mild in him, all that was melancholy, shrank with a\r\nsickened reluctance from the task of breaking\xe2\x80\x94with what consequences\r\ndelicious and perilous in the future or, in the case of the deserved\r\nsnub, immediately humiliating?\xe2\x80\x94a silence which, by the tenth or twelfth\r\nshop window, had become quite unbearably significant. The Mild and\r\nMelancholy one would have drifted to the top of the road, sharing, with\r\nthat community of tastes which is the basis of every happy union, her\r\nenthusiasm for brass candlesticks and toasting-forks, imitation\r\nChippendale furniture, gold watch-bracelets and low-waisted summer\r\nfrocks; would have drifted to the top of the road and watched her,\r\ndumbly, disappearing for ever into the green Park or along the blank\r\npavements of the Bayswater Road; would have watched her for ever\r\ndisappear and then, if the pubs had happened to be open, would have gone\r\nand ordered a glass of port, and sitting at the bar would have savoured,\r\nstill dumbly, among the other drinkers, the muddy grapes of the Douro,\r\nand his own unique loneliness.\r\n\r\nThat was what the Mild and Melancholy one would have done. But the\r\nsight, as he gazed earnestly into an antiquary\xe2\x80\x99s window, of his own\r\npowerful bearded face reflected in a sham Heppelwhite mirror, reminded\r\nhim that the Mild and Melancholy one was temporarily extinct, and that\r\nit was the Complete Man who now dawdled, smoking his long cigar, up the\r\nQueen\xe2\x80\x99s Road towards the Abbey of Thelema.\r\n\r\nHe squared his shoulders; in that loose toga of Mr. Bojanus\xe2\x80\x99s he looked\r\nas copious as Fran\xc3\xa7ois Premier. The time, he decided, had come.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that the reflection of the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s face joined\r\nitself in the little mirror, as she made a little movement away from the\r\nOld Welsh dresser in the corner, to that of his own. She looked at the\r\nspurious Heppelwhite. Their eyes met in the hospitable glass. Gumbril\r\nsmiled. The corners of the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s wide mouth seemed faintly to move;\r\nlike petals of the magnolia, her eyelids came slowly down over her\r\nslanting eyes. Gumbril turned from the reflection to the reality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to say Beaver,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Complete Man had made his first speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to say nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger. She spoke with a charming\r\nprecision and distinctness, lingering with a pretty emphasis on the _n_\r\nof nothing. \xe2\x80\x9cN\xe2\x80\x94n\xe2\x80\x94nothing\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it sounded rather final. She turned away, she\r\nmoved on.\r\n\r\nBut the Complete Man was not one to be put off by a mere ultimatum.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, falling into step with her, \xe2\x80\x9cnow I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndeserved snub. Honour is saved, prestige duly upheld. Now we can get on\r\nwith our conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Mild and Melancholy one stood by, gasping with astonished\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are v\xe2\x80\x94very impertinent,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, smiling and looking up\r\nfrom under the magnolia petals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is in my character,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Complete Man. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t blame me.\r\nOne cannot escape from one\xe2\x80\x99s heredity; that\xe2\x80\x99s one\xe2\x80\x99s share of original\r\nsin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is always grace,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger.\r\n\r\nGumbril caressed his beard. \xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI advise you to pr\xe2\x80\x94ray for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis prayer, the Mild and Melancholy one reflected, had already been\r\nanswered. The original sin in him had been self-corrected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is another antique shop,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we stop and have a\r\nlook at it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger glanced at him doubtfully. But he looked quite serious.\r\nThey stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow revolting this sham cottage furniture is,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril remarked. The\r\nshop, he noticed, was called \xe2\x80\x98Ye Olde Farme House.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe stranger, who had been on the point of saying how much she liked\r\nthose lovely Old Welsh dressers, gave him her heartiest agreement. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\r\nv\xe2\x80\x94vulgar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo horribly refined. So refined and artistic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed on a descending chromatic scale. This was excitingly new.\r\nPoor Aunt Aggie with her Arts and Crafts, and her old English furniture.\r\nAnd to think she had taken them so seriously! She saw in a flash the\r\nfastidious lady that she now was\xe2\x80\x94with Louis whatever-it-was furniture at\r\nhome, and jewels, and young poets to tea, and real artists. In the past,\r\nwhen she had imagined herself entertaining real artists, it had always\r\nbeen among really artistic furniture. Aunt Aggie\xe2\x80\x99s furniture. But\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94no, oh no. This man was probably an artist. His beard; and that big\r\nblack hat. But not poor; very well dressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s funny to think that there are people who call that sort of\r\nthing artistic. One\xe2\x80\x99s quite s\xe2\x80\x94sorry for them,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a little\r\nhiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a kind heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot v\xe2\x80\x94very kind, I\xe2\x80\x99m af\xe2\x80\x94fraid.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at him sideways, and\r\nsignificantly as the fastidious lady would have looked at one of the\r\npoets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, kind enough, I hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Complete Man. He was delighted\r\nwith his new acquaintance.\r\n\r\nTogether they disembogued into the Bayswater Road. It was here, Gumbril\r\nreflected, that the Mild and Melancholy one would dumbly have slunk away\r\nto his glass of port and his loneliness among the alien topers at the\r\nbar. But the Complete Man took his new friend by the elbow, and steered\r\nher into the traffic. Together they crossed the road, together entered\r\nthe park.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI still think you are v\xe2\x80\x94very impertinent,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat induced\r\nyou to follow me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a single comprehensive gesture, Gumbril indicated the sun, the sky,\r\nthe green trees airily glittering, the grass, the emerald lights and\r\nviolet shadows of the rustic distance. \xe2\x80\x9cOn a day like this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow could I help it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOriginal sin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d the Complete Man modestly shook his head, \xe2\x80\x9cI lay no claim to\r\noriginality in this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger laughed. This was nearly as good as a young poet at the\r\ntea-table. She was very glad that she\xe2\x80\x99d decided, after all, to put on\r\nher best suit this afternoon, even if it was a little stuffy for the\r\nwarmth of the day. He, too, she noticed, was wearing a great-coat; which\r\nseemed rather odd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it original,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cto go and tumble stupidly like an\r\nelephant into a pitfall, head over ears, at first sight...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him sideways, then closed down the magnolia petals, and\r\nsmiled. This was going to be the real thing\xe2\x80\x94one of those long, those\r\ninterminable, or, at any rate, indefinitely renewable conversations\r\nabout love; witty, subtle, penetrating and bold, like the conversations\r\nin books, like the conversations across the tea-table between brilliant\r\nyoung poets and ladies of quality, grown fastidious through an excessive\r\nexperience, fastidious and a little weary, but still, in their subtle\r\nway, insatiably curious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Gumbril, and he pointed to a couple of\r\ngreen iron chairs, standing isolated in the middle of the grass close\r\ntogether and with their fronts slanting inwards a little towards one\r\nanother in a position that suggested a confidential intimacy. At the\r\nprospect of the conversation that, inevitably, was about to unroll\r\nitself, he felt decidedly less elated than did his new friend. If there\r\nwas anything he disliked it was conversations about love. It bored him,\r\noh, it bored him most horribly, this minute analysis of the passion that\r\nyoung women always seemed to expect one, at some point or other in one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrelation with them, to make. How love alters the character for both good\r\nand bad; how physical passion need not be incompatible with the\r\nspiritual; how a hateful and tyrannous possessiveness can be allied in\r\nlove with the most unselfish solicitude for the other party\xe2\x80\x94oh, he knew\r\nall this and much more, so well, so well. And whether one can be in love\r\nwith more than one person at a time, whether love can exist without\r\njealousy, whether pity, affection, desire can in any way replace the\r\nfull and genuine passion\xe2\x80\x94how often he had had to thrash out these dreary\r\nquestions!\r\n\r\nAnd all the philosophic speculations were equally familiar, all the\r\nphysiological and anthropological and psychological facts. In the theory\r\nof the subject he had ceased to take any interest. Unhappily, a\r\ndiscussion of the theory always seemed to be an essential preliminary to\r\nthe practice of it. He sighed a little wearily as he took his seat on\r\nthe green iron chair. But then, recollecting that he was now the\r\nComplete Man, and that the Complete Man must do everything with a\r\nflourish and a high hand, he leaned forward and, smiling with a charming\r\ninsolence through his beard, began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTiresias, you may remember, was granted the singular privilege of\r\nliving both as a man and a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh, this was the genuine young poet. Supporting an elbow on the back of\r\nher chair and leaning her cheek against her hand, she disposed herself\r\nto listen and, where necessary, brilliantly to interpellate; it was\r\nthrough half-closed eyes that she looked at him, and she smiled faintly\r\nin a manner which she knew, from experience, to be enigmatic, and though\r\na shade haughty, though a tiny bit mocking and ironical, exceedingly\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\nAn hour and a half later they were driving towards an address in Bloxam\r\nGardens, Maida Vale. The name seemed vaguely familiar to Gumbril. Bloxam\r\nGardens\xe2\x80\x94perhaps one of his aunts had lived there once?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a dr\xe2\x80\x94dreadful little maisonnette,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained. \xe2\x80\x9cFull of awful\r\nthings. We had to take it furnished. It\xe2\x80\x99s so impossible to find anything\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril leaned back in his corner, wondering, as he studied that averted\r\nprofile, who or what this young woman could be. She seemed to be in the\r\nobvious movement, to like the sort of things one would expect people to\r\nlike; she seemed to be as highly civilized, in Mr. Mercaptan\xe2\x80\x99s rather\r\ntechnical sense of the term, as free of all prejudices as the great\r\nexponent of civilization himself.\r\n\r\nShe seemed, from her coolly dropped hints, to possess all the dangerous\r\nexperience, all the assurance and easy ruthlessness of a great lady\r\nwhose whole life is occupied in the interminable affairs of the heart,\r\nthe senses and the head. But, by a strange contradiction she seemed to\r\nfind her life narrow and uninteresting. She had complained in so many\r\nwords that her husband misunderstood and neglected her, had complained,\r\nby implication, that she knew very few interesting people.\r\n\r\nThe maisonnette in Bloxam Gardens was certainly not very splendid\xe2\x80\x94six\r\nrooms on the second and third floors of a peeling stucco house. And the\r\nfurniture\xe2\x80\x94decidedly Hire Purchase. And the curtains and\r\ncretonnes\xe2\x80\x94brightly \xe2\x80\x98modern,\xe2\x80\x99 positively \xe2\x80\x98futurist.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat one has to put up with in furnished flats!\xe2\x80\x9d The lady made a\r\ngrimace as she ushered him into the sitting-room. And while she spoke\r\nthe words, she really managed to persuade herself that the furniture\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t theirs, that they had found all this sordid stuff cluttering up\r\nthe rooms, not chosen it, oh with pains! themselves, not doggedly paid\r\nfor it, month by month.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur own things,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured vaguely, \xe2\x80\x9care stored. In the Riviera.\xe2\x80\x9d It\r\nwas there, under the palms, among the gaudy melon flowers and the\r\ncroupiers that the fastidious lady had last held her salon of young\r\npoets. In the Riviera\xe2\x80\x94that would explain, now she came to think of it, a\r\nlot of things, if explanation ever became necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Complete Man nodded sympathetically. \xe2\x80\x9cOther people\xe2\x80\x99s tastes,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nheld up his hands, they both laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why do we think of other\r\npeople?\xe2\x80\x9d he added. And coming forward with a conquering impulsiveness he\r\ntook both her long, fine hands in his and raised them to his bearded\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him for a second, then dropped her eyelids, took back her\r\nhands. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go and make the tea,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe servants\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the plural\r\nwas a pardonable exaggeration\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9care out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGallantly, the Complete Man offered to come and help her. These scenes\r\nof intimate life had a charm all their own. But she would not allow it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she was very firm, \xe2\x80\x9cI simply forbid you. You must stay here. I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d and she was gone, closing the door carefully behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\nLeft to himself, Gumbril sat down and filed his nails.\r\n\r\nAs for the young lady, she hurried along to her dingy little kitchen,\r\nlit the gas, put the kettle on, set out the teapot and the cups on a\r\ntray, and from the biscuit-box, where it was stored, took out the\r\nremains of a chocolate cake, which had already seen service at the\r\nday-before-yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s tea-party. When all was ready here, she tiptoed\r\nacross to her bedroom and sitting down at her dressing-table, began with\r\nhands that trembled a little with excitement to powder her nose, and\r\nheighten the colour of her cheeks. Even after the last touch had been\r\ngiven, she still sat there, looking at her image in the glass.\r\n\r\nThe lady and the poet, she was thinking, the _grande dame_ and the\r\nbrilliant young man of genius. She liked young men with beards. But he\r\nwas not an artist, in spite of the beard, in spite of the hat. He was a\r\nwriter of sorts. So she gathered; but he was reticent, he was\r\ndelightfully mysterious. She too, for that matter. The great lady slips\r\nout, masked, into the street; touches the young man\xe2\x80\x99s sleeve: Come with\r\nme. She chooses, does not let herself passively be chosen. The young\r\npoet falls at her feet; she lifts him up. One is accustomed to this sort\r\nof thing.\r\n\r\nShe opened her jewel box, took out all her rings\xe2\x80\x94there were not many of\r\nthem, alas!\xe2\x80\x94and put them on. Two or three of them, on second thoughts,\r\nshe took off again; they were a little, she suspected with a sudden\r\nqualm, in other people\xe2\x80\x99s taste.\r\n\r\nHe was very clever, very artistic\xe2\x80\x94only that seemed to be the wrong word\r\nto use; he seemed to know all the new things, all the interesting\r\npeople. Perhaps he would introduce her to some of them. And he was so\r\nmuch at ease behind his knowledge, so well assured. But for her part,\r\nshe felt pretty certain, she had made no stupid mistakes. She too had\r\nbeen, had looked at any rate\xe2\x80\x94which was the important thing\xe2\x80\x94very much at\r\nease.\r\n\r\nShe liked young men with beards. They looked so Russian. Catherine of\r\nRussia had been one of the great ladies with caprices. Masked in the\r\nstreets. Young poet, come with me. Or even, Young butcher\xe2\x80\x99s boy. But\r\nthat, no, that was going too far, too low. Still, life, life\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nthere to be lived\xe2\x80\x94life\xe2\x80\x94to be enjoyed. And now, and now? She was still\r\nwondering what would happen next, when the kettle, which was one of\r\nthose funny ones which whistle when they come to the boil, began,\r\nfitfully, at first, then, under full steam, unflaggingly, to sound its\r\nmournful, other-worldly note. She sighed and bestirred herself to attend\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me help you.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril jumped up as she came into the room. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ncan I do?\xe2\x80\x9d He hovered rather ineptly round her.\r\n\r\nThe lady put down her tray on the little table. \xe2\x80\x9cN\xe2\x80\x94nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN\xe2\x80\x94nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d he imitated her with a playful mockery. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I good for\r\nn\xe2\x80\x94nothing at all?\xe2\x80\x9d He took one of her hands and kissed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing that\xe2\x80\x99s of the l\xe2\x80\x94least importance.\xe2\x80\x9d She sat down and began to\r\npour out the tea.\r\n\r\nThe Complete Man also sat down. \xe2\x80\x9cSo to adore at first sight,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis not of the l\xe2\x80\x94least importance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, smiled, raised and lowered her eyelids. One was so\r\nwell accustomed to this sort of thing; it had no importance. \xe2\x80\x9cSugar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe asked. The young poet was safely there, sparkling across the\r\ntea-table. He offered love and she, with the easy heartlessness of one\r\nwho is so well accustomed to this sort of thing, offered him sugar.\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease. But if it\xe2\x80\x99s of no importance to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthen I\xe2\x80\x99ll go away at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady laughed her section of a descending chromatic scale. \xe2\x80\x9cOh no,\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d And she felt that the _grande dame_\r\nhad made a very fine stroke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right,\xe2\x80\x9d the Complete Man replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d He stirred his\r\ntea. \xe2\x80\x9cBut who are you,\xe2\x80\x9d he looked up at her suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou devilish\r\nfemale?\xe2\x80\x9d He was genuinely anxious to know; and besides, he was paying\r\nher a very pretty compliment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you do with your dangerous\r\nexistence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI enjoy life,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think one ought to enjoy life. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you? I\r\nthink it\xe2\x80\x99s one\xe2\x80\x99s first duty.\xe2\x80\x9d She became quite grave. \xe2\x80\x9cOne ought to\r\nenjoy every moment of it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, passionately, adventurously,\r\nnewly, excitingly, uniquely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Complete Man laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cA conscientious hedonist. I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt uncomfortably that the fastidious lady had not quite lived up\r\nto her character. She had spoken more like a young woman who finds life\r\ntoo dull and daily, and would like to get on to the cinema. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very\r\nconscientious,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, making significant play with the magnolia\r\npetals and smiling her riddling smile. She must retrieve the Great\r\nCatherine\xe2\x80\x99s reputation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could see that from the first,\xe2\x80\x9d mocked the Complete Man with a\r\ntriumphant insolence. \xe2\x80\x9cConscience doth make cowards of us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fastidious lady only contemptuously smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cHave a little chocolate\r\ncake,\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested. Her heart was beating. She wondered, she wondered.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence. Gumbril finished his chocolate cake, gloomily\r\ndrank his tea and did not speak. He found, all at once, that he had\r\nnothing to say. His jovial confidence seemed, for the moment, to have\r\ndeserted him. He was only the Mild and Melancholy one foolishly\r\ndisguised as a Complete Man; a sheep in beaver\xe2\x80\x99s clothing. He entrenched\r\nhimself behind his formidable silence and waited; waited, at first,\r\nsitting in his chair, then, when this total inactivity became\r\nunbearable, striding about the room.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, for all her air of serene composure, with a certain\r\ndisquiet. What on earth was he up to now? What could he be thinking\r\nabout? Frowning like that, he looked like a young Jupiter, bearded and\r\nburly (though not, she noticed, quite so burly as he had appeared in his\r\novercoat) making ready to throw a thunderbolt. Perhaps he was thinking\r\nof her\xe2\x80\x94suspecting her, seeing through the fastidious lady and feeling\r\nangry at her attempted deception. Or perhaps he was bored with her,\r\nperhaps he was wanting to go away. Well, let him go; she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. Or\r\nperhaps he was just made like that\xe2\x80\x94a moody young poet; that seemed, on\r\nthe whole, the most likely explanation; it was also the most pleasing\r\nand romantic. She waited. They both waited.\r\n\r\nGumbril looked at her and was put to shame by the spectacle of her\r\nquiet serenity. He must do something, he told himself; he must recover\r\nthe Complete Man\xe2\x80\x99s lost _morale_. Desperately he came to a halt in\r\nfront of the one decent picture hanging on the walls. It was an\r\neighteenth-century engraving of Raphael\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Transfiguration\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94better, he\r\nalways thought, in black and white than in its bleakly-coloured\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a nice engraving,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cVery nice.\xe2\x80\x9d The mere fact of having\r\nuttered at all was a great comfort to him, a real relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat belongs to me. I found it in a second-hand shop,\r\nnot far from here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhotography,\xe2\x80\x9d he pronounced, with that temporary earnestness which made\r\nhim seem an enthusiast about everything, \xe2\x80\x9cis a mixed blessing. It has\r\nmade it possible to reproduce pictures so easily and cheaply, that all\r\nthe bad artists who were well occupied in the past, making engravings of\r\ngood men\xe2\x80\x99s paintings, are now free to do bad original work of their\r\nown.\xe2\x80\x9d All this was terribly impersonal, he told himself, terribly off\r\nthe point. He was losing ground. He must do something drastic to win it\r\nback. But what?\r\n\r\nShe came to his rescue. \xe2\x80\x9cI bought another at the same time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The Last Communion of St. Jerome,\xe2\x80\x99 by\xe2\x80\x94who is it? I forget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you mean Domenichino\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98St. Jerome\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d The Complete Man was afloat\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cPoussin\xe2\x80\x99s favourite picture. Mine too, very nearly. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to\r\nsee that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in my room, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid. But if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed. \xe2\x80\x9cIf _you_ don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled graciously to him and got up. \xe2\x80\x9cThis way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and\r\nopened the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lovely picture,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril went on, loquaciously now, behind her,\r\nas they walked down the dark corridor. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd besides, I have a\r\nsentimental attachment to it. There used to be a copy of an engraving of\r\nit at home, when I was a child. And I remember wondering and\r\nwondering\xe2\x80\x94oh, it went on for years\xe2\x80\x94every time I saw the picture;\r\nwondering why on earth that old bishop (for I did know it was a bishop)\r\nshould be handing the naked old man a five-shilling piece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened a door; they were in her very pink room. Grave in its solemn\r\nand subtly harmonious beauty, the picture hung over the mantelpiece,\r\nhung there, among the photographs of the little friends of her own age,\r\nlike some strange object from another world. From within that chipped\r\ngilt frame all the beauty, all the grandeur of religion looked darkly\r\nout upon the pink room. The little friends of her own age, all\r\ndeliciously nubile, sweetly smiled, turned up their eyes, clasped\r\nPersian cats or stood jauntily, feet apart, hand in the breeches pocket\r\nof the land-girl\xe2\x80\x99s uniform; the pink roses on the wallpaper, the pink\r\nand white curtains, the pink bed, the strawberry-coloured carpet, filled\r\nall the air with the rosy reflections of nakedness and life.\r\n\r\nAnd utterly remote, absorbed in their grave, solemn ecstasy, the robed\r\nand mitred priest held out, the dying saint yearningly received, the\r\nbody of the Son of God. The ministrants looked gravely on, the little\r\nangels looped in the air above a gravely triumphant festoon, the lion\r\nslept at the saint\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and through the arch beyond, the eye\r\ntravelled out over a quiet country of dark trees and hills.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she waved towards the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\nBut Gumbril had taken it all in long ago. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see what I mean by the\r\nfive-shilling piece.\xe2\x80\x9d And stepping up to the picture, he pointed to the\r\nround bright wafer which the priest holds in his hand and whose averted\r\ndisk is like the essential sun at the centre of the picture\xe2\x80\x99s harmonious\r\nuniverse. \xe2\x80\x9cThose were the days of five-shilling pieces,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re probably too young to remember those large, lovely things. They\r\ncame my way occasionally, and consecrated wafers didn\xe2\x80\x99t. So you can\r\nunderstand how much the picture puzzled me. A bishop giving a naked old\r\nman five shillings in a church, with angels fluttering overhead, and a\r\nlion sleeping in the foreground. It was obscure, it was horribly\r\nobscure.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned away from the picture and confronted his hostess,\r\nwho was standing a little way behind him smiling enigmatically and\r\ninvitingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObscure,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cBut so is everything. So is life in general.\r\nAnd you,\xe2\x80\x9d he stepped towards her, \xe2\x80\x9cyou in particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I?\xe2\x80\x9d she lifted her limpid eyes at him. Oh, how her heart was\r\nbeating, how hard it was to be the fastidious lady, calmly satisfying\r\nher caprice. How difficult it was to be accustomed to this sort of\r\nthing. What was going to happen next?\r\n\r\nWhat happened next was that the Complete Man came still closer, put his\r\narms round her, as though he were inviting her to the fox-trot, and\r\nbegan kissing her with a startling violence. His beard tickled her neck;\r\nshivering a little, she brought down the magnolia petals across her\r\neyes. The Complete Man lifted her up, walked across the room carrying\r\nthe fastidious lady in his arms and deposited her on the rosy catafalque\r\nof the bed. Lying there with her eyes shut, she did her best to pretend\r\nshe was dead.\r\n\r\nGumbril had looked at his wrist watch and found that it was six o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\nAlready? He prepared himself to take his departure. Wrapped in a pink\r\nkimono, she came out into the hall to wish him farewell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen shall I see you again, Rosie?\xe2\x80\x9d He had learnt that her name was\r\nRosie.\r\n\r\nShe had recovered her great lady\xe2\x80\x99s equanimity and detachment, and was\r\nable to shrug her shoulders and smile. \xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked,\r\nimplying that she could not foresee what her caprice might be an hour\r\nhence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I write then, and ask one of these days if you do know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put her head on one side and raised her eyebrows, doubtfully. At\r\nlast nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you can write,\xe2\x80\x9d she permitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Complete Man, and picked up his wide hat. She held out\r\nher hand to him with stateliness, and with a formal gallantry he kissed\r\nit. He was just closing the front door behind him, when he remembered\r\nsomething. He turned round. \xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d he called after the retreating pink\r\nkimono. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather absurd. But how can I write? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know your\r\nname. I can\xe2\x80\x99t just address it \xe2\x80\x98Rosie\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe great lady laughed delightedly. This had the real _capriccio_\r\nflavour. \xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and she ran into the sitting-room. She was\r\nback again in a moment with an oblong of pasteboard. \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nand dropped it into his great-coat pocket. Then blowing a kiss she was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nThe Complete Man closed the door and descended the stairs. Well, well,\r\nhe said to himself; well, well. He put his hand in his coat pocket and\r\ntook out the card. In the dim light of the staircase he read the name on\r\nit with some difficulty. Mrs. James\xe2\x80\x94but no, but no. He read again,\r\nstraining his eyes; there was no question of it. Mrs. James Shearwater.\r\n\r\nMrs. James Shearwater.\r\n\r\nThat was why he had vaguely known the name of Bloxam Gardens.\r\n\r\nMrs. James Shear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. Step after step he descended, ponderously. \xe2\x80\x9cGood\r\nLord,\xe2\x80\x9d he said out loud. \xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut why had he never seen her? Why did Shearwater never produce her? Now\r\nhe came to think of it, he hardly ever spoke of her.\r\n\r\nWhy had she said the flat wasn\xe2\x80\x99t theirs? It was; he had heard Shearwater\r\ntalk about it.\r\n\r\nDid she make a habit of this sort of thing!\r\n\r\nCould Shearwater be wholly unaware of what she was really like? But, for\r\nthat matter, what _was_ she really like?\r\n\r\nHe was half-way down the last flight, when with a rattle and a squeak of\r\nhinges the door of the house, which was only separated by a short lobby\r\nfrom the foot of the stairs, opened, revealing, on the doorstep,\r\nShearwater and a friend, eagerly talking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... I take my rabbit,\xe2\x80\x9d the friend was saying\xe2\x80\x94he was a young man with\r\ndark, protruding eyes, and staring, doggy nostrils; very eager, lively\r\nand loud. \xe2\x80\x9cI take my rabbit and I inject into it the solution of eyes,\r\npulped eyes of another dead rabbit. You see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril\xe2\x80\x99s first instinct was to rush up the stairs and hide in the first\r\nlikely-looking corner. But he pulled himself together at once. He was a\r\nComplete Man, and Complete Men do not hide; moreover, he was\r\nsufficiently disguised to be quite unrecognizable. He stood where he\r\nwas, and listened to the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rabbit,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the young man, and with his bright eyes and\r\nstaring, sniffing nose, he looked like a poacher\xe2\x80\x99s terrier ready to go\r\nbarking after the first white tail that passed his way; \xe2\x80\x9cthe rabbit\r\nnaturally develops the appropriate resistance, develops a specific\r\nanti-eye to protect itself. I then take some of its anti-eye serum and\r\ninject it into my female rabbit; I then immediately breed from her.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\npaused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Shearwater, in his slow, ponderous way. He lifted his\r\ngreat round head inquiringly and looked at the doggy young man from\r\nunder his bushy eyebrows.\r\n\r\nThe doggy young man smiled triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe young ones,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nemphasizing his words by striking his right fist against the extended\r\npalm of his left hand, \xe2\x80\x9cthe young ones are born with defective sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThoughtfully Shearwater pulled at his formidable moustache. \xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cVery remarkable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou realize the full significance of it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cWe seem\r\nto be effecting the germ-plasm directly. We have found a way of making\r\nacquired characteristics....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. He had decided that it was time to be gone.\r\nHe ran down the stairs and across the tiled hall, he pushed his way\r\nfirmly but politely between the talkers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... heritable,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the young man, imperturbably eager, speaking\r\nthrough and over and round the obstacle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn!\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater. The Complete Man had trodden on his toe.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, absent-mindedly apologizing for the injury he had\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nGumbril hurried off along the street. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we really have found out a\r\ntechnique for influencing the germ-plasm directly ...\xe2\x80\x9d he heard the\r\ndoggy young man saying; but he was already too far away to catch the\r\nrest of the sentence. There are many ways, he reflected, of spending an\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nThe doggy young man refused to come in, he had to get in his game of\r\ntennis before dinner. Shearwater climbed the stairs alone. He was taking\r\noff his hat in the little hall of his own apartment, when Rosie came out\r\nof the sitting-room with a trayful of tea-things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, kissing her affectionately on the forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\r\nPeople to tea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosie replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and make you a fresh cup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe glided off, rustling in her pink kimono towards the kitchen.\r\n\r\nShearwater sat down in the sitting-room. He had brought home with him\r\nfrom the library the fifteenth volume of the _Biochemical Journal_.\r\nThere was something in it he wanted to look up. He turned over the\r\npages. Ah, here it was. He began reading. Rosie came back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s your tea,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe thanked her without looking up. The tea grew cold on the little table\r\nat his side.\r\n\r\nLying on the sofa, Rosie pondered and remembered. Had the events of the\r\nafternoon, she asked herself, really happened? They seemed very\r\nimprobable and remote, now, in this studious silence. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nfeeling a little disappointed. Was it only this? So simple and obvious?\r\nShe tried to work herself up into a more exalted mood. She even tried to\r\nfeel guilty; but there she failed completely. She tried to feel\r\nrapturous; but without much more success. Still, he certainly had been a\r\nmost extraordinary man. Such impudence, and at the same time such\r\ndelicacy and tact.\r\n\r\nIt was a pity she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to change the furniture. She saw now\r\nthat it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do at all. She would go and tell Aunt Aggie about the\r\ndreadful middle-classness of her Art and Craftiness.\r\n\r\nShe ought to have an Empire _chaise longue_. Like Madame R\xc3\xa9camier. She\r\ncould see herself lying there, dispensing tea. \xe2\x80\x9cLike a delicious pink\r\nsnake.\xe2\x80\x9d He had called her that.\r\n\r\nWell, really, now she came to think of it all again, it had been too\r\nqueer, too queer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a hedonist?\xe2\x80\x9d she suddenly asked.\r\n\r\nShearwater looked up from the _Journal of Biochemistry_. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hedonist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man who holds that the end of life is pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA \xe2\x80\x98conscientious hedonist\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94ah, that was good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis tea is cold,\xe2\x80\x9d Shearwater remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have drunk it before,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. The silence renewed and\r\nprolonged itself.\r\n\r\nRosie was getting much better, Shearwater reflected, as he washed his\r\nhands before supper, about not interrupting him when he was busy. This\r\nevening she had really not disturbed him at all, or at most only once,\r\nand that not seriously. There had been times in the past when the child\r\nhad really made life almost impossible. There were those months at the\r\nbeginning of their married life, when she had thought she would like to\r\nstudy physiology herself and be a help to him. He remembered the hours\r\nhe had spent trying to teach her elementary facts about the chromosomes.\r\nIt had been a great relief when she abandoned the attempt. He had\r\nsuggested she should go in for stencilling patterns on Government linen.\r\nSuch pretty curtains and things one could make like that. But she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntaken very kindly to the idea. There had followed a long period when she\r\nseemed to have nothing to do but prevent him from doing anything.\r\nRinging him up at the laboratory, invading his study, sitting on his\r\nknee, or throwing her arms round his neck, or pulling his hair, or\r\nasking ridiculous questions when he was trying to work.\r\n\r\nShearwater flattered himself that he had been extremely patient. He had\r\nnever got cross. He had just gone on as though she weren\xe2\x80\x99t there. As\r\nthough she weren\xe2\x80\x99t there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurry up,\xe2\x80\x9d he heard her calling. \xe2\x80\x9cThe soup\xe2\x80\x99s getting cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComing,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted back, and began to dry his large, blunt hands.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to have been improving lately. And to-night, to-night she had\r\nbeen a model of non-existence.\r\n\r\nHe came striding heavily into the dining-room. Rosie was sitting at the\r\nhead of the table, ladling out the soup. With her left hand she held\r\nback the flowing pink sleeve of her kimono so that it should not trail\r\nin the plates or the tureen. Her bare arm showed white and pearly\r\nthrough the steam of lentils.\r\n\r\nHow pretty she was! He could not resist the temptation, but coming up\r\nbehind her bent down and kissed her, rather clumsily, on the back of her\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nRosie drew away from him. \xe2\x80\x9cReally, Jim,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, disapprovingly. \xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\nmeal-times!\xe2\x80\x9d The fastidious lady had to draw the line at these\r\nill-timed, tumbling familiarities.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about work-times?\xe2\x80\x9d Shearwater asked laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cStill, you were\r\nwonderful this evening, Rosie, quite wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d He sat down and began\r\neating his soup. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a sound all the time I was reading; or, at any\r\nrate, only one sound, so far as I remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe great lady said nothing, but only smiled\xe2\x80\x94a little contemptuously and\r\nwith a touch of pity. She pushed away the plate of soup unfinished and\r\nplanted her elbows on the table. Slipping her hands under the sleeves of\r\nher kimono, she began, lightly, delicately, with the tips of her\r\nfingers, to caress her own arms.\r\n\r\nHow smooth they were, how soft and warm and how secret under the\r\nsleeves. And all her body was as smooth and warm, was as soft and\r\nsecret, still more secret beneath the pink folds. Like a warm serpent\r\nhidden away, secretly, secretly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Boldero liked the idea of the Patent Small-Clothes. He liked it\r\nimmensely, he said, immensely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s money in it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Boldero was a small dark man of about forty-five, active as a bird\r\nand with a bird\xe2\x80\x99s brown, beady eyes, a bird\xe2\x80\x99s sharp nose. He was always\r\nbusy, always had twenty different irons in the fire at once, was always\r\nfresh, clearheaded, never tired. He was also always unpunctual, always\r\nuntidy. He had no sense of time or of order. But he got away with it, as\r\nhe liked to say. He delivered the goods\xe2\x80\x94or rather the goods, in the\r\nconvenient form of cash, delivered themselves, almost miraculously it\r\nalways seemed, to him.\r\n\r\nHe was like a bird in appearance. But in mind, Gumbril found, after\r\nhaving seen him once or twice, he was like a caterpillar: he ate all\r\nthat was put before him, he consumed a hundred times his own mental\r\nweight every day. Other people\xe2\x80\x99s ideas, other people\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nwere his food. He devoured them and they were at once his own. All that\r\nbelonged to other people he annexed without a scruple or a second\r\nthought, quite naturally, as though it were already his own. And he\r\nabsorbed it so rapidly and completely, he laid public claim to it so\r\npromptly that he sometimes deceived people into believing that he had\r\nreally anticipated them in their ideas, that he had known for years and\r\nyears the things they had just been telling him, and which he would at\r\nonce airily repeat to them with the perfect assurance of one who\r\nknows\xe2\x80\x94knows by instinct, as it were, by inheritance.\r\n\r\nAt their first luncheon he had asked Gumbril to tell him all about\r\nmodern painting. Gumbril had given him a brief lecture; before the\r\nsavoury had appeared on the table, Mr. Boldero was talking with perfect\r\nfamiliarity of Picasso and Derain. He almost made it understood that he\r\nhad a fine collection of their works in his drawing-room at home. Being\r\na trifle deaf, however, he was not very good at names, and Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall-too-tactful corrections were lost on him. He could not be induced to\r\nabandon his Bacosso in favour of any other version of the Spaniard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname. Bacosso\xe2\x80\x94why, he had known all about Bacosso since he was a\r\nschoolboy! Bacosso was an old master, already.\r\n\r\nMr. Boldero was very severe with the waiters and knew so well how things\r\nought to be done at a good restaurant, that Gumbril felt sure he must\r\nrecently have lunched with some meticulous gormandizer of the old\r\nschool. And when the waiter made as though to serve them with brandy in\r\nsmall glasses, Mr. Boldero was so passionately indignant that he sent\r\nfor the manager.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted in a perfect frenzy of righteous\r\nanger, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you don\xe2\x80\x99t yet know how brandy ought to be drunk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was only last week that he himself, Gumbril reflected, had\r\nlearned to aerate his cognac in Gargantuan beakers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, of course, the Patent Small-Clothes were not neglected. As\r\nsoon as he had been told about the things, Mr. Boldero began speaking of\r\nthem with a perfect and practised familiarity. They were already his,\r\nmentally his. And it was only Mr. Boldero\xe2\x80\x99s generosity that prevented\r\nhim from making the Small-Clothes more effectively his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the friendship and respect which I feel for your\r\nfather, Mr. Gumbril,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, twinkling genially over the brandy, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d\r\njust annex your Small-Clothes. Bag and baggage. Just annex them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but they\xe2\x80\x99re my patent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cOr at least they\xe2\x80\x99re in\r\nprocess of being patented. The agents are at work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Boldero laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose that would trouble me if I wanted\r\nto be unscrupulous? I\xe2\x80\x99d just take the idea and manufacture the article.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d bring an action. I\xe2\x80\x99d have it defended with all the professional\r\nerudition that could be brought. You\xe2\x80\x99d find yourself let in for a case\r\nthat might cost thousands. And how would you pay for it? You\xe2\x80\x99d be forced\r\nto come to an agreement out of court, Mr. Gumbril. That\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave to do. And a damned bad agreement it would be for you, I can tell\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boldero laughed very cheerfully at the thought of the badness\r\nof this agreement. \xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t do it, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril was not wholly reassured. Tactfully, he tried to find out what\r\nterms Mr. Boldero was prepared to offer. Mr. Boldero was nebulously\r\nvague.\r\n\r\nThey met again in Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s rooms. The contemporary drawings on the\r\nwalls reminded Mr. Boldero that he was now an art expert. He told\r\nGumbril all about it\xe2\x80\x94in Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s own words. Every now and then, it was\r\ntrue, Mr. Boldero made a little slip. Bacosso, for example, remained\r\nunshakably Bacosso. But on the whole the performance was most\r\nimpressive. It made Gumbril feel very uncomfortable, however, while it\r\nlasted. For he recognized in this characteristic of Mr. Boldero a\r\nhorrible caricature of himself. He too was an assimilator; more\r\ndiscriminating, no doubt, more tactful, knowing better than Mr. Boldero\r\nhow to turn the assimilated experience into something new and truly his\r\nown; but still a caterpillar, definitely a caterpillar. He began\r\nstudying Mr. Boldero with a close and disgustful attention, as one might\r\npore over some repulsive _memento mori_.\r\n\r\nIt was a relief when Mr. Boldero stopped talking art and consented to\r\nget down to business. Gumbril was wearing for the occasion the sample\r\npair of Small-Clothes which Mr. Bojanus had made for him. For Mr.\r\nBoldero\xe2\x80\x99s benefit he put them, so to speak, through their paces. He\r\nallowed himself to drop with a bump on to the floor\xe2\x80\x94arriving there\r\nbruiseless and unjarred. He sat in complete comfort for minutes at a\r\nstretch on the edge of the ornamental iron fender. In the intervals he\r\nparaded up and down before Mr. Boldero like a mannequin. \xe2\x80\x9cA trifle\r\nbulgy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Boldero. \xe2\x80\x9cBut still....\xe2\x80\x9d He was, taking it all round,\r\nfavourably impressed. It was time, he said, to begin thinking of\r\ndetails. They would have to begin by making experiments with the\r\nbladders to discover a model combining, as Mr. Boldero put it, \xe2\x80\x98maximum\r\nefficiency with minimum bulge.\xe2\x80\x99 When they had found the right thing,\r\nthey would have it made in suitable quantities by any good rubber firm.\r\nAs for the trousers themselves, they could rely for those on sweated\r\nfemale labour in the East End. \xe2\x80\x9cCheap and good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Boldero.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds ideal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Boldero, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s our advertising campaign. On that\r\nI may say,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on with a certain solemnity, \xe2\x80\x9cwill depend the\r\nfailure or success of our enterprise. I consider it of the first\r\nimportance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, nodding importantly and with intelligence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must set to work,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Boldero, \xe2\x80\x9csci\xe2\x80\x94en\xe2\x80\x94tifically.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril\r\nnodded again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have to appeal,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boldero went on so glibly that Gumbril felt\r\nsure he must be quoting somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cto the great instincts\r\nand feelings of humanity.... They are the sources of action. They spend\r\nthe money, if I may put it like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cBut how do you propose to appeal\r\nto the most important of the instincts? I refer, as you may well\r\nimagine, to sex.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just going to come to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Boldero, raising his hand\r\nas though to ask for a patient hearing. \xe2\x80\x9cAlas! we can\xe2\x80\x99t. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any\r\nway of hanging our Small-Clothes on the sexual peg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we are undone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, too dramatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boldero was reassuring. \xe2\x80\x9cYou make the error of the\r\nViennese. You exaggerate the importance of sex. After all, my dear Mr.\r\nGumbril, there is also the instinct of self-preservation; there is\r\nalso,\xe2\x80\x9d he leaned forward, wagging his finger, \xe2\x80\x9cthe social instinct, the\r\ninstinct of the herd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth of them as powerful as sex. What are the Professor\xe2\x80\x99s famous\r\nCensors but forbidding suggestions from the herd without, made powerful\r\nand entrenched by the social instinct within?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril had no answer; Mr. Boldero continued, smiling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that we shall be all right if we stick to self-preservation and the\r\nherd. Rub in the comfort and the utility, the hygienic virtues of our\r\nSmall-Clothes; that will catch their self-preservatory feelings. Aim at\r\ntheir dread of public opinion, at their ambition to be one better than\r\ntheir fellows and their terror of being different\xe2\x80\x94at all the ludicrous\r\nweaknesses a well-developed social instinct exposes them to. We shall\r\nget them, if we set to work scientifically.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boldero\xe2\x80\x99s bird-like\r\neyes twinkled very brightly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall get them,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, and he\r\nlaughed a happy little laugh, full of such a childlike diabolism, such\r\nan innocent gay malignity that it seemed as though a little leprechaun\r\nhad suddenly taken the financier\xe2\x80\x99s place in Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s best arm-chair.\r\n\r\nGumbril laughed too; for this leprechaunish mirth was infectious. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nshall get them,\xe2\x80\x9d he echoed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we shall, if you set about it,\r\nMr. Boldero.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Boldero acknowledged the compliment with a smile that expressed no\r\nfalse humility. It was his due, and he knew it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you some of my ideas about the advertising campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cJust to give you a notion. You can think them over, quietly, and\r\nmake suggestions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, nodding.\r\n\r\nMr. Boldero cleared his throat. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall begin,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cby\r\nmaking the most simple elementary appeal to their instinct of\r\nself-preservation: we shall point out that the Patent Small-Clothes\r\nare comfortable; that to wear them is to avoid pain. A few striking\r\nslogans about comfort\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all we want. Very simple indeed. It\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t take much to persuade a man that it\xe2\x80\x99s pleasanter to sit on\r\nair than on wood. But while we\xe2\x80\x99re on the subject of hard seats we\r\nshall have to glide off subtly at a tangent to make a flank attack\r\non the social instincts.\xe2\x80\x9d And joining the tip of his forefinger to\r\nthe tip of his thumb, Mr. Boldero moved his hand delicately\r\nsideways, as though he were sliding it along a smooth brass rail.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have to speak about the glories and the trials of\r\nsedentary labour. We must exalt its spiritual dignity and at the\r\nsame time condemn its physical discomforts. \xe2\x80\x98The seat of honour,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you know. We could talk about that. \xe2\x80\x98The Seats of the Mighty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The seat that rules the office rocks the world.\xe2\x80\x99 All those lines\r\nmight be made something of. And then we could have little historical\r\nchats about thrones; how dignified, but how uncomfortable they\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen. We must make the bank clerk and the civil servant feel proud\r\nof being what they are and at the same time feel ashamed that, being\r\nsuch splendid people, they should have to submit to the indignity of\r\nhaving blistered hind-quarters. In modern advertising you must\r\nflatter your public\xe2\x80\x94not in the oily, abject, tradesmanlike style of\r\nthe old advertisers, crawling before clients who were their social\r\nsuperiors; that\xe2\x80\x99s all over now. It\xe2\x80\x99s we who are the social\r\nsuperiors\xe2\x80\x94because we\xe2\x80\x99ve got more money than the bank clerks and the\r\ncivil servants. Our modern flattery must be manly, straightforward,\r\nsincere, the admiration of equal for equal\xe2\x80\x94all the more flattering\r\nas we aren\xe2\x80\x99t equals.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boldero laid a finger to his nose.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re dirt and we\xe2\x80\x99re capitalists....\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed.\r\n\r\nGumbril laughed too. It was the first time that he had ever thought of\r\nhimself as a capitalist, and the thought was exhilarating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe flatter them,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Mr. Boldero. \xe2\x80\x9cWe say that honest work is\r\nglorious and ennobling\xe2\x80\x94which it isn\xe2\x80\x99t; it\xe2\x80\x99s merely dull and cretinizing.\r\nAnd then we go on to suggest that it would be finer still, more\r\nennobling, because less uncomfortable, if they wore Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s Patent\r\nSmall-Clothes. You see the line?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril saw the line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Boldero, \xe2\x80\x9cwe get on to the medical side of the\r\nmatter. The medical side, Mr. Gumbril\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s most important. Nobody\r\nfeels really well nowadays\xe2\x80\x94at any rate, nobody who lives in a big town\r\nand does the kind of loathsome work that the people we\xe2\x80\x99re catering for\r\ndoes. Keeping this fact before our eyes, we have to make it clear that\r\nonly those can expect to be healthy who wear pneumatic trousers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be a little difficult, won\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d questioned Gumbril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boldero laughed with an infectious confidence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll we have to do is to talk about the great nerve centres of the\r\nspine: the shocks they get when you sit down too hard; the wearing\r\nexhaustion to which long-protracted sitting on unpadded seats subjects\r\nthem. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to talk very scientifically about the great lumbar\r\nganglia\xe2\x80\x94if there are such things, which I really don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll even talk almost mystically about the ganglia. You know that sort\r\nof ganglion philosophy?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boldero went on parenthetically. \xe2\x80\x9cVery\r\ninteresting it is, sometimes, I think. We could put in a lot about the\r\ndark, powerful sense-life, sex-life, instinct-life which is controlled\r\nby the lumbar ganglion. How important it is that that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ndamaged. That already our modern conditions of civilization tend unduly\r\nto develop the intellect and the thoracic ganglia controlling the higher\r\nemotions. That we\xe2\x80\x99re wearing out, growing feeble, losing our balance in\r\nconsequence. And that the only cure\xe2\x80\x94if we are to continue our present\r\nmode of civilized life\xe2\x80\x94is to be found in Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s Patent\r\nSmall-Clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boldero brought his hand with an emphatic smack on\r\nto the table as he spoke, as he fairly shouted, these last words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagnificent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, with genuine admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis sort of medical and philosophical dope,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boldero went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nalways very effective, if it\xe2\x80\x99s properly used. The public to whom we are\r\nmaking our appeal is, of course, almost absolutely ignorant on these,\r\nor, indeed, on almost all other subjects. It is therefore very much\r\nimpressed by the unfamiliar words; particularly if they have such a good\r\njuicy sound as the word \xe2\x80\x98ganglia.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a young man of East Anglia, whose loins were a tangle of\r\nganglia,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Gumbril, _improvisatore_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Boldero. \xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely. You see how juicy it is?\r\nWell, as I say, they\xe2\x80\x99re impressed. And they\xe2\x80\x99re also grateful. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngrateful to us for having given them a piece of abstruse, unlikely\r\ninformation which they can pass on to their wives, or to such friends as\r\nthey know don\xe2\x80\x99t read the paper in which our advertisement appears\xe2\x80\x94can\r\npass on airily, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, with easy erudition, as though they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nknown all about ganglia from their childhood. And they\xe2\x80\x99ll feel such a\r\nflow of superiority as they hand on the metaphysics and the pathology,\r\nthat they\xe2\x80\x99ll always think of us with affection. They\xe2\x80\x99ll buy our breeks\r\nand they\xe2\x80\x99ll get other people to buy. That\xe2\x80\x99s why,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boldero went off\r\nagain on an instructive tangent, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s why the day of secret patent\r\nmedicines is really over. It\xe2\x80\x99s no good saying you have rediscovered some\r\nsecret known only, in the past, to the Egyptians. People don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nanything about Egyptology; but they have an inkling that such a science\r\nexists. And that if it does exist, it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that patent medicine\r\nmakers should have found out facts unknown to the professors at the\r\nuniversities. And it\xe2\x80\x99s much the same even with secrets that don\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nfrom Egypt. People know there\xe2\x80\x99s such a thing as medical science and they\r\nagain feel it\xe2\x80\x99s improbable that manufacturers should know things ignored\r\nby the doctors. The modern democratic advertiser is entirely\r\nabove-board. He tells you all about it. He explains that the digestive\r\njuices acting on bismuth give rise to a disinfectant acid. He points out\r\nthat lactic ferment gets destroyed before it reaches the large\r\nintestine, so that Metchnikoff\xe2\x80\x99s cure generally won\xe2\x80\x99t work. And he goes\r\non to explain that the only way of getting the ferment there is to mix\r\nit with starch and paraffin: starch to feed the ferment on, paraffin to\r\nprevent the starch being digested before it gets to the intestine. And\r\nin consequence, he convinces you that a mixture of starch, paraffin and\r\nferment is the only thing that\xe2\x80\x99s any good at all. Consequently you buy\r\nit; which you would never have done without the explanation. In the same\r\nway, Mr. Gumbril, we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t ask people to take our trousers on trust.\r\nWe must explain scientifically why these trousers will be good for their\r\nhealth. And by means of the ganglia, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve pointed out, we can even\r\nshow that the trousers will be good for their souls and the whole human\r\nrace at large. And as you probably know, Mr. Gumbril, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nlike a spiritual message to make things go. Combine spirituality with\r\npracticality and you\xe2\x80\x99ve fairly got them. Got them, I may say, on toast.\r\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s what we can do with our trousers; we can put a message into\r\nthem, a big, spiritual message. Decidedly,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall have\r\nto work those ganglia all we can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll undertake to do that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, who felt very buoyant and\r\nself-assured. Mr. Boldero\xe2\x80\x99s hydrogenous conversation had blown him up\r\nlike a balloon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll do it well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Boldero encouragingly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nis no better training for modern commerce than a literary education. As\r\na practical business man, I always uphold the ancient universities,\r\nespecially in their teaching of the Humanities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril was much flattered. At the moment, it seemed supremely\r\nsatisfying to be told that he was likely to make a good business man.\r\nThe business man took on a radiance, began to glow, as it were, with a\r\nphosphorescent splendour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s very important,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Boldero, \xe2\x80\x9cto play on their\r\nsnobbism; to exploit that painful sense of inferiority which the\r\nignorant and ingenuous always feel in the presence of the knowing. We\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot to make our trousers the Thing\xe2\x80\x94socially right as well as merely\r\npersonally comfortable. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to imply somehow that it\xe2\x80\x99s bad form\r\nnot to wear them. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make those who don\xe2\x80\x99t wear them feel\r\nrather uncomfortable. Like that film of Charlie Chaplin\xe2\x80\x99s, where he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe absent-minded young man about town who dresses for dinner\r\nimmaculately, from the waist up\xe2\x80\x94white waistcoat, tail coat, stiff shirt,\r\ntop-hat\xe2\x80\x94and only discovers, when he gets down into the hall of the\r\nhotel, that he\xe2\x80\x99s forgotten to put on his trousers. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make\r\nthem feel like that. That\xe2\x80\x99s always very successful. You know those\r\nexcellent American advertisements about young ladies whose engagements\r\nare broken off because they perspire too freely or have an unpleasant\r\nbreath? How horribly uncomfortable those make you feel! We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do\r\nsomething of the same sort for our trousers. Or more immediately\r\napplicable would be those tailor\xe2\x80\x99s advertisements about correct clothes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good clothes make you feel good.\xe2\x80\x99 You know the sort of line. And then\r\nthose grave warning sentences in which you\xe2\x80\x99re told that a correctly cut\r\nsuit may make the difference between an appointment gained and an\r\nappointment lost, an interview granted and an interview refused. But the\r\nmost masterly examples I can think of,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boldero went on with growing\r\nenthusiasm, \xe2\x80\x9care those American advertisements of spectacles, in which\r\nthe manufacturers first assume the existence of a social law about\r\ngoggles, and then proceed to invoke all the sanctions which fall on the\r\nhead of the committer of a solecism upon those who break it. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmasterly. For sport or relaxation, they tell you, as though it was a\r\nsocial axiom, you must wear spectacles of pure tortoiseshell. For\r\nbusiness, tortoiseshell rims and nickel ear-pieces lend incisive\r\npoise\xe2\x80\x94incisive poise, we must remember that for our ads, Mr. Gumbril.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s Patent Small-Clothes lend incisive poise to business men.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nFor semi-evening dress, shell rims with gold ear-pieces and gold\r\nnose-bridge. And for full dress, gold-mounted rimless pince-nez are\r\nrefinement itself, and absolutely correct. Thus we see, a social law has\r\nbeen created, according to which every self-respecting myope or astigmat\r\nmust have four distinct pairs of glasses. Think if he should wear the\r\nall-shell sports model with full dress! Revolting solecism! The people\r\nwho read advertisements like that begin to feel uncomfortable; they have\r\nonly one pair of glasses, they are afraid of being laughed at, thought\r\nlow-class and ignorant and suburban. And since there are few who would\r\nnot rather be taken in adultery than in provincialism, they rush out to\r\nbuy four new pairs of spectacles. And the manufacturer gets rich, Mr.\r\nGumbril. Now, we must do something of the kind with our trousers. Imply\r\nsomehow that they\xe2\x80\x99re correct, that you\xe2\x80\x99re undressed without, that you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nfianc\xc3\xa9e would break off the engagement if she saw you sitting down to\r\ndinner on anything but air.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boldero shrugged his shoulders, vaguely\r\nwaved his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be rather difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boldero agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut difficulties are made to be overcome.\r\nWe must pull the string of snobbery and shame: it\xe2\x80\x99s essential. We must\r\nfind out methods for bringing the weight of public opinion to bear\r\nmockingly on those who do not wear our trousers. It is difficult at the\r\nmoment to see how it can be done. But it will have to be done, it will\r\nhave to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boldero repeated emphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cWe might even find\r\na way of invoking patriotism to our aid. \xe2\x80\x98English trousers filled with\r\nEnglish air, for English men.\xe2\x80\x99 A little far-fetched, perhaps. But there\r\nmight be something in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril shook his head doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the things we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to think about in any case,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Boldero. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to neglect such powerful social\r\nemotions as these. Sex, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, is almost entirely out of the\r\nquestion. We must run the rest, therefore, as hard as we can. For\r\ninstance, there\xe2\x80\x99s the novelty business. People feel superior if they\r\npossess something new which their neighbours haven\xe2\x80\x99t got. The mere fact\r\nof newness is an intoxication. We must encourage that sense of\r\nsuperiority, brew up that intoxication. The most absurd and futile\r\nobjects can be sold because they\xe2\x80\x99re new. Not long ago I sold four\r\nmillion patent soap-dishes of a new and peculiar kind. The point was\r\nthat you didn\xe2\x80\x99t screw the fixture into the bathroom wall; you made a\r\nhole in the wall and built the soap-dish into a niche, like a holy water\r\nstoup. My soap-dishes possessed no advantages over other kinds of\r\nsoap-dishes, and they cost a fantastic amount to instal. But I managed\r\nto put them across, simply because they were new. Four million of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMr. Boldero smiled with satisfaction at the recollection. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall do\r\nthe same, I hope, with our trousers. People may be shy of being the\r\nfirst to appear in them; but the shyness will be compensated for by the\r\nsense of superiority and elation produced by the consciousness of the\r\nnewness of the things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s the economy slogan. \xe2\x80\x98One pair of Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nPatent Small-Clothes will outlast six pairs of ordinary trousers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough. So easy that it\xe2\x80\x99s really uninteresting.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boldero\r\nwaved it away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have to have pictures,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, parenthetically. He had\r\nan idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I know of the very man to do them,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril went on. \xe2\x80\x9cHis\r\nname\xe2\x80\x99s Lypiatt. A painter. You\xe2\x80\x99ve probably heard of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeard of him!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Boldero. He laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t heard\r\nof Lydgate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLypiatt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLypgate, I mean, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99d be the very man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m certain he would,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Boldero, not a whit behind-hand.\r\n\r\nGumbril was pleased with himself. He felt he had done some one a good\r\nturn. Poor old Lypiatt; be glad of the money. Gumbril remembered also\r\nhis own fiver. And remembering his own fiver, he also remembered that\r\nMr. Boldero had as yet made no concrete suggestion about terms. He\r\nnerved himself at last to suggest to Mr. Boldero that it was time to\r\nthink of this little matter. Ah, how he hated talking about money! He\r\nfound it so hard to be firm in asserting his rights. He was ashamed of\r\nshowing himself grasping. He always thought with consideration of the\r\nother person\xe2\x80\x99s point of view\xe2\x80\x94poor devil, could he afford to pay? And he\r\nwas always swindled and always conscious of the fact. Lord, how he hated\r\nlife on these occasions! Mr. Boldero was still evasive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll write you a letter about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last.\r\n\r\nGumbril was delighted. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said enthusiastically, \xe2\x80\x9cdo.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nknew how to cope with letters all right. He was a devil with the\r\nfountain pen. It was these personal, hand-to-hand combats that he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t manage. He could have been, he always felt, such a ruthless\r\ncritic and satirist, such a violent, unscrupulous polemical writer. And\r\nif ever he committed his autobiography to paper, how breath-takingly\r\nintimate, how naked\xe2\x80\x94naked without so much as a healthy sunburn to colour\r\nthe whiteness\xe2\x80\x94how quiveringly a sensitive jelly it would be! All the\r\nthings he had never told any one would be in it. Confession at long\r\nrange\xe2\x80\x94if anything, it would be rather agreeable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, do write me a letter,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cDo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Boldero\xe2\x80\x99s letter came at last, and the proposals it contained were\r\nderisory. A hundred pounds down and five pounds a week when the business\r\nshould be started. Five pounds a week\xe2\x80\x94and for that he was to act as a\r\nmanaging director, writer of advertisements and promoter of foreign\r\nsales. Gumbril felt thankful that Mr. Boldero had put the terms in a\r\nletter. If they had been offered point-blank across the luncheon table,\r\nhe would probably have accepted them without a murmur. He wrote a few\r\nneat, sharp phrases saying that he could not consider less than five\r\nhundred pounds down and a thousand a year. Mr. Boldero\xe2\x80\x99s reply was\r\namiable; would Mr. Gumbril come and see him?\r\n\r\nSee him? Well, of course, it was inevitable. He would have to see him\r\nagain some time. But he would send the Complete Man to deal with the\r\nfellow. A Complete Man matched with a leprechaun\xe2\x80\x94there could be no doubt\r\nas to the issue.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MR. BOLDERO,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote back, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have come to talk over\r\n  matters before this. But I have been engaged during the last days in\r\n  growing a beard and until this has come to maturity, I cannot, as\r\n  you will easily be able to understand, leave the house. By the day\r\n  after to-morrow, however, I hope to be completely presentable and\r\n  shall come to see you at your office at about three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, if that\r\n  is convenient to you. I hope we shall be able to arrange matters\r\n  satisfactorily.\xe2\x80\x94Believe me, dear Mr. Boldero, yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                                THEODORE GUMBRIL, JR.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe day after to-morrow became in due course to-day; splendidly bearded\r\nand Rabelaisianly broad in his whipcord toga, Gumbril presented himself\r\nat Mr. Boldero\xe2\x80\x99s office in Queen Victoria Street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should hardly have recognized you,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Boldero as he shook\r\nhands. \xe2\x80\x9cHow it does alter you, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it?\xe2\x80\x9d The Complete Man laughed with a significant joviality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you take off your coat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the leprechaun, leaning back in his chair and twinkling,\r\nbird-like, across the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Gumbril on a different tone from behind the stooks of\r\nhis corn-like beard. He smiled, feeling serenely strong and safe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry we should have disagreed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Boldero.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d the Complete Man replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we shan\xe2\x80\x99t disagree for long,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added, with significance; and as he spoke the words he brought down\r\nhis fist with such a bang, that the inkpots on Mr. Boldero\xe2\x80\x99s very solid\r\nmahogany writing-table trembled and the pens danced, while Mr. Boldero\r\nhimself started with a genuine alarm. He had not expected them. And now\r\nhe came to look at him more closely, this young Gumbril was a great,\r\nhulking, dangerous-looking fellow. He had thought he would be easy to\r\nmanage. How could he have made such a mistake?\r\n\r\nGumbril left the office with Mr. Boldero\xe2\x80\x99s cheque for three hundred and\r\nfifty pounds in his pocket and an annual income of eight hundred. His\r\nbruised right hand was extremely tender to the touch. He was thankful\r\nthat a single blow had been enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nGumbril had spent the afternoon at Bloxam Gardens. His chin was still\r\nsore from the spirit gum with which he had attached to it the symbol of\r\nthe Complete Man; he was feeling also a little fatigued. Rosie had been\r\ndelighted to see him; St. Jerome had gone on solemnly communicating all\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nHis father had gone out to dine, and Gumbril had eaten his rump steak\r\nand drunk his bottle of stout alone. He was sitting now in front of the\r\nopen French windows which led from his father\xe2\x80\x99s workroom on to the\r\nbalcony, with a block on his knee and a fountain-pen in his hand,\r\ncomposing advertisements for the Patent Small-Clothes. Outside, in the\r\nplane trees of the square, the birds had gone through their nightly\r\nperformance. But Gumbril had paid no attention to them. He sat there,\r\nsmoking, sometimes writing a word or two\xe2\x80\x94sunk in the quagmire of his own\r\ndrowsy and comfortable body. The flawless weather of the day had\r\ndarkened into a blue May evening. It was agreeable merely to be alive.\r\n\r\nHe sketched out two or three advertisements in the grand idealistic\r\ntransatlantic style. He imagined one in particular with a picture of\r\nNelson at the head of the page and \xe2\x80\x98England expects ...\xe2\x80\x99 printed large\r\nbeneath it. \xe2\x80\x9cEngland ... Duty ... these are solemn words.\xe2\x80\x9d That was how\r\nit would begin. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are solemn words, and we use them solemnly as men\r\nwho realize what Duty is, and who do all that in them lies to perform it\r\nas Englishmen should. The Manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s is a sacred trust. The guide\r\nand ruler of the modern world, he has, like the Monarch of other days,\r\nresponsibilities towards his people; he has a Duty to fulfil. He rules,\r\nbut he must also serve. We realize our responsibilities, we take them\r\nseriously. Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s Patent Small-Clothes have been brought into the\r\nworld that they may serve. Our Duty towards you is a Duty of Service.\r\nOur proud boast is that we perform it. But besides his Duty towards\r\nOthers, every man has a duty towards Himself. What is that Duty? It is\r\nto keep himself in the highest possible state of physical and spiritual\r\nfitness. Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s Patent Small-Clothes protect the lumbar ganglia....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAfter that it would be plain medical and mystical sailing.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he got to the ganglia, Gumbril stopped writing. He put down\r\nthe block, sheathed his pen, and abandoned himself to the pleasures of\r\npure idleness. He sat, he smoked his cigar. In the basement, two floors\r\ndown, the cook and the house-parlourmaid were reading\xe2\x80\x94one the _Daily\r\nMirror_, the other the _Daily Sketch_. For them, Her Majesty the Queen\r\nspoke kindly words to crippled female orphans; the jockeys tumbled at\r\nthe jumps; Cupid was busy in Society, and the murderers who had\r\ndisembowelled their mistresses were at large. Above him was the city of\r\nmodels, was a bedroom, a servant\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom, an attic of tanks and\r\nancient dirt, the roof and, after that, two or three hundred light-years\r\naway, a star of the fourth magnitude. On the other side of the\r\nparty-wall on his right, a teeming family of Jews led their dark,\r\ncompact, Jewish lives with a prodigious intensity. At this moment they\r\nwere all passionately quarrelling. Beyond the wall on the left lived the\r\nyoung journalist and his wife. To-night it was he who had cooked the\r\nsupper. The young wife lay on the sofa, feeling horribly sick; she was\r\ngoing to have a baby, there could be no doubt about it now. They had\r\nmeant not to have one; it was horrible. And, outside, the birds were\r\nsleeping in the trees, the invading children from the slum tumbled and\r\nsquealed. Ships meanwhile were walloping across the Atlantic freighted\r\nwith more cigars. Rosie at this moment was probably mending Shearwater\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsocks. Gumbril sat and smoked, and the universe arranged itself in a\r\npattern about him, like iron filings round a magnet.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and the house-parlourmaid intruded Shearwater upon his\r\nlazy felicity, abruptly, in her unceremonious old way, and hurried back\r\nto the _Daily Sketch_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShearwater! This is very agreeable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe pointed to a chair.\r\n\r\nClumsily, filling the space that two ordinary men would occupy,\r\nShearwater came zigzagging and lurching across the room, bumped against\r\nthe work-table and the sofa as he passed, and finally sat down in the\r\nindicated chair.\r\n\r\nIt suddenly occurred to Gumbril that this was Rosie\xe2\x80\x99s husband: he had\r\nnot thought of that before. Could it be in the marital capacity that he\r\npresented himself so unexpectedly now? After this afternoon.... He had\r\ncome home; Rosie had confessed all.... Ah! but then she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know who\r\nhe was. He smiled to himself at the thought. What a joke! Perhaps\r\nShearwater had come to complain to him of the unknown Complete Man\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nhim! It was delightful. Anon\xe2\x80\x94the author of all those ballads in the\r\n_Oxford Book of English Verse_: the famous Italian painter\xe2\x80\x94Ignoto.\r\nGumbril was quite disappointed when his visitor began to talk of other\r\nthemes than Rosie. Sunk in the quagmire of his own comfortable guts, he\r\nfelt good-humouredly obscene. The dramatic scabrousness of the situation\r\nwould have charmed him in his present mood. Good old Shearwater\xe2\x80\x94but what\r\nan ox of a man! If he, Gumbril, took the trouble to marry a wife, he\r\nwould at least take some interest in her.\r\n\r\nShearwater had begun to talk in general terms about life. What could he\r\nbe getting at, Gumbril wondered? What particulars were ambushed behind\r\nthese generalizations? There were silences. Shearwater looked, he\r\nthought, very gloomy. Under his thick moustache the small, pouting,\r\nbabyish mouth did not smile. The candid eyes had a puzzled, tired\r\nexpression in them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople are queer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said after one of his silences. \xe2\x80\x9cVery queer. One\r\nhas no idea how queer they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have a very clear idea of their queerness,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery one\xe2\x80\x99s queer, and the ordinary, respectable, bourgeois\r\npeople are the queerest of the lot. How do they manage to live like\r\nthat? It\xe2\x80\x99s astonishing. When I think of all my aunts and uncles....\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s because I\xe2\x80\x99m rather incurious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater. \xe2\x80\x9cOne ought\r\nto be curious, I think. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to feel lately that I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been\r\ncurious enough about people.\xe2\x80\x9d The particulars began to peep, alive and\r\nindividual, out of the vagueness, like rabbits; Gumbril saw them in his\r\nfancy, at the fringe of a wood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite,\xe2\x80\x9d he said encouragingly. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think too much of my work,\xe2\x80\x9d Shearwater went on, frowning. \xe2\x80\x9cToo much\r\nphysiology. There\xe2\x80\x99s also psychology. People\xe2\x80\x99s minds as well as their\r\nbodies.... One shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be limited. Not too much, at any rate. People\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nminds....\xe2\x80\x9d He was silent for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI can imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on at\r\nlast, as in the tone of one who puts a very hypothetical case, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\r\nimagine one\xe2\x80\x99s getting so much absorbed in somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s psychology\r\nthat one could really think of nothing else.\xe2\x80\x9d The rabbits seemed ready\r\nto come out into the open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a process,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, with middle-aged jocularity, speaking\r\nout of his private warm morass, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s commonly called falling in\r\nlove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another silence. Shearwater broke it to begin talking about\r\nMrs. Viveash. He had lunched with her three or four days running. He\r\nwanted Gumbril to tell him what she was really like. \xe2\x80\x9cShe seems to me a\r\nvery extraordinary woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike everybody else,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril irritatingly. It amused him to see\r\nthe rabbits scampering about at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never known a woman like that before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d say that of any woman you happened to be\r\ninterested in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve never known any women at all.\xe2\x80\x9d He knew\r\nmuch more about Rosie, already, than Shearwater did, or probably ever\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nShearwater meditated. He thought of Mrs. Viveash, her cool, pale,\r\ncritical eyes; her laughter, faint and mocking; her words that pierced\r\ninto the mind, goading it into thinking unprecedented thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe interests me,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to tell me what she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreally like.\xe2\x80\x9d He emphasized the word really, as though there must, in\r\nthe nature of things, be a vast difference between the apparent and the\r\nreal Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\nMost lovers, Gumbril reflected, picture to themselves, in their\r\nmistresses, a secret reality, beyond and different from what they see\r\nevery day. They are in love with somebody else\xe2\x80\x94their own invention. And\r\nsometimes there is a secret reality; and sometimes reality and\r\nappearance are the same. The discovery, in either case, is likely to\r\ncause a shock. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know? You must\r\nfind out for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you knew her, you know her well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater, almost with\r\nanxiety in his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so well as all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShearwater sighed profoundly, like a whale in the night. He felt\r\nrestless, incapable of concentrating. His mind was full of a horrible\r\nconfusion. A violent eruptive bubbling up from below had shaken its calm\r\nclarity to pieces. All this absurd business of passion\xe2\x80\x94he had always\r\nthought it nonsense, unnecessary. With a little strength of will one\r\ncould shut it out. Women\xe2\x80\x94only for half an hour out of the twenty-four.\r\nBut she had laughed, and his quiet, his security had vanished. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\r\nimagine,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said to her yesterday, \xe2\x80\x9cI can imagine myself giving up\r\neverything, work and all, to go running round after you.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you\r\nsuppose I should enjoy that?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash had asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be\r\nridiculous,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be almost shameful.\xe2\x80\x9d And she had thanked\r\nhim for the compliment. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd at the same time,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel that\r\nit might be worth it. It might be the only thing.\xe2\x80\x9d His mind was\r\nconfused, full of new thoughts. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d he said after a pause,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9carranging things. Very difficult. I thought I had arranged them so\r\nwell....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never arrange anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, very much the practical\r\nphilosopher. \xe2\x80\x9cI take things as they come.\xe2\x80\x9d And as he spoke the words,\r\nsuddenly he became rather disgusted with himself. He shook himself; he\r\nclimbed up out of his own morass. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be better, perhaps, if I\r\narranged things more,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRender therefore unto C\xc3\xa6sar the things which are C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nShearwater, as though to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cand to God, and to sex, and to\r\nwork.... There must be a working arrangement.\xe2\x80\x9d He sighed again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything in proportion. In proportion,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, as though the\r\nword were magical and had power. \xe2\x80\x9cIn proportion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s talking about proportion?\xe2\x80\x9d They turned round. In the doorway\r\nGumbril Senior was standing, smoothing his ruffled hair and tugging at\r\nhis beard. His eyes twinkled cheerfully behind his spectacles. \xe2\x80\x9cPoaching\r\non my architectural ground?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Shearwater,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Junior put in, and explained who he was.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman sat down. \xe2\x80\x9cProportion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI was just thinking\r\nabout it, now, as I was walking back. You can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking about it\r\nin these London streets, where it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist. You can\xe2\x80\x99t help pining\r\nfor it. There are some streets ... oh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d And Gumbril Senior threw\r\nup his hands in horror. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like listening to a symphony of cats to\r\nwalk along them. Senseless discords and a horrible disorder all the way.\r\nAnd the one street that was really like a symphony by Mozart\xe2\x80\x94how busily\r\nand gleefully they\xe2\x80\x99re pulling it down now! Another year and there\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nnothing left of Regent Street. There\xe2\x80\x99ll only be a jumble of huge,\r\nhideous buildings at three-quarters of a million apiece. A concert of\r\nBrobdingnagian cats. Order has been turned into a disgusting chaos. We\r\nneed no barbarians from outside; they\xe2\x80\x99re on the premises, all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man paused and pulled his beard meditatively. Gumbril Junior sat\r\nin silence, smoking; and in silence Shearwater revolved within the walls\r\nof his great round head his agonizing thoughts of Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has always struck me as very curious,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Senior went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\npeople are so little affected by the vile and discordant architecture\r\naround them. Suppose, now, that all these brass bands of unemployed\r\nex-soldiers that blow so mournfully at all the street corners were\r\nsuddenly to play nothing but a series of senseless and devilish\r\ndiscords\xe2\x80\x94why, the first policeman would move them on, and the second\r\nwould put them under arrest, and the passers-by would try to lynch them\r\non their way to the police station. There would be a real spontaneous\r\noutcry of indignation. But when at these same street corners the\r\ncontractors run up enormous palaces of steel and stone that are every\r\nbit as stupid and ignoble and inharmonious as ten brass bandsmen each\r\nplaying a different tune in a different key, there is no outcry. The\r\npolice don\xe2\x80\x99t arrest the architect; the passing pedestrians don\xe2\x80\x99t throw\r\nstones at the workmen. They don\xe2\x80\x99t notice that anything\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nodd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril Senior. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very odd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery odd,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Junior echoed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Senior went on, smiling with a certain\r\nair of personal triumph, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact is that architecture is a more\r\ndifficult and intellectual art than music. Music\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s just a faculty\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re born with, as you might be born with a snub nose. But the sense\r\nof plastic beauty\xe2\x80\x94though that\xe2\x80\x99s, of course, also an inborn faculty\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nsomething that has to be developed and intellectually ripened. It\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\naffair of the mind; experience and thought have to draw it out. There\r\nare infant prodigies in music; but there are no infant prodigies in\r\narchitecture.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Senior chuckled with a real satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cA man\r\ncan be an excellent musician and a perfect imbecile. But a good\r\narchitect must also be a man of sense, a man who knows how to think and\r\nto profit by experience. Now, as almost none of the people who pass\r\nalong the streets in London, or any other city of the world, do know how\r\nto think or to profit by experience, it follows that they cannot\r\nappreciate architecture. The innate faculty is strong enough in them to\r\nmake them dislike discord in music; but they haven\xe2\x80\x99t the wits to develop\r\nthat other innate faculty\xe2\x80\x94the sense of plastic beauty\xe2\x80\x94which would enable\r\nthem to see and disapprove of the same barbarism in architecture. Come\r\nwith me,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Senior added, getting up from his chair, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nshow you something that will illustrate what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying. Something\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll enjoy, too. Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s seen it yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said mysteriously as he led\r\nthe way upstairs. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only just finished\xe2\x80\x94after months and years. It\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncause a stir when they see it\xe2\x80\x94when I let them see it, if ever I do, that\r\nis. The dirty devils!\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Senior added good-humouredly.\r\n\r\nOn the landing of the next floor he paused, felt in his pocket, took out\r\na key and unlocked the door of what should have been the second best\r\nbedroom. Gumbril Junior wondered, without very much curiosity, what the\r\nnew toy would turn out to be. Shearwater wondered only how he could\r\npossess Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\xe2\x80\x9d called Gumbril Senior from inside the room. He turned on the\r\nlight. They entered.\r\n\r\nIt was a big room; but almost the whole of the floor was covered by an\r\nenormous model, twenty feet long by ten or twelve wide, of a complete\r\ncity traversed from end to end by a winding river and dominated at its\r\ncentral point by a great dome. Gumbril Junior looked at it with surprise\r\nand pleasure. Even Shearwater was roused from his bitter ruminations of\r\ndesire to look at the charming city spread out at his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s exquisite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril Junior. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? The capital of\r\nUtopia, or what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDelighted, Gumbril Senior laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see something rather\r\nfamiliar in the dome?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I had thought ...\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Junior hesitated, afraid that he might\r\nbe going to say something stupid. He bent down to look more closely at\r\nthe dome. \xe2\x80\x9cI had thought it looked rather like St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and now I see\r\nthat it is St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right,\xe2\x80\x9d said his father. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish it were,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Junior laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s London as it might have been if they\xe2\x80\x99d allowed Wren to carry out\r\nhis plans of rebuilding after the Great Fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why didn\xe2\x80\x99t they allow him to?\xe2\x80\x9d Shearwater asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChiefly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril Senior, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, they\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to think or profit by experience. Wren offered them open\r\nspaces and broad streets; he offered them sunlight and air and\r\ncleanliness; he offered them beauty, order and grandeur. He offered to\r\nbuild for the imagination and the ambitious spirit of man, so that even\r\nthe most bestial, vaguely and remotely, as they walked those streets,\r\nmight feel that they were of the same race\xe2\x80\x94or very nearly\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nMichelangelo; that they too might feel themselves, in spirit at least,\r\nmagnificent, strong and free. He offered them all these things; he drew\r\na plan for them, walking in peril among the still smouldering ruins. But\r\nthey preferred to re-erect the old intricate squalor; they preferred the\r\nmedi\xc3\xa6val darkness and crookedness and beastly irregular quaintness; they\r\npreferred holes and crannies and winding tunnels; they preferred foul\r\nsmells, sunless, stagnant air, phthisis and rickets; they preferred\r\nugliness and pettiness and dirt; they preferred the wretched human\r\nscale, the scale of the sickly body, not of the mind. Miserable fools!\r\nBut I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man continued, shaking his head, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can\xe2\x80\x99t blame\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d His hair had blown loose from its insecure anchorage; with a\r\ngesture of resignation he brushed it back into place. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t blame\r\nthem. We should have done the same in the circumstances\xe2\x80\x94undoubtedly.\r\nPeople offer us reason and beauty; but we will have none of them,\r\nbecause they don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to square with the notions that were grafted\r\ninto our souls in youth, that have grown there and become a part of us.\r\n_Experientia docet_\xe2\x80\x94nothing falser, so far as most of us are concerned,\r\nwas ever said. You, no doubt, my dear Theodore, have often in the past\r\nmade a fool of yourself with women....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril Junior made an embarrassed gesture that half denied, half\r\nadmitted the soft impeachment. Shearwater turned away, painfully\r\nreminded of what, for a moment, he had half forgotten. Gumbril Senior\r\nswept on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill that prevent you from making as great a fool of yourself again\r\nto-morrow? It will not. It will most assuredly not.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Senior\r\nshook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThe inconveniences and horrors of the pox are perfectly\r\nwell known to every one; but still the disease flourishes and spreads.\r\nSeveral million people were killed in a recent war and half the world\r\nruined; but we all busily go on in courses that make another event of\r\nthe same sort inevitable. _Experientia docet? Experientia_ doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. And\r\nthat is why we must not be too hard on these honest citizens of London\r\nwho, fully appreciating the inconveniences of darkness, disorder and\r\ndirt, manfully resisted any attempt to alter conditions which they had\r\nbeen taught from childhood onwards to consider as necessary, right and\r\nbelonging inevitably to the order of things. We must not be too hard. We\r\nare doing something even worse ourselves. Knowing by a century of\r\nexperience how beautiful, how graceful, how soothing to the mind is an\r\nordered piece of town-planning, we pull down almost the only specimen of\r\nit we possess and put up in its place a chaos of Portland stone that is\r\nan offence against civilization. But let us forget about these old\r\ncitizens and the labyrinth of ugliness and inconvenience which we have\r\ninherited from them, and which is called London. Let us forget the\r\ncontemporaries who are making it still worse than it was. Come for a\r\nwalk with me through this ideal city. Look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Gumbril Senior began expounding it to them.\r\n\r\nIn the middle, there, of that great elliptical Piazza at the eastern end\r\nof the new City, stands, four-square, the Royal Exchange. Pierced only\r\nwith small dark windows, and built of rough ashlars of the silvery\r\nPortland stone, the ground floor serves as a massy foundation for the\r\nhuge pilasters that slide up, between base and capital, past three tiers\r\nof pedimented windows. Upon them rest the cornice, the attic and the\r\nbalustrade, and on every pier of the balustrade a statue holds up its\r\nsymbol against the sky. Four great portals, rich with allegory, admit to\r\nthe courtyard with its double tier of coupled columns, its cloister and\r\nits gallery. The statue of Charles the Martyr rides triumphantly in the\r\nmidst, and within the windows one guesses the great rooms, rich with\r\nheavy garlands of plaster, panelled with carved wood.\r\n\r\nTen streets give on to the Piazza, and at either end of its ellipse the\r\nwater of sumptuous fountains ceaselessly blows aloft and falls.\r\nCommerce, in that to the north of the Exchange, holds up her cornucopia,\r\nand from the midst of its grapes and apples the master jet leaps up;\r\nfrom the teats of all the ten Useful Arts, grouped with their symbols\r\nabout the central figure, there spouts a score of fine subsidiary\r\nstreams. The dolphins, the sea-horses and the Tritons sport in the basin\r\nbelow. To the south, the ten principal cities of the Kingdom stand in a\r\nfamily round the Mother London, who pours from her urn an inexhaustible\r\nThames.\r\n\r\nRanged round the Piazza are the Goldsmiths\xe2\x80\x99 Hall, the Office of Excise,\r\nthe Mint, the Post Office. Their flanks are curved to the curve of the\r\nellipse. Between pilasters, their windows look out on to the Exchange,\r\nand the sister statues on the balustrades beckon to one another across\r\nthe intervening space.\r\n\r\nTwo master roads of ninety feet from wall to wall run westwards from the\r\nExchange. New Gate ends the more northern vista with an Arch of Triumph,\r\nwhose three openings are deep, shadowy and solemn as the entries of\r\ncaverns. The Guildhall and the halls of the twelve City Companies in\r\ntheir livery of rose-red brick, with their lacings of white stone at the\r\ncoigns and round the windows, lend to the street an air of domestic and\r\ncomfortable splendour. And every two or three hundred paces the line of\r\nthe houses is broken, and in the indentation of a square recess there\r\nrises, conspicuous and insular, the fantastic tower of a parish church.\r\nSpire out of dome; octagon on octagon diminishing upwards; cylinder on\r\ncylinder; round lanterns, lanterns of many sides; towers with airy\r\npinnacles; clusters of pillars linked by incurving cornices, and above\r\nthem, four more clusters and above once more; square towers pierced with\r\npointed windows; spires uplifted on flying buttresses; spires bulbous at\r\nthe base\xe2\x80\x94the multitude of them beckons, familiar and friendly, on the\r\nsky. From the other shore, or sliding along the quiet river, you see\r\nthem all, you tell over their names; and the great dome swells up in the\r\nmidst overtopping them all.\r\n\r\nThe dome of St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThe other master street that goes westward from the Piazza of the\r\nExchange slants down towards it. The houses are of brick, plain-faced\r\nand square, arcaded at the base, so that the shops stand back from the\r\nstreet and the pedestrian walks dry-shod under the harmonious succession\r\nof the vaultings. And there at the end of the street, at the base of a\r\ntriangular space formed by the coming together of this with another\r\nmaster street that runs eastwards to Tower Hill, there stands the\r\nCathedral. To the north of it is the Deanery and under the arcades are\r\nthe booksellers\xe2\x80\x99 shops.\r\n\r\nFrom St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s the main road slopes down under the swaggering\r\nItalianate arches of Ludgate, past the wide lime-planted boulevards that\r\nrun north and south within and without the city wall, to the edge of the\r\nFleet Ditch\xe2\x80\x94widened now into a noble canal, on whose paved banks the\r\nbarges unload their freights of country stuff\xe2\x80\x94leaps it on a single\r\nflying arch to climb again to a round circus, a little to the east of\r\nTemple Bar, from which, in a pair of diagonally superimposed crosses,\r\neight roads radiate: three northwards towards Holborn, three from the\r\nopposite arc towards the river, one eastward to the City, and one past\r\nLincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Fields to the west. The piazza is all of brick and the\r\nhouses that compose it are continuous above the ground-floor level; for\r\nthe roads lead out under archways. To one who stands in the centre at\r\nthe foot of the obelisk that commemorates the victory over the Dutch, it\r\nseems a smooth well of brickwork pierced by eight arched conduits at the\r\nbase and diversified above by the three tiers of plain, unornamented\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nWho shall describe all the fountains in the open places, all the statues\r\nand monuments? In the circus north of London Bridge, where the four\r\nroads come together, stands a pyramid of nymphs and Tritons\xe2\x80\x94river\r\ngoddesses of Polyolbion, sea-gods of the island beaches\xe2\x80\x94bathing in a\r\nceaseless tumble of white water. And here the city griffon spouts from\r\nits beak, the royal lion from between its jaws. St. George at the foot\r\nof the Cathedral rides down a dragon whose nostrils spout, not fire, but\r\nthe clear water of the New River. In front of the India House, four\r\nelephants of black marble, endorsed with towers of white, blow through\r\ntheir upturned trunks the copious symbol of Eastern wealth. In the\r\ngardens of the Tower sits Charles the Second, enthroned among a troop of\r\nMuses, Cardinal Virtues, Graces and Hours. The tower of the\r\nCustoms-House is a pharos. A great water-gate, the symbol of naval\r\ntriumph, spans the Fleet at its junction with the Thames. The river is\r\nembanked from Blackfriars to the Tower, and at every twenty paces a\r\ngrave stone angel looks out from the piers of the balustrade across the\r\nwater....\r\n\r\nGumbril Senior expounded his city with passion. He pointed to the model\r\non the ground, he lifted his arms and turned up his eyes to suggest the\r\nsize and splendour of his edifices. His hair blew wispily loose and fell\r\ninto his eyes, and had to be brushed impatiently back again. He pulled\r\nat his beard; his spectacles flashed, as though they were living eyes.\r\nLooking at him, Gumbril Junior could imagine that he saw before him the\r\npassionate and gesticulating silhouette of one of those old shepherds\r\nwho stand at the base of Piranesi\xe2\x80\x99s ruins demonstrating obscurely the\r\nprodigious grandeur and the abjection of the human race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou? Is it you?\xe2\x80\x9d She seemed doubtful.\r\n\r\nGumbril nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s me,\xe2\x80\x9d he reassured her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve shaved; that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe had left his beard in the top right-hand drawer of the chest of\r\ndrawers, among the ties and the collars.\r\n\r\nEmily looked at him judicially. \xe2\x80\x9cI like you better without it,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ndecided at last. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look nicer. Oh no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you weren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnice before,\xe2\x80\x9d she hastened to add. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94you know\xe2\x80\x94gentler\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nhesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a silly word,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there it is: sweeter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was the unkindest cut of all. \xe2\x80\x9cMilder and more melancholy?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you like to put it like that,\xe2\x80\x9d Emily agreed.\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and raised it to his lips. \xe2\x80\x9cI forgive you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe could forgive her anything for the sake of those candid eyes,\r\nanything for the grave, serious mouth, anything for the short brown hair\r\nthat curled\xe2\x80\x94oh, but never seriously, never gravely\xe2\x80\x94with such a hilarious\r\nextravagance round her head. He had met her, or rather the Complete Man,\r\nflushed with his commercial triumphs as he returned from his victory\r\nover Mr. Boldero, had met her at the National Gallery. \xe2\x80\x9cOld Masters,\r\nyoung mistresses;\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman had recommended the National Gallery. He was\r\nwalking up the Venetian Room, feeling as full of swaggering vitality as\r\nthe largest composition of Veronese, when he heard, gigglingly whispered\r\njust behind him his Open Sesame to new adventure, \xe2\x80\x9cBeaver.\xe2\x80\x9d He spun\r\nround on his tracks and found himself face to face with two rather\r\nstartled young women. He frowned ferociously: he demanded satisfaction\r\nfor the impertinence. They were both, he noticed, of gratifyingly\r\npleasing appearance and both extremely young. One of them, the elder it\r\nseemed, and the more charming, as he had decided from the first, of the\r\ntwo, was dreadfully taken aback; blushed to the eyes, stammered\r\napologetically. But the other, who had obviously pronounced the word,\r\nonly laughed. It was she who made easy the forming of an acquaintance\r\nwhich ripened, half an hour later, over the tea-cups and to the strains\r\nof the most classy music on the fifth floor of Lyons\xe2\x80\x99s Strand Corner\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nTheir names were Emily and Molly. Emily, it seemed, was married. It was\r\nMolly who let that out, and the other had been angry with her for what\r\nwas evidently an indiscretion. The bald fact that Emily was married had\r\nat once been veiled with mysteries, surrounded and protected by\r\nsilences; whenever the Complete Man asked a question about it, Emily did\r\nnot answer and Molly only giggled. But if Emily was married and the\r\nelder of the two, Molly was decidedly the more knowledgeable about life;\r\nMr. Mercaptan would certainly have set her down as the more civilized.\r\nEmily didn\xe2\x80\x99t live in London; she didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to live anywhere in\r\nparticular. At the moment she was staying with Molly\xe2\x80\x99s family at Kew.\r\n\r\nHe had seen them the next day, and the day after, and the day after\r\nthat; once at lunch, to desert them precipitately for his afternoon with\r\nRosie; once at tea in Kew Gardens; once at dinner, with a theatre to\r\nfollow and an extravagant taxi back to Kew at midnight. The tame decoy\r\nallays the fears of the shy wild birds; Molly, who was tame, who was\r\nfrankly a flirting little wanton, had served the Complete Man as a decoy\r\nfor the ensnaring of Emily. When Molly went away to stay with friends in\r\nthe country, Emily was already inured and accustomed to the hunter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence; she accepted the playful attitude of gallantry, which the\r\nComplete Man, at the invitation of Molly\xe2\x80\x99s rolling eyes and provocative\r\ngiggle, had adopted from the first, as natural and belonging to the\r\nestablished order of things. With giggling Molly to give her a lead, she\r\nhad gone in three days much further along the path of intimacy than, by\r\nherself, she would have advanced in ten times the number of meetings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems funny,\xe2\x80\x9d she had said the first time they met after Molly\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeparture, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems funny to be seeing you without Molly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed funnier with Molly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Complete Man. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Molly\r\nI wanted to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMolly\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice, dear girl,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared loyally. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\namusing and can talk. And I can\xe2\x80\x99t; I\xe2\x80\x99m not a bit amusing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t difficult to retort to that sort of thing; but Emily didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve in compliments; oh, quite genuinely not.\r\n\r\nHe set out to make the exploration of her; and now that she was inured\r\nto him, no longer too frightened to let him approach, now, moreover,\r\nthat he had abandoned the jocular insolences of the Complete Man in\r\nfavour of a more native mildness, which he felt instinctively was more\r\nsuitable in this particular case, she laid no difficulties in his way.\r\nShe was lonely, and he seemed to understand everything so well; in the\r\nunknown country of her spirit and her history she was soon going eagerly\r\nbefore him as his guide.\r\n\r\nShe was an orphan. Her mother she hardly remembered. Her father had died\r\nof influenza when she was fifteen. One of his business friends used to\r\ncome and see her at school, take her out for treats and give her\r\nchocolates. She used to call him Uncle Stanley. He was a leather\r\nmerchant, fat and jolly with a rather red face, very white teeth and a\r\nbald head that was beautifully shiny. When she was seventeen and a half\r\nhe asked her to marry him, and she had said yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy on earth?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said he\xe2\x80\x99d take me round the world; it was just when the war had come\r\nto an end. Round the world, you know; and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like school. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow anything about it and he was very nice to me; he was very pressing.\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what marriage meant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head; it was quite true. \xe2\x80\x9cBut not in the least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she had been born within the twentieth century. It seemed a case for\r\nthe text-books of sexual psychology. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Emily X., born in 1901, was\r\nfound to be in a state of perfect innocence and ignorance at the time of\r\nthe Armistice, 11th November 1918,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you married him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had covered her face with her hands, she had shuddered. The amateur\r\nuncle, now professionally a husband, had come to claim his rights\xe2\x80\x94drunk.\r\nShe had fought him, she had eluded him, had run away and locked herself\r\ninto another room. On the second night of her honeymoon he gave her a\r\nbruise on the forehead and a bite on the left breast which had gone on\r\nseptically festering for weeks. On the fourth, more determined than\r\never, he seized her so violently by the throat, that a blood-vessel\r\nbroke and she began coughing bright blood over the bedclothes. The\r\namateur uncle had been reduced to send for a doctor and Emily had spent\r\nthe next few weeks in a nursing home. That was four years ago; her\r\nhusband had tried to induce her to come back, but Emily had refused. She\r\nhad a little money of her own; she was able to refuse. The amateur uncle\r\nhad consoled himself with other and more docile nieces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd has nobody tried to make love to you since then?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, lots of them have tried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not succeeded?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like men,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re hateful, most\r\nof them. They\xe2\x80\x99re brutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Anch\xe2\x80\x99 io?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I a brute too?\xe2\x80\x9d And behind his beard, suddenly, he felt rather a\r\nbrute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emily, after a little hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re different. At least\r\nI think you are; though sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d she added candidly, \xe2\x80\x9csometimes you\r\ndo and say things which make me wonder if you really are different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Complete Man laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t laugh like that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather stupid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re perfectly right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd how did she spend her time? He continued the exploration.\r\n\r\nWell, she read a lot of books; but most of the novels she got from\r\nBoots\xe2\x80\x99 seemed to her rather silly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo much about the same thing. Always love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Complete Man gave a shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch is life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emily.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when she was in the country\xe2\x80\x94and she was often in the country,\r\ntaking lodgings here and there in little villages, weeks and months at a\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94she went for long walks. Molly couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why she liked\r\nthe country; but she did. She was very fond of flowers. She liked them\r\nmore than people, she thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could paint,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could, I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy for ever,\r\njust painting flowers. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t paint.\xe2\x80\x9d She shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ntried so often. Such dirty, ugly smudges come out on the paper; and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall so lovely in my head, so lovely out in the fields.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril began talking with erudition about the flora of West Surrey:\r\nwhere you could find butterfly orchis and green man and the bee, the\r\nwood where there was actually wild columbine growing, the best\r\nlocalities for butcher\xe2\x80\x99s broom, the outcrops of clay where you get wild\r\ndaffodils. All this odd knowledge came spouting up into his mind from\r\nsome underground source of memory. Flowers\xe2\x80\x94he never thought about\r\nflowers nowadays from one year\xe2\x80\x99s end to the other. But his mother had\r\nliked flowers. Every spring and summer they used to go down to stay at\r\ntheir cottage in the country. All their walks, all their drives in the\r\ngoverness cart had been hunts after flowers. And naturally the child had\r\nhunted with all his mother\xe2\x80\x99s ardour. He had kept books of pressed\r\nflowers, he had mummified them in hot sand, he had drawn maps of the\r\ncountry and coloured them elaborately with different coloured inks to\r\nshow where the different flowers grew. How long ago all that was!\r\nHorribly long ago! Many seeds had fallen in the stony places of his\r\nspirit, to spring luxuriantly up into stalky plants and wither again\r\nbecause they had no deepness of earth; many had been sown there and had\r\ndied, since his mother scattered the seeds of the wild flowers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you want sundew,\xe2\x80\x9d he wound up, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll find it in the Punch\r\nBowl, under Hindhead. Or round about Frensham. The Little Pond, you\r\nknow, not the Big.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you know all about them,\xe2\x80\x9d Emily exclaimed in delight. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed\r\nof my poor little knowledge. And you must really love them as much as I\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril did not deny it; they were linked henceforth by a chain of\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nBut what else did she do?\r\n\r\nOh, of course she played the piano a great deal. Very badly; but at any\r\nrate it gave her pleasure. Beethoven: she liked Beethoven best. More or\r\nless, she knew all the sonatas, though she could never keep up anything\r\nlike the right speed in the difficult parts.\r\n\r\nGumbril had again shown himself wonderfully at home. \xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbet you can\xe2\x80\x99t shake that low B in the last variation but one of Op. 106\r\nso that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd of course she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and of course she was glad that he knew all\r\nabout it and how impossible it was.\r\n\r\nIn the cab, as they drove back to Kew that evening, the Complete Man had\r\ndecided it was time to do something decisive. The parting kiss\xe2\x80\x94more of a\r\nplayful sonorous buss than a serious embracement\xe2\x80\x94that was already in the\r\nprotocol, as signed and sealed before her departure by giggling Molly.\r\nIt was time, the Complete Man considered, that this salute should take\r\non a character less formal and less playful. One, two, three and,\r\ndecisively, as they passed through Hammersmith Broadway, he risked the\r\ngesture. Emily burst into tears. He was not prepared for that, though\r\nperhaps he should have been. It was only by imploring, only by almost\r\nweeping himself, that Gumbril persuaded her to revoke her decision\r\nnever, never to see him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had thought you were different,\xe2\x80\x9d she sobbed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, please,\xe2\x80\x9d he entreated. He was on the point of tearing off his\r\nbeard and confessing everything there and then. But that, on second\r\nthoughts, would probably only make things worse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, I promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the end, she had consented to see him once again, provisionally, in\r\nKew Gardens, on the following day. They were to meet at the little\r\ntemple that stands on the hillock above the valley of the heathers.\r\n\r\nAnd now, duly, they had met. The Complete Man had been left at home in\r\nthe top right-hand drawer, along with the ties and collars. She would\r\nprefer, he guessed, the Mild and Melancholy one; he was quite right. She\r\nhad thought him \xe2\x80\x98sweeter\xe2\x80\x99 at a first glimpse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgive you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and kissed her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI forgive you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHand in hand they walked down towards the valley of the heaths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you should be forgiving me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nseems to me that I ought to be doing the forgiving. After yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe shook her head at him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou made me so wretched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve already done your forgiving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to take it very much for granted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emily. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be too\r\nsure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmily laughed again. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel happy,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow green the grass is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGreen, green\xe2\x80\x94after these long damp months it glowed in the sunlight, as\r\nthough it were lighted from inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the trees!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pale, high, clot-polled trees of the English spring; the dark,\r\nsymmetrical pine trees, islanded here and there on the lawns, each with\r\nits own separate profile against the sky and its own shadow,\r\nimpenetrably dark or freckled with moving lights, on the grass at its\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThey walked on in silence. Gumbril took off his hat, breathed the soft\r\nair that smelt of the greenness of the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are quiet places also in the mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said meditatively. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\r\nbuild bandstands and factories on them. Deliberately\xe2\x80\x94to put a stop to\r\nthe quietness. We don\xe2\x80\x99t like the quietness. All the thoughts, all the\r\npreoccupations in my head\xe2\x80\x94round and round, continually.\xe2\x80\x9d He made a\r\ncircular motion with his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the jazz bands, the music-hall\r\nsongs, the boys shouting the news. What\xe2\x80\x99s it for? what\xe2\x80\x99s it all for? To\r\nput an end to the quiet, to break it up and disperse it, to pretend at\r\nany cost it isn\xe2\x80\x99t there. Ah, but it is; it is there, in spite of\r\neverything, at the back of everything. Lying awake at night,\r\nsometimes\xe2\x80\x94not restlessly, but serenely, waiting for sleep\xe2\x80\x94the quiet\r\nre-establishes itself, piece by piece; all the broken bits, all the\r\nfragments of it we\xe2\x80\x99ve been so busily dispersing all day long. It\r\nre-establishes itself, an inward quiet, like this outward quiet of grass\r\nand trees. It fills one, it grows\xe2\x80\x94a crystal quiet, a growing, expanding\r\ncrystal. It grows, it becomes more perfect; it is beautiful and\r\nterrifying, yes, terrifying as well as beautiful. For one\xe2\x80\x99s alone in the\r\ncrystal and there\xe2\x80\x99s no support from outside, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing external\r\nand important, nothing external and trivial to pull oneself up by or to\r\nstand on, superiorly, contemptuously, so that one can look down. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing to laugh at or feel enthusiastic about. But the quiet grows and\r\ngrows. Beautifully and unbearably. And at last you are conscious of\r\nsomething approaching; it is almost a faint sound of footsteps.\r\nSomething inexpressibly lovely and wonderful advances through the\r\ncrystal, nearer, nearer. And, oh, inexpressibly terrifying. For if it\r\nwere to touch you, if it were to seize and engulf you, you\xe2\x80\x99d die; all\r\nthe regular, habitual, daily part of you would die. There would be an\r\nend of bandstands and whizzing factories, and one would have to begin\r\nliving arduously in the quiet, arduously in some strange, unheard-of\r\nmanner. Nearer, nearer come the steps; but one can\xe2\x80\x99t face the advancing\r\nthing. One daren\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s too terrifying, it\xe2\x80\x99s too painful to die.\r\nQuickly, before it is too late, start the factory wheels, bang the drum,\r\nblow up the saxophone. Think of the women you\xe2\x80\x99d like to sleep with, the\r\nschemes for making money, the gossip about your friends, the last\r\noutrage of the politicians. Anything for a diversion. Break the silence,\r\nsmash the crystal to pieces. There, it lies in bits; it is easily\r\nbroken, hard to build up and easy to break. And the steps? Ah, those\r\nhave taken themselves off, double quick. Double quick, they were gone at\r\nthe first flawing of the crystal. And by this time the lovely and\r\nterrifying thing is three infinities away, at least. And you lie\r\ntranquilly on your bed, thinking of what you\xe2\x80\x99d do if you had ten\r\nthousand pounds, and of all the fornications you\xe2\x80\x99ll never commit.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nthought of Rosie\xe2\x80\x99s pink underclothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou make things very complicated,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after a silence.\r\n\r\nGumbril spread out his great-coat on a green bank and they sat down.\r\nLeaning back, his hands under his head, he watched her sitting there\r\nbeside him. She had taken off her hat; there was a stir of wind in those\r\nchildish curls, and at the nape, at the temples, where the hair had\r\nsleaved out thin and fine, the sunlight made little misty haloes of\r\ngold. Her hands clasped round her knees, she sat quite still, looking\r\nout across the green expanses, at the trees, at the white clouds on the\r\nhorizon. There was quiet in her mind, he thought. She was native to that\r\ncrystal world; for her, the steps came comfortingly through the silence\r\nand the lovely thing brought with it no terrors. It was all so easy for\r\nher and simple.\r\n\r\nAh, so simple, so simple; like the Hire Purchase System on which Rosie\r\nhad bought her pink bed. And how simple it was, too, to puddle clear\r\nwaters and unpetal every flower!\xe2\x80\x94every wild flower, by God! one ever\r\npassed in a governess cart at the heels of a barrel-bellied pony. How\r\nsimple to spit on the floors of churches! _Si prega di non sputare._\r\nSimple to kick one\xe2\x80\x99s legs and enjoy oneself\xe2\x80\x94dutifully\xe2\x80\x94in pink\r\nunderclothing. Perfectly simple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like the Arietta, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\xe2\x80\x9d said Emily suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nArietta of Op. 111.\xe2\x80\x9d And she hummed the first bars of the air. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou feel it\xe2\x80\x99s like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emily. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-day, I mean. You and me. These gardens\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd she went on humming.\r\n\r\nGumbril shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cToo simple for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nEmily laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, but then think how impossible it gets a little\r\nfarther on.\xe2\x80\x9d She agitated her fingers wildly, as though she were trying\r\nto play the impossible passages. \xe2\x80\x9cIt begins easily for the sake of poor\r\nimbeciles like me; but it goes on, it goes on, more and more fully and\r\nsubtly and abstrusely and embracingly. But it\xe2\x80\x99s still the same\r\nmovement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shadows stretched farther and farther across the lawns, and as the\r\nsun declined the level light picked out among the grasses innumerable\r\nstipplings of shadow; and in the paths, that had seemed under the more\r\nperpendicular rays as level as a table, a thousand little shadowy\r\ndepressions and sun-touched mountains were now apparent. Gumbril looked\r\nat his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must fly.\xe2\x80\x9d He jumped up. \xe2\x80\x9cQuick, quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be late.\xe2\x80\x9d He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell her for what. \xe2\x80\x9cWait and see\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nall that Emily could get out of him by her questioning. They hurried out\r\nof the gardens, and in spite of her protests he insisted on taking a\r\ntaxi into town. \xe2\x80\x9cI have such a lot of unearned increment to get rid of,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe explained. The Patent Small-Clothes seemed at the moment remoter than\r\nthe farthest stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the taxi, in spite of the gobbled dinner, they were late.\r\nThe concert had begun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall get in in time for the minuetto.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s then that the fun really begins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSour grapes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emily, putting her ear to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds to me\r\nsimply too lovely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stood outside, like beggars waiting abjectly at the doors of a\r\nbanqueting-hall\xe2\x80\x94stood and listened to the snatches of music that came\r\nout tantalizingly from within. A rattle of clapping announced at last\r\nthat the first movement was over; the doors were thrown open. Hungrily\r\nthey rushed in. The Sclopis Quartet and a subsidiary viola were bowing\r\nfrom the platform. There was a chirrup of tuning, then preliminary\r\nsilence. Sclopis nodded and moved his bow. The minuetto of Mozart\xe2\x80\x99s G\r\nminor Quintet broke out, phrase after phrase, short and decisive, with\r\nevery now and then a violent sforzando chord, startling in its harsh and\r\nsudden emphasis.\r\n\r\nMinuetto\xe2\x80\x94all civilization, Mr. Mercaptan would have said, was implied in\r\nthe delicious word, the delicate, pretty thing. Ladies and precious\r\ngentlemen, fresh from the wit and gallantry of Crebillon-haunted sofas,\r\nstepping gracefully to a pattern of airy notes. To this passion of one\r\nwho cries out, to this obscure and angry argument with fate how would\r\nthey, Gumbril wondered, how would they have tripped it?\r\n\r\nHow pure the passion, how unaffected, clear and without clot or\r\npretension the unhappiness of that slow movement which followed! Blessed\r\nare the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Pure and unsullied; pure\r\nand unmixed, unadulterated. \xe2\x80\x9cNot passionate, thank God; only sensual and\r\nsentimental.\xe2\x80\x9d In the name of earwig. Amen. Pure, pure. Worshippers have\r\ntried to rape the statues of the gods; the statuaries who made the\r\nimages were generally to blame. And how deliciously, too, an artist can\r\nsuffer! and, in the face of the whole Albert Hall, with what an\r\neffective gesture and grimace! But blessed are the pure in heart, for\r\nthey shall see God. The instruments come together and part again. Long\r\nsilver threads hang aerially over a murmur of waters; in the midst of\r\nmuffled sobbing a cry. The fountains blow their architecture of slender\r\npillars, and from basin to basin the waters fall; from basin to basin,\r\nand every fall makes somehow possible a higher leaping of the jet, and\r\nat the last fall the mounting column springs up into the sunlight, and\r\nfrom water the music has modulated up into a rainbow. Blessed are the\r\npure in heart, for they shall see God; they shall make God visible, too,\r\nto other eyes.\r\n\r\nBlood beats in the ears. Beat, beat, beat. A slow drum in the darkness,\r\nbeating in the ears of one who lies wakeful with fever, with the\r\nsickness of too much misery. It beats unceasingly, in the ears, in the\r\nmind itself. Body and mind are indivisible, and in the spirit blood\r\npainfully throbs. Sad thoughts droop through the mind. A small, pure\r\nlight comes swaying down through the darkness, comes to rest, resigning\r\nitself to the obscurity of its misfortune. There is resignation, but\r\nblood still beats in the ears. Blood still painfully beats, though the\r\nmind has acquiesced. And then, suddenly, the mind exerts itself, throws\r\noff the fever of too much suffering and laughing, commands the body to\r\ndance. The introduction to the last movement comes to its suspended,\r\nthrobbing close. There is an instant of expectation, and then, with a\r\nseries of mounting trochees and a downward hurrying, step after tiny\r\nstep, in triple time, the dance begins. Irrelevant, irreverent, out of\r\nkey with all that has gone before. But man\xe2\x80\x99s greatest strength lies in\r\nhis capacity for irrelevance. In the midst of pestilences, wars and\r\nfamines, he builds cathedrals; and a slave, he can think the irrelevant\r\nand unsuitable thoughts of a free man. The spirit is slave to fever and\r\nbeating blood, at the mercy of an obscure and tyrannous misfortune. But\r\nirrelevantly, it elects to dance in triple measure\xe2\x80\x94a mounting skip, a\r\npatter of descending feet.\r\n\r\nThe G minor Quintet is at an end; the applause rattles out loudly.\r\nEnthusiasts stand up and cry bravo. And the five men on the platform\r\nrise and bow their acknowledgments. Great Sclopis himself receives his\r\nshare of the plaudits with a weary condescension; weary are his poached\r\neyes, weary his disillusioned smile. It is only his due, he knows; but\r\nhe has had so much clapping, so many lovely women. He has a Roman nose,\r\na colossal brow and, though the tawny musical mane does much to conceal\r\nthe fact, no back to his head. Garofalo, the second fiddle, is black,\r\nbeady-eyed and pot-bellied. The convex reflections of the electroliers\r\nslide back and forth over his polished bald head, as he bends, again,\r\nagain, in little military salutes. Peperkoek, two metres high, bows with\r\na sinuous politeness. His face, his hair are all of the same greyish\r\nbuff colour; he does not smile, his appearance is monolithic and grim.\r\nNot so exuberant Knoedler, who sweats and smiles and embraces his \xe2\x80\x99cello\r\nsend lays his hand to his heart and bows almost to the ground as though\r\nall this hullabaloo were directed only at him. As for poor little Mr.\r\nJenkins, the subsidiary viola, he has slid away into the background, and\r\nfeeling that this is really the Sclopis\xe2\x80\x99s show and that he, a mere\r\nintruder, has no right to any of these demonstrations, he hardly bows at\r\nall, but only smiles, vaguely and nervously, and from time to time makes\r\na little spasmodic twitch to show that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t really ungrateful or\r\nhaughty, as you might think, but that he feels in the circumstances\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nposition is a little embarrassing\xe2\x80\x94it is hard to explain....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, \xe2\x80\x9cto think that those ridiculous creatures could\r\nhave produced what we\xe2\x80\x99ve just been hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poached eye of Sclopis lighted on Emily, flushed and ardently\r\napplauding. He gave her, all to herself, a weary smile. He would have a\r\nletter, he guessed, to-morrow morning signed \xe2\x80\x98Your little Admirer in the\r\nThird Row.\xe2\x80\x99 She looked a choice little piece. He smiled again to\r\nencourage her. Emily, alas! had not even noticed. She was applauding the\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you enjoy it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, as they stepped out into a deserted Bond\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I...?\xe2\x80\x9d Emily laughed expressively. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnjoy isn\xe2\x80\x99t the word. You enjoy eating ices. It made me happy. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunhappy music, but it made me happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril hailed a cab and gave the address of his rooms in Great Russell\r\nStreet. \xe2\x80\x9cHappy,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, as they sat there side by side in the\r\ndarkness. He, too, was happy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we going?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo my rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall be quiet there.\xe2\x80\x9d He was afraid\r\nshe might object to going there\xe2\x80\x94after yesterday. But she made no\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome people think that it\xe2\x80\x99s only possible to be happy if one makes a\r\nnoise,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cI find it\xe2\x80\x99s too delicate and\r\nmelancholy for noise. Being happy is rather melancholy\xe2\x80\x94like the most\r\nbeautiful landscape, like those trees and the grass and the clouds and\r\nthe sunshine to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the outside,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, \xe2\x80\x9cit even looks rather dull.\xe2\x80\x9d They\r\nstumbled up the dark staircase to his rooms. Gumbril lit a pair of\r\ncandles and put the kettle on the gas ring. They sat together on the\r\ndivan sipping tea. In the rich, soft light of the candles she looked\r\ndifferent, more beautiful. The silk of her dress seemed wonderfully rich\r\nand glossy, like the petals of a tulip, and on her face, on her bare\r\narms and neck the light seemed to spread an impalpable bright bloom. On\r\nthe wall behind them, their shadows ran up towards the ceiling, enormous\r\nand profoundly black.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow unreal it is,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cNot true. This remote secret\r\nroom. These lights and shadows out of another time. And you out of\r\nnowhere and I, out of a past utterly remote from yours, sitting together\r\nhere, together\xe2\x80\x94and being happy. That\xe2\x80\x99s the strangest thing of all. Being\r\nquite senselessly happy. It\xe2\x80\x99s unreal, unreal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emily, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy? It\xe2\x80\x99s here and happening now. It _is_ real.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt all might vanish, at any moment,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nEmily smiled rather sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll vanish in due time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite\r\nnaturally, not by magic; it\xe2\x80\x99ll vanish the way everything else vanishes\r\nand changes. But it\xe2\x80\x99s here now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey gave themselves up to the enchantment. The candles burned, two\r\nshining eyes of flame, without a wink, minute after minute. But for them\r\nthere were no longer any minutes. Emily leaned against him, her body\r\nheld in the crook of his arm, her head resting on his shoulder. He\r\ncaressed his cheek against her hair; sometimes, very gently, he kissed\r\nher forehead or her closed eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had known you years ago ...\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I was a silly little\r\nidiot then. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have noticed any difference between you and\r\nanybody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be very jealous,\xe2\x80\x9d Emily spoke again after another timeless\r\nsilence. \xe2\x80\x9cThere must never be anybody else, never the shadow of anybody\r\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere never will be anybody else,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\nEmily smiled and opened her eyes, looked up at him. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, not here,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cnot in this real unreal room. Not during this eternity. But there\r\nwill be other rooms just as real as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so real, not so real.\xe2\x80\x9d He bent his face towards hers. She closed\r\nher eyes again, and the lids fluttered with a sudden tremulous movement\r\nat the touch of his light kiss.\r\n\r\nFor them there were no more minutes. But time passed, time passed\r\nflowing in a dark stream, stanchlessly, as though from some profound\r\nmysterious wound in the world\xe2\x80\x99s side, bleeding, bleeding for ever. One\r\nof the candles had burned down to the socket and the long, smoky flame\r\nwavered unsteadily. The flickering light troubled their eyes; the\r\nshadows twitched and stirred uneasily. Emily looked up at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the time?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nGumbril looked at his watch. It was nearly one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. \xe2\x80\x9cToo late for\r\nyou to get back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo late?\xe2\x80\x9d Emily sat-up. Ah, the enchantment was breaking, was giving\r\nway, like a film of ice beneath a weight, like a web before a thrust of\r\nthe wind. They looked at one another. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I do?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could sleep here,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril answered in a voice that came from a\r\nlong way away.\r\n\r\nShe sat for a long time in silence, looking through half-closed eyes at\r\nthe expiring candle flame. Gumbril watched her in an agony of suspense.\r\nWas the ice to be broken, the web-work finally and for ever torn? The\r\nenchantment could still be prolonged, the eternity renewed. He felt his\r\nheart beating in his breast; he held his breath. It would be terrible if\r\nshe were to go now, it would be a kind of death. The flame of the candle\r\nflickered more violently, leaping up in a thin, long, smoky flare,\r\nsinking again almost to darkness. Emily got up and blew out the candle.\r\nThe other still burned calmly and steadily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I stay?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you allow me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe understood the meaning of her question, and nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course? Is it as much of course as all that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I say so.\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled at her. The eternity had been renewed, the\r\nenchantment prolonged. There was no need to think of anything now but\r\nthe moment. The past was forgotten, the future abolished. There was only\r\nthis secret room and the candlelight and the unreal, impossible\r\nhappiness of being two. Now that this peril of a disenchantment had been\r\naverted, it would last for ever. He got up from the couch, crossed the\r\nroom, he took her hands and kissed them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we sleep now?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nGumbril nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mind if I blow out the light?\xe2\x80\x9d And without waiting for his\r\nanswer, Emily turned, gave a puff, and the room was in darkness. He\r\nheard the rustling of her undressing. Hastily he stripped off his own\r\nclothes, pulled back the coverlet from the divan. The bed was made and\r\nready; he opened it and slipped between the sheets. A dim greenish light\r\nfrom the gas lamp in the street below came up between the parted\r\ncurtains illuminating faintly the farther end of the room. Against this\r\ntempered darkness he could see her, silhouetted, standing quite still,\r\nas if hesitating on some invisible brink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmily,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m coming,\xe2\x80\x9d Emily answered. She stood there, unmoving, a few seconds\r\nlonger, then overstepped the brink. She came silently across the room,\r\nand sat down on the edge of the low couch. Gumbril lay perfectly still,\r\nwithout speaking, waiting in the enchanted timeless darkness. Emily\r\nlifted her knees, slid her feet in under the sheet, then stretched\r\nherself out beside him, her body, in the narrow bed, touching his.\r\nGumbril felt that she was trembling; trembling, a sharp involuntary\r\nstart, a little shudder, another start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re cold,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and slipping one arm beneath her shoulders he\r\ndrew her, limp and unresisting, towards him. She lay there, pressed\r\nagainst him. Gradually the trembling ceased. Quite still, quite still in\r\nthe calm of the enchantment. The past is forgotten, the future\r\nabolished; there is only this dark and everlasting moment. A drugged and\r\nintoxicated stupor of happiness possessed his spirit; a numbness, warm\r\nand delicious, lay upon him. And yet through the stupor he knew with a\r\ndreadful anxious certainty that the end would soon be there. Like a man\r\non the night before his execution, he looked forward through the endless\r\npresent; he foresaw the end of his eternity. And after? Everything was\r\nuncertain and unsafe.\r\n\r\nVery gently, he began caressing her shoulder, her long slender arm,\r\ndrawing his finger-tips lightly and slowly over her smooth skin; slowly\r\nfrom her neck, over her shoulder, lingeringly round the elbow to her\r\nhand. Again, again; he was learning her arm. The form of it was part of\r\nthe knowledge, now, of his finger-tips; his fingers knew it as they knew\r\na piece of music, as they knew Mozart\xe2\x80\x99s Twelfth Sonata, for example. And\r\nthe themes that crowd so quickly one after another at the beginning of\r\nthe first movement played themselves serially, glitteringly in his mind;\r\nthey became a part of the enchantment.\r\n\r\nThrough the silk of her shift he learned her curving side, her smooth\r\nstraight back and the ridge of her spine. He stretched down, touched her\r\nfeet, her knees. Under the smock he learned her warm body, lightly,\r\nslowly caressing. He knew her, his fingers, he felt, could build her up,\r\na warm and curving statue in the darkness. He did not desire her; to\r\ndesire would have been to break the enchantment. He let himself sink\r\ndeeper and deeper into his dark stupor of happiness. She was asleep in\r\nhis arms; and soon he too was asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash descended the steps into King Street, and standing there on\r\nthe pavement looked dubiously first to the right and then to the left.\r\nLittle and loud, the taxis rolled by on their white wheels, the\r\nlong-snouted limousines passed with a sigh. The air smelt of watered\r\ndust, tempered in Mrs. Viveash\xe2\x80\x99s immediate neighbourhood by those\r\nmemories of Italian jasmines which were her perfume. On the opposite\r\npavement, in the shade, two young men, looking very conscious of their\r\ngrey top-hats, marched gravely along.\r\n\r\nLife, Mrs. Viveash thought, looked a little dim this morning, in spite\r\nof the fine weather. She glanced at her watch; it was one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Soon\r\none would have to eat some lunch. But where, and with whom? Mrs. Viveash\r\nhad no engagements. All the world was before her, she was absolutely\r\nfree, all day long. Yesterday, when she declined all those pressing\r\ninvitations, the prospect had seemed delightful. Liberty, no\r\ncomplications, no contacts; a pre-Adamite empty world to do what she\r\nliked in.\r\n\r\nBut to-day, when it came to the point, she hated her liberty. To come\r\nout like this at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock into a vacuum\xe2\x80\x94it was absurd, it was\r\nappalling. The prospect of immeasurable boredom opened before her.\r\nSteppes after steppes of ennui, horizon beyond horizon, for ever the\r\nsame. She looked again to the right and again to the left. Finally she\r\ndecided to go to the left. Slowly, walking along her private knife-edge\r\nbetween her personal abysses, she walked towards the left. She\r\nremembered suddenly one shining day like this in the summer of 1917,\r\nwhen she had walked along this same street, slowly, like this, on the\r\nsunny side, with Tony Lamb. All that day, that night, it had been one\r\nlong good-bye. He was going back the next morning. Less than a week\r\nlater he was dead. Never again, never again: there had been a time when\r\nshe could make herself cry, simply by saying those two words once or\r\ntwice, under her breath. Never again, never again. She repeated them\r\nsoftly now. But she felt no tears behind her eyes. Grief doesn\xe2\x80\x99t kill,\r\nlove doesn\xe2\x80\x99t kill; but time kills everything, kills desire, kills\r\nsorrow, kills in the end the mind that feels them; wrinkles and softens\r\nthe body while it still lives, rots it like a medlar, kills it too at\r\nlast. Never again, never again. Instead of crying, she laughed, laughed\r\naloud. The pigeon-breasted old gentleman who had just passed her,\r\ntwirling between his finger and thumb the ends of a white military\r\nmoustache, turned round startled. Could she be laughing at him?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever again,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon?\xe2\x80\x9d queried the martial gentleman, in a rich,\r\nport-winey, cigary voice.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash looked at him with such wide-eyed astonishment that the old\r\ngentleman was quite taken aback. \xe2\x80\x9cA thousand apologies, dear lady.\r\nThought you were addressing ... H\xe2\x80\x99m, ah\xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x9d He replaced his hat, squared\r\nhis shoulders and went off smartly, left, right, bearing preciously\r\nbefore him his pigeon-breast. Poor thing, he thought, poor young thing.\r\nTalking to herself. Must be cracked, must be off her head. Or perhaps\r\nshe took drugs. That was more likely: that was much more likely. Most of\r\nthem did nowadays. Vicious young women. Lesbians, drug-fiends,\r\nnymphomaniacs, dipsos\xe2\x80\x94thoroughly vicious, nowadays, thoroughly vicious.\r\nHe arrived at his club in an excellent temper.\r\n\r\nNever again, never, never again. Mrs. Viveash would have liked to be\r\nable to cry.\r\n\r\nSt. James\xe2\x80\x99s Square opened before her. Romantically under its trees the\r\nstatue pranced. The trees gave her an idea: she might go down into the\r\ncountry for the afternoon, take a cab and drive out, out, goodness only\r\nknew where! To the top of a hill somewhere. Box Hill, Leith Hill,\r\nHolmbury Hill, Ivinghoe Beacon\xe2\x80\x94any hill where one could sit and look out\r\nover plains. One might do worse than that with one\xe2\x80\x99s liberty.\r\n\r\nBut not much worse, she reflected.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash had turned up towards the northern side of the square and\r\nwas almost at its north-western corner when, with a thrill of genuine\r\ndelight, with a sense of the most profound relief she saw a familiar\r\nfigure, running down the steps of the London Library.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheodore!\xe2\x80\x9d she hallooed faintly but penetratingly, from her inward\r\ndeath-bed. \xe2\x80\x9cGumbril!\xe2\x80\x9d She waved her parasol.\r\n\r\nGumbril halted, looked round, came smiling to meet her. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\ndelightful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut how unfortunate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy unfortunate?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I of evil omen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunate,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril explained, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to catch a train and\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t profit by this meeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh no, Theodore,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re not going to catch a\r\ntrain. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to come and lunch with me. Providence has decreed\r\nit. You can\xe2\x80\x99t say no to Providence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve said yes to somebody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, with a coy and saucy mysteriousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where are you going in your famous train?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh again,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow intolerably tiresome and silly you are!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash declared.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne would think you were a sixteen-year-old schoolboy going out for his\r\nfirst assignation with a shop girl. At your age, Gumbril!\xe2\x80\x9d She shook her\r\nhead, smiled agonizingly and with contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is she? What sordid\r\npick-up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot sordid in the least,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Gumbril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut decidedly a pick-up. Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d A banana-skin was lying, like a\r\nbedraggled starfish, in the gutter, just in front of where they were\r\nstanding. Mrs. Viveash stepped forward and with the point of her parasol\r\nlifted it carefully up and offered it to her companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Merci_,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril bowed.\r\n\r\nShe tossed the skin back again into the gutter. \xe2\x80\x9cIn any case,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe young lady can wait while we have luncheon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve made the arrangement,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Emily\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter was in his pocket. She had taken the loveliest cottage just out\r\nof Robertsbridge, in Sussex. Ah, but the loveliest imaginable. For the\r\nwhole summer. He could come and see her there. He had telegraphed that\r\nhe would come to-day, this afternoon, by the two o\xe2\x80\x99clock from Charing\r\nCross.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash took him by the elbow. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npost office in that passage going from Jermyn Street to Piccadilly. You\r\ncan wire from there your infinite regrets. These things always improve\r\nwith a little keeping. There will be raptures when you _do_ go\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril allowed himself to be led along. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an insufferable woman you\r\nare,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of being grateful to me for asking you to luncheon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am grateful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd astonished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her. Mrs. Viveash smiled and fixed him for a moment with\r\nher pale, untroubled eyes.... She said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI must be at Charing Cross by two, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99re lunching at Verrey\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril shook his head.\r\n\r\nThey were at the corner of Jermyn Street. Mrs. Viveash halted and\r\ndelivered her ultimatum, the more impressive for being spoken in that\r\nexpiring voice of one who says _in articulo_ the final and supremely\r\nimportant things. \xe2\x80\x9cWe lunch at Verrey\xe2\x80\x99s, Theodore, or I shall never,\r\nnever speak to you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut be reasonable, Myra,\xe2\x80\x9d he implored. If only he\xe2\x80\x99d told her that he\r\nhad a business appointment.... Imbecile, to have dropped those stupid\r\nhints\xe2\x80\x94in that tone!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI prefer not to be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\nGumbril made a gesture of despair and was silent. He thought of Emily in\r\nher native quiet among the flowers; in a cottage altogether too\r\ncottagey, with honeysuckles and red ramblers and hollyhocks\xe2\x80\x94though, on\r\nsecond thoughts, none of them would be blooming yet, would\r\nthey?\xe2\x80\x94happily, in white muslin, extracting from the cottage piano the\r\neasier sections of the Arietta. A little absurd, perhaps, when you\r\nconsidered her like that; but exquisite, but adorable, but pure of heart\r\nand flawless in her bright pellucid integrity, complete as a crystal in\r\nits faceted perfection. She would be waiting for him, expecting him; and\r\nthey would walk through the twiddly lanes\xe2\x80\x94or perhaps there would be a\r\ngoverness cart for hire, with a fat pony like a tub on legs to pull\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94they would look for flowers in the woods and perhaps he would still\r\nremember what sort of noise a whitethroat makes; or even if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremember, he could always magisterially say he did. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nwhitethroat, Emily. Do you hear? The one that goes \xe2\x80\x98Tweedly, weedly,\r\nweedledy dee.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m waiting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cPatiently, however.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril looked at her and found her smiling like a tragic mask. After\r\nall, he reflected, Emily would still be there if he went down to-morrow.\r\nIt would be stupid to quarrel with Myra about something that was really,\r\nwhen he came to think of it, not of enormous importance. It was stupid\r\nto quarrel with any one about anything; and with Myra and about this,\r\nparticularly so. In this white dress patterned with flowing arabesques\r\nof black she looked, he thought, more than ever enchanting. There had\r\nbeen times in the past.... The past leads on to the present.... No; but\r\nin any case she was excellent company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sighing decisively, \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s go and send my wire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash made no comment, and traversing Jermyn Street they walked\r\nup the narrow passage under the lee of Wren\xe2\x80\x99s bald barn of St. James\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nto the post office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall pretext a catastrophe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, as they entered; and\r\ngoing to the telegraph desk he wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cSlight accident on way to station\r\nnot serious at all but a little indisposed come same train to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe addressed the form and handed it in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young lady behind the bars, as she read it\r\nthrough, prodding each successive word with the tip of her blunt pencil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little indisposed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, and he felt suddenly very much\r\nashamed of himself. \xe2\x80\x9cA little indisposed,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94no, really, that was too\r\nmuch. He\xe2\x80\x99d withdraw the telegram, he\xe2\x80\x99d go after all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReady?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Viveash, coming up from the other end of the counter\r\nwhere she had been buying stamps.\r\n\r\nGumbril pushed a florin under the bars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little indisposed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, hooting with laughter, and he walked\r\ntowards the door leaning heavily on his stick and limping. \xe2\x80\x9cSlight\r\naccident,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the meaning of this clownery?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril had limped up to the door and stood there,\r\nholding it open for her. He was taking no responsibility for himself. It\r\nwas the clown\xe2\x80\x99s doing, and the clown, poor creature, was _non compos_,\r\nnot entirely there, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be called to account for his actions.\r\nHe limped after her towards Piccadilly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Giudicato guarabile in cinque giorni_,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\ncharming that always is in the Italian papers. The fickle lady, the\r\njealous lover, the stab, the _colpo di rivoltella_, the mere Anglo-Saxon\r\nblack eye\xe2\x80\x94all judged by the house surgeon at the Misericordia curable in\r\nfive days. And you, my poor Gumbril, are you curable in five days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat depends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cThere may be complications.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash waved her parasol; a taxi came swerving to the pavement\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nedge in front of them. \xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t be expected to\r\nwalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt Verrey\xe2\x80\x99s they lunched off lobsters and white wine. \xe2\x80\x9cFish suppers,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGumbril quoted jovially from the Restoration, \xe2\x80\x9cfish suppers will make a\r\nman hop like a flea.\xe2\x80\x9d Through the whole meal he clowned away in the most\r\ninimitable style. The ghost of a governess cart rolled along the twiddly\r\nlanes of Robertsbridge. But one can refuse to accept responsibility; a\r\nclown cannot be held accountable. And besides, when the future and the\r\npast are abolished, when it is only the present instant, whether\r\nenchanted or unenchanted, that counts, when there are no causes or\r\nmotives, no future consequences to be considered, how can there be\r\nresponsibility, even for those who are not clowns? He drank a great deal\r\nof hock, and when the clock struck two and the train had begun to snort\r\nout of Charing Cross, he could not refrain from proposing the health of\r\nViscount Lascelles. After that he began telling Mrs. Viveash about his\r\nadventure as a Complete Man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have seen me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, describing his beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have been bowled over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see me, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, what a Don Giovanni. _La ci\r\ndarem la mano, La mi dirai di si, Vieni, non e lontano, Partiam, ben\r\nmio, da qui._ And they came, they came. Without hesitation. No \xe2\x80\x98_vorrei\r\ne non vorrei_,\xe2\x80\x99 no \xe2\x80\x98_mi trema un poco il cor_.\xe2\x80\x99 Straight away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Felice, io so, sarei_,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash sang very faintly under her\r\nbreath, from a remote bed of agony.\r\n\r\nAh, happiness, happiness; a little dull, some one had wisely said, when\r\nyou looked at it from outside. An affair of duets at the cottage piano,\r\nof collecting specimens, hand in hand, for the _hortus siccus_. A matter\r\nof integrity and quietness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but the history of the young woman who was married four years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexclaimed Gumbril with clownish rapture, \xe2\x80\x9cand remains to this day a\r\nvirgin\xe2\x80\x94what an episode in my memoirs!\xe2\x80\x9d In the enchanted darkness he had\r\nlearned her young body. He looked at his fingers; her beauty was a part\r\nof their knowledge. On the tablecloth he drummed out the first bars of\r\nthe Twelfth Sonata of Mozart. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd even after singing her duet with the\r\nDon,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is still virgin. There are chaste pleasures,\r\nsublimated sensualities. More thrillingly voluptuous,\xe2\x80\x9d with the gesture\r\nof a restaurant-keeper who praises the speciality of the house, he blew\r\na treacly kiss, \xe2\x80\x9cthan any of the grosser deliriums.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is all this about?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\nGumbril finished off his glass. \xe2\x80\x9cI am talking esoterically,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor my own pleasure, not yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me more about the beard,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cI liked the\r\nbeard so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, \xe2\x80\x9clet us try to be unworthy with coherence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey sat for a long time over their cigarettes; it was half past three\r\nbefore Mrs. Viveash suggested they should go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking at her watch, \xe2\x80\x9cto have tea. One damned\r\nmeal after another. And never anything new to eat. And every year one\r\ngets bored with another of the old things. Lobster, for instance, how I\r\nused to adore lobster once! But to-day\xe2\x80\x94well, really, it was only your\r\nconversation, Theodore, that made it tolerable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril put his hand to his heart and bowed. He felt suddenly extremely\r\ndepressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd wine: I used to think Orvieto so heavenly. But this spring, when I\r\nwent to Italy, it was just a bad muddy sort of Vouvray. And those soft\r\ncaramels they call Fiats; I used to eat those till I was sick. I was at\r\nthe sick stage before I\xe2\x80\x99d finished one of them, this time in Rome.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nViveash shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cDisillusion after disillusion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked down the dark passage into the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cI really haven\xe2\x80\x99t the spirit to do\r\nanything else this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d To the commissionaire who opened the door\r\nof the cab she gave the address of her house in St. James\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill one ever recapture the old thrills?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked rather fatiguedly\r\nas they drove slowly through the traffic of Regent Street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot by chasing after them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, in whom the clown had quite\r\nevaporated. \xe2\x80\x9cIf one sat still enough they might perhaps come back of\r\ntheir own accord....\xe2\x80\x9d There would be the faint sound as it were of feet\r\napproaching through the quiet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t only food,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, who had closed her eyes and was\r\nleaning back in her corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I can well believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s everything. Nothing\xe2\x80\x99s the same now. I feel it never will be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever more,\xe2\x80\x9d croaked Gumbril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever again,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash echoed. \xe2\x80\x9cNever again.\xe2\x80\x9d There were still no\r\ntears behind her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever know Tony Lamb?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril answered from his corner. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash did not answer. What, indeed, about him? She thought of his\r\nvery clear blue eyes and the fair, bright hair that had been lighter\r\nthan his brown face. Brown face and neck, red-brown hands; and all the\r\nrest of his skin was as white as milk. \xe2\x80\x9cI was very fond of him,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid at last. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all. He was killed in 1917, just about this time\r\nof the year. It seems a very long time ago, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it?\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril shrugged his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. The past is\r\nabolished. _Vivamus, mea Lesbia._ If I weren\xe2\x80\x99t so horribly depressed,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d embrace you. That would be some slight compensation for my\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he\r\ntapped his foot with the end of his walking-stick\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmy accident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re depressed too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne should never drink at luncheon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wrecks the\r\nafternoon. One should also never think of the past and never for one\r\nmoment consider the future. These are treasures of ancient wisdom. But\r\nperhaps after a little tea\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He leaned forward to look at the figures\r\non the taximeter, for the cab had come to a standstill\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cafter a nip of\r\nthe tannin stimulant\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he threw open the door\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwe may feel rather\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash smiled excruciatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as she stepped\r\nout on to the pavement, \xe2\x80\x9ceven tannin has lost its virtues now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room was tastefully in the movement. The\r\nfurniture was upholstered in fabrics designed by Dufy\xe2\x80\x94racehorses and\r\nroses, little tennis players clustering in the midst of enormous\r\nflowers, printed in grey and ochre on a white ground. There were a\r\ncouple of lamp-shades by Balla. On the pale rose-stippled walls hung\r\nthree portraits of herself by three different and entirely incongruous\r\npainters, a selection of the usual oranges and lemons, and a rather\r\nforbidding contemporary nude painted in two tones of green.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how bored I am with this room and all these beastly pictures!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexclaimed Mrs. Viveash as she entered. She took off her hat and,\r\nstanding in front of the mirror above the mantelpiece, smoothed her\r\ncoppery hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should take a cottage in the country,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, \xe2\x80\x9cbuy a pony\r\nand a governess cart and drive along the twiddly lanes looking for\r\nflowers. After tea you open the cottage piano,\xe2\x80\x9d and suiting his action\r\nto the words, Gumbril sat down at the long-tailed Bl\xc3\xbcthner, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\r\nplay, you play.\xe2\x80\x9d Very slowly and with parodied expressiveness he played\r\nthe opening theme of the Arietta. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be bored then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nturning round to her, when he had finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd with whom do you propose that\r\nI should share my cottage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny one you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. His fingers hung, as though meditating\r\nover the keys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t like any one,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Viveash with a terrible vehemence\r\nfrom her death-bed.... Ah, now it had been said, the truth. It sounded\r\nlike a joke. Tony had been dead five years now. Those bright blue\r\neyes\xe2\x80\x94ah, never again. All rotted away to nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you should try,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, whose hands had begun to creep\r\nsoftly forward into the Twelfth Sonata. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do try,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. Her elbows propped on the\r\nmantelpiece, her chin resting on her clasped hands, she was looking\r\nfixedly at her own image in the glass. Pale eyes looked unwaveringly\r\ninto pale eyes. The red mouth and its reflection exchanged their smiles\r\nof pain. She had tried; it revolted her now to think how often she had\r\ntried; she had tried to like some one, any one, as much as Tony. She had\r\ntried to recapture, to re-evoke, to revivify. And there had never been\r\nanything, really, but a disgust. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t succeeded,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, after\r\na pause.\r\n\r\nThe music had shifted from F major to D minor; it mounted in leaping\r\nanap\xc3\xa6sts to a suspended chord, ran down again, mounted once more,\r\nmodulating to C minor, then, through a passage of trembling notes to A\r\nflat major, to the dominant of D flat, to the dominant of C, to C minor,\r\nand at last, to a new clear theme in the major.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, allowing his fingers to play on\r\nby themselves. He felt sorry, too, for the subjects of Mrs. Viveash\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndesperate experiments. She mightn\xe2\x80\x99t have succeeded in liking them\xe2\x80\x94for\r\ntheir part, poor devils, they in general only too agonizingly liked\r\nher.... Only too.... He remembered the cold, damp spots on his pillow,\r\nin the darkness. Those hopeless, angry tears. \xe2\x80\x9cYou nearly killed me\r\nonce,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly time kills,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, still looking into her own pale\r\neyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never made any one happy,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, after a pause.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever any one,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, except Tony, and Tony they had killed,\r\nshot him through the head. Even the bright eyes had rotted, like any\r\nother carrion. She too had been happy then. Never again.\r\n\r\nA maid came in with the tea-things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the tannin!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Gumbril with enthusiasm, and broke off his\r\nplaying. \xe2\x80\x9cThe one hope of salvation.\xe2\x80\x9d He poured out two cups, and\r\npicking up one of them he came over to the fireplace and stood behind\r\nher, sipping slowly at the pale brewage and looking over her shoulder at\r\ntheir two reflections in the mirror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_La ci darem_,\xe2\x80\x9d he hummed. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only I had my beard!\xe2\x80\x9d He stroked his\r\nchin and with the tip of his forefinger brushed up the drooping ends of\r\nhis moustache. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d come trembling like Zerlina, in under its golden\r\nshadow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t ask for anything better,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nmore delightful part! _Felice, io so, sarei: Batti, batti, o bel\r\nMazetto._ Enviable Zerlina!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant made another silent entry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9ccalled Mr. Shearwater would like\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him I\xe2\x80\x99m not at home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, without looking round.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. With raised eyebrows Gumbril looked over Mrs.\r\nViveash\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder at her reflection. Her eyes were calm and without\r\nexpression, she did not smile or frown. Gumbril still questioningly\r\nlooked. In the end he began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were playing that latest novelty from across the water, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he\r\nto Hecuba?\xe2\x80\x9d Sweet, sweet and piercing, the saxophone pierced into the\r\nvery bowels of compassion and tenderness, pierced like a revelation from\r\nheaven, pierced like the angel\xe2\x80\x99s treacly dart into the holy Teresa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquivering and ecstasiated flank. More ripely and roundly, with a kindly\r\nand less agonizing voluptuousness, the \xe2\x80\x99cello meditated those Mohammedan\r\necstasies that last, under the green palms of Paradise, six hundred\r\ninenarrable years apiece. Into this charged atmosphere the violin\r\nadmitted refreshing draughts of fresh air, cool and thin like the breath\r\nfrom a still damp squirt. And the piano hammered and rattled away\r\nunmindful of the sensibilities of the other instruments, banged away all\r\nthe time reminding every one concerned, in a thoroughly business-like\r\nway, that this was a cabaret where people came to dance the fox-trot;\r\nnot a baroque church for female saints to go into ecstasies in, not a\r\nmild, happy valley of tumbling houris.\r\n\r\nAt each recurrence of the refrain the four negroes of the orchestra, or\r\nat least the three of them who played with their hands alone\xe2\x80\x94for the\r\nsaxophonist always blew at this point with a redoubled sweetness,\r\nenriching the passage with a warbling contrapuntal soliloquy that fairly\r\nwrung the entrails and transported the pierced heart\xe2\x80\x94broke into\r\nmelancholy and drawling song:\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he to Hecuba?\r\n          Nothing at all.\r\n          That\xe2\x80\x99s why there\xe2\x80\x99ll be no wedding on Wednesday week,\r\n          Way down in old Bengal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat unspeakable sadness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, as he stepped, stepped through\r\nthe intricacies of the trot. \xe2\x80\x9cEternal passion, eternal pain. _Les chants\r\nd\xc3\xa9sesper\xc3\xa9s sont les chants les plus beaux, Et j\xe2\x80\x99en sais d\xe2\x80\x99immortels qui\r\nsont de purs sanglots._ Rum tiddle-um-tum, pom-pom. Amen. What\xe2\x80\x99s he to\r\nHecuba? Nothing at all. Nothing, mark you. Nothing, nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cI know all about that.\xe2\x80\x9d She sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am nothing to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, gliding with skill between the wall\r\nand the Charybdis of a couple dangerously experimenting with a new step.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are nothing to me. Thank God. And yet here we are, two bodies with\r\nbut a single thought, a beast with two backs, a perfectly united centaur\r\ntrotting, trotting.\xe2\x80\x9d They trotted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he to Hecuba?\xe2\x80\x9d The grinning blackamoors repeated the question,\r\nreiterated the answer on a tone of frightful unhappiness. The saxophone\r\nwarbled on the verge of anguish. The couples revolved, marked time,\r\nstepped and stepped with an habitual precision, as though performing\r\nsome ancient and profoundly significant rite. Some were in fancy dress,\r\nfor this was a gala night at the cabaret. Young women disguised as\r\ncallipygous Florentine pages, blue-breeched Gondoliers, black-breeched\r\nToreadors circulated, moon-like, round the hall, clasped sometimes in\r\nthe arms of Arabs, or white clowns, or more often of untravestied\r\npartners. The faces reflected in the mirrors were the sort of faces one\r\nfeels one ought to know by sight; the cabaret was \xe2\x80\x98Artistic.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he to Hecuba?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash murmured the response, almost piously, as though she were\r\nworshipping almighty and omnipresent Nil. \xe2\x80\x9cI adore this tune,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthis divine tune.\xe2\x80\x9d It filled up a space, it moved, it jigged, it set\r\nthings twitching in you, it occupied time, it gave you a sense of being\r\nalive. \xe2\x80\x9cDivine tune, divine tune,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated with emphasis, and she\r\nshut her eyes, trying to abandon herself, trying to float, trying to\r\ngive Nil the slip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRavishing little Toreador, that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, who had been following\r\nthe black-breeched travesty with affectionate interest.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash opened her eyes. Nil was unescapable. \xe2\x80\x9cWith Piers Cotton,\r\nyou mean? Your tastes are a little common, my dear Theodore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreen-eyed monster!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was being \xe2\x80\x98finished\xe2\x80\x99 in Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle always used to urge me to take fencing lessons. _C\xe2\x80\x99est un\r\nexercice tr\xc3\xa8s gracieux. Et puis_,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash mimicked a passionate\r\nearnestness, \xe2\x80\x9c_et puis, \xc3\xa7a d\xc3\xa9velope le bassin_. Your Toreador, Gumbril,\r\nlooks as though she must be a champion with the foils. _Quel bassin!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. They were abreast of the Toreador and her partner.\r\nPiers Cotton turned his long greyhound\xe2\x80\x99s nose in their direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked across the music.\r\n\r\nThey nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, writing such a book,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Piers Cotton, \xe2\x80\x9csuch a brilliant,\r\nbrilliant, flashing book.\xe2\x80\x9d The dance was carrying them apart. \xe2\x80\x9cLike a\r\nsmile of false teeth,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted across the widening gulf, and\r\ndisappeared in the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he to Hecuba?\xe2\x80\x9d Lachrymosely, the hilarious blackamoors chanted\r\ntheir question, mournfully pregnant with its foreknown reply.\r\n\r\nNil, omnipresent nil, world-soul, spiritual informer of all matter. Nil\r\nin the shape of a black-breeched moon-basined Toreador. Nil, the man\r\nwith the greyhound\xe2\x80\x99s nose. Nil, as four blackamoors. Nil in the form of\r\na divine tune. Nil, the faces, the faces one ought to know by sight,\r\nreflected in the mirrors of the hall. Nil this Gumbril whose arm is\r\nround one\xe2\x80\x99s waist, whose feet step in and out among one\xe2\x80\x99s own. Nothing\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s why there\xe2\x80\x99ll be no wedding. No wedding at St. George\xe2\x80\x99s, Hanover\r\nSquare,\xe2\x80\x94oh, desperate experiment!\xe2\x80\x94with Nil Viveash, that charming boy,\r\nthat charming nothing at all, engaged at the moment in hunting\r\nelephants, hunting fever and carnivores among the Tikki-tikki pygmies.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s why there\xe2\x80\x99ll be no wedding on Wednesday week. For Lycidas is\r\ndead, dead ere his prime. For the light strawy hair (not a lock left),\r\nthe brown face, the red-brown hands and the smooth boy\xe2\x80\x99s body,\r\nmilk-white, milk-warm, are nothing at all, nothing, now, at all\xe2\x80\x94nil\r\nthese five years\xe2\x80\x94and the shining blue eyes as much nil as the rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways the same people,\xe2\x80\x9d complained Mrs. Viveash, looking round the\r\nroom. \xe2\x80\x9cThe old familiar faces. Never any one new. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the younger\r\ngeneration, Gumbril? We\xe2\x80\x99re old, Theodore. There are millions younger\r\nthan we are. Where are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not responsible for them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not even responsible\r\nfor myself.\xe2\x80\x9d He imagined a cottagey room, under the roof, with a window\r\nnear the floor and a sloping ceiling where you were always bumping your\r\nhead; and in the candlelight Emily\xe2\x80\x99s candid eyes, her grave and happy\r\nmouth; in the darkness, the curve, under his fingers, of her firm body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t they come and sing for their supper?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash went on\r\npetulantly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s their business to amuse us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re probably thinking of amusing themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, they should do it where we can see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he to Hecuba?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril clownishly sang. The room, in the cottage, had\r\nnothing to do with him. He breathed Mrs. Viveash\xe2\x80\x99s memories of Italian\r\njasmines, laid his cheek for a moment against her smooth hair. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing\r\nat all.\xe2\x80\x9d Happy clown!\r\n\r\nWay down in old Bengal, under the green Paradisiac palms, among the\r\necstatic mystagogues and the saints who scream beneath the divine\r\ncaresses, the music came to an end. The four negroes wiped their\r\nglistening faces. The couples fell apart. Gumbril and Mrs. Viveash sat\r\ndown and smoked a cigarette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe blackamoors had left the platform at the end of the hall. The\r\ncurtains looped up at either side had slid down, cutting it off from the\r\nrest of the room\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmaking two worlds,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril elegantly and allusively\r\nput it, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere only one grew before\xe2\x80\x94and one of them a better world,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded too philosophically, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause unreal.\xe2\x80\x9d There was the theatrical\r\nsilence, the suspense. The curtains parted again.\r\n\r\n  On a narrow bed\xe2\x80\x94on a bier perhaps\xe2\x80\x94the corpse of a woman. The husband\r\n  kneels beside it. At the foot stands the doctor, putting away his\r\n  instruments. In a beribboned pink cradle reposes a monstrous baby.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: Margaret! Margaret!\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: She is dead.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: Margaret!\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: Of septic\xc3\xa6mia, I tell you.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: I wish that I too were dead!\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: But you won\xe2\x80\x99t to-morrow.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: To-morrow! But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to live to see to-morrow.\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: You will to-morrow.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: Margaret! Margaret! Wait for me there; I shall not fail\r\n  to meet you in that hollow vale.\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: You will not be slow to survive her.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: Christ have mercy upon us!\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: You would do better to think of the child.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND (_rising and standing menacingly over the cradle_): Is\r\n  that the monster?\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: No worse than others.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: Begotten in a night of immaculate pleasure, monster,\r\n  may you live loveless, in dirt and impurity!\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: Conceived in lust and darkness, may your own impurity\r\n  always seem heavenly, monster, in your own eyes!\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: Murderer, slowly die all your life long!\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: The child must be fed.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: Fed? With what?\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: With milk.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: Her milk is cold in her breasts.\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: There are still cows.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: Tubercular shorthorns. (_Calling._) Let\r\n  Short-i\xe2\x80\x99-the-horn be brought!\r\n\r\n  VOICES (_off_): Short-i\xe2\x80\x99-the-horn! Short-i\xe2\x80\x99-the-horn! (_Fadingly_)\r\n  Short-i\xe2\x80\x99-the....\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: In nineteen hundred and twenty-one, twenty-seven\r\n  thousand nine hundred and thirteen women died in childbirth.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: But none of them belonged to my harem.\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: Each of them was somebody\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: Doubtless. But the people we don\xe2\x80\x99t know are only\r\n  characters in the human comedy. We are the tragedians.\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: Not in the spectator\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: Do I think of the spectators? Ah, Margaret!\r\n  Margaret!...\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: The twenty-seven thousand nine hundred and fourteenth.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: The only one!\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: But here comes the cow.\r\n\r\n  (_Short-i\xe2\x80\x99-the-horn is led in by a Yokel._)\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: Ah, good Short-i\xe2\x80\x99-the-horn! (_He pats the animal._) She\r\n  was tested last week, was she not?\r\n\r\n  THE YOKEL: Ay, sir.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: And found tubercular. No?\r\n\r\n  THE YOKEL: Even in the udders, may it please you.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: Excellent! Milk me the cow, sir, into this dirty\r\n  wash-pot.\r\n\r\n  THE YOKEL: I will, sir. (_He milks the cow._)\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: Her milk\xe2\x80\x94her milk is cold already. All the woman in her\r\n  chilled and curdled within her breasts. Ah, Jesus! what miraculous\r\n  galactagogue will make it flow again?\r\n\r\n  THE YOKEL: The wash-pot is full, sir.\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND: Then take the cow away.\r\n\r\n  THE YOKEL: Come, Short-i\xe2\x80\x99-the-horn; come up, good Short-i\xe2\x80\x99-the-horn.\r\n  (_He goes out with the cow._)\r\n\r\n  THE HUSBAND (_pouring the milk into a long-tubed feeding-bottle_):\r\n  Here\xe2\x80\x99s for you, monster, to drink your own health in. (_He gives the\r\n  bottle to the child._)\r\n\r\n  CURTAIN.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little ponderous, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, as the curtain came down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I liked the cow.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash opened her cigarette-case and found\r\nit empty. Gumbril offered her one of his. She shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant it in the least,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the cow was in the best pantomime tradition,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril agreed. Ah!\r\nbut it was a long time since he had been to a Christmas pantomime. Not\r\nsince Dan Leno\xe2\x80\x99s days. All the little cousins, the uncles and aunts on\r\nboth sides of the family, dozens and dozens of them\xe2\x80\x94every year they\r\nfilled the best part of a row in the dress circle at Drury Lane. And\r\nbuns were stickily passed from hand to hand, chocolates circulated; the\r\ngrown-ups drank tea. And the pantomime went on and on, glory after\r\nglory, under the shining arch of the stage. Hours and hours; and the\r\ngrown-ups always wanted to go away before the harlequinade. And the\r\nchildren felt sick from eating too much chocolate, or wanted with such\r\nextreme urgency to go to the w.c. that they had to be led out, trampling\r\nand stumbling over everybody else\xe2\x80\x99s feet\xe2\x80\x94and every stumble making the\r\nneed more agonizingly great\xe2\x80\x94in the middle of the transformation scene.\r\nAnd there was Dan Leno, inimitable Dan Leno, dead now as poor Yorick, no\r\nmore than a mere skull like anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s skull. And his mother, he\r\nremembered, used to laugh at him sometimes till the tears ran down her\r\ncheeks. She used to enjoy things thoroughly, with a whole heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish they\xe2\x80\x99d hurry up with the second scene,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s anything that bores me, it\xe2\x80\x99s _entr\xe2\x80\x99actes_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost of one\xe2\x80\x99s life is an _entr\xe2\x80\x99acte_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, whose present mood\r\nof hilarious depression seemed favourable to the enunciation of\r\napophthegms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of your cracker mottoes, please,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Mrs. Viveash. All the\r\nsame, she reflected, what was she doing now but waiting for the curtain\r\nto go up again, waiting, with what unspeakable weariness of spirit, for\r\nthe curtain that had rung down, ten centuries ago, on those blue eyes,\r\nthat bright strawy hair and the weathered face?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with an expiring earnestness, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s the second\r\nscene!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  The curtain went up. In a bald room stood the Monster, grown now\r\n  from an infant into a frail and bent young man with bandy legs. At\r\n  the back of the stage a large window giving on to a street along\r\n  which people pass.\r\n\r\n  THE MONSTER (_solus_): The young girls of Sparta, they say, used to\r\n  wrestle naked with naked Spartan boys. The sun caressed their skins\r\n  till they were brown and transparent like amber or a flask of olive\r\n  oil. Their breasts were hard, their bellies flat. They were pure\r\n  with the chastity of beautiful animals. Their thoughts were clear,\r\n  their minds cool and untroubled. I spit blood into my handkerchief\r\n  and sometimes I feel in my mouth something slimy, soft and\r\n  disgusting, like a slug\xe2\x80\x94and I have coughed up a shred of my lung.\r\n  The rickets from which I suffered in childhood have bent my bones\r\n  and made them old and brittle. All my life I have lived in this huge\r\n  town, whose domes and spires are wrapped in a cloud of stink that\r\n  hides the sun. The slug-dank tatters of lung that I spit out are\r\n  black with the soot I have been breathing all these years. I am now\r\n  come of age. Long-expected one-and-twenty has made me a fully\r\n  privileged citizen of this great realm of which the owners of the\r\n  _Daily Mirror_, the _News of the World_ and the _Daily Express_ are\r\n  noble peers. Somewhere, I must logically infer, there must be other\r\n  cities, built by men for men to live in. Somewhere, in the past, in\r\n  the future, a very long way off.... But perhaps the only street\r\n  improvement schemes that ever really improve the streets are schemes\r\n  in the minds of those who live in them: schemes of love mostly. Ah!\r\n  here she comes.\r\n\r\n    (_The_ YOUNG LADY _enters. She stands outside the window, in the\r\n    street, paying no attention to the_ MONSTER; _she seems to be\r\n    waiting for somebody._)\r\n\r\n  She is like a pear tree in flower. When she smiles, it is as though\r\n  there were stars. Her hair is like the harvest in an eclogue, her\r\n  cheeks are all the fruits of summer. Her arms and thighs are as\r\n  beautiful as the soul of St. Catherine of Siena. And her eyes, her\r\n  eyes are plumbless with thought and limpidly pure like the water of\r\n  the mountains.\r\n\r\n  THE YOUNG LADY: If I wait till the summer sale, the cr\xc3\xaape de Chine\r\n  will be reduced by at least two shillings a yard, and on six\r\n  camisoles that will mean a lot of money. But the question is: can I\r\n  go from May till the end of July with the underclothing I have now?\r\n\r\n  THE MONSTER: If I knew her, I should know the universe!\r\n\r\n  THE YOUNG LADY: My present ones are so dreadfully middle-class. And\r\n  if Roger should ... by any chance....\r\n\r\n  THE MONSTER: Or, rather, I should be able to ignore it, having a\r\n  private universe of my own.\r\n\r\n  THE YOUNG LADY: If\xe2\x80\x94if he did\xe2\x80\x94well, it might be rather humiliating\r\n  with these I have ... like a servant\xe2\x80\x99s almost....\r\n\r\n  THE MONSTER: Love makes you accept the world; it puts an end to\r\n  criticism.\r\n\r\n  THE YOUNG LADY: His hand already....\r\n\r\n  THE MONSTER: Dare I, dare I tell her how beautiful she is?\r\n\r\n  THE YOUNG LADY: On the whole, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d better get it now, though\r\n  it will cost more.\r\n\r\n  THE MONSTER (_desperately advancing to the window as though to\r\n  assault a battery_): Beautiful! beautiful!\r\n\r\n  THE YOUNG LADY (_looking at him_): Ha, ha, ha!\r\n\r\n  THE MONSTER: But I love you, flowering pear tree; I love you, golden\r\n  harvest; I love you, fruitage of summer; I love you, body and limbs,\r\n  with the shape of a saint\xe2\x80\x99s thought.\r\n\r\n  THE YOUNG LADY (_redoubles her laughter_): Ha, ha, ha!\r\n\r\n  THE MONSTER (_taking her hand_): You cannot be cruel! (_He is seized\r\n  with a violent paroxysm of coughing which doubles him up, which\r\n  shakes and torments him. The handkerchief he holds to his mouth is\r\n  spotted with blood._)\r\n\r\n  THE YOUNG LADY: You disgust me! (_She draws away her skirts so that\r\n  they shall not come in contact with him._)\r\n\r\n  THE MONSTER: But I swear to you, I love\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 (_He is once more\r\n  interrupted by his cough._)\r\n\r\n  THE YOUNG LADY: Please go away. (_In a different voice_) Ah, Roger!\r\n  (_She advances to meet a snub-nosed lubber with curly hair and a\r\n  face like a groom\xe2\x80\x99s, who passes along the street at this moment._)\r\n\r\n  ROGER: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the motor-bike waiting at the corner.\r\n\r\n  THE YOUNG LADY: Let\xe2\x80\x99s go, then.\r\n\r\n  ROGER (_pointing to the_ MONSTER): What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\r\n\r\n  THE YOUNG LADY: Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in particular.\r\n\r\n    (_Both roar with laughter._ ROGER _escorts her out, patting her\r\n      familiarly on the back as they walk along._)\r\n\r\n  THE MONSTER (_looking after her_): There is a wound under my left\r\n  pap. She has deflowered all women. I cannot....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Mrs. Viveash, \xe2\x80\x9chow this young man bores me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gumbril, \xe2\x80\x9cI have rather a taste for moralities.\r\nThere is a pleasant uplifting vagueness about these symbolical\r\ngeneralized figures which pleases me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were always charmingly simple-minded,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99s this? As long as the young man isn\xe2\x80\x99t left alone on the stage, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  Another female figure has appeared in the street beyond the window. It\r\n    is the Prostitute. Her face, painted in two tones of red, white,\r\n    green, blue and black, is the most tasteful of _nature-mortes_.\r\n\r\n  THE PROSTITUTE: Hullo, duckie!\r\n\r\n  THE MONSTER: Hullo!\r\n\r\n  THE PROSTITUTE: Are you lonely?\r\n\r\n  THE MONSTER: Yes.\r\n\r\n  THE PROSTITUTE: Would you like me to come in to see you?\r\n\r\n  THE MONSTER: Very well.\r\n\r\n  THE PROSTITUTE: Shall we say thirty bob?\r\n\r\n  THE MONSTER: As you like.\r\n\r\n  THE PROSTITUTE: Come along then.\r\n\r\n    (_She climbs through the window and they go off together through\r\n      the door on the left of the stage. The curtains descend for a\r\n      moment, then rise again. The_ MONSTER _and the_ PROSTITUTE _are\r\n      seen issuing from the door at which they went out._)\r\n\r\n    THE MONSTER (_taking out a cheque-book and a fountain pen_):\r\n    Thirty shillings....\r\n\r\n    THE PROSTITUTE: Thank you. Not a cheque. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any cheques.\r\n    How do I know it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a dud one that they\xe2\x80\x99ll refuse payment for\r\n    at the bank? Ready money for me, thanks.\r\n\r\n    THE MONSTER: But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any cash on me at the moment.\r\n\r\n    THE PROSTITUTE: Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t take a cheque. Once bitten, twice\r\n    shy, I can tell you.\r\n\r\n    THE MONSTER: But I tell you I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any cash.\r\n\r\n    THE PROSTITUTE: Well, all I can say is, here I stay till I get it.\r\n    And, what\xe2\x80\x99s more, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it quick, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a row.\r\n\r\n    THE MONSTER: But this is absurd. I offer you a perfectly good\r\n    cheque....\r\n\r\n    THE PROSTITUTE: And I won\xe2\x80\x99t take it. So there!\r\n\r\n    THE MONSTER: Well then, take my watch. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth more than thirty\r\n    bob. (_He pulls out his gold half-hunter._)\r\n\r\n    THE PROSTITUTE: Thank you, and get myself arrested as soon as I\r\n    take it to the pop-shop! No, I want cash, I tell you.\r\n\r\n    THE MONSTER: But where the devil do you expect me to get it at\r\n    this time of night?\r\n\r\n    THE PROSTITUTE: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get it pretty\r\n    quick.\r\n\r\n    THE MONSTER: You\xe2\x80\x99re unreasonable.\r\n\r\n    THE PROSTITUTE: Aren\xe2\x80\x99t there any servants in this house?\r\n\r\n    THE MONSTER: Yes.\r\n\r\n    THE PROSTITUTE: Well, go and borrow it from one of them.\r\n\r\n    THE MONSTER: But really, that would be too low, too humiliating.\r\n\r\n    THE PROSTITUTE: All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll begin kicking up a noise. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\n    to the window and yell till all the neighbours are woken up and\r\n    the police come to see what\xe2\x80\x99s up. You can borrow it from the\r\n    copper then.\r\n\r\n    THE MONSTER: You really won\xe2\x80\x99t take my cheque? I swear to you it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n    perfectly all right. There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of money to meet it.\r\n\r\n    THE PROSTITUTE: Oh, shut up! No more dilly-dallying. Get me my\r\n    money at once, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll start the row. One, two, three.... (_She\r\n    opens her mouth wide as if to yell._)\r\n\r\n    THE MONSTER: All right. (_He goes out._)\r\n\r\n    THE PROSTITUTE: Nice state of things we\xe2\x80\x99re coming to, when young\r\n    rips try and swindle us poor girls out of our money! Mean,\r\n    stinking skunks! I\xe2\x80\x99d like to slit the throats of some of them.\r\n\r\n    THE MONSTER (_coming back again_): Here you are. (_He hands her\r\n    money._)\r\n\r\n    THE PROSTITUTE (_examining it_): Thank you, dearie. Any other time\r\n    you\xe2\x80\x99re lonely....\r\n\r\n    THE MONSTER: No, no!\r\n\r\n    THE PROSTITUTE: Where did you get it finally?\r\n\r\n    THE MONSTER: I woke the cook.\r\n\r\n    THE PROSTITUTE (_goes off into a peal of laughter_): Well, so\r\n    long, duckie. (_She goes out._)\r\n\r\n    THE MONSTER (_solus_): Somewhere there must be love like music.\r\n    Love harmonious and ordered: two spirits, two bodies moving\r\n    contrapuntally together. Somewhere, the stupid brutish act must be\r\n    made to make sense, must be enriched, must be made significant.\r\n    Lust, like Diabelli\xe2\x80\x99s waltz, a stupid air, turned by a genius into\r\n    three-and-thirty fabulous variations. Somewhere....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming!\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril protested.\r\n\r\n  ... love like sheets of silky flame; like landscapes brilliant in\r\n  the sunlight against a background of purple thunder; like the\r\n  solution of a cosmic problem; like faith....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrikey!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n  ... Somewhere, somewhere. But in my veins creep the maggots of the\r\n  pox....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, really!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cToo medical!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  ... crawling towards the brain, crawling into the mouth, burrowing\r\n  into the bones. Insatiably.\r\n\r\n  The Monster threw himself to the ground, and the curtain came down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd about time too!\xe2\x80\x9d declared Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming!\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril stuck to his guns. \xe2\x80\x9cCharming! charming!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a disturbance near the door. Mrs. Viveash looked round to see\r\nwhat was happening. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now on top of it all,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9chere comes\r\nColeman, raving, with an unknown drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave we missed it?\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman was shouting. \xe2\x80\x9cHave we missed all the\r\nlovely bloody farce?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLovely bloody!\xe2\x80\x9d his companion repeated with drunken raptures, and he\r\nwent into fits of uncontrollable laughter. He was a very young boy with\r\nstraight dark hair and a face of Hellenic beauty, now distorted with\r\ntipsiness.\r\n\r\nColeman greeted his acquaintances in the hall, shouting a jovial\r\nobscenity to each. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Bumbril-Gumbril,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, catching sight\r\nof him at last in the front row. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Hetaira-Myra!\xe2\x80\x9d He pushed his way\r\nthrough the crowd, followed unsteadily by his young disciple. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, standing over them and looking down with an enigmatic\r\nmalice in his bright blue eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the physiologue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I the physiologue\xe2\x80\x99s keeper?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s with his glands\r\nand his hormones, I suppose. Not to mention his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere the hormones, there moan I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman, skidding off sideways\r\nalong the slippery word. \xe2\x80\x9cI hear, by the way, that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lovely\r\nprostitute in this play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve missed her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a misfortune,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve missed the delicious trull,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, turning to the young man.\r\n\r\nThe young man only laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me introduce, by the way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is Dante,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\npointed to the dark-haired boy; \xe2\x80\x9cand I am Virgil. We\xe2\x80\x99re making a round\r\ntour\xe2\x80\x94or, rather, a descending spiral tour of hell. But we\xe2\x80\x99re only at the\r\nfirst circle so far. These, Alighieri, are two damned souls, though not,\r\nas you might suppose, Paolo and Francesca.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy continued to laugh, happily and uncomprehendingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother of these interminable _entr\xe2\x80\x99actes_,\xe2\x80\x9d complained Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just saying to Theodore here that if there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I dislike\r\nmore than another, it\xe2\x80\x99s a long _entr\xe2\x80\x99acte_.\xe2\x80\x9d Would hers ever come to an\r\nend?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing _I_ dislike more than another,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy,\r\nbreaking silence for the first time, with an air of the greatest\r\nearnestness, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s ... it\xe2\x80\x99s one thing more than another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re perfectly right in doing so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman. \xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy replied modestly.\r\n\r\n  When the curtain rose again it was on an aged Monster, with a black\r\n  patch over the left side of his nose, no hair, no teeth, and sitting\r\n  harmlessly behind the bars of an asylum.\r\n\r\n  THE MONSTER: Asses, apes and dogs! Milton called them that; he\r\n  should have known. Somewhere there must be men, however. The\r\n  variations on Diabelli prove it. Brunelleschi\xe2\x80\x99s dome is more than\r\n  the magnification of Cl\xc3\xa9o de M\xc3\xa9rode\xe2\x80\x99s breast. Somewhere there are\r\n  men with power, living reasonably. Like our mythical Greeks and\r\n  Romans. Living cleanly. The images of the gods are their portraits.\r\n  They walk under their own protection. (_The_ MONSTER _climbs on to a\r\n  chair and stands in the posture of a statue_.) Jupiter, father of\r\n  gods, a man, I bless myself, I throw bolts at my own disobedience, I\r\n  answer my own prayers, I pronounce oracles to satisfy the questions\r\n  I myself propound. I abolish all tetters, poxes, blood-spitting,\r\n  rotting of bones. With love I recreate the world from within. Europa\r\n  puts an end to squalor, Leda does away with tyranny, Danae tempers\r\n  stupidity. After establishing these reforms in the social sewer, I\r\n  climb, I climb, up through the manhole, out of the manhole, beyond\r\n  humanity. For the manhole, even the manhole, is dark; though not so\r\n  dingy as the doghole it was before I altered it. Up through the\r\n  manhole, towards the air. Up, up! (_And the_ MONSTER, _suiting the\r\n  action to his words, climbs up the runged back of his chair and\r\n  stands, by a miraculous feat of acrobacy, on the topmost bar_.) I\r\n  begin to see the stars through other eyes than my own. More than dog\r\n  already, I become more than man. I begin to have inklings of the\r\n  shape and sense of things. Upwards, upwards I strain, I peer, I\r\n  reach aloft. (_The balanced_ MONSTER _reaches, strains and peers_.)\r\n  And I seize, I seize! (_As he shouts these words, the_ MONSTER\r\n  _falls heavily, head foremost, to the floor. He lies there quite\r\n  still. After a little time the door opens and the_ DOCTOR _of the\r\n  first scene enters with a_ WARDER.)\r\n\r\n  THE WARDER: I heard a crash.\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR (_who has by this time become immensely old and has a\r\n  beard like Father Thames_): It looks as though you were right. (_He\r\n  examines the_ MONSTER.)\r\n\r\n  THE WARDER: He was for ever climbing on to his chair.\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: Well, he won\xe2\x80\x99t any more. His neck\xe2\x80\x99s broken.\r\n\r\n  THE WARDER: You don\xe2\x80\x99t say so?\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: I do.\r\n\r\n  THE WARDER: Well, I never!\r\n\r\n  THE DOCTOR: Have it carried down to the dissecting-room.\r\n\r\n  THE WARDER: I\xe2\x80\x99ll send for the porters at once.\r\n\r\n  (_Exeunt severally, and_ CURTAIN.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad that\xe2\x80\x99s over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe music struck up again, saxophone and \xe2\x80\x99cello, with the thin draught\r\nof the violin to cool their ecstasies and the thumping piano to remind\r\nthem of business. Gumbril and Mrs. Viveash slid out into the dancing\r\ncrowd, revolving as though by force of habit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese substitutes for the genuine copulative article,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman to\r\nhis disciple, \xe2\x80\x9care beneath the dignity of hell-hounds like you and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharmed, the young man laughed; he was attentive as though at the feet\r\nof Socrates. Coleman had found him in a night club, where he had gone in\r\nsearch of Zoe, found him very drunk in the company of two formidable\r\nwomen fifteen or twenty years his senior, who were looking after him,\r\nhalf maternally out of pure kindness of heart, half professionally; for\r\nhe seemed to be carrying a good deal of money. He was incapable of\r\nlooking after himself. Coleman had pounced on him at once, claimed an\r\nold friendship which the youth was too tipsy to be able to deny, and\r\ncarried him off. There was something, he always thought, peculiarly\r\ninteresting about the spectacle of children tobogganing down into the\r\ncesspools.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like this place,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTastes differ!\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman shrugged his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cThe German professors\r\nhave catalogued thousands of people whose whole pleasure consists in\r\neating dung.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man smiled and nodded, rather vaguely. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything to\r\ndrink here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo respectable,\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman answered, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think this is a bloody place,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but some people like blood. And some like boots. And some like long\r\ngloves and corsets. And some like birch-rods. And some like sliding down\r\nslopes and can\xe2\x80\x99t look at Michelangelo\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Night\xe2\x80\x99 on the Medici Tombs\r\nwithout dying the little death, because the statue seems to be sliding.\r\nAnd some....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I want something to drink,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted the young man.\r\n\r\nColeman stamped his feet, waved his arms. \xe2\x80\x9c_\xc3\x80 boire! \xc3\xa0 boire!_\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nshouted, like the newborn Gargantua. Nobody paid any attention.\r\n\r\nThe music came to an end. Gumbril and Mrs. Viveash reappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDante,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman, \xe2\x80\x9ccalls for drink. We must leave the building.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Anything to get out of this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ntime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril looked at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cHalf-past one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t possibly go to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor another\r\nhour at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked out into the street. The stars were large and brilliant\r\noverhead. There was a little wind that almost seemed to come from the\r\ncountry. Gumbril thought so, at any rate; he thought of the country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe question is, where?\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can come to my bordello, if\r\nyou like; but it\xe2\x80\x99s a long way off and Zoe hates us all so much, she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nprobably set on us with the meat-chopper. If she\xe2\x80\x99s back again, that is.\r\nThough she may be out all night. _Zoe mou, sas agapo._ Shall we risk\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo me it\xe2\x80\x99s quite indifferent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash faintly, as though\r\nwholly preoccupied with expiring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr there\xe2\x80\x99s my place,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril said abruptly, as though shaking himself\r\nawake out of some dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you live still farther, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman. \xe2\x80\x9cWith venerable\r\nparents, and so forth. One foot in the grave and all that. Shall we\r\nmingle hornpipes with funerals?\xe2\x80\x9d He began to hum Chopin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Funeral\r\nMarch\xe2\x80\x99 at three times its proper speed, and seizing the young stranger\r\nin his arms, two-stepped two or three turns on the pavement, then\r\nreleased his hold and let him go reeling against the area railings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean the family mansion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean my own\r\nrooms. They\xe2\x80\x99re quite near. In Great Russell Street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never knew you had any rooms, Theodore,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody did.\xe2\x80\x9d Why should they know now? Because the wind seemed almost a\r\ncountry wind? \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s drink there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSplendid!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young man. They were all splendid people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s some gin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapital aphrodisiac!\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman commented.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome light white wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiuretic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd some whisky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe great emetic,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on.\xe2\x80\x9d And he struck up the March\r\nof the Fascisti. \xe2\x80\x9c_Giovinezza, giovinezza, primavera di bellezza_....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe noise went fading down the dark, empty streets.\r\n\r\nThe gin, the white wine, and even, for the sake of the young stranger,\r\nwho wanted to sample everything, the emetic whisky, were produced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like your rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, looking round her. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I resent\r\nyour secrecy about them, Theodore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrink, puppy!\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman refilled the boy\xe2\x80\x99s glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s to secrecy,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril proposed. Shut it tightly, keep it dark,\r\ncover it up. Be silent, prevaricate, lie outright. He laughed and drank.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthose instructive advertisements of\r\nEno\xe2\x80\x99s Fruit Salt they used to have when we were young? There was one\r\nlittle anecdote about a doctor who advised the hypochondriacal patient\r\nwho had come to consult him, to go and see Grimaldi, the clown; and the\r\npatient answered, \xe2\x80\x98I am Grimaldi.\xe2\x80\x99 Do you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Or rather, I do know,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril corrected himself, and\r\nlaughed again.\r\n\r\nThe young man suddenly began to boast. \xe2\x80\x9cI lost two hundred pounds\r\nyesterday playing _chemin de fer_,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and looked round for\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nColeman patted his curly head. \xe2\x80\x9cDelicious child!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\npositively Hogarthian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAngrily, the boy pushed him away. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted; then\r\nturned and addressed himself once more to the others. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford\r\nit, you know\xe2\x80\x94not a bloody penny of it. Not my money, either.\xe2\x80\x9d He seemed\r\nto find it exquisitely humorous. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that two hundred wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, almost expiring with mirth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell Coleman how you borrowed his beard, Theodore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril was looking intently into his glass, as though he hoped to see\r\nin its pale mixture of gin and Sauterne visions, as in a crystal, of the\r\nfuture. Mrs. Viveash touched him on the arm and repeated her injunction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril rather irritably. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t an interesting\r\nstory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, it is! I insist,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, commanding peremptorily\r\nfrom her death-bed.\r\n\r\nGumbril drank his gin and Sauterne. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nreluctantly, and began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what my governor will say,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man put in once or\r\ntwice. But nobody paid any attention to him. He relapsed into a sulky\r\nand, it seemed to him, very dignified silence. Under the warm, jolly\r\ntipsiness he felt a chill of foreboding. He poured out some more whisky.\r\n\r\nGumbril warmed to his anecdote. Expiringly Mrs. Viveash laughed from\r\ntime to time, or smiled her agonizing smile. Coleman whooped like a\r\nRedskin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd after the concert to these rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\nWell, let everything go. Into the mud. Leave it there, and let the dogs\r\nlift their hind legs over it as they pass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! the genuine platonic fumblers,\xe2\x80\x9d commented Coleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Grimaldi,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril laughed. Further than this it was difficult to\r\nsee where the joke could go. There, on the couch, where Mrs. Viveash and\r\nColeman were now sitting, she had lain sleeping in his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTowsing, in Elizabethan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman.\r\n\r\nUnreal, eternal in the secret darkness. A night that was an eternal\r\nparenthesis among the other nights and days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be sick,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man suddenly. He had\r\nwanted to go on silently and haughtily sulking; but his stomach declined\r\nto take part in the dignified game.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, and jumped up. But before he could do\r\nanything effective, the young man had fulfilled his own prophecy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe real charm about debauchery,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman philosophically, \xe2\x80\x9cis its\r\ntotal pointlessness, futility, and above all its incredible tediousness.\r\nIf it really were all roses and exhilaration, as these poor children\r\nseem to imagine, it would be no better than going to church or studying\r\nthe higher mathematics. I should never touch a drop of wine or another\r\nharlot again. It would be against my principles. I told you it was\r\nemetic,\xe2\x80\x9d he called to the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are your principles?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, strictly ethical,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for this creature,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, pointing to the\r\nyoung man, who was sitting on the floor near the fireplace, cooling his\r\nforehead against the marble of the mantelpiece. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must take him away.\r\nReally, what a bore!\xe2\x80\x9d His nose and mouth were all wrinkled up with\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d the young man whispered. He kept his eyes shut and his face\r\nwas exceedingly pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut with pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the\r\nyoung man, \xe2\x80\x9cand where do you live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Porteous,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood lord!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Gumbril, letting himself fall on to the couch beside\r\nMrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the last straw!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two o\xe2\x80\x99clock snorted out of Charing Cross, but no healths were drunk,\r\nthis time, to Viscount Lascelles. A desiccating sobriety made arid the\r\ncorner of the third-class carriage in which Gumbril was sitting. His\r\nthoughts were an interminable desert of sand, with not a palm in sight,\r\nnot so much as a comforting mirage. Once again he fumbled in his\r\nbreast-pocket, brought out and unfolded the flimsy paper. Once more he\r\nread. How many times had he read before?\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cYour telegram made me very unhappy. Not merely because of the\r\n  accident\xe2\x80\x94though it made me shudder to think that something terrible\r\n  might have happened, poor darling\xe2\x80\x94but also, selfishly, my own\r\n  disappointment. I had looked forward so much. I had made a picture\r\n  of it all so clearly. I should have met you at the station with the\r\n  horse and trap from the Chequers, and we\xe2\x80\x99d have driven back to the\r\n  cottage\xe2\x80\x94and you\xe2\x80\x99d have loved the cottage. We\xe2\x80\x99d have had tea and I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n  have made you eat an egg with it after your journey. Then we\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\n  gone for a walk; through the most heavenly wood I found yesterday to\r\n  a place where there\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful view\xe2\x80\x94miles and miles of it. And\r\n  we\xe2\x80\x99d have wandered on and on, and sat down under the trees, and the\r\n  sun would have set, and the twilight would slowly have come to an\r\n  end, and we\xe2\x80\x99d have gone home again and found the lamps lighted and\r\n  supper ready\xe2\x80\x94not very grand, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, for Mrs. Vole isn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\n  best of cooks. And then the piano; for there is a piano, and I had\r\n  the tuner come specially from Hastings yesterday, so that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n  _so_ bad now. And you\xe2\x80\x99d have played; and perhaps I would have made\r\n  my noises on it. And at last it would have been time for candles and\r\n  bed. When I heard you were coming, Theodore, I told Mrs. Vole a lie\r\n  about you. I said you were my husband, because she\xe2\x80\x99s fearfully\r\n  respectable, of course; and it would dreadfully disturb her if you\r\n  weren\xe2\x80\x99t. But I told myself that, too. I meant that you should be.\r\n  You see, I tell you everything. I\xe2\x80\x99m not ashamed. I wanted to give\r\n  you everything I could, and then we should always be together,\r\n  loving one another. And I should have been your slave, I should have\r\n  been your property and lived inside your life. But you would always\r\n  have had to love me.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, just as I was getting ready to go and call at the\r\n  Chequers for the horse and trap, your telegram came. I saw the word\r\n  \xe2\x80\x98accident,\xe2\x80\x99 and I imagined you all bleeding and smashed\xe2\x80\x94oh,\r\n  dreadful, dreadful. But then, when you seemed to make rather a joke\r\n  of it\xe2\x80\x94why did you say \xe2\x80\x98a little indisposed?\xe2\x80\x99 that seemed, somehow,\r\n  so stupid, I thought\xe2\x80\x94and said you were coming to-morrow, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n  that which upset me; it was the dreadful, dreadful disappointment.\r\n  It was like a stab, that disappointment; it hurt so terribly, so\r\n  unreasonably much. It made me cry and cry, so that I thought I\r\n  should never be able to stop. And then, gradually, I began to see\r\n  that the pain of the disappointment wasn\xe2\x80\x99t unreasonably great. It\r\n  wasn\xe2\x80\x99t merely a question of your coming being put off for a day; it\r\n  was a question of its being put off for ever, of my never seeing you\r\n  again. I saw that that accident had been something really arranged\r\n  by Providence. It was meant to warn me and show me what I ought to\r\n  do. I saw how hopelessly impracticable the happiness I had been\r\n  imagining really was. I saw that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t love me in\r\n  anything like the same way as I loved you. I was only a curious\r\n  adventure, a new experience, a means to some other end. Mind, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n  not blaming you in the least. I\xe2\x80\x99m only telling you what is true,\r\n  what I gradually came to realize as true. If you\xe2\x80\x99d come\xe2\x80\x94what then?\r\n  I\xe2\x80\x99d have given you everything, my body, my mind, my soul, my whole\r\n  life. I\xe2\x80\x99d have twisted myself into the threads of your life. And\r\n  then, when in due course you wanted to make an end to this curious\r\n  little adventure, you would have had to cut the tangle and it would\r\n  have killed me; it would also have hurt you. At least I think it\r\n  would. In the end, I thanked God for the accident which had\r\n  prevented you coming. In this way, Providence lets us off very\r\n  lightly\xe2\x80\x94you with a bruise or two (for I do hope it really is\r\n  nothing, my precious darling), and me with a bruise inside, round\r\n  the heart. But both will get well quite soon. And all our lives, we\r\n  shall have an afternoon under the trees, an evening of music and in\r\n  the darkness, a night, an eternity of happiness, to look back on. I\r\n  shall go away from Robertsbridge at once. Good-bye, Theodore. What a\r\n  long letter! The last you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever get from me. The last\xe2\x80\x94what a\r\n  dreadful hurting word that is. I shall take it to post at once, for\r\n  fear, if I leave it, I may be weak enough to change my mind and let\r\n  you come to-morrow. I shall take it at once, then I shall come home\r\n  again and pack up and tell some new fib to Mrs. Vole. And after\r\n  that, perhaps I shall allow myself to cry again. Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAridly, the desert of sand stretched out with not a tree and not even a\r\nmirage, except perhaps the vague and desperate hope that he might get\r\nthere before she started, that she might conceivably have changed her\r\nmind. Ah, if only he\xe2\x80\x99d read the letter a little earlier! But he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwoken up before eleven, he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been down before half-past. Sitting at\r\nthe breakfast-table, he had read the letter through.\r\n\r\nThe eggs and bacon had grown still colder, if that was possible, than\r\nthey were. He had read it through, he had rushed to the A.B.C. There was\r\nno practicable train before the two o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nIf he had taken the seven-twenty-seven he would certainly have got there\r\nbefore she started. Ah, if only he had woken up a little earlier! But\r\nthen he would have had to go to bed a little earlier. And in order to go\r\nto bed earlier, he would have had to abandon Mrs. Viveash before she had\r\nbored herself to that ultimate point of fatigue at which she did at last\r\nfeel ready for repose. And to abandon Mrs. Viveash\xe2\x80\x94ah, that was really\r\nimpossible, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow herself to be left alone. If only he\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone to the London Library yesterday! A wanton, unnecessary visit\r\nit had been. For after all, the journey was short; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t need a book\r\nfor the train. And the _Life of Beckford_, for which he had asked,\r\nproved, of course, to be out\xe2\x80\x94and he had been utterly incapable of\r\nthinking of any other book, among the two or three hundred thousand on\r\nthe shelves, that he wanted to read. And, in any case, what the devil\r\ndid he want with a _Life of Beckford_? Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he his own life, the life\r\nof Gumbril, to attend to? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t one life enough, without making\r\nsuperfluous visits to the London Library in search of other lives? And\r\nthen what a stroke of bad luck to have run into Mrs. Viveash at that\r\nvery moment! What an abject weakness to have let himself be bullied into\r\nsending that telegram. \xe2\x80\x9cA little indisposed....\xe2\x80\x9d Oh, my God! Gumbril\r\nshut his eyes and ground his teeth together; he felt himself blushing\r\nwith a retrospective shame.\r\n\r\nAnd of course it was quite useless taking the train, like this, to\r\nRobertsbridge. She\xe2\x80\x99d be gone, of course. Still, there was always the\r\ndesperate hope. There was the mirage across the desiccated plains, the\r\nmirage one knew to be deceptive and which, on a second glance, proved\r\nnot even to be a mirage, but merely a few livery spots behind the eyes.\r\nStill, it was amply worth doing\xe2\x80\x94as a penance, and to satisfy the\r\nconscience and to deceive oneself with an illusion of action. And then\r\nthe fact that he was to have spent the afternoon with Rosie and had put\r\nher off\xe2\x80\x94that too was highly satisfying. And not merely put her off,\r\nbut\xe2\x80\x94ultimate clownery in the worst of deliriously bad taste\xe2\x80\x94played a\r\njoke on her. \xe2\x80\x9cImpossible come to you, meet me 213 Sloane Street, second\r\nfloor, a little indisposed.\xe2\x80\x9d He wondered how she\xe2\x80\x99d get on with Mr.\r\nMercaptan; for it was to his rococo boudoir and Cr\xc3\xa9billon-souled sofa\r\nthat he had on the spur of the clownish moment, as he dashed into the\r\npost office on the way to the station, sent her.\r\n\r\nAridly, the desiccated waste extended. Had she been right in her letter?\r\nWould it really have lasted no more than a little while, and ended as\r\nshe prophesied, with an agonizing cutting of the tangle? Or could it be\r\nthat she had held out the one hope of happiness? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she perhaps the\r\none unique being with whom he might have learned to await in quietness\r\nthe final coming of that lovely terrible thing, from before the sound of\r\nwhose secret footsteps more than once and oh! ignobly he had fled? He\r\ncould not decide, it was impossible to decide until he had seen her\r\nagain, till he had possessed her, mingled his life with hers. And now\r\nshe had eluded him; for he knew very well that he would not find her. He\r\nsighed and looked out of the window.\r\n\r\nThe train pulled up at a small suburban station. Suburban, for though\r\nLondon was already some way behind, the little sham half-timbered houses\r\nnear the station, the newer tile and rough-cast dwellings farther out on\r\nthe slope of the hill proclaimed with emphasis the presence of the\r\nbusiness man, the holder of the season ticket. Gumbril looked at them\r\nwith a pensive disgust which must have expressed itself on his features;\r\nfor the gentleman sitting in the corner of the carriage facing his,\r\nsuddenly leaned forward, tapped him on the knee, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI see you\r\nagree with me, sir, that there are too many people in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril, who up till now had merely been aware that somebody was sitting\r\nopposite him, now looked with more attention at the stranger. He was a\r\nlarge, square old gentleman of robust and flourishing appearance, with a\r\nface of wrinkled brown parchment and a white moustache that merged, in a\r\nhandsome curve, with a pair of side whiskers, in a manner which reminded\r\none of the photographs of the Emperor Francis Joseph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI perfectly agree with you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril answered. If he had been\r\nwearing his beard, he would have gone on to suggest that loquacious old\r\ngentlemen in trains are among the supernumeraries of the planet. As it\r\nwas, however he spoke with courtesy, and smiled in his most engaging\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I look at all these revolting houses,\xe2\x80\x9d the old gentleman\r\ncontinued, shaking his fist at the snuggeries of the season-ticket\r\nholders, \xe2\x80\x9cI am filled with indignation. I feel my spleen ready to burst,\r\nsir, ready to burst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can sympathize with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cThe architecture is\r\ncertainly not very soothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the architecture I mind so much,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the old gentleman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s merely a question of art, and all nonsense so far as I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nconcerned. What disgusts me is the people inside the architecture, the\r\nnumber of them, sir. And the way they breed. Like maggots, sir, like\r\nmaggots. Millions of them, creeping about the face of the country,\r\nspreading blight and dirt wherever they go; ruining everything. It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\npeople I object to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, \xe2\x80\x9cif you will have sanitary conditions that\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t allow plagues to flourish properly; if you will tell mothers how\r\nto bring up their children, instead of allowing nature to kill them off\r\nin her natural way; if you will import unlimited supplies of corn and\r\nmeat: what can you expect? Of course the numbers go up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman waved all this away. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care what the causes\r\nare,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all one to me. What I do object to, sir, is the\r\neffects. Why sir, I am old enough to remember walking through the\r\ndelicious meadows beyond Swiss Cottage, I remember seeing the cows\r\nmilked in West Hampstead, sir. And now, what do I see now, when I go\r\nthere? Hideous red cities pullulating with Jews, sir. Pullulating with\r\nprosperous Jews. Am I right in being indignant, sir? Do I do well, like\r\nthe prophet Jonah, to be angry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, with growing enthusiasm, \xe2\x80\x9cand the more so\r\nsince this frightful increase in population is the world\xe2\x80\x99s most\r\nformidable danger at the present time. With populations that in Europe\r\nalone expand by millions every year, no political foresight is possible.\r\nA few years of this mere bestial propagation will suffice to make\r\nnonsense of the wisest schemes of to-day\xe2\x80\x94or would suffice,\xe2\x80\x9d he hastened\r\nto correct himself, \xe2\x80\x9cif any wise schemes were being matured at the\r\npresent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery possibly, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cbut what I object to is\r\nseeing good cornland being turned into streets, and meadows, where cows\r\nused to graze, covered with houses full of useless and disgusting human\r\nbeings. I resent seeing the country parcelled out into back gardens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is there any prospect,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril earnestly asked, \xe2\x80\x9cof our ever being\r\nable in the future to support the whole of our population? Will\r\nunemployment ever decrease?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d the old gentleman replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the families of the\r\nunemployed will certainly increase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, \xe2\x80\x9cthey will. And the families of the\r\nemployed and the prosperous will as steadily grow smaller. It is\r\nregrettable that birth control should have begun at the wrong end of the\r\nscale. There seems to be a level of poverty below which it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem\r\nworth while practising birth control, and a level of education below\r\nwhich birth control is regarded as morally wrong. Strange, how long it\r\nhas taken for the ideas of love and procreation to dissociate themselves\r\nin the human mind. In the majority of minds they are still, even in this\r\nso-called twentieth century, indivisibly wedded. Still,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued\r\nhopefully, \xe2\x80\x9cprogress is being made, progress is certainly, though\r\nslowly, being made. It is gratifying to find, for example, in the latest\r\nstatistics, that the clergy, as a class, are now remarkable for the\r\nsmallness of their families. The old jest is out of date. Is it too much\r\nto hope that these gentlemen may bring themselves in time to preach what\r\nthey already practise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ too much to hope, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d the old gentleman answered with\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are probably right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we were all to preach all the things we all practise,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the\r\nold gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cthe world would soon be a pretty sort of bear-garden, I\r\ncan tell you. Yes, and a monkey-house. And a wart-hoggery. As it is,\r\nsir, it is merely a place where there are too many human beings. Vice\r\nmust pay its tribute to virtue, or else we are all undone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI admire your wisdom, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman was delighted. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have been much impressed by your\r\nphilosophical reflections,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me, are you at all interested\r\nin old brandy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, not philosophically,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a mere empiric only.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a mere empiric!\xe2\x80\x9d The old gentleman laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThen let me beg you to\r\naccept a case. I have a cellar which I shall never drink dry, alas!\r\nbefore I die. My only wish is that what remains of it shall be\r\ndistributed among those who can really appreciate it. In you, sir, I see\r\na fitting recipient of a case of brandy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou overwhelm me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are too kind, and, I may add, too\r\nflattering.\xe2\x80\x9d The train, which was a mortally slow one, came grinding for\r\nwhat seemed the hundredth time to a halt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have a card, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril searched his pockets. \xe2\x80\x9cI have come without one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I have a pencil. If you\r\nwill give me your name and address, I will have the case sent to you at\r\nonce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeisurely, he hunted for the pencil, he took out a notebook. The train\r\ngave a jerk forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nGumbril began dictating. \xe2\x80\x9cTheodore,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe\xe2\x80\x94o\xe2\x80\x94dore,\xe2\x80\x9d the old gentleman repeated, syllable by syllable.\r\n\r\nThe train crept on, with slowly gathering momentum, through the station.\r\nHappening to look out of the window at this moment, Gumbril saw the name\r\nof the place painted across a lamp. It was Robertsbridge. He made a\r\nloud, inarticulate noise, flung open the door of the compartment,\r\nstepped out on to the footboard and jumped. He landed safely on the\r\nplatform, staggered forward a few paces with his acquired momentum and\r\ncame at last to a halt. A hand reached out and closed the swinging door\r\nof his compartment and, an instant afterwards, through the window, a\r\nface that, at a distance, looked more than ever like the face of the\r\nEmperor Francis Joseph, looked back towards the receding platform. The\r\nmouth opened and shut; no words were audible. Standing on the platform,\r\nGumbril made a complicated pantomime, signifying his regret by shrugging\r\nhis shoulders and placing his hand on his heart; urging in excuse for\r\nhis abrupt departure the necessity under which he laboured of alighting\r\nat this particular station\xe2\x80\x94which he did by pointing at the name on the\r\nboards and lamps, then at himself, then at the village across the\r\nfields. The old gentleman waved his hand, which still held, Gumbril\r\nnoticed, the notebook in which he had been writing. Then the train\r\ncarried him out of sight. There went the only case of old brandy he was\r\never likely to possess, thought Gumbril sadly, as he turned away.\r\nSuddenly, he remembered Emily again; for a long time he had quite\r\nforgotten her.\r\n\r\nThe cottage, when at last he found it, proved to be fully as picturesque\r\nas he had imagined. And Emily, of course, had gone, leaving, as might\r\nhave been expected, no address. He took the evening train back to\r\nLondon. The aridity was now complete, and even the hope of a mirage had\r\nvanished. There was no old gentleman to make a diversion. The size of\r\nclergymen\xe2\x80\x99s families, even the fate of Europe, seemed unimportant now,\r\nwere indeed perfectly indifferent to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and thirteen Sloane Street. The address, Rosie reflected, as\r\nshe vaporized synthetic lilies of the valley over all her sinuous\r\nperson, was decidedly a good one. It argued a reasonable prosperity,\r\nattested a certain distinction. The knowledge of his address confirmed\r\nher already high opinion of the bearded stranger who had so surprisingly\r\nentered her life, as though in fulfilment of all the fortune-tellers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nprophecies that ever were made; had entered, yes, and intimately made\r\nhimself at home. She had been delighted, when the telegram came that\r\nmorning, to think that at last she was going to find out something more\r\nabout this man of mystery. For dark and mysterious he had remained,\r\nremote even in the midst of the most intimate contacts. Why, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neven know his name. \xe2\x80\x9cCall me Toto,\xe2\x80\x9d he had suggested, when she asked him\r\nwhat it was. And Toto she had had to call him, for lack of anything more\r\ndefinite or committal. But to-day he was letting her further into his\r\nsecret. Rosie was delighted. Her pink underclothing, she decided, as she\r\nlooked in the long glass, was really ravishing. She examined herself,\r\nturning first one way, then the other, looking over her shoulder to see\r\nthe effect from behind. She pointed a toe, bent and straightened a knee,\r\napplauding the length of her legs (\xe2\x80\x9cMost women,\xe2\x80\x9d Toto had said, \xe2\x80\x9care\r\nlike dachshunds\xe2\x80\x9d), their slenderness and plump suavity of form. In their\r\nwhite stockings of Milanese silk they looked delicious; and how\r\nmarvellously, by the way, those Selfridge people had mended those\r\nstockings by their new patent process! Absolutely like new, and only\r\ncharged four shillings. Well, it was time to dress. Good-bye, then, to\r\nthe pink underclothing and the long white legs. She opened the wardrobe\r\ndoor. The moving glass reflected, as it swung through its half-circle,\r\npink bed, rose-wreathed walls, little friends of her own age, and the\r\ndying saint at his last communion. Rosie selected the frock she had\r\nbought the other day at one of those little shops in Soho, there they\r\nsell such smart things so cheaply to a clientage of minor actresses and\r\ncocottes. Toto hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen it yet. She looked extremely distinguished in\r\nit. The little hat, with its inch of veil hanging like a mask,\r\nunconcealing and inviting, from the brim, suited her to perfection. One\r\nlast dab of powder, one last squirt of synthetic lilies of the valley,\r\nand she was ready. She closed the door behind her. St. Jerome was left\r\nto communicate in the untenanted pinkness.\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan sat at his writing-table\xe2\x80\x94an exquisitely amusing affair in\r\npapier m\xc3\xa2ch\xc3\xa9, inlaid with floral decorations in mother-of-pearl and\r\npainted with views of Windsor Castle and Tintern in the romantic manner\r\nof Prince Albert\xe2\x80\x99s later days\xe2\x80\x94polishing to its final and gem-like\r\nperfection one of his middle articles. It was on a splendid subject\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jus Prim\xc3\xa6 Noctis, or Droit du Seigneur\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat delicious _droit_,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote\r\nMr. Mercaptan, \xe2\x80\x9con which, one likes to think, the Sovereigns of England\r\ninsist so firmly in their motto, _Dieu et mon Droit\xe2\x80\x94de Seigneur_.\xe2\x80\x9d That\r\nwas charming, Mr. Mercaptan thought, as he read it through. And he liked\r\nthat bit which began elegiacally: \xe2\x80\x9cBut, alas! the Right of the First\r\nNight belongs to a Middle Age as mythical, albeit happily different, as\r\nthose dismal epochs invented by Morris or by Chesterton. The Lord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright, as we prettily imagine it, is a figment of the baroque\r\nimagination of the seventeenth century. It never existed. Or at least it\r\ndid exist, but as something deplorably different from what we love to\r\npicture it.\xe2\x80\x9d And he went on, eruditely, to refer to that Council of\r\nCarthage which, in 398, demanded of the faithful that they should be\r\ncontinent on their wedding-night. It was the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s right\xe2\x80\x94the _droit_ of\r\na heavenly Seigneur. On this text of fact, Mr. Mercaptan went on to\r\npreach a brilliant sermon on that melancholy sexual perversion known as\r\ncontinence. How much happier we all should be if the real historical\r\n_droit du Seigneur_ had in fact been the mythical right of our \xe2\x80\x98pretty\r\nprurient imaginations\xe2\x80\x99! He looked forward to a golden age when all\r\nshould be seigneurs possessing rights that should have broadened down\r\ninto universal liberty. And so on. Mr. Mercaptan read through his\r\ncreation with a smile of satisfaction on his face. Every here and there\r\nhe made a careful correction in red ink. Over \xe2\x80\x98pretty prurient\r\nimaginations\xe2\x80\x99 his pen hung for a full minute in conscientious\r\nhesitation. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it perhaps a little too strongly alliterative, a\r\nshade, perhaps, cheap? Perhaps \xe2\x80\x98pretty lascivious\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98delicate\r\nprurient\xe2\x80\x99 would be better. He repeated the alternatives several times,\r\nrolling the sound of them round his tongue, judicially, like a\r\ntea-taster. In the end, he decided that \xe2\x80\x98pretty prurient\xe2\x80\x99 was right.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pretty prurient\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94they were the _mots justes_, decidedly, without a\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan had just come to this decision and his poised pen was\r\nmoving farther down the page, when he was disturbed by the sound of\r\narguing voices in the corridor, outside his room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Mrs. Goldie?\xe2\x80\x9d he called irritably, for it was not difficult\r\nto distinguish his housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s loud and querulous tones. He had given\r\norders that he was not to be disturbed. In these critical moments of\r\ncorrection one needed such absolute tranquillity.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Mercaptan was to have no tranquillity this afternoon. The door\r\nof his sacred boudoir was thrown rudely open, and there strode in, like\r\na Goth into the elegant marble vomitorium of Petronius Arbiter, a\r\nhaggard and dishevelled person whom Mr. Mercaptan recognized, with a\r\ncertain sense of discomfort, as Casimir Lypiatt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what do I owe the _pleasure_ of this unexpected...?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mercaptan\r\nbegan with an essay in offensive courtesy.\r\n\r\nBut Lypiatt, who had no feeling for the finer shades, coarsely\r\ninterrupted him. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Mercaptan,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to have a talk\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelighted, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mercaptan replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd _what_, may I ask,\r\nabout?\xe2\x80\x9d He knew, of course, perfectly well; and the prospect of the talk\r\ndisturbed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lypiatt; and he held out what looked like a roll of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan took the roll and opened it out. It was a copy of the\r\n_Weekly World_. \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mercaptan, in a tone of delighted\r\nsurprise, \xe2\x80\x9c_The World_. You have read my little article?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was what I wanted to talk to you about,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lypiatt.\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan modestly laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt hardly deserves it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nPreserving a calm of expression which was quite unnatural to him, and\r\nspeaking in a studiedly quiet voice, Lypiatt pronounced with careful\r\ndeliberation: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a disgusting, malicious, ignoble attack on me,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, _come_!\xe2\x80\x9d protested Mr. Mercaptan. \xe2\x80\x9cA critic must be allowed to\r\ncriticize.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there are limits,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lypiatt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I _quite_ agree,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mercaptan eagerly conceded. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, after all,\r\nLypiatt, you can\xe2\x80\x99t pretend that I have come anywhere near those limits.\r\nIf I had called you a _mur_derer, or even an _adul_terer\xe2\x80\x94then, I admit,\r\nyou would have some cause to complain. But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nlike a personality in the whole thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLypiatt laughed derisively, and his face went all to pieces, like a pool\r\nof water into which a stone is suddenly dropped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve merely said I was insincere, an actor, a mountebank, a quack,\r\nraving fustian, spouting mock heroics. That\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan put on the expression of one who feels himself injured and\r\nmisunderstood. He shut his eyes, he flapped deprecatingly with his hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _merely_ suggested,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you protest _too_ much. You\r\ndefeat your own ends; you lose emphasis by trying to be over-emphatic.\r\nAll this _folie de grandeur_, all this hankering after _terribilt\xc3\xa0_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsagely Mr. Mercaptan shook his head, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s led so _many_ people astray.\r\nAnd, in any case, you can\xe2\x80\x99t _really_ expect _me_ to find it very\r\nsympathetic.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mercaptan uttered a little laugh and looked\r\naffectionately round his boudoir, his retired and perfumed poutery\r\nwithin whose walls so much civilization had finely flowered. He looked\r\nat his magnificent sofa, gilded and carved, upholstered in white satin,\r\nand so deep\xe2\x80\x94for it was a great square piece of furniture, almost as\r\nbroad as it was long\xe2\x80\x94that when you sat right back, you had of necessity\r\nto lift your feet from the floor and recline at length. It was under the\r\nwhite satin that Cr\xc3\xa9billon\xe2\x80\x99s spirit found, in these late degenerate\r\ndays, a sympathetic home. He looked at his exquisite Condor fans over\r\nthe mantelpiece; his lovely Marie Laurencin of two young girls,\r\npale-skinned and berry-eyed, walking embraced in a shallow myopic\r\nlandscape amid a troop of bounding heraldic dogs. He looked at his\r\ncabinet of _bibelots_ in the corner where the nigger mask and the superb\r\nChinese phallus in sculptured rock crystal contrasted so amusingly with\r\nthe Chelsea china, the little ivory Madonna, which might be a fake, but\r\nin any case was quite as good as any medi\xc3\xa6val French original, and the\r\nItalian medals. He looked at his comical writing-desk in shining black\r\npapier m\xc3\xa2ch\xc3\xa9 and mother-of-pearl; he looked at his article on the \xe2\x80\x9cJus\r\nPrim\xc3\xa6 Noctis,\xe2\x80\x9d black and neat on the page, with the red corrections\r\nattesting his tireless search for, and his, he flattered himself, almost\r\ninvariable discovery of, the inevitable word. No, really, one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpect _him_ to find Lypiatt\xe2\x80\x99s notions very sympathetic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect you to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lypiatt, \xe2\x80\x9cand, good God! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nyou to. But you call me insincere. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I can\xe2\x80\x99t and won\xe2\x80\x99t stand.\r\nHow dare you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d His voice was growing louder.\r\n\r\nOnce more Mr. Mercaptan deprecatingly flapped. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the most,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncorrected, \xe2\x80\x9cI said that there was a certain look of insincerity about\r\nsome of the pictures. Hardly avoidable, indeed, in work of this kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQuite suddenly, Lypiatt lost his self-control. All the accumulated anger\r\nand bitterness of the last days burst out. His show had been a hopeless\r\nfailure. Not a picture sold, a press that was mostly bad, or, when good,\r\nthat had praised for the wrong, the insulting reasons. \xe2\x80\x9cBright and\r\neffective work.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Lypiatt would make an excellent stage designer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nDamn them! damn them! And then, when the dailies had all had their yelp,\r\nhere was Mercaptan in the _Weekly World_ taking him as a text for what\r\nwas practically an essay on insincerity in art. \xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nfuriously shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x94how dare you talk about sincerity? What can you\r\nknow about sincerity, you disgusting little bug!\xe2\x80\x9d And avenging himself\r\non the person of Mr. Mercaptan against the world that had neglected him,\r\nagainst the fate that had denied him his rightful share of talent,\r\nLypiatt sprang up and, seizing the author of the \xe2\x80\x9cJus Prim\xc3\xa6 Noctis\xe2\x80\x9d by\r\nthe shoulders, he shook him, he bumped him up and down in his chair, he\r\ncuffed him over the head. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you have the impudence,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\r\nletting go of his victim, but still standing menacingly over him, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\ntouch anything that even attempts to be decent and big?\xe2\x80\x9d All these\r\nyears, these wretched years of poverty and struggle and courageous hope\r\nand failure and repeated disappointment; and now this last failure, more\r\ncomplete than all. He was trembling with anger; at least one forgot\r\nunhappiness while one was angry.\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan had recovered from his first terrified surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cReally,\r\n_really_\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, \xe2\x80\x9c_too_ barbarous. Scuffling like hobbledehoys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you knew,\xe2\x80\x9d Lypiatt began; but he checked himself. If you knew, he\r\nwas going to say, what those things had cost me, what they meant, what\r\nthought, what passion\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94But how could Mercaptan understand? And it would\r\nsound as though he were appealing to this creature\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy. \xe2\x80\x9cBug!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nshouted instead, \xe2\x80\x9cbug!\xe2\x80\x9d And he struck out again with the flat of his\r\nhand. Mr. Mercaptan put up his hands and ducked away from the slaps,\r\nblinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally,\xe2\x80\x9d he protested, \xe2\x80\x9c_really_....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInsincere? Perhaps it was half true. Lypiatt seized his man more\r\nfuriously than before and shook him, shook him. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then that vile\r\ninsult about the vermouth advertisement,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried out. That had\r\nrankled. Those flaring, vulgar posters! \xe2\x80\x9cYou thought you could mock me\r\nand spit at me with impunity, did you? I\xe2\x80\x99ve stood it so long, you\r\nthought I\xe2\x80\x99d always stand it? Was that it? But you\xe2\x80\x99re mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nlifted his fist. Mr. Mercaptan cowered away, raising his arm to protect\r\nhis head. \xe2\x80\x9cVile bug of a coward,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lypiatt, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you defend\r\nyourself like a man? You can only be dangerous with words. Very witty\r\nand spiteful and cutting about those vermouth posters, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? But\r\nyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dare to fight me if I challenged you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as a matter of _fact_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mercaptan, peering up from under\r\nhis defences, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t invent _that_ particular piece of criticism. I\r\nborrowed the _ap\xc3\xa9ritif_.\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed feebly, more canary than bull.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou borrowed it, did you?\xe2\x80\x9d Lypiatt contemptuously repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd who\r\nfrom, may I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d Not that it interested him in the least to know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you really _want_ to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mercaptan, \xe2\x80\x9cit was from\r\nour friend Myra Viveash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLypiatt stood for a moment without speaking, then putting his menacing\r\nhand in his pocket, he turned away. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d he said noncommittally, and\r\nwas silent again.\r\n\r\nRelieved, Mr. Mercaptan sat up in his chair; with the palm of his right\r\nhand he smoothed his dishevelled head.\r\n\r\nAirily, outside in the sunshine, Rosie walked down Sloane Street,\r\nlooking at the numbers on the doors of the houses. A hundred and\r\nninety-nine, two hundred, two hundred and one\xe2\x80\x94she was getting near now.\r\nPerhaps all the people who passed, strolling so easily and elegantly and\r\ndisengagedly along, perhaps they all of them carried behind their eyes a\r\nsecret, as delightful and amusing as hers. Rosie liked to think so; it\r\nmade life more exciting. How nonchalantly distinguished, Rosie\r\nreflected, she herself must look. Would any one who saw her now,\r\nsauntering along like this, would any one guess that, ten houses farther\r\ndown the street, a young poet, or at least very nearly a young poet, was\r\nwaiting, on the second floor, eagerly for her arrival? Of course they\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t guess! That was the fun and the enormous\r\nexcitement of the whole thing. Formidable in her light-hearted\r\ndetachment, formidable in the passion which at will she could give rein\r\nto and check again, the great lady swam beautifully along through the\r\nsunlight to satisfy her caprice. Like Diana, she stooped over the\r\nshepherd boy. Eagerly the starving young poet waited, waited in his\r\ngarret. Two hundred and twelve, two hundred and thirteen. Rosie looked\r\nat the entrance and was reminded that the garret couldn\xe2\x80\x99t after all be\r\nvery sordid, nor the young poet absolutely starving. She stepped in and,\r\nstanding in the hall, looked at the board with the names. Ground floor:\r\nMrs. Budge. First floor: F. de M. Rowbotham. Second floor: P. Mercaptan.\r\n\r\nP. Mercaptan.... But it was a charming name, a romantic name, a real\r\nyoung poet\xe2\x80\x99s name! Mercaptan\xe2\x80\x94she felt more than ever pleased with her\r\nselection. The fastidious lady could not have had a happier caprice.\r\nMercaptan ... Mercaptan.... She wondered what the P. stood for. Peter,\r\nPhilip, Patrick, Pendennis even? She could hardly have guessed that Mr.\r\nMercaptan\xe2\x80\x99s father, the eminent bacteriologist, had insisted,\r\nthirty-four years ago, on calling his first-born \xe2\x80\x98Pasteur.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA little tremulous, under her outward elegant calm, Rosie mounted the\r\nstairs. Twenty-five steps to the first floor\xe2\x80\x94one flight of thirteen,\r\nwhich was rather disagreeably ominous, and one of twelve. Then two\r\nflights of eleven, and she was on the second landing, facing a front\r\ndoor, a bell-push like a round eye, a brass name-plate. For a great lady\r\nthoroughly accustomed to this sort of thing, she felt her heart beating\r\nrather unpleasantly fast. It was those stairs, no doubt. She halted a\r\nmoment, took two deep breaths, then pushed the bell.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened by an aged servant of the most forbiddingly\r\nrespectable appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mercaptan at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe person at the door burst at once into a long, rambling, angry\r\ncomplaint, but precisely about what Rosie could not for certain make\r\nout. Mr. Mercaptan had left orders, she gathered, that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be\r\ndisturbed. But some one had come and disturbed him, \xe2\x80\x9cfairly shoved his\r\nway in, so rude and inconsiderate,\xe2\x80\x9d all the same. And now he\xe2\x80\x99d been once\r\ndisturbed, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t see why he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disturbed again. But she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know what things were coming to if people fairly shoved their way\r\nin like that. Bolshevism, she called it.\r\n\r\nRosie murmured her sympathies, and was admitted into a dark hall. Still\r\nquerulously denouncing the Bolsheviks who came shoving in, the person\r\nled the way down a corridor and, throwing open a door, announced, in a\r\ntone of grievance: \xe2\x80\x9cA lady to see you, Master Paster\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for Mrs. Goldie\r\nwas an old family retainer, and one of the few who knew the Secret of\r\nMr. Mercaptan\xe2\x80\x99s Christian name, one of the fewer still who were\r\nprivileged to employ it. Then, as soon as Rosie had stepped across the\r\nthreshold, she cut off her retreat with a bang and went off, muttering\r\nall the time, towards her kitchen.\r\n\r\nIt certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a garret. Half a glance, the first whiff of\r\npot-pourri, the feel of the carpet beneath her feet, had been enough to\r\nprove that. But it was not the room which occupied Rosie\xe2\x80\x99s attention, it\r\nwas its occupants. One of them, thin, sharp-featured and, in Rosie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery young eyes, quite old, was standing with an elbow on the\r\nmantelpiece. The other, sleeker and more genial in appearance, was\r\nsitting in front of a writing-desk near the window. And neither of\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94Rosie glanced desperately from one to the other, hoping vainly that\r\nshe might have overlooked a blond beard\xe2\x80\x94neither of them was Toto.\r\n\r\nThe sleek man at the writing-desk got up, advanced to meet her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn unexpected pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a voice that alternately boomed\r\nand fluted. \xe2\x80\x9c_Too_ delightful! But to what do I owe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94? _Who_, may I\r\nask\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had held out his hand; automatically Rosie proffered hers. The sleek\r\nman shook it with cordiality, almost with tenderness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ... I think I must have made a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nMercaptan...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sleek man smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI am Mr. Mercaptan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou live on the second floor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never laid claims to being a mathematician,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sleek man,\r\nsmiling as though to applaud himself, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have always calculated\r\nthat ...\xe2\x80\x9d he hesitated ... \xe2\x80\x9c_enfin, que ma demeure se trouve, en effet_,\r\non the second floor. Lypiatt will bear me out, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to\r\nthe thin man, who had not moved from the fireplace, but had stood all\r\nthe time motionlessly, his elbow on the mantelpiece, looking gloomily at\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nLypiatt looked up. \xe2\x80\x9cI must be going,\xe2\x80\x9d he said abruptly. And he walked\r\ntowards the door. Like vermouth posters, like vermouth posters!\xe2\x80\x94so that\r\nwas Myra\xe2\x80\x99s piece of mockery! All his anger had sunk like a quenched\r\nflame. He was altogether quenched, put out with unhappiness.\r\n\r\nPolitely Mr. Mercaptan hurried across the room and opened the door for\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9c_Good_-bye, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said airily.\r\n\r\nLypiatt did not speak, but walked out into the hall. The front door\r\nbanged behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _well_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mercaptan, coming back across the room to where\r\nRosie was still irresolutely standing. \xe2\x80\x9cTalk about the _furor poeticus_!\r\nBut _do_ sit down, I beg you. On Cr\xc3\xa9billon.\xe2\x80\x9d He indicated the vast white\r\nsatin sofa. \xe2\x80\x9cI call it Cr\xc3\xa9billon,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the soul of\r\nthat great writer undoubtedly tenants it, _undoubtedly_. You know his\r\nbook, of course? You know _Le Sopha_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSinking into Cr\xc3\xa9billon\xe2\x80\x99s soft lap, Rosie had to admit that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow _Le Sopha_. She had begun to recover her self-possession. If this\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t _the_ young poet, it was certainly _a_ young poet. And a very\r\npeculiar one, too. As a great lady she laughingly accepted the odd\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot know _Le Sopha_?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Mercaptan. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! but, my dear and\r\nmysterious young lady, let me lend you a copy of it at once. _No_\r\neducation can be called _complete_ without a knowledge of that divine\r\nbook.\xe2\x80\x9d He darted to the bookshelf and came back with a small volume\r\nbound in white vellum. \xe2\x80\x9cThe hero\xe2\x80\x99s soul,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, handing her the\r\nvolume, \xe2\x80\x9cpasses, by the laws of metempsychosis, into a sofa. He is\r\ndoomed to remain a sofa until such time as two persons consummate upon\r\nhis bosom their reciprocal and equal loves. The book is the record of\r\nthe poor sofa\xe2\x80\x99s hopes and disappointments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosie, looking at the title-page.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mercaptan, sitting down beside her on the edge of\r\nCr\xc3\xa9billon, \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t you please explain? To what happy quiproquo do I owe\r\nthis sudden and altogether delightful invasion of my privacy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosie, and hesitated. It was really rather difficult to\r\nexplain. \xe2\x80\x9cI was to meet a friend of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mercaptan encouragingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho sent me a telegram,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosie went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe sent you a telegram!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mercaptan echoed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChanging the\xe2\x80\x94the place we had fixed and telling me to meet him at this\r\naddress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRose nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the s\xe2\x80\x94second floor,\xe2\x80\x9d she made it more precise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _I_ live on the second floor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mercaptan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nto say your friend is also called Mercaptan and lives here too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosie smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s called,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a cool\r\nironical carelessness that was genuinely _grande dame_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know his name?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mercaptan gave a roar and a squeal of\r\ndelighted laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s _too_ good,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x94second floor, he wrote in the telegram.\xe2\x80\x9d Rosie was now perfectly at\r\nher ease. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I saw your name, I thought it was his name. I must say,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe added, looking sideways at Mr. Mercaptan and at once dropping the\r\nmagnolia petals of her eyelids, \xe2\x80\x9cit seemed to me a very charming name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou overwhelm me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mercaptan, smiling all over his cheerful,\r\nsnouty face. \xe2\x80\x9cAs for _your_ name\xe2\x80\x94I am too discreet a _galantuomo_ to\r\nask. And, in any case, what _does_ it matter? A rose by any other\r\nname....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, as a matter of fact,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, raising and lowering once again\r\nher smooth, white lids, \xe2\x80\x9cmy name does happen to be Rose; or, at any\r\nrate, Rosie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are sweet by right!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Mercaptan, with a pretty\r\ngallantry which he was the first to appreciate. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s order tea on the\r\nstrength of it.\xe2\x80\x9d He jumped up and rang the bell. \xe2\x80\x9cHow I congratulate\r\nmyself on this astonishing piece of good fortune!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosie said nothing. This Mr. Mercaptan, she thought, seemed to be even\r\nmore a man of the great artistic world than Toto.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat puzzles me,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis why your anonymous friend should have\r\nchosen my address out of all the millions of others. He must know me,\r\nor, at any rate, know about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosie, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have a lot of friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan laughed\xe2\x80\x94the whole orchestra, from bassoon to piccolo.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Des amis, des amies_\xe2\x80\x94with and without the mute \xe2\x80\x98e,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he declared.\r\n\r\nThe aged and forbidding servant appeared at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTea for two, Mrs. Goldie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Goldie looked round the room suspiciously. \xe2\x80\x9cThe other gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngone, has he?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. And having assured herself of his absence, she\r\nrenewed her complaint. \xe2\x80\x9cShoving in like that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBolshevism,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, all right, Mrs. Goldie. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have our tea as quickly as\r\npossible.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mercaptan held up his hand, authoritatively, with the\r\ngesture of a policeman controlling the traffic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Master Paster.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Goldie spoke with resignation and\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mercaptan went on, \xe2\x80\x9cif it _isn\xe2\x80\x99t_ indiscreet\xe2\x80\x94what\r\ndoes your friend look like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW\xe2\x80\x94well,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosie answered, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s fair, and though he\xe2\x80\x99s quite young he\r\nwears a beard.\xe2\x80\x9d With her two hands she indicated on her own unemphatic\r\nbosom the contours of Toto\xe2\x80\x99s broad blond fan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA beard! But, good heavens,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mercaptan slapped his thigh, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nColeman, it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously and undoubtedly Coleman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, whoever it was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosie severely, \xe2\x80\x9che played a very stupid\r\nsort of joke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor which I thank him. _De tout mon c\xc5\x93ur._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosie smiled and looked sideways. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the same,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\ngive him a piece of my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Aunt Aggie! Oh, poor Aunt Aggie, indeed! In the light of Mr.\r\nMercaptan\xe2\x80\x99s boudoir her hammered copper and her leadless glaze certainly\r\ndid look a bit comical.\r\n\r\nAfter tea Mr. Mercaptan played cicerone in a tour of inspection round\r\nthe room. They visited the papier m\xc3\xa2ch\xc3\xa9 writing-desk, the Condor fans,\r\nthe Marie Laurencin, the 1914 edition of _Du C\xc3\xb4t\xc3\xa9 de chez Swann_, the\r\nMadonna that probably was a fake, the nigger mask, the Chelsea figures,\r\nthe Chinese object of art in sculptured crystal, the scale model of\r\nQueen Victoria in wax under a glass bell. Toto, it became clear, had\r\nbeen no more than a forerunner; the definitive revelation was Mr.\r\nMercaptan\xe2\x80\x99s. Yes, poor Aunt Aggie! And indeed, when Mr. Mercaptan began\r\nto read her his little middle on the \xe2\x80\x9cDroit du Seigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d it was poor\r\neverybody. Poor mother, with her absurd, old-fashioned, prudish views;\r\npoor, earnest father, with his Unitarianism, his _Hibbert Journal_, his\r\nletters to the papers about the necessity for a spiritual regeneration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried from the depths of Cr\xc3\xa9billon. She was leaning back in\r\none corner, languid, serpentine, and at ease, her feet in their mottled\r\nsnake\xe2\x80\x99s leather tucked up under her. \xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried as Mr. Mercaptan\r\nfinished his reading and looked up for his applause.\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou express so exquisitely what we\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and waving her hand in a\r\ncomprehensive gesture, she pictured to herself all the other fastidious\r\nladies, all the marchionesses of fable, reclining, as she herself at\r\nthis moment reclined, on upholstery of white satin, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat we all only\r\nfeel and aren\xe2\x80\x99t clever enough to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan was charmed. He got up from before his writing-desk,\r\ncrossed the room and sat down beside her on Cr\xc3\xa9billon. \xe2\x80\x9cFeeling,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cis the im_port_ant thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosie remembered that her father had once remarked, in blank verse: \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nthings that matter happen in the heart.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite agree,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nLike movable raisins in the suet of his snouty face, Mr. Mercaptan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrown little eyes rolled amorous avowals. He took Rosie\xe2\x80\x99s hand and\r\nkissed it. Cr\xc3\xa9billon creaked discreetly as he moved a little nearer.\r\n\r\nIt was only the evening of the same day. Rosie lay on her sofa\xe2\x80\x94a poor,\r\nhire-purchase thing indeed, compared with Mr. Mercaptan\xe2\x80\x99s grand affair\r\nin white satin and carved and gilded wood, but still a sofa\xe2\x80\x94lay with her\r\nfeet on the arm of it and her long suave legs exposed, by the slipping\r\nof the kimono, to the top of her stretched stockings. She was reading\r\nthe little vellum-jacketed volume of Cr\xc3\xa9billon, which Mr. Mercaptan had\r\ngiven her when he said \xe2\x80\x98good-bye\xe2\x80\x99 (or rather, \xe2\x80\x98_\xc3\x80 bient\xc3\xb4t, mon amie_\xe2\x80\x99);\r\ngiven, not lent, as he had less generously offered at the beginning of\r\ntheir afternoon; given with the most graceful of allusive dedications\r\ninscribed on the fly-leaf:\r\n\r\n                                   To\r\n\r\n                       BY-NO-OTHER-NAME-AS-SWEET,\r\n\r\n                            WITH GRATITUDE,\r\n\r\n                                  FROM\r\n\r\n                          CR\xc3\x89BILLON DELIVERED.\r\n\r\n_\xc3\x80 bient\xc3\xb4t_\xe2\x80\x94she had promised to come again very soon. She thought of the\r\nessay on the \xe2\x80\x9cJus Prim\xc3\xa6 Noctis\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94ah! what we\xe2\x80\x99ve all been feeling and none\r\nof us clever enough to say. We on the sofas, ruthless, lovely and\r\nfastidious....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am proud to constitute myself\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Mercaptan had said of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_l\xe2\x80\x99esprit d\xe2\x80\x99escalier des dames galantes_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosie was not quite sure what he meant; but it certainly sounded very\r\nwitty indeed.\r\n\r\nShe read the book slowly. Her French, indeed, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough to\r\npermit her to read it anyhow else. She wished it were better. Perhaps it\r\nif were better she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be yawning like this. It was disgraceful:\r\nshe pulled herself together. Mr. Mercaptan had said that, it was a\r\nmasterpiece.\r\n\r\nIn his study, Shearwater was trying to write his paper on the regulative\r\nfunctions of the kidneys. He was not succeeding.\r\n\r\nWhy wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she see me yesterday? he kept wondering. With anguish he\r\nsuspected other lovers; desired her, in consequence, the more. Gumbril\r\nhad said something, he remembered, that night they had met her by the\r\ncoffee-stall. What was it? He wished now that he had listened more\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s bored with me. Already. It was obvious.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was too rustic for her. Shearwater looked at his hands. Yes,\r\nthe nails _were_ dirty. He took an orange stick out of his waistcoat\r\npocket and began to clean them. He had bought a whole packet of orange\r\nsticks that morning.\r\n\r\nDeterminedly he took up his pen. \xe2\x80\x9cThe hydrogen ion concentration in the\r\nblood ...\xe2\x80\x9d he began a new paragraph. But he got no further than the\r\nfirst seven words.\r\n\r\nIf, he began thinking with a frightful confusion, if\xe2\x80\x94if\xe2\x80\x94if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Past\r\nconditionals, hopelessly past. He might have been brought up more\r\nelegantly; his father, for example, might have been a barrister instead\r\nof a barrister\xe2\x80\x99s clerk. He mightn\xe2\x80\x99t have had to work so hard when he was\r\nyoung; might have been about more, danced more, seen more young women.\r\nIf he had met her years ago\xe2\x80\x94during the war, should one say, dressed in\r\nthe uniform of a lieutenant in the Guards....\r\n\r\nHe had pretended that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interested in women; that they had no\r\neffect on him; that, in fact, he was above that sort of thing. Imbecile!\r\nHe might as well have said that he was above having a pair of kidneys.\r\nHe had only consented to admit, graciously, that they were a\r\nphysiological necessity.\r\n\r\nO God, what a fool he had been!\r\n\r\nAnd then, what about Rosie? What sort of a life had she been having\r\nwhile he was being above that sort of thing? Now he came to think of it,\r\nhe really knew nothing about her, except that she had been quite\r\nincapable of learning correctly, even by heart, the simplest facts about\r\nthe physiology of frogs. Having found that out, he had really given up\r\nexploring further. How could he have been so stupid?\r\n\r\nRosie had been in love with him, he supposed. Had he been in love with\r\nher? No. He had taken care not to be. On principle. He had married her\r\nas a measure of intimate hygiene; out of protective affection, too,\r\ncertainly out of affection; and a little for amusement, as one might buy\r\na puppy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash had opened his eyes; seeing her, he had also begun to\r\nnotice Rosie. It seemed to him that he had been a loutish cad as well as\r\nan imbecile.\r\n\r\nWhat should he do about it? He sat for a long time wondering.\r\n\r\nIn the end he decided that the best thing would be to go and tell Rosie\r\nall about it, all about everything.\r\n\r\nAbout Mrs. Viveash too? Yes, about Mrs. Viveash too. He would get over\r\nMrs. Viveash more easily and more rapidly if he did. And he would begin\r\nto try and find out about Rosie. He would explore her. He would discover\r\nall the other things besides an incapacity to learn physiology that were\r\nin her. He would discover her, he would quicken his affection for her\r\ninto something livelier and more urgent. And they would begin again;\r\nmore satisfactorily this time; with knowledge and understanding; wise\r\nfrom their experience.\r\n\r\nShearwater got up from his chair before the writing-table, lurched\r\npensively towards the door, bumping into the revolving bookcase and the\r\narm-chair as he went, and walked down the passage to the drawing-room.\r\nRosie did not turn her head as he came in, but went on reading without\r\nchanging her position, her slippered feet still higher than her head,\r\nher legs still charmingly avowing themselves.\r\n\r\nShearwater came to a halt in front of the empty fireplace. He stood\r\nthere with his back to it, as though warming himself before an imaginary\r\nflame. It was, he felt, the safest, the most strategic point from which\r\nto talk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you reading?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Le Sopha_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d Rosie scornfully echoed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the great\r\nFrench classics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho by?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCr\xc3\xa9billon the younger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever heard of him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater. There was a silence. Rosie went\r\non reading.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt just occurred to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Shearwater began again in his rather\r\nponderous, infelicitous way, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be very happy, Rosie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosie looked up at him and laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat put that into your head?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShearwater was left a little at a loss. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m very glad to hear\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI only thought ... that perhaps _you_ might think ...\r\nthat _I_ rather neglected you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosie laughed again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is all this about?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have it rather on my conscience,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater. \xe2\x80\x9cI begin to\r\nsee ... something has made me see ... that I\xe2\x80\x99ve not.... I don\xe2\x80\x99t treat\r\nyou very well....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t n\xe2\x80\x94notice it, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Rosie, still smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI leave you out too much,\xe2\x80\x9d Shearwater went on with a kind of\r\ndesperation, running his fingers through his thick brown hair. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshare enough together. You\xe2\x80\x99re too much outside my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut after all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosie, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are a civ\xe2\x80\x94vilized couple. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto live in one another\xe2\x80\x99s pockets, do we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but we\xe2\x80\x99re really no more than strangers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t right. And it\xe2\x80\x99s my fault. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never tried to get into touch with\r\nyour life. But you did your best to understand mine ... at the beginning\r\nof our marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _then\xe2\x80\x94n_!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosie, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou found out what a little idiot\r\nI was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make a joke of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shearwater. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t a joke. It\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nserious. I tell you, I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to see how stupid and inconsiderate and\r\nun-understanding I\xe2\x80\x99ve been with you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to see quite suddenly.\r\nThe fact is,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on with a rush, like an uncorked fountain, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen seeing a woman recently whom I like very much, and who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d Speaking of Mrs. Viveash, unconsciously he spoke her language. For\r\nMrs. Viveash people always euphemistically \xe2\x80\x98liked\xe2\x80\x99 one another rather a\r\nlot, even when it was a case of the most frightful and excruciating\r\npassion, the most complete abandonments. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd somehow that\xe2\x80\x99s made me see\r\na lot of things which I\xe2\x80\x99d been blind to before\xe2\x80\x94blind deliberately, I\r\nsuppose. It\xe2\x80\x99s made me see, among other things, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve really been to\r\nblame towards you, Rosie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosie listened with an astonishment which she perfectly disguised. So\r\nJames was embarking on his little affairs, was he? It seemed incredible,\r\nand also, as she looked at her husband\xe2\x80\x99s face\xe2\x80\x94the face behind its\r\nbristlingly manly mask of a harassed baby\xe2\x80\x94also rather pathetically\r\nabsurd. She wondered who it could be. But she displayed no curiosity.\r\nShe would find out soon enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you should have been unhappy about it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s finished now.\xe2\x80\x9d Shearwater made a decided little gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosie. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should persevere.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at him,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\nShearwater was taken aback by this display of easy detachment. He had\r\nimagined the conversation so very differently, as something so serious,\r\nso painful and, at the same time, so healing and soothing, that he did\r\nnot know how to go on. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hesitatingly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nyou ... that we ... after this experience ... I would try to get closer\r\nto you....\xe2\x80\x9d (Oh, it sounded ridiculous!) ... \xe2\x80\x9cWe might start again, from\r\na different place, so to speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, _cher ami_,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Rosie, with the inflection and in the\r\npreferred tongue of Mr. Mercaptan, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t seriously expect us to do\r\nthe Darby and Joan business, can you? You\xe2\x80\x99re distressing yourself quite\r\nunnecessarily on my account. I don\xe2\x80\x99t find you neglect me or anything\r\nlike it. You have your life\xe2\x80\x94naturally. And I have mine. We don\xe2\x80\x99t get in\r\none another\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s the ideal sort of married life?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nShearwater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s obviously the most civ\xe2\x80\x94vilized,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosie answered, laughing.\r\n\r\nConfronted by Rosie\xe2\x80\x99s civilization, Shearwater felt helpless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d hoped ... I\xe2\x80\x99d thought....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went back to his study to think things over. The more he thought them\r\nover, the more he blamed himself. And incessantly the memory of Mrs.\r\nViveash tormented him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Mr. Mercaptan, Lypiatt had gone straight home. The bright\r\nday seemed to deride him. With its shining red omnibuses, its parasols,\r\nits muslin girls, its young-leaved trees, its bands at the street\r\ncorners, it was too much of a garden party to be tolerable. He wanted to\r\nbe alone. He took a cab back to the studio. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford it, of\r\ncourse; but what did that matter, what did that matter now?\r\n\r\nThe cab drove slowly and as though with reluctance down the dirty mews.\r\nHe paid it off, opened his little door between the wide stable doors,\r\nclimbed the steep ladder of his stairs and was at home. He sat down and\r\ntried to think.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeath, death, death, death,\xe2\x80\x9d he kept repeating to himself, moving his\r\nlips as though he were praying. If he said the word often enough, if he\r\naccustomed himself completely to the idea, death would come almost by\r\nitself; he would know it already, while he was still alive, he would\r\npass almost without noticing out of life into death. Into death, he\r\nthought, into death. Death like a well. The stone falls, falls, second\r\nafter second; and at last there is a sound, a far-off, horrible sound of\r\ndeath and then nothing more. The well at Carisbrooke, with a donkey to\r\nwind the wheel that pulls up the bucket of water, of icy water.... He\r\nthought for a long time of the well of death.\r\n\r\nOutside in the mews a barrel-organ struck up the tune of \xe2\x80\x98Where do flies\r\ngo in the winter-time?\xe2\x80\x99 Lypiatt lifted his head to listen. He smiled to\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x98Where _do_ flies go?\xe2\x80\x99 The question asked itself with a\r\ndramatic, a tragical appositeness. At the end of everything\xe2\x80\x94the last\r\nludicrous touch. He saw it all from outside. He pictured himself sitting\r\nthere alone, broken. He looked at his hand lying limp on the table in\r\nfront of him. It needed only the stigma of the nail to make it the hand\r\nof a dead Christ.\r\n\r\nThere, he was making literature of it again. Even now. He buried his\r\nface in his hands. His mind was full of twisted darkness, of an\r\nunspeakable, painful confusion. It was too difficult, too difficult.\r\n\r\nThe inkpot, he found when he wanted to begin writing, contained nothing\r\nbut a parched black sediment. He had been meaning for days past to get\r\nsome more ink; and he had always forgotten. He would have to write in\r\npencil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you remember, Myra, that time we went\r\ndown into the country\xe2\x80\x94you remember\xe2\x80\x94under the Hog\xe2\x80\x99s Back at that little\r\ninn they were trying to make pretentious? \xe2\x80\x98Hotel Bull\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94do you remember?\r\nHow we laughed over the Hotel Bull! And how we liked the country outside\r\nits doors! All the world in a few square miles. Chalk-pits and blue\r\nbutterflies on the Hog\xe2\x80\x99s Back. And at the foot of the hill, suddenly,\r\nthe sand; the hard, yellow sand with those queer caves, dug when and by\r\nwhat remote villains at the edge of the Pilgrims\xe2\x80\x99 Way? the fine grey\r\nsand on which the heather of Puttenham Common grows. And the flagstaff\r\nand the inscription marking the place where Queen Victoria stood to look\r\nat the view. And the enormous sloping meadows round Compton and the\r\nthick, dark woods. And the lakes, the heaths, the Scotch firs at Cutt\r\nMill. The forests of Shackleford. There was everything. Do you remember\r\nhow we enjoyed it all? I did, in any case. I was happy during those\r\nthree days. And I loved you, Myra. And I thought you might, you might\r\nperhaps, some day, love me. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t. And my love has only brought me\r\nunhappiness. Perhaps it has been my fault. Perhaps I ought to have known\r\nhow to make you give me happiness. You remember that wonderful sonnet of\r\nMichelangelo\xe2\x80\x99s, where he says that the loved woman is like a block of\r\nmarble from which the artist knows how to cut the perfect statue of his\r\ndreams. If the statue turns out a bad one, if it\xe2\x80\x99s death instead of love\r\nthat the lover gets\xe2\x80\x94why, the fault lies in the artist and in the lover,\r\nnot in the marble, not in the beloved.\r\n\r\n              Amor dunque non ha, ne tua beltate,\r\n              O fortuna, o durezza, o gran disdegno,\r\n              Del mio mal colpa, o mio destino, o sorte.\r\n\r\n              Se dentro del tuo cor morte e pietate\r\n              Porti in un tempo, e ch\xe2\x80\x99l mio basso ingegno\r\n              Non sappia ardendo trarne altro che morte.\r\n\r\nYes, it was my _basso ingegno_: my low genius which did not know how to\r\ndraw love from you, nor beauty from the materials of which art is made.\r\nAh, now you\xe2\x80\x99ll smile to yourself and say: Poor Casimir, he has come to\r\nadmit that at last? Yes, yes, I have come to admit everything. That I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t paint, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t write, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make music. That I was a\r\ncharlatan and a quack. That I was a ridiculous actor of heroic parts who\r\ndeserved to be laughed at\xe2\x80\x94and _was_ laughed at. But then every man is\r\nludicrous if you look at him from outside, without taking into account\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s going on in his heart and mind. You could turn Hamlet into an\r\nepigrammatic farce with an inimitable scene when he takes his adored\r\nmother in adultery. You could make the wittiest Guy de Maupassant short\r\nstory out of the life of Christ, by contrasting the mad rabbi\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npretensions with his abject fate. It\xe2\x80\x99s a question of the point of view.\r\nEvery one\xe2\x80\x99s a walking farce and a walking tragedy at the same time. The\r\nman who slips on a banana-skin and fractures his skull describes against\r\nthe sky, as he falls, the most richly comical arabesque. And you,\r\nMyra\xe2\x80\x94what do you suppose the unsympathetic gossips say of you? What sort\r\nof a farce of the Boulevards is your life in their eyes? For me, Myra,\r\nyou seem to move all the time through some nameless and incomprehensible\r\ntragedy. For them you are what? Merely any sort of a wanton, with\r\namusing adventures. And what am I? A charlatan, a quack, a pretentious,\r\nboasting, rhodomontading imbecile, incapable of painting anything but\r\nvermouth posters. (Why did that hurt so terribly? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. There\r\nwas no reason why you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think so if you wanted to.) I was all\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x94and grotesquely laughable. And very likely your laughter was\r\njustified, your judgment was true. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell. Perhaps I\r\nam a charlatan. Perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99m insincere; boasting to others, deceiving\r\nmyself. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I tell you. Everything is confusion in my mind\r\nnow. The whole fabric seems to have tumbled to pieces; it lies in a\r\nhorrible chaos. I can make no order within myself. Have I lied to\r\nmyself? have I acted and postured the Great Man to persuade myself that\r\nI am one? have I something in me, or nothing? have I ever achieved\r\nanything of worth, anything that rhymed with my conceptions, my dreams\r\n(for those were fine; of that, I _am_ certain)? I look into the chaos\r\nthat is my soul and, I tell you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But what I\r\ndo know is that I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent nearly twenty years now playing the charlatan\r\nat whom you all laugh. That I\xe2\x80\x99ve suffered, in mind and in body\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94almost from hunger, sometimes\xe2\x80\x94in order to play it. That I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nstruggled, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve exultantly climbed to the attack, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nthrown down\xe2\x80\x94ah, many times!\xe2\x80\x94that I\xe2\x80\x99ve picked myself up and started\r\nagain. Well, I suppose all that\xe2\x80\x99s ludicrous, if you like to think of it\r\nthat way. It is ludicrous that a man should put himself to prolonged\r\ninconvenience for the sake of something which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really exist at\r\nall. It\xe2\x80\x99s exquisitely comic, I can see. I can see it in the abstract, so\r\nto speak. But in this particular case, you must remember I\xe2\x80\x99m not a\r\ndispassionate observer. And if I am overcome now, it is not with\r\nlaughter. It is with an indescribable unhappiness, with the bitterness\r\nof death itself. Death, death, death. I repeat the word to myself, again\r\nand again. I think of death, I try to imagine it, I hang over it,\r\nlooking down, where the stones fall and fall and there is one horrible\r\nnoise, and then silence again; looking down into the well of death. It\r\nis so deep that there is no glittering eye of water to be seen at the\r\nbottom. I have no candle to send down. It is horrible, but I do not want\r\nto go on living. Living would be worse than....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLypiatt was reaching out for another sheet of paper when he was startled\r\nto hear the sound of feet on the stairs. He turned towards the door. His\r\nheart beat with violence. He was filled with a strange sense of\r\napprehension. In terror he awaited the approach of some unknown and\r\nterrible being. The feet of the angel of death were on the stairs. Up,\r\nup, up. Lypiatt felt himself trembling as the sound came nearer. He knew\r\nfor certain that in a few seconds he was going to die. The hangmen had\r\nalready pinioned him; the soldiers of the firing squad had already\r\nraised their rifles. One, two, ... he thought of Mrs. Viveash standing,\r\nbare-headed, the wind blowing in her hair, at the foot of the flagstaff\r\nfrom the site of which Queen Victoria had admired the distant view of\r\nSelborne; he thought of her dolorously smiling; he remembered that once\r\nshe had taken his head between her two hands and kissed him: \xe2\x80\x98Because\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re such a golden ass,\xe2\x80\x99 she had said, laughing. Three.... There was a\r\nlittle tap at the door. Lypiatt pressed his hand over his heart. The\r\ndoor opened.\r\n\r\nA small, bird-like man with a long, sharp nose and eyes as round and\r\nblack and shining as buttons stepped into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Lydgate, I presume?\xe2\x80\x9d he began. Then looked at a card on which a\r\nname and address were evidently written. \xe2\x80\x9cLypiatt, I mean. A thousand\r\npardons. Mr. Lypiatt, I presume?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLypiatt leaned back in his chair and shut his eyes. His face was as\r\nwhite as paper. He breathed hard and his temples were wet with sweat, as\r\nthough he had been running.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found the door down below open, so I came straight up. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nexcuse....\xe2\x80\x9d The stranger smiled apologetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d Lypiatt asked, reopening his eyes. His heart was still\r\nbeating hard; after the storm it calmed itself slowly. He drew back from\r\nthe brink of the fearful well; the time had not yet come to plunge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9cis Boldero, Herbert Boldero. Our mutual\r\nfriend Mr. Gumbril, Mr. Theodore Gumbril, junior,\xe2\x80\x9d he made it more\r\nprecise, \xe2\x80\x9csuggested that I might come and see you about a little matter\r\nin which he and I are interested and in which perhaps you, too, might be\r\ninterested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLypiatt nodded, without saying anything.\r\n\r\nMr. Boldero, meanwhile, was turning his bright, bird-like eyes about the\r\nstudio. Mrs. Viveash\xe2\x80\x99s portrait, all but finished now, was clamped to\r\nthe easel. He approached it, a connoisseur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt reminds me very much,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cof Bacosso. Very much indeed, if I\r\nmay say so. Also a little of ...\xe2\x80\x9d he hesitated, trying to think of the\r\nname of that other fellow Gumbril had talked about. But being unable to\r\nremember the unimpressive syllables of Derain he played for safety and\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cof Orpen.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boldero looked inquiringly at Lypiatt to see if\r\nthat was right.\r\n\r\nLypiatt still spoke no word and seemed, indeed, not to have heard what\r\nhad been said.\r\n\r\nMr. Boldero saw that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much good talking about modern art. This\r\nchap, he thought, looked as though something were wrong with him. He\r\nhoped he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got influenza. There was a lot of the disease about.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis little affair I was speaking of,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, in another tone, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\na little business proposition that Mr. Gumbril and I have gone into\r\ntogether. A matter of pneumatic trousers,\xe2\x80\x9d he waved his hand airily.\r\n\r\nLypiatt suddenly burst out laughing, an embittered Titan. Where do flies\r\ngo? Where do souls go? The barrel-organ, and now pneumatic trousers!\r\nThen, as suddenly, he was silent again. More literature? Another piece\r\nof acting? \xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Boldero indulgently. \xe2\x80\x9cI know the idea\r\ndoes seem a little humorous, if I may say so, at first. But I assure\r\nyou, there\xe2\x80\x99s money in it, Mr. Lydgate\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Lypiatt. Money!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Boldero\r\npaused a moment dramatically. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cour idea was to\r\nlaunch the new product with a good swingeing publicity campaign. Spend a\r\nfew thousands in the papers and then get it good and strong into the\r\nUnderground and on the hoardings, along with Owbridge\xe2\x80\x99s and John Bull\r\nand the Golden Ballot. Now, for that, Mr. Lypiatt, we shall need, as you\r\ncan well imagine, a few good striking pictures. Mr. Gumbril mentioned\r\nyour name and suggested I should come and see you to find out if you\r\nwould perhaps be agreeable to lending us your talent for this work. And\r\nI may add, Mr. Lypiatt,\xe2\x80\x9d he spoke with real warmth, \xe2\x80\x9cthat having seen\r\nthis example of your work\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he pointed to the portrait of Mrs. Viveash\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nfeel that you would be eminently capable of....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not finish the sentence; for at this moment Lypiatt leapt up from\r\nhis chair and, making a shrill, inarticulate, animal noise, rushed on\r\nthe financier, seized him with both hands by the throat, shook him,\r\nthrew him to the floor, then picked him up again by the coat collar and\r\npushed him towards the door, kicking him as he went. A final kick sent\r\nMr. Boldero tobogganing down the steep stairs. Lypiatt ran down after\r\nhim; but Mr. Boldero had picked himself up, had opened the front door,\r\nslipped out, slammed it behind him, and was running up the mews before\r\nLypiatt could get to the bottom of the stairs.\r\n\r\nLypiatt opened the door and looked out. Mr. Boldero was already far\r\naway, almost at the Piranesian arch. He watched him till he was out of\r\nsight, then went upstairs again and threw himself face downwards on his\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nZoe ended the discussion by driving half an inch of pen-knife into\r\nColeman\xe2\x80\x99s left arm and running out of the flat, slamming the door behind\r\nher. Coleman was used to this sort of thing; this sort of thing, indeed,\r\nwas what he was there for. Carefully he pulled out the pen-knife which\r\nhad remained sticking in his arm. He looked at the blade and was\r\nrelieved to see that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so dirty as might have been expected. He\r\nfound some cotton-wool, mopped up the blood as it oozed out, and dabbed\r\nthe wound with iodine. Then he set himself to bandage it up. But to tie\r\na bandage round one\xe2\x80\x99s own left arm is not easy. Coleman found it\r\nimpossible to keep the lint in place, impossible to get the bandage\r\ntight enough. At the end of a quarter of an hour he had only succeeded\r\nin smearing himself very copiously with blood, and the wound was still\r\nunbound. He gave up the attempt and contented himself with swabbing up\r\nthe blood as it came out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd forthwith came there out blood and water,\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud, and\r\nlooked at the red stain on the cotton wool. He repeated the words again\r\nand again, and at the fiftieth repetition burst out laughing.\r\n\r\nThe bell in the kitchen suddenly buzzed. Who could it be? He went to the\r\nfront door and opened it. On the landing outside stood a tall slender\r\nyoung woman with slanting Chinese eyes and a wide mouth, elegantly\r\ndressed in a black frock piped with white. Keeping the cotton-wool still\r\npressed to his bleeding arm, Coleman bowed as gracefully as he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo come in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are just in the nick of time. I am on the\r\npoint of bleeding to death. And forthwith came there out blood and\r\nwater. Enter, enter,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, seeing the young woman still standing\r\nirresolutely on the threshold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I wanted to see Mr. Coleman,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, stammering a little and\r\nshowing her embarrassment by blushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Mr. Coleman.\xe2\x80\x9d He took the cotton-wool for a moment from his arm\r\nand looked with the air of a connoisseur at the blood on it. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nshall very soon cease to be that individual unless you come and tie up\r\nmy wounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99re not the Mr. Coleman I thought you were,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young\r\nlady, still more embarrassed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a beard, it is true; but....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I must resign myself to quit this life, must I?\xe2\x80\x9d He made a gesture\r\nof despair, throwing out both hands, \xe2\x80\x9cOut, out brief Coleman. Out,\r\ndamned spot,\xe2\x80\x9d and he made as though to close the door.\r\n\r\nThe young lady checked him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you really need tying up,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it of course. I passed my First-Aid Exam, in the war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColeman reopened the door. \xe2\x80\x9cSaved!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had been Rosie\xe2\x80\x99s original intention yesterday to go straight on from\r\nMr. Mercaptan\xe2\x80\x99s to Toto\xe2\x80\x99s. She would see him at once, she would ask him\r\nwhat he meant by playing that stupid trick on her. She would give him a\r\ngood talking to. She would even tell him that she would never see him\r\nagain. But, of course, if he showed himself sufficiently contrite and\r\nreasonably explanatory, she would consent\xe2\x80\x94oh, very reluctantly\xe2\x80\x94to take\r\nhim back into favour. In the free, unprejudiced circles in which she now\r\nmoved, this sort of joke, she imagined, was a mere trifle. It would be\r\nabsurd to quarrel seriously about it. But still, she was determined to\r\ngive Toto a lesson.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, she did finally leave Mr. Mercaptan\xe2\x80\x99s delicious boudoir,\r\nit was too late to think of going all the way to Pimlico, to the address\r\nwhich Mr. Mercaptan had given her. She decided to put it off till the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nAnd so the next day, duly, she had set out for Pimlico\xe2\x80\x94to Pimlico, and\r\nto see a man called Coleman! It seemed rather dull and second-rate after\r\nSloane Street and Mr. Mercaptan. Poor Toto!\xe2\x80\x94the sparkle of Mr. Mercaptan\r\nhad made him look rather tarnished. That essay on the \xe2\x80\x9cJus Prim\xc3\xa6\r\nNoctis\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94ah! Walking through the unsavoury mazes of Pimlico, she thought\r\nof it, and, thinking of it, smiled. Poor Toto! And also, she mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforget, stupid, malicious, idiotic Toto! She had made up her mind\r\nexactly what she should say to him; she had even made up her mind what\r\nToto would say to her. And when the scene was over they would go and\r\ndine at the Caf\xc3\xa9 Royal\xe2\x80\x94upstairs, where she had never been. And she would\r\nmake him rather jealous by telling him how much she had liked Mr.\r\nMercaptan; but not too jealous. Silence is golden, as her father used to\r\nsay when she used to fly into tempers and wanted to say nasty things to\r\neverybody within range. Silence, about some things, is certainly golden.\r\n\r\nIn the rather gloomy little turning off Lupus Street to which she had\r\nbeen directed, Rosie found the number, found, in the row of bells and\r\ncards, the name. Quickly and decidedly she mounted the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she was going to say as soon as she saw him, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were\r\na civilized being.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mercaptan had dropped a hint that Coleman wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreally civilized; a hint was enough for Rosie. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I see,\xe2\x80\x9d she would go\r\non, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I was mistaken. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to associate with boors.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nfastidious lady had selected him as a young poet, not as a ploughboy.\r\n\r\nWell rehearsed, Rosie rang the bell. And then the door had opened on\r\nthis huge bearded Cossack of a man, who smiled, who looked at her with\r\nbright, dangerous eyes, who quoted the Bible and who was bleeding like a\r\npig. There was blood on his shirt, blood on his trousers, blood on his\r\nhands, bloody finger-marks on his face; even the blond fringe of his\r\nbeard, she noticed, was dabbled here and there with blood. It was too\r\nmuch, at first, even for her aristocratic equanimity.\r\n\r\nIn the end, however, she followed him across a little vestibule into a\r\nbright, whitewashed room empty of all furniture but a table, a few\r\nchairs and a large box-spring and mattress, which stood like an island\r\nin the middle of the floor and served as bed or sofa as occasion\r\nrequired. Over the mantelpiece was pinned a large photographic\r\nreproduction of Leonardo\xe2\x80\x99s study of the anatomy of love. There were no\r\nother pictures on the walls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the apparatus is here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman, and he pointed to the table.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLint, bandages, cotton-wool, iodine, gauze, oiled silk. I have them all\r\nready in preparation for these little accidents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you often manage to cut yourself in the arm?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rosie. She\r\ntook off her gloves and began to undo a fresh packet of lint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne gets cut,\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman explained. \xe2\x80\x9cLittle differences of opinion, you\r\nknow. If your eye offend you, pluck it out; love your neighbour as\r\nyourself. Argal: if his eye offend you\xe2\x80\x94you see? We live on Christian\r\nprinciples here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who are \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rosie, giving the cut a last dressing of\r\niodine and laying a big square of lint over it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerely myself and\xe2\x80\x94how shall I put it?\xe2\x80\x94my helpmate,\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you\xe2\x80\x99re wonderfully skilful at this business,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nthe real hospital nurse type; all maternal instincts. When pain and\r\nanguish wring the brow, an interesting mangle thou, as we used to say in\r\nthe good old days when the pun and the Spoonerismus were in fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosie laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t spend all my time tying up wounds,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, and turned her eyes for an instant from the bandage. After the\r\nfirst surprise she was feeling her cool self again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrava!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Coleman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou make them too, do you? Make them first and\r\ncure them afterwards in the grand old hom\xc5\x93opathic way. Delightful! You\r\nsee what Leonardo has to say about it.\xe2\x80\x9d With his free hand he pointed to\r\nthe photograph over the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\nRosie, who had noticed the picture when she came into the room,\r\npreferred not to look at it too closely a second time. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrather revolting,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and was very busy with the bandage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but that\xe2\x80\x99s the point, that\xe2\x80\x99s the whole point,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman, and\r\nhis clear blue eyes were alive with dancing lights. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the beauty\r\nof the grand passion. It _is_ revolting. You read what the Fathers of\r\nthe Church have to say about love. They\xe2\x80\x99re the men. It was Odo of Cluny,\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t it, who called woman a _saccus stercoris_, a bag of muck. _Si\r\nquis enim considerat qu\xc3\xa6 intra nares et qu\xc3\xa6 intra fauces et qu\xc3\xa6 intra\r\nventrem lateant, sordes ubique reperiet._\xe2\x80\x9d The Latin rumbled like\r\neloquent thunder in Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. \xe2\x80\x9c_Et si nec extremis digitis flegma\r\nvel stercus tangere patimur, quomodo ipsum stercoris saccum amplecti\r\ndesideramus._\xe2\x80\x9d He smacked his lips. \xe2\x80\x9cMagnificent!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand Latin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosie, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m glad of it. And your\r\nbandage is finished. Look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInteresting mangle!\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman smiled his thanks. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Bishop Odo, I\r\nfear, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even have spared you; not even for your good works. Still\r\nless for your good looks, which would only have provoked him to dwell\r\nwith the more insistency on the visceral secrets which they conceal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosie protested. She would have liked to get up and go away,\r\nbut the Cossack\xe2\x80\x99s blue eyes glittered at her with such a strange\r\nexpression and he smiled so enigmatically, that she found herself still\r\nsitting where she was, listening with a disgusted pleasure to his quick\r\ntalk, his screams of deliberate and appalling laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, throwing up his hands, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat sensualists these old\r\nfellows were! What a real voluptuous feeling they had for dirt and gloom\r\nand sordidness and boredom, and all the horrors of vice. They pretended\r\nthey were trying to dissuade people from vice by enumerating its\r\nhorrors. But they were really only making it more spicy by telling the\r\ntruth about it. _O esca vermium, O massa pulveris!_ What nauseating\r\nembracements! To conjugate the copulative verb, boringly, with a sack of\r\ntripes\xe2\x80\x94what could be more exquisitely and piercingly and deliriously\r\nvile?\xe2\x80\x9d And he threw back his head and laughed; the blood-dabbled tips of\r\nhis blond beard shook. Rosie looked at them, fascinated with disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s blood on your beard,\xe2\x80\x9d she felt compelled to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of it? Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t there be?\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman asked.\r\n\r\nConfused, Rosie felt herself blushing. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly because it\xe2\x80\x99s rather\r\nunpl\xe2\x80\x94leasant. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. But it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a reason for immediately falling into my arms!\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman. \xe2\x80\x9cTo\r\nbe kissed by a beard is bad enough at any time. But by a bloody\r\nbeard\xe2\x80\x94imagine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosie shuddered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat interest or amusement is there in doing the\r\nordinary things in the obvious way? Life _au naturel_.\xe2\x80\x9d He shook his\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must have garlic and saffron. Do you believe in God?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot m\xe2\x80\x94much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosie, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pity you. You must find existence dreadfully dull. As soon as you do,\r\neverything becomes a thousand times life-size. Phallic symbols five\r\nhundred feet high,\xe2\x80\x9d he lifted his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cA row of grinning teeth you\r\ncould run the hundred yards on.\xe2\x80\x9d He grinned at her through his beard.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWounds big enough to let a coach-and-six drive into their purulent\r\nrecesses. Every slightest act eternally significant. It\xe2\x80\x99s only when you\r\nbelieve in God, and especially in hell, that you can really begin\r\nenjoying life. For instance, when in a few moments you surrender\r\nyourself to the importunities of my bloody beard, how prodigiously much\r\nmore you\xe2\x80\x99d enjoy it if you could believe you were committing the sin\r\nagainst the Holy Ghost\xe2\x80\x94if you kept thinking calmly and dispassionately\r\nall the time the affair was going on: All this is not only a horrible\r\nsin, it is also ugly, grotesque, a mere def\xc3\xa6cation, a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosie held up her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re really horrible,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Coleman\r\nsmiled at her. Still, she did not go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe who is not with me is against me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you can\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\nup your mind to be with, it\xe2\x80\x99s surely better to be positively against\r\nthan merely negatively indifferent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Rosie feebly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I call my lover a nymphomaniacal dog, she runs the pen-knife into\r\nmy arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do you enjoy it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rosie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPiercingly,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is at once sordid to the last and lowest\r\ndegree and infinitely and eternally significant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColeman was silent and Rosie too said nothing. Futilely she wished it\r\n_had_ been Toto instead of this horrible, dangerous Cossack. Mr.\r\nMercaptan ought to have warned her. But then, of course, he supposed\r\nthat she already knew the creature. She looked up at him and found his\r\nbright eyes fixed upon her; he was silently laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want to know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how I got here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColeman blandly shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cNot in the very least,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nRosie felt more helpless, somehow, than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked as\r\nbravely and impertinently as she could.\r\n\r\nColeman answered with another question. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be natural curiosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I know all I want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a woman, or, at any\r\nrate, you have all the female stigmata. Not too sumptuously\r\nwell-developed, let me add. You have no wooden legs. You have eyelids\r\nthat flutter up and down over your eyes like a moving shutter in front\r\nof a signalling lamp, spelling out in a familiar code the letters:\r\nA.M.O.R., and not, unless I am very much mistaken, those others:\r\nC.A.S.T.I.T.A.S. You have a mouth that looks as though it knew how to\r\ntaste and how to bite. You....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosie jumped up. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going away,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nColeman leaned back in his chair and hallooed with laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cBite,\r\nbite, bite,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThirty-two times.\xe2\x80\x9d And he opened and shut his\r\nmouth as fast as he could, so that his teeth clicked against one another\r\nwith a little dry, bony noise. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery mouthful thirty-two times. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat Mr. Gladstone said. And surely Mr. Gladstone\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he rattled his sharp,\r\nwhite teeth again\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csurely Mr. Gladstone should know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosie from the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman called back; and immediately afterwards jumped to\r\nhis feet and made a dash across the room towards her.\r\n\r\nRosie uttered a cry, slipped through the door and, slamming it behind\r\nher, ran across the vestibule and began fumbling with the latches of the\r\nouter door. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t open, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t open. She was trembling; fear\r\nmade her feel sick. There was a rattling at the door behind her. There\r\nwas a whoop of laughter, and then the Cossack\xe2\x80\x99s hands were on her arms,\r\nhis face came peering over her shoulder, and the blond beard dabbled\r\nwith blood prickled against her neck and face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she implored, turning away her head. Then all\r\nat once she began violently crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTears!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Coleman in rapture, \xe2\x80\x9cgenuine tears!\xe2\x80\x9d He bent eagerly\r\nforward to kiss them away, to drink them as they fell. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an\r\nintoxication,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking up to the ceiling like a chicken that\r\nhas taken a sip of water; he smacked his lips.\r\n\r\nSobbing uncontrollably, Rosie had never in all her life felt less like a\r\ngreat, fastidious lady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, \xe2\x80\x9chere I am again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlready?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash had been reduced, by the violence of her\r\nheadache, to coming home after her luncheon with Piers Cotton for a\r\nrest. She had fed her hungry pain on Pyramidon and now she was lying\r\ndown on the Dufy-upholstered sofa at the foot of her full-length\r\nportrait by Jacques-Emile Blanche. Her head was not much better, but she\r\nwas bored. When the maid had announced Gumbril, she had given word that\r\nhe was to be let in. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very ill,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on expiringly. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d she pointed to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cand me again.\xe2\x80\x9d She waved her hand towards\r\nthe sizzling brilliance of the portrait. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore and after. Like the\r\nadvertisements, you know. Every picture tells a story.\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed\r\nfaintly, then made a little grimace and, sucking in the breath between\r\nher lips, she put her hand to her forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Myra.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril pulled up a chair to the sofa and sat there like\r\na doctor at his patient\xe2\x80\x99s bedside. \xe2\x80\x9cBut before and after what?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked, almost professionally.\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash gave an all but imperceptible shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot influenza, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot love, by any chance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash did not venture another laugh; she contented herself with\r\nsmiling agonizingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would have been a just retribution,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril went on, \xe2\x80\x9cafter what\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve done to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done to you?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash asked, opening wide her\r\npale-blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerely wrecked my existence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99re being childish, Theodore. Say what you mean without these\r\ngrand, silly phrases.\xe2\x80\x9d The dying voice spoke with impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, \xe2\x80\x9cis merely this. You prevented me\r\nfrom going to see the only person I ever really wanted to see in my\r\nlife. And yesterday, when I tried to see her, she was gone. Vanished.\r\nAnd here am I left in the vacuum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash shut her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all in the vacuum,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstill have plenty of company, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d She was silent for a moment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me? And why didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou just pay no attention to me and go all the same?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril answered, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause, then, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\r\nAnd I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to quarrel with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, and patted his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cBut what are you\r\ngoing to do about it now? Not quarrelling with me is only a rather\r\nnegative satisfaction, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI propose to leave the country to-morrow morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the classical remedy.... But not to shoot big game, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nthought of Viveash among the Tikki-tikkis and the tsetses. He was a\r\ncharming creature; charming, but ... but what?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you take me for? Big game!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe leaned back in his chair and began to laugh, heartily, for the first\r\ntime since he had returned from Robertsbridge, yesterday evening. He had\r\nfelt then as though he would never laugh again. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you see me in a pith\r\nhelmet, with an elephant gun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash put her hand to her forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cI see you, Theodore,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I try to think you would look quite normal; because of my\r\nhead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go to Paris first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I shall\r\ngo wherever I think people will buy pneumatic trousers. I\xe2\x80\x99m travelling\r\non business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time, in spite of her head, Mrs. Viveash laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought of giving myself a farewell banquet,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo round before dinner, if you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling well enough, that is, and\r\ncollect a few friends. Then, in profoundest gloom, we\xe2\x80\x99ll eat and drink.\r\nAnd in the morning, unshaved, exhausted and filled with disgust, I shall\r\ntake the train from Victoria, feeling thankful to get out of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash faintly and indomitably from the sofa\r\nthat was almost genuinely a death-bed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, meanwhile, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a\r\nsecond brew of tea and you shall talk to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tannin was brought in. Gumbril settled down to talk and Mrs. Viveash\r\nto listen\xe2\x80\x94to listen and from time to time to dab her brows with\r\neau-de-Cologne, to take a sniff of hartshorn.\r\n\r\nGumbril talked. He talked of the marriage ceremonies of octopuses, of\r\nthe rites intricately consummated in the submarine green grottos of the\r\nIndian Ocean. Given a total of sixteen arms, how many permutations and\r\ncombinations of caresses? And in the middle of each bunch of arms a\r\nmouth like the beak of a macaw.\r\n\r\nOn the backside of the moon, his friend Umbilikoff, the mystic, used to\r\nassure him, the souls of the dead in the form of little bladders\xe2\x80\x94like so\r\nmuch swelled sago\xe2\x80\x94are piled up and piled up till they squash and squeeze\r\none another with an excruciating and ever-growing pressure. In the\r\nexoteric world this squeezing on the moon\xe2\x80\x99s backside is known,\r\nerroneously, as hell. And as for the constellation, Scorpio\xe2\x80\x94he was the\r\nfirst of all constellations to have a proper sort of backbone. For by an\r\neffort of the will he ingurgitated his external armour, he compressed\r\nand rebuilt it within his body and so became the first vertebrate. This,\r\nyou may well believe, was a notable day in cosmic history.\r\n\r\nThe rents in these new buildings in Regent Street and Piccadilly run to\r\nas much as three or four pounds a square foot. Meanwhile, all the beauty\r\nimagined by Nash has departed, and chaos and barbarism once more reign\r\nsupreme, even in Regent Street. The ghost of Gumbril Senior stalked\r\nacross the room.\r\n\r\nWho lives longer: the man who takes heroin for two years and dies, or\r\nthe man who lives on roast beef, water and potatoes till ninety-five?\r\nOne passes his twenty-four months in eternity. All the years of the\r\nbeef-eater are lived only in time. \xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you all about heroin,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\nLady Capricorn, he understood, was still keeping open bed. How Rubens\r\nwould have admired those silk cushions, those gigantic cabbage roses,\r\nthose round pink pearls of hers, vaster than those that Captain Nemo\r\ndiscovered in the immemorial oyster! And the warm dry rustle of flesh\r\nover flesh as she walks, moving first one leg, then advancing the other.\r\n\r\nTalking of octopuses, the swim-bladders of deep-sea fishes are filled\r\nwith almost absolutely pure oxygen. _C\xe2\x80\x99est la vie_\xe2\x80\x94Gumbril shrugged his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nIn Alpine pastures the grasshoppers start their flight, whizzing like\r\nclockwork grasshoppers. And these brown invisible ones reveal themselves\r\nsuddenly as they skim above the flowers\xe2\x80\x94a streak of blue lightning, a\r\ntrailing curve of scarlet. Then the overwing shuts down over the\r\ncoloured wing below and they are once more invisible fiddlers rubbing\r\ntheir thighs, like Lady Capricorn, at the foot of the towering flowers.\r\n\r\nForgers give patina to their medi\xc3\xa6val ivories by lending them to stout\r\nyoung Jewesses to wear for a few months hanging, like an amulet, between\r\ntheir breasts.\r\n\r\nIn Italian cemeteries the family vaults are made of glass and iron, like\r\ngreenhouses.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Griddle has finally married the hog-faced gentlewoman.\r\n\r\nPiero della Francesca\xe2\x80\x99s fresco of the Resurrection at San Sepolcro is\r\nthe most beautiful picture in the world, and the hotel there is far from\r\nbad. Scriabine = _le_ Tschaikovsky _de nos jours_. The dullest landscape\r\npainter is Marchand. The best poet....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bore me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust I talk of love, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gumbril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks like it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash answered, and closed her eyes.\r\n\r\nGumbril told the anecdote about Jo Peters, Connie Asticot and Jim Baum.\r\nThe anecdote of Lola Knopf and the Baroness Gnomon. Of Margherita\r\nRadicofani, himself, and the Pastor Meyer. Of Lord Cavey and little Toby\r\nNobes. When he had finished these, he saw that Mrs. Viveash had gone to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nHe was not flattered. But a little sleep would do her headache, he\r\nreflected, a world of good. And knowing that if he ceased to speak, she\r\nwould probably be woken by the sudden blankness of the silence, he went\r\non quietly talking to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I\xe2\x80\x99m abroad this time,\xe2\x80\x9d he soliloquized, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall really begin\r\nwriting my autobiography. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like a hotel bedroom to work\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d He scratched his head thoughtfully and even picked his nose, which\r\nwas one of his bad habits, when he was alone. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople who know me,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x9cwill think that what I write about the governess cart and my\r\nmother and the flowers and so on is written merely because I know in\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he scratched his head a little harder to show himself that he\r\nreferred to his brain, \xe2\x80\x9cthat that\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of thing one ought to write\r\nabout. They\xe2\x80\x99ll think I\xe2\x80\x99m a sort of dingy Romain Rolland, hopelessly\r\ntrying to pretend that I feel the emotions and have the great spiritual\r\nexperiences, which the really important people do feel and have. And\r\nperhaps they\xe2\x80\x99ll be right. Perhaps the Life of Gumbril will be as\r\nmanifestly an _ersatz_ as the Life of Beethoven. On the other hand, they\r\nmay be astonished to find that it\xe2\x80\x99s the genuine article. We shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGumbril nodded his head slowly, while he transferred two pennies from\r\nhis right-hand trouser pocket to his left-hand trouser pocket. He was\r\nsomewhat distressed to find that these coppers had been trespassing\r\namong the silver. Silver was for the right-hand, copper for the left. It\r\nwas one of the laws which it was extremely unlucky to infringe. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\na premonition,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat one of these days I may become a\r\nsaint. An unsuccessful flickering sort of saint, like a candle beginning\r\nto go out. As for love\xe2\x80\x94m\xe2\x80\x99yes, m\xe2\x80\x99yes. And as for the people I have met\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nshall point out that I have known most of the eminent men in Europe, and\r\nthat I have said of all of them what I said after my first love affair:\r\nIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you really say that about your first love affair?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs.\r\nViveash, who had woken up again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I said: This _is_ all\xe2\x80\x94everything, the universe. In love, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neither all or nothing at all.\xe2\x80\x9d She shut her eyes and almost immediately\r\nwent to sleep again.\r\n\r\nGumbril continued his lullaby-soliloquy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98This charming little book.\xe2\x80\x99... _The Scotsman._ \xe2\x80\x98This farrago of\r\nobscenity, slander and false psychology.\xe2\x80\x99... _Darlington Echo._ \xe2\x80\x98Mr.\r\nGumbril\xe2\x80\x99s first cousin is St. Francis Xavier, his second cousin is the\r\nEarl of Rochester, his third cousin is the Man of Feeling, his fourth\r\ncousin is David Hume.\xe2\x80\x99... _Court Journal._\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril was already tired of\r\nthis joke. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I consider how my light is spent,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I\r\nconsider!... Herr Jesu, as Fraulein Nimmernein used to exclaim at the\r\ncritical moment. Consider, dear cow, consider. This is not the time of\r\nyear for grass to grow. Consider, dear cow, consider, consider.\xe2\x80\x9d He got\r\nup from his chair and tiptoed across the room to the writing-table. An\r\nIndian dagger lay next to the blotting-pad; Mrs. Viveash used it as a\r\npaper-knife. Gumbril picked it up, executed several passes with it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThumb on the blade,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand strike upwards. On guard. Lunge. To\r\nthe hilt it penetrates. Poniard at the tip\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he ran the blade between his\r\nfingers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccaress by the time it reaches the hilt. Z\xe2\x80\x94zip.\xe2\x80\x9d He put down the\r\nknife and stopping for a moment to make a grimace at himself in the\r\nmirror over the mantelpiece, he went back to his chair.\r\n\r\nAt seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock Mrs. Viveash woke up. She shook her head to feel if the\r\npain were still rolling about loose inside her skull.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really believe I\xe2\x80\x99m all right,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She jumped up. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel ready for anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I feel like so much food for worms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cStill,\r\n_Versiam\xe2\x80\x99 a tazza piena il generoso umor_.\xe2\x80\x9d He hummed the Drinking Song\r\nout of _Robert the Devil_, and to that ingenuously jolly melody they\r\nleft the house.\r\n\r\nTheir taxi that evening cost them several pounds. They made the man\r\ndrive back and forth, like a shuttle, from one end of London to the\r\nother. Every time they passed through Piccadilly Circus Mrs. Viveash\r\nleant out of the window to look at the sky signs dancing their unceasing\r\nSt. Vitus\xe2\x80\x99s dance above the monument to the Earl of Shaftesbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I adore them!\xe2\x80\x9d she said the first time they passed them. \xe2\x80\x9cThose\r\nwheels that whizz round till the sparks fly out from under them: that\r\nrushing motor, and that lovely bottle of port filling the glass and then\r\ndisappearing and reappearing and filling it again. Too lovely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo revolting,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril corrected her. \xe2\x80\x9cThese things are the epileptic\r\nsymbol of all that\xe2\x80\x99s most bestial and idiotic in contemporary life. Look\r\nat those beastly things and then look at that.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed to the County\r\nFire Office on the northern side of the Circus. \xe2\x80\x9cThere stands decency,\r\ndignity, beauty, repose. And there flickers, there gibbers and\r\ntwitches\xe2\x80\x94what? Restlessness, distraction, refusal to think, anything for\r\nan unquiet life....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a delicious pedant you are!\xe2\x80\x9d She turned away from the window, put\r\nher hands on his shoulders and looked at him. \xe2\x80\x9cToo exquisitely\r\nridiculous!\xe2\x80\x9d And she kissed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t force me to change my opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril smiled at her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Eppur\xe2\x80\x99 si muove_\xe2\x80\x94I stick to my guns like Galileo. They move and\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re horrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash emphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cThose things are me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey drove first to Lypiatt\xe2\x80\x99s mews. Under the Piranesian arch. The\r\nclothes-lines looped from window to window across the street might have\r\nbeen those ropes which form so essential and so mysterious a part of the\r\nfurniture of the Prisons. The place smelt, the children were shouting;\r\nthe hyena-like laughter of the flappers reverberated between the\r\nclose-set walls. All Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s sense of social responsibility was\r\naroused in a moment.\r\n\r\nShut up in his room all day, Lypiatt had been writing\xe2\x80\x94writing his whole\r\nlife, all his ideas and ideals, all for Myra. The pile of scribbled\r\nsheets grew higher and higher. Towards evening he made an end; he had\r\nwritten all that he wanted to write. He ate the remains of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nloaf of bread and drank some water; for he realized suddenly that he had\r\nbeen fasting the whole day. Then he composed himself to think; he\r\nstretched himself out on the brink of the well and looked down into the\r\neyeless darkness.\r\n\r\nHe still had his Service revolver. Taking it out of the drawer in which\r\nit was kept, he loaded it, he laid it on the packing-case which served\r\nhim as a table at his bed\xe2\x80\x99s head, and stretched himself out on the bed.\r\nHe lay quite still, his muscles all relaxed, hardly breathing. He\r\nimagined himself dead. Derision! there was still the plunge into the\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nHe picked up the pistol, looked down the barrel. Black and deep as the\r\nwell. The muzzle against his forehead was a cold mouth.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing new to be thought about death. There was not even the\r\npossibility of a new thought. Only the old thoughts, the horrible old\r\nquestions returned.\r\n\r\nThe cold mouth to his forehead, his finger pressing on the trigger.\r\nAlready he would be falling, falling. And the annihilating crash would\r\nbe the same as the far-away sound of death at the bottom of the well.\r\nAnd after that, in the silence? The old question was still the same.\r\n\r\nAfter that, he would lie bleeding. The flies would drink his blood as\r\nthough it were red honey. In the end the people would come and fetch him\r\naway, and the coroner\xe2\x80\x99s jury would look at him in the mortuary and\r\npronounce him temporarily insane. Then he would be buried in a black\r\nhole, would be buried and decay.\r\n\r\nAnd meanwhile, would there be anything else? There was nothing new to be\r\nthought or asked. And there was still no answer.\r\n\r\nIn the room it began to grow dark; colours vanished, forms ran together.\r\nThe easel and Myra\xe2\x80\x99s portrait were now a single black silhouette against\r\nthe window. Near and far were fused, become one and continuous in the\r\ndarkness, became a part of the darkness. Outside the window the pale\r\ntwilight grew more sombre. The children shouted shrilly, playing their\r\ngames under the green gas lamps. The mirthless, ferocious laughter of\r\nyoung girls mocked and invited. Lypiatt stretched out his hand and\r\nfingered the pistol.\r\n\r\nDown below, at his door, he heard a sharp knocking. He lifted his head\r\nand listened, caught the sound of two voices, a man\xe2\x80\x99s and a woman\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nMyra\xe2\x80\x99s voice he recognized at once; the other, he supposed, was\r\nGumbril\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHideous to think that people actually live in places like this,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGumbril was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at those children. It ought to be punishable\r\nby law to produce children in this street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey always take me for the Pied Piper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. Lypiatt got\r\nup and crept to the window. He could hear all they said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if Lypiatt\xe2\x80\x99s in. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any sign of a light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he has heavy curtains,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, \xe2\x80\x9cand I know for a fact\r\nthat he always composes his poetry in the dark. He may be composing\r\npoetry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnock again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cPoets are always absorbed, you know.\r\nAnd Casimir\xe2\x80\x99s always the poet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Il Poeta_\xe2\x80\x94capital P. Like d\xe2\x80\x99Annunzio in the Italian papers,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you know that d\xe2\x80\x99Annunzio has books printed on mackintosh\r\nfor his bath?\xe2\x80\x9d He rapped again at the door. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw it in the _Corriere\r\ndella Sera_ the other day at the club. He reads the _Little Flowers of\r\nSt. Francis_ by preference in his bath. And he has a fountain pen with\r\nwaterproof ink in the soap-dish, so that he can add a few Fioretti of\r\nhis own whenever he feels like it. We might suggest that to Casimir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLypiatt stood with folded arms by the window, listening. How lightly\r\nthey threw his life, his heart, from hand to hand, as though it were a\r\nball and they were playing a game! He thought suddenly of all the times\r\nhe had spoken lightly and maliciously of other people. His own person\r\nhad always seemed, on those occasions, sacred. One knew in theory very\r\nwell that others spoke of one contemptuously\xe2\x80\x94as one spoke of them. In\r\npractice\xe2\x80\x94it was hard to believe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Casimir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid his show was a failure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cComplete and absolute. I told my tame\r\ncapitalist that he ought to employ Lypiatt for our advertisements. He\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe excellent for those. And it would mean some genuine money in his\r\npocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the worst of it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he\xe2\x80\x99ll only feel\r\ninsulted by the suggestion.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked up at the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthis house looks most horribly dead. I\r\nhope nothing\xe2\x80\x99s happened to poor Casimir. I have a most disagreeable\r\nfeeling that it may have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, this famous feminine intuition,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Gumbril. He knocked again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling that he may be lying there dead, or delirious, or\r\nsomething.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I can\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling that he must have gone out to dinner. We shall\r\nhave to give him up, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity. He\xe2\x80\x99s so good with\r\nMercaptan. Like bear and mastiff. Or rather, like bear and poodle, bear\r\nand King Charles\xe2\x80\x99s spaniel\xe2\x80\x94or whatever those little dogs are that you\r\nsee ladies in eighteenth-century French engravings taking to bed with\r\nthem. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust knock once again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cHe might really be\r\npreoccupied, or asleep, or ill.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril knocked. \xe2\x80\x9cNow listen. Hush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were silent; the children still went on hallooing in the distance.\r\nThere was a great clop-clopping of horse\xe2\x80\x99s feet as a van was backed into\r\na stable door near by. Lypiatt stood motionless, his arms still crossed,\r\nhis chin on his breast. The seconds passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a sound,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must have gone out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, then. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go and look for Mercaptan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe heard their steps in the street below, heard the slamming of the taxi\r\ndoor. The engine was started up. Loud on the first gear, less loud on\r\nthe second, whisperingly on the third, it moved away, gathering speed.\r\nThe noise of it was merged with the general noise of the town. They were\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nLypiatt walked slowly back to his bed. He wished suddenly that he had\r\ngone down to answer the last knock. These voices\xe2\x80\x94at the well\xe2\x80\x99s edge he\r\nhad turned to listen to them; at the well\xe2\x80\x99s extreme verge. He lay quite\r\nstill in the darkness; and it seemed to him at last that he had floated\r\naway from the earth, that he was alone, no longer in a narrow dark room,\r\nbut in an illimitable darkness outside and beyond. His mind grew calmer;\r\nhe began to think of himself, of all that he had known, remotely, as\r\nthough from a great way off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdorable lights!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, as they drove once more through\r\nPiccadilly Circus.\r\n\r\nGumbril said nothing. He had said all that he had to say last time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s another,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Viveash, as they passed, near\r\nBurlington House, a fountain of Sandeman\xe2\x80\x99s port. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only they had an\r\nautomatic jazz band attached to the same mechanism!\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nregretfully.\r\n\r\nThe Green Park remained solitary and remote under the moon. \xe2\x80\x9cWasted on\r\nus,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, as they passed. \xe2\x80\x9cOne should be happily in love to\r\nenjoy a summer night under the trees.\xe2\x80\x9d He wondered where Emily could be\r\nnow. They sat in silence; the cab drove on.\r\n\r\nMr. Mercaptan, it seemed, had left London. His housekeeper had a long\r\nstory to tell. A regular Bolshevik had come yesterday, pushing in. And\r\nshe had heard him shouting at Mr. Mercaptan in his own room. And then,\r\nluckily, a lady had come and the Bolshevik had gone away again. And this\r\nmorning Mr. Mercaptan had decided, quite sudden like, to go away for two\r\nor three days. And it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise her at all if it had something\r\nto do with that horrible Bolshevik fellow. Though of course Master\r\nPaster hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said anything about it. Still, as she\xe2\x80\x99d known him when he\r\nwas so high and seen him grow up like, she thought she could say she\r\nknew him well enough to guess why he did things. It was only brutally\r\nthat they contrived to tear themselves away.\r\n\r\nSecure, meanwhile, behind a whole troop of butlers and footmen, Mr.\r\nMercaptan was dining comfortably at Oxhanger with the most faithful of\r\nhis friends and admirers, Mrs. Speegle. It was to Mrs. Speegle that he\r\nhad dedicated his coruscating little \xe2\x80\x98Loves of the Pachyderms\xe2\x80\x99; for Mrs.\r\nSpeegle it was who had suggested, casually one day at luncheon, that the\r\nhuman race ought to be classified in two main species\xe2\x80\x94the Pachyderms,\r\nand those whose skin, like her own, like Mr. Mercaptan\xe2\x80\x99s and a few\r\nothers\xe2\x80\x99, was fine and \xe2\x80\x98responsive,\xe2\x80\x99 as Mr. Mercaptan himself put it, \xe2\x80\x98to\r\nall caresses, including those of pure reason.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Mercaptan had taken\r\nthe casual hint and had developed it, richly. The barbarous Pachyderms\r\nhe divided up into a number of subspecies: steatocephali, acephali,\r\ntheolaters, industrious Jud\xc3\xa6orhynci\xe2\x80\x94busy, compact and hard as\r\ndung-beetles\xe2\x80\x94Peabodies, Russians and so on. It was all very witty and\r\ndelicately savage. Mr. Mercaptan had a standing invitation at Oxhanger.\r\nWith dangerous pachyderms like Lypiatt ranging loose about the town, he\r\nthought it best to avail himself of it. Mrs. Speegle, he knew, would be\r\ndelighted to see him. And indeed she was. He arrived just at lunch-time.\r\nMrs. Speegle and Maisie Furlonger were already at the fish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercaptan!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Speegle\xe2\x80\x99s soul seemed to be in the name. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe went on, cooing as she talked, like a ring-dove. There seemed to be\r\nsinging in every word she spoke. She pointed to a chair next to hers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN\xe2\x80\x99you\xe2\x80\x99re n\xe2\x80\x99just in time to tell us all about _n\xe2\x80\x99your_ Lesbian\r\nexperiences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mercaptan, giving vent to his fully orchestrated laugh\xe2\x80\x94squeal and\r\nroar together\xe2\x80\x94had sat down and, speaking in French partly, he nodded\r\ntowards the butler and the footman, \xe2\x80\x98_\xc3\xa0 cause des valets_,\xe2\x80\x99 and partly\r\nbecause the language lent itself more deliciously to this kind of\r\nconfidences, he had begun there and then, interrupted and spurred on by\r\nthe cooing of Mrs. Speegle and the happy shrieks of Maisie Furlonger, to\r\nrecount at length and with all the wit in the world his experience among\r\nthe Isles of Greece. How delicious it was, he said to himself, to be\r\nwith really civilized people! In this happy house it seemed scarcely\r\npossible to believe that such a thing as a pachyderm existed.\r\n\r\nBut Lypiatt still lay, face upwards, on his bed, floating, it seemed to\r\nhimself, far out into the dark emptinesses between the stars. From those\r\ndistant abstract spaces he seemed to be looking impersonally down upon\r\nhis own body stretched out by the brink of the hideous well; to be\r\nlooking back over his own history. Everything, even his own unhappiness,\r\nseemed very small and beautiful; every frightful convulsion had become\r\nno more than a ripple, and only the fine musical ghost of sound came up\r\nto him from all the shouting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have no luck,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, as they climbed once more into the cab.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we haven\xe2\x80\x99t really had a great\r\ndeal. Did you genuinely want very much to see Mercaptan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cBut do you genuinely want to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Viveash drew the corners of her mouth down into a painful smile and\r\ndid not answer. \xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t we going to pass through Piccadilly Circus\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see the lights again. They give one\r\ntemporarily the illusion of being cheerful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are going straight to Victoria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the driver to...?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps one\xe2\x80\x99s better without stimulants.\r\nI remember when I was very young, when I first began to go about at all,\r\nhow proud I was of having discovered champagne. It seemed to me\r\nwonderful to get rather tipsy. Something to be exceedingly proud of.\r\nAnd, at the same time, how much I really disliked wine! Loathed the\r\ntaste of it. Sometimes, when Calliope and I used to dine quietly\r\ntogether, _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_, with no awful men about, and no appearances to\r\nkeep up, we used to treat ourselves to the luxury of a large\r\nlemon-squash, or even raspberry syrup and soda. Ah, I wish I could\r\nrecapture the deliciousness of raspberry syrup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColeman was at home. After a brief delay he appeared himself at the\r\ndoor. He was wearing pyjamas, and his face was covered with red-brown\r\nsmears, the tips of his beard were clotted with the same dried pigment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been doing to yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerely washing in the blood of the Lamb,\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman answered, smiling,\r\nand his eyes sparkling blue fire, like an electric machine.\r\n\r\nThe door on the opposite side of the little vestibule was open. Looking\r\nover Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, Gumbril could see through the opening a\r\nbrightly lighted room and, in the middle of it, like a large rectangular\r\nisland, a wide divan. Reclining on the divan an odalisque by Ingres\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nslimmer, more serpentine, more like a lithe pink length of boa\xe2\x80\x94presented\r\nher back. That big, brown mole on the right shoulder was surely\r\nfamiliar. But when, startled by the loudness of the voices behind her,\r\nthe odalisque turned round\xe2\x80\x94to see in a horribly embarrassing instant\r\nthat the Cossack had left the door open and that people could look in,\r\nwere looking in, indeed\xe2\x80\x94the slanting eyes beneath their heavy white\r\nlids, the fine aquiline nose, the wide, full-lipped mouth, though they\r\npresented themselves for only the fraction of a second, were still more\r\nrecognizable and familiar. For only the fraction of a second did the\r\nodalisque reveal herself definitely as Rosie. Then a hand pulled\r\nfeverishly at the counterpane, the section of buff-coloured boa wriggled\r\nand rolled; and, in a moment, where an odalisque had been, lay only a\r\nlong packet under a white sheet, like a jockey with a fractured skull\r\nwhen they carry him from the course.\r\n\r\nWell, really.... Gumbril felt positively indignant; not jealous, but\r\nastonished and righteously indignant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve finished bathing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncome and have dinner with us.\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman was standing between her and the\r\nfarther door; Mrs. Viveash had seen nothing in the room beyond the\r\nvestibule.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m busy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I see.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril spoke as sarcastically as he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Coleman, and looked round. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you do!\xe2\x80\x9d He stepped\r\nback and closed the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Theodore\xe2\x80\x99s last dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even if it were his last supper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman, enchanted to have\r\nbeen given the opportunity to blaspheme a little. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he going to be\r\ncrucified? Or what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerely going abroad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has a broken heart,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the genuine platonic towsers?\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman uttered his artificial\r\ndemon\xe2\x80\x99s laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, grimly.\r\n\r\nRelieved by the shutting of the door from her immediate embarrassment,\r\nRosie threw back a corner of the counterpane and extruded her head, one\r\narm and the shoulder with the mole on it. She looked about her, opening\r\nher slanting eyes as wide as she could. She listened with parted lips to\r\nthe voices that came, muffled now, through the door. It seemed to her as\r\nthough she were waking up; as though now, for the first time, she were\r\nhearing that shattering laugh, were looking now for the first time on\r\nthese blank, white walls and the one lovely and horrifying picture.\r\nWhere was she? What did it all mean? Rosie put her hand to her forehead,\r\ntried to think. Her thinking was always a series of pictures; one after\r\nanother the pictures swam up before her eyes, melted again in an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nHer mother taking off her pince-nez to wipe them\xe2\x80\x94and at once her eyes\r\nwere tremulous and vague and helpless. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should always let the\r\ngentleman get over the stile first,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and put on her glasses\r\nagain. Behind the glasses her eyes immediately became clear, piercing,\r\nsteady and efficient. Rather formidable eyes. They had seen Rosie\r\ngetting over the stile in front of Willie Hoskyns, and there was too\r\nmuch leg.\r\n\r\nJames reading at his desk; his heavy, round head propped on his hand.\r\nShe came up behind him and threw her arms round his neck. Very gently,\r\nand without turning his eyes from the page, he undid her embrace and,\r\nwith a little push that was no more than a hint, an implication,\r\nsignified that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want her. She had gone to her pink room, and\r\ncried.\r\n\r\nAnother time James shook his head and smiled patiently under his\r\nmoustache. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll never learn,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. She had gone to her room and\r\ncried that time too.\r\n\r\nAnother time they were lying in bed together, in the pink bed; only you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see it was pink because there was no light. They were lying\r\nvery quietly. Warm and happy and remote she felt. Sometimes as it were\r\nthe physical memory of pleasure plucked at her nerves, making her start,\r\nmaking her suddenly shiver. James was breathing as though he were\r\nasleep. All at once he stirred. He patted her shoulder two or three\r\ntimes in a kindly and business-like way. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what that means,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you pat me like that.\xe2\x80\x9d And she patted him\xe2\x80\x94pat-pat-pat, very\r\nquickly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt means you\xe2\x80\x99re going to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I don\xe2\x80\x99t know you after all this time? I know that pat by\r\nheart.\xe2\x80\x9d And suddenly all her warm, quiet happiness evaporated; it was\r\nall gone. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only a machine for going to bed with,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall I am for you.\xe2\x80\x9d She felt she would like to cry. But James only\r\nlaughed and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d and pulled his arm clumsily from\r\nunderneath her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou go to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and kissed her on the\r\nforehead. Then he got out of bed, and she heard him bumping clumsily\r\nabout in the darkness. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn!\xe2\x80\x9d he said once. Then he found the door,\r\nopened, and was gone.\r\n\r\nShe thought of those long stories she used to make up when she went\r\nshopping. The fastidious lady; the poets; all the adventures.\r\n\r\nToto\xe2\x80\x99s hands were wonderful.\r\n\r\nShe saw, she heard Mr. Mercaptan reading his essay. Poor father, reading\r\naloud from the _Hibbert Journal_!\r\n\r\nAnd now the Cossack, covered with blood. He, too, might read aloud from\r\nthe _Hibbert Journal_\xe2\x80\x94only backwards, so to speak. She had a bruise on\r\nher arm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing inherently wrong and disgusting in\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d he had asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d He had laughed and kissed her\r\nand stripped off her clothes and caressed her. And she had cried, she\r\nhad struggled, she had tried to turn away; and in the end she had been\r\novercome by a pleasure more piercing and agonizing than anything she had\r\never felt before. And all the time Coleman had hung over her, with his\r\nblood-stained beard, smiling into her face, and whispering, \xe2\x80\x9cHorrible,\r\nhorrible, infamous and shameful.\xe2\x80\x9d She lay in a kind of stupor. Then,\r\nsuddenly there had been that ringing. The Cossack had left her. And now\r\nshe was awake again, and it was horrible, it was shameful. She\r\nshuddered; she jumped out of bed and began as quickly as she could to\r\nput on her clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, really, won\xe2\x80\x99t you come?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash was insisting. She was\r\nnot used to people saying no when she asked, when she insisted. She\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may be having the last supper. But I\r\nhave a date here with the Magdalen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say so before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as I\xe2\x80\x99d left the door open,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was\r\nunnecessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cI find this very repulsive. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe plucked Gumbril by the sleeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coleman, politely. He shut the door after them and\r\nturned back across the little hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Not thinking of going?\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, as he came in. Rosie was\r\nsitting down on the edge of the bed pulling on her shoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou disgust me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s splendid,\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman declared. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all as it should be,\r\nall as I intended.\xe2\x80\x9d He sat down beside her on the divan. \xe2\x80\x9cReally,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, admiringly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat exquisite legs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosie would have given anything in the world to be back again in Bloxam\r\nGardens. Even if James did live in his books all the time.... Anything\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, \xe2\x80\x9cwe simply must go through Piccadilly\r\nCircus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll only be about two miles farther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that isn\xe2\x80\x99t much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril leaned out and gave the word to the driver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd besides, I like driving about like this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nlike driving for driving\xe2\x80\x99s sake. It\xe2\x80\x99s like the Last Ride Together. Dear\r\nTheodore!\xe2\x80\x9d She laid her hand on his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril, and kissed it.\r\n\r\nThe little cab buzzed along down the empty Mall. They were silent.\r\nThrough the thick air one could see the brightest of the stars. It was\r\none of those evenings when men feel that truth, goodness and beauty are\r\none. In the morning, when they commit their discovery to paper, when\r\nothers read it written there, it looks wholly ridiculous. It was one of\r\nthose evenings when love is once more invented for the first time. That,\r\ntoo, seems a little ridiculous, sometimes, in the morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are the lights again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cHop, twitch, flick\xe2\x80\x94yes,\r\ngenuinely an illusion of jollity, Theodore. Genuinely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril stopped the cab. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s after half-past eight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt this\r\nrate we shall never get anything to eat. Wait a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ran into Appenrodt\xe2\x80\x99s, and came back in a moment with a packet of\r\nsmoked salmon sandwiches, a bottle of white wine and a glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a long way to go,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, as he got into the taxi.\r\n\r\nThey ate their sandwiches, they drank their wine. The taxi drove on and\r\non.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is positively exhilarating,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, as they turned\r\ninto the Edgware Road.\r\n\r\nPolished by the wheels and shining like an old and precious bronze, the\r\nroad stretched before them, reflecting the lamps. It had the inviting\r\nair of a road which goes on for ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey used to have such good peep-shows in this street,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril\r\ntenderly remembered: \xe2\x80\x9cLittle back shops where you paid twopence to see\r\nthe genuine mermaid, which turned out to be a stuffed walrus, and the\r\ntattooed lady, and the dwarf, and the living statuary, which one always\r\nhoped, as a boy, was really going to be rather naked and thrilling, but\r\nwhich was always the most pathetic of unemployed barmaids, dressed in\r\nthe thickest of pink Jaeger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think there\xe2\x80\x99d be any of those now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\nGumbril shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve moved on with the march of\r\ncivilization. But where?\xe2\x80\x9d He spread out his hands interrogatively. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know which direction civilization marches\xe2\x80\x94whether north towards\r\nKilburn and Golders Green, or over the river to the Elephant, to Clapham\r\nand Sydenham and all those other mysterious places. But, in any case,\r\nhigh rents have marched up here; there are no more genuine mermaids in\r\nthe Edgware Road. What stories we shall be able to tell our children!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think we shall ever have any?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can never tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought one could,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. Children\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwould be the most desperate experiment of all. The most desperate, and\r\nperhaps the only one having any chance of being successful. History\r\nrecorded cases.... On the other hand, it recorded other cases that\r\nproved the opposite. She had often thought of this experiment. There\r\nwere so many obvious reasons for not making it. But some day,\r\nperhaps\xe2\x80\x94she always put it off, like that.\r\n\r\nThe cab had turned off the main road into quieter and darker streets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPenetrating into Maida Vale. We shall soon be there. Poor old\r\nShearwater!\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed. Other people in love were always absurd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we find him in, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d It would be fun to see Shearwater\r\nagain. She liked to hear him talking, learnedly, and like a child. But\r\nwhen the child is six feet high and three feet wide and two feet thick,\r\nwhen it tries to plunge head first into your life\xe2\x80\x94then, really, no....\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what did you want with me?\xe2\x80\x9d he had asked. \xe2\x80\x9cJust to look at you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe answered. Just to look; that was all. Music hall, not boudoir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril got out and rang the second floor bell.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened by an impertinent-looking little maid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Shearwater\xe2\x80\x99s at the lavatory,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in answer to Gumbril\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaboratory?\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the \xe2\x80\x99ospital.\xe2\x80\x9d That made it clear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is Mrs. Shearwater at home?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked maliciously.\r\n\r\nThe little maid shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI expected \xe2\x80\x99er, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nback to dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you mind giving her a message when she does come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGumbril. \xe2\x80\x9cTell her that Mr. Toto was very sorry he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t time to speak\r\nto her when he saw her this evening in Pimlico.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. who?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Toto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Toto is sorry \xe2\x80\x99e \xe2\x80\x99adn\xe2\x80\x99t the time to speak to Mrs. Shearwater when\r\n\xe2\x80\x99e saw \xe2\x80\x99er in Pimlico this evening. Very well, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t forget?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t forget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went back to the cab and explained that they had drawn blank once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m rather glad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we ever did find anybody, it\r\nwould mean the end of this Last-Ride-Together feeling. And that would be\r\nsad. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a lovely night. And really, for the moment, I feel I can\r\ndo without my lights. Suppose we just drove for a bit now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Gumbril would not allow that. \xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t had enough to eat yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, and he gave the cabman Gumbril Senior\xe2\x80\x99s address.\r\n\r\nGumbril Senior was sitting on his little iron balcony among the\r\ndried-out pots that had once held geraniums, smoking his pipe and\r\nlooking earnestly out into the darkness in front of him. Clustered in\r\nthe fourteen plane trees of the square, the starlings were already\r\nasleep. There was no sound but the rustling of the leaves. But\r\nsometimes, every hour or so, the birds would wake up. Something\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\r\nit might be a stronger gust of wind, perhaps some happy dream of worms,\r\nsome nightmare of cats simultaneously dreamed by all the flock\r\ntogether\xe2\x80\x94would suddenly rouse them. And then they would all start to\r\ntalk at once, at the tops of their shrill voices\xe2\x80\x94for perhaps half a\r\nminute. Then in an instant they all went to sleep again and there was\r\nonce more no sound but the rustling of the shaken leaves. At these\r\nmoments Mr. Gumbril would lean forward, would strain his eyes and his\r\nears in the hope of seeing, of hearing something\xe2\x80\x94something significant,\r\nexplanatory, satisfying. He never did, of course; but that in no way\r\ndiminished his happiness.\r\n\r\nMr. Gumbril received them on his balcony with courtesy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just thinking of going in to work,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you come\r\nand give me a good excuse for sitting out here a little longer. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ndelighted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril Junior went downstairs to see what he could find in the way of\r\nfood. While he was gone, his father explained to Mrs. Viveash the\r\nsecrets of the birds. Enthusiastically, his light floss of grey hair\r\nfloating up and falling again about his head as he pointed and\r\ngesticulated, he told her; the great flocks assembled\xe2\x80\x94goodness only knew\r\nwhere!\xe2\x80\x94they flew across the golden sky, detaching here a little troop,\r\nthere a whole legion, they flew until at last all had found their\r\nappointed resting-places and there were no more to fly. He made this\r\nnightly flight sound epical, as though it were a migration of peoples, a\r\npassage of armies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s my firm belief,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril Senior, adding notes to his\r\nepic, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they make use of some sort of telepathy, some kind of direct\r\nmind-to-mind communication between themselves. You can\xe2\x80\x99t watch them\r\nwithout coming to that conclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA charming conclusion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a faculty,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Senior went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwe all possess, I believe.\r\nAll we animals.\xe2\x80\x9d He made a gesture which included himself, Mrs. Viveash\r\nand the invisible birds among the plane trees. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t we use it\r\nmore? You may well ask. For the simple reason, my dear young lady, that\r\nhalf our existence is spent in dealing with things that have no\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x94things with which it is impossible to hold telepathic\r\ncommunication. Hence the development of the five senses. I have eyes\r\nthat preserve me from running into the lamp-post, ears that warn me I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nin the neighbourhood of Niagara. And having made these instruments very\r\nefficient, I use them even in holding converse with other beings having\r\na mind. I let my telepathic faculty lie idle, preferring to employ an\r\nelaborate and cumbrous arrangement of symbols in order to make my\r\nthought known to you through your senses. In certain individuals,\r\nhowever, the faculty is naturally so well-developed\xe2\x80\x94like the musical, or\r\nthe mathematical, or the chess-playing faculties in other people\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nthey cannot help entering into direct communication with other minds,\r\nwhether they want to or not. If we knew a good method of educating and\r\ndrawing out the latent faculty, most of us could make ourselves\r\nmoderately efficient telepaths; just as most of us can make ourselves\r\ninto moderate musicians, chess players and mathematicians. There would\r\nalso be a few, no doubt, who could never communicate directly. Just as\r\nthere are a few who cannot recognize \xe2\x80\x98Rule Britannia\xe2\x80\x99 or Bach\xe2\x80\x99s Concerto\r\nin D minor for two violins, and a few who cannot comprehend the nature\r\nof an algebraical symbol. Look at the general development of the\r\nmathematical and musical faculties only within the last two hundred\r\nyears. By the twenty-first century, I believe, we shall all be\r\ntelepaths. Meanwhile, these delightful birds have forestalled us. Not\r\nhaving the wit to invent a language or an expressive pantomime, they\r\ncontrive to communicate such simple thoughts as they have, directly and\r\ninstantaneously. They all go to sleep at once, wake at once, say the\r\nsame thing at once; they turn all at once when they\xe2\x80\x99re flying. Without a\r\nleader, without a word of command, they do everything together, in\r\ncomplete unison. Sitting here in the evenings, I sometimes fancy I can\r\nfeel their thoughts striking against my own. It has happened to me once\r\nor twice: that I have known a second before it actually happened, that\r\nthe birds were going to wake up and begin their half-minute of chatter\r\nin the dark. Wait! Hush.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Senior threw back his head, pressed\r\nhis hand over his mouth, as though by commanding silence on himself he\r\ncould command it on the whole world. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe they\xe2\x80\x99re going to wake\r\nnow. I feel it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent. Mrs. Viveash looked towards the dark trees and listened.\r\nA full minute passed. Then the old gentleman burst out happily laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompletely wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve never been more soundly asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMrs. Viveash laughed too. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps they all changed their minds, just as\r\nthey were waking up,\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested.\r\n\r\nGumbril Junior reappeared; glasses clinked as he walked, and there was a\r\nlittle rattle of crockery. He was carrying a tray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCold beef,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand salad and a bit of a cold apple-pie. It might\r\nbe worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey drew up chairs to Gumbril Senior\xe2\x80\x99s work-table, and there, among the\r\nletters and the unpaid bills and the sketchy elevations of archiducal\r\npalaces, they ate the beef and the apple-pie, and drank the\r\none-and-ninepenny _vin ordinaire_ of the house. Gumbril Senior, who had\r\nalready supped, looked on at them from the balcony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril Junior, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we saw Mr. Porteous\xe2\x80\x99s son\r\nthe other evening\xe2\x80\x94very drunk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril Senior threw up his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you knew the calamities that\r\nyoung imbecile has been the cause of!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGambled away I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much borrowed money. And poor Porteous\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t afford anything\xe2\x80\x94even now.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gumbril shook his head and clutched\r\nand combed his beard. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a fearful blow, but of course, Porteous is\r\nvery steadfast and serene and.... There!\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Senior interrupted\r\nhimself, holding up his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cListen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the fourteen plane trees the starlings had suddenly woken up.\r\n\r\nThere was a wild outburst, like a stormy sitting in the Italian\r\nParliament. Then all was silent. Gumbril Senior listened, enchanted. His\r\nface, as he turned back towards the light, revealed itself all smiles.\r\nHis hair seemed to have blown loose of its own accord, from within, so\r\nto speak; he pushed it into place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou heard them?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can they have to say to\r\none another, I wonder, at this time of night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you feel they were going to wake up?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril Senior with candour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we\xe2\x80\x99ve finished,\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Junior spoke with his mouth full, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nmust show Myra your model of London. She\xe2\x80\x99d adore it\xe2\x80\x94except that it has\r\nno electric sky-signs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis father looked all of a sudden very much embarrassed. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nit would interest Mrs. Viveash much,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes it would. Really,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as a matter of fact it isn\xe2\x80\x99t here.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Senior pulled with\r\nfury at his beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot here? But what\xe2\x80\x99s happened to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGumbril Senior wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain. He just ignored his son\xe2\x80\x99s question and\r\nbegan to talk once more about the starlings. Later on, however, when\r\nGumbril and Mrs. Viveash were preparing to go, the old man drew him\r\napart into a corner and began to whisper the explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to blare it about in front of strangers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as\r\nthough it were a question of the housemaid\xe2\x80\x99s illegitimate baby or a\r\nrepair to the water-closet. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the fact is, I\xe2\x80\x99ve sold it. The Victoria\r\nand Albert had wind that I was making it; they\xe2\x80\x99ve been wanting it all\r\nthe time. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve let them have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbril Junior asked in a tone of astonishment. He knew with\r\nwhat a paternal affection\xe2\x80\x94no, more than paternal; for he was sure that\r\nhis father was more whole-heartedly attached to his models than his\r\nson\xe2\x80\x94with what pride he regarded these children of his spirit.\r\n\r\nGumbril Senior sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all that young imbecile,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat young imbecile?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPorteous\xe2\x80\x99s son, of course. You see, poor Porteous has had to sell his\r\nlibrary, among other things. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that means to him. All\r\nthese precious books. And collected at the price of such hardships. I\r\nthought I\xe2\x80\x99d like to buy a few of the best ones back for him. They gave\r\nme quite a good price at the Museum.\xe2\x80\x9d He came out of his corner and\r\nhurried across the room to help Mrs. Viveash with her cloak. \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me,\r\nallow me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nSlowly and pensively Gumbril Junior followed him. Beyond good and evil?\r\nBelow good and evil? The name of earwig.... The tubby pony trotted. The\r\nwild columbines suspended, among the shadows of the hazel copse, hooked\r\nspurs, helmets of aerial purple. The twelfth sonata of Mozart was\r\ninsecticide; no earwigs could crawl through that music. Emily\xe2\x80\x99s breasts\r\nwere firm and pointed and she had slept at last without a tremor. In the\r\nstarlight, good, true and beautiful became one. Write the discovery in\r\nbooks\xe2\x80\x94in books _quos_, in the morning, _legimus cacantes_. They\r\ndescended the stairs. The cab was waiting outside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Ride again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGolgotha Hospital, Southwark,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril to the driver and followed\r\nher into the cab.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrive, drive, drive,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Viveash. \xe2\x80\x9cI like your father,\r\nTheodore. One of these days he\xe2\x80\x99ll fly away with the birds. And how nice\r\nit is of those starlings to wake themselves up like that in the middle\r\nof the night, merely to amuse him. Considering how unpleasant it is to\r\nbe woken in the night. Where are we going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to look at Shearwater in his laboratory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that a long way away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmensely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God for that,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash piously and expiringly breathed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nShearwater sat on his stationary bicycle, pedalling unceasingly like a\r\nman in a nightmare. The pedals were geared to a little wheel under the\r\nsaddle and the rim of the wheel rubbed, as it revolved against a brake,\r\ncarefully adjusted to make the work of the pedaller hard, but not\r\nimpossibly hard. From a pipe which came up through the floor issued a\r\nlittle jet of water which played on the brake and kept it cool. But no\r\njet of water played on Shearwater. It was his business to get hot. He\r\ndid get hot.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time his dog-faced young friend, Lancing, came and looked\r\nthrough the window of the experimenting chamber to see how he was\r\ngetting on. Inside that little wooden house, which might have reminded\r\nLancing, if he had had a literary turn of mind, of the Box in which\r\nGulliver left Brobdingnag, the scenes of intimate life were the same\r\nevery time he looked in. Shearwater was always at his post on the saddle\r\nof the nightmare bicycle, pedalling, pedalling. The water trickled over\r\nthe brake. And Shearwater sweated. Great drops of sweat came oozing out\r\nfrom under his hair, ran down over his forehead, hung beaded on his\r\neyebrows, ran into his eyes, down his nose, along his cheeks, fell like\r\nraindrops. His thick bull-neck was wet; his whole naked body, his arms\r\nand legs streamed and shone. The sweat poured off him and was caught as\r\nit rained down in a waterproof sheet, to trickle down its sloping folds\r\ninto a large glass receptacle which stood under a hole in the centre of\r\nthe sheet at the focal point where all its slopes converged. The\r\nautomatically controlled heating apparatus in the basement kept the\r\ntemperature in the box high and steady. Peering through the damp-dimmed\r\npanes of the window. Lancing noticed with satisfaction that the mercury\r\nstood unchangingly at twenty-seven point five Centigrade. The\r\nventilators at the side and top of the box were open; Shearwater had air\r\nenough. Another time, Lancing reflected, they\xe2\x80\x99d make the box air-tight\r\nand see the effect of a little carbon dioxide poisoning on top of\r\nexcessive sweating. It might be very interesting, but to-day they were\r\nconcerned with sweating only. After seeing that the thermometer was\r\nsteady, that the ventilators were properly open, the water was still\r\ntrickling over the brake, Lancing would tap at the window. And\r\nShearwater, who kept his eyes fixed straight before him, as he pedalled\r\nslowly and unremittingly along his nightmare road, would turn his head\r\nat the sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right?\xe2\x80\x9d Lancing\xe2\x80\x99s lips moved and his eyebrows went up inquiringly.\r\n\r\nShearwater would nod his big, round head, and the sweatdrops, suspended\r\non his eyebrows and his moustache, would fall like little liquid fruits\r\nshaken suddenly by the wind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d and Lancing would go back to his thick German book under the\r\nreading-lamp at the other end of the laboratory.\r\n\r\nConstant as the thermometer Shearwater pedalled steadily and slowly on.\r\nWith a few brief halts for food and rest, he had been pedalling ever\r\nsince lunch-time. At eleven he would go to bed on a shake-down in the\r\nlaboratory and at nine to-morrow morning he would re-enter the box and\r\nstart pedalling again. He would go on all to-morrow and the day after;\r\nand after that, as long as he could stand it. One, two, three, four.\r\nPedal, pedal, pedal.... He must have travelled the equivalent of sixty\r\nor seventy miles this afternoon. He would be getting on for Swindon. He\r\nwould be nearly at Portsmouth. He would be past Cambridge, past Oxford.\r\nHe would be nearly at Harwich, pedalling through the green and golden\r\nvalleys where Constable used to paint. He would be at Winchester by the\r\nbright stream. He would have ridden through the beech woods of Arundel\r\nout into the sea....\r\n\r\nIn any case he was far away, he was escaping. And Mrs. Viveash followed,\r\nwalking swayingly along on feet that seemed to tread between two\r\nabysses, at her leisure. Pedal, pedal. The hydrogen ion concentration in\r\nthe blood.... Formidably, calmly, her eyes regarded. The lids cut off an\r\narc of those pale circles. When she smiled, it was a crucifixion. The\r\ncoils of her hair were copper serpents. Her small gestures loosened\r\nenormous fragments of the universe and at the faint dying sound of her\r\nvoice they had fallen in ruins about him. His world was no longer safe,\r\nit had ceased to stand on its foundations. Mrs. Viveash walked among his\r\nruins and did not even notice them. He must build up again. Pedal,\r\npedal. He was not merely escaping; he was working a building machine. It\r\nmust be built with proportion; with proportion, the old man had said.\r\nThe old man appeared in the middle of the nightmare road in front of\r\nhim, clutching his beard. Proportion, proportion. There were first a lot\r\nof dirty rocks lying about; then there was St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s. These bits of his\r\nlife had to be built up proportionably.\r\n\r\nThere was work. And there was talk about work and ideas. And there were\r\nmen who could talk about work and ideas. But so far as he had been\r\nconcerned that was about all they could do. He would have to find out\r\nwhat else they did; it was interesting. And he would have to find out\r\nwhat other men did; men who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about work and not much about\r\nideas. They had as good kidneys as any one else.\r\n\r\nAnd then there were women.\r\n\r\nOn the nightmare road he remained stationary. The pedals went round and\r\nround under his driving feet; the sweat ran off him. He was escaping,\r\nand yet he was also drawing nearer. He would have to draw nearer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman, what have I to do with you?\xe2\x80\x9d Not enough; too much.\r\n\r\nNot enough\xe2\x80\x94he was building her in, a great pillar next to the pillar of\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nToo much\xe2\x80\x94he was escaping. If he had not caged himself here in this hot\r\nbox, he would have run out after her, to throw himself\xe2\x80\x94all in fragments,\r\nall dissipated and useless\xe2\x80\x94in front of her. And she wanted none of him.\r\nBut perhaps it would be worse, perhaps it would be far, far worse if she\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nThe old man stood in the road before him, clutching his beard, crying\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x9cProportion, proportion.\xe2\x80\x9d He trod and trod at his building machine,\r\nworking up the pieces of his life, steadily, unremittingly working them\r\ninto a proportionable whole, into a dome that should hang, light,\r\nspacious and high, as though by a miracle, on the empty air. He trod and\r\ntrod, escaping, mile after mile into fatigue, into wisdom. He was at\r\nDover now, pedalling across the Channel. He was crossing a dividing gulf\r\nand there would be safety on the other side; the cliffs of Dover were\r\nalready behind him. He turned his head as though to look back at them;\r\nthe drops of sweat were shaken from his eyebrows, from the shaggy\r\nfringes of his moustache. He turned his head from the blank wooden wall\r\nin front of him over his left shoulder. A face was looking through the\r\nobservation window behind him\xe2\x80\x94a woman\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\nIt was the face of Mrs. Viveash.\r\n\r\nShearwater uttered a cry and at once turned back again. He redoubled his\r\npedalling. One, two, three, four\xe2\x80\x94furiously he rushed along the nightmare\r\nroad. She was haunting him now in hallucinations. She was pursuing and\r\nshe was gaining on him. Will, wisdom, resolution and understanding were\r\nof no avail, then? But there was always fatigue. The sweat poured down\r\nhis face, streamed down the indented runnel of his spine, along the seam\r\nat the meeting-place of the ribs. His loin-cloth was wringing wet. The\r\ndrops pattered continuously on the waterproof sheet. His calves and the\r\nmuscles of his thighs ached with pedalling. One, two, three, four\xe2\x80\x94he\r\ntrod round a hundred times with either foot. After that he ventured to\r\nturn his head once more. He was relieved, and at the same time he was\r\ndisappointed, to see that there was now no face at the window. He had\r\nexorcised the hallucination. He settled down to a more leisurely\r\npedalling.\r\n\r\nIn the annexe of the laboratory the animals devoted to the service of\r\nphysiology were woken by the sudden opening of the door, the sudden\r\nirruption of light. The albino guinea-pigs peered through the meshes of\r\ntheir hutch and their red eyes were like the rear-lights of bicycles.\r\nThe pregnant she-rabbits lolloped out and shook their ears and pointed\r\ntheir tremulous noses towards the door. The cock into which Shearwater\r\nhad engrafted an ovary came out, not knowing whether to crow or cluck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he\xe2\x80\x99s with hens,\xe2\x80\x9d Lancing explained to his visitors, \xe2\x80\x9che thinks\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s a cock. When he\xe2\x80\x99s with a cock, he\xe2\x80\x99s convinced he\xe2\x80\x99s a pullet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rats who were being fed on milk from a London dairy came tumbling\r\nfrom their nest with an anxious hungry squeaking. They were getting\r\nthinner and thinner every day; in a few days they would be dead. But the\r\nold rat, whose diet was Grade A milk from the country, hardly took the\r\ntrouble to move. He was as fat and sleek as a brown furry fruit, ripe to\r\nbursting. No skim and chalky water, no dried dung and tubercle bacilli\r\nfor him. He was in clover. Next week, however, the fates were plotting\r\nto give him diabetes artificially.\r\n\r\nIn their glass pagoda the little black axolotls crawled, the heraldry of\r\nMexico, among a scanty herbage. The beetles, who had had their heads cut\r\noff and replaced by the heads of other beetles, darted uncertainly\r\nabout, some obeying their heads, some their genital organs. A\r\nfifteen-year-old monkey, rejuvenated by the Steinach process, was\r\ndiscovered by the light of Lancing\xe2\x80\x99s electric torch, shaking the bars\r\nthat separated him from the green-furred, bald-rumped, bearded young\r\nbeauty in the next cage. He was gnashing his teeth with thwarted\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nLancing expounded to the visitors all the secrets. The vast,\r\nunbelievable, fantastic world opened out as he spoke. There were\r\ntropics, there were cold seas busy with living beings, there were\r\nforests full of horrible trees, silence and darkness. There were\r\nferments and infinitesimal poisons floating in the air. There were\r\nleviathans suckling their young, there were flies and worms, there were\r\nmen, living in cities, thinking, knowing good and evil. And all were\r\nchanging continuously, moment by moment, and each remained all the time\r\nitself by virtue of some unimaginable enchantment. They were all alive.\r\nAnd on the other side of the courtyard beyond the shed in which the\r\nanimals slept or uneasily stirred, in the huge hospital that went up\r\nsheer like a windowed cliff into the air, men and women were ceasing to\r\nbe themselves, or were struggling to remain themselves. They were dying,\r\nthey were struggling to live. The other windows looked on to the river.\r\nThe lights of London Bridge were on the right, of Blackfriars to the\r\nleft. On the opposite shore, St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s floated up as though\r\nself-supported in the moonlight. Like time the river flowed, silent and\r\nblack. Gumbril and Mrs. Viveash leaned their elbows on the sill and\r\nlooked out. Like time the river flowed, stanchlessly, as though from a\r\nwound in the world\xe2\x80\x99s side. For a long time they were silent. They looked\r\nout, without speaking, across the flow of time, at the stars, at the\r\nhuman symbol hanging miraculously in the moonlight. Lancing had gone\r\nback to his German book; he had no time to waste looking out of windows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gumbril at last, meditatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Viveash interrupted him, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be as awful as to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe breathed it like a truth from beyond the grave prematurely revealed,\r\nexpiringly from her death-bed within.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Gumbril.\r\n\r\nIn his hot box Shearwater sweated and pedalled. He was across the\r\nChannel now; he felt himself safe. Still he trod on; he would be at\r\nAmiens by midnight if he went on at this rate. He was escaping, he had\r\nescaped. He was building up his strong light dome of life. Proportion,\r\ncried the old man, proportion! And it hung there, proportioned and\r\nbeautiful in the dark, confused horror of his desires, solid and strong\r\nand durable among his broken thoughts. Time flowed darkly past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Viveash, straightening herself up, and giving\r\nherself a little shake, \xe2\x80\x9cnow we\xe2\x80\x99ll drive to Hampstead and have a look at\r\nPiers Cotton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n              PRINTED BY MORRISON AND GIBB LTD., EDINBURGH\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER\xe2\x80\x99S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
