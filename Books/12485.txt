Eh, Charlie?"\r\n\r\n"The sight of the mother-in-law."\r\n\r\n"Safe up on the shelf?  Ha, you flattering boys!"\r\n\r\n"Well, each of the three bridegrooms has severally told us that his\r\nbride was a strong likeness of the mother, so she will have the\r\nadvantage of three mirrors!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, and each married solely for her benefit.  I wonder which is the\r\ntruest!"\r\n\r\n"Come, Baby Charles, don\'t _you_ take to being cynical and\r\nsatirical," said the mother.  "It would be more to the purpose to\r\nconsider of the bringing them home.  Let me see, Raymond and his\r\nCecil will be at Holford\'s Gate at 5.30.  They must have the\r\ncarriage in full state.  I suppose Brewer knows."\r\n\r\n"Trust the ringers for scenting it out."\r\n\r\n"Julius and Rosamond by the down train at Willansborough, at 4.50.\r\nOne of you must drive old Snapdragon in the van for them.  They will\r\nnot mind when they understand; but there\'s that poor wife of\r\nMiles\'s, I wish she could have come a few days earlier.  Her friend,\r\nMrs. Johnson, is to drop her by the express at Backsworth, at 3.30."\r\n\r\n"Inconvenient woman!"\r\n\r\n"I imagine that she cannot help it; Mrs. Johnson is going far north,\r\nand was very good in staying with her at Southampton till she could\r\nmove.  Poor little thing! alone in a strange country!  I\'ll tell you\r\nwhat!  One of you must run down by train, meet her, and either bring\r\nher home in a fly, or wait to be picked up by Raymond\'s train.  Take\r\nher Miles\'s letter."\r\n\r\nThe two young men glanced at one another in dismay, and the elder\r\nsaid, "Wouldn\'t nurse do better?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, Frank," said the younger, catching a distressed look on\r\ntheir mother\'s face, "I\'ll look up Miles\'s little African.  I\'ve\r\nrather a curiosity that way.  Only don\'t let them start the bells\r\nunder the impression that we are a pair of the victims.  If so, I\r\nshall bolt."\r\n\r\n"Julius must be the nearest bolting," said Frank.  "How he\r\naccomplished it passes my comprehension.  I shall not believe in it\r\ntill I see him.  There, then, I\'ll give orders.  Barouche for the\r\nsquire, van for the rector, and the rattling fly for the sailor\'s\r\nwife.  So wags the course of human life," chanted Frank Charnock, as\r\nhe strolled out of the room.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, Charlie," whispered his mother.  "I am grieved for that\r\npoor young thing.  I wish I could go myself.  And, Charlie, would\r\nyou cast an eye round, and see how things look in their rooms?  You\r\nhave always been my daughter."\r\n\r\n"Ah! my vocation is gone!  Three in one day!  I wonder which is the\r\nbest of the lot.  I bet upon Miles\'s Cape Gooseberry.--Tired, mother\r\ndarling?  Shall I send in nurse?  I must be off, if I am to catch\r\nthe 12.30 train."\r\n\r\nHe bent to kiss the face, which was too delicately shaped and tinted\r\nto look old enough to be in expectation of three daughters-in-law.\r\nNo, prostrate as she was upon pillows, Mrs. Charnock Poynsett did\r\nnot look as if she had attained fifty years.  She was lady of\r\nCompton Poynsett in her own right; and had been so early married and\r\nwidowed, as to have been the most efficient parental influence her\r\nfive sons had ever known; and their beautiful young mother had been\r\nthe object of their adoration from the nursery upwards, so that she\r\nlaughed at people who talked of the trouble and anxiety of rearing\r\nsons.\r\n\r\nThey had all taken their cue from their senior, who had always been\r\nmore to his mother than all the world besides.  For several years,\r\nhe being as old of his age as she was young, Mr. and Mrs. Charnock\r\nPoynsett, with scarcely eighteen years between their ages, had often\r\nbeen taken by strangers for husband and wife rather than son and\r\nmother.  And though she knew she ought to wish for his marriage, she\r\ncould not but be secretly relieved that there were no symptoms of\r\nany such went impending.\r\n\r\nAt last, during the first spring after Raymond Charnock Poynsett,\r\nEsquire, had been elected member for the little borough of\r\nWillansborough, his mother, while riding with her two youngest boys,\r\nmet with an accident so severe, that in two years she had never\r\nquitted the morning-room, whither she had at first been carried.\r\nShe was daily lifted to a couch, but she could endure no further\r\nmotion, though her general health had become good, and her\r\ncheerfulness made her room pleasant to her sons when the rest of the\r\nhouse was very dreary to them.\r\n\r\nRaymond, always the home son, would never have absented himself but\r\nfor his parliamentary duties, and vibrated between London and home,\r\nuntil, when his mother had settled into a condition that seemed\r\nlikely to be permanent, and his two youngest brothers were at home,\r\nreading each for his examination, the one for a Government\r\nclerkship, the other for the army, he yielded to the general\r\nrecommendation, and set out for a journey on the Continent.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later came the electrifying news of his engagement to\r\nhis second cousin, Cecil Charnock.  It was precisely the most\r\nobvious and suitable of connections.  She was the only child of the\r\nhead of the family of which his father had been a cadet, and there\r\nwere complications of inheritance thus happily disposed of.  Mrs.\r\nPoynsett had not seen her since her earliest childhood; but she was\r\nknown to have been educated with elaborate care, and had been taken\r\nto the Continent as the completion of her education, and there\r\nRaymond had met her, and sped so rapidly with his wooing, that he\r\nhad been married at Venice just four weeks previously.\r\n\r\nSomewhat less recent was the wedding of the second son Commander\r\nMiles Charnock.  (The younger sons bore their patronymic alone.)\r\nHis ship had been stationed at the Cape and there, on a hunting\r\nexpedition up the country, he had been detained by a severe illness\r\nat a settler\'s house; and this had resulted in his marrying the\r\neldest daughter, Anne Fraser.  She had spent some months at Simon\'s\r\nBay while his ship was there, and when he found himself under orders\r\nfor the eastern coast of Africa, she would fain have awaited him at\r\nGlen Fraser; but he preferred sending her home to fulfil the mission\r\nof daughterhood to his own mother.\r\n\r\nThe passage had been long and unfavourable, and the consequences to\r\nher had been so serious that when she landed she could not travel\r\nuntil after a few days\' rest.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of the third son had been a much greater surprise.\r\nCompton Poynsett was not a family living; but the patron, hearing of\r\nJulius Charnock as a hard-working curate in a distant seaport, wrote\r\nto offer it to him; and the same letter to Mrs. Poynsett to offer it\r\nto him; and the same letter to Mrs Poynsett which conveyed this\r\ngratifying intelligence, also informed her of his having proposed to\r\nthe daughter of the commanding officer of the regiment stationed at\r\nthe town where lay his present charge.  Her father enjoyed the\r\nbarren honours of the Earldom of Rathforlane, an unimprovable estate\r\nin a remote corner of Ireland, burthened with successive families of\r\nnumerous daughters, so that he was forced to continue in the\r\nservice, and the marriage had been hastened by the embarkation of\r\nthe regiment for India only two days later.  The Rectory had,\r\nhowever, been found in such a state of dilapidation, that demolition\r\nwas the only cure; and thus the Reverend Julius and Lady Rosamond\r\nCharnock were to begin their married life in the family home.\r\n\r\nThe two youngest sons, Francis and Charles, stood on the other side\r\nof a gap made by the loss of two infants, and were only twenty-one\r\nand nineteen.  Frank had passed through Oxford with credit, and had\r\nbeen promised a Government office; while Charles was intended for\r\nthe army; and both had been reading with a tutor who lived at\r\nWillansborough, and was continually employed in cramming, being\r\nreported of as the best \'coach\' in the country.  Charlie, however,\r\nhad passed a week previously, and was to repair to Sandhurst in\r\nanother fortnight.\r\n\r\nAt half-past four there was a light tap at Mrs. Poynsett\'s door, and\r\nCharlie announced, "Here\'s the first, mother!" as he brought in a\r\ngray-cloaked figure; and Mrs. Poynsett took a trembling hand, and\r\nbestowed a kiss on a cheek which had languor and exhaustion in the\r\nvery touch.\r\n\r\n"She was tired to death, mother," said Charlie, "so we did not wait\r\nfor the train."\r\n\r\n"Quite right!" and as the newcomer sank into the chair he offered--\r\n"My dear, you are sadly knocked up!  You were hardly fit to come."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, I am quite well," answered the fagged timid voice.\r\n\r\n"Hark!" as the crash of a peal of bells came up.  "Dear child, you\r\nwill like to rest before any fresh introductions.  You shall go to\r\nyour room and have some tea there."\r\n\r\n"Thank you."\r\n\r\n"Charlie, call Susan.--She is my boys\' old nurse, now mine.  Only\r\ntell me you have good accounts from my boy Miles."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;" and the hand tightly clasped the closely-written letter\r\nfor which the mother\'s eyes felt hungry.  "He sent you his love, and\r\nhe will write to you next time.  He was so busy, his first\r\nlieutenant was down in fever."\r\n\r\n"Where was he?"\r\n\r\n"Off Zanzibar--otherwise the crew was healthy--the 12th of August,"\r\nshe answered, squeezing out the sentences as if constrained by the\r\nmother\'s anxious gaze.\r\n\r\n"And he was quite well when you parted with him?"\r\n\r\n"Quite."\r\n\r\n"Ah! you nursed my boy, and we must nurse you for him."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, I am quite well."  But she bit her lip, and spoke\r\nconstrainedly, as if too shy and reserved to give way to the rush of\r\nemotion; but the coldness pained Mrs. Poynsett, whose expansiveness\r\nwas easily checked; and a brief silence was followed by Charlie\'s\r\nreturn to report that he could not find nurse, and thought she was\r\nout with the other servants, watching for the arrival; in another\r\nmoment, the approaching cheers caused him to rush out; and after\r\nmany more noises, showing the excitement of the multitude and the\r\nadvance of the bridal pair, during which Mrs. Poynsett lay with\r\ndeepening colour and clasped hands, her nostrils dilating with\r\nanxiety and suppressed eagerness, there entered a tall, dark,\r\nsunburnt man bringing on his arm a little, trim, upright, girlish\r\nfigure; and bending down, he exclaimed, "There, mother, I\'ve brought\r\nher--here\'s your daughter!"\r\n\r\nTwo little gloved hands were put into hers, and a kiss exchanged,\r\nwhile Raymond anxiously inquired for his mother\'s health; and she\r\nbroke in by saying, "And here is Anne--Miles\'s Anne, just arrived."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I did not see you in the dark," said Raymond.  "There, Cecil,\r\nis a sister for you--you never had one."\r\n\r\nCecil was readier with greeting hand and cheek than was Anne, but at\r\nthe same moment the tea equipage was brought in, and Cecil, quite\r\nnaturally, and as a matter of course, began to preside over the low\r\ntable, while Raymond took his accustomed chair on the further side\r\nof his mother\'s sofa, where he could lean over the arm and study her\r\ncountenance, while she fondled the hand that he had hung over the\r\nback.  He was describing the welcome at the station, and all through\r\nthe village--the triumphal arches and shouts.\r\n\r\n"But how they _did_ miss you, mother," said Charlie.  "Old Gurnet\r\nwrung my hand in tears as he said, \'Yes, sir, \'tis very fine, but it\r\nbeats the heart out of it that madam bain\'t here to see.\'"\r\n\r\n"Good old Gurnet!" responded Raymond.  "They are famously loyal.\r\nThe J. C. P. crowned all above all the Cs and Rs, I was happy to\r\nsee."\r\n\r\n"J. was for Julius--not Julia," said the mother.\r\n\r\n"No; J. H. C. and R. C. had a separate device of roses all to\r\nthemselves.  Hark! is that a cheer beginning again?  Had we not\r\nbetter go into the drawing-room, mother? it will be so many for you\r\nall together."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, I must see you all."\r\n\r\nThe brothers hurried out with their welcome; and in another minute,\r\na plump soft cheek was pressed to the mother\'s, devouring kisses\r\nwere hailed on her, and a fuller sweeter tone than had yet been\r\nheard answered the welcome.\r\n\r\n"Thank you.  So kind!  Here\'s Julius!  I\'ll not be in your way."\r\n\r\n"Dearest mother, how is it with you?" as her son embraced her.\r\n"Rose has been longing to be with you."\r\n\r\n"And we\'ve all come together!  How delicious!" cried Rosamond,\r\nenfolding Anne in her embrace; "I didn\'t know you were come!--See,\r\nJulius!"\r\n\r\nBut as Julius turned, a startled look came over Anne\'s face; and she\r\nturned so white, that Rosamond exclaimed, "My dear--what--she\'s\r\nfaint!"  And while Cecil stood looking puzzled, Rosamond had her arm\r\nround the trembling form, and disappeared with her, guided and\r\nassisted by Nurse Susan.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t she--?" exclaimed Julius, in a voice of triumph that made all\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Full of sweet kindness," said Mrs. Poynsett; "but I have only seen\r\nand heard her yet, my dear Julius.  Susan will take her to her room--\r\nmy old one."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you, mother," said Julius, "but I hardly like that; it\r\nseems like your giving it up."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, it proves that I do not give it up, since I put in\r\ntemporary lodgers like you.--Now Cecil is housed as you preferred,\r\nRaymond--in the wainscot-rooms."\r\n\r\n"And where have you put that poor Mrs. Miles?" asked Raymond.  "She\r\nlooks quite knocked up."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she has been very ill on the voyage, and waited at Southampton\r\nto gather strength for the journey.--I am so grateful to your good\r\nRose, Julius.--Why, where is the boy?  Vanished in her wake, I\r\ndeclare!"\r\n\r\n"His venerable head is quite turned," said Frank.  "I had to get\r\ninside alone, and let them drive home outside together to avoid\r\nseparation."\r\n\r\nRaymond repeated his question as to the quarters of Miles\'s wife.\r\n\r\n"I had the old schoolroom and the bedroom adjoining newly fitted\r\nup," answered Mrs. Poynsett.  "Jenny Bowater was here yesterday, and\r\ngave the finishing touches.  She tells me the rooms look very nice.--\r\nCecil, my dear, you must excuse deficiencies; I shall look to you\r\nin future."\r\n\r\n"I hope to manage well," said Cecil.  "Had I not better go up now?\r\nWill you show me the way, Raymond?"\r\n\r\nThe mother and her two younger sons remained.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t I brought you home a splendid article?" was Frank\'s\r\nexclamation.  "Julius has got the best of it."\r\n\r\n"I back my Cape Gooseberry," returned Charles.  "She has eyes and\r\nhair and skin that my Lady can\'t match, and is a fine figure of a\r\nwoman besides."\r\n\r\n"Much you know of Rosamond\'s eyes!"\r\n\r\n"Or you either, boxed up in the van."\r\n\r\n"Any way, they have made roast meat of his Reverence\'s heart!  The\r\nother two take it much more easily."\r\n\r\n"She\'s a mere chicken," said Charlie.  "Who would have thought of\r\nRaymond being caught by a callow nestling?"\r\n\r\n"And so uncommonly cool," added Frank.\r\n\r\n"It would take much to transform Raymond," interposed the mother.\r\n"Now, boys, away with you; I must have a little quiet, to repair\r\nmyself for company after dinner."\r\n\r\nCharlie settled her cushions with womanly skill, and followed his\r\nbrother.  "Well, Frank, which is the White Cat?  Ah, I thought so--\r\nshe\'s yet to come."\r\n\r\n"Not one is fit to hold a candle to _her_.  You saw that as plain as\r\nI did, Charlie; Eleonora beats them all."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you\'re not the youngest brother, remember.  It was he who\r\nbrought her home at last.  Come, you need not knock me down; I shall\r\nnever see any one to surpass the mother, and I\'ll have no one till I\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nThe Population of Compton Poynsett\r\n\r\n\r\nHe wanted a wife his braw hoose to keep,\r\nBut favour wi\' wooin\' was fashous to seek.--Laird o\' Cockpen\r\n\r\nIn the bright lamplight of the dining-table, the new population\r\nfirst fully beheld one another, and understood one another\'s looks.\r\n\r\nThere was much family resemblance between the five brothers.  All\r\nwere well-grown well-made men, strong and agile, the countenance\r\npleasing, rather square of mould, eyebrows straight and thick, nose\r\nwell cut and short, chin firm and resolute-looking, and the\r\ncomplexion very dark in Raymond, Frank, and the absent Miles.\r\nFrank\'s eyes were soft, brown, rather pensive, and absent in\r\nexpression; but Raymond\'s were much deeper and darker, and had a\r\nsteadfast gravity, that made him be viewed as formidable, especially\r\nas he had lost all the youthful glow of colouring that mantled in\r\nhis brother\'s olive cheek; and he had a short, thick, curly brown\r\nbeard, while Frank had only attained to a black moustache, that\r\nmight almost have been drawn on his lip with charcoal.\r\n\r\nCharlie was an exception--fair, blue-eyed, rosy, and with a soft\r\nfeminine contour of visage, which had often drawn on him reproaches\r\nfor not being really the daughter all his mother\'s friends desired\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\nAnd Julius, with the outlines of the others, was Albino, with\r\ntransparent skin mantling with colour that contrasted with his snowy\r\nhair, eyebrows, and the lashes, veiling eyes of a curious coral hue,\r\nreally not unpleasing under their thick white fringes, but most\r\ninconveniently short of sight, although capable of much work; in\r\nfact, he was a curiously perfect pink-and-white edition of his dark\r\nand bronzed brother the sailor.\r\n\r\nThe dark eyes came from the father\'s side; Cecil had them, and very\r\nobserving orbs they seemed to be, travelling about from one face to\r\nanother, and into every corner of the room, scrutinizing every\r\npicture or piece of plate, and trying to see into the conservatory,\r\nwhich had a glass door opening from one end of the room.  She was\r\nthe youngest of the brides, and her features and form seemed hardly\r\ndeveloped, nor had she attained the air of a matron; her fashionable\r\ndress of crisp white worked muslin with blue trimmings, and blue\r\nribbons in her brown hair, only gave her the air of a young girl at\r\nher first party, in spite of her freedom from all shyness as she sat\r\nat the head of the table in contented self-possession, her little\r\nslender figure as upright as a perfect spine could make it.\r\n\r\nVery different was the bride on Raymond\'s right hand.  She was of\r\nmiddle height, soft, round, and plump, carrying her head a little\r\ntenderly on one side with a delightful degagee kind of ease, and air\r\nof vivacious indolence.  Her complexion was creamy and colourless,\r\nher nose rather retrousse, her lips full and parting in a delicious\r\nroguish smile, answering to the sleepily twinkling eyes, whose\r\nirides seemed to shade so imperceptibly into the palest gray, that\r\nthere was no telling where the pupils ended, especially as the lids\r\nwere habitually half closed, as if weighed down by the black length\r\nof their borders.  The habit of arching up one or other of the\r\neyebrows, in surprise or interrogation, gave a drollery to the\r\notherwise nonchalant sweetness of the countenance.  The mass of\r\nraven black hair was only adorned by a crimson ribbon, beneath which\r\nit had been thrust into a net, with a long thing that had once been\r\na curl on the shoulder of the white tumbled bodice worn over a gray\r\nskirt which looked as if it had done solitary duty for the five\r\nweeks since the marriage, and was but slightly relieved by a crimson\r\nsash.\r\n\r\nRosamond made some apology when she saw Cecil\'s dainty equipment.\r\n"Dressed, you correct little thing!  You put me to shame; but I had\r\nno notion which box my evening things are in, and it would have been\r\nserious to irritate the whole concern."\r\n\r\n"And she was some time with Anne," added Julius.\r\n\r\n"Ah! with my good will Anne should not have been here!" rejoined\r\nRosamond.  "Didn\'t I meet old Mrs. Nurse at your threshold, with an\r\ninvitation from Mrs. Poynsett to dine with her in her room, and\r\ndidn\'t we find the bird flown at the first stroke of the gong?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am very well!" repeated Anne.\r\n\r\nYet she was far more colourless than Julius, for her complexion was\r\nnot only faded by sickness, but was naturally of the whitest blonde\r\ntint; the simple coils of her hair "lint white," and her eyes of the\r\nlightest tint of pure blue.  The features were of Scottish type, all\r\nthe more so from being exaggerated by recent illness; but they were\r\nhandsome enough to show that she must have been a bonnie lassie when\r\nher good looks were unimpaired.  Her figure far surpassed in height\r\nthat of both the other ladies, and was very slender, bending with\r\nlanguor and fatigue in spite of her strenuous attempts to straighten\r\nit.  She was clad in a perfectly plain, almost quaker-looking light\r\ndove-coloured silk dress, fitting closely, and unrelieved by any\r\nribbon or ornament of any description, so that her whole appearance\r\nsuggested nothing but the words "washed out."\r\n\r\nIt was clear that to let her alone was merciful, and there was no\r\nlack of mutual communications among the rest.  Frank and Charlie\r\ngave their account of the condition of the game.\r\n\r\n"Do you let your tenants shoot rabbits?" exclaimed Cecil, as if\r\nscandalized.  "We never do at Dunstone."\r\n\r\n"It prevents an immense amount of discontent and ill-will and\r\nunderhand work," said Raymond.\r\n\r\n"My father never will listen to any nonsense about rabbits,"\r\nproceeded Cecil.  "If you once begin there is no end to it, they are\r\nsure to encroach.  He just sends them a basket of game at the\r\nbeginning and end of the season."\r\n\r\n"By the bye," said Raymond, "I hope ours have all been sent out as\r\nusual."\r\n\r\n"I can answer for a splendid one at our wedding breakfast," said\r\nRosamond.  "The mess-man who came to help was lost in admiration.\r\nDid you breakfast on ortolans, Cecil?"\r\n\r\n"Or on nightingales\' tongues?" added Charlie.\r\n\r\n"You might as well say fatted dormice and snails," said Frank.  "One\r\nwould think the event had been eighteen hundred years ago."\r\n\r\n"Poor Frank! he\'s stuffed so hard that it is bursting out at all his\r\npores!" exclaimed Charlie.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you have the advantage of your elder, Master Charles!" said\r\nRaymond, with a paternal sound of approbation.\r\n\r\n"Till next time," said Frank.  "Now, thank goodness, mine is once\r\nfor all!"\r\n\r\nThe conversation drifted away to Venice and the homeward journey,\r\nwhich Raymond and Cecil seemed to have spent in unremitting sight-\r\nseeing.  The quantities of mountains, cathedrals, and pictures they\r\nhad inspected was quite appalling.\r\n\r\n"How hard you must have worked!" exclaimed Rosamond.  "Had you never\r\na day\'s rest out of the thirty?"\r\n\r\n"Had we, Cecil?  I believe not," said Raymond.\r\n\r\n"Sundays?" gasped Anne\'s low voice at his elbow.\r\n\r\n"Indeed," triumphantly returned Cecil, "between English service and\r\nHigh Mass, and Benediction, and the public gardens, and listening to\r\nthe band, we had not a single blank Sunday."\r\n\r\nAnne started and looked aghast; and Raymond said, "The opportunity\r\nwas not to be wasted, and Cecil enjoyed everything with unwearied\r\nvigour."\r\n\r\n"Why, what else should we have done?  It would have been very dull\r\nand stupid to have stayed in together," said Cecil, with a world of\r\ninnocent wonder in her eyes.  Then turning to her neighbour,\r\n"Surely, Julius, you went about and saw things!"\r\n\r\n"The sea at Filey Bridge, and the Church Congress at Leeds," he\r\nanswered, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Very shocking, is it not, Cecil?" said Rosamond, with mock gravity;\r\n"but he must be forgiven, for he was tired to death!  I used to\r\nthink, for my part, that lovers were a sort of mild lunatics, never\r\nto be troubled or trusted with any earthly thing; but that\'s one of\r\nthe things modern times have changed!  As he was to be going, all\r\nthe clerical staff of St. Awdry\'s must needs have their holiday and\r\nleave him to do their work; indeed, one was sent off here.  For six\r\nweeks I never saw him, except when he used to rush in to say he\r\ncouldn\'t stay; and when at last we were safe in the coupe, he fairly\r\nwent to sleep before we got to the first station.--Hush! you _know_\r\nyou did!  And no wonder, for he had been up two nights with some\r\nsort of infidel who was supposed to be dying.  Then that first week\r\nat Filey, he used to bring out his poetry books as the proper sort\r\nof thing, and try to read them to me on the sands:  but by the time\r\nhe had got to the bottom of a page, I used to hear the words\r\ndragging out slower and slower--\r\n\r\nWhereon the--lily--maid--of--Astolat\r\nLay--smiling--like--a--star-fish--fast--asleep."\r\n\r\nWherewith Rosamond dropped her head and closed her eyes; while the\r\nbrothers shouted with mirth, except Frank, whose countenance was \'of\r\none hurt on a vulnerable side.\'\r\n\r\n"Disrespect to Elaine?  Eh, Frank?" said Charlie; "how many pegs has\r\nJulius gone down in your estimation?"\r\n\r\nFrank would not commit himself, but he was evidently at the era of\r\nsensitiveness on the poetical side.  Cecil spoke for him.  "How very\r\nprovoking!  What did you do to him, Rosamond?"\r\n\r\n"I kept off the sand-flies!  I can\'t say but I was glad of a little\r\nrest, for I had been packing up for the whole family for ten days\r\npast, with interludes of rushing out into the town; for whatever we\r\nhad not forgotten, the shops had not sent home!  Oh! what a paradise\r\nof quiet it was under the rocks at Filey--wasn\'t it, Julius?"\r\n\r\n"We will go there again next time we have a chance," said Julius,\r\nlooking blissful.\r\n\r\n"I would never go again to the same place," cried Cecil.  "That\'s\r\nnot the way to acquire new ideas."\r\n\r\n"We are too old to acquire new ideas, my dear," drawled Rosamond,\r\nsleepily.\r\n\r\n"What did you go to the Church Congress for!" asked Charlie.\r\n\r\n"I hope Julius was awake by that time," said Frank.\r\n\r\n"Not if we are to have all the new ideas tried on us," said Raymond,\r\ndryly.\r\n\r\n"I went to a Congress once!" exclaimed Cecil.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said her husband, surprised.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  We thought we ought to encourage them.  It was the Congress\r\nof Sunday-school managers for our archdeaconry."\r\n\r\n"Did you acquire any new ideas?" asked Frank; while Rosamond\'s very\r\neyelashes seemed to curl with suppressed diversion.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes.  We explained our system of tickets, and the Arch-deacon\r\nsaid it was a very good one, and ought to be adopted everywhere."\r\n\r\nThis mode of acquisition of new ideas was quite too much for Julius\r\nand Charlie, who both exploded; but Frank retained composure enough\r\nto ask, "Did you explain it in person?"\r\n\r\n"No.  We made Mr. Venn."\r\n\r\n"The schoolmaster?" said Julius.\r\n\r\n"No.  He is _our_ clergyman, and he always does as _we_ tell him;\r\nand _so_ Dunstone is quite the model parish of the archdeaconry."\r\n\r\nJulius could not help making an odd little bend of the head, half\r\ndeferential, half satirical; and Raymond said, "Cecil, I believe it\r\nrests with you to make the move."  An ingenuous girlish blush\r\nmantled on her cheek as she looked towards Rosamond and moved.\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room adjoined the dining-room, and likewise had a glass\r\ndoor leading into the conservatory; but this, like the other\r\nwindows, was concealed by the pale-blue damask curtains that\r\ndescended from cornices gilded like the legs of the substantial\r\nchairs and sofas.  There was, however, no lack of modern light cane\r\nand basket seats round the fire, and it looked cheery and\r\ncomfortable.  Rosamond put an arm round Anne\'s waist--"Poor tired\r\ndear, come and lie on the sofa."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, I couldn\'t.  The gentlemen will come in."\r\n\r\n"All brothers!  What, will you only be satisfied with an easy-chair!\r\nA charming room, and a charming fire!"\r\n\r\n"Not so nice as a library," said Cecil, stabbing the fire with the\r\npoker as a sort of act of possession.  "We always sit in the library\r\nat Dunstone.  State rooms are horrid."\r\n\r\n"This only wants to be littered down," said Rosamond.  "That\'s my\r\nfirst task in fresh quarters, banishing some things and upsetting\r\nthe rest, and strewing our own about judiciously.  There are the\r\ninevitable wax-flowers.  I have regular blarney about their being so\r\nlovely, that it would just go to my heart to expose them to the\r\nboys."\r\n\r\n"You have always been on the move," said Cecil, who was standing by\r\nthe table examining the ornaments.\r\n\r\n"You may say so! there are not many of Her Majesty\'s garrisons that\r\nI have not had experience of, except my native country that I wasn\'t\r\nborn in.  It was very mean of them never once to send us to\r\nIreland."\r\n\r\n"Where were you born?" said Cecil, neither of the two catching at\r\nthe bull which perhaps Rosamond had allowed to escape by way of\r\ntrying them.\r\n\r\n"At Plymouth.  Dick and I were both born at Plymouth, and Maurice at\r\nScutari; then we were in the West Indies; the next two were born all\r\nup and down in Jamaica and all the rest of the Islands--Tom and\r\nTerry--dear boys, I\'ve got the charge of them now they are left at\r\nschool.  Three more are Canadians; and little Nora is the only\r\nIrish-born one amongst us."\r\n\r\n"I thought you said you had never been in Ireland."\r\n\r\n"Never quartered there, but on visits at Rathforlane," said\r\nRosamond.  "Our ten years at home we have been up and down the\r\nworld, till at last you see I\'ve ended where I began--at Plymouth."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what a lovely Florentine mosaic!" exclaimed Cecil, who had\r\ntaken but slight interest in this itinerary.  "It is just like a\r\nweight at Dunstone."  Then opening a miniature-case, "Who is this--\r\nMrs. Poynsett when she was young?"\r\n\r\n"Most likely," said Rosamond.  "It is like her now, and very like\r\nCharlie."\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Charles is quite unlike the family."\r\n\r\n"What family?" said Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"The Charnocks, of course.  Raymond is a perfect Charnock!"\r\n\r\n"A vast advantage," murmured Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Cecil, taking it quite seriously.  "No one else\r\ncould be the same thing to us.  Papa said there was not a match in\r\nthe whole world that could have gratified him so much."\r\n\r\n"How old are you, Cecil?" quoth Rosamond, with a ripple in her\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"Oh, his age was no matter.  I don\'t like young men.  That\'s not the\r\ndrawback; no, it is that horrid Poynsett at the end of the name."\r\n\r\n"You see you had better have waived your objections to youth, and\r\ntaken a younger son."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t," said this naive young person.  "Besides, there is much\r\nmore of a field for me here than at Dunstone since papa\'s marriage."\r\n\r\nWhatever Rosamond had on the tip of her tongue was averted by the\r\nentrance of the three younger brothers.  Julius seated himself\r\nbeside her in the cushioned fireside corner; and Cecil asked where\r\nRaymond was.\r\n\r\n"Just stepped in to see my mother," said Frank.  "This room opens\r\ninto hers.  Will you come to them?"\r\n\r\n"Not yet," said Cecil.  "I want you to tell me about the\r\nneighbourhood."\r\n\r\n"Just what I want," said Rosamond.  "Whenever I ask, Julius always\r\nsays there\'s Dr. Easterby."\r\n\r\nFrank and Charlie burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n"Dr. Easterby is one of the greatest men in the English Church,"\r\nsaid Julius.\r\n\r\n"Precisely!  But what is the regiment at Backsworth?" and as Charlie\r\nnamed it, "Oh, what fun!  That\'s where Laurie Cookson exchanged.  He\r\nwill be sure to send us cards for everything."\r\n\r\n"At Dunstone we never used to go to garrison gaieties," said Cecil,\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n"Oh!  I\'m a military pariah," said Rosamond, hastily.\r\n\r\n"Who are the land-owners?" continued Cecil.  "There was a place I\r\nsaw from the line, but Raymond didn\'t hear when I asked whose it\r\nwas.  Close to the station, I mean."\r\n\r\n"That is Sirenwood," said Charles.  "Sir Harry Vivian\'s.  He is just\r\ncome back there with his two daughters."\r\n\r\n"I thought Emily Vivian was dead," said Julius.  "You don\'t mean\r\n_that_ women!"\r\n\r\n"_That_ woman?" laughed his wife.  "What has she done to be a _that_\r\nwoman?"\r\n\r\n"Offended his Reverence," said Frank, in that sort of jocose tone\r\nwhich betrays annoyance.\r\n\r\n"A heartless mischievous woman!" said Julius.\r\n\r\nRosamond cocked up her left eyebrow with an ineffably droll look,\r\nwhich encouraged Charlie to say, "Such fierceness can only be\r\nprompted by personal experience.  Look out, Rosamond!"\r\n\r\n"Come \'fess, Julius," said she, merrily.  "\'Fess and make it up."\r\n\r\n"I--I have nothing to confess," said Julius, seriously.\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t he indeed?" said she, looking at the brothers.\r\n\r\n"Oh! don\'t ask us," said Charlie.  "His youthful indiscretions were\r\nover long before our eyes had risen above the horizon!"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that they have really come home to live here?" demanded\r\nJulius, with singular indifference to the personal insinuations.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry it is so painful to you," said I Frank, somewhat\r\nironically; "but Sir Harry thinks it right to return and end his\r\ndays among his own people."\r\n\r\n"Is he ill, then?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t gratify you so far," returned Frank; "he is a fine old\r\nfellow of sixty-five.  Just what humbugging papers call a regular\r\nspecimen of an old English gentleman," he added to Cecil.\r\n\r\n"Humbugging indeed, I should hope," muttered Julius.  "The old\r\nEnglish gentleman has reason to complain!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s the charity of the clergy!" exclaimed Frank.  "No\r\nforgiveness for a man who has spent a little in his youth!"\r\n\r\n"As an essential of the old English gentleman?" asked Julius.\r\n\r\n"At any rate, the poor old fellow has been punished enough," said\r\nCharlie.\r\n\r\n"But what is it?  Tell me all about it," said Cecil.  "I am sure my\r\nfather would not wish me to associate with dissipated people."\r\n\r\n"Ah!  Cecil," said Rosamond.  "You\'ll have to take refuge with the\r\nmilitary, after all!"\r\n\r\n"It is just this," said Charlie.  "Sir Harry and his only son were\r\nalways extravagant, one as bad as the other--weren\'t they, Julius?\r\nPhil Bowater told me all about it, and how Tom Vivian lost fifteen\r\nthousand pounds one Derby Day, and was found dead in his chambers\r\nthe next morning, they said from an over-dose of chloroform for\r\nneuralgia.  Then the estate was so dipped that Sir Harry had to give\r\nup the estate to his creditors, and live on an allowance abroad or\r\nat watering-places till now, when he has managed to come home.  That\r\nis to say, the house is really leased to Lady Tyrrell, and he is in\r\na measure her guest--very queer it must be for him in his own\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"Is Lady Tyrrell _that_ woman?" asked Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"I conclude so," said Charlie.  "She was the eldest daughter, and\r\nmarried Lord Tyrrell, who died about two years ago.  She has no\r\nchildren, so she has taken the family in charge, patches up Sir\r\nHarry\'s affairs with her jointure, and chaperons her sister."\r\n\r\n"What is she like?"\r\n\r\n"Ask Frank," said Charlie, slyly.\r\n\r\n"No!" said Frank, with dignity.  "I shall say no more, I only excite\r\nprejudice."\r\n\r\n"You are right, Frank," said Julius, who had evidently recovered\r\nfrom the shock.  "It is not fair to judge people now from what they\r\nwere eleven years ago.  They have had some terrible lessons, and may\r\nbe much changed."\r\n\r\n"Ay," said Frank; "and they have been living in an atmosphere\r\ncongenial to you, at Rockpier, and are hand and glove with all the\r\nSt. Chrysostom folk there.  What do you say to that, Julius?  I can\r\ntell you they are enchanted with your curate!"\r\n\r\n"They are not in this parish."\r\n\r\n"No, but they turn up here--the ladies, at least--at all the\r\nservices at odd times that Bindon has begun with."\r\n\r\n"Ah! by the bye, is Herbert Bowater come?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the whole family came over to his installation in Mrs.\r\nHornblower\'s lodgings."\r\n\r\n"I saw him this morning, poor old Herbs," added Frank, "looking\r\nuncommonly as if he felt himself in a strait waistcoat."\r\n\r\n"What, are there two curates?" demanded Cecil, in a tone of\r\nreprobation.\r\n\r\nJulius made a gesture of assent, with a certain humorous air of\r\ndeprecation, which, however, was lost upon her.\r\n\r\n"We never let Mr. Venn have one," continued Cecil, "except one\r\nwinter when he was ill, and then not a young one.  Papa says idle\r\nyoung clergymen are not to be encouraged."\r\n\r\n"I am entirely of Mr. Charnock\'s opinion.  But if I have exceeded\r\nthe Dunstone standard, it was not willingly.  Herbert Bowater is the\r\nson of some old friends of my mother\'s, who wanted to keep their son\r\nnear home, and made it their request that I would give him a title."\r\n\r\n"And the Bowaters are the great feature in the neighbourhood," added\r\nFrank.  "Herbert tells me there are wonderful designs for\r\nentertaining the brides."\r\n\r\n"What do they consist of?" asked Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"All the component parts of a family," said Frank.  "The eldest\r\ndaughter is a sort of sheet-anchor to my mother, as well as her own.\r\nThe eldest son is at home now.  He is in the army."\r\n\r\n"In the Light Dragoons?" asked Rosamond.  "Oh! then I knew him at\r\nEdinburgh!  A man with yellow whiskers, and the next thing to a\r\nstutter."\r\n\r\n"I declare, Julius, she is as good as any army list," exclaimed\r\nCharlie.\r\n\r\n"There\'s praise!" cried Frank.  "The army list is his one book!\r\nWhat a piece of luck to have you to coach him up in it!"\r\n\r\n"I dare say Rosamond can tell me lots of wrinkles for my outfit,"\r\nsaid Charles.\r\n\r\n"I should hope so, having rigged out Dick for the line, and Maurice\r\nfor the artillery!"\r\n\r\nCharlie came and leant on the mantel-shelf, and commenced a\r\nconversation sotto voce on the subject nearest his heart; while\r\nCecil continued her catechism.\r\n\r\n"Are the Bowaters intellectual?"\r\n\r\n"Jenny is very well read," said Julius, "a very sensible person."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Frank; "she was the only person here that so much as\r\ntried to read Browning.  But if Cecil wants intellect, she had\r\nbetter take to the Duncombes, the queerest firm I ever fell in with.\r\nHe makes the turf a regular profession, actually gets a livelihood\r\nout of his betting-book; and she is in the strong-minded line--\r\nwoman\'s rights, and all the rest of it."\r\n\r\n"We never had such people at Dunstone," said Cecil.  "Papa always\r\nsaid that the evil of being in parliament was the having to be civil\r\nto everybody."\r\n\r\nJust then Raymond came back with intelligence that his mother was\r\nabout to go to bed, and to call his wife to wish her good night.\r\nAll went in succession to do the same.\r\n\r\n"My dear," she said to Anne, "I hoped you were in bed."\r\n\r\n"I thought I would wait for family worship."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid we don\'t have prayers at night, my dear.  We must\r\nresume them in the morning, now Raymond and Julius are come."\r\n\r\nPoor Anne looked all the whiter, and only mumbled out a few answers\r\nto the kind counsels lavished upon her.  Mrs. Poynsett was left to\r\nthink over her daughters-in-law.\r\n\r\nLady Rosamond did not occupy her much.  There was evidently plenty\r\nof good strong love between her and her husband; and though her\r\ntraining might not have been the best for a clergyman\'s wife, there\r\nwas substance enough in both to shake down together in time.\r\n\r\nBut it was Raymond who made her uneasy--Raymond, who ever since his\r\nfather\'s death had been more than all her other sons to her.  She\r\nhad armed herself against the pang of not being first with him, and\r\nnow she was full of vague anxiety at the sense that she still held\r\nher old position.  Had he not sat all the evening in his own place\r\nby her sofa, as if it were the very kernel of home and of repose?\r\nAnd whenever a sense of duty prompted her to suggest fetching his\r\nwife, had he not lingered, and gone on talking?  It was indeed of\r\nCecil; but how would she have liked his father, at the honeymoon\'s\r\nend, to prefer talking of her to talking with her?  "She has been\r\nmost carefully brought up, and is very intelligent and industrious,"\r\nsaid Raymond.  His mother could not help wondering whether a Roman\r\nson might not thus have described a highly accomplished Greek slave,\r\njust brought home for his mother\'s use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nParish Explorations\r\n\r\n\r\n   A cry more tuneable\r\nWas never holla\'d to, nor cheer\'d with horn,\r\nIn Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:\r\nJudge, when you hear.--But, soft; what nymphs are these?\r\nMidsummer Night\'s Dream\r\n\r\nIt was quite true that Cecil Charnock Poynsett was a very\r\nintelligent industrious creature, very carefully brought up--nay, if\r\npossible, a little too much so.  "A little wholesome neglect" had\r\nbeen lacking.\r\n\r\nThe only child of her parents who had lived to see a second birthday\r\nwas sure to be the centre of solicitude.  She had not been spoilt in\r\nthe usual acceptation of the word, for she had no liberty, fewer\r\nindulgences and luxuries than many children, and never was permitted\r\nto be naughty; but then she was quite aware that each dainty or each\r\npleasure was granted or withheld from a careful consideration of her\r\nwelfare, and that nothing came by chance with her.  And on her rare\r\nebullitions of self-will, mamma, governess, nurse, nay even papa,\r\nwere all in sorrowful commotion till their princess had been brought\r\nto a sense of the enormity of her fault.\r\n\r\nShe lost her mother at fourteen, but the same anxious training was\r\ncarried on by her father; and after three years he married her\r\nmother\'s most intimate friend, avowedly that the perfect system\r\nmight be continued.  Cecil\'s gaieties as a come-out young lady were\r\nselected on the same judicious principles as her childish\r\ndiversions; and if ever the Dunstone family favoured an\r\nentertainment not to their taste, it was after a debate on the need\r\nof condescension and good-nature.  She had, however, never had a\r\nseason in London--a place her father hated; but she was taken abroad\r\nas soon as she was deemed old enough thoroughly to appreciate what\r\nshe was to see there; and in Switzerland her Cousin Raymond, who had\r\nat different times visited Dunstone, overtook the party, and ere\r\nlong made his proposals.  He was the very man to whom two or three\r\ncenturies ago Mr. Charnock would have betrothed the heiress in her\r\ninfancy; and Cecil had never liked any one so well, feeling that her\r\ndestiny came to a proper culmination in bestowing her hand on the\r\nmost eligible Charnock, an M.P., and just a step above her father in\r\nrank and influence.\r\n\r\nHer step-mother was under orders to spend the winter in Italy and\r\nthe wedding had therefore taken place in Venice, so that Cecil might\r\nfinish her journey as a wife.  She had been very happy and fully\r\noccupied; Raymond, being younger and stronger than her parents, was\r\nmore competent to escort her to every height or depth to which she\r\nwished to go, hunted up information for her, and was her most\r\nobedient servant, only resisting any prolongation of the journey\r\nbeyond the legitimate four weeks; nor indeed had Cecil been desirous\r\nof deferring her introduction to her new sphere.\r\n\r\nThere she stood, her hair and pretty Parisian winter dress arranged\r\nto perfection, contemplating with approval the sitting-room that had\r\nbeen appropriated to her, the October sunshine lighting up the many-\r\ntinted trees around the smooth-shaven dewy lawn, and a bright fire\r\non the hearth, shelves and chiffoniers awaiting her property, and\r\npiles of parcels, suggestive of wedding presents, awaiting her hand.\r\nShe was standing at the table, turning out her travelling-bag with\r\nthe comfortable sensation that it was not to be immediately re-\r\npacked, and had just disinterred a whole library of note-books, when\r\nher husband opened the door.  "I believe Jenkins is waiting for your\r\nappearance to bring in the urn, my dear."\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming; but surely there ought to be a bell or gong to assemble\r\nthe family."\r\n\r\n"It might disturb my mother.  What sleep she gets is in the morning.\r\nI never go to her till eleven o\'clock, unless I am going out for the\r\nday."\r\n\r\n"And what will she want me to do for her?" asked Cecil, glancing at\r\nher empty shelves.\r\n\r\n"A woman\'s tact will soon find out.  All I wish is that she should\r\nbe your first object."\r\n\r\nIt was a much larger _all_ than could be realized by the son whose\r\nhappiest moments had been spent in devotion to her, and who thought\r\nthe motherless girl must rejoice doubly in such a mother.\r\n\r\n"But I am free till eleven," said Cecil.\r\n\r\n"Free always, I hope," he returned, with a shade of vexation.\r\nTherewith they descended the broad stairs into the panelled hall,\r\nwhere a great fire was blazing on the hearth, and Rosamond and the\r\ntwo young brothers were standing chatting merrily before it.\r\n\r\nJulius, she said, had his primary sermon heavy on his mind, and had\r\nrisen before day to attack it; and she sped away to summon him from\r\nMrs. Poynsett\'s beautiful old dressing-room, where he sat writing\r\namid all the old associations.  Anne was discovered hanging over the\r\ndining-room fire, looking whiter and more exhausted than the night\r\nbefore, having indeed been the first to come down-stairs.  She was\r\nrebuked for fatiguing herself, and again murmured something about\r\nfamily worship.\r\n\r\n"We must begin to-morrow," said Raymond.  "We have got a chaplain\r\nnow."\r\n\r\nJulius, however, on entering excused himself, saying that after\r\nSunday he should be at Matins at nine o\'clock; whereupon Anne looked\r\nat him in mute astonishment.\r\n\r\nRaymond, feeling that he ought to cultivate the solitary sister-in-\r\nlaw, began asking about Miles; but unlike the typical colonist, she\r\nwas very silent, and her replies were monosyllabic, till Rosamond\r\ncreated a diversion by talking to Frank; and then Raymond elicited\r\nthat Glen Fraser was far up the country--King Williamstown nearer\r\nthan any other town.  They had sent thither for a doctor for Miles,\r\nand he stayed one night, but said that mother\'s treatment was quite\r\nright; and as it was thirty miles off he did not come again.  Thirty\r\nmiles! what sort of roads?  Not bad for wagons.  It only took two\r\ndays to get there if the river was not in flood.  Had she not been\r\nmarried there?  Yes, they all rode in thither for the purpose.  Was\r\nit the nearest church, then?  There was one only nine miles off, to\r\nwhich papa went when there was service--one Sunday in three, "for he\r\nis an Episcopalian, you know."\r\n\r\n"And not your mother?" asked Cecil.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she was at home," said Anne.\r\n\r\n"Then had you a Presbyterian Kirk?" asked Cecil, remembering that in\r\nScotland gentle blood and Anglicanism did not go together as\r\nuniformly as she believed them to do in England.\r\n\r\n"There was one at Schneyder\'s Kloof, but that was Dutch."\r\n\r\n"Then did you go nowhere?" asked Cecil.\r\n\r\n"There was Mr. Pilgrim\'s."\r\n\r\n"A clergyman?"\r\n\r\n"No, a settler.  He used to pray and expound every Sunday."\r\n\r\n"What does he call himself?" said Cecil, growing more severe.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Anne.  "He gathers together a little flock of\r\nall denominations, who only care to hear the word."\r\n\r\n"Such a voice in the wilderness as often does good service," said\r\nJulius, with a perception that the side with which he least agreed\r\nbest deserved support.\r\n\r\nHe and Rosamond were bent on a tour of parochial inspection, as were\r\nRaymond and Cecil on a more domestic one, beginning with the\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\nCecil was the first lady down-stairs, all in claret colour trimmed\r\nwith gray fur, with a little fur and velvet cap upon her head.\r\n\r\n"There! it is a clear morning, and you can see the view," said\r\nRaymond, opening the hall door.\r\n\r\n"Very prettily undulating ground," she said, standing on the steps,\r\nand looking over a somewhat rapid slope scattered with trees to the\r\nopposite side of the valley, where a park with a red mansion in the\r\nmidst gleamed out among woods of green, red, orange, and brown\r\ntints.  "How you are shut in!  That great Spanish chestnut must be a\r\nperfect block when its leaves are out.  My father would never let it\r\nstand so near the house."\r\n\r\n"It is too near, but it was planted at the birth of my mother\'s\r\nbrother."\r\n\r\n"Who died?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, at seven years old.  It was her first grief."\r\n\r\n"Then it would vex her if you cut it."\r\n\r\nRaymond laughed.  "It is hers, not mine."\r\n\r\n"I forgot."  There was a good deal in the tone; but she added, "What\r\nis that place opposite?"\r\n\r\n"Sirenwood.  It belongs to Sir Harry Vivian; but he does not live\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he does," said Cecil.  "Your brothers say he has come back\r\nwith his two daughters."\r\n\r\n"There is only one unmarried."\r\n\r\n"There is a widow come to keep house for him--Lady Tyrrell."\r\n\r\n"Very likely," said Raymond; "my mother only writes with difficulty,\r\nso I hear little when I am from home."\r\n\r\n"Is it true that they are horrid people, very dissipated, and not\r\nfit for me to associate with?"\r\n\r\n"That is putting it strongly," said Raymond, quietly.  "They are not\r\nlikely to be very desirable acquaintances for you, but there is no\r\nreason you should not associate with them on ordinary terms of\r\ncourtesy."\r\n\r\n"Ah!  I understand--as member\'s wife."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what that has to do with it," said Raymond.  "Ah!\r\nRosamond!" as she came down in a Galway cloak over her black\r\nvelveteen, "on the way to view your domain?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and yours," she said, nodding to Cecil.  "You appreciate such\r\nEnglish apple-pie order.  It looks as if you never suffered a stray\r\nleaf to dance without an old woman to hunt it down.  And what\'s that\r\nred house smiling across the valley?"\r\n\r\n"Sirenwood," repeated Raymond; then to Julius he said, "Did you know\r\nit was inhabited again?"\r\n\r\n"Frank said so," answered Julius, without further remark, giving his\r\narm to his wife, who clasped both hands on it; while the other\r\ncouple looked on as if doubtful whether this were a trying duty\r\nincumbent on them.\r\n\r\n"What is it all about?" said Rosamond, as they walked down the\r\navenue of walnuts leading to the iron gates in the opposite\r\ndirection from Sirenwood.  "Which of you was _that woman\'s_ victim?\r\nWas it a sailor love of Miles\'s?  I hope not!  That poor little\r\nAfrican might not stand a gay ghost cropping up again."\r\n\r\n"Miles is far removed from the conventional sailor."\r\n\r\n"Then it is reduced to the grave Raymond."\r\n\r\n"I wish I had betrayed nothing."\r\n\r\n"Now you may as well proceed to betray the rest, instead of leaving\r\nme to exercise my fancy."\r\n\r\n"It is no secret, only such things are best not brought up again.\r\nCamilla Vivian was poor Raymond\'s grande passion, and you may\r\nimagine what a grief that was to my mother, especially as the poor\r\nbrother was then living--one of the most fascinating, dangerous men\r\nI ever saw; and the whole tone of the place was ultra gay and\r\nthoughtless, the most reckless extravagance.  However, he was set\r\nupon it, and my mother was forced to consent to the engagement.  She\r\nseemed equally devoted to him, till she met Lord Tyrrell at some\r\ncountry house, and then a quarrel was picked, either by her mother\r\nor herself, about my mother retaining the headship of her own house.\r\nIt was a palpable excuse, but it served to break the affair off, and\r\nRaymond was cruelly cut up.  My mother made herself everything to\r\nhim from that moment, gave up all her former habits to be with him,\r\nsent the little boys to school, and fairly dragged him through the\r\ntrouble!"\r\n\r\n"How long ago was it?"\r\n\r\n"Ten years--yes, ten years.  So far as ceasing to care a straw for a\r\nheartless woman like that, he has got over it, no doubt; but it has\r\nmade a graver man of him for life, and I doubt whether, but for my\r\nmother\'s accident, he ever would have married."\r\n\r\n"Did you marry for your mother\'s sake, Julius, or only tell her so?"\r\n\r\n"For shame, my Lady Mischief!"\r\n\r\n"And do you think the fair Camilla returned with plans that she\r\nfinds disconcerted?"\r\n\r\n"How can I tell?  I have not seen her since I was a lad of\r\neighteen.--Ah! how d\'ye do, Betty?" in a tone of relief; "you\'ve not\r\nseen my wife."\r\n\r\nThis was the first of a long series of introductions.  Compton\r\nPoynsett was a straggling village, with the church, schools, and\r\nRectory, ten minutes\' walk from the park gates.  It had not been\r\nneglected, so that Julius had not the doubtful satisfaction of\r\ncoming like a missionary or reformer.  The church, though not\r\nexactly as with his present lights he would have made it, was in\r\nrespectable order, and contained hardly anything obnoxious to his\r\ntaste; the schools were well built, properly officered, and the\r\nchildren under such discipline that Rosamond declared she could no\r\nmore meddle with them than with her father\'s regiment.\r\n\r\nThe Rectory was at that moment level with the ground, and Julius\r\nexplaining the plans, when up came the senior curate.  Mr. Bindon,\r\nwhom she, as well as Julius, greeted as an old friend, was the\r\ntypical modern priest, full of his work, and caring for nothing\r\nbesides, except a Swiss mountain once a year; a slight, spare,\r\nsmall, sallow man, but with an enormous power of untiring energy.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Rosamond shaken hands with him, standing where her\r\ndrawing-room rug was to be in future days, when a merry whistle came\r\nnear, and over the wall from the churchyard leapt first a black\r\nretriever, secondly a Skye terrier, thirdly a bull ditto, fourthly a\r\nyoung man, or rather an enormous boy, who for a moment stood amazed\r\nand disconcerted at the unexpectedly worshipful society into which\r\nhe had jumped!\r\n\r\n"Ha!  Herbert! is that you?" laughed Julius.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon!" he breathlessly exclaimed.  "I was just taking\r\nthe short cut!  I had no idea--Here, Mungo, you ruffian!" as the\r\nSkye was investigating Lady Rosamond\'s boot.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I like him of all things!  I am glad to welcome you to our\r\nfuture house!" as she held out her hand to the Reverend Herbert\r\nBowater, the junior curate, a deacon of a fortnight\'s standing,\r\nwhose round open happy blue eyes, ruddy cheeks, merry lips, and\r\ncurly light hair, did not seem in keeping with the rigidly straight\r\ncollar and waistcoat, and the long black coat, at present\r\nplentifully streaked with green tree-moss, while his boots and\r\ntrousers looked as if they had partaken of the mud-bath which his\r\ndogs had evidently been wallowing in.\r\n\r\n"Off! off!" were his words, as he shook hands with his rectoress.\r\n"Get away, Rollo!" with an energetic shove of the foot to the big\r\ndog, who was about to shake his dripping coat for the ladies\'\r\nspecial benefit.  "I saw you arrive last evening," he said, in the\r\nconversational tone of a gentlemanly school-boy; "didn\'t you find it\r\nvery cold?"\r\n\r\n"Not very.  I did not see you, though."\r\n\r\n"He was organizing the cheers," said Mr. Bindon.  "You shone in\r\nthat, Bowater.  They kept such good time."\r\n\r\n"You were very good to cheer us at all," said Julius, "coming in the\r\nwake of the Squire as we did."\r\n\r\n"The best of it was," said the junior, "that Charlie was so awfully\r\nafraid that he and poor Miles\'s wife would be taken for the Squire,\r\nthat he dashed in on his way to warn me to choke them off.  If she\r\nhadn\'t been ill, I must have set the boys on for a lark!  How is\r\nshe, though?" he asked in a really kind tone.\r\n\r\n"She looks very ill, poor thing," said Julius.\r\n\r\nHere the bull terrier became assiduous in his attentions to\r\nRosamond; and between his master\'s calls and apologies, and her\r\ncaresses and excuses, not much more was heard, till Julius asked\r\nwith mock gravity, "And are these all you\'ve brought over, Herbert?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, all; I\'d half a mind to bring the two greyhounds, but my\r\nfather thought they would get into trouble in the preserves, and\r\nthere isn\'t room at Mrs. Hornblower\'s place," he answered, with\r\napologetic simplicity.\r\n\r\n"What a pity Durham has been reduced!" said Mr. Bindon, dryly.  "It\r\nwould have been the right preferment for Bowater.  The Bishop was\r\nobliged by statute to keep a pack of hounds."\r\n\r\n"But, sir," expostulated the deacon, turning to the Rector,\r\ncolouring all over his honest rosy face, "you don\'t object!  You\r\nknow, of course, I\'ve given up sport," he added ruefully; "but only\r\njust as companions!--Ain\'t you, Rollo?" he added, almost with tears\r\nin his eyes, and a hand on the smooth black head, belonging to such\r\na wise benignant face, that Rosamond was tempted to pronounce the\r\ndog the more clerical looking of the two.\r\n\r\n"You are very welcome," said Julius, laughing, "provided you can\r\nmanage with the old women\'s cats.  I should find such companions\r\nrather awkward in pastoral visits."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll teach them, sir!  You may depend on it!  We did have a little\r\nflare-up yesterday, but I showed them the sense of it.  You might\r\nteach those dogs anything!--Ha! what then, Tartar!  Halloo, Mungo!\r\nRats, rats, rats!"\r\n\r\nA prodigious scratching and snorting was audible in what had been a\r\ncellar of the quondam Rectory; and Rollo, becoming excited, dashed\r\nup to the scene of action, with a deep bass war-cry, while, to\r\nRosamond\'s great amusement, "rats" was no less a peal to Rector and\r\nsenior; and for the next quarter of an hour the three clergymen\r\nmoved bricks, poked with their sticks, and cheered on the chase till\r\nthe church clock struck one, the masons began to return from dinner,\r\nand the sounds of the bell at the Hall recalled the party to order.\r\n\r\n"There, Rose!  Our first day!" said Julius, aghast.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better come to lunch at my rooms," said the young curate,\r\neagerly.  "Do!  Mother has brought the jolliest hamper!  Game-pie,\r\nand preserved magnum-bonums, and pears off the old jargonelle.--\r\nCome, Lady Rosamond, do.--Come along, Bindon!  There\'s such a dish\r\nof damson-cheese!  Do!"\r\n\r\nThat "_do_," between insinuation and heartiness, was so boyish, that\r\nit was quite irresistible to the lady, who consented eagerly, while\r\nJulius wrote a word or two on a card, which he despatched to the\r\nHall by the first child he encountered.  In a few minutes they\r\nreached the nice clean bay-windowed room over the village shop,\r\ncomically like an undergraduate\'s, in spite of the mother\'s and\r\nsister\'s recent touches.\r\n\r\nThere ensued a resolute quieting of the dogs, and a vigorous\r\nexertion of hospitality, necessitating some striding up and down\r\nstairs, and much shouting to Mrs. Hornblower and her little niece,\r\nwho rejoiced in the peculiar name of Dilemma; while Rosamond petted\r\nTartar upon her lap, and the two elder clergymen, each with an elbow\r\nagainst the window-frame and a knee on the seat, held council, based\r\non the Rector\'s old knowledge of the territory and the curate\'s\r\nrecent observations during his five weeks\' sojourn.\r\n\r\nThe plans to be put in force next week were arranged during the\r\nmeal, and the junior observed that he would walk home to-night and\r\nback on Saturday evening, since after that he should be tied pretty\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nAnd he started with Julius and Rosamond on their further progress,\r\nsoon, however, tumbling over another stone wall with all his dogs,\r\nand being only heard hallooing to them as they yelped after the\r\nlarks.\r\n\r\n"That is a delicious boy!" said Rosamond, laughing merrily.  "A nice\r\nfellow--but we mustn\'t make it a custom to be always going in to\r\npartake of his hampers, or we shall prey inordinately on Mrs.\r\nBowater\'s preserves."\r\n\r\n"He was just like the hero of\r\n\r\n"Oh, I have a plum-cake,\r\nAnd a rare feast I\'ll make."\r\n\r\nI do like a boy with a sweet tooth!"\r\n\r\n"Like him!  Of course I do.  The Bowaters are like one\'s own\r\nkindred!  I only hope I shall not spoil him."\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t his mother done that for you?"\r\n\r\n"I wish he had spent a year or two at Cuddesdon!  I ought to have\r\nseen him before consenting to give him a title at once, but his\r\nfather and Jenny wished it so much.  Ah! come in here.  Bindon said\r\nLucy Martin was a case for a lady."\r\n\r\nRosamond\'s hearty good-nature was much more at ease among ailing old\r\nwomen than prim school-children, and she gave great satisfaction in\r\nthe cottages.\r\n\r\nJulius did not of course come as a stranger, and had a general\r\nimpression as to names and families; but he had been absent, except\r\non short visits, for five years, so that Rosamond declared that this\r\nwas a staple of his conversation:  "Then it was Tom Deane--no, it\r\nwas John Deane that married Blake\'s son--no, it was Blake\'s daughter\r\nthat died who is living in the next house."\r\n\r\nThey finished with a long and miry lane, lying along the valley, and\r\nleading to the cottages of a little clan, the chief of whom seemed\r\nto be a large-boned lively-eyed old dame, who, after minute\r\ninquiries after "the Lady Poynsett," went on, "And be it true,\r\nMaster Julius, as that young gentleman of Squire Bowater\'s is one of\r\nyour passons?"\r\n\r\nJulius admitted the fact.\r\n\r\n"And be ye going to put he up in the pulpit to preach to we?  \'Pon\r\nmy word of honour, says I to Sally when her telled I, we shall have\r\nlittle Dick out of the infant-school next!"\r\n\r\n"We\'re all young, Betty!  Can\'t you put up with any one that is not\r\nolder than yourself!  I\'m afraid he would hardly be able to get up\r\nthe pulpit stair."\r\n\r\nThe Rector\'s reply delighted Betty; but she returned to the charge.\r\n"No, no, sir, I be coming to hear ye next Sunday.  Sally have turned\r\nmy black bonnet a purpose.  It be one of the Lady Poynsett\'s, as her\r\ngave I when my old gentleman was took two years after the Squire--\r\nwhen bonnets was bonnets, you know, ma\'am.  Now tell me true, be ye\r\nto preach morning or arternoon, sir?"\r\n\r\n"In the morning, I hope, Betty."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll be there, Master Julius, to the third seat from the\r\nfront; but it ain\'t becoming for a woman of my age, seventy-nine\r\ncome Christmas, to sit under a slip of a lad as hasn\'t got the taste\r\nof the birch off his back."\r\n\r\n"That\'s too bad, Betty," broke in Rosamond, speaking out of\r\nconviction.  "Mr. Bowater isn\'t so young as he looks, and he was too\r\ngood a boy ever to need the birch."\r\n\r\n"All the wuss for he," retorted the undaunted Betty.  "Spare the\r\nrod, and spile the child."\r\n\r\nThe village wit was left triumphant, and Julius proposed to return\r\nby a cross-road leading into the plantations.  Suddenly a scud of\r\nrain mixed with whirling yellow leaves sent them hurrying into a\r\ncart-shed, where, with a sudden start, they found themselves rushing\r\nin on some one.  Who was it?  A girl--a young lady.  That was\r\nevident, as Rosamond panted out, "I beg your pardon!" and the next\r\nmoment there was the exclamation, "Mr. Julius Charnock!  You don\'t\r\nremember me?  Eleonora Vivian!"\r\n\r\n"Miss Vivian! you have the advantage of me," said Julius, a little\r\nstiffly.  "Let me introduce my wife."\r\n\r\nThe hands met, and Rosamond perceived in the failing light a very\r\nfine-looking maiden, with a superbly carried head and neck, simply\r\ndressed in gray cloth.  "Are you sheltering here, or are you\r\nsketching?" she asked, seeing some paper and drawing materials.\r\n\r\n"I was giving a lesson.  See," exhibiting some bold outlines on\r\nlarge paper.  "Does not my pupil do me credit?"\r\n\r\n"Very spirited," said Rosamond.  "Where is she?"\r\n\r\n"_He_ is gone to fetch me his grandmother\'s umbrella.  He is the\r\nlittle Gurth of these parts."\r\n\r\n"Of whom you are making a Giotto?" asked Julius, thawing a little.\r\n\r\n"Exactly; I found him drawing on a barn-door with such zeal and\r\nspirit, that I could not help offering him some lessons.  Only see,\r\ndoes he not get on?  I wish I could get him to the school of\r\ndesign."\r\n\r\n"May I ask what becomes of his pigs?" demanded Julius.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you hear?" as sundry grunts and squeals of those eminently\r\nconversational animals were audible through the walls.  "They are\r\ndriven home to this rick-yard, so here I meet the boy."\r\n\r\n"Who is he?" asked the Rector.\r\n\r\n"I only know that he answers to the name of Joe.  And here he\r\ncomes," as a boy about ten years old came lumbering up in big boots,\r\nwith a heavy plaid shawl on one arm, and an immense green umbrella\r\nin the other.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Joe.  Make your bow to the lady and gentleman."\r\n\r\nThis was a pull of the flaxen forelock; for Joe was a slender,\r\npretty, fair boy, of that delicately-complexioned English type which\r\nis not roughened till after many years of exposure.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, my man," said Julius, kindly.  "What is your name?"\r\n\r\n"Please, sir, Joshua Reynolds."\r\n\r\n"Instinct," whispered Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Or influence of a name," returned Miss Vivian.\r\n\r\n"Are you one of Dan Reynolds\'s boys, or Tim\'s?" proceeded\r\n\r\n"No, I bides with granny."\r\n\r\nJulius made no further attempt at disentangling the pedigree but\r\ninquired about his employments.  Did he go to school?\r\n\r\n"When there ain\'t nothing to be done."\r\n\r\n"And what can be done by such a mite?" asked Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Tell the lady," said the Rector; "what work can you do?"\r\n\r\n"Bird-starving."\r\n\r\n"Well!"\r\n\r\n"And stoon-picking, and cow-herding, and odd jobs up at Farmer\r\nLight\'s; but they won\'t take I on for a carter-boy not yet \'cause I\r\nbean\'t not so lusty as some on \'em."\r\n\r\n"Have you learnt to read?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, very nicely," interposed Miss Vivian.\r\n\r\n"Did you teach him?" said Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"No!  He could read well before I came to the place.  I have only\r\nbeen at home six weeks, you know, and I did not know I was poaching\r\non your manor," she added sotto voce to Julius, who could not but\r\nanswer with warm thanks.\r\n\r\nIt was discovered that the rain had set in for the night, and an\r\namicable contest ensued between the ladies as to shawl and umbrella,\r\neach declaring her dress unspoilable, till it ended in Eleonora\r\nhaving the shawl, and both agreeing to share the umbrella as far as\r\nthe Sirenwood lodge.\r\n\r\nHowever, the umbrella refused to open, and had to be given to the\r\nboy, who set his teeth into an extraordinary grin, and so dealt with\r\nthe brazen gear as to expand a magnificent green vault, with a\r\nlesser leathern arctic zone round the pole; but when he had handed\r\nit to Miss Vivian, and she had linked her arm in Lady Rosamond\'s, it\r\nproved too mighty for her, tugged like a restive horse, and would\r\nfairly have run away with her, but for Rosamond\'s holding her fast.\r\n\r\n"Lost!" they cried.  "Two ladies carried away by an umbrella!"\r\n\r\n"Here, Julius, no one can grapple with it but you," called Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"I really think it\'s alive!" panted Eleonora, drawn up to her tip-\r\ntoes before she could hand it to Julius, who, with both clinging to\r\nhis arm, conducted them at last to the lodge, where Julius could\r\nonly come in as far as it would let him, since it could neither be\r\nlet down nor left to itself to fly to unknown regions.\r\n\r\nA keeper with a more manageable article undertook to convey Miss\r\nVivian home across the park; and with a pleasant farewell, husband\r\nand wife plodded their way home, along paths the mud of which could\r\nnot be seen, only heard and felt; and when Rosamond, in the light of\r\nthe hall, discovered the extent of the splashes, she had to leave\r\nJulius still contending with the umbrella; and when, in spite of the\r\nunited efforts of the butler and footman, it still refused to come\r\ndown, it was consigned to an empty coach-house, with orders that\r\nlittle Joe should have a shilling to bring it down and fetch it home\r\nin the morning!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nShades In Sunshine\r\n\r\n\r\nMy friends would be angered,\r\n   My minnie be mad.--Scots Song\r\n\r\n"Whom do you think we met, mother?" said Julius, coming into her\r\nroom, so soon as he had made his evening toilette, and finding there\r\nonly his two younger brothers.  "No other than Miss Vivian."\r\n\r\n"Ah! then," broke in Charlie, "you saw what Jenkins calls the\r\nperfect picture of a woman."\r\n\r\n"She is very handsome," soberly returned Julius.  "Rose is quite\r\ndelighted with her.  Do you know anything of her?"\r\n\r\n"Jenny Bowater was very fond of poor Emily," rejoined the mother.\r\n"I believe that she had a very good governess, but I wish she were\r\nin better hands now."\r\n\r\n"I cannot think why there should be a universal prejudice for the\r\nsake of one early offence!" exclaimed Frank.\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed!" said Julius, amazed at such a tone to his mother.\r\n\r\n"I only meant--mother, I beg your pardon--but you are only going by\r\nhearsay," answered Frank, in some confusion.\r\n\r\n"Then you have not seen her?" said Julius.\r\n\r\n"I!  I\'m the last person she is likely to seek, if you mean\r\nCamilla."\r\n\r\n"She inquired a great deal after you, mother," interposed Frank,\r\n"and said she longed to call, only she did not know if you could see\r\nher.  I do hope you will, when she calls on Cecil.  I am sure you\r\nwould think differently.  Promise me, mother!"\r\n\r\n"If she asks for me, I will, my boy," said Mrs. Poynsett, "but let\r\nme look!  You aren\'t dressed for dinner!  What will Mistress Cecil\r\nsay to you!  Ah! it is time you had ladies about the house again."\r\n\r\nThe two youths retreated; and Julius remained, looking anxiously and\r\nexpressively at his mother.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid so," she said; "but I had almost rather he were\r\nhonestly smitten with the young one than that he believed in\r\nCamilla."\r\n\r\n"I should think no one could long do that," said Julius.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know.  He met them when he was nursing that poor young\r\nScotsman at Rockpier, and got fascinated.  He has never been quite\r\nthe same since that time!" said the mother anxiously.  "I don\'t\r\nblame him, poor fellow!" she added eagerly, "or mean that he has\r\nbeen a bit less satisfactory--oh no!  Indeed, it may be my fault for\r\nexpressing my objection too\' plainly; he has always been reserved\r\nwith me since, and I never lost the confidence of one of my boys\r\nbefore!"\r\n\r\nThat Julius knew full well, for he--as the next eldest at home--had\r\nbeen the recipient of all his mother\'s perplexities at the time of\r\nRaymond\'s courtship.  Mrs. Poynsett had not been a woman of intimate\r\nfemale friends.  Her sons had served the purpose, and this was\r\nperhaps one great element in her almost unbounded influence with\r\nthem.  Julius was deeply concerned to see her eyes glistening with\r\ntears as she spoke of the cloud that had risen between her and\r\nFrank.\r\n\r\n"There is great hope that this younger one may be worthy," he said.\r\n"She has had a very different bringing up from her sister, and I did\r\nnot tell you what I found her doing.  She was teaching a little pig-\r\nherd boy to draw."\r\n\r\n"Ah!  I heard Lady Tyrrell was taking to the education of the people\r\nline."\r\n\r\n"I want to know who the boy is," said Julius.  "He called himself\r\nReynolds, and said he lived with granny, but was not a son of\r\nDaniel\'s or Timothy\'s.  He seemed about ten years old."\r\n\r\n"Reynolds?  Then I know who he must be.  Don\'t you remember a\r\npretty-looking girl we had in the nursery in Charlie\'s time?  His\r\n\'Fan-fan\' he used to call her."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes, I remember; she was a Reynolds, for both the little boys\r\ncould be excited to fury if we assumed that she was a fox.  You\r\ndon\'t mean that she went wrong?"\r\n\r\n"Not till after she had left us, and seemed to be doing well in\r\nanother place; but unfortunately she was allowed to have a holiday\r\nin the race week, and a day at the course seems to have done the\r\nmischief.  Susan can tell you all about it, if you want to know.\r\nShe was as broken-hearted as if Fanny had been her own child--much\r\nmore than the old mother herself, I fear."\r\n\r\n"What has become of the girl?"\r\n\r\n"Gone from bad to worse.  Alas!  I heard a report that she had been\r\nseen with some of the people who appear on the race-course with\r\nthose gambling shooting-galleries, or something of that sort."\r\n\r\n"Ah! those miserable races!  They are the bane of the country.  I\r\nwish no one would go near them."\r\n\r\n"They are a very pleasant county gathering."\r\n\r\n"To you, mother, and such as you; but you could have your county\r\nmeeting without doing quite so much harm.  If Raymond would only\r\nwithdraw his subscription."\r\n\r\n"It would be as much as his seat is worth!  Those races are the one\r\ngreat event of Wil\'sbro\' and Backsworth, the harvest of all the\r\ntradespeople.  Besides, you know what is said of their expedience as\r\nfar as horses are concerned."\r\n\r\n"I would sacrifice the breed of horses to prevent the evils," said\r\nJulius.\r\n\r\n"_You_ would, but--My boy, I suppose this is the right view for a\r\nclergyman, but it will never do to force it here.  You will lose all\r\ninfluence if you are over-strained."\r\n\r\n"Was St. Chrysostom over-strained about the hippodrome?" said\r\nJulius, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett looked at him as he leant upon the chimney-piece.\r\nHere was another son gone, in a different way, beyond her reach.\r\nShe had seen comparatively little of him since his University days;\r\nand though always a good and conscientious person, there had been\r\nnothing to draw her out of secular modes of thought; nor had she any\r\nconnection with the clerical world, so that she had not, as it were,\r\ngone along with the tone of mind that she had perceived in him.\r\n\r\nHe did not return to the subject, and they were soon joined by his\r\nelder brother.  At the first opportunity after dinner, Frank got\r\nRosamond up into a corner with a would-be indifferent "So you met\r\nMiss Vivian.  What did you think of her?"\r\n\r\nRosamond\'s intuition saw what she was required to think, and being\r\nexperienced in raving brothers, she praised the fine face and figure\r\nso as to find the way to his heart.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad you met her in that way.  Even Julius must be\r\nconvinced.  Was not he delighted?"\r\n\r\n"I think she grew upon him."\r\n\r\n"And now neither of you will be warped.  It is so very strange in my\r\nmother, generally the kindest, most open-hearted woman in the world,\r\nto distrust and bear a grudge against them all for the son\'s\r\ndissipation--just as if that affected the ladies of a family!"\r\n\r\n"I did not think it was entirely on his account," said Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Old stories of flirtation!" said Frank, scornfully; "but what are\r\nthey to be cast up against a woman in her widowhood?  It is so\r\nutterly unlike mother, I can\'t understand it."\r\n\r\n"Would not the natural conclusion be that she knew more, and had her\r\nreasons?"\r\n\r\n"I tell you, Rosamond, I know them infinitely better than she does.\r\nShe never saw them since Lady Tyrrell\'s marriage, when Eleonora was\r\na mere child; now I saw a great deal of them at Rockpier last year.\r\nThere was poor Jamie Armstrong sent down to spend the winter on the\r\nsouth coast; and as none of his own people could be with him, we--\r\nhis Oxford friends, I mean--took turns to come to him; and as I had\r\njust gone up for my degree, I had the most time.  The Vivians had\r\nbeen living there ever since they went on poor Emily\'s account.\r\nThey did not like to leave the place where she died you see; and\r\nLady Tyrrell had joined them after her husband\'s death.  Such a\r\npleasant house! no regular gaieties, of course, but a few friends in\r\na quiet way--music and charades, and so forth.  Every one knew\r\neverybody there; not a bit of our stiff county ways, but meeting all\r\nday long in the most sociable manner."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I know the style of place."\r\n\r\n"One gets better acquainted in a week than one does in seven years\r\nin a place like this," proceeded Frank.  "And you may tell Julius to\r\nask any of the clerics if Lenore was not a perfect darling with the\r\nVicar and his wife, and her sister too; and Rockpier is a regular\r\ntip-top place for Church, you know.  I\'m sure it was enough to make\r\na fellow good for life, just to see Eleonora walking up the aisle\r\nwith that sweet face of hers, looking more like heaven than earth."\r\n\r\nRosamond made reply enough to set him off again.  "Lady Tyrrell\r\nwould have been content to stay there for ever, she told me, but she\r\nthought it too confined a range for Eleonora; there was no formation\r\nof character, though I don\'t see how it could have formed better;\r\nbut Lady Tyrrell is a thoroughly careful motherly sister, and\r\nthought it right she should see a little of the world.  So they\r\nbroke up from Rockpier, and spent a year abroad; and now Lady\r\nTyrrell is making great sacrifices to enable her father to come and\r\nlive at home again.  I must say it would be more neighbourly to\r\nwelcome them a little more kindly!"\r\n\r\n"I should think such agreeable people were sure to win their way."\r\n\r\n"Ah! you don\'t know how impervious our style of old squire and\r\nsquiress can be!  If even mother is not superior to the old\r\nprejudice, who will be?  And it is _very_ hard on a fellow; for\r\nthree parts of my time is taken up by this eternal cramming--I\r\nshould have no heart for it but for her--and I can\'t be going over\r\nto Sirenwood as I used to go to Rockpier, while my mother vexes\r\nherself about it, in her state.  If she were up and about I should\r\nnot mind, or she would know better; but what can they--Lenore, I\r\nmean--think of me, but that I am as bad as the rest?"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that anything has passed between you?"\r\n\r\n"No, not with Lenore.  Her sister spoke to me, and said it was not\r\nright when she had seen nothing but Rockpier; but she as good as\r\npromised to stand my friend.  And when I get to the office, in two\r\nyears, I shall have quite enough to begin upon, with what my mother\r\nallows us."\r\n\r\n"Then you hope she will wait for that?"\r\n\r\n"I feel sure of it--that is, if she is not annoyed by this\r\nabominable usage from my family.  Oh! Rosamond, you will help us\r\nwhen you get into your own house, and you will get Julius to see it\r\nin a proper light.  Mother trusts to him almost as much as to\r\nRaymond; but it is our misfortune to be so much younger that she\r\ncan\'t believe us grown up."\r\n\r\n"O, Frank," said Charlie, coming in, "here\'s Price come up about the\r\npuppies.--What, Rosamond, has he got hold of you?  What a blessing\r\nfor me! but I pity you."\r\n\r\nFrank and Charlie went off together; and Julius was in the act of\r\nbegging Cecil to illuminate a notice of the services, to be framed\r\nand put into the church porch, when Raymond came in from the other\r\nroom to make up a whist-table for his mother.  Rosamond gladly\r\nresponded; but there was a slight accent of contempt in Cecil\'s\r\nvoice, as she replied, "I never played a game at cards in my life."\r\n\r\n"They are a great resource to my mother," said Raymond.  "Anne, you\r\nare too tired to play?--No, Julius, the pack is not there; look in\r\nthe drawer of the chiffonier."\r\n\r\nJulius handed the list he had been jotting down to Cecil, and\r\nfollowed his brother, with his hands full of cards, unconscious of\r\nthe expression of dismay, almost horror, with which Anne was gazing\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\n"Oh! let us be resolute!" she cried, as soon as the door was shut.\r\n"Do not let us touch the evil thing!"\r\n\r\n"Cards?" said Cecil.  "If Mrs. Poynsett cannot be amused without\r\nthem, I suppose we shall have to learn.  I always heard she was such\r\nan intellectual woman."\r\n\r\n"But we ought to resist sin, however painful it may be," said Anne,\r\ngathering strength; "nay, even if a minister sets the example of\r\ndefection."\r\n\r\n"You think it wicked," said Cecil.  "Oh no, it is stupid and silly,\r\nand an absurd waste of time, but no more."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is," said Anne.  "Cards are the bane of thousands."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, gambling and all that; but to play in the evening to amuse\r\nan invalid can have no harm in it."\r\n\r\n"An invalid and aged woman ought to have her mind set upon better\r\nthings," said Anne.  "I shall not withdraw my testimony, and I hope\r\nyou will not."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Cecil.  "You see I am expected to attend to\r\nMrs. Poynsett; and I have seen whist at Dunstone when any dull old\r\nperson came there.  What a troublesome crooked hand Julius writes--\r\njust like Greek!  What\'s all this?  So many services--four on\r\nSunday, two every day, three on Wednesdays and Fridays!  We never\r\nhad anything like this at Dunstone."\r\n\r\n"It is very superstitious," said Anne.\r\n\r\n"Very superfluous, I should say," amended Cecil.  "I am sure my\r\nfather would consent to nothing of the kind.  I shall speak to\r\nRaymond about it."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Anne; "it does seem terrible that a minister should try\r\nto make up for worldly amusements by a quantity of vain ceremonies."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would not call him a minister, it sounds like a\r\ndissenter."\r\n\r\n"I think ministers their best name, except pastors."\r\n\r\n"Both are horrid alike," said Cecil.  "I shall teach all the people\r\nto call Julius the Rector.  That\'s better than Mr. Charnock--what\r\nRaymond ought to be."\r\n\r\nAnne was struck dumb at this fearful display of worldliness; and\r\nCecil betook herself to the piano, but the moment her husband\r\nappeared she showed him the list.\r\n\r\n"He has cut out plenty of work," said Raymond, "but three of them\r\nmust want a field for their energies."\r\n\r\n"It is preposterous.  I want you to speak to him about it."\r\n\r\n"You are not expected to go to them all," Raymond made answer.\r\n\r\n"Then there\'s no sense in having them," responded Cecil.  "Evening\r\nservices are very bad for the people, bringing them out late.  You\r\nought to tell him so."\r\n\r\n"He is Rector, and I am not," said Raymond.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Venn did nothing without papa\'s consent," exclaimed\r\n\r\n"My dear Cecil, don\'t let your loyalty make a Harry the Eighth of\r\nyour father," said Raymond; "the clergyman ought to be a free\r\nagent."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t approve?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t approve or disapprove.  It is not a matter I know anything\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"But I assure you it has been all thought over at Dunstone."\r\n\r\n"Come, my mother wants to go to bed, and you are keeping her\r\nwaiting."\r\n\r\nCecil was silenced for the moment, but not daunted; for was it not\r\nthe foremost duty of the lady of the manor to keep the clergyman in\r\norder, more especially when he was her own husband\'s younger\r\nbrother? so she met her brother-in-law with "Julius, when I\r\nundertook that notice, I had no notion you were going to have so\r\nmany services."\r\n\r\n"Is there more than you have time to paint?  Then Bindon can do it,\r\nor Jenny Bowater."\r\n\r\n"No! it is not time or trouble; but I do not think such a number of\r\nservices desirable."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said he, looking amused.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  An over number of services frequented by no one only brings\r\nthe Church into contempt.  I heard papa say so.  We only had regular\r\nSunday and Saint\'s Day services, and I am sure Dunstone was quite as\r\nreligious a place as there is any need to be."\r\n\r\n"I am glad to hear it," said Julius, an odd look flickering about\r\nhis face; "but as I am afraid Compton is not as religious a place as\r\nthere is need to be, I must try, by your leave, all means of making\r\nit so.  Good night."\r\n\r\nHe was gone, and Cecil was not sure that he had not presumed to\r\nlaugh at her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nA Sunday of Excitement\r\n\r\n\r\nStrangers in court do take her for the queen.--Shakespeare\r\n\r\nThe first Sunday of Julius Charnock\'s ministry was spent in an\r\nunexpected manner.  In the darkness of the autumn morning there was\r\na knock at the door, and a low hurried call in Anne\'s voice at the\r\nbedroom door:  "Rosamond!  Julius, pray look out!  Isn\'t there a\r\ngreat fire somewhere?"\r\n\r\n"Fire!  Here?" cried Rosamond, springing up.\r\n\r\n"No, not here.  A great way off.  You could beat it back."\r\n\r\nRosamond had by this time rushed to the window which looked out the\r\nwrong way, found her dressing-gown, and scrambled into it in the\r\ndark ere joining Anne in the gallery, from the end window of which\r\nthe lurid light in the sky, with an occasional flame leaping up, was\r\nplainly visible.  When Julius joined them he declared it to be at\r\nWillansborough, and set off to call up the coachman and despatch the\r\nfire-engine, his wife calling after him to send for the soldiers at\r\nBacksworth.\r\n\r\nFrank and Charlie came rushing down in gratified excitement,\r\ndeclaring that it was tremendous--the church at least--and exulting\r\nin the attainment of their life-long ambition, the riding out on the\r\nfire-engine.  Servants bustled about, exclaiming, tramping, or\r\nwhisking on the stairs; and Raymond presently appeared to ask\r\nwhether his mother were ill, and, when reassured on that score,\r\nhurrying to ascertain whether she were alarmed, before he started\r\nfor the scene of action.\r\n\r\n"Let me come and stay with her," said Rosamond, a striking figure,\r\nin a scarlet dressing-gown, with a thick plait of black hair hanging\r\ndown to her waist on either side.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, it will be very kind," said Raymond, running down before\r\nher, and meeting Susan waddling out in a fringe of curl-papers, for\r\nsome mysterious instinct or echo had conveyed to her and her\r\nmistress that there was fire somewhere--perhaps at home.  Mrs.\r\nPoynsett was not a nervous woman, and from the time she saw her\r\neldest son come in, all fright was over, and she could have borne to\r\nhear that the house over her head was burning, in the perfect trust\r\nthat he would save her from all peril; nor had he any difficulty in\r\ncommitting her to Rosamond, when he hurried away to finish dressing\r\nand repair to the spot.\r\n\r\nNothing could be seen from her room, but the little ante-room\r\nbetween it and the drawing-room had an excellent view, as the ground\r\nfell away from it, and there was an opening among the trees.\r\n\r\n"We must get you there!" exclaimed Rosamond, in her excitement,\r\nhelping her into some garments, and then running out as she heard a\r\nstep--"Here, Julius, help me;" and without more ado, the mother was\r\ntransported between them to the broad low couch under the window,\r\nand there bestowed in a nest of pillows, shawls, and rugs, that\r\nseemed to grow up under Rosamond\'s touch.\r\n\r\nThen following Julius out into the hall as he met his brother,\r\nRosamond clung to him, entreating, "Please, please don\'t run into\r\nany dangerous places."\r\n\r\n"Never fear, dearest; I am not likely."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let him, pray!" she said, turning to Raymond.  "Make him\r\nremember how blind he is."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take good care of him, Rosamond," said the elder brother\r\nkindly; "I\'m used to it."\r\n\r\n"And send for the ---th," she added.  "There is nothing like\r\nsoldiers at a fire."\r\n\r\n"The glare must have given notice," said Julius, "but we\'ll send if\r\nneedful.  Let go, you foolish girl; I\'m not leading a forlorn hope."\r\n\r\nDid Raymond, as he mounted his horse, turning from the contact of\r\nthe white and black heads, admire the reasonableness of the Cecil\r\nwho had never shown any fears for his safety, nor any tendency to\r\nrun about the passages in her robe de chambre, though she was now\r\ndressing with all speed?\r\n\r\nThe women-folk had to depend on their own eyes for intelligence, for\r\nevery male, not only of the household but of the village, between\r\nthe ages of five and seventy, started for Wil\'sbro\', and a good many\r\nfemales followed their example, including the cook and her suite.\r\n\r\nHowever, Susan remained, to find her mistress flown, and in her\r\nfright, give Lady Rosamond as round a scolding as if she had been\r\nCharlie, for her rashness in attempting a transit, which Dr. Hayter\r\nhad pronounced to be as much as her mistress\'s life was worth.\r\nHaving thus relieved her mind, and finding that Mrs. Poynsett was\r\nreally very comfortable, or else too eager and anxious to find out\r\nif she was not, the good woman applied herself to the making of\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nAnne and Cecil had found their way to the leads, and were thence\r\nsummoned to partake of this hasty meal, after which they proposed\r\ngoing to look from the brow of the hill; and Mrs. Poynsett insisted\r\nthat Rosamond should not stay behind on her account; and, glad to\r\nappease the restlessness of anxiety, out went the ladies, to find\r\nthe best view of the town,--usually a white object in the distance,\r\nbut now blurred by smoke thick and black in the daylight, and now\r\nand then reddened by bursts of flame.\r\n\r\nAnne had been reassured as to the need of beating out the fire and\r\ntrampling down a place to isolate it, as in the bush-fires of her\r\nexperience; and Rosamond related the achievements of the regiment in\r\nquenching many a conflagration in inflammable colonial cities.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to her that the best place whence to see it was the\r\ntower of the church, which, placed upon a little knoll, was standing\r\nout in full relief against the lurid light.  She found the key at\r\nthe sexton\'s, and led the way up the broken stone stair to the trap-\r\ndoor, where they emerged on the leads, and, in spite of the cold\r\nwind and furious flapping of the flag above their heads, stood\r\nabsorbed in the interest of the sight.\r\n\r\nThere was a black mass in the open space, whence rose fitful clouds\r\nof smoke, the remnants of the fire, which had there done its worst;\r\nand beyond was a smoky undefined outline, with tongues of flame\r\ndarting up, then volumes of dense white smoke, denoting a rush of\r\nwater from the engines.  Black beings flitted about like ants round\r\na disturbed nest; Rosamond hoped she detected some scarlet among\r\nthem, and Cecil lamented over not having brought her opera-glass.\r\nEven without this, it was possible to make out two long lines of men\r\nbetween the fire and the river, and at times they fancied they heard\r\nthe shouting, but the wind generally carried it away.  The cold was\r\nbitter, and they had to hold together and keep a tight grip upon\r\ntheir garments against the gusts that seemed to rock the tower; but\r\nthey could not bear to turn away, though the clock beneath pealed\r\nout hour after hour; for still, as the flames were subdued in one\r\nplace they broke out in another; but gradually smoke became\r\npredominant, and then grew thinner, and as some of the black specks\r\nbegan to straggle into the road as if returning to Compton, the\r\ndesire to hear became more pressing than that to see, and the three\r\nladies began to descend--a slow and weary process, cutting them off\r\nfrom the view, and lasting so long, that the road was no longer\r\ndeserted when they finally emerged into the churchyard.\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Bowater, grimed, dusty, hatless, and his hair on end, and\r\nRollo following with his feathery tail singed, hurried up at once.\r\n"I\'m not fit to touch, Lady Rosamond," as he showed a black hand,\r\nand bowed to the others.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Ju--where\'s my husband?" exclaimed Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Just behind, riding home with Raymond and the rest of them.  Wasn\'t\r\nit a magnificent flare-up?  But there was no loss of life; and this\r\ndog was of as much use as two men--carried whatever I told him."\r\n\r\n"Good old man!  You\'ve suffered too!" said Rosamond.  "Pah! you\'re\r\nlike a singed horse; but never mind, you\'re a hero."\r\n\r\n"And where is Mr. Charnock Poynsett?" said Cecil, retreating from\r\nthe dog, which her sisters-in-law were vehemently patting.\r\n\r\n"He was arranging with the mayor.  Church, paper-mills, and town-\r\nhall got the worst of it.  It was well he came down; old Briggs, the\r\nmayor, lost his head, and Fuller never had one.  Every one gave\r\ncontrary orders till he came down, and then, didn\'t we work!"\r\n\r\nThe curate stretched his stalwart limbs, as if they were becoming\r\nsensible of the strain they had undergone.\r\n\r\n"Did you say the church was burnt?" asked Cecil.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and a very good thing too!  Hideous place, where you couldn\'t\r\ndo right if you died for it!  The fire began there--stoves no doubt--\r\nand there it would have stopped if any one had had any sense; but\r\nthere they would run and gape, and the more I tried to get them to\r\nform a chain and drench the warehouses, the more they wouldn\'t do\r\nit.  And when the flame once got hold of the paper--did you see it?--\r\nit was not a thing to forget.  I verily believe the whole town\r\nwould have gone if the Charnocks hadn\'t come and got a little\r\ndiscipline into the asses.  It was just life and death work,\r\nfighting the fire to hinder it from getting across Water Lane, and\r\nthen it would have been all up with High Street.  The tongues broke\r\nout like live things ready to lick up everything; and it was like\r\nkilling dragons to go at them with the hose and buckets.  I declare\r\nmy arms are fit to drop out of their sockets.  And the Rector\r\ndevoted himself to carrying out bed-ridden old women.  I forgot to\r\ntell you, Lady Rosamond, he has broken his--There now, I never meant\r\nto frighten you--broken his spectacles."\r\n\r\n"You did it on purpose," she said, laughing at her own start.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, I did not."\r\n\r\n"And is it quite out now?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; when the Backsworth engines and the soldiers came up, it was\r\nlike the Prussians at Waterloo."\r\n\r\n"Oh, then it was done," said Rosamond.  "Take care! my grandfather\r\nwas in the Light Division."\r\n\r\n"And my uncle in the Guards," said the curate.  But before the\r\nWaterloo controversy could be pursued, four or five figures on\r\nhorseback came round the knoll, and Raymond and Julius sprang off\r\ntheir horses, introducing the three officers who followed their\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nOne was Rosamond\'s old acquaintance, the Colonel, a friend of her\r\nfather; but she had little attention to spare for them till she had\r\nsurveyed her husband, who looked nothing worse than exceedingly\r\ndusty, and at fault without his spectacles.\r\n\r\nInquiries were made for Frank and Charlie.  They were walking home.\r\nThey had worked gallantly.  The flames were extinguished, but the\r\nengines must go on playing on them for some time longer.  No lives\r\nlost, and very few casualties, but the paper-mills were entirely\r\ndestroyed, and about twenty tenements, so that great distress was to\r\nbe apprehended.\r\n\r\nSuch intelligence was being communicated as the party stood together\r\nin a group, when there was a light tinkling of bells, and two ladies\r\nin a light open carriage, drawn by two spirited ponies, dashed round\r\nthe knoll; and at the moment something must have gone wrong with\r\nthem, for there was a start, a pull, a call of "Raymond!  Raymond!"\r\n\r\nThrowing his bridle to Herbert Bowater, he sprang to the horses\'\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Poynsett!  Thank you!  I beg your pardon," said the lady,\r\nrecovering herself; and Rosamond instantly perceived that she must\r\nbe Lady Tyrrell, for she was young-looking, very handsome, and in\r\nslight mourning; and her companion was Miss Vivian.  Julius, holding\r\nhis surviving glass to his eye, likewise stepped forward.  "Thank\r\nyou, it was so stupid," the lady ran on.  "Is not there something\r\nwrong with the traces?  I don\'t know how they got themselves\r\nharnessed, but there was no keeping at home."\r\n\r\n"I think all is right," said Raymond, gravely, making the\r\nexamination over to a servant.  "Let me introduce my wife, Lady\r\nTyrrell."\r\n\r\nThe lady held out her hand.  "I hope we shall be excellent\r\nneighbours.--My sister.--You remember little Lena," she added to the\r\nbrothers.  "She stole a march on us, I find.  I heard of your\r\nencounter on Friday.  It was too bad of you not to come in and let\r\nus send you home; I hope you did not get very wet, Lady Rosamond.--\r\nAh!  Mr. Strangeways, I did not know you were there," she proceeded,\r\nas the youngest of the officers accosted her; "come over and see us.\r\nYou\'re better provided now; but come to luncheon any day.  I am sure\r\nto be at home at half-past one; and I want so much to hear of your\r\nmother and sisters."  And with a universal bow and smile she\r\nnourished her whip, her ponies jangled their bells, and the ladies\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n"Stunning pair that!" was young Strangeways\' exclamation.\r\n\r\n"Most beautiful!" murmured Cecil, in a low voice, as if she was\r\nquite dazzled.  "You never said she was like that," she added\r\nreproachfully to Julius.\r\n\r\n"Our encounter was in the dark," he answered.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I did not mean the young one, but Lady Tyrrell.  She is just\r\nlike a gem we saw at Firenze--which was it?"\r\n\r\n"Where?" said Raymond, bewildered.\r\n\r\n"Firenze--Florence," she said, deigning to translate; and finding\r\nher own reply.  "Ah, yes, the Medusa!" then, as more than one\r\nexclaimed in indignant dismay, she said, "No, not the Gorgon, but\r\nthe beautiful winged head, with only two serpents on the brow and\r\none coiled round the neck, and the pensive melancholy face."\r\n\r\n"I know," said Julius, shortly; while the other gentlemen entered\r\ninto an argument, some defending the beauty of the younger sister,\r\nsome of the elder; and it lasted till they entered the park, where\r\nall were glad to partake of their well-earned meal, most of the\r\ngentlemen having been at work since dawn without sustenance, except\r\na pull at the beer served out to the firemen.\r\n\r\nCecil was not at all shy, and was pleased to take her place as\r\nrepresentative lady of the house; but somehow, though every one was\r\ncivil and attentive to her, she found herself effaced by the more\r\nfull-blown Rosamond, accustomed to the same world as the guests; and\r\nshe could not help feeling the same sense of depression as when she\r\nhad to yield the head of her father\'s table to her step-mother.\r\n\r\nNor could she have that going to church for the first time in state\r\nwith her bridegroom she had professed to dread, but had really\r\nanticipated with complacency; for though Julius had bidden the bells\r\nto be rung for afternoon service, Raymond was obliged to go back to\r\nWil\'sbro\' to make arrangements for the burnt-out families, and she\r\nhad to go as lonely as Anne herself.\r\n\r\nLady Tyrrell and her sister were both at Compton Church, and\r\novertook the three sisters-in-law as they were waiting to be joined\r\nby the Rector.\r\n\r\n"We shall have to take shelter with you," said Lady Tyrrell, "poor\r\nburnt-out beings that we are."\r\n\r\n"Do you belong to Wil\'sbro\'?" said Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Yes; St. Nicholas is an immense straggling parish, going four miles\r\nalong the river.  I don\'t know how we shall ever be able to go back\r\nagain to poor old Mr. Fuller.  You\'ll never get rid of us from\r\nCompton."\r\n\r\n"I suppose they will set about rebuilding the church at once," said\r\nCecil.  "Of course they will form a committee, and put my husband on\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"In the chair, no doubt," said Lady Tyrrell, in a tone that sounded\r\nto Rosamond sarcastic, but which evidently gratified Cecil.  "But we\r\nwill have a committee of our own, and you will have to preside, and\r\npatronize our bazaar.  Of course you know all about them."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes!" said Cecil, eagerly.  "We have one every year for the\r\nInfirmary, only my father did not approve of my selling at a stall."\r\n\r\n"Ah! quite right then, but you are a married woman now, and that is\r\nquite a different thing.  The stall of the three brides.  What an\r\nattraction!  I shall come and talk about it when I make my call in\r\nfull form!  Good-bye again."\r\n\r\nCecil\'s balance was more than restored by this entire recognition to\r\nbe prime lady-patroness of everything.  To add to her satisfaction,\r\nwhen her husband came home to dinner, bringing with him both the\r\ncurates, she found there was to be a meeting on Tuesday in the\r\nAssembly-room, of both sexes, to consider of the relief of the work-\r\npeople, and that he would be glad to take her to it.  Moreover, as\r\nit was to be strictly local, Rosamond was not needed there, though\r\nRaymond was not equally clear as to the Rector, since he believed\r\nthat the St. Nicholas parishioners meant to ask the loan of Compton\r\nPoynsett Church for one service on a Sunday.\r\n\r\n"Then I shall keep out of the way," said Julius.  "I do not want to\r\nhave the request made to me in public."\r\n\r\n"You do not mean to refuse?" said Cecil, with a sort of self-\r\nidentification with her constituents.\r\n\r\n"The people are welcome to attend as many of our services as they\r\nlike; but there is no hour that I could give the church up to Mr.\r\nFuller on a Sunday."\r\n\r\n"Nor would the use of St. Nicholas be very edifying for our people,"\r\nadded Mr. Bindon.\r\n\r\nHis junior clenched it by saying with a laugh, "I should think not!\r\nFancy old Fuller\'s rusty black gown up in our pulpit!"\r\n\r\n"I rejoice to say that is burnt," rejoined Mr. Bindon.\r\n\r\n"What bet will you take that a new one will be the first thing\r\nsubscribed for?" said the deacon, bringing a certain grave look on\r\nthe faces of both the elder clergy, and a horror-stricken one upon\r\nAnne\'s; while Cecil pronounced her inevitable dictum, that at\r\nDunstone Mr. Venn always preached in a gown, and "we" should never\r\nlet him think of anything nonsensical.\r\n\r\nRosamond was provoked into a display of her solitary bit of\r\necclesiastical knowledge--"A friar\'s gown, the most Popish vestment\r\nin the church."\r\n\r\nCecil, thoroughly angered, flushed up to the eyes and bit her lips,\r\nunable to find a reply, while all the gentlemen laughed.  Frank\r\nasked if it were really so, and Mr. Bindon made the well-known\r\nexplanation that the Geneva gown was neither more nor less than the\r\nmonk\'s frock.\r\n\r\n"I shall write and ask Mr. Venn," gasped Cecil; but her husband\r\nstifled the sound by saying, "I saw little Pettitt, Julius, this\r\nafternoon, overwhelmed with gratitude to you for all the care you\r\ntook of his old mother, and all his waxen busts."\r\n\r\n"Ah! by the bye!" said Charlie, "I did meet the Rector staggering\r\nout, with the fascinating lady with the long eyelashes in one arm,\r\nand the moustached hero in the other."\r\n\r\n"There was no pacifying the old lady without," said Julius.  "I had\r\njust coaxed her to the door, when she fell to wringing her hands.\r\nAh! those lovely models, that were worth thirty shillings each, with\r\nnatural hair--that they should be destroyed!  If the heat or the\r\nwater did but come near them, Adolphus would never get over it.  I\r\ncould only pacify her by promising to go back for these idols of his\r\nheart as soon as she was safe; and after all, I had to dash at them\r\nthrough the glass, and that was the end of my spectacles."\r\n\r\n"Where was Pettitt himself?"\r\n\r\n"Well employed, poor little fellow, saving the people in those three\r\ncottages of his.  No one supposed his shop in danger, but the fire\r\ntook a sudden freak and came down Long Street; and though the house\r\nis standing, it had to be emptied and deluged with water to save it.\r\nI never knew Pettitt had a mother till I found her mounting guard,\r\nlike one distracted, over her son\'s bottles of perfumery."\r\n\r\n"And dyes?" murmured Raymond under his breath; but Frank caught the\r\nsound, and said, "Ah, Julius! don\'t I remember his inveigling you\r\ninto coming out with scarlet hair?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I\'ve seen him since," said Julius, laughing.  "I\r\nbelieve he couldn\'t resist such an opportunity of practising his\r\nart.  And for my part, I must say for myself, that it was in our\r\nfirst holidays, and Raymond and Miles had been black and blue the\r\nwhole half-year from having fought my battles whenever I was called\r\neither \'Bunny\' or \'Grandfather.\'  So when he assured me he could\r\nturn my hair to as sweet a raven-black as Master Poynsett\'s, I\r\nthought it would be pleasing to all, forgetting that he could not\r\ndye my eyes, and that their effect would have been some degrees more\r\ncomical."\r\n\r\n"For shame, Julius!" said Rosamond.  "Don\'t you know that one\r\nafternoon, when Nora had cried for forty minutes over her sum, she\r\ndeclared that she wanted to make her eyes as beautiful as Mr.\r\nCharnock\'s.  Well, what was the effect?"\r\n\r\n"Startling," said Raymond.  "He came down in shades of every kind of\r\ncrimson and scarlet.  A fearful object, with his pink-and-white face\r\nglowing under it."\r\n\r\n"And what I had to undergo from Susan!" added Julius.  "She washed\r\nme, and soaped me, and rubbed me, till I felt as if all the\r\nthreshing-machines in the county were about my head, lecturing me\r\nall the time on the profanity of flying against Scripture by trying\r\nto alter one\'s hair from what Providence had made it.  Nothing would\r\ndo; her soap only turned it into shades of lemon and primrose.  I\r\nwas fain to let her shave my head as if I had a brain fever; and I\r\nwas so horribly ashamed for years after, that I don\'t think I have\r\nset foot in Long Street since till to-day."\r\n\r\n"Pettitt is a queer little fellow," said Herbert.  "The most\r\ntruculent little Radical to hear him talk, and yet staunch in his\r\nvotes, for he can\'t go against those whose hair he has cut off from\r\ntime immemorial."\r\n\r\n"I hope he has not lost much," said Julius.\r\n\r\n"His tenements are down, but they were insured; and as to his stock,\r\nhe says he owes its safety entirely to you, Julius.  I think he\r\nwould present you with both his models as a testimonial, if you\r\ncould only take them," said Raymond.\r\n\r\nCecil had neither spoken nor laughed through all this.  She was\r\nnursing her wrath; and after marching out of the dining-room, lay in\r\nwait to intercept her husband, and when she had claimed his\r\nattention, began, "Rosamond ought not to be allowed to say such\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"What things?"\r\n\r\n"Speaking in that improper way about a gown."\r\n\r\n"She seems to have said what was the fact."\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be!  It is preposterous!  I never heard it before."\r\n\r\n"Nor I; but Bindon evidently is up in those matters."\r\n\r\n"It was only to support Rosamond; and I am quite sure she said it\r\nout of mere opposition to me.  You ought to speak to Julius."\r\n\r\n"About what?" said Raymond.\r\n\r\n"Her laughing whenever I mention Dunstone, and tell them the proper\r\nway of doing things."\r\n\r\n"There may be different opinions about the proper way of doing\r\nthings."  Then as she opened her eyes in wonder and rebuke, he\r\ncontinued, in his elder-brotherly tone of kindness, "You know I told\r\nyou already that you had better not interfere in matters concerning\r\nhis church and parish."\r\n\r\n"We always managed things at Dunstone."\r\n\r\nHang Dunstone! was with some difficulty suppressed; but in an extra\r\ngentle voice Raymond said, "Your father did what he thought his\r\nduty, but I do not think it mine, nor yours, to direct Julius in\r\nclerical matters.  It can only lead to disputes, and I will not have\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"It is Rosamond.  I\'m sure I don\'t dispute."\r\n\r\n"Listen, Cecil!" he said.  "I can see that your position may be\r\ntrying, in these close quarters with a younger brother\'s wife with\r\nmore age and rank than yourself."\r\n\r\n"That is nothing.  An Irish earl, and a Charnock of Dunstone!"\r\n\r\n"Dunstone will be more respected if you keep it in the background,"\r\nhe said, holding in stronger words with great difficulty.  "Once for\r\nall, you have your own place and duties, and Rosamond has hers.  If\r\nyou meddle in them, nothing but annoyance can come of it; and\r\nremember, I cannot be appealed to in questions between you and her.\r\nJulius and I have gone on these nine-and-twenty years without a\r\ncloud between us, and I\'m sure you would not wish to bring one now."\r\n\r\nWherewith he left her bewildered.  She did not perceive that he was\r\ntoo impartial for a lover, but she had a general sense that she had\r\ncome into a rebellious world, where Dunstone and Dunstone\'s daughter\r\nwere of no account, and her most cherished notions disputed.  What\r\nwas the lady of the manor to do but to superintend the church,\r\nparsonage, and parish generally?  Not her duty?  She had never heard\r\nof such a thing, nor did she credit it.  Papa would come home, make\r\nthese degenerate Charnocks hear reason, and set all to rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nWedding Visits\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung Mrs. Charnock Poynsett had plenty of elasticity, and her\r\nrebuffs were less present to her mind in the morning than to that of\r\nher husband, who had been really concerned to have to inflict an\r\nexpostulation; and he was doubly kind, almost deferential, giving\r\nthe admiration and attention he felt incumbent on him to the\r\ntasteful arrangements of her wedding presents in her own sitting-\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"And this clock I am going to have in the drawing-room, and these\r\nSalviati glasses.  Then, when I have moved out the piano, I shall\r\nput the sofa in its place, and my own little table, with my pretty\r\nFlorentine ornaments."\r\n\r\nRaymond again looked annoyed.  "Have you spoken to my mother?" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"No; she never goes there."\r\n\r\n"Not now, but if ever she can bear any move it will be her first\r\nchange, and I should not like to interfere with her arrangements."\r\n\r\n"She could never have been a musician, to let the piano stand\r\nagainst the wall.  I shall never be able to play."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps that might be contrived," said Raymond, kindly.  "_Here_\r\nyou know is your own domain, where you can do as you please."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but I am expected to play in the evening.  Look at all those\r\nthings.  I had kept the choicest for the drawing-room, and it is\r\nsuch a pity to hide them all up here."\r\n\r\nRaymond felt for the mortification, and was unwilling to cross her\r\nagain, so he said, "I will ask whether my mother would object to\r\nhaving the piano moved."\r\n\r\n"This morning?"\r\n\r\n"After eleven o\'clock--I never disturb her sooner; but you shall\r\nhear before I go to Backsworth."\r\n\r\n"An hour lost," thought Cecil; but she was too well bred to grumble,\r\nand she had her great work to carry on of copying and illustrating\r\nher journal.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett readily consented.  "Oh yes, my dear, let her do\r\nwhatever she likes.  Don\'t let me be a bugbear.  A girl is never at\r\nhome till she has had her will of the furniture.  I think she will\r\nfind that moving out the piano betrays the fading of the rest of the\r\npaper, but that is her affair.  She is free to do just as she likes.\r\nI dare say the place does look antediluvian to young eyes."\r\n\r\nSo Raymond was the bearer of his mother\'s full permission; and Cecil\r\npresided with great energy over the alterations, which she carried\r\nout by the aid of the younger servants, to the great disgust of\r\ntheir seniors.  She expected the acclamations of her contemporaries;\r\nbut it happened that the first of them to cross the room was Julius,\r\non his way to his mother\'s room after luncheon, and he, having on a\r\npair of make-shift glasses, till the right kind could be procured\r\nfrom London, was unprepared for obstacles in familiar regions,\r\nstumbled over an ottoman, and upset a table with the breakage of a\r\nvase.\r\n\r\nHe apologized, with much regret; but the younger brothers made an\r\noutcry.  "What has come to the place?  Here\'s the table all over\r\neverything!"\r\n\r\n"And where are the bronzes?"\r\n\r\n"And the humming-birds?  Miles\'s birds, that he brought home after\r\nhis first voyage."\r\n\r\n"And the clock with the two jolly little Cupids?  Don\'t you remember\r\nMiles and Will Bowater dressing them up for men-of-war\'s men?\r\nMother could not bring herself to have them undressed for a year,\r\nand all the time the clock struck nohow!"\r\n\r\n"This is an anatomical study instead of a clock," lamented Frank.\r\n"I say, Cecil, do you like your friends to sit in their bones, like\r\nSydney Smith?"\r\n\r\n"I never saw such a stupid old set of conservatives!" broke in\r\nRosamond, feeling for Cecil\'s mortification.  "In an unprejudiced\r\neye the room looks infinitely better, quite revivified!  You ought\r\nto be much obliged to Cecil for letting you see all her beautiful\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you favour us with yours?" said Charlie.\r\n\r\n"I know better!  Mine aren\'t fit to wipe the shoes of Cecil\'s!  When\r\nI get into the Rectory you\'ll see how hideous they are!" said\r\nRosamond, with the merriest complacency.  "Couvre-pieds to set your\r\nteeth on edge, from the non-commissioned officers\' wives; and the\r\nawfullest banner-screen you ever saw, worked by the drum-major\'s own\r\nhands, with Her Majesty\'s arms on one side, and the De Courcy ones\r\non the other, and glass eyes like stuffed birds\' to the lion and\r\nunicorn.  We nearly expired from suppressed laughter under the\r\npresentation."\r\n\r\nThen she went round, extorting from the lads admiration for Cecil\'s\r\nreally beautiful properties, and winning gratitude for her own\r\ncordial praise, though it was not the artistic appreciation they\r\ndeserved.  Indeed, Cecil yielded to the general vote for the\r\nrestoration of the humming-birds, allowing that, though she did not\r\nlike stuffed birds in a drawing-room, she would not have banished\r\nthem if she had known their history.\r\n\r\nThis lasted till Charlie spied a carriage coming up the drive, which\r\ncould be seen a long way off, so that there was the opportunity for\r\na general sauve qui peut.  Cecil represented that Rosamond ought to\r\nstay and receive her bridal visits; but she was unpersuadable.  "Oh\r\nno!  I leave all that for you!  My time will come when I get into\r\nthe Rectory.  We are going in the dog-cart to the other end of the\r\nparish.--What\'s its name--Squattlesea Marsh, Julius?"\r\n\r\n"Squattlesford!" said Charlie.  "If Julius means to drive you, look\r\nout for your neck!"\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s the other way, I\'m going to drive Julius!--Come along, or\r\nwe shall be caught!"\r\n\r\nCecil stood her ground, as did Anne, who was too weary and\r\nindifferent to retreat, and Frank, who had taken another view of the\r\ncarriage as it came nearer.\r\n\r\n"I must apologize for having brought nothing but my father\'s card,"\r\nsaid Lady Tyrrell, entering with her sister, and shaking hands:\r\n"there\'s no such thing as dragging him out for a morning call."\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Charnock Poynsett is not at home," replied Cecil.  "He\r\nfound so much county business waiting for him, that he had to go to\r\nBacksworth."\r\n\r\n"It is the better opportunity for a little private caucus with you,"\r\nreturned Lady Tyrrell, "before the meeting to-morrow.  I rather\r\nfancy the gentlemen have one of their own."\r\n\r\n"Some are to dine here to-night," said Cecil.\r\n\r\n"We ladies had better be prepared with our proposals," said Lady\r\nTyrrell.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Frank drew near Miss Vivian with a large book,\r\nsaying, "These are the photographs you wished to see."\r\n\r\nHe placed the book on the ottoman, and would thus have secured a\r\nsort of tete-a-tete; but Eleonora did not choose to leave Mrs Miles\r\nCharnock out, and handed her each photograph in turn, but could only\r\nelicit a cold languid "Thank you."  To Anne\'s untrained eye these\r\ntriumphs of architecture were only so many dull representations of\r\n\'Roman Catholic churches,\' and she would much rather have listened\r\nto the charitable plans of the other two ladies, for the houseless\r\nfactory women of Wil\'sbro\'.\r\n\r\nThe bazaar, Lady Tyrrell said, must be first started by the Member\'s\r\nwife; and there should be an innermost committee, of not more than\r\nthree, to dispose of stalls and make arrangements.\r\n\r\n"You must be one," said Cecil.  "I know no one yet."\r\n\r\n"You will, long before it comes off.  In fact, I am as great a\r\nstranger as yourself.  Ah! there\'s an opportunity!" as the bell\r\npealed.  "The Bowaters, very likely; I saw their Noah\'s ark as I\r\npassed the Poynsett Arms, with the horses taken out.  I wonder how\r\nmany are coming--worthy folks!"\r\n\r\nWhich evidently meant insufferable bores.\r\n\r\n"Is there not a daughter?" asked Cecil.\r\n\r\n"You need not use the singular, though, by the bye, most of them are\r\nmarried."\r\n\r\n"Oh, pray stay!" entreated Cecil, as there were signs of leave-\r\ntaking.\r\n\r\n"I should do you no good.  You\'ll soon learn that I am a sort of\r\nLoki among the Asagotter."\r\n\r\nCecil laughed, but had time to resume her somewhat prim dignity\r\nbefore the lengthened disembarkation was over, and after all,\r\nproduced only four persons; but then none were small--Mrs. Bowater\r\nwas a harsh matron, Mr. Bowater a big comely squire, the daughters\r\nboth tall, one with an honest open face much like Herbert\'s, only\r\nwith rather less youth and more intelligence, the other a bright\r\ndark glowing gipsy-faced young girl.\r\n\r\nEleonora Vivian, hitherto gravely stiff and reserved, to poor\r\nFrank\'s evident chagrin, at once flashed into animation, and met the\r\nelder Miss Bowater with outstretched hands, receiving a warm kiss.\r\nAt the same time Mr. Bowater despatched Frank to see whether his\r\nmother could admit a visitor; and Lady Tyrrell observed, "Ah!  I was\r\nabout to make the same petition; but I will cede to older friends,\r\nfor so I suppose I must call you, Mr. Bowater--though my\r\nacquaintance is of long standing enough!"\r\n\r\nAnd she put on a most charming smile, which Mr. Bowater received\r\nwith something inarticulate that might be regarded as a polite form\r\nof \'fudge,\' which made Cecil think him a horribly rude old man, and\r\nevidently discomposed his wife very much.\r\n\r\nFrank brought back his mother\'s welcome to the Squire; but by this\r\ntime Eleonora and Miss Bowater had drawn together into a window, in\r\nso close and earnest a conversation that he could not break into it,\r\nand with almost visible reluctance began to talk to the younger\r\nsister, who on her side was desirous of joining in the bazaar\r\ndiscussion, which had been started again in full force; until there\r\nwas a fresh influx of visitors, when Lady Tyrrell decidedly took\r\nleave with her sister, and Frank escorted them to their carriage,\r\nand returned no more.\r\n\r\nIn the new shuffling of partners, the elder Miss Bowater found\r\nherself close to Anne, and at once inquired warmly for Miles, with\r\nknowledge and interest in naval affairs derived from a sailor\r\nbrother, Miles\'s chief friend and messmate in his training and\r\nearlier voyages.  There was something in Joanna Bowater\'s manner\r\nthat always unlocked hearts, and Anne was soon speaking without her\r\nfence of repellant stiffness and reserve.  Certainly Miles was loved\r\nby his mother and brothers more than he could be by an old\r\nplayfellow and sisterly friend, and yet there was something in\r\nJoanna\'s tone that gave Anne a sense of fellow-feeling, as if she\r\nhad met a countrywoman in this land of strangers; and she even told\r\nhow Miles had thought it right to send her home, thinking that she\r\nmight be a comfort to his mother.  "And not knowing all that was\r\ngoing to happen!" said poor Anne, with an irrepressible sigh, both\r\nfor her own blighted hopes, and for the whirl into which her sore\r\nheart had fallen.\r\n\r\n"I think you will be," said Joanna, brightly; "though it must be\r\nstrange coming on so many.  Dear Mrs. Poynsett is so kind!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Anne, coldly.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you don\'t know her yet.  And Lady Rosamond!  She is\r\ndelightful!"\r\n\r\n"Have you seen her!"\r\n\r\n"We met them just now in the village, but my brother is enchanted.\r\nAnd do you know what was Julius\'s first introduction to her?  It was\r\nat a great school-feast, where they had the regimental children as\r\nwell as the town ones.  A poor little boy went off in an epileptic\r\nfit, and Julius found her holding him, with her own hand in his\r\nmouth to hinder the locking of the teeth.  He said her fingers were\r\nbitten almost to the bone, but she made quite light of it."\r\n\r\n"That was nice!" said Anne; but then, with a startled glance, and in\r\nan undertone, she added, "Are they Christians?"\r\n\r\nJoanna Bowater paused for a moment between dismay and desire for\r\nconsideration, and in that moment her father called to her, "Jenny,\r\ndo you remember the dimensions of those cottages in Queckett\'s\r\nLane?" and she had to come and serve for his memory, while he was\r\nindoctrinating a younger squire with the duties of a landlord.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mrs. Bowater was, for the tenth time, consulting her old\r\nfriend upon Mrs. Hornblower\'s capabilities of taking care of\r\nHerbert, and betraying a little disappointment that his first sermon\r\nhad not yet been heard; and when his voice was complimented, she\r\nhoped Julius would spare it--too much exertion could not be good for\r\nso young a man, and though dear Herbert looked so strong, no one\r\nwould believe how much sleep he required.  Then she observed, "We\r\nfound Camilla Vivian--Lady Tyrrell I mean--calling.  Have you seen\r\nher?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Well, she really seems improved!"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bowater has been telling me she is handsomer than ever!"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes!  That\'s all gentlemen think of; but I meant in other ways.\r\nShe seems full of the rebuilding of St. Nicholas, and to be making\r\ngreat friends with your new daughter.  You don\'t think," lowering\r\nher voice, "that Raymond would have any objection to meeting her?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not!"\r\n\r\n"I did not suppose he would, but I thought I would just ask you.  It\r\nwould be rather marked not to invite him for the 3rd, you know; and\r\nJenny was always so fond of poor Emily, kept up a correspondence\r\nwith her to the last.  It was the first time she had met the little\r\none since they came back.  Not that she is little now, she is very\r\ntall and quite handsome _even_ by the side of Edith.  We just saw\r\nLady Rosamond--a sweet face--and Herbert perfectly raves about her!"\r\n\r\n"She is a most unselfish warm-hearted creature!" said Mrs. Poynsett.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad!  And Miles\'s wife, I hope she will come.  Poor thing,\r\nshe looks very poorly."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am very anxious about her.  If she is not better in a day or\r\ntwo, I shall insist on her having advice."\r\n\r\n"Poor dear, I don\'t wonder!  But she had better come to Strawyers;\r\nJenny will cheer her if any one can, and we shall have a nice lively\r\nparty, I hope!  She will only mope the more if she never goes out."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid she is hardly equal to it; besides, poor child," added\r\nMrs. Poynsett, "she seems to have been strictly brought up, and to\r\nthink our ways rather shocking; and Miles wrote to me not to press\r\nher to go into society till he comes home."\r\n\r\n"Ah! well, I call that a mistake!" puffed out good-humoured Mrs.\r\nBowater.  "Very bad for the poor girl\'s spirits.  By the bye, I hope\r\nJulius does not object to Herbert\'s dancing--not at a public ball,\r\nyou know, but at home--for if he did, I would try to arrange\r\nsomething else, it would be so hard for the poor boy to have to look\r\non."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, I don\'t think he could," said the mother,\r\nconsidering.\r\n\r\n"You see, we thought of a dinner-party for as many as possible.\r\nFrank and Charlie won\'t mind dining in the schoolroom, I know, and\r\nhaving the rest for a dance in the evening; but if Julius did think\r\nit unclerical--Jenny says he won\'t, and papa laughs, and says, \'Poh!\r\npoh!  Julius is no fool;\' but people are so much more particular\r\nthan they used to be, and I would not get the dear boy into a scrape\r\nfor the world."\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett undertook to ascertain his opinions on this knotty\r\npoint, and to let her know if they were adverse; and then she begged\r\nfor a visit from Jenny, whose brother had no accommodation for her\r\nin his lodgings.  She could not be spared till after the\r\nentertainment on the 3rd, nor till a visit from her married sister\r\nwas over; but afterwards, her mother was delighted that she should\r\ncome and look after Herbert, who seemed as much on the maternal mind\r\nas if he had not batted his way through Eton, and boated it through\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett obtained her word with Julius in good time that\r\nevening.  He laughed a little.  "Poor Herbs! when will people\r\nunderstand that it is the spirit of the thing, the pursuit, not the\r\nindividual chance participation in any particular amusement, that is\r\nunclerical, as they are pleased to call it?"\r\n\r\n"What do you think of Herbert?"\r\n\r\n"A boy, and a very nice boy; but if he doesn\'t get his healthful\r\nplay somehow, he will burst out like a closed boiler some day."\r\n\r\n"A muscular Christian on your hands?"\r\n\r\n"Not theoretically, for he has been well taught; but it\'s a great\r\nanimal that needs to work off its steam, and if I had known it, I\r\nwould not have undertaken the problem of letting him do that,\r\nwithout setting up bad habits, or scandalizing the parish and\r\nBindon--who is young the other way, and has no toleration.  We had\r\nthis morning\'s service in a state of siege from all the dogs.\r\nHerbert thought he had shut them safely up, but they were all at his\r\nheels in the churchyard; and though he rated them home, and shut all\r\nthe doors, we heard them whining and scratching at each in turn."\r\n\r\n"I thought I should have died of it," said Rosamond, entering.  "His\r\nface grew red enough to set his surplice on fire, and Mr. Bindon\r\nglared at him, and he missed his verse in the Psalm; for there was\r\nthe bull terrier, crouching and looking abject at the vestry-door,\r\njust restrained by his eye from coming further."\r\n\r\n"What shall you do about it, Julius?" asked his mother, much amused.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that will remedy itself.  All dogs learn to understand the\r\nbell."\r\n\r\nAnd then the others began to drop in, and were told of the\r\ninvitation that was coming.\r\n\r\n"I say, Rosamond," cried Charlie, "can brothers and sisters-in-law\r\ndance together?"\r\n\r\n"That depends on how the brothers-in-law dance," returned Rosamond.\r\n"Some one, for pity\'s sake, play a waltz!--Come along Charlie! the\r\nhall is a sweet place for it!--Whistle, Julius!--Frank, whistle!"\r\n\r\nAnd away she whirled.  Frank, holding out his hands, was to his\r\nsurprise accepted by Cecil, and disappeared with her into the hall.\r\nJulius stood by the mantelpiece, with the first shadow on his brow\r\nhis mother had seen since his arrival.  Presently he spoke in a\r\ndefensive apologetic tone:  "She has always been used to this style\r\nof thing."\r\n\r\n"Most naturally," said the mother.\r\n\r\n"Not that they ever did more than their position required, and Lady\r\nRathforlane is a truly careful mother.  Of course some things might\r\nstartle you stay-at-home people; but in all essentials--"\r\n\r\n"I see what you mean."\r\n\r\n"And what seems like rattle is habit."\r\n\r\n"Simple gaiete de coeur!"\r\n\r\n"So it is better to acquiesce till it subsides of itself.  You see\r\nit is hard, after such a life of change and variety, to settle down\r\ninto a country parsonage."\r\n\r\n"What are you saying there?" said Rosamond, tripping in out of\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n"That I don\'t know how you are to put up with a pink-eyed parson,\r\nand a hum-drum life," said Julius, holding out a caressing hand.\r\n\r\n"Now that\'s hard," pleaded she; "only because I took a frolic with\r\nBaby Charles!  I say, Julius, shall we give it up altogether and\r\nstay at home like good children?  I believe that is what would suit\r\nthe told Rabbit much better than his kid gloves,"--and her sweet\r\nface looked up at him with a meek candid gaze.\r\n\r\n"No," he said, "that would not do.  The Bowaters are our oldest\r\nfriends.  But, Rosie, as you _are_ a clergyman\'s wife, could you not\r\ngive up round dances?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, no!  That\'s too bad.  I\'d rather never go to a dance at all,\r\nthan sit still, or be elbowed about in the square dances.  You never\r\ntold me you expected that!"--and her tones were of a child petulant\r\nat injustice.\r\n\r\n"Suppose," he said, as a delightful solution, "you only gratified\r\nFrank and Charlie by waltzing with them."\r\n\r\nShe burst into a ringing laugh.  "My brothers-in-law!  How very\r\nridiculous!  Suppose you included the curates?"\r\n\r\n"You know what I mean," he said gravely.\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother the parson\'s wife!  Haven\'t I seen them figuring away by\r\nscores?  Did we ever have a regimental ball that they were not the\r\nkeenest after?"\r\n\r\n"So they get themselves talked of!" said Julius, as Anne\'s quiet\r\nentrance broke up the dialogue.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett had listened, glad there was no appeal to her,\r\nconscious that she did not understand the merits of the case, and\r\nwhile she doubted whether her eldest son had love enough, somewhat\r\nafraid lest his brother had not rather too much for the good of his\r\nlawful supremacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nUnfruitful Suggestions\r\n\r\n\r\n"Raymond!  Can you spare me a moment before you go into your\r\nmother\'s room?"\r\n\r\nIt was Rosamond who, to his surprise, as he was about to go down-\r\nstairs, met him and drew him into her apartment--his mother\'s own\r\ndressing-room, which he had not entered since the accident.\r\n\r\n"Is anything the matter?" he said, thinking that Julius might have\r\nspared him from complaints of Cecil.\r\n\r\n"Oh no! only one never can speak to you, and Julius told me that you\r\ncould tell me about Mrs. Poynsett.  I can\'t help thinking she could\r\nbe moved more than she is."  Then, as he was beginning to speak, "Do\r\nyou know that, the morning of the fire, I carried her with only one\r\nof the maids to the couch under the tent-room window?  Susan was\r\nfrightened out of her wits, but she was not a bit the worse for it."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that was excitement."\r\n\r\n"But if it did not hurt her then, why should it hurt her again?\r\nThere\'s old General M\'Kinnon, my father\'s old friend, who runs about\r\neverywhere in a wheeled-chair with a leg-rest; and I can\'t think why\r\nshe should not do the same."\r\n\r\nRaymond smiled kindly on her, but rather sadly; perhaps he was\r\nrecollecting his morning\'s talk about the occupancy of the drawing-\r\nroom.  "You know it is her spine," he said.\r\n\r\n"So it is with him.  His horse rolled over him at Sebastopol, and he\r\nhas never walked since.  I wanted to write to Mary M\'Kinnon; but\r\nJulius said I had better talk to you, because he was only at home\r\nfor a fortnight, when she was at the worst, and you knew more about\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Raymond, understanding more than the Irish tongue fully\r\nexpressed.  "I never saw a woman sit better than she did, and she\r\nlooked as young and light in the saddle as you could, till that day,\r\nwhen, after the rains, the bank where the bridle-path to Squattles\r\nEnd was built up, gave way with the horse\'s feet, and down she went\r\ntwenty feet, and was under the horse when Miles and I got down to\r\nher!  We brought her on a mattress to that room, not knowing whether\r\nshe were alive; and she has never moved out of it!  It was agony to\r\nher to be touched."\r\n\r\n"Yes but it can\'t be that now.  Was not that three years ago?"\r\n\r\n"Not so much.  Two and a half.  We had Hayter down to see her, and\r\nhe said perfect rest was the only chance for her."\r\n\r\n"And has not he seen her lately?"\r\n\r\n"He died last winter; and old Worth, who comes in once a week to\r\nlook at her, is not fit for more than a little watching and\r\nattention.  I dare say we all have learnt to acquiesce too much in\r\nher present state, and that more might be done.  You see she has\r\nnever had a lady\'s care, except now and then Jenny Bowater\'s."\r\n\r\n"I do feel sure she could bear more now," said Rosamond, eagerly.\r\n"It would be such a thing if she could only be moved about that\r\ndown-stairs floor."\r\n\r\n"And be with us at meals and in the evening," said Raymond, his face\r\nlightening up.  "Thank you, Rosamond!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll write to Mary M\'Kinnon to-morrow, to ask about the chair,"\r\ncried Rosamond; and Raymond, hearing the door-bell, hurried down, to\r\nfind his wife standing alone over the drawing-room fire, not very\r\ncomplacent.\r\n\r\n"Where have you been, Raymond?"\r\n\r\n"I was talking to Rosamond.  She has seen a chair on which it might\r\nbe possible to move my mother about on this floor."\r\n\r\n"I thought--" Cecil flushed.  She was on the point of saying she\r\nthought Rosamond was not to interfere in her department any more\r\nthan she in Rosamond\'s; but she kept it back, and changed it into\r\n"Surely the doctor and nurses must know best."\r\n\r\n"A fresh eye often makes a difference," said Raymond.  "To have her\r\namong us again--!" but he was cut short by the announcement of Mr.\r\nand Miss Fuller.\r\n\r\n"Poor Mr. Fuller," as every one called him, was the incumbent of St.\r\nNicholas, Willansborough, a college living always passed by the\r\nknowing old bachelor fellows, and as regularly proving a delusion to\r\nthe first junior in haste for a wife.  Twenty-five years ago Mr.\r\nFuller had married upon this, which, as Mr. Bindon said, was rather\r\na reason for not marrying--a town with few gentry, and a petty\r\nunthriving manufacture, needing an enormous amount of energy to work\r\nit properly, and getting--Mr. Fuller, with force yearly decreasing\r\nunder the pressure of a sickly wife, ill-educated, unsatisfactory\r\nsons, and unhealthy, aimless daughters.  Of late some assistance had\r\nbeen obtained, but only from Mr. Driver, the \'coach\' or cramming\r\ntutor, who was directing the studies of Frank and half a dozen more\r\nyouths, and his aid was strictly limited to a share in the Sunday\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nThe eldest daughter accompanied the Vicar.  Her mother had not\r\nhealth (or perhaps clothes) for a dinner-party, and it was the first\r\ntime she had ever been in the house.  Very shy and in much awe she\r\nwas!  Cecil viewed her as a constituent, and was elaborately civil\r\nand patronizing, doing the honours of all the photographs and\r\nillustrations on which she could lay hands, and only eliciting\r\nalternately \'Very nice,\' and \'How sweet!\'  A little more was made of\r\nthe alarms of the fire, and the preparations for clearing the house,\r\nand there was a further thaw about the bazaar.  It would be such a\r\nrelief from plain work, and she could get some lovely patterns from\r\nher cousin who had a missionary basket; but as to the burnt-out\r\nfamilies, the little knowledge or interest she seemed to have about\r\nthem was rather astounding, unless, as Rosamond suspected, she\r\nthought it \'shop,\' and uninteresting to the great ladies of Compton-\r\nPoynsett Hall.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, her father made the apprehended request for the loan of\r\nCompton Church during the intervals of services, and when the Rector\r\nexplained how brief those intervals would be, looked astonished, and\r\ndryly complimented him on his energy and his staff, somewhat as if\r\nthe new broom were at the bottom of these congratulations.\r\n\r\nThe schools were to be used for services until a temporary iron\r\nchurch could be obtained, for which Julius, to make up for his\r\nchurlishness in withholding his own church, made the handsomer\r\ndonation, and held out hopes of buying it afterwards for the use of\r\nSquattles End.  Then, having Mr. Fuller\'s ear to himself, he\r\nventured to say, though cautiously, as to one who had been a\r\nclergyman before he was born, "I wish it were possible to dispense\r\nwith this bazaar."\r\n\r\nMr. Fuller shrugged his shoulders.  "If every one subscribed in the\r\nstyle of this family."\r\n\r\n"They would be more likely to do so, without the appeal to secondary\r\nmotives."\r\n\r\n"Try them," said the elder man.\r\n\r\n"Exactly what I want to do.  I would put up the four walls, begin\r\nwith what you get from the insurance, a weekly offertory, and add\r\nimprovements as means came in.  This is not visionary.  I have seen\r\nproof of its success."\r\n\r\n"It may serve in new-fashioned city missions, but in an old-\r\nestablished place like this it would create nothing but offence.\r\nWhen you have been in Orders as long as I have, you will find that\r\nthere is nothing for it but to let people do what they will, not\r\nwhat one thinks best."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fuller," said Julius, eagerly, "will you try an experiment?\r\nDrop this bazaar, and I promise you our collection every Sunday\r\nevening for the year, giving notice of it to my people, and to such\r\nof yours as may be present."\r\n\r\n"I do not despise your offer," said Mr. Fuller, laying his hand upon\r\nhis arm.  "You mean it kindly, and if I were in your place, or had\r\nonly my own feelings to consider, I might attempt it.  But it would\r\nbe only mischievous to interfere with the bazaar.  Lady Tyrrell--all\r\nthe ladies, in fact--have set their minds on it, and if I objected\r\nthere would instantly be a party cry against me, and that is the one\r\nthing I have always avoided."\r\n\r\nHis tone of superior wisdom, meek and depressed as he always was,\r\ntried the Rector\'s patience enough to make his forehead burn and\r\nbring out his white eyebrows in strong relief.  "How about a\r\nblessing on the work?" he asked, suppressing so much that he hardly\r\nknew this was spoken aloud.\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Fuller smiled.  He had been a bit of a humorist when he\r\nwas an Oxford don.  "Speak of that to Briggs," he said, "and he\r\nwould answer, \'Cash for me, and the blessing may take care of\r\nitself.\'  As to the ladies--why, they deafen you about blessings on\r\ntheir humble efforts, and the widow\'s mite."\r\n\r\n"Simply meaning that they want their amusement a little--"\r\n\r\n"Buttered over," said Mr. Fuller, supplying the word.  "Though you\r\nare hard on them, Charnock--I don\'t know about the fine ladies; but\r\nthere are quiet folk who will work their fingers to the bone, and\r\ncan do nothing else."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true," said Julius; "and one would gladly find a safe outlet\r\nfor their diligence."\r\n\r\n"You do not trust to it for bringing the blessing," said Mr. Fuller\r\nin a tone that Julius liked even less than the mere hopeless faint-\r\nheartedness, for in it there was sarcasm on faith in aught but\r\npounds s. d.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers held another discussion on this matter later that\r\nnight, on the stairs, as they were on their way to their rooms.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you come to this meeting to-morrow, Julius?" asked Raymond.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that I should be of any use, unless--"\r\n\r\n"Unless what?"\r\n\r\n"Unless you would make what seems to me the right proposal, and I\r\ncould be any support in it."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"To use the insurance to put up the mere shells and plain\r\nindispensable fittings of the church and town-hall, then make the\r\ndrainage of Water Lane and Hall Street the first object for the\r\nrates, while the church is done by subscription and voluntary\r\neffort."\r\n\r\n"You put the drainage first--even before the church?" said Raymond,\r\nsmiling, with an elder brother\'s satisfaction in such an amount of\r\ncommon sense.\r\n\r\n"Of course I do," said Julius.  "An altar and four walls and chairs\r\nare all that ought to be sought for.  Little good can be done to\r\npeople\'s souls while their bodies are in the feverish discomfort of\r\nfoul air and water.  This is an opportunity not to be wasted, while\r\nall the houses are down, town-hall and all."\r\n\r\n"The very thing I told Briggs and the others this morning," said\r\nRaymond; "but I could not get a hearing; they said there never had\r\nbeen any illness worth mentioning, and in fact scouted the whole\r\nmatter, as people always do."\r\n\r\n"Yes, they take it as a personal insult when you mention the\r\nodorous--or odious, savours sweet," said Julius.  "I heard a good\r\ndeal of that when we had the spell of cholera at St. Awdry\'s."\r\n\r\n"I shall work on at it, and I trust to get it done in time," said\r\nRaymond; "but it will not be at once.  The subject is too new to\r\nthem, and the irritation it produces must subside before they will\r\nhear reason.  Besides, the first thing is to employ and feed these\r\npaper-makers."\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\n"That will pretty well absorb this first meeting.  The ladies will\r\nmanage that, I think; and when this is provided for, I will try what\r\nI can do at the committee; but there is no good in bringing it\r\nforward at this great public affair, when every ass can put in his\r\nword.  Everything depends on whom they choose for the new mayor.  If\r\nWhitlock comes in, there is some chance of sense and reason being\r\nheard.  Good night."\r\n\r\nAs Raymond said, the more immediate object of the meeting fixed for\r\nthe ensuing day, was to provide for the employment of the numerous\r\nwomen thrown out of employment by the destruction of the paper-\r\nmills.  A subscription was in hand, but not adequate to the need;\r\nand moreover, it was far more expedient to let them maintain\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nHow this was to be done was the question.  Cecil told her husband\r\nthat at Dunstone they made the women knit stockings; and he replied\r\nby recommending the suppression of Dunstone.  How strange it was\r\nthat what she had been used to consider as the source of honour\r\nshould be here held in what seemed to her disesteem!\r\n\r\nLady Tyrrell\'s ponies were tinkling up to the door of the hotel\r\nwhere the meeting was to be held, and her gracious smile recalled\r\nCecil\'s good-humour; Raymond saw them to their seats, and then had\r\nto go and take the chair himself on the platform--first, however,\r\nintroducing his wife to such of the ladies present as he\r\nrecollected.\r\n\r\nShe thought he wanted her to sit between melancholy white faced Mrs.\r\nFuller and a bony spinster in a poke-bonnet whom he called Miss\r\nSlater; but Cecil, concluding that this last could have no vote, and\r\nthat the Vicarage was secure, felt free to indulge herself by\r\ngetting back to Lady Tyrrell, who had scarcely welcomed her before\r\nexclaiming, "Mrs. Duncombe, I did not know you were returned."\r\n\r\n"I came back on the first news of your flare-up," said the newcomer.\r\n"I only came down this morning.  I would not have missed this\r\nmeeting for anything.  It is a true woman\'s question.  A fair\r\nmuster, I see," looking round with her eye-glass, and bowing to\r\nseveral on the platform, especially to Raymond, who returned the bow\r\nrather stiffly.\r\n\r\n"Ah! let me introduce you," said Lady Tyrrell.  "Mrs. Raymond\r\nCharnock Poynsett."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad to see you embarked in the cause," said the lady,\r\nfrankly holding out her hand.  "May we often meet in the same\r\nmanner, though I honestly tell you I\'m not of your party; I should\r\ngo dead against your husband if we only had a chance."\r\n\r\n"Come, you need not be so aggressive," laughed Lady Tyrrell; "you\r\nhaven\'t a vote yet.  You are frightening Mrs. Poynsett."  It was\r\ntrue.  Even Cecil Charnock was born too late to be one of the young\r\nladies who, in the first decades of the reformed Parliament, used to\r\nlook on a Liberal as a lusus naturae, whom they hardly believed to\r\nbe a gentleman.  But a lady who would openly accost the Member\'s\r\nbride with a protest against his politics, was a being beyond her\r\nexperience, and the contemplation fairly distracted her from her\r\nhusband\'s oratory.\r\n\r\nShe would have taken Miss Slater for the strong-minded female far\r\nrather than this small slim person, with the complexion going with\r\nthe yellower species of red hair and chignon, not unlike a gold-\r\npheasant\'s, while the thin aquiline nose made Cecil think of Queen\r\nElizabeth.  The dress was a tight-fitting black silk, with a\r\ngorgeous many-coloured gold-embroidered oriental mantle thrown\r\nloosely over it, and a Tyrolean hat, about as large as the\r\npheasant\'s comb, tipped over her forehead, with cords and tassels of\r\ngold; and she made little restless movements and whispered remarks\r\nduring the speeches.\r\n\r\nThere was to be a rate to renew the town-hall.  The rebuilding of\r\nthe paper-mills and dwelling-houses was fairly covered by the\r\ninsurance; but the Vicar, in his diffident apologetic voice, stated\r\nthat the church had been insufficiently insured, and moreover, that\r\nmany more sittings were needed than the former building had\r\ncontained.  He then read the list of subscriptions already promised,\r\nexpressed hopes of more coming in, invited ladies to take collecting\r\ncards, and added that he was happy to announce that the ladies of\r\nthe congregation had come forward with all the beneficence of their\r\nsex, and raised a sum to supply a new set of robes.\r\n\r\nHere the chairman glanced at his wife, but she was absorbed in\r\nwatching Mrs. Duncombe\'s restless hands; and the look was\r\nintercepted by Lady Tyrrell\'s eyes, which flashed back sympathetic\r\namusement, with just such a glance as used to pass between them in\r\nold times; but the effect was to make the Member\'s face grave and\r\nimpassive, and his eyes fix on the papers before him.\r\n\r\nThe next moment Cecil was ardently gazing at Mr. Fuller as he\r\nproceeded to his hopes of the bazaar to be held under the most\r\ndistinguished patronage, and of which he spoke as if it were the\r\nsubject of anticipations as sanguine as any the poor man could ever\r\nappear to indulge in.  And there was, in fact, the greatest stamping\r\nand cheering there had yet been, perhaps in compliment to the M.P.\'s\r\nyoung bride--at least, so Lady Tyrrell whispered, adding that\r\neverybody was trying to see her.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Charnock Poynsett himself took up the exposition of the\r\nthird branch of the subject, the support of the poor families thrown\r\nout of work at the beginning of winter.  There could be no\r\nemployment at the paper-mills till they were repaired; and after the\r\nheavy losses, they could not attempt to keep their people together\r\nby any payment.  It had been suggested that the readiest way of\r\nmeeting the difficulty, would be to employ the subscriptions already\r\npromised in laying in a stock of material to be made up into\r\ngarments, and then dispose of them out to the women at their homes;\r\nand appointing a day once a week when the work should be received,\r\nthe pay given, and fresh material supplied, by a party of volunteer\r\nladies.\r\n\r\nThis was, in fact, what he had been instructed to propose by the\r\nkindly souls who ordinarily formed the St. Nicholas bureau de\r\ncharite, who had instructed him to be their mouthpiece.  There was\r\ndue applause as the mayor seconded his resolution; but in the midst\r\na clear, rather high-pitched voice rose up close to Cecil, saying,\r\n"Mr. Chairman, allow me to ask what sale is anticipated for these\r\ngarments?"\r\n\r\n"I am told that there is a demand for them among the poor\r\nthemselves," said Raymond, judiciously concealing how much he was\r\ntaken aback by this female interference.\r\n\r\n"Allow me to differ.  A permanent work society numbering a few women\r\notherwise unemployed may find a sufficient sale in the neighbourhood\r\nunder the patronage of charitable ladies; but when you throw in\r\nninety-five or one hundred pair of hands depending on their work for\r\ntheir livelihood, the supply must necessarily soon go beyond any\r\ndemand, even fictitious.  It will not do to think of these women\r\nlike fancy knitters or embroiderers whose work is skilled.  Most of\r\nthem can hardly mend their own clothes, and the utmost that can be\r\nexpected of them is the roughest slop work."\r\n\r\n"Do you wish any expedient to be proposed?" asked the chairman, in a\r\nsort of aside.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have one.  I spent yesterday in collecting information."\r\n\r\n"Will Captain Duncombe move it?" suggested Raymond.\r\n\r\n"Oh no! he is not here.  No, it is no use to instruct anybody; I\r\nwill do it myself, if you please."\r\n\r\nAnd before the astonished eyes of the meeting, the gold-pheasant\r\nhopped upon the platform, and with as much ease as if she had been\r\nQueen Bess dragooning her parliament, she gave what even the\r\nastounded gentlemen felt to be a sensible practical exposition of\r\nways and means.\r\n\r\nShe had obtained the address of a warehouse ready to give such rough\r\nwork as the women could be expected to do; but as they were\r\nunaccustomed to work at home, and were at present much crowded from\r\nthe loss of so many houses, and could besides be little depended on\r\nfor working well enough without superintendence, her plan was to\r\nhire a room, collect the women, and divide the superintendence\r\nbetween the ladies; who should give out the work, see that it was\r\nproperly done, keep order, and the like.  She finished off in full\r\norder, by moving a resolution to this effect.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and a little consultation among the gentlemen,\r\nending by Raymond\'s absolutely telling Mr. Fuller that it was a very\r\nsensible practical arrangement, and that it _must_ be seconded;\r\nwhich the Vicar accordingly did, and it was carried without\r\nopposition, as in truth nothing so good had been thought of; and the\r\nnext thing was to name a committee of ladies, a treasurer and\r\nauditor of accounts.  There would be no work on Saturdays, so if the\r\nladies would each undertake half a day once a fortnight, the\r\nsuperintendence need not be a burthen.\r\n\r\nMrs. Duncombe and Miss Slater undertook the first start and\r\npreliminary arrangements, then each would take her half day in\r\nrotation.  Lady Tyrrell and her sister undertook two, Cecil two\r\nmore, and others were found to fill up the vacant space.  The\r\nchairman moved a vote of thanks to the lady for her suggestion,\r\nwhich she acknowledged by a gracious bow, not without triumph; and\r\nthe meeting broke up.\r\n\r\nSome one asked after Captain Duncombe as she descended into private\r\nlife.  "There\'s a wonderful filly that absorbs all his attention.\r\nAll Wil\'sbro\' might burn as long as Dark Hag thrives!  When do I\r\nexpect him?  I don\'t know; it depends on Dark Hag," she said in a\r\ntone of superior good-natured irony, then gathered up the radiant\r\nmantle and tripped off along the central street of the little old-\r\nfashioned country town, with gravelled not paved side-walks.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t she very superior?" said Cecil, when her husband had put her\r\non horseback.\r\n\r\n"I suppose she is very clever."\r\n\r\n"And she spoke capitally."\r\n\r\n"If she were to speak.  What would your father think of her?"\r\n\r\nBut for the first time Cecil\'s allegiance had experienced a certain\r\nshock.  Some sort of pedestal had hitherto been needful to her\r\nexistence; she was learning that Dunstone was an unrecognized\r\nelevation in this new country, and she had seen a woman attain to a\r\npinnacle that almost dazzled her, by sheer resource and good sense.\r\n\r\nAll the discussion she afterwards heard did not tend to shake her\r\nopinion; Raymond recounted the adventure at his mother\'s kettle-\r\ndrum, telling of his own astonishment at the little lady\'s\r\nassurance.\r\n\r\n"I do not see why she should be censured," said Cecil.  "You were\r\nall at a loss without her."\r\n\r\n"She should have got her husband to speak for her," said Mrs.\r\nPoynsett.\r\n\r\n"He was not there."\r\n\r\n"Then she should have instructed some other gentleman," said Mrs.\r\nPoynsett.  "A woman spoils all the effect of her doings by putting\r\nherself out of her proper place."\r\n\r\n"Perfectly disgusting!" said Julius.\r\n\r\nCecil had decidedly not been disgusted, except by the present strong\r\nlanguage; and not being ready at repartee, she was pleased when\r\nRosamond exclaimed, "Ah! that\'s just what men like, to get\r\ninstructed in private by us poor women, and then gain all the credit\r\nfor originality."\r\n\r\n"It is the right way," said the mother.  "The woman has much power\r\nof working usefully and gaining information, but the one thing that\r\nis not required of her is to come forward in public."\r\n\r\n"Very convenient for the man!" laughed Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"And scarcely fair," said Cecil.\r\n\r\n"Quite fair," said Rosamond, turning round, so that Cecil only now\r\nperceived that she had been speaking in jest.  "Any woman who is\r\nworth a sixpence had rather help her husband to shine than shine\r\nherself."\r\n\r\n"Besides," said Mrs. Poynsett, "the delicate edges of true womanhood\r\nought not to be frayed off by exposure in public."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Raymond.  "The gain of an inferior power of man in\r\npublic would be far from compensated by the loss in private of that\r\nwhich man can never supply."\r\n\r\n"Granted," said Rosamond slyly though sleepily, "that it always is\r\nan inferior power of man, which it does not seem to have been in the\r\nactual case."\r\n\r\n"It was a point on which she had special knowledge and information,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Poynsett.\r\n\r\n"And you were forced to thank her," said Cecil.\r\n\r\n"Yes, in common civility," said Raymond; "but it was as much as I\r\ncould do to get it done, the position was a false one altogether."\r\n\r\n"In fact, you were all jealous," said Rosamond.\r\n\r\nAt which everybody laughed, which was her sole intention; but Cecil,\r\nwho had said so much less, really thought what Rosamond said in mere\r\nplay.  Those extorted thanks seemed to her a victory of her sex in a\r\nfield she had never thought of; and though she had no desire to\r\nemulate the lady, and felt that a daughter of Dunstone must remember\r\nnoblesse oblige, the focus of her enthusiasm was in an odd state of\r\nshifting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nUnsatisfactory\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the party at Strawyers, Mrs. Poynsett lay on her\r\nsofa, thinking, with a trying recurrence, of that unfortunate and\r\nexcellent German Dauphine, who was pronounced by the Duchess of\r\nOrleans to have died of her own stupidity.\r\n\r\nAfter a fortnight had brought no improvement, but rather the\r\nreverse, to poor Anne\'s wan looks and feeble languid deportment,\r\nMrs. Poynsett had insisted on her seeing the doctor; and had been\r\nassured by him that there was nothing amiss, and that if Mrs Miles\r\nCharnock could only be roused and occupied she would be perfectly\r\nwell, but that her pining and depression might so lower her tone as\r\nto have a serious effect on her health.\r\n\r\nThere was no hope of her husband\'s return for at least a year,\r\nlikely eighteen months.  What was to be done with her?  What could\r\nbe a more unpropitious fate than for a Colonial girl, used to an\r\nactive life of exertion and usefulness, and trained to all domestic\r\narts, to be set down in a great English household where there was\r\nreally nothing for her to do, and usefulness or superintendence\r\nwould have been interfering; besides, as Miles had thoughts of\r\nsettling at the Cape, English experience would serve her little.\r\n\r\nShe had not cultivation enough for any pursuit to interest her.  She\r\nwas not musical, could not draw; and when Mrs. Poynsett had, by way\r\nof experiment, asked her to read aloud an hour a day, and selected\r\nthe Lives of the Lindsays, as an unexceptionable and improving book,\r\nfull of Scottish history, and even with African interest, she\r\ndutifully did her task as an attention to her invalid mother-in-law,\r\nbut in a droning husky tone, finding it apparently as severe a\r\npenance as it was to her auditor.\r\n\r\nThe doctor\'s chief prescription was horse exercise; but what would a\r\nconstitutional canter be to one accustomed to free rides through the\r\nBush?  And she would generally be alone; for even if Charlie, her\r\nnearest approach to an ally, had not been going away from home in a\r\nfew weeks, it could not be expected that he could often ride with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIt was plain that every one of the whole family was giving continual\r\nshocks to Mr. Pilgrim\'s disciple, even when they felt most innocent;\r\nand though the mother was sometimes disposed to be angry, sometimes\r\nto laugh at the little shudder and compression of the lips she began\r\nto know, she perceived what an addition this must be to the\r\nunhappiness of the poor lonely stranger.\r\n\r\n"She must be set to some good work," thought Mrs. Poynsett; "Julius\r\nmight let her go to his old women.  She might get on with them\r\nbetter than with the old women here.  And there\'s Cecil\'s working\r\naffair, it would be just the thing to give her an object.  I think I\r\ncan get through this evening.  I\'ve made Susan bring my desk, with\r\nall Miles\'s letters from his first voyage.  Shall I suppress the\r\nball?"\r\n\r\nTherewith Cecil made her entrance, in glossy white satin and deep\r\nlace, beautiful to behold, set off with rainbow glistening opals.\r\nShe made a quiet complacent show of herself, as one not vain of fine\r\nclothes, but used to an affectionate family appreciation of her best\r\nattire; and it was the most friendly childlike bit of intimacy that\r\nhad yet been attained between her and Mrs. Poynsett.\r\n\r\nAnd when she sat down to wait for the others, Mrs. Poynsett ventured\r\non telling her the prescription and her own perplexity, hoping for a\r\nvoluntary offer to employ Anne at Willansborough; but Cecil only\r\npitied her for having \'no resources\'; and when Mrs. Poynsett\r\nventured to suggest finding a niche for her in the work-room, the\r\nanswer was--"Our days are all disposed of."\r\n\r\n"You have two, I think?"\r\n\r\n"True; but it would never do for me to give up one of my times.  If\r\nI seemed to slacken, every one else would."\r\n\r\n"What will you do when the Session begins?"\r\n\r\n"I shall make some arrangement.  I do not think Anne could ever take\r\nmy place; she would have no authority."\r\n\r\nAnne herself here entered, took her knitting, and sat down,\r\napparently unaware of the little pluming gesture by which Cecil\r\nunconsciously demanded attention to her bridal satin.  One white-\r\ngloved gentleman after another dropped in, but none presumed on a\r\nremark; Jenkins announced the carriages; but Rosamond had not\r\nappeared, and after an excursion up-stairs, Julius returned,\r\ndeclaring that the first carriage must not wait for her, they would\r\ncome afterwards in the van, for there was something amiss in the\r\ndress, she had not had it on since the wedding.\r\n\r\n"And she came in so late," said Cecil.\r\n\r\n"That was my fault," he said.  "We came through the village to leave\r\na message at the doctor\'s;" and he then insisted that the other pair\r\nshould set off, taking Frank and Charlie, and prevent dinner from\r\nbeing kept waiting; at which the boys made faces, and declared that\r\nit was a dodge of his to join Jenny\'s party in the schoolroom,\r\ninstead of the solemn dinner; but they were obliged to submit; and\r\nit was not till twenty minutes later, that in glided something\r\nwhite, with blue cashmere and swan\'s-down over it, moving, as usual,\r\nwith languid grace.\r\n\r\n"Poor Julius!" smiled Rosamond with her dawdling dignity.  "Every\r\nsingle thing turned out a misfit!  As it is, there\'s a monstrous\r\nhole in my glove, which demands the benevolent fiction of my having\r\ntorn it by the way.  There, one second for the effect!--Good-bye,\r\ndear Mrs. Poynsett;--good-bye, Anne.  Come, you monument of patience\r\nand resignation!"\r\n\r\nFor one moment she had slipped back her little mantle, then drawn it\r\non, as, taking her husband\'s arm, she left the room; but that moment\r\nhad set Anne\'s cheeks aflame, and left Mrs. Poynsett in a startled\r\nstate of uncertainty, hoping her glance had been mistaken, wondering\r\nwhat could have been _more_ amiss, and feeling incapable of entering\r\non the subject with that severe young judge, of narrow experience.\r\n\r\nNever had her eldest son failed to come and bid her good night on\r\nhis way to his own room:  it was the great break in her long\r\nsleepless hours, and she used to call it a reversal of the relations\r\nof those days when he used to watch for her kiss on her way to bed.\r\nNor did he fail her now, but came and stood over her with his\r\nfragmentary tidings.\r\n\r\n"An immense party--oh yes, there was he persuading them not to wait.\r\nMr. Bowater took Rosamond in to dinner, Cecil went with Sir Harry\r\nVivian.  Yes, Lady Tyrrell was there, wonderfully handsome, but her\r\nexpression strikes me as altered; there is the sort of pathetic look\r\nthat, as Cecil said, is like the melancholy Medusa--I wonder if it\r\nis genuine.  She seems greatly disposed to cultivate Cecil--I wonder\r\nwhat she does it for."\r\n\r\n"Is Cecil attracted?  I fancied she was."\r\n\r\n"Yes, a good deal; and I fear the Wil\'sbro\' business will throw them\r\ntogether.  It is unlucky on Frank\'s account likewise.  I see we\r\nshall have it all over again there."\r\n\r\n"I have great hope in his office taking him away.  How was it with\r\nthem to-night?"\r\n\r\n"What I should call arrant coquetry, such as even Camilla never\r\nindulged in.  The girl kept out of his way--was absolutely chill and\r\nrepelling half the evening--throwing herself at the officers from\r\nBacksworth, till at last Frank obtained a waltz, and after that they\r\nwere perfectly inseparable."\r\n\r\n"If she coquets, she will soon disgust him!  Did Cecil enjoy\r\nherself?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes:  Phil Bowater opened the ball with her, and she dances very\r\nnicely--so quietly, Mrs. Bowater remarked it.  As to Rosamond, she\r\nwas in her native element--_is_ indeed, for she would not hear of\r\ncoming away when we did."\r\n\r\n"And Julius?"\r\n\r\n"Standing in a doorway, with others of his kind, absently talking,\r\nand watching Rosamond out of the tail of his eye.  I say, mother,"\r\nlowering his voice, "can\'t you give Rosamond a hint about her dress?\r\nCecil says she can\'t go out with her again like _that_.  Ah," as he\r\nheard a sigh, "I should not have worried you at night."\r\n\r\n"No, you have not.  Tell Cecil I will see about it.  Rosamond will\r\ntake it best from an old woman like me."\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett was quite conscious that Cecil had more high breeding\r\nand refinement than Rosamond, who was essentially the Irish\r\nColonel\'s daughter, and that the cold temperament of the one\r\nirritated the warm nature of the other.  More than one flash had\r\nrevealed Rosamond\'s contempt for Cecil\'s assumptions and intolerance\r\nfor her precision--besides, she was five years older, and had not an\r\nideal in Dunstone.\r\n\r\nAfter revolving what form of remonstrance would be least offensive\r\nduring half the night and day, Mrs. Poynsett was not prepared for\r\nthe appearance, about noon, of her son Julius, when, coming to what\r\nshe termed the confidential side of her couch, he asked\r\nhesitatingly, and colouring, "Mother, I want you to tell me, was\r\nthere anything amiss in Rose\'s dress last night?"\r\n\r\n"You did not perceive--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not used to the style of thing.  Is it not the way with what\r\nyou call full dress?"\r\n\r\n"To a certain degree--" she began.\r\n\r\nHe caught her up.  "And here has Cecil been putting my poor Rose\r\ninto a perfect agony!  It is only woman\'s censorious nonsense, isn\'t\r\nit, mother?  Mere folly to think otherwise!  I knew you would set my\r\nmind at rest; and if you would tell Cecil that you will not have\r\nRosamond insulted, it would be as well."\r\n\r\n"Stay, Julius," as he was walking off complacently, "I grieve, but I\r\nmust confess that I was going to speak to Rosamond myself."\r\n\r\nHe looked very blank.\r\n\r\n"Mind, I am certain that it is only an innocent following of what\r\nshe has been brought up to;" and as he signed a sort of hurt\r\nacquiescence, as if trying to swallow the offence, she added, "When\r\ndo you go out again?"\r\n\r\n"Not till Monday, when we dine at Colonel Ross\'s.  He is an old\r\nfriend of Lord Rathforlane."\r\n\r\n"Then I am inclined to let it cool.  Sometimes advice that has been\r\nresented does its work."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think the interference justifiable?"\r\n\r\n"Not from that quarter."\r\n\r\n"And can it be needful to attend to it?"\r\n\r\n"My dear Julius, it is not a style of dress I could ever have worn,\r\nnor have let my daughters have worn, if I had had any."\r\n\r\n"Conclusive, that!" said Julius, getting up, more really angered\r\nwith his mother than he had been since his childhood.\r\n\r\nHowever, he conquered himself by the time he had reached the door,\r\nand came back to say, "I beg your pardon, mother, I know you would\r\nnot say so without need."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, my boy!" and he saw tears in her eyes, the first time he\r\nwas conscious of having brought them.  As he bent down to kiss her,\r\nshe rallied, and cheerfully said, "I have no doubt it will all come\r\nright--Rosamond is too nice not to feel it at once."\r\n\r\nNo such thing; Rosamond was still furious.  If he disapproved, she\r\nwould submit to him; but he had seen nothing wrong, had he?\r\n\r\n"My dear Rose, I told you I was no judge:  you forget what my eyes\r\nare; and my mother--"\r\n\r\n"You have been to your mother?"\r\n\r\n"My dear, what could I do?"\r\n\r\n"And you think I am going to insult my own mother and sisters to\r\nplease any woman\'s finical prudish notions\'?  Pray what did Mrs.\r\nPoynsett say?"\r\n\r\nThe excuse of custom, pleaded by Mrs. Poynsett, only made Rosamond\r\nfiercer.  She wished she had never come where she was to hear that\r\nher own mother was no judge of propriety, and her husband could not\r\ntrust her, but must needs run about asking everybody if she were fit\r\nto be seen.  Such a tempest Julius had never seen outside a back\r\nstreet in the garrison town.  There seemed to be nothing she would\r\nnot say, and his attempts at soothing only added to her violence.\r\nIndeed, there was only one thing which would have satisfied her, and\r\nthat was, that she had been perfectly right, and the whole world\r\nbarbarously wrong; and she was wild with passion at perceiving that\r\nhe had a confidence in his own mother which he could not feel in\r\nhers.\r\n\r\nNor would he insist that Raymond should force Cecil to apologize.\r\n"My dear," he said, "don\'t you know there are things easier to ask\r\nthan to obtain?"\r\n\r\nTo which Rosamond replied, in another gust, that she would never\r\nagain sit down to table with Cecil until she had apologized for the\r\ninsult, not to herself, she did not care about that, but to the\r\nmother who had seen her dresses tried on:  Julius must tell Raymond\r\nso, or take her away to any cottage at once.  She would not stay\r\nwhere people blamed mamma and poisoned his mind against her!  She\r\nbelieved he cared for them more than for her!\r\n\r\nJulius had sympathized far longer with her offended feeling than\r\nanother could have done; but he was driven to assert himself.\r\n"Nonsense, Rose, you know better," he said, in a voice of\r\ndispleasure; but she pouted forth, "I don\'t know it.  You believe\r\nevery one against me, and you won\'t take my part against that nasty\r\nlittle spiteful prig!"\r\n\r\n"Cecil has behaved very ill to you," said Julius, granting her\r\nrather over much; "but she is a foolish conceited child, who does\r\nnot deserve that Raymond should be worried about her.  I foresee\r\nplenty of grievances from her; but, Rosie, we must and will not let\r\nher come between us and Raymond.  You don\'t know what a brother he\r\nhas been to me--I hardly think I could have got through my first\r\nyear at school but for him; and I don\'t think my sweet Rose could\r\nwish to do me such an ill turn as to stir up a feud with such a\r\nbrother because his wife is provoking."\r\n\r\nThe luncheon-bell began to sound, and she sobbed out, "There then,\r\ngo down, leave me alone!  Go to them, since you are so fond of them\r\nall!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you could come down as you are," said Julius,\r\ngravely; "I will bring you something."\r\n\r\n"It would choke me--choke me!" she sobbed out.\r\n\r\nJulius knew enough of the De Lancy temperament to be aware that\r\nwords carried them a long way, and he thought solitude would be so\r\nbeneficial, that he summoned resolution to leave her; but he had not\r\nthe face to appear alone, nor offer fictions to excuse her absence,\r\nso he took refuge in his dressing-room, until he had seen Cecil and\r\nAnne ride away from the hall door together.\r\n\r\nFor the two sisters-in-law had held a little indignation meeting,\r\nand Rosamond\'s misdemeanour had so far drawn them together, that\r\nCecil had offered to take Anne to see the working party, and let her\r\nassist thereat.\r\n\r\nThe coast being clear, Julius went down, encountering nothing worse\r\nthan the old butler, who came in while he was cutting cold beef, and\r\nto whom he said, "Lady Rosamond is rather knocked up; I am going to\r\ntake her something up-stairs."\r\n\r\nJenkins received this as the result of a dance, but much wanted to\r\nfetch a tray, which Julius refused, and set off with an ale-glass in\r\none hand, and in the other the plates with the beef and appliances,\r\nJenkins watching in jealous expectation of a catastrophe, having no\r\nopinion of Mr. Julius\'s powers as a waiter.  He was disappointed.\r\nThe downfall was deferred till the goal was reached, and was then\r\nmost salutary, for Rosamond sprang to pick up the knife and fork,\r\nlaughed at his awkwardness, refused to partake without him, produced\r\nimplements from her travelling-bag, and was as merry as she had been\r\nmiserable.\r\n\r\nNot a word on the feud was uttered; and the pair walked down to the\r\nvillage, where she was exemplary, going into all those more\r\ndistasteful parts of her duties there, which she sometimes shirked.\r\n\r\nAnd on her return, finding her long-expected letter from Miss\r\nM\'Kinnon awaiting her, she forgot all offences in her ardour to\r\nindoctrinate everybody with the hopes it gave of affording Mrs.\r\nPoynsett a change of room, if not even greater variety.\r\nUnfortunately, this eagerness was not met with a corresponding\r\nfervour.  There was in the household the acquiescence with long-\r\nestablished invalidism, that sometimes settles down and makes a\r\nnewcomer\'s innovations unwelcome.  Raymond had spoken to the old\r\ndoctor, who had been timid and discouraging; Susan resented the\r\nimplication that the utmost had not been done for her dear mistress;\r\nand Mrs. Poynsett herself, though warmly grateful for Rosamond\'s\r\naffection, was not only nervously unwilling to try experiments, but\r\nhad an instinctive perception that there was one daughter-in-law to\r\nwhom her increased locomotion would scarcely be welcome, and by no\r\nmeans wished to make this distaste evident to Raymond.  Cecil would\r\nnot have been so strong against the risk and imprudence, if her\r\nwishes had been the other way.  Moreover, she had been warned off\r\nfrom interference with the Rector\'s wife in the village, and she did\r\nnot relish Rosamond\'s making suggestions as to her province, as she\r\nconsidered the house--above all, when she viewed that lady as in a\r\nstate of disgrace.  It was nothing less than effrontery; and Cecil\r\nbecame stiffer and colder than ever.  She demanded of her mother-in-\r\nlaw whether there had been any promise of amendment.\r\n\r\n"Oh!  Julius will see to all that," said Mrs. Poynsett.\r\n\r\n"It is a woman\'s question," returned Cecil.\r\n\r\n"Not entirely."\r\n\r\n"Fancy a clergyman\'s wife!  It Mrs. Venn had appeared in that way at\r\nDunstone!"\r\n\r\n"You would have left it to Mr. Venn!  My dear, the less said the\r\nsooner mended."\r\n\r\nCecil was silenced, but shocked, for she was far too young and\r\ninexperienced to understand that indecorous customs complied with as\r\na matter of course, do not necessarily denote lack of innate\r\nmodesty--far less, how they could be confounded with home\r\nallegiance; and as to Anne, poor Rosamond was, in her eyes, only too\r\nlike the ladies who impeded Christiana on her outset.\r\n\r\nSo her ladyship retreated into languid sleepy dignity towards both\r\nher sisters-in-law; and on Monday evening showed herself, for a\r\nmoment, more decolletee, if possible, than before.  Mrs. Poynsett\r\nfeared lest Julius were weak in this matter; but at night she had a\r\nvisit from him.\r\n\r\n"Mother," he said, "it will not happen again.  Say no more."\r\n\r\n"I am only too thankful."\r\n\r\n"What do you think settled it?  No less than Lady Tyrrell\'s\r\nadmiration."\r\n\r\n"What could she have said?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t make out.  Rose was far too indignant to be comprehensible,\r\nwhen she told me on the way home; but there was something about\r\nadopting the becoming, and a repetition of--of some insolent\r\npraise."  And his mother felt his quiver of suppressed wrath.  "If\r\nRose had been what that woman took her for, she would have been\r\ndelighted," he continued; "but--"\r\n\r\n"It was horrible to her!" said his mother.  "And to you.  Yes, I\r\nknew it would right itself, and I am glad nothing passed about it\r\nbetween us."\r\n\r\n"So am I; she quite separates you from Cecil and Anne, and indeed\r\nall her anger is with Lady Tyrrell.  She will have it there was\r\nmalice in inciting her to shock old friends and annoy you--a sort of\r\nattempt to sympathize her into opposition."\r\n\r\n"Which had a contrary effect upon a generous nature."\r\n\r\n"Exactly!  She thinks nothing too bad for that woman, and declares\r\nshe is a serpent."\r\n\r\n"That\'s dear Rosamond\'s anger; but I imagine that when I occur to\r\nCamilla\'s mind, it is as the obstructive old hag, who once stood in\r\nher way; and so, without any formed designs, whatever she says of me\r\nis coloured by that view."\r\n\r\n"Quite possible; and I am afraid the sister is just such another.\r\nShe seems quite to belong to Mrs. Duncombe\'s set.  I sat next her at\r\ndinner, and tried to talk to her, but she would only listen to that\r\nyoung Strangeways."\r\n\r\n"Strangeways!  I wonder if that is Susan Lorimer\'s son?"\r\n\r\n"Probably, for his Christian name is Lorimer."\r\n\r\n"I knew her rather well as a girl.  She was old Lord Lorimer\'s\r\nyoungest daughter, and we used to walk in the Square gardens\r\ntogether; but I did not see much of her after I married; and after a\r\ngood while, she married a man who had made a great fortune by\r\nmining.  I wonder what her son is like?"\r\n\r\n"He must be the man, for he is said to be the millionaire of the\r\nregiment.  Just the match that Lady Tyrrell would like."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that\'s well," said Mrs. Poynsett.\r\n\r\n"From your point of view," said Julius, smiling.\r\n\r\n"If he will only speak out before it has had time to go deep with\r\nFrank!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nCold Heart\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that very moment the two sisters in question were driving home in\r\nthe opposite corners of the carriage in the dark.\r\n\r\n"Really, Lenore," was Lady Tyrrell saying, "you are a very\r\nimpracticable girl."\r\n\r\nThere was a little low laugh in answer.\r\n\r\n"What blast has come and frozen you up into ice?" the elder sister\r\nadded caressingly; but as she felt for Eleonora\'s hand in the dark,\r\nshe obtained nothing but the cold handle of a fan.  "That\'s just\r\nit!" she said, laughing; "hard ivory, instead of flesh and blood."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help it!" was the answer.\r\n\r\n"But why not?  I\'m sure you had admiration enough to turn any girl\'s\r\nhead."\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nLady Tyrrell renewed her address still more tenderly--"Lenore,\r\ndarling, it is quite needful that you should understand your\r\nposition."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I understand it only too well," came in a smothered\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"It may be very painful, but it ought to be made clear before you\r\nhow you stand.  You know that my father was ruined--there\'s no word\r\nfor it but ruined."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"He had to give up the property to the creditors, and live on an\r\nallowance."\r\n\r\n"I know that."\r\n\r\n"And, of course, I can\'t bear speaking of it; but the house is\r\nreally let to me.  I have taken it as I might any other house to\r\nlet."\r\n\r\n"Yes," again assented Eleonora.\r\n\r\n"And do you know why?"\r\n\r\n"You said it was for the sake of the old home and my father!" said\r\nthe girl, with a bitter emphasis on the _said_.\r\n\r\n"So it was!  It was to give you the chance of redeeming it, and\r\nkeeping it in the family.  It is to be sold, you know, as soon as\r\nyou are of age, and can give your consent.  I can\'t buy it.  Mine is\r\nonly a jointure, a life income, and you know that you might as well\r\nthink of Mary buying Golconda; but you--you--with such beauty as\r\nyours--might easily make a connection that would save it."\r\n\r\nThere was only a choked sound.\r\n\r\n"I know you feel the situation painfully, after having been mistress\r\nso long."\r\n\r\n"Camilla, you _know_ it is not that!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, my dear, I can see farther than you avow.  You can\'t marry till\r\nyou are twenty-one, you know; but you might be very soon engaged,\r\nand then we should see our way.  It only depends on yourself.\r\nPlenty of means, and no land to tie him down, ready to purchase and\r\nto settle down.  It would be the very thing; and I see you are a\r\nthoroughly sensible girl, Lena."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!  I am not even sensible enough to know who is to be this\r\npurchaser."\r\n\r\n"Come, Lena, don\'t be affected.  Why! he was the only poor creature\r\nyou were moderately gracious to."\r\n\r\n"I! what do you mean?"\r\n\r\nLady Tyrrell laughed again.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" in a tone of relief, "I can explain all that to you.  All the\r\nStrangeways family were at Rockpier the winter before you came, and\r\nI made great friends with Margaret Strangeways, the eldest sister.\r\nI wanted very much to hear about her, for she has had a great deal\r\nof illness and trouble, and I had not ventured to write to her."\r\n\r\n"Oh! was that the girl young Debenham gave up because her mother\r\nworried him so incessantly, and who went into a Sisterhood?"\r\n\r\n"It was she who broke it off.  She found he had been forced into it\r\nby his family, and was really attached elsewhere.  I never knew the\r\nrights of it till I saw the brother to-night."\r\n\r\n"Very praiseworthy family confidence!"\r\n\r\n"Camilla, you know I object to that tone."\r\n\r\n"So do most young ladies, my dear--at least by word."\r\n\r\n"And once for all, you need have no fancies about Mr. Lorimer\r\nStrangeways.  I am civil to him, of course, for Margaret\'s sake; and\r\nLady Susan was very kind to me; but if there were nothing else\r\nagainst him, he is entirely out of the question, for I know he runs\r\nhorses and bets on them."\r\n\r\n"So does everybody, more or less."\r\n\r\n"And you! you, Camilla, after what the turf has cost us, can wish me\r\nto encourage a man connected with it."\r\n\r\n"My dear Lena, I know you had a great shock, which made the more\r\nimpression because you were such a child; but you might almost as\r\nwell forswear riding, as men who have run a few horses, or staked a\r\nfew thousands.  Every young man of fortune has done so in his turn,\r\njust by way of experiment--as a social duty as often as not."\r\n\r\n"Let them," said Eleonora, "as long as I have nothing to do with\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"What was that pretty French novel--Sybille, was it?--where the\r\nchild wanted to ride on nothing but swans?  You will be like her,\r\nand have to condescend to ordinary mortals."\r\n\r\n"She did not.  She died.  And, Camilla, I would far rather die than\r\nmarry a betting man."\r\n\r\n"A betting man, who regularly went in for it!  You little goose, to\r\nthink that I would ask you to do that!  As you say we have had\r\nenough of that!  But to renounce every man who has set foot on a\r\ncourse, or staked a pair of gloves, is to renounce nine out of ten\r\nof the world one lives in."\r\n\r\n"I do renounce them.  Camilla, remember that my mind is made up for\r\never, and that nothing shall ever induce me to marry a man who\r\nmeddles with the evils of races."\r\n\r\n"Meddles with the evils?  I understand, my dear Lena."\r\n\r\n"A man who makes a bet," repeated Eleonora.\r\n\r\n"We shall see," was her ladyship\'s light answer, in contrast to the\r\ngrave tones; "no rules are without exceptions, and I only ask for\r\n_one_."\r\n\r\n"I shall make none."\r\n\r\n"I confess I thought you were coming to your senses; you have been\r\nacting so wisely and sensibly ever since you came home, about that\r\nyoung Frank Charnock."\r\n\r\nLady Tyrrell heard a little rustle, but could not see that it was\r\nthe clasping of two hands over a throbbing heart.  "I am very glad\r\nyou are reasonable enough to keep him at a distance.  Poor boy, it\r\nwas all very well to be friendly with him when we met him in a place\r\nlike Rockpier, and you were both children; but you are quite right\r\nnot to let it go on.  It would be mere madness."\r\n\r\n"For him, yes," murmured the girl.\r\n\r\n"And even more so for you.  Why, if he had any property worth\r\nspeaking of, it would be a wretched thing to marry into that family!\r\nI am sure I pity those three poor girls!  Miles\'s wife looks\r\nperfectly miserable, poor thing, and the other two can\'t conceal the\r\nstate of things.  She is just the sort of woman who cannot endure a\r\ndaughter-in-law."\r\n\r\n"I thought I heard Lady Rosamond talking very affectionately of\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"Very excitedly, as one who felt it her duty to stand up for her\r\nout-of-doors, whatever she may do indoors.  I saw victory in those\r\nplump white shoulders, which must have cost a battle; but whatever\r\nLady Rosamond gains, will make it all the worse for the others.  No,\r\nEleonora, I have known Mrs. Poynsett\'s rancour for many years, and I\r\nwould wish no one a worse lot than to be her son\'s fiancee, except\r\nto be his wife."\r\n\r\n"She did not seem to object to these marriages."\r\n\r\n"The sons took her by surprise.  Besides, Raymond\'s was the very\r\nparti mothers seek out for their sons.  Depend upon it, she sent him\r\noff with her blessing to court the unexceptionable cousin with the\r\nfamily property.  Poor Raymond, he is a dutiful son, and he has done\r\nthe deed; but, if I am not much mistaken the little lady is made of\r\nsomething neither mother nor son is prepared for, and he has not\r\nlove enough to tame her with."\r\n\r\n"That may be seen at a glance.  He can\'t help it, poor fellow; he\r\nwould have had it if he could, like anything else that is proper."\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\'s silence; then the exclamation, "Just look\r\nthere!"\r\n\r\nOne of the hats was nodding on the box in a perilous manner.\r\n\r\n"It is _only_ James," said Lady Tyrrell; "as long as it is not the\r\ncoachman, it matters the less.  There\'s no danger."\r\n\r\n"You will not keep him, though!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know.  He is much the best looking and handiest of the men;\r\nand your page, Master Joshua, is no great acquisition yet."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would not call him mine; I wish you would send him back\r\nto his grandmother.  I can\'t bear his being among those men."\r\n\r\n"Very complimentary to my household!  They are not a bit worse than\r\nthe company he came from!  You don\'t believe in rural simplicity,\r\neh?"\r\n\r\n"I believe that taking that boy from his home makes us responsible."\r\n\r\n"And do I hinder you from catechizing him to your heart\'s content?\r\nor sending him to the school of design?"\r\n\r\nAgain Eleonora was silent.  Perhaps the balancing of the footman\'s\r\nhead occupied her mind.  At any rate, no more was said till the\r\nsisters had reached their home.  Then, at the last moment, when\r\nthere was no time left for a reply, Eleonora cleared and steadied\r\nher voice, and said, "Camilla, understand two things for truth\'s\r\nsake.  First, I mean what I say.  Nothing shall ever induce me to\r\nmarry a man who bets.  Next, I never have forgotten Frank Charnock\r\nfor one moment.  If I have been cold and distant to him, it is\r\nbecause I will not draw him near me to be cruelly scorned and\r\ndisappointed!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind the why, if the effect is the same," were Lady\r\nTyrrell\'s last words, as the door opened.\r\n\r\nEleonora\'s little white feet sped quickly up the steps, and with a\r\nhasty good night, she sped across the hall, but paused at the door.\r\n"Papa must not be disappointed," she whispered to herself, and\r\ndashed her hand over her eyes; and at the moment the lock turned,\r\nand a gray head appeared, with a mighty odour of smoke.  "Ah!  I\r\nthought my little Lena would not pass me by!  Have you had a\r\npleasant party, my dear?  Was young Strangeways there?"\r\n\r\nShe had nestled in his arms, and hoped to avoid notice by keeping\r\nher head bent against him, as she hastily responded to his\r\nquestions; but he detected something.\r\n\r\n"Eh?  Camilla been lecturing?  Is that it?  You\'ve not been crying,\r\nlittle one?  It is all right, you know!  You and I were jolly enough\r\nat Rockpier; but it was time we were taken in hand, or you would\r\nhave grown into a regular little nun, among all those black coats."\r\n\r\n"I wish I were."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!  You don\'t know life!  You\'ll tell another story one of\r\nthese days; and hark childie, when you\'ve married, and saved the old\r\nplace, you\'ll keep the old room for the old man, and we\'ll have our\r\nown way again."\r\n\r\nShe could but kiss him, and hide her agitation in caresses, ere\r\nhurrying up the stairs she reached her own rooms, a single bed-\r\nchamber opening into a more spacious sitting-room, now partially\r\nlighted by the candles on the toilette-table within.\r\n\r\nShe flung herself down on a chair beyond the line of light, and\r\npanted out half aloud, "Oh!  I am in the toils!  Oh for help!  Oh\r\nfor advice!  Oh! if I knew the right!  Am I unfair? am I cold and\r\nhard and proud?  Is she telling me true?  No, I know she is not--not\r\nthe whole truth, and I don\'t know what is left out, or what is\r\nfalse!  And I\'m as bad--making them think I give in and discard\r\nFrank!  Oh! is that my pride--or that it is too bad to encourage him\r\nnow I know more?  He\'ll soon scorn me, and leave off--whatever he\r\never thought of me.  She has taken me from all my friends--and she\r\nwill take him away!  No one is left me but papa; and though she\r\ncan\'t hurt his love, she has got his confidence away, and made him\r\njoin against me!  But that one thing I\'ll never, never do!"\r\n\r\nShe started up, and opened a locked purple photograph-album, with\r\n\'In Memoriam\' inscribed on it--her hands trembling so that she could\r\nhardly turn the key.  She turned to the likeness of a young man--a\r\npainful likeness of a handsome face, where the hard verities of sun-\r\npainting had refused to veil the haggard trace of early dissipation,\r\nthough the eyes had still the fascinating smile that had made her\r\nbrother Tom, with his flashes of fitful good-nature, the idol of his\r\nlittle sister\'s girlhood.  The deadly shock of his sudden death had\r\nbeen her first sorrow; and those ghastly whispers which she had\r\nheard from the servants in the nursery, and had never forgotten,\r\nbecause of the hushed and mysterious manner, had but lately started\r\ninto full force and meaning, on the tongues of the plain-spoken\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nShe gazed, and thought of the wrecked life that might have been so\r\nrich in joys; nay, her tenderness for her father could not hide from\r\nher how unlike his old age was from that of Mr. Bowater, or of any\r\nmen who had done their service to their generation in all noble\r\nexertion.  He had always indeed been her darling, her charge; but\r\nshe had never known what it was to look up to him with the fervent\r\nbelief and enthusiasm she had seen in other girls.  To have him\r\namused, loitering from reading-room to parade or billiard-room, had\r\nbeen all that she aspired to, and only lately had she unwillingly\r\nawakened to the sense how and why this was--and why the family were\r\naliens in their ancestral home.\r\n\r\n"And Camilla, who knew all--knew, and lived through the full force\r\nof the blight and misery--would persuade me that it all means\r\nnothing, and is a mere amusing trifle!  Trifle, indeed, that breaks\r\nhearts and leads to despair and self-destruction and dishonour!  No,\r\nno, no--nothing shall lead me to a gamester! though Frank may be\r\nlost to me!  He will be! he will be!  We deserve that he should be!\r\nI deserve it--if family sins fall on individuals--I deserve it!  It\r\nis better for him--better--better.  And yet, can he forget--any more\r\nthan I--that sunny day--?  Oh! was she luring him on false\r\npretences?  What shall I do?  How will it be?  Where is my\r\ncounsellor?  Emily, Emily, why did you die?"\r\n\r\nEmily\'s portrait--calm, sweet, wasted, with grave trustful eyes--was\r\nin the next page.  The lonely girl turned to it, and gazed, and\r\ndrank in the soothing influence of the countenance that had never\r\nfailed to reply with motherly aid and counsel.  It rested the\r\nthrobbing heart; and presently, with hands clasped and head bent,\r\nEleonora Vivian knelt in the little light closet she had fitted as\r\nan oratory, and there poured out her perplexities and sorrows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nA Truant\r\n\r\n\r\nSince for your pleasure you came here,\r\n   You shall go back for mine.--COWPER\r\n\r\n"How like Dunstone you have made this room!" said Raymond, entering\r\nhis wife\'s apartment with a compliment that he knew would be\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nCecil turned round from her piano, to smile and say, "I wish papa\r\ncould see it."\r\n\r\n"I hope he will next spring; but he will hardly bring Mrs. Charnock\r\nhome this winter.  I am afraid you are a good deal alone here,\r\nCecil.  Is there no one you would like to ask?"\r\n\r\n"The Venns," suggested Cecil; "only we do not like them to leave\r\nhome when we are away; but perhaps they would come."\r\n\r\nRaymond could not look as if the proposal were a very pleasing one.\r\n"Have you no young-lady friends?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"We never thought it expedient to have intimacies in the\r\nneighbourhood," said Cecil.\r\n\r\n"Well, we shall have Jenny Bowater here in a week or two."\r\n\r\n"I thought she was your mother\'s friend."\r\n\r\n"So she is.  She is quite young enough to be yours."\r\n\r\n"I do not see anything remarkable about her."\r\n\r\n"No, I suppose there is not; but she is a very sensible superior\r\nperson."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!  In that commonplace family."\r\n\r\n"Poor Jenny has had an episode that removes her from the\r\ncommonplace.  Did you ever hear of poor Archie Douglas?"\r\n\r\n"Was not he a good-for-nothing relation of your mother?"\r\n\r\n"Not that exactly.  He was the son of a good-for-nothing, I grant,\r\nwhom a favourite cousin had unfortunately married, but he was an\r\nexcellent fellow himself; and when his father died, she had Mrs.\r\nDouglas to live in that cottage by the Rectory, and sent the boy to\r\nschool with us; then she got him into Proudfoot\'s office--the\r\nsolicitor at Backsworth, agent for everybody\'s estates hereabouts.\r\nWell, there arose an attachment between him and Jenny; the Bowaters\r\ndid not much like it, of course; but they are kind-hearted and good-\r\nnatured, and gave consent, provided Archie got on in his profession.\r\nIt was just at the time when poor Tom Vivian was exercising a great\r\ndeal more influence than was good among the young men in the\r\nneighbourhood; and George Proudfoot was rather a joke for imitating\r\nhim in every respect--from the colour of his dog-cart to the curl of\r\nhis dog\'s tail.  I remember his laying a wager, and winning it too,\r\nthat if he rode a donkey with his face to the tail, Proudfoot would\r\ndo the same; but then, Vivian did everything with a grace and\r\noriginality."\r\n\r\n"Like his sister."\r\n\r\n"And doubly dangerous.  Every one liked him, and we were all more\r\ntogether than was prudent.  At last, two thousand pounds of my\r\nmother\'s money, which was passing through the Proudfoots\' hands,\r\ndisappeared; and at the same time poor Archie fled.  No one who knew\r\nhim could have any reasonable doubt that he did but bear the blame\r\nof some one else\'s guilt, most likely that of George Proudfoot; but\r\nhe died a year or two back without a word, and no proof has ever\r\nbeen found; and alas! the week after Archie sailed, we saw his name\r\nin the list of sufferers in a vessel that was burnt.  His mother\r\nhappily had died before all this, but there were plenty to grieve\r\nbitterly for him; and poor Jenny has been the more like one of\r\nourselves in consequence.  He had left a note for Jenny, and she\r\nalways trusted him; and we all of us believe that he was innocent."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t think how a person can go about as usual, or ever get over\r\nsuch a thing as that."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps she hasn\'t," said Raymond, with a little colour on his\r\nbrown cheek.  "But I\'m afraid I can\'t make those visits with you to-\r\nday.  I am wanted to see the plans for the new town-hall at\r\nWil\'sbro\'.  Will you pick me up there?"\r\n\r\n"There would be sure to be a dreadful long waiting, so I will\r\nluncheon at Sirenwood instead; Lady Tyrrell asked me to come over\r\nany day."\r\n\r\n"Alone?  I think you had better wait for me."\r\n\r\n"I can take Frank."\r\n\r\n"I should prefer a regular invitation to us both."\r\n\r\n"She did not mean to make a formal affair."\r\n\r\n"Forms are a protection, and I do not wish for an intimacy there,\r\nespecially on Frank\'s account."\r\n\r\n"It would be an excellent match for Frank."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, no; the estate is terribly involved, and there are three\r\ndaughters; besides which, the family would despise a younger son.\r\nAn attachment could only lead to unhappiness now, besides the\r\npositive harm of unsettling him.  His tutor tells me that as it is\r\nhe is very uneasy about his examination--his mind is evidently\r\npreoccupied.  No, no, Cecil, don\'t make the intercourse\r\nunnecessarily close.  The Vivians have not behaved well to my\r\nmother, and it is not desirable to begin a renewal.  But you shall\r\nnot lose your ride, Cecil; I\'ll ask one of the boys to go with you\r\nto the Beeches, and perhaps I shall meet you there."\r\n\r\n"He talks of my lonely life," said Cecil, to herself, "and yet he\r\nwants to keep me from the only person who really understands me, all\r\nfor some rancorous old prejudice of Mrs. Poynsett\'s.  It is very\r\nhard.  There\'s no one in the house to make a friend of--Rosamond, a\r\nmere garrison belle; and Anne, bornee and half a dissenter; and as\r\nsoon as I try to make a friend, I am tyrannized over, and this Miss\r\nBowater thrust on me."\r\n\r\nShe was pounding these sentiments into a sonata with great energy,\r\nwhen her door re-opened, and Raymond again appeared.  "I am looking\r\nfor two books of Mudie\'s.  Do you know where they can be?  I can\'t\r\nmake up the number."\r\n\r\n"They are here," said Cecil; "Lanfrey\'s Vie de Napoleon; but I have\r\nnot finished them."\r\n\r\n"The box should have gone ten days ago.  My mother has nothing to\r\nread, and has been waiting all this time for the next part of\r\nMiddlemarch," said Raymond.\r\n\r\n"She said there was no hurry," murmured Cecil.\r\n\r\n"No doubt she did; but we must not take advantage of her\r\nconsideration.  Reading is her one great resource, and we must so\r\ncontrive that your studies shall not interfere with it."\r\n\r\nHe waited for some word of regret, but none came; and he was obliged\r\nto add, "I must deprive you of the books for the present, for she\r\nmust not be kept waiting any longer; but I will see about getting\r\nthem for you in some other way.  I must take the box to the station\r\nin the dog-cart."  He went without a word from her.  It was an\r\nentirely new light to her that her self-improvement could possibly\r\nbe otherwise than the first object with everyone.  At home, father\r\nand mother told one another complacently what Cecil was reading, and\r\nnever dreamt of obstructing the virtuous action.  Were her studies\r\nto be sacrificed to an old woman\'s taste for novels?\r\n\r\nCecil had that pertinacity of nature that is stimulated to\r\nresistance by opposition; and she thought of the Egyptian campaign,\r\nand her desire to understand the siege of Acre.  Then she\r\nrecollected that Miss Vivian had spoken of reading the book, and\r\nthis decided her.  "I\'ll go to Sirenwood, look at it, and order it.\r\nNo one can expect me to submit to have no friends abroad nor books\r\nat home.  Besides, it is all some foolish old family feud; and what\r\na noble thing it will be for my resolution and independence to force\r\nthe two parties to heal the breach, and bridge it over by giving\r\nMiss Vivian to Frank."\r\n\r\nIn this mood she rang the bell, and ordered her horses; not however\r\ntill she had reason to believe the dog-cart on the way down the\r\navenue.  As she came down in her habit, she was met by Frank,\r\nreturning from his tutor.\r\n\r\n"Have I made a mistake, Cecil!  I thought we were to go out together\r\nthis afternoon!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but Raymond was wanted at Willansborough, and I am going to\r\nlunch at Sirenwood.  I want to borrow a book."\r\n\r\n"Oh, very well, I\'ll come, if you don\'t mind.  Sir Harry asked me to\r\ndrop in and look at his dogs."\r\n\r\nThis was irresistible; and Frank decided on riding the groom\'s\r\nhorse, and leaving him to conduct Anne to the rendezvous in the\r\nafternoon--for Charlie had been at Sandhurst for the last week--\r\nrunning in first to impart the change of scheme to her, as she was\r\nperforming her daily task of reading to his mother.\r\n\r\nHe did so thus:  "I say, Anne, Cecil wants to go to Sirenwood first\r\nto get a book, so Lee will bring you to meet us at the Beeches at\r\n2.30."\r\n\r\n"Are you going to luncheon at Sirenwood?" asked Mrs. Poynsett.\r\n\r\n"Yes; Cecil wants to go," said the dutiful younger brother.\r\n\r\n"I wish you would ask Cecil to come in.  Raymond put himself into\r\nsuch a state of mind at finding me reading Madame de Sevigne, that I\r\nam afraid he carried off her books summarily, though I told him I\r\nwas glad of a little space for my old favourites."\r\n\r\nCecil was, however, mounted by the time Frank came out, and they\r\ncantered away together, reaching the portico of Sirenwood in about\r\ntwenty minutes.\r\n\r\nCecil had never been in the house before, having only left her card,\r\nthough she had often met the sisters.  She found herself in a\r\ncarpeted hall, like a supplementary sitting-room, where two\r\ngentlemen had been leaning over the wide hearth.  One, a handsome\r\nbenignant-looking old man, with a ruddy face and abundant white\r\nwhiskers, came forward with a hearty greeting.  "Ah! young Mrs.\r\nPoynsett!  Delighted to see you!--Frank Charnock, you\'re come in\r\ngood time; we are just going down to see the puppies before\r\nluncheon.  Only I\'ll take Mrs. Poynsett to the ladies first.\r\nDuncombe, you don\'t know Mrs. Raymond Poynsett--one must not say\r\nsenior bride, but the senior\'s bride.  Is that right?"\r\n\r\n"No papa," said a bright voice from the stairs, "you haven\'t it at\r\nall right; Mrs. Charnock Poynsett, if you please--isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"I believe so," replied Cecil.  "Charnock always seems my right\r\nname."\r\n\r\n"And you have all the right to retain it that Mrs. Poynsett had to\r\nkeep hers," said Lady Tyrrell, as they went up-stairs to her\r\nbedroom.  "How is she?"\r\n\r\n"As usual, thank you; always on the sofa."\r\n\r\n"But managing everything from it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes."\r\n\r\n"Never was there such a set of devoted sons, models for the\r\nneighbourhood."\r\n\r\nCecil felt a sense of something chiming in with her sources of\r\nvexation, but she only answered, "They are passionately fond of\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"Talk of despotism!  Commend me to an invalid!  Ah! how delightfully\r\nyou contrive to keep your hair in order!  I am always scolding\r\nLenore for coming in dishevelled, and you look so fresh and compact!\r\nHere is my sanctum.  You\'ll find Mrs. Duncombe there.  She drove\r\nover in the drag with her husband on their way to Backsworth.  I am\r\nso glad you came, there is so much to talk over."\r\n\r\n"If our gentlemen will give us time," said Mrs. Duncombe; "but I am\r\nafraid your senator will not be as much absorbed in the dogs as my\r\ncaptain."\r\n\r\n"I did not come with my husband," said Cecil; "he is gone to\r\nWillansborough to meet the architect."\r\n\r\n"Ah, about the new buildings.  I do hope and trust the opportunity\r\nwill not be wasted, and that the drainage will be provided for."\r\n\r\n"You are longing to have a voice there," said Lady Tyrrell,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n"I am.  It is pre-eminently a woman\'s question, and this is a great\r\nopportunity.  I shall talk to every one.  Little Pettitt, the hair-\r\ndresser, has some ground there, and he is the most intelligent of\r\nthe tradesmen.  I gave him one of those excellent little hand-bills,\r\nput forth by the Social Science Committee, on sanitary arrangements.\r\nI thought of asking you to join us in ordering some down, and never\r\nletting a woman leave our work-room without one."\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t do better, I am sure," said Lady Tyrrell; "only,\r\nwhat\'s the use of preaching to the poor creatures to live in good\r\nhouses, when their landlords won\'t build them, and they must live\r\nsomewhere?"\r\n\r\n"Make them coerce the landlords," said Mrs. Duncombe; "that\'s the\r\nonly way.  Upheave the masses from beneath."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s an earthquake," said Cecil.\r\n\r\n"Earthquakes are sometimes wholesome."\r\n\r\n"But the process is not so agreeable that we had not rather avert\r\nit," said Lady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n"All ours at Dunstone are model cottages," said Cecil; "it is my\r\nfather\'s great hobby."\r\n\r\n"Squires\' hobbies are generally like the silver trough the lady gave\r\nher sow," said Mrs. Duncombe; "they come before the poor are\r\nprepared, and with a spice of the autocrat."\r\n\r\n"Come, I won\'t have you shock Mrs. Charnock Poynsett," said Lady\r\nTyrrell.  "You illogical woman!  The poor are to demand better\r\nhouses, and the squires are not to build them!"\r\n\r\n"The poor are to be fitly housed, as a matter of right, and from\r\ntheir own sense of self-respect," returned Mrs. Duncombe; "not a few\r\nfavourites, who will endure dictation, picked out for the model\r\ncottage.  It is the hobby system against which I protest."\r\n\r\n"Without quite knowing what was conveyed by it in this instance?"\r\nsaid Lady Tyrrell.  "I am sure there is nothing I wish more than\r\nthat we had any power of improvement of the cottages here; but\r\ninfluence is our only weapon."\r\n\r\n"By the bye, Mrs. Poynsett," continued Mrs. Duncombe, "will you give\r\na hint to Mrs. Miles Charnock that it will never do to preach to the\r\nwomen at the working-room?  I don\'t mean holding forth," she added,\r\nseeing Cecil\'s look of amazement; "but improving the occasion,\r\ntalking piously, giving tracts, and so forth."\r\n\r\n"I thought you gave sanitary tracts!" said Lady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n"That is quite different."\r\n\r\n"I doubt whether the women would see the distinction.  A little book\r\n_is_ a tract to them."\r\n\r\n"I would abstain rather than let our work get a goody reputation for\r\nindoctrinating sectarianism.  It would be all up with us; we might\r\nas well keep a charity school."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think the women dislike it," said Cecil.\r\n\r\n"Most likely they think it the correct thing, the grain which they\r\nmust swallow with our benefits; but for that very reason it injures\r\nthe whole tone, and prevents them learning independence.  Put it in\r\nthat light; I know you can."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Anne would understand," said Cecil, somewhat\r\nflattered.\r\n\r\n"I doubt whether there are three women in the neighbourhood who\r\nwould," said Lady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n"People always think charity--how I hate the word!--a means of\r\nforcing their own tenets down the throats of the poor," said Mrs.\r\nDuncombe.  "And certainly this neighbourhood is as narrow as any I\r\never saw.  Nobody but you and--shall I say the present company?--has\r\nany ideas.  I wonder how they will receive Clio Tallboys and her\r\nhusband?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! you have not heard about them," said Lady Tyrrell.  "Most\r\ndelightful people, whom Mrs. Duncombe met on the Righi.  He is a\r\nCambridge professor."\r\n\r\n"Taillebois--I don\'t remember the name," said Cecil, "and we know a\r\ngreat many Cambridge men.  We went to a Commencement there."\r\n\r\n"Oh, not Cambridge on the Cam! the American Cambridge," said Mrs.\r\nDuncombe.  "He is a quiet, inoffensive man, great on political\r\neconomy; but his wife is the character.  Wonderfully brilliant and\r\noriginal, and such a lecturer!"\r\n\r\n"Ladies\' lectures _would_ startle the natives," said Lady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n"Besides, the town-hall is lacking," said Mrs. Duncombe; "but when\r\nthe Tallboys come we might arrange a succession of soirees, where\r\nshe might gather her audience."\r\n\r\n"But where?" said Lady Tyrrell.  "It would be great fun, and you\r\nmight reckon on me; but where else?  Mrs. Charnock Poynsett has to\r\nthink of la belle mere."\r\n\r\n"She has given up the management of all matters of society to me,"\r\nsaid Cecil with dignity; "you may reckon on me."\r\n\r\n"No hope of the Bowaters, of course," said Mrs. Duncombe.\r\n\r\n"Miss Bowater is coming to stay with us," volunteered Cecil.\r\n\r\n"To be near that unlucky Life Guardsman manque," said Mrs. Duncombe.\r\n\r\n"Come, I\'ll not have honest Herbert abused," said the other lady.\r\n"He is the only one of the Bowaters who has any go in him."\r\n\r\n"More\'s the pity, if he can\'t use it.  Is his sister coming to help\r\nthe Reverend Julius to drill him?"\r\n\r\n"On Mrs. Poynsett\'s account too, I fancy," said Lady Tyrrell; "Jenny\r\nBowater is her amateur companion.  Indeed, I believe it was no\r\nslight disappointment that her sons\' appreciation did not quite\r\nreach the pitch of the mother\'s."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" asked Mrs. Duncombe; "I thought there had been a foolish\r\naffair with poor young Douglas."\r\n\r\n"Cela n\'empeche pas.  By the bye, have you finished Fleurange?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you are quite welcome to it.  It is quite as goody as an\r\nEnglish tale in one volume."\r\n\r\nThis opened the way to Cecil\'s desire to borrow Lanfrey, not\r\nconcealing the reason why; and she was gratified by the full\r\nsympathy of both ladies, who invited her in self-defence to join in\r\ntheir subscription to Rolandi, to which she eagerly agreed, and\r\nwould have paid her subscription at once if there had not been a\r\nterm to be finished off first.\r\n\r\nThe gong summoned them to luncheon, and likewise brought down Miss\r\nVivian, who shook hands rather stiffly, and wore a cold, grave\r\nmanner that did not sit badly on her handsome classical features.\r\nThe countenance was very fine, but of the style to which early youth\r\nis less favourable than a more mature development; and she was less\r\nuniversally admired than was her sister.  Her dress was a dark\r\nmaroon merino, hanging in simple, long, straight folds, and there\r\nwas as little distortion in her coiffure as the most moderate\r\ncompliance with fashion permitted; and this, with a high-bred,\r\ndistinguished deportment, gave an air almost of stern severity.\r\nThis deepened rather than relaxed at the greeting from Frank--who,\r\npoor fellow! had an uncontrollably wistful eager look in his face, a\r\nsort of shy entreaty, and was under an incapacity of keeping up a\r\nconversation with anybody else, while trying to catch the least word\r\nof hers.\r\n\r\nShe, however, seemed to have more eyes and ears for her father than\r\nfor any one else, and he evidently viewed her as the darling and\r\ntreasure of his life.  His first question, after performing the\r\nduties of a host, was, "Well, my little Lenore, what have you been\r\ndoing?"\r\n\r\n"The old story, papa," raising her clear, sweet voice to reach his\r\nrather deaf ears.\r\n\r\n"Got on with your drawing?--The child is competing with a club, you\r\nmust know."\r\n\r\n"Not exactly, papa:  it is only a little society that was set on\r\nfoot at Rockpier to help us to improve ourselves."\r\n\r\n"What is your subject this month?" Frank asked.\r\n\r\n"A branch of blackberries," she answered briefly.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Lady Tyrrell, "I saw your pupil bringing in a delicious\r\nfestoon--all black and red fruit and crimson and purple leaves.  He\r\nis really a boy of taste; I think he will do you credit."\r\n\r\n"The new Joshua Reynolds," said Frank, glad of an excuse to turn\r\ntowards Eleonora.  "Rosamond mentioned her discovery."\r\n\r\n"You might have seen him just now figuring as Buttons," said Lady\r\nTyrrell.  "Degradation of art, is it not?  But it was the only way\r\nto save it.  Lenore is teaching him; and if his talent prove worth\r\nit we may do something with him.  Any way, the produce of native\r\ngenius will be grand material for the bazaar."\r\n\r\n"Card-board prettinesses!" said Mrs. Duncombe; "you spoil him with\r\nthem; but that you\'ll do any way--make him fit for nothing but a\r\nflunkey."\r\n\r\n"Unappreciated zeal!" said Lady Tyrrell, glancing at her sister, who\r\nflushed a little, and looked the more grave.\r\n\r\n"Eh, Lenore," said her father, "wasn\'t it to please you that Camilla\r\nmade me take your pet to make havoc of my glasses?"\r\n\r\n"You meant it so, dear papa," said Eleonora, calling up a smile that\r\nsatisfied the old gentleman.  "It was very kind in you."\r\n\r\nFresh subjects were started, and on all the talk was lively and\r\npleasant, and fascinated Cecil, not from any reminiscence of\r\nDunstone--for indeed nothing could be more unlike the tone that\r\nprevailed there:  but because it was so different from that of\r\nCompton Poynsett, drifting on so unrestrainedly, and touching so\r\nlightly on all topics.\r\n\r\nBy the close of the meal, rain had set in, evidently for the\r\nafternoon.  Frank offered to ride home, and send the carriage for\r\nCecil; but the Duncombes proposed to take her and drop her at home;\r\nand to this she consented, rather to Frank\'s dismay, as he thought\r\nof their coach appearing at his mother\'s door.\r\n\r\nLady Tyrrell took her up to resume her hat; and on the way, moved by\r\ndistaste to her double surname, and drawn on by a fresh access of\r\nintimacy, she begged to be called Cecil--a privilege of which she\r\nhad been chary even in her maiden days; but the caressing manner had\r\nwon her heart, and spirit of opposition to the discouragement at\r\nhome did the rest.\r\n\r\nThe request was reciprocated with that pensive look which was so\r\ntouching.  "I used to be Camilla to all the neighbourhood, and here\r\nI find myself--miles\'--no, leagues further off--banished to\r\nSiberia."\r\n\r\n"How unjust and unkind!" cried Cecil.\r\n\r\n"My dear, you have yet to learn the gentle uncharitableness of\r\nprejudice.  It is the prevailing notion that my married life was a\r\ncareer of dissipation.  Ah! if they only knew!"\r\n\r\n"The drag is round," said Mrs. Duncombe\'s voice at the door, in all\r\nits decisive abruptness, making both start.\r\n\r\n"Just ready," called Lady Tyrrell; adding, in a lower tone, "Ah! she\r\nis startling, but she is genuine!  And one must take new friends\r\nwhen the old are chilly.  She is the only one--"\r\n\r\nCecil\'s kiss was more hearty than any she had given at Compton, and\r\nshe descended; but just as she came to the door, and was only\r\ndelaying while Frank and Captain Duncombe were discussing the merits\r\nof the four horses, the Compton carriage appeared in the approach,\r\nand Raymond\'s head within.  Lady Tyrrell looked at Cecil, and saw it\r\nwas safe to make a little gesture with the white skin of her fair\r\nbrow, expressing unutterable things.\r\n\r\nMrs. Duncombe lost no time in asking if any steps were being taken\r\nfor improving the drainage; to which Raymond replied, "No, that was\r\nnot the business in hand.  This was the architecture of the town-\r\nhall."\r\n\r\n"Splendour of municipality above, and fever festering below," said\r\nMrs. Duncombe.\r\n\r\n"Wilsborough is not unhealthy," said Raymond.\r\n\r\nShe laughed ironically.\r\n\r\n"The corporation have been told that they have an opportunity," said\r\nRaymond; "but it takes long to prepare people\'s minds to believe in\r\nthe expedience of such measures.  If Whitlock could be elected mayor\r\nthere would be some chance, but I am afraid they are sure to take\r\nTruelove; and as things are at Wilsborough, we must move all at once\r\nor not at all.  Individual attempts would do more harm than good."\r\n\r\n"Ah! you fear for your seat!" said the plain-spoken lady.\r\n\r\nRaymond only chose to answer by a laugh, and would not pursue the\r\nsubject so treated.  He was politeness itself to all; but he\r\nwithstood Lady Tyrrell\'s earnest entreaties to come in and see some\r\nFlorentine photographs, growing stiffer and graver each moment,\r\nwhile his wife waxed more wrathful at the treatment which she knew\r\nwas wounding her friend, and began almost to glory in having\r\nincurred his displeasure herself.  Indeed, this feeling caused the\r\nexchange of another kiss between the ladies before Sir Harry handed\r\nCecil into the carriage, and Raymond took the yellow paper books\r\nthat were held out to her.\r\n\r\nLooking at the title as they drove off, he said quietly, "I did not\r\nmean to deprive you, Cecil; I had ordered Lanfrey from Bennet for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nShe was somewhat abashed, but was excited enough to answer, "Thank\r\nyou.  I am going to join Lady Tyrrell and Mrs. Duncombe in a\r\nsubscription to Rolandi\'s."\r\n\r\nHe started, and after a pause of a few moments said gently, "Are you\r\nsure that Mr. and Mrs. Charnock would like to trust your choice of\r\nforeign books to Mrs. Duncombe?"\r\n\r\nTaking no notice of the point of this question, she replied, "If it\r\nis an object to exchange books at home faster than I can read them\r\nproperly, I must look for a supply elsewhere."\r\n\r\n"You had better subscribe alone," he replied, still without manifest\r\nprovocation.\r\n\r\n"That would be uncivil now."\r\n\r\n"I take that upon myself."\r\n\r\nWherewith there came a silence; while Cecil swelled as she thought\r\nof the prejudice against her friend, and Raymond revolved all he had\r\never heard about creatures he knew so little as women, to enable him\r\nto guess how to deal with this one.  How reprove so as not to make\r\nit worse?  Ought not his silent displeasure to suffice?  And in such\r\nmusings the carriage reached home.\r\n\r\nIt had been an untoward day.  He had been striving hard against the\r\nstream at Willansborough.  The drainage was not only scouted as an\r\nabsurd, unreasonable, and expensive fancy, but the architect whom he\r\nhad recommended, in the hope that he would insist on ground-work\r\nwhich might bring on the improvement, had been rejected in favour of\r\na kinsman of Mr. Briggs, the out-going mayor, a youth of the lower\r\nwalk of the profession--not the scholar and gentleman he had\r\ndesired, for the tradesman intellect fancied such a person would be\r\nexpensive and unmanageable.\r\n\r\nTwin plans for church and town-hall had been produced, which to\r\nRaymond\'s taste savoured of the gimcrack style, but which infinitely\r\ndelighted all the corporation; and where he was the only cultivated\r\ngentleman, except the timid Vicar, his reasonings were all in vain.\r\nThe plan was accepted for the town-hall, and the specifications were\r\nordered to be made out for competition, and a rate decided on.  The\r\nchurch was to wait for subscription and bazaar; the drains, for\r\nreason in Wil\'sbro\', or for the hope of the mayoralty of Mr.\r\nWhitlock, a very intelligent and superior linendraper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nRosamond\'s Apologue\r\n\r\n\r\nPray, sir, do you laugh at me?--Title of Old Caricature\r\n\r\nWas Cecil\'s allegiance to Dunstone, or was it to the heiress of\r\nDunstone?  Tests of allegiance consist in very small matters, and it\r\nis not always easy to see the turning-point.  Now Cecil had always\r\nstood on a pinnacle at Dunstone, and she had found neither its\r\nclaims nor her own recognized at Compton.  One kind of allegiance\r\nwould have remained on the level, and retained the same standard,\r\nwhether accepted or not.  Another would climb on any pinnacle that\r\nany one would erect for the purpose, and become alienated from\r\nwhatever interfered with such eminence.\r\n\r\nSo as nobody seemed so willing to own Cecil\'s claims to county\r\nsupremacy as Lady Tyrrell, her bias was all towards Sirenwood; and\r\nwhereas such practices as prevailed at Dunstone evidently were\r\nviewed as obsolete and narrow by these new friends, Cecil was\r\nwilling to prove herself superior to them, and was far more\r\nirritated than convinced when her husband appealed to her former\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nThe separation of the welfare of body and soul had never occurred to\r\nthe beneficence of Dunstone, and it cost Cecil a qualm to accept it;\r\nbut she could not be a goody in the eyes of Sirenwood; and besides,\r\nshe was reading some contemporary literature, which made it plain\r\nthat any religious instruction was a most unjustifiable interference\r\nwith the great law, "Am I my brother\'s keeper?" and so, when she met\r\nAnne with a handful of texts neatly written out in printing letters,\r\nshe administered her warning.\r\n\r\nCecil and Anne had become allies to a certain extent, chiefly\r\nthrough their joint disapproval of Rosamond, not to say of Julius;\r\nand the order was so amazing that Anne did not at first take it in;\r\nand when she understood that all mention of religion was forbidden,\r\nshe said, "I do not think I ought to yield in this."\r\n\r\n"Surely," said Cecil, "there is no connection between piety and\r\ncutting out."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Anne; "but it does not seem to me to be right\r\nto go on with a work where my Master\'s Name is forbidden."\r\n\r\n"Religion ought never to be obtruded," said Cecil.\r\n\r\n"The Word ought to flavour everything, in season or out of season,"\r\nsaid Anne, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"Oh! that\'s impossible.  It\'s your narrow view.  If you thrust\r\npreaching into everything, we can never work together."\r\n\r\n"Oh, then," said Anne, quickly, "I must give it up!"  And she turned\r\naway with a rapid step, to carry her texts back to her room.\r\n\r\n"Anne!" called Cecil, "I did not mean _that_!"\r\n\r\nAnne paused for a moment, looked over the baluster, and repeated\r\nfirmly, "No, Cecil; it would be denying Christ to work where His\r\nName is forbidden."\r\n\r\nPerhaps there was something in the elevation and the carved rail\r\nthat gave the idea of a pulpit, for Cecil felt as if she was being\r\npreached at, and turned her back, indignant and vexed at what she\r\nhad by no means intended to incur--the loss of such a useful\r\nassistant as she found in Anne.\r\n\r\n"Such nonsense!" she said to herself, as she crossed the hall alone,\r\nthere meeting with Rosamond, equipped for the village.  "Is not Anne\r\ngoing to-day?" she said, as she saw the pony-carriage at the door.\r\n\r\n"No.  It is so vexatious.  She is so determined upon preaching to\r\nthe women, that I have been obliged to put a stop to it."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!  I should not have thought it of poor Anne; but no one can\r\ntell what those semi-dissenters think right."\r\n\r\n"When she declared she ought to do it in season or out of season,\r\nwhat was one to do?" said Cecil.\r\n\r\n"I thought that was for clergymen," said Rosamond, hitting the right\r\nnail on the head in her ignorance, as so often happened.\r\n\r\n"She sees no difference," said Cecil.  "Shall I drive you down?" she\r\nadded graciously, according to the fashion of uniting with one\r\nsister-in-law against the other; and Rosamond not only accepted, but\r\nasked to be taken on to Willansborough, to buy a birthday present\r\nfor her brother Terry, get stamps for an Indian letter, and perform\r\na dozen more commissions that seemed to arise in her mind with the\r\nopportunity.  Her two brothers were to spend the Christmas holidays\r\nwith her, and she was in high spirits, and so communicative about\r\nthem that she hardly observed how little interest Cecil took in\r\nTerry\'s achievements.\r\n\r\n"Who is that," she presently asked, "with those red-haired children?\r\nIt looked like Miss Vivian\'s figure."\r\n\r\n"I believe it was.  Julius and I often see her walking about the\r\nlanes; but she passes like--like a fire-flaught, whatever that is--\r\njust bows, and hardly ever speaks."\r\n\r\n"She is a strange girl," said Cecil.  "Lady Tyrrell says she cannot\r\ndraw her into any of her interests, but she will go her own way."\r\n\r\n"Like poor Anne?"\r\n\r\n"No, not out of mere moping and want of intellect, like Anne.  But\r\nLady Tyrrell says she feels for her; she was brought a great deal\r\ntoo forward, and was made quite mistress of the house at Rockpier,\r\nbeing her father\'s darling and all, and now it is trying to her,\r\nthough it is quite wholesome, to be in her proper place.  It is a\r\npity she is so bitter over it, and flies off her own way."\r\n\r\n"That boy!" said Rosamond; "I hope she does something for his good."\r\n\r\n"She teaches him, I believe; but there\'s another instance of her\r\nstrange ways.  She was absolutely vexed when Lady Tyrrell took him\r\ninto the house, though he was her protege, only because it was not\r\ndone in _her_ way.  It is a great trial to Camilla."\r\n\r\n"I could fancy a reason for that," said Rosamond.  "Julius does not\r\nlike the tone of the household at all."  But she added hastily, "Who\r\ncould those children be?  They did not look _quite_ like poor\r\nchildren."\r\n\r\n"Ah! she is always taking up with some odd person in her own away,"\r\nsaid Cecil.  "But here we are.  Will you drive on to the hotel, or\r\nget out here?"\r\n\r\nWhen, at the end of two hours, the sisters-in-law met at the work-\r\nroom, and Rosamond had taken a survey of the row of needle-women,\r\ncoming up one by one to give their work, be paid and dismissed,\r\nthere was a look of weariness and vexation on Cecil\'s face.  She had\r\nfound it less easy to keep order and hinder gossip, and had hardly\r\nknown how to answer when that kind lady, Mrs. Miles Charnock, had\r\nbeen asked after; but she would have scorned to allow that she had\r\nmissed her assistant, and only politely asked how Rosamond had sped.\r\n\r\n"Oh! excellently.  People were so well advised as to be out, so I\r\npaid off all my calls."\r\n\r\n"You did not return your calls without Julius?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing he hates so much.  I would not have dragged him\r\nwith me on any account."\r\n\r\n"I think it is due to one\'s self."\r\n\r\n"Ah! but then I don\'t care what is due to myself.  I saw a friend of\r\nyours, Cecil."\r\n\r\n"Who?"\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Duncombe," said Rosamond.  "I went to Pettitt\'s--the little\r\nperfumer, you know, that Julius did so much for at the fire; and\r\nthere she was, leaning on the counter, haranguing him confidentially\r\nupon setting an example with sanatory measures."\r\n\r\n"Sanitary," corrected Cecil; "sanitas is health, sano to cure.\r\nPeople never know the difference."\r\n\r\n"Certainly I don\'t," said Rosamond.  "It must be microscopic!"\r\n\r\n"Only it shows the difference between culture and the reverse," said\r\nCecil.\r\n\r\n"Well, you know, I\'m the reverse," said Rosamond, leaning sleepily\r\nback, and becoming silent; but Cecil was too anxious for\r\nintelligence to let her rest, and asked on what Mrs. Duncombe was\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n"I am not quite sure--she was stirring up his public spirit, I\r\nthink, about the drainage; and they were both of them deploring the\r\nslackness and insensibility of the corporation, and canvassing for\r\nMr. Whitlock, as I believe.  It struck me as a funny subject for a\r\nlady, but I believe she does not stick at trifles."\r\n\r\n"No real work can be carried out by those who do," said Cecil.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" added Rosamond, "I met Mrs. and Miss Bowater, and they desired\r\nme to say that Jenny can\'t come till the dinner-party on the 20th,\r\nand then they will leave her."\r\n\r\n"How cool to send a message instead of writing!"\r\n\r\n"Oh! she has always been like one of themselves, like a sister to\r\nthem all."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t bear that sort of people."\r\n\r\n"What sort?"\r\n\r\n"Who worm themselves in."\r\n\r\n"Miss Bowater could have no occasion for worming.  They must be\r\nquite on equal terms."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, she was only engaged to their poor relation."\r\n\r\n"What poor relation?  Tell me!  Who told you?"\r\n\r\n"Raymond.  It was a young attorney--a kind of cousin of the Poynsett\r\nside, named Douglas."\r\n\r\n"What?  There\'s a cross in the churchyard to Elizabeth Douglas,\r\ndaughter of Francis Poynsett, and wife of James Douglas, and at the\r\nbottom another inscription to Archibald Douglas, her son, lost in\r\nthe Hippolyta."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that must be the man.  He was flying from England, having been\r\nsuspected of some embezzlement."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!  And was Jenny engaged to him?  Julius told me that Mrs.\r\nDouglas had been his mother\'s dearest friend, and that this Archie\r\nhad been brought up with them, but he did not say any more."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he did not like having had a cousin in an attorney\'s\r\noffice.  I am sure I had no notion of such a thing."\r\n\r\nRosamond laughed till she was exhausted at the notion of Julius\'s\r\nsharing the fastidious objections she heard in Cecil\'s voice; and\r\nthen, struck by the sadness of the story, she cried, "And that makes\r\nthem all so fond of Miss Bowater.  Poor girl, what must she not have\r\ngone through!  And yet how cheerful she does look!"\r\n\r\n"People say," proceeded Cecil, unable to resist the impulse to\r\nacquire a partaker in her half-jealous aversion, "that it was a\r\ngreat disappointment that Mrs. Poynsett could not make her sons like\r\nher as much as she did herself."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" cried Rosamond, "how little peace we should have if we always\r\nheeded what people say!"\r\n\r\n"People that know," persisted Cecil.\r\n\r\n"Not very wise or very kind people to say so," quoth Rosamond;\r\n"though, by the bye, the intended sting is happily lost, considering\r\nthat it lies among five."\r\n\r\n"Why should you assume a sting?"\r\n\r\n"Because I see you are stung, and want to sting me," said Rosamond,\r\nin so merry a tone that the earnestness was disguised.\r\n\r\n"I!  I\'m not stung!  What Mrs. Poynsett or Miss Bowater may have\r\nschemed is nothing to me," said Cecil, with all her childish\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n"People talk of Irish imagination," said Rosamond in her lazy\r\nmeditative tone.\r\n\r\n"Well?" demanded Cecil, sharply.\r\n\r\n"Only it is not _my_ Irish imagination that has devised this\r\ndreadful picture of the artful Jenny and Mrs. Poynsett spinning\r\ntheir toils to entrap the whole five brothers.  Come, Cecil, take my\r\nadvice and put it out of your head.  Suppose it were true, small\r\nblame to Mrs. Poynsett."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" said Cecil, in a voice of hurt dignity.\r\n\r\n"I may mean myself."  And Rosamond\'s peal of merry laughter was most\r\namazing and inexplicable to her companion, who was not sure that she\r\nwas not presuming to laugh at her.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, broken at last by Rosamond.  "Cecil, I have\r\nbeen tumbled about the world a good deal more than you have, and I\r\nnever found that one got any good by disregarding the warnings of\r\nthe natives.  There\'s an immense deal in the cat and the cock."\r\n\r\n"I do not understand, said Cecil.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Rosamond, in a voice as if she were telling the story to a\r\nsmall child, began:  "Once upon a time there was a wee bit\r\nmousiekie, that lived in Giberatie O--that trotted out of her hole\r\nupon an exploring expedition.  By and by she came scuttling back in\r\na state of great trepidation--in fact, horribly nervous.  \'Mother,\r\nmother!\' said the little mouse, \'I\'ve seen a hideous monster, with a\r\nred face, and a voice like a trumpet, and a pair of spurs.\'"\r\n\r\n"Of course, I know that," broke in Cecil.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you haven\'t heard all.  \'I should have died of terror,\' said\r\nthe little mouse, \'only that I saw a dear sweet graceful creature,\r\nwith a lovely soft voice, and a smooth coat, and the most beautiful\r\neyes, and the most exquisite pathetic expression in her smile; and\r\nshe held out her velvet paw to me, and said, \'Dear little mousiekie-\r\npousie, you\'re the loveliest creature I ever met, quite\r\nunappreciated in these parts.  That horrid old cock is terribly\r\nvulgar and commonplace; and never you believe your mother if she\r\ntells you he is better worth cultivating than one who has such a\r\ndeep genuine love and appreciation of all the excellences of all\r\nmice, and of you in particular with your dun fur.\'"\r\n\r\nRosamond could not for her very life help putting in that word dun;\r\nand Cecil, who had been driving straight on with her eyes fixed on\r\nher pony\'s ears, and rather a sullen expression of forced endurance,\r\nfaced about.  "What you mean by all this I don\'t know; but if you\r\nthink it applies to me or my friends, you are much mistaken."\r\n\r\n"I told you," said Rosamond, with the same languor, looking out\r\nunder her half-shut eyes, "that I apply things to myself.  I\'ve met\r\nboth sorts in my time."\r\n\r\nAnd silence reigned for the rest of the way.  Cecil had read many\r\nmore books, knew much more, and was altogether a far more cultivated\r\npersonage than the Lady Rosamond; but she was not half so ready in\r\ncatching the import of spoken words; and all this time she was by no\r\nmeans certain whether all this meant warning or meant mockery,\r\nthough either was equally impertinent, and must be met with the same\r\nlady-like indifference, which Cecil trusted that she had never\r\ntransgressed.\r\n\r\nNeither of them, nor indeed any other living creature, knew of a\r\nlittle episode which had occurred about eighteen months previously,\r\nwhen Joanna Bowater had been taking care of Mrs Poynsett during\r\nRaymond\'s first absence from home after her accident.  Of course he\r\ntook her back to Strawyers as soon as he arrived; and about half-\r\nway, after a prolonged and unusual silence, he said, "Jenny, I\r\nbelieve we know one another\'s histories pretty well.  It would be a\r\ngreat happiness and blessing if you could bring yourself to sink the\r\npast so far as to take me, and become indeed my mother\'s daughter.\r\nDo not answer me in haste.  Think it over, and tell me if it is\r\npossible."\r\n\r\nJenny let him drive on more than a mile before she spoke; and when\r\nshe did, the tears stood on her cheek, and it was quite an effort\r\nthat her voice was made steady.  "No, Raymond, I am very sorry, but\r\nit will not do.  Two griefs will not make one joy."\r\n\r\n"Yes, they would, to my mother."\r\n\r\n"Ah! there it lies!  Indeed, Raymond, I do feel for you all so much,\r\nespecially your dear mother, that I would bring myself to it, if I\r\ncould; but the very thought brings Archie up so vividly before me\r\nthat I cannot!  He has almost seemed to be sitting by me all this\r\ntime.  It seems as though beginning again would kill my right to\r\nthink of him foremost of all."\r\n\r\n"I could bear with that and trust to time," said Raymond.  "Think it\r\nover, Jenny.  I will be candid with you.  The old delusion was too\r\nstrong for any repetition of that kind, as you may see by the lame\r\nperformance I am making now."\r\n\r\nJenny gave a little agitated laugh, and ejaculated, "Dear Raymond!"\r\nthen added, "It is not on your account, but mine."\r\n\r\n"But," he added, "my marriage is becoming a necessity, if only for\r\nmy mother\'s sake; and you stand far before any other woman with me,\r\nif that would but satisfy you.  I verily believe that in a short\r\ntime we should be just as comfortable together as if we could start\r\nwith more romance."\r\n\r\n"I dare say we should, dear Raymond," said Jenny; "but I cannot feel\r\nthat it is the right thing, while I have not _that_ feeling for you\r\nwhich overpowers everything else; it seems to me that I ought not to\r\ngive up my place at home.  Papa depends on me a good deal, and they\r\nboth will want me more and more."\r\n\r\n"Less than my mother."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; and they are my first duty.  I can always come to\r\nyour mother when I am wanted, and I know in your secret soul you\r\nprefer me on those terms."\r\n\r\nHe made no answer, only when passing the lodge he said, "Will you\r\nconsider it a little longer, Jenny?"\r\n\r\nBut this only resulted in a note:--\r\n\r\n"DEAR RAYMOND,--Considering only shows me that I must be Archie\r\nDouglas\'s now and for ever.  I can\'t help it.  It is better for\r\nyou; for you can find some young girl who can wake your heart\r\nagain, as never could be done by your still affectionate J. B."\r\n\r\nRaymond and Jenny had met so often since, that the matter was\r\nentirely past, and no one ever guessed it.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, Rosamond, the most ready to plunge into counsel to\r\nCecil, was the least likely to have it accepted; Rosamond had\r\nfoibles of her own that Cecil knew of, and censured freely enough\r\nwithin herself.\r\n\r\nThat never-ending question, whether what became the Colonel\'s\r\ndaughter became the clergyman\'s wife, would crop up under endless\r\nforms.  Rosamond, in all opinions, was good-natured and easy, and\r\nalways for pardon and toleration to an extent that the Compton code\r\ncould not understand.  She could not bear that anybody should be\r\npunished or shut out of anything; while there was no denying that,\r\nnow the first novelty was passing, she was very lazy as to her\r\nparochial work, and that where her feelings were not stirred she was\r\nof little use.\r\n\r\nJulius seemed shamefully tolerant of her omissions, and likewise of\r\nher eagerness for all gaieties.  He would not go himself, would not\r\naccept a dinner invitation for any of the three busy nights of the\r\nweek, and refused all those to dances and balls for himself, though\r\nhe never hindered Rosamond\'s going.\r\n\r\nShe used absolutely to cry with passionate entreaties that he would\r\nrelent and come with her, declaring that he was very unkind, he knew\r\nit took away all her pleasure--he was a tyrant, and wanted her not\r\nto go.  And then he smiled, and owned that he hoped some day she\r\nwould be tired of it; whereat she raged, and begged him to forbid\r\nher, if he really thought her whole life had been so shocking,\r\ndeclaring in the same breath that she would never disown her family,\r\nor cast a slur on her mother and sisters.\r\n\r\nIt always ended in her going, and though never again offending as by\r\nher bridal gown, she seldom failed to scandalize Cecil by an excess\r\nof talking and of waltzing, such as even Raymond regretted, and\r\nwhich disabled her for a whole day after from all but sofa, sleep,\r\nnovels, and yawns.\r\n\r\nWas this the person whose advice the discreet heiress of Dunstone\r\nwas likely to follow?\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned here, among other elements of difficulty, that\r\nCecil\'s maid Grindstone was a thorough Dunstonite, who \'kept herself\r\nto herself,\' was perfectly irreproachable, lived on terms of distant\r\ncivility with the rest of the household, never complained, but\r\nconstantly led her young mistress to understand that she was\r\nenduring much for her sake.\r\n\r\nCecil was too well trained, and so was she, for a word of gossip or\r\ncensure to pass between them; but the influence was not the less\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\nPastoral Visiting\r\n\r\n\r\nA finger\'s breadth at hand may mar\r\nA world of light in heaven afar;\r\nA mote eclipse a glorious star,\r\n   An eyelid hide the sky.--KEBLE.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was over, and Cecil was favouring the audience with a\r\nseverely classical piece of music, when, under cover thereof, a low\r\nvoice said to Julius, "Now, really and truly, tell me how he is\r\ngetting on?"\r\n\r\n"Really and truly, Jenny?"\r\n\r\n"Well, not as you would tell mamma, for instance; but as you think\r\nin your secret soul."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry you think me so duplex."\r\n\r\n"Come, you understand how anxious I am about the boy."\r\n\r\n"Exactly."  And they both laughed.\r\n\r\n"Is that all?" said Joanna Bowater.\r\n\r\n"_Really and truly_ it is!  Rose can manage him much better than I\r\ncan."\r\n\r\n"He is very fond of her; but does he--is he--is his heart in his\r\nwork?" asked the sister, looking with her honest eyes earnestly at\r\nJulius, her contemporary and playfellow as a child, and afterwards\r\nthe companion with whom she had worked out many a deep problem,\r\nrendering mutual assistance that made each enter in no common degree\r\ninto the inner thoughts of the other.\r\n\r\nJulius smiled.  "I doubt whether he has come to his heart yet."\r\n\r\n"Why should he be so young?  Think what you were at twenty-three."\r\n\r\n"I never had Herbert\'s physique; and that makes an immense\r\ndifference.  I had no taste or capacity for what is a great\r\nprivation to a fine young fellow like him.  Don\'t look startled!  He\r\nattempts nothing unfitting; he is too good and dutiful, but--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know what that _but_ means."\r\n\r\n"Nothing to be unhappy about.  You know how blameless he has always\r\nbeen at Eton and Oxford; and though he may view his work rather in a\r\nschool-boy aspect, and me as a taskmaster, as long as he is doing\r\nright the growth is going on.  Don\'t be unhappy, Jenny!  His great\r\nclear young voice is delightful to hear; he is capital at choral\r\npractices, and is a hero to all the old women and boys, the more so\r\nfor the qualities that earnestness cannot give, but rather detracts\r\nfrom."\r\n\r\n"You mean that he is not in earnest?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t pervert all I say!  He is not past the time of life when all\r\nappointed work seems a task, and any sort of excuse a valid cause\r\nagainst it; but he is conscientious, and always good-humoured under\r\na scolding,--and Rosamond does not spare him," he added, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Then you don\'t think there has been a mistake about him?" said\r\nJenny, in a low voice of alarm.\r\n\r\n"I have little doubt that when anything develops his inner life, so\r\nas to overcome the great strong animal that demands play and\r\nexercise, he will be a most useful clergyman."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he is too young, though I don\'t see how it could be helped.\r\nPapa always intended it, because of the living; and Herbert never\r\nwished anything else.  I thought he really desired it, but now I\r\ndon\'t know whether he did not only take it as a matter of course."\r\n\r\n"Obedience is no unwholesome motive.  As things stood, to delay his\r\nordination would have been a stigma he did not deserve; and though\r\nhe might have spent a year with advantage in a theological college,\r\npupilage might only have prolonged his boyhood.  It must be\r\nexperience, not simply years of study, that deepens him."\r\n\r\n"Ah, those studies!"\r\n\r\n"To tell the truth, that\'s what I am most uneasy about.  I take care\r\nhe should have two hours every forenoon, and three evenings every\r\nweek, free; but when a man is in his own neighbourhood, and so\r\npopular, I am afraid he does not get many evenings at home; and I\r\ncan\'t hinder Bindon from admonishing him."\r\n\r\n"No," said the sister; "nothing will stir him till the examination\r\nis imminent; but I will try what I can do with him for the present.\r\nHere he comes, the dear old idle fellow!"\r\n\r\n"Joanie, here you are at last, in conclave with the Rector.  Lady\r\nRose wants me to sing, and you must accompany me.  No one is so\r\njolly for picking one up."\r\n\r\n\'Picking one up\' was apt to be needed by Herbert, who had a good ear\r\nand voice, but had always regarded it as \'bosh\' to cultivate them,\r\nexcept for the immediately practical purposes that had of late been\r\nforced on him.  The choral society had improved him; but Jenny was\r\ntaken aback by being called on to accompany him in Mrs. Brown\'s\r\nLuggage; and his father made his way up to him, saying, "Eh,\r\nHerbert! is that the last clerical fashion?"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis my Rectoress who sets me on, sir," was Herbert\'s merry answer,\r\nlooking at her.  "Now, Lady Rose, you\'ll keep me in countenance!  My\r\nfather has never heard you sing Coming through the Rye."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Herbert, my singing is only to amuse little boys.  Here\'s\r\nthe higher order of art!"\r\n\r\nFor Cecil was leading a young lady to the piano, and looking as if\r\nshe by no means approved of such folly, though everybody had\r\nlistened to the Poor Old Cockatoo, laughed and applauded heartily;\r\nand the ensuing performance seemed to be unappreciated by any one\r\nexcept Raymond and Cecil themselves.\r\n\r\nAnne was sitting in a corner of the sofa, with a straight back and\r\nweary face, having been driven out into the throng by the old\r\nfriends who came to sit with Mrs. Poynsett; but she brightened as\r\nMiss Bowater took a seat beside her, and accepted her inquiries for\r\nCaptain Charnock far more graciously than the many which had\r\npreceded them.  Was not her likeness in his album?  And had he not\r\nspoken of her as one whom Anne would like?\r\n\r\nSoon Joanna had led her to tell not only of Miles\'s last letter, but\r\nof those from Glen Fraser, of which she had spoken to no one, under\r\nthe impression that nobody cared.  She even spoke of the excellent\r\nfarm and homestead which Mr. Van Dorp wanted to sell before going to\r\nthe Free State, and which her father thought would exactly suit\r\nMiles.\r\n\r\n"Does he mean to settle there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; he promised me to leave the navy and take me home as soon\r\nas this voyage is over," said Anne, eagerly.  "If the Salamanca only\r\nputs in for long enough, he might run up to Glen Fraser, and see\r\nBocksfeld Stoop, and settle it all at once.  I am sure he would be\r\ndelighted with it, and it is only two miles from Mr. Pilgrim\'s."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid you can never feel this like home," said Jenny.\r\n\r\n"Miles wanted me to know his family, and thought I should be useful\r\nto his mother," said Anne; "but she does not want anything I could\r\ndo for her.  If she has Raymond, she seems to need nobody else."\r\n\r\n"And have you nothing to do?"\r\n\r\n"I have letters to write to Miles and to them all at home; and I am\r\nmaking a whole set of shirts and stockings for papa and the boys--it\r\nwill spare mamma and Jeanie, and I have plenty of time."\r\n\r\n"Too much, I am afraid!  But Herbert said you were very useful at\r\nthe Work Society at Wil\'sbro\'."\r\n\r\n"Not now."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"No," in the old cold dry tone.  But while Jenny was doubting\r\nwhether to inquire further, innate sympathy conquered, and Anne\r\nadded, "I wonder whether I did wrong!"\r\n\r\n"As how?" asked Joanna, kindly.\r\n\r\n"They said"--she lowered her voice--"I must never speak on religious\r\nsubjects."\r\n\r\n"How do you mean?  What had you done?"\r\n\r\n"One day I found a woman crying because her husband had gone away to\r\nseek work, so I told her my husband was further away and repeated\r\nthe texts I like.  She was so much comforted that I printed them on\r\na card for her."\r\n\r\n"Was that all?"\r\n\r\n"No; there was another poor dear that was unhappy about her baby;\r\nand when I bade her pray for it, she did not know how, so I had to\r\ntell her a little.  There is one who does know her Saviour, and I\r\ndid love to have a few words of peace with her."\r\n\r\n"And was that what was objected to?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; they said it would change the whole character of the\r\ninstitution."\r\n\r\n"Who did?"\r\n\r\n"Cecil--Mrs. Charnock Poynsett.  I think Lady Tyrrell and Mrs.\r\nDuncombe desired her.  I thought it was no place for me where I\r\nmight not speak one word for Christ, and I said so; but since I have\r\nwondered whether the old Adam did not speak in me, and I ought to\r\nhave gone on."\r\n\r\n"My wonder," said Jenny, indignantly, "would be what right they had\r\nto stop you.  This was private interference, not from the Vicar or\r\nthe committee."\r\n\r\n"But I am not a real visiting lady.  I only go to help Cecil."\r\n\r\n"I see; but why didn\'t you ask Julius what was right?  He would have\r\ntold you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, I could not."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"It would seem like a complaint of Cecil.  Besides--"\r\n\r\n"Besides?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Julius is a Christian."\r\n\r\nThe startling announcement was made in so humble and mournful a\r\nvoice as almost to disarm Jenny\'s resentment; and before she had\r\nrecovered enough for a reply, she was called to take leave of her\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nHer brother was the professed object of her visit, and she was only\r\nat the Hall because there was no accommodation at his lodgings, so\r\nthat she had no scruple in joining the early breakfast spread for\r\nthe Rector and his wife, so as to have the morning free for him; but\r\nshe found Julius alone, saying that his wife was tired after the\r\nparty; and to Jenny\'s offer to take her class, he replied, "Thank\r\nyou, it will be a great kindness if you will teach; but Rose has no\r\nregular class.  Teaching is not much in her line; and it is a pity\r\nshe should have to do it, but we have to make the most of the single\r\nhour they allow us for godliness."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you utilize Mrs. Charnock? or is she not strong enough for\r\nearly hours?"\r\n\r\n"Poor Anne!  The truth is, I am afraid of her.  I fancy all her\r\ndoctrine comes out of the Westminster Catechism."\r\n\r\n"Could Calvinism be put in at seven years old?  Would not it be a\r\npouring of stiff glue into a narrow-necked phial?"\r\n\r\n"Result--nil."\r\n\r\n"A few pure drops might got in--and you could give her books."\r\n\r\n"It had struck me that it might be wholesome work for her; but the\r\nchildren\'s good must stand first.  And, timid and reserved as she\r\nseems, she insisted on preaching at the work-room, so that Cecil had\r\nto put a stop to it."\r\n\r\n"Are you certain about that preaching?"\r\n\r\n"Rose heard of it from Cecil herself."\r\n\r\n"Did she ask what it amounted to?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; perhaps I had better find out.  I remember it came\r\nafter that ride to Sirenwood.  By the bye, Jenny, I wish Cecil could\r\nbe hindered from throwing herself into that oak of Broceliande!"\r\n\r\n"Are not you so suspicious that you see the waving arms and magic\r\ncircles everywhere?"\r\n\r\n"A friendship with any one here is so unnatural, that I can\'t but\r\nthink it a waving of hands boding no good.  And there is worse than\r\nfriendship in that quarter too."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but Lenore is quite different!"\r\n\r\n"A Vivienne still!" said Julius, bitterly.  "If she costs poor Frank\r\nnothing more than his appointment, it will be well."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand!"\r\n\r\n"She caught him in her toils two years ago at Rockpier; and now she\r\nis playing fast and loose with him--withdrawing, as I believe; and\r\nat any rate keeping the poor foolish boy in such an agitation, that\r\nhe can\'t or won\'t settle to his reading; and Driver thinks he will\r\nbreak down."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t think it of Lenore.--Oh! good morning, Raymond!"\r\n\r\n"Good morning!  May I come to breakfast number one?  I have to go to\r\nBacksworth."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Jenny; "we told papa it was too bad to put you on the\r\nPrison Committee.  What does your wife say?"\r\n\r\n"My wife has so many occupations, that she is very sufficient for\r\nherself," said Raymond.  "I hope you will get on with her, Jenny.\r\nIf she could only be got to think you intellectual!"\r\n\r\n"Me?  O, Raymond! you\'ve not been telling her so?" exclaimed Jenny,\r\nlaughing heartily.\r\n\r\n"A very superior coach in divinity, &c.," said Julius, in a tone\r\nhalf banter, half earnest.\r\n\r\nBut Jenny exclaimed in distress, "No, no, no; say nothing about\r\nthat!  It would never do for Herbert to have it known.  Don\'t let\r\nhim guess that you know."\r\n\r\n"Quite right, Jenny; never fear," said Julius; "though it is\r\ntempting to ask you to take Frank in hand at the same time."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen anything of the Vivians?" asked Raymond.\r\n\r\n"Very little.  I hoped to see something of Eleonora from hence."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t understand that young lady," said Julius.  "She was very\r\nfriendly when first we met her; but now she seems absolutely\r\nrepellant."\r\n\r\n"Tant mieux," Raymond\r\n\r\n"They seem inclined to take up all the good works in hand," said\r\nJenny.  "By the bye, what is all this story about Raymond affronting\r\nWil\'sbro\' by stirring up their gutters?  Papa has been quite in a\r\nstate of mind for fear they should take offence and bring in Mr.\r\nMoy."\r\n\r\n"Julius only thinks I have not stirred the gutters enough," said\r\nRaymond.  "And after all, it is not I, but Whitlock.  I was in hopes\r\nthat matters might have been properly looked after if Whitlock had\r\nbeen chosen mayor this year; but, somehow, a cry was got up that he\r\nwas going to bring down a sanitary commission, and put the town to\r\ngreat expense; and actually, this town-council have been elected\r\n_because_ they are opposed to drainage."\r\n\r\n"And Truelove, the grocer, is mayor?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; one of the most impracticable men I ever encountered.  One\r\ncan\'t get him so much as to understand anything.  Now Briggs does\r\nunderstand, only he goes by pounds s. d."\r\n\r\n"Posterity has done nothing for me, and I will do nothing for\r\nposterity, is his principle," said Julius.  "Moreover, he is a\r\nBaptist."\r\n\r\n"No chance for the Church in his time," said Jenny.\r\n\r\n"There\'s the less harm in that," said Raymond, "that the plan is\r\nintolerable.  Briggs\'s nephew took the plan of what he calls a\r\nGerman Rat-house, for the town-hall, made in gilt gingerbread; and\r\nthen adapted the church to a beautiful similarity.  If that could be\r\nstaved off by waiting for the bazaar, or by any other means, there\r\nmight be a chance of something better.  So poor Fuller thinks,\r\nthough he is not man enough to speak out at once."\r\n\r\n"Then the bazaar is really fixed?"\r\n\r\n"So far as the resolution goes of the lady population, though Julius\r\nis sanguine, and hopes to avert it.  After all, I believe the\r\ngreatest obstructive to improvement is Moy."\r\n\r\n"Old Mr. Proudfoot\'s son-in-law?" said Jenny.  "I know he has\r\nblossomed out in great splendour on our side of the county, and his\r\ndaughter is the general wonder.  Papa is always declaring he will\r\nset up in opposition to you."\r\n\r\n"Not much fear of that," said Raymond.  "But the man provokes me, he\r\nhas so much apparent seriousness."\r\n\r\n"Even to the persecution of Dr. Easterby," put in Julius.  "And yet\r\nhe is the great supporter of that abominable public-house in Water\r\nLane, the Three Pigeons--which, unluckily, escaped the fire.  He\r\nowns it, and all those miserable tenements beyond it, and nothing\r\nwill move him an inch towards doing any good there!"\r\n\r\n"I remember," said Jenny, "papa came home very angry on the\r\nlicensing day; the police had complained of the Three Pigeons, and\r\nthe magistrates would have taken away the license, but that Mr. Moy\r\nmade such a personal matter of it."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean that he is a magistrate!" exclaimed Julius.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Raymond.  "He got the ear of the Lord-Lieutenant."\r\n\r\n"And since he has lived at the Lawn, they have all quite set up for\r\ncounty people or anything you please," said Jenny, a little\r\nbitterly.  "Mrs. Moy drives about with the most stylish pair of\r\nponies; and as to Miss Gussie, she is making herself into a proverb!\r\nI can\'t bear them."\r\n\r\n"Well done, Jenny!" exclaimed Julius.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it is wrong," said Jenny, in a low voice.  "I dare say I am\r\nnot just.  You know I always did think Mr. Moy could have cleared\r\nArchie if he would," she added, with a slightly trembling tone.\r\n\r\n"So did I," said Raymond.  "I gave him the opportunity after George\r\nProudfoot\'s death; but when the choice lay between two memories, one\r\ncould hardly wonder if he preferred to shield his brother-in-law."\r\n\r\n"Or himself!" said Jenny, under her breath.\r\n\r\n"Come, Jenny," said Julius, feeling that the moment for interruption\r\nhad come, "it is time we should be off.  Methinks there are sounds\r\nas if the whole canine establishment at Mrs. Hornblower\'s were\r\nprancing up to meet us."\r\n\r\nSo it proved; and Jenny had to run the gauntlet through the\r\necstasies of all the dogs, whose ecclesiastical propriety was quite\r\noverthrown, for they danced about her to the very threshold of the\r\nchurch, and had to have the door shut on their very noses.  That\r\ndrop of bitterness, which her sad brief story could not fail to have\r\nleft in poor Joanna\'s heart, either passed out of mind in what\r\nfollowed, or was turned into the prayer, "And to turn their hearts;"\r\nand she was her bright self again for her promised assistance at the\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThen Herbert\'s address was, "Come, Joan, I promised to take you to\r\nsee the Reeves\'s pheasant at the Outwood Lodge.  Such a jolly old\r\nwoman!"\r\n\r\n"The pheasant?"\r\n\r\n"No; the keeper\'s mother.  Tail a yard long!  I don\'t see why we\r\nshouldn\'t turn them out at home.  If father won\'t take it up, I\r\nshall write to Phil."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Herbs.  Hadn\'t you better secure a little reading first?\r\nI could wait; I\'ve got to write to Will."\r\n\r\n"The post doesn\'t go till five."\r\n\r\n"But I want to get it done.  The mail goes to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll do it much better after a walk.  I can\'t understand anything\r\nafter the fumes of the school, unless I do a bit of visiting first;\r\nand that pheasant is a real stunner.  It really is parish work,\r\nJenny.  Look here, this is what I\'m reading her."\r\n\r\n"_Learn to die_!" said Jenny, laughing heartily.  "Nothing could be\r\nmore appropriate, only you should have begun before October."\r\n\r\n"You choose to make fun of everything!" answered Herbert, gruffly;\r\nand Jenny, deciding that she would see a specimen day, made her\r\npeace by consenting to share in the pastoral visit, whether to\r\npheasant or peasant.  Indeed, a walk with Herbert was one of the\r\nprime pleasures of her life--and this was delightful, along broad\r\ngravelled drives through the autumnal woods with tinted beech-leaves\r\nabove, and brackens of all shades of brown, green, and yellow\r\nbeneath.  And it was charming to see Herbert\'s ways with the old\r\nwoman--a dainty old dame, such as is grown in the upper ranks of\r\nservice, whom he treated with a hearty, bantering, coaxing manner,\r\nwhich she evidently enjoyed extremely.  His reading, for he _did_\r\ncome to more serious matters, was very good--in a voice that without\r\neffort reached deaf ears, and with feeling about it that did a great\r\ndeal to reassure his sister that there was something behind the big\r\nbright boy.\r\n\r\nBut by the time he had done the honours of all the pheasants, and\r\nall the dogs, and all the ferrets, and all the stuffed birds, and\r\nall the eggs (for the keeper was a bit of a naturalist), and had\r\ndiscussed Mr. Frank\'s last day\'s shooting, it was so late, that\r\nJenny had only just time to walk back to the Hall at her best pace,\r\nto see Mrs. Poynsett for a few minutes before luncheon; and her\r\nreception was, "Is that Herbert\'s step?  Call him in, my dear!--You\r\nmust make the most of your sister, Herbert.  Come in to all meals\r\nwhile she is here."\r\n\r\nHe heard with gratitude--his sister with consternation.  If forenoon\r\npastoral visits were to be on that scale, and he dined out whenever\r\nhe was not at school or at church, how would his books fare? and yet\r\nshe could not grudge his pleasure.  She could not help looking half\r\nfoolish, half sad, when she met the Rector\'s eye.\r\n\r\nJulius thought so much of her advice, as to knock at Cecil\'s\r\nsitting-room door, and beg to ask her a question; and as she liked\r\nto be consulted, she welcomed him hospitably into that temple,\r\nsacred to culture and to Dunstone--full of drawings, books, and\r\nchina.\r\n\r\n"I was thinking," he said, "of offering Anne some parish work.  I\r\nwanted to know if you saw any objection?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not; I have not been able to make acquaintance yet with\r\nall our tenants, but they seem quite to understand the difference in\r\nour positions," said Cecil, with due deliberation.\r\n\r\nJulius choked his amusement, and waived that point.  "But did you\r\nnot feel obliged to decline her services at the Wil\'sbro\' work-\r\nroom?"\r\n\r\n"That was quite another thing.  What was most undesirable in such an\r\ninstitution would be all very well for your old women."\r\n\r\n"What kind of thing?"\r\n\r\n"Talking piously, giving away texts, and so on; just the way to make\r\nthe women think we intended to impose religious instruction and give\r\na sectarian character, defeating our own object."\r\n\r\n"Was there any flaw in what she said?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell what she said.  It was just a little murmur over the\r\nwork."\r\n\r\n"Not preaching?"\r\n\r\n"Not in that sense," said Cecil, with a little compunction.\r\n\r\n"I am glad to hear it; it makes a great difference."\r\n\r\n"You see," said the lady, "our institution is merely intended to\r\nsupport these women in the time of want; and if we were to couple\r\nour assistance with religion we should just sink into a mothers\'\r\nmeeting, and make the women think--"\r\n\r\n"Think that you prize the soul more than the body," said Julius, as\r\nshe halted in search of a word.  "I understand, Cecil; you would not\r\nbe in the prevailing fashion.  I don\'t want to argue that point,\r\nonly to understand about Anne."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he went at once to Anne\'s abode, the old schoolroom,\r\nwhich, like everything else belonging to Mrs. Miles Charnock, had a\r\nsad-coloured aspect, although it had been fitted up very prettily.\r\nThe light was sombre, and all the brighter pictures and ornaments\r\nseemed to have been effaced by a whole gallery of amateur\r\nphotographs, in which the glories of the African bush were\r\nrepresented by brown masses of shade variegated by blotches of\r\nwhite.  Even in Miles\'s own portrait on the table, the gold seemed\r\noverwhelmed by the dark blue; and even as Julius entered, she shut\r\nit up in its brown case, as too sacred for even his brother\'s eyes.\r\n\r\nHowever, a flush of pleasure came to her pale face at the invitation\r\nto take a class, and to read to a good old woman, whom in his secret\r\nsoul he thought so nearly a dissenter, that she could not be made\r\nmore so.  She promised her help with some eagerness for as long as\r\nshe should remain in England, and accepted the books he gave her\r\nwithout protest.  Nay, that same evening she took Jenny off into her\r\ngray abode, to consult her whether, since she must now join the\r\nearly breakfast, she could go to daily service without becoming\r\nformal.\r\n\r\nShe even recurred to her question, whether Julius was a Christian,\r\nwithout nearly as much negation in her tones as before; and Jenny,\r\ntaking it as it was meant, vouched for his piety, so as might render\r\nit a little more comprehensible to one matured on Scottish Calvinism\r\nand English Methodism, diluted in devout undogmatic minds, with no\r\nprinciple more developed than horror of Popery and of worldliness.\r\nTurned loose in solitude, reserve, and sadness, on her husband\'s\r\nfamily, who did nothing but shock her with manifestations of the\r\nlatter, she could hardly turn even to the clerical portion of it,\r\nwhile Julius, as well as his curates, bore all the tokens by which\r\nshe had been taught to know a Papist.  Daily intercourse was perhaps\r\ndrawing her a little towards her brother-in-law; but Herbert Bowater\r\nunited these obnoxious externals to a careless tongue, and joyous\r\neasy-going manner, and taste for amusement, which so horrified Anne,\r\nthat she once condoled with his sister, and proposed to unite in\r\nprayer for his conversion; but this was more than Joanna could bear,\r\nand she cried, "I only wish I were as good a Christian as dear\r\nHerbert!"\r\n\r\nFor indeed, the sister\'s heart intensely esteemed his sweetness,\r\nhonesty, and simplicity, even while she found it an uphill task to\r\ncoax him to steady work.  After that first morning he was indeed\r\nashamed to let her see the proportion between his pastoral visits\r\nand his theological reading; but the newspapers (he had two or three\r\nweekly ones) had a curious facility of expansion, and there was a\r\nperilous sound in "I\'ll just see where the meet is,"--not that he\r\nhad the most distant idea of repairing thither; it was pure filial\r\ninterest in learning where his father and Edith would be.\r\n\r\nJenny could not tell whether her presence conduced to diligence or\r\nto chatter, but he minded her more than any one else, and always\r\nstuck close to her, insisting on her admiring all his proteges.\r\nThere was one with whom he was certainly doing a work, which, as\r\nJulius truly said, no one more clerical could have done so well--\r\nnamely, the son of his landlady, a youth who held a small clerkship\r\nin an office at Willansborough, and who had fallen this year under\r\nthe attraction of the Backsworth races, so as to get into serious\r\ndifficulties with his master, and narrowly escape dismissal for the\r\nsake of his mother.\r\n\r\nThe exceeding good-nature and muscular Christian side of the\r\nlodger\'s character was having a most happy effect on the lad.  He\r\nhad set up a regular hero-worship, which Herbert encouraged by\r\nalways calling for him when going to the choral practices, getting\r\nhim into the choir, lending him books, and inviting him to read in\r\nhis room in the evening.  How much they played with the dogs was not\r\nknown; but at any rate, Harry Hornblower was out of mischief, and\r\nhis mother was so grateful to Mr. Bowater, that she even went the\r\nlength of preferring his sermons to those of both his seniors.\r\n\r\nThe discovery that most vexed Jenny was that Sirenwood had so much\r\nof his time.  He seemed to be asked to come to dinner whenever Sir\r\nHarry saw him, or a chair was left vacant at a party; and though his\r\nRector was inexorable as to releasing him on casual notice from the\r\nparish avocations of three nights in the week, the effect was\r\ngrumbling as savage as was possible from so good-humoured a being;\r\nand now and then a regular absence without leave, and a double growl\r\nat the consequent displeasure.  It was true that in ten minutes he\r\nwas as hearty and friendly as ever to his colleagues, but that might\r\nbe only a proof of his disregard of their reproofs, and their small\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nEleonora Vivian was not the attraction.  No; Herbert thought her a\r\nproud, silent, disagreeable girl, and could see no beauty in her;\r\nbut he had a boy\'s passion for the matured splendour of her sister\'s\r\nbeauty; and she was so kind to him!\r\n\r\nWhat could Jenny mean by looking glum about it?  She was stunningly\r\ngood, and all that.  She had done no end of good with clubs and\r\nmothers\' meetings at her married home; and it was no end of a pity\r\nshe was not in Compton parish, instead of under poor wretched old\r\nFuller, whom you could not stir--no, not if you tied a firebrand to\r\nhis tail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\nWithered Leaves and Fresh Buds\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Rosamond and Joanna Bowater could not fail to be good friends;\r\nHerbert was a great bond of union, and so was Mrs. Poynsett.\r\nRosamond found it hard to recover from the rejection of her scheme\r\nof the wheeled-chair, and begged Jenny to become its advocate; but\r\nMrs. Poynsett listened with a smile of the unpromising kind--"You\r\ntoo, Jenny?"\r\n\r\n"Why not, dear Mrs. Poynsett?  How nice it would be to see you in\r\nyour own corner again!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think my own corner remains."\r\n\r\n"Oh! but it could be restored at once."\r\n\r\n"Do you think so?  No, no, Jenny my dear; cracked china is better\r\nleft on the shelf out of the way, even if it could bear the move,\r\nwhich it can\'t."\r\n\r\nThen Jenny understood, and advised Rosamond to bide her time, and\r\nwait till the session of parliament, when the house would be\r\nquieter; and Rosamond nodded and held her peace.\r\n\r\nThe only person who held aloof was Cecil, who would not rise to the\r\nbait when Raymond tried to exhibit Miss Bowater as a superior\r\nintellectual woman.\r\n\r\nUnluckily, too, Jenny observed one evening at the five o\'clock tea,\r\n"I hear that Mrs. Duncombe has picked up some very funny people--a\r\nlady lecturer, who is coming to set us all to rights."\r\n\r\n"A wonderful pair, I hear!" said Frank.  "Mrs. Clio Tallboys, she\r\ncalls herself, and a poor little husband, whom she carries about to\r\nshow the superiority of her sex."\r\n\r\n"A Cambridge professor and a great political economist!" observed\r\nCecil, in a low but indignant voice.\r\n\r\n"The Yankee Cambridge!" quoth Frank.\r\n\r\n"The American Cambridge is a distinguished university," returned\r\nCecil.\r\n\r\n"Cecil is right, Master Frank," laughed his mother; "Cam and Isis\r\nare not the only streams of learning in the world."\r\n\r\n"I never heard of him," said Jenny; "he is a mere satellite to the\r\ngreat luminary."\r\n\r\n"They are worth seeing," added Frank; "she is one of those regular\r\nAmerican beauties one would pay to get a sight of."\r\n\r\n"Where did you get all this information?" asked Cecil.\r\n\r\n"From Duncombe himself.  They met on the Righi; and nothing is more\r\ncomical than to near him describe the ladies\' fraternization over\r\nfemale doctors and lawyers, till they rushed into each other\'s arms,\r\nand the Clio promised to come down on a crusade and convert you\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"There are two ways of telling a story," said Cecil.\r\n\r\n"No wonder the gentlemen quake!" said Mrs. Poynsett.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t," said Frank, boyishly.\r\n\r\n"Because you\'ve no wife to take you in hand," retorted Jenny.\r\n\r\n"For my part," said Mrs. Poynsett, "I can\'t see what women want.  I\r\nhave always had as many rights as I could exercise."\r\n\r\n"Ah! but we are not all ladies of the manor," said Jenny, "nor do we\r\nall drive coaches."\r\n\r\n"I observe," said Cecil, with dignity, "that there is supposed to be\r\na license to laugh at Mrs. Duncombe and whatever she does."\r\n\r\n"She would do better to mind her children," said Frank.\r\n\r\n"Children!  Has she children?" broke in Anne and Rosamond, both at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you know it?" said Jenny.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed!  I didn\'t think her the sort of woman," said Rosamond.\r\n"What does she do with them?"\r\n\r\n"Drops them in the gutter," said Frank.  "Literally, as I came home,\r\nI heard a squeak, and found a child flat in a little watercourse.  I\r\npicked it out, and the elder one told me it was Ducky Duncombe, or\r\nsome such word.  Its little boots had holes in them, mother; its\r\nlegs were purple, and there was a fine smart foreign woman flirting\r\nround the corner with young Hornblower."\r\n\r\n"Boys with long red hair, and Highland dresses?" exclaimed Rosamond.\r\n"Yes, the same we saw with Miss Vivian!"\r\n\r\n"Exactly!" said Frank, eagerly.  "She is quite a mother to those\r\npoor little wretches; they watch for her at the Sirenwood gate, and\r\nshe walks with them.  The boy\'s cry was not for mother or nurse, but\r\nfor Lena!"\r\n\r\n"Pray, did she come at his call?"\r\n\r\n"No; but when I carried the brat home, poor Duncombe told me almost\r\nwith tears, how good she is to them.  I fancy he feels their\r\nmother\'s neglect of them."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I gave her credit for having none," said Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Jenny, "you should have heard her condolences with my\r\nsister Mary on her last infliction.  Fancy Mary\'s face!"\r\n\r\n"No doubt it was to stem a torrent of nursery discussions," said\r\nCecil.  "Such bad taste!"\r\n\r\n"Which?" murmured Rosamond under her breath, with an arched eyebrow.\r\n\r\n"Plain enough," said Frank:  "if a woman is a woman, the bad taste\r\nis to be ashamed of it."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Cecil, "that is the way with men; they would fain keep\r\nus down to the level of the nursery."\r\n\r\n"I thought nurseries were usually at the top of the house."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," said Mrs. Poynsett, disregarding this mischievous\r\nsuggestion, "they mean that organization, like charity, should begin\r\nat home."\r\n\r\n"You say that meaningly," said Rosamond.  "I have heard very odd\r\nstories of domestic affairs at Aucuba Villa, and that she can\'t get\r\na servant to stay there."\r\n\r\n"That man, Alexander, has always been there," said Frank.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but he has occasionally to do all the work of the house.  Yes,\r\nI can\'t help it, Cecil, Susan will regale me with cook-stories\r\nsometimes; and I have heard of the whole establishment turning out\r\non being required to eat funguses."\r\n\r\n"I shall beware of dining there!" said Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t they dine here to-morrow?" asked Frank.\r\n\r\n"No, they are engaged to the Moys," said Cecil.\r\n\r\n"But the Vivians come?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes."\r\n\r\nEvery one knew that already; but Frank could not help having it\r\nrepeated.  It was a mere formal necessity to ask them, and had been\r\naccepted as such; but there was some amazement when Cecil brought\r\nhome Lady Tyrrell and Miss Vivian to lunch and spend the afternoon.\r\nIt might be intended as one of her demonstrations; for though it was\r\nunderstood that any of the inmates were free to bring home friends\r\nto luncheon, it was not done--except with a casual gentleman--\r\nwithout notice to the mistress of the house.  Cecil, however,\r\ncomported herself entirely as in that position, explaining that Lady\r\nTyrrell was come to give her advice upon an intended fernery, and\r\nwould perform her toilette here, so as to have plenty of time.\r\nFrank, little knowing what was passing, was working the whole day at\r\nhis tutor\'s for the closely imminent examination; Julius and Raymond\r\nwere gravely polite; Eleonora very silent; and as soon as the meal\r\nwas over, Rosamond declared that she should not come out to stand\r\nplanning in the cold; and though Herbert would have liked nothing\r\nbetter in that company, his Rector carried him off to arrange an\r\nAdvent service in a distant hamlet; Anne\'s horse came to the door;\r\nand only Joanna remained to accompany the gardening party, except\r\nthat Raymond came out with them to mark the limits of permissible\r\nalteration.\r\n\r\n"How unchanged!" exclaimed Lady Tyrrell.  "Time stands still here;\r\nonly where is the grand old magnolia?  How sweet it used to be!"\r\n\r\n"Killed by the frost," said Raymond, shortly, not choosing to\r\nundergo a course of reminiscences, and chafing his wife by his\r\nrepressive manner towards her guest.  When he had pointed out the\r\nbed of Americans that were to be her boundary, he excused himself as\r\nhaving letters to finish; and as he went away Cecil gave vent to her\r\ndistaste to the old shrubs and borders, now, of course, at their\r\nworst--the azaleas mere dead branches, the roses with a few yellow\r\nnight-capped buds still lingering, and fuchsias with a scanty bell\r\nor two.\r\n\r\nJenny fought for their spring beauty, all the more because Lady\r\nTyrrell was encouraging the wife to criticize the very things she\r\nhad tried to sentimentalize over with the husband; but seeing that\r\nshe was only doing harm, she proposed a brisk walk to Eleonora, who\r\ngladly assented, though her sister made a protest about damp, and\r\nher being a bad walker.  The last things they heard was Cecil\'s\r\nsigh, "It is all so shut in, wherever there is level ground, that\r\nthe bazaar would be impossible."\r\n\r\n"I should hope so!" muttered Jenny.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean to do about this bazaar?" asked Eleonora, as they\r\nsped away.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know.  Those things so often go off in smoke, that I don\'t\r\nmake up my mind till they become imminent."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid this will go on," said Eleonora.  "Camilla means it and\r\nshe always carries out her plans; I wish I saw the right line."\r\n\r\n"About that?"\r\n\r\n"About everything.  It seems to me that there never was any one so\r\ncut off from help and advice as I am;" then, as Joanna made some\r\nmute sign of sympathy, "I knew you would understand; I have been\r\nlonging to be with you, for there has been no one to whom I could\r\nspeak freely since I left Rockpier."\r\n\r\n"And I have been longing to have you.  Mamma would have asked you to\r\nstay with us before, only we had the house full.  Can\'t you come\r\nnow?"\r\n\r\n"You will see that I shall not be allowed.  It is of no use to think\r\nabout it!" said the girl, with a sigh.  "Here, let us get out of\r\nthis broad path, or she may yet come after us--persuade Mrs.\r\nCharnock Poynsett it is too cold to stand about--anything to break\r\nup a tete-a-tete."\r\n\r\nJenny saw she really was in absolute fear of pursuit; but hardly yet\r\nunderstood the nervous haste to turn into a not very inviting side-\r\npath, veiled by the trees, whose wet leaves were falling.\r\n\r\n"Do you mind the damp?" asked the girl, anxiously.\r\n\r\n"No, not at all; but--"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know what it is never to feel free, but be like a French\r\ngirl, always watched--at least whenever I am with any one I care to\r\nspeak to."\r\n\r\n"Are you quite sure it is not imagination?"\r\n\r\n"O, Joanna, don\'t be like all the rest, blinded by her!  You knew\r\nher always!"\r\n\r\n"Only from below.  I am four years younger; you know dear Emily was\r\nmy contemporary."\r\n\r\n"Dear Emily!  I miss her more now than even at Rockpier.  But you,\r\nwho were her friend, and knew Camilla of old, I know you can help me\r\nas no one else can."\r\n\r\nJenny returned a caress; and Eleonora spoke on.  "You know I was\r\nonly eight years old when Camilla married, and I had scarcely seen\r\nher till she came to us at Rockpier, on Lord Tyrrell\'s death, and\r\nthen she was most delightful.  I thought her like mother and sister\r\nboth in one, even more tender than dear Emily.  How could I have\r\nthought so for a moment?  But she enchanted everybody.  Clergy,\r\nladies, and all came under the spell; and I can\'t get advice from\r\nany of them--even from Miss Coles--you remember her?"\r\n\r\n"Your governess?  How nice she was!"\r\n\r\n"Emily and I owed everything to her!  She was as near being a mother\r\nto us as any one could be; and Camilla could not say enough of\r\ngratitude, or show esteem enough, and fascinated her like all the\r\nrest of us; but she never rested till she had got her off to a\r\nsituation in Russia.  I did not perceive the game at the time, but I\r\nsee now how all the proposals for situations within reach of me were\r\nquashed."\r\n\r\n"But you write to her?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but as soon as I showed any of my troubles she reproved me for\r\nself-will and wanting to judge for myself, and not submit to my\r\nsister.  That\'s the way with all at Rockpier.  Camilla has gone\r\nabout pitying me to them for having to give way to my married\r\nsister, but saying it was quite time that she took charge of us; and\r\non that notion they all wrote to me.  Then she persuaded papa to go\r\nabroad; and I was delighted, little thinking she never meant me to\r\ngo back again."\r\n\r\n"Did she not?"\r\n\r\n"Listen!  I\'ve heard her praise Rockpier and its church to the skies\r\nto one person--say Mr. Bindon.  To another, such as our own Vicar,\r\nshe says it was much too ultra, and she likes moderation; she tells\r\nyour father that she wants to see papa among his old friends; and to\r\nMrs. Duncombe, I\'ve heard her go as near the truth as is possible to\r\nher, and call it a wearisome place, with an atmosphere of incense,\r\ncurates, and old maids, from whom she had carried me off before I\r\ngrew fit for nothing else!"\r\n\r\n"I dare say all these are true in turn, or seem so to her, or she\r\nwould not say them before you."\r\n\r\n"She has left off trying to gloss it over with me, except so far as\r\nit is part of her nature.  She did at first, but she knows it is of\r\nno use now."\r\n\r\n"Really, Lenore, you must be going too far."\r\n\r\n"I have shocked you; but you can\'t conceive what it is to live with\r\nperpetual falsity.  No, I can\'t use any other word.  I am always\r\nmistrusting and being angered, and my senses of right and wrong get\r\nso confused, that it is like groping in a maze."  Her eyes were full\r\nof tears, but she exclaimed, "Tell me, Joanna, was there ever\r\nanything between Camilla and Mr. Poynsett?"\r\n\r\n"Why bring that up again now?"\r\n\r\n"Why did it go off?" insisted Lenore.\r\n\r\n"Because Mrs. Poynsett could not give up and turn into a dowager, as\r\nif she were not the mistress herself."\r\n\r\n"Was that all?"\r\n\r\n"So it was said."\r\n\r\n"I want to get to the bottom of it.  It was not because Lord Tyrrell\r\ncame in the way."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid they thought so here."\r\n\r\n"Then," said Eleonora, in a hard, dry way, "I know the reason of our\r\nbeing brought back here, and of a good deal besides."\r\n\r\n"My dear Lena, I am very sorry for you; but I think you had better\r\nkeep this out of your mind, or you will fall into a hard, bitter,\r\nsuspicious mood."\r\n\r\n"That is the very thing.  I am in a hard, bitter, suspicious mood,\r\nand I can\'t see how to keep out of it; I don\'t know when opposition\r\nis right and firm, and when it is only my own self-will."\r\n\r\n"Would it not be a good thing to talk to Julius Charnock?  You would\r\nnot be betraying anything."\r\n\r\n"No!  I can\'t seem to make up to the good clergyman!  Certainly not.\r\nBesides, I\'ve heard Camilla talking to his wife!"\r\n\r\n"Talking?"\r\n\r\n"Admiring that dress, which she had been sneering at to your mother,\r\ndon\'t you remember?  It was one of her honey-cups with venom below--\r\nonly happily, Lady Rosamond saw through the flattery.  I\'m ashamed\r\nwhenever I see her!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that need cut you off from Julius."\r\n\r\n"Tell me _truly_," again broke in Lenore, "what Mrs. Poynsett really\r\nis.  She is a standing proverb with us for tyranny over her sons;\r\nnot with Camilla alone, but with papa."\r\n\r\n"See how they love her!" cried Jenny, hotly.\r\n\r\n"Camilla thinks that abject; but I can\'t forget how Frank talked of\r\nher in those happy Rockpier days."\r\n\r\n"When you first knew him?" said Jenny.\r\n\r\nThey must have come at length to the real point, for Eleonora began\r\nat once--"Yes; he was with his sick friend, and we were so happy;\r\nand now he is being shamefully used, and I don\'t know what to do!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, Lenore," said Jenny, in her downright way, "I do not\r\nunderstand.  You do not seem to care for him."\r\n\r\n"Of course I am wrong," said the poor girl; "but I hoped I was doing\r\nthe best thing for him."  Then, as Jenny made an indignant sound,\r\n"See, Jenny, when he came to Rockpier, Camilla had been a widow\r\nabout three months.  She never had been very sad, for Lord Tyrrell\r\nhad been quite imbecile for a year, poor man!  And when Frank came,\r\nshe could not make enough of him; and he and I both thought the two\r\nfamilies had been devotedly fond of each other, and that she was\r\nonly too glad to meet one of them."\r\n\r\n"I suppose that was true."\r\n\r\n"So do I, as things stood then.  She meant Frank to be a sort of\r\nconnecting link, against the time when she could come back here; but\r\nwe, poor children, never thought of that, and went on together, not\r\nexactly saying anything, but quite understanding how much we cared.\r\nIndeed, I know Camilla impressed on him that, for his mother\'s sake,\r\nit must go no farther then, while he was still so young; and next\r\ncame our journey on the Continent, ending in our coming back here\r\nlast July."\r\n\r\nJenny remembered that Raymond\'s engagement had not been made known\r\ntill August, and Frank had only returned from a grouse-shooting\r\nholiday a week or two before the arrival of the brides.\r\n\r\n"Now," added Eleonora, "Camilla has made me understand that nothing\r\nwill induce her to let papa consent; and though I know he would, if\r\nhe were left to himself, I also see how all this family must hate\r\nand loathe the connection."\r\n\r\n"May I ask, has Frank ever spoken?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no!  I think he implied it all to Camilla when she bade him wait\r\ntill our return, fancying, I suppose, that one could forget the\r\nother."\r\n\r\n"But why does she seem so friendly with him?"\r\n\r\n"It is her way; she can\'t be other than smooth and caressing, and\r\nlikes to have young men about; and I try to be grave and distant,\r\nbecause--the sooner he is cured of me the better for him," she\r\nuttered, with a sob; "but when he is there, and I see those grieved\r\neyes of his, I can\'t keep it up!  And papa does like him!  Oh! if\r\nCamilla would but leave us alone!  See here, Jenny!" and she showed,\r\non her watch-chain, a bit of ruddy polished pebble.  "Is it wrong to\r\nkeep this?  He and I found the stone in two halves, on the beach,\r\nthe last day we were together, and had them set, pretending to one\r\nanother it was only play.  Sometimes I think I ought to send mine\r\nback; I know he has his, he let me see it one day.  Do you think I\r\nought to give it up?"\r\n\r\n"Why should you?"\r\n\r\n"Because then he would know that it must be all over."\r\n\r\n"But _is_ it all over?  Within, I mean?"\r\n\r\n"Jenny, you know better!"\r\n\r\n"Then, Lenore, if so, and it is only your sister who objects, not\r\nyour father himself, ought you to torment poor Frank by acting\r\nindifference when you do not feel it?"\r\n\r\n"Am I untrue?  I never thought of that.  I thought I should be\r\nsacrificing myself for his good!"\r\n\r\n"His good?  O, Lenore, I believe it is the worst wrong a woman can\r\ndo a man, to let him think he has wasted his heart upon her, and\r\nthat she is trifling with him.  You don\'t know what a bad effect\r\nthis is having, even on his prospects.  He cannot get his brain or\r\nspirits free to work for his examination."\r\n\r\n"How hard it is to know what is right!  Here have I been thinking\r\nthat what made me so miserable must be the best for him, and would\r\nit not make it all the worse to relax, and let him see?"\r\n\r\n"I do not think so," returned Jenny.  "His spirits would not be worn\r\nby doubt of _you_--the worst doubt of all:  and he would feel that\r\nhe had something to strive for."\r\n\r\nEleonora walked on for some steps in silence, then exclaimed, "Yes,\r\nbut there\'s his family.  It would only stir up trouble for them\r\nthere.  They can\'t approve of me."\r\n\r\n"They don\'t know you.  When they do, they will.  Now they only see\r\nwhat looks like--forgive me, Lena--caprice and coquetry; they will\r\nknow you in earnest, if you will let them."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean that they know anything about it!" exclaimed\r\nEleonora.\r\n\r\nJenny almost laughed.  "Not know where poor Frank\'s heart is?  You\r\ndon\'t guess how those sons live with their mother!"\r\n\r\n"I suppose I have forgotten what sincerity and openness are," said\r\nEleonora, sadly.  "But is not she very much vexed?"\r\n\r\n"She was vexed to find it had gone so deep with him," said Jenny;\r\n"but I know that you can earn her affection and trust by being\r\nstaunch and true yourself--and it is worth having, Lena!"\r\n\r\nFor Jenny knew Eleonora of old, through Emily\'s letters, and had no\r\ndoubt of her rectitude, constancy, and deep principle, though she\r\nwas at the present time petrified by constant antagonism to such\r\nuntruthfulness as, where it cannot corrupt, almost always hardens\r\nthose who come in contact with it.  And this cruel idea of self-\r\nsacrifice was, no doubt, completing the indurating process.\r\n\r\nJenny knew the terrible responsibility of giving such advice.  She\r\nhad not done it lightly.  She had been feeling for years past that\r\n"\'Tis better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at\r\nall;" and she knew that uncertainty of the right to love and trust\r\nwould have been a pang beyond all she had suffered.  To give poor\r\nEleonora, situated as she now was, admission to the free wholesome\r\natmosphere of the Charnock family, was to her kind heart\r\nirresistible; and it was pleasant to feel the poor girl clinging to\r\nher, as people do to those who have given the very counsel the heart\r\ncraved for.\r\n\r\nIt was twilight when the walk was over, and the drawing-room was\r\nempty; but Anne came to invite them to Mrs. Poynsett\'s tea, saying\r\nthat Cecil had Lady Tyrrell in her own sitting-room.  Perhaps Mrs.\r\nPoynsett had not realized who was Jenny\'s companion, for she seemed\r\nstartled at their entrance; and Jenny said, "You remember Lenore\r\nVivian?"\r\n\r\n"I must have seen you as a child," said Mrs. Poynsett, courteously.\r\n"You are very like your sister."\r\n\r\nThis, though usually a great compliment, disappointed Eleonora, as\r\nshe answered, rather frigidly, "So people say."\r\n\r\n"Have you walked far?"\r\n\r\n"To the Outwood Lodge."\r\n\r\n"To-day?  Was it not very damp in the woods?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, delightful!"\r\n\r\n"Lena and I are old friends," said Jenny; "too glad to meet to heed\r\nthe damp."\r\n\r\nHere Raymond entered, with the air of a man who had just locked up a\r\nheavy post-bag at the last possible moment; and he too was amazed,\r\nthough he covered it by asking why the party was so small.\r\n\r\n"Rosamond has gone to meet her husband, and Cecil has her guest in\r\nher own domains."\r\n\r\nThen Jenny asked after his day\'s work--a county matter, interesting\r\nto all the magistracy, and their womankind in their degree; and\r\nEleonora listened in silence, watching with quiet heedfulness\r\nFrank\'s mother and brother.\r\n\r\nWhen Frank himself came in, his face was a perfect study; and the\r\ncolour mantled in her cheeks, so that Jenny trusted that both were\r\ntouched by the wonderful beauty that a little softness and timidity\r\nbrought out on the features, usually so resolutely on guard.  But\r\nwhen, in the later evening, Jenny crept in to her old friend, hoping\r\nto find that the impression had been favourable, she only heard,\r\n"Exactly like her sister, who always had the making of a fine\r\ncountenance."\r\n\r\n"The mask--yes, but Lena has the spirit behind the mask.  Poor girl!\r\nshe is not at all happy in the atmosphere her sister has brought\r\nhome."\r\n\r\n"Then I wish they would marry her!"\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you believe how truly nice and good she is?"\r\n\r\n"That will not make up for the connection.  My heart sank, Jenny,\r\nfrom the time I heard that those Vivians were coming back.  I kept\r\nFrank away as long as I could--but there\'s no help for it.  It seems\r\nthe fate of my boys to be the prey of those sirens."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, dear Mrs. Poynsett, do pray believe, on my word, that\r\nEleonora is a different creature!"\r\n\r\n"Is there no hope of averting it?  I thought Camilla would--poor\r\nFrank is such insignificant game!"\r\n\r\n"And when it does come, don\'t be set against her, please, dear Mrs.\r\nPoynsett.  Be as kind to her--as you were to me," whispered Jenny,\r\nnestling up, and hiding her face.\r\n\r\n"My dear, but I knew you!  You were no such case."\r\n\r\n"Except that you all were horribly vexed with us, because we\r\ncouldn\'t help liking each other," said Jenny.\r\n\r\n"Ah! my poor child!  I only wish you could have liked any one else!"\r\n\r\n"Do you?" said Jenny, looking up.  "Oh no, you don\'t!  You would not\r\nhave me for your supplementary child, if I had," she added\r\nplayfully; then very low--"It is because the thought of dear Archie,\r\neven ending as it did, is my very heart\'s joy, that I want you to\r\nlet them have theirs!"\r\n\r\nAnd then came a break, which ended the pleading; and Jenny was\r\nobliged to leave Compton without much notion as to the effect of her\r\nadvice, audacious as she knew it to have been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\nNeither Land Nor Water\r\n\r\n\r\nA light that never was on sea or land.--WORDSWORTH\r\n\r\nNothing could be prettier than Rosamond\'s happiness in welcoming her\r\nschool-boy brothers, and her gratitude to Mrs. Poynsett for inviting\r\nthem, declaring that she liked boys.  Her sons, however, dreaded the\r\ninroad of two wild Irish lads, and held council what covers and what\r\nhorses could most safely be victimized to them, disregarding all\r\ntestimony in their favour from interested parties.  When, therefore,\r\nTerence and Thomas de Lancey made their appearance, and were walked\r\nin for exhibition by their proud and happy sister, there was some\r\nsurprise at the sight of two peculiarly refined, quiet boys, with\r\ncolourless complexions, soft, sleepy, long-lashed, liquid brown\r\neyes, the lowest of full voices, and the gentlest of manners, as if\r\nnothing short of an explosion could rouse them.\r\n\r\nAnd it was presently manifest that their sister had said rather too\r\nlittle than too much of Terry\'s abilities.  Not only had he brought\r\nhome a huge pile of prizes, but no sooner was the seance after\r\ndinner broken up, than he detained Julius, saying, in a very meek\r\nand modest tone, "Rose says you know all the books in the library."\r\n\r\n"Rose undertakes a great deal for me.  What is this the prelude to?"\r\n\r\n"I wanted to ask if I might just look at any book about the physical\r\ngeography of Italy, or the History of Venice, or the Phoenicians."\r\n\r\n"Why, Terry?"\r\n\r\n"It is for the Prize Essay," explained the boy; "the subject is the\r\neffect of the physical configuration of a country upon the character\r\nof a nation."\r\n\r\nJulius drew a long breath, astounded at the march of intellect since\r\nhis time.  "They don\'t expect such things of fellows like you!" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Only of the sixth, but the fifth may go in for it, and I want to\r\nget up to the Doctor himself; I thought, as I was coming to such a\r\njolly library, I might try; and if I do pretty well, I shall be put\r\nup, if any more fellows leave.  Do you think I may use the books?\r\nI\'m librarian, so I know how to take care of them."\r\n\r\n"You can be trusted for that, you book-worm," said Julius; "here\'s\r\nthe library, but I fear I don\'t know much about those modern\r\nhistories.  My mother is a great reader, and will direct us.  Let us\r\ncome to her."\r\n\r\nQuiet as Terry was, he was neither awkward nor shy; and when Julius\r\nhad explained his wishes, and Mrs. Poynsett had asked a few good-\r\nnatured questions, she was charmed as well as surprised at the\r\ngentle yet eager modesty with which the low-pitched tones detailed\r\nthe ideas already garnered up, and inquired for authorities, in\r\nwhich to trace them out, without the least notion of the remarkable\r\npowers he was evincing.  She was delighted with the boy; Julius\r\nguided his researches; and he went off to bed as happy as a king,\r\nwith his hands full of little dark tarnished French duodecimos, and\r\nwith a ravenous appetite for the pasture ground he saw before him.\r\nLower Canada had taught him French, and the stores he found were\r\nrevelry to him.\r\n\r\nCecil\'s feelings may be better guessed than described when the\r\nreturn of Mudie\'s box was hastened that he might have Motley\'s Dutch\r\nRepublic.  She thought this studiousness mere affectation; but it\r\nwas indisputable that Terry\'s soul was in books, and that he never\r\nwas so happy as when turned loose into the library, dipping here and\r\nthere, or with an elbow planted on either side of a folio.\r\n\r\nOffers of gun or horse merely tormented him, and only his sister\r\ncould drag him out by specious pleas of need, to help in those\r\nChristmas works, where she had much better assistance in Anne and\r\nthe curates--the one for clubs and coals, the other for decorations.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett was Terry\'s best friend.  He used to come to her in\r\nthe evening and discuss what he had been reading till she was almost\r\nas keen about his success as Frank\'s.  He talked over his ambition,\r\nof getting a scholarship, becoming a fellow, and living for ever\r\namong the books, for which the scanty supply in his wandering\r\nboyhood had but whetted his fervour.  He even confided to her what\r\nno one else knew but his sister Aileen, his epic in twenty-four\r\nbooks on Brian Boromhe and the Battle of Clontarf; and she was\r\nmother enough not to predict its inevitable fate, nor audibly to\r\ndetect the unconscious plagiarisms, but to be a better listener than\r\neven Aileen, who never could be withheld from unfeeling laughter at\r\nthe touching fate of the wounded warriors who were tied to stakes\r\nthat they might die fighting.\r\n\r\nTom was a more ordinary youth, even more lazy and quiet in the\r\nhouse, though out of it he amazed Frank and Charlie by his dash,\r\nfire, and daring, and witched all the stable-world with noble\r\nhorsemanship.  Hunting was prevented, however, by a frost, which\r\nfilled every one with excitement as to the practicability of\r\nskating.\r\n\r\nThe most available water was a lake between Sirenwood and Compton;\r\nand here, like eagles to the slaughter, gathered, by a sort of\r\ninstinct, the entire skating population of the neighbourhood on the\r\nfirst day that the ice was hard enough.  Rosamond was there, of\r\ncourse, with both her brothers, whom she averred, by a bold figure\r\nof speech, to have skated in Canada before they could walk.  Anne\r\nwas there, studying the new phenomena of ice and snow under good-\r\nnatured Charlie\'s protection, learning the art with unexpected\r\ncourage and dexterity.  Cecil was there but not shining so much, for\r\nher father had been always so nervous about his darling venturing on\r\nthe ice, that she had no skill in the art; and as Raymond had been\r\nsummoned to some political meeting, she had no special squire, as\r\nher young brother-in-law eluded the being enlisted in her service;\r\nand she began to decide that skating was irrational and unwomanly;\r\nalthough Lady Tyrrell had just arrived, and was having her skates\r\nput on; and Eleonora was only holding back because she was taking\r\ncare of the two purple-legged, purple-faced, and purple-haired\r\nlittle Duncombes, whom she kept sliding in a corner, where they\r\ncould hardly damage themselves or the ice.\r\n\r\nCecil had just thanked Colonel Ross for pushing her in a chair, and\r\non his leaving her was deliberating whether to walk home with her\r\ndignity, or watch for some other cavalier, when the drag drew up on\r\nthe road close by, and from it came Captain and Mrs. Duncombe, with\r\ntwo strangers, who were introduced to her as \'Mrs. Tallboys and the\r\nProfessor, just fetched from the station.\'\r\n\r\nThe former was exquisitely dressed in blue velvet and sealskin, and\r\nhad the transparent complexion and delicate features of an American,\r\nwith brilliant eyes, and a look of much cleverness; her husband,\r\nsmall, sallow, and dark, and apparently out of health.  "Are you\r\nleaving off skating, Cecil?" asked Mrs. Duncombe; "goodness me, I\r\ncould go on into next year!  But if you are wasting your privileges,\r\nbestow them on Mrs. Tallboys, for pity\'s sake.  We came in hopes\r\nsome good creature had a spare pair of skates.  Gussie Moy offered,\r\nbut hers were yards too long."\r\n\r\n"I hope mine are not too small," said Cecil, not quite crediting\r\nthat an American foot could be as small as that of a Charnock; but\r\nshe found herself mistaken, they were a perfect fit; and as they\r\nwere tried, there came a loud laugh, and she saw a tall girl\r\nstanding by her, whom, in her round felt hat and thick rough coat\r\nwith metal buttons, she had really taken for one of the Captain\'s\r\nmale friends.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t have such small feet," she said; "I shouldn\'t feel\r\nsecure of my understanding."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Tallboys would not change with you, Gussie," said Captain\r\nDuncombe.  "I\'d back her any day--"\r\n\r\n"What odds will you take, Captain--"\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Duncombe broke in.  "Bless me, if there aren\'t those little\r\ndogs of mine!  Lena Vivian does spoil them.  Send them home, for\r\npity\'s sake, Bob."\r\n\r\n"Poor little kids, they are doing no harm."\r\n\r\n"We shall have them tumbling in, and no end of a row!  I can\'t stand\r\na swarm of children after me, and they are making a perfect victim\r\nof Lena.  Send them home, Bob, or I shall have to do it."\r\n\r\nThe Captain obeyed somewhat ruefully.  "Come, my lads, Bessie says\r\nyou must go home, and leave Miss Vivian in peace."\r\n\r\n"O, Bob, please let us stay; Lena is taking care of us--"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I like nothing so well," protested Lenore; but the Captain\r\nmurmured something about higher powers, and cheerfully saying he\r\nwould give the boys a run, took each by an unwilling hand, and raced\r\nthem into a state of frightened jollity by a short cut, by which he\r\nwas able to dispose of them in the drag.\r\n\r\nThe Professor, meanwhile, devoted himself to Mrs. Charnock Poynsett,\r\ntook her chair for a whirl on the ice; described American sleighing\r\nparties; talked of his tour in Europe.  He was really a clever,\r\nobservant man, and Cecil had not had any one to talk Italy to her\r\nfor a long time past, and responded with all her full precision.\r\nThe Professor might speak a little through his nose, but she had\r\nseldom met any one more polite and accomplished.\r\n\r\nMeantime, a quadrille was being got up.  Such a performance and such\r\npartners had never been seen in light that shone on water or on\r\nland, being coupled by their dexterity in the art.  They were led\r\noff by Mrs. Duncombe and the Reverend James Bindon.  Mrs. Tallboys\r\npaired with Terry De Lancey, Lady Tyrrell with Herbert Bowater, Lady\r\nRosamond with one of the officers.  Tom was pounced on by the great\r\n\'Gussy Moy,\' who declared, to his bitter wrath, that she preferred\r\nlittle boys, turning her back on Mr. Strangeways and two or three\r\nmore officers, as she saw them first solicitous to engage Eleonora\r\nVivian--who, however, was to skate with Charlie.\r\n\r\nA few wistful glances were cast towards the Wil\'sbro\' road, for\r\nFrank had been obliged by the cruel exigencies of the office to\r\ndevote this magnificent frosty day to the last agonies of cram.\r\nThis, however, had gone on better for the last fortnight--owing,\r\nperhaps, to some relaxation of Eleonora\'s stern guard over her\r\ncountenance in their few meetings since Jenny\'s departure.\r\n\r\n"And after all," as Charlie said, with the cheeriness of one who has\r\npassed his own ordeal, "a man who had taken such a degree as Frank\r\ncould not depend on a few weeks of mere cramming."\r\n\r\nFrank did come speedily up the road just as the quadrille was in\r\nfull force; and perhaps the hindrance had stood him in good stead;\r\nfor when the performance ceased in the twilight, and voices were\r\neagerly talking of renewing it as a fackel-tanz in the later\r\nevening, and only yielding at the recollection of dinner\r\nengagements, it was not Charlie who was taking off Eleonora\'s\r\nskates; and when, after fixing grand plans for the morrow, Lady\r\nTyrrell mounted her pony-carriage and looked for her sister, she\r\nheard that Miss Vivian was walking home.\r\n\r\nYes, Miss Vivian was walking home; and there was a companion by her\r\nside feeling as if that dark, hard gravelled road were the pebbly\r\nbeach of Rockpier.\r\n\r\n"When do you go to London?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow afternoon.  Wish me well through, Lenore."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I do."\r\n\r\n"Say it again, Lenore!  Give me the elixir that will give me power\r\nto conquer everything."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say such exaggerated things."\r\n\r\n"Do you think it is possible to me to exaggerate what a word from\r\nyou is to me?" said Frank, in a low voice of intense feeling.\r\n\r\n"O Frank! it is wiser not to say such things."\r\n\r\n"Wise! what is that to me?  It is true, and you have known it--and\r\nwhy will you not allow that you do, as in those happy old days--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what makes me fear.  It would be so much better for you if\r\nall this had never begun."\r\n\r\n"It has begun, then!" murmured Frank, with joy and triumph in the\r\nsound.  "As long as you allow that, it is enough for me."\r\n\r\n"I must!  It is true; and truth must be somewhere!" was whispered in\r\na strange, low, resolute whisper.\r\n\r\n"True! true that you can feel one particle of the intensity--Oh!\r\nwhat words can I find to make you understand the glow and tenderness\r\nthe very thought of you has been!"\r\n\r\n"Hush, hush!--pray, Frank.  Now, if I do own it--"\r\n\r\n"It--what?  Let me hear!  I\'m very stupid, you know!" said Frank, in\r\na voice of exulting comprehension, belying his alleged stupidity.\r\n\r\n"What you have been to me--"\r\n\r\n"Have been--eh?" said this cruel cross-examiner.\r\n\r\n"Do not let us waste time," said Eleonora, in a trembling voice;\r\n"you know very well."\r\n\r\n"Do I?"\r\n\r\n"Now, Frank!"\r\n\r\n"If you only knew what it would be worth to me to hear you say it!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid it would be only worth pain and grief to you, and anger\r\nfrom every one," said she, in a low dejected voice, "far more than I\r\nam worth."\r\n\r\n"You?  Trust me to judge of that, Lenore.  Would not you be worth\r\nall, and more than all, that flesh or spirit could feel!  I could\r\nface it all for one look from you!" said Frank, with fervour from\r\nhis heart of hearts.\r\n\r\n"You make me more and more afraid.  It is all too wretched to lead\r\nany one into.  Since I knew the whole truth, I have tried to spare\r\nyou from it."\r\n\r\n"That is why you have been so cold, and held so cruelly aloof all\r\nthis time, so that if I had not caught one ray now and then, you\r\nwould have broken my heart, Lenore; as it is, I\'ve been wretched\r\nbeyond description, hardly able to sleep by night or speak\r\nrationally by day.  How had you the heart to serve me so, like a\r\nstony Greek statue?"\r\n\r\n"I thought it must be right.  It seemed to break my own heart too."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the woman\'s way of showing a thing is right; but why I can\'t\r\nsee.  If you did hate me, it might be all very well to throw me\r\nover; but if not, why torture two as well as one?  Are you afraid of\r\nmy people?  I\'ll manage them."\r\n\r\n"You little know--"\r\n\r\n"Know what?"\r\n\r\n"All that made it cruel in Camilla to throw us together."\r\n\r\n"Cruel! when it was the crowning joy of my past life, and is to be\r\nthe crowning joy of the future?"\r\n\r\n"How can it?  Frank, you must know the causes your mother has for\r\nabhorring any connection with our unhappy family."\r\n\r\n"My mother has too much sense to think a little extravagance among\r\nthe men of a family can affect the daughters.  I know the outer\r\nworld is afraid of her, but she is the tenderest and most indulgent\r\nof mothers to us.  No fear of her!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! but that\'s not all."\r\n\r\n"You mean that she has not taken much to your sister.  I know; and\r\nI\'m very sorry; but bring them together, and it would soon be got\r\nover.  Besides, it is not your sister, but you.  What do you mean?"\r\nrather disconcerted.\r\n\r\n"Then you really did not know of the old engagement between Camilla\r\nand your eldest brother?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, oh!  So she consented once!  Then she will do so again."\r\n\r\n"Listen!  Camilla broke it off because your mother could not resign\r\nher position to her."\r\n\r\nHe gave a whistle of dismay, then recovering himself with a laugh,\r\nsaid, "Fourth sons don\'t have such expectations founded on them.\r\nDon\'t fear, dearest; that can\'t be all the story, though no doubt it\r\nwas part of it.  My mother would rather go into a hermitage than\r\nstand in the way of Raymond\'s happiness.  Some one must have made\r\nmischief."\r\n\r\n"It was not all," said the girl; "it was Lord Tyrrell\'s coming in\r\nthe way.  Yes, my father told me so; he held it up to me as an\r\nexample of what one ought to do for one\'s family."\r\n\r\n"Then she was coerced?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; but such a marriage for me, with some one who would\r\nredeem the property, is their scheme for me.  Even if your mother\r\nand brother could tolerate the thought of one of us, my poor dear\r\nfather will never dare to consent as long as she is with him."\r\n\r\n"Nay, Lenore; have I not often heard her say she prefers happiness\r\nto ambition?  Whatever she may have done, she has come to think\r\ndifferently.  She has well-nigh told me so."\r\n\r\n"Yes, at Rockpier," sighed Eleonora.  "Hark!"  The sound of the\r\nponies\' bells and hoofs was heard; Lenore put her hand on his arm,\r\nand drew him aside on the grass, behind a clump of trees, hushing\r\nhim by a silent pressure as he tried to remonstrate.  He clasped her\r\nhand, and felt her trembling till the tinkling and tramp were gone\r\nby.\r\n\r\n"You frightened darling!" were his first words, when she let him\r\nspeak.  "Who would have thought you would be so shy?  But we\'ll have\r\nit out, and--"\r\n\r\n"It is not that," interrupted Lenore, "not maidenly shyness.  That\'s\r\nfor girls who are happy and secure.  No; but I don\'t want to have it\r\nall overthrown at once--the first sweetness--"\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be overthrown!" he said, holding arm and hand in the\r\nintense grasp.\r\n\r\n"Not really, never; but there is no use in attempting anything till\r\nI am of age--next autumn, the 7th of November."\r\n\r\n"Say nothing till then!" exclaimed Frank, in some consternation.\r\n\r\n"We are only where we were before!  We are sure of each other now.\r\nIt will be only vexation and harass," said she, with the instinct of\r\na persecuted creature.\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t," said Frank.  "I could not keep it in with mother!  It\r\nwould not be right if I could, nor should I feel as if I were acting\r\nfairly by your father."\r\n\r\n"You are right, Frank.  Forgive me!  You don\'t know what it is to\r\nhave to be always saving one\'s truth only by silence.  Speak when\r\nyou think right."\r\n\r\n"And I believe we shall find it far easier than you think.  I\'m not\r\nquite a beggar--except for you, my Lena.  I should like to go home\r\nthis minute, and tell mother and Charlie and Rose, that I\'m--I\'m\r\ntreading on air; but I should only be fallen upon for thinking of\r\nanything but my task-work.  So I\'ll take a leaf out of your book,\r\nyou cautious Lenore, and wait till I come down victorious, happy and\r\nglorious--and I shall now.  I feel as if you had given me power to\r\nscale Olympus, now I know I may carry your heart with me.  Do you\r\nremember this, Lena?"  He guided her hand to the smooth pebble on\r\nhis chain.  She responded by putting her own into his.\r\n\r\n"My talisman!" he said.  "It has been my talisman of success many a\r\ntime.  I have laid my hand on it, and thought I was working for you.\r\nMine! mine! mine!  Waters cannot quench love--never fear."\r\n\r\n"Hush!" as the light of the opening hall door was seen, and Lady\r\nTyrrell\'s voice was heard, saying, "I thought we passed her; I am\r\nsure she was near."\r\n\r\nEleonora withdrew her arm, patted Frank back, waved him into\r\nsilence, and went forward, saying, "Here I am, Camilla; I walked\r\nhome."\r\n\r\nHer voice was calm and self-contained as ever--the unassailable\r\ndignity just as usual.  The hall was full of officers, standing\r\nabout the fire and drinking tea, and Eleonora\'s well-worn armour was\r\ninstantly on, as her sister asked where she had been, since others\r\nhad walked home and had not overtaken her.\r\n\r\n"I came by the lower road," said she.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!  I never saw you."\r\n\r\n"I saw you pass--or rather heard you."\r\n\r\n"And did not let me pick you up!  Did you hide yourself?"\r\n\r\n"It was much warmer to walk."\r\n\r\n"So you seem to have found it, to judge by your cheeks," said Lady\r\nTyrrell.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Strangeways and one or two others could not restrain a\r\nmurmured exclamation on the exceeding loveliness of that deepened\r\ncolour and brightened eye; but Lenore only knew that an equally\r\nbright and keen eye was watching her heedfully, and knew that she\r\nwas suspected, if not read through and through.\r\n\r\nShe mingled in the discussion of the skating, with those outward\r\nsociety-senses that she learnt to put on, and escaped as soon as\r\npossible to her own room.\r\n\r\nAgain she almost fell on the ground in her own little oratory\r\nchamber, in a tumult of gladness that was almost agony, and fear\r\nthat was almost joy.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to give thanks that Frank had become so wholly and\r\navowedly hers, and for that deep intense affection that had gone on,\r\nunfed, uncherished, for years; but the overflow of delight was\r\nchecked with foreboding--there was the instinctive terror of a\r\nbasilisk eye gazing into her paradise of joy--the thanksgiving ran\r\ninto a half-despairing deprecation.\r\n\r\nAnd she knew that Frank was under Camilla\'s spell, and admired and\r\ntrusted her still; nor had she been able to utter a word of caution\r\nto undeceive him.  Should she have the power on the morrow?  Camilla\r\nreally loved skating, and surrounded as she was sure to be, there\r\nwas hope of escaping her vigilant eye once more.  To-morrow there\r\nwould be another meeting with Frank! perhaps another walk with him!\r\n\r\nThat anticipation was soothing enough to bring back the power of\r\njoyful gratitude, and therewith of hopeful prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\nPlot and Counterplot\r\n\r\n\r\nA lady a party of pleasure made,\r\n   And she planned her scheme full well,\r\nAnd day and night the party filled\r\n   The head of the demoiselle.--FABER\r\n\r\nThough Frank had no reason to expect that the tidings of his success\r\nwould be hailed with much satisfaction at home, yet his habit of\r\nturning to his mother for sympathy would have been too much for his\r\nprudence, but for the fact that Terry De Lancey had dragged into her\r\nroom a massive volume of prints from the Uffizi Gallery, and was\r\nlooking it over with her, with a zest she had not seen since the\r\ndays when her father gloried in his collection.\r\n\r\nHis victory could only be confided to Charlie, who might laugh, but\r\nfully appreciated the repose of mind with which he could now\r\nencounter the examiners, and promised to do his part to cover the\r\nmeetings of the lovers the next day.  But even then the chances of\r\nanother performance on the lake, or of a walk among the icicles\r\nafterwards, were departing.  Thaw was setting in and by breakfast-\r\ntime there was a down-pouring rain.  Frank lingered about Cecil in\r\nhopes of a message to serve as an excuse for a rush to Sirenwood;\r\nbut she proved to be going to drive to the working-room, and then to\r\nlunch at Mrs. Duncombe\'s, to meet the Americans and the ladies from\r\nSirenwood, according to a note sent over in early morning at first\r\nsight of the wet.\r\n\r\nThereupon Frank found he had a last reference to make to his tutor,\r\nand begged for a lift.  A touch of warmth in Cecil would have opened\r\nthe flood-gates of his confidence, but she was exercised about a\r\nmistake in the accounts, and claimed his aid in tracking a defective\r\nseven-pence.  When she heard him utter the monstrous statement that\r\na hundred and five farthings were almost nine shillings, she looked\r\nat him with withering compassion, as sure to fail, and a small loss\r\nto Her Majesty; nor would she listen to any of his hints that he was\r\nvery curious to see her working-room.\r\n\r\nHis question to the tutor judiciously lasted till twelve, when he\r\ndropped in to consult Captain Duncombe about horse-hire in London;\r\nand that gentleman, who had been undergoing a course of political\r\neconomy all the morning, eagerly pounced on him for a tour of his\r\nstables, which lasted till luncheon was due, and he could casually\r\nenter the dining-room, where Lady Tyrrell held out her hand good-\r\nnaturedly to him, laughing at the blankness he could not entirely\r\nconceal.  "Only me!" she said.  "It can\'t be helped!  Poor Lenore\r\ncaught such a dreadful sore throat last night, that I have shut her\r\nup in her room with a mustard poultice."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!  I am very sorry."\r\n\r\n"You may well look horrified!  You were the guilty party, I suspect.\r\nTaking her all across the park under those dank trees!"\r\n\r\nHe coloured up to the eyes, little expecting to be thus convicted;\r\nbut Mrs. Duncombe came to his aid.  "My impartiality would impute\r\nthe damage to her standing about with those wretched little dogs of\r\nmine."\r\n\r\n"It is your climate," said Mrs. Tallboys.  "In our dry atmosphere\r\nthere would be no risk with a far lower temperature."\r\n\r\n"I hope it is nothing serious," said Frank, anxiously.\r\n\r\n"I hope so too," said Lady Tyrrell, looking archly into his face,\r\nwhich had not learnt such impenetrability as poor Lenore\'s.\r\n\r\n"No; but really?" he said, in anxiety that would not be rallied\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"This is the way," said Lady Tyrrell.  "Young gentlemen persuade\r\nyoung ladies to do the most imprudent things--saunter about in the\r\ncold after skating, and dawdle under trees, and then wonder when\r\nthey catch cold.--Do they do such things in your country, Mrs.\r\nTallboys, and expect the mammas and elder sisters to be gratified?"\r\n\r\n"Mammas and elder sisters are at a discount with you, are not they?"\r\nsaid Mrs. Duncombe.\r\n\r\n"Our young women are sufficient to protect themselves without our\r\nshowing tacit distrust, and encumbering them with guardianship,"\r\nreturned the Professor.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Charnock wishes we had reached that point," said Lady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\nShe had put him completely out of countenance.  He had not supposed\r\nher aware of his having been Lenore\'s companion, and was not certain\r\nwhether her sister had not after all confided in her, or if he\r\nhimself had not been an unconscious victim.  The public banter\r\njarred upon him; and while Cecil was making inquiries into the\r\nextent of the young ladies\' privileges in America, he was mentally\r\ncalculating the possibilities of rushing up to Sirenwood, trying to\r\nsee Lenore in spite of her throat, and ascertaining her position,\r\nbefore his train was due; but he was forced to resign the notion,\r\nfor Raymond had made an appointment for him in London which must not\r\nbe missed; and before luncheon was over the dog-cart, according to\r\nagreement with Charlie, called for him.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Mr. Frank," said Mrs. Duncombe; "will you have an old\r\nshoe thrown after you for luck?"\r\n\r\n"The time is not come for that yet," said Cecil, gravely.\r\n\r\n"Tending in that direction.  Eh, Charnock?" said the Captain.\r\n"Here\'s to your success--now, and in what\'s to come!"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Captain," said Frank, shaking his hand, liking the\r\nhearty voice.  "Lady Tyrrell, won\'t you give me your good wishes?"\r\nhe asked, half diffidently.\r\n\r\n"For the examination--yes, certainly," she replied.  "It is safer\r\nnot to look too far into your wishing-well."\r\n\r\n"And--and will you give my--my best regards to Le--to Miss Vivian,\r\nand say I grieve for her cold, and trust to her--to her good wishes--\r\n" he uttered, quick and fast, holding her hand all the time.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," she said quickly; "but last messages won\'t do when\r\ntrains are due."\r\n\r\n"Not due yet," said Frank; "but I must go home.  I\'ve not seen my\r\nmother to-day, and I shall not have a moment.--Good-bye, Cecil; have\r\nyou any commands for Raymond?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," said Cecil, gravely; and with a bow to the\r\nAmericans, he was gone.\r\n\r\n"That is one of your products of the highest English refinement?"\r\nsaid Mrs. Tallboys, whom in his preoccupation he had scarcely\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\n"How does he strike you?" said Cecil.  "He is my brother-in-law, but\r\nnever mind that."\r\n\r\n"He looks fitted for the hero of a vapid English novel.  I long to\r\nforce him to rough it, and to rub off that exquisite do-nothing air.\r\nIt irritates me!"\r\n\r\n"Frank Charnock has done a good deal of hard work, and is not to\r\nlead the life of an idle man," said Captain Duncombe.  "I know I\r\nshould not like to be in his shoes if he succeeds--grinding away in\r\nan office ten months out of the twelve."\r\n\r\n"In an office!  I should like to set him to work with an axe!"\r\n\r\n"Well, those dainty-looking curled darlings don\'t do badly in the\r\nbackwoods," said Lady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n"Ah!  I understand!  You stand up for him because there\'s a little\r\ntendresse for your sister," said the plain-spoken American.\r\n\r\n"Poor fellow!  I am afraid he is far gone.  It is an impossible\r\nthing, though, and the sooner he can be cured of it the better,"\r\nsaid Lady Tyrrell.  "I am sorry that walk took place yesterday.--Did\r\nhe mention it at home, Cecil?"\r\n\r\n"You are a very inconsistent woman, Lady Tyrrell," broke in Mrs.\r\nDuncombe in her abrupt way.  "Here you are come to uphold the\r\nemancipation of woman, and yet, when we come to your own sister\r\ntaking one poor walk--"\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, Bessie," said Lady Tyrrell, with her most\r\ncourteous manner.  "I never said I was come to uphold the\r\nemancipation of woman; only to subject myself to Mrs. Tallboys\'\r\ninfluence--she has to make a convert of me."\r\n\r\nFor, of course, Lady Tyrrell was only drawn into the controversy as\r\na matter of amusement, and possibly as something specially\r\ndistasteful to the house of Charnock Poynsett; and Cecil was a good\r\ndeal influenced by the fascination of her example, as well as by the\r\neagerness of Mrs. Duncombe and the charms of the Americans; and\r\nabove all, they conspired in making her feel herself important, and\r\nassuming that she must be foremost in all that was done.  She did\r\nnot controvert the doctrines of Dunstone so entirely as to embrace\r\nthe doctrines of emancipation, but she thought that free ventilation\r\nwas due to every subject, most especially when the Member\'s wife was\r\nthe leading lady in bringing about such discussion.  The opposition\r\nmade in the town to Mrs. Duncombe\'s sanitary plans, and the contempt\r\nwith which they had been treated as ladies\' fancies, had given a\r\npositive field of battle, with that admixture of right and wrong on\r\neither side which is essential to championship.  And in truth Cecil\r\nwas so much more under the influence of Camilla Tyrrell and Bessie\r\nDuncombe than under that of any other person, that she was ready to\r\nespouse any cause that they did.\r\n\r\nHow to arrange for the intended instruction was the difficulty,\r\nsince Wil\'sbro\' was without a town-hall, and, moreover, the\r\ninhabitants were averse to all varieties of change, either as to the\r\nclaims of women, the inequality of social laws, the improvement of\r\neducation, or the comprehension of social science--the regular\r\ncourse which Mrs. Clio W. Tallboys was wont to lecture.\r\n\r\nThe matter could only be managed by arranging a series of soirees at\r\ndifferent houses.  Mrs. Duncombe\'s rooms were far too small; but if\r\nsome person of more note--\'some swell\' as she said--would make the\r\nbeginning, there would be no difficulty in bringing others to follow\r\nsuit.\r\n\r\n"You must do it, Lady Tyrrell," said Mrs. Duncombe.\r\n\r\n"I!  If there\'s nobody else; but it would come much better from\r\nanother quarter," nodding at Cecil.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you wish you may get it?" muttered the slang-loving Bessie.\r\n\r\n"That\'s one point in which we leave you far behind," said Mrs.\r\nTallboys.  "We issue our invitations quite independently of the\r\nother members of the household.  Each has a separate visiting list."\r\n\r\n"There need be no difficulty," said Cecil; "all matters of visiting\r\nare in my hands.  It is necessary in our position; and if Lady\r\nTyrrell thinks it proper that I should give the first party, I will\r\ndo so."\r\n\r\n"Bravo, what fun!" cried Mrs. Duncombe, clapping her hands.  "You\r\nwon\'t get into a jolly row, though?" she added, anxiously.\r\n\r\n"I am perfectly sure of my ground," said Cecil, with the dignity of\r\none to whom a \'row\' was unheard of.  "It is the simple duty of a\r\nMember to come forward in promoting free discussion of opinions."\r\n\r\n"You are a public-spirited woman, Cecil," said Lady Tyrrell.  "When\r\nyou have made the first move, I\'ll follow.  Then whom shall we ask\r\nnext?"\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Moy," said Bessie.  "She is a nonentity herself, but if Gussie\r\nwere to be strongly bitten she could do more than any one else, and\r\nmake her father reform that nest of horrors in Water Lane!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid the freedom side will bite her more than the sanitary\r\nside," said Lady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n"She is capital fun, though, and a great ally of ours," said Mrs.\r\nDuncombe; "and the rooms at Proudfoot Lawn are worth anything!"\r\n\r\nOther details were fixed, even to the day of Cecil\'s opening party,\r\nwhich must take place on the first practicable day; but there was\r\nnone to be found till the Wednesday week, the day before Raymond\r\nwould return home.  Cecil did not recollect this till the day had\r\nbeen unanimously agreed on, and it was with a little alarm; but\r\nafter what she had asserted about her freedom of action, she could\r\nnot retract before the eyes of the American lady; and, as she said\r\nto herself, she could receive her own ladies\' party, without\r\ninterfering with any one else, in the library, so that no one had a\r\nright to object.  However, she had a certain anticipation of\r\nopposition, which caused her to act before announcing her intention;\r\nand thus it was that Rosamond found her dropping a number of notes\r\nthrough the slit in the lid of the post-box.  "Another dinner?" was\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\n"No, this is a soiree in the library, entirely for ladies; Mrs.\r\nTallboys is to explain her views in the evenings at the Principal\r\nhouses in the neighbourhood.  She will begin here on Wednesday\r\nweek."\r\n\r\n"Why, that\'s before Raymond comes back!"\r\n\r\n"This is entirely for women."\r\n\r\n"Women! women\'s rights!  How have you got Mrs. Poynsett to consent?"\r\n\r\n"I have carte blanche in these matters."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that you have not consulted her?  Does Raymond know?\r\nOh!  Yes, I see I have no right to ask; but, Cecil, for your own\r\nsake, I entreat you to consider what you are about, before running\r\ninto such a frightful scrape!" and Rosamond impulsively caught the\r\nhand that was still putting in a letter; but Cecil stood still, not\r\nwithdrawing or moving a muscle, perfectly impassive.  Rosamond went\r\non more eagerly, "Oh yes, I know you don\'t like me--I\'m only a poor\r\nbattered soldier\'s daughter, quite an unworthy associate for a\r\nCharnock of the Charnocks; but I can\'t help begging you to consider\r\nthe consequences of sending out invitations to hear this strange\r\nwoman hold forth in Mrs. Poynsett\'s own house, in your husband\'s\r\nabsence."\r\n\r\n"Thank you for your solicitude," said Cecil, dropping in her\r\nenvelope the instant the obstructive hand was removed, and going on\r\nher way with dignified self-possession; while Rosamond, in a tumult\r\nof indignation, which made her scarcely comprehensible, rushed up to\r\nher husband at his writing, and poured out her story.\r\n\r\nClio advocating female supremacy in Mrs. Poynsett\'s own house,\r\nwithout notice to her!  Should she be warned in time to stop the\r\nletters?  Should Raymond be written to?  Rosamond was for both,\r\nJulius for neither.  He said that either way would begin a system\r\nthat could never be forgiven; and that they had better consider\r\nthemselves as practically at the Rectory, and not interfere.\r\n\r\n"How can you be so cold-blooded?" cried she.\r\n\r\n"I do not want to do worse harm.  My mother will learn what is to\r\nhappen sooner or later; and then she can put a stop to it in any way\r\nshe chooses."\r\n\r\n"I wish she would send in Mrs. Crabtree with her tawse!" said\r\nRosamond.  "But is it right by Raymond to let his wife bring this\r\nYankee muse to talk her nonsense in his very rooms?"\r\n\r\n"You have argued with her?"\r\n\r\n"Or with a block--a stock--a stone!" raved Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Then depend upon it, to inform against her would be far worse than\r\nletting any amount of absurdity be talked.  I should like to know\r\nhow you would get over being so served!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t make comparisons, sir!  Poor things! they would not be the\r\nworse for a little of our foolishness!"\r\n\r\nThings settled themselves according to Julius\'s prediction; for Mr.\r\nBowater, coming up with his son Herbert to see his old friend, said,\r\n"What grand doings are you having here?  What is Raymond\'s wife up\r\nto?  Ladies\' conversazione--that\'s a new thing in these parts!"\r\n\r\n"I gave such matters up to her," said Mrs. Poynsett.  "Young people\r\nlike a little freedom of action; and there are changes in the\r\nneighbourhood since I was laid up."  It was a temporizing speech, to\r\navoid showing her total ignorance.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowater cleared his throat.  "Young folk may like freedom of\r\naction, but it don\'t always follow that it is good for them.  I hope\r\nshe won\'t get Raymond into a scrape, that\'s all--committing him and\r\nherself to a course of lectures by that Yankee woman on woman\'s\r\nrights."\r\n\r\n"It does not commit him; it is before he comes home, on Wednesday,"\r\nsaid Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Never mind that; what a woman does her husband does.  Look here,\r\nMrs. Poynsett, I brought over Jenny\'s note in my pocket; see, here\r\nare two--one to accept, and one to refuse, just as you choose."\r\n\r\n"Oh! accept, by all means," cried Mrs. Poynsett; "don\'t leave the\r\nwrong one!"\r\n\r\nThen she changed the conversation, so decidedly, that Mr. Bowater\r\ncould not resume his warning; but after taking leave of her, he met\r\nRosamond in the avenue, and could not help saying, "Pray, was my old\r\nfriend aware of Mrs. Raymond\'s doings?"\r\n\r\n"Have you told her?  Oh! I am so glad!"\r\n\r\n"Then it is as you said, Herbert.  Mrs. Raymond had left her in\r\nignorance!  The impudent baggage!  That\'s what the world is coming\r\nto!"\r\n\r\n"But what regular game Mrs. Poynsett was!" said Herbert.  "You could\r\nnot make out in the least that she had been left in the lurch; and\r\nI\'m sure she has a plan, by the way in which she desired Jenny and\r\nEdie to come."\r\n\r\n"Only make her understand that the Wil\'sbro\' folks are in a ticklish\r\nstate," said Mr. Bowater; "they are sulking already, because they\r\nsay the ladies have been stirring him up to put them to expense\r\nabout the drains."\r\n\r\n"Wil\'sbro\' isn\'t sweet," said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"There\'s been nothing amiss in my time," returned his father.\r\n"Perfectly healthy in all reason!  Ay! you may laugh, young folks,\r\nbut I never heard of any receipt to hinder people from dying; and\r\nlet well alone is a safe maxim."\r\n\r\n"If it be well," said Rosamond.  "However, Raymond says whatever is\r\ndone must be by general consent, and that small private attempts do\r\nmore harm than good."\r\n\r\n"He had better take care what he says.  If they fancy he is in\r\nleague with that ridiculous Duncombe woman against their pockets,\r\nMoy is on the watch to take advantage of it; and all the old family\r\ninterest will not save his seat."\r\n\r\nWhen Rosamond reached home she found Anne beside her mother-in-law,\r\nprovided with a quire of note-paper and pile of envelopes.  "My\r\ndear, I want your help," she said.  "Till my accident I always had a\r\nchildren\'s party at Christmas; and now I have so many young people\r\nto manage it for me, I think we might try again, and combine it with\r\nCecil\'s ladies\' party, on Wednesday."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" cried Rosamond.  "You mean that we should have plenty of\r\nfun--and, in fact, drum out the rights of woman."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, present a counter attraction.  You and Charlie and\r\nyour brothers, with the Bowaters, might do something?"\r\n\r\n"Trust me!" cried Rosamond.  "Oh! I am so thankful to Mr. Bowater.\r\nJulius and I had our blood boiling; and I said as much or more to\r\nCecil than woman could, but she minded me no more than the old white\r\ncockatoo; and Julius said our telling would only make more\r\nmischief."\r\n\r\n"He was quite right," said his mother.  "Let there not be one word\r\nof opposition, you know; only swamp it.  You could get up some\r\ncharades, and have something going on all the evening."\r\n\r\n"Trust me for that!  Oh! if my darling Aileen were but here!  But\r\nTom is the very model of an actor, and Terry is grand, if only we\r\ncan keep him out of the high tragedy line.  King Lear is the mildest\r\nthing he condescends to!"\r\n\r\n"Could you manage a Christmas-tree?  The taking up a room beforehand\r\nis inconvenient; but I should like to offer some little substantial\r\nbait, even to the grown-up;" and her eyes twinkled merrily.\r\n\r\n"I know a better thing," said Rosamond; "an enchanted grove with a\r\nbeneficent witch.  We did it at St. Awdry\'s, with bon-bons and\r\ntrumpery, in a little conservatory, hardly large enough to turn\r\nround in.  If I may have the key of the conservatory, I\'ll manage."\r\n\r\n"You shall have what you please; and perhaps you would kindly go and\r\nchoose the things at Backsworth.  There is a very good fancy shop\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, thank you!  How sweet!--Now, Anne, you will see what you\r\nshall see!"\r\n\r\n"Is there to be dancing?" asked Anne, humbly yet resolutely.\r\n\r\n"There shall not be, my dear, if it will spoil the evening for you,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Poynsett.\r\n\r\n"I promised," said Anne.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the servants came in with the preparations for the\r\nafternoon tea, closely followed by the ever punctual Cecil.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett asked her whether she would require the barouche on\r\nthe morrow, since Rosamond and Anne would want it to go to\r\nBacksworth, to obtain requisites for a children\'s entertainment to\r\ntake place on Wednesday.\r\n\r\n"Some friends of mine are coming on Wednesday," said Cecil\r\n\r\n"Indeed!  In Raymond\'s absence?"\r\n\r\n"This is not a dinner, but a ladies\' party."\r\n\r\n"Then it will combine the better."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," replied Cecil.  "Mine is simply intellectual--only\r\na few intelligent women to meet Mrs. Tallboys in the library.  It\r\nwill be quite apart from any amusements Rosamond may like to have\r\nfor the children in the drawing-room."\r\n\r\n"Pray, will they require nothing but this feast of reason and flow\r\nof soul?--for the housekeeper will need warning."\r\n\r\n"They will have dined.  Nothing but coffee will be wanted."\r\n\r\n"For how many?"\r\n\r\n"About twelve or fourteen, thank you.  Excuse me--I have something\r\nto finish in my own room."\r\n\r\nThey were very glad to excuse her, and the following note was\r\nconcocted to serve both for those she might have invited and those\r\nshe might not; and it was copied by the two daughters for all the\r\nacquaintance who had young folks in their houses.  An appearance of\r\nwant of unanimity was carefully avoided, and it stood thus:--\r\n\r\n"I am desired by Mrs. Poynsett to say that the ladies\' party already\r\nproposed for the 3rd is to undergo a little expansion, and that she\r\nmuch hopes to see you and ---, at 7 p.m., disposed for a few\r\nChristmas amusements."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\nThe Drive To Backsworth\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was betrothed to one now dead,\r\nOr worse, who had dishonoured fled.--SCOTT\r\n\r\nThe party set out for Backsworth early in the day.  It included\r\nJulius, who had asked for a seat in the carriage in order to be able\r\nto go on to Rood House, where lived Dr. Easterby, whom he had not\r\nseen since he had been at Compton.\r\n\r\n"The great light of the English Church," said Rosamond, gaily; while\r\nAnne shuddered a little, for Miss Slater had told her that he was\r\nthe great fountain-head of all that distressed her in Julius and his\r\ncurates.  But Julius merely said, "I am very glad of the\r\nopportunity;" and the subject dropped in the eager discussion of the\r\nintended pastimes, which lasted beyond the well-known Wil\'sbro\'\r\nbounds, when again Julius startled a Anne by observing, "No dancing?\r\nThat is a pity."\r\n\r\n"There, Anne!" exclaimed Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"It was out of kindness to me," said Anne:  and then, with a\r\nwonderful advance of confidence, she added, "Please tell me how you,\r\na minister, can regret it?"\r\n\r\n"Because I think it would be easier to prevent mischief than when\r\nthere has to be a continual invention of something original.  There\r\nis more danger of offence and uncharitableness, to speak plainly."\r\n\r\n"And you think that worse than dancing?" said Anne, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"Why is dancing bad at all, Anne?" asked Rosamond.\r\n\r\nAnne answered at once, "It is worldly."\r\n\r\n"Not half so worldly as driving in a carriage with fine horses, and\r\nliveries, and arms, and servants, and all," said Rosamond from her\r\ncomfortable corner, nestling under Miles\'s racoon-skin rug; "I\r\nwonder you can do that!"\r\n\r\n"The carriage is not mine," said Anne.\r\n\r\n"The worldliness would be in sacrificing a duty to the luxury and\r\nostentation of keeping one," said Julius.  "For instance, if I\r\nconsidered it due to my lady in the corner there to come out in this\r\nstyle, and put down a curate and a few such trifles with that\r\nobject.  To my mind, balls stand on the same ground; they are\r\ninnocent as long as nothing right is given up for them."\r\n\r\n"You would not dance?" said Anne.\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t he?" said Rosamond.  "I\'ve seen him.  It was at St.\r\nAwdry\'s at a Christmas party, in our courting days.  No, it wasn\'t\r\nwith me.  Oh no!  That was the cruel cut!  It was with little Miss\r\nMarks, whose father had just risen from the ranks.  Such a figure\r\nshe was, enough to set your teeth on edge; when, behold! this\r\nreverend minister extracts her from the wall-flowers, and goes\r\nthrough the Lancers with her in first-rate style, I assure you.  It\r\nhad such an effect, do you know, that what does my father do but go\r\nand ask her next; and I heard an old lady remarking that there were\r\nonly two gentlemen in the room, Mr. Charnock and Lord Rathforlane.\r\nSo you see it was all worldliness after all, Anne."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it was good-nature," said Anne.\r\n\r\n"Indignation, I fancy," said Julius.\r\n\r\n"Now, was he very wicked for it, Anne?"\r\n\r\n"N--no, if dancing be not wrong."\r\n\r\n"But why should it?"\r\n\r\n"All the bad people danced in the Bible."\r\n\r\n"Miriam--King David, eh?"\r\n\r\n"That was part of their religious service."\r\n\r\n"The welcome to the prodigal son?" further suggested Julius.  "Does\r\nnot this prove that the exercise is not sinful in itself?"\r\n\r\n"But you would not do it again?" repeated Anne.\r\n\r\n"I certainly should not make a practice of it, nor go to balls any\r\nmore than I would be a sportsman or a cricketer, because I am bound\r\nto apply my whole self to the more direct service; but this does not\r\nshow that there is evil necessarily connected with these amusements,\r\nor that they may not safely be enjoyed by those who have time, and\r\nwho need an outlet for their spirits, or by those who wish to guard\r\nthese pleasures by presiding over them."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t persuade me!" exclaimed Anne.  "I gave my word to Mr. Pilgrim\r\nthat nothing should induce me to dance or play at cards."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Pilgrim had no right--" began Rosamond; but Julius hushed her,\r\nsaying, "No one wishes to persuade you, Anne.  Your retirement\r\nduring Miles\'s absence is very suitable and becoming."\r\n\r\n"Till we live in the Bush, out of the way of it all," said Anne.\r\n\r\n"I wish you could have seen one of our real old Christmas parties;\r\nbut those can never be again, without mother herself or Mrs.\r\nDouglas."\r\n\r\n"Do tell me about those Douglases," said Rosamond.  "Cecil hinted at\r\nsome romance, but seemed to think you had suppressed the connection\r\nbecause he was an attorney."\r\n\r\n"Not exactly," said Julius, smiling; "but it is a sad story, though\r\nwe have no doubt he bore the guilt of others."\r\n\r\n"Something about two thousand pounds!"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  It was the year that my mother and Raymond were abroad.  She\r\nhad been buying some property near, and sent home an order from\r\nVevay.  It did not come, and was inquired for; but as it was an\r\norder, not a draft, it was not stopped at the bank; and in about a\r\nfortnight more it was presented by a stranger, and paid without\r\nhesitation, as it was endorsed "Proudfoot and Moy."  Old Proudfoot\r\nwas away at Harrogate, and came home to investigate; young Proudfoot\r\ndenied all knowledge of it, and so did his brother-in-law Moy; but\r\nRaymond, working at the other end, found that the waiter at the\r\nhotel at Vevay had forgotten to post the letter for more than a\r\nweek, and it was traced through the post to Wil\'sbro\', where the\r\npostman remembered delivering a foreign-looking letter to Archie\r\nDouglas at the door of the office.  It came alone by the afternoon\r\npost.  His account was this:  They were all taking it rather easy in\r\nold Proudfoot\'s absence; and when a sudden summons came to take the\r\nold farmer\'s instructions for his will, Archie, as the junior, was\r\ntold off to do it.  He left George Proudfoot and Moy in a private\r\nroom at the office, with Tom Vivian leaning over the fire talking,\r\nas he had a habit of doing in old Proudfoot\'s absence.  As he opened\r\nthe office door the postman put the letter into his hand; and\r\nrecognizing the writing, he ran back, and gave it in triumph to\r\nGeorge Proudfoot, exclaiming that there it was at last, but he was\r\nin danger of being late for the train, and did not wait to see it\r\nopened; and when he came back he was told that it had been merely a\r\nletter of inquiry, with nothing in it, and destroyed at once.  That\r\nwas his account; but Proudfoot, Moy, and Vivian all denied any\r\nknowledge of this return of his, or of the letter.  The night of\r\nthis inquiry he was missing.  Jenny Bowater, who was with an aunt in\r\nLondon, heard that a gentleman had called to see her while she was\r\nout for a couple of days; and a week later we saw his name among the\r\npassengers lost in the Hippolyta off Falmouth."\r\n\r\n"Poor Jenny!  Was she engaged to him?"\r\n\r\n"On sufferance.  On her death-bed Mrs. Douglas had wrung from Mr.\r\nBowater a promise that if Archie did well, and ever had means\r\nenough, he would not refuse consent; but he always distrusted poor\r\nArchie, because of his father, and I believe he sent Jenny away to\r\nbe out of his reach.  If any of us had only been near, I think we\r\ncould have persuaded him to face it out, and trust to his innocence;\r\nbut Raymond was abroad, Miles at sea, I at Oxford, and nothing like\r\na counsellor was near.  If Jenny had but seen him!"\r\n\r\n"And has nothing happened to clear him?"\r\n\r\n"No.  Raymond hurried home, and did his best, but all in vain.\r\nGeorge Proudfoot was indeed known to have been in debt to Vivian;\r\nbut Moy, his brother-in-law, an older man, was viewed as a person\r\nwhose word was above all question, and they both declared the\r\nsignature at the back of the order not to be genuine.  Archie\'s\r\nflight, you see, made further investigation impossible; and there\r\nwas no putting on oath, no cross-examination."\r\n\r\n"Then you think those three had it?"\r\n\r\n"We can think nothing else, knowing Archie as we did.  Raymond\r\nshowed his suspicions so strongly, that old Proudfoot threw up all\r\nagencies for our property, and there has been a kind of hostility\r\never since.  Poor Vivian, as you know, came to his sad end the next\r\nyear, but he had destroyed all his papers; and George Proudfoot has\r\nbeen dead four or five years, but without making any sign.  Moy has\r\nalmost risen above the business, and--see, there\'s Proudfoot Lawn,\r\nwhere he lives with the old man.  He claims to compete with the\r\ncounty families, and would like to contest Wils\'bro\' with Raymond."\r\n\r\n"And Jenny?" asked Anne.  "Did she bear it as a Christian?  I know\r\nshe would."\r\n\r\n"She did indeed--most nobly, most patiently.  Poor girl! at her own\r\nhome she knew she stood alone in her faith in Archie\'s innocence;\r\nbut they were kind and forbearing, and kept silence, and the\r\nknowledge of our trust in him has bound her very close to us."\r\n\r\n"Was that call, when she did not see him, all she ever heard of\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"All! except that he left a fragment of paper with the servant, with\r\nthe one pencil scrawl, \'A Dieu!\'--a capital D to mark the full\r\nmeaning.  She once showed it to me--folded so as to fit into the\r\nback of a locket with his photograph."\r\n\r\n"Dear Jenny!  And had you traced him on board this ship?"\r\n\r\n"No, but his name was in the list; and we knew he had strong fancy\r\nfor South Africa, whither the Hippolyta was bound.  In fact he ought\r\nto have been a sailor, and only yielded to his mother\'s wishes."\r\n\r\n"We knew a Mr. Archibald Douglas once," said Anne; "he came and\r\noutspanned by us when he was going north after elephants.  He stayed\r\na fortnight, because his wagon had to be mended."\r\n\r\n"O, Julius! if we could but find him for her again!" cried Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid Archibald Douglas is not much more individual a name\r\nthan John Smith," said Julius, sadly.\r\n\r\n"That tells as much against the Hippolyta man," said Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Poor Archie would not be difficult to identify," said Julius; "for\r\nhis hair was like mine, though his eyes were blue, and not short-\r\nsighted."\r\n\r\n"That is all right, then," cried Anne; "for we had a dispute whether\r\nhe were young or old, and I remember mamma saying he had a look\r\nabout him as if his hair might have turned white in a single night."\r\n\r\n"Julius!  Now won\'t you believe?" cried Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Had he a Scotch accent?" said Julius.\r\n\r\n"No; I recollect papa\'s telling him he never should have guessed him\r\nto be a Scot by his tongue; and he said he must confess that he had\r\nnever seen Scotland."\r\n\r\n"Now, Julius!" pleaded Rosamond, with clasped hands, as if Jenny\'s\r\nfate hung on his opinion.\r\n\r\n"How long ago was this?" asked he.\r\n\r\n"Four years," said Anne, with a little consideration.  "He came both\r\nin going and returning, and Alick was wild to join him if he ever\r\npassed our way again.  My father liked him so much that he was\r\nalmost ready to consent; but he never came again.  Ivory hunters go\r\nmore from Natal now."\r\n\r\n"You will trace him!  There\'s a dear Anne!" exclaimed Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"I will write to them at home; Alick knows a good many hunters, and\r\ncould put Miles into the way of making inquiries, if he touches at\r\nNatal on his way home."\r\n\r\n"Miles will do all he can," said Julius; "he was almost broken-\r\nhearted when he found how Archie had gone.  I think he was even more\r\nhis hero than Raymond when we were boys, because he was more\r\nenterprising; and my mother always thought Archie\'s baffled passion\r\nfor the sea reacted upon Miles."\r\n\r\n"He will do it!  He will find him, if he is the Miles I take him\r\nfor!  How old was he--Archie, I mean?"\r\n\r\n"A year older than Raymond; but he always seemed much younger, he\r\nwas so full of life and animation--so unguarded, poor fellow!  He\r\nused to play tricks with imitating hand-writing; and these, of\r\ncourse, were brought up against him."\r\n\r\n"Thirty-four!  Not a bit too old for the other end of the romance!"\r\n\r\n"Take care, Rosie.  Don\'t say a word to Jenny till we know more.\r\nShe must not be unsettled only to be disappointed."\r\n\r\n"Do you think she would thank you for that, you cold-blooded\r\nanimal?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; but I think the suspense would be far more trying\r\nthan the quiet resigned calm that has settled down on her.  Besides,\r\nyou must remember that even if Archie were found, the mystery has\r\nnever been cleared up."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think that would make any difference to Jenny?"\r\n\r\n"It makes all the difference to her father; and Jenny will never be\r\na disobedient daughter."\r\n\r\n"Oh! but it will--it must be cleared!  I know it will!  It is\r\nfaithless to think that injustice is not always set right!"\r\n\r\n"Not always here," said Julius, sadly.  "See, there\'s the Backsworth\r\nrace-ground, the great focus of the evil."\r\n\r\n"Were racing debts thought to have any part in the disaster?"\r\n\r\n"That I can\'t tell; but it was those races that brought George\r\nProudfoot under the Vivian influence; and in the absence of all of\r\nus, poor Archie, when left to himself after his mother\'s death, had\r\nbecome enough mixed up in their amusements to give a handle to those\r\nwho thought him unsteady."\r\n\r\n"As if any one must be unsteady who goes to the races!" cried\r\nRosamond.  "You were so liberal about balls, I did expect one little\r\ngood word for races; instead of which, you are declaring a poor\r\nwretch who goes to them capable of embezzling two thousand pounds,\r\nand I dare say Anne agrees with you!"\r\n\r\n"Now, did I ever say so, Anne?"\r\n\r\n"You looked at the course with pious horror, and said it justified\r\nthe suspicion!" persisted Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"That\'s better," said Julius; "though I never even said it justified\r\nthe suspicion, any more than I said that balls might not easily be\r\noverdone, especially by _some_ people."\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t defend races?" said Anne.\r\n\r\n"No; I think the mischief they do is more extensive, and has less\r\nmitigation than is the case with any other public amusement."\r\n\r\n"H\'m!" said Rosamond.  "Many a merry day have I had on the top of\r\nthe regimental drag; so perhaps there\'s nothing of which you would\r\nnot suspect me."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what I more than suspect you of," said Julius, "of\r\nwearing a gay bonnet to be a bait and a sanction to crowds of young\r\ngirls, to whom the place was one of temptation, though not to you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, there would be no end to it if one thought of such things."\r\n\r\n"Or the young men who--"\r\n\r\n"Well," broke in Rosamond, "it was always said that our young\r\nofficers got into much less mischief than where there was a\r\nstraight-laced colonel, who didn\'t go along with them to give them a\r\ntone."\r\n\r\n"That I quite believe.  I remember, too, the intense and breathless\r\nsense of excitement in the hush and suspense of the multitude, and\r\nthe sweeping by of the animals--"\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ve been!" cried his wife.\r\n\r\n"As a boy, yes."\r\n\r\n"Not since you were old enough to think it over?" said Anne eagerly.\r\n\r\n"No.  It seemed to me that the amount of genuine interest in the\r\nsport and the animals was infinitesimal compared with the fictitious\r\nexcitement worked up by betting."\r\n\r\n"And what\'s the harm of betting when you\'ve got the money?"\r\n\r\n"And when you haven\'t?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s another question."\r\n\r\n"Do you approve it at the best?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a man\'s own concern."\r\n\r\n"That\'s arguing against your better sense."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t be helped, with two such solemn companions!  There would be\r\nno bearing you if I didn\'t take you down sometimes, when you get so\r\ndidactic, and talk of fictitious excitement, indeed!  And now you\r\nare going to Rood House, what will you be coming back?"\r\n\r\nRood House stood about two miles on the further side of Backsworth.\r\nIt was an ancient almshouse, of which the mastership had been wisely\r\ngiven to Dr. Easterby, one of the deepest theological scholars,\r\nholiest men, and bravest champions of the Church, although he was\r\ntoo frail in health to do much, save with his pen, and in council\r\nwith the numerous individuals who resorted to him from far and wide,\r\nand felt the beautiful old fragment of a monastic building where he\r\ndwelt a true court of peace and refreshment, whence they came forth,\r\naided by prayer and counsel, for their own share of the combat.\r\n\r\nJulius Charnock had, happily for himself, found his way thither when\r\nhis character and opinions were in process of formation, and had\r\never since looked to Rood House for guidance and sympathy.  To be\r\nonly fourteen miles distant had seemed to him one great perfection\r\nof Compton Poynsett; but of course he had found visits there a far\r\nmore possible thing to an unoccupied holiday son of the great house\r\nthan to a busy parish priest, so that this opportunity was very\r\nvaluable to him.\r\n\r\nAnd so it proved; not so much for the details as for the spirit in\r\nwhich he was aided in looking at everything, from the mighty\r\nquestions which prove the life of the Church by the vehement emotion\r\nthey occasion, down to the difficulties of theory and practice that\r\nharassed himself--not named, perhaps, but still greatly unravelled.\r\n\r\nThose perpetual questions, that have to be worked out again and\r\nagain by each generation, were before him in dealing with his\r\nparish; and among them stood in his case the deeper aspects of the\r\nquestion that had come forward on the drive, namely, the lawfulness\r\nand expedience of amusement.\r\n\r\nGranting the necessity of pastimes and recreation for most persons,\r\nspecially the young, there opened the doubtful, because ever-\r\nvarying, question of the kind and the quantity to be promoted or\r\nsanctioned, lest restraint should lead to reaction, and lest\r\nabstinence should change from purity and spirituality to moroseness\r\nor hypocrisy.  And if Julius found one end of the scale represented\r\nby his wife and his junior curate, his sister-in-law and his senior\r\ncurate were at the other.  Yet the old recluse was far more inclined\r\nto toleration than he had been in principle himself, though the spur\r\nof the occasion had led him to relaxations towards others in the\r\nindividual cases brought before him, when he had thought opposition\r\nwould do more harm than the indulgence.  His conscience had been\r\nuneasy at this divergence, till he could discuss the subject.\r\n\r\nThe higher the aspiration of the soul, the less, of course, would be\r\nthe craving for diversion, the greater the shrinking from those evil\r\naccompaniments that soon mar the most innocent delights.  Some\r\nspirits are austere in their purity, like Anne; some so fervent in\r\nzeal, as to heed nothing by the way, like Mr. Bindon; but most are\r\nin an advanced stage of childhood, and need play and pleasure almost\r\nas much as air or food; and these instincts require wholesome\r\ngratification, under such approval as may make the enjoyment bright\r\nand innocent; and yet there should be such subduing of their excess,\r\nsuch training in discipline, as shall save them from frivolity and\r\nfrom passing the line of evil, prevent the craving from growing to a\r\npassion, and where it has so grown, tone it back to the limits of\r\nobedience and safety.\r\n\r\nAlas! perhaps there lay the domestic difficulty of which Julius\r\ncould not speak; yet, as if answering the thought, Dr. Easterby\r\nsaid, "After all, charity is the true self-acting balance to many a\r\nsweet untaught nature.  Self-denials which spring out of love are a\r\ngreat safeguard, because they are almost sure to be both humble and\r\nunconscious."\r\n\r\nAnd Julius went away cheered as he thought of his Rosamond\'s wells\r\nof unselfish affection, confident that all the cravings for variety\r\nand excitement, which early habit had rendered second nature, would\r\nbe absorbed by the deeper and keener feelings within, and that these\r\nwould mount higher as time went on, under life\'s great training.\r\n\r\nPleasant it was to see the triumphant delight of the two sisters\r\nover their purchases.  Such a day\'s English shopping was quite a new\r\nexperience to Anne; and she had not been cautioned against it, so\r\nher enjoyment was as fresh and vivid as a child\'s; and they both\r\nchattered all the way home with a merriment in which Julius fully\r\nshared, almost surprised to see Anne so eager and lively, and--as\r\nher cheeks glowed and her eyes brightened--beginning to understand\r\nwhat had attracted Miles.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett had not had quite so pleasant a day, for Cecil knocked\r\nat her door soon after luncheon with an announcement that Lady\r\nTyrrell wished for admission.  Expecting an exposition of the Clio\r\nscheme, she resigned herself, looking with some curiosity at the\r\nbeautiful contour of face and drooping pensive loveliness, that had\r\nrather gained than lost in grace since the days when she had deemed\r\nthem so formidable.\r\n\r\n"This is kind, dear Mrs. Poynsett," said the soft voice, while the\r\nhand insisted on a pressure.  "I have often wished to come and see\r\nyou, but I could not venture without an excuse."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," was the cold reply.\r\n\r\n"I have more than an excuse--a reason, and I think we shall be fully\r\nagreed; but first you must let me have the pleasure of one look to\r\nrecall old times.  It is such a treat to see you so unchanged.  I\r\nhope you do not still suffer."\r\n\r\n"No, thank you."\r\n\r\n"And are you always a prisoner here?  Ah!  I know your patience."\r\n\r\n"What was the matter on which you wanted to speak to me?" said Mrs.\r\nPoynsett, fretted beyond endurance by the soft, caressing tone.\r\n\r\n"As I said, I should hardly venture if I did not know we agreed--\r\nthough perhaps not for the same reasons.  We do agree in our love\r\nand high opinion of your dear Frank!"\r\n\r\n"Well!" repressing a shudder at the \'dear.\'\r\n\r\n"I am afraid we likewise agree that, under all circumstances, our\r\ntwo young people are very unfortunately attached, and that we must\r\nbe hard-hearted, and let it go no further."\r\n\r\n"You mean your sister?"\r\n\r\n"My dear Lena!  I cannot wonder!  I blame myself excessively, for it\r\nwas all through my own imprudence.  You see, when dear Frank came to\r\nRockpier, it was so delightful to renew old times, and they both\r\nseemed such children, that I candidly confess I was off my guard;\r\nbut as soon as I had any suspicion, I took care to separate them,\r\nknowing that, in the state of my poor father\'s affairs, it would be\r\nmost unjustifiable to let so mere a youth be drawn into an\r\nattachment."\r\n\r\n"Frank is no prize," said his mother with some irony.\r\n\r\n"I knew you would say that, dear Mrs. Poynsett.  Pecuniarily\r\nspeaking, of course, he is not; though as to all qualities of the\r\nheart and head, he is a prize in the true sense of the word.  But,\r\nalas! it is a sort of necessity that poor Lena, if she marry at all,\r\nshould marry to liberal means.  I tell you candidly that she has not\r\nbeen brought up as she ought to have been, considering her\r\nexpectations or no expectations.  What could you expect of my poor\r\nfather, with his habits, and two mere girls?  I don\'t know whether\r\nthe governess could have done anything; but I know that it was quite\r\ntime I appeared.  I tell you in confidence, dear Mrs. Poynsett,\r\nthere was a heavy pull on my own purse before I could take them away\r\nfrom Rockpier; and, without blaming a mere child like poor dear Lena\r\nyou can see what sort of preparation she has had for a small\r\nincome."\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say which tried Mrs. Poynsett\'s patience most, the\r\n\'dears\' or the candour; and the spirit of opposition probably\r\nprompted her to say, "Frank has his share, like his brothers."\r\n\r\n"I understand, and for many girls the provision would be ample; but\r\npoor Lena has no notion of economizing--how should she?  I am afraid\r\nthere is no blinking it, that, dear children as they both are,\r\nnothing but wretchedness could result from their corning together;\r\nand thus I have been extremely sorry to find that the affair has\r\nbeen renewed."\r\n\r\n"It was not an unnatural result of their meeting again."\r\n\r\n"Ah! there I was to blame again; but no one can judge whether an\r\nattachment be real between such children.  I thought, too, that\r\nFrank would be gone out into the world, and I confess I did not\r\nexpect to find that he had absolutely addressed her, and kept it\r\nsecret.  That is what my poor father feels so much.  Eleonora is his\r\nspecial darling, and he says he could have overlooked anything but\r\nthe concealment."\r\n\r\nMaternal affection assumed the defensive; and, though the idea of\r\nconcealment on the part of one of her sons was a shock, Mrs.\r\nPoynsett made no betrayal of herself, merely asking, "How did it\r\ncome to light?"\r\n\r\n"I extorted the confession.  I think I was justified, standing in a\r\nmother\'s position, as I do.  I knew my vigilance had been eluded,\r\nand that your son had walked home with her after the skating; and\r\nyou know very well how transparent young things are."\r\n\r\nThe skating!  The mother at once understood that Frank was only\r\npostponing the explanation till after his examination; and besides,\r\nshe had never been ignorant of his attachment, and could not regard\r\nany display thereof more or less as deception towards herself.  The\r\nvery fact that Lady Tyrrell was trying to prejudice her beforehand,\r\nso as to deprive him of the grace of taking the initiative towards\r\nhis own mother, enlisted her feelings in his defence, so she coldly\r\nanswered, "I am sorry if Sir Harry Vivian thinks himself unfairly\r\ntreated; but I should have thought my son\'s feelings had been as\r\nwell known in the one family as in the other."\r\n\r\n"But, _dear_ Mrs. Poynsett," exclaimed Lady Tyrrell, "I am sure you\r\nnever encouraged them.  I am quite enough aware--whatever I may once\r\nhave been--of the unfortunate contrast between our respective\r\nfamilies."\r\n\r\nCertainly there was no connection Mrs. Poynsett less wished to\r\nencourage; yet she could not endure to play into Camilla\' hands, and\r\nmade reply, "There are many matters in which young men must judge\r\nfor themselves.  I have only once see Miss Vivian, and have no means\r\nof estimating my son\'s chance of happiness with her."\r\n\r\nHer impenetrability ruffled Lady Tyrrell; but the answer was softer\r\nthan ever.  "Dear Mrs. Poynsett, what a happy mother you are, to be\r\nable so freely to allow your sons to follow their inclinations!\r\nWell! since you do not object, my conscience is easy on that score;\r\nbut it was more than I durst hope."\r\n\r\nTo have one\'s approval thus stolen was out of the question and Mrs.\r\nPoynsett said, "Regret is one thing, opposition another.  Sir Harry\r\nVivian need not doubt that, when my son\'s position is once fixed, he\r\nwill speak openly and formally, and it will then be time to judge."\r\n\r\n"Only," said Lady Tyrrell, rising, "let this be impressed on your\r\nson.  Eleonora cannot marry till she is of age, and my father cannot\r\nsanction any previous entanglement.  Indeed it is most unfortunate,\r\nif her affections have been tampered with, for me, who have outgrown\r\nromance, and know that, in her position, a wealthy match is a\r\nnecessity.  I have spoken candidly," she repeated; "for I like Frank\r\ntoo well to bear that he should be trifled with and disappointed."\r\n\r\n"Thank you!"\r\n\r\nThe ladies parted, liking one another, if possible, less than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett\'s instinct of defence had made her profess much less\r\ndistaste to the marriage than she really felt; she was much\r\nconcerned that another son should be undergoing Raymond\'s sad\r\nexperiences, but she had no fear that Lady Tyrrell would ever allow\r\nit to come to a marriage, and she did not think Frank\'s poetical\r\nenthusiasm and admiration for beauty betokened a nature that would\r\nsuffer such an enduring wound as Raymond\'s had done.\r\n\r\nSo she awaited his return, without too much uneasiness for amusement\r\nin Rosamond\'s preparations.  One opening into the conservatory was\r\nthrough her room, so that every skilful device, or gay ornament,\r\ncould be exhibited to her; and she much enjoyed the mirth that went\r\non between the queen of the revels and her fellow-workers.\r\n\r\nCecil did not interfere, being indeed generally with her friends at\r\nSirenwood, Aucuba Villa, or the working-room, in all of which she\r\nhad the pleasure of being treated as a person of great\r\nconsideration, far superior to all her natural surroundings, and on\r\nwhom hinged all the plans for the amelioration of Willansborough.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, it happens that the other side of a question is\r\npresented; and thus it was on the day before the entertainment, when\r\nRosamond had taken her brother Tom to have his hair cut, and to\r\nchoose some false moustaches, and the like requisites for their\r\ncharades.\r\n\r\nThey went first to Pettitt\'s, the little hair-dresser, where Tom was\r\nmarvellously taken with the two Penates, and could hardly be dragged\r\ninto the innermost recesses, where in the middle of a sheet, with a\r\npeignoir on his shoulders, he submitted to the clipping of his\r\nraven-black locks, as Mr. Pettitt called them, on the condition of\r\nhis sister looking on.\r\n\r\nPresently they heard some feet enter the outer shop, and Mrs.\r\nDuncombe\'s voice asking for Mr. Pettitt; while his mother replied\r\nthat he would wait on her immediately, but that he was just now\r\nengaged with the Honourable Mr. De Lancey.  "Could she show them\r\nanything?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, thank you, we\'ll wait!  Don\'t let us keep you, Mrs. Pettitt,\r\nit is only on business."\r\n\r\n"Ay!" said the other voice--female, and entirely untamed.  "He\'s\r\nyour great ally about your gutters and drains, isn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"The only landowner in Wil\'sbro\' who has a particle of public\r\nspirit!" said Mrs. Duncombe.\r\n\r\nWhereat good-natured Lady Rosamond could not but smile\r\ncongratulation to the hair-cutter, who looked meekly elevated, while\r\nTom whispered, "Proverb contradicted."\r\n\r\nBut the other voice replied, "Of course--he\'s a perfumer, learned in\r\nsmells!  You\'d better drop it, Bessie! you\'ll never make anything of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll never drop what the health and life of hundreds of my fellow-\r\ncreatures depend on!  I wish I could make you understand, Gussie!"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll never do anything with my governor, if that\'s your hope--you\r\nshould hear him and the mum talking!  \'It\'s all nonsense,\' he says;\r\n\'I\'m not going to annoy my tenants, and make myself unpopular, just\r\nto gratify a fashionable cry.\'  \'Well,\' says mumsey, \'it is not what\r\nwas thought the thing for ladies in my time; but you see, if Gussie\r\ngoes along with it, she will have the key to all the best county\r\nsociety.\'  \'Bother the county society!\' says I.  \'Bessie Duncombe\'s\r\njolly enough--but such a stuck-up set as they all are at Compton,\r\nI\'ll not run after, behaving so ill to the governor, too!\'  However--"\r\n\r\n"There\'s a proverb about listeners!" said Rosamond, emerging when\r\nshe felt as if she ought to hearken no longer, and finding Mrs.\r\nDuncombe leaning with her back to the counter, and a tall girl, a\r\nfew degrees from beauty, in a riding-habit, sitting upon it.\r\n\r\nThey both laughed; and the girl added, "If you had waited a moment,\r\nLady Rosamond, you would have heard that you were the only jolly one\r\nof all the b\'iling!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! we shall see where you are at the end of Mrs. Tallboys\'\r\nlectures!" said Mrs. Duncombe.\r\n\r\n"On what?" asked Rosamond.  "Woman\'s rights, or sanitary measures?\r\nfor I can\'t in the least understand why they should be coupled up\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"Nor I!" said Miss Moy.  "I don\'t see why we shouldn\'t have our own\r\nway, just as well as the men; but what that has to do with drains\r\nand gutters, I can\'t guess."\r\n\r\n"I\'m the other way," said Rosamond.  "I think houses and streets\r\nought to be made clean and healthy; but as for woman\'s rule, I fancy\r\nwe get more of it now than we should the other way."\r\n\r\n"As an instance," said Mrs. Duncombe, "woman is set on cleansing\r\nWil\'sbro\'.  Man will not stir.  Will it ever be done till woman has\r\nher way?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, if woman would be patient, man would do it in the right\r\nway, instead of the wrong!" quoth Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Patient!  No, indeed!  Nothing is to be done by that!  Let every\r\nwoman strive her utmost to get the work done as far as her powers\r\ngo, and the crusade will be accomplished for very shame!"\r\n\r\nJust then Tom, looking highly amused, emerged, followed by Mr.\r\nPettitt, the only enlightened landlord on whom Mrs. Duncombe had\r\nbeen able to produce the slightest impression.  He had owned a few\r\nsmall tenements in Water Lane, which he was about to rebuild, and\r\nwhich were evidently the pivot of operations.\r\n\r\nAt the door they met Cecil, and Rosamond detained her a moment in\r\nthe street to say, "My dear Cecil, is _that_ Miss Moy coming on\r\nWednesday?"\r\n\r\n"Of course she is.  We greatly want to move her father.  He has the\r\nchief house property there."\r\n\r\n"It is too late now," said Rosamond; "but do you think it can be\r\npleasant to Jenny Bowater to meet her?"\r\n\r\n"I know nothing of the old countrified animosities and gossipings,\r\nwhich you have so heartily adopted," replied Cecil, proudly.\r\n"Firstly, I ignore them as beneath me; secondly, I sacrifice them\r\nall to a great cause.  If Miss Bowater does not like my guests, let\r\nher stay away."\r\n\r\nHere Mrs. Duncombe stood on the step, crying out, "Well, Cecil, how\r\nhave you sped with Mrs. Bungay?"\r\n\r\n"Horrid woman!" and no more was heard, as Cecil entered Mr.\r\nPettitt\'s establishment.\r\n\r\n"That might be echoed," said Tom, who was boiling over at the speech\r\nto his sister.  "I knew that ape was an intolerable little prig of a\r\npeacock, but I didn\'t think she could be such a brute to you, Rosie!\r\nIs she often like that, and does your parson stand such treatment of\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Tom!" said Rosamond; "it doesn\'t often happen, and breaks\r\nno bones when it does.  It\'s only the ignorance of the woman, and\r\nsmall blame to her--as Mrs. M\'Kinnon said when Corporal Sims\'s wife\r\nthrew the red herring\'s tail at her!"\r\n\r\n"But does Julius stand it?" repeated Tom, fiercely, as if hesitating\r\nwhether to call out Julius or Mrs. Charnock Poynsett.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be so ridiculous, Tom!  I\'d rather stand a whole shower of\r\nred herrings\' tails at once than bother Julius about his brother\'s\r\nwife.  How would you and Terry like it, if your wives took to\r\nsquabbling, and setting you together by the ears?  I was demented\r\nenough to try it once, but I soon saw it was worse than anything."\r\n\r\n"What?  He took her part?"\r\n\r\n"No such thing!  Hold your tongue, Tommy, and don\'t talk of married\r\nfolk till you\'re one yourself!"\r\n\r\n"Papa never meant it," repeated the indignant Tom.  "I\'ve a great\r\nmind to write and tell him how you are served!"\r\n\r\n"Now, Tom," cried Rosamond, stopping short, "if you do that, I\r\nsolemnly declare I\'ll never have you here again!  What could papa\r\ndo?  Do you think he could cure Raymond\'s wife of being a ridiculous\r\nlittle prig?  And if he could--why, before your letter got to\r\nMeerut, she will be gone up to London; and by the time she comes\r\nback we\'ll be safe in our own Rectory.  Here, come in, and get our\r\nstring and basket at Mrs. Bungay\'s."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll pay her out!" muttered Tom, as he followed his sister into\r\nMrs. Bungay\'s shop, one of much smaller pretensions, for the sale of\r\nbaskets, brushes, mats, &c.\r\n\r\nThe mistress, a stout, red-faced woman, looked as if she had been\r\n\'speaking a bit of her mind,\' and was at first very gruff and\r\nungracious, until she found they were real customers; and moreover,\r\nTom\'s bland Irish courtesy perfectly disarmed her, when Rosamond,\r\nhaving fixed her mind on a box in the very topmost pigeon-hole, they\r\nnot only apologized for the trouble they were giving, but Tom\r\noffered to climb up and bring it down, when she was calling for the\r\nerrand-boy in vain.\r\n\r\n"It\'s no trouble, sir, thank you; I\'d think nothing of that for you,\r\nmy lady, nor for Mr. Charnock--which I\'m sure I\'ll never forget all\r\nhe did for us at the fire, leading my little Alferd out like a lamb!\r\nI beg your ladyship\'s pardon, ma\'am, if I seemed a bit hasty; but\r\nI\'ve been so put about--and I thought at first you\'d come in on the\r\nsame matter, which I\'m sure a lady like you wouldn\'t ever do--about\r\nthe drains, and such like, which isn\'t fit for no lady to speak of!\r\nAs if Water Lane weren\'t as sweet and clean as it has any call to\r\nbe, and as if we didn\'t know what was right by our tenants, which\r\nare a bad lot, and don\'t merit no money to be laid out on them!"\r\n\r\n"So you have houses in Water Lane, Mrs. Bungay?  I didn\'t even know\r\nit!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Lady Rosamond!  My husband and I thought there was no better\r\ninvestment than to buy a bit of land, when the waste was inclosed,\r\nand run \'em up cheap.  Houses always lets here, you see, and the\r\nfire did no damage to that side.  But of course you didn\'t know,\r\nLady Rosamond; a real lady like you wouldn\'t go prying into what\r\nshe\'s no call to, like that fine decked-out body Duncombe\'s wife,\r\nwhich had best mind her own children, which it is a shame to see\r\nstravaging about the place!  I know it\'s her doing, which I told\r\nyoung Mrs. Charnock Poynsett just now, which I\'m right sorry to see\r\nled along by the like of her, and so are more of us; and we all wish\r\nsome friend would give her a hint, which she is but young--and \'tis\r\ndoing harm to Mr. Charnock Poynsett, Lady Rosamond, which all of us\r\nhave a regard for, as is but right, having been a good customer, and\r\nfriend to the town, and all before him; but we can\'t have ladies\r\ncoming in with their fads and calling us names for not laying out on\r\nwhat\'s no good to nobody, just to satisfy them!  As if Wil\'sbro\'\r\nhadn\'t been always healthy!"\r\n\r\nTom was wicked enough to put in a good many notes of sympathy, at\r\nthe intervals of the conjunctive whiches, and to end by declaring,\r\n"Quite right, Mrs. Bungay!  You see how much better we\'ve brought up\r\nmy sister!  I say--what\'s the price of that little doll\'s broom?"\r\n\r\n"What do you want of it, Tom?"\r\n\r\n"Never you mind!"\r\n\r\n"No mischief, I hope?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\nThe Enchantments\r\n\r\n\r\n"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,\r\n   "To play them such a trick,\r\nAfter we\'ve brought them out so far,\r\n   And made them trot so quick."\r\nThe carpenter said nothing, but\r\n   "The butter\'s spread too thick."--LEWIS CARROLL\r\n\r\nA telegram arrived from Frank, in the midst of the preparations on\r\nWednesday, announcing that \'he was all right, and should be at\r\nHazlitt\'s Gate at 8.10 p.m.\'\r\n\r\nAt 6.30 children of all sizes, with manes of all colours, were\r\narriving, and were regaled in the dining-room by Anne, assisted by\r\nJenny and Charlie.  Anne had a pretty pink colour in her cheeks, her\r\nflaxen locks were bound with green ribbons, and green adorned her\r\nwhite dress, in which she had a gracious, lily-like look of\r\nunworldly purity.  She thoroughly loved children, was quite equal to\r\nthe occasion, and indeed enjoyed it as much as the recent Christmas-\r\ntree in the village school.\r\n\r\nSuch of Cecil\'s guests as were mothers for the most part came with\r\ntheir children; but Lady Tyrrell, her sister, and others, who were\r\nunattached, arrived later, and were shown to the library, where she\r\nentertained them on the specified refreshment, biscuits and coffee,\r\nand enthroned Mrs Tallboys in the large arm-chair, where she looked\r\nmost beautiful and gorgeous, in a robe of some astonishing sheeny\r\nsky-blue, edged with paly gold, while on her head was a coronal of\r\nsapphire and gold, with a marvellous little plume.  The cost must\r\nhave been enormous, and her delicate and spirituelle beauty was\r\nshown to the greatest advantage; but as the audience was far too\r\nscanty to be worth beginning upon, Cecil, with a sigh at the folly\r\nof maternal idolatry, went to hunt up her ladies from gazing at the\r\nbabyish amusements of their offspring; and Miss Moy, in spite of her\r\nremonstrance, jumped up to follow her; while Mrs. Duncombe, the only\r\n_good_ mother in this new sense, remained, keeping guard lest\r\ncuriosity, and the echo of piano music, which now began to be heard,\r\nshould attract away any more of the ladies.\r\n\r\nCecil was by no means prepared for the scene.  The drawing-room was\r\ncrowded--chiefly indeed with ladies and children, but there was a\r\nfair sprinkling of gentlemen--and all had their faces turned towards\r\nthe great glass doors opening into the conservatory, which was\r\nbrilliantly lighted and echoing with music and laughter.  Cecil\r\ntried to summon some of the ladies of her own inviting, announcing\r\nthat Mrs. Tallboys was arrived; but this appeared to have no effect.\r\n"Yes, thank you," was all she heard.  Penetrating a little farther,\r\n"Mrs. Tallboys is ready."  "Thank you, I\'ll come; but my little\r\npeople are so anxious to have me with them."--"Mrs. Tallboys is\r\nwaiting!" to the next; who really did not hear, but only responded,\r\n"Did you ever see anything more charming?"\r\n\r\nBy this time Cecil could see over the heads of the front rank of\r\nchildren.  She hardly knew the conservatory.  All the veteran\r\ncamellia and orange-trees, and a good many bay and laurel boughs\r\nbesides, were ranged along the central alley, gorgeous with fairy\r\nlamps and jewels, while strains of soft music proceeded from some\r\nunseen quarter.  "Very pretty!" said Cecil, hastily, trying another\r\nof her intended guests with her intelligence.  "Really--yes,\r\npresently, thank you," was the absent answer.  "There is some\r\ndelightful mystery in there."\r\n\r\nCecil found her attempts were vain, and was next asked, as one of\r\nthe household, what delicious secret was going on there; and as it\r\nhurt her feelings to be left out, she pressed into the conservatory,\r\nwith some vague intention of ordering Anne, if not Rosamond, to\r\nrelease her grown-up audience, and confine their entertainment to\r\nthe children; but she found herself at once caught by the hand by a\r\nturbaned figure like a prince in the Arabian Nights, who, with a low\r\nsalaam, waved her on.\r\n\r\n"No, thank you.  I\'m looking for--"\r\n\r\nBut retreat was impossible, for many were crowding up in eager\r\ncuriosity; moreover, a muslin bandage descended-on her eyes.\r\n"Don\'t!" she expostulated; "I\'m not at play--I\'m--" but her words\r\nwere lost.\r\n\r\n"Hush! the Peri\'s cave is near,\r\nNo one enters scatheless here;\r\nLightly tread and lowly bend,\r\nWin the Peri for your friend,"\r\n\r\nsung a voice to the mysterious piano accompaniment; and Cecil found\r\nboth hands taken, and was forced to move on, as she guessed the\r\nlength of the conservatory, amid sounds of suppressed laughter that\r\nexceedingly annoyed her, till there was a pause and repetition of\r\nthe two last lines with an attempt to make her obey them.  She was\r\ntoo impatient and angry to perceive that it would have been much\r\nbetter taste to enter into the humour of the thing; and she only\r\nsaid with all her peculiar cold petulance, just like sleet, "Let me\r\ngo, if you please; I am engaged.  I am waited for."\r\n\r\n"Peri gracious,\r\nShe\'s contumacious;\r\nBehold, every hair shall bristle\r\nWhen she hears the magic whistle!"\r\n\r\nand a whistle, sharp, long, and loud, sounded behind her, amid peals\r\nof merriment.  She turned sharply round, but still the whistle was\r\nbehind her, and rang out again and again, till she was half\r\ndeafened, and wholly irate; while the repetition of\r\n\r\n"Bend, bend, lowly bend,\r\nWin the Peri for your friend,"\r\n\r\nforced on her the conviction that on no other condition should she\r\nbe set free, though the recognition of Terry\'s voice made the\r\ncommand doubly unpalatable, and as she made the stiffest and most\r\nreluctant of courtesies, a voice said,\r\n\r\n"Homage done, you may be\r\nOf this merry company;"\r\n\r\nand with a last blast of the whistle the bandage was removed, and\r\nshe found herself in the midst of a half circle of laughing children\r\nand grown people; in front of her a large opening, like a cavern,\r\nhung with tiny lamps of various colours, in the midst of which stood\r\nthe Peri, in a Persian pink robe, white turban, and wide white\r\ntrousers, with two oriental genies attendant upon her.\r\n\r\nA string was thrust into Cecil\'s hand, apparently fastened to her,\r\nand accounting for some sharp pulls she had felt during the\r\nwhistling.  She drew it in front in sharp haste, to be rid of the\r\nobnoxious instrument; but instead of a whistle, she found in her\r\nhand a little dust-pan and brush, fit for a baby-house, drawn\r\nthrough a ring, while the children eagerly cried, "What have you\r\ngot?  What have you got?"\r\n\r\n"Some nonsense.  I do not approve of practical jokes," began Cecil;\r\nbut the song only replied,\r\n\r\n"Away, away,\r\nIn the cave no longer stay;\r\nOthers come to share our play;"\r\n\r\nand one of the genies drew her aside, while another blindfolded\r\nvictim was being introduced with the same rites, only fare more\r\nwillingly.  The only way open to here was that which led to the\r\nwindow of the dining-room, where she found Anne with the children\r\nwho had had their share, and were admiring their prizes.  Anne tried\r\nto soothe her by saying, "You see every one is served alike.  They\r\nthought it would be newer than a tree."\r\n\r\n"Did you mean to _give_ me _this_?" asked a little girl, in whose\r\nhands Cecil had thrust her dust-pan, without a glance at it.\r\n\r\n"Oh the ring!" said Anne.  "You must keep that, Mrs. Poynsett\r\nthought you would like it.  It is a gem--some Greek goddess, I\r\nthink."\r\n\r\n"Is this her arrangement?" asked Cecil, pointing to the dust-pan.\r\n\r\n"Oh no! she knew nothing about that, nor I; but you see every one\r\nhas something droll.  See what Mr. Bowater has!"\r\n\r\nAnd Herbert Bowater showed that decidedly uncomplimentary penwiper,\r\nwhere the ass\'s head declares "There are two of us;" while every\r\nchild had some absurdity to show; and Miss Moy\'s shrieks of delight\r\nwere already audible at a tortoise-shell pen-holder disguised as a\r\nhunting-whip.\r\n\r\n"I must go to my friends," said Cecil, vouchsafing no admiration of\r\nthe ring, though she had seen enough to perceive that it was a\r\nbeautifully engraved ruby; and she hurried back to the library, but\r\nonly to find all her birds flown, and the room empty!  Pursuing them\r\nto the drawing-room, she saw only the backs of a few, in the\r\nrearmost rank of the eager candidates for admission to the magic\r\ncave.\r\n\r\nLady Tyrrell alone saw her, and turned back from the eager\r\nmultitude, to say in her low, modulated voice, "Beaten, my dear.\r\nAble strategy on la belle mere\'s part."\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Mrs. Tallboys?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you see her blue feather, eagerly expectant?  Just after you\r\nwere gone, Edith Bowater came in, and begged us to come and see the\r\nconservatory lighted up; and then came a rush of the Brenden\r\nchildren after their aunt, exclaiming wildly it was delicious--\r\nlights, and a fairy, and a secret, and every one got something, if\r\nthey were ever so old.  Of course, after that there was nothing but\r\nto follow the stream."\r\n\r\n"It is a regular plot for outwitting us!  Rosamond is dressed up for\r\nthe fairy.  They are all in league."\r\n\r\n"Well, we must put a good face on it for the present," said Lady\r\nTyrrell.  "Don\'t on any account look as if you were not in perfect\r\naccordance.  You can show your sentiments afterwards, you know."\r\n\r\nCecil saw she must acquiesce, for Mrs. Tallboys was full in the\r\nmidst.  With an infinitely better grace than her hostess, she\r\nyielded herself to the sports, bowed charmingly to the Peri, whirled\r\nlike a fairy at the whistling, and was rewarded with a little enamel\r\npadlock as a brooch, and two keys as ear-rings; indeed she\r\nprofessed, with evident sincerity, that she was delighted with these\r\nsports of the old country, and thought the two genies exquisite\r\nspecimens of the fair, useless, gentle English male aristocracy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Duncombe, too, accepted the inevitable with considerable spirit\r\nand good-humour, though she had a little passage-at-arms with\r\nJulius; when showing him the ivory card-case that had fallen to her\r\nlot, she said, "So this is the bribe!  Society stops the mouth of\r\ntruth."\r\n\r\n"That is as you choose to take it," he said.\r\n\r\n"Exactly.  When we want to go deep into eternal verities you silence\r\nus with frivolous din and dainty playthings for fear of losing your\r\nslaves."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t grant that."\r\n\r\n"Then why hinder an earnest discussion by all this hubbub?"\r\n\r\n"Because this was not the right place or time."\r\n\r\n"It never is the right time for the tyrants to let their slaves\r\nconfer, or to hear home-truths."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, my curiosity is excited.  I want to hear Mrs.\r\nTallboys\' views."\r\n\r\n"Then when will you dine with us?  Next Wednesday?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you.  Wednesday has an evening service."\r\n\r\n"Ah!  I told you it was never the right time!  Then Thursday?  And\r\nyou\'ll trust your wife with us?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, certainly."\r\n\r\n"It is a bargain, then?  Seven o\'clock, or there will be no time."\r\n\r\nJulius\'s attention suddenly wandered.  Was not a whisper pervading\r\nthe room of a railway accident?  Was not Frank due by that night\'s\r\ntrain?\r\n\r\nThere were still so many eager to visit the magic cave, that Julius\r\ntrusted his wife would remain there sheltered from the report; Jenny\r\nBowater was behind a stand of trees, acting orchestra; but when\r\nTerry came to the outskirts of the forest in search of other knights\r\nof the whistle, Julius laid a hand on him, and gave instructions in\r\ncase any rumour should reach Rosamond to let her know how vague it\r\nwas, tell her that he was going to ascertain the truth, and beg her\r\nto keep up the game and cause no alarm.\r\n\r\nNext encountering Anne, he begged her to go to his mother and guard\r\nher from any alarm, until there was some certainty.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t we send all these people away?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Not yet.  We had better make no unnecessary disturbance.  There\r\nwill be time enough if anything be amiss.  I am going down to\r\nHazlitt\'s Gate."\r\n\r\nAnne was too late.  Charlie had not outgrown the instinct of rushing\r\nto his mother with his troubles; and he was despairingly telling the\r\nreport he had heard of a direful catastrophe, fatal to an unknown\r\nquantity of passengers, while she, strong and composed because he\r\ngave way, was trying to sift his intelligence.  No sooner did he\r\nhear from Anne that Julius was going to the station, than he started\r\nup to accompany him--the best thing he could do in his present\r\nstate.  Hardly, however, had he closed the door, before he returned\r\nwith fresh tears in his eyes, leading in Eleonora Vivian, whom he\r\nhad found leaning against the wall outside, white and still, scarce\r\ndrawing her breath.\r\n\r\n"Come," he said; and before she knew what he was doing, she was at\r\nMrs. Poynsett\'s side.  "Here, mother," he said, "take her."  And he\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett stretched out her arms.  The hearts of the two women\r\nwho loved Frank could not help meeting.  Eleonora sank on her knees,\r\nhiding her face on the mother\'s breast, with two tender arms clasped\r\nround her.\r\n\r\nAnne was kneeling too, but she was no longer the meek, shy stranger.\r\nNow, in the hour of trouble, she poured forth, in a voice fervent\r\nand sweet, a prayer for protection and support for their beloved\r\none, so that it might be well with him, whatever might be his\r\nHeavenly Father\'s Will.\r\n\r\nAs she paused, Mrs. Poynsett, in a choked voice, said, "Thank you,\r\ndear child;" when there were steps in the hall.  Anne started up,\r\nLenore buried her face on Mrs. Poynsett\'s bosom, the mother clasped\r\nher hands over her convulsively, then beheld, as the door opened, a\r\ntall figure, with a dark bright face full of ineffable softness and\r\njoy.  Frank himself, safe and sound, with his two brothers behind\r\nhim.  They stayed not to speak, but hastened to spread the glad\r\ntidings; while he flung himself down, including both his mother and\r\nLenore in one rapturous embrace, and carrying his kiss from one to\r\nthe other--conscious, if no one else was, that this first seal of\r\nhis love was given in his mother\'s arms.\r\n\r\nLenore did indeed extricate herself, and stand up as rosy red as she\r\nhad been pale; but she had no room for any thought beyond his\r\nmother\'s trembling "Not hurt, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Not hurt!  Not a scratch!  Thank God!  Oh! thank God!" answered\r\nFrank, quivering all over with thankfulness, though probably far\r\nmore at the present joy than the past peril.\r\n\r\n"Yes--oh, thanks for His mercy!" echoed Anne, giving fervent hand\r\nand tearful cheek to the eager salutation, which probably would have\r\nbeen as energetic to Clio or old Betty at that moment!\r\n\r\n"But there\'s blood on your wristband," cried the mother.  "You are\r\nhurt!"\r\n\r\n"No; it\'s not mine.  I didn\'t know it.  It is from the poor fellow I\r\nhelped to carry into the public-house at Knoll, just this side\r\nBacksworth, a good deal hurt, I\'m afraid.  Something had got on the\r\nlines, I believe.  I was half asleep, and knew nothing till I found\r\nourselves all crushed up together in the dark, upside-down, my feet\r\nabove my head.  There was but one man in my carriage, and we didn\'t\r\nget foul of one another, and found we were all right, when we\r\nscrambled out of the window.  So we helped out the others, and found\r\nthat, besides the engineer and stoker--who I don\'t suppose can live,\r\npoor fellows!--there was only this man much damaged.  Then, when\r\nthere seemed no more to be done, I took my bag and walked across\r\ncountry, to reach home before you heard.  But oh, this is worth\r\nanything!"\r\n\r\nHe had to bend down for another embrace from his mother whose heart\r\nwas very full as she held his bright young healthful face between\r\nher hands, though all she said was, "You have walked eleven miles\r\nand more!  You must be half starved!--Anne, my dear, pray let him\r\nhave something.  He can eat it here."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see," said Anne, hastening away.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t go, Lenore," cried Frank, springing up.  "Stay, I\'ve not\r\nseen you!--Mother, how sweet of you!  But I forgot!  You don\'t know!\r\nI was only waiting till I was through."\r\n\r\n"I understand, my dear boy."\r\n\r\n"But how?  How did you find out?  Was it only that you knew she was\r\nthe precious darling of my heart? and now you see and own why,"\r\ncries Frank, almost beside himself with excitement and delight.\r\n\r\n"It was Lady Tyrrell who told me," said Mrs. Poynsett, sympathizing\r\ntoo much with the lovers to perceive that her standpoint of\r\nresistance was gone from her.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lenore.  "She knew of our walk, and questioned me so\r\nclosely that I could not conceal anything without falsehood."\r\n\r\n"After she met me at Aucuba Villa?" asked Frank.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Did you tell her anything?"\r\n\r\n"I thought she knew more than I found afterwards that she did," said\r\nFrank; "but there\'s no harm done.  It is all coming now."\r\n\r\n"She told my father," said Eleonora, sadly, "and he cannot\r\nunderstand our delay.  He is grieved and displeased, and thinks I\r\nhave not been open with him."\r\n\r\n"Oh! that will be all right to-morrow," said Frank.  "I\'ll have it\r\nout with a free heart, now there\'s no fear but that I have passed;\r\nand I\'ve got the dearest of mothers!  I feel as if I could meet him\r\nif he were a dozen examiners rolled into one, instead of the good\r\nold benevolent parent that he is!  Ha!  Anne--Susan--Jenkins--thank\r\nyou--that\'s splendid!  May I have it here?  Super-excellent!  Only\r\nhere\'s half the clay-pit sticking to me!  Let me just run up and\r\nmake myself decent.  Only don\'t let her run away."\r\n\r\nPerhaps Clio would have scorned the instinct that made a Charnock\r\nunable to enjoy a much-needed meal in the presence of mother and of\r\nlove till the traces of the accident and the long walk had been\r\nremoved.  His old nurse hurried after--ostensibly to see that his\r\nlinen was at hand, but really to have her share of the petting and\r\ncongratulation; and Lenore stood a little embarrassed, till Mrs.\r\nPoynsett held out her arms, with the words, "My dear child!" and\r\nagain she dropped on her knee by the couch, and nestled close in\r\nthankful joy.\r\n\r\nPresently however, she raised herself, and said sadly, almost\r\ncoldly, "I am afraid you have been surprised into this."\r\n\r\n"I must love one who so loves my boy," was the ardent answer.\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t help it!" said the maiden, again abandoning herself to\r\nthe tenderness.  "Oh! it is so good of you!"\r\n\r\n"My dear, dear daughter!"\r\n\r\n"Only please give me one mother\'s kiss!  I have so longed for one."\r\n\r\n"Poor motherless child!  My sweet daughter!"\r\n\r\nThen after a pause Eleonora said, "Indeed, I\'ll try to deserve\r\nbetter; but oh! pray forgive me, if I cost him much more pain and\r\npatience than I am worth."\r\n\r\n"He thinks you well worth anything, and perhaps I do," said Mrs\r\nPoynsett, who was conquered, won over, delighted more than by either\r\nof the former brides, in spite of all antecedents.\r\n\r\n"Then will you always trust me?" said Eleonora, with clasped hands,\r\nand a wondrous look of earnest sincerity on her grave open brow and\r\nbeautiful pensive dark blue eyes.\r\n\r\n"I _must_, my dear."\r\n\r\n"And indeed I don\'t think I could help holding to _him_, because he\r\nseems my one stay and hope here; and now I know it is all right with\r\nyou, indeed it is such happiness as I never knew."\r\n\r\nShe laid her head down again in subdued joy and rest:  but the pause\r\nwas broken by Frank\'s return; and a moment after, in darted the Peri\r\nin her pink cashmere costume, with a glow transforming her usually\r\ncolourless face.  "Dear, dear Frank, I\'m so glad!" she cried,\r\nbestowing her kiss; while he cried in amazement, "Is it Rose?  Is\r\nthere a fancy ball?"\r\n\r\n"Only Aladdin\'s Cave.  I\'m just out of it; and while Jenny is\r\nkeeping up games, and Edith is getting up a charade, I could dash in\r\nto see that Frank was all there, and more too.  The exam, is safe,\r\neh?"\r\n\r\n"I trust so," said Frank; "the list will not come just yet; but I am\r\ntold I am certain of a pass--indeed, that I stand high as to\r\nnumbers."\r\n\r\n"That\'s noble!--Now, Mrs. Poynsett, turn him out as soon as he has\r\neaten his dinner.  We want any one who can keep up a respectable\r\nkind of a row.  I say, will you two do Ferdinand and Miranda playing\r\nat chess?  You look just like it."\r\n\r\n"Must we go?" asked Frank, reluctantly; and there was something in\r\nthe expression of his face, a little paler than usual, that reminded\r\nhis mother that the young man had for the first time seen sudden and\r\nviolent death that day, and that though his present gladness was so\r\ngreat, yet that he had gone through too much in body and mind for\r\nthe revels of the evening not either to jar, or to produce a\r\nvehement reaction, if he were driven into them.  So she answered by\r\npleading the eleven miles\' walk; and the queen of the sports was\r\nmerciful, adding, "But I must be gone, or Terry will be getting up\r\nhis favourite tableau of the wounded men of Clontarf, or Rothesay,\r\nor the Black Bull\'s Head, or some equally pleasing little incident."\r\n\r\n"Is it going on well?" asked Mrs. Poynsett.\r\n\r\n"Sweetly!  Couldn\'t be better.  They have all amalgamated and are in\r\nthe midst of the \'old family coach,\' with Captain Duncombe telling\r\nthe story.  He is quite up to the trick, and enjoys turning the\r\ntables on his ladies."\r\n\r\n"And Camilla?" asked Lenore, in a hesitating, anxious tone\r\n\r\n"Oh! she\'s gone in for it.  I think she is the springs!  I heard her\r\nask where you were, and Charley told her; so you need not be afraid\r\nto stay in peace, if you have a turn that way.  Good-bye; you\'d\r\nlaugh to see how delighted people are to be let off the lecture."\r\nAnd she bent over Lenore with a parting kiss, full of significance\r\nof congratulation.\r\n\r\nShe returned, after changing her dress, to find a pretty fairy\r\ntableau, contrived by the Bowater sisters, in full progress, and\r\ndelighting the children and the mothers.  Lady Vivian contrived to\r\nget a word with her as she returned.\r\n\r\n"Beautifully managed, Lady Rosamond.  I tell Cecil she should enjoy\r\na defeat by such strategy."\r\n\r\n"It is Mrs. Poynsett\'s regular Christmas party," said Rosamond, not\r\ndeigning any other reply.\r\n\r\n"I congratulate her on her skilful representatives," said Lady\r\nTyrrell.  "May I ask if we are to see the hero of the day?  No?\r\nWhat! you would say better employed?  Poor children, we must let\r\nthem alone to-night for their illusion, though I am sorry it should\r\nbe deepened; it will be only the more pain by and by."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that," said Rosamond, stoutly.\r\n\r\n"Ah!  Lady Rosamond, you are a happy young bride, untaught what is\r\nl\'impossible."  Rosamond could not help thinking that no one\r\nunderstood it better than she, as the eldest of a large family with\r\nmore rank and far more desires than means; but she disliked Lady\r\nTyrrell far too much for even her open nature to indulge in\r\nconfidences, and she made a successful effort to escape from her\r\nneighbourhood by putting two pale female Fullers into the place of\r\nhonour in front of the folding doors into the small drawing-room,\r\nwhich served as a stage, and herself hovered about the rear, wishing\r\nshe could find some means of silencing Miss Moy\'s voice, which was\r\ngrowing louder and more boisterous than ever.\r\n\r\nThe charade which Rosamond had expected was the inoffensive, if\r\ncommonplace, Inspector, and the window she beheld, when the curtain\r\ndrew up, was, she supposed, the bar of an inn.  But no; on the board\r\nwere two heads, ideals of male and female beauty, one with a waxed\r\nmoustache, the other with a huge chignon, vividly recalling Mr.\r\nPettitt\'s Penates.  Presently came by a dapper professor, in blue\r\nspectacles and a college cap, who stood contemplating, and indulging\r\nin a harangue on entities and molecules, spirit and matter,\r\naffinities and development, while the soft deep brown eyes of the\r\nchignoned head languished, and the blue ones of the moustached one\r\nrolled, and the muscles twitched and the heads turned till, by a\r\nstrong process of will explained by the professor, they bent their\r\nnecks, erected themselves, and finally started into life and the\r\ncurtain fell on them with clasped hands!\r\n\r\nIt rose to show the newly-animated pair, Junius Brutus and Barberina\r\nhis wife, at the breakfast table, with a boar\'s head of brawn before\r\nthem, while the Lady Barberina boldly asserted her claims to the\r\nheadship of the house.  Had she not lately been all head?\r\n\r\nThe pathetic reply was, "Would it were so still, my dear.  All head\r\nand no tongue, like our present meal."\r\n\r\nThe lady heaved up the boar\'s head to throw at him, and the scene\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nNext, Brutus was seen awkwardly cleaning his accoutrements, having\r\nenlisted, as he soliloquized, to escape from woman.\r\n\r\nEnter a sergeant with a rich Irish brogue, and other recruits,\r\nforming the awkward squad.  The drill was performed with immense\r\nspirit, but only one of the soldiers showed any dexterity; but while\r\nthe sergeant was upholding him as \'the very moral of a patthern to\r\nthe rest,\' poor Brutus was seized with agonizing horror at the\r\nrecognition of Barberina in this disguise!\r\n\r\n"Why not?" she argued.  "Why should not woman learn to use the arms\r\nof which man has hitherto usurped the use?"\r\n\r\nPoor Brutus stretched out his arms in despair, and called loudly for\r\nthe professor to restore him to his original state of silent\r\nfelicity in the barber\'s window.\r\n\r\n"Ye needn\'t do that, me boy," quoth the sergeant with infinite\r\nscorn.  "Be ye where ye will, ye\'ll never be aught but a blockhead."\r\n\r\nTherewith carriages were being announced to the heads of families;\r\nand with compliments and eager thanks, and assurances that nothing\r\ncould have been more delightful, the party broke up.\r\n\r\nCaptain Duncombe, while muffling his boys, declared that he never\r\nsaw a cleverer hit in his life, and that those two De Lancey\r\nbrothers ought to be on the stage; while Miss Moy loudly demanded\r\nwhether he did not feel it personal; and Mrs. Tallboys, gracefully\r\nshaking hands with Anne and Rosamond, declared it a grand challenge\r\nwhere the truth had been unconsciously hit off.  Cecil was nowhere\r\nto be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\nDemonstrations\r\n\r\n\r\nNursing her wrath to keep it warm.--BURNS\r\n\r\nThe hours of the soiree had been early; but the breakfast was so\r\nirregular and undecided as to time, that no one took much notice of\r\nan intimation which Jenkins had received from the grim Mrs.\r\nGrindstone that Mrs, Charnock Poynsett would take breakfast in her\r\nown room.  Indeed, they all felt glad that her views of etiquette\r\ndid not bind them to their places; for Frank was burning to be off\r\nto Sirenwood, forgetting that it was far easier to be too early than\r\ntoo late for Sir Harry Vivian, who was wont to smoke till long after\r\nmidnight, and was never visible till the midday repast.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it was Lady Tyrrell who came to Frank alone.  "Early\r\nafoot," she said; "you foolish, impatient fellow!  You _will_ outrun\r\nmy best advice."\r\n\r\n"Ah! but I\'m armed.  I always told you we might trust to my mother,\r\nand it is all right.  She loves Lenore with all her heart, and\r\nconsents freely and gladly."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!  Well, the dear child has made her conquest!"\r\n\r\n"I always knew she would when once reserve was broken down."\r\n\r\n"Did you get up the alarm on purpose?"\r\n\r\n"Really, one would think I had done so.  One such moment was worth\r\nyears of ordinary meetings!  Half the battle is won!"\r\n\r\n"Have you seen your mother this morning?"\r\n\r\n"No; but she knew I was coming."\r\n\r\n"Then you do not know what her feelings are on cooler reflection?"\r\n\r\n"My mother would never retract what she has once assured me of,"\r\nsaid Frank, haughtily.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me--of what has she assured you?"\r\n\r\n"That she regards Eleonora as a dear daughter, and that implies\r\ndoing the same for me as for my brothers.  If Sir Harry would but be\r\nso good as to come and see her--\'\r\n\r\n"Stay, Frank, you have not come that length.  You forget that if you\r\nhave, as you say, gained half the battle, there is another half; and\r\nthat my father very reasonably feels hurt at being the last to be\r\nfavoured with the intelligence."\r\n\r\n"Dear Lady Tyrrell, you can see how it was.  There was no helping it\r\nwhen once I could speak to Lenore; and then no one would have let me\r\nutter a word till I had gone through the examination.  We never\r\nmeant to go on a system of concealment; but you know how every one\r\nwould have raved and stormed if I had betrayed a thought beyond old\r\nDriver, and yet it was only being at rest about Lenore that carried\r\nme through without breaking down.  Can\'t you see?"\r\n\r\n"You special pleader!  May you win over my father; but you must\r\nremember that we are a fallen house, unable to do all we wish."\r\n\r\n"If I might see Sir Harry!  I must make him forgive me."\r\n\r\n"I will see whether he is ready."\r\n\r\nCould Frank\'s eyes have penetrated the walls, he would have seen\r\nLady Tyrrell received with the words, "Well, my dear, I hope you\r\nhave got rid of the young man--poor fellow!"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid that cannot be done without your seeing him yourself."\r\n\r\n"Hang it!  I hate it!  I can\'t abide it, Camilla.  He\'s a nice lad,\r\nthough he is his mother\'s son; and Lenore\'s heart is set on him, and\r\nI can\'t bear vexing the child."\r\n\r\n"Lena cares for him only because she met him before she knew what\r\nlife is like.  After one season she will understand what five\r\nhundred a year means."\r\n\r\n"Well, you ought to know your sister best; but if the lad has spoken\r\nto her, Lena is not the girl to stand his getting his conge so\r\ndecidedly."\r\n\r\n"Exactly; it would only lead to heroics, and deepen the mischief."\r\n\r\n"Hang it!  Then what do you want me to say?"\r\n\r\n"Stand up for your rights, and reduce him to submission by\r\ndispleasure at not having been consulted.  Then explain how there\r\ncan be no engagement at once; put him on his honour to leave her\r\nfree till after her birthday in November."\r\n\r\n"What! have him dangling after her?  That\'s no way to make her\r\nforget him."\r\n\r\n"She never will under direct opposition--she is too high-spirited\r\nfor that; but if we leave it alone, and they are unpledged, there is\r\na fair chance of her seeing the folly both for her and for him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that.  Lena may be high-flown; but things go deep with\r\nthe child--deeper than they did with you, Camilla!"\r\n\r\nPerhaps this was a stab, for there was bitterness in the answer.\r\n"You mean that she is less willing to give up a fancy for the family\r\ngood.  Remember, it is doubly imperative that Lena should marry a\r\nman whose means are in his own power, so that he could advance\r\nsomething.  This would be simply ruin--throwing up the whole thing,\r\nafter all I have done to retrieve our position."\r\n\r\n"After all, Camilla, I am growing an old man, and poor Tom is gone.\r\nI don\'t know that the position is worth so much to me as the\r\nhappiness to her, poor child!" said Sir Harry, wistfully.\r\n\r\n"Happiness!" was the scornful answer.  "If you said \'her own way,\'\r\nit would be nearer the truth.  A back street in London--going about\r\nin a cab--and occasional holidays on sufferance from Mrs. Poynsett."\r\n\r\nHowever little happiness either father or daughter had derived from\r\ntheir chosen ways, this idea was abhorrent to both; and Lady Tyrrell\r\npressed her advantage.  "If we keep him waiting much longer he will\r\nbe rushing after Lena, and if you show the least sign of relenting\r\nhe will insist on dragging you to an interview with his mother."\r\n\r\nThe threat was effectual; for Sir Harry had had passages-at arms\r\nenough with Mrs. Poynsett to make him dread her curt dry civility\r\nfar more than either dun or bailiff, and he was at once roused to\r\nthe determination to be explicit.\r\n\r\nFrank met him, with crimson face and prepared speech.  "Good\r\nmorning, Sir Harry!  I am afraid you may think that you have reason\r\nto complain of my not having spoken to you sooner; but I trusted to\r\nyour previous knowledge of my feelings, and I was anxious to\r\nascertain my position before laying it before you, though I don\'t\r\nbelieve I should have succeeded unless my mind had been set at\r\nrest."\r\n\r\nSoft-hearted Sir Harry muttered, "I understand, but--"\r\n\r\nThe pause at that \'but\' was so long that Frank ventured on going on.\r\n"I have not had an official communication, but I know privately that\r\nI have passed well and stand favourably for promotion, so that my\r\nincome will go on increasing, and my mother will make over to me\r\nfive thousand pounds, as she has done to Miles and Julius, so that\r\nit can be settled on Eleonora at once."\r\n\r\n"There, there, that\'s enough!" said Sir Harry, coerced by his\r\ndaughter\'s glances; "there\'s plenty of time before coming to all\r\nthat!  You see, my dear boy, I always liked you, and had an immense\r\nrespect for your--your family; but, you see, Eleonora is young, and\r\nunder the circumstances she ought not to engage herself.  She can\'t\r\nany way marry before coming of age, and--considering all things--I\r\nshould much prefer that this should go no further."\r\n\r\n"You ought both to be free!" said Lady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n"That I can never be!"\r\n\r\n"Nor do you think that she can--only it sounds presumptuous," smiled\r\nLady Tyrrell.  "Who can say?  But things have to be proved; and\r\nconsidering what young untried hearts are, it is safer and happier\r\nfor both that there should be perfect freedom, so that no harm\r\nshould be done, if you found that you had not known your own minds."\r\n\r\n"It will make no difference to me."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, we know that!" laughed Sir Harry.  "Only suppose you\r\nchanged your mind, we could not be angry with you."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think I could!"\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Lady Tyrrell; "we think no such thing.  Don\'t you\r\nsee, if we did not trust your honour, we could not leave this in\r\nsuspense.  All we desire is that these matters may be left till it\r\nis possible to see our way, when the affairs of the estate are wound\r\nup; for we can\'t tell what the poor child will have.  Come, don\'t\r\nrepeat that it will make no difference.  It may not to you; but it\r\nmust to us, and to your mother."\r\n\r\n"My mother expects nothing!" said Frank, eagerly; but it was a false\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nSir Harry bristled up, saying, "Sir, my daughter shall go into no\r\nfamily that--that has not a proper appreciation of--and expectations\r\nbefitting her position."\r\n\r\n"Dear papa," exclaimed Lady Tyrrell, "he means no such thing.  He is\r\nonly crediting his mother with his own romantic ardour and\r\ndisinterestedness.--Hark! there actually is the gong.  Come and have\r\nsome luncheon, and contain yourself, you foolish boy!"\r\n\r\n"I am sorry I said anything that seemed unfitting," said Frank,\r\nmeekly.  "You know I _could_ not mean it!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, yes, I bear no malice; only one does not like to see\r\none\'s own child courted without a voice in the matter, and to hear\r\nshe is to be taken as a _favour_, expecting nothing.  But, there,\r\nwe\'ll say no more.  I like you, Frank Charnock! and only wish you\r\nhad ten thousand a year, or were any one else; but you see--you see.\r\nWell, let\'s eat our luncheon."\r\n\r\n"Does she know this decision?" asked Frank, aside, as he held open\r\nthe door for Lady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n"Yes, she knows it can go no further; though we are too merciful to\r\ndeny you the beatific vision, provided you are good, and abstain\r\nfrom any more little tendresses for the present.--Ah!"--enter Cecil--\r\n"I thought we should see you to-day, my dear!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I am on my way to meet my husband at the station," said Cecil,\r\nmeeting her in the hall, and returning her kiss.\r\n\r\n"Is Raymond coming home to-day?" said Frank, as he too exchanged\r\ngreetings.  "Ah!  I remember; I did not see you at breakfast this\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"No!" and there was signification in the voice; but Frank did not\r\nheed it, for coming down-stairs was Eleonora, her face full of a\r\nblushing sweetness, which gave it all the beauty it had ever lacked.\r\n\r\nHe could do no more than look and speak before all the rest; the\r\ncarriage was ordered for the sisters to go out together, and he\r\nlingered in vain for a few words in private, for Sir Harry kept him\r\ntalking about Captain Duncombe\'s wonderful colt, till Cecil had\r\ndriven off one way, and their two hostesses the other; and he could\r\nonly ride home to tell his mother how he had sped.\r\n\r\nBetter than Rosamond, better even than Charlie, was his mother as a\r\nconfidante; and though she had been surprised into her affectionate\r\nacceptance of Eleonora, it was an indescribable delight to mother\r\nand son to find themselves once more in full sympathy; while he\r\npoured out all that had been pent up ever since his winter at\r\nRockpier.  She almost made common cause with him in the question,\r\nwhat would Raymond say?  And it proved to be news to her that her\r\neldest son was to be immediately expected at home.  Cecil had not\r\ncome to see her, and had sent her no message; but ungracious\r\ninattention was not so uncommon as to excite much remark from one\r\nwho never wished to take heed to it; and it was soon forgotten in\r\nthe praise of Eleonora.\r\n\r\nCecil meanwhile was receiving Raymond at the station.  He was\r\npleased to see her there in her pony-carriage, but a little startled\r\nby the brief coldness of her reply to his inquiry after his mother,\r\nand the tight compression of her lips all the time they were making\r\ntheir way through the town, where, as usual, he was hailed every two\r\nor three minutes by persons wanting a word with him.  When at last\r\nthere was a free space, she began:  "Raymond, I wish to know whether\r\nyou mean me to be set at naught, and my friends deliberately\r\ninsulted?"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\nA gentleman here hurried up with "I\'ll not detain you a minute."\r\n\r\nHe did, however, keep them for what seemed a great many, to the\r\nchafing spirit which thought a husband should have no ears save for\r\nhis wife\'s wrongs; so she made her preface even more startling--\r\n"Raymond, I cannot remain in the house any longer with Lady Rosamond\r\nCharnock and those intolerable brothers of hers!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you will explain yourself," said Raymond, almost relieved\r\nby the evident exaggeration of the expressions.\r\n\r\n"There has been a conspiracy to thwart and insult me--a regular\r\nconspiracy!"\r\n\r\n"Cecil! let me understand you.  What can have happened?"\r\n\r\n"When I arranged an evening for my friends to meet Mrs. Tallboys, I\r\ndid not expect to have it swamped by a pack of children, and noisy\r\nnonsensical games, nor that both she and I should be insulted by\r\npractical jokes and a personal charade."\r\n\r\n"A party to meet Mrs. Tallboys?"\r\n\r\n"A ladies\' party, a conversazione."\r\n\r\n"What--by my mother\'s wish?"\r\n\r\n"I was given to understand that I had carte blanche in visiting\r\nmatters."\r\n\r\n"You did not ask her consent?"\r\n\r\n"I saw no occasion."\r\n\r\n"You did not?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Then, Cecil, I must say that whatever you may have to complain of,\r\nyou have committed a grave act of disrespect."\r\n\r\n"I was told that I was free to arrange these things!"\r\n\r\n"Free!" said Raymond, thoroughly roused; "free to write notes, and\r\norder the carriage, and play lady of the house; but did you think\r\nthat made you free to bring an American mountebank of a woman to\r\nhold forth absurd trash in my mother\'s own drawing-room, as soon as\r\nmy back was turned?"\r\n\r\n"I should have done the same had you been there."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" ironically; "I did not know how far you had graduated in\r\nthe Rights of Women.  So you invited these people?"\r\n\r\n"Then the whole host of children was poured in on us, and everything\r\nimaginable done to interrupt, and render everything rational\r\nimpossible.  I know it was Rosamond\'s contrivance, she looked so\r\ntriumphant, dressed in an absurd fancy dress, and her whole train\r\ndoing nothing but turning me into ridicule, and Mrs. Tallboys too.\r\nWhatever you choose to call her, you cannot approve of a stranger\r\nand foreigner being insulted here.  It is that about which I care--\r\nnot myself; I have seen none of them since, nor shall I do so until\r\na full apology has been made to my guest and to myself."\r\n\r\n"You have not told me the offence."\r\n\r\n"In the first place, there was an absurd form of Christmas-tree, to\r\nwhich one was dragged blindfold, and sedulously made ridiculous; and\r\nI--I had a dust-pan and brush.  Yes, I had, in mockery of our\r\nendeavours to purify that unhappy street."\r\n\r\n"I should have taken it as a little harmless fun," said Raymond.\r\n"Depend on it, it was so intended."\r\n\r\n"What, when Mrs. Tallboys had a padlock and key?  I see you are\r\ndetermined to laugh at it all.  Most likely they consulted you\r\nbeforehand."\r\n\r\n"Cecil, I cannot have you talk such nonsense.  Is this all you have\r\nto complain of?"\r\n\r\n"No.  There was a charade on the word Blockhead, where your brother\r\nCharles and the two De Lanceys caricatured what they supposed to be\r\nMrs. Tallboys\' doctrines."\r\n\r\n"How did she receive it?"\r\n\r\n"Most good-humouredly; but that made it no better on their part."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure it was not a mere ordinary piece of pleasantry, with\r\nperhaps a spice of personality, but nothing worth resenting?"\r\n\r\n"You did not see it.  Or perhaps you think no indignity towards me\r\nworth resentment?"\r\n\r\n"I do not answer that, Cecil; you will think better of those words\r\nanother time," said Raymond, sternly.  "But when you want your cause\r\ntaken up, you have to remember that whatever the annoyance, you\r\nbrought it upon yourself and her, by your own extraordinary\r\nproceeding towards my mother--I will not say towards myself.  I will\r\ntry to smooth matters.  I think the De Lanceys must have acted\r\nfoolishly; but the first step ought to be an expression of regret\r\nfor such conduct towards my mother."\r\n\r\n"I cannot express regret.  I ought to have been told if there were\r\nthings forbidden."\r\n\r\n"Must I forbid your playing Punch and Judy, or dancing on the tight-\r\nrope?" cried Raymond, exasperated.\r\n\r\nCecil bit her lip, and treated the exclamation with the silent\r\ndignity of a deeply injured female; and thus they reached home, when\r\nRaymond said, "Come to your senses, Cecil and apologize to my\r\nmother.  You can explain that you did not know the extent of your\r\npowers."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not.  They all plotted against me, and I am the person to\r\nwhom apology is due."\r\n\r\nWherewith she marched up-stairs, leaving Raymond, horribly\r\nperplexed, to repair at once to his mother\'s room, where Frank still\r\nwas; but after replying about his success in the examination, the\r\nyounger brother retreated, preferring that his story should be told\r\nby his mother; but she had not so much as entered on it when Raymond\r\ndemanded what had so much disturbed Cecil.\r\n\r\n"I was afraid she would be vexed," said Mrs. Poynsett; "but we were\r\nin a difficulty.  We thought she hardly knew what she had been led\r\ninto, and that as she had invited her ladies, it would do less harm\r\nto change the character of the party than to try to get it given\r\nup."\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt you did the best you could," said Raymond, speaking\r\nwith more like censure of his mother than he had ever done since the\r\nhot days of his love for Camilla Vivian; "and you could have had\r\nnothing to do with the personalities that seem to have been the\r\nsting."\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett, true boy-lover that she was, had been informed of the\r\nsuccess of Tom\'s naughtiness--not indeed till after it was over,\r\nwhen there was nothing to be done but to shake her head and laugh;\r\nand now she explained so that her son came to a better understanding\r\nof what had happened.\r\n\r\nAs to the extinguishing Women\'s Rights in child\'s play, he saw that\r\nit had been a wise manoeuvre of his mother, to spare any appearance\r\nof dissension, while preventing what she disapproved and what might\r\nhave injured his interests; but he was much annoyed with the De\r\nLanceys for having clogged the measure with their own folly; and\r\njudging of cause by effect, he would hear of no excuse for Rosamond\r\nor her brothers, and went away resolved that though nothing should\r\ninduce him to quarrel with Julius, yet he should tell him plainly\r\nthat he must restrain his wife and her brothers from annoying Cecil\r\nby their practical jokes.  He was, as usual, perfectly gentle to his\r\nmother, and thanked her for her arrangement.  "It was not her fault\r\nthat it had not turned out better," he said; and he did not seem to\r\nhear her exoneration of Rosamond.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely gone when Rosamond came in from the village, asking\r\nwhether he had arrived, as she had seen his hat in the hall.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Rosamond.  You did not tell me of Cecil\'s vexation!"\r\n\r\n"Cecil?  Have I seen her since?  No, I remember now.  But is she\r\nangry?  Was it the dust-pan?  Oh! Tom, Tom!"\r\n\r\n"That and the Blockhead.  Did Tom say anything very cutting?"\r\n\r\n"Why it was an old stock charade they acted two years ago!  I had\r\nbetter tell her so."\r\n\r\n"If you would it would be an immense relief, my dear.  Raymond is\r\nvery much annoyed; she says she will speak to nobody till she has\r\nhad an apology."\r\n\r\n"Then she can be as great a goose as I!  Why, the Yankee muse and\r\nMrs. Duncombe took all in good part; but Cecil has not atom of fun\r\nin her.  Don\'t you think that was the gift the fairies left out at\r\nthe christening of the all-endowed princess?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett laughed, but anxiously.  "My dear, if you can make\r\npeace, it will be a family blessing."\r\n\r\n"I!  I\'ll eat any dirt in the world, and make Tom eat it too, rather\r\nthan you should be vexed, or make discord in the house," cried\r\nRosamond, kissing her, and speeding away to Cecil\'s door.\r\n\r\nIt was Raymond who opened it, looking perturbed and heated, but a\r\ngood deal amazed at seeing his intended scapegoat coming thus boldly\r\nto present herself.\r\n\r\n"Let me in," she breathlessly said.  "I am come to tell Cecil how\r\nsorry I am she was so much vexed; I really did not know it before."\r\n\r\n"I am ready to accept any proper apology that is offered me," said\r\nCecil, with cold dignity; "but I cannot understand your profession\r\nthat you did not know I was vexed.  You could have intended nothing\r\nelse."\r\n\r\n"But, Cecil, you misunderstood--" began Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"I never misunderstand--"\r\n\r\n"No human creature can say that!" interposed Raymond, immensely\r\nthankful to Rosamond--whatever her offence--for her overtures, and\r\nanxious they should be accepted.\r\n\r\n"I could not," continued Cecil, "misunderstand the impertinent\r\ninsults offered to my friends and to myself; though if Lady Rosamond\r\nis willing to acknowledge the impropriety I will overlook it."\r\n\r\nRaymond\'s face and neck crimsoned, but Raymond\'s presence helped her\r\nto rein in her temper; and she thought of Julius, and refrained from\r\nmore than a "Very well.  It was meant as a harmless joke, and--and\r\nif you--you did not take it so, I am very sorry."\r\n\r\nRaymond saw the effort, and looked at his wife for softening; but as\r\nhe saw none, he met the advance by saying kindly, "I am sure it was\r\nso meant, though the moment was unfortunate."\r\n\r\n"Indeed it was so," cried Rosamond, feeling it much easier to speak\r\nto him, and too generous to profess her own innocence and give up\r\nTom.  "It was just a moment\'s idle fancy--just as we\'ve chaffed one\r\nanother a hundred times; and for the Blockhead, it is the boys\' pet\r\nold stock charade that they\'ve acted scores of times.  It was mere\r\nthoughtlessness; and I\'ll do or say anything Cecil pleases, if only\r\nshe won\'t bother Julius or Mrs. Poynsett about our foolishness."\r\nAnd the mist of tears shone in the dark lashes as she held out her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"I cannot suppose it mere thoughtlessness--" began Cecil; but\r\nRaymond cut her short with angry displeasure, of which she had not\r\nsupposed him capable.  "This is not the way to receive so kind an\r\napology.  Take Rosamond\'s hand, and respond properly."\r\n\r\nTo respond _properly_ was as little in Cecil\'s power as her will;\r\nbut she had not been an obedient daughter for so large a proportion\r\nof her life without having an instinct for the voice of real\r\nauthority, and she did not refuse her hand, with the words, "If you\r\nexpress regret I will say no more about it."\r\n\r\nAnd Rosamond, thinking of Julius and his mother, swallowed the\r\nungraciousness, and saying "Thank you," turned to go away.\r\n\r\n"Thank you most heartily for this, my dear Rosamond," said Raymond,\r\nholding out his hand as he opened the door for her; "I esteem it a\r\nvery great kindness."\r\n\r\nRosamond, as she felt the strong pressure of his hand, looked up in\r\nhis face with a curious arch compassion in her great gray eyes.  He\r\nshut the door behind her, and saw Cecil pouting by the mantelpiece,\r\nvexed at being forced into a reconciliation, even while she knew she\r\ncould not persist in sending all the family except Frank to\r\nCoventry.  He was thoroughly angry at the dogged way in which she\r\nhad received this free and generous peace-making, and he could not\r\nbut show it.  "Well," he said, "I never saw an apology made with a\r\nbetter grace nor received with a worse one."\r\n\r\nCecil made no reply.  He stood for a minute looking at her with eyes\r\nof wondering displeasure, then, with a little gesture of amazement,\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\nCecil felt like the drowning woman when she gave the last scissor-\r\nlike gesture with her fingers.  She was ready to fall into a chair\r\nand cry.  A sense of desolateness was very strong on her, and that\r\nlook in his dark eyes had seemed to blast her.\r\n\r\nBut pride came to her aid.  Grindstone was moving about ready to\r\ndress her for dinner.  No one should see that she was wounded, or\r\nthat she took home displeasure which she did not merit.  So she held\r\nup her head, and was chilling and dignified all dinner-time; after\r\nwhich she repaired to Lady Tyrrell\'s conversazione.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\nThe Monstrous Regiment of Women\r\n\r\n\r\nDescend, my muse!\r\n\r\nRaymond had been invited by one of his fellow-guests to make a visit\r\nat his house, and this was backed up on the morning after his return\r\nby a letter containing a full invitation to both himself and his\r\nwife.  He never liked what he called "doing nothing in other\r\npeople\'s houses," but he thought any sacrifice needful that might\r\nbreak up Cecil\'s present intimacies, and change the current of her\r\nideas; and his mother fully agreed in thinking that it would be well\r\nto being a round of visits, to last until the Session of Parliament\r\nshould have begin.  By the time it was over Julius and Rosamond\r\nwould be in their own house, and it might be easier to make a new\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nThe friends whom he could reckon on as sure to welcome him and his\r\nbride were political acquaintances of mark, far above the Dunstone\r\nrange, and Cecil could not but be gratified, even while Mrs.\r\nDuncombe and her friend declared that they were going to try to\r\ndemoralize her by the seductions of the aristocracy.\r\n\r\nAfter all, Cecil was too much of an ingrained Charnock to be very\r\ndeeply imbued with Women\'s Rights.  All that she wanted was her own\r\nway, and opposition.  Lady Tyrrell had fascinated her and secured\r\nher affection, and she followed her lead, which was rather that of\r\ncalm curiosity and desire to hear the subject ventilated than actual\r\npartisanship, for which her ladyship was far too clever, as well as\r\ntoo secure in her natural supremacy.  They had only seemed on that\r\nside because other people were so utterly alien to it, and because\r\nof their friendship with the really zealous Mrs. Duncombe.\r\n\r\nThe sanitary cause which had become mixed with it was, however,\r\nbrought strongly before their minds by Mrs. Tallboys\' final lecture,\r\nat which she impressed on the ladies\' minds with great vehemence\r\nthat here they might lead the way.  If men would not act as a body,\r\nthe ladies should set the example, and shame them, by each doing her\r\nvery utmost in the cleansing of the nests of disease that reeked in\r\nthe worn-out civilization of the cities of the old country.  The\r\nladies listened:  Lady Tyrrell, with a certain interest in such an\r\neager flow of eloquence; Eleonora, with thoughts far away.  Bessie\r\nDuncombe expressed a bold practical determination to get one\r\nfragment, at least, of the work done, since she knew Pettitt, the\r\nhair-dresser, was public-spirited enough to allow her to carry out\r\nher ideas on his property, and Cecil, with her ample allowance, as\r\nyet uncalled for, in the abundance of her trousseau, promised to\r\nsupply what the hair-dresser could not advance, as a tangible proof\r\nof her sincerity.\r\n\r\nShe held a little council with Mrs. Duncombe at the working society,\r\nwhen she resigned her day into that lady\'s hands on going away.  "I\r\nshall ask Mrs. Miles Charnock," said that lady.  "You don\'t object?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, only don\'t ask her till I\'m gone, and you know she will only\r\ncome on condition of being allowed to expound."\r\n\r\n"We must have somebody, and now the thing has gone on so long, and\r\nwill end in three months, the goody element will not do much harm,\r\nand, unluckily, most women will not act without it."\r\n\r\n"You have been trying to train Miss Moy."\r\n\r\n"I shall try still, but I can\'t get her to take interest in anything\r\nbut the boisterous side of emancipation."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t bear the girl," said Cecil; "I am sure she comes only for\r\nthe sake of the horses."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid so; but she amuses Bob, and there\'s always a hope of\r\nmoving her father through her, though she declares that the Three\r\nPigeons is his tenderest point, and that he had as soon meddle with\r\nit as with the apple of his eye.  I suppose he gets a great rent\r\nfrom that Gadley."\r\n\r\n"Do you really think you shall do anything with her?" said Cecil,\r\nwho might uphold her at home, but whose taste was outraged by her.\r\n\r\n"I hope so!  At any rate, she is not conventional.  Why, when I was\r\nset free from my school at Paris, and married Bob three months\r\nlater, I hadn\'t three ideas in my head beyond horses and balls and\r\nsoldiers.  It has all come with life and reading, my dear."\r\n\r\nAnd a very odd \'all\' it was, so far; but there was this difference\r\nbetween Bessie Duncombe and Cecil Charnock Poynsett, that the\r\n\'gospel of progress\' was to the one the first she had ever really\r\nknown, and became a reaching forward to a newly-perceived standard\r\nof benevolence and nobleness:  to the other it was simply\r\nretrograding, and that less from conviction than from the spirit of\r\nrivalry and opposition.\r\n\r\nLady Tyrrell with her father and sister were likewise going to leave\r\nhome, to stay among friends with whom Sir Harry could hunt until the\r\nLondon campaign, when Eleonora was to see the world.  Thus the\r\nbazaar was postponed until the return of the ladies in the summer,\r\nwhen the preparations would be more complete and the season more\r\nsuitable.  The church must wait for it, for nothing like a\r\nsufficient amount of subscription had been as yet promised.\r\n\r\nThere was still, however, to come that select dinner-party at Mrs.\r\nDuncombe\'s, to which Julius, moved by her zeal and honesty, as well\r\nas by curiosity, had promised his presence with Rosamond, "at his\r\nperil," as she said.\r\n\r\nThey were kept so long at the door of Aucuba Villa that they had\r\nbegun to doubt if they had not mistaken the day, until the Sirenwood\r\ncarriage crashed up behind them; and after the third pull at the\r\nbell they were admitted by an erect, alert figure,--a remnant of\r\nCaptain Duncombe\'s military life.\r\n\r\nHe marshalled them into the drawing-room, where by dim firelight\r\nthey could just discern the Professor and a certain good-natured\r\nhorsey friend of the Captain\'s, who sprang up from easy-chairs on\r\nthe opposite sides of the fire to greet them, while the man hastily\r\nstirred up the fire, lighted the gas, dashed at the table, shutting\r\nup an open blotting-book that lay on it, closing an ink-bottle, and\r\ngathering up some torn fragments or paper, which he would have\r\nthrown into the scrap-basket but that it was full of little books on\r\nthe hundred ways of dressing a pumpkin.  Then he gave a wistful look\r\nat the ami de la maison, as if commending the guests to him, and\r\nreceiving a nod in return, retired.\r\n\r\n"I fear we are too early," said Lady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n"Fact is," said the familiar, whose name Julius was trying to\r\nremember, "there\'s been a catastrophe; cook forgot to order the\r\nturkey, went to bed last night in hysterics, and blew out the gas\r\ninstead of turning it off.  No, no"--as the guests expecting fatal\r\nconsequences, looked as if they thought they had better remove\r\nthemselves:  "she came round, and Duncombe has driven over to\r\nBacksworth to bring home the dinner.  He\'ll soon be back."\r\n\r\nThis not appearing greatly to reassure the visitors, the Professor\r\nadded, "No, no, ladies.  Mrs. Duncombe charged me to say that she\r\nwill be perfectly fixed in a short time, and I flatter myself that\r\nmy wife is equal to any emergency."\r\n\r\n"It is very kind in her," said Lady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n"I confess," said Professor Tallboys, "that I am not sorry that such\r\nan occasion should occur of showing an American lady\'s domestic\r\npowers.  I flatter myself they do not discredit her cause."\r\n\r\nJust then were heard the wheels of the drag, and in rushed one of\r\nthe boys, grasping Eleonora\'s skirts, and proclaiming, "We\'ve got\r\nthe grub!  Oysters and a pie!  Oh my!"\r\n\r\n"Satisfactory!" said the friend.  "But let go, Ducky, you are\r\nrumpling Miss Vivian."\r\n\r\n"She\'s coming to see the quarion!  You promised, Lena!  Here\'s a\r\njolly crayfish!  He\'ll pinch!"\r\n\r\nThere was a small conservatory or glazed niche on one side of the\r\nroom, into which the boy dragged Lenore, and Julius followed, dimly\r\nsensible of what the quarion might be, and hoping for a word with\r\nthe young lady, while he trusted to his wife to occupy her sister.\r\n\r\nThe place contained two desolate camellias, with leaves in the same\r\nproportion as those on trees in the earlier ages of illumination,\r\nand one scraggy, leafless geranium, besides a green and stagnant\r\ntank, where a goldfish moved about, flapping and gasping, as the boy\r\ndisturbed it in his search for the crayfish.  He absorbed all the\r\nconversation, so that Julius could only look back into the room,\r\nwhere an attempt at artistic effect was still dimly visible through\r\naccumulated litter.  The Venus of Milo stood on a bracket, with a\r\nriding-whip in her arms, and a bundle of working society tickets\r\nbehind her, and her vis-a-vis, the Faun of Praxiteles, was capped by\r\na glove with one finger pointing upwards, and had a ball of worsted\r\ntangled about his legs; but further observation was hindered by the\r\nman-servant\'s voice at the outer door, "Master Ducky, where are you?\r\nYour ma says you are to go to bed directly."\r\n\r\n"No, no, I\'ll put myself to bed!"\r\n\r\n"Come, sir, please do, like a good boy--Master Pinney won\'t go\r\nwithout you, and I must put him to bed while they are dishing up.\r\nCome, sir, I\'ve got a mince-pie for you."\r\n\r\n"And some oysters--Bobby said I should have some oysters!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; come along, sir."\r\n\r\nAnd Master Ducky submitted to his fate, while Julius looked his\r\nwonder, and asked, "Is he nursery-maid?"\r\n\r\n"Just now, since the bonne went," said Lenore.  "He is a most\r\nfaithful, attached servant, who will do anything for them.  _She_\r\ndoes attach people deeply when the first shock is over."\r\n\r\n"I am coming to believe so," he answered.  "There seem to me to be\r\nexcellent elements."\r\n\r\n"I am so glad!" said Lenore; "she is so thorough, so true and frank;\r\nand much of this oddness is really an inconsistent struggle to keep\r\nout of debt."\r\n\r\n"Well! at any rate I am thankful to her for this opportunity of\r\nseeing you," said Julius.  "We have both been longing to speak our\r\nwelcome to you."\r\n\r\n"Thank you.  It is so kind," she fervently whispered; "all the\r\nkinder for the state of things that is insisted on--though you know\r\nthat it can make no real difference," she added, apparently\r\naddressing the goldfish.\r\n\r\n"Frank knows it," said Julius, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"I trust he does, though I cannot see him to assure him--you will?"\r\nshe added, looking up at him with a shy brightness in her eye and a\r\nflush on her cheek.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed!" he said, laying his hand on hers for a moment.  "I\r\nfear you may both have much to pull through, but I think you are of\r\na steadfast nature."\r\n\r\n"I hope so--I think I am, for none of my feelings seem to me ever to\r\nchange, except that I get harder, and, I am afraid, bitterer."\r\n\r\n"I can understand your feeling that form of trial."\r\n\r\n"Oh, if you could, and would help me!"\r\n\r\n"As a brother; if I may."\r\n\r\nAgain she laid a hand on his, saying, "I have longed to talk openly\r\nto you ever since we met in the cow-shed; but I could not make any\r\nadvance to any of you, because," she whispered in haste, "I thought\r\nit my duty to hold back from Frank.  And now, till we go away,\r\nCamilla watches me and occupies me every minute, will not even let\r\nme ride out with papa.  I wonder she lets me talk to you now."\r\n\r\n"We know each other," said Julius, shortly.\r\n\r\nIt was so.  Once, in the plain-spoken days of childhood, Miles and\r\nJulius had detected Camilla Vivian in some flagrant cheating at a\r\ngame, and had roundly expressed their opinion.  In the subsequent\r\nperiod of Raymond\'s courtship, Miles had succumbed to the\r\nfascination, but Julius had given one such foil, that she had never\r\nagain attempted to cajole him.\r\n\r\n"I have seen that you did from the first," said Lenore.  "And it\r\nwould make it much easier to talk to you than to any outsider, who\r\nwould never understand, even if it were possible for me to explain,\r\nhow hard it is to see which way my duty lies--especially filial."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean in general, or in this special matter?"\r\n\r\n"Both.  You see, in her hands he is so different from what he was\r\nbefore she came home, that I don\'t feel as if I was obeying him--\r\nonly her; and I don\'t think I am bound to do that.  Not in the great\r\nmatter, I am clear.  Nobody can meddle with my real sincere pledge\r\nof myself to Frank, nobody!" she spoke as if there was iron in her\r\nlips.  "But as far as overt acts go, they have a right to forbid me,\r\ntill I am of age at least, and we must bear it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you are right there."\r\n\r\n"But there are thousands of other little cases of right and wrong,\r\nand altogether I have come to such a spirit of opposition that I\r\nfind it easier to resist than to do anything with a good grace."\r\n\r\n"You cannot always tell when resistance is principle, and when\r\ntemper or distaste."\r\n\r\n"There\'s distaste enough always," said poor Lenore.\r\n\r\n"To gaieties?" he said, amazed as one habituated to his wife\'s\r\nravenous appetite for any sort of society or amusement.\r\n\r\n"Of course," she answered sadly.  "A great deal of trouble just for\r\na little empty babble.  Often not one word worth remembering, and a\r\ngeneral sense of having been full of bad feelings."\r\n\r\n"No enjoyment?" he asked in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Only by the merest chance and exception," she answered, surprised\r\nat his surprise; "what is there to enjoy?"\r\n\r\nThe peculiar-looking clergyman might have seemed more likely to ask\r\nsuch a question than the beautiful girl, but he looked at her\r\nanxiously and said, "Don\'t nourish morbid dislike and contempt, my\r\ndear Lena, it is not a safeguard.  There are such things as perilous\r\nreactions.  Try to weigh justly, and be grateful for kindness, and\r\nto like what is likeable."\r\n\r\nAt that moment, after what had been an interval of weary famine to\r\nall but these two, host and hostess appeared, the lady as usual,\r\npicturesque, though in the old black silk, with a Roman sash tied\r\ntransversely, and holly in her hair; and gaily shaking hands--\r\n"That\'s right, Lady Rosamond; so you are trusted here!  Your husband\r\nhasn\'t sent you to represent him?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid his confidence in me did not go so far," said Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Ah!  I see--Lady Tyrrell, how d\'ye do--you\'ve brought Lena?  Well,\r\nRector, are you prepared?"\r\n\r\n"That depends on what you expect of me."\r\n\r\n"Have you the convinceable spot in your mind?"\r\n\r\n"We must find it.  It is very uncommon, and indurates very soon, so\r\nwe had better make the most of our opportunity," said the American\r\nlady, who had entered as resplendent as before, though in so\r\ndifferent a style that Rosamond wondered how such a wardrobe could\r\nbe carried about the world; and the sporting friend muttered,\r\n"Stunning! she has been making kickshaws all day, and looks as if\r\nshe came out of a bandbox!  If all women were like that, it might\r\npay."\r\n\r\nIt was true.  Mrs. Tallboys was one of those women of resource whose\r\npractical powers may well inspire the sense of superiority, and with\r\nthe ease and confidence of her country.\r\n\r\nThe meal was a real success.  That some portion had been procured,\r\nready dressed, at Backsworth, was evident, but all that had been\r\ndone at home had a certain piquant Transatlantic flavour, in which\r\nthe American Muse could be detected; and both she and her husband\r\nwere polished, lively, and very agreeable, in spite of the twang in\r\ntheir voices.  Miss Moy, the Captain and his friend, talked horses\r\nat one end of the table, and Rosamond faltered her woman\'s horror\r\nfor the rights of her sex, increased by this supposed instance.\r\n\r\nWhen the ladies rose at dessert, Mrs. Duncombe summoned him:  "Come,\r\nRector!--come, Professor! you\'re not to sit over your wine."\r\n\r\n"We rise so far above the ordinary level of manhood!" said Julius,\r\nobediently rising.\r\n\r\n"Once for all, Mr. Charnock," said Mrs. Duncombe, turning on him\r\nwith flashing eyes and her Elizabethan majesty, "if you come\r\nprepared to scoff, we can have nothing to do with you."\r\n\r\nRosamond\'s eyes looked mischievous, and her brow cocked, but Julius\r\nanswered in earnest, "Really, I assure you I have not come in a\r\nspirit of sarcasm; I am honestly desirous of hearing your\r\narguments."\r\n\r\n"Shall I stay in your stead?" added Miss Moy.  "They\'ll be much more\r\namusing here!"\r\n\r\n"Come, Gussie, you\'re on your good behaviour," said Mrs. Duncombe.\r\n"Bob kept you to learn the right way of making a sensation."\r\n\r\nAs they entered the drawing-room two more guests arrived, namely,\r\nJoanna Bowater, and Herbert, who walked in with a kind of grim\r\nsubmission, till he saw Lady Tyrrell, when he lighted up, and, on a\r\nlittle gracious gesture with her hand, he sat down on the sofa\r\nbeside her; and was there solaced by an occasional remark in an\r\nundertone; for indeed the boy was always in a trance wherever she\r\nwas, and she had a fair amount of by-play wherewith to entertain\r\nherself and him during the discussion.\r\n\r\n"You are just in time, Jenny," said Rosamond; "the great question is\r\ngoing to be started."\r\n\r\n"And it is--?"\r\n\r\n"The Equality of the Sexes," pronounced Mrs. Duncombe.\r\n\r\n"Ex cathedra?" said Julius, as the graceful Muse seated herself in a\r\nlarge red arm-chair.  "This scene is not an easy one in which to\r\ndispute it."\r\n\r\n"You see, Bessie," said Mrs. Tallboys, "that men are so much afraid\r\nof the discussion that they try to elude it with empty compliment\r\nunder which is couched a covert sneer."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," returned Julius, "we might complain that we can\'t open\r\nour lips without compliments and sneers being detected when we were\r\ninnocent of both."\r\n\r\n"Were you?" demanded Mrs. Tallboys.\r\n\r\n"Honestly, I was looking round and thinking the specimens before us\r\nwould tell in your favour."\r\n\r\n"What a gallant parson!" cried Miss Moy.\r\n\r\nBut a perfect clamour broke out from others.\r\n\r\n"Julius, that\'s too bad! when you know--"\r\n\r\n"Mr Charnock, you are quite mistaken.  Bob is much cleverer than I,\r\nin his own line--"\r\n\r\n"Quite true, Rector," affirmed Herbert; "Joan has more brains than\r\nall the rest of us--for a woman, I mean."\r\n\r\n"For a woman!" repeated Mrs. Tallboys.  "Let a human being do or be\r\nwhat she will, it is disposed of in a moment by that one verdict,\r\n\'Very well for a woman!\'"\r\n\r\n"How is it with the decision of posterity?" said Jenny.  "Can you\r\nshow any work of woman of equal honour and permanence with that of\r\nmen?"\r\n\r\n"Because her training has been sedulously inferior."\r\n\r\n"Not always," said Jenny; "not in Italy in the cinque cento, nor in\r\nEngland under Elizabeth."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and there were names--!"\r\n\r\n"Names, yes, but that is all.  The lady\'s name is remembered for the\r\ncuriosity of her having equalled the ordinary poet or artist of her\r\ntime, but her performances either are lost or only known to curious\r\nscholars.  They have not the quality which makes things permanent."\r\n\r\n"What do you say to Sappho?"\r\n\r\n"There is nothing of her but a name, and fragments that curious\r\nscholars read."\r\n\r\n"Worse luck to her if she invented Sapphics," added Herbert.\r\n\r\n"One of womankind\'s torments for mankind, eh?" said his neighbour.\r\n\r\n"And there are plenty more such," asserted Mrs. Duncombe, boldly\r\n(for these were asides).  "It is only that one can\'t recollect--and\r\nthe men have suppressed them."\r\n\r\n"I think men praised them," said Jenny, "and that we remember the\r\npraise, not the works.  For instance, Roswitha, or Olympia Morata,\r\nor Vittoria Colonna.  Vittoria\'s sonnets are extant, but we only\r\nvalue them as being hers, more for what she _was_ than for their\r\nintrinsic merit."\r\n\r\n"And," added Eleonora, "men did not suppress Hannah More, or Joanna\r\nBaillie.  You know Scott thought Miss Baillie\'s dramas would rank\r\nwith Shakespeare\'s."\r\n\r\nMrs. Tallboys was better read in logic and mathematics than in\r\nhistory, and did not follow Jenny, but she turned her adversary\'s\r\nargument to her own advantage, by exclaiming, "Are the gentlemen\r\npresent familiar with these bright lights?"\r\n\r\n"I confess my ignorance of some of them," said Julius.\r\n\r\n"But my youngest brother knows all that," said Rosamond at a brave\r\nventure.\r\n\r\n"Macaulay\'s school-boy," murmured Lady Tyrrell, softly.\r\n\r\n"Let us return to the main point," said Mrs. Tallboys, a little\r\nannoyed.  "It is of the present and future that I would speak, not\r\nof the past."\r\n\r\n"Does not the past give the only data on which to form a\r\nconclusion?" said Julius.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not.  The proposition is not what a woman or two in her\r\ndown-trodden state may have exceptionally effected, but her natural\r\nequality, and in fact superiority, in all but the physical strength\r\nwhich has imposed an unjust bondage on the higher nature."\r\n\r\n"I hardly know where to meet you if you reject all arguments from\r\nproved facts," said Julius.\r\n\r\n"And the Bible.  Why don\'t you say the Bible?" exclaimed his wife in\r\nan undertone; but Mrs. Tallboys took it up and said, "The precepts\r\nof Scripture are founded on a state of society passed away.  You may\r\nfind arguments for slavery there."\r\n\r\n"I doubt that," said Julius.  "There are practical directions for an\r\nexisting state of things, which have been distorted into sanction\r\nfor its continuance.  The actual precepts are broad principles,\r\nwhich are for all times, and apply to the hired servant as well as\r\nto the slave.  So again with the relations of man and wife; I can\r\nnowhere find a command so adapted to the seclusion and depression of\r\nthe Eastern woman as to be inapplicable to the Christian matron.\r\nAnd the typical virtuous woman, the valiant woman, is one of the\r\nnoblest figures anywhere depicted."\r\n\r\n"I know," said Mrs. Tallboys, who had evidently been waiting\r\nimpatiently again to declaim, "that men, even ministers of religion,\r\nfrom Paul if you like downwards, have been willing enough to exalt\r\nwoman so long as they claim to sit above her.  The higher the\r\noppressed, so much higher the self-exaltation of the oppressor.\r\nPaul and Peter exalt their virtuous woman, but only as their own\r\nappendage, adorning themselves; and while society with religious\r\nministers at the head of it call on woman to submit, and degrade the\r\nsex, we shall continue to hear of such disgraces to England as I see\r\nin your police reports--brutal mechanics beating their wives."\r\n\r\n"I fear while physical force is on the side of the brute," said\r\nJulius, "no abstract recognition of equality would save her."\r\n\r\n"Society would take up her cause, and protect her."\r\n\r\n"So it is willing to do now, if she asks for protection."\r\n\r\n"Yes," broke in Rosamond, "but nothing would induce a woman worth\r\nsixpence to take the law against her husband."\r\n\r\n"There I think Lady Rosamond has at once demonstrated the higher\r\nnature of the woman," said Mrs. Tallboys.  "What man would be\r\ncapable of such generosity?"\r\n\r\n"No one denies," said Julius, "that generous forbearance, patience,\r\nfortitude, and self-renunciation, belong almost naturally to the\r\ntrue wife and mother, and are her great glory; but would she not be\r\nstripped of them by self-assertion as the peer in power?"\r\n\r\n"Turning our flank again with a compliment," said Mrs. Duncombe.\r\n"These fine qualities are very convenient to yourselves, and so you\r\npraise them up."\r\n\r\n"Not so!" returned Julius, "because they are really the higher\r\nvirtues!"\r\n\r\n"Patience!" at once exclaimed the American and English emancipators\r\nwith some scorn.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Julius, in a low tone of thorough earnest.  "The\r\npatience of strength and love is the culmination of virtue."\r\n\r\nJenny knew what was in his mind, but Mrs. Tallboys, with a curious\r\ntone, half pique, half triumph, said, "You acknowledge this which\r\nyou call the higher nature in woman--that is to say, all the passive\r\nqualities,--and you are willing to allow her a finer spiritual\r\nessence, and yet you do not agree to her equal rights.  This is the\r\ninjustice of the prejudice which has depressed her all these\r\ncenturies."\r\n\r\n"Stay," broke in Jenny, evidently not to the lady\'s satisfaction.\r\n"That does not state the question.  Nobody denies that woman is\r\noften of a higher and finer essence, as you say, than man, and has\r\nsome noble qualities in a higher degree than any but the most\r\nperfect men; but that is not the question.  It is whether she have\r\nmore force and capacity than man, is in fact actually able to be on\r\nan equality."\r\n\r\n"And, I say," returned Mrs. Tallboys, "that man has used brute force\r\nto cramp woman\'s intellect and energy so long, that she has learnt\r\nto acquiesce in her position, and to abstain from exerting herself,\r\nso that it is only where she is partially emancipated, as in my own\r\ncountry, that any idea of her powers can be gained."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid," said Julius, "that more may be lost to the world than\r\nis gained!  No; I am not speaking from the tyrant point of view.  I\r\nam thinking whether free friction with the world way not lessen that\r\nsweetness and tender innocence and purity that make a man\'s home an\r\nideal and a sanctuary--his best earthly influence."\r\n\r\n"This is only sentiment.  Innocence is worthless if it cannot stand\r\nalone and protect itself!" said Mrs. Tallboys.\r\n\r\n"I do not mean innocence unable to stand alone.  It should be strong\r\nand trustworthy, but should have the bloom on it still, not rubbed\r\noff by contact or knowledge of evil.  Desire of shielding that bloom\r\nfrom the slightest breath of contamination is no small motive for\r\nself-restraint, and therefore a great preservative to most men."\r\n\r\n"Women purify the atmosphere wherever they go," said the lady.\r\n\r\n"Many women do," returned Julius; "but will they retain that power\r\nuniversally if they succeed in obtaining a position where there will\r\nbe less consideration for them, and they must be exposed to a\r\ncertain hardening and roughening process?"\r\n\r\n"If so," exclaimed Mrs. Tallboys, "if men are so base, we would soon\r\nassert ourselves.  We are no frail morning glories for you to guard\r\nand worship with restraint, lest forsooth your natural breath should\r\nwither us away."\r\n\r\nAs she spoke the door opened, and, with a strong reek of tobacco, in\r\ncame the two other gentlemen.  "Well, Rector, have you given in?"\r\nasked the Captain.  "Is Lady Rosamond to mount the pulpit\r\nhenceforth?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! wouldn\'t I preach you a sermon," returned Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"To resume," said Mrs. Tallboys, sitting very upright.  "You still\r\ngo on the old assumption that woman was made for you.  It is all the\r\nsame story:  one man says she is for his pleasure, another for his\r\nservant, and you, for--for his refinement.  You would all have us\r\nadjectives.  Now I defy you to prove that woman is not a\r\nsubstantive, created for herself."\r\n\r\n"If you said \'growed,\' Mrs. Tallboys, it would be more consistent,"\r\nsaid Jenny.  "Her creation and her purpose in the world stand upon\r\nprecisely the same authority."\r\n\r\n"I wonder at you, Miss Bowater," said Mrs. Tallboys.  "I cannot\r\nunderstand a woman trying to depreciate her sex."\r\n\r\n"No," thrust in Gussie Moy; "I want to know why a woman can\'t go\r\nabout without a dowager waddling after her" ("Thank you," breathed\r\nLady Tyrrell into Herbert\'s ear), "nor go to a club."\r\n\r\n"There was such a club proposed in London," said Captain Duncombe,\r\n"and do you know, Gussie, the name of it?"\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"The Middlesex Club!"\r\n\r\n"There! it is just as Mrs. Tallboys said; you will do nothing but\r\nlaugh at us, or else talk sentiment about our refining you.  Now, I\r\nwant to be free to amuse myself."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think those trifling considerations will be great\r\nimpediments in your way," said Lady Tyrrell in her blandest tone.\r\n"Is that actually the carriage?  Thank you, Mrs. Tallboys.  This is\r\ngood-bye, I believe.  I am sorry there has not been more time for a\r\nfuller exposition to-night."\r\n\r\n"There would have been, but I never was so interrupted," said Mrs.\r\nTallboys in an undertone, with a displeased look at Jenny at the\r\nother end of the room.\r\n\r\nDeclamation was evidently more the Muse\'s forte than argument, but\r\nher aside was an aside, and that of the jockey friend was not.  "So\r\nyou waited for us to give your part of the lecture, Miss Moy?"\r\n\r\n"Of course.  What\'s the use of talking to a set of women and\r\nparsons, who are just the same?"\r\n\r\nPoor Herbert\'s indignant flush infinitely amused the party who were\r\ncloaking in the hall.  "Poor Gussie; her tongue runs fast," said\r\nMrs. Duncombe.\r\n\r\n"Emancipated!" said Jenny.  "Good-bye, Mrs. Duncombe.  Please let us\r\nbe educated up to our privileges before we get them."\r\n\r\n"A Parthian shot, Jenny," said Julius, as they gave her a homeward\r\nlift in the carriage.  "You proved yourself the fittest memberess\r\nfor the future parliament to-night."\r\n\r\n"To be elected by the women and parsons," said Jenny, with little\r\nchuckle of fun.  "Poor Herbert!"\r\n\r\n"I only wish that girl was a man that I might horsewhip her," the\r\nclerical sentiment growled out from Herbert\'s corner of the\r\ncarriage.  "Degradation of her sex!  She\'s a standing one!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\nVivienne\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the old women that ever I saw,\r\nSweet bad luck to my mother in law.--Irish Song\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary Session had reached the stage that is ended by no\r\npower save that of grouse, and the streets were full of vans\r\nfantastically decorated with baths, chairs, bedsteads, and nursery\r\ngear.\r\n\r\nCecil could see two before different house-doors as she sat behind\r\nher muslin curtains, looking as fresh and healthful as ever, and\r\nscarcely more matronly, except that her air of self-assertion had\r\nbecome more easy and less aggressive now that she was undisputed\r\nmistress of the house in London.\r\n\r\nThere was no concern on her part that she was not the mother of\r\neither of the two latest scions of the house of Charnock.  Certainly\r\nshe did not like to be outdone by Rosamond; but then it was only a\r\ngirl, and she could afford to wait for the son and heir; indeed, she\r\ndid not yet desire him at the cost of all the distinguished and\r\nintellectual society, the concerts, soirees, and lectures that his\r\nnon-arrival left her free to enjoy.  The other son and heir\r\ninterested her nearly, for he was her half-brother.  There had been\r\nsomething almost ludicrous in the apologies to her.  His mother\r\nseemed to feel like a traitor to her, and Mr. Charnock could hardly\r\nreconcile his darling\'s deposition with his pride in the newcomer.\r\nBoth she and Raymond had honestly rejoiced in their happiness and\r\nthe continuance of the direct line of Dunstone, and had completed\r\nthe rejoicing of the parents by thorough sympathy, when the party\r\nwith this unlooked-for addition had returned home in the spring.\r\nMrs. Charnock had insisted on endowing his daughter as largely as he\r\njustly could, to compensate for this change in her expectations, and\r\nwas in doubt between Swanmore, an estate on the Backsworth side of\r\nWillansborough, and Sirenwood itself, to purchase and settle on her.\r\nRaymond would greatly have preferred Sirenwood, both from its\r\nadjoining the Compton property and as it would be buying out the\r\nVivians; but there were doubts about the involvements, and nothing\r\ncould be done till Eleonora\'s majority.  Mr. Charnock preferred\r\nSwanmore as an investment, and Raymond could, of course, not press\r\nhis wishes.\r\n\r\nA short visit had been made at Dunstone to join in the festivities\r\nin honour of the little heir, but Cecil had not been at Compton\r\nsince Christmas, though Raymond had several times gone home for a\r\nSunday when she had other companionship.  Charlie had been with them\r\npreparing his outfit for India whither he had been gone about a\r\nmonth; and Frank, though living in lodgings, was the more frequently\r\nat his sister-in-law\'s service, because wherever she was the Vivian\r\nsisters might be looked for.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Raymond taken the house in --- Square than Lady\r\nTyrrell had engaged the opposite one, so that one household could\r\nenjoy evening views of the other\'s interior, and Cecil had chiefly\r\ngone into society under her friend\'s auspices.  Her presentation at\r\nCourt had indeed been by the marchioness; she had been staying with\r\nan old friend of Mrs. Poynsett\'s, quite prepared to be intimate with\r\nRaymond Poynsett\'s wife, if only Cecil would have taken to her.  But\r\nthat lady\'s acceptance of any one recommended in this manner was not\r\nto be thought of, and besides, the family were lively, merry people,\r\nand Cecil was one of those who dislike and distrust laughter, lest\r\nit should be at themselves.  So she remained on coldly civil terms\r\nwith that pleasant party, and though to a certain degree following\r\nher husband\'s lead as to her engagements, all her ways were moulded\r\nby her friend\'s influence.  Nor was the effect otherwise than\r\nbecoming.  Nothing could be in better taste than all in Mrs.\r\nCharnock Poynsett\'s establishment, and London and Lady Tyrrell\r\ntogether had greatly improved her manners.  All her entertainments\r\nwent off well, and she filled her place in the world with grace and\r\nskill, just as she had always figured herself doing.\r\n\r\nYet there was a sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction, which\r\nincreased upon her as the time drew nearer for returning to be again\r\nonly a guest in her married home.  It was a tangible grievance on\r\nwhich her mind could fix itself.  Surely it was hard on her that her\r\nhusband should require it of her, and yet she perceived that he\r\ncould not avoid it, since his mother was mistress.  She knew too\r\nthat he was unfailingly kind, attentive, and indulgent, except on\r\nthat one occasion when he had sharply reproved her for her behaviour\r\nin the Tallboys matter; and strange to say, a much stronger feeling\r\ntowards him had been setting in ever since that one time when she\r\nhad seen him thoroughly angry.  She longed and craved to stir that\r\neven, gentle courtesy to frowns or smiles; and yet there was a\r\nperversity in her nature that seem to render it impossible to her to\r\nattempt to win a smile from him, far more so to lay aside any device\r\nor desire of her own to gratify him.  All she did know was, that to\r\nbe all that her ambition had sought, a Charnock by marriage as well\r\nas birth, and with a kind, considerate husband, was not enough to\r\nhinder a heartsickness she had never known or supposed possible.\r\n\r\nPresently, through the flowers in her balcony, Cecil saw the opening\r\nand closing of the opposite house-door, and a white parasol\r\nunfurled, and she had only time to finish and address her letter to\r\nMrs. Duncombe before Lady Tyrrell was announced.\r\n\r\n"Here I am after a hard morning\'s work, winding up accounts, &c."\r\n\r\n"You go to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, trusting that you will soon follow; though you might be a\r\ncockney born, your bloom is town-proof."\r\n\r\n"We follow as soon as the division on the Education Question is\r\nover, and that will not be for ten days.  You are come to look at my\r\nstores for the bazaar; but first, what are you going to do this\r\nafternoon?"\r\n\r\n"What are your plans?"\r\n\r\n"I must leave cards at half-a-dozen people\'s at the other end of the\r\npark.  Will you come with me?  Where is Lenore?"\r\n\r\n"She is gone to take leave of the Strangeways\' party; Lady Susan\r\ninsisted on having her for this last day.  Poor Frank!  I confess\r\nimpartially that it does not look well for him."\r\n\r\n"Poor Frank!" repeated Cecil, "he does look very forlorn when he\r\nhears where she is."\r\n\r\n"When, after all, if the silly boy could only see it, it is the most\r\nfortunate thing that could happen to him, and the only chance of\r\nkeeping his head above water.  I have made Lady Susan promise me two\r\nof her daughters for the bazaar.  They thoroughly know how to make\r\nthemselves useful.  Oh, how pretty!"\r\n\r\nFor Cecil was producing from the shelves of various pieces of\r\nfurniture a large stock of fancy articles--Swiss carvings, Spa toys,\r\nGenevese ornaments, and Japanese curiosities, which, as Lady Tyrrell\r\nsaid, "rivalled her own accumulation, and would serve to carry off\r\nthe housewives and pen-wipers on which all the old maids of\r\nWil\'sbro\' were employed."\r\n\r\n"We must put out our programmes," Cecil added; "people will not work\r\nin earnest till the day is fixed and they know the sellers."\r\n\r\n"Yes, the lady patronesses are most important," said Lady Tyrrell,\r\nwriting them down:  "Mrs. Raymond Charnock Poynsett; Lady Rosamond,\r\neh?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, Julius won\'t hear of it."\r\n\r\n"And opposition is sweet:  so we lose her romantic name, and the\r\nstall of the three brides.  Mrs. Miles Charnock is too much out of\r\nthe world to be worth asking.  Then myself--Mrs. Duncombe, Mrs.\r\nFuller, as a matter of necessity, Mrs. Moy."\r\n\r\n"Oh!"\r\n\r\n"Needful, my dear, to propitiate that set.  Also that mayoress, Mrs.\r\nTruelove, isn\'t she?  Six.  We\'ll fill up with country people!"\r\n\r\nSix more distinguished names were soon supplied of ladies who would\r\ngive their patronage, provided neither toil nor care was required of\r\nthem; and still consulting, the two friends took their seats in the\r\ncarriage.  The time of the bazaar was to be fixed by the opening of\r\nthe town-hall, which was to take place on the 12th of September--a\r\nThursday, the week before the races; and the most propitious days\r\nappeared to be the Tuesday and Wednesday before the Great Backsworth\r\nCup Day, since the world would then be in an excited, pleasure-\r\nseeking state, favourable to their designs.\r\n\r\n"I shall have a party in the house," said Lady Tyrrell:  "shall you\r\nbe able?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell; you know it does not depend on me, and I certainly\r\nshall not ask it as a favour.  Camilla, did I tell you that I tried\r\nto make my father understand the state of things, and speak to\r\nRaymond?  But he would only say, that while I am so young and\r\ninexperienced, it is a great advantage for me to live with Mrs.\r\nPoynsett, and that I must be the greatest comfort to her.  Papa is\r\nan intense believer in Mrs. Poynsett, and when he once has taken up\r\na notion nothing will convince him."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t even make capital of this purchase of a house of your\r\nown?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to do that."\r\n\r\n"My dear, I see your delicacy and forbearance, and I would not urge\r\nyou, if I did not see how deeply your happiness is concerned.  Of\r\ncourse I don\'t mean merely the authority over the wirthschaft,\r\nthough somehow the cares of it are an ingredient in female\r\ncontentment; but forgive me, Cecil, I am certain that you will never\r\ntake your right place--where you care for it more--till you have a\r\nhome of your own."\r\n\r\n"Ah!"  The responsive sound burst from the very depths of Cecil\'s\r\nheart, penetrated as they had never been before; but pride and\r\nreserve at once sprang up, and she answered coldly, "I have no\r\nreason to complain."\r\n\r\n"Right, my dear Cecil, I like you the better;" and she pressed her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"It is quite true," said Cecil, withdrawing hers.\r\n\r\n"Quite, absolutely true.  He would die rather than give you any\r\nreason for the slightest murmur; but, Cecil, dearest, that very\r\nheedfulness shows there is something he cannot give you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why you should say so," answered a proud but choked\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"I say so," replied the clear tones, firmly, though with a touch of\r\npity, "because I see it.  Cecil, poor child, they married you very\r\nyoung!"\r\n\r\n"I missed nothing," exclaimed Cecil; but she felt that she could\r\nonly say so in the past, and her eyes burnt with unshed tears.\r\n\r\n"No, my dear, you were still a girl, and your deeper woman\'s heart\r\nhad not grown to perceive that it was not met."\r\n\r\n"He chose me," she faintly said.\r\n\r\n"His mother needed a daughter.  It was proper for him to marry, and\r\nyou were the most eligible party.  I will answer for it that he\r\nwarned you how little he could give."\r\n\r\n"He did," cried Cecil.  "He did tell me that he could not begin in\r\nfreshness and warmth, like a young man; but I thought it only meant\r\nthat we were too sensible to care about nonsense, and liked him for\r\nit.  He always must have been staid and reserved--he could never\r\nhave been different, Camilla.  Don\'t smile in that way!  Tell me\r\nwhat you mean."\r\n\r\n"My dear Cecil, I knew Raymond Poynsett a good many years before you\r\ndid."\r\n\r\n"And--well?  Then he had a first love?" said Cecil, in a voice\r\nschooled into quiet.  "Was he different then?  Was he as desperate\r\nas poor Frank is now?"\r\n\r\n"Frank is a very mild copy of him at that age.  He overbore every\r\none, wrung consent from all, and did everything but overcome his\r\nmother\'s calm hostility and self-assertion."\r\n\r\n"Did that stop it?  She died of course," said Cecil.  "She could not\r\nhave left off loving him."\r\n\r\n"She did not die, but her family were wearied out by the continual\r\nobjections to their overtures, and the supercilious way of treating\r\nthem.  They thought it a struggle of influence, and that he was too\r\nentirely dominated for a daughter-in-law to be happy with her.  So\r\nthey broke it off."\r\n\r\n"And she--" Cecil looked up with searching eyes.\r\n\r\n"She had acutely felt the offence, the weakness, the dutifulness,\r\nwhatever you may choose to call it, and in the rebound she married."\r\n\r\n"Who is she?" gasped Cecil.\r\n\r\n"It is not fair to tell you," was the gentle answer, with a shade of\r\nrebuke.  "You need not look for her.  She is not in the county."\r\n\r\n"I hope I shall never see her!"\r\n\r\n"You need not dread doing so if you can only have fair play, and\r\nestablish the power that belongs rightly to you.  She would have no\r\nchance with you, even if he had forgiven her."\r\n\r\n"Has not he?"\r\n\r\n"Never!"\r\n\r\n"And he used up all his heart?" said Cecil in a low, musing tone.\r\n\r\n"All but what his mother absorbed.  She was a comparatively young\r\nand brilliant woman, and she knew her power.  It is a great\r\nascendancy, and only a man\'s honest blindness could suppose that any\r\nwoman would be content under it."\r\n\r\nCecil\'s tongue refused to utter what oppressed her heart--those\r\nevenings beside the sofa, those eager home expeditions for Sunday,\r\nthe uniform maintenance of his mother\'s supremacy.\r\n\r\n"And you think absence from her would lessen her influence?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure of it.  There might be a struggle, but if I know Mr.\r\nCharnock Poynsett rightly, he is too upright not to be conscious of\r\nwhat is due to you, and be grieved not to be able to give you more--\r\nthat is, when his mother is not holding him in her grasp.  Nor can\r\nthere be any valid objection, since Mrs Miles Charnock is always at\r\nher service."\r\n\r\n"She will return to Africa.  I don\'t know why she and Rosamond have\r\nbeen always so much more acceptable."\r\n\r\n"They are not her rivals; besides, they have not your strength.  She\r\nis a woman who tries to break whatever she cannot bend, and the\r\ninstant her son began to slip from her grasp the contest necessarily\r\nbegan.  You had much better have it over once and for ever, and have\r\nhim on your side.  Insist on a house of your own, and when you have\r\nmade your husband happy in it, then, then--Ah!  Good morning--Sir\r\nGeorge!"\r\n\r\nShe had meant to say, "Then you win his heart," but the words would\r\nnot come, and a loathing hatred of the cold-hearted child who had a\r\nproperty in Raymond so mastered her that she welcomed the\r\ninterruption, and did not return to the subject.\r\n\r\nShe knew when she had said enough, and feared to betray herself; nor\r\ncould Cecil bear to resume the talk, stunned and sore as she was at\r\nthe revelation, though with no suspicion that the speaker had been\r\nthe object of her husband\'s affection.  She thought it must have\r\nbeen the other sister, now in India, and that this gave the key to\r\nmany allusions she had heard and which she marvelled at herself for\r\nnot having understood.  The equivocation had entirely deceived her,\r\nand she little thought she had been taking counsel with the rival\r\nwho was secretly triumphing in Raymond\'s involuntary constancy, and\r\nsowing seeds of vengeance against an ancient enemy.\r\n\r\nShe could not settle to anything when she came home.  Life had taken\r\na new aspect.  Hitherto she had viewed herself as born to all\r\nattention and deference, and had taken it as a right, and now she\r\nfound herself the victim of a mariage de convenance to a man of\r\nexhausted affections, who meant her only to be the attendant of his\r\ndomineering mother.  The love that was dawning in her heart did but\r\nadd poignancy to the bitterness of the revelation, and fervour to\r\nher resolve to win the mastery over the heart which was her lawful\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nShe was restless till his return.  She was going to an evening\r\nparty, and though usually passive as to dress, she was so changeable\r\nand difficult to satisfy that Grindstone grew cross, and showed it\r\nby stern, rigid obedience.  And Cecil well knew that Grindstone; who\r\nwas in authority in the present house, hated the return to be merely\r\nthe visitor of Alston and Jenkins.\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room Cecil fluttered from book to window, window to\r\npiano again, throwing down her occupation at every sound and taking\r\nup another; and when at last Raymond came in, his presence at first\r\nmade her musings seem mere fancies.\r\n\r\nIndeed it would have been hard to define what was wanting in his\r\nmanner.  He lamented his unavoidable delay, and entertained her with\r\nall the political and parliamentary gossip he had brought home, and\r\nwhich she always much enjoyed as a tribute to her wisdom, so much\r\nthat it had been an entire, though insensible cure for the Rights of\r\nWoman.  Moreover, he was going with her to this \'drum,\' though he\r\nwould greatly have preferred the debate, and was to be summoned in\r\ncase of a division.  She knew enough of the world to be aware that\r\nsuch an attentive and courteous husband was not the rule.  But what\r\nwas courtesy to one who longed for unity?\r\n\r\n"Is Frank to be there this evening?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I believe so."\r\n\r\n"I thought he was to have gone with us."\r\n\r\n"He told me not to depend on him.  He had made an engagement to ride\r\ninto the country with Sir Harry Vivian."  And she added, though the\r\nproud spirit so hated what seemed to her like making an advance that\r\nit sounded like a complaint, "So you can\'t avoid going with me?"\r\n\r\n"I should any way have gone with you, but I may have to leave you to\r\nFrank to see you away," he said.  "And I had rather have Frank here\r\nthan with that set."\r\n\r\n"Breaking up one of our few tete-a-tete evenings, and they are\r\nbecoming few enough!"\r\n\r\nThis murmur gratified him, and he said, "We shall be more alone\r\ntogether now.  The Rectory is almost ready, and Julius means to move\r\nin another week, and I suppose Miles will carry Anne off before the\r\nyear is over."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we are the only ones with no home."\r\n\r\n"Rather, we hold fast to the old home."\r\n\r\n"Not my old home."\r\n\r\n"Does not mine become yours?"\r\n\r\n"Not while--."  She paused and started afresh.  "Raymond, could we\r\nnot live at Swanslea, if it is bought for us?"\r\n\r\n"Swanslea!  Five miles off!  Impossible."\r\n\r\nCecil was silent.\r\n\r\n"My dear Cecil," he said, after a few moments\' consideration, "I can\r\nunderstand that you felt unfortunately crowded last year, but all\r\nthat is over, and you must see that we are necessary to my mother,\r\nand that all my duties require me to live at home."\r\n\r\n"You could attend to the property from Swanslea."\r\n\r\n"The property indeed!  I meant my mother!"\r\n\r\n"She has Anne."\r\n\r\n"Anne will soon be in Africa--even if she were more of a companion.\r\nI am sorry it is a trial to you; for my proper place is clearly with\r\nmy mother, the more in her helpless state, and with my brothers gone\r\nout into the world.  Now that the numbers are smaller, you will find\r\nit much easier to take the part that I most earnestly wish should be\r\nyours."\r\n\r\n"I cannot get on with her."\r\n\r\n"Do not say so!  Do not think so!  To have Rosamond there with her\r\nIrish ease, and her reserve, kept you in the background before; I\r\nsay it, but I could not help it; and now there will be no hindrance\r\nto your drawing together.  There is nothing I so desire."\r\n\r\nIf the carriage had not stopped as he spoke Cecil would not have\r\nuttered the thought that smote her, namely, that his desire was on\r\nbehalf, not of his wife, but of his mother, to whom he was ready to\r\nsacrifice her happiness without a pang.  She did not see that he\r\ncould imagine no greater happiness for her than a thorough love of\r\nhis mother.\r\n\r\nThey certainly were not the happiest couple present as they walked\r\nup-stairs, looking like a model husband and wife, with their name\r\nechoing from landing to landing.\r\n\r\nIf any expression savouring of slang could possibly be applied to\r\nRaymond, he might be said to be struck all of a heap by his wife\'s\r\nproposition.  He had never even thought of the possibility of making\r\na home anywhere but at Compton Poynsett, or of his wife wishing that\r\nhe should do so; and proverbial sayings about the incompatability of\r\nrelatives-in-law suddenly assumed a reasonableness that he could not\r\nbear to remember.\r\n\r\nBut his courtesy and sense of protection, trained by a woman of the\r\nold school, would not suffer him to relax his attention to his wife.\r\nThough he was very anxious to get back to the house, he would not\r\nquit her neighbourhood till he had found Frank and intrusted her to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe was not happy about Frank.  The youth was naturally of an\r\nintellectual and poetical temperament, and had only cared for horses\r\nand field-sports as any healthy lad growing up in a country house\r\nmust enjoy them; and Raymond had seen him introduced to the style of\r\nmen whom he thought would be thoroughly congenial to him, and not\r\nunlikely to lead him on to make a mark in the world.\r\n\r\nBut that unfortunate Vivian attachment stood in the way; Sir Harry\r\nand his elder daughter ignored it entirely, but did not forbid Frank\r\nthe house; though Lady Tyrrell took care, as only she could do, that\r\nEleonora should never have ten minutes private conversation with\r\nhim, either at home or abroad.  Even in a crowd, a ball, or garden-\r\nparty, the vigilant sister had her means of breaking into any kind\r\nof confidence; and Frank was continually tantalized by the pursuit.\r\nIt could not but unsettle him, and draw him into much more gaiety\r\nthan was compatible with the higher pursuits his mother had expected\r\nof him; and what was worse, it threw him into Sir Harry Vivian\'s\r\nset, veteran roues, and younger men who looked up to their\r\nknowingness and listened to their good stories.\r\n\r\nWhat amount of harm it was doing Raymond could not guess.  He had\r\nknown it all himself, and had escaped unscathed, but he did not fear\r\nthe less for his younger brother, and he only hoped that the\r\ninducement to mingle with such society would be at an end before\r\nFrank had formed a taste for the habits that there prevailed.\r\n\r\nEleonora Vivian had been much admired at first, but her cold manner\r\nkept every one at a distance, and her reserve was hardly ever seen\r\nto relax.  However, her one friendship with the Strangeways family\r\ngave Raymond hopes that her constancy was not proof against the\r\nflattering affection, backed by wealth, that seemed to await her\r\nthere.  The best he could wish for Frank was that the infatuation\r\nmight be over as soon as possible, though he pitied the poor fellow\r\nsincerely when he saw him, as he did to-night, waiting with scarcely\r\nconcealed anxiety while Miss Vivian stood listening to a long\r\ndiscourse about yachting from an eager pair of chattering girls.\r\n\r\nThen some break occurred, and Frank moved up to her.  "Your last\r\nevening!  How little I have seen of you!"\r\n\r\n"Little indeed!"\r\n\r\n"I called, but you were at the Strangeways\'."\r\n\r\n"They are very kind to me.  When is your holiday?"\r\n\r\n"Not till spring, but I may get a few days in the autumn:  you will\r\nbe at home?"\r\n\r\n"As far as I know."\r\n\r\n"If I thought for a moment you cared to see me; but you have shown\r\nfew signs of wishing it of late."\r\n\r\n"Frank--if I could make you understand--"\r\n\r\nThey were walking towards a recess, when Lady Tyrrell fastened upon\r\nRaymond.  "Pray find my sister; she forgets that we have to be at\r\nLady Granby\'s--Oh! are you there, Lenore!  Will you see her down,\r\nMr. Poynsett?  Well, Frank, did you get as far as you intended?"\r\n\r\nAnd she went down on his arm, her last words being, "Take care of\r\nyourself till we meet at home.  For this one year I call Sirenwood\r\nhome--then!"\r\n\r\nRaymond and Lenore said no more to one another.  The ladies were put\r\ninto the carriage.  The elder brother bade Frank take care of Cecil,\r\nand started for Westminster with the poor lad\'s blank and\r\ndisappointed face still before his eyes, hoping at least it was well\r\nfor him, but little in love with life, or what it had to offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\nAwfully Jolly\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen life becomes a spasm,\r\n   And history a whiz,\r\nIf that is not sensation,\r\n   I don\'t know what it is.--LEWIS CARROLL\r\n\r\n"Is Lady Rosamond at home?"\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Nor Mrs. Charnock?"\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am; they are both gone down to the Rectory."\r\n\r\n"Would you ask whether Mrs. Poynsett would like to see me?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll inquire, ma\'am, if you will walk in," said Mr. Jenkins moved\r\nby the wearied and heated looks of Miss Vivian, who had evidently\r\ncome on foot at the unseasonable visiting hour of 11.15 a.m.\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room was empty, but, with windows open on the shady\r\nside, was most inviting to one who had just become unpleasantly\r\naware that her walking capacity had diminished under the stress of a\r\nLondon season, and that a very hampering one.  She was glad of the\r\nrest, but it lasted long enough to be lost in the uncomfortable\r\nconsciousness that hers was too truly a morning call, and she would\r\nhave risen and escaped had not that been worse.\r\n\r\nAt last the door of communication opened, and to her amazement Mrs.\r\nPoynsett was pushed into the room by her maid in a wheeled chair.\r\n"Yes, my dear," she said, in reply to Eleonora\'s exclamation of\r\nsurprise and congratulation, "this is my dear daughters\'\r\nachievement; Rosamond planned and Anne contrived, and they both\r\ncoaxed my lazy bones."\r\n\r\n"I am so very glad!  I had no notion I should see you out of your\r\nroom."\r\n\r\n"Such is one\'s self-importance!  I thought the fame would have\r\nreached you at least."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you don\'t know how little I see of any one I can hear from!\r\nAnd now I am afraid I have disturbed you too early."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, my dear; it was very good and kind, and I am only grieved\r\nthat you had so long to wait; but we will make the most of each\r\nother now.  You will stay to luncheon?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, indeed I am afraid I must not:  papa would not like it,\r\nfor no one knows where I am."\r\n\r\n"You have taken this long walk in the heat, and are going back!  I\r\ndon\'t like it, my dear; you look fagged.  London has not agreed with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett rang her little hand-bell, and ordered in biscuits and\r\nwine, and would have ordered the carriage but for Lenore\'s urgent\r\nentreaties to the contrary, amounting to an admission that she\r\nwished her visit to be unnoticed at home.  This was hardly settled\r\nbefore there was a knock at the door, announcing baby\'s daily visit;\r\nand Miss Julia was exhibited by her grandmamma with great\r\nsatisfaction until another interruption came, in a call from the\r\ndoctor, who only looked in occasionally, and had fallen on this\r\nunfortunate morning.\r\n\r\n"Most unlucky," said Mrs. Poynsett.  "I am afraid you will doubt\r\nabout coming again, and I have not had one word about our Frankie."\r\n\r\n"He is very well.  I saw him at a party the night before we left\r\ntown.  Good-bye, dear Mrs. Poynsett."\r\n\r\n"You will come again?"\r\n\r\n"If I can; but the house is to be full of visitors.  If I don\'t, you\r\nwill know it is because I can\'t."\r\n\r\n"I shall be thankful for whatever you can give me.  I wish I could\r\nsave you that hot walk in the sun."\r\n\r\nBut as Mrs. Poynsett was wheeled into her own room some compensation\r\nbefell Eleonora, for she met Julius in the hall, and he offered to\r\ndrive her to the gates of Sirenwood in what he called \'our new\r\nplaything, the pony carriage,\' on his way to a clerical meeting.\r\n\r\n"You are still here?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Till Tuesday, when we go to the Rectory to receive the two De\r\nLancey boys for the holidays."\r\n\r\n"How Mrs. Poynsett will miss you."\r\n\r\n"Anne is a very efficient companion," said Julius, speaking to her\r\nlike one of the family; "the pity is that she will be so entirely\r\nlost to us when Miles claims her."\r\n\r\n"Then they still mean to settle in Africa?"\r\n\r\n"Her heart has always been there, and her father is in treaty for a\r\nfarm for him, so I fear there is little hope of keeping them.  I\r\ncan\'t think what the parish will do without her.  By the bye, how\r\ndoes Joe Reynolds get on with his drawings?"\r\n\r\n"I must show them to you.  He is really very clever.  We sent him to\r\nthe School of Art twice a week, and he has got on wonderfully.  I\r\nbegin to believe in my academician."\r\n\r\n"So you don\'t repent?"\r\n\r\n"I think not.  As far as I can judge he is a good boy still.  I make\r\nhim my escort to church, so that I am sure of him there.  Renville\r\nwould have taken him for a boy about his studio, and I think he will\r\ngo there eventually; but Camilla thinks he may be an attraction at\r\nthe bazaar, and is making him draw for it."\r\n\r\n"I was in hopes that the bazaar would have blown over, but the\r\nBishop has been demanding of Fuller and his churchwardens how soon\r\nthey mean to put the building in hand, and this seems to be their\r\nonly notion of raising money."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad of this opportunity of asking what you think I had\r\nbetter do about it.  Your wife takes no part in it?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not; but I doubt whether that need be a precedent for\r\nyou.  I am answerable for her, and you could hardly keep out of it\r\nwithout making a divided household."\r\n\r\n"I see the difference, and perhaps I have made myself quite\r\nunpleasant enough already."\r\n\r\n"As the opposition?"\r\n\r\n"And Camilla has been very kind in giving me much more freedom than\r\nI expected, and pacifying papa.  She let me go every Friday evening\r\nto help Lady Susan Strangeways at her mothers\' meeting."\r\n\r\n"Lady Susan Strangeways!  I have heard of her."\r\n\r\n"She has been my comforter and help all this time.  She is all\r\nkindness and heartiness,--elbow-deep in everything good.  She got up\r\nat five o\'clock to finish the decorations at St. Maurice\'s, and to-\r\nday she is taking five hundred school-children to Windsor forest."\r\n\r\n"Is she the mother of the young man at Backsworth?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Eleonora, in rather a different tone.  "Perhaps she goes\r\nrather far; and he has flown into the opposite extreme, though they\r\nsay he is improving, and has given up the turf, and all that sort of\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"Was he at home?  I heard he was on leave."\r\n\r\n"He was said to be at home, but I hardly ever saw him.  He was\r\nalways out with his own friends when I was there."\r\n\r\n"I should not suppose Lady Susan\'s pursuits were much in his line.\r\nIs not one of the daughters a Sister?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, at St. Faith\'s.  She was my great friend.  The younger ones\r\nare nice girls, but have not much in them.  Camilla is going to have\r\nthem down for the bazaar."\r\n\r\n"What, do they patronize bazaars?"\r\n\r\n"Everything that is _doing_ they patronize.  I have known them be\r\neverywhere, from the Drawing-room to a Guild-meeting in a back slum,\r\nand all with equal appetite.  That is one reason why I fear I shall\r\nnot see much of your mother; they are never tired, and I shall never\r\nget out alone.  The house is to be full of people, and we are to be\r\nvery gay."\r\n\r\nShe spoke with a tone that betrayed how little pleasure she\r\nexpected, though it strove to be uncomplaining; and Julius, who had\r\nlearnt something of poor Frank\'s state of jealous misery, heartily\r\nwished the Strangeways family further, regarding the intimacy as a\r\nmanoeuvre of Lady Tyrrell\'s, and doubting how far all Eleonora\'s\r\nevident struggles would keep her out of the net; and though while\r\ntalking to her he had not the slightest doubt of her sincerity, he\r\nhad not long set her down at the lodge before he remembered that she\r\nwas a Vivian.\r\n\r\nMeantime Rosamond, carrying some medicament to old Betty Reynolds,\r\nfound the whole clan in excitement at the appearance of Joe in all\r\nhis buttons, looking quite as honest and innocent, though a good\r\ndeal more civilized, than when he was first discovered among the\r\nswine.\r\n\r\n"Only to think," said his great-grandmother, "that up in London all\r\nthey could gie to he was a bad penny."\r\n\r\n"It is the bronze medal, my lady," said Joshua, with a blush; "the\r\nsecond prize for crayons in our section."\r\n\r\n"Indeed," cried Rosamond.  "You are a genius, Joe, worthy of your\r\nnamesake.  There are many that would be proud to have the grandson\r\nyou have, Betty."\r\n\r\n"Tubby sure," added an aunt-in-law, "\'tis cheap come by.  Such\r\nthings to make a young lad draught.  They ought to be ashamed of\r\nthemselves, they did oughter.  Shut it up, Josh; don\'t be showing it\r\nto the lady--\'tis nothing but the bare back of a sweep."\r\n\r\n"My lady and Miss Vivian have seen it," said Joshua, blushing.\r\n"\'Tis torso, my lady, from a cast from the museum."\r\n\r\n"A black-looking draught," repeated the grandmother.  "I tells Joe\r\nif he drawed like King Geaarge\'s head up at Wil\'sbro\' on the sign,\r\nwith cheeks like apples, and a gould crown atop, he\'d arn his\r\nbread."\r\n\r\n"All in good time, Betty.  He can\'t colour till he can draw.  I\'m\r\nglad to see him looking so well."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my lady, he do have his health torrablish, though he lives in\r\na underground sort of a place; and they fine servants puts upon he\r\nshameful."\r\n\r\n"Granny!" muttered Joshua, in expostulation.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a brave boy, and does not mind roughing it, so he can get on,"\r\nsaid Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"And the ladies are very good to me," said the boy.\r\n\r\n"Show Lady Rosamond the draught you did of Miss Vivian, like a\r\nhangel," suggested the aunt.\r\n\r\nThe rising artist coloured, saying, "Please, my lady, don\'t name it\r\nto no one.  I would not have shown it, but little Bess, she pulled\r\ndown all my things on the floor when I was not looking.  It is from\r\nmemory, my lady, as she looks when she\'s doing anything for Sir\r\nHarry."\r\n\r\nIt was a very lovely sketch--imperfect but full of genius, and\r\nwonderfully catching, the tender, wistful look which was often on\r\nEleonora\'s face, as she waited on her father.  Rosamond longed that\r\nFrank should see it; but the page was very shy about it, and his\r\ngrandmother contrasted it with the performances of the painter \'who\r\nhad draughted all the farmers\' wives in gould frames for five pound\r\na head; but satin gownds and gold chains was extry.\'\r\n\r\nBut Joe had brought her a pound of tea, and an \'image\' for her\r\nmantelpiece, which quite satisfied her, though the image, being a\r\nParian angel of Thorwaldsen\'s, better suited his taste than its\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nThe whole scene served Rosamond for a narrative in her most lively\r\nstyle for Mrs. Poynsett\'s amusement that evening.  There was the\r\nfurther excitement of a letter from Miles, and the assurance that he\r\nwould be at home in November.  Anne had become far less chary of\r\ncommunications from his letters than she had at first been, but of\r\nthis one she kept back so large a portion in public, that the\r\ninstant Mrs. Poynsett had bidden them good night and been wheeled\r\naway, Rosamond put a hand on each shoulder, and looking into her\r\nface, said, "Now, Anne, let us hear!  Miles has found Archie\r\nDouglas.  It is no use pretending.  Fie, Mrs. Anne, why can\'t you\r\ntell me?"\r\n\r\n"I was not to tell any one but Julius."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m Julius.  Besides, wasn\'t I at the very bottom of the\r\ntracing him out?  Haven\'t I the best right to know whether it is bad\r\nor good?"\r\n\r\n"Not bad, I am sure," said Julius, quickly and anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, not bad," answered Anne.  "He has seen him--had him on\r\nboard for a night."\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"Off Durban.  But this whole sheet about it is marked \'Private--only\r\nfor Julius,\' so I could say nothing about it before your mother.  I\r\nhave hardly glanced at it myself as yet, but I think he says Mr.\r\nDouglas made him promise not to tell her or Joanna Bowater."\r\n\r\n"Not tell Jenny!" cried Rosamond.  "And you said it was not bad.  He\r\nmust have gone and married!"\r\n\r\n"I do not think that is it," said Anne; "but you shall hear.  Miles\r\nsays:--\'I have at last seen our poor Cousin Archie.  I told you I\r\nwas following up your brother Sandie\'s hint about the agents for the\r\nhunters; and at last I fell in with a merchant, who, on my inquiry,\r\nshowed me an invoice that I could have sworn to as in Archie\'s hand,\r\nand described his white hair.  It seems he has been acting as\r\nmanager on an ostrich farm for the last three years, far up the\r\ncountry.  So I lost no time in sending up a note to him, telling\r\nhim, if he had not forgotten old times, to come down and see me\r\nwhile I was lying off Durban Bay.  I heard no more for ten days, and\r\nhad got in the stores and was to sail the next day, thinking he had\r\ngiven us all up, when a boat hailed us just come over the bar.  I\r\nsaw Archie\'s white head, and in ten minutes I had him on deck.  \'For\r\nHeaven\'s sake--am I cleared, Miles?\' was the first thing he said;\r\nand when I could not say that he was, it went to my heart to see how\r\nthe eager look sank away, and he was like a worn-down man of fifty.\r\nPoor fellow, I found he had ridden two hundred miles, with the hope\r\nthat I had brought him news that his innocence was proved, and the\r\nrevulsion was almost more than he could bear.  You see, he had no\r\nnotion that we thought him dead, and so he took the entire absence\r\nof any effort to trace him as acquiescence in his guilt; and when he\r\nfound out how it was, he laid me under the strongest injunctions to\r\ndisclose to no one that he is living--not that he fears any results,\r\nbut that he says it would only disturb every one and make them\r\nwretched--"\r\n\r\n"He must have gone and married.  The wretch!" broke in Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"No, oh no!" cried Anne.  "Only hear the rest.  \'I told him that I\r\ncould not see that at all, and that there was a very warm and tender\r\nremembrance of him among us all, and he nearly broke down and said,\r\n\'For Heaven\'s sake then, Miles, let them rest in that!  There\'s more\r\npeace for them so.\'  I suppose I looked--I am sure I did not speak--\r\nas though I were a little staggered as to whether he were ashamed to\r\nbe known; for he drew himself up in the old way I should have known\r\nanywhere, and told me there was no reason I should fear to shake\r\nhands with him; however his name might be blasted at home, he had\r\ndone nothing to make himself unworthy of his mother and Jenny--and\r\nthere was a sob again.  So I let him know that up to my last letters\r\nfrom home Jenny was unmarried.  I even remembered those descriptive\r\nwords of yours, Nannie, \'living in patient peacefulness and\r\ncheerfulness on his memory.\'"\r\n\r\n"I was called on deck just then, so I gave him my home photograph-\r\nbook, and left him with it.  I found him crying like a child over it\r\nwhen I came back; I was obliged to strip it of all my best for him,\r\nfor I could not move him.  We went through the whole of the old\r\nstory, to see if there were any hope; and when he found that Tom\r\nVivian was dead, and George Proudfoot too, without a word about him,\r\nhe seemed to think it hopeless.  He believes that Proudfoot at\r\nleast, if not Moy, was deeply in debt to Vivian, though not to that\r\nextent, and that Vivian probably incited them to \'borrow\' from my\r\nmother\'s letter.  He was very likely to undertake to get the draft\r\ncashed for them, and not to account for the difference.  It may have\r\nhelped to hasten his catastrophe.  Moy I never should have\r\nsuspected; Archie says he should once have done so as little; but he\r\nwas a plausible fellow, and would do things on the sly, while all\r\nalong appearing to old Proudfoot as a mentor to George.  Archie\r\nseemed to feel his prosperity the bitterest pill of all--reigning\r\nlike one of the squirearchy at Proudfoot Lawn--a magistrate\r\nforsooth, with his daughter figuring as an heiress.  One thing worth\r\nnote--Archie says, that when it was too late, he remembered that the\r\nunder-clerk, Gadley, might not have gone home, and might have heard\r\nhim explain that the letter had turned up.\'"\r\n\r\n"Gadley?  Why that\'s the landlord of the \'Three Pigeons!\'" exclaimed\r\nRosamond.  "It is Mr. Moy\'s house, and he supports him through thick\r\nand thin."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Julius, "the magistrates have been on the point of\r\ntaking away his license, but Moy always stands up for him.  There is\r\nsomething suspicious in that."\r\n\r\n"I heard Miss Moy, with my own ears, tell Mrs. Duncombe that he was\r\nthe apple of her father\'s eye," cried Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"He\'s bribed! he\'s bribed!  Oh, I see it all.  Well, go on, Anne.\r\nIf Archie isn\'t at home before he is a year older--"\r\n\r\nAnne went on.  "\'He allowed that he would have done more wisely in\r\nfacing it out and standing his trial; but he said, poor fellow, that\r\nhe felt as if the earth had given way under him.  There was not a\r\nsoul near who believed him; they brought his father\'s history\r\nagainst him, and moreover he had been at the races, and had been\r\nbetting, though in fact he had won, and not lost, and the 201. he\r\nhad become possessed of was his capital, besides the little he could\r\ndraw out of the bank\r\n\r\n"\'If he could only have seen Jenny in London she would have turned\r\nhim back.  Indeed, that first stage was to consult her, but he\r\nfancied he saw the face of the Wil\'sbro\' Superintendent in a cab,\r\nand the instinct of avoiding arrest carried him to Southampton,\r\nwhere he got a steerage berth in a sailing vessel, and came out to\r\nthe Cape.  He has lived hard enough, but his Scots blood has stood\r\nhim in good stead, and he has made something as an ivory-hunter, and\r\nnow has a partnership in an ostrich farm in the Amatongula country.\r\nStill he held to it that it was better he should continue dead to\r\nall here, since Mr. Bowater would never forgive him; and the\r\nknowledge of his existence would only hinder Jenny\'s happiness.  You\r\nshould have seen the struggle with which he said that!  He left me\r\nno choice, indeed; forbade a word to any one, until I suggested that\r\nI had a wife, and that my said wife and Julius had put me on the\r\nscent.  He was immensely struck to find that my sweet Nan came from\r\nGlen Fraser.  He said the evenings he spent there had done more to\r\nrenew his home-sickness, and made him half mad after the sight or\r\nsound of us, than anything else had done, and I got him to promise\r\nto come and see us when we are settled in the bush.  What should you\r\nsay to joining him in ostrich-hatching? or would it be ministering\r\ntoo much to the vanities of the world?  However, I\'ll do something\r\nto get him cleared, if it comes to an appeal to old Moy himself,\r\nwhen I come home.  Meantime, remember, you are not at liberty to\r\nspeak a word of this to any one but Julius, and, I suppose, his\r\nwife.  I hope--\'  There, Rose, I beg your pardon."\r\n\r\n"What does he hope?" asked Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"He only hopes she is a cautious woman."\r\n\r\n"As cautious as his Nan, eh?  Ah, Anne! you\'re a canny Scot, and\r\nmaybe think holding your tongue as fine a thing as this Archie does;\r\nbut I can\'t bear it.  I think it is shocking, just wearing out the\r\nheart of the best and sweetest girl in the world."\r\n\r\n"At any rate," said Julius, "we must be silent.  We have no right to\r\nspeak, however we may feel."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t expect it will stay a secret, or that he\'ll go and pluck\r\nostriches like geese, with Miles and Anne, and nobody know it?\r\n\'Twould be taking example by their ostriches, indeed!"\r\n\r\n"I think so," said Julius, laughing; "but as it stands now, silence\r\nis our duty by both Miles and Archie, and Anne herself.  We must not\r\nmake her repent having told us."\r\n\r\n"It\'s lucky I\'m not likely to fall in with Jenny just yet," said\r\nRosamond.  "Don\'t leave me alone with her, either of you; if you do,\r\nit is at your peril.  It is all very well to talk of honour and\r\nsecrets, but to see the look in her eyes, and know he is alive,\r\nseems to me rank cruelty and heartlessness.  It is all to let Miles\r\nhave the pleasure of telling when he comes home."\r\n\r\n"Miles is not a woman, nor an Irishwoman," said Julius.\r\n\r\n"But he\'s a sailor, and he\'s got a feeling heart," said Rosamond;\r\n"and if he stands one look of Jenny, why, I\'ll disown him for the\r\nbrother-in-law I take him for.  By the bye, is not Raymond to know?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Anne; "here is a postscript forbidding my telling him or\r\nMrs. Poynsett."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!  And I suppose Herbert knows nothing?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing.  He was a boy at school at the time.  Say nothing to him,\r\nRose."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; besides, his brain is all run to cricket."\r\n\r\nIt was but too true.  When the sun shone bright in April, and the\r\nwickets were set up, Herbert had demonstrated that his influence was\r\na necessity on the village green; and it was true that his goodly\r\nand animated presence was as useful morally to the eleven as it was\r\nconducive to their triumphs; so his Rector suppressed a few sighs at\r\nthe frequency of the practices and the endless matches.  Compton had\r\nplayed Wil\'sbro\' and Strawyers, Duddingstone and Woodbury; the choir\r\nhad played the school, the single the married; and when hay and\r\nharvest absorbed the rustic eleven, challenges began among their\r\nbetters.  The officers played the county--Oxonians, Cantabs--\r\nEtonians, Harrovians--and wherever a match was proclaimed, that\r\nprime bowler, the Reverend Herbert Bowater, was claimed as the\r\nindispensable champion of his cause and country.\r\n\r\nIf his sister had any power to moderate his zeal, she had had little\r\nchance of exercising it; for Mrs. Bowater had had a rheumatic fever\r\nin March, and continued so much of an invalid all the summer that\r\nJenny seldom went far from home, only saw her brother on his weekly\r\nvisits to the sick-room, and was, as Rosamond said, unlikely to\r\nbecome a temptation to the warm heart and eager tongue.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe week-day congregation were surprised one August morning at eight\r\no\'clock by the entrance of three ladies in the most recent style of\r\nfashionable simplicity, and making the most demonstrative tokens of\r\nreverence.  As the Rector came out he was seized upon at once by the\r\nelder lady.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Charnock!  I must introduce myself; I knew your dear mother so\r\nwell when we were both girls.  I am so delighted to find such a\r\nchurch--quite an oasis; and I want to ascertain the best hour for\r\ncalling on her.  Quite an invalid--I was so shocked to hear it.\r\nWill the afternoon suit her?  I am only here for three days to\r\ndeposit these two girls, while I take the other on a round of\r\nvisits.  Three daughters are too great an affliction for one\'s\r\nfriends, and Bee and Conny are so delighted to be near their brother\r\nand with dear Lena Vivian, that I am very glad above all, since I\r\nfind there are real church privileges--so different from the Vicar\r\nof Wil\'sbro\'.  Poor man; he is a great trial."\r\n\r\nAll this was said between the church and the lych-gate, and almost\r\ntook Julius\'s breath away; but Mrs. Poynsett was prepared to welcome\r\nher old friend with some warmth and more curiosity.\r\n\r\nLady Susan Strangeways was a high-bred woman, but even high breeding\r\ncould not prevent her from being overwhelming, especially as there\r\nwas a great deal more of her than there had been at the last meeting\r\nof the friends, so that she was suggestive of Hawthorne\'s inquiry,\r\nwhether a man is bound to so many more pounds of flesh than he\r\noriginally wedded.  However, it was prime condition, and activity\r\nwas not impeded, but rather received impetus.  She had already,\r\nsince her matutinal walk of more than a mile and back, overhauled\r\nthe stores for the bazaar, inspected the town-hall, given her\r\nadvice, walked through the ruins for the church, expressed herself\r\nstrongly on the horrors of the plan, and begun to organize shilling\r\ncards, all before Sir Harry had emerged from his room.\r\n\r\nShe was most warm-hearted and good-natured, and tears glistened in\r\nher honest gray eyes as she saw her old friend\'s helpless state.\r\n"You don\'t know how much I have improved," said Mrs. Poynsett; "I\r\nfeel quite at liberty in this chair, all owing to my good daughters-\r\nin-law."\r\n\r\n"Ah!  I have so pitied you for having no girls!  My dear daughters\r\nhave been so entirely one with me--such a blessing in all I have\r\ngone through."\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett of course declared her complete comfort in her five\r\nsons, but Lady Susan was sure that if she had had as many boys,\r\ninstead of one son and four daughters, she should have been worn\r\nout.  Lorimer was a dear, affectionate fellow.  Those he loved could\r\nguide him with a leash of gossamer, but young men in his position\r\nwere exposed to so many temptations!  There ensued a little sighing\r\nover the evils of wealth; and to see and hear the two ladies, no one\r\nwould have thought that Julia Poynsett had married a young man for\r\nlove--Susan Lorimer an old man for independence.\r\n\r\nPossibly with her present principles she would not have done so; but\r\nthrough the vista of a long and prosperous widowhood deficiencies in\r\nthe courtship were easily forgotten; and perhaps there was the more\r\nromance and sentiment now because she had been balked of it in her\r\nyouth.  She had freely allowed her eldest daughter to enter a\r\nsisterhood from the purest, most unselfish motives, but there was\r\ncompensation in talking of her Margaret as a Sister of Mercy.\r\n\r\nAnd ere long she was anxiously inquiring Mrs. Poynsett\'s opinion of\r\nEleonora Vivian, and making confidences somewhat trying to the\r\nmother of the young lady\'s ardent lover.\r\n\r\nShe was quite aware that as to fortune there could hardly be a worse\r\nmatch than Miss Vivian; but she was sensible enough to see that her\r\nson had a sufficiency, and generous enough to like the idea of\r\nredeeming the old estate.  Her husband had spent his latter years in\r\na vain search for a faultless property, and his wealth was waiting\r\nfor Lorimer\'s settling down.  She had always regretted the having no\r\nvassals rightfully her own, and had felt the disadvantages of being\r\nLady Bountiful only by tenant right.  To save an old estate from\r\nentirely passing out of a family, and relieve \'a noble old wreck,\'\r\nlike Sir Harry, seemed to her so grand a prospect that she could not\r\nbut cast a little glamour over the manner of the shipwreck.  Still,\r\nto do her justice, her primary consideration was the blessing such a\r\nwoman as Lenore might be to her son.\r\n\r\nShe had not fathomed Lady Tyrrell.  No woman could do so without\r\nknowing her antecedents, but she understood enough to perceive that\r\nEleonora was not happy with her, and this she attributed to the\r\ngirl\'s deep nature and religious aspirations.  Rockpier was an\r\necclesiastical paradise to Lady Susan, and a close bond with Lenore,\r\nto whom in London she had given all the facilities that lay in her\r\npower for persevering in the observances that were alien to the gay\r\nhousehold at home.  She valued this constancy exceedingly, and\r\nenthusiastically dilated on the young lady\'s goodness, and\r\nindifference to the sensation she had created.  "Lorimer allows he\r\nnever saw her equal for grace and dignity."\r\n\r\nAllows!  Fancy Frank _allowing_ any perfection in his Lenore!  Was\r\nit not possible that a little passing encomium on unusual beauty was\r\nbeing promoted and magnified by the mother into a serious\r\nattachment?  But Lady Tyrrell was playing into her hands, and\r\nLenore\'s ecclesiastical proclivities were throwing her into the arms\r\nof the family!\r\n\r\nIt hardly seemed fair to feign sympathy, yet any adverse hint would\r\nbe treason, and Mrs. Poynsett only asked innocently whether her\r\nfriend had seen her son Frank.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, often; the handsomest of all your sons, is he not?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he is _now_."\r\n\r\n"My girls rave about his beautiful brown eyes, just as you used to\r\ndo, Julia, five-and-thirty years ago."\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett was sure that whatever she had thought of Miles\r\nCharnock\'s eyes five-and-thirty years ago, she had never raved about\r\nthem to Susan Lorimer, but she only said, "All my boys are like\r\ntheir father except Charlie."\r\n\r\n"But Master Frank has no eyes for any one but Miss Vivian.  Oh yes,\r\nI see the little jealousies; I am sorry for him; but you see it\r\nwould be a shocking bad thing for a younger son like him; whereas\r\nLory could afford it, and it would be the making of him."\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett held her peace, and was not sorry that her visitor was\r\ncalled away while she was still deliberating whether to give a hint\r\nof the state of the case.\r\n\r\nLady Susan was, however, more aware of it than she knew; Lady\r\nTyrrell had \'candidly\' given her a hint that there had been \'some\r\nnonsense about Frank Charnock,\' but that he could never afford such\r\na marriage, even if his mother would allow it, all which she never\r\nwould.  Besides, he had not fallen into a satisfactory set in\r\nLondon--why, it was not needful to tell.\r\n\r\nWhen, after the drive, Lady Tyrrell, fairly tired out by her\r\nvisitor\'s unfailing conversation and superabundant energy, had gone\r\nto lie down and recruit for the evening, Lady Susan pressed on\r\nEleonora a warm invitation to the house in Yorkshire which she was\r\nrenting, and where Lorimer would get as much shooting as his colonel\r\nwould permit.  The mention of him made Lenore blush to the ears, and\r\nsay, "Dear Lady Susan, you are always so kind to me that I ought to\r\nbe open with you.  Don\'t fancy--"\r\n\r\n"I understand, I understand, my dear," broke in Lady Susan.  "You\r\nshall not be teased.  Do not the girls and I care for you for your\r\nown sake?"\r\n\r\n"I hope so."\r\n\r\nThe elder lady sprang up and embraced her.  Affection was very\r\npleasant to the reserved nature that could do so little to evoke\r\ncaresses.  Yet Eleonora clasped her Rockpier charm in her hand, and\r\nadded, "I must tell you that so far as I can without disobedience, I\r\nhold myself engaged to Frank Charnock."\r\n\r\n"To Frank Charnock?" repeated Lady Susan, startled at this positive\r\nstatement.  "My dear, are you quite sure of his ways?--since he has\r\nbeen in town I mean."\r\n\r\n"I know him, and I trust him."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure he is a fine-looking young man, and very clever, they say;\r\ndear Julia Poynsett\'s son too, and they have all turned out so\r\nwell," said honest Lady Susan; "but though you have been used to it\r\nall your life, my dear, a taste for horses is very dangerous in a\r\nyoung man who can\'t afford to lose now and then, you know."\r\n\r\n"I have seriously made up my mind never to marry a man who has\r\nanything to do with the turf," said Eleonora.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my poor dear, I can understand that," said Lady Susan, aware\r\nhow ill this told for her Lory.  "May I ask, does he know it?"\r\n\r\n"It would insult him to say it.  None of the Charnocks ever meddle\r\nwith those things.  Ah! I know your son saw him on the Derby-day;\r\nbut he went down with his eldest brother and his wife--and _that_ is\r\na very different thing!  I stayed at home, you remember--papa had a\r\nfit of the gout."\r\n\r\n"My dear, I don\'t want to accuse him.  Don\'t bristle up; only I am\r\nsorry, both for my own little plan of having you for my _very_ own,\r\nand because I fear there is trouble in store for you.  It can\'t be\r\npalatable."  Here Eleonora shook her head, and her worn, wearied\r\nlook went to the good-natured heart.  "Dear child, you have gone\r\nthrough a great deal.  You shan\'t be worried or fretted about\r\nanybody or anything at Revelrig."\r\n\r\n"I should be very glad," said Lenore, who had no fears of Lory\r\npersonally, though she could not be invited on false pretences.\r\n\r\n"You had better come when Bee and Conny meet me.  Let me see--will\r\nthe retreat be over by that time?  Are you going to it?  You are an\r\nassociate of St. Faith."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I don\'t see how I could go to the retreat.  Oh, what a\r\nrelief it would be to have such a week!"\r\n\r\n"Exactly what I feel," said Lady Susan, somewhat to her surprise.\r\n"It strengthens and sets me right for the year.  Dr. Easterby\r\nconducts this one.  Do you not know him?  Is not Rood House near\r\nBacksworth?"\r\n\r\n"Yes on the other side, but he is utterly out of my reach.  Julius\r\nCharnock looks up to him so much; but his name--even more than St.\r\nFaith\'s--would horrify my father."\r\n\r\n"You could not go direct there," said Lady Susan; "but when once you\r\nare with me you are my charge, and I could take you."\r\n\r\nShe considered a little.  Both she and her friend knew that all her\r\nreligious habits were alien to Sir Harry, and that what he had\r\nfreely permitted, sometimes shared at Rockpier, was now only winked\r\nat, and that if he had guessed the full extent of her observances he\r\nwould have stormily issued a prohibition.  Could it be wrong to\r\nspend part of her visit to Lady Susan with her hostess in a\r\nsisterhood, when she had no doubt as to attending services which he\r\nabsolutely never dreamt of, and therefore did not forbid?  The\r\nsacred atmosphere and holy meditations, without external strife and\r\nconstant watchfulness, seemed to the poor girl like water to the\r\nthirsty; and she thought, after all the harass and whirl of the\r\nbazaar and race week, she might thus recruit her much-needed\r\nstrength for the decisive conflicts her majority would bring.\r\n\r\nLady Susan had no doubts.  The \'grand old wreck\' was in his present\r\naspect a hoary old persecutor, and charming Lady Tyrrell a worldly,\r\nscheming elder sister.  It was as much an act of charity to give\r\ntheir victim an opportunity of devotion and support as if she had\r\nbeen the child of abandoned parents in a back court in East London.\r\nReserve to prevent a prohibition was not in such cases treachery or\r\ndisobedience; and she felt herself doing a mother\'s part, as she\r\ntold her daughters, with some enjoyment of the mystery.  Eleonora\r\nmade no promise, hoping to clear her mind by consideration, or to\r\nget Julius\'s opinion.  He and his wife dined at Sirenwood, and found\r\nJoe Reynolds\'s drawings laid out for inspection, while Lady Susan\r\nwas advising that, instead of selling them, there should be an\r\nindustrial exhibition of all curiosities of art and nature to be\r\ncollected in the neighbourhood, and promising her own set of foreign\r\nphotographs and coloured costumes, which had served such purposes\r\nmany and many a time.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the good dame tried to talk to Rosamond on what she\r\ndeemed the most congenial subjects; but my Lady Rose had no notion\r\nof \'shop\' at a dinner-party, so she made languid answer that she\r\n\'left all that to the curates,\' and escaped to a frivolous young\r\nmatron on the other side of the room, looking on while her husband\r\nwas penned in and examined on his services, and his choir, and his\r\nsystem, and his decorations, and his classes, and his schools, for\r\nall or any of which Lady Susan pressed on him the aid of the two\r\ndaughters she was leaving at Sirenwood; and on his hint that this\r\nwas beyond his parish, she repeated her strong disapproval of the\r\nVicar of Wil\'sbro\', whom she had met at dinner the night before, and\r\nbesides, the school there had numerous Sunday teachers.\r\n\r\nJulius assented, for he had no redundance of the article, and his\r\nsenior curate had just started on a vacation ramble with a brother;\r\nbut a sort of misgiving crossed him as he heard Herbert Bowater\'s\r\nlast comic song pealing out, and beheld the pleasingly plain face of\r\na Miss Strangeways on either side of him.  Had he not fought the\r\nEton and Harrow match over again with one of them at dinner? and had\r\nnot a lawn tennis challenge already passed?\r\n\r\nFor Lady Tyrrell and Mrs. Charnock Poynsett were to have garden-\r\nparties on alternate Wednesdays, and the whole neighbourhood soon\r\nfollowed suit.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find nobody at home, Jenny," said Julius, coming out of a\r\ncottage opposite, as she rode up to Mrs. Hornblower\'s, on one of the\r\nlast days of August.  "Nobody--that is, but my mother.  Can you come\r\nup and see her?"\r\n\r\n"With all my heart; but I must get down here; I\'m sent for one of\r\nHerbert\'s shirts.  The good boy lets mamma and aunty manage them\r\nstill!  I believe their hearts would break outright if he took to\r\nshop ones, like the rest of them.  Hush, Tartar, for shame! don\'t\r\nyou know me?  Where\'s your master?"\r\n\r\n"At a garden-party at Duddingstone.  Your mother is better, I see."\r\n\r\n"Yes, thank you--out driving with papa.  Good Rollo!" as the\r\ndignified animal rose from the hearthrug to greet her, waving his\r\nhandsome tail, and calmly expelled a large tabby cat from the easy-\r\nchair, to make room for his friends.  "Well done, old Roll!  Fancy a\r\ncat in such company."\r\n\r\n"Herbert\'s dogs partake his good-nature."\r\n\r\n"Mungo seems to be absent too."\r\n\r\n"Gone with him no doubt.  He is the great favourite with one of the\r\nMiss Strangeways."\r\n\r\n"Which--Herbert or Mungo?"\r\n\r\n"Both!  I might say, I know the young ladies best by one being\r\nrapturous about Tartar and the other about Mungo.  Rollo treats both\r\nwith equally sublime and indifferent politeness, rather as Raymond\r\ndoes."\r\n\r\n"What sort of girls are they?  Herbert calls them \'awfully jolly.\'"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to say I never can think of any other epithet for them.\r\nFor once it is really descriptive."\r\n\r\n"Is it either of them in particular?"\r\n\r\n"Confess, Joan, that\'s what brought you over."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so.  Edith heard some nonsense at Backsworth, and mamma\r\ncould not rest till she had sent me over to see about it; but would\r\nthere be any great harm in it if it were true?  Is not Lady Susan a\r\nsuper-excellent woman?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve hit it again, Jenny.  Couple the two descriptions."\r\n\r\n"I gather that you don\'t think the danger great."\r\n\r\n"Not at present.  The fascination is dual, and is at least a\r\ncounteraction to the great enchantress."\r\n\r\n"That _is_ well!  It was not wholesome!"\r\n\r\n"Whereas, these two are hearty, honest, well-principled girls, quite\r\ngenuine."\r\n\r\n"Yet you don\'t say it with all your heart."\r\n\r\n"I own I should like to find something they had left undone."\r\n\r\n"What, to reduce them to human nature\'s daily food?"\r\n\r\n"Daily indeed!  There\'s just no escaping them.  There they are at\r\nmatins and evensong."\r\n\r\n"How shocking!  What, gossip afterwards?"\r\n\r\n"Ask Rollo whether Mungo and Tartar don\'t stand at the lych-gate,\r\nand if he finds it easy to put an end to the game at play."\r\n\r\n"Oh! and he said they never missed a Sunday service, or the school.\r\nDo they distract him?"\r\n\r\n"Whom would it not distract to see two figures walking in with\r\nhunches on their backs like camels, and high-heeled shoes, and hats\r\non the back of their heads, and chains and things clattering all\r\nover them?"\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t they lady-like?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! they are quite that.  Rose says it is all the pink of fashion--\r\nonly coming it strong--I declare they are infectious!"\r\n\r\n"I believe so.  I never heard so many nibbles at slang from any of\r\nyou five, as from the Rector of Compton in the last five minutes.  I\r\ngather that he is slightly bothered."\r\n\r\n"There\'s so much of it.  We are forced to have them to all the meals\r\non Sunday, and their lectures on functions have nearly scared poor\r\nAnne to the Pilgrim level again.  They have set upon me to get up a\r\nchoir-concert and a harvest-feast; but happily no one has time for\r\nthe first at this season, and as to the other, I doubted whether to\r\nmake this first start after such a rainy summer, and they decide me\r\nagainst it.  To have them decorating the church!"\r\n\r\n"Awfully jolly," suggested Jenny.\r\n\r\n"Even so.  They are, if you understand me, technically reverent;\r\nthey have startled the whole place with their curtsies and crossings\r\nin church; but they gabble up to the very porch; and the familiarity\r\nwith which they discuss High Mass, as they are pleased to call it!\r\nI was obliged to silence them, and I must say they took it nicely."\r\n\r\n"How do they suit Lena?"\r\n\r\n"She likes them.  Lady Susan was a great help to her in London, and\r\nshe feels the comfort of their honesty.  They brought her to church\r\nwith them one or two mornings, but it knocked her up to walk so\r\nearly.  Insensibly, I think they do Lady Tyrrell\'s work in shutting\r\nher up from any of us."\r\n\r\n"Spite of croquet, which seems perpetual."\r\n\r\n"Chronic and sporadic parties make it so.  There are few days\r\nwithout that or something else.  Cricket or the band at the\r\nbarracks."\r\n\r\n"People say the neighbourhood has never been so gay since Camilla\r\nVivian\'s marriage.  I sometimes wonder whether anything can be going\r\nto happen," said Jenny with a sigh, not guessing at what Julius was\r\nthinking of; then changing her tone:  "Surely Herbert does not go to\r\nit all, and leave you alone?  O, Julius! you should not let him."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Jenny, there\'s no more work now in the holidays than I\r\nam sufficient for; and for him, it is quite as guileless play as\r\never he had twenty years ago.  It will soon be over, or I should\r\ntake it more seriously."\r\n\r\n"But it is at such a time!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is the worst of it.  I have thought it over; but while he\r\nis in this mood, the making him feel victimized and interfered with\r\nhas a worse effect than the letting him have his swing."\r\n\r\n"What is he doing now, I wonder?  Here\'s his sermon-paper on the\r\ntable, and a Greek Testament, and Hints on Decorating Churches, with\r\n\'Constance Strangeways\' on the first leaf--no other book.  How long\r\nwill this saturnalia last?"\r\n\r\n"Up to the Ordination, I fear.  You know the good people have\r\ncontrived to put bazaar, races, and ball, all into the Ember Week,\r\nand they are the great object of the young ladies\' visit.  Could you\r\nhave him home for a quiet week first?"\r\n\r\n"It would not be a quiet week; Edith is in the way of most of these\r\naffairs; besides, to open fire about these young ladies might just\r\nbe putting nonsense into an innocent head.  Now, I\'ve not seen your\r\nRectory!"\r\n\r\nThe said Rectory was in a decided state of fresh, not to say raw,\r\nnovelty outside, though the old trees and garden a little softened\r\nits hard grays and strong reds; but it promised to look well when\r\ncrumbling and weather-stain had done their work.  At the door they\r\nmet the pretty young nurse, with a delicate sea-green embroidered\r\ncashmere bundle in her arms.\r\n\r\n"Little Lady Green Mantle," exclaimed Jenny.\r\n\r\n"Erin-go-bragh," said Julius.  "Rose clung to her colours in spite\r\nof all predictions about \'the good people.\'  Asleep of course," as\r\nJenny took her and uncovered her face.  "She won\'t exhibit her eyes,\r\nbut they are quite _proper_ coloured."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I see she is like Raymond!"\r\n\r\n"Do you?  They all say she is a perfect Charnock, though how they\r\nknow I can\'t guess.  There," after a little more baby-worship, "you\r\nmay take her Emma."\r\n\r\n"Is that the under-nurse?" asked Jenny, rather surprised by her\r\njuvenility.\r\n\r\n"The sole one.  My mother and Susan are rather concerned, but Rose\r\nasserts that experience in that department is always associated with\r\ngin; and she fell in love with this girl--a daughter of John\r\nGadley\'s, who is much more respectable than he of the \'Three\r\nPigeons.\'  I suppose it is not in the nature of things for two women\r\nto have the same view of nursery matters, unless one have brought up\r\nthe other."\r\n\r\n"Or even if she have.  Witness mamma\'s sighs over Mary\'s nurses."\r\n\r\n"I thought it was the common lot.  You\'ve not seen the dining-room."\r\nAnd the full honours were done.  They were pleasant rooms, still\r\nunpapered, and the furniture chiefly of amber-coloured varnished\r\ndeal; the drawing-room, chiefly with green furniture, with only a\r\nfew brighter dashes here and there, and a sociable amount of\r\ncomfortable litter already.  The study was full of new shelves and\r\nold books, and across the window-sill lay a gray figure, with a book\r\nand a sheet of paper.\r\n\r\n"You here, Terry!  I thought you were gone with Rose," said Julius,\r\nas the boy rose to greet Miss Bowater.\r\n\r\n"She said I need not, and I hate those garden-parties," said Terry;\r\nand they relieved him of their presence as soon as Jenny had paid\r\nher respects to the favourite prints and photographs on the walls.\r\n\r\n"He has a passion for the history of Poland just now," said Julius.\r\n"Sobieski is better company than he would meet at Duddingstone, I\r\nsuspect--poor fellow!  Lord Rathforlane has been so much excited by\r\nhearing of Driver\'s successes as a coach, as to desire Terry to read\r\nwith him for the Royal Engineers.  The boys must get off his hands\r\nas soon as possible, he says, and Terry, being cleverest, must do so\r\nsoonest; but the boy has seen the dullest side of soldiering, and\r\nhates it.  His whole soul is set on scholarship.  I am afraid it is\r\na great mistake."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you persuade him?"\r\n\r\n"We have both written; but Rose has no great hopes of the result.  I\r\nwish he could follow his bent."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Jenny, lingering as she looked towards Church-house,\r\n"the young instinct ought not to be repressed."\r\n\r\nJulius knew that she was recollecting how Archie Douglas had\r\nentreated to go to sea, and the desire had been quashed because he\r\nwas an only son.  His inclination to speak was as perilous as if he\r\nhad been Rosamond herself, and he did not feel it unfortunate that\r\nJenny found she must no longer stay away from home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\nTimes Out of Joint\r\n\r\n\r\nAlte der Meere,\r\nKomm und hore;\r\nMeine Frau, die Ilsebill,\r\nWill nicht als ich will!\r\n\r\nLife at Compton Poynsett was different from what it had been when\r\nthe two youngest sons had been at home, and Julius and Rosamond in\r\nthe house.  The family circle had grown much more stiff and quiet,\r\nand the chief difference caused by Mrs. Poynsett\'s presence was that\r\nRaymond was deprived of his refuge in her room.  Cecil had taken a\r\nline of polite contempt.  There was always a certain languid amount\r\nof indifferent conversation, \'from the teeth outward,\' as Rosamond\r\nsaid.  Every home engagement was submitted to the elder lady with\r\nelaborate scrupulousness, almost like irony.  Visitors in the house\r\nor invitations out of it, were welcome breaks, and the whirl of\r\nsociety which vaguely alarmed Joanna Bowater was a relief to the\r\ninhabitants of the Hall.\r\n\r\nAnne\'s companionship was not lively for her mother-in-law, but she\r\nwas brightening in the near prospect of Miles\'s return, and they had\r\nestablished habits that carried them well through the evening.  Anne\r\ncovered screens and made scrap-books, and did other work for the\r\nbazaar; and Mrs. Poynsett cut out pictures, made suggestions, and\r\nhad associations of her own with the combinations of which Anne had\r\nlittle notion.  Or she dictated letters which Anne wrote, and\r\nthrough all these was a kindly, peaceful spirit, most unlike the\r\ndreary alienation in which Cecil persevered.\r\n\r\nTo Cecil this seemed the anxious desire for her lawful rights.  She\r\nhad been used to spend the greater part of the evening at the piano,\r\nbut her awakened eyes perceived that this was a cover to Raymond\'s\r\nconversations at his mother\'s sofa; so she sat tying knots in stiff\r\nthread at her macrame lace pillow, making the bazaar a plea for\r\nnothing but work.  Raymond used to arm himself with the newspapers\r\nas the safest point d\'appui, and the talk was happiest when it\r\n_only_ languished, for it could do much worse.\r\n\r\n"Shall you be at Sirenwood to-morrow, Cecil?" asked Mrs. Poynsett,\r\nas she was wheeled to her station by the fire after dinner.  "Will\r\nyou kindly take charge of a little parcel for me?  One of the Miss\r\nStrangeways asked me to look for some old franks, so Anne and I have\r\nbeen turning out my drawers."\r\n\r\n"Are they for sale?" asked Raymond.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Cecil.  "Bee Strangeways is collecting; she will pay for\r\nall that are new to her, and sell any duplicates."\r\n\r\n"Has she many?" asked Mrs. Poynsett, glad of this safe subject.\r\n\r\n"Quantities; and very valuable ones.  Her grandfather knew\r\neverybody, and was in the Ministry."\r\n\r\n"Was he?" said Raymond, surprised.\r\n\r\n"Lord Lorimer?" said Mrs. Poynsett.  "Not when I knew them.  He was\r\nan old-fashioned Whig, with some peculiar crotchets, and never could\r\nwork with any Cabinet."\r\n\r\n"Beatrice told me he was," said Cecil, stiffly.\r\n\r\n"I rather think he was Master of the Buckhounds for a little while\r\nin the Grey Ministry," said Mrs. Poynsett, "but he gave it up\r\nbecause he would not vote with ministers on the poor laws."\r\n\r\n"I knew I was not mistaken in saying he was in the Ministry," said\r\nCecil.\r\n\r\n"The Master of the Buckhounds is not in the Cabinet, Cecil," said\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\n"I never said he was.  I said he was in office," returned the\r\ninfallible lady.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett thought it well to interrupt by handing in an envelope\r\nfranked by Sir Robert Peel; but Cecil at once declared that the\r\nwriting was different from that which Bee already owned.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it is not the same Sir Robert," said Mrs. Poynsett.\r\n\r\n"She got it from the Queen, and they are all authenticated.  The\r\nQueen newspaper, of course" (rather petulantly).\r\n\r\n"Indisputable," said Raymond; "but this frank contained a letter\r\nfrom the second Sir Robert to my father."\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett made a sign of acquiescence, and Cecil pouted in her\r\ndignified way, though Mrs. Poynsett tried to improve matters by\r\nsaying, "Then it appears that Miss Strangeways will have a series of\r\nPeel autographs, all in fact but the first generation."\r\n\r\nCommon sense showed she was right, but Cecil still felt\r\ndiscontented, for she knew she had been resisted and confuted, and\r\nshe believed it was all Mrs. Poynsett\'s doing instead of Raymond\'s.\r\n\r\nAnd she became as mute as Anne for the next half-hour, nor did\r\neither Raymond or his mother venture on starting any fresh topic,\r\nlest there might be fresh jarring.\r\n\r\nOnly Anne presently came up to Mrs. Poynsett and tenderly purred\r\nwith her over some little preparation for Miles.\r\n\r\nCertainly Anne was the most improved in looks of all the three\r\nbrides, who had arrived just a year ago.  The thin, scraggy Scotch\r\ngirl, with the flabby, washed-out look alternating with angular\r\nrigidity was gone, but the softening and opening of her expression,\r\nthe light that had come into her eyes, and had made them a lovely\r\nblue instead of pale gray; the rose-tint on her cheeks, the delicate\r\nrounded contour of her face, the improved carriage of her really\r\nfine figure, the traces of style in the braiding of her profuse\r\nflaxen hair, and the taste that was beginning to conquer in the\r\ndress, were all due to the thought that the Salamanca might soon be\r\nin harbour.  She sat among them still as a creature whose heart and\r\nspirit were not with them.\r\n\r\nThat some change must come was felt as inevitable by each woman, and\r\nit was Mrs. Poynsett who began, one forenoon when her son had\r\nbrought a lease for her to sign.  "Raymond," said she, "you know\r\nChurch-house is to be vacant at Michaelmas.  I wish you would look\r\nat it, and see what repairs it wants, and if the drawing-room\r\nwindows could be made to open on the lawn."\r\n\r\n"Are you hoping to tempt Miles to settle there?"\r\n\r\n"No, I fear there is no hope of that; but I do not think an old\r\nbroken-backed invalid ought to engross this great house."\r\n\r\n"Mother, I cannot hear you say so!  This is your own house!"\r\n\r\n"So is the other," she said, trying to smile, "and much fitter for\r\nmy needs, with Susan and Jenkins to look after me."\r\n\r\n"There is no fit place for you but this.  You said that once."\r\n\r\n"Under very different circumstances.  All the younger boys were\r\nstill under my wing, and needed the home, and I was strong and\r\nvigorous.  It would not have been acting right by them to have given\r\nup the place; but now they are all out in the world, and I am laid\r\nby, my stay here only interferes with what can be much better\r\nmanaged without me or my old servants."\r\n\r\n"I do not see that.  If any one moves, it should be ourselves."\r\n\r\n"You are wanted on the spot continually.  If Sirenwood were in the\r\nmarket, that might not be so much amiss."\r\n\r\n"I do not think that likely.  They will delay the sale in the hope\r\nof Eleonora\'s marrying a rich man; besides, Mr. Charnock has set his\r\nmind upon Swanslea.  I hope _this_ is from nothing Cecil has said or\r\ndone!"\r\n\r\n"Cecil wishes to part then?  She has said nothing to me, but I see\r\nshe has to you.  Don\'t be annoyed, Raymond; it is in the nature of\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"I believe it is all Lady Tyrrell\'s doing.  The mischief such a\r\nwoman can do in the neighbourhood!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it is only what any friend of Cecil would advise."\r\n\r\n"It is the very reverse of what I intended," said Raymond, shading\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n"My dear Raymond, I know what you meant, and what you wish; but I am\r\nalso certain it is for no one\'s happiness to go on in this way."\r\n\r\nHe groaned.\r\n\r\n"And the wife\'s right comes first."\r\n\r\n"Not to this house."\r\n\r\n"But to this man.  Indeed I see more hope of your happiness now than\r\nI did last year."\r\n\r\n"What, because she has delivered herself over bound hand and foot to\r\nCamilla Vivian?"\r\n\r\n"No, because she is altered.  Last year she was merely vexed at my\r\nposition in the house.  Now she is vexed at my position with you."\r\n\r\n"Very unjustly."\r\n\r\n"Hardly so.  I should not have liked your father to be so much\r\ndevoted to his mother.  Remember, jealousy is a smoke that cannot\r\nexist without some warmth."\r\n\r\n"If she had any proper feeling for me, she would show it by her\r\ntreatment of you."\r\n\r\n"That would be asking too much when she thinks I engross you."\r\n\r\n"Mother, while you show such marvellous candour and generosity, and\r\nshe--"\r\n\r\n"Hush!  Raymond, leave it unsaid!  We cannot expect her to see more\r\nthan her own side of the question.  She has been put into an\r\navowedly trying position, and does not deserve hard judgment for not\r\nbeing happy in it.  All that remains is to relieve her.  Whether by\r\nmy moving or yours is the question.  I prefer the Church-house\r\nplan."\r\n\r\n"Either way is shame and misery to me," broke out Raymond in a\r\nchoked voice.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," said his mother, trying to be cheerful.  "You made an\r\nimpracticable experiment, that\'s all.  Give Cecil free scope, let\r\nher feel that she has her due, and all will come right."\r\n\r\n"Nothing can be done till after the Wil\'sbro\' business," said\r\nRaymond, glad of the reprieve.  He could not bear the prospect of\r\nbanishment for his mother or himself from the home to which both\r\nwere rooted; and the sentence of detachment from her was especially\r\npainful when she seemed his only consolation for his wife\'s\r\nperverseness.  Yet he was aware that he had been guilty of the\r\noriginal error, and was bound to give such compensation to his wife\r\nas was offered by his mother\'s voluntary sacrifice.  He was slow to\r\nbroach the subject, but only the next morning came a question about\r\nan invitation to a dull house.\r\n\r\n"But," said Cecil, "it is better than home."  She spoke on purpose.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to hear you say so."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t call it home where I am but a guest."\r\n\r\n"Well, Cecil, my mother offers to leave the home of her life and\r\nretire into Church-house."\r\n\r\nCecil felt as if the screw she had been long working had come off in\r\nher hands.  She frowned, she gazed, collecting her senses, while\r\nRaymond added, "It is to my intense grief and mortification, but I\r\nsuppose you are gratified."\r\n\r\n"Uh, it would never do!" she exclaimed, to his surprise and\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n"Quite right," he returned.  "Just what I felt.  Nothing can make me\r\nso glad as to see that you think the idea as socking as I do."\r\n\r\n"Our going to Swanslea would be much better--far more natural, and\r\nno one could object.  We could refurnish, and make it perfect;\r\nwhereas nothing can be done to this place, so inconveniently built\r\nand buried in trees.  I should feel much freer in a place of my\r\nown."\r\n\r\n"So that is what you meant when I thought you were thinking of my\r\nmother?"\r\n\r\n"I am obliged to take thought for myself when you take heed to no\r\none but her," said Cecil; and as the carriage was at that moment\r\nannounced, she left him.  Which was the most sick at heart it would\r\nbe hard to say, the wife with the sense that she was postponed in\r\neverything to the mother, the husband at the alienation that had\r\nnever before been so fully expressed.  Cecil\'s errand was a council\r\nabout the bazaar; and driving round by Sirenwood, Lady Tyrrell\r\nbecame her companion in the carriage.  The quick eyes soon perceived\r\nthat something had taken place, and confidence was soon drawn forth.\r\n\r\n"The ice is broken; and by whom do you think?"\r\n\r\n"By la belle mere?  Skilful strategy to know when the position is\r\nnot tenable."\r\n\r\n"She wants to retreat to Church-house."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t consent to that."\r\n\r\n"I said I should prefer Swanslea for ourselves."\r\n\r\n"Hold to that, whatever you do.  If she moves to the village you\r\nwill have all the odium and none of the advantages.  There will be\r\nthe same daily haunt; and as to your freedom of action, there are no\r\nspies like the abdicated and their dependents.  A very clever plan,\r\nbut don\'t be led away by it."\r\n\r\n"No," said Cecil, resolutely; but after a moment:  "It would be\r\ninconvenient to Raymond to live so far away from the property."\r\n\r\n"Swanslea will be property too, and a ride over on business is not\r\nlike strolling in constantly."\r\n\r\n"I know I shall never feel like my own mistress in a house of hers."\r\n\r\n"Still less with her close by, with the Rectory family running in\r\nand out to exchange remarks.  No, no, hold fast to insisting that\r\nshe must not leave the ancestral halls.  That you can do dutifully\r\nand gracefully."\r\n\r\nCecil knew she had been betrayed into the contrary; but they were by\r\nthis time in the High Street, bowing to others of the committee on\r\ntheir way to the town-hall, a structure of parti-coloured brick in\r\nharlequin patterns, with a peaked roof, all over little sham domes,\r\nwhich went far to justify its title of the Rat-house, since nothing\r\nlarger could well use them.  The facade was thus somewhat imposing;\r\nof the rear the less said the better; and as to the interior, it was\r\nat present one expanse of dust, impeded by scaffold-poles, and all\r\nthe windows had large blotches of paint upon them.\r\n\r\nIt required a lively imagination to devise situations for the\r\nstalls; but Mrs. Duncombe valiantly tripped about, instructing her\r\nattendant carpenter with little assistance except from the well-\r\nexperienced Miss Strangeways.  The other ladies had enough to do in\r\nkeeping their plumage unsoiled.  Lady Tyrrell kept on a little\r\npeninsula of encaustic tile, Cecil hopped across bird-like and\r\nunsoiled, Miss Slater held her carmelite high and dry, but poor Miss\r\nFuller\'s pale blue and drab, trailing at every step, became\r\nconstantly more blended!\r\n\r\nThe dust induced thirst.  Lady Tyrrell lamented that the Wil\'sbro\'\r\nconfectioner was so far off and his ices doubtful, and Miss Slater\r\nsuggested that she had been making a temperance effort by setting up\r\nan excellent widow in the lane that opened opposite to them in a\r\nshop with raspberry vinegar, ginger-beer, and the like mild\r\ncompounds, and Mrs. Duncombe caught at the opportunity of exhibiting\r\nthe sparkling water of the well which supplied this same lane.  The\r\nwidow lived in one of the tenements which Pettitt had renovated\r\nunder her guidance, and on a loan advanced by Cecil, and she was\r\nproud of her work.\r\n\r\n"Clio Tallboys would view this as a triumph," said Mrs. Duncombe,\r\nas, standing on the steps of the town-hall, she surveyed the four\r\ntenements at the corner of the alley.  "Not a man would stir in the\r\nbusiness except Pettitt, who left it all to me."\r\n\r\n"Taking example by the Professor," said Lady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n"It is strange," said Miss Slater, "how much illness there has been\r\never since the people went into those houses.  They are in my\r\ndistrict, you know."\r\n\r\n"You should make them open their windows," said Mrs. Duncombe.\r\n\r\n"They lay it on the draughts."\r\n\r\n"And stuff up my ventilators.  That is always the way they begin."\r\n\r\nThe excellent widow herself had a bad finger, which was a great\r\nimpediment in administering the cooling beverages, but these were so\r\nexcellent as to suggest the furnishing of a stall therewith for the\r\nthirsty, as something sure to be popular and at small expense.\r\nTherewith the committee broke up, all having been present but Miss\r\nMoy, whose absence was not regretted, though apologized for by Mrs.\r\nDuncombe.  "I could not get her away from the stables," she said.\r\n"She and Bob would contemplate Dark Hag day and night, I believe."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t allow it," said Lady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\nMrs. Duncombe shrugged her shoulders and laughed.  "That\'s Mr. Moy\'s\r\nlook-out," she said.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t choose to interfere with her emancipation," said Lady\r\nTyrrell.\r\n\r\n"Clio would tell you she could take care of herself at the stables\r\nas well as anywhere else."\r\n\r\n"Query?" said Lady Tyrrell.  "Don\'t get into a scrape, Bessie.  Does\r\nyour Captain report on the flirtation with young Simmonds?"\r\n\r\n"Who is he?" asked Cecil\r\n\r\n"The trainer\'s son," said Bessie.  "It is only a bit of imitation of\r\nAurora Floyd."\r\n\r\n"You know she\'s an heiress," said Lady Tyrrell.  "You had better\r\ntake care how you put such a temptation in his way."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose the Moys are anybody," said Cecil.\r\n\r\n"Not in your sense, my dear," said Lady Tyrrell, laughing; "but from\r\nanother level there\'s a wide gap between the heiress of Proudfoot\r\nLawn and the heir of the training stables."\r\n\r\n"Cecil looks simply disgusted," said Bessie.  "She can\'t bear the\r\nMoys betwixt the wind and her nobility."\r\n\r\n"They are the great drawback to Swansea, I confess," said Cecil.\r\n\r\n"Oh! are you thinking of Swanslea?" cried Mrs Duncombe.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lady Tyrrell, "she is one to be congratulated on\r\nemancipation."\r\n\r\n"Well can I do so," said Mrs. Duncombe.  "Don\'t I know what mothers-\r\nin-law are?  Mine is the most wonderful old Goody, with exactly the\r\nnotions of your meek Mrs. Miles."\r\n\r\n"Incompatibility decidedly," said Lady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n"Only she was the Spartan mother combined with it," continued Mrs.\r\nDuncombe.  "When Bob was a little urchin, he once, in anticipation\r\nof his future tastes, committed the enormity of riding on a stick on\r\nSunday; so she locked him up till he had learnt six verses of one of\r\nWatts\'s hymns about going to church being like a little heaven\r\nbelow, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Increasing his longing that way," said Lady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n"She doesn\'t even light the drawing-room fire on Sunday, for fear\r\npeople should not sit in their rooms and meditate," continued Mrs.\r\nDuncombe.  "Bob manages to be fond of her through all; but she\r\nregularly hates me."\r\n\r\n"Not very wonderful," said Lady Tyrrell, laughing.  "I suppose there\r\nis a charming reciprocity of feeling."\r\n\r\n"I think I can afford to pity her," said Mrs. Duncombe, lightly.\r\n"Just fancy what I must have been to her!  You know I was brought up\r\nin a convent at Paris.  The very bosom of the scarlet woman."\r\n\r\n"But," interrupted Cecil, "you were never a Roman Catholic, Bessie!"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no; the Protestant boarders were let entirely alone.\r\nThere were only two of us, and we lay in bed while the others went\r\nto mass, and played while they went to confession, that was all.  I\r\nwas an orphan; never remember my mother, and my father died abroad.\r\nLuckily for me, Bob was done for by my first ball.  Very odd he\r\nshould have liked a little red-haired thing like me; but every one\r\nis ticketed, I believe.  My uncle was glad enough to get rid of me,\r\nand poor old Mrs. Duncombe was unsuspecting till we went home--and\r\nthen!"\r\n\r\n"And then?"\r\n\r\n"Cecil may have some faint idea."\r\n\r\n"Of what you underwent?"\r\n\r\n"She wanted to begin on me as if I were a wild savage heathen, you\r\nknow!  I believe she nearly had a fit when I declined a prayer-\r\nmeeting, and as to my walking out with Bob on Sunday evening!"\r\n\r\n"Did she make you learn Watts\'s hymns?"\r\n\r\n"No! but she did what was much worse to poor Bob.  She told him she\r\nhad spent the time in prayer and humiliation, and the poor fellow\r\nvery nearly cried."\r\n\r\n"Ah, those mothers have such an advantage over their sons," said\r\nLady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n"I determined I would never go near her again after that," said Mrs.\r\nDuncombe.  "Bob goes; he is really fond of her; but I knew we should\r\nkeep the peace better apart.  I let her have the children now and\r\nthen, when it is convenient, and oddly enough they like it; but I\r\nshall soon have to stop that, for I won\'t have them think me a\r\nreprobate; and she has thought me ten times worse ever since I found\r\nout that I had brains and could use them."\r\n\r\n"Quite true," said Camilla; "there\'s no peacemaker like absence."\r\n\r\n"The only pity is that Swanslea is no further off," returned Bessie.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that Cecil, backed by her two counsellors, held her\r\npurpose, and Raymond sadly spoke of the plan of separation to\r\nJulius.  Both thought Mrs. Poynsett\'s own plan the best, though they\r\ncould not bear the idea of her leaving her own house.  Raymond was\r\nmuch displeased.\r\n\r\n"At least," he said, "there is a reprieve till this frantic\r\nfortnight is over.  I envy your exemption from the turmoil."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would exempt yourself from the races," said Julius.\r\n"The mischief they have done in these villages is incalculable!  The\r\nvery men-servants are solicited to put into sweepstakes, whenever\r\nthey go into Wil\'sbro\'; and only this morning Mrs. Hornblower has\r\nbeen to me about her son."\r\n\r\n"I thought he was the great feather in Herbert Bowater\'s cap."\r\n\r\n"Showing the direction of the wind only too well.  Since Herbert has\r\nbeen infected with the general insanity, poor Harry Hornblower has\r\nlapsed into his old ways, and is always hanging about the \'Three\r\nPigeons\' with some of the swarm of locusts who have come down\r\nalready to brawl round the training stables.  This has come to\r\nTruelove\'s ears, and he has notice of dismissal.  At the mother\'s\r\ndesire I spoke to Truelove, but he told me that at last year\'s races\r\nthe lad had gambled at a great rate, and had only been saved from\r\ndishonesty by detection in time.  He was so penitent that Truelove\r\ngave him another trial, on condition that he kept out of temptation;\r\nbut now he has gone back to it, Mr. Truelove thinks it the only way\r\nof saving him from some fresh act of dishonesty.  \'It is all up with\r\nthem,\' he says, \'when once they take that turn.\'"\r\n\r\n"You need not speak as if I were accountable for all the\r\nblackguardism."\r\n\r\n"Every man is accountable who lends his name and position to bolster\r\nup a field of vice."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, Julius.  Remember what men have been on the turf."\r\n\r\n"If those men had withheld their support, fashion would not have led\r\nso many to their ruin."\r\n\r\n"Hundreds are present without damage.  It is a hearty out-of-doors\r\ncountry amusement, and one of the few general holidays that bring\r\nall ranks together."\r\n\r\n"You speak of racing as it has been or might be in some golden age,"\r\nsaid Julius.  "Of course there is no harm in trying one horse\'s\r\nspeed against another; but look at the facts and say whether it is\r\nright to support an amusement that becomes such an occasion of\r\nevil."\r\n\r\n"Because a set of rascals choose to bring their villainies there you\r\nwould have the sport of the whole neighbourhood given up.  \'No cakes\r\nand ale\' with a vengeance!"\r\n\r\n"The cakes and ale that make a brother offend ought to be given up."\r\n\r\n"That sentences all public amusements."\r\n\r\n"Not necessarily.  The question is of degree.  Other amusements may\r\nhave evil incidentally connected with them, and may lead to\r\ntemptation, but it is not their chief excitement.  The play or the\r\nopera is the prime interest, and often a refined and elevated one,\r\nbut at races the whole excitement depends upon the horses, and is so\r\nfictitious that it needs to be enhanced by this betting system.  No\r\nbetter faculty is called into play.  Some few men may understand the\r\nmerits of the horse; many more, and most of the ladies, simply like\r\nthe meeting in numbers; but there is no higher faculty called out,\r\nand in many cases the whole attraction is the gambling, and the\r\nfouler wickedness in the background."\r\n\r\n"Which would be ten thousand times worse if all gentlemen stood\r\naloof."\r\n\r\n"What good do these gentlemen do beyond keeping the contest\r\nhonourable and the betting in which they are concerned?  Do not they\r\nmake themselves decoys to the young men on the border-land who would\r\nstay away if the turf were left to the mere vulgar?  Why should they\r\nnot leave it to drop like bull-baiting or cock-fighting?"\r\n\r\n"Well done, Julius!" said Raymond.  "You will head a clerical\r\ncrusade against the turf, but I do not think it just to compare it\r\nwith those ferocious sports which were demoralizing in themselves;\r\nwhile this is to large numbers simply a harmless holiday and excuse\r\nfor an outing, not to speak of the benefit to the breed of horses."\r\n\r\n"I do not say that all competitions of speed are necessarily wrong,\r\nbut I do say that the present way of managing races makes them so\r\nmischievous that no one ought to encourage them."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what Backsworth and Wil\'sbro\' would say to you!  It is\r\ntheir great harvest.  Lodgings for those three days pay a quarter\'s\r\nrent; and where so many interests are concerned, a custom cannot\r\nlightly be dropped."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Raymond with a sigh, "it is not pleasure that takes me.\r\nI shall look on with impartial eyes, if that is what you wish."\r\n\r\nPoor Raymond! it was plain that he had little liking for anything\r\nthat autumn.  He rode over to Swanslea with Cecil, and when he said\r\nit was six miles off, she called it four; what he termed bare,\r\nmarshy, and dreary, was in her eyes open and free; his swamp was her\r\nlake; and she ran about discovering charms and capabilities where he\r\nsaw nothing but damp and dry rot, and, above all, banishment.\r\n\r\nWould she have her will?  Clio would have thought her lecture had\r\ntaken effect, and mayhap, it added something to the general temper\r\nof self-assertion, but in fact Cecil had little time to think, so\r\nthickly did gaieties and preparations crowd upon her.  It was the\r\nfull glory and importance of the Member\'s wife, her favourite ideal,\r\nbut all the time her satisfaction was marred by secret heartache as\r\nshe saw how wearily and formally her husband dragged through\r\nwhatever fell to his lot, saw how jaded and depressed he looked, and\r\nheard him laugh his company laugh without any heart in it.  She\r\nthought it all his mother\'s fault, and meant to make up for\r\neverything when she had him to herself.\r\n\r\nJulius had his troubles.  When Rosamond found that races were what\r\nshe called his pet aversion, she resisted with all her might.  Her\r\nhome associations were all on fire again.  She would not condemn the\r\npleasures she had shared with her parents, by abstinence from them,\r\nany more than she would deviate from Lady Rathforlane\'s nursery\r\nmanagement to please Mrs. Poynsett and Susan.  A bonnet, which\r\nJulius trusted never to see in church, was purchased in the face of\r\nhis remark that every woman who carried her gay attire to the stand\r\nmade herself an additional feather on the hook of evil.  At first\r\nshe laughed, and then grew tearfully passionate in protests that\r\nnothing should induce her to let her brothers see what their own\r\nfather did turned into a crime; and if they went without her to take\r\ncare of them, and fell into mischief, whose fault would that be?\r\n\r\nIt was vain to hint that Tom was gone back to school, and Terry\r\ncared more for the Olympic dust than that of Backsworth.  She had\r\npersuaded herself that his absence would be high treason to her\r\nfather, whom she respected far more at a distance than when she had\r\nbeen struggling with his ramshackle, easy-going ways.  Even now, she\r\nwas remonstrating with him about poor Terry\'s present misery.  His\r\nlast half year had been spent under the head-master, who had\r\ncultivated his historical and poetical intelligence, whereas Mr.\r\nDriver was nothing but an able crammer; and the moment the lad\r\nbecame interested and diverged from routine, he was choked off\r\nbecause such things would not \'tell.\'  If the \'coach\' had any\r\nenthusiasm it was for mathematics, and thitherwards Terry\'s brain\r\nwas undeveloped.  With misplaced ingenuity, he argued that sums came\r\nright by chance and that Euclid was best learnt by heart, for \'the\r\npictures\' simply confused him; and when Julius, amazed at finding so\r\nclever a boy in the novel position of dunce, tried to find out what\r\nhe did know of arithmetic, his ignorance and inappreciation were so\r\nunfathomable that Julius doubted whether the power or the will was\r\nat fault.  At any rate he was wretched in the present, and dismal as\r\nto the future, and looked on his brother-in-law as in league with\r\nthe oppressors for trying to rouse his sense of duty.\r\n\r\nRemonstrance seemed blunted and ineffective everywhere.  When\r\nHerbert Bowater tried to reclaim Harry Hornblower into giving up his\r\nnotorious comrades, he received the dogged reply, "Why should not a\r\nchap take his pleasure as well as you?"  With the authority at once\r\nof clergyman and squire\'s son, he said, "Harry, you forget yourself.\r\nI am not going to discuss my occupations with you."\r\n\r\n"You know better," rudely interrupted the lad.  "Racketing about all\r\nover the country, and coming home late at night.  You\'d best not\r\nspeak of other folks!"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Herbert had never been later than was required\r\nby a walk home from a dinner, or a very moderate cricket supper; and\r\nhis conscience was clear as to the quality of his amusements; but\r\ninstead of, as hitherto, speaking as youth to youth, he used the\r\nlanguage of the minister to the insulting parishioner.  "I am sorry\r\nI have disturbed Mrs. Hornblower, but the case is not parallel.\r\nInnocent amusement is one thing--it is quite another to run into\r\nhaunts that have _already_ proved dangerous to your principles."\r\n\r\nHarry Hornblower laughed.  "It\'s no go coming the parson over me,\r\nMr. Bowater!  It\'s well known what black coats are, and how they\r\nnever cry out so loud upon other folks as when they\'ve had a jolly\r\nlark among themselves.  No concealment now, we\'re up to a thing or\r\ntwo, and parsons, and capitalists, and squires will have to look\r\nsharp."\r\n\r\nThis oration, smacking of \'The Three Pigeons,\' was delivered so loud\r\nas to bring the mother on the scene.  "O, Harry, Harry, you aren\'t\r\nnever speaking like that to Mr. Bowater!"\r\n\r\n"When folks jaw me about what\'s nothing to them I always give them\r\nas good as they bring.  That\'s my principle," said Harry, flinging\r\nout of the house, while the curate tried to console the weeping\r\nmother, and soon after betook himself to his Rector with no mild\r\ncomments on the lad\'s insolence.\r\n\r\n"Another warning how needful it is for us to avoid all occasion for\r\nmisconstruction," said Julius.\r\n\r\n"We do, all of us," said Herbert.  "Even that wretched decoction,\r\nFuller, and that mere dictionary, Driver, never gave cause for\r\nimputations like these.  What has the fellow got hold of?"\r\n\r\n"Stories of the last century \'two-bottle men,\'" said Julius,\r\n"trumped up by unionists now against us in these days.  The truth is\r\nthat the world triumphs and boasts whenever it catches the ministry\r\non its own ground.  Its ideal is as exacting as the saintly one."\r\n\r\n"I say Rector," exclaimed the curate, after due pause, "you\'ll be at\r\nEvensong on Saturday?  The ladies at Sirenwood want me to go to\r\nBacksworth with them to hear the band."\r\n\r\n"Cannot young Strangeways take care of his sisters?"\r\n\r\n"I would not ask it, sir, but they have set their heart on seeing\r\nRood House, and want me to go with them because of knowing Dr.\r\nEasterby.  Then I\'m to dine with them, and that\'s the very last of\r\nit for me.  There\'s no more croquet after this week."\r\n\r\n"I am thankful to hear it," said Julius, suppressing his distaste\r\nthat the man he most reverenced, and the place which was his haven\r\nof rest, should be a mere lion for Bee and Conny, a slight pastime\r\nbefore the regimental band!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\nThe Apple of Ate\r\n\r\n\r\nOh mirror, mirror on the wall,\r\nWho is the fairest of us all?--The Three Bears\r\n\r\n"I do really think Terry has found the secret of happiness, for a\r\n_little_ while at least," said Rosamond, entering Mrs. Poynsett\'s\r\nroom.  "That funny little man in the loan museum has asked him to\r\nhelp in the arrangement."\r\n\r\n"Who is it?"\r\n\r\n"The little watchmaker, or watch cobbler, in the old curiosity\r\nshop."\r\n\r\n"Yes; Terry calls him a descendant of the Genoese Frescobaldi, and\r\nI\'m sure his black eyes were never made for an English head.  Terry\r\nhas always haunted those uncanny wares of his, and has pursued them\r\nto the museum.  \'\'Tis not every young gentleman I would wish to see\r\nthere,\' says the old man, \'but the Honourable Mr. De Lancey has the\r\nsoul of an antiquarian.\'"\r\n\r\n"They say the old man is really very clever and well read."\r\n\r\n"He looks like an old magician, with his white cap and spectacles,\r\nand he had need to have a wand to bring order out of that awful\r\nchaos.  Everybody all round has gone and cleared out their rubbish-\r\ncloset.  Upon my word, it looks so.  There are pictures all one\r\nnetwork of cracks, and iron caps and gauntlets out of all the halls\r\nin every stage of rust, and pots and pans and broken crocks, and\r\nbaskets of coin all verdigris and tarnish!--Pah!"\r\n\r\n"Are Miles\'s birds safe?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, with a swordfish\'s sword and a sawfish\'s saw making a\r\ntrophy on the top.  Terry is in the library, hunting material for a\r\ndissertation upon the ancient unicorn, which ought to conclude with\r\nthe battle royal witnessed by Alice in Wonderland.  The stuffed\r\ndepartment is numerous but in a bad way as to hair, and chiefly\r\nconsists of everybody\'s grandmother\'s old parrots and squirrels and\r\nwhite rats.  Then, every boy, who ever had a fit of birds\' eggs or\r\nbutterflies, has sent in a collection, chiefly minus the lower\r\nwings, and with volunteer specimens of moth; but luckily some give\r\nleave to do what they please with them, so the magician is making\r\ncomposition animals with the debris."\r\n\r\n"Not really!"\r\n\r\n"I made a feeble attempt with an admiral\'s wings and an orange tip,\r\nbut I was scouted.  About four dilapidated ones make up a proper\r\nspecimen, and I can\'t think how it is all to be done in the time;\r\nbut really something fit to be seen is emerging.  Terry is sorting\r\nthe coins, a pretty job, I should say; but felicity to him.  But oh!\r\nthe industrial articles!  There are all the regalia, carved out of\r\ncherry-stones, and a patchwork quilt of 5000 bits of silk each no\r\nbigger than a shilling.  And a calculation of the middle verse in\r\nthe Bible, and the longest verse, and the shortest verse, and the\r\nlike edifying Scriptural researches, all copied out like flies\'\r\nlegs, in writing no one can see but Julius with his spectacles off,\r\nand set in a brooch as big as the top of a thimble, all done by a\r\none-legged sergeant of marines.  So that the line might not be out\r\ndone, I offered my sergeant-major\'s banner-screen, but I am sorry to\r\nsay they declined it, which made me jealous."\r\n\r\n"Are there any drawings of the Reynolds\' boy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Lenore Vivian brought them down, and very good they are.\r\nEvery one says he has the making of a genius, but he does not look\r\nas if it agreed with him; he is grown tall, and thin, and white, and\r\nI should not wonder if those good-for-nothing servants bullied him."\r\n\r\n"Did you see anything of Eleonora?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing so impossible.  I meet her every day, but she is always\r\nbeset with the Strangeways, and I think she avoids me."\r\n\r\n"I can hardly think so."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like it!  That man is always hanging about Sirenwood, and\r\nLenore never stirs an inch without one of those girls.  I wish Frank\r\ncould see for himself, poor fellow."\r\n\r\n"He does hope to run down next week.  I have just heard from him in\r\nhigh spirits.  One of his seniors has come into some property,\r\nanother is out of health and retires, so there is some promotion in\r\nview."\r\n\r\n"I wish it would make haste then.  I don\'t like the look of things."\r\n\r\n"I can hardly disbelieve in the dear girl herself; yet I do feel as\r\nif it were against nature for it to succeed.  Did you hear anything\r\nof Mrs. Bowater to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, she is much better, and Edith is coming to go into the gallery\r\nwith me on Tuesday when they inaugurate the Rat-house.  Oh! did you\r\nhear of the debate about it?  You know there\'s to be a procession--\r\nall the Volunteers, and all the Odd Fellows, and all the Good\r\nTemplars, and all the school-children of all denominations--whatever\r\ncan walk behind a flag.  Our choir boys grew emulous, and asked\r\nHerbert to ask the Rector to let them have our lovely banner with\r\nthe lilies on it; but he declined, though there\'s no choice but to\r\ngive the holiday that will be taken."\r\n\r\n"Was that the debate?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no! that was among the higher powers--where the procession\r\nshould start from.  The precedent was an opening that began with\r\ngoing to church, and having a sermon from the Bishop; but then\r\nthere\'s no church, and after that spur the Bishop gave them they\r\ncan\'t ask him without one; besides, the mayor dissents, and so do a\r\ngood many more of them.  So they are to meet at the Market Cross,\r\nand Mr. Fuller, in the famous black gown, supported by Mr. Driver,\r\nis to head them.  I\'m not sure that Julius and Herbert were not in\r\nthe programme, but Mr. Truelove spoke up, and declared that Mr.\r\nFlynn the Wesleyan Methodist, and Mr. Howler the Primitive\r\nMethodist, and Mr. Riffell the Baptist, had quite as good a right to\r\nwalk in the foreground and to hold forth, and Mr. Moy supported\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Popularity hunting against Raymond."\r\n\r\n"Precisely.  But Howler, Flynn, and Co. were too much for Mr.\r\nFuller, so he seceded, and the religious ceremonies are now to be\r\nconfined to his saying grace at the dinner.  Raymond thinks it as\r\nwell, for the inaugural speech would only have been solemn mockery;\r\nbut Julius thinks it a sad beginning for the place to have no\r\nblessing because of our unhappy divisions.  Isn\'t that like Julius?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly, though I see it more from Raymond\'s point of view.  So you\r\nare going to the dinner?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes.  Happily my Rector has nothing to say against that, and I\r\nam sure he owes me something for keeping me out of the bazaar.  In\r\nfact, having avoided the trouble, I _couldn\'t_ take the pleasure!\r\nand he must set that against the races."\r\n\r\n"My dear, though I am not set against races like Julius, I think,\r\nconsidering his strong feelings on the subject--"\r\n\r\n"My dear Mrs. Poynsett, it would be very bad for Julius to give in\r\nto his fancies.  The next thing would be to set baby up in a little\r\nhood and veil like a nun!"\r\n\r\nRosamond\'s winsome nonsense could not but gain a smile.  No doubt\r\nshe was a pleasant daughter-in-law, though, for substantial care,\r\nAnne was the strength and reliance.  Even Anne was much engrossed by\r\npreparations for the bazaar.  It had been a great perplexity to her\r\nthat the one thing she thought not worldly should be condemned by\r\nJulius, and he had not tried to prevent her from assisting Cecil,\r\nthinking, as he had told Eleonora, that the question of right and\r\nwrong was not so trenchant as to divide households.\r\n\r\nThe banquet and inauguration went off fairly well.  There was\r\nnothing in it worth recording, except that Rosamond pronounced that\r\nRaymond only wanted a particle of Irish fluency to be a perfect\r\nspeaker; but every one was observing how ill and depressed he\r\nlooked.  Even Cecil began to see it herself, and to ask Lady Tyrrell\r\nwith some anxiety whether she thought him altered.\r\n\r\n"Men always look worn after a Session," said Lady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n"If this really makes him unhappy!"\r\n\r\n"My dear Cecil, that\'s the very proof of the necessity.  If it makes\r\nhim unhappy to go five miles away with his wife, it ought not.  You\r\nshould wean him from such dependence."\r\n\r\nCecil had tears in her eyes as she said, "I don\'t know!  When I hear\r\nhim sighing in his sleep, I long to give it up and tell him I will\r\ntry to be happy here."\r\n\r\n"My dear child, don\'t be weak.  If you give way now, you will rue it\r\nall your life."\r\n\r\n"If I could have taken to his mother, I think he would have cared\r\nmore for me."\r\n\r\n"No.  The moment her jealousy was excited she would have resumed\r\nhim, and you would have been the more shut out in the cold.  A\r\nlittle firmness now, and the fresh start is before you."\r\n\r\nCecil sighed, feeling that she was paying a heavy price for that\r\nfresh start, but her hands were too full for much thought.  Guests\r\ncame to dinner, Mrs. Poynsett kept more to her own room, and Raymond\r\nexerted himself to talk, so that the blank of the evenings was less\r\napparent.  The days were spent at the town-hall, where the stalls\r\nwere raised early enough for all the ladies, their maids and\r\nfootmen, to buzz about them all day, decking them out.\r\n\r\nMrs. Duncombe was as usual the guiding spirit, contriving all with a\r\ncleverness that made the deficiencies of her household the more\r\nremarkable.  Conny and Bee Strangeways were the best workers, having\r\nplenty of experience and resource, and being ready to do anything,\r\nhowever hard, dusty, or disagreeable; and to drudge contentedly,\r\nwith plenty of chatter indeed, but quite as freely to a female as to\r\na male companion; whereas Miss Moy had a knot of men constantly\r\nabout her, and made a noise which was a sore trial to Cecil\'s heavy\r\nspirit all the first day, exclusive of the offence to her native\r\nfastidiousness.  She even called upon Lady Tyrrell and Mrs. Duncombe\r\nto hold a council whether all gentlemen should not be excluded the\r\nnext day, as spoiling the ladies\' work, and of no use themselves;\r\nbut there were one or two who really did toil, and so well that they\r\ncould not be dispensed with, and Mrs. Duncombe added that it would\r\nnot do to give offence.\r\n\r\nThere was a harassed look about Mrs. Duncombe herself, for much\r\ndepended on the success of her husband\'s filly, Dark Hag.  The\r\nCaptain had hitherto been cautious, and had secured himself against\r\nheavy loss, so as to make the turf a tolerable speculation, on but\r\nthe wonderful perfections of this animal had led him to stake much\r\nmore on her than had been his wont; and though his wife was assured\r\nof being a rich woman in another week, she was not sorry for the\r\nmultiplicity of occupations which hindered her mind from dwelling\r\ntoo much on the chances.\r\n\r\n"How calm you look,--how I envy you!" she said, as she came to\r\nborrow some tape of Eleonora Vivian, who was fastening the pendent\r\narticles to the drapery of her sister\'s stall.  Eleonora gave a\r\nconstrained smile, feeling how little truth there was in her\r\napparent peace, wearied out as she was with the long conflict and\r\nconstant distrust.  She was the more anxious to be with Lady Susan,\r\nwhose every word she could believe, and she finally promised to\r\nleave home with Bee and Conny the day after the ball, and to meet\r\ntheir mother in London.  They knew there was no chance for Lorimer,\r\nbut they took her on her own terms, hoping something perhaps, and at\r\nany rate glad to be a comfort to one whom they really loved, while\r\nLady Tyrrell was delighted to promote the visit, seeing that the\r\nfamily did more for Lorimer\'s cause than he did for himself; and in\r\nhis own home who could guess the result, especially after certain\r\nother manoeuvres of her ladyship had taken effect?\r\n\r\nLady Tyrrell did not know, nor indeed did Conny or Bee, that, though\r\nthey would meet their mother in London, she would not at once go\r\ninto Yorkshire with them, but would send them to their uncle\'s,\r\nwhile she repaired to the retreat at St. Faith\'s.  The harass of\r\nthese last few weeks, especially the endeavour to make her go to the\r\nraces, had removed all scruples from Lenore\'s mind as to leaving her\r\nhome in ignorance of her intentions.  To her mind, the circumstances\r\nof her brother\'s death had made a race-course no place for any of\r\nthe family, especially that of Backsworth; gout coming opportunely\r\nto disable her father in London, and one or two other little\r\naccidents, had prevented the matter from coming to an issue while\r\nshe had been in London, and the avowal of her intention to keep away\r\nhad filled her father with passion at her for her absurd scruples\r\nand pretences at being better than other people.  It had been Lady\r\nTyrrell who pacified him with assurances that she would soon do\r\nbetter; no one wished to force her conscience, and Lenore, always on\r\nthe watch, began to wonder whether her sister had any reason for\r\nwishing to keep her away, and longed the more for the house of truth\r\nand peace.\r\n\r\nSo came on the bazaar day, which Mrs. Poynsett spent in solitude,\r\nexcept for visits from the Rectory, and one from Joanna Bowater, who\r\nlooked in while Julius was sitting with her, and amused them by her\r\naccount of herself as an emissary from home with ten pounds to be\r\ngot rid of from her father and mother for good neighbourhood\'s sake.\r\nShe brought Mrs. Poynsett a beautiful bouquet, for the elderly\r\nspinsters, she said, sat on the stairs and kept up a constant\r\nsupply; and she had also some exquisite Genoese wire ornaments from\r\nCecil\'s counter, and a set of studs from a tray of polished pebbles\r\nsent up from Vivian\'s favourite lapidary at Rockpier.  She had been\r\namused to find the Miss Strangeways hunting over it to match that\r\nvery simple-looking charm which Lena wore on to her watch, for, as\r\nshe said, "the attraction must either be the simplicity of it, or\r\nthe general Lena-worship in which those girls indulge."\r\n\r\n"How does that dear child look?"\r\n\r\n"Fagged, I think, but so does every one, and it was not easy to keep\r\norder, Mrs. Duncombe\'s counter was such a rendezvous for noisy\r\npeople, and Miss Moy was perfectly dreadful, running about forcing\r\nthings on people and refusing change."\r\n\r\n"And how is poor Anne enduring?"\r\n\r\n"Like Christian in Vanity Fair as long as she did endure, for she\r\nretired to the spinsters on the back stairs.  I offered to bring her\r\nhome, and she accepted with delight, but I dropped her in the\r\nvillage to bestow her presents.  I was determined to come on here;\r\nwe go on Monday."\r\n\r\n"Shall you be at the Ordination?"\r\n\r\n"I trust so.  If mamma is pretty well, we shall both go."\r\n\r\n"Is Edith going to the ball on Thursday?"\r\n\r\n"No, she has given it up.  It seems as if we at least ought to\r\nrecollect our Ember days, though I am ashamed to think we never did\r\ntill this time last year."\r\n\r\n"I confess that I never heard of them," said Mrs. Poynsett.  "Don\'t\r\nlook shocked, my dear; such things were not taught in my time."\r\n\r\nJulius showed her the rubric and the prayer from the book in his\r\npocket, knowing that the one endeared to her by association was one\r\nof the Prayer-books made easy by omission of all not needed at the\r\nbarest Sunday service.\r\n\r\n"I see," she said, "it seems quite right.  I wish you had told me\r\nbefore you were ordained, my dear."\r\n\r\n"You kept your Ember days for me by instinct, dear mother."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be too sure, Julius.  One learns many things when one is laid\r\non one\'s back."\r\n\r\n"Think of Herbert now," whispered Jenny.  "I am glad he is sheltered\r\nfrom all this hubbub by being at the palace.  I suppose you cannot\r\ngo to the Cathedral, Julius?"\r\n\r\n"No, Bindon will not come back till his brother\'s holiday is over,\r\nnor do I even know where to write to him.  Oh! here comes Anne.  Now\r\nfor her impressions."\r\n\r\nAnne had brought her little gift for Mrs. Poynsett, and displayed\r\nher presents for Glen Fraser, but as to what she had seen it made\r\nher shudder and say, "You were right, Julius, I did not know people\r\ncould go on so!  And with all those poor people ill close by.  Miss\r\nSlater, who sat on the stairs just below me tying up flowers, is\r\nmuch grieved about a lad who was at work there till a fortnight ago,\r\nand now is dying of a fever, and harassed by all the rattling of the\r\ncarriages."\r\n\r\n"What! close by!  Nothing infectious, I hope?"\r\n\r\n"The doctor called it gastric fever, but no one was to hear of it\r\nlest there should be an alarm; and it was too late to change the\r\nplace of the bazaar, though it is so sad to have all that gaiety\r\nclose at hand."\r\n\r\nIf these were the impressions of Anne and Joanna early in the day,\r\nwhat were they later, when, in those not sustained by excitement,\r\nspirit and energy began to flag?  Cecil\'s counter, with her\r\nexcellent and expensive wares, and her own dignified propriety, was\r\nfar less popular than those where the goods were cheaper and the\r\nsaleswomen less inaccessible, and she was not only disappointed at\r\nher failure, but vexed when told that the articles must be raffled\r\nfor.  She could not object, but it seemed an unworthy end for what\r\nhad cost her so much money and pains to procure, and it was not\r\npleasant to see Mrs. Duncombe and Miss Moy hawking the tickets\r\nabout, like regular touters, nor the most beautiful things drawn by\r\nthe most vulgar and tasteless people.\r\n\r\nMiss Moy had around her a court of \'horsey\' men who were lounging\r\naway the day before the races, and who had excited her spirits to a\r\npitch of boisterousness such as dismayed Mrs. Duncombe herself when\r\nher attempts at repression were only laughed at.\r\n\r\nSomehow, among these adherents, there arose a proposal for the\r\nelection of a queen of beauty, each gentleman paying half-a-crown\r\nfor the right of voting.  Miss Moy bridled and tried to blush.  She\r\nwas a tall, highly-coloured, flashing-eyed brunette, to whom a\r\ntriumph would be immense over the refined, statuesque, severe Miss\r\nVivian, and an apple-blossom innocent-looking girl who was also\r\npresent, and though Lady Tyrrell was incontestably the handsomest\r\nperson in the room, her age and standing had probably prevented her\r\noccurring to the propounders of the scheme.\r\n\r\nThe design was taking shape when young Strangeways, who was willing\r\nto exchange chaff with Gussie Moy, but was gentleman enough to feel\r\nthe indecorum of the whole thing, moved across to his sister, and\r\nmuttered, "I say, Con, they are getting up that stupid trick of\r\nelection of a queen of beauty.  Does Lady Tyrrell know it?"\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t it be rather fun?"\r\n\r\n"Horrid bad form, downright impudence.  Mother would squash it at\r\nonce.  Go and warn one of them," signing with his head.\r\n\r\nConstance made her way to Eleonora, who had already been perplexed\r\nand angered by more than one critical stare, as one and another man\r\nloitered past and gazed intrepidly at her.  She hurried at once to\r\nher sister, who was sitting passively behind her counter as if\r\nwearied out, and who would not be stirred to interference.  "Never\r\nmind, Lenore, it can\'t be helped.  It is all for the cause, and to\r\nstop it would be worse taste, fitting on the cap as an acknowledged\r\nbeauty, and to that I\'m not equal."\r\n\r\n"It is an insult."\r\n\r\n"Never fear, they\'ll never choose you while you look so forbidding,\r\nthough perhaps it is rather becoming.  They have not the taste."\r\n\r\nEleonora said no more, but went over to the window where Raymond was\r\nkeeping his guard, with his old-fashioned sense of protection.  She\r\nhad no sooner told him than he started into incredulous indignation,\r\nin which he was joined by his wife who only wished him to dash\r\nforward to prevent the scheme before he would believe it real.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the ballot-box came his way, and a simpering youth\r\npresented him with a card, begging for his opinion, he spoke so as\r\nto be heard by all, "No, thank you, sir.  I am requested by the\r\nladies present to state that such competition was never contemplated\r\nby their committee and would be repugnant to all their sentiments.\r\nThey beg that the election may be at once dropped and the money\r\nreturned."\r\n\r\nMr. Charnock Poynsett had a weight that no one resisted.  There was\r\na moment\'s silence, a little murmur, apologetic and remonstrant, but\r\nthe deed was done.\r\n\r\nOnly a clear voice, with the thrillings of disappointed vanity and\r\nexultation scarcely disguised by a laugh, was heard saying, louder\r\nthan the owner knew, "Oh, of course Mr. Charnock Poynsett spoiled\r\nsport.  It would have been awkward between his wife and his old\r\nflame."\r\n\r\n"For shame, Gussie," hushed Mrs. Duncombe, "they\'ll hear."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care!  Let them!  Stuck-up people!"\r\n\r\nWhoever heard, Cecil Charnock Poynsett did, and felt as if the\r\nground were giving way with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\nThe Lady Green Mantle\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night, just like the night before,\r\n   In terrors passed away,\r\nNor did the demons vanish thence\r\n   Before the dawn of day.--MOORE\r\n\r\nThe turmoil was over, the gains had been emptied into bags to be\r\ncounted at leisure, the relics of the sale left to be disposed of\r\nthrough the Exchange and Mart.  Terry, looking tired to death,\r\ndescended from his post as assistant showman; and, with some\r\ngentlemen who were to dine at Compton Poynsett, Cecil drove home to\r\ndress in haste, and act hostess to a large dinner-party.  All the\r\ntime she felt giddy at the words she had heard--"Mr. Poynsett\'s old\r\nflame."  It was constantly ringing in her ears, and one conviction\r\nwas before her mind.  Her cheeks burnt like fire, and when she\r\nreached her own room at night, and leant from the window to cool\r\nthem, they only burnt the more.\r\n\r\nHad she been wilfully deceived? had she been taking the counsel of a\r\njealous woman about her husband?  Had not Camilla assured her that\r\nthe object of his first love was not in the country?  Ay; but when\r\nthat was spoken Camilla herself was in London, and Cecil knew enough\r\nof her friend to be aware that she viewed such a subterfuge as\r\ningenious.  Even then she had perceived that the person alluded to\r\ncould only have been a Vivian, and the exclamation of careless spite\r\ncarried assurance to her that she had been tricked into confidence,\r\nand acceptance of the advice of a rival.  She had a feverish longing\r\nto know more, and obtain explanation and external certainty.  But\r\nhow?\r\n\r\nRaymond was one of the very tired that night.  He fell asleep the\r\ninstant his head touched the pillow; but it was that sobbing,\r\nsighing sleep which had before almost swept away, from very ruth,\r\nher resolution; and on this night there were faltering words,\r\nstrangely, though unconsciously, replying to her thoughts.\r\n"Camilla, a cruel revenge!"  "Poor child! but for you she might have\r\nlearnt."  "My mother!"  "Why, why this persistent hatred?"  "Cannot\r\nyou let us alone?"  "Must you destroy our home?"\r\n\r\nThese were the mutterings at intervals.  She listened, and in the\r\ndarkness her impulse was to throw herself on her husband, tell him\r\nall, show him how she had been misled, and promise to give up all to\r\nwhich that true Vivienne had prompted her.  She did even try to wake\r\nhim, but the attempt caused only a more distinct expostulation of\r\n"Cannot you let her alone?"  "Cannot you let us learn to love one\r\nanother?"  "It may be revenge on me or my mother; but what has she\r\ndone?"  "Don\'t!--oh, don\'t!"\r\n\r\nThe distress she caused forced her to desist, and she remembered how\r\nRaymond had always warned her.  The intimacy with Lady Tyrrell had\r\nbeen in the teeth of his remonstrances.  He had said everything to\r\nprevent it short of confessing his former attachment, and though\r\nresentful that the warning had been denied her, she felt it had been\r\nwell that she had been prevented from putting the question on her\r\nfirst impulse.  Many ways of ascertaining the fact were revolved by\r\nher as with an aching head she lay hopelessly awake till morning,\r\nwhen she fell into a doze which lasted until she found that Raymond\r\nhad risen, and that she must dress in haste, unless she meant to\r\nlose her character for punctuality.  Her head still ached, and she\r\nfelt thoroughly tired; but when Raymond advised her to stay at home,\r\nand recruit herself for the ball, she said the air of the downs\r\nwould refresh her.  Indeed, she felt as if quiet and loneliness\r\nwould be intolerable until she could understand herself and what she\r\nhad heard.\r\n\r\nRaymond took the reins of the barouche, and a gentleman who had\r\nslept at the Hall went on the box beside him, leaving room for\r\nRosamond and her brother, who were to be picked up at the Rectory;\r\nbut when they drew up there, only Rosamond came out in the wonderful\r\nbonnet, just large enough to contain one big water-lily, which\r\nsuited well with the sleepy grace of her movements, and the glossy\r\nsheen of her mauve silk.\r\n\r\n"Terry is not coming.  He has a headache, poor boy," she said, as\r\nJulius shut her into the barouche.  "Take care of him and baby."\r\n\r\n"Take care of yourself, Madam Madcap," said Julius, with a smile, as\r\nshe bent down to give him a parting kiss, with perhaps a little\r\npleading for forgiveness in it.  But instead of, as last year,\r\nshuddering, either at its folly or publicity, Cecil felt a keen pang\r\nof desire for such a look as half rebuked, while it took a loving\r\nfarewell of Rosamond.  Was Camilla like that statue which the\r\nhusband inadvertently espoused with a ring, and which interposed\r\nbetween him and his wife for ever?\r\n\r\nRosamond talked.  She always had a certain embarrassment in tete-a-\r\ntetes with Cecil, and it took form in a flow of words.  "Poor Terry!\r\nhe turned faint and giddy at breakfast.  I thought he had been\r\nindulging at the refreshment-stall, but he says he was saving for a\r\nfine copy of the Faerie Queen that Friskyball told him of at a book-\r\nstall at Backsworth, and existed all day on draughts of water when\r\nhis throat grew dry as showman; so I suppose it is only inanition,\r\ncoupled with excitement and stuffiness, and that quiet will repair\r\nhim.  He would not hear of my staying with him."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you do not wish to be late?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," said Rosamond, who, indeed, would have given up\r\nbefore, save for her bonnet and her principle; and whatever she said\r\nof Lady Rathforlane\'s easy management of her nurslings, did not\r\ndesire to be _too_ many hours absent from her Julia.\r\n\r\n"I only want to stay till the Three-year-old Cup has been run for,"\r\nsaid Cecil.  "Mrs. Duncombe would feel it unkind if we did not."\r\n\r\n"You look tired," said Rosamond, kindly; "put your feet upon the\r\nfront seat--nobody will look.  Do you know how much you cleared?"\r\n\r\n"Not yet," said Cecil.  "I do not know what was made by the raffles.\r\nHow I do hate them!  Fancy that lovely opal Venetian vase going to\r\nthat big bony Scotswoman, Mr. M\'Vie\'s mother."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!  That is a pity.  If I had known it would be raffled for, I\r\nwould have sent a private commission, though I don\'t know if Julius\r\nwould have let me.  He says it is gambling.  What became of the Spa\r\nwork-box, with the passion-flower wreath?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know.  I was so disgusted, that I would not look any more.\r\nI never saw such an obnoxious girl as that Miss Moy."\r\n\r\n"_That_ she is," said Rosamond.  "I should think she was acting the\r\nfast girl as found in sensation novels."\r\n\r\n"Exactly," said Cecil, proceeding to narrate the proposed election;\r\nand in her need of sympathy she even told its sequel, adding,\r\n"Rosamond, do you know what she meant?"\r\n\r\n"Is it fair to tell you?" said Rosamond, asking a question she knew\r\nto be vain.\r\n\r\n"I must know whether I have been deceived."\r\n\r\n"Never by Raymond!" cried Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"Never, never, never!" cried Cecil, with most unusual excitement.\r\n"He told me all that concerned himself at the very first.  I wish he\r\nhad told me who it was.  How much it would have saved!  Rosamond,\r\nyou know, I am sure."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I made Julius tell me; but indeed, Cecil, you need not mind.\r\nNever has a feeling more entirely died out."\r\n\r\n"Do you think I do not know that?" said Cecil.  "Do you think my\r\nhusband could have been my husband if he had not felt _that_?"\r\n\r\n"Dear Cecil, I am so glad," cried impulsive Rosamond; her gladness,\r\nin truth, chiefly excited by the anger that looked like love for\r\nRaymond.  "I mean, I am glad you see it so, and don\'t doubt him."\r\n\r\n"I hope we are both above that," said Cecil.  "No, it is Camilla\r\nthat I want to know about.  I _must_ know whether she told me\r\ntruth."\r\n\r\n"She told! what did she tell you?"\r\n\r\n"That _he_--Raymond--had loved some one," said Cecil in a stifled\r\nvoice; "that I little knew what his love could be.  I thought it had\r\nbeen for her sister in India.  She told me that it was nobody in the\r\ncountry.  But then we were in town."\r\n\r\n"Just like her!" cried Rosamond, and wondered not to be\r\ncontradicted.\r\n\r\n"Tell me how it really was!" only asked Cecil.\r\n\r\n"As far as I know, the attachment grew up with Raymond, but it was\r\nwhen the brother was alive, and Sir Harry at his worst; and Mrs.\r\nPoynsett did not like it, though she gave in at last, and tried to\r\nmake the best of it; but then she--Camilla--as you call her--met the\r\nold monster, Lord Tyrrell, made up a quarrel, because Mrs. Poynsett\r\nwould not abdicate, and broke it off."\r\n\r\n"She said Mrs. Poynsett only half consented, and that the family\r\ngrew weary of her persistent opposition."\r\n\r\n"And she made you think it Mrs. Poynsett\'s doing, and that she is\r\nnot possible to live with!  O, Cecil! you will not think that any\r\nlonger.  Don\'t you see that it is breaking Raymond\'s heart?"\r\n\r\nCecil\'s tears were starting, and she was very near sobbing as she\r\nsaid, "I thought perhaps if we were away by ourselves he might come\r\nto care for me.  _She_ said he never would while his mother was by--\r\nthat she would not let him."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not a bit true!" said Rosamond, indignantly.  "Is it not\r\nwhat she has most at heart, to see her sons happy?  When has she\r\never tried to interfere between Julius and me?  Not that she could,"\r\nadded Rosamond to herself in a happy little whisper, not meant to be\r\nheard, but it was; and with actual though suppressed sobs, Cecil\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n"O, Rose, Rose! what do you do to make your husband love you?"\r\n\r\n"Do?  Be very naughty!" said Rosamond, forced to think of the\r\nexigencies of the moment, and adding lightly, "There! it won\'t do to\r\ncry.  Here are the gentlemen looking round to see what is the\r\nmatter."\r\n\r\nArdently did she wish to have been able to put Cecil into Raymond\'s\r\narms and run out of sight, but with two men-servants with crossed\r\narms behind, a strange gentleman in front, the streets of Wil\'sbro\'\r\nat hand, and the race-ground impending, sentiment was impossible,\r\nand she could only make herself a tonic, and declare nothing to be\r\nthe matter; while Cecil, horrified at attracting notice, righted\r\nherself and made protest of her perfect health and comfort.  When\r\nRaymond, always careful of her, stopped the carriage and descended\r\nfrom his perch to certify himself whether she was equal to going on,\r\nhis solicitude went to her heart, and she gave his hand, as it lay\r\non the door, an affectionate thankful pressure, which so amazed him\r\nthat he raised his eyes to her face with a softness in them that\r\nmade them for a moment resemble Frank\'s.\r\n\r\nThat was all, emotion must be kept at bay, and as vehicles thickened\r\nround them as they passed through Wil\'sbro\', the two ladies betook\r\nthemselves to casual remarks upon them.  Overtaking the Sirenwood\r\ncarriage just at the turn upon the down, Raymond had no choice but\r\nto take up his station with that on one side, and on the other\r\nCaptain Duncombe\'s drag, where, fluttering with Dark Hag\'s colours,\r\nwere perched Mrs. Duncombe and Miss Moy, just in the rear of the\r\nlike conveyance from the barracks.\r\n\r\nGreetings, and invitations to both elevations were plentiful, and\r\nRosamond would have felt in her element on the military one.  She\r\nwas rapidly calculating, with her good-natured eye, whether the\r\nchoice her rank gave her would exclude some eager girl, when Cecil\r\nwhispered, "Stay with me pray," with an irresistibly beseeching\r\ntone.  So the Strangeways sisters climbed up, nothing loth; Lady\r\nTyrrell sat with her father, the centre of a throng of gentlemen,\r\nwho welcomed her to the ground where she used to be a reigning\r\nbelle; and the Colonel\'s wife, Mrs. Ross, came to sit with Lady\r\nRosamond.  The whole was perfect enjoyment to the last.  She felt it\r\na delightful taste of her merry old Bohemian days to sit in the\r\nclear September sunshine, exhilarated by the brilliancy and life\r\naround, laughing with her own little court of officers, exclaiming\r\nat every droll episode, holding her breath with the thrill of\r\nuniversal expectation and excitement, in the wonderful hush of the\r\nmultitude as the thud of the hoofs and rush in the wind was heard\r\ncoming nearer, straining her eyes as the glossy creatures and their\r\ngay riders flashed past, and setting her whole heart for the moment\r\non the one she was told to care for.\r\n\r\nRaymond, seeing his ladies well provided for, gave up his reins to\r\nthe coachman, and started in quest of a friend from the other side\r\nof the county.  About an hour later, when luncheon was in full\r\nprogress, and Rosamond was, by Cecil\'s languor, driven into doing\r\nthe honours, with her most sunshiny drollery and mirth, Raymond\'s\r\nhand was on the carriage door, and he asked in haste, "Can you spare\r\nme a glass of champagne?  Have you a scent-bottle?"\r\n\r\n"An accident?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, no, not exactly.  She has been knocked down and trampled on."\r\n\r\n"Who?  Let me come!  Can\'t I help?  Could Rosamond?"\r\n\r\n"No, no.  It is a poor woman, brutally treated.  No, I say, I\'ll\r\nmanage.  It is a dreadful scene, don\'t."\r\n\r\nBut there was something in his tone which impelled Rosamond to open\r\nthe carriage door and spring out.\r\n\r\n"Rose, I say it is no place for a lady.  I can\'t answer for it to\r\nJulius."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do that.  Take me."\r\n\r\nThere was no withstanding her, and, after all, Raymond\'s tone\r\nbetrayed that he was thankful for her help, and knew that there was\r\nno danger for her.\r\n\r\nHe had not many yards to lead her.  The regions of thoughtless\r\ngaiety were scarcely separated from the regions of undisguised evil,\r\nand Raymond, on his way back from his friend, had fallen on a\r\nhorrible row, in which a toy-selling woman had been set upon, thrown\r\ndown and trodden on, and then dragged out by the police, bleeding\r\nand senseless.  When he brought Rosamond to the spot, she was lying\r\npropped against a bundle, moaning a little, and guarded by a young\r\npoliceman, who looked perplexed and only equal to keeping back the\r\ncrowd, who otherwise, with better or worse purposes, would have\r\nrushed back in the few minutes during which Mr. Poynsett had been\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nThey fell back, staring and uttering expressions of rough wonder at\r\nthe advance of the lady in her glistening silk, but as she knelt\r\ndown by the poor creature, held her on her arm, bathed her face with\r\nscent on her own handkerchief, and held to her lips the champagne\r\nthat Raymond poured out, there was a kind of hoarse cheer.\r\n\r\n"I think her arm is put out," said Rosamond; "she ought to go to the\r\nInfirmary."\r\n\r\n"Send for a cab," said Raymond to the policeman; but at that moment\r\nthe girl opened her eyes, started at the sight of him and tried to\r\nhide her face with her hand.\r\n\r\n"It is poor Fanny Reynolds," said he in a low voice to Rosamond,\r\nwhile the policeman was gruffly telling the woman she was better,\r\nand ought to get up and not trouble the lady; but Rosamond waved off\r\nhis too decided assistance, saying:\r\n\r\n"I know who she is; she comes from my husband\'s parish; and I will\r\ntake her home.  You would like to go home, would you not, poor\r\nFanny?"\r\n\r\nThe woman shuddered, but clung to her; and in a minute or two an\r\nunwilling fly had been pressed into the service, and the girl lifted\r\ninto it by Raymond and the policeman.\r\n\r\n"You are really going with her?" said the former.  "You will judge\r\nwhether to take her home; but she ought to go to the Infirmary\r\nfirst."\r\n\r\n"Tell Cecil I am sorry to desert her," said Rosamond, as he wrung\r\nher hand, then paid the driver and gave him directions, the\r\npoliceman going with them to clear the way through the throng to the\r\nborder of the down.\r\n\r\nThe choice of the cabman had not been happy.  He tried to go towards\r\nBacksworth, and when bidden to go to Wil\'sbro\', growled out an\r\nimprecation, and dashed off at a pace that was evident agony to the\r\npoor patient; but when Rosamond stretched out at the window to\r\nremonstrate, she was answered with rude abuse that he could not be\r\nhindered all day by whims.  She perceived that he was so much in\r\nliquor that their connection had better be as brief as possible; and\r\nthe name on the door showed that he came from beyond the circle of\r\ninfluence of the name of Charnock Poynsett.  She longed to assume\r\nthe reins, if not to lay the whip about his ears; but all she could\r\ndo was to try to lessen the force of the jolts by holding up the\r\ngirl, as the horse was savagely beaten, and the carriage so swayed\r\nfrom side to side that she began to think it would be well if there\r\nwere not three cases for the Infirmary instead of one.  To talk to\r\nthe girl or learn her wishes was not possible, among the moans and\r\ncries caused by the motion; and it was no small relief to be safely\r\nat the Infirmary door, though there was no release till after a\r\nfierce altercation with the driver, who first denied, and then\r\nlaughed to scorn the ample fare he had received, so that had any\r\npoliceman been at hand, the porter and house surgeon would have\r\ngiven him in charge, but they could only take his number and let him\r\ndrive off in a fury.\r\n\r\nPoor Fanny was carried away fainting to the accident ward, and\r\nRosamond found it would be so long before she would be visible\r\nagain, that it would be wiser to go home and send in her relations,\r\nbut there was not a fly or cab left in Wil\'sbro\', and there was\r\nnothing for it but to walk.\r\n\r\nShe found herself a good deal shaken, and walked fast because thus\r\nher limbs did not tremble so much, while the glaring September\r\nafternoon made her miss the parasol she had left in the carriage,\r\nand find little comfort in the shadeless erection on her head.  It\r\nwas much further than she had walked for a long time past, and she\r\nhad begun to think she had parted with a good deal of her strength\r\nbefore the Compton woods grew more defined, or the church tower came\r\nany nearer.\r\n\r\nThough the lane to the Reynolds\' colony was not full in her way, she\r\nwas glad to sit down in the shade to speak to old Betty, who did not\r\ncomport herself according to either extreme common to parents in\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n"So Fanny, she be in the \'firmary, be her?  I\'m sure as \'twas very\r\ngood of the young Squire and you, my lady; and I\'m sorry her\'s bin\r\nand give you so much trouble."\r\n\r\nEverybody was harvesting but the old woman, who had the inevitable\r\nbad leg.  All men and beasts were either in the fields or at the\r\nraces, and Rosamond, uncertain whether her patient was not in a\r\ndying state, rejoiced in her recent acquisition of a pony carriage,\r\nand speeding home with renewed energy, roused her \'parson\'s man\'\r\nfrom tea in his cottage, and ordered him off to take Betty Reynolds\r\nto see her daughter without loss of time.\r\n\r\nThen at length she opened her own gate and walked in at the drawing-\r\nroom window.  Terry started up from the sofa, and Anne from a chair\r\nby his side, exclaiming at her appearance, and asking if there had\r\nbeen any accident.\r\n\r\n"Not to any of us, but to a poor woman whom I have been taking to\r\nthe Infirmary," she said, sinking into a low chair.  "Where\'s\r\nJulius?"\r\n\r\n"He went to see old George Willett," said Anne.  "The poor old man\r\nhas just heard of the death of his daughter at Wil\'sbro\'."\r\n\r\n"And you came to sit with this boy, you good creature.  How are you,\r\nmaster?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, better, thanks," he said, with a weary stretch.  "How done up\r\nyou look, Rose!  How did you come?"\r\n\r\n"I walked from Wil\'sbro\'."\r\n\r\n"Walked!" echoed both her hearers.\r\n\r\n"Walked!  I liked my two legs better than the four of the horse that\r\nbrought me there, though \'twasn\'t his fault, poor beast, but the\r\nbrute of a driver, whom we\'ll have up before the magistrate.  I\'ve\r\ngot the name; doing his best to dislocate every bone in the poor\r\nthing\'s body.  Well, and I hope baby didn\'t disturb you?"\r\n\r\n"Baby has been wonderfully quiet.  Julius went to see after her\r\nonce, but she was out."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go and see the young woman, and then come and tell my story."\r\n\r\nBut Rosamond came back almost instantly, exclaiming, "Emma must have\r\ntaken the baby to the Hall.  I wish she would be more careful.  The\r\nsun is getting low, and there\'s a fog rising."\r\n\r\n"She had not been there when I came down an hour ago," said Anne;\r\n"at least, not with Mrs. Poynsett.  They may have had her in the\r\nhousekeeper\'s room.  I had better go and hasten her home."\r\n\r\nJulius came in shortly after, but before he had heard the tale of\r\nFanny Reynolds, Anne had returned to say that neither child nor\r\nnurse had been at the Hall, nor passed the large gate that morning.\r\nIt was growing rather alarming.  The other servants said Emma had\r\ntaken the baby out as usual in the morning, but had not returned to\r\ndinner, and they too had supposed her at the Hall.  None of the\r\ndependants of the Hall in the cottages round knew anything of her,\r\nbut at last Dilemma Hornblower imparted that she had seen my lady\'s\r\nbaby\'s green cloak atop of a tax-cart going towards Wil\'sbro\'.\r\n\r\nNow Emma had undesirable relations, and Rosamond had taken her in\r\nspite of warning that her uncle was the keeper of the \'Three\r\nPigeons.\'  The young parents stood looking at one another, and\r\nRosamond faintly said, "If that girl has taken her to the races!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m more afraid of that fever in Water Lane," said Julius.  "I have\r\na great mind to take the pony carriage and see that the girl does\r\nnot take her there."\r\n\r\n"Oh!  I sent it with Betty Reynolds," cried Rosamond in an agony.\r\n\r\n"At that moment the Hall carriage came dashing up, and as Raymond\r\nsaw the three standing in the road, he called to the coachman to\r\nstop, for he and his friend were now within, and Cecil leaning back,\r\nlooking much tired.  Raymond\'s eager question was what Rosamond had\r\ndone with her charge.\r\n\r\n"Left her at the Infirmary;--but, oh! you\'ve not seen baby?"\r\n\r\n"Seen--seen what! your baby?" asked Raymond, as if he thought\r\nRosamond\'s senses astray, while his bachelor friend was ready to\r\nlaugh at a young mother\'s alarms, all the more when Julius answered,\r\n"It is too true; the baby and her nurse have not been seen here\r\nsince ten o\'clock; and we are seriously afraid the girl may have\r\nbeen beguiled to those races.  There is a report of the child\'s\r\ncloak having been seen on a tax-cart."\r\n\r\n"Then it was so," exclaimed Cecil, starting forward.  "I saw a\r\nbaby\'s mantle of that peculiar green, and it struck me that some\r\nfarmer\'s wife had been aping little Julia\'s."\r\n\r\n"Where?  When?" cried Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"They passed us, trying to find a place.  I did not show it to you\r\nfor you were talking to those gentlemen."\r\n\r\n"Did you see it, Brown?" asked Julius, going towards the coachman.\r\n"Our baby and nurse, I mean."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell about Miss Charnock, sir," said the coachman, "but I\r\ndid think I remarked two young females with young Gadley in a tax-\r\ncart.  I would not be alarmed, sir, nor my lady," he added, with the\r\nfreedom of a confidential servant, who, like all the household,\r\nadored Lady Rosamond.  "It was a giddy thing in the young woman to\r\nhave done; and no place to take the young lady to.  But there--there\r\nwere more infants there than a man could count, and it stands to\r\nreason they come to no harm."\r\n\r\n"The most sensible thing that has been said yet," muttered the\r\nfriend; but Rosamond was by no means pacified.  "Gadley\'s cart!\r\nThey\'ll go to that horrid public-house in Water Lane where there\'s\r\ntyphus and diphtheria and everything; and there\'s this fog--and that\r\ngirl will never wrap her up.  Oh! why did I ever go?"\r\n\r\n"My dear Rose," said Julius, trying to speak with masculine\r\ncomposure, "this is nonsense.  Depend upon it, Emma is only anxious\r\nto get her home."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, I don\'t know!  If she could take her to the races,\r\nshe would be capable of taking her anywhere!  They all go and drink\r\nat that beer-shop, and catch--Julius, the pony carriage!  Oh! it\'s\r\ngone!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Julius in explanation.  "She sent Betty Reynolds into\r\nWil\'sbro\' in it."\r\n\r\n"Get in, Rosamond," cried Cecil, "we will drive back till we find\r\nher."\r\n\r\nBut this was more than a good coachman could permit for his horses\'\r\nsake, and Brown declared they must be fed and rested before the\r\nball.  Cecil was ready to give up the ball, but still they could not\r\nbe taken back at once; and Rosamond had by this time turned as if\r\nsetting her face to walk at once to the race-ground until she found\r\nher child, when Raymond said, "Rose! would you be afraid to trust to\r\nKing Coal and me?  I would put him in at once and drive you till you\r\nfind Julia."\r\n\r\n"Oh!  Raymond, how good you are!"\r\n\r\nThe coachman, glad of this solution, only waited to pick up Anne,\r\nand hurried on his horses, while the bachelor friend could not help\r\ngrunting a little, and observing that it was plain there was only\r\none child in the family, and that he would take any bet \'it\' was at\r\nhome all right long before Poynsett reached the parsonage.\r\n\r\n"Maybe so," said Raymond, "but I would do anything rather than leave\r\nher mother in the distress you take so easily."\r\n\r\n"Besides, there\'s every chance of her being taken to that low\r\npublic-house," said Cecil.  "One that Mr. Poynsett would not allow\r\nour servants to go to during the bazaar, though it is close to the\r\ntown-hall, and all the others did."\r\n\r\n"Let us hope that early influence may prevent contamination,"\r\nsolemnly said the friend.\r\n\r\nCecil turned from him.  "I still hope she may be at home," she said;\r\n"it is getting very chill and foggy.  Raymond, I hope you may not\r\nhave to go."\r\n\r\n"You must lie down and get thoroughly rested," he said, as he helped\r\nher out; and only waiting to equip himself for the evening dance, he\r\nhurried to the stables to expedite the harnessing of the powerful\r\nand fiery steed which had as yet been only experimentally driven by\r\nhimself and the coachman.\r\n\r\nRosamond was watching, and when King Coal was with difficulty pulled\r\nup, she made but one spring to the seat of the dog-cart; and Julius,\r\nwho was tucking in the rug, had to leap back to save his foot, so\r\ninstantaneous was the dash forward.  They went like the wind,\r\nRosamond not caring to speak, and Raymond had quite enough on his\r\nhands to be glad not to be required to talk, while he steered\r\nthrough the numerous vehicles they met, and she scanned them\r\nanxiously for the outline of Emma\'s hat.  At last they reached\r\nWil\'sbro\', where, as they came to the entrance of Water Lane,\r\nRosamond, through the hazy gaslight, declared that she saw a tax-\r\ncart at the door of the \'Three Pigeons,\' and Raymond, albeit\r\nuncertain whether it were _the_ tax-cart, could only turn down the\r\nlane at her bidding, with difficulty preventing King Coal from\r\nrunning his nose into the vehicle.  Something like an infant\'s cry\r\nwas heard through the open door, and before he knew what she was\r\nabout, Rosamond was on the pavement and had rushed into the house;\r\nand while he was signing to a man to take the horse\'s head, she was\r\nout again, the gaslight catching her eyes so that they glared like a\r\ntigress\'s, her child in her arms, and a whole Babel of explaining\r\ntongues behind her.  How she did it neither she nor Raymond ever\r\nknew, but in a second she had flown to her perch, saying hoarsely,\r\n"Drive me to Dr. Worth\'s.  They were drugging her.  I don\'t know\r\nwhether I was in time.  No, not a word"--(this to those behind)--\r\n"never let me see any of you again."\r\n\r\nKing Coal prevented all further words of explanation by dancing\r\nround, so that Raymond was rejoiced at finding that nobody was run\r\nover.  They were off again instantly, while Rosamond vehemently\r\nclasped the child, which was sobbing out a feeble sound, as if quite\r\nspent with crying, but without which the mother seemed dissatisfied,\r\nfor she moved the poor little thing about if it ceased for a moment.\r\nThey were soon within Dr. Worth\'s iron gates, where Raymond could\r\ngive the horse to a servant, help his sister-in-law down, and speak\r\nfor her; for at first she only held up the phial she had clutched,\r\nand gazed at the doctor speechlessly.\r\n\r\nHe looked well both at the bottle and the baby while Raymond spoke,\r\nand then said, "Are you sure she took any, Lady Rosamond?"\r\n\r\n"Quite, quite sure!" cried Rosamond.  "The spoon was at her lips,\r\nthe dear little helpless darling!"\r\n\r\n"Well, then," said the doctor, dryly, "it only remains to be proved\r\nwhether an aristocratic baby can bear popular treatment.  I dare say\r\nsome hundred unlucky infants have been lugged out to the race-course\r\nto-day, and come back squalling their hearts out with fatigue and\r\nhunger, and I\'ll be bound that nine-tenths are lulled with this very\r\nsedative, and will be none the worse."\r\n\r\n"Then you do not think it will hurt her?"\r\n\r\n"So far from it, that, under the circumstances, it was the best\r\nthing she could have.  She has plainly been exhausted, and though I\r\nwould not exactly recommend the practice in your nursery, I doubt if\r\nshe could have taken nourishment till she had been composed.  She\r\nwill sleep for an hour or two, and by that time you can get her\r\nhome, and feed her as usual.  I should be more anxious about Lady\r\nRosamond herself," he added, turning to Raymond.  "She looks\r\ncompletely worn out.  Let me order you a basin of soup."\r\n\r\nBut Rosamond would not hear of it, she must get baby home directly.\r\nRaymond advised a fly, but it was recollected that none was\r\nattainable between the races and the ball, so the little one was\r\nmuffled in shawls and cloaks almost to suffocation, and the doctor\r\nforced a glass of wine on her mother, and promised to look in the\r\nnext day.  Still they had a delay at the door, caused by the\r\npenitent Emma and her aunt, bent on telling how far they had been\r\nfrom intending any harm; how Emma, when carrying the baby out, had\r\nbeen over-persuaded by the cousins she had never disappointed\r\nbefore; how they had faithfully promised to take her home early,\r\nlong before my lady\'s return; how she had taken baby\'s bottle, but\r\nhow it had got broken; how impossible it had been to move off the\r\nground in the throng; and how the poor baby\'s inconsolable cries had\r\ncaused the young nurse to turn aside to see whether her aunt could\r\nfind anything to prevent her from screaming herself into\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\nNothing but the most determined volubility on Mrs. Gadley\'s part\r\ncould have poured this into the ears of Raymond; Rosamond either\r\ncould not or would not heed, pushed forward, past the weeping Emma,\r\nand pulled away her dress with a shudder, when there was an attempt\r\nto draw her back and make her listen.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, girl," said Raymond.  "Don\'t you see that Lady Rosamond\r\ncan\'t attend to you?  If you have anything to say, you must come\r\nanother time.  You\'ve done quite enough mischief for the present."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the doctor, "tell your brother to put them both to bed,\r\nand keep them quiet.  I should like to prescribe the same for you,\r\nMr. Poynsett; you don\'t look the thing, and I suppose you are going\r\nto take the ball by way of remedy."\r\n\r\nRaymond thanked the doctor, but was too much employed in enveloping\r\nhis passengers to make further reply.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark, and the fog had turned to misty rain, soft and\r\nstill, but all pervading, and Rosamond found it impossible to hold\r\nup an umbrella as well as to guard the baby, who was the only\r\npassenger not soaked and dripping by the time they were among the\r\nlighted windows of the village.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Raymond!  Raymond!" she then said, in a husky dreamy voice,\r\n"how good and kind you have been.  I know there was something that\r\nwould make you very, very glad!"\r\n\r\n"Is there?" he said.  "I have not met with anything to make me glad\r\nfor a long time past!"\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t seem able to recollect what it was, or even if I ought\r\nto tell," said Rosamond, in the same faint, bewildered voice, which\r\nmade Raymond very glad they were at the gate, where stood Julius.\r\n\r\nBut before Rosamond would descend into her husband\'s arms, she\r\nopened all her child\'s mufflings, saying, "Kiss her, kiss her,\r\nRaymond--how she shall love you!"  And when he had obeyed, and\r\nRosamond had handed the little one down to her father, she pressed\r\nher own wet cheek against his dripping beard and moustache, and\r\nexclaimed, "I\'ll never forget your goodness.  Have you got her safe,\r\nJulius?  I\'ll never, never go anywhere again!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\nThe Pebbles\r\n\r\n\r\nO no, no, no; \'tis true.  Here, take this too;\r\nIt is a basilisk unto mine eye,\r\nKills me to look on\'t.  Let there be no honour,\r\nWhere there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,\r\nWhere there\'s another man.--Cymbeline\r\n\r\nWhen Julius, according to custom, opened his study shutters, at\r\nhalf-past six, to a bright sunrise, his eldest brother stood before\r\nthe window.  "Well, how are they?" he said.\r\n\r\n"All right, thank you; the child woke, had some food, and slept well\r\nand naturally after it; and Rose has been quite comfortable and at\r\nrest since midnight.  You saved us from a great deal, Raymond."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" with a sound of deep relief; "may Julia only turn out as sweet\r\na piece of womanhood as her mother.  Julius, I never understood half\r\nwhat that dear wife of yours was till yesterday."\r\n\r\n"I was forced to cut our gratitude very short," said Julius, laying\r\nhis hand on his brother\'s shoulder.  "You know I\'ve always taken\r\nyour kindness as a matter of course."\r\n\r\n"I should think so," said Raymond, the more moved of the two.  "I\r\ntell you, Julius, that Rosamond was to me the only redeeming element\r\nin the day.  I wanted to know whether you could walk with me to ask\r\nafter that poor girl; I hear she came home one with her\r\ngrandmother."\r\n\r\n"Gladly," said Julius.  "I ought to have gone last night; but what\r\nwith Rose, and the baby, and Terry, I am afraid I forgot\r\neverything."  He disappeared, and presently issued from the front\r\ndoor in his broad hat, while Raymond inquired for Terry.\r\n\r\n"He is asleep now, but he has been very restless, and there is\r\nsomething about him I don\'t like.  Did not Worth say he would come\r\nand look at the baby?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but chiefly to pacify Rosamond, about whom he was the most\r\nuneasy."\r\n\r\n"She is quite herself now; but you look overdone, Raymond.  Have you\r\nhad any sleep?"\r\n\r\n"I have not lain down.  When we came home at four o\'clock, Cecil was\r\nquite knocked up, excited and hysterical.  Her maid advised me to\r\nleave her to her; so I took a bath, and came down to wait for you."\r\n\r\nJulius would have liked to see the maid who could have soothed his\r\nRosamond last night without him!  He only said, however, "Is Frank\r\ncome down?  My mother rather expected him."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he came to the race-ground."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!  He was not with you when you came back, or were we not\r\nsufficiently rational to see him?"\r\n\r\n"Duncombe gave a dinner at the hotel, and carried him off to it.\r\nI\'m mortally afraid there\'s something amiss in that quarter.  What,\r\ndidn\'t you know that Duncombe\'s filly failed?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, I did not."\r\n\r\n"The town was ringing with it.  Beaten out-and-out by Fair Phyllida!\r\na beast that took them all by surprise--nothing to look at--but\r\ncausing, I fancy, a good deal of distress.  They say the Duncombes\r\nwill be done for.  I only wish Frank was clear; but that unhappy\r\nengagement has thrown him in with Sir Harry\'s set, and he was with\r\nthem all day--hardly spoke to me.  To a fellow like him, a veteran\r\nscamp like old Vivian, with his benignant looks, is ten times more\r\ndangerous than men of his own age.  However, having done the damage,\r\nthey seem to have thrown him off.  Miss Vivian would not speak to\r\nhim at the ball."\r\n\r\n"Eleonora!  I don\'t know how to think it!"\r\n\r\n"What you cannot _think_, a Vivian can _do_ and does!" said Raymond,\r\nbitterly.  "My belief is that he was decoyed into being fleeced by\r\nthe father, and now they have done their worst, he is cast off.  He\r\ncame home with us, but sat outside, and I could not get a word out\r\nof him."\r\n\r\n"I hope my mother may."\r\n\r\n"If he be not too far gone for her.  I always did expect some such\r\ntermination, but not with this addition."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand it now--Lena!"\r\n\r\n"I only wonder at your surprise.  The girl has been estranged from\r\nus all for a long time.  If it is at an end, so much the better.  I\r\nonly wish we were none of us ever to see the face of one of them\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nJulius knew from his wife that there were hopes for Raymond, but of\r\ncourse he might not speak, and he was revolving these words, which\r\nhad a vehemence unlike the wont of the speaker, when he was startled\r\nby Raymond\'s saying, "Julius, you were right.  I have come to the\r\nconclusion that no consideration shall ever make me sanction races\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"I am glad," began Julius.\r\n\r\n"You would not be glad if you had seen all I saw yesterday.  You\r\nmust have lent me your eyes, for when you spoke before of the evils,\r\nI thought you had picked up a Utopian notion, and were running a-\r\nmuck with it, like an enthusiastic young clergyman.  For my own part\r\nI can\'t say I ever came across anything offensive.  Of course I know\r\nwhere to find it, as one does wherever one goes, but there was no\r\ncall to run after it; and as we were used to the affair, it was a\r\nmere matter of society--"\r\n\r\n"No, it could never be any temptation to you," said Julius.\r\n\r\n"No, nor to any other reasonable man; and I should add, though\r\nperhaps you might not allow it, that so long as a man keeps within\r\nhis means, he has a right to enhance his excitement and amusement by\r\nbets."\r\n\r\n"Umph!  He has a right then to tempt others to their ruin, and\r\ncreate a class of speculators who live by gambling."\r\n\r\n"You need not go on trying to demolish me.  I was going to say that\r\nI had only thought of the demoralization, from the betting side; but\r\nyesterday it was as if you had fascinated my eyes to look behind the\r\nscenes.  I could not move a step without falling on something\r\nabominable.  Roughs, with every passion up to fever-pitch, ferocity\r\nbarely kept down by fear of the police, gambling everywhere,\r\ninnocent young things looking on at coarseness as part of the humour\r\nof the day, foul language, swarms of vagabond creatures, whose trade\r\nis to minister to the license of such occasions.  I declare that\r\nyour wife was the only being I saw display a spark of any sentiment\r\nhuman nature need not blush for!"\r\n\r\n"Nay, Raymond, I begin to wonder whose is the exaggerated feeling\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"You were not there," was the answer; and they were here interrupted\r\nby crossing the path of the policeman, evidently full of an official\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n"I did not expect to see you so early, sir," he said.  "I was coming\r\nto the Hall to report to you after I had been in to the\r\nsuperintendent."\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"There has been a burglary at Mrs. Hornblower\'s, sir.  If you\r\nplease, sir," to Julius, "when is the Reverend Mr. Bowater expected\r\nhome?"\r\n\r\n"Not before Monday.  Is anything of his taken?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir.  A glass case has been broken open, and a silver cup and\r\noar, prizes for sports at college, I believe, have been abstracted.\r\nAlso the money from the till below; and I am sorry to say, young\r\nHornblower is absconded, and suspicion lies heavy on him.  They do\r\nsay the young man staked heavily on that mare of Captain\r\nDuncombe\'s."\r\n\r\n"You had better go on to the superintendent now," said Raymond.\r\n"You can come to me for a summons if you can find any traces."\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Hornblower, what horror for her! and poor Herbert too who\r\nwould acutely feel this ingratitude.  The blackness of it was beyond\r\nwhat Julius thought probable in the lad, and the discussion of it\r\noccupied the brothers till they reached the Reynolds colony, where\r\nthey were received by the daughter-in-law, a much more civilized\r\nperson than old Betty.\r\n\r\nAfter Fanny\'s dislocated arm had been set, the surgeon had sent her\r\nhome in the Rectory carriage, saying there was so much fever in\r\nWil\'sbro\', that she would be likely to recover better at home; but\r\nshe had been suffering and feverish all night, and Dan Reynolds was\r\nnow gone in quest of \'Drake,\' for whom she had been calling all\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n"Is he her husband?" asked Julius.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know, sir; leastways, Granny says he ought to be\r\nanswerable for what\'s required."\r\n\r\nMrs. Reynolds further betrayed that the family had not been ignorant\r\nof Fanny\'s career since she had run away from home, leaving her\r\nchild on her grandmother\'s hands.  She had made her home in one of\r\nthe yellow vans which circulate between fairs and races, driving an\r\nostensible trade in cheap toys, but really existing by setting up\r\ngames which were, in fact, forms of gambling, according to the taste\r\nof the people and the toleration of the police.  From time to time,\r\nshe had appeared at home, late in the evening, with small sums of\r\nmoney and presents for her boy; and Mrs. Dan believed that she\r\nthought herself as good as married to \'that there Drake.\'  She was\r\nreported to be asleep, and the place \'all of a caddle,\' and Julius\r\npromised to call later in the day.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Mrs. Reynolds; "it would be a right good thing,\r\npoor girl.  She\'ve a kind heart, they all do say; not as I know, not\r\ncoming here till she was gone, nor wanting to know much on her, for\r\n\'twas a right bad way she was in, and \'twere well if them nasty\r\nraces were put down by Act of Parliament, for they be the very ruin\r\nof the girls in these parts."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a new suggestion, Raymond," said Julius as he shut the\r\ngarden gate.\r\n\r\nRaymond was long in answering, and when he spoke, it was to say, "I\r\nshall withdraw from the subscription to the Wil\'sbro\' Cup."\r\n\r\n"So much the better."\r\n\r\nThen Raymond began discussing the terms of the letter in which he\r\nwould state his reasons, but with an amount of excitement that made\r\nJulius say, "I should think it better not to write in this first\r\nheat.  It will take more effect if it is not so visibly done on the\r\nspur of the moment."\r\n\r\nBut the usually deliberate Raymond exclaimed, "I cannot rest till it\r\nis done.  I feel as if I must be like Lady Macbeth, continually\r\nwashing my hands of all this wreck and ruin."\r\n\r\n"No wonder; but I should think there was great need of caution--to\r\nuse your own words."\r\n\r\n"My seat must go, if this is to be the price," said Raymond.  "I\r\nfelt through all the speeches at that gilt-gingerbread place, that\r\nit was a monument of my truckling to expediency.  We began the whole\r\nthing at the wrong end, and I fear we are beginning to see the\r\neffects."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that you are anxious about that fever in Water Lane?"\r\n\r\n"There was an oppressive sickly air about everything, strongest at\r\nthe ball.  I can\'t forget it," said Raymond, taking off his hat, so\r\nthat the morning air might play about his temples.  "We talked about\r\nmeddling women, but the truth was that they were shaming us by doing\r\nwhat they could."\r\n\r\n"I hope others will see it so.  Is not Whitlock to be mayor next\r\ntime?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  He may do something.  Well, they will hardly unseat me!  I\r\nshould not like to see Moy in my place, and it would be a sore thing\r\nfor my mother; but," he continued, in the same strange, dreamy\r\nmanner, "everything has turned out so wretchedly that I hardly know\r\nor care how it goes."\r\n\r\n"My dear old fellow!"\r\n\r\nRaymond had stopped to lean over a gate, where he could look up to\r\nthe old red house in the green park, set in brightly-tinted trees,\r\nall aglow in the morning sunshine.  Tears had sprung on his cheeks,\r\nand a suppressed sob heaved his chest.  Julius ventured to say,\r\n"Perhaps there may yet be a change of mind."\r\n\r\n"No!" was the answer.  "In the present situation there is nothing\r\nfor it but to sacrifice my last shred of peace to the one who has\r\nthe chief right--in a certain way."\r\n\r\nThey walked on, and he hardly spoke again till, as they reached the\r\nRectory, Julius persuaded him to come in and have a cup of tea; and\r\nthough he said he must go back and see his friend off, he could not\r\nwithstand the sight of Rosamond at the window, fresh and smiling,\r\nwith her child in her arms.\r\n\r\n"Not a bit the worse for her dissipation," she merrily said.  "Oh,\r\nthe naughty little thing!--to have begun with the turf, and then the\r\n\'Three Pigeons\'!  Aren\'t you ashamed of her, papa?  Sit down,\r\nRaymond; how horribly tired you do look."\r\n\r\n"Ha!  What\'s this?" exclaimed Julius, who had been opening the post-\r\nbag.  "Here\'s a note from the Bishop, desiring me to come to the\r\npalace to-day, if possible."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" cried Raymond.  "Where is there vacant--isn\'t there a canonry\r\nor a chaplaincy?"\r\n\r\n"Or an archbishopric or two?" said Julius.  "The pony can do it, I\r\nthink, as there will be a long rest.  If he seems fagged, I can put\r\nup at Backsworth and take a fly."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll let James drive you," said Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"I had rather not," said Julius.  "It may be better to be alone."\r\n\r\n"He is afraid of betraying his elevation to James," laughed\r\nRosamond.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Daniel Reynolds to see you, sir."\r\n\r\nThis was with the information that that there trapezing chap, Drake,\r\nhad fetched off poor Fanny in his van.  He had been in trouble\r\nhimself, having been in custody for some misdemeanour when she was\r\nthrown down; but as soon as he was released, he had come in search\r\nof her, and though at first he seemed willing to leave her to be\r\nnursed at home, he had no sooner heard of the visitors of that\r\nmorning than he had sworn he would have no parson meddling with his\r\npoor gal! she was good enough for him, and he would not have a pack\r\nof nonsense put in her head to set her against him.\r\n\r\n"He\'s good to her, sir," said Mrs. Reynolds, "I think he be; but he\r\nis a very ignorant man.  He tell\'d us once as he was born in one of\r\nthey vans, and hadn\'t never been to school nor nothin\', nor heard\r\ntell of God, save in the way of bad words:  he\'ve done nothin\' but\r\ngo from one races and fairs to another, just like the gipsies,\r\nthough he bain\'t a gipsy neither; but he\'s right down attacted to\r\npoor Fanny, and good to her."\r\n\r\n"Another product of the system," said Raymond.\r\n\r\n"Like the gleeman, whom we see through a picturesque medium," said\r\nJulius; "but who could not have been pleasant to the mediaeval\r\nclergyman.  I have hopes of poor Fanny yet.  She will drift home one\r\nof these days, and we shall get hold of her."\r\n\r\n"What a fellow you are for hoping!" returned Raymond, a little\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" said Julius.\r\n\r\n"Why!  I should say--" replied Raymond, setting out to walk home,\r\nwhere he presided over his friend\'s breakfast and departure, and\r\nreceived a little banter over his solicitude for the precious\r\ninfant.  Cecil was still in bed, and Frank was looking ghastly, and\r\nmoved and spoke like one in a dream, Raymond was relieved to hear\r\nhim pleading with Susan for to his mother\'s room much earlier than\r\nusual.\r\n\r\nSusan took pity and let him in; when at once he flung himself into a\r\nchair, with his face hidden on the bed, and exclaimed, "Mother, it\r\nis all over with me!"\r\n\r\n"My dear boy, what can have happened?"\r\n\r\n"Mother, you remember those two red pebbles.  Could you believe that\r\nshe has sold hers?"\r\n\r\n"Are you sure she has?  I heard that they had a collection of such\r\nthings from the lapidary at Rockpier."\r\n\r\n"No, mother, that is no explanation.  When I found that I should be\r\nable to come down, I sent a card to Lady Tyrrell, saying I would\r\nmeet them on the race-ground--a post-card, so that Lena might see\r\nit.  When I came there was no Lena, only some excuse about resting\r\nfor the ball--lying down with a bad headache, and so forth--making\r\nit plain that I need not go on to Sirenwood.  By and by there was\r\nsome mild betting with the ladies, and Lady Tyrrell said, \'There\'s a\r\nchance for you, Bee; don\'t I see the very fellow to Conny\'s charm?\'\r\nWhereupon that girl Conny pulled out the very stone I gave Lena\r\nthree years ago at Rockpier.  I asked; yes, I asked--Lena had sold\r\nit; Lena, at the bazaar; Lena, who--"\r\n\r\n"Stay, Frank, is this trusting Lena as she bade you trust her?  How\r\ndo you know that there were no other such pebbles?"\r\n\r\n"You have not seen her as I have done.  There has been a gradual\r\nalienation--holding aloof from us, and throwing herself into the\r\narms of those Strangeways.  It is no fault of her sister\'s.  She has\r\nlamented it to me."\r\n\r\n"Or pointed it out.  Did she know the history of these pebbles?"\r\n\r\n"No one did.  Lena was above all reserved with her."\r\n\r\n"Camilla Tyrrell knows a good deal more than she is told.  Where\'s\r\nyour pebble?  You did not stake that?"\r\n\r\n"Those who had one were welcome to the other."\r\n\r\n"O, my poor foolish Frank!  May it not be gone to tell the same tale\r\nof you that you think was told of her?  Is this all?"\r\n\r\n"Would that it were!"\r\n\r\n"Well, go on, my dear.  Was she at the ball?"\r\n\r\n"Surrounded by all that set.  I was long in getting near her, and\r\nthen she said her card was full; and when I made some desperate\r\nentreaty, she said, in an undertone that stabbed me by its very\r\ncalmness, \'After what has passed to-day, the less we meet the\r\nbetter.\'  And she moved away, so as to cut me off from another\r\nword."\r\n\r\n"After what had passed!  Was it the parting with the stone?"\r\n\r\n"Not only.  I got a few words with Lady Tyrrell.  She told me that\r\nearly impressions had given Lena a kind of fanatical horror of\r\nbetting, and that she had long ago made a sort of vow against a\r\nbetting man.  Lady Tyrrell said she had laughed at it, but had no\r\nnotion it was seriously meant; and I--I never even heard of it!"\r\n\r\n"Nor are you a betting man, my Frank."\r\n\r\n"Ay! mother, you have not heard all."\r\n\r\n"You are not in a scrape, my boy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am.  You see I lost my head after the pebble transaction.  I\r\ncouldn\'t stand small talk, or bear to go near Raymond, so I got\r\namong some other fellows with Sir Harry--"\r\n\r\n"And excitement and distress led you on?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what came over me.  I could not stand still for fear I\r\nshould feel.  I must be mad on something.  Then, that mare of\r\nDuncombe\'s, poor fellow, seemed a personal affair to us all; and Sir\r\nHarry, and a few other knowing old hands, went working one up, till\r\nbetting higher and higher seemed the only way of supporting\r\nDuncombe, besides relieving one\'s feelings.  I know it was being no\r\nend of a fool; but you haven\'t felt it, mother!"\r\n\r\n"And Sir Harry took your bets?"\r\n\r\n"One must fare and fare alike," said Frank.\r\n\r\n"How much have you lost?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve lost Lena, that\'s all I know," said the poor boy; but he\r\nproduced his book, and the sum appalled him.  "Mother," he said in a\r\nbroken voice, "there\'s no fear of its happening again.  I can never\r\nfeel like this again.  I know it is the first time one of your sons\r\nhas served you so, and I can\'t even talk of sorrow, it seems all\r\nswallowed up in the other matter.  But if you will help me to meet\r\nit, I will pay you back ten or twenty pounds every quarter."\r\n\r\n"I think I can, Frankie.  I had something in hand towards my own\r\npossible flitting.  Here is the key of my desk.  Bring me my\r\nbanker\'s book and my cheque book."\r\n\r\n"Mother! mother!" he cried, catching her hand and kissing it, "what\r\na mother you are!"\r\n\r\n"You understand," she said, "that it is because I believe you were\r\nnot master of yourself, and that this is the exception, not the\r\nhabit, that I am willing to do all I can for you."\r\n\r\n"The habit!  No, indeed!  I never staked more than a box of gloves\r\nbefore; but what\'s the good, if she has made a vow against me?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett was silent for a few moments, then she said, "My poor\r\nboy, I believe you are both victims of a plot.  I suspect that\r\nCamilla Tyrrell purposely let you see that pebble-token and be\r\ngoaded into gambling, that she might have a story to tell her\r\nsister, when she had failed to shake her constancy and principle in\r\nany other way."\r\n\r\n"Mother, that would make her out a fiend.  She has been my good and\r\ncandid friend all along.  You don\'t know her."\r\n\r\n"What would a friend have done by you yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"She neither saw nor heard my madness.  No, mother, Lenore\'s heart\r\nhas been going from me for months past, and she is glad of this plea\r\nfor release, believing me unworthy.  Oh! that stern face of hers!\r\nset like a head of Justice with not a shade of pity--so beautiful--\r\nso terrible!  It will never cease to haunt me."\r\n\r\nHe sat in deep despondency, while Mrs. Poynsett overlooked her\r\nresources; but presently he started up, saying, "There\'s one shadow\r\nof a hope.  I\'ll go over to Sirenwood, insist on seeing one her and\r\nhaving an explanation.  I have a right, whatever I did yesterday;\r\nand you have forgiven me for that, mother!"\r\n\r\n"I think it is the most hopeful way.  If you can see her without\r\ninterposition, you will at least come to an understanding.  Here,\r\nyou had better take this cheque for Sir Harry."\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone, she wondered whether she had been justified in\r\nencouraging him in defending Eleonora.  Was this not too like\r\nanother form of the treatment Raymond had experienced?  Her heart\r\nbled for her boy, and she was ready to cry aloud, "Must that woman\r\nalways be the destroyer of my sons\' peace?"\r\n\r\nWhen Frank returned, it was with a face that appalled her by its\r\nblank despair, as he again flung himself down beside her.\r\n\r\n"She is gone," he said.\r\n\r\n"Gone!"\r\n\r\n"Gone, and with the Strangeways.  I saw her."\r\n\r\n"Spoke to her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no.  The carriage turned the corner as I crossed the road.  The\r\ntwo girls were there, and she--"\r\n\r\n"Going with them to the station?"\r\n\r\n"I thought so; I went to the house, meaning to leave my enclosure\r\nfor Sir Harry and meet her on her way back; but I heard she was gone\r\nto stay with Lady Susan in Yorkshire.  Sir Harry was not up, nor\r\nLady Tyrrell."\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett\'s hope failed, though she was relieved that Camilla\'s\r\ntongue had not been in action.  She was dismayed at the prone\r\nexhausted manner in which Frank lay, partly on the floor, partly\r\nagainst her couch, with his face hidden.\r\n\r\n"Do you know where she is gone?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Revelrig, Cleveland, Yorkshire."\r\n\r\n"I will write to her.  Whatever may be her intentions, they shall\r\nnot be carried out under any misrepresentation that I can\r\ncontradict.  You have been a foolish fellow, Frankie; but you shall\r\nnot be painted worse than you are.  She owes you an explanation, and\r\nI will do my best that you shall have it.  My dear, what is the\r\nmatter?"\r\n\r\nShe rang her bell hastily, and upheld the sinking head till help\r\ncame.  He had not lost consciousness, and called it giddiness, and\r\nhe was convicted of having never gone to bed last night, and having\r\neaten nothing that morning; but he turned against the wine and soup\r\nwith which they tried to dose him, and, looking crushed and\r\nbewildered, said he would go and lie down in his own room.\r\n\r\nRaymond went up with him, and returned, saying he only wanted to be\r\nalone, with his face from the light; and Mrs. Poynsett, gazing at\r\nher eldest son, thought he looked as ill and sunken as his younger\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\nA Stickit Minister\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the boy not out of him.--TENNYSON\'S Queen Mary\r\n\r\nJulius had only too well divined the cause of his summons.  He found\r\nHerbert Bowater\'s papers on the table before the Bishop, and there\r\nwas no denying that they showed a declension since last year, and\r\nthat though, from men without his advantages they would have been\r\npassable, yet from him they were evidences of neglect of study and\r\nthought.  Nor could the cause be ignored by any one who had kept an\r\neye on the cricket reports in the county paper; but Herbert was such\r\na nice, hearty, innocent fellow, and his father was so much\r\nrespected, that it was with great reluctance that his rejection was\r\ndecided on and his Rector had been sent for in case there should be\r\nany cause for extenuation.\r\n\r\nJulius could not say there was.  He was greatly grieved and\r\npersonally ashamed, but he could plead nothing but his own failure\r\nto influence the young man enough to keep him out of a rage for\r\namusement, of which the quantity, not the quality, was the evil.  So\r\npoor Herbert was sent for to hear his fate, and came back looking\r\nstunned.  He hardly spoke till they were in the fly that Julius had\r\nbrought from Backsworth, and then the untamed school-boy broke\r\nforth:  "What are you doing with me?  I say, I can\'t go back to\r\nCompton like a dog in a string."\r\n\r\n"Where will you go?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care.  To Jericho at once, out of the way of every one.  I\r\ntell you what, Rector, it was the most ridiculous examination I ever\r\nwent up for, and I\'m not the only man that says so.  There was\r\nRivers, of St. Mary\'s at Backsworth,--he says the questions were\r\nperfectly unreasonable, and what no one could be prepared for.  This\r\nfellow Danvers is a new hand, and they are always worst, setting one\r\na lot of subjects of no possible use but to catch one out.  I should\r\nlike to ask him now what living soul at Compton he expects to be the\r\nbetter for my views on the right reading of--"\r\n\r\nJulius interrupted the passionate tones at the lodge by saying, "If\r\nyou wish to go to Jericho, you must give directions."\r\n\r\nHerbert gave something between a laugh and a growl.\r\n\r\n"I left the pony at Backsworth.  Will you come with me to Strawyers\r\nand wait in the park till I send Jenny out to you?"\r\n\r\n"No, I say.  I know my father will be in a greater rage than he ever\r\nwas in his life, and I won\'t go sneaking about.  I\'d like to go to\r\nLondon, to some hole where no one would ever hear of me.  If I were\r\nnot in Orders already, I\'d be off to the ivory-hunters in Africa,\r\nand never be heard of more.  If this was to be, I wish they had\r\nfound it out a year ago, and then I should not have been bound,"\r\ncontinued the poor young fellow, in his simplicity, thinking his\r\nthoughts aloud, and his sweet candid nature beginning to recover its\r\nbalance.  "Now I\'m the most wretched fellow going.  I know what I\'ve\r\nundertaken.  It\'s not your fault, nor poor Joanna\'s.  You\'ve all\r\nbeen at me, but it only made me worse.  What could my father be\r\nthinking of to make a parson of a fellow like me?  Well, I must face\r\nit out sooner or later at Compton, and I had better do it there than\r\nat home, even if my father would have me."\r\n\r\n"I must go to Strawyers.  The Bishop gave me a letter for your\r\nfather, and I think it will break it a little for your mother.\r\nWould you wait for me at Rood House?  You could go into the chapel,\r\nand if they wish for you, I could return and fetch you."\r\n\r\nHerbert caught at this as a relief, and orders were given\r\naccordingly.  It seemed a cruel moment to tell him of young\r\nHornblower\'s evasion and robbery, but the police wanted the\r\ndescription of the articles; and, in fact, nothing would have so\r\nbrought home to him that, though Compton might not appreciate\r\nminutiae of Greek criticism, yet the habit of diligence, of which it\r\nwas the test, might make a difference there.  The lingering self-\r\njustification was swept away by the sense of the harm his pleasure-\r\nseeking had done to the lad whom he had once influenced.  He had\r\nbeen fond and proud of his trophies, but he scarcely wasted a\r\nthought on them, so absorbed was he in the thought of how he had\r\nlorded it over the youth with that late rebuke.  The blame he had\r\nrefused to take on himself then came full upon him now, and he\r\nreproached himself too much to be angered at the treachery and\r\ningratitude.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t prosecute," he said, when Julius asked for the description\r\nhe had promised to procure.\r\n\r\n"We must judge whether it would be true kindness to refrain, if he\r\nis captured," said Julius.  "I had not time to see his mother, but\r\nRosamond will do what she can for her, poor woman."\r\n\r\n"How shall I meet her?" sighed Herbert; and so they arrived at the\r\ntranquil little hospital and passed under the deep archway into the\r\ngray quadrangle, bright with autumn flowers, and so to the chapel.\r\nAs they advanced up the solemn and beautiful aisle Herbert dropped\r\non his knees with his hands over his face.  Julius knelt beside him\r\nfor a moment, laid his hand on the curly brown hair, whispered a\r\nprayer and a blessing, and then left him; but ere reaching the door,\r\nthe low choked sobs of anguish of heart could be heard.\r\n\r\nA few steps more, and in the broad walk along the quadrangle, Julius\r\nmet the frail bowed figure with his saintly face, that seemed to\r\nhave come out of some sacred bygone age.\r\n\r\nJulius told his errand.  "If you could have seen him just now," he\r\nsaid, "you would see how much more hope there is of him than of many\r\nwho never technically fail, but have not the same tender, generous\r\nheart, and free humility."\r\n\r\n"Yes, many a priest might now be thankful if some check had come on\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"And if he had met it with this freedom from bitterness.  And it\r\nwould be a great kindness to keep him here a day or two.  Apart from\r\nbeing with you, the showing himself at Compton or at Strawyers on\r\nSunday would be hard on him."\r\n\r\n"I will ask him.  I will gladly have him here as long as the quiet\r\nmay be good for him.  My nephew, William, will be here till the end\r\nof the Long Vacation, but I must go to St. Faith\'s on Monday to\r\nconduct the retreat."\r\n\r\n"I leave him in your hands then, and will call as I return to see\r\nwhat is settled, and report what his family wish.  I grieve more for\r\nthem than for himself."\r\n\r\nJulius first encountered Jenny Bowater in the village making\r\nfarewell calls.  He stopped the carriage and joined her, and not a\r\nword was needed to tell her that something was amiss.  "You have\r\ncome to tell us something," she said.  "Herbert has failed?"\r\n\r\n"Prayers are sometimes answered as we do not expect," said Julius.\r\n"I believe it will be the making of him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but how will mamma ever bear it!" cried Jenny.\r\n\r\n"We must remind her that it is only a matter of delay, not\r\nrejection," said Julius.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the Bishop sent for me, and asked me to see your father.  It\r\nwas partly from slips in critical knowledge, which betrayed the want\r\nof study, and the general want of thought and progress, and all the\r\nrest of it, in his papers--"\r\n\r\n"Just the fact--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, which a man of less reality and more superficial quickness\r\nmight have concealed by mere intellectual answers, though it might\r\nhave been much worse for him in the end."\r\n\r\n"Where is he?"\r\n\r\n"At Rood House.  Unless your mother wishes for him here, he had\r\nbetter stay there till he can bear to come among us again."\r\n\r\n"Much better, indeed," said Jenny.  "I only hope papa and mamma will\r\nsee how good it is for him to be there.  O, Julius, if he is taking\r\nit in such a spirit, I can think it all right for him; but for them--\r\nfor them, it is very hard to bear.  Nothing ever went wrong with\r\nthe boys before, and Herbert--mamma\'s darling!"  Her eyes were full\r\nof tears.\r\n\r\n"I wish he had had a better Rector," said Julius.\r\n\r\n"No, don\'t say that.  It was not your fault."\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell.  An older man, or more truly a holier man, might\r\nhave had more influence.  We were all in a sort of laissez-aller\r\nstate this autumn, and now comes the reckoning."\r\n\r\n"There\'s papa," said Jenny.  "Had you rather go to him alone, or can\r\nI do any good?"\r\n\r\n"I think I will go alone," said Julius.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowater, who had grown up in a day when examinations were much\r\nless earnest matters, never guessed what brought Julius over, but\r\nsimply thought he had come to wish them good-bye; then believed in\r\nany accident rather than in failure, and finally was exceedingly\r\nangry, and stormed hotly, first at examinations and modern Bishops,\r\nthen at cricket and fine ladies, then at Julius, for not having\r\nlooked after the lad better, and when this was meekly accepted,\r\nindignation took a juster direction, and Herbert\'s folly and\r\nidleness were severely lashed more severely than Julius thought they\r\nquite deserved, but a word of pleading only made it worse.  Have him\r\nhome to take leave?  No, indeed, Mr. Bowater hoped he knew his duty\r\nbetter as father of a family, when a young man had publicly\r\ndisgraced himself.  "I\'ll tell you what, Julius Charnock, if you\r\nwish him to forget all the little impression it may have made, and\r\nbe ready to run after any amount of folly, you\'d make me have him\r\nhome to be petted and cried over by his mother and sisters.  He has\r\nbeen their spoilt pet too long, and I won\'t have him spoilt now.\r\nI\'ll not see him till he has worked enough to show whether there\'s\r\nany real stuff in him."\r\n\r\nMr. Bowater never even asked where his son was, probably taking it\r\nfor granted that he was gone back to Compton; nor did Julius see\r\nJenny again, as she was trying to comfort her mother under the\r\ndreadful certainty that poor dear Herbert was most cruelly treated,\r\nand that the examining chaplain came of a bad stock, and always had\r\nhad a dislike to the family.  It was to be hoped that Mr. Bowater\r\nwould keep to his wise resolution, and not send for Herbert, for\r\nnothing could be worse for him than the sympathy he would have met\r\nwith from her.\r\n\r\nWhat with looking in to report at Rood House and finding Herbert\r\nmost grateful for leave to remain there for a few days, Julius did\r\nnot reach home till long after dark.  Pleasantly did the light greet\r\nhim from the open doorway where his Rosamond was standing.  She\r\nsprang at once into his arms, as if he had been absent a month, and\r\ncried, "Here you are, safe at last!"  Then, as she pulled off his\r\nwraps, "How tired you must be!  Have you had any food?  No--it\'s all\r\nready;" and he could see \'high tea\' spread, and lighted by the first\r\nfire of the season.  "Come and begin!"\r\n\r\n"What, without washing my hands?"\r\n\r\n"You are to do that in the study; it is all ready."  He did not\r\nexactly see why he should be too tired to mount to his dressing-\r\nroom; but he obeyed, not ungratefully, and his chair was ready, his\r\nplate heaped with partridge and his tumbler filled with ale almost\r\nbefore his eyes had recovered the glare of light.  The eagerness and\r\nflutter of Rosamond\'s manner began to make him anxious, and he began\r\nfor the third time the inquiries she had always cut short--"Baby all\r\nright?  Terry better?"\r\n\r\n"Baby--oh yes, a greater duck than ever.  I put her to bed myself,\r\nand she was quite delicious.  Eat, I say; go on."\r\n\r\n"Not unless you eat that other wing."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll help myself then.  You go on.  I don\'t see Herbert, so I\r\nsuppose it is all right.  Where\'s your canonry?"\r\n\r\n"Alas! poor Herbert is plucked.  I had to go round by Strawyers to\r\ntell them."\r\n\r\n"Plucked!  I never heard of such a thing.  I think it is a great\r\nshame such a nice honest fellow should be so ill-used, and when all\r\nhis pretty things have been stolen too!  Do you know, they\'ve taken\r\nup young Hornblower; but his friends have made off with the things,\r\nand they say they are in the melting-pot by this time, and there\'s\r\nno chance of recovering them."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he cares much now, poor fellow.  Did you see Mrs.\r\nHornblower?"\r\n\r\n"No; by the time I could get my hat on she had heard it, poor thing,\r\nand was gone to Backsworth; for he\'s there, in the county gaol; was\r\ntaken at the station, I believe; I don\'t half understand it."\r\n\r\nHer manner was indeed strange and flighty; and though she recurred\r\nto questions about the Ordination and the Bowaters, Julius perceived\r\nthat she was forcing her attention to the answers as if trying to\r\nstave off his inquiries, and he came to closer quarters.  "How is\r\nTerry?  Has Dr. Worth been here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but not till very late.  He says he never was so busy."\r\n\r\n"Rosamond, what is it?  What did he say of Terry?"\r\n\r\n"He said"--she drew a long breath--"he says it is the Water Lane\r\nfever."\r\n\r\n"Terry, my dear--"\r\n\r\nShe held him down with a hand on his shoulder--\r\n\r\n"Be quiet.  Finish your dinner.  Dr. Worth said the great point was\r\nto keep strong, and not be overdone, nor to go into infected air\r\ntired and hungry.  I would not have let you come in if there had\r\nbeen any help for it; and now I\'ll not have you go near him till\r\nyou\'ve made a good meal."\r\n\r\n"You must do the same then.  There, eat that slice, or I won\'t;" and\r\nas she allowed him to place it on her plate, "What does he call it--\r\nnot typhus?"\r\n\r\n"He can\'t tell yet; he does not know whether it is infectious or\r\nonly epidemic; and when he heard how the dear boy had been for days\r\npast at the Exhibition at the town-hall, and drinking lots of iced\r\nwater on Saturday, he seemed to think it quite accounted for.  He\r\nsays there is no reason that in this good air he should not do very\r\nwell; but, oh, Julius, I wish I had kept him from that horrid place.\r\nThey left him in my charge!"\r\n\r\n"There is no reason to distress yourself about that, my Rose.  He\r\nwas innocently occupied, and there was no cause to expect harm.\r\nThere\'s all good hope for him, with God\'s blessing.  Who is with him\r\nnow?"\r\n\r\n"Cook is there now.  Both the maids were so kind and hearty,\r\ndeclaring they would do anything, and were not afraid; and I can\r\nmanage very well with their help.  You know papa had a low fever at\r\nMontreal, and mamma and I nursed him through it, so I know pretty\r\nwell what to do."\r\n\r\n"But how about the baby?"\r\n\r\n"Emma came back before the doctor came, crying piteously, poor\r\nchild, as if she had had a sufficient lesson; so I said she might\r\nstay her month on her good behaviour, and now we could not send her\r\nout of the house.  I have brought the nursery down to the spare\r\nroom, and in the large attic, with plenty of disinfecting fluid, we\r\ncan, as the doctor said, isolate the fever.  He is quiet and sleepy,\r\nand I do not think it will be hard to manage, if you will only be\r\ngood and conformable."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t promise, if that means that you are to do everything and I\r\nnothing.  When did Worth see him?"\r\n\r\n"Not till five o\'clock:  and he would not have come at all, if Anne\r\nhad not sent in some one from the Hall when she saw how anxious I\r\nwas.  He would not have come otherwise; he is so horribly busy, with\r\nlots of cases at Wil\'sboro\'.  Now, if you have done, you may come\r\nand see my boy."\r\n\r\nJulius did see a flushed sleeping face that did not waken at his\r\nentrance; and as his wife settled herself for her watch, he felt as\r\nif he could not leave her after such a day as she had had, but an\r\nindefinable apprehension made him ask whether she would spare him to\r\nrun up to the Hall to see his mother and ask after Raymond, whose\r\nlooks had haunted him all day.  She saw he would not rest otherwise,\r\nand did not show how unwilling was her consent, for though she knew\r\nlittle, her mind misgave her.\r\n\r\nHe made his way into the Hall by the back door, and found his mother\r\nstill in the drawing-room, and Raymond dozing in the large arm-chair\r\nby the fire.  Mrs. Poynsett gave a warning look as Julius bent over\r\nher, but Raymond only opened his eyes with a dreamy gaze, without\r\nspeaking.  "Why, mother, where are the rest?"\r\n\r\n"Poor Frank--I hope it is only the shock and fatigue; but Dr. Worth\r\nwished him to be kept as quiet as possible.  He can\'t bear to see\r\nany one in the room, so that good Anne said she would sit in\r\nCharlie\'s room close by."\r\n\r\n"Then he is really ill?" said Julius.\r\n\r\n"He nearly fainted after walking over to Sirenwood in vain.  I don\'t\r\nunderstand it.  There\'s something very wrong there, which seems\r\nperfectly to have crushed him."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go up and see him," said Julius.  "You both of you look as if\r\nyou ought to be in bed.  How is Cecil, Raymond?"\r\n\r\n"Quite knocked up," he sleepily answered.  "Here\'s Susan, mother."\r\n\r\nSusan must have been waiting till she heard voices to carry off her\r\nmistress.  Raymond pushed her chair into her room, bent over her\r\nwith extra tenderness, bade her good night; and when Julius had done\r\nthe same they stood by the drawing-room fire together.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been trying to write that letter, Julius," said Raymond, "but\r\nI never was so sleepy in my life, and I can\'t get on with it."\r\n\r\n"What letter?"\r\n\r\n"That letter.  About the races."\r\n\r\n"Oh!  That seems long ago!"\r\n\r\n"So it does," said Raymond, in the same dreamy manner, as if trying\r\nto shake something off.  "Some years, isn\'t it?  I wanted it done,\r\nsomehow.  I would sit down to it now, only I have fallen asleep a\r\ndozen times over it already."\r\n\r\n"Not very good for composition," said Julius, alarmed by something\r\nindefinable in his brother\'s look, and by his manner of insisting on\r\nwhat was by no means urgent.  "Come, put it out of your head, and go\r\nto bed."\r\n\r\n"How did you find the boy Terry?" asked Raymond, again as if in his\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n"I scarcely saw him.  He was asleep."\r\n\r\n"And Worth calls it--?"\r\n\r\n"The same fever as in Water Lane."\r\n\r\n"I thought so.  We are in for it," said Raymond, now quite awake.\r\n"He did not choose to say so to my mother, but I gathered it from\r\nhis orders."\r\n\r\n"But Frank only came down yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Frank was knocked down and predisposed by the treatment he met\r\nwith, poor boy.  They say he drank quarts of iced things at the\r\ndinner and ball, and ate nothing.  This may be only the effect of\r\nthe shock, but his head is burning, and there is a disposition to\r\nwander.  However, he has had his coup de grace, and that may account\r\nfor it.  It is Cecil."\r\n\r\n"Cecil!"\r\n\r\n"Cecil, poor child.  She has been constantly in that pestiferous\r\nplace.  All Worth would say was that she must be kept quiet and\r\ncool, but he has sent the same draughts for all three.  I saw, for\r\nTerry\'s came here.  I fancy Worth spoke out plainly to that maid of\r\nCecil\'s, Grindstone; but she only looks bitter at me, says she can\r\nattend to her mistress, and has kept me out of the room all day.\r\nBut I will go in to-night before I go to bed," added Raymond,\r\nenergetically.  "You are ready to laugh at me, Julius.  No one has\r\nmeddled between you and Rosamond."\r\n\r\n"Thank God, no!" cried Julius.\r\n\r\n"Friend abroad, or you may leave out the r," said Raymond, "maid at\r\nhome.  What chance have I ever had?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what I should do, Raymond," said Julius, "turn out\r\nthe maid, keep the field, nurse her myself."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Raymond, "that\'s all very well if--if you haven\'t got\r\nthe fever yourself.  There, you need say nothing about it, nobody\r\nwould be of any use to me to-night, and it may be only that I am\r\ndead beat."\r\n\r\nBut there was something about his eyes and his heavy breath which\r\nconfirmed his words, and Julius could only say, "My dear Raymond!"\r\n\r\n"It serves us right, does not it?" said his brother, smiling.  "I\r\nonly wish it had not fixed on the one person who tried to do good."\r\n\r\n"If I could only stay with you; but I must tell Rosamond first."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed.  I want no one to-night, no one; after that you\'ll look\r\nafter my mother, that\'s the great thing."  He spoke steadily, but\r\nhis hand trembled so that he could not light his candle, and Julius\r\nwas obliged to do it, saying wistfully, "I\'ll come up the first\r\nthing in the morning and see how you are."\r\n\r\n"Do, and if there is need, you will tell my mother.  A night\'s rest\r\nmay set me right, but I have not felt well these three or four days--\r\nI shall be in my own old room."\r\n\r\nHe leant heavily on the balusters, but would not take his brother\'s\r\narm.  He passed into his dressing-room, and thus to the open door of\r\nthe room where he heard his wife\'s voice; and as Mrs. Grindstone\r\ncame forward to warn him off, he said, "She is awake."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; but she must not be excited."\r\n\r\n"Raymond!"\r\n\r\n"How are you now?" he asked, coming up to the bed.\r\n\r\n"Oh! it is very hot and heavy," said Cecil wearily, putting her hand\r\ninto his; "I\'m aching all over."\r\n\r\n"Poor child!" he said softly.\r\n\r\nShe lifted her eyes to his face.  "I wanted to tell you all day,"\r\nshe said.  "Didn\'t you come to the door?"\r\n\r\n"Many times, my dear."\r\n\r\n"And now! oh dear!  I don\'t recollect.  Don\'t go, please."\r\n\r\nHe sat down by her; she held his hand and dozed again.\r\n\r\n"You had best leave her now, sir," said the maid; "she will only go\r\non in this way, and I can tend her."\r\n\r\nHe would have given a great deal to have been sure that he could\r\nhold up his head ten minutes longer and to venture to send the woman\r\naway.  Cecil muttered "Stay," and he sat on till her sleep seemed\r\ndeeper, and he felt as if a few moments more might disable him from\r\ncrossing the room, but his first movement again made her say\r\n"Don\'t."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Poynsett cannot stay, ma\'am," said Grindstone, in a persuasive\r\ntone.  "He is very tired, and not well, and you would not wish to\r\nkeep him."\r\n\r\n"Give me a kiss," she said, like a tired child.  It was not like the\r\nshy embrace with which they had sometimes met and parted, but he\r\nknew he must not rouse her, and only said very low, "Good night, my\r\npoor dear; God bless you, and grant us a happy meeting, whenever it\r\nis."\r\n\r\nTears were flowing down his cheeks when Julius presently came to him\r\nagain, and only left him when settled for the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER, XXVII\r\nThe Water Lane Fever\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Water Lane Fever.  People called it so, as blinking its real\r\nname, but it was not the less true that it was a very pestilence in\r\nthe lower parts of Wil\'sbro\'; and was prostrating its victims far\r\nand wide among the gentry who had resorted to the town-hall within\r\nthe last few weeks.\r\n\r\nCases had long been smouldering among the poor and the workmen\r\nemployed, and several of these were terminating fatally just as the\r\noutbreak was becoming decisive.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning Julius returned from visits to his brothers to\r\nfind a piteous note from Mrs. Fuller entreating him to undertake two\r\nfunerals.  Her husband had broken down on Sunday morning and was\r\nvery ill, and Mr. Driver had merely read the services and then\r\njoined his pupils, whom he had sent away to the sea-side.  He had\r\nnever been responsible for pastoral care, and in justice to them\r\ncould not undertake it now.  "Those streets are in a dreadful\r\nstate," wrote the poor lady, "several people dying; and there is\r\nsuch a panic in the neighbourhood that we know not where to turn for\r\nhelp.  If you could fix an hour we would let the people know.  The\r\ndoctor insists on the funerals being immediate."\r\n\r\nJulius was standing in the porch reading this letter, and thinking\r\nwhat hour he could best spare from nearer claims, when he heard the\r\ngate swing and beheld his junior curate with a very subdued and\r\nsobered face, asking, "Is it true?"\r\n\r\n"That the fever is here?  Yes, it is."\r\n\r\n"And very bad?"\r\n\r\n"Poor Frank is our worst case as yet.  He is constantly delirious.\r\nThe others are generally sensible, except that Terry is dreadfully\r\nhaunted with mathematics."\r\n\r\n"Then it is all true about the Hall.  Any one else ill?"\r\n\r\n"Only the two Willses.  They were carousing at the \'Three Pigeons.\'\r\nI hope that Raymond\'s prohibition against that place may have been\r\nthe saving of the Hall servants.  See here," and he gave the note.\r\n\r\n"I had better take those two funerals.  I can at least do that,"\r\nsaid Herbert.  "That Driver must be a regular case of a hireling."\r\n\r\n"He never professed that the sheep were his," said Julius.\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll go to the Vicarage and get a list of the sick, and see\r\nafter them as far as I can," said Herbert, in a grave, humble tone,\r\nshowing better than a thousand words how he felt the deprivation he\r\nhad brought on himself; and as to shame or self-consciousness, the\r\nneed had swallowed them all.\r\n\r\n"It will be a great act of kindness, Herbert.  The point of\r\ninfection does not seem clear yet, but I am afraid it will be a\r\nserious outbreak."\r\n\r\n"I did not believe it could all be true when the report came to Rood\r\nHouse, but of course I came to hear the truth and see what I could\r\ndo.  How is Mrs. Poynsett bearing up?"\r\n\r\n"Bravely.  Anne contrived our carrying her up-stairs, and it is the\r\ngreatest comfort to Raymond to lie and look at her, and Susan looks\r\nafter them both."\r\n\r\n"Then he can\'t be so very ill."\r\n\r\n"Not so acutely, but there are symptoms that make Worth anxious.\r\nShall I give you a note for Mrs. Fuller?"\r\n\r\n"Do, and put me at your disposal for all you can spare for, or I can\r\ndo.  Have you written to Bindon?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know where, within some hundred miles.  But, Herbert, I\r\nthink we ought to undertake the help that is wanted at Wil\'sbro\'.\r\nSmith of Duddingstone is too weakly, and poor old Mr. Moulden\r\nneither could nor would.  We are the nearest, and having it here\r\nalready, do not run the risk of spreading it.  As things are, I\r\ncannot be very long away from home, but I would come in for an hour\r\nor so every day, if you could do the rest."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that was what I meant," said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Worth says the best protection is never to go among the sick hungry\r\nor exhausted.  He says he keeps a biscuit in his pocket to eat\r\nbefore going into a sick house.  I shall make Rosamond keep you\r\nsupplied, and you must promise to use them."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I promise."\r\n\r\n"And never drink anything there.  There is to be a public meeting\r\nto-morrow, to see whether the cause of this outbreak is not\r\ntraceable to the water down there."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Duncombe\'s meddling?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t judge without evidence.  But it does seem as if the water at\r\nthe well at Pettitt\'s houses had done much of the harm.  Terry was\r\ndrinking it all that hot day, and to-day we hear that Lady Tyrrell\r\nand two of the servants are ill, besides poor little Joe Reynolds."\r\n\r\n"It is very terrible," said Herbert.  "Lady Tyrrell, did you say?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  She was there constantly, like Raymond\'s wife.  Happily there\r\nis not much fear for your people, Herbert.  Your father was at the\r\ndinner, but he is not a water drinker, and Jenny only just came to\r\nthe bazaar, that was all.  Edith happily gave up the ball."\r\n\r\n"I know," said Herbert, colouring.  "Jenny persuaded her to give it\r\nup because of--me.  Oh, how I have served them all!"\r\n\r\n"I told Jenny that perhaps her Ember prayers had been met in the\r\ntrue way."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Herbert.  "I can\'t understand now how I could have been\r\nsuch an audacious fool as to present myself so coolly after the year\r\nI had spent.  God forgive me for it!  Rector, thank you for leaving\r\nme at Rood House.  It was like having one\'s eyes opened to a new\r\nlife.  I say, do you know anything about Harry Hornblower?  Is he\r\ncome home?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  You wouldn\'t prosecute?"\r\n\r\n"Happily I couldn\'t.  The things were gone and could not be\r\nidentified, and there was nothing about him.  So, though they had me\r\nover to Backsworth, they could not fall foul of me for refusing to\r\nprosecute.  Have you seen him?"\r\n\r\n"No, I tried, but he had got out of my way.  You\'ve not been there?"\r\nseeing that Herbert had brought back his bag.\r\n\r\n"No; I will not till I come back;" and as he took the note he added,\r\n"Rector, I do beg your pardon with all my might."  Then, after a\r\nstrong clasp of the hand, he sped away with a long, manful,\r\nenergetic stride, which made Julius contrast his volunteer courage\r\nwith the flight of the man who, if not pledged to pastoral care at\r\nWil\'sbro\', still had priestly vows upon him.\r\n\r\nJulius had no scruples about risking this favourite home child.  If\r\nhe thought about it at all, it was to rejoice that Mrs. Bowater was\r\nsafely gone, for he had passed unscathed through scenes at St.\r\nAwdry\'s that would have made his mother tremble, and he had little\r\nfear of contagion, with reasonable care.  Of course the doctors had\r\nthe usual debate whether the fever were infectious or epidemic, but\r\nit made little difference.  The local ones, as well as an authority\r\nfrom London, had an inspection previous to the meeting, which took\r\nplace in the school, whose scholars were dispersed in the panic.  No\r\nladies were admitted.  "We have had enough of them," quoted\r\nWorshipful Mayor Truelove.  Mr. Briggs, the ex-mayor, was at the\r\nbedside of his son, and there were hardly enough present to make\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the disease was in Pettitt\'s well.  The water, though\r\ncold, clear, and sparkling, was affected by noxious gases from the\r\ndrains, and had become little better than poison; the air was not\r\nmuch better, and as several neighbouring houses, some swarming with\r\nlodgers, used this water, the evil was accounted for.  The \'Three\r\nPigeons\' had been an attraction to the servants waiting with their\r\nladies\' carriages during the entertainments, and though they had not\r\nmeddled much with the simple element, spirits had not neutralized\r\nthe mischief.  Thence too had come water for the tea and iced\r\nbeverages used at the bazaar and ball.  Odours there had been in\r\nplenty from the untouched drainage of the other houses, and these,\r\nno doubt, enhanced the evil; but every one agreed that the bad\r\nmanagement of the drains on Mr. Pettitt\'s property had been the main\r\nagency in the present outbreak.\r\n\r\nThe poor little perfumer had tears of grief and indignation in his\r\neyes, but he defended his cause and shielded the ladies with\r\nchivalry worthy of his French ancestry.  He said he had striven to\r\ndo his duty as a proprietor, and if other gentlemen had done the\r\nsame, and the channels could have had a free outlet, this misfortune\r\nwould never have occurred.  He found himself backed up by Mr. Julius\r\nCharnock, who rose to declare that what Mr. Pettitt had said was\r\njust what his brother, Mr. Charnock Poynsett, had desired should be\r\nstated as his own opinion, namely, that the responsibility rested,\r\nnot with those who had done all within their power or knowledge for\r\nthe welfare of their tenants, but with those whose indifference on\r\nthe score of health had led them to neglect all sanitary measures.\r\n\r\n"He desires me to say," added Julius, "that being concerned both in\r\nthe neglect and in the unfortunate consequences, he is desirous to\r\nimpress his opinion on all concerned."\r\n\r\nFuture prevention was no longer in the hands of the Town Council,\r\nfor a sanitary commission would take that in hand; but in the\r\nmeantime it was a time of plague and sickness, and measures must be\r\ntaken for the general relief.  Mr. Moy, to whom most of the houses\r\nbelonged, was inquired for; but it appeared that he had carried off\r\nhis wife and daughter on Saturday in terror when one of his servants\r\nhad fallen ill, and even his clerks would not know where to write to\r\nhim till he should telegraph.  The man Gadley was meantime driving\r\nan active trade at the \'Three Pigeons,\' whither the poor, possessed\r\nwith the notion that spirits kept out the infection, were resorting\r\nmore than ever, and he set at defiance all the preventives which\r\ndoctors, overseer, and relieving officer were trying to enforce,\r\nwith sullen oaths against interference.\r\n\r\nTwo deaths yesterday, one to-day, three hourly apprehended; doctors\r\nincessantly occupied, nurses, however unfit, not to be procured by\r\nany exertion of the half-maddened relieving-officer; bread-winners\r\nprostrated; food, wine, bedding, everything lacking.  Such was the\r\nstate of things around the new town-hall of Wil\'sbro\', and the\r\ngentry around were absorbed by cases of the same epidemic in their\r\nown families.\r\n\r\nTo telegraph for nurses from a hospital, to set on foot a\r\nsubscription, appoint a committee of management, and name a\r\ntreasurer and dispenser of supplies, were the most urgent steps.\r\nJulius suggested applying to a Nursing Sisterhood, but Mr. Truelove,\r\nwithout imputing any motives to the reverend gentleman, was\r\nunwilling to insert the thin end of the wedge; so the telegram was\r\nsent to a London Hospital, and Mr. Whitlock, the mayor-elect,\r\nundertook to be treasurer, and to print and circulate an appeal for\r\nsupplies of all sorts.  Those present resolved themselves into a\r\ncommittee, and consulted about a fever hospital, since people could\r\nhardly be expected to recover in the present condition of Water\r\nLane; but nothing was at present ready, and the question was\r\nadjourned to the next day.  As Julius parted with Mr. Whitlock he\r\nmet Herbert Bowater returning from the cemetery in search of him,\r\nwith tidings of some cases where he was especially needed.  As they\r\nwalked on together Mrs. Duncombe overtook them with a basket on her\r\narm.  She held out her hand with an imploring gesture.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Charnock, it can\'t be true, can it?--they only say so out of\r\nignorance--that it was Pettitt\'s well, I mean?"\r\n\r\nIn a few words Julius made it clear what the evil had been and how\r\nit arose.\r\n\r\nShe did not dispute it, she merely grew sallower and said:\r\n\r\n"God forgive us!  We did it for the best.  I planned.  I never\r\nthought of that.  Oh!"\r\n\r\n"My brother insists that the mischief came of not following the\r\nexample you set."\r\n\r\n"And Cecil!"\r\n\r\n"Cecil is too much stupefied to know anything about it."\r\n\r\n"You are helping here?  Make me all the use you can.  Whatever has\r\nto be done give it to me."\r\n\r\n"Nay, you have your family to consider."\r\n\r\n"My boys are at their grandmother\'s.  My husband is gone abroad.\r\nGive me work.  I have brought some wine.  Who needs it most?"\r\n\r\n"Wine?" said Herbert.  "Here?  I was going back for some, but half\r\nan hour may make all the difference to the poor lad in here."\r\n\r\nMrs. Duncombe was within the door in a moment.\r\n\r\n"There has been an execution in her house," said Herbert, as they\r\nwent home.  "That fellow went off on Saturday, and left her alone to\r\nface it."\r\n\r\n"I thought she had striven to keep out of debt."\r\n\r\n"What can a woman do when a man chooses to borrow?  That horse\r\nbrought them to more unexpected smash.  They say that after the\r\nball, where she appeared in all her glory, as if nothing had\r\nhappened, she made Bob give her a schedule of his debts, packed his\r\nportmanteau, sent him off to find some cheap hole abroad, and stayed\r\nto pick up the pieces after the wreck."\r\n\r\n"She is a brave woman," said Julius.\r\n\r\nTherewith they plunged into the abodes of misery, where the only\r\nother helper at present was good old Miss Slater, who was going from\r\none to another, trying to show helpless women how to nurse, but able\r\nonly to contribute infinitesimal grains of aid or comfort at immense\r\ncost to herself.  Julius insisted on taking home with him his\r\ncurate, who had been at work from ten o\'clock that morning till six,\r\nwhen as Julius resigned the pony\'s reins to him, he begged that they\r\nmight go round and inquire at Sirenwood, to which consent was the\r\nmore willingly given because poor Frank\'s few gleams of\r\nconsciousness were spent in sending his indefatigable nurse Anne to\r\nask whether his mother had \'had that letter,\' and in his delirium he\r\nwas always feeling his watch-chain for that unhappy pebble, and\r\nmoaning when he missed it.  Mrs. Poynsett\'s letter had gone on\r\nFriday, and still there was no answer, and this was a vexation,\r\nadding to the fear that the poor fellow\'s rejection had been final.\r\nYet she might have missed the letter by being summoned home.  Close\r\nto the lodge, they overtook Sir Harry, riding dejectedly homewards,\r\nand, glad to be saved going up to the house, they stopped and\r\ninquired for Lady Tyrrell.\r\n\r\n"Very low and oppressed," he said.  "M\'Vie does not give us reason\r\nto expect a change just yet.  Do they tell you the same?  Worth\r\nattends you, I think?"\r\n\r\n"He seems to think it must run on for at least three weeks," said\r\nJulius.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been to the meeting, eh?  Was it that well of Pettitt\'s?\r\nReally that meddling wife of Duncombe\'s ought to be prosecuted.  I\r\nhope she\'ll catch the fever and be served out."\r\n\r\n"She tried to prevent it," said Julius.\r\n\r\n"Pshaw! women have no business with such things, they only put their\r\nfoot in it.  Nobody used to trouble themselves about drains, and one\r\nnever heard of fevers."\r\n\r\nInstead of contesting the point, Julius asked whether Miss Vivian\r\nwere at home.\r\n\r\n"No; that\'s the odd thing.  I wrote, for M\'Vie has no fear of\r\ninfection, and poor Camilla is always calling for her, and that\r\nFrench maid has thought proper to fall ill, and we don\'t know what\r\nto do.  Upper housemaid cut and run in a panic, cook dead drunk last\r\nnight, not a servant in the house to be trusted.  If it were not for\r\nmy man Victor I don\'t know where I should be.  Very odd what that\r\nchild is about.  Lady Susan can\'t be keeping it from her.\r\nUnjustifiable!"\r\n\r\n"She is with Lady Susan Strangeways?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Went with Bee and Conny.  I was glad, for we can\'t afford to\r\ndespise a good match, though I _was_ sorry for your brother."\r\n\r\n"Do I understand you that she is engaged to Mr. Strangeways?"\r\n\r\n"No, no; not yet.  One always hears those things before they are\r\ntrue, and you see they are keeping her from us as if she belonged to\r\nthem already.  I call it unfeeling!  I have just been to the post to\r\nsee if there\'s a letter!  Can\'t be anything wrong in the address,--\r\nRevelrig, Cleveland, Yorkshire."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you telegraph?"\r\n\r\n"I shall, if I don\'t hear to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\nBut the morning\'s telegrams were baffling.  None came in answer to\r\nSir Harry, though he had bidden his daughter to telegraph back\r\ninstantly; and two hospitals replied that they had no nurses to\r\nspare!  This was the first thing Julius heard when he came to the\r\ncommittee-room.  The second was that the only parish nurse had been\r\nfound asleep under the influence of the port-wine intended for her\r\npatients, the third that there were five more deaths, one being Mrs.\r\nGadley, of the \'Three Pigeons,\' from diphtheria, and fourteen more\r\ncases of fever were reported.  Julius had already been with the\r\nschoolmistress, who was not expected to live through the day.  He\r\nhad found that Mrs. Duncombe had been up all night with one of the\r\nmost miserable families, and only when her unpractised hands had\r\ncared for a little corpse, had been forced home by good Miss Slater\r\nfor a little rest.  He had also seen poor Mr. Fuller, who was too\r\nweak and wretched to say anything more than \'God help us, Charnock:\r\nyou will do what you can;\' and when Julius asked for his sanction to\r\nsending for Sisters, he answered, "Anything, anything."\r\n\r\nThe few members who had come to the committee were reduced to the\r\nsame despairing consent, and Julius was allowed to despatch a\r\ntelegram to St. Faith\'s, which had sent Sisters in the emergency at\r\nSt. Awdry\'s.  He likewise brought an offer, suggested by Raymond, of\r\na great old tithe barn, his own property, but always rented by Mrs.\r\nPoynsett, in a solitary field, where the uninfected children might\r\nbe placed under good care, and the houses in Water Lane thus\r\nrelieved.  As to a fever hospital, Raymond had sent his advice to\r\nuse the new town-hall itself.  A word from him went a great way just\r\nthen with the Town Council, and the doctors were delighted with the\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\nFunds and contributions of bedding, clothing, food and wine were\r\ncoming in, but hands were the difficulty.  The adaptations of the\r\ntown-hall and the bringing in of beds were done by one strong\r\ncarpenter and Mrs. Duncombe\'s man Alexander, whom she had brought\r\nwith her, and who proved an excellent orderly; and the few who would\r\nconsent, or did not resist occupying the beds there, were carried in\r\nby Herbert Bowater and a strapping young doctor who had come down\r\nfor this fever pasture.  There Mrs. Duncombe and Miss Slater\r\nreceived them.  No other volunteer had come to light willing to\r\nplunge into this perilous and disgusting abyss of misery; and among\r\nthe afflicted families the power of nursing was indeed small.\r\n\r\nHowever, the healthy children were carried away without much\r\nresistance, and established in the great barn under a trustworthy\r\nwidow; and before night, two effective-looking Sisters were in\r\ncharge at the hospital.\r\n\r\nStill, however, no telegram, no letter, came from Eleonora Vivian.\r\nMr. M\'Vie had found a nurse for Lady Tyrrell, but old Sir Harry rode\r\nin to meet every delivery of the post, and was half distracted at\r\nfinding nothing from her; and Frank\'s murmurs of her name were most\r\npiteous to those who feared that, if he were ever clearly conscious\r\nagain, it would only be to know how heavy had been the meed of his\r\nfolly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\nThe Retreat\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat dost thou here, frail wanderer from thy task?--Christian\r\nYear\r\n\r\nEleonora Vivian was trying to fix her attention on writing out the\r\nmeditation she had just heard from Dr. Easterby.\r\n\r\nIt had been a strange time.  All externally was a great hush.  There\r\nwas perfect rest from the tumult of society, and from the harassing\r\nstate of tacit resistance habitual to her.  This was the holy\r\nquietude for which she had longed, yet where was the power to feel\r\nand profit by it?  Did not the peace without only make her hear the\r\nstorm within all the more?\r\n\r\nA storm had truly been raging within ever since Conny Strangeways\r\nhad triumphantly exhibited the prize she had won from Frank Charnock\r\nat the races; and Camilla had taken care that full and undeniable\r\nevidence should prove that this was not all that the young man had\r\nlost upon the Backsworth race-ground.\r\n\r\nLenore might guess, with her peculiarly painful intuition, who had\r\nbeen the tempter, but that did not lessen her severity towards the\r\nvictim.  In her resolution against a betting man, had she not\r\ntrusted Frank too implicitly even to warn him of her vow?  Nay, had\r\nshe not felt him drifting from her all through the season, unjustly\r\nangered, unworthily distrustful, easily led astray?  All the\r\nmisgivings that had fretted her at intervals and then cleared away\r\nseemed to gather into one conviction--Frank had failed her!\r\n\r\nEleonora\'s nature was one to resent before grieving.  Her spirit was\r\ntoo high to break down under the first shock, and she carried her\r\nhead proudly to the ball, betraying by no outward sign the stern\r\ndespair of her heart, as she listened to the gay chatter of her\r\ncompanions, and with unflinching severity she carried out that\r\njudicial reply to Frank which she had already prepared, and then\r\nguarded herself among numerous partners against remonstrance or\r\nexplanation.  It had been all one whirl of bewilderment; Lady\r\nTyrrell tired, and making the girls\' intended journey on the morrow\r\na plea for early departure; and the Strangeways, though dancing\r\nindefatigably, and laughing at fatigue, coming away as soon as they\r\nsaw she really wished it.  All said good night and good-bye\r\ntogether, both to Lady Tyrrell and Sir Harry, and Lenore started at\r\nten o\'clock without having seen either.  Her sense of heroism lasted\r\ntill after the glimpse of Frank on the road.  Her mood was of bitter\r\ndisappointment and indignation.  Frank was given up, but not less so\r\nwere her father, her sister, and the world.  Sir Harry had made\r\nCamilla suffice to him, he did not want her.  He had been the means\r\nof perverting Frank, and Lenore could not see that she need any\r\nlonger be bound for his sake to the life she detested.  In a few\r\nweeks she would be of age, and what would then prevent her from\r\nfinding a congenial home in the Sisterhood, since such kindred could\r\nhave no just claim to her allegiance?  It was the hasty\r\ndetermination of one who had suffered a tacit persecution for three\r\nyears, and was now smarting under the cruellest of blows.  Her lover\r\nperverted, her conditions broken, her pledge gambled away, and all\r\nthis the work of her father and sister!\r\n\r\nConny and Bee thought her grave and more silent than usual, and when\r\nLady Susan met them in London there was no time for thought.\r\nSaturday was spent on a harvest festival at a suburban church, after\r\nwhich the daughters were despatched to their uncle\'s by a late\r\ntrain.  Sunday was spent in the pursuit of remarkable services; and\r\non Monday Lady Susan and Eleonora had gone to St. Faith\'s and the\r\nRetreat began.\r\n\r\nHere was to be the longed-for rest, for which she had thirsted all\r\nthe more through those days of hurry and of religious spectacles, as\r\nshe felt that, be they what they might to their regular attendants,\r\nto her, as an outsider, they could be but sights, into whose spirit\r\nher sick and wearied soul could not enter.\r\n\r\nHere was no outward disturbance, no claim from the world, no\r\nimportunate chatter, only religious services in their quietest, most\r\nunobtrusive form; and Dr. Easterby\'s low tender tones, leading his\r\nsilent listeners to deep heart-searchings, earnest thoughts, and\r\nsteadfast resolutions.\r\n\r\nAh! so no doubt it was with many; but Lena, with book and pen, was\r\ndismayed to find that the one thing she recollected was the\r\nquestion, "Friend, how camest thou in hither?"  After that, she had\r\nonly heard her own thoughts.  Her mind had lapsed into one vague\r\napprehension of the effects of having cut off all communication with\r\nhome, imaginings of Frank\'s despair, relentings of pity, all broken\r\nby dismay at her own involuntary hypocrisy in bringing such thoughts\r\ninto the Retreat.  Had she any right to be there at all?  Was not a\r\nthing that should have been for her peace become to her an occasion\r\nof falling?\r\n\r\nIt was Thursday evening, and on the morrow there would be the\r\nopportunity of private interviews with Dr. Easterby.  She longed for\r\nthe moment, chiefly to free herself from the sense of deception that\r\nhad all this time seemed to vitiate her religious exercises, deafen\r\nher ears, and blow aside her prayers.  There was a touch on her\r\nshoulder, and one of the Sisters who had received the ladies said,\r\ninterrogatively, "Miss Vivian?  The Mother would be obliged if you\r\nwould come to her room."\r\n\r\nThe general hush prevented Lenore from manifesting her extreme\r\nagitation, and she moved with as quiet a step as she could command,\r\nthough trembling from head to foot.  In the room to which she came\r\nstood the Superior and Dr. Easterby, and a yellow telegram-paper lay\r\non the table.\r\n\r\n"My father?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"No," said the Superior, kindly, "it is your sister, who is ill.\r\nHere is the telegram--"\r\n\r\n"Sister Margaret to the Mother Superior, St. Faith\'s, Dearport.\r\nLady Tyrrell has the fever.  Miss Vivian much needed.\r\n\r\n"Wils\'bro, Sept. 26th, 5.30."\r\n\r\n"The fever!"  She looked up bewildered, and the Superior added--\r\n\r\n"You did not know of a fever at Wil\'sbro\'?  Some of our nursing\r\nSisters were telegraphed for, and went down yesterday.  I was sorry\r\nto send Sister Margaret away just when her mother and you are here;\r\nbut she was the only available head, and the need seemed great."\r\n\r\n"I have heard nothing since I left home on Friday," said Eleonora,\r\nhoarsely.  "It is my own fault.  They think I am at Revelrig."\r\n\r\n"Your family do not know you are here?" said the Superior, gravely.\r\n\r\n"It was very wrong," she said.  "This is the punishment.  I must go.\r\nCan I?"\r\n\r\n"Surely, as soon as there is a train," said the Superior, beginning\r\nto look for a Bradshaw; while Dr. Easterby gave Lenore a chair, and\r\nbade her sit down.  She looked up at his kind face, and asked\r\nwhether he had heard of this fever.\r\n\r\n"On Sunday evening, some friends who came out from Backsworth to our\r\nevening service spoke of an outbreak of fever at Wil\'sbro\', and said\r\nthat several of the Charnock family were ill.  I have had this card\r\nsince from young Mr. Bowater:--\r\n\r\n"T. F. in severe form.  J. C. well, but both his brothers are\r\ndown in it, and Lady K.\'s brother, also Lady T. and the Vicar.\r\nNo one to do anything; we have taken charge of Wil\'sbro\'.  I have\r\nno time to do more than thank you for unspeakable kindness.  H.\r\nB."\r\n\r\n"You knew?" exclaimed Lenore, as she saw her sister\'s initial.\r\n\r\n"I knew Lady Tyrrell was ill, but I do not know who the ladies are\r\nwhom I address.  I did not guess that you were here," said Dr.\r\nEasterby, gently.\r\n\r\nNo one living near Backsworth could fail to know Sir Harry Vivian\'s\r\nreputation, so that the master of Rood House knew far better than\r\nthe Superior of St. Faith\'s how much excuse Lenore\'s evasion might\r\nhave; but whatever could seem like tampering with young people was\r\nmost distressing to the Sisters, and the Mother was more grave than\r\npitiful.\r\n\r\nThere was no train till the mail at night, and there would be two\r\nhours to wait in London; but Lenore would listen to no entreaties to\r\nwait till morning, and as they saw that she had plenty of health and\r\nstrength, they did not press her, though the Superior would send a\r\nnurse with her, who, if not needed at Sirenwood, might work in Water\r\nLane.  It was thought best not to distract Lady Susan, and Lenore\r\nwas relieved not to have her vehement regret and fussy cares about\r\nher; but there were still two hours to be spent before starting, and\r\nin these Dr. Easterby was the kindest of comforters.\r\n\r\nHad she erred in her concealment?  He thought she had, though with\r\nmuch excuse.  A Retreat was not like a sacrament, a necessity of a\r\nChristian\'s life; and no merely possible spiritual advantage ought\r\nto be weighed against filial obedience.  It was a moment of\r\ncontrition, and of outpouring for the burthened heart, as Lenore was\r\nable to speak of her long trial, and all the evil it had caused in\r\nhardening and sealing up her better nature.  She even told of her\r\nunsanctioned but unforbidden engagement, and of its termination;\r\nyearning to be told that she had been hasty and hard, and to be\r\nbidden to revoke her rejection.\r\n\r\nShe found that Dr. Easterby would not judge for her, or give her\r\ndecided direction.  He showed her, indeed, that she had given way to\r\npride and temper, and had been unjust in allowing no explanation;\r\nbut he would not tell her to unsay her decision, nor say that it\r\nmight not be right, even though the manner had been wrong.  While\r\nthe past was repented, and had its pardon, for the future he would\r\nonly bid her wait, and pray for guidance and aid through her trial.\r\n\r\n"My child," he said, "chastening is the very token of pardon, and\r\ntherein may you find peace, and see the right course."\r\n\r\n"And you will pray for me--that however it may be, He may forgive\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I will.  We all will pray for you as one in sorrow and\r\nanxiety.  And remember this:  There is a promise that a great\r\nmountain shall become a plain; and so it does, but to those who\r\nbravely try to climb it in strength not their own, not to those who\r\ntry to go round or burrow through."\r\n\r\n"I see," was all she answered, in the meek submissive tone of a\r\nstrong nature, bent but not daring to break down.  She could not\r\nshed tears, deeply as she felt; she must save all her strength and\r\nbear that gnawing misery which Herbert Bowater\'s mention of J. C.\'s\r\nbrothers had inflicted upon her--bear it in utter uncertainty\r\nthrough the night\'s journey, until the train stopped at Wil\'sbro\' at\r\neleven o\'clock, and her father, to whom she had telegraphed, met\r\nher, holding out his arms, and absolutely crying over her for joy.\r\n\r\n"My dear, my dear, I knew you would come; I could trust to my little\r\nLena.  It was all some confounded mistake."\r\n\r\n"It was my fault.  How is she?"\r\n\r\n"Does nothing but ask for you.  Very low--nasty fever at night.\r\nWhat\'s that woman?  M\'Vie sent a nurse, who is awfully jealous;\r\ncan\'t have her in to Camilla:  but there\'s plenty to do; Anais is\r\nlaid up--coachman too, and Joe--half the other servants gone off.  I\r\ntold Victor I would pay anything to him if he would stay."\r\n\r\n"And--at Compton?" faintly asked Lenore.\r\n\r\n"Bad enough, they say.  Serves \'em right; Mrs. Raymond was as\r\nmischievous as Duncombe\'s wife, but I\'ve not heard for the last two\r\ndays; there\'s been no one to send over, and I\'ve had enough to think\r\nabout of my own."\r\n\r\n"Who have it there?" she managed to say.\r\n\r\n"Raymond and his wife, both; and Frank and the young De Lancey, I\r\nheard.  I met Julius Charnock the other day very anxious about them.\r\nHe\'s got his tithe barn stuffed with children from Water Lane, as if\r\nhe wanted to spread it.  All their meddling!  But what kept you so\r\nlong, little one?  Where were you hiding?--or did Lady Susan keep it\r\nfrom you?  I began to think you had eloped with her son.  You are\r\nsure you have not?"\r\n\r\n"I was wrong, father; I went to a Retreat with Lady Susan."\r\n\r\n"A what?  Some of Lady Susan\'s little poperies, eh?  I can\'t scold\r\nyou, child, now I\'ve got you; only have your letters forwarded\r\nanother time," said Sir Harry, placable as usual when alone with\r\nLenore.\r\n\r\nFears of infection for her did not occur to him.  Mr. M\'Vie held the\r\nnon-contagion theory, and helpless selfishness excluded all thoughts\r\nof keeping his daughter at a distance.  He clung to her as he used\r\nto do in former days, before Camilla had taken possession of him,\r\nand could not bear to have her out of reach.  In the sick-room she\r\nwas of disappointingly little use.  The nurse was a regular\r\nprofessional, used to despotism, and resenting her having brought\r\nhome any one with her, and she never permitted Miss Vivian\'s\r\npresence, except when the patient\'s anxiety made it necessary to\r\nbring her in; and when admitted, there was nothing to be done but to\r\nsit by Camilla, and now and then answer the weary disjointed talk,\r\nand, if it grew a little livelier, the warning that Lady Tyrrell was\r\ngetting excited was sure to follow.\r\n\r\nOutside there was enough to do, in the disorganized state of the\r\nsick and panic-stricken household, where nobody was effective but\r\nthe French valet and one very stupid kitchen-maid.  Lena helped the\r\nSt. Faith\'s nurse in her charge of the French maid, but almost all\r\nher time in the morning was spent in domestic cares for the sick and\r\nfor her father; and when he was once up, he was half plaintive, half\r\npassionate, if she did not at once respond to his calls.  She read\r\nthe papers to him, walked up and down the terrace with him while he\r\nsmoked, and played bezique with him late into the night, to distract\r\nhis thoughts.  And where were hers, while each day\'s bulletin from\r\nCompton Hall was worse than the last?  Little Joe Reynolds had been\r\nsent home on being taken ill, and she would fain have gone to see\r\nhim, but detentions sprang up around her, and sometimes it would\r\nhave been impossible to go so far from the house, so that days had\r\nbecome weeks, and the month of October was old before she was\r\nwalking down the little garden of old Betty\'s house.  The door\r\nopened, and Julius Charnock came out, startling her by the sight of\r\nhis worn and haggard looks, as he made a deprecating movement, and\r\nshut the door behind him.  Then she saw that the blinds were in the\r\nact of being drawn down.\r\n\r\n"Is it so?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Julius, in a quiet tone, as sad and subdued as his\r\nlooks.  "He slept himself away peacefully a quarter of an hour ago."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I must not go in now.  I longed to come before.  Poor\r\nboy, he was like a toy flung away."\r\n\r\n"You need not grieve over him," said Julius.  "Far from it.  You\r\nhave done a great deal for him."\r\n\r\n"I--I only caused him to be put into temptation."\r\n\r\n"Nay.  Your care woke his spirit up and guarded him.  No one could\r\nhear his wanderings without feeling that he owed much to you.  There\r\nis a drawing to be given to you that will speak much to you.  It is\r\nat the Rectory; it was not safe here.  And his mother is here.  I\r\ncan\'t but hope her soul has been reached through him.  Yes," as\r\nLenore leant against the gate, her warm tears dropping, "there is no\r\ngrief in thinking of him.  He had yearnings and conceptions that\r\ncould not have been gratified in his former station; and for him an\r\nartist\'s life would have been more than commonly uphill work--full\r\nof trial.  I wish you could have heard the murmured words that\r\nshowed what glorious images floated before him--no doubt now\r\nrealized."\r\n\r\n"I am glad he was really good," were the only words that would come.\r\n\r\nThe hearts of both were so full, that these words on what was a\r\nlittle further off were almost necessary to them.\r\n\r\n"Take my arm," said Julius, kindly.  "Our roads lie together down\r\nthe lane.  How is your sister?  Better, I hope, as I see you here."\r\n\r\n"She has slept more quietly.  Mr. M\'Vie thinks her a little better."\r\n\r\n"So it is with Terry de Lancey," said Julius; "he is certainly less\r\nfeverish to-day;" but there was no corresponding tone of gladness in\r\nthe voice, though he added, "Cecil is going on well too."\r\n\r\n"And--"  Poor Lenore\'s heart died within her; she could only press\r\nhis arm convulsively, and he had mercy on her.\r\n\r\n"Frank\'s illness has been different in character from the others,"\r\nhe said; "the fever has run much higher, and has affected the brain\r\nmore, and the throat is in a very distressing state; but Dr. Worth\r\nstill does not think there are specially dangerous symptoms, and is\r\nless anxious about him than Raymond."\r\n\r\n"Ah! is it true?"\r\n\r\n"He does not seem as ill as Frank; but there have been bleedings at\r\nthe nose, which have brought him very low, and which have hitherto\r\nbeen the worst symptoms," and here the steady sadness of his voice\r\nquivered a little.\r\n\r\nLenore uttered a cry of dismay, and murmured, "Your mother?"\r\n\r\n"She is absorbed in him.  Happily, she can be with him constantly.\r\nThey seem to rest in each other\'s presence, and not to look\r\nforward."\r\n\r\n"And Cecil?"\r\n\r\n"It has taken the lethargic turn with Cecil.  She is almost always\r\nasleep, and is now, I believe, much better; but in truth we have\r\nnone of us been allowed to come near her.  Her maid, Grindstone, has\r\ntaken the sole charge, and shuts us all out, for fear, I believe, of\r\nour telling her how ill Raymond is."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know Grindstone."\r\n\r\n"Who looks on us all as enemies.  However, Raymond has desired us to\r\nwrite to her father, and he will judge when he comes."\r\n\r\nThey were almost at the place of parting.  Eleonora kept her hand on\r\nhis arm, longing for another word, nay, feeling that without it her\r\nheart would burst.  "Who is with Frank?"\r\n\r\n"Anne.  She hardly ever leaves him.  She is our main-stay at the\r\nHall."\r\n\r\n"Is he ever sensible?" she faintly asked.\r\n\r\n"He has not been really rational for nearly ten days now."\r\n\r\n"If--if--oh! you know what I mean.  Oh! gain his pardon for me!" and\r\nshe covered her face with her hand.\r\n\r\n"Poor Frank!--it is of your pardon that he talks.  Tell me,\r\nEleonora, did you ever receive a letter from my mother?"\r\n\r\n"Never.  Where was it sent?" she said, starting.\r\n\r\n"To Revelrig.  It was written the day after the ball."\r\n\r\n"I never went to Revelrig.  Oh! if I could have spoken to you first\r\nI should have been saved from so much that was wrong.  No one knew\r\nwhere I was."\r\n\r\n"No, not till Sister Margaret told Herbert Bowater that her sisters\r\nhad been at a ball at the town-hall the week before.  Then he saw\r\nshe was Miss Strangeways, and asked if she knew where you were."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! disobedience--tacit deception--temper.  Oh! they have\r\nbrought their just punishment.  But that letter!"\r\n\r\n"I think it was to explain poor Frank\'s conduct at the races.\r\nPerhaps, as the servants at Revelrig had no knowledge of you, it may\r\nhave been returned, and my mother\'s letter have been left untouched.\r\nI will see."\r\n\r\nThey knew they must not delay one another, and parted; Julius\r\nwalking homewards by the Hall, where, alas! there was only one of\r\nthe family able to move about the house, and she seldom left her\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nJulius did, however, find her coming down-stairs with Dr. Worth, and\r\nlittle as he gathered that was reassuring in the physician\'s words,\r\nthere was a wistful moisture about her eyes, a look altogether of\r\nhaving a bird in her bosom, which made him say, as the doctor\r\nhurried off, "Anne, some one must be better."\r\n\r\n"Cecil is," she said; and he had nearly answered, "_only_ Cecil,"\r\nbut her eyes brimmed over suddenly, and she said, "I am so\r\nthankful!"\r\n\r\n"Miles!" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe handed him a telegram.  The Salamanca was at Spithead; Miles\r\ntelegraphed to her to join him.\r\n\r\n"Miles come!  Thank God!  Does mother know?"\r\n\r\n"Hush! no one does," and with a heaving breast she added, "I\r\nanswered that I could not, and why, and that he must not come."\r\n\r\n"No, I suppose he must not till he is free of his ship.  My poor\r\nAnne!"\r\n\r\n"Oh no!  I know he is safe.  I am glad!  But the knowledge would\r\ntear your mother to pieces."\r\n\r\n"Her soul is in Raymond now, and to be certain of Miles being at\r\nhand would be an unspeakable relief to him.  Come and tell them."\r\n\r\n"No, no, I can\'t!" she cried, with a sudden gush of emotion sweeping\r\nover her features, subdued instantly, but showing what it was to\r\nher.  "You do it.  Only don\'t let them bring him here."\r\n\r\nAnd Anne flew to her fastness in Frank\'s attic, while Julius\r\nrepaired to Raymond\'s room, and found him as usual lying tranquil,\r\nwith his mother\'s chair so near that she could hand him the cool\r\nfruit or drink, or ring to summon other help.  Their time together\r\nseemed to both a rest, and Julius always liked to look at their\r\npeaceful faces, after the numerous painful scenes he had to\r\nencounter.  Raymond, too, was clinging to him, to his ministrations\r\nand his talk, as to nothing else save his mother.  Raymond had\r\nalways been upright and conscientious, but his religion had been\r\nchiefly duty and obligation, and it was only now that comfort or\r\npeace seemed to be growing out of it for him.  As he looked up at\r\nhis brother, he too saw the involuntary brightness that the tidings\r\nhad produced, and said, "Is any one else better, Julius?  I know\r\nTerry is; I am so glad for Rose."\r\n\r\n"I asked Anne the same question," said Julius.  "Mother, you will be\r\nmore glad than tantalized.  The Salamanca is come in."\r\n\r\nRaymond made an inarticulate sound of infinite relief.  His mother\r\nexclaimed, "He must not come here!  But Frankie could not spare Anne\r\nto him.  What will she do?"\r\n\r\n"She will stay bravely by Frank," said Julius.  "We must all wait\r\ntill the ship is paid off."\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Raymond.  "If she can rejoice that he is out of\r\ndanger, we will; I am content to know him near.  It makes all much\r\neasier.  And, mother, he will find all ready to own what a priceless\r\ntreasure he sent before him in his wife."\r\n\r\nThere was the old note of pain in the comparison.  Julius\'s heart\r\nwas wrung as he thought of Sirenwood, with the sense that the victim\r\nwas dying, the author of the evil recovering.  He could only stifle\r\nthe thought by turning away, and going to the table in his mother\'s\r\nadjacent room, where letters had accumulated unopened.  \'On Her\r\nMajesty\'s Service\' bore the post-mark which justified him in opening\r\nit, and enclosing the letter it contained to Miss Vivian.\r\n\r\nHe did so almost mechanically.  He had gone through these weeks only\r\nby never daring to have a self.  The only man of his family who\r\ncould be effective; the only priest in the two infected parishes; he\r\nhad steadfastly braced himself for the work.  He ventured only to\r\nact and pray, never to talk, save for the consolation of others.  To\r\nWil\'sbro\' he daily gave two morning hours, for he never failed to be\r\nwanted either for the last rites, or for some case beyond Herbert\'s\r\nexperience, as well as to see the Vicar, who was sinking fast, in a\r\ndevout and resigned frame, which impressed while it perplexed his\r\nbrother clergyman, in view of the glaring deficiencies so plain to\r\nothers, but which never seemed to trouble his conscience.\r\n\r\nThe nursing-staff still consisted of the Sisters, Herbert Bowater,\r\nMrs. Duncombe and her man-servant.  Under their care, the virulence\r\nof the disease was somewhat abating, and the doctors ventured to say\r\nthat after the next few days there would be much fewer fatal cases;\r\nbut Water Lane was now a strangely silent place,--windows open,\r\nblinds flapping in the wind, no children playing about, and the\r\n\'Three Pigeons\' remained the only public-house not shut up.  It was\r\nlike having the red cross on the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\nA Strange Night\r\n\r\n\r\nCold, cold with death, came up the tide\r\n   In no manner of haste,\r\nUp to her knees, and up to her side,\r\n   And up to her wicked waist;\r\nFor the hand of the dead, and the heart of the dead,\r\n   Are strong hasps they to hold.--G. MACDONALD\r\n\r\n"Rector," said Herbert Bowater, "are you specially at home?"\r\n\r\n"Why?" asked Julius, pausing.\r\n\r\n"There\'s that man Gadley."\r\n\r\n"Gadley!  Is he down?"\r\n\r\n"It seems that he has been ill this fortnight, but in the low,\r\nsmouldering form; and he and that hostler of his kept it a secret,\r\nfor fear of loss of gain, and hatred of doctors, parsons, Sisters,\r\nand authorities generally, until yesterday, when the hostler made\r\noff with all the money and the silver spoons.  This morning early, a\r\npoliceman, seeing the door open, went in, and found the poor wretch\r\nin a most frightful state, but quite sensible.  I was passing as he\r\ncame out to look for help, and I have been there mostly ever since.\r\nHe is dying--M\'Vie says there\'s not a doubt of that, and he has got\r\nsomething on his mind.  He says he has been living on Moy\'s hush-\r\nmoney all this time, for not bringing to light some embezzlement of\r\nyour mother\'s money, and letting the blame light on that poor cousin\r\nof yours, Douglas."\r\n\r\nHerbert was amazed at the lighting up of his Rector\'s worn, anxious\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Douglas!  Thank Heaven!  Herbert, we must get a magistrate at once\r\nto take the deposition!"\r\n\r\n"What!  Do you want to prosecute Moy?"\r\n\r\n"No, but to clear Archie."\r\n\r\n"I thought he was drowned?"\r\n\r\n"No; that was all a mistake.  Miles saw him at Natal.  Herbert, this\r\nwill be life and joy to your sister.  What!--you did not know about\r\nJenny and Archie?"\r\n\r\n"Not I--Jenny!--poor old Joan!  So that\'s what has stood in her way,\r\nand made her the jolliest of old sisters, is it?  Poor old Joanie!\r\nWhat! was she engaged to him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, much against your father\'s liking, though he had consented.  I\r\nremember he forbade it to be spoken of,--and you were at school."\r\n\r\n"And Joan was away nursing old Aunt Joan for two years.  So Archie\r\nwent off with this charge on him, and was thought to be lost!  Whew!\r\nHow did she stand it?  I say, does she know he is alive?"\r\n\r\n"No, he forbade Miles to speak.  No one knows but Miles and I, and\r\nour wives.  Anne put us on the scent.  Now, Herbert, I\'ll go to the\r\npoor man at once, and you had better find a magistrate."\r\n\r\n"Whom can I find?" said Herbert.  "There\'s my father away, and\r\nRaymond ill, and Lipscombe waved me off--wouldn\'t so much as speak\r\nto me for fear I should be infectious."\r\n\r\n"You must get a town magistrate."\r\n\r\n"Briggs is frantic since he lost his son, and Truelove thinks he has\r\nthe fever, though Worth says it is all nonsense.  There\'s nobody but\r\nWhitlock.  Dear old Jenny!  Well, there always was something\r\ndifferent from other people in her, and I never guessed what it was.\r\nI\'d go to the end of the world to make her happy and get that\r\npatient look out of her eyes."\r\n\r\nHerbert had nearly to fulfil this offer, for Mr. Whitlock was gone\r\nto London for the day, and magistrates were indeed scarce; but at\r\nlast, after walking two miles out of the town, his vehemence and\r\ndetermination actually dragged in the unfortunate, timid justice of\r\nthe peace who had avoided him in the road, but who could not refuse\r\nwhen told in strong earnest that the justification of an innocent\r\nman depended on his doing his duty.\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Lipscombe!  The neglected \'Three Pigeons\' was just now the\r\nworst place in all Water Lane.  The little that had hastily been\r\ndone since the morning seemed to have had no effect on the foetid\r\natmosphere, even to Herbert\'s well accustomed nostrils; and what\r\nmust it have been to a stranger, in spite of the open window and all\r\nthe disinfectants?  And, alas! the man had sunk into a sleep.\r\nJulius, who still stood by him, had heard all he had to say to\r\nrelieve his mind, all quite rationally, and had been trying to show\r\nhim the need of making reparation by repeating all to a magistrate,\r\nwhen the drowsiness had fallen on him; and though the sound of feet\r\nroused him, it was to wander into the habitual defiance of\r\nauthority, merging into terror.\r\n\r\nHerbert soothed him better than any one else could do, and he fell\r\nasleep again; but Mr. Lipscombe declared it was of no use to remain--\r\nnothing but madness; and they could not gainsay him.  He left the\r\ntwo clergymen together, feeling himself to have done a very valiant\r\nand useless thing in the interests of justice, or at the importunity\r\nof a foolishly zealous young curate.\r\n\r\n"Look here," said Herbert, "Whitlock may be trusted.  Leave a note\r\nfor him explaining.  I\'ll stay here; I\'m the best to do so, any way.\r\nIf he revives and is sensible, I\'ll send off at once for Whitlock,\r\nor if there is no time, I\'ll write it down and let him see me sign\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"And some one else, if possible," said Julius.  "The difficulty is\r\nthat I never had authority given me to use what he said to me in\r\nprivate.  Rather the contrary, for old instinctive habits of caution\r\nawoke the instant I told him it was his duty to make it known, and\r\nthat Archie was alive.  I don\'t like leaving you here, Herbert, but\r\nRaymond was very weak this morning; besides, there\'s poor Joe\'s\r\nfuneral."\r\n\r\n"Oh, never mind.  He\'ll have his sleep out, and be all right when he\r\nawakes.  Think of righting Jenny\'s young man!  How jolly!"\r\n\r\nJulius went across to the town-hall hospital, and told the Sisters,\r\nwhose darling his curate was, of the charge he had undertaken, and\r\nthey promised to look after him.  After which Julius made the best\r\nof his way home, where Rosamond had, as usual, a bright face for\r\nhim.  Her warm heart and tender tact had shown her that obtrusive\r\nattempts to take care of him would only be harassing, so she only\r\ntook care to secure him food and rest in his own house whenever it\r\nwas possible, and that however low her own hopes might be, she would\r\nnot add to his burden; and now Terry was so much better that she\r\ncould well receive him cheerily, and talk of what Terry had that day\r\neaten, so joyously, as almost to conceal that no one was better at\r\nthe Hall.\r\n\r\n"I will come with you," she said; "I might do something for poor\r\nFanny," as the bell began to toll for little Joshua\'s funeral.\r\nFanny Reynolds, hearing some rumour of her boy\'s illness, had\r\nbrought Drake to her home three days before his death.  The poor\r\nlittle fellow\'s utterances, both conscious and unconscious, had\r\nstrangely impressed the man, and what had they not awakened in the\r\nmother?  And when the words, so solemn and mysterious, fell on those\r\nunaccustomed ears in the churchyard, and Fanny, in her wild\r\noverpowering grief, threw herself about in an agony of sorrow and\r\nremorse, and sobbed with low screams, it was \'the lady\' whom she\r\nviewed as an angel of mercy, who held her and hushed her; and when\r\nall was over, and she was sinking down, faint and hysterical, it was\r\n\'the lady\' who--a little to the scandal of the more respectable--\r\nhelped Drake to carry her to the Rectory, the man obeying like one\r\ndazed.\r\n\r\n"I must leave the sheep that was lost to you, Rose," said Julius.\r\n"You can do more for them than I as yet, and they have sent for me\r\nto the Hall."\r\n\r\n"You will stay there to-night if they want you; I don\'t want any\r\none," said Rosamond at the door.\r\n\r\nHe was wanted indeed at his home.  Frank was in a wilder and more\r\nraving state than ever, and Raymond so faint and sinking, and with\r\nsuch a look about him, that Julius felt, more than he had ever done\r\nbefore, that though the fever had almost passed away, there was no\r\nspirit or strength to rally.  He was very passive, and seemed to\r\nhave no power to wonder, though he was evidently pleased when Julius\r\ntold him both of Archie Douglas\'s life and the hopes of clearing his\r\nname.  "Tell Jenny she was right," he said, and did not seem\r\ninclined to pursue the subject.\r\n\r\nThey wheeled Mrs. Poynsett away at her usual hour, when he was\r\ndozing; and as Frank was still tossing and moaning incoherently, and\r\noften required to be held, Julius persuaded Anne to let him take her\r\nplace with him, while she became Raymond\'s watcher.  He dozed about\r\nhalf an hour, and when she next gave him some food, he said, in a\r\nvery low feeble tone:\r\n\r\n"You have heard from Miles?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he says nothing shall stop him the moment they are paid off."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right.  No fear of infection--that\'s clear," said Raymond.\r\n\r\n"I think not--under God!" and Anne\'s two hands unseen clasped over\r\nher throbbing, yearning heart.\r\n\r\n"Dear old fellow!" said Raymond.  "It is such pleasure to leave\r\nmother to him.  If I don\'t see him, Anne, tell him how glad I am.\r\nI\'ve no charge.  I know he will do it all right.  And mother will\r\nhave you," and he held out his hand to her.  Presently he said:\r\n"Anne.  One thing--"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said anxiously.\r\n\r\n"You always act on principle, I know; but don\'t hang back from\r\nMiles\'s friends and pleasures.  I know the old fellow, Anne.  His\r\nnature is sociable, and he wants sympathy in it."\r\n\r\n"I know what you mean, Raymond," said Anne; "I do mean to try to do\r\nright--"\r\n\r\n"I know, I know," said he, getting a little excited, and speaking\r\neagerly; "but don\'t let right blind you, Anne, if you censure and\r\nkeep from all he likes--if you will be a recluse and not a woman--\r\nhe--don\'t be offended, Anne; but if you leave him to himself, then\r\nwill every effort be made to turn him from you.  You don\'t believe\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"My dear Raymond, don\'t speak so eagerly," as his cheeks flushed.\r\n\r\n"I must!  I can\'t see his happiness and yours wrecked like mine.  Go\r\nwith him, Anne.  Don\'t leave him to be poisoned.  Mesmerism has its\r\npower over whoever has been under the spell.  And he has--he has!\r\nShe will try to turn him against you and mother."\r\n\r\n"Hush, Raymond!  Indeed I will be on my guard.  There\'s no one\r\nthere.  What are you looking at?"\r\n\r\n"Camilla!" he said, with eyes evidently seeing something.  "Camilla!\r\nIs it not enough to have destroyed _one_ peace?"\r\n\r\n"Raymond, indeed there is no one here."\r\n\r\nBut he had half raised himself.  "Yes, Camilla, you have had your\r\nrevenge.  Let it be enough.  No--no; I forgive you; but I forbid you\r\nto touch her."\r\n\r\nHe grasped Anne\'s arm with one hand, and stretched the other out as\r\nthough to warn some one away.  The same moment there was another\r\noutburst of the bleeding.  Anne rang for help with one hand, and\r\nheld him as best she could.  It lasted long; and when it was over he\r\nwas manifestly dying.  "It is coming," he said; looking up to\r\nJulius.  "Pray!  Only first--my love to Cecil.  I hope she is still\r\nyoung enough not to have had all her life spoilt.  Is her father\r\ncoming?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow," said Anne.\r\n\r\n"That\'s well.  Poor child! she is better free."\r\n\r\nHow piteously sad those words of one wedded but a year!  How unlike\r\nthe look that met his mother\'s woeful yet tender eyes, as she held\r\nhis hand.  She would aid him through that last passage as through\r\nall before, only a word of strong and tender love, as he again\r\nlooked up to Julius and Anne, as if to put her in their keeping, and\r\nonce more murmured something of "Love to sweet Rose!  Now, Julius,\r\npray!"\r\n\r\nAn ever dutiful man, there was no wandering in look or tone.  He\r\nbreathed \'Amen\' once or twice, but never moved again, only his eyes\r\nstill turned on his mother, and so in its time came the end.\r\n\r\nOld Susan saw at first that the long fluttering gasp had no\r\nsuccessor, and her touch certified Julius.  He rose and went towards\r\nhis mother.  She held out her hands and said.  "Take me to my\r\nFrank."\r\n\r\n"We had better," whispered Anne.\r\n\r\nThey wheeled her to the foot of the stairs.  Julius took her in his\r\narms, Anne held her feet, and thus they carried her up the stairs,\r\nand along the passage, hearing Frank\'s husky rapid babble all the\r\nway, and finding him struggling with the fierce strength of delirium\r\nagainst Jenkins, who looked as if he thought them equally senseless,\r\nwhen he saw his helpless mistress carried in.\r\n\r\n"Frank, my boy, do lie still," she said, and he took no notice; but\r\nwhen she laid her hand on his, he turned, looked at her with his\r\ndull eyes, and muttered, "Mother!"\r\n\r\nIt was the first recognition for many a day! and, at the smoothing\r\nmotion of her hand over him, while she still entreated, "Lie still,\r\nmy dear," the mutterings died away; the childish instinct of\r\nobedience stilled the struggles; and there was something more like\r\nrepose than had been seen all these weary months.\r\n\r\n"Mother," said Julius, "you can do for us what no one else can.  You\r\nwill save him."\r\n\r\nShe looked up to him, and hope took away the blank misery he had\r\ndreaded to see.  "My poor Frankie," she said dreamily, "he has\r\nwanted me, I will not leave him now."\r\n\r\nAll was soon still; Frank\'s face had something like rest on it, as\r\nhe lay with his mother\'s hand on his brow, and she intent only on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"You can leave them to me, I think," said Anne.  "I will send if\r\nthere be need; but if not, you had better not come up till you have\r\nbeen to Wil\'sbro\'--if you must go."\r\n\r\n"I must, I fear; I promised to come to Fuller if he be still here.\r\nI will speak to Jenkins first."\r\n\r\nJulius was living like a soldier in a campaign, with numbers\r\ndropping beside him, and no time to mourn, scarcely to realize the\r\nloss, and he went on, almost as if he had been a stranger; while the\r\ngrief of poor old Jenkins was uncontrollable, both for his lady\'s\r\nsake and for the young master, who had been his pride and glory.\r\nHis sobs brought out Mrs. Grindstone into the gallery, to insist,\r\nwith some asperity, that there should be no noise to awaken her\r\nmistress, who was in a sweet sleep.\r\n\r\n"We will take care," said Julius, sadly.  "I suppose she had better\r\nhear nothing till Mr. Charnock comes."\r\n\r\n"She must be left to me, sir, or I cannot be answerable for the\r\nconsequences," was the stiff reply, wherewith Mrs. Grindstone\r\nretreated into her castle.\r\n\r\nJulius left the hushed and veiled house, in the frosty chill of the\r\nlate autumn just before dawn, shivering between grief and cold, and\r\nhe walked quickly down the avenue, feeling it strange that the\r\nwindows in the face of his own house were glittering back the\r\nreflection of the setting moon.\r\n\r\nSomething long and black came from the opposite direction.\r\n"Rector," it said, in a low hoarse voice, "I\'ve got leave from him\r\nto use what he said to you.  Sister Margaret and I signed it.  Will\r\nthat do?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell now, Herbert, I can\'t think.  My brother is just\r\ngone," said Julius in his inward voice.\r\n\r\n"Raymond!  No!  Oh, I beg your pardon; I never thought of that;\r\nRaymond--"\r\n\r\n"Go home and go to bed," said Julius, as the young man wrung his\r\nhand.  "Rest now--we must think another time."\r\n\r\nDid Rosamond know? was perhaps the foremost of his weary thoughts.\r\nAh! did she not!  Was she not standing with her crimson shawl round\r\nher, and the long black plaits falling on it, to beckon him to the\r\nfirelit comfort of his own room?  Did she not fall on his neck as he\r\ncame heavily up, and cling around him with her warm arms?  "Oh,\r\nJulius, what a dear brother he was!  What can we do for your\r\nmother?"\r\n\r\nAs he told her how Frank\'s need did more than any support could do\r\nfor her, her tears came thicker; but in spite of them, her fond\r\nhands put him into the easy-chair by the fire, and drew off his damp\r\nboots; and while listening to the low sunken voice that told her of\r\nthe end, she made ready the cup of cocoa that was waiting, and put\r\nthe spoon in his hand in a caressing manner, that made her care,\r\ncomfort, not oppression.  Fatigue seconded her, for he took the warm\r\nfood, faltered and leant back, dozing till the baby\'s voice awoke\r\nhim, and as he saw Rosamond hushing her, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"O, Rose! if poor Raymond had ever known one hour like this!" and he\r\nheld out his arms for his child.\r\n\r\n"You know I don\'t let you hold her in that coat.  Go into your\r\ndressing-room, have your bath, and put on your dressing-gown, and if\r\nyou will lie on the bed, you shall take care of her while I go and\r\nfeed Terry.  You can\'t do anything for anybody yet, it is only six\r\no\'clock."\r\n\r\nThese precautions, hindering his going jaded and exhausted into\r\ninfection, were what Rosamond seemed to live for, though she never\r\nforced them on him, and he was far too physically tired out not to\r\nyield to the soothing effect; so that even two hours on the bed sent\r\nhim forth renovated to that brief service in the church, where\r\nHerbert and he daily met and found their strength for the day.  They\r\nhad not had time to exchange a word after it before there was a\r\nknock at the vestry door, and a servant gave the message to Herbert,\r\nwho had opened it:  "Lady Tyrrell is taken worse, sir, and Sir Harry\r\nVivian begged that Mr. Charnock would come immediately."\r\n\r\nA carriage had been sent for him, and he could only hurry home to\r\ntell Rosamond to send on the pony to Sirenwood, to take him to\r\nWil\'sbro\', unless he were first wanted at home.  She undertook to go\r\nup to the Hall and give Anne a little rest, and he threw himself\r\ninto the carriage, not daring to dwell on the pain it gave him to go\r\nfrom his brother\'s death bed to confront Camilla.\r\n\r\nAt the door Eleonora came to meet him.  "Thank you," she said.  "We\r\nknew it was no time to disturb you."\r\n\r\n"I can be better spared _now_," answered Julius.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean," she said, with a strange look, which was not quite\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear brother left us at about three o\'clock last night.  A\r\nchange came on at twelve."\r\n\r\n"Twelve!"  Eleonora laid her hand on his arm, and spoke in a quick\r\nagitated manner.  "Camilla was much better till last night, when at\r\ntwelve I heard such a scream that I ran into her room.  She was\r\nsitting up with her eyes fixed open, like a clairvoyante, and her\r\nvoice seemed pleading--pleading with _him_, as if for pardon, and\r\nshe held out her hands and called him.  Then, suddenly, she gave a\r\nterrible shriek, and fell back in a kind of fit.  Mr. M\'Vie can do\r\nnothing, and though she is conscious now, she does nothing but ask\r\nfor you and say that he does not want you now."\r\n\r\nJulius grew paler, as he said very low, "Anne said he seemed to be\r\nseeing and answering _her_.  Not like delirium, but as if she were\r\nreally there."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell any one," entreated Eleonora, in a breathless whisper,\r\nand he signed consent, as both felt how those two spirits must have\r\nbeen entwined, since these long years had never broken that subtle\r\nlink of sympathy which had once bound them.\r\n\r\nSir Harry\'s face, dreary, sunken, and terrified, was thrust over the\r\nbalusters, as he called, "Don\'t hinder him, Lena, she asks for him\r\nevery moment;" and as they came on, he caught Julius\'s hand, saying,\r\n"Soothe her, soothe her--\'tis the only chance.  If she could but\r\nsleep!"\r\n\r\nThere lay Camilla Tyrrell, beautiful still, but more than ever like\r\nthe weird tragic head with snake-wreathed brows, in the wasted\r\ncontour of her regular features and the flush on her hollow cheeks,\r\nwhile her eyes burned with a strange fire that almost choked back\r\nJulius\'s salutation of peace, even while he breathed it, for might\r\nnot the Son of Peace be with some there?\r\n\r\nThe eager glance seemed to dart at him.  "Julius Charnock!" she\r\ncried, "come!" and as he would have said some word about her health,\r\nshe cut him short:  "Never mind that; I must speak while my brain\r\nserves.  After that be the priest.  He is dead!"\r\n\r\n"My brother?  Yes."\r\n\r\n"The only one I ever loved!  There\'s no sin nor scandal in saying so\r\nnow.  His wife is better?  It will never kill her."\r\n\r\n"She does not know."\r\n\r\n"No?  There was nothing to make her.  He could not give her his\r\nheart, try as he would.  Why did he turn the unchangeable to hate!\r\nhate! hate!"\r\n\r\n"Lady Tyrrell, you did not send for me to hear what ought not to be\r\nsaid at all?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t fly off," she said.  "I had really something to say.  It was\r\nnot wholly hate, Julius; I really tried to teach his little idiot of\r\na wife to win him at last.  I meant it to turn out well, and nothing\r\ncould, with that mother there."\r\n\r\n"I must leave you, Lady Tyrrell, if you will not control yourself."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be hard on me, Julius," and she looked up with a glance of\r\nbetter days.  "You idolize her, like all the rest of you; but she\r\nchilled me and repelled me, and turned me to bitterness, when I was\r\nyoung and he might have led me.  Her power and his idolatry made me\r\njealous, and what I did in a fit of petulance was so fastened on\r\nthat I could not draw back.  Why did not he wait a little longer to\r\nencumber himself with that girl!  No--that wasn\'t what I had to say--\r\nit\'s all over now.  It is the other thing.  How is Frank?"\r\n\r\n"Very ill indeed; but quieter just now."\r\n\r\n"Then there shall not be another wreck like ours.  Lena, are you\r\nhere?  You saw that Frank had let Constance Strangeways win your\r\npebble.  It was because I showed him the one Beatrice bought, and he\r\nthought it yours.  Yes, I saw nothing else for it.  What was to\r\nbecome of the property if you threw yourself away, and on _her_\r\nson?" she added, with the malignant look.  "Whether he knew of this\r\nlittle vow of yours, I can\'t tell, but he had lost his head and did\r\nfor himself.  It was for your good and papa\'s; but I shall not be\r\nhere to guide the clue, so you must go your own way and be happy in\r\nit, if _she_ will let you.  Father, do you hear?  Don\'t think to\r\nplease me by hindering the course of true love; and you, Julius,\r\ntell Frank he was \'a dull Moor.\'  I liked the boy, I was sorry for\r\nhim; but he ought to have known his token better;--and there was the\r\nestate to be saved."\r\n\r\n"Estates weigh little now!"\r\n\r\n"Clerical!  I suppose now is the time for it?  You were all\r\nprecision at Compton.  It would kill me; I can\'t live with Mrs.\r\nPoynsett.  No, no, Tom, I can\'t have old Raymond quizzed; I\'ll get\r\nhim out of it when the leading-strings are cut.  What right has she--\r\n?"\r\n\r\nThe delirium had returned.  Julius\'s voice kept her still for a few\r\nmoments, but she broke out afresh at his first pause, and murmurs\r\nfell thick and fast from her tongue, mixing the names of her brother\r\nand Raymond with railings at Mrs. Poynsett for slights in the days\r\nwhen the mother was striving to discourage the inclination that\r\nresulted in the engagement.\r\n\r\nEarnestly did Julius beseech for peace, for repentance for the poor\r\nstorm-tossed soul; but when the raving grew past control, and the\r\ntime was coming for his ministrations to the Vicar of Wil\'sbro\', he\r\nwas forced to leave her.  Poor old Sir Harry would have clung to him\r\nas to anything like a support, but Eleonora knew better.  "No, dear\r\npapa," she said, "he has given us too much of his time already.  He\r\nmust go where he can still help.  Poor Camilla cannot attend to\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"If she came to herself--"\r\n\r\n"Then send for me.  I would come instantly.  Send to the town-hall\r\nany time before twelve, after that to Compton.  Send without\r\nscruples, Lenore, you have truly the right."\r\n\r\nThey did not send, except that a note met him as he returned home,\r\ntelling him that suffusion of the brain had set in.  Camilla Tyrrell\r\ndid not survive Raymond Poynsett twelve hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\nCome Back\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd are ye sure the news is true?\r\nAnd are ye sure he\'s weel?--J. THOMPSON\r\n\r\nEleonora Vivian was striving to write her sorrowful announcements in\r\nthe deepening dusk of that autumn evening, while her father had shut\r\nhimself up after his vigil to sleep under Victor\'s care, when a\r\nmessage came that Lady Rosamond Charnock earnestly begged to see\r\nher.  She stood with a face white and set, looking like a galvanized\r\ncorpse, as her lips framed the words, "He is dead!"\r\n\r\n"No!" almost screamed Rosamond, snatching her hand.  "No!  But no\r\none can save him but you.  Come!"\r\n\r\nWithout a word, Eleonora stepped into her own room, and came back in\r\ncloak, hat, and veil.\r\n\r\n"Right," said Rosamond, seizing her arm, and taking her to the pony-\r\ncarriage at the door, then explaining while driving rapidly:  "He\r\nhas left off raving ever since his mother has been with him, but he\r\nlies--not still but weak, not speaking, only moaning now and then.\r\nHis throat is so dreadful that it is hard to give him anything, and\r\nhe takes no notice of what one says, only if his mother takes the\r\nspoon.  He gets weaker, and Dr. Worth says it is only because there\r\nis no impulse to revive him--he is just sinking because he can\'t be\r\nroused.  When I heard that, I thought I knew who could."\r\n\r\nEleonora\'s lips once moved, but no sound came from them, and\r\nRosamond urged her little pony to its best speed through the two\r\nparks from one veiled house to another, fastened it to the garden-\r\ndoor without calling any one, and led her silent companion up the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett felt a hand on her shoulder, and Rosamond said, "I\r\nhave brought our only hope," and Eleonora stood, looking at the\r\nghastly face.  The yellow skin, the inflamed purple lips, the\r\ncavernous look of cheeks and eyes, were a fearful sight, and only\r\nthe feeble incessant groping of the skeleton fingers showed life or\r\naction.\r\n\r\n"Put this into his hand," said Rosamond, and Lenore found the pebble\r\ntoken given to her, and obeyed.  At the touch, a quivering trembled\r\nover face and form, the eyelids lifted, the eyes met hers, there was\r\na catching of the breath, a shudder and convulsive movement.  "He is\r\ngoing," cried his mother, but Anne started forward with drops of\r\nstrong stimulant, Rosamond rubbed spirit into his forehead, the\r\nstruggle lessened, the light flickered back into his brown eyes, his\r\nfingers closed on hers.  "Speak to him," said Mrs. Poynsett.  "Do\r\nyou see her, Frankie dear?"\r\n\r\n"Frank! dear Frank, here I am."\r\n\r\nThe eyes gazed with more meaning, the lips moved, but no sound came\r\ntill Anne had given another drop of the stimulant, and the terrible\r\npain of the swallowing was lessened.  Then he looked up, and the\r\nwords were heard.\r\n\r\n"Is it true?"\r\n\r\n"It is, my dear boy.  It is Lena."\r\n\r\n"Here, Frank," as still the wistful gaze was unsatisfied; she laid\r\nher hands on his, and then he almost smiled and tried to raise it to\r\nhis cheeks, but he was too weak; and she obeyed the feeble gesture,\r\nand stroked the wasted face, while a look of content came over it,\r\nthe eyes closed, and he slept with his face against her hand, his\r\nmother watching beside with ineffable gratitude and dawning hope.\r\n\r\nLenore was forgetting everything in this watching, but in another\r\nquarter of an hour Anne was forced again to torture him with her\r\nspoon; but life was evidently gaining ground, for though he put it\r\nfrom him at first, he submitted at Lena\'s gesture and word.  She\r\nfelt the increased warmth and power in his grasp, as he whispered,\r\n"Lena, you are come back," then felt for the token.\r\n\r\nAlas! that she must leave him.  They knew she must not stay away\r\nfrom her father; indeed, Rosamond had told no one of her attempt,\r\nher forlorn hope.  Lena tried to give assurances that she only went\r\nbecause it could not be helped, and the others told him she would\r\nreturn, but still he held her, and murmured, "Stay."  She could not\r\ntear herself away, she let him keep her hand, and again he dozed and\r\nhis fingers relaxed.  "Go now, my dear," said Mrs. Poynsett, "you\r\nhave saved him.  This stone will show him that you have been here.\r\nYou will come back to-morrow, I may promise him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes.  In the morning, or whenever I can be spared," whispered\r\nLena, who was held for a moment to Mrs. Poynsett\'s breast, ere\r\nRosamond took her away again, and brought her once more down-stairs\r\nand to the pony-carriage.  There she leant back, weeping quietly but\r\nbitterly over the shock of Frank\'s terribly reduced state, which\r\nseemed to take from her all the joy of his revival, weeping too at\r\nthe cruel need that was taking her away.\r\n\r\n"He will do now!  I know he will," said Rosamond, happy in her bold\r\nventure.\r\n\r\n"Oh! if I could stay!"\r\n\r\n"Most likely you would be turned out for fear of excitement.  The\r\nstone will be safer for him."\r\n\r\n"Where did that come from?" asked Lenore, struck suddenly with\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\n"I wrote to Miss Strangeways, when I saw how he was always feeling,\r\nfeeling, feeling for it, like the Bride of Lammermoor.  I told her\r\nthere was more than she knew connected with that bit of stone, and\r\nlife or death might hang on it.  Then when I\'d got it, I hardly knew\r\nwhat to do with it, for if it had soothed the poor boy delirious,\r\nthe coming to his right mind might have been all the worse."\r\n\r\nRosamond kissed her effusively, and she dreamily muttered, "He must\r\nbe saved."  There was a sort of strange mist round her, as though\r\nshe knew not what she was doing, and she longed to be alone.  She\r\nwould not let Rosamond drive her beyond the Sirenwood gate, but\r\ninsisted on walking through the park alone in the darkness, by that\r\nvery path where Frank had ten months ago exchanged vows with her.\r\n\r\nRosamond turned back to the Hall.  It was poor Cecil\'s pony-carriage\r\nthat she was driving, and she took it to the stable-yard, where her\r\nentreaty had obtained it from the coachman, whom she rewarded by\r\nsaying, "I was right, Brown, I fetched his best doctor," and the old\r\nservant understood, and came as near a smile as any one at Compton\r\ncould do on such a day.\r\n\r\n"Is the carriage gone for Mr. Charnock?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my lady, I sent Alfred with it; I did not seem as if I could\r\ngo driving into Wil\'sbro\' on such a day."\r\n\r\nRosamond bade a kind farewell to the poor old coachman, and was\r\nwalking homewards, when she saw a figure advancing towards her,\r\nstrangely familiar, and yet hat and coat forbade her to believe it\r\nher husband, even in the dusk.  She could not help exclaiming,\r\n"Miles!"\r\n\r\n"Yes!" he said, coming to a standstill.  "Are you Rosamond?"\r\n\r\n"I am;--Anne is quite well and Frank better.  Oh! this will do them\r\ngood!  You know--"\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes, I know," he said hastily, as if he could not bear to let\r\nhimself out to one as yet a stranger.  "My mother?"\r\n\r\n"Absorbed in Frank too much to feel it yet fully; Anne watches them\r\nboth.  Oh! Miles, what she has been!" and she clasped his hand\r\nagain.  "Let me call her."\r\n\r\nAnd Rosamond opened the hall door just as some instinct, for it\r\ncould hardly have been sense of hearing, had brought Anne upon the\r\nstairs, where, as Miles would have hurried up to her, she seemed, in\r\nthe light gray dress she still wore, to hover like some spirit\r\neluding his grasp like the fabled shades.\r\n\r\n"Oh no! you ought not.  Infection--I am steeped in it."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," and she was gathered into the strong grasp that was home\r\nand rest to her, while Miles was weeping uncontrollably as he held\r\nher in his arms.  "O, Nannie, Nannie!  I did not think it would be\r\nlike this.  Why did they keep me till he was gone?  No, I did not\r\nget the telegram, I only heard at the station.  They let me go this\r\nmorning, and I did think I should have been in time."  He loosed\r\nhimself from her, and hung over the balustrade, struggling with a\r\nstrong man\'s anguish, then said in a low voice, "Did he want me?"\r\n\r\n"He knew it was your duty," said Anne.  "We all were thankful you\r\nwere kept from infection, and he said many little things, but the\r\nchief was that he trusted you too much to leave any special\r\nmessages.  Hark! that must be Mr. Charnock, Cecil\'s father!  I must\r\ngo and receive him.  Stay back, Miles, you can\'t now--you know my\r\nroom--"\r\n\r\nHe signed acquiescence, but lingered in the dark to look down and\r\nsee how, though Rosamond had waited to spare them this reception,\r\nhis wife\'s tall graceful figure came forward, and her kindly\r\ncomforting gestures, as the two sisters-in-law took the newcomer\r\ninto the drawing-room, and in another minute Anne flitted up to him\r\nagain.  "That good Rosamond is seeing to Mr. Charnock," she said;\r\n"will you come, Miles?  I think it will do your mother good; only\r\nquietly, for Frank knows nothing."\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett still sat by Frank.  To Miles\'s eyes he was a fearful\r\nspectacle, but to Anne there was hourly progress; the sunken\r\ndejected look was gone, and though there was exhaustion, there was\r\nrest; but he was neither sleeping nor waking, and showed no heed\r\nwhen his brother dropped on one knee by his mother\'s side, put an\r\narm round her waist, and after one fervent kiss laid his black head\r\non her lap, hiding his face there while she fondled his hair, and\r\nsaid, "Frank, Frankie dear, here\'s Miles come home."  He did not\r\nseem to hear, only his lips murmured something like \'Anne,\' and the\r\ntender hand and ready touch of his unwearied nurse at once fulfilled\r\nhis need, while his mother whispered, "Miles, she is our blessing!"\r\n\r\nPoor Miles!  Never had sailor a stranger, though some may have had\r\nan even sadder, return.  He had indeed found his wife, but hers was\r\nthe only hand that could make Frank swallow the sustenance that he\r\nneeded every half-hour, or who knew how to relieve him.  Indeed,\r\neven the being together in the sick-room was not long possible, for\r\nAnne was called to the door.  Mr. Charnock was asking to see Mrs.\r\nPoynsett.  Would Mrs. Miles come and speak to him?\r\n\r\nMr. Charnock was a small and restless man with white hair, little\r\nblack eyes, looking keener than they were, and a face which had\r\nevidently been the mould of Cecil\'s.  He was very kind, with a full\r\npersuasion that the consolations of his august self must be\r\ninfallible; but this was coupled with an inclination to reprove\r\neverybody for the fate that had left his cherished darling a\r\nchildless widow at two-and-twenty.  To take him to Frank\'s room was\r\nimpossible, and he had to be roundly told so.  Neither had he seen\r\nhis daughter.  She was very weak, but recovering, and Grindstone,\r\nwhom he had seen and talked with, was as strenuous in deprecating\r\nany excitement as he was nervous about it.  So he could only be\r\ndisposed of in his room till dinner-time, when he came down prepared\r\nto comfort the family, but fulfilled his mission rather by doing\r\nsuch good as a blister, which lessens the force of the malady by\r\ncounter-irritation.\r\n\r\nJulius came up to be with Miles, and to help them through the\r\ndinner, the first which had been laid for many a long day.  His\r\nenquiry for Cecil was answered:  "She is progressing as favourably\r\nas there can be reason to expect, but I have not seen her.  I follow\r\nthe judgment of her faithful Grindstone."\r\n\r\n"Then she still knows nothing--"\r\n\r\n"Of her bereavement?  No.  Her state does not yet warrant it.  In\r\nfact, I almost wish I had obeyed my original impulse, and brought\r\ndown Venn to make the melancholy communication."\r\n\r\nTo every one\'s surprise Anne bristled up, saying, "Why, here is\r\nJulius, Mr. Charnock!"\r\n\r\nMr. Charnock bowed:  "I understand that my Cousin Julius has been\r\nengrossed by his wife\'s family and by the adjoining parish, the care\r\nof which he has assumed."\r\n\r\nAnne fairly coloured up, and exclaimed, "Julius has been our main-\r\nstay and help in everything--I can\'t think how he has done it.  He\r\nhas been here whenever we needed him, as well as at Wil\'sbro\', where\r\npeople have been dying everywhere, the poor Vicar and all--"\r\n\r\n"Far be it from me to discourage philanthropy," said Mr. Charnock,\r\n"only I would have it within due bounds.  I am an old-fashioned\r\nsquire, of a school, it may be, antiquated, an advocate of the\r\nparochial system; and I cannot help thinking that if this had been\r\nclosely adhered to by hot-headed young clergymen, my poor child\r\nmight not have been a childless widow at two-and-twenty."\r\n\r\nJulius was too much tired and too sad-hearted to heed greatly what\r\nMr. Charnock said.  It was so strange to have Miles in sight, yet to\r\nfeel so unable to be glad, that he scarcely heard anything.  But\r\nAnne again took up the cudgels:  "Mr. Charnock, you don\'t suppose\r\nthat it was anything Julius did that brought this fever here.  It\r\nwas going to the town-hall among the drains."\r\n\r\n"My dear Mrs. Miles Charnock, I am sure your husband will agree with\r\nme that sanitary arrangements and all connected with them are beyond\r\nthe range of ladies, who are happily exempted from all knowledge of\r\nthe subject."\r\n\r\nAnne could not say aloud that she wished Cecil had held this\r\nopinion, but she subsided, while Mr. Charnock prosed on, asking\r\nquestions about the arrangements, and seeming shocked to hear that\r\nthe funeral must be early the next day, this being one of the prime\r\ninjunctions of the doctors, and that the one had been asked to\r\nattend it.  It made him sigh again for his poor daughter, as he\r\nhanded Anne in to dinner.  She did not stay half through it, for it\r\nwas again the time for feeding Frank.  Miles went half way up-stairs\r\nwith her and returned, looking very wistful.  Julius smiled at him,\r\n"Your wife is too valuable, Miles; she is every one\'s property."\r\n\r\n"It must be very gratifying to you," added Mr. Charnock, "to find\r\nhow example and superior society have developed the native qualities\r\nyour discernment detected in the charming young lady who has just\r\nquitted us.  It was a most commendable arrangement to send her to\r\nenjoy the advantages of this place."\r\n\r\n"I sent her to be a comfort to my mother," said Miles, bluntly.\r\n\r\n"And so she has been," said Julius, fervently, but sotto voce.\r\n\r\n"I understand," said Mr. Charnock; "and as I was saying, my dear\r\nCecil expressed from the first her desire to assist in forming her\r\nstranger sister-in-law, and I am happy to see the excellent effect.\r\nI should scarcely have guessed that she came from a colony."\r\n\r\n"Indeed," Miles answered dryly.\r\n\r\nMr. Charnock might have it his own way, if he liked to think Anne\r\nhad been a Hottentot till Cecil reclaimed her.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers did feel something like joy when a message at last\r\ninformed Mr. Charnock that his daughter was awake and he might see\r\nher.  They drew nearer together, and leant against one another, with\r\nabsolute joy in the contact.  They were singularly alike in outline,\r\nvoice, and manner, in everything but colouring, and had always been\r\none in spirit, except for the strong passion for adventure which had\r\ntaken Miles to sea, to find he had chosen his profession too young\r\nto count the cost, and he held to it rather by duty than taste.\r\nSlight as had been his seniority, poor Raymond had always been on a\r\nsort of paternal pinnacle, sharing the administration with his\r\nmother, while Miles and Julius had paired on an equality.\r\n\r\n"Poor mother!" sighed Miles.  "How is she to live without him?\r\nJulius, did he leave any word for me with you?"\r\n\r\n"Above all, that Anne is the daughter for my mother, and so she is."\r\n\r\n"What, when this poor wife of Raymond\'s was said to be the superior\r\ncreature?"\r\n\r\n"You see her adoring father," said Julius.  "My Rose has necessarily\r\nher own cares, but Anne has been my mother\'s silent aid and stay for\r\nmonths, and what she has been in the present need no words can say.\r\nMy mother has had no power to take the direction of anything, her\r\nwhole being has been absorbed, first in Raymond, now in Frank; and\r\nnot only has Anne been Frank\'s constant nurse through these five\r\nweeks of the most frightful fever and delirium I have seen at all\r\nhere, but she has had thought for all, and managed all the house and\r\nservants.  We could do comparatively little, with Rose\'s brother ill\r\nat home, and the baby so young; besides, there have been eleven\r\ncases in the parish; and there was Wil\'sbro\'--but Anne has been the\r\nangel in the house."\r\n\r\n"I knew--I knew she would be everything when once the first\r\nstrangeness was over; but, poor girl, her heart is in Africa, and it\r\nhas been all exile here; I could see it in every letter, though she\r\ntried to make the best of it.  If there had but been a child here!"\r\n\r\n"I think you will find sufficient attachment to mother to weigh a\r\ngood deal with her.  Poor Anne, she did think us all very wicked at\r\nfirst, and perhaps she does still, but at least this has drawn us\r\nall nearer together."\r\n\r\nAnd then the brothers lowered their voices, and Miles heard the full\r\nhistory of Raymond\'s last illness, with all the details that Julius\r\ncould have spoken of to none else, while the sailor\'s tears slowly\r\ndropped through the hands that veiled his face.  It was a great\r\ndeprivation to him that he might not look on Raymond\'s face again,\r\nbut the medical edict had been decisive, and he had come home to be\r\nof use and not a burthen.  As Julius told Rosamond, he only\r\nthoroughly felt the blessing of Miles\'s return when he bade good\r\nnight and left the Hall, in peace and security that it had a\r\nsufficient aid and stay, and that he was not deserting it.\r\n\r\nMiles had proposed to send his wife to bed and take the night watch,\r\nand he so far prevailed that she lay down in the adjoining room in\r\nher dressing gown while he sat by Frank\'s side.  She lay where she\r\ncould feast her eyes upon him, as the lamplight fell on his ruddy\r\nbrown cheek, black hair, and steady dark eye, so sad indeed, but so\r\nfull of quiet strength and of heedful alacrity even in stillness--a\r\nlook that poor Raymond, with all his grave dignity, had never worn.\r\nThat sight was all Anne wanted.  She did not speak, she did not\r\nsleep; it was enough, more than enough, to have him there.  She was\r\ntoo much tired, body and mind, after five weeks of strain, for more\r\nthan the sense that God had given her back what she loved, and this\r\nwas \'more than peace and more than rest.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\nBreaking Down\r\n\r\n\r\nFunerals were little attended in these sad days.  The living had to\r\nbe regarded more than the dead, and Raymond Poynsett was only\r\nfollowed to the grave by his two brothers, his father-in-law, and\r\nsome of the servants.  Rosamond, however, weeping her soft profuse\r\ntears, could hear everything from behind the blind at Terry\'s open\r\nwindow, on that moist warm autumn day; everything, for no exception\r\nwas made to the rule that coffins might not be taken into the church\r\nduring this deadly sickness.  She did hear a faltering and a\r\nblundering, which caused her to look anxiously at the tall white\r\nfigure standing at the head of the grave, and, as she now saw, once\r\nor twice catching at the iron railing that fenced in the Poynsett\r\ntombs.  Neither her husband nor his brother seemed to notice what\r\nshe observed.  Absorbed in the sorrow and in one another, they\r\nturned away after the service was ended and walked towards the Hall.\r\nRosamond did not speak for a minute or two, then she turned round to\r\nTerry, who was sitting up in bed, with an awe-struck face, listening\r\nas well as he could to the low sounds, and watching her.\r\n\r\n"Terry, dear, shall you mind my going to see after Herbert Bowater?\r\nI am sure they have let him overwork himself.  If he is not fit to\r\ntake Lady Tyrrell\'s funeral this afternoon, I _shall_ send to\r\nDuddingstone on my own responsibility.  I will not have Julius doing\r\nthat!"\r\n\r\n"Do you think he is ill--Bowater, I mean?" asked Terry.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like it.  He seemed to totter as he went across the\r\nchurchyard, and he blundered.  I shall go and see."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, go," said Terry; "I don\'t want anybody.  Don\'t hurry."\r\n\r\nRosamond put on her hat and sped away to Mrs. Hornblower\'s.  As\r\nusual, the front door leading to the staircase was open, and, going\r\nup, she knocked at the sitting-room door; but the only response was\r\nsuch a whining and scratching that she supposed the dogs had been\r\nleft prisoners there and forgotten, and so she turned the lock--but\r\nthere was an obstruction; so that though Mungo and Tartar darted out\r\nand snuffed round her, only Rollo\'s paw and head appeared, and there\r\nwas a beseeching earnestness in his looks and little moans, as if\r\nentreating her to come in.  Another push, vigorously seconded by\r\nRollo within, showed her that it was Herbert\'s shoulder that\r\nhindered her, and that he was lying outstretched on the floor,\r\napparently just recalled to consciousness by the push; for as Rollo\r\nproceeded to his one remedy of licking, there was a faint murmur of\r\n"Who--what--"\r\n\r\n"It is I!  What is the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Rose!  I\'ll--I\'ll try to move--oh!"  His voice died away, and\r\nRosamond thrust in her salts, and called to Mrs. Hornblower for\r\nwater, but in vain.  However, Herbert managed to move a little to\r\none side.  She squeezed into the doorway, hastily brought water from\r\nhis bedroom within, and, kneeling down by him, bathed his face, so\r\nthat he revived to say, in the same faint voice, "I\'m so sorry I\r\nmade such mulls.  I couldn\'t see.  I thought I knew it by heart."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, never mind, dear Herbert!  You are better.  Couldn\'t\r\nyou let me help you to the sofa?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, presently;" and as she took his head on her lap, "Thank you; I\r\ndid mean to hold out till after this day\'s work; but it is all right\r\nnow Bindon is come."\r\n\r\n"Come!--is he?" she joyfully exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I saw him from the window.  I was getting up to hail him when\r\nthe room turned upside down with me."\r\n\r\n"There\'s his step!" now exclaimed Rosamond.  "Squeeze in, Mr.\r\nBindon; you are a very welcome sight."\r\n\r\nMr. Bindon did make his way in, and stood dismayed at the black mass\r\non the floor.  Rosamond and Rollo, one on each side of Herbert\'s\r\ngreat figure, in his cassock, and the rosy face deadly white, while\r\nMungo and Tartar, who hated Mr. Bindon, both began to bark, and thus\r\ndid the most for their master, whose call of \'Quiet! you brutes,\'\r\nseemed to give him sudden strength.  He took a grip of Rollo\'s curly\r\nback, and, supported by Mr. Bindon, dragged himself to the sofa and\r\nfell heavily back on it.\r\n\r\n"Give him some brandy," said Mr. Bindon, hastily.\r\n\r\n"There\'s not a drop of anything," muttered Herbert; "it\'s all gone--\r\n"\r\n\r\n"To Wil\'sbro\'," explained Rosamond; then seeing the scared face of\r\nDilemma at the door, she hastily gave a message, and sent her flying\r\nto the Rectory, while Mr. Bindon was explaining.\r\n\r\n"I wish I had known.  I never will go out of the reach of letters\r\nagain.  I saw in the Times, at Innspruck, a mention of typhoid fever\r\nhere, and I came back as fast as trains would bring me; but too\r\nlate, I fear."\r\n\r\n"You are welcome, indeed," repeated Rosamond.  "Herbert has broken\r\ndown at last, after doing more than man could do, and I am most\r\nthankful that my husband should be saved the funerals at Wil\'sbro\'."\r\n\r\nMr. Bindon, whose face showed how shocked he was, made a few\r\ninquiries.  He had learnt the main facts on his way, but had been\r\nseeking his junior to hear the details, and he looked, like the\r\nwarrior who had missed Thermopylae, ashamed and grieved at his\r\nholiday.\r\n\r\nThe bottle Rosamond had sent for arrived, and there was enough\r\nvigour restored to make her say, "Here\'s a first service, Mr.\r\nBindon, to help this poor fellow into bed."\r\n\r\n"No, no!" exclaimed Herbert.\r\n\r\n"You are not going to say there\'s nothing the matter with you?" said\r\nRosamond, as a flush passed over the pale face.\r\n\r\n"No," he said; "but I want to go home.  I should have taken a fly at\r\nWil\'sbro\'.  Cranky will see to me without bothering anybody else.\r\nIf you would send for one--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I can till I know whether you are fit to move," said\r\nRosamond.  "I desired Dilemma to tell them to send Dr. Worth here\r\nwhen he comes to Terry.  Besides, is it quite right to carry _this_\r\ninto another place?"\r\n\r\n"I never thought of that," said Herbert.  "But they would shut me\r\nup; nobody come near me but Cranky."  But there a shivering fit\r\ncaught him, so that the sofa shook with him, and Rosamond covered\r\nhim with rugs, and again told him bed was the only place for him,\r\nand he consented at last, holding his head as he rose, dizzy with\r\nthe ache.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Lady Rose," he said, falling back into a sitting posture\r\nat the first attempt, "where\'s my writing-case?  If I go off my\r\nhead, will you give this to the Rector, and ask him if it will be\r\nany good in the matter he knows of?" and he handed her an envelope.\r\n"And this keep," he added, giving her one addressed to his father.\r\n"Don\'t let him have it till it\'s all over.  You know."  Then he took\r\nup a pen and a sheet of paper, and got as far, with a shaking hand,\r\nas \'Dear Crank--\' but there he broke down, and laid his head on the\r\ntable, groaning.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do it.  What shall I say, dear Herbert?"\r\n\r\n"Only tell her to come to me," he gasped.  "Cranstoun--our old\r\nnurse.  Then I\'ll be no trouble."\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Bindon helped Herbert into his room, Rosamond sped home to\r\nsend for Mrs. Cranstoun, arrange for the care of the new patient in\r\nthe intervening hours, and fetch some of those alleviations of which\r\nexperience had taught the use.  Mr. Bindon came to meet her on her\r\nreturn, carefully shutting the door, and saying, "Lady Rosamond, can\r\nhe be delirious already?  He is talking of being plucked for his\r\nOrdination."\r\n\r\n"Too true," said Rosamond.  "I thought it a great shame to be so\r\nhard on a man with _that_ in him; but I believe you expected it?"\r\n\r\n"No; I may have said he would fail, but I never expected it."\r\n\r\n"Fail, indeed!  Fancy a man being turned back who has worked night\r\nand day--night and day--doing all the very hardest services--never\r\nresting!  Very likely killing himself!" cried Rosamond hotly.  "May\r\nI come back to him?  Terry can spare me, and if you will go to\r\nWil\'sbro\' I\'ll stay till my husband comes, or the doctor.  The\r\nSisters will tell you what to do."\r\n\r\nHerbert was, however, so much more comfortable for being in bed,\r\nthat he was able to give Mr. Bindon directions as to the immediate\r\ncares at Wil\'sbro\'; but he was distressed at occupying Lady Rose,\r\nhis great object being to be no trouble to anybody, though he had\r\nseen so much of the disease as to have been fully aware that it had\r\nbeen setting in for the last two days, yet his resolution to spare\r\nhis Rector had kept him afoot till he had seen other help arrive.\r\nHe declared that he wanted nobody but Rollo, who could fetch and\r\ncarry, and call any one, if only the doors were open, and really the\r\ncreature\'s wistful eyes and gentle movements justified the\r\ncommendation.\r\n\r\n"Only," said Herbert anxiously, "I suppose this is not catching for\r\ndogs.  You\'ll make a home for him Lady Rose?" he added.  "I should\r\nlike you to have him, and he\'ll be happier with you than with any\r\none else."\r\n\r\n"Herbert, I can\'t have you talk of that."\r\n\r\n"Very well," he said, quietly.  "Only you will keep my dear old\r\nfellow--I\'ve had him from a puppy--and he is but three years old\r\nnow."\r\n\r\nRosamond gave all promises, from her full heart, as she fondled the\r\nsoft, wise black head.\r\n\r\nHerbert was unhappy too about Mrs. Hornblower\'s trouble.  Harry had\r\nbeen one of the slighter cases, and was still in his room, a good\r\ndeal subdued by the illness, and by the attention the lodger had\r\nshown him; for Herbert had spent many hours, when he had been\r\nsupposed to be resting, in relieving Mrs. Hornblower, and she was\r\nnow in a flood of gratitude, only longing to do everything for him\r\nherself.  Had he not, as she declared, saved her son, body and soul?\r\n\r\nThe most welcome sight was Julius, who came down in dismay as soon\r\nas he could leave the Hall.  "I am so glad," said the patient; "I\r\nwant to talk things over while my head is clearer than it ever may\r\nbe again."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t begin by desponding.  These fevers are much less severe now\r\nthan six weeks ago."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but they always go the hardest with the great big strong young\r\nfellows.  I\'ve buried twelve young men out of the whole forty-five."\r\n\r\n"Poor lads, I doubt if their life had been such a preparation as\r\nyours."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk of my life.  A stewardship I never set myself to\r\ncontemplate, and so utterly failed in.  I\'ve got nothing to carry to\r\nmy God but broken vows and a wasted year."\r\n\r\n"Nothing can be brought but repentance."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but look at others who have tried, felt their duties, and\r\ncared for souls; while I thought only of my vows as a restraint, and\r\ntried how much pleasure I could get in spite of them.  A pretty\r\nstory of all the ministry I shall ever have."\r\n\r\n"These last weeks!"\r\n\r\n"Common humanity--nonsense!  I should always have done as much;\r\nbesides, I was crippled everywhere, not merely by want of power as a\r\npriest, but by having made myself such a shallow, thoughtless ass.\r\nBut that was not what I wanted to say.  It was about Gadley and his\r\nconfession."\r\n\r\n"O, Herbert!  I am afraid I was very unkind that night.  I did not\r\nthink of anything but our own trouble, nor see how much it had cost\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Of course not--nonsense.  You had enough to think of yourself, and\r\nI was only ashamed of having bored you."\r\n\r\n"And when I think of the state of that room, I am afraid it was then\r\nyou took in the poison."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say _afraid_.  If it was for Jenny, I shall have done some\r\ngood in the world.  But the thing is--is it good?  Will it clear\r\nDouglas?  I suppose what he said to you was under seal of\r\nconfession?"\r\n\r\n"Scarcely so, technically; but when a man unburthens himself on his\r\ndeath-bed, and then, so far from consenting, shows terror and dismay\r\nat the notion of his words being taken down as evidence, it seems to\r\nme hardly right or honourable to make use of them--though it would\r\nright a great wrong.  But what did you get from him?"\r\n\r\n"I gave Lady Rose the paper.  He raved most horribly for an hour or\r\ntwo, as if all the foul talk of his pot-house had got into his\r\nbrain," said Herbert, with a shudder.  "Rector, Rector, pray for me,\r\nthat I mayn\'t come out with _that_ at any rate.  It has haunted me\r\never since.  Well, at last he slept, and woke up sinking but\r\nconscious, knew me, and began to ask if this was death, and was\r\nfrightened, clutching at me, and asking to be held, and what he\r\ncould do.  I told him at least he could undo a wrong, if he would\r\nonly authorize us to use what he said to clear Douglas; and then, as\r\nSister Margaret had come across, I wrote as well as I could:\r\n"George Gadley authorizes what he said to the Rev. Julius Charnock\r\nto be used as evidence;" and I suppose he saw us sign it, if he\r\ncould see at all, for his sight was nearly gone."\r\n\r\nJulius drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n"And now, what was it?" said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Well, the trio--Moy, young Proudfoot, and Tom Vivian--detained a\r\nletter of my mother\'s, with a cheque in it, and threw the blame of\r\nit on Archie Douglas.  They thought no one was in the office but\r\nthemselves; but Gadley was a clerk there, and was in the outer room,\r\nwhere he heard all.  He came to Moy afterwards, and has been preying\r\non him for hush-money ever since."\r\n\r\n"And this will set things straight?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  How to set about the public justification I do not yet see;\r\nbut with your father, and all the rest, Archie\'s innocence will be\r\nas plain as it always has been to us."\r\n\r\n"Where is he?"\r\n\r\n"On an ostrich farm at Natal."\r\n\r\n"Whew!--we must have him home.  Jenny can\'t be spared.  Poor Jenny,\r\nwhen she hears that, it will make all other things light to her."\r\n\r\n"What is their address?"\r\n\r\n"No, don\'t write.  Mamma has had a fresh cold, and neither my father\r\nnor Jenny could leave her.  Let them have a little peace till it\r\ngets worse.  There will be plenty of time, if it is to be a twenty-\r\neight days business like the others.  Poor mamma!" and he rolled his\r\nhead away; then, after some minutes of tossing and shivering, he\r\nasked for a prayer out of the little book in his pocket.  "I should\r\nknow it, but my memory is muddled, I think."\r\n\r\nThe book--a manual for sick-rooms--was one which Julius had given\r\nhim new five weeks back.  It showed wear already, having been used\r\nas often in that time as in six ordinary years of parish work.  By\r\nthe time the hard-pressed doctor came, it was plain that the fever\r\nwas setting in severely, aggravated no doubt by the dreadful night\r\nat the \'Three Pigeons,\' and the unrelaxed exertions ever since; for\r\nhe was made to allow that he had come home in the chill morning air,\r\ncold, sickened, and exhausted; had not chosen to disturb anybody,\r\nand had found no refreshment but a raw apple--the last drop of wine\r\nhaving been bestowed on the sick; had lain down for a short sleep\r\nworse than waking, and had neither eaten nor slept since, but worked\r\non by sheer strength of will and muscle.  When Julius thought of the\r\ncherishing care that he had received himself, he shuddered, with a\r\nsort of self-reproach for his neglect; and the doctor, though good-\r\nhumouredly telling Herbert not to think he knew anything about his\r\nown symptoms, did not conceal from Julius that enough harm had been\r\ndone in these few days to give the fine Bowater constitution a hard\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\n"Grown careless," he said.  "Regular throwing away of his life."\r\n\r\nCareless Herbert might have been, but Julius wondered whether this\r\nmight not be losing of the life to find it.\r\n\r\nCranstoun or Cranky arrived, a charming old nurse, much gratified in\r\nthe midst of her grief, and inclination to scold.  She summarily\r\nsent off Mungo and Tartar by the conveyance that brought her, and\r\nwould have sent Rollo away, but that Herbert protested against it,\r\nand no power short of an order from him would have taken the dog\r\nfrom his bedside.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Bindon returned from Wil\'sbro\' in unspeakable surprise.\r\n"The heroes of the occasion," he said, "were Bowater and Mrs.\r\nDuncombe!  Every sick person I visited, and there were fourteen in\r\nall stages, had something to say of one or other.  Poor things, how\r\ntheir faces fell when they saw me instead of his bright, honest\r\nface!  \'Cheering the very heart of one!\' as a poor woman said;\r\n\'That\'s what I calls a true shepherd,\' said an old man.  You don\'t\r\nreally mean he was rejected at the Ordination?\'"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and it will make him the still truer shepherd, if he is only\r\nspared!"\r\n\r\n"The Sisters can\'t say enough of him.  They thought him very ill\r\nyesterday, and implored him to take care of himself; but he declared\r\nhe could not leave these two funerals to you.  But, after all, he is\r\nless amazing to me than Mrs. Duncombe.  She has actually been living\r\nat the hospital with the Sisters.  I should not have known her."\r\n\r\n"Great revolutions have happened in your absence.  Much that has\r\ndrawn out her sterling worth, poor woman."\r\n\r\n"I shall never speak harshly again, I hope.  It seems to be a\r\njudgment on me that I should have been idling on the mountains,\r\nwhile those two were thus devoting themselves to my Master in His\r\npoor."\r\n\r\n"We are thankful enough to have you coming in fresh, instead of\r\nbreaking down now.  Have you a sermon?  You will have to take\r\nWil\'sbro\' to-morrow.  Driver won\'t come.  He wrote to the\r\nchurchwardens that he had a cold, and that his agreement was with\r\npoor Fuller."\r\n\r\n"And you undertook the Sunday?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  They would naturally have no Celebration, and I thought\r\nHerbert\'s preaching in the midst of his work would be good for them.\r\nYou never heard such an apology and confession as the boy made to\r\nour people the first Sunday here, begging them to bear with him."\r\n\r\n"Then I can\'t spare you anything here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, much care and anxiety.  The visitation has done its worst in\r\nour house.  We have got into the lull after the storm, and you need\r\nnot be anxious about me.  There is peace in what I have to do now.\r\nIt is gathering the salvage after the wreck."\r\n\r\nThen Julius went into his own house, where he found Terry alone,\r\nand, as usual, ravenously hungry.\r\n\r\n"Is Bowater really ill?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid there is no believing otherwise, Terry," said Julius.\r\n"You will have to spare Rose to him sometimes, till some one comes\r\nto nurse him."\r\n\r\n"I would spare anything to him," said Terry, fervently.  "Julius, it\r\nis finer than going into battle!"\r\n\r\n"I thought you did not care much for battles, Terry."\r\n\r\n"If it was battles, I should not mind," said the boy; "it is\r\npeaceful soldiering that I have seen too much of.  But don\'t you\r\nbother my father, Julius, I won\'t grumble any more; I made up my\r\nmind to that."\r\n\r\n"I know you did, my boy; but you did so much futile arithmetic, and\r\nso often told us that a+b-c equalled Peter the Great, that Dr. Worth\r\nsaid you must not be put to mathematics for months to come, and I\r\nhave told your father that if he cannot send you to Oxford, we will\r\nmanage it."\r\n\r\nA flush of joy lighted up the boy\'s face.  "Julius, you are a brick\r\nof a brother!" he said.  "I\'ll do my best to get a scholarship."\r\n\r\n"And the best towards that you can do now is to get well as soon as\r\npossible."\r\n\r\n"Yes.  And you lie down on the sofa there, Julius, and sleep--Rose\r\nwould say you must.  Only I want to say one thing more, please.  If\r\nI do get to Oxford, and you are so good, I\'ve made up my mind to one\r\nthing.  It\'s not only for the learning that I\'ll go; but I\'ll try to\r\nbe a soldier in your army and Bowater\'s.  That\'s all that seems to\r\nme worth the doing now."\r\n\r\nSo Julius dropped asleep, with a thankworthy augury in his ears.  It\r\nis not triumph, but danger and death that lead generous spirits each\r\nto step where his comrade stood!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\nThe Salvage\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank was certainly better.  Ever since that sight of Eleonora he\r\nhad been mending.  If he muttered her name, or looked distressed, it\r\nwas enough to guide his hand to her token, he smiled and slept\r\nagain; and on the Sunday morning his throat and mouth were so much\r\nbetter, that he could both speak and swallow without nearly so much\r\npain; but one of his earliest sayings was, "Louder, please, I can\'t\r\nhear.  When does she come?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett raised her voice, Anne tried; but he frowned and\r\nsighed, and only when Miles uttered a sea-captain\'s call close to\r\nhis ear, did he smile comprehension, adding, "Were you shouting?" a\r\nfact only too evident to those around.\r\n\r\n"Then I\'m deaf," he said.  And Anne wrote and set before him, "We\r\nhope it will pass as you get better."  He looked grateful, but there\r\nwas little more communication, for his eyes and head were still\r\nweak, and signs and looks were the chief currency; however, Julius\r\nmet Eleonora after morning service, to beg her to renew her visit,\r\nafter having first prepared her for what she would find.  Eleonora\r\nwas much distressed; then paused a minute, and said, "It does him\r\ngood to see me?"\r\n\r\n"It seems to be the one thing that keeps him up," said Julius,\r\nsurprised at the question.\r\n\r\n"O, yes!  I can\'t--I could not stay away," she said.  "It is all so\r\nwrong together; yet this last time cannot hurt!"\r\n\r\n"Last time?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; did you not know that papa has set his heart on going to\r\nLondon to-morrow?  Yes, early to-morrow.  And it will be for ever.\r\nWe shall never see Sirenwood again."\r\n\r\nShe stood still, almost bent with the agony of suppressed grief.\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry; but I do not wonder he wishes for change."\r\n\r\n"He has been in an agony to go these three days.  It was all I could\r\ndo to get him to stay to-day.  You don\'t think it will do Frank\r\nharm?  Then I would stay, if I took lodgings in the village; but\r\notherwise--poor papa--I think it is my duty--and he can\'t do without\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"I think Frank is quite capable of understanding that you are forced\r\nto go, and that he need not be the worse for it."\r\n\r\n"And then," she lowered her voice, "it does a little reconcile me\r\nthat I don\'t think we ought to go further into it till we can\r\nunderstand.  I did make that dreadful vow.  I know I ought not now;\r\nbut still I did, in so many words."\r\n\r\n"You mean against a gambler?"\r\n\r\n"If it had only been against a gambler; but I was stung, and wanted\r\nto guard myself, and made it against any one who had ever betted!\r\nIf I go on, I must break it, you see, and if I do might it not bring\r\nmischief on him?  I don\'t even feel as if it were _true_ to have\r\ncome to him on Friday, and now--yet they said it was the only chance\r\nfor his life."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think it saved him then, and to disappoint him now might\r\nquite possibly bring a relapse," said Julius.  "It seems to me that\r\nyou can only act as seems right at the moment.  When he is his own\r\nman again, you will better have the power of judging about this vow,\r\nand if it ought to bind you.  And so, it may really be well you do\r\nnot see more of him, and that his weakness does not lead you further\r\nthan you mean."\r\n\r\nA tottering step, and an almost agonized, though very short sob\r\nunder the crape veil, proved to Julius that his counsel, though\r\nchiming in with her stronger, sterner judgment, was terrible to her,\r\nnor would he have given it, if he had not had reason to fear that\r\nwhile she had grown up, Frank had grown down; and that, after this\r\nillness, it would have to be proved whether he were indeed worthy of\r\nthe high-minded girl whom he had himself almost thrown over in a\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nBut there was no room for such misgivings when the electric shock of\r\nactual presence was felt--the thin hollow-cheeked face shone with\r\nwelcome, the liquid brown eyes smiled with thankful sweetness, the\r\nfingers, fleshless, but cool and gentle, were held out; and the\r\nfaint voice said, "My darling!  Once try to make me hear."\r\n\r\nAnd when, with all her efforts, she could only make him give a sort\r\nof smile of disappointment, she would have been stonyhearted indeed\r\nif she had not let him fondle her hand as he would, while she\r\nlistened to his mother\'s report of his improvement.  With those eyes\r\nfixed in such content on her face, it seemed absolutely barbarous to\r\nfalter forth that she could come no more, for her father was taking\r\nher away.\r\n\r\n"My dear, you must be left with us," cried Mrs. Poynsett.  "He\r\ncannot spare you."\r\n\r\n"Ah! but my poor father.  He is lost without me.  And I came of age\r\non Tuesday, and there are papers to sign."\r\n\r\n"What is it?" murmured Frank, watching their faces.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett gave her the pen, saying, "You must tell him, if it is\r\nto be."\r\n\r\nShe wrote:  "My father takes me to London to-morrow, to meet the\r\nlawyers."\r\n\r\nHis face fell; but he asked, "Coming back--when?"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, and her eyes filled with tears, as she wrote:\r\n"Sirenwood is to be put up to auction."\r\n\r\n"Your sister?" began Frank, and then his eye fell on her crape\r\ntrimmings.  He touched her sleeve, and made a low wail.  "Oh! is\r\nevery one dead?"\r\n\r\nIt was the first perception he had shown of any death, though\r\nmourning had been worn in his room.  His mother leant down to kiss\r\nhim, bidding Lena tell him the truth; and she wrote:\r\n\r\n"I am left alone with poor papa.  Let me go--now you can do without\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Can I?" he asked, again grasping her hand.\r\n\r\nShe pointed to his mother and Anne; but he repeated, "You--you!"\r\n\r\n"When you are better we will see how it is to be," she wrote.\r\n\r\nHe looked sadly wistful.  "No, I can\'t now.  Something was very\r\nwrong; but it won\'t come back.  By and by.  If you wouldn\'t go--"\r\n\r\nBut his voice was now more weak and weary, tired by the effort, and\r\na little kneeling by him, allowing his tender touch, soothed him,\r\nenough to say submissively, "Good-bye, then--I\'ll come for you"--\r\nwherewith he faltered into slumber.\r\n\r\nRosamond had just seen her off in the pony carriage, and was on the\r\nway up-stairs, when she stumbled on a little council, consisting of\r\nDr. Worth, Mr. Charnock, and Grindstone, all in the gallery.  "A\r\nwidow in her twenty-second year.  Good heavens!" was the echo she\r\nheard; and Grindstone was crying and saying, "She did it for the\r\nbest, and she could not do it, poor lamb, not if you killed her for\r\nit;" and Dr. Worth said, "Perhaps Lady Rosamond can.  You see, Lady\r\nRosamond, Mrs. Grindstone, whose care I must say has been devoted,\r\nhas hitherto staved off the sad question from poor young Mrs.\r\nPoynsett, until now it is no longer possible, and she is becoming so\r\nexcited, that--"\r\n\r\nCecil\'s bell rang sharply.\r\n\r\n"I cannot--I cannot!  In her twenty-second year!" cried her father,\r\nwringing his hands.\r\n\r\nGrindstone\'s face was all tears and contortions; and Rosamond,\r\nrecollecting her last words with poor Cecil, sprang forward, both\r\nmen opening a way for her.\r\n\r\nCecil was sitting up in bed, very thin, but with eager eyes and\r\nflushed cheeks, as she held out her hands.  "Rosamond!  Oh!  But\r\naren\'t you afraid?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, I\'m always in it now," said Rosamond, kissing her, and\r\nlaying her down; "it has been everywhere."\r\n\r\n"Ah! then they sent him away--Raymond?" then clutching Rosamond\'s\r\nhand, and looking at her with searching eyes, "Tell me, has his\r\nmother any right!  Would you bear it if she kept _you_ apart?"\r\n\r\n"Ah!  Cecil, it was not her doing."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean it was his own?  Papa is not afraid.  You are not\r\nafraid.  If it had been he, I wouldn\'t have feared anything.  I\r\nwould have nursed him day and night till--till I made him care for\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Hush, dear Cecil," said Rosamond, with great difficulty.  "I know\r\nyou would, and so would he have done for you, only the cruel fever\r\nkept you apart."\r\n\r\n"The fever!  He had it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he _had_ it."\r\n\r\n"But he is better.  I am better.  Let me be taken to him.  His\r\nmother is not there now.  I heard them say she was in Frank\'s room.\r\nCall papa.  He will carry me."\r\n\r\n"Oh! poor, poor Cecil.  His mother only went to Frank when he did\r\nnot need her any more."  And Rosamond hid her face on the bed,\r\nafraid to look.\r\n\r\nCecil lay back so white, that Grindstone approached with some drops,\r\nbut this made her spring up, crying, "No, no, don\'t come near me!\r\nYou never told me!  You deceived me!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, don\'t, ma\'am--my dear Miss Charnock--now.  It was all for\r\nthe best.  You would not have been here now."\r\n\r\n"And then I should be with him.  Rosamond, send her away, I can\'t\r\nbear her.  She sent him away from me that night.  I heard her."\r\n\r\n"My dear Cecil, this will not do.  You are making your father\r\ndreadfully unhappy.  Dear Raymond stayed with you till he really\r\ncould not sit up any longer, and then he kissed you."\r\n\r\n"Kissed me!  Oh, where?  Did you see?  No, don\'t ask Grindstone.\r\nShe made me think he had left me, and fancy--oh, Rosamond! such--\r\nsuch things!  And all the time--"\r\n\r\nThe moaning became an anguish of distress, unable to weep, like\r\nterrible pain, as the poor young thing writhed in Rosamond\'s arms.\r\nIt was well that this one sister understood what had been in Cecil\'s\r\nheart, and did believe in her love for Raymond.  Rosamond, too, had\r\ncaressing power beyond any other of the family, and thus she could\r\nbetter deal with the sufferer, striving, above all, to bring tears\r\nby what she whispered to her as she held her to her bosom.  They\r\nwere a terrible storm at last, but Cecil clung to Rosamond through\r\nall, absolutely screaming when Grindstone came near; poor Grindstone\r\nwho had been so devoted, though mistaken.  Weakness, however, after\r\nthe first violent agitation was soothed, favoured a kind of stunned\r\ntorpor, and Cecil lay still, except when her maid tried to do\r\nanything for her, and then the passion returned.  When old Susan\r\nAlston came with a message, she was at once recognized and\r\nmonopolized, and became the only servant whom she would suffer about\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe inconvenience was great, but relapse was such an imminent\r\ndanger, that it was needful to give up everything to her; and Mr.\r\nCharnock, regarding his daughter\'s sufferings as the only ones worth\r\nconsideration, seemed to pursue Rosamond the instant she had sat\r\ndown by the still feeble, weary, convalescent Terry, imploring her\r\nto return to Cecil with the irresistible force of tearful eyes and\r\npiteous descriptions; and as Terry had a week\'s start in recovery,\r\nand was not a widow under twenty-two, he had to submit, and lie as\r\ncontentedly as he could in his solitude.\r\n\r\nSusan could be better spared to Cecil\'s morbid fancy of being waited\r\non by her who had attended her husband, for Miles and Anne were\r\nsufficient for Mrs. Poynsett and Frank.  The long-sundered husband\r\nand wife scarcely saw each other, except over Frank\'s bed, and Mr.\r\nCharnock was on the Captain\'s hands whenever he came beyond it.  On\r\nthe Wednesday, however, Julius, who had only once spoken to his\r\nbrother alone, came up to the breakfast-table where he and Mr.\r\nCharnock were sitting, and hurt the feelings of the latter by first\r\nasking for Frank.  "He had slept all night, and only half woke when\r\nMiles and Anne changed watch and gave him beef-tea.  Cecil, very\r\nmoaning and restless--more fever about her, poor dear.  When would\r\nLady Rosamond come up?--she was asking for her."  When she had seen\r\nto a few things at home, given her brother his breakfast, and seen\r\nto poor Herbert; he had had a dreadful night, and that Cranstoun\r\n_would_ shut the window unless some one defended him.  Mr. Charnock\r\nbegan to resume his daughter\'s symptoms, when Julius, at the first\r\npause, said:\r\n\r\n"Have you finished, Miles?  Could you speak to me in the library a\r\nminute?  I beg your pardon, Mr. Charnock, but my time is short."\r\n\r\n"I hope--I quite understand.  Do not let me be in your way."  And\r\nthe brothers repaired to the library, where Julius\'s first words\r\nwere, "Miles, you must make up your mind.  They are getting up a\r\nrequisition to you to stand for Wil\'sbro\'."\r\n\r\n"To me?"\r\n\r\n"You are the most obvious person, and the feeling for dear Raymond\r\nis so strong as to prevent any contest.  Whitlock told Bindon\r\nyesterday that you should have no trouble."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t.  It is absurd.  I know nothing about it.  My poor mother\r\nbred up Raymond for nothing else.  Don\'t you remember how she made\r\nhim read history, volumes upon volumes, while I was learning nothing\r\nbut the ropes?  I declare, Julius, there he goes."\r\n\r\n"Who?"\r\n\r\n"Why, that old ass, down to hunt up poor Rosamond; I don\'t believe\r\nhe thinks there\'s any one in the world but his daughter.  I declare\r\nI\'ll hail him and stop him."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Miles, Rosamond can take care of herself.  She won\'t come\r\ntill she has seen to her patients down there; and, after all,\r\nCecil\'s is the saddest case, poor thing.  To return.  If you don\'t\r\ntake to politics in the end, I think you should let them put you in\r\nnow, if only as a stop-gap, or we shall get some one whom it may not\r\nbe easy to get rid of."\r\n\r\n"There\'s something in that, but I can\'t accept without knowing my\r\nposition, and I would not utter a word to disturb my mother till it\r\noccurs to her of herself."\r\n\r\n"Now that Frank is better?"\r\n\r\n"No.  It will all come on her soon enough."\r\n\r\n"Would you stand if she made it right for you?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell.  There would be no punishment so great to my poor\r\nAnne as to be dragged into society, and I don\'t know how she would\r\nbear it, even if she had no scruples.  We never thought of anything\r\nbut settling in Glen Fraser, only I wanted her to know you all.  If\r\nthat poor Cecil only had a child we could be free to go back.  Poor\r\nAnne!"\r\n\r\n"Do you think she is still as homesick as at first?"\r\n\r\n"Well, not quite, perhaps; but I never can get to talk to her, and I\r\nknow it is a terrible sacrifice to her to live here at all, and I\r\nwon\'t have her forced into a style of thing against her conscience.\r\nIf they come to me, I shall tell them to take Mr. Bowater."\r\n\r\n"Poor Mr. Bowater!  He will have little heart."\r\n\r\n"Who else is there?  That fellow Moy would like it, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"That fellow Moy may have to change his note," said Julius.  "I\r\nthink we have the means of clearing Archie, when we can see how to\r\nuse them."\r\n\r\nMiles gave a sort of leap as he stood by the fire.  "Tell me.\r\nArchie!  I had no heart to write to him, poor fellow."\r\n\r\n"Write to him by all means, but say nothing here."  And Julius\r\nbriefly repeated what Gadley had said.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that the scoundrel Moy deserves any consideration."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether he does; but he has a good wife, ailing and\r\nsickly, and a daughter.  He has lived in good report these many\r\nyears, and I think it is due to him and to old Proudfoot not to\r\nspread the report before giving him warning.  In fact, I am not sure\r\nwhether we could proceed against him as things stand."\r\n\r\n"It is just what Raymond would have known," said Miles, with a sigh;\r\n"but you are right, Julius, one ought to give him fair play.  Ah!\r\nwhat\'s that, Jenkins?--Note from Lord Belfort?  Wait for an answer.\r\nCan\'t they give one any peace?"\r\n\r\nWhile Miles was reluctantly answering his note, Julius, resolving to\r\nact before he was forbidden, mounted to Frank\'s room, requested to\r\nspeak with his mother, and propelled her into the outer room,\r\nleaving Anne on guard.\r\n\r\n"Now then, my dear," she said, "I have known a talk must soon come.\r\nYou have all been very good to me to leave it so long."\r\n\r\n"I am come now without poor Miles\'s knowledge or consent," said\r\nJulius, "because it is necessary for him to know what to do."\r\n\r\n"He will give up the navy," said his mother.  "O, Julius! does he\r\nrequire to be told that he--?" and she laid her head on her son\'s\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n"It is what he cannot bear to be told; but what drives me on is that\r\nWhitlock tells me that the Wil\'sbro\' people want to bring him in at\r\nonce, as the strongest proof of their feeling for Raymond."\r\n\r\n"Yes," she raised her head proudly, "of course he must come forward.\r\nHe need have no doubt.  Send him to me, Julius, I will tell him to\r\nopen letters, and put matters in train.  Perhaps you will write to\r\nGraves for me, if he does not like it, poor boy."\r\n\r\nShe had roused herself into the woman of business, and when Miles,\r\nafter some indignation at her having been disturbed, obeyed the\r\nsummons, she held out her arms, and became the consoler.\r\n\r\n"Come, my boy," she said, "we must face it sooner or later.  You\r\nmust stand foremost and take up his work for him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother! mother! you know how little I am able," said Miles,\r\ncovering his face with his hands.\r\n\r\n"You do not bring his burthened heart to the task," she said.  "If\r\nyou had watched and felt with him, as perhaps only his mother could,\r\nyou would know that I can be content that the long heartache should\r\nhave ceased, where the weary are at rest.  Yes, Miles, I feel as if\r\nI had put him to sleep after a long day of pain, as when he was a\r\nlittle child."\r\n\r\nThey hardened themselves to the discussion, Mrs. Poynsett explaining\r\nwhat she thought the due of her eldest son, only that Cecil\'s\r\njointure would diminish the amount at her disposal.  Indeed, when\r\nshe was once aroused, she attended the most fully; but when Miles\r\nfound her apologizing for only affording him the little house in the\r\nvillage, he cried out with consternation.\r\n\r\n"My dear," she said, "it is best so; I will not be a burthen on you\r\nyoung ones.  I see the mistake."\r\n\r\n"I know," stammered Miles, "my poor Anne is not up to your mark--not\r\nclever like you or Jenny--but I thought you did like her pretty\r\nhandy ways."\r\n\r\n"I feel them and love them with all my heart; but I cannot have her\r\nhappiness and yours sacrificed to me.  Yes, you boys love the old\r\nnest; but even Julius and Rose rejoice in their own, and you must\r\nsee what she really wishes, not what she thinks her duty.  Take her\r\nout walking, you both need it badly enough."\r\n\r\nThey ventured to comply, and eluding Mr. Charnock, went into the\r\npark, silvery with the unstanched dews, and the leaves floating down\r\none by one like golden rain.  "Not much like the Bush," said Miles.\r\n\r\n"No," was all Anne durst say.\r\n\r\n"Poor Nan, how dreary it must have looked to you last year!"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I wrote very complaining letters!"\r\n\r\n"Not complaining, but a direful little effort at content, showing\r\nthe more piteously, because involuntarily, what a mistake I had\r\nmade."\r\n\r\n"No, no mistake.  Indeed, Miles, it was not.  Nothing else would\r\nhave cured me of the dreadful uncharitableness which was the chief\r\ncause of my unhappiness, and if I had not been so forlorn, I should\r\nnever have seen how good and patient your mother was with me.  Yes,\r\nI mean it.  I read over my old diary and saw how tiresome and\r\npresumptuous I was, and how wonderfully she bore with me, and so did\r\nJulius and Rosamond, while all the time I fancied them--no\r\nChristians."\r\n\r\n"Ah! you child!  You know I would never have done it if I had known\r\nyou were to be swamped among brides.  At any rate, this poor old\r\nplace doesn\'t look so woefully dismal and hateful to you now."\r\n\r\n"It could not, where you are, and where I have so many to know and\r\nlove."\r\n\r\n"You can bear the downfall of our Bush schemes?"\r\n\r\n"Your duty is here now."\r\n\r\n"Are you grieved, little one?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know.  I should like to have seen mamma; but she does not\r\nneed me now as your mother does."\r\n\r\n"Then you are willing to be her daughter?"\r\n\r\n"I have tried hard, and she is very kind; but I am far too dull and\r\nignorant for her.  I can only wait upon her; but when she has you\r\nand Julius to talk to, my stupidity will not matter."\r\n\r\n"Would you be content to devote yourself to her, instead of making a\r\nhome of our own?"\r\n\r\n"She can\'t be left alone in that great house."\r\n\r\n"The question is, can you be happy in it? or do you wish for a house\r\nto ourselves?"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t, Miles, it is your own home."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not the question."\r\n\r\n"Miles, why do you look at me so?"\r\n\r\n"I was told to ascertain your wishes."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wish anything--now I have you--but to be a comfort to your\r\nmother.  That is my first earthly wish just now."\r\n\r\n"If that be earthly, it has a touch of the heavenly," muttered Miles\r\nto himself.  "You will make it clear to mother then that you like to\r\ngo on with her?"\r\n\r\n"If she does not mind having me."\r\n\r\n"And Julius says it really cheered our dear Raymond to think you\r\nwould be the one to look after her!  But that\'s not all, Nanny, I\'ve\r\nonly till to-morrow to decide whether I am to be Member for\r\nWil\'sbro\'."\r\n\r\n"Is that a duty?"\r\n\r\n"Not such a duty as to bind me if it were altogether repugnant to\r\nyou.  I was not brought up for it, and may be a mere stop-gap, but\r\nit is every man\'s duty to come to the front when he is called for,\r\nand do his utmost for his country in Parliament, I suppose, as much\r\nas in action."\r\n\r\n"I see; but it would be leaving your mother alone a great deal."\r\n\r\n"Not necessarily.  You could stay here part of the time, and I go\r\nbackwards and forwards, as Raymond did before his marriage."\r\n\r\n"It would be better than your being at sea."\r\n\r\n"But remember," he added, "there is much that can\'t be shirked.  I\r\ndon\'t mean currying popularity, but if one is in that position,\r\nthere\'s no shutting oneself up.  It becomes a duty to keep society\r\ngoing, and give it the sort of tone that a nice woman can do.  Do\r\nyou see?"\r\n\r\n"I think I do.  Julius said so once."\r\n\r\n"So if we are to have such tears and despair as there were about the\r\nball in the Chimaera, then--"\r\n\r\n"I was wrong then," said Anne.  "I did not behave at all well to you\r\nall that time, dear Miles; I have been sorry for it ever since I\r\nunderstood."\r\n\r\n"It was not you, little one, it was Mr. Pilgrim."\r\n\r\n"No, it was not Mr. Pilgrim who made me cross."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was.  He exacted pledges that he had no right to lay on\r\nyour conscience, and your poor little conscience was in terrible\r\nstraits, and I was too angry to feel for it.  Never mind all that;\r\nyou have done with the fellow, and understand better now."\r\n\r\n"He thought he was right, and that only such abstinence could guard\r\nme.  And, Miles, a promise is a promise, and I do not think I ought\r\nto dance or play at cards.  It is not that I think them wrong for\r\nothers, but I cannot break my word.  Except those--I will do\r\nwhatever is fitting for your wife."\r\n\r\n"Spoken like a heroine!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I could ever give a tone.  Rosamond could, if she\r\ntried, but I have no readiness and no training; but I do see that\r\nthere is more good in being friendly like Jenny Bowater, than in\r\navoiding everything, and as long as one does it because it is right\r\nand loving, it can\'t be the world or worldliness."\r\n\r\nIt was not lucidly expressed, but it satisfied the Captain.\r\n\r\n"All right, my bonnie Nance, I\'ll promise on my side never to ask\r\nyou to go against your real conscience, and if you must have a Pope,\r\nI had rather it were Pope Julius than Pope Pilgrim."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, Miles.  Popes are all wrong, and I don\'t know whether Mr.\r\nPilgrim would give the right hand of fellowship to Julius."\r\n\r\nMiles chuckled.  "You may think yourself lucky you have not to\r\nadjust that question, Madame Nan."\r\n\r\n"There\'s the quarter chiming, Frank will want his beef-tea."\r\n\r\nPresently after Miles laid his hand on his mother\'s shoulder, and\r\nsaid, "Mother, here\'s a daughter who thinks you want to turn us out\r\nbecause she is too slow and stupid for your home child."  And he\r\ndrew Anne up blushing as if she were his freshly-won bride.\r\n\r\n"My dear, are you sure you don\'t want to go away from the old woman?\r\nShould you not be happier with him all to yourself?"\r\n\r\n"I could not be happy if you were left," said Anne.  "May I go on as\r\nwe did last winter?  I will try to do better now I have him to help\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"My own dear child!"\r\n\r\nThat was the way Anne forgot her own people and her father\'s house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\nHerbert\'s Victory\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd of our scholars let us learn\r\nOur own forgotten lore.--KEBLE\r\n\r\n"Joan, Jenny, dearest old Joanie!"  It was eagerly spoken, though\r\nthe voice was strangely altered that came from behind the flowered\r\ncurtain of that big bed, while the fingers drew it back, and Rollo\r\nraised his black muzzle near at hand.  "Oh, Jenny! have you come to\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"My dear, dear, poor boy!"\r\n\r\n"No kissing--it\'s not safe," and he burrowed under the sheet.\r\n\r\n"As if I did not mean to do more for you than that!  Besides, it is\r\nnot catching."\r\n\r\n"So I said, till it caught me.  What a jolly cold hand!  You\'ve not\r\ncome in cold and hungry though?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, Rosamond forced me to sit down to a whole spread.  As\r\nif one could eat with a knot in one\'s throat."\r\n\r\n"Mind you do, Jenny--it was what did for me.  The Rector ordered me\r\nnever to go about unfed; but one could not always--and there was\r\nsomething I have to tell you that drove all the rest out--"\r\n\r\n"Dear Herbs!  Papa can\'t talk of what you have done without tears.\r\nHe longed to come, but we could not leave mamma without one of us,\r\nand he thought I could do the most for you.  I have a note for you."\r\n\r\n"Forgiving me?"\r\n\r\n"I should _think_ so.  It is in my bag--"\r\n\r\n"No, not this moment; I like to know it.  And mammy--poor mammy--"\r\n\r\n"She is as comforted as she can be that you have Cranky and me; and\r\nthen papa\'s being proud of you has cheered her--oh! so much."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad they can comfort themselves--"\r\n\r\n"But, Herbert, dear, you must be much better; I did not expect to\r\nsee you so well."\r\n\r\n"I am not so bad between whiles," said Herbert, wearily.  "And,\r\nwhile I can, I\'ve got something to tell you that will make it up to\r\nyou, and a great deal more."\r\n\r\n"Make it up?" said Jenny, looking with bewildered eyes at the dear\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I made Gadley consent.  The Rector has it in writing, and it\r\nwill do quite as well if I die.  O, Jenny, woman, think of my never\r\nknowing what you had gone through!"\r\n\r\n"Is it about Archie?" said Jenny, beginning to tremble.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  It will clear him."\r\n\r\n"I always knew he was clear."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but he can come back now all right.  Eh! what an ass I am!\r\nI\'ve begun at the wrong end.  He wasn\'t drowned--it was all a\r\nmistake; Miles saw him in Africa--Cranky, I say, come to her."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Master Herbert, you\'ve been talking a great deal too much for\r\nyour sister just off a journey.  You\'ll get the fever on again.\r\nMiss Joanna, you ought to know better than to let him run on; I\r\nsha\'n\'t be able to let you do nothing for him if this is the way."\r\n\r\n"Was it too sudden, Joan?" said Herbert, wistfully, as she bent to\r\nkiss his brow with trembling lips.  "I couldn\'t let any one tell you\r\nbut myself, while I could; but I don\'t seem able to go on.  Is the\r\nRector there, Cranky?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, waiting in the parlour."\r\n\r\n"Rector," and Julius hurried in at once, "take her and tell her.  I\r\ncan\'t do it after all."\r\n\r\n"Is he alive?" whispered Jenny, so much overcome that Julius had to\r\nhold her up for a moment as he led her into the other room.\r\n\r\n"Really!  She thinks me delirious," said Herbert, rather amused.\r\n"Tell her all, Rector."\r\n\r\n"Really, Joan," said Julius, putting her into the great chair, and\r\nholding her trembling hand.  "Miles has seen him, has had him in his\r\nship."\r\n\r\n"And you never told me!"\r\n\r\n"He made Miles promise not to tell."\r\n\r\n"But he told you!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, because it was Anne who gave the clue which led to his\r\ndiscovery; but when he found we all thought him dead, he laid Miles\r\nunder the strictest charge to say nothing.  He is on an ostrich farm\r\nin Natal, Jenny, well, and all that he ever was, and more too.  He\r\ntook your photograph from Miles\'s book."\r\n\r\n"And I never knew," moaned Jenny, quite overcome.\r\n\r\n"He would not be persuaded that it was not more for your peace not\r\nto know of his life, and when Miles was put on honour, what could we\r\ndo?  But now it is all changed.  Since Herbert\'s discovery he need\r\nnot be a banished man any more."  And Julius told Jenny the manner\r\nof the discovery.  She listened, evidently gathering all in, and\r\nthen she asked:  "And what have you done?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing as yet."\r\n\r\n"Nothing! while there is this blot on Archie\'s name, and he is\r\nliving in exile, and that Moy is revelling in prosperity.  Nothing!\r\nWhy don\'t you publish it to every one?"\r\n\r\n"My dear Jenny, I have only known it a week, and I have not been\r\nable to find out where Mr. Moy is."\r\n\r\n"What, to have him taken up?"\r\n\r\n"Taken up, no; I don\'t imagine he could be prosecuted after this\r\nlength of time and on this kind of evidence.  No, to give him\r\nwarning."\r\n\r\n"Warning?  To flee away, and never clear Archie!  What are you\r\nabout, Julius?  He ought to be exposed at once, if he cannot be made\r\nto suffer otherwise."\r\n\r\n"Nay, Jenny, that would be hard measure."\r\n\r\n"Hard measure!" she interrupted; "what has my innocent Archie had?"\r\n\r\n"Think of the old man, his wife and daughter, Jenny."\r\n\r\n"She\'s a Proudfoot.--And that girl the scandal of the country!  You\r\nwant to sacrifice Archie to them, Julius?"\r\n\r\n"You are tired and shaken, Jenny, or you would see that all I want\r\nto do is to act with common consideration and honour."\r\n\r\nShe interrupted again.  "What honour do you mean?  You are not\r\nmaking it a secret of the confessional?"\r\n\r\n"You are misunderstanding me, Joanna," Julius gently said.\r\n"Herbert\'s vigil spared me from that difficulty, but--"\r\n\r\n"Then you would have sacrificed Archie to this imaginary--"\r\n\r\n"Hush, Jenny!  I fear he is wandering again.  Alas! it is the sad\r\nold refrain!"\r\n\r\nAs they came to the door together, Herbert\'s voice, under that\r\nstrange change which wandering brings, was heard muttering, "Give an\r\naccount of thy stewardship, for thou mayest be no longer steward."\r\nAnd Mrs. Cranstoun received them, with her head shaking, and tearful\r\neyes.  "It has come on again, sir; I was afraid it would be too much\r\nfor him."\r\n\r\nHerbert\'s prayer had been granted, inasmuch as the horrible ravings\r\nthat he feared repeating never passed his lips.  If he had gone down\r\nto the smoke of Tartarus to restore his sister\'s lover, none of its\r\nblacks were cleaning to him; but whether conscious or wandering, the\r\none thought of his wasted year seemed to be crushing him.  It was a\r\ncurious contrast between poor Mr. Fuller\'s absence of regret for a\r\nquarter of a century\'s supineness, and this lad\'s repentance for\r\ntwelve months\' idleness.  That his follies had been guileless in\r\nthemselves might be the very cause that his spirit had such power of\r\nrepentance.  His admiration of Lady Tyrrell had been burnt out, and\r\nhad been fancy, not heart, and no word of it passed his lips, far\r\nless of the mirth with the Strangeways.  Habit sometimes brought the\r\nphrases of the cricket-field, but these generally ended in a shudder\r\nof self-recollection and prayer.\r\n\r\nThe delirium only came with the accesses of fever, and when\r\nsensible, he was very quiet and patient, but always as one weighed\r\ndown by sense of failure in a trust.  He never seemed to entertain a\r\nhope of surviving.  He had watched too many cases not to be aware\r\nthat his symptoms were those that had been almost uniformly fatal,\r\nand he noted them as a matter of course.  Dr. Easterby came to see\r\nhim, and was greatly touched; Herbert was responsive, but it was not\r\nthe ordinary form of comfort that he needed, for his sorrow was\r\nneither terror nor despair.  His heart was too warm and loving not\r\nto believe that his heavenly Father forgave him as freely as did his\r\nearthly father; but that very hope made him the more grieved and\r\nashamed of his slurred task, nor did he view his six weeks at\r\nWil\'sbro\' as any atonement, knowing it was no outcome of repentance,\r\nbut of mere kindliness, and aware, as no one else could be, how his\r\npast negligence had hindered his full usefulness, so that he only\r\nsaw his failures.  As to his young life, he viewed it as a mortally\r\nwounded soldier does, as a mere casualty of the war, which he was\r\npledged to disregard.  He _did_ perhaps like to think that the fatal\r\nnight with Gadley might bring Archie back, and yet Jenny did not\r\ngive him the full peace in her happiness which he had promised\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nJoanna had suffered terribly, far more than any one knew, and her\r\nmind did not take the revulsion as might have been expected.  Her\r\nlighthouse was shining again when she thought it extinguished for\r\never, but her spirits could not bear the uncertainty of the spark.\r\nShe could not enter into what Miles and Julius both alike told her,\r\nof the impossibility of their mother beginning a prosecution for\r\nmoney embezzled ten years back, when no living witness existed,\r\nnothing but the scrap of paper written by Herbert, and signed by him\r\nand Margaret Strangeways, authorizing Julius Charnock to use what\r\nhad been said by the dying, half-delirious man.  What would a jury\r\nsay to such evidence?  And when Julius said it only freed himself\r\nmorally from the secrecy, poor Jenny was bitter against his\r\nscruples, even though he had never said more than that he should\r\nhave been perplexed.  The most bitter anti-ritualist could hardly\r\nhave uttered stronger things than she thought, and sometimes said,\r\nagainst what seemed to her to be keeping Archie in banishment; while\r\nthe brothers\' reluctance to expose Mr. Moy, and blast his reputation\r\nand that of his family, was in her present frame of mind an\r\nincomprehensible weakness.  People must bear the penalty of their\r\nmisdeeds, families and all, and Mrs. and Miss Moy did not deserve\r\nconsideration:  the pretensions of the mother had always been half\r\nscorn, half thorn, to the old county families, and the fast airs of\r\nthe daughter had been offensive enough to destroy all pity for her.\r\nIf an action in a Court of Justice were, as Miles and Julius told\r\nher, impossible,--and she would not believe it, except on the word\r\nof a lawyer,--public exposure was the only alternative for righting\r\nArchie, and she could not, or would not, understand that they would\r\nhave undergone an action for libel rather than not do their best to\r\nclear their cousin, but that they thought it due to Mr. Moy to give\r\nhim the opportunity of doing the thing himself; she thought it\r\nfolly, and only giving him time and chance for baffling them.\r\n\r\nThe strange thing was, that not only when she argued with the two\r\nbrothers, but when she brooded and gave way to these thoughts as she\r\nkept her watch, it probably made her less calm--for an access of\r\nrestlessness and fever never failed to come on--with Herbert.\r\nProbably she was less calm externally, and the fret of face and\r\nmanner communicated itself to him, for the consequences were so\r\ninvariable that Cranstoun thought they proved additionally what she\r\nof course believed, that Miss Joan could not be trusted with her\r\nbrother.  At last Jenny, in her distress and unwillingness to\r\nabandon Herbert to Cranky\'s closed windows, traced cause and effect,\r\nand made a strong resolution to banish the all-pervading thought,\r\nand indeed his ever-increasing weakness and danger filled her mind\r\nso as to make this easier and easier, so that she might no longer\r\nhave to confess to herself that Rollo was a safer companion, since\r\nHerbert, with a hand on that black head, certainly only derived\r\nsoothing influences from those longing sympathetic eyes.  And he\r\ncould not but like the testimony of strong affection that came to\r\nhim.  The whole parish was in consternation, and inquiries, and very\r\nodd gifts, which he was supposed to \'fancy,\' came from all over\r\nCompton as well as from Strawyers, and were continually showering\r\nupon his nurses, so that Mrs. Hornblower and Dilemma spent their\r\nlives in mournful replies over the counter, and fifty times a day he\r\nwas pronounced to be \'as bad as he could be to be alive.\'  Old\r\nservants and keepers made progresses from Strawyers, to see Master\r\nHerbert, and were terribly aggrieved because Miss Bowater kept them\r\nout of his room, as much for their sake as his; and Mrs. Cranstoun\r\npointed to the open lattice which she believed to be killing him, as\r\nsurely as it gave aches to her rheumatic shoulder.\r\n\r\nJulius thought almost as much as Jenny could do of the means of\r\nrecalling Archie; but it was necessary to wait until he could\r\ncommunicate with Mr. Moy, and his hands were still over-full, for\r\nthough much less fatal, the fever smouldered on, both in Wil\'sbro\'\r\nand Compton, and as St. Nicholas was a college living which had\r\nhitherto been viewed as a trump card, it might be a long time going\r\nthe round of the senior fellows.\r\n\r\nJulius had just been at poor Mrs. Fuller\'s, trying to help her to\r\nput her complicated affairs in order, so as to be ready for a move\r\nas soon as one daughter, who had the fever slightly, could be taken\r\naway, and he was driving home again, when he overtook Mrs. Duncombe\r\nand offered her a lift, for her step was weary.  She was indeed\r\naltered, pale, with cheek-bones showing, and all the lustre and\r\nsparkle gone out of her, while her hat was as rigidly dowdy as Miss\r\nSlater\'s.\r\n\r\nShe roused herself to ask feebly after the remaining patients.\r\n\r\n"Cecil is really getting better at last," he said.  "Her father\r\nwants to take her to Portishead next week."\r\n\r\n"And young Bowater?"\r\n\r\n"No change.  His strength seems to be going."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t pity him," sighed Bessie Duncombe; "he has only seen the\r\nbest end of life, and has laid it down for something worth!  I\'m\r\nsure he and your brother are the enviable ones."\r\n\r\n"Nay, Mrs. Duncombe, you have much to work for and love in this\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"And I must go away from everything just as I had learnt to value\r\nit.  Bob has taken a house at Monaco, and writes to me to bring the\r\nchildren to join him there!"\r\n\r\n"At Monaco?"\r\n\r\n"At Monaco!  Yes, and I know that it is all my own fault.  I might\r\nhave done anything with him if I had known how.  But what could you\r\nexpect?  I never saw my mother; I never knew a home; I was bred up\r\nat a French school, where if one was not a Roman Catholic there was\r\nnot a shred of religion going.  I married after my first ball.\r\nNobody taught me anything; but I could not help having brains, so I\r\nread and caught the tone of the day, and made my own line, while he\r\nwent on his."\r\n\r\n"And now there is a greater work for you to do, since you have\r\nlearnt to do it."\r\n\r\n"Ah! learnt too late.  When habits are confirmed, and home station\r\nforfeited--What is there left for him or my poor boys to do?"\r\n\r\n"A colony perhaps--"\r\n\r\n"Damaged goods," she said, smiling sadly.\r\n\r\n"Then are you going?"\r\n\r\n"As soon as I have seen this fever out, and can dispose of the\r\nthings here.  I have just been to Moy\'s office to see about getting\r\nrid of the lease."\r\n\r\n"Is Mr. Moy come home?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Have you not heard?"\r\n\r\n"What?--Not the fever?"\r\n\r\n"No.  Worse I should say.  Gussie has gone off and got married to\r\nHarry Simmonds."\r\n\r\n"The man at the training stables?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  They put up their banns at the Union at Brighton, and were\r\nmarried by the Registrar, then went off to Paris.  They say it will\r\nkill her mother.  The man is a scoundrel, who played Bob false, and\r\nwon largely by that mare.  And the girl has had the cheek to write\r\nto me," said Mrs. Duncombe, warming into her old phraseology--"to\r\n_me_!--to thank me for opportunities of meeting, and to tell me she\r\nhas followed up the teaching of last year."\r\n\r\n"What--the rights of women?"\r\n\r\n"Ay.  This is a civil marriage--not mocking her with antiquated\r\nservile vows," she says.  "Ah, well, it was my doing, I suppose.\r\nClio Tallboys held forth in private, I believe, to poor Gussie, on\r\ntheories that were mere talk in her, but which this poor girl has\r\ntaken in earnest."\r\n\r\n"Very sad earnest she may find it, I fear.  Can I do anything for\r\nyou?" as they reached the gate of Aucuba Villa.\r\n\r\n"No, thank you, unless to get the house off my hands."\r\n\r\n"You are alone.  Will you not come and spend the evening with us?"\r\n\r\n"That is very kind, but I have too much to do, and besides, Sister\r\nMargaret is coming to spend the night with me."\r\n\r\n"I am glad to hear it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Charnock, I trust I have learnt something in this spell of\r\nwork.  I\'ve not been for nothing in such scenes with those Sisters\r\nand young Bowater.  I\'m more ignorant than half the poor things that\r\nI\'ve heard talk of their faith and hope; but I see it is not the\r\ndecorous humbug it once looked like.  And now that I would have\r\nlearnt, here I go to Monaco."\r\n\r\n"You will learn.  You have a work before you that will teach you."\r\n\r\n"My boys are young enough to start with on a different tack," she\r\nsaid.  "You will tell me--no--I\'ll not hinder you now.  I shall see\r\nyou again."\r\n\r\nJulius was too anxious to get home to refuse to be released, much as\r\nhe felt for this brave woman.  The day before, Herbert had been\r\nfrightfully faint and exhausted by the morning\'s attack of fever,\r\nbut had been so still ever since that there was a shade of hope that\r\nthe recurrence might not take place; and this hope grew stronger,\r\nwhen Jenny came into the outer room to say that the usual time for\r\nthe fever was passing so quietly in a sort of sleep that Dr. Worth\r\nseemed to think rally possible, if only there was no fresh access.\r\n\r\nThey stood over the fire, and Julius asked, "Can\'t you lie on the\r\nsofa, Jenny?  I can stay."\r\n\r\n"No," said Jenny, restlessly.  "No, I can\'t.  I know you have\r\nsomething to tell me."\r\n\r\n"Moy has come home, Jenny.  He is in terrible trouble.  His daughter\r\nhas eloped with young Simmonds at the training stables."\r\n\r\n"The most appropriate end of her bringing up," said Jenny, in the\r\nhard tone it was so difficult to answer--it was so unlike herself--\r\nand her thought was that weak pity and forbearance would hinder\r\nexertions in Archie\'s cause.  "Generous at other folks\' expense,"\r\nsaid she to herself.  "Sparing the guilty and leaving the innocent\r\nto exile!"\r\n\r\nBut a moaning murmur, and Cranstoun\'s movement at once summoned them\r\nboth to the bedside.\r\n\r\nAlas! here was the attack that the doctor had evidently apprehended\r\nas likely to be fatal.  Hour after hour did sister, nurse, and\r\nfriend stand watching, and doing their best, their piteously little\r\nbest, while consciousness, if there was any, was far out of their\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nLate into the night it went on, and then followed the collapse, with\r\nlocked teeth, which could hardly be drawn asunder to put the\r\nstimulus hopelessly between them, and thus came the tardy December\r\ndawn, when the church-bell made Jenny bid Julius not stay, but only\r\nfirst read the commendatory prayer.\r\n\r\n"I thought there was a little more revival just now," he said; "his\r\nhands are warmer, and he really did swallow."\r\n\r\nThe old nurse shook her head.  "That\'s the way before they go," said\r\nshe.  "Don\'t ye wish him, poor lamb, it makes it the harder for\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nJulius prayed the prayer, and as he tenderly laid his hand on the\r\nbrow, he wondered whether he should find the half-closed eyes shut\r\nfor ever on his return.\r\n\r\nBut as he went, there was a quiver of lip and flicker of eyelid, the\r\nlightening, as Cranky called it, was evidently gaining ground.\r\nHerbert\'s faint whisper was heard again--"Jenny!"\r\n\r\n"Dearest!"\r\n\r\n"The Lord\'s Prayer!"\r\n\r\nShe began,--his fingers tightened on hers.  "Pray it for old Moy,"\r\nhe said; and as she paused, scarce hearing or understanding, "He--he\r\nwants it," gasped Herbert.  "No!  One can\'t pray it, without--"\r\nanother pause.  "Help me, Jenny.  Say it--O Lord, who savedst us--\r\nforgive us.  Help us to forgive from our hearts that man his\r\ntrespasses.  Amen."\r\n\r\nJenny said it.  Herbert\'s voice sank in the Amen.  He lay breathing\r\nin long gasps; but he thus breathed still when Julius came back, and\r\nJenny told him that a few words had passed, adding--\r\n\r\n"Julius, I will say nothing bitter again.  God help me not to think\r\nit."\r\n\r\nDid Herbert hear?  Was that the reason of the calm which made the\r\nwhite wasted face so beautiful, and the strange soft cool hush\r\nthroughout the room?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\nSilver Hair\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd how should I your true love know\r\nFrom another man?--Friar of Orders Gray\r\n\r\n"Please God, I can try again."\r\n\r\nThose were the words with which Herbert Bowater looked into his\r\nRector\'s face on awaking in the evening of that same December day\r\nfrom one of a series of sleeps, each sweeter and longer than the\r\nlast, and which had borne him over the dreaded hours, without fever,\r\nand with strengthening pulse.\r\n\r\nJulius had not ventured to leave the sick-room that whole day, and\r\nwhen at last he went home and sank into the chair opposite Terry,\r\nfor the first time through all these weeks of trouble and tension,\r\nhe burst into a flood of tears.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly made the startled lad understand that life, not death,\r\nhad thus overcome him, when the door flew open, and in rushed\r\nRosamond, crying, "Julius, Julius, come!  It is he or his ghost!"\r\n\r\n"Who?  What?"\r\n\r\n"It is your hair!  At Mrs. Douglas\'s grave!  He\'ll be gone!  Make\r\nhaste--make haste!"\r\n\r\nHe started up, letting her drag him along, but under protest.  "My\r\ndear, men _do_ come to have hair like mine."\r\n\r\n"I tell you it was at our graves--our own--I touched him.  I had\r\nthis wreath for Raymond, and there he was, with his hat off, at the\r\nrailing close to Mrs. Douglas\'s.  I thought his back was yours, and\r\ncalled your name, and he started, and I saw--he had a white beard,\r\nbut he was not old.  He just bowed, and then went off very fast by\r\nthe other gate, towards Wil\'sbro\'.  I did call, \'Wait, wait,\' but he\r\ndidn\'t seem to hear.  Oh, go, go, Julius!  Make haste!"\r\n\r\nInfected by the wild hope, Julius hurried on the road where his wife\r\nhad turned his face, almost deriding himself for obeying her, when\r\nhe would probably only overtake some old family retainer; but as,\r\nunder the arch of trees that overhung the road, he saw a figure in\r\nthe moonlight, a thrill of recognition came over him as he marked\r\nthe vigorous tread of the prime of life, and the white hair visible\r\nin the moonlight, together with something utterly indescribable, but\r\nwhich made him call out, "Archie!  Archie Douglas! wait for me!"\r\n\r\nThe figure turned.  "Julius!" came in response; the two cousins\'\r\nhands clasped, and there was a sob on either side as they kissed one\r\nanother as brothers.\r\n\r\n"Archie!  How could you!--Come back!" was all that Julius could say,\r\nleaning breathlessly against him and holding him tight.\r\n\r\n"No!  Do not know that I have been here.  I was sent to London on\r\nbusiness.  I could not help running home in the dark.  No one must\r\nknow it.  I am dead to them."\r\n\r\n"No, Archie, you are not.  Gadley has confessed and cleared you.\r\nCome home!"\r\n\r\n"Cleared me!"  The two arms were stretched up to the sky, and there\r\nwas the sound of a mighty sob, as though the whole man, body, soul,\r\nand spirit, were relieved from an unspeakable burthen.  "Say it\r\nagain, Julius!"\r\n\r\n"Gadley, on his death-bed, has confessed that Moy and Proudfoot took\r\nthat money, incited by Tom Vivian."\r\n\r\nArchie Douglas could not speak, but he turned his face towards\r\nCompton again, strode swiftly into the churchyard, and fell on his\r\nknees by his mother\'s grave.  When at last he rose, he pointed to\r\nthe new and as yet unmarked mound, and said, "Your mother\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no!  Raymond\'s!  We have had a terrible fever here--almost a\r\npestilence--and we are scarcely breathing after it."\r\n\r\n"Ah! some one in the train spoke of sickness at Wil\'sbro\', but I\r\nwould ask no questions, for I saw faces I knew, and I would lead to\r\nno recognition.  I could not stay away from getting one sight of the\r\nold place.  Miles made it all burn within me; but here\'s my return-\r\nticket for the mail-train."\r\n\r\n"Never mind return-tickets.  Come home with me."\r\n\r\n"I shall startle your mother."\r\n\r\n"I meant my home--the Rectory.  It was my wife who saw you in the\r\nchurchyard, and sent me after you.  She is watching for you."\r\n\r\nArchie, still bewildered, as if spell-bound by his ticket, muttered,\r\n"I thought I should have time to walk over and look at Strawyers."\r\n\r\n"Joanna is here."\r\n\r\n"Julius!  It is too much.  You are sure I am awake?  This is not the\r\nold dream!" cried the exile, grasping his cousin\'s arm quite\r\ngainfully.\r\n\r\n"I am a waking man, and I trust you are," said Julius.  "Come into\r\nthe light.  No, that is not Jenny on the step.  It is my Rose.  Yes,\r\nhere he is!"\r\n\r\nAnd as they came into the stream of light from the porch, Irish\r\nRosamond, forgetting that Archie was not a brother, caught him by\r\nboth hands, and kissed him in overpowering welcome, exclaiming, "Oh,\r\nI am so glad!  Come in--come in!"\r\n\r\nThere he stood, blinking in the lamplight, a tall, powerful, broad-\r\nchested figure, but hardly a hero of romance to suit Terry\'s fancy,\r\nafter a rapid summary of the history from Rosamond.  His hair and\r\nbeard were as white as Julius\'s, and the whole face was tanned to\r\nuniform red, but no one could mistake the dazed yet intense gladness\r\nof the look.  He sank into a chair, clasped his hands over his face\r\nfor a moment, then surveyed them all one by one, and said, "You told\r\nme she was here."\r\n\r\n"She is with her brother Herbert, at Mrs. Hornblower\'s lodgings.\r\nNo, you must wait, Archie; he has barely in the last few hours, by\r\nGod\'s great mercy, taken a turn for the better in this fever, and I\r\ndon\'t see how she can leave him."\r\n\r\n"But she must hear it," cried Rosamond.  "I\'m going to make her or\r\nCranky get some rest; but you ought to be the one to tell her,\r\nJulius, you that have stood by her through all."\r\n\r\n"And aren\'t you burning to do so, Rosey, woman? and I think you had\r\nbetter, rather than that I should startle Herbert by returning; but\r\nstay, mind your own rules--eat and drink before you go, and give the\r\nsame to Archie.  I shall send up a note to Miles.  How is Cecil?"\r\n\r\n"Very silent and broken, poor thing.  She is to see your mother to-\r\nmorrow.  How well it was that she kept me so late over her wreath of\r\ncamellias!"\r\n\r\nArchie submitted to wait for food and fuller information,--indeed\r\nthe lady of the house manifested more impatience than he did, as she\r\nflitted about making preparations, and he sat with hands locked\r\ntogether over his knee, gazing fixedly at Julius, scarcely speaking,\r\nthough eagerly listening; and when the meal was brought in, he could\r\nnot eat, only eagerly drank off a cup of scalding tea, and watched\r\nRosamond, as if jealous of any delay over her cutlet.  She did not\r\nabuse his patience.\r\n\r\n"Now then?" she said, rising.  "You shall hear something of her\r\nbefore long."\r\n\r\n"Let me come to her door," entreated Archie.\r\n\r\nAnd as the light shone from the window of the sick-room, Rosamond\r\nsaid, "Stand under that tree in the moonlight, and I will make her\r\nlook out."\r\n\r\nAll was intensely quiet; Cranky fast asleep in the arm-chair in the\r\nouter-room, and Jenny sitting by the bed, watching the smooth quiet\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n"You are to lie down on the sofa and sleep," said Rosamond, kissing\r\nher, and she shook her head, "You must.  People want strength for\r\njoy as well as grief.  Trust him to me, for there is some one for\r\nyou to see to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Not papa!" said Jenny, startled.  "No, nor Phil!  Tell me,\r\nRosamond.  There is only one you could look at me like that for!"\r\n\r\n"Look out at the window."\r\n\r\nTrembling all over, Jenny went and put her face to the lattice.  The\r\nfigure under the tree came nearer.  Archie must have been able\r\nclearly to see her face in the moonlight.  He stretched up his arms\r\nto her, then folded them together on his breast, and let himself be\r\nled away by Julius, while Jenny slid down on her knees, with her\r\nface buried, and the suppressed choking sobs made Herbert look up at\r\nRosamond, and whisper, "It is?"\r\n\r\n"It is," repeated Rosamond, who had thought him asleep, or entirely\r\nabsorbed in the trouble of living.\r\n\r\n"Go to her," he added.\r\n\r\nRosamond put her arm round her, and supported her into the next\r\nroom; for, after the month of hopeless watching, the long\r\nsleeplessness and the struggle of this silent day to force her\r\nspirit to the forgiveness she had promised, and then the sudden\r\nreaction, had overpowered her, and the suppression and silence were\r\nbeyond endurance.  She did not even know that Herbert was awake when\r\nRosamond brought her out into Mrs. Hornblower\'s room, and said,\r\n"Have it out now, my dear, no one will hear.  Scream comfortably.\r\nIt will do you good."\r\n\r\nBut Jenny could not even scream.  She was in the excited agony when\r\nthe mind is far too much for the body, and joy, unrealized, is like\r\ngrief.  If her brother had that day passed away, and if nothing had\r\nbeen heard of her lover, she would have been all calmness and\r\nresignation; but the revulsion had overcome her, and at the moment\r\nshe was more conscious of strangulation than of anything else.\r\nRosamond tended her for full half an hour, and then she seemed\r\nalmost asleep, though she resisted the attempt to undress her, with\r\nthe words, "I must go to Herbert."\r\n\r\n"I will take care of Herbert," and Jenny was too much spent not to\r\nacquiesce, and fell asleep almost before she was laid down on the\r\nbed their landlady had given up to the watchers.\r\n\r\nRosamond\'s task was a comfortable one, for every hour of sleep,\r\nevery mouthful of food seemed to do its work of restoration on the\r\nsound, healthy frame, and a smile and word of thanks met her\r\nwhenever she roused her patient with the inevitable spoon.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke towards morning, he asked what day it was, and when\r\nshe told him, answered, "So I thought.  Then I have not lost count\r\nof time."\r\n\r\n"No, you have been wonderfully clear-headed."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t see how there can have been time to write," he said.  "It\r\nis true that he is come, is it not?"\r\n\r\n"Quite true; but he came independently on business," and Rosamond\r\ntold of Julius\'s chase, bringing a look of amusement on his face.\r\n\r\nJenny came in with the rising sun, pale indeed, but another creature\r\nafter her rest and in the sight of the restful countenance that\r\ngreeted her with a smile.  The moaning, hoarse voice was gone too,\r\nit was a faint shadow of Herbert\'s own tones that said, "Is not this\r\ngood, Jenny?  I didn\'t think to have seen it."\r\n\r\n"My Herbert, you have given him back!  You have given me the heart\r\nto be glad!"\r\n\r\n"You must go and see him," said Herbert.\r\n\r\nJenny looked wistful and undecided; but Julius entered to say that\r\nshe must come at once, for Archie must go back to London by the ten\r\no\'clock train to an appointment, and could not return for two days.\r\n\r\nHerbert smiled her away, for he was still in a state where it was\r\nnot possible to bear any engrossing of his head-nurse, and the\r\nlover\'s absence was, even to his unselfishness, good news.\r\n\r\nRosamond could not refrain from the pleasure of peeping down the\r\nlittle dark stair as Archie and his Jenny met in the doorway, and\r\nshe walked demurely in their rear, wondering whether other eyes saw\r\nas much as she did in the manner in which Jenny hung on his arm.\r\nShe left them to their dewy walk in the Rectory garden to the last\r\nminute at which breakfast could be swallowed, and told Jenny that\r\nshe was to drive him in the pony-carriage to Hazlett\'s Gate; she\r\nwould take care of Herbert.\r\n\r\n"You ought to be asleep, you know," said Jenny.\r\n\r\n"My dear, I couldn\'t sleep!  There\'s a great deal better than sleep!\r\nIs not Herbert going to get well? and aren\'t you jolly again and\r\nArchie back again?  Sleep!--why I want to have wings and clap them--\r\nand more than all, is not Mr. Charnock off and away to-morrow?\r\nSleep indeed!--I should like to see myself so stupid."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Charnock?" interrogatively said Archie.\r\n\r\n"The head of the family--the original Charnock of Dunstone," said\r\nRosamond, who was in wild spirits, coming on a worn-out body and\r\nmind, and therefore perfectly unguarded.  "Don\'t shake your head at\r\nme, Jenny, Archie is one of the family, and that makes you so, and I\r\nmust tell you of his last performance.  You know he is absolutely\r\ncertain that his dear daughter is more infallible than all the\r\nPopes, even since the Council, or than anybody but himself, and that\r\nwhatever goes wrong here is the consequence of Julius\'s faith in Dr.\r\nEasterby.  So, when poor Cecil, uneasy in her mind, began asking\r\nabout the illness at Wil\'sbro\', he enlivened her with a prose about\r\nmisjudging, through well-intentioned efforts of clerical\r\nphilanthropy to interfere with the sanitary condition of the town--\r\nso that wells grew tainted, &c., all from ignorant interference.\r\nPoor man he heard a little sob, and looked round, and there was\r\nCecil in a dead faint.  He set all the bells ringing, and sent an\r\nexpress for me."\r\n\r\n"But wasn\'t he furious with Anne for mentioning drains at all?"\r\n\r\n"My dear Joan, don\'t you know how many old women there are of both\r\nsorts, who won\'t let other people look over the wall at what they\r\ngloat on in private?  However, he had his punishment, for he really\r\nthought that the subject had been too much for her delicacy, and\r\nsimply upset her nerves."\r\n\r\n"When was this?"\r\n\r\n"Four or five days ago.  She is better, but has said not a word more\r\nabout it.  She is nothing like strong enough, even for so short a\r\njourney as to Portishead; but they say change will be the best thing\r\nfor her, and the coming down into the family would be too sad."\r\n\r\n"Poor thing!  Yes indeed," said Jenny; and feeling universally\r\nbenevolent, she added, "give her my love," a thing which so sincere\r\na person could hardly have said a few weeks ago.\r\n\r\nReserve was part of Cecil\'s nature, and besides, her father was\r\nalmost always with her; but when she had been for the first time\r\ndressed in crape up to her waist, with the tiniest of caps perched\r\ntoy-like on the top of her passive head, the sight upset him\r\ncompletely, and muttering, "Good heavens!--a widow at twenty-two!"\r\nhe hid himself from the sight over some business transactions with\r\nMrs. Poynsett and Miles.\r\n\r\nRosamond seized the opportunity of bringing Julius in to pay his\r\nfarewell visit, and presently Cecil said, "Julius, I should be much\r\nobliged if you would tell me the real facts about this illness."\r\n\r\n"Do," said Rosamond.  "Her half knowledge is most wearing."\r\n\r\nHe gently told her what science had pronounced.\r\n\r\n"Then it was Pettitt\'s well?" she said.\r\n\r\n"They tell us that this was the immediate cause of the outbreak; but\r\nthere would probably have been quite as much fatal illness the first\r\ntime any infectious disease came in.  The whole place was in a\r\nshameful state, and you were the only people who tried to mitigate\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"And did worse harm, because we would not listen to advice," said\r\nCecil.  "Julius, I have a great deal of money; can\'t I do anything\r\nnow?  My father wants me to give a donation to the church as a\r\nmemorial of _him_, but, somehow, I don\'t feel as if I deserved to do\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"I see what you mean, Cecil, but the town is being rated to set the\r\ndrainage to rights, and it will thus be done in the most permanent\r\nand effectual way.  There are some orphans who might be saved from\r\nthe Union, about whom I thought of asking you to help."\r\n\r\nCecil asked the details of the orphans, and the consultation over\r\nthem seemed to be prolonged by her because, even now, she could not\r\nresolve to go below the surface.  It lasted until her father came to\r\nask whether she were ready to go with him to Mrs. Poynsett\'s\r\nsitting-room.  She looked very fragile and childish as she stood up,\r\nclinging to his arm to help her wavering, uncertain step, holding\r\nout her hand to Julius and saying, "I shall see you again."\r\n\r\nHe was a little disappointed to see her no older, and no warmer;\r\nhaving gone thus far, it seemed as if she might have gone further\r\nand opened more.  Perhaps he did not understand how feelings,\r\nnaturally slow, were rendered slower by the languor of illness,\r\nwhich made them more oppressive than acute.  As Mr. Charnock and his\r\ndaughter knocked, the door was opened by Miles, who merely gave his\r\nhand, and went down.  Frank, who had been reading in a low easy-\r\nchair by the fire, drew it close to his mother for her, and\r\nretreated to another seat, and the mother and daughter-in-law\r\nexchanged a grave kiss.  Cecil attempted some civility about the\r\nchair, to which poor Frank replied, "I\'m afraid it is of no use to\r\nspeak to me, Cecil, Miles can only just make me hear."\r\n\r\nRegret for his misfortune, and inquiry as to the chance of\r\nrestoration, were a possible topic.  Mr. Charnock gave much advice\r\nabout aurists, and examples of their success or non-success; and\r\nthence he diverged to the invalid-carriage he had secured, and his\r\nfuture plans for expediting his daughter\'s recovery.  Meanwhile Mrs.\r\nPoynsett and Cecil sat grave, dry-eyed, and constrained, each\r\nfeeling that in Mr. Charnock\'s presence the interview was a nullity,\r\nyet neither of them able to get rid of him, nor quite sure that she\r\nwould have done so if she could.\r\n\r\nHe, meanwhile, perfectly satisfied with his own considerate tact,\r\ntalked away the allotted half-hour, and then pronounced his daughter\r\npale and tired.  She let him help her to rise, but held Mrs.\r\nPoynsett\'s hand wistfully, as if she wished to say something but\r\ncould not; and all Mrs. Poynsett could bring out was a hope of\r\nhearing how she bore the journey.  It was as if they were both\r\nfrozen up.  Yet the next moment Cecil was holding Frank\'s hand in a\r\nconvulsive clasp, and fairly pulling him down to exchange a kiss,\r\nwhen he found her tears upon his cheek.  Were they to his\r\nmisfortune, or to his much-increased resemblance to his brother?\r\n\r\nMr. Charnock kept guard over her, so that her other farewells were\r\nalmost as much restrained as these, and though she hung on\r\nRosamond\'s neck, and seemed ready to burst forth with some fervent\r\nexclamation, he hovered by, saying, "My dear child, don\'t, don\'t\r\ngive way to agitation.  It does you honour, but it cannot be\r\npermitted at such a moment.  Lady Rosamond, I appeal to your\r\nunfailing good sense to restrain her emotion."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t any good sense, and I think it only hurts her to restrain\r\nher emotion," said Rosamond, with one of her little stamps, pressing\r\nCecil in her arms.  "There, there, my dear, cry,--never mind, if it\r\nwill comfort your poor heart."\r\n\r\n"Lady Rosamond!  This is--Cecil, my dear child!  Your resolution--\r\nyour resignation.  And the boxes are packed, and we shall be late\r\nfor the train!"\r\n\r\nMr. Charnock was a little jealous of Lady Rosamond as a comforter\r\npreferred to himself, and he spoke in a tone which Cecil had never\r\nresisted.  She withdrew herself from Rosamond, still tearless,\r\nthough her chest heaved as if there were a great spasm in it; she\r\ngave her hand to Miles, and let him lead her to the carriage; and so\r\nRaymond\'s widowed bride left Compton Poynsett enfolded in that\r\nstrange silence which some called sullenness and pride; others, more\r\nmerciful, stunned grief.\r\n\r\nPoor Cecil! there was less pity to be spared to her because of the\r\nintense relief it was to be free from her father, and to be able to\r\nstand in a knot consulting on the steps, without his coming out to\r\nfind out what they were talking about, and to favour them with some\r\nDunstone counsel.\r\n\r\nThe consultation was about Mr. Moy.  It was determined that since\r\nArchie was in England, it would be better not to wait till Herbert\r\nwas recovered, but that Miles and Julius should go together at once\r\nto see what effect they could produce on him.\r\n\r\nThey drove together to his office.  He was a tall man, a few years\r\nover forty, and had hitherto been portly and well-preserved, with a\r\ncertain serene air of complacent prosperity about him, that had\r\nalways been an irritation to the county families, with whom he tried\r\nto assert an equality; but as he rose to greet the brothers, there\r\nwas a bent and shrunken look about him:  the hair on his temples had\r\nvisibly whitened, his cheeks seemed to have sunk in, and there were\r\ndeep furrows on them.  Altogether he had grown full twenty years\r\nolder in appearance since he had stood proposing a popular toast at\r\nthe dinner at the town-hall.  There was something nervous and\r\nstartled in his gray eye, as he saw them enter, though he tried to\r\nassume his usual half-bland, half-easy, manner.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Captain Charnock Poynsett.  Good morning, Mr.\r\nCharnock, I hope I see you well?" the words faltering a little, as\r\nneither sailor nor clergyman took notice of his proffered hand; but\r\nhe continued his inquiries after the convalescents, though neither\r\ninquired in return after Mrs. Moy, feeling, perhaps, that they would\r\nrather not hear a very sad account of her state just before letting\r\ntheir inevitable Nemesis descend; also, not feeling inclined for\r\nreciprocal familiarity, and wanting to discourage the idea that\r\nMiles came for political purposes.\r\n\r\n"It has been a terrible visitation," said Moy, when he had been\r\nreduced to replying to himself.\r\n\r\n"It has," said Julius.  "Perhaps you have heard that your tenant,\r\nGadley, is dead?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did hear it.  A very melancholy thing--the whole family\r\nswept-away," said Mr. Moy, his eye again betraying some uneasiness,\r\nwhich Julius increased by saying--\r\n\r\n"We thought it right that you should hear that he made a disclosure\r\non his death-bed."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" Mr. Moy sat erect--the hard, keen, watchful lawyer.\r\n\r\n"A disclosure that nearly affects the character of Mr. Archibald\r\nDouglas," proceeded Julius.\r\n\r\n"May I ask what this may be?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Gadley then informed me that he had been in the outer room,\r\nbehind his desk, at the time when Mr. Douglas brought in the letter\r\nfrom my mother, containing the missing cheque, and that after\r\nDouglas was gone, he heard Mr. Vivian propose to those within to\r\nappropriate the amount to their own debts."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, Mr. Charnock, this is a very serious charge to bring on\r\nthe authority of a man in a raving fever.  Was any deposition taken\r\nbefore a magistrate?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Julius.  "Mr. Lipscombe was fetched, but he was unable to\r\nspeak at the time.  However, on reviving, he spoke as is thus\r\nattested," and he showed Herbert Bowater\'s slip of paper.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Charnock," said Mr. Moy, "without the slightest imputation on\r\nthe intentions of yourself or of young Mr. Bowater, I put it to\r\nyourself and Captain Charnock Poynsett, whether you could go before\r\na jury with no fuller attestation than you have in your hand.  We\r\nknow what Mr. Charnock and Mr. Bowater are.  To a jury they would\r\nsimply appear--pardon me--a young clergyman, his still more youthful\r\ncurate, and a sister of mercy, attaching importance to the words of\r\na delirious man; and juries have become very incredulous in such\r\ncases."\r\n\r\n"We shall see that," said Miles sharply.\r\n\r\n"The more cautious," added Mr. Moy, "when it is the raking up of a\r\nmatter eleven years old, where the witnesses are mostly dead, and\r\nwhere the characters of two gentlemen, also deceased, would be\r\nimplicated.  Believe me, sir, this firm--I speak as its present\r\nhead--will be rejoiced to make any compensation to Mrs. Poynsett for\r\nwhat went astray while coming to their hands.  It has been our\r\ndesire to do so from the very first, as letters of which I have\r\ncopies testify; but our advances were met in a spirit of enmity,\r\nwhich may perhaps be laid aside now."\r\n\r\n"No so-called compensation can be accepted, but the clearing of\r\nDouglas\'s character," said Miles.\r\n\r\n"It is a generous feeling," said Mr. Moy, speaking apparently most\r\ndispassionately, though Julius saw his hands trembling below the\r\ntable; "but even if the word of this delirious man were sufficient,\r\nhave you reflected, Captain Charnock Poynsett, on the unequal\r\nbenefit of justifying--allowing that you could justify--a young man\r\nwho has been dead and forgotten these eleven years, and has no\r\nrelation living nearer than yourself, at the expense of those also\r\ngone, but who have left relations who could ill bear to suffer from\r\nsuch a revelation?"\r\n\r\n"Justice is justice, whether a man be dead or alive," said Miles;\r\n"and Douglas is alive to demand his right."\r\n\r\n"Alive!" cried Mr. Moy, starting violently.  "Alive!  Archie Douglas\r\nalive!"\r\n\r\n"Alive, and in England," said Julius.  "He slept in my house the\r\nnight before last.  He never was in the Hippolyta, at all, but has\r\nbeen living in Africa all these years of exile."\r\n\r\nMr. Moy\'s self-command and readiness were all gone.  He sank back in\r\nhis chair, with his hands over his face.  The brothers looked at one\r\nanother, fearing he might have a stroke; but he revived in a moment,\r\nyet with a totally different expression on his countenance.  The\r\nkeen, defensive look was gone, there was only something piteously\r\nworn and supplicating in the face, as he said--\r\n\r\n"Then, gentlemen, I cannot resent anything you may do.  Believe me,\r\nbut for the assurance of his death, I should have acted very\r\ndifferently long ago.  I will assist you in any way you desire in\r\nreinstating Mr. Douglas in public opinion, only, if it be possible,\r\nlet my wife be spared.  She has recently had the heaviest possible\r\nblow; she can bear no more."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Moy, we will do nothing vindictive.  We can answer for my\r\nmother and Douglas," began Julius; but Miles, more sternly, would\r\nnot let his brother hold out his hand, and said--\r\n\r\n"You allow, then, the truth of Gadley\'s confession?"\r\n\r\n"What has he confessed?" said Moy, still too much the lawyer not to\r\nsee that his own complicity had never yet been stated.\r\n\r\nJulius laid before him his own written record of Gadley\'s words, not\r\nonly involving Moy in the original fraud, but showing how he had\r\nbribed the only witness to silence ever since.  The unhappy man read\r\nit over, and said--\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Charnock, it is all true.  I cannot battle it further.  I\r\nam at your mercy.  I would leave you to proclaim the whole to the\r\nworld; if it were not for my poor wife and her father, I would be\r\nglad to do so.  Heaven knows how this has hung upon me for years."\r\n\r\n"I can well believe it," said Julius, not to be hindered now from\r\ngrasping Mr. Moy\'s hand.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be a comfort now to tell the whole story in detail.\r\nMoy, the favoured and trusted articled clerk at first, then the\r\npartner, the lover and husband of the daughter, had been a model of\r\nsteadiness and success so early, that when some men\'s youthful\r\nfollies are wearing off, he had begun to weary of the monotony of\r\nthe office, and after beginning as Mentor to his young brother-in-\r\nlaw, George Proudfoot, had gradually been carried along by the\r\nfascination of Tom Vivian\'s society to share in the same perilous\r\npursuits, until both had incurred a debt to him far beyond their\r\npowers, while he was likewise so deeply involved, that no bonds of\r\nGeorge Proudfoot would avail him.\r\n\r\nThen came the temptation of Mrs. Poynsett\'s cheque, suggested,\r\nperhaps in jest, by Vivian, but growing on them as the feasibility\r\nof using it became clear.  It was so easy to make it appear to\r\nArchie Douglas that the letter was simply an inquiry for the lost\r\none.  Mr. Proudfoot, the father, was out of reach; Mrs. Poynsett\r\nwould continue to think the cheque lost in the post; and Tom Vivian\r\nundertook to get it presented for payment through persons who would\r\nguard against its being tracked.  The sum exceeded the debt, but he\r\nwould return the overplus to them, and they both cherished the hope\r\nof returning it with interest.  Indeed, it had been but a half\r\nconsent on the part of either, elicited only by the dire alternative\r\nof exposure; the envelope and letter were destroyed, and Vivian\r\ncarried off the cheque to some of the Jews with whom he had had only\r\ntoo many transactions, and they never met him again.\r\n\r\nMoy\'s part all along had been half cowardice, half ambition.  The\r\nsense of that act and of its consequences had gnawed at his heart\r\nthrough all his success; but to cast himself down from his position\r\nas partner and son-in-law of Mr. Proudfoot, the keen, clever,\r\ntrusted, confidential agent of half the families around--to let his\r\nwife know his shame and that of her brother, and to degrade his\r\ndaughter into the daughter of a felon--was more than he could bear;\r\nand he had gone on trying to drown the sense of that one lapse in\r\nthe prosperity of his career and his efforts to place his daughter\r\nin the first ranks of society.  No doubt the having done an injury\r\nto the Poynsett family had been the true secret of that enmity, more\r\nthan political, which he had always shown to Raymond; and after\r\nthinking Gadley safer out of that office, and having yielded to his\r\nsolicitations and set him up at the Three Pigeons, he had been\r\nalmost compelled to bid for popularity by using his position as a\r\nmagistrate to protect the blackguardism of the town.  He had been\r\nmeant for better things, and had been dragged on against his\r\nconscience and judgment by the exigencies of his unhappy secret; and\r\nwhen the daughter, for whose sake he had sacrificed his better self,\r\nhad only been led by her position into the follies and extravagances\r\nof the worst part of the society into which she had been introduced,\r\nand threw herself into the hands of a dissipated gambler, to whom\r\nher fortune made her a desirable prey--truly his sin had found him\r\nout.\r\n\r\nHis fight at first had been partly force of habit, but he was so\r\nentirely crushed that they could only have pity on him when he put\r\nhimself so entirely in their hands, only begging for forbearance to\r\nhis wife and her aged father, and entreating that principal,\r\ninterest, and compound interest might at once be tendered to Mrs.\r\nPoynsett.\r\n\r\nThe brothers could answer for nothing.  Archie must decide for\r\nhimself what he would accept as restoration of his character, and\r\nMrs. Poynsett could alone answer as to whether she would accept the\r\ncompensation.  But neither of them could be hard on one so stricken\r\nand sorrowful, and they did not expect hardness from their mother\r\nand cousin, especially so far as old Mr. Proudfoot and his daughter\r\nwere concerned.\r\n\r\nThat the confession was made, and that Archie should be cleared, was\r\nenough for Julius to carry to Herbert\'s room, while Miles repaired\r\nto his mother.  It was known in the sick-room where the brothers had\r\nbeen, and Julius was watched as he crossed the street by Jenny\'s\r\neager eye, and she met him at the door of the outer room with a face\r\nof welcome.\r\n\r\n"Come in and tell us all," she said.  "I see it is good news."\r\nHerbert was quite well enough to bear good news in full detail as he\r\nlay, not saying much, but smiling his welcome, and listening with\r\nears almost as eager as his sister\'s.  And as Julius told of the\r\ncrushed and broken man, Jenny\'s tears rose to her eyes, and she\r\npressed her brother\'s hand and whispered, "Thanks, dear boy!"\r\n\r\n"Small thanks to me."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I can enjoy it now," said Jenny; "thanks to you for forcing\r\nthe bitterness out of me."\r\n\r\n"Can you bear a little more good news, Herbert?" said Julius.  "Who\r\ndo you think is to have St. Nicholas?"\r\n\r\n"Not William Easterby?  That\'s too good to be true."\r\n\r\n"But so it is.  All the Senior Fellows dropped it like a red-hot\r\ncoal."\r\n\r\n"I thought Dwight wanted to marry?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but the lady\'s friends won\'t hear of his taking her there; so\r\nit has come down to young Easterby.  He can\'t be inducted of course\r\nyet; but he has written to say he will come down on Saturday and\r\ntake matters in hand."\r\n\r\n"The services on Sunday?  Oh!" said Herbert, with as great a gasp of\r\nrelief as if he had been responsible for them; and, indeed, Rosamond\r\ndeclared that both her husband and Mr. Bindon looked like new men\r\nsince Wil\'sbro\' was off their backs.  Archie was coming back that\r\nevening.  Jenny much longed to show her two treasures to each other,\r\nfor it was a useless risk for the healthy man, and the sick one was\r\ntoo weak and tired to wish for a new face, or the trouble of\r\nspeaking; nay, he could not easily bring himself to cheerful\r\nacquiescence in even his favourite Lady Rose taking his sister\'s\r\nplace to set her free for an evening with Archie at the Hall.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett was in the drawing-room.  She had taken courage to\r\nencounter the down-stair associations, saying she would make it no\r\nsadder for the dear boy than she could help, and so Miles had\r\ncarried her down to meet one who had been always as one of her own\r\nsons.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it was that she gathered him into her embrace, while the\r\ngreat strong man, only then fully realizing all the changes, sobbed\r\nuncontrollably beside her.\r\n\r\n"My boy, my poor Archie," she said, "you are come at last.  Did you\r\nnot know you still had a mother to trust to?"\r\n\r\n"I ought to have known it," said Archie, in a choked voice.  "Oh\r\nthat I had seen Jenny in London!"\r\n\r\nFor indeed it had become plain that it had been his flight that had\r\ngiven opportunity and substance to the accusation.  If he had\r\nremained, backed by the confidence of such a family as the\r\nPoynsetts, Gadley would have seen that testimony in his favour would\r\nbe the safer and more profitable speculation; and Moy himself, as he\r\nhad said, would have testified to the innocence of a living man on\r\nthe spot, though he had let the blame rest on one whom he thought in\r\nthe depths of the sea.  Archie\'s want of moral courage had been his\r\nruin.  It had led him to the scene of temptation rather than resist\r\nhis companions, and had thus given colour to the accusation, and in\r\nthe absence of both Joanna and of his cousins, it had prevented him\r\nfrom facing the danger.\r\n\r\nThis sense made him the more willing to be forbearing, when, after\r\ndinner, the whole council sat round to hear in full the history of\r\nthe interview with Mr. Moy; Anne taking up her position beside\r\nFrank, with whom, between her pencil and the finger-alphabet, she\r\nhad established such a language as to make her his best interpreter\r\nof whatever was passing in the room.\r\n\r\n"One could not help being sorry for Moy," said Miles, as he\r\nconcluded; "he turns out to be but half the villain after all, made\r\nso rather by acquiescence than by his own free will."\r\n\r\n"But reaping the profit," said Mrs. Poynsett.\r\n\r\n"Yes, though in ignorance of the injury he was doing, and thus\r\nclimbing to a height that makes his fall the worse.  I am sorry for\r\nold Proudfoot too," added Julius.  "I believe they have not ventured\r\nto tell him of his granddaughter\'s marriage."\r\n\r\n"I do not think the gain to me would be at all equal to the loss to\r\nthem," said Archie.  "Exposure would be ruin and heartbreak there,\r\nand I don\'t see what it would do for me."\r\n\r\n"My dear Archie!" exclaimed both Mrs. Poynsett and Joanna, in\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n"So long as you and Mr. Bowater are satisfied, I care for little\r\nelse," said Archie.\r\n\r\n"But your position, my dear," said Mrs. Poynsett.\r\n\r\n"We don\'t care much about a man\'s antecedents, within a few years,\r\nout in the colonies, dear Aunt Julia," said Archie, smiling.\r\n\r\n"You aren\'t going back?"\r\n\r\n"That depends," said Archie, his eyes seeking Joanna\'s; "but I don\'t\r\nsee what there is for me to do here.  I\'m spoilt for a solicitor\r\nanyway--"\r\n\r\n"We could find an agency, Miles, couldn\'t we?--or a farm--"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, dear aunt," said Archie; "I don\'t definitely answer,\r\nbecause Mr. Bowater must be consulted; but I have a business out\r\nthere that I can do, and where I can make a competence that I can\r\nfairly offer to Jenny here.  If I came home, as I am now, I should\r\nonly prey on you in some polite form, and I don\'t think Jenny would\r\nwish for that alternative.  I must go back any way, as I have told\r\nher, and whether to save for her, or to make a home for her there,\r\nit must be for her to decide."\r\n\r\nThey looked at Jenny.  She was evidently prepared; for though her\r\ncolour rose a little, her frank eyes looked at him with a confiding\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"But we must have justice done to you, my dear boy, whether you stay\r\nwith us or not," said Mrs. Poynsett.\r\n\r\n"That might have been done if I had not been fool enough to run\r\naway," said Archie; "having done so, the mass of people will only\r\nremember that there has been something against me, in spite of any\r\njustification.  It is not worth while to blast Moy\'s character, and\r\nshow poor old Proudfoot what a swindler his son was, just for that.\r\nThe old man was good to me.  I should like to let it rest while he\r\nlives.  If Moy would sign such an exculpation of me as could be\r\nshown to Mr. Bowater, and any other whom it might concern, I should\r\nbe quite willing to have nothing told publicly, at least as long as\r\nthe old gentleman lives."\r\n\r\n"I think Archie is right," said Miles, in the pause, with a great\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n"Yes, right in the highest sense of the word," said Julius.\r\n\r\n"It is Christian," Anne breathed across to her husband.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like it," said Mrs. Poynsett.\r\n\r\n"Let that scoundrel go unhung!" burst from Frank, who had failed to\r\ncatch the spirit of his interpreter.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like it in the abstract, mother," said Miles; "but you and\r\nFrank have not seen the scoundrel in his beaten down state, and, as\r\nArchie says, it is hard to blacken the memory of either poor George\r\nProudfoot or Tom Vivian, who have fathers to feel it for them."\r\n\r\n"Poor Tom Vivian\'s can hardly be made much blacker," said Mrs.\r\nPoynsett, "nor are Sir Harry\'s feelings very acute; but perhaps poor\r\nold Proudfoot ought to be spared, and there are considerations as to\r\nthe Vivian family.  Still, I don\'t see how to consent to Archie\r\ngoing into exile again with this stigma upon him.  I am sure Raymond\r\nwould not, and I do not think Mr. Bowater will."\r\n\r\n"Dear Aunt Julia," said Archie, affectionately, coming across to\r\nher, "it was indeed exile before, when I was dead to all of you; but\r\ncan it be so now the communication is open, and when I am making or\r\nwinning my home?" and his eyes brought Jenny to him by her side.\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear Mrs. Poynsett," she said, holding her hand, "I am sure he\r\nis right, and that it would spoil all our own happiness to break\r\nthat poor old father\'s heart, and bring him and his wife to disgrace\r\nand misery.  When I think of the change in everything since two days\r\nback--dear Herbert wrung a sort of forgiveness out of me--I can\'t\r\nbear to think of anybody being made miserable."\r\n\r\n"And what will your papa say, child?"\r\n\r\n"I think he will feel a good deal for old Proudfoot," said Jenny.\r\n"He rather likes the old man, and has laughed at our hatred of Miss\r\nMoy\'s pretensions."\r\n\r\n"Then it is settled," said Archie; "I will write to Moy, for I\r\nsuppose he had rather not see me, that I will say nothing about it\r\npublicly while Mr. Proudfoot lives, and will not show this\r\nconfession of his, unless it should be absolutely necessary to my\r\ncharacter.  Nor after old Proudfoot\'s death, will I take any step\r\nwithout notice to him."\r\n\r\n"Much more than he ought to expect," said Mrs. Poynsett.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Archie.  "If he had refused, it would not have\r\nbeen easy to bring him to the point, I suppose I must have\r\nsurrendered to take my trial, but after so many years, and with so\r\nmany deaths, it would have been awkward."\r\n\r\n"And the money, mother," said Miles, producing a cheque.  "Poor Moy,\r\nthat was a relief to him.  He said he had kept it ready for years."\r\nMrs. Poynsett waved it off as if she did not like to touch it.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want it!  Take it, Archie.  Set up housekeeping on it," she\r\nsaid.  "You are not really going back to that place?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed I am; I sail on Tuesday.  Dear good Aunt Julia, how\r\ncomfortable it is to feel any one caring for me again; but I am\r\nafraid even this magnificent present, were it ten times as much,\r\ncould not keep me; I must go back to fulfil my word to my partner\r\nout there, even if I returned at once."\r\n\r\n"And you let him go, Jenny?"\r\n\r\n"I must!" said Jenny.  "And only think how different it is now!  For\r\nthe rest, whether he comes back for me at once, or some years hence,\r\nmust depend on papa and mamma."\r\n\r\nShe spoke with grave content beaming in her eyes, just like herself.\r\nThe restoration was still swallowing up everything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\nHerbert\'s Christmas\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when the self-abhorring thrill\r\n   Is past--as pass it must,\r\nWhen tasks of life thy spirit fill,\r\nThen be the self-renouncing will\r\n   The seal of thy calm trust.--Lyra Apostolica\r\n\r\nBy Christmas Day Archie Douglas was in the Bay of Biscay; but even\r\nto Joanna it was not a sorrowful day, for did not Herbert on that\r\nday crawl back into his sitting-room, full dressed for the first\r\ntime, holding tight by her shoulder, and by every piece of furniture\r\non his way to the sofa, Rollo attending in almost pathetic delight,\r\ngazing at him from time to time, and thumping the floor with his\r\ntail?  He had various visitors after his arrival--the first being\r\nhis Rector, who came on his way back from church to give his\r\ncongratulations, mention the number of convalescents who had there\r\nappeared, and speak of the wedding he had celebrated that morning,\r\nthat of Fanny Reynolds and her Drake, who were going forth the next\r\nday to try whether they could accomplish a hawker\'s career free from\r\nwhat the man, at least, had only of late learnt to be sins.  It was\r\na great risk, but there had been a penitence about both that Julius\r\ntrusted was genuine.  A print of the Guardian Angel, which had been\r\nher boy\'s treasure, had been hung by Fanny in her odd little\r\nbedroom, and she had protested with tears that it would seem like\r\nher boy calling her back if she were tempted again.\r\n\r\n"Not that I trust much to that," said Julius.  "Poor Fanny is soft,\r\nand likes to produce an effect; but I believe there is sterling\r\nstuff in Drake."\r\n\r\n"And he never had a chance before," said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"No.  Which makes a great difference--all indeed between the\r\nPublicans, or the Heathens, and the Pharisees.  He can\'t read, and I\r\ndoubt whether he said the words rightly after me; but I am sure he\r\nmeant them."\r\n\r\n"I suppose all this has done great good?" said Jenny.\r\n\r\n"It will be our fault if it do not do permanent good.  It ought,"\r\nsaid Julius, gravely.  "No, no, Herbert, I did not mean to load you\r\nwith the thought.  Getting well is your business for the present--\r\nnot improving the occasion to others."\r\n\r\nTo which all that Herbert answered was, "Harry Hornblower!" as if\r\nthat name spoke volumes of oppression of mind.\r\n\r\nThat discussion, however, was hindered by Mrs. Hornblower\'s own\r\narrival with one of her lodger\'s numerous meals, and Julius went off\r\nto luncheon.  The next step on the stairs made Herbert start and\r\nexclaim, "That\'s the dragoon!  Come in, Phil."\r\n\r\nAnd there did indeed stand the eldest brother, who had obtained a\r\nfew days\' leave, as he told them, and had ridden over from Strawyers\r\nafter church.  He came in with elaborate caution in his great muddy\r\nboots, and looked at Herbert like a sort of natural curiosity,\r\nexclaiming that he only wanted a black cap and a pair of bands to be\r\nexactly like Bishop Bowater, a Caroline divine, with a meek, oval,\r\nspiritual face, and a great display of delicate attenuated fingers,\r\nthe length of which had always been a doubt and marvel to his sturdy\r\ndescendants.\r\n\r\n"Hands and all," quoth Philip; "and what are you doing with them?"\r\nas he spied a Greek Testament in the fingers, and something far too\r\nponderous for them within reach.  "Jenny, how dare you?" he\r\nremonstrated, poising the bigger book as if to heave it at her head.\r\n"That\'s what comes of your encouraging followers, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Jenny, pretending to dodge the missile, while Rollo\r\nexercised great forbearance in stifling a bark, "Greek is not quite\r\nso severe to some folks as dragoon captains think."\r\n\r\n"Severe or not he might let it alone," said Phil, looking much\r\ndisposed to wrest away the little book, which Herbert thrust under\r\nhis pillow, saying--\r\n\r\n"It was only the Lesson."\r\n\r\n"Why can\'t you read the Lesson like a sensible man in its native\r\nEnglish?  Don\'t laugh, children, you know what I mean.  There\'s no\r\ngood in this fellow working his brain.  He can\'t go up again before\r\nSeptember, and according to the Bishop\'s letter to my father, he is\r\nsafe to pass, if he could not construe a line, after what he did at\r\nWil\'sbro\'.  The Bishop and Co. found they had made considerable\r\ndonkeys of themselves.  Yes, \'tis the ticket for you to be shocked;\r\nbut it is just like badgering a fellow for his commission by asking\r\nhim how many facets go to a dragon-fly\'s eye, instead of how he can\r\nstand up to a battery."\r\n\r\n"So I thought," said Herbert; "but I know now what it is to be in\r\nthe teeth of the battery without having done my best to get my\r\nweapons about me."\r\n\r\n"Come now!  Would any of those poor creatures have been the better\r\nfor your knowing\r\n\r\n"How many notes a sackbut has,\r\nOr whether shawms have strings,"\r\n\r\nor the Greek particles, which I believe were what sacked you?"\r\n\r\n"They would have been the better if I had ever learnt to think what\r\nmen\'s souls are, or my own either," said Herbert, with a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\n"Ah! well, you have had a sharp campaign," said Phil; "but you\'ll\r\nsoon get the better of it when you are at Nice with the old folks.\r\nJolly place--lots of nice girls--something always going on.  I\'ll\r\ntry and get leave to take you out; but you\'ll cut us all out!\r\nLadies won\'t look at a fellow when there\'s an interesting young\r\nparson to the fore."\r\n\r\nHerbert made an action of negation, and his sister said--\r\n\r\n"The doctors say Nice will not do after such an illness as this.\r\nPapa asked the doctor there, and he said he could not advise it."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!  Then I\'ll tell you what, Herbs, you shall come into\r\nlodgings at York, and I\'ll look after you there.  You shall ride\r\nPimento, and dine at the mess."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Phil," said Herbert, to whom a few months ago this\r\nproposal would have been most seducing, "but I am going home, and\r\nthat\'s all the change I shall want."\r\n\r\n"Home!  Yes, Ellen is getting ready for you.  Not your room--oh, no!\r\nbut the state bedroom!  When will you come?  My leave is only till\r\nTuesday."\r\n\r\n"Oh!  I don\'t know how to think of the drive," sighed Herbert\r\nwearily.\r\n\r\n"We must wait for a fine day, when he feels strong enough," said\r\nJenny.\r\n\r\n"All right," said Phil; "but ten days or a fortnight there will be\r\nquite enough, and then you\'ll come.  There are some friends of\r\nyours, that only looked at me, I can tell you, for the sake of your\r\nname--eh, Master Herbs?"\r\n\r\nHerbert did not rise to the bait; but Jenny said, "The Miss\r\nStrangeways?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Wouldn\'t he be flattered to hear of the stunning excitement\r\nwhen they heard of Captain Bowater, and how the old lady, their\r\nmother, talked by the yard about him?  You\'ll get a welcome indeed\r\nwhen you come, old fellow.  When shall it be?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you, Phil," said Herbert, gravely.  "I shall come back\r\nhere as soon as I am well enough.  But there is one thing I wish you\r\nwould do for me."\r\n\r\n"Well, what?  I\'ll speak about having any horse you please taken up\r\nfor you to ride; I came over on Brown Ben, but he would shake you\r\ntoo much."\r\n\r\n"No, no, it\'s about a young fellow.  If you could take him back to\r\nYork to enlist--"\r\n\r\n"My dear Herbert, I ain\'t a recruiting-sergeant."\r\n\r\n"No, but it might be the saving of him," said Herbert, raising\r\nhimself and speaking with more animation.  "It is Harry Hornblower."\r\n\r\n"Why, that\'s the chap that bagged your athletic prizes!  Whew!\r\nRather strong, ain\'t it, Joan!"\r\n\r\n"He did no such thing," said Herbert, rather petulantly; "never\r\ndreamt of it.  He only was rather a fool in talking of them--\r\nvaunting of me, I believe, as not such a bad fellow for a parson; so\r\nhis friends got out of him where to find them.  But they knew better\r\nthan to take him with them.  Tell him, Jenny; he won\'t believe me."\r\n\r\n"It is quite true, Phil," said Jenny, "the poor fellow did get into\r\nbad company at the races, but that was all.  He did not come home\r\nthat night, but he was stupefied with drink and the beginning of the\r\nfever, and it was proved--perfectly proved--that he was fast asleep\r\nat a house at Backsworth when the robbery was committed, and he was\r\nas much shocked about it as any one--more, I am sure, than Herbert,\r\nwho was so relieved on finding him clear of it, that he troubled\r\nhimself very little about the things.  And now he has had the fever--\r\nnot very badly--and he is quite well now, but he can\'t get anything\r\nto do.  Truelove turned him off before the races for hanging about\r\nat the Three Pigeons, and nobody will employ him.  I do think it is\r\ntrue what they say--his mother, and Julius, and Herbert, and all--\r\nthat he has had a lesson, and wants to turn over a new leaf, but the\r\npeople here won\'t let him.  Julius and Herbert want him to enlist,\r\nand I believe he would, but his mother--as they all do--thinks that\r\nthe last degradation; but she might listen if Captain Bowater came\r\nand told her about his own regiment--cavalry too--and the style of\r\nmen in it--and it is the only chance for him."\r\n\r\nPhilip made a wry face.\r\n\r\n"You see I took him up and let him down," said Herbert, sadly and\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\n"I really do believe," said Jenny, clenching the matter, "that\r\nHerbert would get well much faster if Harry Hornblower were off his\r\nmind."\r\n\r\nPhil growled, and his younger brother and sister knew that they\r\nwould do their cause no good by another word.  There was an odd\r\nshyness about them all.  The elder brother had not yet said anything\r\nabout Jenny\'s prospects, and only asked after the party at the Hall.\r\n\r\n"All nearly well, except Frank\'s deafness," said Jenny.  "In a day\r\nor two he is going up to London to consult an aurist, and see\r\nwhether he can keep his clerkship.  Miles is going with him, and\r\nRosamond takes Terry up to see his brother in London, and then, I\r\nbelieve, she is going on to get rooms at Rockpier, while Miles comes\r\nhome to fetch his mother there."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Poynsett!" with infinite wonder.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, all this has really brought out much more power of activity\r\nin her.  You know it was said that there was more damage to the\r\nnervous system than anything else, and the shock has done her good.\r\nBesides, Miles is so much less timid about her than dear Raymond,\r\nwho always handled her like a cracked teapot, and never having known\r\nmuch of any other woman, did not understand what was good for her."\r\n\r\n"Miles has more pith in him than ever poor old Raymond had," said\r\nPhil.  "Poor old Poynsett, I used to think he wanted to be spoony on\r\nyou, Joan, if he had only known his own mind.  If he had, I suppose\r\nhe would have been alive now!"\r\n\r\n"What a pleasing situation for Jenny!" Herbert could not help\r\nmuttering.\r\n\r\n"Much better than running after ostriches in the wilderness," quoth\r\nPhilip.  "You ride them double, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Two little negro boys at a time," replied Jenny, "according to the\r\nnursery-book.  Will you come and try, Phil?"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to go out?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Jenny; "it depends on how mamma is, and how\r\nEdith gets on."\r\n\r\nPhilip gave a long whistle of dismay.  Herbert looked at him\r\nwistfully, longing to hear him utter some word of congratulation or\r\nsympathy with his sister; but none was forthcoming.  Philip had\r\ndisliked the engagement originally--never had cared for Archie\r\nDouglas, and was not melted now that Jenny was more valuable than\r\never.  She knew him too well to expect it of him, and did not want\r\nto leave him to vex Herbert by any expression of his opinion on the\r\nmatter, and on this account, as well as on that of the fatigue she\r\nsaw on her patient\'s features, she refused his kind offer of keeping\r\nguard while she went in the afternoon to church, adding that Herbert\r\nmust rest, as Mrs. Duncombe was coming afterwards to take leave of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nPhilip shrugged his shoulders in horror, and declared that he should\r\nnot return again till _that_ was over; but he should look in again\r\nbefore he went home to settle about Herbert\'s coming to York.\r\n\r\n"York!" said Herbert, with a gasp, as Jenny brought his jelly, and\r\narranged his pillows for a rest, while the dragoon\'s boots resounded\r\non the stairs.  "Please tell him to say no more about it.  I want\r\nthem all to understand that I\'m not going in for that sort of thing\r\nany more."\r\n\r\n"My dear, I think you had better not say things hotly and rashly;\r\nyou may feel so very differently by and by."\r\n\r\n"I know that," said Herbert; "but after all it is only what my\r\nordination vows mean, though I did not see it then.  And this year\r\nmust be a penance year; I had made up my mind to that before I fell\r\nill."\r\n\r\n"Only you must get well," said Jenny.\r\n\r\n"That takes care of itself when one is sound to begin with," said\r\nHerbert.  "And now that I have been brought back again, and had my\r\neyes opened, and have got another trial given me, it would be double\r\nshame to throw it away."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you will do that."\r\n\r\n"I only pray that all that seems burnt out of me by what I have\r\nseen, and heard, and felt, may not come back with my strength."\r\n\r\n"I could hardly pray that for you, Herbert," said Jenny.  "Spirits\r\nare wanted to bear a clergyman through his work, and though you are\r\nquite right not to _go in_ for those things, I should be sorry if\r\nyou never enjoyed what came in your way."\r\n\r\n"If I never was tempted."\r\n\r\n"It need not be temptation.  It would not be if your mind were full\r\nof your work--it would only be refreshment.  I don\'t want my boy to\r\nturn stern, and dry, and ungenial.  That would not be like your\r\nRector."\r\n\r\n"My Rector did not make such a bad start, and can trust himself\r\nbetter," said Herbert.  "Come, Jenny, don\'t look at me in that way.\r\nYou can\'t wish me to go to York, and meet those rattling girls\r\nagain?"\r\n\r\n"No, certainly not, though Sister Margaret told Rosamond they had\r\nnever had such a sobering lesson in their lives as their share in\r\nthe mischief to you."\r\n\r\n"It was not their fault," said Herbert.  "It was deeper down than\r\nthat.  And they were good girls after all, if one only had had\r\nsense."\r\n\r\n"Oh!--"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Jenny," with a little smile, as he read her face, "I\'m\r\nnot bitten--no--but they, and poor Lady Tyrrell, and all are proof\r\nenough that it is easy to turn my head, and that I am one who ought\r\nto keep out of that style of thing for the future.  So do silence\r\nPhil, for you know when he gets a thing into his head how he goes\r\non, and I do not think I can bear it now."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you can\'t," said Jenny, emphatically, "and I\'ll do my\r\nbest.  Only, Herbie, dear, do one thing for me, don\'t bind yourself\r\nby any regular renunciations of moderate things now your mind is\r\nexcited, and you are weak.  I am sure Julius or Dr. Easterby would\r\nsay so."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll think," said Herbert.  "But if I am forgiven for this year,\r\nnothing seems to me too much to give up to the Great Shepherd to\r\nshow my sorrow.  \'Feed My sheep\' was the way He bade St. Peter prove\r\nhis love."\r\n\r\nJenny longed to say it was feeding the sheep rather than self-\r\nprivation, but she was not sure of her ground, and Herbert\'s low,\r\nquiet, soft voice went to her heart.  There were two great tears on\r\nhis cheeks, he shut his eyes as if to keep back any more, and turned\r\nhis face inwards on the sofa, his lips still murmuring over \'Feed My\r\nsheep.\'  She looked at him, feeling as if, while her heart had\r\nwakened to new glad hopes of earth, her brother, in her fulfilled\r\nprayer, had soared beyond her.  They were both quite still till Mrs.\r\nDuncombe came to the door.\r\n\r\nShe was at the Rectory, her house being dismantled, and she, having\r\nstayed till the last case of fever was convalescent, and the Sisters\r\nrecalled, was to go the next day to her mother-in-law\'s.  She was\r\nalmost as much altered as Herbert himself.  Her jaunty air had given\r\nway to something equally energetic, but she looked wiry and worn,\r\nand her gold pheasant\'s crest had become little more than a sandy\r\nwisp, as she came quietly in and took the hand that Herbert held out\r\nto her, saying how glad she was to see him on the mend.\r\n\r\nHe asked after some of the people whom they had attended together,\r\nand listened to the details, asking specially after one or two\r\nfamilies, where one or both parents had been taken away.  "Poor\r\nCecil Poynsett is undertaking them," was the answer in each case.\r\nSome had been already sent to orphanages; others were boarded out\r\ntill places could be found for them; and the Sisters had taken\r\ncharge of two.\r\n\r\nThen one widow was to \'do for\' the Vicar, who had taken solitary\r\npossession of the Vicarage, but would soon be joined there by one or\r\nmore curates.  He had been inducted into the ruinous chancel of the\r\npoor old church, had paid the architect of the Rat-house fifty\r\npounds (a sum just equalling the proceeds of the bazaar) to be rid\r\nof his plans; had brought down a first-rate architect; and in the\r\nmeantime was working the little iron church vigorously.\r\n\r\n"Everything seems to be beginning there just as I go into exile!"\r\nsaid Mrs. Duncombe.  "It seems odd that I should have to go from\r\nwhat I have only just learnt to prize.  But you have taught mo a\r\ngood deal--"\r\n\r\n"Every one must have learnt a good deal," said Herbert wearily.  "If\r\none only has!"\r\n\r\n"I meant you yourself, and that is what I came to thank you for.\r\nYes, I did; even if you don\'t like to hear it, your sister does, and\r\nI must have it out.  I shall recollect you again and again standing\r\nover all those beds, and shrinking from nothing, and I shall hold up\r\nthe example to my boys."\r\n\r\n"Do hold up something better!"\r\n\r\n"Can you write?" she said abruptly.\r\n\r\n"I have written a few lines to my mother."\r\n\r\n"Do you remember what you said that night, when you had to hold that\r\npoor man in his delirium, and his wife was so wild with fright that\r\nshe could not help?"\r\n\r\n"I am not sure what you mean."\r\n\r\n"You said it three or four times.  It was only--"\r\n\r\n"I remember," said Herbert, as she paused; "it was the only thing I\r\ncould recollect in the turmoil."\r\n\r\n"Would it tire you very much to write it for me in the flyleaf of\r\nthis Prayer-Book that Mr. Charnock has given me?"\r\n\r\nHerbert pulled himself into a sitting posture, and signed to his\r\nsister to give him the ink.\r\n\r\n"I shall spoil your book," he said, as his hand shook.\r\n\r\n"Never mind," she said, eagerly, "the words come back to me whenever\r\nI think of the life I have to face, and I want them written; they\r\nsoothe me, as they soothed that frightened woman and raving man."\r\n\r\nAnd Herbert wrote.  It was only--\'The Lord is a very present help in\r\ntrouble.\'\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said; "thank you.  Put your initials, pray.  There--thank\r\nyou.  No, you can never tell what it was to me to hear those words,\r\nso quietly, and gravely, and strongly, in that deadly struggle.  It\r\nseemed to me, for the first time in all my life, that God is a real\r\nPresence and an actual Help.  There!  I see Miss Bowater wants me\r\ngone; so I am off.  I shall hear of you."\r\n\r\nHerbert was exhausted with the exertion, and only exchanged a close\r\npressure of the hand, and when Jenny came back, after seeing the\r\nlady to the door, she thought there were tears on his cheek, and\r\nbent down to kiss him.\r\n\r\n"That was just the way, Jenny," his low, tired voice said.  "I never\r\ncould recollect what I wanted to say.  Only just those few Psalms\r\nthat you did manage to teach me before I went to school, they came\r\nback and back."\r\n\r\nJenny had no time to answer, for the feet of Philip were on the\r\nstairs.  He had been visiting Mrs. Hornblower, and persuading her\r\nthat to make a dragoon of her son was the very best thing for him--\r\ngreat promotion, and quite removed from the ordinary vulgar\r\nenlistment in the line--till he had wiled consent out of her.  And\r\nthough Philip declared it was blarney, and was inclined to think it\r\ninfra dig. to have thus exerted his eloquence, it was certain that\r\nMrs. Hornblower would console herself by mentioning to her\r\nneighbours that her son was gone in compliment to Captain Bowater,\r\nwho had taken a fancy to him.\r\n\r\nThe relief to Herbert was infinite; but he was by this time too much\r\ntired to do anything but murmur his thanks, and wish himself safe\r\nback in his bed, and Philip\'s strong-armed aid in reaching that\r\nhaven was not a little appreciated.\r\n\r\nJulius looked in with his mother\'s entreaty that Philip, and if\r\npossible his sister, should come up to eat their Christmas dinner at\r\nthe Hall; and Herbert, wearily declaring that sleep was all he\r\nneeded, and that Cranky would be more than sufficient for him,\r\ninsisted on their accepting the invitation; and Jenny was not sorry,\r\nfor she did not want a tete-a-tete with Philip so close to her\r\npatient\'s room, that whatever he chose to hear, he might.\r\n\r\nShe had quite enough of it in the walk to the Hall.  Phil, with the\r\npersistency of a person bent on doing a kind thing, returned to his\r\nYork plan, viewing it as excellent relaxation for a depressed, over-\r\nworked man, and certain it would be a great treat to \'little Herb.\'\r\nHe still looked on the tall young man as the small brother to be\r\npatronized, and protected, and dragged out of home-petting; so he\r\npooh-poohed all Jenny\'s gentler hints as to Herbert\'s need of care\r\nand desire to return to his work, until she was obliged to say\r\nplainly that he had entreated her to beg it might not be argued with\r\nhim again, as he was resolved against amusement for the present.\r\n\r\nThen Phil grew very angry both with Herbert and Jenny.\r\n\r\n"Did they suppose he wanted the boy to do anything unclerical?"\r\n\r\n"No; but you know it was by nothing positively unclerical that he\r\nwas led aside before."\r\n\r\nPhil broke out into a tirade against the folly of Jenny\'s speech.\r\nIn his view, Herbert\'s conduct at Wil\'sbro\' had confuted the\r\nBishop\'s censure, and for his own part, he only wished to amuse the\r\nboy, and give him rest, and if he did take him to a ball, or even\r\nout with the hounds, he would be on leave, and in another diocese,\r\nwhere the Bishop had nothing to do with him.\r\n\r\nJenny tried to make him understand that dread of the Bishop was the\r\nlast thing in Herbert\'s mind.  It was rather that he did not think\r\nit right to dissipate away a serious impression.\r\n\r\nThat was worse than before.  She was threatened with the most\r\nserious displeasure of her father and mother, if she encouraged\r\nHerbert in the morbid ascetic notions ascribed to Dr. Easterby.\r\n\r\n"It was always the way with the women--they never knew where to\r\nstop."\r\n\r\n"No," said Jenny, "I did not know there was anywhere to stop in the\r\nway of Heaven."\r\n\r\n"As if there were no way to Heaven without making a fool of\r\noneself."\r\n\r\nThis answer made Jenny sorry for her own, as needlessly vexatious,\r\nand yet she recollected St. Paul\'s Christian paradoxes, and felt\r\nthat poor Herbert might have laid hold of the true theory of the\r\nministry.  At any rate, she was glad that they were at that moment\r\nhailed and overtaken by the party from the Rectory, and that Phil\r\npounced at once on Julius, to obtain his sanction to giving Herbert\r\na little diversion at York.\r\n\r\nJulius answered more warily, "Does he wish it?"\r\n\r\n"No; but he is too weak yet, and is hipped and morbid."\r\n\r\n"Well, Phil, I would not put it into his head.  No doubt you would\r\ntake very good care of him, but I doubt whether your father would\r\nlike the Bishop to hear of him--under the circumstances--going to\r\ndisport himself at the dragoon mess.  Besides, I don\'t think he will\r\nbe well enough before Lent, and then of course he could not."\r\n\r\nThis outer argument in a man\'s voice pacified Phil, as Julius knew\r\nit would, much better than the deeper one, and he contented himself\r\nwith muttering that he should write to his father about it, which\r\nevery one knew he was most likely not to do.\r\n\r\nWho could have foretold last Christmas who would be the party at\r\nthat dinner?  Mrs. Poynsett at the head of her own table, and Miles\r\nin the master\'s place, and the three waifs from absent families\r\nwould have seemed equally unlikely guests; while of last year\'s\r\nparty--Charlie was in India, Tom De Lancey with the aunts in\r\nIreland, Cecil at Dunstone.  Mrs. Duncombe was perfectly quiet, not\r\nonly from the subduing influence of all she had undergone, but\r\nbecause she felt herself there like an intruder, and would have\r\nrefused, but that to leave her at home would have distressed her\r\nhostess.  Mrs. Poynsett had never seen her before, and after all she\r\nhad heard about her, was quite amazed at the sight of such an\r\ninsignificant little person as she was without her dash and sparkle,\r\nand in a dress which, when no longer coquettish, verged upon the\r\nslovenly.\r\n\r\nPoor thing, she was waiting till the Christmas visit of the elder\r\nMrs. Duncombe\'s own daughter was over, so that there might be room\r\nfor her, and she was thankful for the reprieve, which left her able\r\nto spend Christmas among the privileges she had only learnt to value\r\njust as she was deprived of them.  She looked at Mrs. Poynsett, half\r\nin curiosity, half in compunction, as she remembered how she had\r\nhelped to set Cecil against her.\r\n\r\n"But then," as she said to Rosamond, in going home, "I had\r\nprejudices about the genus belle-mere.  And mine always knew and\r\nsaid I should ruin her son, in which, alas! she was quite right!"\r\n\r\n"She will be pleased now," said Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, I believe she had rather I were rapidity personified\r\nthan owe the change to any one of your Rector\'s sort.  I have had a\r\nletter or two, warning me against the Sisters, or thinking there is\r\nany merit in works of mercy.  Ah, well!  I\'ll try to think her a\r\ngood old woman!  But if she had only not strained the cord till it\r\nsnapped, how much happier Bob and I should have been!"\r\n\r\nWhat a difference there is between straining the cord for one\'s self\r\nand for other people!  So Julius could not help feeling when\r\nHerbert, in spite of all that could be said to him, about morbid\r\nhaste in renunciation, sent for the village captain of the cricket-\r\nclub, and delivered over to him the bat, which had hitherto been as\r\na knightly sword to him, resigning his place in the Compton Poynsett\r\nEleven, and replying to the dismayed entreaties and assurances of\r\nthe young farmer that he would reconsider his decision, and that he\r\nwould soon be quite strong again, that he had spent too much time\r\nover cricket, and liked it too well to trust himself at it again.\r\n\r\nThat was the last thing before on a New Year\'s Day, which was like\r\nan April day, Herbert came into church once more, and then was\r\ncarried off in the Strawyers carriage, lying back half ashamed, half\r\nastonished, at the shower of strange tears which the ecstatic shouts\r\nand cheers of the village boys had called forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\nRockpier\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Love himself took part against himself\r\n   To warn us off.--TENNYSON\r\n\r\nRosamond was to have a taste of her old vocation, and go campaigning\r\nfor lodgings, the searching for which she declared to be her\r\nstrongest point.  Rockpier was to be the destination of the family;\r\nEleonora Vivian, whose letters had been far fewer than had been\r\nexpected of her, was known to be there with her father, and this was\r\nlure sufficient for Frank.  Frank\'s welfare again was the lure to\r\nMrs. Poynsett; and the benefit Rosamond was to derive from sea air,\r\nafter all she had gone through, made Julius willing to give himself\r\nthe holiday that everybody insisted on his having until Lent.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, was sent off an advanced guard, consisting of\r\nRosamond and Terry, who went up to London with Frank, that he might\r\nthere consult an aurist, and likewise present himself to his chief,\r\nand see whether he could keep his clerkship.  All this turned out\r\nwell, his duties did not depend on his ears, and a month\'s longer\r\nleave of absence was granted to him; moreover, his deafness was\r\npronounced to be likely to yield to treatment, and a tube restored\r\nhim to somewhat easier intercourse with mankind, and he was in high\r\nspirits, when, after an evening spent with Rosamond\'s friends, the\r\nM\'Kinnons, the trio took an early train for Rockpier, where Rosamond\r\ncould not detain Frank even to come to the hotel with them and have\r\nluncheon before hurrying off to Verdure Point, the villa inhabited\r\nby Sir Harry.  All he had done all the way down was to impress upon\r\nher, in the fulness of his knowledge of the place, that the only\r\nhabitable houses in Rockpier were in that direction--the nearer to\r\nVerdure Point the more perfect!\r\n\r\nTerry listened with smiling eyes, sometimes viewing the lover as a\r\nbore, sometimes as a curious study, confirming practical statements.\r\nTerry was thoroughly well, only with an insatiable appetite, and he\r\nviewed his fellow convalescent\'s love with double wonder when he\r\nfound it caused oblivion of hunger, especially as Frank still looked\r\ngaunt and sallow, and was avowedly not returned to his usual health.\r\n\r\nRosamond set forth house-hunting, dropping Terry ere long at the\r\nLibrary, where she went to make inquiries, and find the sine qua\r\nnon.  When she reached the sitting-room at the hotel, she found\r\nFrank cowering over the fire in an arm-chair, the picture of\r\ndespondency.  Of course, he did not hear her entrance, and she\r\ndarted up to him, and put her hand on his shoulder.  He looked up to\r\nher with an attempt at indifference.\r\n\r\n"Well, Frank!"\r\n\r\n"Well, Rose!  How have you sped?"\r\n\r\n"I have got a house; but it is in Marine Terrace.  I don\'t know what\r\nyou\'ll say to me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that it signifies."\r\n\r\n"You are shivering!  What\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Only, it is very cold!"\r\n\r\n(Aside.  "Ring the bell, Terry, he is as cold as ice.")  "Did you\r\nsee her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes.  Did you have any luncheon?"  ("Some port-wine and hot\r\nwater directly, please.")\r\n\r\n"Yes, I believe so.  You are not ordering anything for me?  There\'s\r\nnothing amiss--only it is so cold."\r\n\r\n"It is cold, and you are not to be cold; nor are we to be cold, sir.\r\nYou must go to bed early in the evening, Terry," said Rosamond, at\r\nlast.  "I shall make nothing of him while you are by, and an hour\'s\r\nmore sleep will not be lost on you."\r\n\r\n"Will you come and tell me then, Rosey?  I deserve something."\r\n\r\n"What, for sleeping there instead of here, when you\'ve nothing to\r\ndo?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, but I have.  I want to make out this little Chaucer.  I\r\nshall go down to the coffee-room and do it."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you like poking out your eyes with the gas in the coffee-\r\nroom, I have no objection, since you are too proud to go to bed.\r\nWish him good night first, and do it naturally."\r\n\r\n"Nature would be thrown away on him, poor fellow," said Terry, as he\r\nroused Frank with difficulty to have \'Good night\' roared into his\r\near, and give a listless hand.  He was about to deal with Rosamond\r\nin the same way, but she said--\r\n\r\n"No, I am not going yet," and settled herself opposite to him, with\r\nher half-knitted baby\'s shoe in her hands, and her feet on the\r\nfender, her crape drawn up from the fire, disposed for conversation.\r\nFrank, on the other hand, fell back into the old position, looking\r\nso wretched that she could bear it no longer, picked up the tube,\r\nforced it on him, and said, "Do tell me, dear Frank.  You used to\r\ntell me long ago."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.  "That\'s all over.  You are very good, Rosamond,\r\nbut you should not have forced her to come to me."\r\n\r\n"Not!"\r\n\r\n"My life was not worth saving."\r\n\r\n"She has not gone back from you again?--the horrible girl!" (this\r\nlast aside).\r\n\r\n"It is not that she has gone back.  She has never changed.  It is I\r\nwho have forfeited her."\r\n\r\n"You!--You!--She has not cast you off?"\r\n\r\n"You know how it was, and the resolution by which she had bound\r\nherself, and how I was maddened."\r\n\r\n"That!  I thought it was all forgiven and forgotten!" cried\r\nRosamond.\r\n\r\n"It is not a matter of forgiveness.  She put it to me whether it was\r\npossible to begin on a broken word."\r\n\r\n"Worse and worse!  Why, when you\'ve spoken a foolish word, it is the\r\nfoolishest thing in the world to hold to it."\r\n\r\n"If it were a foolish word!" said poor Frank.  "I think I could have\r\natoned for that day, if she could have tried me; but when she left\r\nme to judge, and those eyes of sweet, sorrowful--"\r\n\r\n"Sweet!  Sorrowful, indeed!  About as sweet and sorrowful as the\r\nbutcher to the lamb.  Left you to judge!  A refinement of cruelty!\r\nShe had better have stayed away when I told her it was the only\r\nchance to save your life."\r\n\r\n"Would that she had!" sighed Frank.  "But that was your doing,\r\nRosamond, and what she did in mere humanity can\'t be cast back again\r\nto bind her against her conscience."\r\n\r\n"Plague on her conscience!" was my Lady\'s imprecation.  "I wonder if\r\nit is all coquetry!"\r\n\r\n"She deserves no blame," said Frank, understanding the manner,\r\nthough the words were under Rosamond\'s breath.  "Her very troubles\r\nin her own family have been the cause of her erecting a standard of\r\nwhat alone she could trust.  Once in better days she fancied I came\r\nup to it, and when I know how far I have fallen short of it--"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense.  She had no business to make the condition without\r\nwarning you."\r\n\r\n"She knows more of me than only that," muttered poor Frank.  "I was\r\nan ass in town last summer.  It was the hope of seeing her that drew\r\nme; but if I had kept out of that set, all this would never have\r\nbeen."\r\n\r\n"It was all for her sake."  (A substratum of \'Ungrateful, ungenerous\r\ngirl.\')\r\n\r\n"For her sake, I thought--not her true sake."  Then there was a\r\nsilence, broken by his exclaiming, "Rose, I must get away from\r\nhere!"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t," she called back.  "Here\'s your mother coming.  She\r\nwould be perfectly miserable to find you gone."\r\n\r\n"It is impossible I should stay here."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be so chicken-hearted, Frank.  If she has a heart worth\r\nspeaking of, she\'ll come round, if you only press hard enough.  If\r\nnot, you are well quit of her."\r\n\r\nHe cried out at this, and Rosamond saw that what she called\r\nfaintness of heart was really reverence and sense of his own\r\nfailings; but none the less did she scorn such misplaced adoration,\r\nas it seemed to her, and scold him in her own fashion, for not\r\nrushing on to conquer irresistibly; or else being cool and easy as\r\nto his rejection.  He would accept neither alternative, was\r\ndepressed beyond the power of comfort, bodily weariness adding to\r\nhis other ills, and went off at last to bed, without retracting his\r\nintention of going away.\r\n\r\n"Well, Terry, it is a new phase, and a most perplexing one!" said\r\nRosamond, when her brother came back with arch curiosity in his\r\nbrown eyes.  "The girl has gone and turned him over, and there he\r\nlies on his back prostrate, just like Ponto, when he knows he\r\ndeserves it!"\r\n\r\n"Turned him over--you don\'t mean that she is off?  I thought she was\r\na perfect angel of loveliness and goodness."\r\n\r\n"Goodness!  It is enough to make one hate goodness, unless this is\r\nall mere pretence on her part.  But what I am afraid of is his\r\nsetting off, no one knows where, before any one is up, and leaving\r\nus to confront his mother, while he falls ill in some dog-hole of a\r\nplace.  He is not fit to go about by himself, and I trust to you to\r\nwatch him, Terry."\r\n\r\n"Shall I lie on the mat outside his door?" said Terry, half meaning\r\nit, and somewhat elated by the romantic situation.\r\n\r\n"No, we are not come to quite such extremities.  You need not even\r\nturn his key by mistake; only keep your ears open.  He is next to\r\nyou, is he not?--and go in on pretext of inquiry--if you hear him up\r\nto mischief."\r\n\r\nNothing was heard but the ordinary summons of Boots; and it turned\r\nout in the morning that the chill had exasperated his throat, and\r\nreduced him to a condition which took away all inclination to move,\r\nbesides deafening him completely.\r\n\r\nRosamond had to rush about all day, providing plenishing for the\r\nlodging.  Once she saw Sir Harry and his daughter in the distance,\r\nand dashed into a shop to avoid them, muttering, "I don\'t believe\r\nshe cared for him one bit.  I dare say she has taken up with Lorimer\r\nStrangeways after all!  Rather worse than her sister, I declare, for\r\nshe never pretended to be too _good_ for Raymond," and then as a\r\ncurate in a cassock passed--"Ah! some of them have been working on\r\nher, and persuading her that he is not good enough for her.\r\nImpertinent prig!  He looks just capable of it!"\r\n\r\nFrank was no better as to cold and deafness, though somewhat less\r\nuncomfortable the next day in the lodging, and Rosamond went up\r\nwithout him to the station to meet the rest of the party, and\r\narrange for Mrs. Poynsett\'s conveyance.  They had accomplished the\r\njourney much better than had been, hoped, but it was late and dark\r\nenough to make it expedient that Mrs. Poynsett should be carried to\r\nbed at once, after her most unwonted fatigue, and only have one\r\nglimpse and embrace of Frank, so as to stave off the knowledge of\r\nhis troubles till after her night\'s rest.  He seconded this desire,\r\nand indeed Miles and Anne only saw that he had a bad cold; but\r\nRosamond no sooner had her husband to herself, than she raved over\r\nhis wrongs to her heart\'s content, and implored Julius to redress\r\nthem, though how, she did not well know, since she by turns declared\r\nthat Frank was well quit of Lenore, and that he would never get over\r\nthe loss.\r\n\r\nJulius demurred a good deal to her wish of sending him on a mission\r\nto Eleonora.  All Charnocks naturally swung back to distrust of the\r\nVivians, and he did not like to plead with a girl who seemed only to\r\nbe making an excuse to reject his brother; while, on the other hand,\r\nhe knew that Raymond had not been satisfied with Frank\'s London\r\nhabits, nor had he himself been at ease as to his religious\r\npractices, which certainly had been the minimum required to suit his\r\nmother\'s notions.  He had been a communicant on Christmas Day, but\r\nhe was so entirely out of reach that there was no knowing what\r\ndifference his illness might have made in him; Eleonora might know\r\nmore than his own family did, and have good and conscientious\r\nreasons for breaking with him; and, aware that his own authority had\r\nweight with her, Julius felt it almost too much responsibility to\r\ninterfere till the next day, when his mother, with tears in her\r\neyes, entreated him to go to Miss Vivian, to find out what was this\r\ndreadful misunderstanding, which perhaps might only be from his want\r\nof hearing, and implore her, in the name of an old woman, not to\r\nbreak her boy\'s heart and darken his life, as it had been with his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett was tremulous and agitated, and grief had evidently\r\ntold on her high spirit, so that Julius could make no objection, but\r\npromised to do his best.\r\n\r\nBy the time it was possible to Julius to call, Sir Harry and Miss\r\nVivian were out riding, and he had no further chance till at the\r\ngaslit Friday evening lecture, to which he had hurried after dinner.\r\nA lady became faint in the heated atmosphere, two rows of chairs\r\nbefore him, and as she turned to make her way out, he saw that it\r\nwas Eleonora, and was appalled by seeing not only the whiteness of\r\nthe present faintness, but that thinness and general alteration\r\nwhich had changed the beautiful face so much that he asked himself\r\nfor a moment whether she could have escaped the fever.  In that\r\nmoment he had moved forward to her support; and she, seeming to have\r\nno one belonging to her, clung to the friendly arm, and was\r\npresently in the porch, where the cool night air revived her at\r\nonce, and she begged him to return, saying nothing ailed her but\r\ngas.\r\n\r\n"No, I shall see you home, Lena."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, there is no need," said the trembling voice, in which he\r\ndetected a sob very near at hand.\r\n\r\n"I shall use my own judgment as to that," said Julius, kindly.\r\n\r\nShe made no more resistance, but rose from the seat in the porch,\r\nand accepted his arm.  He soon felt that her steps were growing\r\nfirmer, and he ventured to say, "I had been looking for you to-day."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I saw your card."\r\n\r\n"I had a message to you from my mother."  Lenore trembled again, but\r\ndid not dare to relax her hold on him.  "I think you can guess what\r\nit is.  She thinks poor Frank must have mistaken what you said."\r\n\r\n"No--I wrote it," said Lena, very low.\r\n\r\n"And you really meant that the resolution made last year is to stand\r\nbetween you and Frank?  I am not blaming you, I do not know whether\r\nyou may not be acting rightly and wisely, and whether you may not\r\nhave more reason than I know of to shrink from intrusting yourself\r\nto Frank; but my mother cannot understand it, and when she sees him\r\nheartbroken, and too unwell to act for himself--"\r\n\r\n"Oh! is he ill?"\r\n\r\n"He has a very bad cold, and could not get up till the afternoon,\r\nand he is deafer than ever."\r\n\r\nLena moaned.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded:  "So as he cannot act for himself, my mother begged me\r\nto come to an understanding."\r\n\r\n"I told him to judge," said Lena faintly, but turning Julius so as\r\nto walk back along the parade instead of to her abode.\r\n\r\n"Was not that making him his own executioner?" said Julius.\r\n\r\n"A promise is binding," she added.\r\n\r\n"Yet, is it quite fair?" said Julius, sure now which way her heart\r\nwent, and thinking she was really longing to be absolved from a\r\nsuperstitious feeling; "is it fair to expect another person to be\r\nbound by a vow of which you have not told him?"\r\n\r\n"I never thought he could," sighed she.\r\n\r\n"And you know he was entrapped!" said Julius, roused to defend his\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n"And by whom?" she said in accents of deep pain.\r\n\r\n"I should have thought it just--both by your poor sister and by him--\r\nto undo the wrong then wrought," said Julius, "unless, indeed, you\r\nhave some further cause for distrusting him?"\r\n\r\n"No! no!" cried she.  "Oh, Julius!  I do it for his own good.  Your\r\nmother knows not what she wishes, in trying to entangle him again\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\n"Lenore, will you tell me if anything in him besides that unhappy\r\nslip makes you distrust him?"\r\n\r\n"I must tell the whole truth," gasped the poor girl, as they walked\r\nalong in the sound of the sea, the dark path here and there\r\nbrightened by the gas-lights, "or you will think it is his fault!\r\nJulius, I know more about my poor father than ever I did before.  I\r\nwas a child when I lived here before, and then Camilla took all the\r\nmanagement.  When we came to London, two months ago, I soon saw the\r\nkind of people he got round him for his comforters.  I knew how he\r\nspent his evenings.  It is second nature to him--he can\'t get put of\r\nit, I believe!  I persuaded him to come down here, thinking it a\r\nhaven of peace and safety.  Alas!  I little knew what old habits\r\nthere were to resume, nor what was the real reason Camilla brought\r\nus away after paying our debts.  I was a happy child _then_, when I\r\nonly knew that papa was gone to his club.  Now I know that it is a\r\nbilliard-room--and that it is doing all the more harm because he is\r\nthere--and I see him with people whom he does not like me to speak\r\nto.  I don\'t know whether I could get him away, and it would be as\r\nbad anywhere else.  I don\'t think he can help it.  And he is often\r\nunwell; he can\'t do without me when he has the gout, and I ought not\r\nto leave him to himself.  And then, if--if we did marry and he lived\r\nwith us in London, think what it would be for Frank to have such a\r\nset brought about him.  I don\'t see how he could keep them off.  Or\r\neven an engagement bringing him down here--or anywhere, among papa\'s\r\nfriends would be very bad for him.  I saw it in London, even with\r\nCamilla to keep things in check."  She was almost choked with\r\nsuppressed agony.\r\n\r\n"I see," said Julius, gravely and pitifully, "it would take a man of\r\nmore age and weight than poor Frank to deal with the habits of a\r\nlifetime.  The risk is great."\r\n\r\n"And when I saw it," added Eleonora, "I felt I must never, never\r\nbring him into it.  And how could I tell him?  Your mother does not\r\nknow, or she could not wish it!"\r\n\r\n"It is plain that in the present state of things you ought not to\r\nmarry, and so far you are judging nobly," said Julius; "but next\r\ncomes the question--how far it is well to make that day at the races\r\nthe pretext?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t call it a pretext," said Lenore, quickly.  "I meant what I\r\nsaid a year ago, with all my soul.  Perhaps it was hasty, when poor\r\nCamilla drove me into saying I did not mean only an habitual\r\ngambler, but one who had ever betted.  And now, well as I know how\r\ncruelly she used that presumptuous vow of mine, and how she repented\r\nof it at last, still I feel that to fly in its face might be so\r\nwrong, that I should have no right to expect not to drag Frank\r\ndown."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I am too much interested to judge fairly," said Julius.  "I\r\nshould like you to consult some one--say Dr. Easterby--but it seems\r\nto me that it is just such a vow as you may well be absolved from."\r\n\r\n"But is it not Frank\'s protection?"\r\n\r\n"Put yourself in that poor fellow\'s place, Lena, and see what it is\r\nto him to be cast off for such a reason.  He did the wrong, I know.\r\nHe knew he ought not, apart from your resolution, and he did thus\r\nprove his weakness and unfitness--"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, no--it was not his fault."\r\n\r\nJulius laughed a little, and added, "I am not saying he deserves\r\nyou--hush!--or that it would be well to take him now, only that I\r\nthink to find himself utterly rejected for so insufficient a reason,\r\nand when he was really deceived, would not only half kill him now,\r\nbut do his whole nature cruel harm."\r\n\r\n"What is to be done then?" sighed Eleonora.\r\n\r\n"I should say, and I think my mother would put him on some probation\r\nif you like, even before you call it an engagement; but give him\r\nhope.  Let him know that your attachment is as true and unselfish as\r\never, and do not let him brood in misery, enhanced by his deafness."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t marry while poor papa is like what he is," said she, as if\r\ntrying to keep hold of her purpose.\r\n\r\n"But you can be Frank\'s light and hope--the prize for which he can\r\nwork."\r\n\r\n"If--your mother will have it so--then," said Eleonora, and the sigh\r\nthat followed was one to relieve, not exhaust.\r\n\r\n"May I tell her then?"\r\n\r\n"You must, I suppose," said the poor girl; "but she can never wish\r\nit to go on!"\r\n\r\nJulius left her at her own door and went home.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Poynsett said, she could expect nothing better of him.  "It\r\nis quite clear," she said, "that poor Lena is right, that Frank must\r\nnot set up housekeeping with him.  Even if he were certain to be\r\nproof against temptation, it would be as bad a connection as could\r\nbe.  I never thought of his being with them; but I suppose there is\r\nnothing else to be done with him."\r\n\r\n"Frank ought not to be exposed to the trial.  The old man has a\r\ncertain influence over him."\r\n\r\n"Though I should have thought such a hoary old wreck was nothing but\r\na warning.  It has been a most unhappy affair from first to last;\r\nbut Lena is a good, unselfish girl, and nothing else will give Frank\r\na chance of happiness.  Waiting will do them no harm, they are young\r\nenough, and have no great sum to marry upon, so if you can bring her\r\nto me to-morrow, Julius, I will ask her to grant my poor boy leave\r\nto wait till she can see her way to marrying."\r\n\r\nJulius ventured to write down, \'Hope on!\'\r\n\r\nTo this Frank replied with rather a fiery look, "Mind, I will not\r\nhave her persuaded or worked on.  It must be all her own doing.\r\nYes," answering a look of his brother, "I see what you are about.\r\nYou want to tell her it is a superstition about her vow and not\r\nusing me fairly.  So it may be in some points of view; but the fact\r\nremains.  She thought she might trust to my good sense and\r\nprinciple, and it proved that she was wrong.  After that it is not\r\nright to force myself on her.  I don\'t dare to do it, Julius.  I\r\nhave not been shut up with myself all these weeks for nothing.  I\r\nknow now how unworthy I ever was to think of her as mine.  If I can\r\never prove my repentance she might in time forgive me; but for her\r\nto be driven to take me out of either supposed justice or mercy, I\r\nwill not stand!  A wretched deaf being like me!  It is not fitting,\r\nand I _will_ not have it done!"\r\n\r\nJulius wrote--"She is suffering greatly.  She nearly fainted at\r\nchurch, and I had to take her out."\r\n\r\nFrank\'s face worked, and he put his hand over it as he said, "You\r\nare all torturing her; I shall write a letter and settle it myself."\r\n\r\nFrank did write the letter that very night, and when Julius next saw\r\nEleonora her eyes were swollen with weeping, and she said--\r\n\r\n"Take me to him!  I must comfort him!"\r\n\r\n"You have heard from him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Such a beautiful letter.  But he must not think it _that_."\r\n\r\nShe did show the letter, reserved though she was.  She was right\r\nabout it; Julius was struck with the humble sweetness, which made\r\nhim think more highly of poor Frank than ever he had done before.\r\nHe had decided against himself, feeling how much his fall at the\r\nrace-ground had been the effect of the manner in which he had\r\nallowed himself to be led during the previous season in London, and\r\nowning how far his whole aim in life fell short of what it ought to\r\nbe, asking nothing for himself, not even hope nor patience, though\r\nhe could not refrain from expressing his own undying love, and his\r\none desire that if she had not attached herself to one more worthy,\r\nhe might in time be thought to have proved his repentance.  In the\r\nmeantime she would and could be only his beacon star.\r\n\r\nJulius could not but take her home, and leave her with Frank, though\r\nhis mother was a little annoyed not to have first seen her; but when\r\nFrank himself brought her to Mrs. Poynsett\'s arms, it turned out\r\nthat the two ladies were quite of one mind as to the inexpediency of\r\nSir Harry living with Frank.  They said it very covertly, but each\r\nunderstood the other, and Eleonora went home wonderfully happier,\r\nand looking as if her fresh beauty would soon return.\r\n\r\nThere was quite enough to dazzle Miles, whose first opinion was that\r\nthey were hard on Sir Harry, and that two ladies and a clergyman\r\nmight be making a great deal too much of an old man\'s form of\r\nloitering, especially in a female paradise of ritualism, as he was\r\npleased to call Rockpier, where all the male population seemed to be\r\ninvalids.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was not long before he came round to their view.  He\r\nfound that Sir Harry, in spite of his gentlemanly speech and\r\nbearing, was a battered old roue, who was never happy but when\r\ngambling, and whose air and title were baits to victims of a lower\r\nclass than himself; young clerks and medical students who were\r\nflattered by his condescension.  He did not actually fleece them\r\nhimself, he had too little worldly wisdom for that; but he was the\r\ndecoy of a coterie of Nyms, Pistols, and Bardolphs, who gathered up\r\nthe spoil of these and any unwary youth who came to Rockpier in the\r\nwake of an invalid, or to \'see life\' at a fashionable watering-\r\nplace.  Miles thought the old man was probably reduced to a worse\r\nstyle of company by the very fact of the religious atmosphere of the\r\nplace, where he himself found so little to do that he longed for the\r\nopening of the Session; but he was strongly impressed with the\r\nimpracticability of a menage for Frank, with the baronet as father-\r\nin-law.\r\n\r\nNot so, Sir Harry.  He was rather fond of Frank, and had been glad\r\nto be no longer bound to oppose the match, and he had benignantly\r\nmade up his mind to the great sacrifice of living in his house in\r\nLondon, surrounding himself with all his friends, and making the\r\nyoung couple supply him with pocket-money whenever he had a run of\r\nill-luck.  They would grant it more easily than Camilla, and would\r\nnever presume to keep him under regulation as she had done.  They\r\nwould be too grateful to him.\r\n\r\nSo, after a day or two, he demanded of Eleonora whether her young\r\nman had given her up, or what he meant by his coolness in not\r\ncalling?  Lena answered the last count by explaining how unwell he\r\nhad been, and how his hearing might be lost by a renewal of his\r\ncold.  She was however further pressed, and obliged to say how\r\nmatters stood, namely, that they were engaged, but meant to wait.\r\n\r\nWhereupon, Sir Harry, quite sincerely, poor old man, grew\r\ncompassionate and grandly benignant.  The young people were prudent,\r\nbut he would come to their aid.  His pittance added to theirs--even\r\nnow would set all things straight.  He would never stand in the way\r\nof their happiness!\r\n\r\nMrs. Poynsett had bidden Lena cast the whole on her shoulders.  The\r\ngirl was too truthful and generous to do this, fond as she still was\r\nof her father.\r\n\r\n"No, dear papa," she said, "it is very kind in you," for she knew\r\nthat so he meant it, "but I am afraid it will not quite do.  You see\r\nFrank must be very careful in his situation--and I don\'t think so\r\nquiet a way of life would suit you."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, child; I\'m an old man, and I want no racketing.  Just\r\nhouse-room for myself and Victor.  That fellow is worth two women in\r\na house.  You\'ll keep a good cook.  I\'ll never ask for more than a\r\nfew old friends to dinner, when I don\'t feel disposed to have them\r\nat the club."\r\n\r\nOld friends!  Yes, Lenore knew them, and her flesh crept to think of\r\nFrank\'s chief hearing of them constantly at his house.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think we should afford it, dear papa," she said.  "We have\r\nagreed that I had better stay with you for the present, and let\r\nFrank make his way."\r\n\r\nThen a thought occurred to Sir Harry.  "Is this the Poynsetts\'\r\ndoing?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Eleonora, stoutly.  "It is mine.  I know that--oh! papa,\r\nforgive me!--the things and people you like would not be good for\r\nFrank, and I will not leave you nor bring him into them.  Never!"\r\n\r\nSir Harry swore--almost for the first time before her--that this was\r\nthat old hag Mrs. Poynsett\'s doing, and that she would make his\r\nchild abandon him in his old age.  He would not have his daughter\r\ndragged into a long engagement.  Wait--he knew what waiting meant--\r\nwait for his death; but they should have her now or not at all; and\r\nhe flung away from her and her entreaties to announce his\r\ndetermination to the suitor\'s family.\r\n\r\nHe did not find this very easy to accomplish.  Frank\'s ears were\r\nquite impervious to all his storming, and if he was to reduce his\r\nwords to paper, they came less easily.  Miles, to whom he tried to\r\nspeak as a man of the world, would only repeat that his mother would\r\nnever consent to the marriage, unless the young couple were to live\r\nalone; nay, he said, with a grain of justice, he thought that had\r\nbeen Sir Harry\'s own view in a former case.  Would he like to see\r\nMrs. Poynsett? she is quite ready.\r\n\r\nAgain Sir Harry quailed at the notion of encountering Mrs. Poynsett;\r\nbut Miles, who had a great idea that his mother could deal with\r\neverybody, and was the better for doing so, would not let him off,\r\nand ushered him in, then stood behind her chair, and thoroughly\r\nenjoyed the grand and yet courteous way in which she reduced to\r\nnothing Sir Harry\'s grand beneficence in eking out the young folks\'\r\nincome with his own.  She knew very well that even when the estate\r\nwas sold, at the highest estimate, Eleonora would have the barest\r\nmaintenance, and that he could hardly expect what the creditors now\r\nallowed him, and she made him understand that she knew this, and\r\nthat she had a right to make conditions, since Frank, like her other\r\nsons, could not enter into possession of his share of his father\'s\r\nfortune unless he married with her consent.\r\n\r\nAnd when he spoke of breaking off the engagement, she was callous,\r\nand said that he must do as he pleased, though after young people\r\nwere grown up, she thought the matter ought to rest with themselves.\r\nShe did not wish her son to marry till his character was more\r\nconfirmed.\r\n\r\nHe went home very angry, and yet crest-fallen, sought out Eleonora,\r\nand informed her of his command, that her engagement should be\r\nbroken off.\r\n\r\n"I do not know how that can be done, papa," said Eleonora.  "We have\r\nnever exactly made an engagement; we do not want to marry at once,\r\nand we could not help loving each other if we tried."\r\n\r\n"Humph!  And if I laid my commands on you never to marry into that\r\nfamily?"\r\n\r\n"I do not think you will do that, papa, after your promise to\r\nCamilla."\r\n\r\nShe had conquered.  No further objection was made to her being as\r\nmuch as she pleased with the Charnocks as long as they remained at\r\nRockpier, nor to her correspondence with Frank when he went away,\r\nnot to solitary lodgings as before, but to the London house, which\r\nMiles and Anne only consented to keep on upon condition of their\r\nmother sharing it with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\nThe Third Autumn\r\n\r\n\r\nA good man ther was of religion,\r\nThat was a poure Persone of a toune;\r\nBut rich he was of holy thought and work,\r\nHe also was a learned man a clerk.--CHAUCER\r\n\r\nAutumn came round again, and brought with it a very different\r\nSeptember from the last.\r\n\r\nWillansborough was in a state of commotion.  That new Vicar had not\r\nonly filled the place with curates, multiplied services in the iron\r\nchurch, and carried on the building of St. Nicholas in a style of\r\nbeauty that was quite affronting to those who were never asked to\r\ncontribute to it, but he gave people no peace in their easy\r\nconventional sins, pricked them in their hearts with personal\r\nindividual stings, and, worse than all, protested against the races,\r\nas conducted at Wil\'sbro\'.\r\n\r\nAnd their Member was just as bad!  Captain Charnock Poynsett,\r\ninstead of subscribing, as part of his duty to his constituents, had\r\nreplied by sending his brother Raymond\'s half-finished letter to the\r\nclub, with an equally strong and resolute one of his own, and had\r\npublished both in all the local papers.\r\n\r\nGreat was the fury and indignation of Wil\'sbro\', Backsworth, and all\r\nthe squires around.  Of course it was a delirious fancy of poor\r\nRaymond Poynsett, and Miles had been worked upon by his puritanical\r\nwife and ritualistic brother to publish it.  Newspapers teemed with\r\nabuse of superstition and pharisaism, and praise of this wholesome,\r\nmoral, and \'truly English\' sport.  Gentlemen, and ladies too, took\r\nthe remonstrance as a personal offence, and threatened to visit no\r\nmore at Compton; the electors bade him look to his seat, and held\r\nmeetings to invite \'Mr. Simmonds Proudfoot,\' as he now called\r\nhimself, to represent them; and the last week, before the races, the\r\nroughs mobbed him in Water Lane.  He rode quietly through them, with\r\nhis sailor face set as if against a storm, but when he was out of\r\nthe place, he stopped his horse at Herbert Bowater\'s lodgings, that\r\nhis black eye might be washed, and the streams of rotten egg removed\r\nfrom his coat before he presented himself at home.  Not that he had\r\nmuch fear of startling his wife and mother.  It was more from the\r\nEnglishman\'s hatred of showing himself a hero, for Anne was\r\nperfectly happy in the persecution he had brought on himself, for\r\nshe never had been so sure before that he was not of the world,\r\nworldly.\r\n\r\nThe races were exceptionally brilliant, and fully attended, but the\r\ntriumph of the roughs had made them more outrageously disgraceful in\r\ntheir conduct than ever; and when Miles went to the quarter-\r\nsessions, rather doubting whether he should not find himself landed\r\nin Coventry, not only did the calendar of offences speak for itself,\r\nbut sundry country gentlemen shook him by the hand, lamenting that\r\nrailways and rowdyism had entirely altered races from what they used\r\nto be, that he was in the right, and what they had seen so recently\r\nproved that the only thing to be done was to withdraw from what\r\nrespectable people could no longer keep within bounds.  Such\r\nwithdrawal will not prevent them, but it will hinder the\r\ndemoralization from being so extensive as formerly, since no one of\r\nmuch character to lose will attend them.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowater rejoiced in Miles\'s triumph.  None of that family had\r\nbeen at these same races.  They had all been much too anxious about\r\nHerbert not to view Ember Week in a very different light from that\r\nin which they had thought of it before.\r\n\r\nLent had brought the junior curate back from Strawyers, not much\r\nmore than a convalescent, but with his sister to look after him, and\r\nboth Rector and senior anxious to spare him; he had gone on well\r\ntill the family returned and resumed Jenny, when he was left to his\r\nown devices, namely, \'all work and no play.\'  He was as fixed as\r\never in his resolution of making this a penance year, and believed\r\nhimself so entirety recovered as to be able to do without\r\nrelaxations.  Cricket, riding, dinners, and garden-parties alike he\r\nhad given up, and divided his time entirely between church and\r\nparish work and study.  Hard reading had never been congenial, and\r\ntook a great deal out of him, and in fact, all his theological study\r\nhad hitherto been little more than task-work, into which he had\r\nnever fully entered, whereas these subjects had now assumed such a\r\nforce, depth, and importance, that he did in truth feel constrained\r\nto go to the very foundation, and work through everything again,\r\nmoved and affected by them in every fibre of his soul, which\r\nvibrated now at what it had merely acquiesced in before.  It was a\r\nphase that had come suddenly on him, when his mind was in full\r\nvigour of development, and his frame and nerves below par, and the\r\neffect could not but be severe.  He was wrapped up in these great\r\nrealities, and seemed to care for no talk, except discussing them\r\nwith Julius or the senior curate, and often treated things of common\r\nlife like the dream that they really are.\r\n\r\nJulius laid as little parish work on him as possible, only, indeed,\r\nwhat seemed actually beneficial by taking him out; but it may be\r\nfeared, that in his present fervid state he was not nearly so\r\nwinning to his young clients as when he was less \'terribly in\r\nearnest,\' although the old women were perhaps more devoted to him,\r\nfrom the tender conviction \'that the poor dear young gentleman would\r\nnot be here long.\'\r\n\r\nFor indeed it was true that he had never advanced in strength or\r\nlooks since his return, but rather lost ground, and thus every\r\nchange of weather, or extra exertion, told on him, till in August he\r\nwas caught in a thunder-storm, and the cold that ensued ran on into\r\na feverish attack, which barely left him in time for the Ordination,\r\nand then with a depressed system, and nerves morbidly sensitive.\r\n\r\nSo sensible (or more than sensible) was he of his deficiencies, that\r\nhe would willingly have held back, and he was hardly well enough to\r\ndo himself justice; but there was no doubt that he would pass, and\r\nit was plain that three more months of the strain of preparation\r\nmight leave permanent effects on his health.\r\n\r\nAs it was, the examining chaplain did not recognize the lean, pale,\r\nanxious man, for the round-faced, rosy, overgrown boy of a year ago.\r\nHis scholarship and critical knowledge were fairly above the mark,\r\nin spite of a racking headache; and his written sermon, together\r\nwith all that was elicited from him, revealed, all unconsciously to\r\nhimself, what treasures he had brought back from the deep waters\r\nwhich had so nearly closed over him.\r\n\r\nSo superior had he shown himself, that he was appointed to read the\r\nGospel, a choice that almost shocked him, knowing that what had made\r\nhim excel had been an experience that the younger men had happily\r\nmissed.  But the mark of approval was compensation to his parents\r\nand sisters for the disappointment of the last year, and the only\r\ndrawback was fear of the effect of the long ceremonial, so deeply\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nHe met them afterwards, very white-faced, with head aching, and\r\nweary almost beyond speech, but with a wonderfully calm, restful\r\nlook on his face, such as reminded Jenny of those first hours of his\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nThey took him home and put him to bed, and there he lay, hardly\r\nspeaking, and generally sleeping.  There he still was on the Monday,\r\nwhen Julius came to inquire after him, and was taken up-stairs at\r\nonce by Jenny, with the greeting, "So the son and heir is come,\r\nJulius?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I never saw my mother more exulting.  When Rosamond ran\r\ndown to tell her, she put her arms round her neck and cried.  She\r\nwho never had a tear through all last year.  I met your father and\r\nmother half-way, and they told me I might come on."\r\n\r\n"I think nothing short of such news would have made mamma leave this\r\nboy," said Jenny; "but she must have her jubilee with Mrs.\r\nPoynsett."\r\n\r\n"And I\'m quite well," said Herbert, who had been grasping Julius\'s\r\nhand, with a wonderful look in his eyes; "yes, really--the doctor\r\nsaid so."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he did," said Jenny, "only he said we were to let him alone,\r\nand that he was not to get up till he felt quite rested."\r\n\r\n"And I shall get up to dinner," said Herbert, so sleepily, that\r\nJulius doubted it.  "I hope to come back before Sunday."\r\n\r\n"What does your doctor say to that?"\r\n\r\n"He says," replied Jenny, "that this gentleman must be rational;\r\nthat he has nothing the matter with him now, but that he is low, and\r\nripe for anything.  Don\'t laugh, you naughty boy, he said you were\r\nripe for anything, and that he must--yes, he _must_--be turned out\r\nto grass somehow or other for the winter, and do nothing at all."\r\n\r\n"I begin to see what you are driving at, Mrs. Joan, you look so\r\ntriumphant."\r\n\r\n"_Yes_," said Jenny, blushing a little, and looking quite young\r\nagain; "I believe poor mamma would be greatly reconciled to it, if\r\nHerbert were to see me out to Natal."\r\n\r\n"Is that to be the way?"\r\n\r\n"It would be very absurd to make Archie come home again for me,"\r\nsaid Jenny.  "And everything else is most happily smoothed for me,\r\nyou know; Edith has come quite to take my place at home; mamma\r\nlearnt to depend on her much more than on me while I was with\r\nHerbert."\r\n\r\n"And it has made her much more of a woman," added Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Then you know that full statement poor Mr. Moy put forth when he\r\nleft the place, on his wife\'s death, quite removed all lingering\r\nhesitation on papa\'s part," added Jenny.\r\n\r\n"It ought, I am sure!" said Julius.\r\n\r\n"So, now, if Herbert will go out with me, it seems to me to be all\r\nright," said Jenny, colouring deeply, as she made this lame and\r\nimpotent conclusion.\r\n\r\n"My father wishes it," said Herbert.  "I believe he meant to see you\r\nto-day to ask leave of absence for me.  That is what he wishes; but\r\nI have made up my mind that I ought to resign the curacy--where I\r\nhave never been any use to you--though, if I had been well, I meant\r\nto have worked a year with you as a priest."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to lose you, but I think you are right.  Your\r\nbeginning with me was a mistake.  There is not enough work for three\r\nof us; but you know Easterby would be delighted to have you at St.\r\nNicholas.  He says his most promising people talk of what you said\r\nto them when they were ill, and he asked me if you could possibly\r\ncome to him."\r\n\r\n"I think it would be better to begin in a new place, further from\r\nhome," said Herbert, quietly.\r\n\r\nAnd both knew what he meant, and how hard it would be to be the\r\nclergyman he had learnt to wish to be, if his mother were at hand to\r\nbe distressed by all he did or did not do.\r\n\r\n"But, any way," added Herbert, "I hope to have some time longer at\r\nCompton before I go.  Next Sunday, if I only _can_."\r\n\r\nHis mind was evidently full of the Feast of the Sunday, and Julius\r\nanswered, "Whichever Sunday you are strong enough, of course, dear\r\nfellow.  You had better come with him, Jenny, and sleep at the\r\nRectory."\r\n\r\n"Oh! thank you.  I should like nothing so much; and I think they\r\nwill spare me that one day."\r\n\r\n"You will come in for a grand gathering, that is, if poor Cecil\r\naccepts.  Miles thinks she ought to be godmother."\r\n\r\n"Oh!"\r\n\r\n"And no one has said a word of any cloud.  It is better he should\r\nknow nothing."\r\n\r\n"And oh! Julius, is it true that her father has bought Sirenwood for\r\nher?"\r\n\r\n"Quite true.  You know it was proposed at first, but the trustees\r\ndoubted of the title; but when all that was cleared up, it turned\r\nout to be a better investment than Swanslea, and so they settled it,\r\nwithout much reference to her."\r\n\r\n"She will let it, of course?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think she will come to the christening?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell; Rose has had one or two very sad letters from her.\r\nShe wanted us very much to come to Dunstone, and was much\r\ndisappointed that we were prevented.  I fancy her heart has turned\r\nto us, and that it is very sore, poor thing."\r\n\r\nJulius was right.  Cecil did return an answer, whose warmth quite\r\namazed all but Miles and Anne, who thought nothing too much for\r\ntheir son; and she gladly came to attend the christening of the\r\nyoung Raymond.  Gladly--yes, she was glad to leave Dunstone.  She\r\nhad gone home weary and sick of her lodging and convalescence, and\r\nhoping to find relief in the home that had once been all-sufficient\r\nfor her, but Dunstone was not changed, and she was.  She had not\r\nbeen able to help outgrowing its narrow opinions and formal\r\nprecisions; and when she came home, crushed with her scarcely\r\nrealized grief, nothing there had power to comfort her.\r\n\r\nThere was soothing at first in her step-mother\'s kindness, and she\r\nreally loved her father; but their petting admiration soon grew\r\noppressive, after the more bracing air of Compton; and their\r\nidolatry of her little brother fretted and tried her all the more,\r\nbecause they thought he must be a comfort to her, and any slight\r\nfrom her might be misconstrued.  Mr. Venn\'s obsequiousness, instead\r\nof rightful homage, seemed deprivation of support, and she saw no\r\none, spoke to no one, without the sense of Raymond\'s vast\r\nsuperiority and her own insensibility to it, loving him a thousand\r\ntimes more than she had loved him in life, and mourning him with an\r\nanguish beyond what the most perfect union would have left.  She had\r\nnothing to do.  Self-improvement was a mere oppression, and she\r\nlonged after nothing so much as the sight of Rosamond, Anne, Julius,\r\nor even Frank, and her amiable wishes prevailed to have them invited\r\nto Dunstone; but at the times specified there were hindrances.  Anne\r\nhad engagements at home, and Rosamond appeared to the rest of the\r\nfamily to be a perpetual refuge for stray De Lanceys, while Frank\r\nhad to make up for his long enforced absence by a long unbroken\r\nspell of work.\r\n\r\nCecil therefore had seen none of the family till she arrived at\r\nCompton.  She was perfectly well, she said, and had become a great\r\nwalker, and so, indeed, she showed herself, for she went out\r\ndirectly after breakfast every morning, and never appeared again\r\ntill luncheon time; and would take long rides in the afternoon.  "It\r\nwas her only chance of sleep," she said, when remonstrated with.\r\nShe did not look ill, but there was a restless, worn air that was\r\nvery distressing on her young features, and was the more piteous to\r\nher relations, that she was just as constrained as ever in her\r\nintercourse with them.  She was eagerly attentive to Mrs. Poynsett,\r\nand evidently so anxious to wait on her that Anne left to her many\r\nlittle services, but if they were alone together, they were tongue-\r\ntied, and never went deeper than surface subjects.  Mrs. Poynsett\r\nnever discussed her, never criticized her, never attempted to fathom\r\nher, being probably convinced that there was nothing but hard\r\ncoldness to be met with by probing.  Yet there was something\r\nstriking in Cecil\'s having made people call her Mrs. Raymond\r\nPoynsett, surrendering the Charnock, which she had once brandished\r\nin all their faces, and going by the name by which her husband had\r\nbeen best known.\r\n\r\nTo Anne she was passively friendly, and neither gave nor sought\r\nconfidences, and Anne was so much occupied with her baby, and all\r\nthe little household services that had grown on her, as well as with\r\nher busy husband, that there was little leisure for them; and though\r\nthe meeting with Rosamond was at first the most effusive and\r\naffectionate of all, afterwards she seemed to avoid tetes-a-tetes\r\nwith her, and was shyer with her than with Anne.\r\n\r\nIt was Miles that she got on with best.  He had never so fully\r\nrealized the unhappiness of his brother\'s married life as those who\r\nhad watched it; and he simply viewed her as Raymond\'s loved and\r\nloving widow and sincere mourner, and treated her with all brotherly\r\ntenderness and reverence for her grief; while she responded with a\r\ncordiality and gratitude which made her, when talking to him, a\r\npleasanter person than she had ever been seen at Compton before.\r\n\r\nBut it was not to Miles, but to Rosamond, that she brought an\r\nearnest question, walking in one autumn morning to the Rectory, amid\r\nthe falling leaves of the Virginian-creeper, and amazing Rosamond,\r\nwho was writing against time for the Indian mail, by asking--\r\n\r\n"Rosamond, will you find out if Mrs. Poynsett would mind my coming\r\nto live at Sirenwood?"\r\n\r\n"You, Cecil!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m old enough.  There\'s no place for me at home, and though I\r\nmust be miserable anywhere, it will be better where I have something\r\nto do, of some real use to somebody.  I\'ve been walking all round\r\nevery day, and seeing what a state it is in--in the hands of\r\ncreditors all these years."\r\n\r\n"But you would be quite alone!"\r\n\r\n"I am quite alone as it is."\r\n\r\n"And would your father consent?"\r\n\r\n"I think he would.  I am a burthen to them now.  They cannot feel my\r\ngrief, nor comfort it, and they don\'t like the sight of it, though I\r\nam sure I trouble them with it as little as possible."\r\n\r\n"Dear Cecil!" and the ready tears welled up in Rosamond\'s gray eyes.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to talk of it," said Cecil.  "If I felt worthy to\r\ngrieve it would be less dreadful; but it all seems like hypocrisy.\r\nRosamond, if you were to lose Julius to-morrow, you would not be as\r\nunhappy as I am."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, don\'t!" cried Rosamond, making a gesture of horror.  "But\r\ndoes not coming here make it worse?"\r\n\r\n"No, real stabs are better than dull aching; and then you--you,\r\nRosamond, did know how it really was, and that I would--I would--"\r\n\r\nCecil wept now as Rosamond had longed to see her weep when she had\r\nleft Compton, and Rosamond spoke from her tender heart of comfort;\r\nbut the outburst did not last long, and Cecil said, recovering\r\nherself--\r\n\r\n"After all, my most peaceful times of late have been in walking\r\nabout in those woods at Sirenwood; I should like to live there.  You\r\nknow _he_ always wished it to be the purchase, because it joins\r\nCompton, and I should like to get it all into perfect order and\r\nbeauty, and leave it all to little Raymond."\r\n\r\n"I should have thought the place would have been full of ghosts."\r\n\r\n"I tried.  I made the woman let me in, and I sat where poor Camilla\r\nused to talk to me, and I thought I was the better for facing it\r\nout.  The question is whether Mrs. Poynsett will dislike it.  She\r\nhas a right to be consulted."\r\n\r\nPerhaps Cecil could not be gracious.  Certainly, Raymond would have\r\nbeen thankful for even this admission.\r\n\r\n"You wish me to find out?"\r\n\r\n"If you would be so good.  I would give it up at once if she has any\r\nfeeling against it, and go somewhere else--and of course she has!\r\nShe never can forget what I did!"\r\n\r\nRosamond caressed Cecil with that sweetness which saw everything in\r\nthe most consoling manner; but when the poor young widow was out of\r\nsight, there was a revulsion of feeling.\r\n\r\n"No, Mrs Poynsett must always feel that that wretched marriage broke\r\nher son\'s heart, and murdered him!--murdered him!" said Rosamond to\r\nherself, clenching that soft fist of hers.  "It ought not to be\r\nbroached to her!"\r\n\r\nBut Julius--when she stated it to him rather less broadly, but still\r\nsaying that she did not know whether she could bear the sight of\r\nCecil, except when she was before her eyes, and how could his mother\r\nendure her at all--did not see it in the same light.  He thought\r\nSirenwood gave duties to Cecil, and that she ought not to be\r\nhindered from fulfilling them.  And he said his mother was a large-\r\nminded woman, and not likely to have that personal bitterness\r\ntowards Cecil that both the ladies seemed to expect, as her rival in\r\nher son\'s affections, and the means of his unhappiness and death.\r\n\r\nHe was right; Mrs. Poynsett was touched by finding that Cecil clung\r\nto them rather than to her sublime family, and especially by the\r\ndesign as to little Raymond, though she said that must never be\r\nmentioned; nothing must bind so young a creature as Cecil, who\r\nreally did not know what love was at all.\r\n\r\n"She is afraid the sight of her is distressing to you," said\r\nRosamond.\r\n\r\n"Poor child, why should she?" said Mrs. Poynsett.  "She was the\r\nvictim of an unsuccessful experiment of my dear boy\'s, and the\r\nunsuspecting instrument of poor Camilla\'s vengeance.  That is all I\r\nsee in her."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Poynsett, how can you!" cried Rosamond, impetuously.  "With\r\nall I know of her sorrow, I rage at her whenever I am out of sight\r\nof her."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t do that," said Mrs. Poynsett, half smiling, "any more than\r\nI could at a doll.  The poor thing was in a false position, and\r\nnobody was more sorry for her than Raymond himself; but you see he\r\nhad fancied that marriage must bring the one thing it would not in\r\nthat short time."\r\n\r\n"It would, if she had not been a little foolish donkey."\r\n\r\n"Or if Camilla Tyrrell had let her alone!  It is of no use to rake\r\nup these things, my dear Rosamond.  Let her come to Sirenwood, and\r\ndo such good as she can there, if it can comfort her.  It was for my\r\nsake that the unconscious girl was brought here to have her life\r\nspoilt, and I would not stand in the way of what seems to be any\r\nrelief."\r\n\r\n"But is it no pain?" persisted Rosamond.\r\n\r\n"No, my dear.  I almost wish it was.  I shall never get on with her;\r\nbut I am glad she should come and be near you all; and Miles likes\r\nher."\r\n\r\nMr. Charnock demurred at first, and wanted to saddle Cecil with her\r\nold governess as a companion, but when he found that Mrs. Poynsett\r\nand Miles made no objection, and remembered that she would be under\r\ntheir wing, and would be an inestimable adviser and example to Anne,\r\nhe consented; and Cecil\'s arrangements were made with startling\r\nrapidity, so that she was in possession before Christmas, which she\r\ninsisted on spending there.  Dunstone had stereotyped hospitalities,\r\nwhich she could not bear, and would not prevent, and now that her\r\nfirst year of widowhood was over, the sorrow was not respected,\r\nwhile it seemed to her more oppressive than ever.\r\n\r\nSo there she was in vehement activity; restless rather than\r\nreligious in her beneficence still, though the lesson she had had\r\nshowed itself in her constantly seeking the advice of Miles, who\r\nthought her the most sensible woman in the world, except his Nan.\r\nWhether this constant occupation, furnishing, repairing, planning,\r\nbeautifying her model cottages, her school chapel, and all the rest,\r\nwere lessening the heartache, no one knew, but the sharp black eyes\r\nlooked as dry and hard, the lines round the mouth as weary as ever;\r\nand Rosamond sometimes thought if Sirenwood were not full of ghosts\r\nto her, she was much like a ghost herself who came\r\n\r\n"Hovering around her ancient home,\r\n   To find no refuge there."\r\n\r\nThere was another who could not help seeing her somewhat in that\r\nlight, and this was Eleonora Vivian, who had come to Compton to be\r\nwith Frank, when he was at last able to enjoy a well-earned holiday,\r\nand with ears restored to their natural powers, though he always\r\ndeclared that his eight months of deafness had done him more good\r\nthan anything that had ever befallen him in his life.  It had thrown\r\nhim in on his real self, and broken all the unfortunate associations\r\nof his first year in London.  His first few months, while he was\r\nstill in need of care, had been spent with Miles and Anne, and that\r\ntender ministry to him which his sister-in-law had begun in his\r\nillness had been with him when he was tired, dispirited, or beset by\r\nthe trials of a tardy convalescence.  As his interpreter, too, and\r\ncaterer for the pleasures his infirmity allowed, Anne had been\r\neducating herself to a degree that \'self\' improvement never would\r\nhave induced.\r\n\r\nAnd when left alone in London, he was able to take care of himself\r\nin all ways, and had followed the real leadings of his disposition,\r\nwhich his misdirected courtship had interrupted for the time,\r\nreturning to the intellectual pursuits which were likely to be\r\nbeneficial, not only as pleasures, but in an economical point of\r\nview; and he was half shy, half proud of the profits, such as they\r\nwere, of a few poems and essays which he certainly had not had it in\r\nhim to write before the ordeal he had undergone.\r\n\r\nEleonora\'s elder sister, Mrs. Fanshaw, had come home from India with\r\nher husband, newly made a Major-General.  Frank had gone to Rockpier\r\nearly in January, to be introduced to them, and after spending a day\r\nor two there, to escort Lena to Compton.  Mrs. Poynsett needed but\r\none glance to assure her that the two were happier than their wooing\r\nhad ever made them before, save in that one brief moment at Cecil\'s\r\nparty.  Eleonora looked more beautiful, and the look of wistful pain\r\nhad left her brow, but it had made permanent lines there, as well\r\nhad seemed likely, and though her laugh would never have the abandon\r\nof Rosamond\'s, still it was not so very rare, and though she was\r\nstill like a beautiful night, it was a bright moonlight one.\r\n\r\nA few private interviews made the cause of the change apparent.  The\r\nsister, Mary Fanshaw, had something of Camilla\'s dexterity, but\r\nhaving been early married to a good man, she had found its use\r\ninstead of its abuse; and though Lena\'s trust had come very slowly,\r\nshe had given it at last, and saw that her elders could deal with\r\nher father as she could never do.  Sir Harry respected the General\r\nenough to let himself be restrained by him, and the husband and wife\r\nwere ready to take the charge--removing, however, from Rockpier, for\r\nthe religious atmosphere of which they were unprepared, and which\r\nGeneral Fanshaw thought very dull.  Affairs were in course of being\r\nwound up on the sale of Sirenwood, and the General had talked to\r\nFrank, as one of the family, in a way that had proved to him his own\r\nmanhood more than anything that had happened to him.  Out of the\r\nwreck, nothing remained to the old man, and the portion which had\r\nbeen secured by the mother\'s marriage settlements to younger\r\nchildren, though hitherto out of reach, was felt by the daughters to\r\nbe due to the creditors, so that only two thousand pounds apiece had\r\nbeen secured to each of them; and this the General consulted Frank\r\nabout appropriating for Sir Harry\'s use during his lifetime, himself\r\nretaining the management, so as to secure the attendance of the\r\nfavourite valet, the keeping of a horse, and a fair amount of menus\r\nplaisirs.\r\n\r\nIt was also made plain to Frank that Lena\'s filial duties and\r\nscruples need no longer stand in the way of the marriage.  Mrs.\r\nFanshaw had two girls almost come out, and perhaps she did not wish\r\nthem to be overshadowed by the aunt, who, however retiring, could\r\nnot help being much more beautiful.  So all that remained was that\r\nMrs. Poynsett should be willing to supplement Frank\'s official\r\nincome with his future portion.  She was all the more rejoiced, as\r\nthis visit showed her for the first time what Lena really was when\r\nbrought into the sunshine without dread of what she might hear or\r\nsee, or of harm being done by her belongings; and her gratitude for\r\nthe welcome with which she was received was most touching.\r\n\r\nThe rest of her family were in course of removing to their new home,\r\nwhere Mrs. Fanshaw would be mistress of the house, and so Eleonora\'s\r\nstay at Compton was prolonged till the general migration to London,\r\nwhich was put off till Easter.  Just before this, Herbert Bowater\r\ncame back from Natal, and walked from Strawyers with all his happy\r\ndogs, as strong and hearty and as merry as ever; his boyish outlines\r\ngone, but wholesome sunburn having taken the place of his rosiness,\r\nand his bonny smile with its old joyousness.  He had married Jenny\r\nand Archie himself, and stayed a month on their ostrich farm, which\r\nhe declared was a lesson on woman\'s rights, since Mrs. Ostrich was\r\nheedless and indifferent as to her eggs, but was regularly hunted\r\nback to the duties by her husband, who always had two wives, and\r\nregularly forced them to take turns in sitting; a system which\r\nHerbert observed would be needful if the rights of women were to\r\nwork.  He had brought offerings of eggs and feathers to Lady\r\nRosamond, and pockets full of curiosities for all his village\r\nfriends; also, he had been at the Cape, had seen Glen Fraser,\r\nrejoiced the inhabitants with his accounts of Anne, and brought home\r\na delightful budget for her.\r\n\r\nBut the special cause of his radiance was a letter he brought from\r\nhis father to Mr. Bindon.  The family living, which had decided his\r\nown profession, had fallen vacant, and his father, wishing perhaps\r\nnot to be thought cruel and unnatural by his wife, had made no\r\nappointment until Herbert\'s return, well knowing that he would\r\ndecide against himself:  and feeling that, as things stood, it would\r\nbe an awkward exercise of patronage to put him in at once.  Herbert\r\nhad declared that nothing would have induced him to accept what he\r\npersuaded his father to let him offer to James Bindon, whom he had\r\nfound to have an old mother in great need of the comfortable home,\r\nwhich, without interest, or any talent save for hard work, he could\r\nscarcely hope to secure to her.\r\n\r\n"And you, Herbert," said Julius, "can I ask you to come back to me,\r\nnow that we shall have a fair amount to do between us?"\r\n\r\nHerbert smiled and shook his head, as he took out an advertisement\r\nfor a curate in one of the blackest parishes of the Black Country.\r\n"I\'ve written to answer that," he said.\r\n\r\nJulius did not try to hinder him.  What had been exaggerated had\r\nparsed away, and he was now a brave man going forth in his strength\r\nand youth to the service he had learnt to understand; able still\r\nkeenly to enjoy, but only using pleasure as an incidental episode\r\nfor the delight of others, and as subordinate to the true work of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nHe asked for his fellow-worker, Mrs. Duncombe.  There were tidings,\r\nbut disappointing ones.  She had written a long letter to Julius,\r\nfull of her reasons for being received into the Roman Communion,\r\nwhere she rapturously declared she had for the first time found\r\npeace.  Anne and Rosamond took the change most bitterly to heart,\r\nbut Julius, though believing he could have saved her from the\r\nschism, by showing her the true beauty and efficiency of her own\r\nChurch, could not wonder at this effect of foreign influences on one\r\nso recently and imperfectly taught, and whose ardent nature required\r\nstrong forms of whatever she took up.  And the letters she continued\r\nto write to Julius were rapturous in the cause of the Pope and as to\r\nall that she had once most contemned.  She had taken her children\r\nwith her, but her husband remained tolerant, indifferent, and so\r\nprobably he would do while his health lasted.\r\n\r\nEarly in the summer Frank and Eleonora were married, and a pretty\r\nlittle house in the outskirts of London found for them, suiting with\r\nthe grace of the one and the poetry of the other.  It was a small,\r\nquiet household, but could pleasantly receive those literary friends\r\nof Frank\'s whom he delighted to present to his beautiful and\r\nappreciative wife, whose sweetness and brightness grew every day\r\nunder the influence of affection and confidence.  The other augury\r\nof poor Lady Tyrrell, that their holidays would be spent at Compton\r\nHall, was fulfilled, but very pleasantly for both parties, for it\r\nwas as much home to Lena as to Frank.\r\n\r\nMiles\'s geniality made all at ease that came near him, and Anne,\r\nthough never a conversational person, was a quietly kind hostess,\r\nmuch beloved by all who had experienced her gentleness, and she had\r\nFrank and Lena to give distinction in their different ways to her\r\nLondon parties, as at Compton, Rosamond never failed to give\r\neverything a charm where she assisted in planning or receiving.\r\n\r\nRosamond would never cease to love society.  Even had she been a\r\ngrandmother she would have fired at the notion of a party, enjoy,\r\nand render it enjoyable; and the mere announcement of a new face\r\nwould be as stimulating to her as it was the reverse to Anne.  But\r\nshe had grown into such union with her husband, and had so forgotten\r\nthe Rathforlane defence, as to learn that it was pleasanter to do as\r\nhe liked than to try to make him like what she did, and a look of\r\ndisapproval from him would open her eyes to the flaws in any scheme,\r\nhowever enchanting at first.\r\n\r\nShe was too necessary an element in all hospitalities of Cecil or of\r\nAnne not to get quite as much diversion as so thorough a wife and\r\nmother could find time for, since Julia did not remain by any means\r\nan only child, and besides her permanent charge of Terence, relays\r\nof De Lanceys were constantly casting up at the Rectory for\r\nmothering in some form or other.\r\n\r\nCecil depended on her more than on any one else for sympathy, not\r\nexpressly in feeling, but in all her pursuits.  In three years\' time\r\nSirenwood was in perfect order, the once desolate garden blazed with\r\nribbons, triangles and pattipans of verbena, scarlet geranium and\r\ncalceolaria, with intervals of echiverias, pronounced by Tom to be\r\nlike cabbages trying to turn into copper kettles; her foliage plants\r\ngot all the prizes at horticultural shows, her poultry were\r\nincomparable at their exhibitions, her cottages were models, her\r\nschool machinery perfect, and if a pattern in farming apparatus were\r\nwanted, people went to Mrs. Raymond Poynsett\'s steward.  She had\r\npeople of note to stay with her every winter, went to London for the\r\nseason, and was made much of, and all the time she looked as little,\r\nand pinched, and weary, and heart-hungered as ever, and never seemed\r\nto thaw or warm, clinging to no one but to Miles for counsel, and to\r\nRosamond for the fellow-feeling it was not always easy to give--when\r\nit was apparently only about an orchid or a churn--and yet Rosamond\r\ntried, for she knew it was starvation for sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe Charnock world murmured a little when, after a succession of De\r\nLancey visitors for four months, the Rectory was invaded by\r\nRosamond\'s eldest brother, Lord Ballybrehon, always the most hair-\r\nbrained of the family, and now invalided home in consequence of a\r\nconcussion of the brain while pigsticking in India.  He was but a\r\nyear older than Rosamond, and her favourite of all, whose scrapes\r\nshe had shared, befriended, defended, and scolded in turn, very\r\nhandsome, very lazily daring, droll and mischievous, a sort of\r\nconcentration of all the other De Lanceys.  His sister loved him\r\npassionately, he fascinated the Rector, and little Julia was the\r\nadorer of Uncle Bally.\r\n\r\nBut Rosamond was rather aghast to find Bally making such love as\r\nonly an Irishman could do to the prim little widow at Sirenwood,\r\ndismayed and a little bit ashamed of her unspoken conviction that\r\nBally, after all his wild freaks and frolics, had come to have an\r\neye to the needs of the Rathforlane property; and what were her\r\nfeelings when, instead of finding the wild Irishman contemned, she\r\nperceived that he was believed in and met fully half way?  The\r\nstiffness melted, the eyes softened and sparkled, the lips parted in\r\nsoft agitated smiles, the cheeks learnt to blush, and Cecil was\r\nabsolutely and thoroughly in love!\r\n\r\nYes, she had found her heart and was won--won in spite of the\r\nDunstone dislike to the beggarly title--in spite of Miles\'s well-\r\nconsidered cautions--in spite of all her original self.  And if\r\nBallybrehon began from mere desire to try for the well-endowed\r\nwidow, he had the warm loving nature that was sure to kindle and\r\nreciprocate the affection he evoked, enough to make him a kind\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, could any one have wished Cecil Poynsett a more trying life\r\nthan one of her disposition must needs have with impetuous,\r\nunpunctual, uncertain, scatter-brained, open-handed Ballybrehon,\r\nalways in a scramble, always inviting guests upon guests without\r\nclassification, and never remembering whom he had invited!\r\n\r\nRosamond herself declared she should be either in a rage or worn to\r\nfritters by a month of it.  How Cecil liked it never appeared.  Some\r\nthought that they squabbled and worried each other in private, but\r\nit is certain that, as Terry said, Bally had turned the block into\r\nliving flesh and blood, and Lady Ballybrehon was wondrously\r\nlivelier, brighter, and sweeter ever since she had been entirely\r\nconquered by the tyrant love, and had ceased to be the slave of her\r\nown way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE THREE BRIDES***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 12485.txt or 12485.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/1/2/4/8/12485\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\'s\r\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\r\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\r\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\r\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\r\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\r\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\r\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\r\ndownload by the etext year.\r\n\r\nhttps://gutenberg.org/etext06\r\n\r\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\r\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\r\n\r\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\r\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\r\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\r\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\r\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\r\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\r\n\r\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689\r\n\r\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL\r\n\r\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\r\n'
