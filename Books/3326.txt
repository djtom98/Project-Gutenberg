Fancies, like\r\ncertain soft-wooded plants which cannot bear the silent inland frosts,\r\nbut thrive by the sea in the roughest of weather, seem to grow up\r\nnaturally here, in particular amongst those natives who have no active\r\nconcern in the labours of the \xe2\x80\x98Isle.\xe2\x80\x99 Hence it is a spot apt to generate\r\na type of personage like the character imperfectly sketched in these\r\npages--a native of natives--whom some may choose to call a fantast (if\r\nthey honour him with their consideration so far), but whom others may\r\nsee only as one that gave objective continuity and a name to a delicate\r\ndream which in a vaguer form is more or less common to all men, and is\r\nby no means new to Platonic philosophers.\r\n\r\nTo those who know the rocky coign of England here depicted--overlooking\r\nthe great Channel Highway with all its suggestiveness, and standing out\r\nso far into mid-sea that touches of the Gulf Stream soften the air till\r\nFebruary--it is matter of surprise that the place has not been more\r\nfrequently chosen as the retreat of artists and poets in search of\r\ninspiration--for at least a month or two in the year, the tempestuous\r\nrather than the fine seasons by preference. To be sure, one nook therein\r\nis the retreat, at their country\xe2\x80\x99s expense, of other geniuses from a\r\ndistance; but their presence is hardly discoverable. Yet perhaps it\r\nis as well that the artistic visitors do not come, or no more would be\r\nheard of little freehold houses being bought and sold there for a couple\r\nof hundred pounds--built of solid stone, and dating from the sixteenth\r\ncentury and earlier, with mullions, copings, and corbels complete. These\r\ntransactions, by the way, are carried out and covenanted, or were till\r\nlately, in the parish church, in the face of the congregation, such\r\nbeing the ancient custom of the Isle.\r\n\r\nAs for the story itself, it may be worth while to remark that, differing\r\nfrom all or most others of the series in that the interest aimed at\r\nis of an ideal or subjective nature, and frankly imaginative,\r\nverisimilitude in the sequence of events has been subordinated to the\r\nsaid aim.\r\n\r\nThe first publication of this tale in an independent form was in 1897;\r\nbut it had appeared in the periodical press in 1892, under the title of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Pursuit of the Well-Beloved.\xe2\x80\x99 A few chapters of that experimental\r\nissue were rewritten for the present and final form of the narrative.\r\n\r\nT.

CRASHAW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. I. A SUPPOSITITIOUS PRESENTMENT OF HER\r\n\r\nA person who differed from the local wayfarers was climbing the steep\r\nroad which leads through the sea-skirted townlet definable as the Street\r\nof Wells, and forms a pass into that Gibraltar of Wessex, the singular\r\npeninsula once an island, and still called such, that stretches out like\r\nthe head of a bird into the English Channel. It is connected with the\r\nmainland by a long thin neck of pebbles \xe2\x80\x98cast up by rages of the se,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand unparalleled in its kind in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe pedestrian was what he looked like--a young man from London and the\r\ncities of the Continent. Nobody could see at present that his urbanism\r\nsat upon him only as a garment. He was just recollecting with something\r\nof self-reproach that a whole three years and eight months had flown\r\nsince he paid his last visit to his father at this lonely rock of his\r\nbirthplace, the intervening time having been spent amid many contrasting\r\nsocieties, peoples, manners, and scenes.\r\n\r\nWhat had seemed usual in the isle when he lived there always looked\r\nquaint and odd after his later impressions. More than ever the spot\r\nseemed what it was said once to have been, the ancient Vindilia Island,\r\nand the Home of the Slingers. The towering rock, the houses above\r\nhouses, one man\xe2\x80\x99s doorstep rising behind his neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s chimney,\r\nthe gardens hung up by one edge to the sky, the vegetables growing on\r\napparently almost vertical planes, the unity of the whole island as\r\na solid and single block of limestone four miles long, were no longer\r\nfamiliar and commonplace ideas. All now stood dazzlingly unique\r\nand white against the tinted sea, and the sun flashed on infinitely\r\nstratified walls of oolite,\r\n\r\n                The melancholy ruins\r\n      Of cancelled cycles,...\r\n\r\nwith a distinctiveness that called the eyes to it as strongly as any\r\nspectacle he had beheld afar.\r\n\r\nAfter a laborious clamber he reached the top, and walked along the\r\nplateau towards the eastern village. The time being about two o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\nin the middle of the summer season, the road was glaring and dusty, and\r\ndrawing near to his father\xe2\x80\x99s house he sat down in the sun.\r\n\r\nHe stretched out his hand upon the rock beside him. It felt warm. That\r\nwas the island\xe2\x80\x99s personal temperature when in its afternoon sleep as\r\nnow. He listened, and heard sounds: whirr-whirr, saw-saw-saw. Those were\r\nthe island\xe2\x80\x99s snores--the noises of the quarrymen and stone-sawyers.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the spot on which he sat was a roomy cottage or homestead.\r\nLike the island it was all of stone, not only in walls but in\r\nwindow-frames, roof, chimneys, fence, stile, pigsty and stable, almost\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nHe remembered who had used to live there--and probably lived there\r\nnow--the Caro family; the \xe2\x80\x98roan-mare\xe2\x80\x99 Caros, as they were called to\r\ndistinguish them from other branches of the same pedigree, there being\r\nbut half-a-dozen Christian and surnames in the whole island. He crossed\r\nthe road and looked in at the open doorway. Yes, there they were still.\r\n\r\nMrs. Caro, who had seen him from the window, met him in the entry, and\r\nan old-fashioned greeting took place between them. A moment after a\r\ndoor leading from the back rooms was thrown open, and a young girl about\r\nseventeen or eighteen came bounding in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, \xe2\x80\x98TIS dear Joce!\xe2\x80\x99 she burst out joyfully. And running up to the\r\nyoung man, she kissed him.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration was sweet enough from the owner of such an\r\naffectionate pair of bright hazel eyes and brown tresses of hair. But it\r\nwas so sudden, so unexpected by a man fresh from towns, that he winced\r\nfor a moment quite involuntarily; and there was some constraint in the\r\nmanner in which he returned her kiss, and said, \xe2\x80\x98My pretty little Avice,\r\nhow do you do after so long?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds her impulsive innocence hardly noticed his start of\r\nsurprise; but Mrs. Caro, the girl\xe2\x80\x99s mother, had observed it instantly.\r\nWith a pained flush she turned to her daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Avice--my dear Avice! Why--what are you doing? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve grown up to be a woman since Jocelyn--Mr. Pierston--was last down\r\nhere? Of course you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t do now as you used to do three or four years\r\nago!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe awkwardness which had arisen was hardly removed by Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassurance that he quite expected her to keep up the practice of her\r\nchildhood, followed by several minutes of conversation on general\r\nsubjects. He was vexed from his soul that his unaware movement should so\r\nhave betrayed him. At his leaving he repeated that if Avice regarded him\r\notherwise than as she used to do he would never forgive her; but though\r\nthey parted good friends her regret at the incident was visible in her\r\nface. Jocelyn passed out into the road and onward to his father\xe2\x80\x99s house\r\nhard by. The mother and daughter were left alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was quite amazed at \xe2\x80\x98ee, my child!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the elder. \xe2\x80\x98A young\r\nman from London and foreign cities, used now to the strictest company\r\nmanners, and ladies who almost think it vulgar to smile broad! How could\r\nye do it, Avice?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think about how I was altered!\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nconscience-stricken girl. \xe2\x80\x98I used to kiss him, and he used to kiss me\r\nbefore he went away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But that was years ago, my dear!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes, and for the moment I forgot! He seemed just the same to me as he\r\nused to be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped now. You must be careful in the future. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot lots of young women, I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant, and has few thoughts left for\r\nyou. He\xe2\x80\x99s what they call a sculptor, and he means to be a great genius\r\nin that line some day, they do say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it; and it can\xe2\x80\x99t be mended!\xe2\x80\x99 moaned the girl.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Jocelyn Pierston, the sculptor of budding fame, had gone\r\nonward to the house of his father, an inartistic man of trade and\r\ncommerce merely, from whom, nevertheless, Jocelyn condescended to accept\r\na yearly allowance pending the famous days to come. But the elder,\r\nhaving received no warning of his son\xe2\x80\x99s intended visit, was not at home\r\nto receive him. Jocelyn looked round the familiar premises, glanced\r\nacross the Common at the great yards within which eternal saws were\r\ngoing to and fro upon eternal blocks of stone--the very same saws and\r\nthe very same blocks that he had seen there when last in the island,\r\nso it seemed to him--and then passed through the dwelling into the back\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nLike all the gardens in the isle it was surrounded by a wall of\r\ndry-jointed spawls, and at its further extremity it ran out into a\r\ncorner, which adjoined the garden of the Caros. He had no sooner reached\r\nthis spot than he became aware of a murmuring and sobbing on the other\r\nside of the wall. The voice he recognized in a moment as Avice\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nshe seemed to be confiding her trouble to some young friend of her own\r\nsex.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, what shall I DO! what SHALL I do!\xe2\x80\x99 she was saying bitterly. \xe2\x80\x98So\r\nbold as it was--so shameless! How could I think of such a thing! He will\r\nnever forgive me--never, never like me again! He\xe2\x80\x99ll think me a forward\r\nhussy, and yet--and yet I quite forgot how much I had grown. But that\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll never believe!\xe2\x80\x99 The accents were those of one who had for the\r\nfirst time become conscious of her womanhood, as an unwonted possession\r\nwhich shamed and frightened her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did he seem angry at it?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no--not angry! Worse. Cold and haughty. O, he\xe2\x80\x99s such a fashionable\r\nperson now--not at all an island man. But there\xe2\x80\x99s no use in talking of\r\nit. I wish I was dead!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston retreated as quickly as he could. He grieved at the incident\r\nwhich had brought such pain to this innocent soul; and yet it was\r\nbeginning to be a source of vague pleasure to him. He returned to the\r\nhouse, and when his father had come back and welcomed him, and they\r\nhad shared a meal together, Jocelyn again went out, full of an earnest\r\ndesire to soothe his young neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow in a way she little\r\nexpected; though, to tell the truth, his affection for her was rather\r\nthat of a friend than of a lover, and he felt by no means sure that the\r\nmigratory, elusive idealization he called his Love who, ever since\r\nhis boyhood, had flitted from human shell to human shell an indefinite\r\nnumber of times, was going to take up her abode in the body of Avice\r\nCaro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. II. THE INCARNATION IS ASSUMED TO BE TRUE\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to meet her again, even though on this lump of rock the\r\ndifficulty lay as a rule rather in avoidance than in meeting. But Avice\r\nhad been transformed into a very different kind of young woman by\r\nthe self-consciousness engendered of her impulsive greeting, and,\r\nnotwithstanding their near neighbourhood, he could not encounter her,\r\ntry as he would. No sooner did he appear an inch beyond his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoor than she was to earth like a fox; she bolted upstairs to her room.\r\n\r\nAnxious to soothe her after his unintentional slight he could not\r\nstand these evasions long. The manners of the isle were primitive and\r\nstraightforward, even among the well-to-do, and noting her disappearance\r\none day he followed her into the house and onward to the foot of the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Avice!\xe2\x80\x99 he called.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Mr. Pierston.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why do you run upstairs like that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh--only because I wanted to come up for something.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got it, can\xe2\x80\x99t you come down again?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t very well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, DEAR Avice. That\xe2\x80\x99s what you are, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was no response.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, if you won\xe2\x80\x99t, you won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 he continued. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to bother\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99 And Pierston went away.\r\n\r\nHe was stopping to look at the old-fashioned flowers under the garden\r\nwalls when he heard a voice behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pierston--I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t angry with you. When you were gone I\r\nthought--you might mistake me, and I felt I could do no less than come\r\nand assure you of my friendship still.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTurning he saw the blushing Avice immediately behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a good, dear girl!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, and, seizing her hand, set upon\r\nher cheek the kind of kiss that should have been the response to hers on\r\nthe day of his coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Darling Avice, forgive me for the slight that day! Say you do. Come,\r\nnow! And then I\xe2\x80\x99ll say to you what I have never said to any other woman,\r\nliving or dead: \xe2\x80\x9cWill you have me as your husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!--mother says I am only one of many!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are not, dear. You knew me when I was young, and others didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomehow or other her objections were got over, and though she did not\r\ngive an immediate assent, she agreed to meet him later in the afternoon,\r\nwhen she walked with him to the southern point of the island called the\r\nBeal, or, by strangers, the Bill, pausing over the treacherous cavern\r\nknown as Cave Hole, into which the sea roared and splashed now as it had\r\ndone when they visited it together as children. To steady herself while\r\nlooking in he offered her his arm, and she took it, for the first time\r\nas a woman, for the hundredth time as his companion.\r\n\r\nThey rambled on to the lighthouse, where they would have lingered longer\r\nif Avice had not suddenly remembered an engagement to recite poetry\r\nfrom a platform that very evening at the Street of Wells, the village\r\ncommanding the entrance to the island--the village that has now advanced\r\nto be a town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Recite!\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99d have thought anybody or anything could recite\r\ndown here except the reciter we hear away there--the never speechless\r\nsea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O but we are quite intellectual now. In the winter particularly. But,\r\nJocelyn--don\xe2\x80\x99t come to the recitation, will you? It would spoil my\r\nperformance if you were there, and I want to be as good as the rest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t if you really wish me not to. But I shall meet you at the door\r\nand bring you home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, looking up into his face. Avice was perfectly happy\r\nnow; she could never have believed on that mortifying day of his coming\r\nthat she would be so happy with him. When they reached the east side of\r\nthe isle they parted, that she might be soon enough to take her place on\r\nthe platform. Pierston went home, and after dark, when it was about the\r\nhour for accompanying her back, he went along the middle road northward\r\nto the Street of Wells.\r\n\r\nHe was full of misgiving. He had known Avice Caro so well of old that\r\nhis feeling for her now was rather comradeship than love; and what he\r\nhad said to her in a moment of impulse that morning rather appalled\r\nhim in its consequences. Not that any of the more sophisticated and\r\naccomplished women who had attracted him successively would be likely to\r\nrise inconveniently between them. For he had quite disabused his mind\r\nof the assumption that the idol of his fancy was an integral part of the\r\npersonality in which it had sojourned for a long or a short while.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nTo his Well-Beloved he had always been faithful; but she had had many\r\nembodiments. Each individuality known as Lucy, Jane, Flora, Evangeline,\r\nor what-not, had been merely a transient condition of her. He did not\r\nrecognize this as an excuse or as a defence, but as a fact simply.\r\nEssentially she was perhaps of no tangible substance; a spirit, a dream,\r\na frenzy, a conception, an aroma, an epitomized sex, a light of the eye,\r\na parting of the lips. God only knew what she really was; Pierston did\r\nnot. She was indescribable.\r\n\r\nNever much considering that she was a subjective phenomenon vivified by\r\nthe weird influences of his descent and birthplace, the discovery of\r\nher ghostliness, of her independence of physical laws and failings, had\r\noccasionally given him a sense of fear. He never knew where she next\r\nwould be, whither she would lead him, having herself instant access\r\nto all ranks and classes, to every abode of men. Sometimes at night he\r\ndreamt that she was \xe2\x80\x98the wile-weaving Daughter of high Zeus\xe2\x80\x99 in person,\r\nbent on tormenting him for his sins against her beauty in his art--the\r\nimplacable Aphrodite herself indeed. He knew that he loved the\r\nmasquerading creature wherever he found her, whether with blue eyes,\r\nblack eyes, or brown; whether presenting herself as tall, fragile, or\r\nplump. She was never in two places at once; but hitherto she had never\r\nbeen in one place long.\r\n\r\nBy making this clear to his mind some time before to-day, he had escaped\r\na good deal of ugly self-reproach. It was simply that she who always\r\nattracted him, and led him whither she would as by a silken thread, had\r\nnot remained the occupant of the same fleshly tabernacle in her career\r\nso far. Whether she would ultimately settle down to one he could not\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nHad he felt that she was becoming manifest in Avice, he would have tried\r\nto believe that this was the terminal spot of her migrations, and have\r\nbeen content to abide by his words. But did he see the Well-Beloved in\r\nAvice at all? The question was somewhat disturbing.\r\n\r\nHe had reached the brow of the hill, and descended towards the village,\r\nwhere in the long straight Roman street he soon found the lighted hall.\r\nThe performance was not yet over; and by going round to the side of the\r\nbuilding and standing on a mound he could see the interior as far down\r\nas the platform level. Avice\xe2\x80\x99s turn, or second turn, came on almost\r\nimmediately. Her pretty embarrassment on facing the audience rather won\r\nhim away from his doubts. She was, in truth, what is called a \xe2\x80\x98nice\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngirl; attractive, certainly, but above all things nice--one of the class\r\nwith whom the risks of matrimony approximate most nearly to zero. Her\r\nintelligent eyes, her broad forehead, her thoughtful carriage, ensured\r\none thing, that of all the girls he had known he had never met one with\r\nmore charming and solid qualities than Avice Caro\xe2\x80\x99s. This was not a mere\r\nconjecture--he had known her long and thoroughly; her every mood and\r\ntemper.\r\n\r\nA heavy wagon passing without drowned her small soft voice for him; but\r\nthe audience were pleased, and she blushed at their applause. He now\r\ntook his station at the door, and when the people had done pouring out\r\nhe found her within awaiting him.\r\n\r\nThey climbed homeward slowly by the Old Road, Pierston dragging himself\r\nup the steep by the wayside hand-rail and pulling Avice after him upon\r\nhis arm. At the top they turned and stood still. To the left of them the\r\nsky was streaked like a fan with the lighthouse rays, and under their\r\nfront, at periods of a quarter of a minute, there arose a deep, hollow\r\nstroke like the single beat of a drum, the intervals being filled with a\r\nlong-drawn rattling, as of bones between huge canine jaws. It came from\r\nthe vast concave of Deadman\xe2\x80\x99s Bay, rising and falling against the pebble\r\ndyke.\r\n\r\nThe evening and night winds here were, to Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s mind, charged with\r\na something that did not burden them elsewhere. They brought it up from\r\nthat sinister Bay to the west, whose movement she and he were hearing\r\nnow. It was a presence--an imaginary shape or essence from the human\r\nmultitude lying below: those who had gone down in vessels of war, East\r\nIndiamen, barges, brigs, and ships of the Armada--select people, common,\r\nand debased, whose interests and hopes had been as wide asunder as\r\nthe poles, but who had rolled each other to oneness on that restless\r\nsea-bed. There could almost be felt the brush of their huge composite\r\nghost as it ran a shapeless figure over the isle, shrieking for some\r\ngood god who would disunite it again.\r\n\r\nThe twain wandered a long way that night amid these influences--so\r\nfar as to the old Hope Churchyard, which lay in a ravine formed by a\r\nlandslip ages ago. The church had slipped down with the rest of the\r\ncliff, and had long been a ruin. It seemed to say that in this last\r\nlocal stronghold of the Pagan divinities, where Pagan customs lingered\r\nyet, Christianity had established itself precariously at best. In that\r\nsolemn spot Pierston kissed her.\r\n\r\nThe kiss was by no means on Avice\xe2\x80\x99s initiative this time. Her former\r\ndemonstrativeness seemed to have increased her present reserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nThat day was the beginning of a pleasant month passed mainly in each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s society. He found that she could not only recite poetry at\r\nintellectual gatherings, but play the piano fairly, and sing to her own\r\naccompaniment.\r\n\r\nHe observed that every aim of those who had brought her up had been to\r\nget her away mentally as far as possible from her natural and individual\r\nlife as an inhabitant of a peculiar island: to make her an exact copy\r\nof tens of thousands of other people, in whose circumstances there was\r\nnothing special, distinctive, or picturesque; to teach her to forget all\r\nthe experiences of her ancestors; to drown the local ballads by songs\r\npurchased at the Budmouth fashionable music-sellers\xe2\x80\x99, and the local\r\nvocabulary by a governess-tongue of no country at all. She lived in a\r\nhouse that would have been the fortune of an artist, and learnt to draw\r\nLondon suburban villas from printed copies.\r\n\r\nAvice had seen all this before he pointed it out, but, with a girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntractability, had acquiesced. By constitution she was local to the bone,\r\nbut she could not escape the tendency of the age.\r\n\r\nThe time for Jocelyn\xe2\x80\x99s departure drew near, and she looked forward to\r\nit sadly, but serenely, their engagement being now a settled thing.\r\nPierston thought of the native custom on such occasions, which had\r\nprevailed in his and her family for centuries, both being of the old\r\nstock of the isle. The influx of \xe2\x80\x98kimberlins,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98foreigners\xe2\x80\x99 (as\r\nstrangers from the mainland of Wessex were called), had led in a large\r\nmeasure to its discontinuance; but underneath the veneer of Avice\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neducation many an old-fashioned idea lay slumbering, and he wondered\r\nif, in her natural melancholy at his leaving, she regretted the changing\r\nmanners which made unpopular the formal ratification of a betrothal,\r\naccording to the precedent of their sires and grandsires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. III. THE APPOINTMENT\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98here we are, arrived at the fag-end of my holiday.\r\nWhat a pleasant surprise my old home, which I have not thought worth\r\ncoming to see for three or four years, had in store for me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must go to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomething seemed to overweigh them; something more than the natural\r\nsadness of a parting which was not to be long; and he decided that\r\ninstead of leaving in the daytime as he had intended, he would defer his\r\ndeparture till night, and go by the mail-train from Budmouth. This would\r\ngive him time to look into his father\xe2\x80\x99s quarries, and enable her, if she\r\nchose, to walk with him along the beach as far as to Henry the Eighth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCastle above the sands, where they could linger and watch the moon rise\r\nover the sea. She said she thought she could come.\r\n\r\nSo after spending the next day with his father in the quarries Jocelyn\r\nprepared to leave, and at the time appointed set out from the stone\r\nhouse of his birth in this stone isle to walk to Budmouth-Regis by the\r\npath along the beach, Avice having some time earlier gone down to see\r\nsome friends in the Street of Wells, which was halfway towards the spot\r\nof their tryst. The descent soon brought him to the pebble bank, and\r\nleaving behind him the last houses of the isle, and the ruins of the\r\nvillage destroyed by the November gale of 1824, he struck out along the\r\nnarrow thread of land. When he had walked a hundred yards he stopped,\r\nturned aside to the pebble ridge which walled out the sea, and sat down\r\nto wait for her.\r\n\r\nBetween him and the lights of the ships riding at anchor in the\r\nroadstead two men passed slowly in the direction he intended to pursue.\r\nOne of them recognized Jocelyn, and bade him good-night, adding, \xe2\x80\x98Wish\r\nyou joy, sir, of your choice, and hope the wedden will be soon!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, Seaborn. Well--we shall see what Christmas will do towards\r\nbringing it about.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My wife opened upon it this mornen: \xe2\x80\x9cPlease God, I\xe2\x80\x99ll up and see that\r\nthere wedden,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, \xe2\x80\x9cknowing \xe2\x80\x98em both from their crawling days.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe men moved on, and when they were out of Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s hearing the one\r\nwho had not spoken said to his friend, \xe2\x80\x98Who was that young kimberlin? He\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t seem one o\xe2\x80\x99 we.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, he is, though, every inch o\xe2\x80\x99 en. He\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Jocelyn Pierston, the\r\nstwone-merchant\xe2\x80\x99s only son up at East Quarriers. He\xe2\x80\x99s to be married to\r\na stylish young body; her mother, a widow woman, carries on the same\r\nbusiness as well as she can; but their trade is not a twentieth part of\r\nPierston\xe2\x80\x99s. He\xe2\x80\x99s worth thousands and thousands, they say, though \xe2\x80\x98a do\r\nlive on in the same wold way up in the same wold house. This son is doen\r\ngreat things in London as a\xe2\x80\x99 image-carver; and I can mind when, as a\r\nboy, \xe2\x80\x98a first took to carving soldiers out o\xe2\x80\x99 bits o\xe2\x80\x99 stwone from the\r\nsoft-bed of his father\xe2\x80\x99s quarries; and then \xe2\x80\x98a made a set o\xe2\x80\x99 stwonen\r\nchess-men, and so \xe2\x80\x98a got on. He\xe2\x80\x99s quite the gent in London, they tell\r\nme; and the wonder is that \xe2\x80\x98a cared to come back here and pick up little\r\nAvice Caro--nice maid as she is notwithstanding.... Hullo! there\xe2\x80\x99s to be\r\na change in the weather soon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the subject of their remarks waited at the appointed place\r\ntill seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the hour named between himself and his affianced,\r\nhad struck. Almost at the moment he saw a figure coming forward from the\r\nlast lamp at the bottom of the hill. But the figure speedily resolved\r\nitself into that of a boy, who, advancing to Jocelyn, inquired if he\r\nwere Mr. Pierston, and handed him a note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. IV. A LONELY PEDESTRIAN\r\n\r\nWhen the boy had gone Jocelyn retraced his steps to the last lamp, and\r\nread, in Avice\xe2\x80\x99s hand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAREST,--I shall be sorry if I grieve you at all in what I am going\r\nto say about our arrangement to meet to-night in the Sandsfoot ruin. But\r\nI have fancied that my seeing you again and again lately is inclining\r\nyour father to insist, and you as his heir to feel, that we ought to\r\ncarry out Island Custom in our courting--your people being such old\r\ninhabitants in an unbroken line. Truth to say, mother supposes that your\r\nfather, for natural reasons, may have hinted to you that we ought. Now,\r\nthe thing is contrary to my feelings: it is nearly left off; and I do\r\nnot think it good, even where there is property, as in your case, to\r\njustify it, in a measure. I would rather trust in Providence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On the whole, therefore, it is best that I should not come--if only for\r\nappearances--and meet you at a time and place suggesting the custom, to\r\nothers than ourselves, at least, if known.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure that this decision will not disturb you much; that you will\r\nunderstand my modern feelings, and think no worse of me for them. And\r\ndear, if it were to be done, and we were unfortunate in it, we might\r\nboth have enough old family feeling to think, like our forefathers, and\r\npossibly your father, that we could not marry honourably; and hence we\r\nmight be made unhappy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However, you will come again shortly, will you not, dear Jocelyn?--and\r\nthen the time will soon draw on when no more good-byes will be\r\nrequired.--Always and ever yours,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98AVICE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJocelyn, having read the letter, was surprised at the naivete it showed,\r\nand at Avice and her mother\xe2\x80\x99s antiquated simplicity in supposing that to\r\nbe still a grave and operating principle which was a bygone barbarism\r\nto himself and other absentees from the island. His father, as a\r\nmoney-maker, might have practical wishes on the matter of descendants\r\nwhich lent plausibility to the conjecture of Avice and her mother; but\r\nto Jocelyn he had never expressed himself in favour of the ancient ways,\r\nold-fashioned as he was.\r\n\r\nAmused therefore at her regard of herself as modern, Jocelyn was\r\ndisappointed, and a little vexed, that such an unforeseen reason should\r\nhave deprived him of her company. How the old ideas survived under the\r\nnew education!\r\n\r\nThe reader is asked to remember that the date, though recent in the\r\nhistory of the Isle of Slingers, was more than forty years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding that the evening seemed louring, yet indisposed to go back and\r\nhire a vehicle, he went on quickly alone. In such an exposed spot the\r\nnight wind was gusty, and the sea behind the pebble barrier kicked and\r\nflounced in complex rhythms, which could be translated equally well as\r\nshocks of battle or shouts of thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nPresently on the pale road before him he discerned a figure, the figure\r\nof a woman. He remembered that a woman passed him while he was reading\r\nAvice\xe2\x80\x99s letter by the last lamp, and now he was overtaking her.\r\n\r\nHe did hope for a moment that it might be Avice, with a changed mind.\r\nBut it was not she, nor anybody like her. It was a taller, squarer form\r\nthan that of his betrothed, and although the season was only autumn she\r\nwas wrapped in furs, or in thick and heavy clothing of some kind.\r\n\r\nHe soon advanced abreast of her, and could get glimpses of her profile\r\nagainst the roadstead lights. It was dignified, arresting, that of a\r\nvery Juno. Nothing more classical had he ever seen. She walked at a\r\nswinging pace, yet with such ease and power that there was but little\r\ndifference in their rate of speed for several minutes; and during this\r\ntime he regarded and conjectured. However, he was about to pass her by\r\nwhen she suddenly turned and addressed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Pierston, I think, of East Quarriers?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe assented, and could just discern what a handsome, commanding,\r\nimperious face it was--quite of a piece with the proud tones of her\r\nvoice. She was a new type altogether in his experience; and her accent\r\nwas not so local as Avice\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can you tell me the time, please?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch by the aid of a light, and in telling her that it\r\nwas a quarter past seven observed, by the momentary gleam of his match,\r\nthat her eyes looked a little red and chafed, as if with weeping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pierston, will you forgive what will appear very strange to you, I\r\ndare say? That is, may I ask you to lend me some money for a day or two?\r\nI have been so foolish as to leave my purse on the dressing-table.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt did appear strange: and yet there were features in the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npersonality which assured him in a moment that she was not an impostor.\r\nHe yielded to her request, and put his hand in his pocket. Here it\r\nremained for a moment. How much did she mean by the words \xe2\x80\x98some money\xe2\x80\x99?\r\nThe Junonian quality of her form and manner made him throw himself by\r\nan impulse into harmony with her, and he responded regally. He scented a\r\nromance. He handed her five pounds.\r\n\r\nHis munificence caused her no apparent surprise. \xe2\x80\x98It is quite enough,\r\nthank you,\xe2\x80\x99 she remarked quietly, as he announced the sum, lest she\r\nshould be unable to see it for herself.\r\n\r\nWhile overtaking and conversing with her he had not observed that the\r\nrising wind, which had proceeded from puffing to growling, and from\r\ngrowling to screeching, with the accustomed suddenness of its changes\r\nhere, had at length brought what it promised by these vagaries--rain.\r\nThe drops, which had at first hit their left cheeks like the pellets of\r\na popgun, soon assumed the character of a raking fusillade from the\r\nbank adjoining, one shot of which was sufficiently smart to go through\r\nJocelyn\xe2\x80\x99s sleeve. The tall girl turned, and seemed to be somewhat\r\nconcerned at an onset which she had plainly not foreseen before her\r\nstarting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must take shelter,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jocelyn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But where?\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\nTo windward was the long, monotonous bank, too obtusely piled to afford\r\na screen, over which they could hear the canine crunching of pebbles by\r\nthe sea without; on their right stretched the inner bay or roadstead,\r\nthe distant riding-lights of the ships now dim and glimmering; behind\r\nthem a faint spark here and there in the lower sky showed where the\r\nisland rose; before there was nothing definite, and could be nothing,\r\ntill they reached a precarious wood bridge, a mile further on, Henry the\r\nEighth\xe2\x80\x99s Castle being a little further still.\r\n\r\nBut just within the summit of the bank, whither it had apparently been\r\nhauled to be out of the way of the waves, was one of the local boats\r\ncalled lerrets, bottom upwards. As soon as they saw it the pair ran\r\nup the pebbly slope towards it by a simultaneous impulse. They then\r\nperceived that it had lain there a long time, and were comforted to find\r\nit capable of affording more protection than anybody would have expected\r\nfrom a distant view. It formed a shelter or store for the fishermen, the\r\nbottom of the lerret being tarred as a roof. By creeping under the bows,\r\nwhich overhung the bank on props to leeward, they made their way within,\r\nwhere, upon some thwarts, oars, and other fragmentary woodwork, lay\r\na mass of dry netting--a whole sein. Upon this they scrambled and sat\r\ndown, through inability to stand upright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. V. A CHARGE\r\n\r\nThe rain fell upon the keel of the old lerret like corn thrown in\r\nhandfuls by some colossal sower, and darkness set in to its full shade.\r\n\r\nThey crouched so close to each other that he could feel her furs against\r\nhim. Neither had spoken since they left the roadway till she said, with\r\nattempted unconcern: \xe2\x80\x98This is unfortunate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe admitted that it was, and found, after a few further remarks had\r\npassed, that she certainly had been weeping, there being a suppressed\r\ngasp of passionateness in her utterance now and then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is more unfortunate for you, perhaps, than for me,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and I\r\nam very sorry that it should be so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe replied nothing to this, and he added that it was rather a desolate\r\nplace for a woman, alone and afoot. He hoped nothing serious had\r\nhappened to drag her out at such an untoward time.\r\n\r\nAt first she seemed not at all disposed to show any candour on her own\r\naffairs, and he was left to conjecture as to her history and name, and\r\nhow she could possibly have known him. But, as the rain gave not the\r\nleast sign of cessation, he observed: \xe2\x80\x98I think we shall have to go\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never!\xe2\x80\x99 said she, and the firmness with which she closed her lips was\r\naudible in the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why not?\xe2\x80\x99 he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There are good reasons.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot understand how you should know me, while I have no knowledge\r\nof you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, but you know me--about me, at least.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed I don\xe2\x80\x99t. How should I? You are a kimberlin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not. I am a real islander--or was, rather.... Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you heard of\r\nthe Best-Bed Stone Company?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think so! They tried to ruin my father by getting away his\r\ntrade--or, at least, the founder of the company did--old Bencomb.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s my father!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed. I am sorry I should have spoken so disrespectfully of him, for\r\nI never knew him personally. After making over his large business to the\r\ncompany, he retired, I believe, to London?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Our house, or rather his, not mine, is at South Kensington. We\r\nhave lived there for years. But we have been tenants of Sylvania Castle,\r\non the island here, this season. We took it for a month or two of the\r\nowner, who is away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I have been staying quite near you, Miss Bencomb. My father\xe2\x80\x99s is a\r\ncomparatively humble residence hard by.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But he could afford a much bigger one if he chose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have heard so? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me much of his\r\naffairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My father,\xe2\x80\x99 she burst out suddenly, \xe2\x80\x98is always scolding me for my\r\nextravagance! And he has been doing it to-day more than ever. He said\r\nI go shopping in town to simply a diabolical extent, and exceed my\r\nallowance!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was that this evening?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. And then it reached such a storm of passion between us that\r\nI pretended to retire to my room for the rest of the evening, but I\r\nslipped out; and I am never going back home again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What will you do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall go first to my aunt in London; and if she won\xe2\x80\x99t have me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwork for a living. I have left my father for ever! What I should have\r\ndone if I had not met you I cannot tell--I must have walked all the way\r\nto London, I suppose. Now I shall take the train as soon as I reach the\r\nmainland.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you ever do in this hurricane.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must sit here till it stops.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd there on the nets they sat. Pierston knew of old Bencomb as his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s bitterest enemy, who had made a great fortune by swallowing up\r\nthe small stone-merchants, but had found Jocelyn\xe2\x80\x99s sire a trifle too big\r\nto digest--the latter being, in fact, the chief rival of the Best-Bed\r\nCompany to that day. Jocelyn thought it strange that he should be\r\nthrown by fate into a position to play the son of the Montagues to this\r\ndaughter of the Capulets.\r\n\r\nAs they talked there was a mutual instinct to drop their voices, and\r\non this account the roar of the storm necessitated their drawing quite\r\nclose together. Something tender came into their tones as quarter-hour\r\nafter quarter-hour went on, and they forgot the lapse of time. It was\r\nquite late when she started up, alarmed at her position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rain or no rain, I can stay no longer,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do come back,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, taking her hand. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll return with you. My\r\ntrain has gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; I shall go on, and get a lodging in Budmouth town, if ever I reach\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is so late that there will be no house open, except a little place\r\nnear the station where you won\xe2\x80\x99t care to stay. However, if you are\r\ndetermined I will show you the way. I cannot leave you. It would be too\r\nawkward for you to go there alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe persisted, and they started through the twanging and spinning storm.\r\nThe sea rolled and rose so high on their left, and was so near them on\r\ntheir right, that it seemed as if they were traversing its bottom like\r\nthe Children of Israel. Nothing but the frail bank of pebbles divided\r\nthem from the raging gulf without, and at every bang of the tide against\r\nit the ground shook, the shingle clashed, the spray rose vertically, and\r\nwas blown over their heads. Quantities of sea-water trickled through\r\nthe pebble wall, and ran in rivulets across their path to join the sea\r\nwithin. The \xe2\x80\x98Island\xe2\x80\x99 was an island still.\r\n\r\nThey had not realized the force of the elements till now. Pedestrians\r\nhad often been blown into the sea hereabout, and drowned, owing to\r\na sudden breach in the bank; which, however, had something of a\r\nsupernatural power in being able to close up and join itself together\r\nagain after such disruption, like Satan\xe2\x80\x99s form when, cut in two by the\r\nsword of Michael,\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x98The ethereal substance closed,\r\n     Not long divisible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nHer clothing offered more resistance to the wind than his, and she was\r\nconsequently in the greater danger. It was impossible to refuse his\r\nproffered aid. First he gave his arm, but the wind tore them apart as\r\neasily as coupled cherries. He steadied her bodily by encircling her\r\nwaist with his arm; and she made no objection.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nSomewhere about this time--it might have been sooner, it might have been\r\nlater--he became conscious of a sensation which, in its incipient and\r\nunrecognized form, had lurked within him from some unnoticed moment when\r\nhe was sitting close to his new friend under the lerret. Though a\r\nyoung man, he was too old a hand not to know what this was, and\r\nfelt alarmed--even dismayed. It meant a possible migration of the\r\nWell-Beloved. The thing had not, however, taken place; and he went on\r\nthinking how soft and warm the lady was in her fur covering, as he held\r\nher so tightly; the only dry spots in the clothing of either being her\r\nleft side and his right, where they excluded the rain by their mutual\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had crossed the ferry-bridge there was a little more\r\nshelter, but he did not relinquish his hold till she requested him. They\r\npassed the ruined castle, and having left the island far behind them\r\ntrod mile after mile till they drew near to the outskirts of the\r\nneighbouring watering-place. Into it they plodded without pause,\r\ncrossing the harbour bridge about midnight, wet to the skin.\r\n\r\nHe pitied her, and, while he wondered at it, admired her determination.\r\nThe houses facing the bay now sheltered them completely, and they\r\nreached the vicinity of the new railway terminus (which the station was\r\nat this date) without difficulty. As he had said, there was only one\r\nhouse open hereabout, a little temperance inn, where the people stayed\r\nup for the arrival of the morning mail and passengers from the Channel\r\nboats. Their application for admission led to the withdrawal of a bolt,\r\nand they stood within the gaslight of the passage.\r\n\r\nHe could see now that though she was such a fine figure, quite as tall\r\nas himself, she was but in the bloom of young womanhood. Her face was\r\ncertainly striking, though rather by its imperiousness than its beauty;\r\nand the beating of the wind and rain and spray had inflamed her cheeks\r\nto peony hues.\r\n\r\nShe persisted in the determination to go on to London by an early\r\nmorning train, and he therefore offered advice on lesser matters only.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In that case,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98you must go up to your room and send down your\r\nthings, that they may be dried by the fire immediately, or they will not\r\nbe ready. I will tell the servant to do this, and send you up something\r\nto eat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe assented to his proposal, without, however, showing any marks of\r\ngratitude; and when she had gone Pierston despatched her the light\r\nsupper promised by the sleepy girl who was \xe2\x80\x98night porter\xe2\x80\x99 at this\r\nestablishment. He felt ravenously hungry himself, and set about drying\r\nhis clothes as well as he could, and eating at the same time.\r\n\r\nAt first he was in doubt what to do, but soon decided to stay where\r\nhe was till the morrow. By the aid of some temporary wraps, and\r\nsome slippers from the cupboard, he was contriving to make himself\r\ncomfortable when the maid-servant came downstairs with a damp armful of\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s raiment.\r\n\r\nPierston withdrew from the fire. The maid-servant knelt down before the\r\nblaze and held up with extended arms one of the habiliments of the Juno\r\nupstairs, from which a cloud of steam began to rise. As she knelt, the\r\ngirl nodded forward, recovered herself, and nodded again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are sleepy, my girl,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pierston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir; I have been up a long time. When nobody comes I lie down on\r\nthe couch in the other room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll relieve you of that; go and lie down in the other room, just\r\nas if we were not here. I\xe2\x80\x99ll dry the clothing and put the articles here\r\nin a heap, which you can take up to the young lady in the morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x98night porter\xe2\x80\x99 thanked him and left the room, and he soon heard her\r\nsnoring from the adjoining apartment. Then Jocelyn opened proceedings,\r\noverhauling the robes and extending them one by one. As the steam went\r\nup he fell into a reverie. He again became conscious of the change\r\nwhich had been initiated during the walk. The Well-Beloved was moving\r\nhouse--had gone over to the wearer of this attire.\r\n\r\nIn the course of ten minutes he adored her.\r\n\r\nAnd how about little Avice Caro? He did not think of her as before.\r\n\r\nHe was not sure that he had ever seen the real Beloved in that friend of\r\nhis youth, solicitous as he was for her welfare. But, loving her or not,\r\nhe perceived that the spirit, emanation, idealism, which called itself\r\nhis Love was flitting stealthily from some remoter figure to the near\r\none in the chamber overhead.\r\n\r\nAvice had not kept her engagement to meet him in the lonely ruin,\r\nfearing her own imaginings. But he, in fact, more than she, had been\r\neducated out of the island innocence that had upheld old manners; and\r\nthis was the strange consequence of Avice\xe2\x80\x99s misapprehension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. VI. ON THE BRINK\r\n\r\nMiss Bencomb was leaving the hotel for the railway, which was quite near\r\nat hand, and had only recently been opened, as if on purpose for this\r\nevent. At Jocelyn\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion she wrote a message to inform her father\r\nthat she had gone to her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s, with a view to allaying anxiety and\r\ndeterring pursuit. They walked together to the platform and bade each\r\nother good-bye; each obtained a ticket independently, and Jocelyn got\r\nhis luggage from the cloak-room.\r\n\r\nOn the platform they encountered each other again, and there was a light\r\nin their glances at each other which said, as by a flash-telegraph: \xe2\x80\x98We\r\nare bound for the same town, why not enter the same compartment?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey did.\r\n\r\nShe took a corner seat, with her back to the engine; he sat opposite.\r\nThe guard looked in, thought they were lovers, and did not show other\r\ntravellers into that compartment. They talked on strictly ordinary\r\nmatters; what she thought he did not know, but at every stopping station\r\nhe dreaded intrusion. Before they were halfway to London the event\r\nhe had just begun to realize was a patent fact. The Beloved was again\r\nembodied; she filled every fibre and curve of this woman\xe2\x80\x99s form.\r\n\r\nDrawing near the great London station was like drawing near Doomsday.\r\nHow should he leave her in the turmoil of a crowded city street? She\r\nseemed quite unprepared for the rattle of the scene. He asked her where\r\nher aunt lived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bayswater,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Bencomb.\r\n\r\nHe called a cab, and proposed that she should share it till they arrived\r\nat her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s, whose residence lay not much out of the way to his own.\r\nTry as he would he could not ascertain if she understood his feelings,\r\nbut she assented to his offer and entered the vehicle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are old friends,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, as they drove onward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, we are,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered, without smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But hereditarily we are mortal enemies, dear Juliet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--What did you say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I said Juliet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe laughed in a half-proud way, and murmured: \xe2\x80\x98Your father is my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s enemy, and my father is mine. Yes, it is so.\xe2\x80\x99 And then their\r\neyes caught each other\xe2\x80\x99s glance. \xe2\x80\x98My queenly darling!\xe2\x80\x99 he burst out;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98instead of going to your aunt\xe2\x80\x99s, will you come and marry me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA flush covered her over, which seemed akin to a flush of rage. It was\r\nnot exactly that, but she was excited. She did not answer, and he feared\r\nhe had mortally offended her dignity. Perhaps she had only made use of\r\nhim as a convenient aid to her intentions. However, he went on-- \xe2\x80\x98Your\r\nfather would not be able to reclaim you then! After all, this is not\r\nso precipitate as it seems. You know all about me, my history, my\r\nprospects. I know all about you. Our families have been neighbours\r\non that isle for hundreds of years, though you are now such a London\r\nproduct.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you ever be a Royal Academician?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked musingly, her\r\nexcitement having calmed down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope to be--I WILL be, if you will be my wife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis companion looked at him long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Think what a short way out of your difficulty this would be,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x98No bother about aunts, no fetching home by an angry father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt seemed to decide her. She yielded to his embrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long will it take to marry?\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Bencomb asked by-and-by, with\r\nobvious self-repression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We could do it to-morrow. I could get to Doctors\xe2\x80\x99 Commons by noon\r\nto-day, and the licence would be ready by to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t go to my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s, I will be an independent woman! I have been\r\nreprimanded as if I were a child of six. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be your wife if it is as\r\neasy as you say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey stopped the cab while they held a consultation. Pierston had rooms\r\nand a studio in the neighbourhood of Campden Hill; but it would be\r\nhardly desirable to take her thither till they were married. They\r\ndecided to go to an hotel.\r\n\r\nChanging their direction, therefore, they went back to the Strand, and\r\nsoon ensconced themselves in one of the venerable old taverns of Covent\r\nGarden, a precinct which in those days was frequented by West-country\r\npeople. Jocelyn then left her and proceeded on his errand eastward.\r\n\r\nIt was about three o\xe2\x80\x99clock when, having arranged all preliminaries\r\nnecessitated by this sudden change of front, he began strolling slowly\r\nback; he felt bewildered, and to walk was a relief. Gazing occasionally\r\ninto this shop window and that, he called a hansom as by an inspiration,\r\nand directed the driver to \xe2\x80\x98Mellstock Gardens.\xe2\x80\x99 Arrived here, he rang\r\nthe bell of a studio, and in a minute or two it was answered by a young\r\nman in shirt-sleeves, about his own age, with a great smeared palette on\r\nhis left thumb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, you, Pierston! I thought you were in the country. Come in. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nawfully glad of this. I am here in town finishing off a painting for an\r\nAmerican, who wants to take it back with him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston followed his friend into the painting-room, where a pretty\r\nyoung woman was sitting sewing. At a signal from the painter she\r\ndisappeared without speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can see from your face you have something to say; so we\xe2\x80\x99ll have it\r\nall to ourselves. You are in some trouble? What\xe2\x80\x99ll you drink?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what, so that it is alcohol in some shape or\r\nform.... Now, Somers, you must just listen to me, for I HAVE something\r\nto tell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston had sat down in an arm-chair, and Somers had resumed his\r\npainting. When a servant had brought in brandy to soothe Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnerves, and soda to take off the injurious effects of the brandy, and\r\nmilk to take off the depleting effects of the soda, Jocelyn began his\r\nnarrative, addressing it rather to Somers\xe2\x80\x99s Gothic chimneypiece, and\r\nSomers\xe2\x80\x99s Gothic clock, and Somers\xe2\x80\x99s Gothic rugs, than to Somers himself,\r\nwho stood at his picture a little behind his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Before I tell you what has happened to me,\xe2\x80\x99 Pierston said, \xe2\x80\x98I want to\r\nlet you know the manner of man I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lord--I know already.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t. It is a sort of thing one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to talk of. I lie\r\nawake at night thinking about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99 said Somers, with more sympathy, seeing that his friend was really\r\ntroubled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am under a curious curse, or influence. I am posed, puzzled\r\nand perplexed by the legerdemain of a creature--a deity rather; by\r\nAphrodite, as a poet would put it, as I should put it myself in marble.\r\n... But I forget--this is not to be a deprecatory wail, but a defence--a\r\nsort of Apologia pro vita mea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s better. Fire away!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. VII. HER EARLIER INCARNATIONS\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You, Somers, are not, I know, one of those who continue to indulge\r\nin the world-wide, fond superstition that the Beloved One of any man\r\nalways, or even usually, cares to remain in one corporeal nook or shell\r\nfor any great length of time, however much he may wish her to do so. If\r\nI am wrong, and you do still hold to that ancient error--well, my story\r\nwill seem rather queer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suppose you say the Beloved of some men, not of any man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right--I\xe2\x80\x99ll say one man, this man only, if you are so particular.\r\nWe are a strange, visionary race down where I come from, and perhaps\r\nthat accounts for it. The Beloved of this one man, then, has had many\r\nincarnations--too many to describe in detail. Each shape, or embodiment,\r\nhas been a temporary residence only, which she has entered, lived in\r\nawhile, and made her exit from, leaving the substance, so far as I have\r\nbeen concerned, a corpse, worse luck! Now, there is no spiritualistic\r\nnonsense in this--it is simple fact, put in the plain form that the\r\nconventional public are afraid of. So much for the principle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good. Go on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well; the first embodiment of her occurred, so nearly as I can\r\nrecollect, when I was about the age of nine. Her vehicle was a little\r\nblue-eyed girl of eight or so, one of a family of eleven, with flaxen\r\nhair about her shoulders, which attempted to curl, but ignominiously\r\nfailed, hanging like chimney-crooks only. This defect used rather to\r\ntrouble me; and was, I believe, one of the main reasons of my Beloved\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeparture from that tenement. I cannot remember with any exactness\r\nwhen the departure occurred. I know it was after I had kissed my\r\nlittle friend in a garden-seat on a hot noontide, under a blue gingham\r\numbrella, which we had opened over us as we sat, that passers through\r\nEast Quarriers might not observe our marks of affection, forgetting that\r\nour screen must attract more attention than our persons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When the whole dream came to an end through her father leaving the\r\nisland, I thought my Well-Beloved had gone for ever (being then in the\r\nunpractised condition of Adam at sight of the first sunset). But she had\r\nnot. Laura had gone for ever, but not my Beloved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For some months after I had done crying for the flaxen-haired edition\r\nof her, my Love did not reappear. Then she came suddenly, unexpectedly,\r\nin a situation I should never have predicted. I was standing on the\r\nkerbstone of the pavement in Budmouth-Regis, outside the Preparatory\r\nSchool, looking across towards the sea, when a middle-aged gentleman on\r\nhorseback, and beside him a young lady, also mounted, passed down the\r\nstreet. The girl turned her head, and--possibly because I was gaping\r\nat her in awkward admiration, or smiling myself--smiled at me. Having\r\nridden a few paces, she looked round again and smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was enough, more than enough, to set me on fire. I understood in a\r\nmoment the information conveyed to me by my emotion--the Well-Beloved\r\nhad reappeared. This second form in which it had pleased her to take up\r\nher abode was quite a grown young woman\xe2\x80\x99s, darker in complexion than the\r\nfirst. Her hair, also worn in a knot, was of an ordinary brown, and so,\r\nI think, were her eyes, but the niceties of her features were not to be\r\ngathered so cursorily. However, there sat my coveted one, re-embodied;\r\nand, bidding my schoolmates a hasty farewell as soon as I could do so\r\nwithout suspicion, I hurried along the Esplanade in the direction she\r\nand her father had ridden. But they had put their horses to a canter,\r\nand I could not see which way they had gone. In the greatest misery\r\nI turned down a side street, but was soon elevated to a state of\r\nexcitement by seeing the same pair galloping towards me. Flushing up to\r\nmy hair, I stopped and heroically faced her as she passed. She smiled\r\nagain, but, alas! upon my Love\xe2\x80\x99s cheek there was no blush of passion for\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston paused, and drank from his glass, as he lived for a brief\r\nmoment in the scene he had conjured up. Somers reserved his comments,\r\nand Jocelyn continued--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That afternoon I idled about the streets, looking for her in vain. When\r\nI next saw one of the boys who had been with me at her first passing\r\nI stealthily reminded him of the incident, and asked if he knew the\r\nriders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cO yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was Colonel Targe and his daughter Elsie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHow old do you think she is?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, a sense of disparity in our ages\r\ndisturbing my mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cO--nineteen, I think they say. She\xe2\x80\x99s going to be married the day after\r\nto-morrow to Captain Popp, of the 501st, and they are ordered off to\r\nIndia at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The grief which I experienced at this intelligence was such that at\r\ndusk I went away to the edge of the harbour, intending to put an end\r\nto myself there and then. But I had been told that crabs had been found\r\nclinging to the dead faces of persons who had fallen in thereabout,\r\nleisurely eating them, and the idea of such an unpleasant contingency\r\ndeterred me. I should state that the marriage of my Beloved concerned me\r\nlittle; it was her departure that broke my heart. I never saw her again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Though I had already learnt that the absence of the corporeal matter\r\ndid not involve the absence of the informing spirit, I could scarce\r\nbring myself to believe that in this case it was possible for her to\r\nreturn to my view without the form she had last inhabited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But she did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was not, however, till after a good space of time, during which I\r\npassed through that bearish age in boys, their early teens, when girls\r\nare their especial contempt. I was about seventeen, and was sitting\r\none evening over a cup of tea in a confectioner\xe2\x80\x99s at the very same\r\nwatering-place, when opposite me a lady took her seat with a little\r\ngirl. We looked at each other awhile, the child made advances, till I\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a good little thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The lady assented, and made a further remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cShe has the soft fine eyes of her mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think her eyes are good?\xe2\x80\x9d asks the lady, as if she had not\r\nheard what she had heard most--the last three words of my opinion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes--for copies,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, regarding her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After this we got on very well. She informed me that her husband had\r\ngone out in a yacht, and I said it was a pity he didn\xe2\x80\x99t take her with\r\nhim for the airing. She gradually disclosed herself in the character of\r\na deserted young wife, and later on I met her in the street without the\r\nchild. She was going to the landing-stage to meet her husband, so she\r\ntold me; but she did not know the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I offered to show her, and did so. I will not go into particulars, but\r\nI afterwards saw her several times, and soon discovered that the Beloved\r\n(as to whose whereabouts I had been at fault so long) lurked here.\r\nThough why she had chosen this tantalizing situation of an inaccessible\r\nmatron\xe2\x80\x99s form when so many others offered, it was beyond me to discover.\r\nThe whole affair ended innocently enough, when the lady left the town\r\nwith her husband and child: she seemed to regard our acquaintance as a\r\nflirtation; yet it was anything but a flirtation for me!\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why should I tell the rest of the tantalizing tale! After this, the\r\nWell-Beloved put herself in evidence with greater and greater frequency,\r\nand it would be impossible for me to give you details of her various\r\nincarnations. She came nine times in the course of the two or three\r\nensuing years. Four times she masqueraded as a brunette, twice as a\r\npale-haired creature, and two or three times under a complexion neither\r\nlight nor dark. Sometimes she was a tall, fine girl, but more often, I\r\nthink, she preferred to slip into the skin of a lithe airy being, of no\r\ngreat stature. I grew so accustomed to these exits and entrances that\r\nI resigned myself to them quite passively, talked to her, kissed her,\r\ncorresponded with her, ached for her, in each of her several guises. So\r\nit went on until a month ago. And then for the first time I was puzzled.\r\nShe either had, or she had not, entered the person of Avice Caro, a\r\nyoung girl I had known from infancy. Upon the whole, I have decided\r\nthat, after all, she did not enter the form of Avice Caro, because I\r\nretain so great a respect for her still.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston here gave in brief the history of his revived comradeship with\r\nAvice, the verge of the engagement to which they had reached, and its\r\nunexpected rupture by him, merely through his meeting with a woman into\r\nwhom the Well-Beloved unmistakably moved under his very eyes--by name\r\nMiss Marcia Bencomb. He described their spontaneous decision to marry\r\noffhand; and then he put it to Somers whether he ought to marry or\r\nnot--her or anybody else--in such circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Somers. \xe2\x80\x98Though, if anybody, little Avice. But not\r\neven her. You are like other men, only rather worse. Essentially, all\r\nmen are fickle, like you; but not with such perceptiveness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely fickle is not the word? Fickleness means getting weary of a\r\nthing while the thing remains the same. But I have always been faithful\r\nto the elusive creature whom I have never been able to get a firm hold\r\nof, unless I have done so now. And let me tell you that her flitting\r\nfrom each to each individual has been anything but a pleasure for\r\nme--certainly not a wanton game of my instigation. To see the creature\r\nwho has hitherto been perfect, divine, lose under your very gaze the\r\ndivinity which has informed her, grow commonplace, turn from flame to\r\nashes, from a radiant vitality to a relic, is anything but a pleasure\r\nfor any man, and has been nothing less than a racking spectacle to my\r\nsight. Each mournful emptied shape stands ever after like the nest of\r\nsome beautiful bird from which the inhabitant has departed and left it\r\nto fill with snow. I have been absolutely miserable when I have looked\r\nin a face for her I used to see there, and could see her there no more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ought not to marry,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Somers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps I oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to! Though poor Marcia will be compromised, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t.... Was I not right in saying I am accursed in this\r\nthing? Fortunately nobody but myself has suffered on account of it\r\ntill now. Knowing what to expect, I have seldom ventured on a close\r\nacquaintance with any woman, in fear of prematurely driving away the\r\ndear one in her; who, however, has in time gone off just the same.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston soon after took his leave. A friend\xe2\x80\x99s advice on such a subject\r\nweighs little. He quickly returned to Miss Bencomb.\r\n\r\nShe was different now. Anxiety had visibly brought her down a notch\r\nor two, undone a few degrees of that haughty curl which her lip could\r\noccasionally assume. \xe2\x80\x98How long you have been away!\xe2\x80\x99 she said with a show\r\nof impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind, darling. It is all arranged,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98We shall be able to\r\nmarry in a few days.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We can\xe2\x80\x99t to-morrow. We have not been here quite long enough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But how did the people at Doctors\xe2\x80\x99 Commons know that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well--I forgot that residence, real or assumed, was necessary, and\r\nunfortunately admitted that we had only just arrived.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O how stupid! But it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped now. I think, dear, I should have\r\nknown better, however!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. VIII. \xe2\x80\x98TOO LIKE THE LIGHTNING\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey lived on at the hotel some days longer, eyed curiously by the\r\nchambermaids, and burst in upon every now and then by the waiters as if\r\naccidentally. When they were walking together, mostly in back streets\r\nfor fear of being recognized, Marcia was often silent, and her imperious\r\nface looked gloomy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dummy!\xe2\x80\x99 he said playfully, on one of these occasions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am vexed that by your admissions at Doctors\xe2\x80\x99 Commons you prevented\r\nthem giving you the licence at once! It is not nice, my living on with\r\nyou like this!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But we are going to marry, dear!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured, and fell into reverie again. \xe2\x80\x98What a sudden resolve\r\nit was of ours!\xe2\x80\x99 she continued. \xe2\x80\x98I wish I could get my father and\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s consent to our marriage.... As we can\xe2\x80\x99t complete it for another\r\nday or two, a letter might be sent to them and their answer received? I\r\nhave a mind to write.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston expressed his doubts of the wisdom of this course, which seemed\r\nto make her desire it the more, and the result was a tiff between them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Since we are obliged to delay it, I won\xe2\x80\x99t marry without their consent!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe cried at last passionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well then, dear. Write,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\nWhen they were again indoors, she sat down to a note, but after a while\r\nthrew aside her pen despairingly. \xe2\x80\x98No: I cannot do it!\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t bend my pride to such a job. Will YOU write for me, Jocelyn?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I? I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why I should be the one, particularly as I think it\r\npremature.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you have not quarrelled with my father as I have done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well no. But there is a long-standing antagonism, which would make it\r\nodd in me to be the writer. Wait till we are married, and then I will\r\nwrite. Not till then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I suppose I must. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know my father. He might forgive me\r\nmarrying into any other family without his knowledge, but he thinks\r\nyours such a mean one, and so resents the trade rivalry, that he would\r\nnever pardon till the day of his death my becoming a Pierston secretly.\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it at first.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis remark caused an unpleasant jar on the mind of Pierston. Despite\r\nhis independent artistic position in London, he was staunch to the\r\nsimple old parent who had stubbornly held out for so many years against\r\nBencomb\xe2\x80\x99s encroaching trade, and whose money had educated and maintained\r\nJocelyn as an art-student in the best schools. So he begged her to say\r\nno more about his mean family, and she silently resumed her letter,\r\ngiving an address at a post-office that their quarters might not be\r\ndiscovered, at least just yet.\r\n\r\nNo reply came by return of post; but, rather ominously, some letters for\r\nMarcia that had arrived at her father\xe2\x80\x99s since her departure were sent\r\non in silence to the address given. She opened them one by one, till\r\non reading the last, she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Good gracious!\xe2\x80\x99 and burst into\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Pierston.\r\n\r\nMarcia began to read the letter aloud. It came from a faithful lover of\r\nhers, a youthful Jersey gentleman, who stated that he was soon going to\r\nstart for England to claim his darling, according to her plighted word.\r\n\r\nShe was half risible, half concerned. \xe2\x80\x98What shall I do?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do? My dear girl, it seems to me that there is only one thing to do,\r\nand that a very obvious thing. Tell him as soon as possible that you are\r\njust on the point of marriage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMarcia thereupon wrote out a reply to that effect, Jocelyn helping her\r\nto shape the phrases as gently as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I repeat\xe2\x80\x99 (her letter concluded) \xe2\x80\x98that I had quite forgotten! I am\r\ndeeply sorry; but that is the truth. I have told my intended husband\r\neverything, and he is looking over my shoulder as I write.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Jocelyn when he saw this set down: \xe2\x80\x98You might leave out the last\r\nfew words. They are rather an extra stab for the poor boy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stab? It is not that, dear. Why does he want to come bothering me?\r\nJocelyn, you ought to be very proud that I have put you in my letter at\r\nall. You said yesterday that I was conceited in declaring I might have\r\nmarried that science-man I told you of. But now you see there was yet\r\nanother available.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe, gloomily: \xe2\x80\x98Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to hear about that. To my mind this\r\nsort of thing is decidedly unpleasant, though you treat it so lightly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 she pouted, \xe2\x80\x98I have only done half what you have done!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have only proved false through forgetfulness, but you have while\r\nremembering!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes; of course you can use Avice Caro as a retort. But don\xe2\x80\x99t vex\r\nme about her, and make me do such an unexpected thing as regret the\r\nfalseness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe shut her mouth tight, and her face flushed.\r\n\r\nThe next morning there did come an answer to the letter asking her\r\nparents\xe2\x80\x99 consent to her union with him; but to Marcia\xe2\x80\x99s amazement her\r\nfather took a line quite other than the one she had expected him to\r\ntake. Whether she had compromised herself or whether she had not seemed\r\na question for the future rather than the present with him, a native\r\nislander, born when old island marriage views prevailed in families; he\r\nwas fixed in his disapproval of her marriage with a hated Pierston. He\r\ndid not consent; he would not say more till he could see her: if she had\r\nany sense at all she would, if still unmarried, return to the home from\r\nwhich she had evidently been enticed. He would then see what he could\r\ndo for her in the desperate circumstances she had made for herself;\r\notherwise he would do nothing.\r\n\r\nPierston could not help being sarcastic at her father\xe2\x80\x99s evidently low\r\nestimate of him and his belongings; and Marcia took umbrage at his\r\nsarcasms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am the one deserving of satire if anybody!\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98I begin to\r\nfeel I was a foolish girl to run away from a father for such a trumpery\r\nreason as a little scolding because I had exceeded my allowance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I advised you to go back, Marcie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In a sort of way: not in the right tone. You spoke most contemptuously\r\nof my father\xe2\x80\x99s honesty as a merchant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak otherwise of him than I did, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, knowing\r\nwhat--\xe2\x80\x98.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have you to say against him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing--to you, Marcie, beyond what is matter of common notoriety.\r\nEverybody knows that at one time he made it the business of his life to\r\nruin my father; and the way he alludes to me in that letter shows that\r\nhis enmity still continues.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That miser ruined by an open-handed man like my father!\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nis like your people\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentations to say that!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMarcia\xe2\x80\x99s eyes flashed, and her face burnt with an angry heat, the\r\nenhanced beauty which this warmth might have brought being killed by the\r\nrectilinear sternness of countenance that came therewith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marcia--this temper is too exasperating! I could give you every step of\r\nthe proceeding in detail--anybody could--the getting the quarries one\r\nby one, and everything, my father only holding his own by the most\r\ndesperate courage. There is no blinking facts. Our parents\xe2\x80\x99 relations\r\nare an ugly fact in the circumstances of us two people who want to\r\nmarry, and we are just beginning to perceive it; and how we are going to\r\nget over it I cannot tell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe said steadily: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we shall get over it at all!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We may not--we may not--altogether,\xe2\x80\x99 Pierston murmured, as he gazed\r\nat the fine picture of scorn presented by his Juno\xe2\x80\x99s classical face and\r\ndark eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unless you beg my pardon for having behaved so!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston could not quite bring himself to see that he had behaved badly\r\nto his too imperious lady, and declined to ask forgiveness for what he\r\nhad not done.\r\n\r\nShe thereupon left the room. Later in the day she re-entered and broke\r\na silence by saying bitterly: \xe2\x80\x98I showed temper just now, as you told me.\r\nBut things have causes, and it is perhaps a mistake that you should have\r\ndeserted Avice for me. Instead of wedding Rosaline, Romeo must needs\r\ngo eloping with Juliet. It was a fortunate thing for the affections of\r\nthose two Veronese lovers that they died when they did. In a short time\r\nthe enmity of their families would have proved a fruitful source of\r\ndissension; Juliet would have gone back to her people, he to his; the\r\nsubject would have split them as much as it splits us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston laughed a little. But Marcia was painfully serious, as he found\r\nat tea-time, when she said that since his refusal to beg her pardon she\r\nhad been thinking over the matter, and had resolved to go to her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nafter all--at any rate till her father could be induced to agree to\r\ntheir union. Pierston was as chilled by this resolve of hers as he was\r\nsurprised at her independence in circumstances which usually make\r\nwomen the reverse. But he put no obstacles in her way, and, with a kiss\r\nstrangely cold after their recent ardour, the Romeo of the freestone\r\nMontagues went out of the hotel, to avoid even the appearance of\r\ncoercing his Juliet of the rival house. When he returned she was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nA correspondence began between these too-hastily pledged ones; and\r\nit was carried on in terms of serious reasoning upon their awkward\r\nsituation on account of the family feud. They saw their recent love as\r\nwhat it was:\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x98Too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;\r\n      Too like the lightning...\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey saw it with an eye whose calmness, coldness, and, it must be added,\r\nwisdom, did not promise well for their reunion.\r\n\r\nTheir debates were clinched by a final letter from Marcia, sent from no\r\nother place than her recently left home in the Isle. She informed him\r\nthat her father had appeared suddenly at her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s, and had induced her\r\nto go home with him. She had told her father all the circumstances of\r\ntheir elopement, and what mere accidents had caused it: he had persuaded\r\nher on what she had almost been convinced of by their disagreement,\r\nthat all thought of their marriage should be at least postponed for the\r\npresent; any awkwardness and even scandal being better than that they\r\nshould immediately unite themselves for life on the strength of a two\r\nor three days\xe2\x80\x99 resultless passion, and be the wretched victims of a\r\nsituation they could never change.\r\n\r\nPierston saw plainly enough that he owed it to her father being a\r\nborn islander, with all the ancient island notions of matrimony lying\r\nunderneath his acquired conventions, that the stone-merchant did not\r\nimmediately insist upon the usual remedy for a daughter\xe2\x80\x99s precipitancy\r\nin such cases, but preferred to await issues.\r\n\r\nBut the young man still thought that Marcia herself, when her temper\r\nhad quite cooled, and she was more conscious of her real position, would\r\nreturn to him, in spite of the family hostility. There was no social\r\nreason against such a step. In birth the pair were about on one plane;\r\nand though Marcia\xe2\x80\x99s family had gained a start in the accumulation of\r\nwealth, and in the beginnings of social distinction, which lent colour\r\nto the feeling that the advantages of the match would be mainly on\r\none side, Pierston was a sculptor who might rise to fame; so that\r\npotentially their marriage could not be considered inauspicious for a\r\nwoman who, beyond being the probable heiress to a considerable fortune,\r\nhad no exceptional opportunities.\r\n\r\nThus, though disillusioned, he felt bound in honour to remain on call at\r\nhis London address as long as there was the slightest chance of Marcia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreappearance, or of the arrival of some message requesting him to join\r\nher, that they might, after all, go to the altar together. Yet in the\r\nnight he seemed to hear sardonic voices, and laughter in the wind\r\nat this development of his little romance, and during the slow and\r\ncolourless days he had to sit and behold the mournful departure of his\r\nWell-Beloved from the form he had lately cherished, till she had almost\r\nvanished away. The exact moment of her complete withdrawal Pierston\r\nknew not, but not many lines of her were longer discernible in Marcia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nremembered contours, nor many sounds of her in Marcia\xe2\x80\x99s recalled\r\naccents. Their acquaintance, though so fervid, had been too brief for\r\nsuch lingering.\r\n\r\nThere came a time when he learnt, through a trustworthy channel, two\r\npieces of news affecting himself. One was the marriage of Avice Caro\r\nwith her cousin, the other that the Bencombs had started on a tour round\r\nthe world, which was to include a visit to a relation of Mr. Bencomb\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwho was a banker in San Francisco. Since retiring from his former large\r\nbusiness the stone merchant had not known what to do with his leisure,\r\nand finding that travel benefited his health he had decided to indulge\r\nhimself thus. Although he was not so informed, Pierston concluded that\r\nMarcia had discovered that nothing was likely to happen as a consequence\r\nof their elopement, and that she had accompanied her parents. He was\r\nmore than ever struck with what this signified--her father\xe2\x80\x99s obstinate\r\nantagonism to her union with one of his blood and name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. IX. FAMILIAR PHENOMENA IN THE DISTANCE\r\n\r\nBy degrees Pierston began to trace again the customary lines of his\r\nexistence; and his profession occupied him much as of old. The next\r\nyear or two only once brought him tidings, through some residents at his\r\nformer home, of the movements of the Bencombs. The extended voyage\r\nof Marcia\xe2\x80\x99s parents had given them quite a zest for other scenes and\r\ncountries; and it was said that her father, a man still in vigorous\r\nhealth except at brief intervals, was utilizing the outlook which\r\nhis cosmopolitanism afforded him by investing capital in foreign\r\nundertakings. What he had supposed turned out to be true; Marcia\r\nwas with them; no necessity for joining him had arisen; and thus the\r\nseparation of himself and his nearly married wife by common consent was\r\nlikely to be a permanent one.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if he would scarce ever again discover the carnate\r\ndwelling-place of the haunting minion of his imagination. Having gone so\r\nnear to matrimony with Marcia as to apply for a licence, he had felt for\r\na long while morally bound to her by the incipient contract, and would\r\nnot intentionally look about him in search of the vanished Ideality.\r\nThus during the first year of Miss Bencomb\xe2\x80\x99s absence, when absolutely\r\nbound to keep faith with the elusive one\xe2\x80\x99s late incarnation if she\r\nshould return to claim him, this man of the odd fancy would sometimes\r\ntremble at the thought of what would become of his solemn intention if\r\nthe Phantom were suddenly to disclose herself in an unexpected quarter,\r\nand seduce him before he was aware. Once or twice he imagined that he\r\nsaw her in the distance--at the end of a street, on the far sands of\r\na shore, in a window, in a meadow, at the opposite side of a railway\r\nstation; but he determinedly turned on his heel, and walked the other\r\nway.\r\n\r\nDuring the many uneventful seasons that followed Marcia\xe2\x80\x99s stroke of\r\nindependence (for which he was not without a secret admiration at\r\ntimes), Jocelyn threw into plastic creations that ever-bubbling spring\r\nof emotion which, without some conduit into space, will surge upwards\r\nand ruin all but the greatest men. It was probably owing to this,\r\ncertainly not on account of any care or anxiety for such a result, that\r\nhe was successful in his art, successful by a seemingly sudden spurt,\r\nwhich carried him at one bound over the hindrances of years.\r\n\r\nHe prospered without effort. He was A.R.A.\r\n\r\nBut recognitions of this sort, social distinctions, which he had\r\nonce coveted so keenly, seemed to have no utility for him now. By the\r\naccident of being a bachelor, he was floating in society without any\r\nsoul-anchorage or shrine that he could call his own; and, for want of\r\na domestic centre round which honours might crystallize, they dispersed\r\nimpalpably without accumulating and adding weight to his material\r\nwell-being.\r\n\r\nHe would have gone on working with his chisel with just as much zest if\r\nhis creations had been doomed to meet no mortal eye but his own. This\r\nindifference to the popular reception of his dream-figures lent him a\r\ncurious artistic aplomb that carried him through the gusts of opinion\r\nwithout suffering them to disturb his inherent bias.\r\n\r\nThe study of beauty was his only joy for years onward. In the streets he\r\nwould observe a face, or a fraction of a face, which seemed to express\r\nto a hair\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth in mutable flesh what he was at that moment wishing\r\nto express in durable shape. He would dodge and follow the owner like\r\na detective; in omnibus, in cab, in steam-boat, through crowds, into\r\nshops, churches, theatres, public-houses, and slums--mostly, when at\r\nclose quarters, to be disappointed for his pains.\r\n\r\nIn these professional beauty-chases he sometimes cast his eye across\r\nthe Thames to the wharves on the south side, and to that particular\r\none whereat his father\xe2\x80\x99s tons of freestone were daily landed from the\r\nketches of the south coast. He could occasionally discern the white\r\nblocks lying there, vast cubes so persistently nibbled by his parent\r\nfrom his island rock in the English Channel, that it seemed as if in\r\ntime it would be nibbled all away.\r\n\r\nOne thing it passed him to understand: on what field of observation the\r\npoets and philosophers based their assumption that the passion of love\r\nwas intensest in youth and burnt lower as maturity advanced. It was\r\npossibly because of his utter domestic loneliness that, during\r\nthe productive interval which followed the first years of Marcia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeparture, when he was drifting along from five-and-twenty to\r\neight-and-thirty, Pierston occasionally loved with an ardour--though, it\r\nis true, also with a self-control--unknown to him when he was green in\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nHis whimsical isle-bred fancy had grown to be such an emotion that the\r\nWell-Beloved--now again visible--was always existing somewhere near him.\r\nFor months he would find her on the stage of a theatre: then she would\r\nflit away, leaving the poor, empty carcase that had lodged her to mumm\r\non as best it could without her--a sorry lay figure to his eyes, heaped\r\nwith imperfections and sullied with commonplace. She would reappear, it\r\nmight be, in an at first unnoticed lady, met at some fashionable evening\r\nparty, exhibition, bazaar, or dinner; to flit from her, in turn, after\r\na few months, and stand as a graceful shop-girl at some large drapery\r\nwarehouse into which he had strayed on an unaccustomed errand. Then she\r\nwould forsake this figure and redisclose herself in the guise of some\r\npopular authoress, piano-player, or fiddleress, at whose shrine he would\r\nworship for perhaps a twelvemonth. Once she was a dancing-girl at the\r\nRoyal Moorish Palace of Varieties, though during her whole continuance\r\nat that establishment he never once exchanged a word with her, nor\r\ndid she first or last ever dream of his existence. He knew that a\r\nten-minutes\xe2\x80\x99 conversation in the wings with the substance would send\r\nthe elusive haunter scurrying fearfully away into some other even less\r\naccessible mask-figure.\r\n\r\nShe was a blonde, a brunette, tall, petite, svelte, straight-featured,\r\nfull, curvilinear. Only one quality remained unalterable: her\r\ninstability of tenure. In Borne\xe2\x80\x99s phrase, nothing was permanent in her\r\nbut change.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is odd,\xe2\x80\x99 he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x98that this experience of mine, or\r\nidiosyncrasy, or whatever it is, which would be sheer waste of time\r\nfor other men, creates sober business for me.\xe2\x80\x99 For all these dreams he\r\ntranslated into plaster, and found that by them he was hitting a public\r\ntaste he had never deliberately aimed at, and mostly despised. He was,\r\nin short, in danger of drifting away from a solid artistic reputation to\r\na popularity which might possibly be as brief as it would be brilliant\r\nand exciting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will be caught some day, my friend,\xe2\x80\x99 Somers would occasionally\r\nobserve to him. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say entangled in anything\r\ndiscreditable, for I admit that you are in practice as ideal as\r\nin theory. I mean the process will be reversed. Some woman, whose\r\nWell-Beloved flits about as yours does now, will catch your eye, and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll stick to her like a limpet, while she follows her Phantom and\r\nleaves you to ache as you will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may be right; but I think you are wrong,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pierston. \xe2\x80\x98As\r\nflesh she dies daily, like the Apostle\xe2\x80\x99s corporeal self; because when I\r\ngrapple with the reality she\xe2\x80\x99s no longer in it, so that I cannot stick\r\nto one incarnation if I would.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wait till you are older,\xe2\x80\x99 said Somers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SECOND -- A YOUNG MAN OF FORTY\r\n\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98Since Love will needs that I shall love,\r\n      Of very force I must agree:\r\n      And since no chance may it remove\r\n      In wealth and in adversity\r\n      I shall alway myself apply\r\n      To serve and suffer patiently.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n                                 --Sir T. Wyatt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. I. THE OLD PHANTOM BECOMES DISTINCT\r\n\r\nIn the course of these long years Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s artistic emotions\r\nwere abruptly suspended by the news of his father\xe2\x80\x99s sudden death at\r\nSandbourne, whither the stone-merchant had gone for a change of air by\r\nthe advice of his physician.\r\n\r\nMr. Pierston, senior, it must be admitted, had been something miserly\r\nin his home life, as Marcia had so rashly reminded his son. But he had\r\nnever stinted Jocelyn. He had been rather a hard taskmaster, though as a\r\npaymaster trustworthy; a ready-money man, just and ungenerous. To every\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s surprise, the capital he had accumulated in the stone trade was of\r\nlarge amount for a business so unostentatiously carried on--much larger\r\nthan Jocelyn had ever regarded as possible. While the son had been\r\nmodelling and chipping his ephemeral fancies into perennial shapes, the\r\nfather had been persistently chiselling for half a century at the\r\ncrude original matter of those shapes, the stern, isolated rock in the\r\nChannel; and by the aid of his cranes and pulleys, his trolleys and\r\nhis boats, had sent off his spoil to all parts of Great Britain.\r\nWhen Jocelyn had wound up everything and disposed of the business, as\r\nrecommended by his father\xe2\x80\x99s will, he found himself enabled to add about\r\neighty thousand pounds to the twelve thousand which he already possessed\r\nfrom professional and other sources.\r\n\r\nAfter arranging for the sale of some freehold properties in the island\r\nother than quarries--for he did not intend to reside there--he returned\r\nto town. He often wondered what had become of Marcia. He had promised\r\nnever to trouble her; nor for a whole twenty years had he done so;\r\nthough he had often sighed for her as a friend of sterling common sense\r\nin practical difficulties.\r\n\r\nHer parents were, he believed, dead; and she, he knew, had never gone\r\nback to the isle. Possibly she had formed some new tie abroad, and had\r\nmade it next to impossible to discover her by her old name.\r\n\r\nA reposeful time ensued. Almost his first entry into society after his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s death occurred one evening, when, for want of knowing what\r\nbetter to do, he responded to an invitation sent by one of the few\r\nladies of rank whom he numbered among his friends, and set out in a\r\ncab for the square wherein she lived during three or four months of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe hansom turned the corner, and he obtained a raking view of the\r\nhouses along the north side, of which hers was one, with the familiar\r\nlinkman at the door. There were Chinese lanterns, too, on the balcony.\r\nHe perceived in a moment that the customary \xe2\x80\x98small and early\xe2\x80\x99 reception\r\nhad resolved itself on this occasion into something very like great and\r\nlate. He remembered that there had just been a political crisis,\r\nwhich accounted for the enlargement of the Countess of Channelcliffe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassembly; for hers was one of the neutral or non-political houses at\r\nwhich party politics are more freely agitated than at the professedly\r\nparty gatherings.\r\n\r\nThere was such a string of carriages that Pierston did not wait to take\r\nhis turn at the door, but unobtrusively alighted some yards off and\r\nwalked forward. He had to pause a moment behind the wall of spectators\r\nwhich barred his way, and as he paused some ladies in white cloaks\r\ncrossed from their carriages to the door on the carpet laid for the\r\npurpose. He had not seen their faces, nothing of them but vague forms,\r\nand yet he was suddenly seized with a presentiment. Its gist was that\r\nhe might be going to re-encounter the Well-Beloved that night: after her\r\nrecent long hiding she meant to reappear and intoxicate him. That liquid\r\nsparkle of her eye, that lingual music, that turn of the head, how well\r\nhe knew it all, despite the many superficial changes, and how instantly\r\nhe would recognize it under whatever complexion, contour, accent,\r\nheight, or carriage that it might choose to masquerade!\r\n\r\nPierston\xe2\x80\x99s other conjecture, that the night was to be a lively political\r\none, received confirmation as soon as he reached the hall, where a\r\nsimmer of excitement was perceptible as surplus or overflow from above\r\ndown the staircase--a feature which he had always noticed to be present\r\nwhen any climax or sensation had been reached in the world of party and\r\nfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And where have you been keeping yourself so long, young man?\xe2\x80\x99 said his\r\nhostess archly, when he had shaken hands with her. (Pierston was always\r\nregarded as a young man, though he was now about forty.) \xe2\x80\x98O yes, of\r\ncourse, I remember,\xe2\x80\x99 she added, looking serious in a moment at thought\r\nof his loss. The Countess was a woman with a good-natured manner\r\nverging on that oft-claimed feminine quality, humour, and was quickly\r\nsympathetic.\r\n\r\nShe then began to tell him of a scandal in the political side to which\r\nshe nominally belonged, one that had come out of the present crisis;\r\nand that, as for herself, she had sworn to abjure politics for ever on\r\naccount of it, so that he was to regard her forthwith as a more\r\nneutral householder than ever. By this time some more people had surged\r\nupstairs, and Pierston prepared to move on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are looking for somebody--I can see that,\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--a lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pierston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me her name, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to think if she\xe2\x80\x99s here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know it,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed! What is she like?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot describe her, not even her complexion or dress.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLady Channelcliffe looked a pout, as if she thought he were teasing\r\nher, and he moved on in the current. The fact was that, for a moment,\r\nPierston fancied he had made the sensational discovery that the One\r\nhe was in search of lurked in the person of the very hostess he had\r\nconversed with, who was charming always, and particularly charming\r\nto-night; he was just feeling an incipient consternation at the\r\npossibility of such a jade\xe2\x80\x99s trick in his Beloved, who had once before\r\nchosen to embody herself as a married woman, though, happily, at\r\nthat time with no serious results. However, he felt that he had been\r\nmistaken, and that the fancy had been solely owing to the highly charged\r\nelectric condition in which he had arrived by reason of his recent\r\nisolation.\r\n\r\nThe whole set of rooms formed one great utterance of the opinions of the\r\nhour. The gods of party were present with their embattled seraphim, but\r\nthe brilliancy of manner and form in the handling of public questions\r\nwas only less conspicuous than the paucity of original ideas. No\r\nprinciples of wise government had place in any mind, a blunt and jolly\r\npersonalism as to the Ins and Outs animating all. But Jocelyn\xe2\x80\x99s interest\r\ndid not run in this stream: he was like a stone in a purling brook,\r\nwaiting for some peculiar floating object to be brought towards him and\r\nto stick upon his mental surface.\r\n\r\nThus looking for the next new version of the fair figure, he did not\r\nconsider at the moment, though he had done so at other times, that this\r\npresentiment of meeting her was, of all presentiments, just the sort of\r\none to work out its own fulfilment.\r\n\r\nHe looked for her in the knot of persons gathered round a past Prime\r\nMinister who was standing in the middle of the largest room discoursing\r\nin the genial, almost jovial, manner natural to him at these times. The\r\ntwo or three ladies forming his audience had been joined by another\r\nin black and white, and it was on her that Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s attention was\r\ndirected, as well as the great statesman\xe2\x80\x99s, whose first sheer gaze\r\nat her, expressing \xe2\x80\x98Who are you?\xe2\x80\x99 almost audibly, changed into an\r\ninterested, listening look as the few words she spoke were uttered--for\r\nthe Minister differed from many of his standing in being extremely\r\ncareful not to interrupt a timid speaker, giving way in an instant if\r\nanybody else began with him. Nobody knew better than himself that all\r\nmay learn, and his manner was that of an unconceited man who could catch\r\nan idea readily, even if he could not undertake to create one.\r\n\r\nThe lady told her little story--whatever it was Jocelyn could not hear\r\nit--the statesman laughed: \xe2\x80\x98Haugh-haugh-haugh!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe lady blushed. Jocelyn, wrought up to a high tension by the aforesaid\r\npresentiment that his Shelleyan \xe2\x80\x98One-shape-of-many-names\xe2\x80\x99 was about to\r\nreappear, paid little heed to the others, watching for a full view of\r\nthe lady who had won his attention.\r\n\r\nThat lady remained for the present partially screened by her neighbours.\r\nA diversion was caused by Lady Channelcliffe bringing up somebody to\r\npresent to the ex-Minister; the ladies got mixed, and Jocelyn lost sight\r\nof the one whom he was beginning to suspect as the stealthily returned\r\nabsentee.\r\n\r\nHe looked for her in a kindly young lady of the house, his hostess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrelation, who appeared to more advantage that night than she had ever\r\ndone before--in a sky-blue dress, which had nothing between it and the\r\nfair skin of her neck, lending her an unusually soft and sylph-like\r\naspect. She saw him, and they converged. Her look of \xe2\x80\x98What do you think\r\nof me NOW?\xe2\x80\x99 was suggested, he knew, by the thought that the last time\r\nthey met she had appeared under the disadvantage of mourning clothes, on\r\na wet day in a country-house, where everybody was cross.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have some new photographs, and I want you to tell me whether they are\r\ngood,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98Mind you are to tell me truly, and no favour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe produced the pictures from an adjoining drawer, and they sat down\r\ntogether upon an ottoman for the purpose of examination. The portraits,\r\ntaken by the last fashionable photographer, were very good, and he\r\ntold her so; but as he spoke and compared them his mind was fixed on\r\nsomething else than the mere judgment. He wondered whether the elusive\r\none were indeed in the frame of this girl.\r\n\r\nHe looked up at her. To his surprise, her mind, too, was on other\r\nthings bent than on the pictures. Her eyes were glancing away to distant\r\npeople, she was apparently considering the effect she was producing upon\r\nthem by this cosy tete-a-tete with Pierston, and upon one in particular,\r\na man of thirty, of military appearance, whom Pierston did not know.\r\nQuite convinced now that no phantom belonging to him was contained in\r\nthe outlines of the present young lady, he could coolly survey her as he\r\nresponded. They were both doing the same thing--each was pretending to\r\nbe deeply interested in what the other was talking about, the attention\r\nof the two alike flitting away to other corners of the room even when\r\nthe very point of their discourse was pending.\r\n\r\nNo, he had not seen Her yet. He was not going to see her, apparently,\r\nto-night; she was scared away by the twanging political atmosphere.\r\nBut he still moved on searchingly, hardly heeding certain spectral imps\r\nother than Aphroditean, who always haunted these places, and jeeringly\r\npointed out that under the white hair of this or that ribanded old\r\nman, with a forehead grown wrinkled over treaties which had swayed the\r\nfortunes of Europe, with a voice which had numbered sovereigns among its\r\nrespectful listeners, might be a heart that would go inside a nut-shell;\r\nthat beneath this or that white rope of pearl and pink bosom, might lie\r\nthe half-lung which had, by hook or by crook, to sustain its possessor\r\nabove-ground till the wedding-day.\r\n\r\nAt that moment he encountered his amiable host, and almost\r\nsimultaneously caught sight of the lady who had at first attracted him\r\nand then had disappeared. Their eyes met, far off as they were from each\r\nother. Pierston laughed inwardly: it was only in ticklish excitement as\r\nto whether this was to prove a true trouvaille, and with no instinct\r\nto mirth; for when under the eyes of his Jill-o\xe2\x80\x99-the-Wisp he was more\r\ninclined to palpitate like a sheep in a fair.\r\n\r\nHowever, for the minute he had to converse with his host, Lord\r\nChannelcliffe, and almost the first thing that friend said to him was:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is that pretty woman in the black dress with the white fluff about\r\nit and the pearl necklace?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jocelyn, with incipient jealousy: \xe2\x80\x98I was just going\r\nto ask the same thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, we shall find out presently, I suppose. I daresay my wife knows.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThey had parted, when a hand came upon his shoulder. Lord Channelcliffe\r\nhad turned back for an instant: \xe2\x80\x98I find she is the granddaughter of my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s old friend, the last Lord Hengistbury. Her name is Mrs.--Mrs.\r\nPine-Avon; she lost her husband two or three years ago, very shortly\r\nafter their marriage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLord Channelcliffe became absorbed into some adjoining dignitary of the\r\nChurch, and Pierston was left to pursue his quest alone. A young friend\r\nof his--the Lady Mabella Buttermead, who appeared in a cloud of muslin\r\nand was going on to a ball--had been brought against him by the tide.\r\nA warm-hearted, emotional girl was Lady Mabella, who laughed at the\r\nhumorousness of being alive. She asked him whither he was bent, and he\r\ntold her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes, I know her very well!\xe2\x80\x99 said Lady Mabella eagerly. \xe2\x80\x98She told\r\nme one day that she particularly wished to meet you. Poor thing--so\r\nsad--she lost her husband. Well, it was a long time ago now, certainly.\r\nWomen ought not to marry and lay themselves open to such catastrophes,\r\nought they, Mr. Pierston? _I_ never shall. I am determined never to run\r\nsuch a risk! Now, do you think I shall?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marry? O no; never,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pierston drily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s very satisfying.\xe2\x80\x99 But Mabella was scarcely comfortable under his\r\nanswer, even though jestingly returned, and she added: \xe2\x80\x98But sometimes I\r\nthink I may, just for the fun of it. Now we\xe2\x80\x99ll steer across to her, and\r\ncatch her, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll introduce you. But we shall never get to her at this\r\nrate!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never, unless we adopt \xe2\x80\x9cthe ugly rush,\xe2\x80\x9d like the citizens who follow\r\nthe Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s Show.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey talked, and inched towards the desired one, who, as she discoursed\r\nwith a neighbour, seemed to be of those--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98Female forms, whose gestures beam with mind,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nseen by the poet in his Vision of the Golden City of Islam.\r\n\r\nTheir progress was continually checked. Pierston was as he had sometimes\r\nseemed to be in a dream, unable to advance towards the object of pursuit\r\nunless he could have gathered up his feet into the air. After ten\r\nminutes given to a preoccupied regard of shoulder-blades, back hair,\r\nglittering headgear, neck-napes, moles, hairpins, pearl-powder, pimples,\r\nminerals cut into facets of many-coloured rays, necklace-clasps, fans,\r\nstays, the seven styles of elbow and arm, the thirteen varieties of\r\near; and by using the toes of his dress-boots as coulters with which\r\nhe ploughed his way and that of Lady Mabella in the direction they were\r\naiming at, he drew near to Mrs. Pine-Avon, who was drinking a cup of tea\r\nin the back drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Nichola, we thought we should never get to you, because it is\r\nworse to-night, owing to these dreadful politics! But we\xe2\x80\x99ve done it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd she proceeded to tell her friend of Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s existence hard by.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that the widow really did wish to know him, and that\r\nLady Mabella Buttermead had not indulged in one of the too frequent\r\ninventions in that kind. When the youngest of the trio had made the pair\r\nacquainted with each other she left them to talk to a younger man than\r\nthe sculptor.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pine-Avon\xe2\x80\x99s black velvets and silks, with their white\r\naccompaniments, finely set off the exceeding fairness of her neck and\r\nshoulders, which, though unwhitened artificially, were without a speck\r\nor blemish of the least degree. The gentle, thoughtful creature she had\r\nlooked from a distance she now proved herself to be; she held also sound\r\nrather than current opinions on the plastic arts, and was the first\r\nintellectual woman he had seen there that night, except one or two as\r\naforesaid.\r\n\r\nThey soon became well acquainted, and at a pause in their conversation\r\nnoticed the fresh excitement caused by the arrival of some late comers\r\nwith more news. The latter had been brought by a rippling, bright-eyed\r\nlady in black, who made the men listen to her, whether they would or no.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad I am an outsider,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jocelyn\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance, now seated on\r\na sofa beside which he was standing. \xe2\x80\x98I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be like my cousin, over\r\nthere, for the world. She thinks her husband will be turned out at the\r\nnext election, and she\xe2\x80\x99s quite wild.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; it is mostly the women who are the gamesters; the men only the\r\ncards. The pity is that politics are looked on as being a game for\r\npoliticians, just as cricket is a game for cricketers; not as the\r\nserious duties of political trustees.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How few of us ever think or feel that \xe2\x80\x9cthe nation of every country\r\ndwells in the cottage,\xe2\x80\x9d as somebody says!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Though I wonder to hear you quote that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O--I am of no party, though my relations are. There can be only\r\none best course at all times, and the wisdom of the nation should be\r\ndirected to finding it, instead of zigzagging in two courses, according\r\nto the will of the party which happens to have the upper hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving started thus, they found no difficulty in agreeing on many\r\npoints. When Pierston went downstairs from that assembly at a quarter to\r\none, and passed under the steaming nostrils of an ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s horses to\r\na hansom which waited for him against the railing of the square, he had\r\nan impression that the Beloved had re-emerged from the shadows, without\r\nany hint or initiative from him--to whom, indeed, such re-emergence was\r\nan unquestionably awkward thing.\r\n\r\nIn this he was aware, however, that though it might be now, as\r\nheretofore, the Loved who danced before him, it was the Goddess behind\r\nher who pulled the string of that Jumping Jill. He had lately been\r\ntrying his artist hand again on the Dea\xe2\x80\x99s form in every conceivable\r\nphase and mood. He had become a one-part man--a presenter of her only.\r\nBut his efforts had resulted in failures. In her implacable vanity she\r\nmight be punishing him anew for presenting her so deplorably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. II. SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES\r\n\r\nHe could not forget Mrs. Pine-Avon\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, though he remembered nothing\r\nof her other facial details. They were round, inquiring, luminous. How\r\nthat chestnut hair of hers had shone: it required no tiara to set\r\nit off, like that of the dowager he had seen there, who had put ten\r\nthousand pounds upon her head to make herself look worse than she would\r\nhave appeared with the ninepenny muslin cap of a servant woman.\r\n\r\nNow the question was, ought he to see her again? He had his doubts. But,\r\nunfortunately for discretion, just when he was coming out of the\r\nrooms he had encountered an old lady of seventy, his friend Mrs.\r\nBrightwalton--the Honourable Mrs. Brightwalton--and she had hastily\r\nasked him to dinner for the day after the morrow, stating in the honest\r\nway he knew so well that she had heard he was out of town, or she would\r\nhave asked him two or three weeks ago. Now, of all social things that\r\nPierston liked it was to be asked to dinner off-hand, as a stopgap in\r\nplace of some bishop, earl, or Under-Secretary who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come, and\r\nwhen the invitation was supplemented by the tidings that the lady\r\nwho had so impressed him was to be one of the guests, he had promised\r\ninstantly.\r\n\r\nAt the dinner, he took down Mrs. Pine-Avon upon his arm and talked to\r\nnobody else during the meal. Afterwards they kept apart awhile in the\r\ndrawing-room for form\xe2\x80\x99s sake; but eventually gravitated together again,\r\nand finished the evening in each other\xe2\x80\x99s company. When, shortly after\r\neleven, he came away, he felt almost certain that within those luminous\r\ngrey eyes the One of his eternal fidelity had verily taken lodgings--and\r\nfor a long lease. But this was not all. At parting, he had, almost\r\ninvoluntarily, given her hand a pressure of a peculiar and indescribable\r\nkind; a little response from her, like a mere pulsation, of the\r\nsame sort, told him that the impression she had made upon him was\r\nreciprocated. She was, in a word, willing to go on.\r\n\r\nBut was he able?\r\n\r\nThere had not been much harm in the flirtation thus far; but did she\r\nknow his history, the curse upon his nature?--that he was the Wandering\r\nJew of the love-world, how restlessly ideal his fancies were, how the\r\nartist in him had consumed the wooer, how he was in constant dread lest\r\nhe should wrong some woman twice as good as himself by seeming to mean\r\nwhat he fain would mean but could not, how useless he was likely to be\r\nfor practical steps towards householding, though he was all the while\r\npining for domestic life. He was now over forty, she was probably\r\nthirty; and he dared not make unmeaning love with the careless\r\nselfishness of a younger man. It was unfair to go further without\r\ntelling her, even though, hitherto, such explicitness had not been\r\nabsolutely demanded.\r\n\r\nHe determined to call immediately on the New Incarnation.\r\n\r\nShe lived not far from the long, fashionable Hamptonshire Square, and\r\nhe went thither with expectations of having a highly emotional time, at\r\nleast. But somehow the very bell-pull seemed cold, although she had so\r\nearnestly asked him to come.\r\n\r\nAs the house spoke, so spoke the occupant, much to the astonishment of\r\nthe sculptor. The doors he passed through seemed as if they had not been\r\nopened for a month; and entering the large drawing-room, he beheld, in\r\nan arm-chair, in the far distance, a lady whom he journeyed across\r\nthe carpet to reach, and ultimately did reach. To be sure it was Mrs.\r\nNichola Pine-Avon, but frosted over indescribably. Raising her eyes in a\r\nslightly inquiring manner from the book she was reading, she leant back\r\nin the chair, as if soaking herself in luxurious sensations which\r\nhad nothing to do with him, and replied to his greeting with a few\r\ncommonplace words.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Jocelyn, though recuperative to a degree, was at first\r\nterribly upset by this reception. He had distinctly begun to love\r\nNichola, and he felt sick and almost resentful. But happily his\r\naffection was incipient as yet, and a sudden sense of the ridiculous\r\nin his own position carried him to the verge of risibility during the\r\nscene. She signified a chair, and began the critical study of some rings\r\nshe wore.\r\n\r\nThey talked over the day\xe2\x80\x99s news, and then an organ began to grind\r\noutside. The tune was a rollicking air he had heard at some music-hall;\r\nand, by way of a diversion, he asked her if she knew the composition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you all about it,\xe2\x80\x99 said he gravely. \xe2\x80\x98It is based on a\r\nsound old melody called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jilt\xe2\x80\x99s Hornpipe.\xe2\x80\x9d Just as they turn Madeira\r\ninto port in the space of a single night, so this old air has been\r\ntaken and doctored, and twisted about, and brought out as a new popular\r\nditty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you are in the habit of going much to the music-halls or the\r\nburlesque theatres--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You would find this is often done, with excellent effect.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe thawed a little, and then they went on to talk about her house,\r\nwhich had been newly painted, and decorated with greenish-blue satin up\r\nto the height of a person\xe2\x80\x99s head--an arrangement that somewhat improved\r\nher slightly faded, though still pretty, face, and was helped by the\r\nawnings over the windows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; I have had my house some years,\xe2\x80\x99 she observed complacently, \xe2\x80\x98and I\r\nlike it better every year.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel lonely in it sometimes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O never!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, before he rose she grew friendly to some degree, and when he\r\nleft, just after the arrival of three opportune young ladies she seemed\r\nregretful. She asked him to come again; and he thought he would tell\r\nthe truth. \xe2\x80\x98No: I shall not care to come again,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, in a tone\r\ninaudible to the young ladies.\r\n\r\nShe followed him to the door. \xe2\x80\x98What an uncivil thing to say!\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nmurmured in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is rather uncivil. Good-bye,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pierston.\r\n\r\nAs a punishment she did not ring the bell, but left him to find his way\r\nout as he could. \xe2\x80\x98Now what the devil this means I cannot tell,\xe2\x80\x99 he said\r\nto himself, reflecting stock-still for a moment on the stairs. And yet\r\nthe meaning was staring him in the face.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile one of the three young ladies had said, \xe2\x80\x98What interesting\r\nman was that, with his lovely head of hair? I saw him at Lady\r\nChannelcliffe\xe2\x80\x99s the other night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jocelyn Pierston.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, Nichola, that IS too bad! To let him go in that shabby way, when I\r\nwould have given anything to know him! I have wanted to know him ever\r\nsince I found out how much his experiences had dictated his statuary,\r\nand I discovered them by seeing in a Jersey paper of the marriage of\r\na person supposed to be his wife, who ran off with him many years ago,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you know, and then wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry him, in obedience to some novel\r\nsocial principles she had invented for herself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O! didn\xe2\x80\x99t he marry her?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Pine-Avon, with a start. \xe2\x80\x98Why, I\r\nheard only yesterday that he did, though they have lived apart ever\r\nsince.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite a mistake,\xe2\x80\x99 said the young lady. \xe2\x80\x98How I wish I could run after\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Jocelyn was receding from the pretty widow\xe2\x80\x99s house with long\r\nstrides. He went out very little during the next few days, but about a\r\nweek later he kept an engagement to dine with Lady Iris Speedwell, whom\r\nhe never neglected, because she was the brightest hostess in London.\r\n\r\nBy some accident he arrived rather early. Lady Iris had left the\r\ndrawing-room for a moment to see that all was right in the dining-room,\r\nand when he was shown in there stood alone in the lamplight Nichola\r\nPine-Avon. She had been the first arrival. He had not in the least\r\nexpected to meet her there, further than that, in a general sense, at\r\nLady Iris\xe2\x80\x99s you expected to meet everybody.\r\n\r\nShe had just come out of the cloak-room, and was so tender and even\r\napologetic that he had not the heart to be other than friendly. As the\r\nother guests dropped in, the pair retreated into a shady corner, and she\r\ntalked beside him till all moved off for the eating and drinking.\r\n\r\nHe had not been appointed to take her across to the dining-room, but at\r\nthe table found her exactly opposite. She looked very charming between\r\nthe candles, and then suddenly it dawned upon him that her previous\r\nmanner must have originated in some false report about Marcia, of whose\r\nexistence he had not heard for years. Anyhow, he was not disposed to\r\nresent an inexplicability in womankind, having found that it usually\r\narose independently of fact, reason, probability, or his own deserts.\r\n\r\nSo he dined on, catching her eyes and the few pretty words she made\r\nopportunity to project across the table to him now and then. He was\r\ncourteously responsive only, but Mrs. Pine-Avon herself distinctly made\r\nadvances. He re-admired her, while at the same time her conduct in her\r\nown house had been enough to check his confidence--enough even to make\r\nhim doubt if the Well-Beloved really resided within those contours,\r\nor had ever been more than the most transitory passenger through that\r\ninteresting and accomplished soul.\r\n\r\nHe was pondering this question, yet growing decidedly moved by the\r\nplayful pathos of her attitude when, by chance, searching his pocket\r\nfor his handkerchief, something crackled, and he felt there an unopened\r\nletter, which had arrived at the moment he was leaving his house, and he\r\nhad slipped into his coat to read in the cab as he drove along. Pierston\r\ndrew it sufficiently forth to observe by the post-mark that it came from\r\nhis natal isle. Having hardly a correspondent in that part of the world\r\nnow he began to conjecture on the possible sender.\r\n\r\nThe lady on his right, whom he had brought in, was a leading actress of\r\nthe town--indeed, of the United Kingdom and America, for that matter--a\r\ncreature in airy clothing, translucent, like a balsam or sea-anemone,\r\nwithout shadows, and in movement as responsive as some highly\r\nlubricated, many-wired machine, which, if one presses a particular\r\nspring, flies open and reveals its works. The spring in the present\r\ncase was the artistic commendation she deserved and craved. At this\r\nparticular moment she was engaged with the man on her own right, a\r\nrepresentative of Family, who talked positively and hollowly, as if\r\nshouting down a vista of five hundred years from the Feudal past. The\r\nlady on Jocelyn\xe2\x80\x99s left, wife of a Lord Justice of Appeal, was in like\r\nmanner talking to her companion on the outer side; so that, for the\r\ntime, he was left to himself. He took advantage of the opportunity, drew\r\nout his letter, and read it as it lay upon his napkin, nobody observing\r\nhim, so far as he was aware.\r\n\r\nIt came from the wife of one of his father\xe2\x80\x99s former workmen, and was\r\nconcerning her son, whom she begged Jocelyn to recommend as candidate\r\nfor some post in town that she wished him to fill. But the end of the\r\nletter was what arrested him--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will be sorry to hear, Sir, that dear little Avice Caro, as we used\r\nto call her in her maiden days, is dead. She married her cousin, if you\r\ndo mind, and went away from here for a good-few years, but was left\r\na widow, and came back a twelvemonth ago; since when she faltered and\r\nfaltered, and now she is gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. III. SHE BECOMES AN INACCESSIBLE GHOST\r\n\r\nBy imperceptible and slow degrees the scene at the dinner-table receded\r\ninto the background, behind the vivid presentment of Avice Caro, and\r\nthe old, old scenes on Isle Vindilia which were inseparable from her\r\npersonality. The dining room was real no more, dissolving under the bold\r\nstony promontory and the incoming West Sea. The handsome marchioness in\r\ngeranium-red and diamonds, who was visible to him on his host\xe2\x80\x99s right\r\nhand opposite, became one of the glowing vermilion sunsets that he had\r\nwatched so many times over Deadman\xe2\x80\x99s Bay, with the form of Avice in the\r\nforeground. Between his eyes and the judge who sat next to Nichola, with\r\na chin so raw that he must have shaved every quarter of an hour during\r\nthe day, intruded the face of Avice, as she had glanced at him in their\r\nlast parting. The crannied features of the evergreen society lady, who,\r\nif she had been a few years older, would have been as old-fashioned as\r\nher daughter, shaped themselves to the dusty quarries of his and Avice\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nparents, down which he had clambered with Avice hundreds of times. The\r\nivy trailing about the table-cloth, the lights in the tall candlesticks,\r\nand the bunches of flowers, were transmuted into the ivies of the\r\ncliff-built Castle, the tufts of seaweed, and the lighthouses on the\r\nisle. The salt airs of the ocean killed the smell of the viands, and\r\ninstead of the clatter of voices came the monologue of the tide off the\r\nBeal.\r\n\r\nMore than all, Nichola Pine-Avon lost the blooming radiance which she\r\nhad latterly acquired; she became a woman of his acquaintance with no\r\ndistinctive traits; she seemed to grow material, a superficies of flesh\r\nand bone merely, a person of lines and surfaces; she was a language in\r\nliving cipher no more.\r\n\r\nWhen the ladies had withdrawn it was just the same. The soul of\r\nAvice--the only woman he had NEVER loved of those who had loved\r\nhim--surrounded him like a firmament. Art drew near to him in the person\r\nof one of the most distinguished of portrait painters; but there was\r\nonly one painter for Jocelyn--his own memory. All that was eminent\r\nin European surgery addressed him in the person of that harmless and\r\nunassuming fogey whose hands had been inside the bodies of hundreds of\r\nliving men; but the lily-white corpse of an obscure country-girl chilled\r\nthe interest of discourse with such a king of operators.\r\n\r\nReaching the drawing-room he talked to his hostess. Though she had\r\nentertained three-and-twenty guests at her table that night she had\r\nknown not only what every one of them was saying and doing throughout\r\nthe repast, but what every one was thinking. So, being an old friend,\r\nshe said quietly, \xe2\x80\x98What has been troubling you? Something has, I know. I\r\nhave been travelling over your face and have seen it there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNothing could less express the meaning his recent news had for him than\r\na statement of its facts. He told of the opening of the letter and the\r\ndiscovery of the death of an old acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The only woman whom I never rightly valued, I may almost say!\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nadded; \xe2\x80\x98and therefore the only one I shall ever regret!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhether she considered it a sufficient explanation or not the woman of\r\nexperiences accepted it as such. She was the single lady of his circle\r\nwhom nothing erratic in his doings could surprise, and he often gave her\r\nstray ends of his confidence thus with perfect safety.\r\n\r\nHe did not go near Mrs. Pine-Avon again; he could not: and on leaving\r\nthe house walked abstractedly along the streets till he found himself at\r\nhis own door. In his room he sat down, and placing his hands behind his\r\nhead thought his thoughts anew.\r\n\r\nAt one side of the room stood an escritoire, and from a lower drawer\r\ntherein he took out a small box tightly nailed down. He forced the cover\r\nwith the poker. The box contained a variety of odds and ends, which\r\nPierston had thrown into it from time to time in past years for future\r\nsorting--an intention that he had never carried out. From the melancholy\r\nmass of papers, faded photographs, seals, diaries, withered flowers,\r\nand such like, Jocelyn drew a little portrait, one taken on glass in the\r\nprimitive days of photography, and framed with tinsel in the commonest\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIt was Avice Caro, as she had appeared during the summer month or two\r\nwhich he had spent with her on the island twenty years before this time,\r\nher young lips pursed up, her hands meekly folded. The effect of the\r\nglass was to lend to the picture much of the softness characteristic of\r\nthe original. He remembered when it was taken--during one afternoon\r\nthey had spent together at a neighbouring watering-place, when he had\r\nsuggested her sitting to a touting artist on the sands, there being\r\nnothing else for them to do. A long contemplation of the likeness\r\ncompleted in his emotions what the letter had begun. He loved the woman\r\ndead and inaccessible as he had never loved her in life. He had thought\r\nof her but at distant intervals during the twenty years since that\r\nparting occurred, and only as somebody he could have wedded. Yet now the\r\ntimes of youthful friendship with her, in which he had learnt every\r\nnote of her innocent nature, flamed up into a yearning and passionate\r\nattachment, embittered by regret beyond words.\r\n\r\nThat kiss which had offended his dignity, which she had so childishly\r\ngiven him before her consciousness of womanhood had been awakened; what\r\nhe would have offered to have a quarter of it now!\r\n\r\nPierston was almost angry with himself for his feelings of this night,\r\nso unreasonably, motivelessly strong were they towards the lost young\r\nplaymate. \xe2\x80\x98How senseless of me!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, as he lay in his lonely bed.\r\nShe had been another man\xe2\x80\x99s wife almost the whole time since he was\r\nestranged from her, and now she was a corpse. Yet the absurdity did not\r\nmake his grief the less: and the consciousness of the intrinsic, almost\r\nradiant, purity of this newsprung affection for a flown spirit forbade\r\nhim to check it. The flesh was absent altogether; it was love rarefied\r\nand refined to its highest attar. He had felt nothing like it before.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon he went down to the club; not his large club, where\r\nthe men hardly spoke to each other, but the homely one where they\r\ntold stories of an afternoon, and were not ashamed to confess among\r\nthemselves to personal weaknesses and follies, knowing well that such\r\nsecrets would go no further. But he could not tell this. So volatile and\r\nintangible was the story that to convey it in words would have been as\r\nhard as to cage a perfume.\r\n\r\nThey observed his altered manner, and said he was in love. Pierston\r\nadmitted that he was; and there it ended. When he reached home he looked\r\nout of his bed-room window, and began to consider in what direction from\r\nwhere he stood that darling little figure lay. It was straight across\r\nthere, under the young pale moon. The symbol signified well. The\r\ndivinity of the silver bow was not more excellently pure than she, the\r\nlost, had been. Under that moon was the island of Ancient Slingers, and\r\non the island a house, framed from mullions to chimney-top like the\r\nisle itself, of stone. Inside the window, the moonlight irradiating her\r\nwinding-sheet, lay Avice, reached only by the faint noises inherent in\r\nthe isle; the tink-tink of the chisels in the quarries, the surging of\r\nthe tides in the Bay, and the muffled grumbling of the currents in the\r\nnever-pacified Race.\r\n\r\nHe began to divine the truth. Avice, the departed one, though she had\r\ncome short of inspiring a passion, had yet possessed a ground-quality\r\nabsent from her rivals, without which it seemed that a fixed and\r\nfull-rounded constancy to a woman could not flourish in him. Like his\r\nown, her family had been islanders for centuries--from Norman, Anglian,\r\nRoman, Balearic-British times. Hence in her nature, as in his, was some\r\nmysterious ingredient sucked from the isle; otherwise a racial instinct\r\nnecessary to the absolute unison of a pair. Thus, though he might\r\nnever love a woman of the island race, for lack in her of the desired\r\nrefinement, he could not love long a kimberlin--a woman other than of\r\nthe island race, for her lack of this groundwork of character.\r\n\r\nSuch was Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s view of things. Another fancy of his, an artist\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuperstition merely, may be mentioned. The Caros, like some other local\r\nfamilies, suggested a Roman lineage, more or less grafted on the stock\r\nof the Slingers. Their features recalled those of the Italian peasantry\r\nto any one as familiar as he was with them; and there were evidences\r\nthat the Roman colonists had been populous and long-abiding in and near\r\nthis corner of Britain. Tradition urged that a temple to Venus once\r\nstood at the top of the Roman road leading up into the isle; and\r\npossibly one to the love-goddess of the Slingers antedated this. What so\r\nnatural as that the true star of his soul would be found nowhere but in\r\none of the old island breed?\r\n\r\nAfter dinner his old friend Somers came in to smoke, and when they had\r\ntalked a little while Somers alluded casually to some place at which\r\nthey would meet on the morrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be there,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pierston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you promised?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. But I shall be at the island--looking at a dead woman\xe2\x80\x99s grave.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAs he spoke his eyes turned, and remained fixed on a table near. Somers\r\nfollowed the direction of his glance to a photograph on a stand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that she?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rather a bygone affair, then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston acknowledged it. \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s the only sweetheart I ever slighted,\r\nAlfred,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Because she\xe2\x80\x99s the only one I ought to have cared for.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s just the fool I have always been.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But if she\xe2\x80\x99s dead and buried, you can go to her grave at any time as\r\nwell as now, to keep up the sentiment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that she\xe2\x80\x99s buried.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But to-morrow--the Academy night! Of all days why go then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about the Academy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pierston--you are our only inspired sculptor. You are our Praxiteles,\r\nor rather our Lysippus. You are almost the only man of this generation\r\nwho has been able to mould and chisel forms living enough to draw the\r\nidle public away from the popular paintings into the usually deserted\r\nLecture-room, and people who have seen your last pieces of stuff say\r\nthere has been nothing like them since sixteen hundred and--since the\r\nsculptors \xe2\x80\x98of the great race\xe2\x80\x99 lived and died--whenever that was.\r\nWell, then, for the sake of others you ought not to rush off to that\r\nGod-forgotten sea-rock just when you are wanted in town, all for a woman\r\nyou last saw a hundred years ago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--it was only nineteen and three quarters,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his friend, with\r\nabstracted literalness. He went the next morning.\r\n\r\nSince the days of his youth a railway had been constructed along the\r\npebble bank, so that, except when the rails were washed away by the\r\ntides, which was rather often, the peninsula was quickly accessible. At\r\ntwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon he was rattled along by this new means of\r\nlocomotion, under the familiar monotonous line of bran-coloured stones,\r\nand he soon emerged from the station, which stood as a strange exotic\r\namong the black lerrets, the ruins of the washed-away village, and\r\nthe white cubes of oolite, just come to view after burial through\r\nunreckonable geologic years.\r\n\r\nIn entering upon the pebble beach the train had passed close to the\r\nruins of Henry the Eighth\xe2\x80\x99s or Sandsfoot Castle, whither Avice was to\r\nhave accompanied him on the night of his departure. Had she appeared the\r\nprimitive betrothal, with its natural result, would probably have taken\r\nplace; and, as no islander had ever been known to break that compact,\r\nshe would have become his wife.\r\n\r\nAscending the steep incline to where the quarrymen were chipping just\r\nas they had formerly done, and within sound of the great stone saws, he\r\nlooked southward towards the Beal.\r\n\r\nThe level line of the sea horizon rose above the surface of the isle, a\r\nruffled patch in mid-distance as usual marking the Race, whence many a\r\nLycidas had gone\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98Visiting the bottom of the monstrous world;\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nbut had not been blest with a poet as a friend. Against the stretch of\r\nwater, where a school of mackerel twinkled in the afternoon light, was\r\ndefined, in addition to the distant lighthouse, a church with its tower,\r\nstanding about a quarter of a mile off, near the edge of the cliff. The\r\nchurchyard gravestones could be seen in profile against the same vast\r\nspread of watery babble and unrest.\r\n\r\nAmong the graves moved the form of a man clothed in a white sheet, which\r\nthe wind blew and flapped coldly every now and then. Near him moved six\r\nmen bearing a long box, and two or three persons in black followed. The\r\ncoffin, with its twelve legs, crawled across the isle, while around and\r\nbeneath it the flashing lights from the sea and the school of\r\nmackerel were reflected; a fishing-boat, far out in the Channel, being\r\nmomentarily discernible under the coffin also.\r\n\r\nThe procession wandered round to a particular corner, and halted, and\r\npaused there a long while in the wind, the sea behind them, the surplice\r\nof the priest still blowing. Jocelyn stood with his hat off: he was\r\npresent, though he was a quarter of a mile off; and he seemed to hear\r\nthe words that were being said, though nothing but the wind was audible.\r\n\r\nHe instinctively knew that it was none other than Avice whom he was\r\nseeing interred; HIS Avice, as he now began presumptuously to call\r\nher. Presently the little group withdrew from before the sea-shine, and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nHe felt himself unable to go further in that direction, and turning\r\naside went aimlessly across the open land, visiting the various spots\r\nthat he had formerly visited with her. But, as if tethered to the\r\nchurchyard by a cord, he was still conscious of being at the end of\r\na radius whose pivot was the grave of Avice Caro; and as the dusk\r\nthickened he closed upon his centre and entered the churchyard gate.\r\n\r\nNot a soul was now within the precincts. The grave, newly shaped, was\r\neasily discoverable behind the church, and when the same young moon\r\narose which he had observed the previous evening from his window\r\nin London he could see the yet fresh foot-marks of the mourners and\r\nbearers. The breeze had fallen to a calm with the setting of the sun:\r\nthe lighthouse had opened its glaring eye, and, disinclined to leave\r\na spot sublimed both by early association and present regret, he moved\r\nback to the church-wall, warm from the afternoon sun, and sat down upon\r\na window-sill facing the grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. IV. SHE THREATENS TO RESUME CORPOREAL SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe lispings of the sea beneath the cliffs were all the sounds that\r\nreached him, for the quarries were silent now. How long he sat here\r\nlonely and thinking he did not know. Neither did he know, though he felt\r\ndrowsy, whether inexpectant sadness--that gentle soporific--lulled him\r\ninto a short sleep, so that he lost count of time and consciousness of\r\nincident. But during some minute or minutes he seemed to see Avice Caro\r\nherself, bending over and then withdrawing from her grave in the light\r\nof the moon.\r\n\r\nShe seemed not a year older, not a digit less slender, not a line more\r\nangular than when he had parted from her twenty years earlier, in the\r\nlane hard by. A renascent reasoning on the impossibility of such a\r\nphenomenon as this being more than a dream-fancy roused him with a start\r\nfrom his heaviness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must have been asleep,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\nYet she had seemed so real. Pierston however dismissed the strange\r\nimpression, arguing that even if the information sent him of Avice\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath should be false--a thing incredible--that sweet friend of his\r\nyouth, despite the transfiguring effects of moonlight, would not now\r\nlook the same as she had appeared nineteen or twenty years ago. Were\r\nwhat he saw substantial flesh, it must have been some other person than\r\nAvice Caro.\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied his sentiment by coming to the graveside there was\r\nnothing more for him to do in the island, and he decided to return to\r\nLondon that night. But some time remaining still on his hands,\r\nJocelyn by a natural instinct turned his feet in the direction of\r\nEast Quarriers, the village of his birth and of hers. Passing the\r\nmarket-square he pursued the arm of road to \xe2\x80\x98Sylvania Castle,\xe2\x80\x99 a private\r\nmansion of comparatively modern date, in whose grounds stood the single\r\nplantation of trees of which the isle could boast. The cottages extended\r\nclose to the walls of the enclosure, and one of the last of these\r\ndwellings had been Avice\xe2\x80\x99s, in which, as it was her freehold, she\r\npossibly had died.\r\n\r\nTo reach it he passed the gates of \xe2\x80\x98Sylvania,\xe2\x80\x99 and observed above the\r\nlawn wall a board announcing that the house was to be let furnished. A\r\nfew steps further revealed the cottage which with its quaint and massive\r\nstone features of two or three centuries\xe2\x80\x99 antiquity, was capable\r\neven now of longer resistance to the rasp of Time than ordinary new\r\nerections. His attention was drawn to the window, still unblinded,\r\nthough a lamp lit the room. He stepped back against the wall opposite,\r\nand gazed in.\r\n\r\nAt a table covered with a white cloth a young woman stood putting\r\ntea-things away into a corner-cupboard. She was in all respects the\r\nAvice he had lost, the girl he had seen in the churchyard and had\r\nfancied to be the illusion of a dream. And though there was this time\r\nno doubt about her reality, the isolation of her position in the silent\r\nhouse lent her a curiously startling aspect. Divining the explanation he\r\nwaited for footsteps, and in a few moments a quarryman passed him on his\r\njourney home. Pierston inquired of the man concerning the spectacle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes, sir; that\xe2\x80\x99s poor Mrs. Caro\xe2\x80\x99s only daughter, and it must be\r\nlonely for her there to-night, poor maid! Yes, good-now; she\xe2\x80\x99s the very\r\ndaps of her mother--that\xe2\x80\x99s what everybody says.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But how does she come to be so lonely?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One of her brothers went to sea and was drowned, and t\xe2\x80\x99other is in\r\nAmerica.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They were quarryowners at one time?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe quarryman \xe2\x80\x98pitched his nitch,\xe2\x80\x99 and explained to the seeming stranger\r\nthat there had been three families thereabouts in the stone trade, who\r\nhad got much involved with each other in the last generation. They were\r\nthe Bencombs, the Pierstons, and the Caros. The Bencombs strained their\r\nutmost to outlift the other two, and partially succeeded. They grew\r\nenormously rich, sold out, and disappeared altogether from the island\r\nwhich had been their making. The Pierstons kept a dogged middle course,\r\nthrove without show or noise, and also retired in their turn. The Caros\r\nwere pulled completely down in the competition with the other two, and\r\nwhen Widow Caro\xe2\x80\x99s daughter married her cousin Jim Caro, he tried to\r\nregain for the family its original place in the three-cornered struggle.\r\nHe took contracts at less than he could profit by, speculated more and\r\nmore, till at last the crash came; he was sold up, went away, and later\r\non came back to live in this little cottage, which was his wife\xe2\x80\x99s by\r\ninheritance. There he remained till his death; and now his widow was\r\ngone. Hardships had helped on her end.\r\n\r\nThe quarryman proceeded on his way, and Pierston, deeply remorseful,\r\nknocked at the door of the minute freehold. The girl herself opened it,\r\nlamp in hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Avice!\xe2\x80\x99 he said tenderly; \xe2\x80\x98Avice Caro!\xe2\x80\x99 even now unable to get over the\r\nstrange feeling that he was twenty years younger, addressing Avice the\r\nforsaken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ann, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, your name is not the same as your mother\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My second name is. And my surname. Poor mother married her cousin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As everybody does here.... Well, Ann or otherwise, you are Avice to me.\r\nAnd you have lost her now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe spoke in the very same sweet voice that he had listened to a score\r\nof years before, and bent eyes of the same familiar hazel inquiringly\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knew your mother at one time,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98and learning of her death\r\nand burial I took the liberty of calling upon you. You will forgive a\r\nstranger doing that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 she said dispassionately, and glancing round the room: \xe2\x80\x98This was\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s own house, and now it is mine. I am sorry not to be in mourning\r\non the night of her funeral, but I have just been to put some flowers on\r\nher grave, and I took it off afore going that the damp mid not spoil the\r\ncrape. You see, she was bad a long time, and I have to be careful, and\r\ndo washing and ironing for a living. She hurt her side with wringing up\r\nthe large sheets she had to wash for the Castle folks here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt yourself doing it, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no, that I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t! There\xe2\x80\x99s Charl Woollat, and Sammy Scribben, and\r\nTed Gibsey, and lots o\xe2\x80\x99 young chaps; they\xe2\x80\x99ll wring anything for me if\r\nthey happen to come along. But I can hardly trust \xe2\x80\x98em. Sam Scribben\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other day twisted a linen tablecloth into two pieces, for all the\r\nworld as if it had been a pipe-light. They never know when to stop in\r\ntheir wringing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe voice truly was his Avice\xe2\x80\x99s; but Avice the Second was clearly more\r\nmatter-of-fact, unreflecting, less cultivated than her mother had been.\r\nThis Avice would never recite poetry from any platform, local or other,\r\nwith enthusiastic appreciation of its fire. There was a disappointment\r\nin his recognition of this; yet she touched him as few had done: he\r\ncould not bear to go away. \xe2\x80\x98How old are you?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Going in nineteen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was about the age of her double, Avice the First, when he and she had\r\nstrolled together over the cliffs during the engagement. But he was now\r\nforty, if a day. She before him was an uneducated laundress, and he was\r\na sculptor and a Royal Academician, with a fortune and a reputation. Yet\r\nwhy was it an unpleasant sensation to him just then to recollect that he\r\nwas two score?\r\n\r\nHe could find no further excuse for remaining, and having still\r\nhalf-an-hour to spare he went round by the road to the other or west\r\nside of the last-century \xe2\x80\x98Sylvania Castle,\xe2\x80\x99 and came to the furthest\r\nhouse out there on the cliff. It was his early home. Used in the summer\r\nas a lodging-house for visitors, it now stood empty and silent, the\r\nevening wind swaying the euonymus and tamarisk boughs in the front--the\r\nonly evergreen shrubs that could weather the whipping salt gales which\r\nsped past the walls. Opposite the house, far out at sea, the familiar\r\nlightship winked from the sandbank, and all at once there came to him a\r\nwild wish--that, instead of having an artist\xe2\x80\x99s reputation, he could be\r\nliving here an illiterate and unknown man, wooing, and in a fair way of\r\nwinning, the pretty laundress in the cottage hard by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. V. THE RESUMPTION TAKES PLACE\r\n\r\nHaving returned to London he mechanically resumed his customary life;\r\nbut he was not really living there. The phantom of Avice, now grown to\r\nbe warm flesh and blood, held his mind afar. He thought of nothing\r\nbut the isle, and Avice the Second dwelling therein--inhaling its salt\r\nbreath, stroked by its singing rains and by the haunted atmosphere of\r\nRoman Venus about and around the site of her perished temple there. The\r\nvery defects in the country girl became charms as viewed from town.\r\n\r\nNothing now pleased him so much as to spend that portion of the\r\nafternoon which he devoted to out-door exercise, in haunting the\r\npurlieus of the wharves along the Thames, where the stone of his native\r\nrock was unshipped from the coasting-craft that had brought it thither.\r\nHe would pass inside the great gates of these landing-places on the\r\nright or left bank, contemplate the white cubes and oblongs, imbibe\r\ntheir associations, call up the genius loci whence they came, and almost\r\nforget that he was in London.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon he was walking away from the mud-splashed entrance to one\r\nof the wharves, when his attention was drawn to a female form on the\r\nopposite side of the way, going towards the spot he had just left. She\r\nwas somewhat small, slight, and graceful; her attire alone would\r\nhave been enough to attract him, being simple and countrified\r\nto picturesqueness; but he was more than attracted by her strong\r\nresemblance to Avice Caro the younger--Ann Avice, as she had said she\r\nwas called.\r\n\r\nBefore she had receded a hundred yards he felt certain that it was Avice\r\nindeed; and his unifying mood of the afternoon was now so intense that\r\nthe lost and the found Avice seemed essentially the same person. Their\r\nexternal likeness to each other--probably owing to the cousinship\r\nbetween the elder and her husband--went far to nourish the fantasy. He\r\nhastily turned, and rediscovered the girl among the pedestrians. She\r\nkept on her way to the wharf, where, looking inquiringly around her for\r\na few seconds, with the manner of one unaccustomed to the locality, she\r\nopened the gate and disappeared.\r\n\r\nPierston also went up to the gate and entered. She had crossed to the\r\nlanding-place, beyond which a lumpy craft lay moored. Drawing nearer,\r\nhe discovered her to be engaged in conversation with the skipper and an\r\nelderly woman--both come straight from the oolitic isle, as was apparent\r\nin a moment from their accent. Pierston felt no hesitation in making\r\nhimself known as a native, the ruptured engagement between Avice\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother and himself twenty years before having been known to few or none\r\nnow living.\r\n\r\nThe present embodiment of Avice recognized him, and with the artless\r\ncandour of her race and years explained the situation, though that was\r\nrather his duty as an intruder than hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is Cap\xe2\x80\x99n Kibbs, sir, a distant relation of father\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And this is Mrs. Kibbs. We\xe2\x80\x99ve come up from the island wi\xe2\x80\x99en just for a\r\ntrip, and are going to sail back wi\xe2\x80\x99en Wednesday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, I see. And where are you staying?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here--on board.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, you live on board entirely?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lord, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 broke in Mrs. Kibbs, \xe2\x80\x98I should be afeard o\xe2\x80\x99 my life to tine\r\nmy eyes among these here kimberlins at night-time; and even by day, if\r\nso be I venture into the streets, I nowhen forget how many turnings to\r\nthe right and to the left \xe2\x80\x98tis to get back to Job\xe2\x80\x99s vessel--do I, Job?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe skipper nodded confirmation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are safer ashore than afloat,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pierston, \xe2\x80\x98especially in the\r\nChannel, with these winds and those heavy blocks of stone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cap\xe2\x80\x99n Kibbs, after privately clearing something from his\r\nmouth, \xe2\x80\x98as to the winds, there idden much danger in them at this time\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 year. \xe2\x80\x98Tis the ocean-bound steamers that make the risk to craft like\r\nours. If you happen to be in their course, under you go--cut clane in\r\ntwo pieces, and they never lying-to to haul in your carcases, and nobody\r\nto tell the tale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston turned to Avice, wanting to say much to her, yet not knowing\r\nwhat to say. He lamely remarked at last: \xe2\x80\x98You go back the same way,\r\nAvice?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, take care of yourself afloat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope--I may see you again soon--and talk to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope so, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe could not get further, and after a while Pierston left them, and went\r\naway thinking of Avice more than ever.\r\n\r\nThe next day he mentally timed them down the river, allowing for the\r\npause to take in ballast, and on the Wednesday pictured the sail down\r\nthe open sea. That night he thought of the little craft under the bows\r\nof the huge steam-vessels, powerless to make itself seen or heard, and\r\nAvice, now growing inexpressibly dear, sleeping in her little berth at\r\nthe mercy of a thousand chance catastrophes.\r\n\r\nHonest perception had told him that this Avice, fairer than her mother\r\nin face and form, was her inferior in soul and understanding. Yet the\r\nfervour which the first could never kindle in him was, almost to his\r\nalarm, burning up now. He began to have misgivings as to some queer\r\ntrick that his migratory Beloved was about to play him, or rather the\r\ncapricious Divinity behind that ideal lady.\r\n\r\nA gigantic satire upon the mutations of his nymph during the past twenty\r\nyears seemed looming in the distance. A forsaking of the accomplished\r\nand well-connected Mrs. Pine-Avon for the little laundress, under\r\nthe traction of some mystic magnet which had nothing to do with\r\nreason--surely that was the form of the satire.\r\n\r\nBut it was recklessly pleasant to leave the suspicion unrecognized as\r\nyet, and follow the lead.\r\n\r\nIn thinking how best to do this Pierston recollected that, as was\r\ncustomary when the summer-time approached, Sylvania Castle had been\r\nadvertised for letting furnished. A solitary dreamer like himself, whose\r\nwants all lay in an artistic and ideal direction, did not require such\r\ngaunt accommodation as the aforesaid residence offered; but the spot was\r\nall, and the expenses of a few months of tenancy therein he could well\r\nafford. A letter to the agent was dispatched that night, and in a few\r\ndays Jocelyn found himself the temporary possessor of a place which he\r\nhad never seen the inside of since his childhood, and had then deemed\r\nthe abode of unpleasant ghosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. VI. THE PAST SHINES IN THE PRESENT\r\n\r\nIt was the evening of Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s arrival at Sylvania Castle, a dignified\r\nmanor-house in a nook by the cliffs, with modern castellations and\r\nbattlements; and he had walked through the rooms, about the lawn,\r\nand into the surrounding plantation of elms, which on this island of\r\ntreeless rock lent a unique character to the enclosure. In name, nature,\r\nand accessories the property within the girdling wall formed a complete\r\nantithesis to everything in its precincts. To find other trees between\r\nPebble-bank and Beal, it was necessary to recede a little in time--to\r\ndig down to a loose stratum of the underlying stone-beds, where a forest\r\nof conifers lay as petrifactions, their heads all in one direction, as\r\nblown down by a gale in the Secondary geologic epoch.\r\n\r\nDusk had closed in, and he now proceeded with what was, after all, the\r\nreal business of his sojourn. The two servants who had been left to\r\ntake care of the house were in their own quarters, and he went out\r\nunobserved. Crossing a hollow overhung by the budding boughs he\r\napproached an empty garden-house of Elizabethan design, which stood on\r\nthe outer wall of the grounds, and commanded by a window the fronts of\r\nthe nearest cottages. Among them was the home of the resuscitated Avice.\r\n\r\nHe had chosen this moment for his outlook through knowing that the\r\nvillagers were in no hurry to pull down their blinds at nightfall.\r\nAnd, as he had divined, the inside of the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s living-room was\r\nvisible to him as formerly, illuminated by the rays of its own lamp.\r\n\r\nA subdued thumping came every now and then from the apartment. She was\r\nironing linen on a flannel table-cloth, a row of such apparel hanging on\r\na clothes-horse by the fire. Her face had been pale when he encountered\r\nher, but now it was warm and pink with her exertions and the heat of the\r\nstove. Yet it was in perfect and passionless repose, which imparted a\r\nMinerva cast to the profile. When she glanced up, her lineaments seemed\r\nto have all the soul and heart that had characterized her mother\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand had been with her a true index of the spirit within. Could it be\r\npossible that in this case the manifestation was fictitious? He had met\r\nwith many such examples of hereditary persistence without the qualities\r\nsignified by the traits. He unconsciously hoped that it was at least not\r\nentirely so here.\r\n\r\nThe room was less furnished than when he had last beheld it. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x98bo-fet,\xe2\x80\x99 or double corner-cupboard, where the china was formerly kept,\r\nhad disappeared, its place being taken by a plain board. The tall old\r\nclock, with its ancient oak carcase, arched brow, and humorous mouth,\r\nwas also not to be seen, a cheap, white-dialled specimen doing its work.\r\nWhat these displacements might betoken saddened his humanity less than\r\nit cheered his primitive instinct in pointing out how her necessities\r\nmight bring them together.\r\n\r\nHaving fixed his residence near her for some lengthy time he felt in\r\nno hurry to obtrude his presence just now, and went indoors. That this\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s frame was doomed to be a real embodiment of that olden seductive\r\none--that Protean dream-creature, who had never seen fit to irradiate\r\nthe mother\xe2\x80\x99s image till it became a mere memory after dissolution--he\r\ndoubted less every moment.\r\n\r\nThere was an uneasiness in recognizing such. There was something\r\nabnormal in his present proclivity. A certain sanity had, after all,\r\naccompanied his former idealizing passions: the Beloved had seldom\r\ninformed a personality which, while enrapturing his soul, simultaneously\r\nshocked his intellect. A change, perhaps, had come.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine morning on the morrow. Walking in the grounds towards\r\nthe gate he saw Avice entering his hired castle with a broad oval\r\nwicker-basket covered with a white cloth, which burden she bore round to\r\nthe back door. Of course, she washed for his own household: he had not\r\nthought of that. In the morning sunlight she appeared rather as a sylph\r\nthan as a washerwoman; and he could not but think that the slightness\r\nof her figure was as ill adapted to this occupation as her mother\xe2\x80\x99s had\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, it was not the washerwoman that he saw now. In front\r\nof her, on the surface of her, was shining out that more real, more\r\ninter-penetrating being whom he knew so well! The occupation of the\r\nsubserving minion, the blemishes of the temporary creature who formed\r\nthe background, were of the same account in the presentation of the\r\nindispensable one as the supporting posts and framework in a pyrotechnic\r\ndisplay.\r\n\r\nShe left the house and went homeward by a path of which he was not\r\naware, having probably changed her course because she had seen him\r\nstanding there. It meant nothing, for she had hardly become acquainted\r\nwith him; yet that she should have avoided him was a new experience. He\r\nhad no opportunity for a further study of her by distant observation,\r\nand hit upon a pretext for bringing her face to face with him. He found\r\nfault with his linen, and directed that the laundress should be sent\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is rather young, poor little thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said the housemaid\r\napologetically. \xe2\x80\x98But since her mother\xe2\x80\x99s death she has enough to do to\r\nkeep above water, and we make shift with her. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell her, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will see her myself. Send her in when she comes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pierston.\r\n\r\nOne morning, accordingly, when he was answering a spiteful criticism\r\nof a late work of his, he was told that she waited his pleasure in the\r\nhall. He went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98About the washing,\xe2\x80\x99 said the sculptor stiffly. \xe2\x80\x98I am a very particular\r\nperson, and I wish no preparation of lime to be used.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know folks used it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the maiden, in a scared and\r\nreserved tone, without looking at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s all right. And then, the mangling smashes the buttons.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a mangle, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! that\xe2\x80\x99s satisfactory. And I object to so much borax in the starch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t put any,\xe2\x80\x99 Avice returned in the same close way; \xe2\x80\x98never heard\r\nthe name o\xe2\x80\x99t afore!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O I see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll this time Pierston was thinking of the girl--or as the scientific\r\nmight say, Nature was working her plans for the next generation under\r\nthe cloak of a dialogue on linen. He could not read her individual\r\ncharacter, owing to the confusing effect of her likeness to a woman whom\r\nhe had valued too late. He could not help seeing in her all that he knew\r\nof another, and veiling in her all that did not harmonize with his sense\r\nof metempsychosis.\r\n\r\nThe girl seemed to think of nothing but the business in hand. She had\r\nanswered to the point, and was hardly aware of his sex or of his shape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knew your mother, Avice,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98You remember my telling you so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well--I have taken this house for two or three months, and you will be\r\nvery useful to me. You still live just outside the wall?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the self-contained girl.\r\n\r\nDemurely and dispassionately she turned to leave--this pretty creature\r\nwith features so still. There was something strange in seeing move\r\noff thus that form which he knew passing well, she who was once so\r\nthrobbingly alive to his presence that, not many yards from this spot,\r\nshe had flung her arms round him and given him a kiss which, despised\r\nin its freshness, had revived in him latterly as the dearest kiss of all\r\nhis life. And now this \xe2\x80\x98daps\xe2\x80\x99 of her mother (as they called her in the\r\ndialect here), this perfect copy, why did she turn away?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your mother was a refined and well-informed woman, I think I remember?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She was, sir; everybody said so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope you resemble her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe archly shook her head, and drew warily away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O! one thing more, Avice. I have not brought much linen, so you must\r\ncome to the house every day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You won\xe2\x80\x99t forget that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he let her go. He was a town man, and she an artless islander, yet\r\nhe had opened himself out, like a sea-anemone, without disturbing the\r\nepiderm of her nature. It was monstrous that a maiden who had assumed\r\nthe personality of her of his tenderest memory should be so impervious.\r\nPerhaps it was he who was wanting. Avice might be Passion masking as\r\nIndifference, because he was so many years older in outward show.\r\n\r\nThis brought him to the root of it. In his heart he was not a day older\r\nthan when he had wooed the mother at the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s present age. His\r\nrecord moved on with the years, his sentiments stood still.\r\n\r\nWhen he beheld those of his fellows who were defined as buffers and\r\nfogeys--imperturbable, matter-of-fact, slightly ridiculous beings,\r\npast masters in the art of populating homes, schools, and colleges, and\r\npresent adepts in the science of giving away brides--how he envied them,\r\nassuming them to feel as they appeared to feel, with their commerce and\r\ntheir politics, their glasses and their pipes. They had got past the\r\ndistracting currents of passionateness, and were in the calm waters of\r\nmiddle-aged philosophy. But he, their contemporary, was tossed like a\r\ncork hither and thither upon the crest of every fancy, precisely as he\r\nhad been tossed when he was half his present age, with the burden now of\r\ndouble pain to himself in his growing vision of all as vanity.\r\n\r\nAvice had gone, and he saw her no more that day. Since he could not\r\nagain call upon her, she was as inaccessible as if she had entered the\r\nmilitary citadel on the hill-top beyond them.\r\n\r\nIn the evening he went out and paced down the lane to the Red King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncastle overhanging the cliff, beside whose age the castle he occupied\r\nwas but a thing of yesterday. Below the castle precipice lay enormous\r\nblocks, which had fallen from it, and several of them were carved over\r\nwith names and initials. He knew the spot and the old trick well, and\r\nby searching in the faint moon-rays he found a pair of names which, as\r\na boy, he himself had cut. They were \xe2\x80\x98AVICE\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98JOCELYN\xe2\x80\x99--Avice Caro\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand his own. The letters were now nearly worn away by the weather and\r\nthe brine. But close by, in quite fresh letters, stood \xe2\x80\x98ANN AVICE,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncoupled with the name \xe2\x80\x98ISAAC.\xe2\x80\x99 They could not have been there more than\r\ntwo or three years, and the \xe2\x80\x98Ann Avice\xe2\x80\x99 was probably Avice the Second.\r\nWho was Isaac? Some boy admirer of her child-time doubtless.\r\n\r\nHe retraced his steps, and passed the Caros\xe2\x80\x99 house towards his own. The\r\nrevivified Avice animated the dwelling, and the light within the room\r\nfell upon the window. She was just inside that blind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever she unexpectedly came to the castle he started, and lost\r\nplacidity. It was not at her presence as such, but at the new condition,\r\nwhich seemed to have something sinister in it. On the other hand, the\r\nmost abrupt encounter with him moved her to no emotion as it had\r\nmoved her prototype in the old days. She was indifferent to, almost\r\nunconscious of, his propinquity. He was no more than a statue to her;\r\nshe was a growing fire to him.\r\n\r\nA sudden Sapphic terror of love would ever and anon come upon the\r\nsculptor, when his matured reflecting powers would insist upon\r\ninforming him of the fearful lapse from reasonableness that lay in this\r\ninfatuation. It threw him into a sweat. What if now, at last, he were\r\ndoomed to do penance for his past emotional wanderings (in a material\r\nsense) by being chained in fatal fidelity to an object that his\r\nintellect despised? One night he dreamt that he saw dimly masking behind\r\nthat young countenance \xe2\x80\x98the Weaver of Wiles\xe2\x80\x99 herself, \xe2\x80\x98with all her\r\nsubtle face laughing aloud.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, the Well-Beloved was alive again, had been lost and was found.\r\nHe was amazed at the change of front in himself. She had worn the\r\nguise of strange women; she had been a woman of every class, from the\r\ndignified daughter of some ecclesiastic or peer to a Nubian Almeh with\r\nher handkerchief, undulating to the beats of the tom-tom; but all these\r\nembodiments had been endowed with a certain smartness, either of the\r\nflesh or spirit: some with wit, a few with talent, and even genius. But\r\nthe new impersonation had apparently nothing beyond sex and prettiness.\r\nShe knew not how to sport a fan or handkerchief, hardly how to pull on a\r\nglove.\r\n\r\nBut her limited life was innocent, and that went far. Poor little Avice!\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s image: there it all lay. After all, her parentage was as\r\ngood as his own; it was misfortune that had sent her down to this. Odd\r\nas it seemed to him, her limitations were largely what he loved her for.\r\nHer rejuvenating power over him had ineffable charm. He felt as he had\r\nfelt when standing beside her predecessor; but, alas! he was twenty\r\nyears further on towards the shade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. VII. THE NEW BECOMES ESTABLISHED\r\n\r\nA few mornings later he was looking through an upper back window over a\r\nscreened part of the garden. The door beneath him opened, and a figure\r\nappeared tripping forth. She went round out of sight to where the\r\ngardener was at work, and presently returned with a bunch of green stuff\r\nfluttering in each hand. It was Avice, her dark hair now braided up\r\nsnugly under a cap. She sailed on with a rapt and unconscious face, her\r\nthoughts a thousand removes from him.\r\n\r\nHow she had suddenly come to be an inmate of his own house he could\r\nnot understand, till he recalled the fact that he had given the castle\r\nservants a whole holiday to attend a review of the yeomanry in the\r\nwatering-place over the bay, on their stating that they could provide a\r\ntemporary substitute to stay in the house. They had evidently called\r\nin Avice. To his great pleasure he discovered their opinion of his\r\nrequirements to be such a mean one that they had called in no one else.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit, as she seemed to him, brought his lunch into the room where\r\nhe was writing, and he beheld her uncover it. She went to the window to\r\nadjust a blind which had slipped, and he had a good view of her profile.\r\nIt was not unlike that of one of the three goddesses in Rubens\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Judgment of Paris,\xe2\x80\x99 and in contour was nigh perfection. But it was in\r\nher full face that the vision of her mother was most apparent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you cook all this, Avice?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked, arousing himself.\r\n\r\nShe turned and half-smiled, merely murmuring, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWell he knew the arrangement of those white teeth. In the junction of\r\ntwo of the upper ones there was a slight irregularity; no stranger would\r\nhave noticed it, nor would he, but that he knew of the same mark in\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, and looked for it here. Till Avice the Second had\r\nrevealed it this moment by her smile, he had never beheld that mark\r\nsince the parting from Avice the First, when she had smiled under his\r\nkiss as the copy had done now.\r\n\r\nNext morning, when dressing, he heard her through the ricketty floor of\r\nthe building engaged in conversation with the other servants. Having\r\nby this time regularly installed herself as the exponent of the\r\nLong-pursued--as one who, by no initiative of his own, had been chosen\r\nby some superior Power as the vehicle of her next debut, she attracted\r\nhim by the cadences of her voice; she would suddenly drop it to a rich\r\nwhisper of roguishness, when the slight rural monotony of its narrative\r\nspeech disappeared, and soul and heart--or what seemed soul and\r\nheart--resounded. The charm lay in the intervals, using that word in its\r\nmusical sense. She would say a few syllables in one note, and end her\r\nsentence in a soft modulation upwards, then downwards, then into her\r\nown note again. The curve of sound was as artistic as any line of beauty\r\never struck by his pencil--as satisfying as the curves of her who was\r\nthe World\xe2\x80\x99s Desire.\r\n\r\nThe subject of her discourse he cared nothing about--it was no more his\r\ninterest than his concern. He took special pains that in catching her\r\nvoice he might not comprehend her words. To the tones he had a right,\r\nnone to the articulations. By degrees he could not exist long without\r\nthis sound.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday evening he found that she went to church. He followed behind\r\nher over the open road, keeping his eye on the little hat with its\r\nbunch of cock\xe2\x80\x99s feathers as on a star. When she had passed in Pierston\r\nobserved her position and took a seat behind her.\r\n\r\nEngaged in the study of her ear and the nape of her white neck, he\r\nsuddenly became aware of the presence of a lady still further ahead in\r\nthe aisle, whose attire, though of black materials in the quietest form,\r\nwas of a cut which rather suggested London than this Ultima Thule. For\r\nthe minute he forgot, in his curiosity, that Avice intervened. The\r\nlady turned her head somewhat, and, though she was veiled with unusual\r\nthickness for the season, he seemed to recognize Nichola Pine-Avon in\r\nthe form.\r\n\r\nWhy should Mrs. Pine-Avon be there? Pierston asked himself, if it\r\nshould, indeed, be she.\r\n\r\nThe end of the service saw his attention again concentrated on Avice to\r\nsuch a degree that at the critical moment of moving out he forgot the\r\nmysterious lady in front of her, and found that she had left the church\r\nby the side-door. Supposing it to have been Mrs. Pine-Avon, she\r\nwould probably be discovered staying at one of the hotels at the\r\nwatering-place over the bay, and to have come along the Pebble-bank\r\nto the island as so many did, for an evening drive. For the present,\r\nhowever, the explanation was not forthcoming; and he did not seek it.\r\n\r\nWhen he emerged from the church the great placid eye of the lighthouse\r\nat the Beal Point was open, and he moved thitherward a few steps to\r\nescape Nichola, or her double, and the rest of the congregation.\r\nTurning at length, he hastened homeward along the now deserted trackway,\r\nintending to overtake the revitalized Avice. But he could see nothing of\r\nher, and concluded that she had walked too fast for him. Arrived at his\r\nown gate he paused a moment, and perceived that Avice\xe2\x80\x99s little freehold\r\nwas still in darkness. She had not come.\r\n\r\nHe retraced his steps, but could not find her, the only persons on the\r\nroad being a man and his wife, as he knew them to be though he could not\r\nsee them, from the words of the man--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you had not a\xe2\x80\x99ready married me, you\xe2\x80\x99d cut my acquaintance! That\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npretty thing for a wife to say!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe remark struck his ear unpleasantly, and by-and-by he went back\r\nagain. Avice\xe2\x80\x99s cottage was now lighted: she must have come round by the\r\nother road. Satisfied that she was safely domiciled for the night he\r\nopened the gate of Sylvania Castle and retired to his room also.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nEastward from the grounds the cliffs were rugged and the view of the\r\nopposite coast picturesque in the extreme. A little door from the lawn\r\ngave him immediate access to the rocks and shore on this side. Without\r\nthe door was a dip-well of pure water, which possibly had supplied the\r\ninmates of the adjoining and now ruinous Red King\xe2\x80\x99s castle at the time\r\nof its erection. On a sunny morning he was meditating here when he\r\ndiscerned a figure on the shore below spreading white linen upon the\r\npebbly strand.\r\n\r\nJocelyn descended. Avice, as he had supposed, had now returned to her\r\nown occupation. Her shapely pink arms, though slight, were plump enough\r\nto show dimples at the elbows, and were set off by her purple cotton\r\nprint, which the shore-breeze licked and tantalized. He stood near,\r\nwithout speaking. The wind dragged a shirt-sleeve from the \xe2\x80\x98popple\xe2\x80\x99 or\r\npebble which held it down. Pierston stooped and put a heavier one in its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 she said quietly. She turned up her hazel eyes, and seemed\r\ngratified to perceive that her assistant was Pierston. She had\r\nplainly been so wrapped in her own thoughts--gloomy thoughts, by their\r\nsigns--that she had not considered him till then.\r\n\r\nThe young girl continued to converse with him in friendly frankness,\r\nshowing neither ardour nor shyness. As for love--it was evidently\r\nfurther from her mind than even death and dissolution.\r\n\r\nWhen one of the sheets became intractable Jocelyn said, \xe2\x80\x98Do you hold it\r\ndown, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll put the popples.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe acquiesced, and in placing a pebble his hand touched hers.\r\n\r\nIt was a young hand, rather long and thin, a little damp and coddled\r\nfrom her slopping. In setting down the last stone he laid it, by a pure\r\naccident, rather heavily on her fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very, very sorry!\xe2\x80\x99 Jocelyn exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x98O, I have bruised the skin,\r\nAvice!\xe2\x80\x99 He seized her fingers to examine the damage done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried luminously, allowing him to retain her\r\nhand without the least objection. \xe2\x80\x98Why--that\xe2\x80\x99s where I scratched it this\r\nmorning with a pin. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt me a bit with the popple-stone!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAlthough her gown was purple, there was a little black crape bow upon\r\neach arm. He knew what it meant, and it saddened him. \xe2\x80\x98Do you ever visit\r\nyour mother\xe2\x80\x99s grave?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir, sometimes. I am going there tonight to water the daisies.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had now finished here, and they parted. That evening, when the sky\r\nwas red, he emerged by the garden-door and passed her house. The blinds\r\nwere not down, and he could see her sewing within. While he paused\r\nshe sprang up as if she had forgotten the hour, and tossed on her\r\nhat. Jocelyn strode ahead and round the corner, and was halfway up the\r\nstraggling street before he discerned her little figure behind him.\r\n\r\nHe hastened past the lads and young women with clinking buckets who were\r\ndrawing water from the fountains by the wayside, and took the direction\r\nof the church. With the disappearance of the sun the lighthouse had\r\nagain set up its flame against the sky, the dark church rising in the\r\nforeground. Here he allowed her to overtake him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You loved your mother much?\xe2\x80\x99 said Jocelyn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did, sir; of course I did,\xe2\x80\x99 said the girl, who tripped so lightly\r\nthat it seemed he might have carried her on his hand.\r\n\r\nPierston wished to say, \xe2\x80\x98So did I,\xe2\x80\x99 but did not like to disclose events\r\nwhich she, apparently, never guessed. Avice fell into thought, and\r\ncontinued--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mother had a very sad life for some time when she was about as old as\r\nI. I should not like mine to be as hers. Her young man proved false to\r\nher because she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree to meet him one night, and it grieved\r\nmother almost all her life. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 fretted about him, if I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen she. She would never name his name, but I know he was a wicked,\r\ncruel man; and I hate to think of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter this he could not go into the churchyard with her, and walked\r\nonward alone to the south of the isle. He was wretched for hours. Yet he\r\nwould not have stood where he did stand in the ranks of an imaginative\r\nprofession if he had not been at the mercy of every haunting of the\r\nfancy that can beset man. It was in his weaknesses as a citizen and\r\na national-unit that his strength lay as an artist, and he felt it\r\nchildish to complain of susceptibilities not only innate but cultivated.\r\n\r\nBut he was paying dearly enough for his Liliths. He saw a terrible\r\nvengeance ahead. What had he done to be tormented like this? The\r\nBeloved, after flitting from Nichola Pine-Avon to the phantom of a dead\r\nwoman whom he never adored in her lifetime, had taken up her abode in\r\nthe living representative of the dead, with a permanence of hold which\r\nthe absolute indifference of that little brown-eyed representative only\r\nseemed to intensify.\r\n\r\nDid he really wish to proceed to marriage with this chit of a girl? He\r\ndid: the wish had come at last. It was true that as he studied her\r\nhe saw defects in addition to her social insufficiencies. Judgment,\r\nhoodwinked as it was, told him that she was colder in nature, commoner\r\nin character, than that well read, bright little woman Avice the First.\r\nBut twenty years make a difference in ideals, and the added demands of\r\nmiddle-age in physical form are more than balanced by its concessions\r\nas to the spiritual content. He looked at himself in the glass, and\r\nfelt glad at those inner deficiencies in Avice which formerly would have\r\nimpelled him to reject her.\r\n\r\nThere was a strange difference in his regard of his present folly and of\r\nhis love in his youthful time. Now he could be mad with method, knowing\r\nit to be madness: then he was compelled to make believe his madness\r\nwisdom. In those days any flash of reason upon his loved one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimperfections was blurred over hastily and with fear. Such penetrative\r\nvision now did not cool him. He knew he was the creature of a tendency;\r\nand passively acquiesced.\r\n\r\nTo use a practical eye, it appeared that, as he had once thought, this\r\nCaro family--though it might not for centuries, or ever, furbish up\r\nan individual nature which would exactly, ideally, supplement his own\r\nimperfect one and round with it the perfect whole--was yet the only\r\nfamily he had ever met, or was likely to meet, which possessed the\r\nmaterials for her making. It was as if the Caros had found the clay but\r\nnot the potter, while other families whose daughters might attract him\r\nhad found the potter but not the clay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. VIII. HIS OWN SOUL CONFRONTS HIM\r\n\r\nFrom his roomy castle and its grounds and the cliffs hard by he could\r\ncommand every move and aspect of her who was the rejuvenated Spirit\r\nof the Past to him--in the effulgence of whom all sordid details were\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\nAmong other things he observed that she was often anxious when it\r\nrained. If, after a wet day, a golden streak appeared in the sky over\r\nDeadman\xe2\x80\x99s Bay, under a lid of cloud, her manner was joyous and her tread\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThis puzzled him; and he found that if he endeavoured to encounter her\r\nat these times she shunned him--stealthily and subtly, but unmistakably.\r\nOne evening, when she had left her cottage and tripped off in the\r\ndirection of the under-hill townlet, he set out by the same route,\r\nresolved to await her return along the high roadway which stretched\r\nbetween that place and East Quarriers.\r\n\r\nHe reached the top of the old road where it makes a sudden descent to\r\nthe townlet, but she did not appear. Turning back, he sauntered along\r\ntill he had nearly reached his own house again. Then he retraced his\r\nsteps, and in the dim night he walked backwards and forwards on the\r\nbare and lofty convex of the isle; the stars above and around him, the\r\nlighthouse on duty at the distant point, the lightship winking from\r\nthe sandbank, the combing of the pebble beach by the tide beneath, the\r\nchurch away south-westward, where the island fathers lay.\r\n\r\nHe walked the wild summit till his legs ached, and his heart ached--till\r\nhe seemed to hear on the upper wind the stones of the slingers whizzing\r\npast, and the voices of the invaders who annihilated them, and married\r\ntheir wives and daughters, and produced Avice as the ultimate flower of\r\nthe combined stocks. Still she did not come. It was more than foolish to\r\nwait, yet he could not help waiting. At length he discerned a dot of a\r\nfigure, which he knew to be hers rather by its motion than by its shape.\r\n\r\nHow incomparably the immaterial dream dwarfed the grandest of\r\nsubstantial things, when here, between those three sublimities--the\r\nsky, the rock, and the ocean--the minute personality of this washer-girl\r\nfilled his consciousness to its extremest boundary, and the stupendous\r\ninanimate scene shrank to a corner therein.\r\n\r\nBut all at once the approaching figure had disappeared. He looked about;\r\nshe had certainly vanished. At one side of the road was a low wall, but\r\nshe could not have gone behind that without considerable trouble and\r\nsingular conduct. He looked behind him; she had reappeared further on\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nJocelyn Pierston hurried after; and, discerning his movement, Avice\r\nstood still. When he came up, she was slily shaking with restrained\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, what does this mean, my dear girl?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.\r\n\r\nHer inner mirth escaping in spite of her she turned askance and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When you was following me to Street o\xe2\x80\x99 Wells, two hours ago, I looked\r\nround and saw you, and huddied behind a stone! You passed and brushed\r\nmy frock without seeing me. And when, on my way backalong, I saw you\r\nwaiting hereabout again, I slipped over the wall, and ran past you! If\r\nI had not stopped and looked round at \xe2\x80\x98ee, you would never have catched\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you do that for, you elf!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a reason. Give another, dear Avice,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, as he\r\nturned and walked beside her homeward.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated. \xe2\x80\x98Come!\xe2\x80\x99 he urged again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Twas because I thought you wanted to be my young man,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a wild thought of yours! Supposing I did, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you have me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not now.... And not for long, even if it had been sooner than now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I tell you, you won\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at me or let anybody else know?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I will tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 she said quite seriously. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis because I get\r\ntired o\xe2\x80\x99 my lovers as soon as I get to know them well. What I see in one\r\nyoung man for a while soon leaves him and goes into another yonder,\r\nand I follow, and then what I admire fades out of him and springs up\r\nsomewhere else; and so I follow on, and never fix to one. I have\r\nloved FIFTEEN a\xe2\x80\x99ready! Yes, fifteen, I am almost ashamed to say,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nrepeated, laughing. \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it, sir, I assure you. Of course it\r\nis really, to ME, the same one all through, on\xe2\x80\x99y I can\xe2\x80\x99t catch him!\xe2\x80\x99 She\r\nadded anxiously, \xe2\x80\x98You won\xe2\x80\x99t tell anybody o\xe2\x80\x99 this in me, will you, sir?\r\nBecause if it were known I am afraid no man would like me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston was surprised into stillness. Here was this obscure and almost\r\nilliterate girl engaged in the pursuit of the impossible ideal, just as\r\nhe had been himself doing for the last twenty years. She was doing it\r\nquite involuntarily, by sheer necessity of her organization, puzzled all\r\nthe while at her own instinct. He suddenly thought of its bearing upon\r\nhimself, and said, with a sinking heart--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Am I--one of them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe pondered critically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You was; for a week; when I first saw you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only a week?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98About that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What made the being of your fancy forsake my form and go elsewhere?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well--though you seemed handsome and gentlemanly at first--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I found you too old soon after.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a candid young person.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you asked me, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 she expostulated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did; and, having been answered, I won\xe2\x80\x99t intrude upon you longer. So\r\ncut along home as fast as you can. It is getting late.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen she had passed out of earshot he also followed homewards. This\r\nseeking of the Well-Beloved was, then, of the nature of a knife which\r\ncould cut two ways. To be the seeker was one thing: to be one of the\r\ncorpses from which the ideal inhabitant had departed was another; and\r\nthis was what he had become now, in the mockery of new Days.\r\n\r\nThe startling parallel in the idiosyncracies of Avice and\r\nhimself--evinced by the elusiveness of the Beloved with her as with\r\nhim--meant probably that there had been some remote ancestor common\r\nto both families, from whom the trait had latently descended and\r\nrecrudesced. But the result was none the less disconcerting.\r\n\r\nDrawing near his own gate he smelt tobacco, and could discern two\r\nfigures in the side lane leading past Avice\xe2\x80\x99s door. They did not,\r\nhowever, enter her house, but strolled onward to the narrow pass\r\nconducting to Red-King Castle and the sea. He was in momentary heaviness\r\nat the thought that they might be Avice with a worthless lover, but a\r\nfaintly argumentative tone from the man informed him that they were the\r\nsame married couple going homeward whom he had encountered on a previous\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThe next day he gave the servants a half-holiday to get the pretty Avice\r\ninto the castle again for a few hours, the better to observe her. While\r\nshe was pulling down the blinds at sunset a whistle of peculiar quality\r\ncame from some point on the cliffs outside the lawn. He observed that\r\nher colour rose slightly, though she bustled about as if she had noticed\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nPierston suddenly suspected that she had not only fifteen past admirers\r\nbut a current one. Still, he might be mistaken. Stimulated now by\r\nancient memories and present tenderness to use every effort to make her\r\nhis wife, despite her conventional unfitness, he strung himself up to\r\nsift this mystery. If he could only win her--and how could a country\r\ngirl refuse such an opportunity?--he could pack her off to school for\r\ntwo or three years, marry her, enlarge her mind by a little travel, and\r\ntake his chance of the rest. As to her want of ardour for him--so sadly\r\nin contrast with her sainted mother\xe2\x80\x99s affection--a man twenty years\r\nolder than his bride could expect no better, and he would be well\r\ncontent to put up with it in the pleasure of possessing one in whom\r\nseemed to linger as an aroma all the charm of his youth and his early\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. IX. JUXTAPOSITIONS\r\n\r\nIt was a sad and leaden afternoon, and Pierston paced up the long, steep\r\npass or street of the Wells. On either side of the road young girls\r\nstood with pitchers at the fountains which bubbled there, and behind the\r\nhouses forming the propylaea of the rock rose the massive forehead of\r\nthe Isle--crested at this part with its enormous ramparts as with a\r\nmural crown.\r\n\r\nAs you approach the upper end of the street all progress seems about to\r\nbe checked by the almost vertical face of the escarpment. Into it your\r\ntrack apparently runs point-blank: a confronting mass which, if it were\r\nto slip down, would overwhelm the whole town. But in a moment you find\r\nthat the road, the old Roman highway into the peninsula, turns at a\r\nsharp angle when it reaches the base of the scarp, and ascends in the\r\nstiffest of inclines to the right. To the left there is also another\r\nascending road, modern, almost as steep as the first, and perfectly\r\nstraight. This is the road to the forts.\r\n\r\nPierston arrived at the forking of the ways, and paused for breath.\r\nBefore turning to the right, his proper and picturesque course, he\r\nlooked up the uninteresting left road to the fortifications. It was new,\r\nlong, white, regular, tapering to a vanishing point, like a lesson in\r\nperspective. About a quarter of the way up a girl was resting beside a\r\nbasket of white linen: and by the shape of her hat and the nature of her\r\nburden he recognized her.\r\n\r\nShe did not see him, and abandoning the right-hand course he slowly\r\nascended the incline she had taken. He observed that her attention was\r\nabsorbed by something aloft. He followed the direction of her gaze.\r\nAbove them towered the green-grey mountain of grassy stone, here\r\nlevelled at the top by military art. The skyline was broken every now\r\nand then by a little peg-like object--a sentry-box; and near one of\r\nthese a small red spot kept creeping backwards and forwards monotonously\r\nagainst the heavy sky.\r\n\r\nThen he divined that she had a soldier-lover.\r\n\r\nShe turned her head, saw him, and took up her clothes-basket to continue\r\nthe ascent. The steepness was such that to climb it unencumbered was a\r\nbreathless business; the linen made her task a cruelty to her. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnever get to the forts with that weight,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Give it to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut she would not, and he stood still, watching her as she panted up the\r\nway; for the moment an irradiated being, the epitome of a whole sex: by\r\nthe beams of his own infatuation\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98....... robed in such exceeding glory\r\n      That he beheld her not;\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nbeheld her not as she really was, as she was even to himself sometimes.\r\nBut to the soldier what was she? Smaller and smaller she waned up the\r\nrigid mathematical road, still gazing at the soldier aloft, as Pierston\r\ngazed at her. He could just discern sentinels springing up at the\r\ndifferent coigns of vantage that she passed, but seeing who she was they\r\ndid not intercept her; and presently she crossed the drawbridge over the\r\nenormous chasm surrounding the forts, passed the sentries there also,\r\nand disappeared through the arch into the interior. Pierston could not\r\nsee the sentry now, and there occurred to him the hateful idea that this\r\nscarlet rival was meeting and talking freely to her, the unprotected\r\norphan girl of his sweet original Avice; perhaps, relieved of duty,\r\nescorting her across the interior, carrying her basket, her tender body\r\nencircled by his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What the devil are you staring at, as if you were in a trance?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston turned his head: and there stood his old friend Somers--still\r\nlooking the long-leased bachelor that he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I might say what the devil do you do here? if I weren\xe2\x80\x99t so glad to see\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomers said that he had come to see what was detaining his friend in\r\nsuch an out-of-the-way place at that time of year, and incidentally to\r\nget some fresh air into his own lungs. Pierston made him welcome, and\r\nthey went towards Sylvania Castle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were staring, as far as I could see, at a pretty little washerwoman\r\nwith a basket of clothes?\xe2\x80\x99 resumed the painter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; it was that to you, but not to me. Behind the mere pretty\r\nisland-girl (to the world) is, in my eye, the Idea, in Platonic\r\nphraseology--the essence and epitome of all that is desirable in this\r\nexistence.... I am under a doom, Somers. Yes, I am under a doom. To have\r\nbeen always following a phantom whom I saw in woman after woman while\r\nshe was at a distance, but vanishing away on close approach, was bad\r\nenough; but now the terrible thing is that the phantom does NOT vanish,\r\nbut stays to tantalize me even when I am near enough to see what it is!\r\nThat girl holds me, THOUGH my eyes are open, and THOUGH I see that I am\r\na fool!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomers regarded the visionary look of his friend, which rather\r\nintensified than decreased as his years wore on, but made no further\r\nremark. When they reached the castle Somers gazed round upon the\r\nscenery, and Pierston, signifying the quaint little Elizabethan cottage,\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s where she lives.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a romantic place!--and this island altogether. A man might love a\r\nscarecrow or turnip-lantern here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But a woman mightn\xe2\x80\x99t. Scenery doesn\xe2\x80\x99t impress them, though they pretend\r\nit does. This girl is as fickle as--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You once were.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Exactly--from your point of view. She has told me so--candidly. And it\r\nhits me hard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomers stood still in sudden thought. \xe2\x80\x98Well--that IS a strange turning\r\nof the tables!\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really marry her, Pierston?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would--to-morrow. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I? What are fame and name and society\r\nto me--a descendant of wreckers and smugglers, like her. Besides, I know\r\nwhat she\xe2\x80\x99s made of, my boy, to her innermost fibre; I know the perfect\r\nand pure quarry she was dug from: and that gives a man confidence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you\xe2\x80\x99ll win.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile they were sitting after dinner that evening their quiet discourse\r\nwas interrupted by the long low whistle from the cliffs without. Somers\r\ntook no notice, but Pierston marked it. That whistle always occurred\r\nat the same time in the evening when Avice was helping in the house. He\r\nexcused himself for a moment to his visitor and went out upon the dark\r\nlawn. A crunching of feet upon the gravel mixed in with the articulation\r\nof the sea--steps light as if they were winged. And he supposed, two\r\nminutes later, that the mouth of some hulking fellow was upon hers,\r\nwhich he himself hardly ventured to look at, so touching was its young\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nHearing people about--among others the before-mentioned married couple\r\nquarrelling, the woman\xe2\x80\x99s tones having a kinship to Avice\xe2\x80\x99s own--he\r\nreturned to the house. Next day Somers roamed abroad to look for scenery\r\nfor a marine painting, and, going out to seek him, Pierston met Avice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you have a lover, my lady!\xe2\x80\x99 he said severely. She admitted that it\r\nwas the fact. \xe2\x80\x98You won\xe2\x80\x99t stick to him,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I may to THIS one,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, in a meaning tone that he failed\r\nto fathom then. \xe2\x80\x98He deserted me once, but he won\xe2\x80\x99t again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose he\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful sort of fellow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s good enough for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So handsome, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Handsome enough for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So refined and respectable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Refined and respectable enough for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe could not disturb her equanimity, and let her pass. The next day\r\nwas Sunday, and Somers having chosen his view at the other end of the\r\nisland, Pierston determined in the afternoon to see Avice\xe2\x80\x99s lover. He\r\nfound that she had left her cottage stronghold, and went on towards the\r\nlighthouses at the Beal. Turning back when he had reached the nearest,\r\nhe saw on the lonely road between the quarries a young man evidently\r\nconnected with the stone trade, with Avice the Second upon his arm.\r\n\r\nShe looked prettily guilty and blushed a little under his glance.\r\nThe man\xe2\x80\x99s was one of the typical island physiognomies--his features\r\nenergetic and wary in their expression, and half covered with a close,\r\ncrisp black beard. Pierston fancied that out of his keen dark eyes there\r\nglimmered a dry sense of humour at the situation.\r\n\r\nIf so, Avice must have told him of Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s symptoms of tenderness.\r\nThis girl, whom, for her dear mother\xe2\x80\x99s sake more than for her own\r\nunquestionable attractiveness, he would have guarded as the apple of his\r\neye, how could she estimate him so flippantly!\r\n\r\nThe mortification of having brought himself to this position with the\r\nantitype, by his early slight of the type, blinded him for the moment to\r\nwhat struck him a short time after. The man upon whose arm she hung was\r\nnot a soldier. What, then, became of her entranced gaze at the sentinel?\r\nShe could hardly have transferred her affections so promptly; or, to\r\ngive her the benefit of his own theory, her Beloved could scarcely have\r\nflitted from frame to frame in so very brief an interval. And which of\r\nthem had been he who whistled softly in the dusk to her?\r\n\r\nWithout further attempt to find Alfred Somers Pierston walked homeward,\r\nmoodily thinking that the desire to make reparation to the original\r\nwoman by wedding and enriching the copy--which lent such an\r\nunprecedented permanence to his new love--was thwarted, as if by set\r\nintention of his destiny.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the grounds about the castle there stood a carriage.\r\nHe observed that it was not one of the homely flys from the under-hill\r\ntown, but apparently from the popular resort across the bay.\r\nWondering why the visitor had not driven in he entered, to find in the\r\ndrawing-room Nichola Pine-Avon.\r\n\r\nAt his first glance upon her, fashionably dressed and graceful in\r\nmovement, she seemed beautiful; at the second, when he observed that her\r\nface was pale and agitated, she seemed pathetic likewise. Altogether,\r\nshe was now a very different figure from her who, sitting in her chair\r\nwith such finished composure, had snubbed him in her drawing-room in\r\nHamptonshire Square.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are surprised at this? Of course you are!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, in a low,\r\npleading voice, languidly lifting her heavy eyelids, while he was\r\nholding her hand. \xe2\x80\x98But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it! I know I have done something\r\nto offend you--have I not? O! what can it be, that you have come away to\r\nthis outlandish rock, to live with barbarians in the midst of the London\r\nseason?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have not offended me, dear Mrs. Pine-Avon,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98How sorry I\r\nam that you should have supposed it! Yet I am glad, too, that your fancy\r\nshould have done me the good turn of bringing you here to see me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am staying at Budmouth-Regis,\xe2\x80\x99 she explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I did see you at a church-service here a little while back?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe blushed faintly upon her pallor, and she sighed. Their eyes met.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 she said at last, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t show the virtue\r\nof candour. You know what it means. I was the stronger once; now I am\r\nthe weaker. Whatever pain I may have given you in the ups and downs of\r\nour acquaintance I am sorry for, and would willingly repair all errors\r\nof the past by--being amenable to reason in the future.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that Jocelyn should not feel a tender impulsion\r\ntowards this attractive and once independent woman, who from every\r\nworldly point of view was an excellent match for him--a superior match,\r\nindeed, except in money. He took her hand again and held it awhile, and\r\na faint wave of gladness seemed to flow through her. But no--he could go\r\nno further. That island girl, in her coquettish Sunday frock and little\r\nhat with its bunch of cock\xe2\x80\x99s feathers held him as by strands of Manila\r\nrope. He dropped Nichola\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am leaving Budmouth to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98That was why I felt I\r\nmust call. You did not know I had been there all through the Whitsun\r\nholidays?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not, indeed; or I should have come to see you.\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to write. I wish I had, now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you had, too, dear Mrs. Pine-Avon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut it was \xe2\x80\x98Nichola\xe2\x80\x99 that she wanted to be. As they reached the landau\r\nhe told her that he should be back in town himself again soon, and would\r\ncall immediately. At the moment of his words Avice Caro, now alone,\r\npassed close along by the carriage on the other side, towards her house\r\nhard at hand. She did not turn head or eye to the pair: they seemed to\r\nbe in her view objects of indifference.\r\n\r\nPierston became cold as a stone. The chill towards Nichola that the\r\npresence of the girl,--sprite, witch, troll that she was--brought with\r\nit came like a doom. He knew what a fool he was, as he had said. But he\r\nwas powerless in the grasp of the idealizing passion. He cared more for\r\nAvice\xe2\x80\x99s finger-tips than for Mrs. Pine-Avon\xe2\x80\x99s whole personality.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Nichola saw it, for she said mournfully: \xe2\x80\x98Now I have done all\r\nI could! I felt that the only counterpoise to my cruelty to you in my\r\ndrawing-room would be to come as a suppliant to yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is most handsome and noble of you, my very dear friend!\xe2\x80\x99 said he,\r\nwith an emotion of courtesy rather than of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThen adieux were spoken, and she drove away. But Pierston saw only the\r\nretreating Avice, and knew that he was helpless in her hands. The church\r\nof the island had risen near the foundations of the Pagan temple, and\r\na Christian emanation from the former might be wrathfully torturing him\r\nthrough the very false gods to whom he had devoted himself both in\r\nhis craft, like Demetrius of Ephesus, and in his heart. Perhaps Divine\r\npunishment for his idolatries had come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. X. SHE FAILS TO VANISH STILL\r\n\r\nPierston had not turned far back towards the castle when he was\r\novertaken by Somers and the man who carried his painting lumber. They\r\npaced together to the door; the man deposited the articles and went\r\naway, and the two walked up and down before entering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I met an extremely interesting woman in the road out there,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\npainter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, she is! A sprite, a sylph; Psyche indeed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was struck with her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It shows how beauty will out through the homeliest guise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it will; though not always. And this case doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prove it, for\r\nthe lady\xe2\x80\x99s attire was in the latest and most approved taste.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you mean the lady who was driving?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course. What, were you thinking of the pretty little cottage-girl\r\noutside here? I did meet her, but what\xe2\x80\x99s she? Very well for one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npicture, though hardly for one\xe2\x80\x99s fireside. This lady--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Mrs. Pine-Avon. A kind, proud woman, who\xe2\x80\x99ll do what people with\r\nno pride would not condescend to think of. She is leaving Budmouth\r\nto-morrow, and she drove across to see me. You know how things seemed to\r\nbe going with us at one time? But I am no good to any woman. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen very generous towards me, which I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been to her.... She\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nultimately throw herself away upon some wretch unworthy of her, no\r\ndoubt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think so?\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Somers. After a while he said abruptly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll marry her myself, if she\xe2\x80\x99ll have me. I like the look of her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you would, Alfred, or rather could! She has long had an idea\r\nof slipping out of the world of fashion into the world of art. She is a\r\nwoman of individuality and earnest instincts. I am in real trouble about\r\nher. I won\xe2\x80\x99t say she can be won--it would be ungenerous of me to say\r\nthat. But try. I can bring you together easily.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll marry her, if she\xe2\x80\x99s willing!\xe2\x80\x99 With the phlegmatic dogmatism that\r\nwas part of him, Somers added: \xe2\x80\x98When you have decided to marry, take the\r\nfirst nice woman you meet. They are all alike.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well--you don\xe2\x80\x99t know her yet,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Jocelyn, who could give praise\r\nwhere he could not give love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you do, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take her on the strength of your judgment. Is she\r\nreally handsome?--I had but the merest glance. But I know she is, or she\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have caught your discriminating eye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may take my word for it; she looks as well at hand as afar.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What colour are her eyes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her eyes? I don\xe2\x80\x99t go much in for colour, being professionally sworn to\r\nform. But, let me see--grey; and her hair rather light than dark brown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wanted something darker,\xe2\x80\x99 said Somers airily. \xe2\x80\x98There are so many fair\r\nmodels among native Englishwomen. Still, blondes are useful property!...\r\nWell, well; this is flippancy. But I liked the look of her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nSomers had gone back to town. It was a wet day on the little peninsula:\r\nbut Pierston walked out as far as the garden-house of his hired castle,\r\nwhere he sat down and smoked. This erection being on the boundary-wall\r\nof his property his ear could now and then catch the tones of Avice\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice from her open-doored cottage in the lane which skirted his fence;\r\nand he noticed that there were no modulations in it. He knew why that\r\nwas. She wished to go out, and could not. He had observed before that\r\nwhen she was planning an outing a particular note would come into her\r\nvoice during the preceding hours: a dove\xe2\x80\x99s roundness of sound; no doubt\r\nthe effect upon her voice of her thoughts of her lover, or lovers. Yet\r\nthe latter it could not be. She was pure and singlehearted: half an eye\r\ncould see that. Whence, then, the two men? Possibly the quarrier was a\r\nrelation.\r\n\r\nThere seemed reason in this when, going out into the lane, he\r\nencountered one of the red jackets he had been thinking of. Soldiers\r\nwere seldom seen in this outer part of the isle: their beat from the\r\nforts, when on pleasure, was in the opposite direction, and this man\r\nmust have had a special reason for coming hither. Pierston surveyed him.\r\nHe was a round-faced, good-humoured fellow to look at, having two little\r\npieces of moustache on his upper lip, like a pair of minnows rampant,\r\nand small black eyes, over which the Glengarry cap straddled flat. It\r\nwas a hateful idea that her tender cheek should be kissed by the lips\r\nof this heavy young man, who had never been sublimed by a single battle,\r\neven with defenceless savages.\r\n\r\nThe soldier went before her house, looked at the door, and moved on down\r\nthe crooked way to the cliffs, where there was a path back to the forts.\r\nBut he did not adopt it, returning by the way he had come. This showed\r\nhis wish to pass the house again. She gave no sign, however, and the\r\nsoldier disappeared.\r\n\r\nPierston could not be satisfied that Avice was in the house, and he\r\ncrossed over to the front of her little freehold and tapped at the door,\r\nwhich stood ajar.\r\n\r\nNobody came: hearing a slight movement within he crossed the threshold.\r\nAvice was there alone, sitting on a low stool in a dark corner, as\r\nthough she wished to be unobserved by any casual passer-by. She looked\r\nup at him without emotion or apparent surprise; but he could then see\r\nthat she was crying. The view, for the first time, of distress in\r\nan unprotected young girl towards whom he felt drawn by ties of\r\nextraordinary delicacy and tenderness, moved Pierston beyond measure. He\r\nentered without ceremony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Avice, my dear girl!\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Something is the matter!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked assent, and he went on: \xe2\x80\x98Now tell me all about it. Perhaps I\r\ncan help you. Come, tell me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured. \xe2\x80\x98Grammer Stockwool is upstairs, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhear!\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Stockwool was the old woman who had come to live with the\r\ngirl for company since her mother\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then come into my garden opposite. There we shall be quite private.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe rose, put on her hat, and accompanied him to the door. Here she\r\nasked him if the lane were empty, and on his assuring her that it was\r\nshe crossed over and entered with him through the garden-wall.\r\n\r\nThe place was a shady and secluded one, though through the boughs the\r\nsea could be seen quite near at hand, its moanings being distinctly\r\naudible. A water-drop from a tree fell here and there, but the rain was\r\nnot enough to hurt them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now let me hear it,\xe2\x80\x99 he said soothingly. \xe2\x80\x98You may tell me with the\r\ngreatest freedom. I was a friend of your mother\xe2\x80\x99s, you know. That is, I\r\nknew her; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be a friend of yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe statement was risky, if he wished her not to suspect him of being\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s false one. But that lover\xe2\x80\x99s name appeared to be unknown to\r\nthe present Avice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied unwillingly; \xe2\x80\x98except that it has to\r\ndo with my own changeableness. The rest is the secret of somebody else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry for that,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am getting to care for one I ought not to think of, and it means\r\nruin. I ought to get away!\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mean from the island?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston reflected. His presence in London had been desired for some\r\ntime; yet he had delayed going because of his new solicitudes here. But\r\nto go and take her with him would afford him opportunity of watching\r\nover her, tending her mind, and developing it; while it might remove\r\nher from some looming danger. It was a somewhat awkward guardianship for\r\nhim, as a lonely man, to carry out; still, it could be done. He asked\r\nher abruptly if she would really like to go away for a while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I like best to stay here,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered. \xe2\x80\x98Still, I should not mind\r\ngoing somewhere, because I think I ought to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would you like London?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAvice\xe2\x80\x99s face lost its weeping shape. \xe2\x80\x98How could that be?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been thinking that you could come to my house and make yourself\r\nuseful in some way. I rent just now one of those new places called\r\nflats, which you may have heard of; and I have a studio at the back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard of \xe2\x80\x98em,\xe2\x80\x99 she said without interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I have two servants there, and as my man has a holiday you can\r\nhelp them for a month or two.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would polishing furniture be any good? I can do that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t much furniture that requires polishing. But you can clear\r\naway plaster and clay messes in the studio, and chippings of stone,\r\nand help me in modelling, and dust all my Venus failures, and hands and\r\nheads and feet and bones, and other objects.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was startled, yet attracted by the novelty of the proposal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only for a time?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only for a time. As short as you like, and as long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe deliberate manner in which, after the first surprise, Avice\r\ndiscussed the arrangements that he suggested, might have told him\r\nhow far was any feeling for himself beyond friendship, and possibly\r\ngratitude, from agitating her breast. Yet there was nothing extravagant\r\nin the discrepancy between their ages, and he hoped, after shaping her\r\nto himself, to win her. What had grieved her to tears she would not more\r\nparticularly tell.\r\n\r\nShe had naturally not much need of preparation, but she made even less\r\npreparation than he would have expected her to require. She seemed eager\r\nto be off immediately, and not a soul was to know of her departure. Why,\r\nif she were in love and at first averse to leave the island, she should\r\nbe so precipitate now he failed to understand.\r\n\r\nBut he took great care to compromise in no way a girl in whom his\r\ninterest was as protective as it was passionate. He accordingly left her\r\nto get out of the island alone, awaiting her at a station a few miles\r\nup the railway, where, discovering himself to her through the\r\ncarriage-window, he entered the next compartment, his frame pervaded by\r\na glow which was almost joy at having for the first time in his charge\r\none who inherited the flesh and bore the name so early associated with\r\nhis own, and at the prospect of putting things right which had been\r\nwrong through many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. XI. THE IMAGE PERSISTS\r\n\r\nIt was dark when the four-wheeled cab wherein he had brought Avice from\r\nthe station stood at the entrance to the pile of flats of which Pierston\r\noccupied one floor--rarer then as residences in London than they are\r\nnow. Leaving Avice to alight and get the luggage taken in by the porter\r\nPierston went upstairs. To his surprise his floor was silent, and on\r\nentering with a latchkey the rooms were all in darkness. He descended\r\nto the hall, where Avice was standing helpless beside the luggage, while\r\nthe porter was outside with the cabman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know what has become of my servants?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Jocelyn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What--and ain\xe2\x80\x99t they there, saur? Ah, then my belief is that what I\r\nsuspected is thrue! You didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave your wine-cellar unlocked, did you,\r\nsaur, by no mistake?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston considered. He thought he might have left the key with his\r\nelder servant, whom he had believed he could trust, especially as the\r\ncellar was not well stocked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, then it was so! She\xe2\x80\x99s been very queer, saur, this last week or two.\r\nO yes, sending messages down the spakin\xe2\x80\x99-tube which were like madness\r\nitself, and ordering us this and that, till we would take no notice at\r\nall. I see them both go out last night, and possibly they went for a\r\nholiday not expecting ye, or maybe for good! Shure, if ye\xe2\x80\x99d written,\r\nsaur, I\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 got the place ready, ye being out of a man, too, though\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not me duty at all!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen Pierston got to his floor again he found that the cellar door was\r\nopen; some bottles were standing empty that had been full, and many\r\nabstracted altogether. All other articles in the house, however,\r\nappeared to be intact. His letter to his housekeeper lay in the box as\r\nthe postman had left it.\r\n\r\nBy this time the luggage had been sent up in the lift; and Avice, like\r\nso much more luggage, stood at the door, the hall-porter behind offering\r\nhis assistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come here, Avice,\xe2\x80\x99 said the sculptor. \xe2\x80\x98What shall we do now? Here\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npretty state of affairs!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAvice could suggest nothing, till she was struck with the bright thought\r\nthat she should light a fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Light a fire?--ah, yes.... I wonder if we could manage. This is an odd\r\ncoincidence--and awkward!\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured. \xe2\x80\x98Very well, light a fire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is this the kitchen, sir, all mixed up with the parlours?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I think I can do all that\xe2\x80\x99s wanted here for a bit; at any rate,\r\ntill you can get help, sir. At least, I could if I could find the\r\nfuel-house. \xe2\x80\x98Tis no such big place as I thought!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s right: take courage!\xe2\x80\x99 said he with a tender smile. \xe2\x80\x98Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndine out this evening, and leave the place for you to arrange as best\r\nyou can with the help of the porter\xe2\x80\x99s wife downstairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis Pierston accordingly did, and so their common residence began.\r\nFeeling more and more strongly that some danger awaited her in her\r\nnative island he determined not to send her back till the lover or\r\nlovers who seemed to trouble her should have cooled off. He was quite\r\nwilling to take the risk of his action thus far in his solicitous regard\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *           *\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a dual solitude, indeed; for, though Pierston and Avice were the\r\nonly two people in the flat, they did not keep each other company, the\r\nformer being as scrupulously fearful of going near her now that he had\r\nthe opportunity as he had been prompt to seek her when he had none. They\r\nlived in silence, his messages to her being frequently written on scraps\r\nof paper deposited where she could see them. It was not without a pang\r\nthat he noted her unconsciousness of their isolated position--a position\r\nto which, had she experienced any reciprocity of sentiment, she would\r\nreadily have been alive.\r\n\r\nConsidering that, though not profound, she was hardly a matter-of-fact\r\ngirl as that phrase is commonly understood, she was exasperating in the\r\nmatter-of-fact quality of her responses to the friendly remarks which\r\nwould escape him in spite of himself, as well as in her general conduct.\r\nWhenever he formed some culinary excuse for walking across the few yards\r\nof tessellated hall which separated his room from the kitchen, and spoke\r\nthrough the doorway to her, she answered, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwithout turning her eyes from the particular work that she was engaged\r\nin.\r\n\r\nIn the usual course he would have obtained a couple of properly\r\nqualified servants immediately; but he lived on with the one, or rather\r\nthe less than one, that this cottage-girl afforded. It had been his\r\nalmost invariable custom to dine at one of his clubs. Now he sat at home\r\nover the miserable chop or steak to which he limited himself in dread\r\nlest she should complain of there being too much work for one person,\r\nand demand to be sent home. A charwoman came every two or three days,\r\neffecting an extraordinary consumption of food and alcoholic liquids:\r\nyet it was not for this that Pierston dreaded her presence, but lest, in\r\nconversing with Avice, she should open the girl\xe2\x80\x99s eyes to the oddity of\r\nher situation. Avice could see for herself that there must have been two\r\nor three servants in the flat during his former residence there: but his\r\nreasons for doing without them seemed never to strike her.\r\n\r\nHis intention had been to keep her occupied exclusively at the studio,\r\nbut accident had modified this. However, he sent her round one morning,\r\nand entering himself shortly after found her engaged in wiping the\r\nlayers of dust from the casts and models.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the dust never ceased to amaze her. \xe2\x80\x98It is like the hold\r\nof a Budmouth collier,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98and the beautiful faces of these clay\r\npeople are quite spoilt by it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll marry some day, Avice?\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Pierston, as he\r\nregarded her thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some do and some don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, with a reserved smile, still\r\nattending to the casts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are very offhand,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\nShe archly weighed that remark without further speech. It was\r\ntantalizing conduct in the face of his instinct to cherish her;\r\nespecially when he regarded the charm of her bending profile; the\r\nwell-characterized though softly lined nose, the round chin with, as\r\nit were, a second leap in its curve to the throat, and the sweep of the\r\neyelashes over the rosy cheek during the sedulously lowered glance. How\r\nfutilely he had laboured to express the character of that face in clay,\r\nand, while catching it in substance, had yet lost something that was\r\nessential!\r\n\r\nThat evening after dusk, in the stress of writing letters, he sent\r\nher out for stamps. She had been absent some quarter of an hour when,\r\nsuddenly drawing himself up from over his writing-table, it flashed upon\r\nhim that he had absolutely forgotten her total ignorance of London.\r\n\r\nThe head post-office, to which he had sent her because it was late,\r\nwas two or three streets off, and he had made his request in the most\r\ngeneral manner, which she had acceded to with alacrity enough. How could\r\nhe have done such an unreflecting thing?\r\n\r\nPierston went to the window. It was half-past nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and owing to\r\nher absence the blinds were not down. He opened the casement and stepped\r\nout upon the balcony. The green shade of his lamp screened its rays from\r\nthe gloom without. Over the opposite square the moon hung, and to the\r\nright there stretched a long street, filled with a diminishing array of\r\nlamps, some single, some in clusters, among them an occasional blue or\r\nred one. From a corner came the notes of a piano-organ strumming out a\r\nstirring march of Rossini\xe2\x80\x99s. The shadowy black figures of pedestrians\r\nmoved up, down, and across the embrowned roadway. Above the roofs was a\r\nbank of livid mist, and higher a greenish-blue sky, in which stars were\r\nvisible, though its lower part was still pale with daylight, against\r\nwhich rose chimney-pots in the form of elbows, prongs, and fists.\r\n\r\nFrom the whole scene proceeded a ground rumble, miles in extent, upon\r\nwhich individual rattles, voices, a tin whistle, the bark of a dog, rode\r\nlike bubbles on a sea. The whole noise impressed him with the sense that\r\nno one in its enormous mass ever required rest.\r\n\r\nIn this illimitable ocean of humanity there was a unit of existence, his\r\nAvice, wandering alone.\r\n\r\nPierston looked at his watch. She had been gone half an hour. It was\r\nimpossible to distinguish her at this distance, even if she approached.\r\nHe came inside, and putting on his hat determined to go out and seek\r\nher. He reached the end of the street, and there was nothing of her to\r\nbe seen. She had the option of two or three routes from this point to\r\nthe post-office; yet he plunged at random into one, till he reached the\r\noffice to find it quite deserted. Almost distracted now by his anxiety\r\nfor her he retreated as rapidly as he had come, regaining home only to\r\nfind that she had not returned.\r\n\r\nHe recollected telling her that if she should ever lose her way she must\r\ncall a cab and drive home. It occurred to him that this was what she\r\nwould do now. He again went out upon the balcony; the dignified street\r\nin which he lived was almost vacant, and the lamps stood like placed\r\nsentinels awaiting some procession which tarried long. At a point under\r\nhim where the road was torn up there stood a red light, and at\r\nthe corner two men were talking in leisurely repose, as if sunning\r\nthemselves at noonday. Lovers of a feline disposition, who were never\r\nseen by daylight, joked and darted at each other in and out of area\r\ngates.\r\n\r\nHis attention was fixed on the cabs, and he held his breath as the\r\nhollow clap of each horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoofs drew near the front of the house, only\r\nto go onward into the square. The two lamps of each vehicle afar dilated\r\nwith its near approach, and seemed to swerve towards him. It was Avice\r\nsurely? No, it passed by.\r\n\r\nAlmost frantic he again descended and let himself out of the house,\r\nmoving towards a more central part, where the roar still continued.\r\nBefore emerging into the noisy thoroughfare he observed a small figure\r\napproaching leisurely along the opposite side, and hastened across to\r\nfind it was she.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. XII. A GRILLE DESCENDS BETWEEN\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Avice!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, with the tenderly subdued scolding of a mother.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is this you have done to alarm me so!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe seemed unconscious of having done anything, and was altogether\r\nsurprised at his anxiety. In his relief he did not speak further till he\r\nasked her suddenly if she would take his arm since she must be tired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 she assured him, \xe2\x80\x98I am not a bit tired, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t require\r\nany help at all, thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey went upstairs without using the lift, and he let her and himself in\r\nwith his latchkey. She entered the kitchen, and he, following, sat down\r\nin a chair there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where have you been?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, with almost angered concern on his face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ought not to have been absent more than ten minutes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knew there was nothing for me to do, and thought I should like to see\r\na little of London,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied naively. \xe2\x80\x98So when I had got the stamps\r\nI went on into the fashionable streets, where ladies are all walking\r\nabout just as if it were daytime! \xe2\x80\x98Twas for all the world like coming\r\nhome by night from Martinmas Fair at the Street o\xe2\x80\x99 Wells, only more\r\ngenteel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Avice, Avice, you must not go out like this! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that I am\r\nresponsible for your safety? I am your--well, guardian, in fact, and am\r\nbound by law and morals, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what-all, to deliver you up to\r\nyour native island without a scratch or blemish. And yet you indulge in\r\nsuch a midnight vagary as this!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I am sure, sir, the gentlemen in the street were more respectable\r\nthan they are anywhere at home! They were dressed in the latest fashion,\r\nand would have scorned to do me any harm; and as to their love-making, I\r\nnever heard anything so polite before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, you must not do it again. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you some day why. What\xe2\x80\x99s that\r\nyou have in your hand?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A mouse-trap. There are lots of mice in this kitchen--sooty mice, not\r\nclean like ours--and I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d try to catch them. That was what I\r\nwent so far to buy, as there were no shops open just about here. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nset it now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe proceeded at once to do so, and Pierston remained in his seat\r\nregarding the operation, which seemed entirely to engross her. It\r\nwas extraordinary, indeed, to observe how she wilfully limited her\r\ninterests; with what content she received the ordinary things that life\r\noffered, and persistently refused to behold what an infinitely extended\r\nlife lay open to her through him. If she had only said the word he would\r\nhave got a licence and married her the next morning. Was it possible\r\nthat she did not perceive this tendency in him? She could hardly be a\r\nwoman if she did not; and in her airy, elusive, offhand demeanour she\r\nwas very much of a woman indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It only holds one mouse,\xe2\x80\x99 he said absently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I shall hear it throw in the night, and set it again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe sighed and left her to her own resources and retired to rest, though\r\nhe felt no tendency to sleep. At some small hour of the darkness,\r\nowing, possibly, to some intervening door being left open, he heard\r\nthe mouse-trap click. Another light sleeper must have heard it too, for\r\nalmost immediately after the pit-pat of naked feet, accompanied by the\r\nbrushing of drapery, was audible along the passage towards the kitchen.\r\nAfter her absence in that apartment long enough to reset the trap, he\r\nwas startled by a scream from the same quarter. Pierston sprang out of\r\nbed, jumped into his dressing-gown, and hastened in the direction of the\r\ncry.\r\n\r\nAvice, barefooted and wrapped in a shawl, was standing in a chair; the\r\nmouse-trap lay on the floor, the mouse running round and round in its\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was trying to take en out,\xe2\x80\x99 said she excitedly, \xe2\x80\x98and he got away from\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston secured the mouse while she remained standing on the chair.\r\nThen, having set the trap anew, his feeling burst out petulantly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A girl like you to throw yourself away upon such a commonplace fellow\r\nas that quarryman! Why do you do it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer mind was so intently fixed upon the matter in hand that it was\r\nsome moments before she caught his irrelevant subject. \xe2\x80\x98Because I am a\r\nfoolish girl,\xe2\x80\x99 she said quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you love him?\xe2\x80\x99 said Jocelyn, with a surprised stare up at\r\nher as she stood, in her concern appearing the very Avice who had kissed\r\nhim twenty years earlier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not much use to talk about that,\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, is it the soldier?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, though I have never spoken to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never spoken to the soldier?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has either one treated you badly--deceived you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. Certainly not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t make you out; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to know more than you\r\nchoose to tell me. Come, Avice, why not tell me exactly how things are?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not now, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, her pretty pink face and brown eyes turned in\r\nsimple appeal to him from her pedestal. \xe2\x80\x98I will tell you all to-morrow;\r\nan that I will!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe retreated to his own room and lay down meditating. Some quarter of an\r\nhour after she had retreated to hers the mouse-trap clicked again, and\r\nPierston raised himself on his elbow to listen. The place was so still\r\nand the jerry-built door-panels so thin that he could hear the mouse\r\njumping about inside the wires of the trap. But he heard no footstep\r\nthis time. As he was wakeful and restless he again arose, proceeded\r\nto the kitchen with a light, and removing the mouse reset the trap.\r\nReturning he listened once more. He could see in the far distance the\r\ndoor of Avice\xe2\x80\x99s room; but that thoughtful housewife had not heard the\r\nsecond capture. From the room came a soft breathing like that of an\r\ninfant.\r\n\r\nHe entered his own chamber and reclined himself gloomily enough. Her\r\nlack of all consciousness of him, the aspect of the deserted kitchen,\r\nthe cold grate, impressed him with a deeper sense of loneliness than he\r\nhad ever felt before.\r\n\r\nFoolish he was, indeed, to be so devoted to this young woman. Her\r\ndefencelessness, her freedom from the least thought that there lurked a\r\ndanger in their propinquity, were in fact secondary safeguards, not much\r\nless strong than that of her being her mother\xe2\x80\x99s image, against risk to\r\nher from him. Yet it was out of this that his depression came.\r\n\r\nAt sight of her the next morning Pierston felt that he must put an end\r\nto such a state of things. He sent Avice off to the studio, wrote to an\r\nagent for a couple of servants, and then went round to his work. Avice\r\nwas busy righting all that she was allowed to touch. It was the girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelight to be occupied among the models and casts, which for the first\r\ntime she regarded with the wistful interest of a soul struggling to\r\nreceive ideas of beauty vaguely discerned yet ever eluding her. That\r\nbrightness in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s mind which might have descended to the second\r\nAvice with the maternal face and form, had been dimmed by admixture with\r\nthe mediocrity of her father\xe2\x80\x99s, and by one who remembered like Pierston\r\nthe dual organization the opposites could be often seen wrestling\r\ninternally.\r\n\r\nThey were alone in the studio, and his feelings found vent. Putting his\r\narms round her he said, \xe2\x80\x98My darling, sweet little Avice! I want to ask\r\nyou something--surely you guess what? I want to know this: will you be\r\nmarried to me, and live here with me always and ever?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, Mr. Pierston, what nonsense!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, shrinking somewhat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, why? Am I too old? Surely there\xe2\x80\x99s no serious difference?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no--I should not mind that if it came to marrying. The difference\r\nis not much for husband and wife, though it is rather much for keeping\r\ncompany.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe struggled to get free, and when in the movement she knocked down the\r\nEmpress Faustina\xe2\x80\x99s head he did not try to retain her. He saw that she\r\nwas not only surprised but a little alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You haven\xe2\x80\x99t said why it is nonsense!\xe2\x80\x99 he remarked tartly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you was thinking of me like that. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any\r\nthought of it! And all alone here! What shall I do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say yes, my pretty Avice! We\xe2\x80\x99ll then go out and be married at once, and\r\nnobody be any the wiser.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \xe2\x80\x98I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be well for you. You don\xe2\x80\x99t like me, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes I do--very much. But not in that sort of way--quite. Still, I might\r\nhave got to love you in time, if--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, then, try,\xe2\x80\x99 he said warmly. \xe2\x80\x98Your mother did!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the words slipped out than Pierston would have recalled\r\nthem. He had felt in a moment that they jeopardized his cause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mother loved you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Avice, incredulously gazing at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were not her false young man, surely? That one who--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes! Say no more about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who ran away from her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Almost.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I can NEVER, NEVER like you again! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was a\r\ngentleman--I--I thought--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a gentleman, then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, sir, please go away! I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear the sight of \xe2\x80\x98ee at this moment!\r\nPerhaps I shall get to--to like you as I did; but--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; I\xe2\x80\x99m d----d if I\xe2\x80\x99ll go away!\xe2\x80\x99 said Pierston, thoroughly irritated.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been candid with you; you ought to be the same with me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you want me to tell?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Enough to make it clear to me why you don\xe2\x80\x99t accept this offer.\r\nEverything you have said yet is a reason for the reverse. Now, my dear,\r\nI am not angry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes you are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No I\xe2\x80\x99m not. Now what is your reason?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The name of it is Isaac Pierston, down home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean he courted me, and led me on to island custom, and then I went\r\nto chapel one morning and married him in secret, because mother didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare about him; and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t either by that time. And then he quarrelled\r\nwith me; and just before you and I came to London he went away to\r\nGuernsey. Then I saw a soldier; I never knew his name, but I fell in\r\nlove with him because I am so quick at that! Still, as it was wrong, I\r\ntried not to think of him, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look at him when he passed. But\r\nit made me cry very much that I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t. I was then very miserable, and\r\nyou asked me to come to London. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care what I did with myself,\r\nand I came.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Heaven above us!\xe2\x80\x99 said Pierston, his pale and distressed face showing\r\nwith what a shock this announcement had come. \xe2\x80\x98Why have you done such\r\nextraordinary things? Or, rather, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me of this\r\nbefore? Then, at the present moment you are the wife of a man who is in\r\nGuernsey, whom you do not love at all; but instead of him love a soldier\r\nwhom you have never spoken to; while I have nearly brought scandal\r\nupon us both by your letting me love you. Really, you are a very wicked\r\nwoman!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I am not!\xe2\x80\x99 she pouted.\r\n\r\nStill, Avice looked pale and rather frightened, and did not lift her\r\neyes from the floor. \xe2\x80\x98I said it was nonsense in you to want to have me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe went on, \xe2\x80\x98and, even if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been married to that horrid Isaac\r\nPierston, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have married you after you told me that you was the\r\nman who ran away from my mother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have paid the penalty!\xe2\x80\x99 he said sadly. \xe2\x80\x98Men of my sort always get\r\nthe worst of it somehow. Though I never did your mother any harm. Now,\r\nAvice--I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you dear Avice for your mother\xe2\x80\x99s sake and not for your\r\nown--I must see what I can do to help you out of the difficulty that\r\nunquestionably you are in. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you love your husband now you have\r\nmarried him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAvice looked aside at the statuary as if the subtleties of her\r\norganization were not very easy to define.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was he that black-bearded typical local character I saw you walking\r\nwith one Sunday? The same surname as mine; though, of course, you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnotice that in a place where there are only half-a-dozen surnames?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, that was Ike. It was that evening we disagreed. He scolded me, and\r\nI answered him (you must have heard us); and the next day he went away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, as I say, I must consider what it will be best to do for you\r\nin this. The first thing, it seems to me, will be to get your husband\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe impatiently shrugged her shoulders. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then why did you marry him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was obliged to, after we\xe2\x80\x99d proved each other by island custom.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought of such a thing. It is ridiculous and out of\r\ndate nowadays.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, he\xe2\x80\x99s so old-fashioned in his notions that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think like\r\nthat. However, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--it is only a tiff between you, I dare say. I\xe2\x80\x99ll start him in\r\nbusiness if he\xe2\x80\x99ll come.... Is the cottage at home still in your hands?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it is my freehold. Grammer Stockwool is taking care o\xe2\x80\x99 it for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good. And back there you go straightway, my pretty madam, and wait till\r\nyour husband comes to make it up with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t go!--I don\xe2\x80\x99t want him to come!\xe2\x80\x99 she sobbed. \xe2\x80\x98I want to stay\r\nhere with you, or anywhere, except where he can come!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will get over that. Now, go back to the flat, there\xe2\x80\x99s a dear Avice,\r\nand be ready in one hour, waiting in the hall for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I say you shall!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe found it was no use to disobey. Precisely at the moment appointed\r\nhe met her there himself, burdened only with a valise and umbrella, she\r\nwith a box and other things. Directing the porter to put Avice and her\r\nbelongings into a four-wheeled cab for the railway-station, he walked\r\nonward from the door, and kept looking behind, till he saw the cab\r\napproaching. He then entered beside the astonished girl, and onward they\r\nwent together.\r\n\r\nThey sat opposite each other in an empty compartment, and the tedious\r\nrailway journey began. Regarding her closely now by the light of\r\nher revelation he wondered at himself for never divining her secret.\r\nWhenever he looked at her the girl\xe2\x80\x99s eyes grew rebellious, and at last\r\nshe wept.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to him!\xe2\x80\x99 she sobbed in a miserable voice.\r\n\r\nPierston was almost as much distressed as she. \xe2\x80\x98Why did you put yourself\r\nand me in such a position?\xe2\x80\x99 he said bitterly. \xe2\x80\x98It is no use to regret\r\nit now! And I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I do. It affords me a way out of a trying\r\nposition. Even if you had not been married to him you would not have\r\nmarried me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I would, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What! You would? You said you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t not long ago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I like you better now! I like you more and more!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston sighed, for emotionally he was not much older than she. That\r\nhitch in his development, rendering him the most lopsided of God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncreatures, was his standing misfortune. A proposal to her which crossed\r\nhis mind was dismissed as disloyalty, particularly to an inexperienced\r\nfellow-islander and one who was by race and traditions almost a\r\nkinswoman.\r\n\r\nLittle more passed between the twain on that wretched,\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten day. Aphrodite, Ashtaroth, Freyja, or whoever the\r\nlove-queen of his isle might have been, was punishing him sharply, as\r\nshe knew but too well how to punish her votaries when they reverted from\r\nthe ephemeral to the stable mood. When was it to end--this curse of his\r\nheart not ageing while his frame moved naturally onward? Perhaps only\r\nwith life.\r\n\r\nHis first act the day after depositing her in her own house was to go\r\nto the chapel where, by her statement, the marriage had been solemnized,\r\nand make sure of the fact. Perhaps he felt an illogical hope that she\r\nmight be free, even then, in the tarnished condition which such freedom\r\nwould have involved. However, there stood the words distinctly: Isaac\r\nPierston, Ann Avice Caro, son and daughter of So-and-so, married on such\r\na day, signed by the contracting parties, the officiating minister, and\r\nthe two witnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. XIII. SHE IS ENSHROUDED FROM SIGHT\r\n\r\nOne evening in early winter, when the air was dry and gusty, the dark\r\nlittle lane which divided the grounds of Sylvania Castle from the\r\ncottage of Avice, and led down to the adjoining ruin of Red-King Castle,\r\nwas paced by a solitary man. The cottage was the centre of his beat; its\r\nwestern limit being the gates of the former residence, its eastern the\r\ndrawbridge of the ruin. The few other cottages thereabout--all as if\r\ncarved from the solid rock--were in darkness, but from the upper window\r\nof Avice\xe2\x80\x99s tiny freehold glimmered a light. Its rays were repeated from\r\nthe far-distant sea by the lightship lying moored over the mysterious\r\nShambles quicksand, which brought tamelessness and domesticity into due\r\nposition as balanced opposites.\r\n\r\nThe sea moaned--more than moaned--among the boulders below the ruins,\r\na throe of its tide being timed to regular intervals. These sounds were\r\naccompanied by an equally periodic moan from the interior of the cottage\r\nchamber; so that the articulate heave of water and the articulate\r\nheave of life seemed but differing utterances of the selfsame troubled\r\nterrestrial Being--which in one sense they were.\r\n\r\nPierston--for the man in the lane was he--would look from lightship to\r\ncottage window; then back again, as he waited there between the travail\r\nof the sea without, and the travail of the woman within. Soon an\r\ninfant\xe2\x80\x99s wail of the very feeblest was also audible in the house. He\r\nstarted from his easy pacing, and went again westward, standing at the\r\nelbow of the lane a long time. Then the peace of the sleeping village\r\nwhich lay that way was broken by light wheels and the trot of a horse.\r\nPierston went back to the cottage gate and awaited the arrival of the\r\nvehicle.\r\n\r\nIt was a light cart, and a man jumped down as it stopped. He was in a\r\nbroad-brimmed hat, under which no more of him could be perceived than\r\nthat he wore a black beard clipped like a yew fence--a typical aspect in\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are Avice\xe2\x80\x99s husband?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the sculptor quickly.\r\n\r\nThe man replied that he was, in the local accent. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve just come in by\r\nto-day\xe2\x80\x99s boat,\xe2\x80\x99 he added. \xe2\x80\x98I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t git here avore. I had contracted\r\nfor the job at Peter-Port, and had to see to\xe2\x80\x99t to the end.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pierston, \xe2\x80\x98your coming means that you are willing to make\r\nit up with her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know but I be,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man. \xe2\x80\x98Mid so well do that as\r\nanything else!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you do, thoroughly, a good business in your old line awaits you here\r\nin the island.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wi\xe2\x80\x99 all my heart, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man. His voice was energetic, and,\r\nthough slightly touchy, it showed, on the whole, a disposition to set\r\nthings right.\r\n\r\nThe driver of the trap was paid off, and Jocelyn and Isaac\r\nPierston--undoubtedly scions of a common stock in this isle of\r\nintermarriages, though they had no proof of it--entered the house.\r\nNobody was in the ground-floor room, in the centre of which stood a\r\nsquare table, in the centre of the table a little wool mat, and in the\r\ncentre of the mat a lamp, the apartment having the appearance of being\r\nrigidly swept and set in order for an event of interest.\r\n\r\nThe woman who lived in the house with Avice now came downstairs, and\r\nto the inquiry of the comers she replied that matters were progressing\r\nfavourably, but that nobody could be allowed to go upstairs just then.\r\nAfter placing chairs and viands for them she retreated, and they sat\r\ndown, the lamp between them--the lover of the sufferer above, who had no\r\nright to her, and the man who had every right to her, but did not love\r\nher. Engaging in desultory and fragmentary conversation they listened\r\nto the trampling of feet on the floor-boards overhead--Pierston full of\r\nanxiety and attentiveness, Ike awaiting the course of nature calmly.\r\n\r\nSoon they heard the feeble bleats repeated, and then the local\r\npractitioner descended and entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How is she now?\xe2\x80\x99 said Pierston, the more taciturn Ike looking up with\r\nhim for the answer that he felt would serve for two as well as for one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Doing well, remarkably well,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the professional gentleman, with\r\na manner of having said it in other places; and his vehicle not being at\r\nthe door he sat down and shared some refreshment with the others. When\r\nhe had departed Mrs. Stockwool again stepped down, and informed them\r\nthat Ike\xe2\x80\x99s presence had been made known to his wife.\r\n\r\nThe truant quarrier seemed rather inclined to stay where he was and\r\nfinish the mug of ale, but Pierston quickened him, and he ascended the\r\nstaircase. As soon as the lower room was empty Pierston leant with his\r\nelbows on the table, and covered his face with his hands.\r\n\r\nIke was absent no great time. Descending with a proprietary mien that\r\nhad been lacking before, he invited Jocelyn to ascend likewise, since\r\nshe had stated that she would like to see him. Jocelyn went up the\r\ncrooked old steps, the husband remaining below.\r\n\r\nAvice, though white as the sheets, looked brighter and happier than he\r\nhad expected to find her, and was apparently very much fortified by the\r\npink little lump at her side. She held out her hand to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I just wanted to tell \xe2\x80\x98ee,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, striving against her feebleness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought it would be no harm to see you, though \xe2\x80\x98tis rather soon--to\r\ntell \xe2\x80\x98ee how very much I thank you for getting me settled again with\r\nIke. He is very glad to come home again, too, he says. Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99ve done\r\na good many kind things for me, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhether she were really glad, or whether the words were expressed as a\r\nmatter of duty, Pierston did not attempt to learn.\r\n\r\nHe merely said that he valued her thanks. \xe2\x80\x98Now, Avice,\xe2\x80\x99 he added\r\ntenderly, \xe2\x80\x98I resign my guardianship of you. I hope to see your husband\r\nin a sound little business here in a very short time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope so--for baby\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, with a bright sigh. \xe2\x80\x98Would\r\nyou--like to see her, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The baby? O yes--YOUR baby! You must christen her Avice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--so I will!\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured readily, and disclosed the infant\r\nwith some timidity. \xe2\x80\x98I hope you forgive me, sir, for concealing my\r\nthoughtless marriage!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you forgive me for making love to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. How were you to know! I wish--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston bade her good-bye, kissing her hand; turned from her and the\r\nincipient being whom he was to meet again under very altered conditions,\r\nand left the bed-chamber with a tear in his eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here endeth that dream!\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *****\r\n\r\n\r\nHymen, in secret or overt guise, seemed to haunt Pierston just at this\r\ntime with undignified mockery which savoured rather of Harlequin than of\r\nthe torch-bearer. Two days after parting in a lone island from the girl\r\nhe had so disinterestedly loved he met in Piccadilly his friend Somers,\r\nwonderfully spruced up, and hastening along with a preoccupied face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Somers, \xe2\x80\x98what do you think! I was charged not to\r\ntell you, but, hang it! I may just as well make a clean breast of it now\r\nas later.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What--you are not going to...\xe2\x80\x99 began Pierston, with divination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. What I said on impulse six months back I am about to carry out\r\nin cold blood. Nichola and I began in jest and ended in earnest. We are\r\ngoing to take one another next month for good and all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THIRD -- A YOUNG MAN OF SIXTY\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,\r\n      That on the ashes of his youth doth lie\r\n      As the death-bed whereon it must expire,\r\n      Consumed with that which it was nourished by.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n                                    --W. SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. I. SHE RETURNS FOR THE NEW SEASON\r\n\r\nTwenty years had spread their films over the events which wound up with\r\nthe reunion of the second Avice and her husband; and the hoary peninsula\r\ncalled an island looked just the same as before; though many who had\r\nformerly projected their daily shadows upon its unrelieved summer\r\nwhiteness ceased now to disturb the colourless sunlight there.\r\n\r\nThe general change, nevertheless, was small. The silent ships came and\r\nwent from the wharf, the chisels clinked in the quarries; file after\r\nfile of whitey-brown horses, in strings of eight or ten, painfully\r\ndragged down the hill the square blocks of stone on the antediluvian\r\nwooden wheels just as usual. The lightship winked every night from the\r\nquicksands to the Beal Lantern, and the Beal Lantern glared through its\r\neye-glass on the ship. The canine gnawing audible on the Pebble-bank\r\nhad been repeated ever since at each tide, but the pebbles remained\r\nundevoured.\r\n\r\nMen drank, smoked, and spat in the inns with only a little more\r\nadulteration in their refreshments and a trifle less dialect in their\r\nspeech than of yore. But one figure had never been seen on the Channel\r\nrock in the interval, the form of Pierston the sculptor, whose first use\r\nof the chisel that rock had instigated.\r\n\r\nHe had lived abroad a great deal, and, in fact, at this very date he was\r\nstaying at an hotel in Rome. Though he had not once set eyes on Avice\r\nsince parting from her in the room with her firstborn, he had managed to\r\nobtain tidings of her from time to time during the interval. In this way\r\nPierston learnt that, shortly after their resumption of a common life in\r\nher house, Ike had ill-used her, till fortunately, the business to which\r\nJocelyn had assisted him chancing to prosper, he became immersed in\r\nits details, and allowed Avice to pursue her household courses without\r\ninterference, initiating that kind of domestic reconciliation which is\r\nso calm and durable, having as its chief ingredient neither hate nor\r\nlove, but an all-embracing indifference.\r\n\r\nAt first Pierston had sent her sums of money privately, fearing lest\r\nher husband should deny her material comforts; but he soon found, to his\r\ngreat relief, that such help was unnecessary, social ambition prompting\r\nIke to set up as quite a gentleman-islander, and to allow Avice a scope\r\nfor show which he would never have allowed in mere kindness.\r\n\r\nBeing in Rome, as aforesaid, Pierston returned one evening to his\r\nhotel to dine, after spending the afternoon among the busts in the long\r\ngallery of the Vatican. The unconscious habit, common to so many people,\r\nof tracing likes in unlikes had often led him to discern, or to fancy\r\nhe discerned, in the Roman atmosphere, in its lights and shades, and\r\nparticularly in its reflected or secondary lights, something resembling\r\nthe atmosphere of his native promontory. Perhaps it was that in each\r\ncase the eye was mostly resting on stone--that the quarries of ruins in\r\nthe Eternal City reminded him of the quarries of maiden rock at home.\r\n\r\nThis being in his mind when he sat down to dinner at the common table,\r\nhe was surprised to hear an American gentleman, who sat opposite,\r\nmention the name of Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s birthplace. The American was talking to\r\na friend about a lady--an English widow, whose acquaintance they had\r\nrenewed somewhere in the Channel Islands during a recent tour, after\r\nhaving known her as a young woman who came to San Francisco with her\r\nfather and mother many years before. Her father was then a rich man just\r\nretired from the business of a stone-merchant in the Isle of Slingers;\r\nbut he had engaged in large speculations, and had lost nearly all his\r\nfortune. Jocelyn further gathered that the widowed daughter\xe2\x80\x99s name was\r\nMrs. Leverre; that she had a step-son, her husband having been a Jersey\r\ngentleman, a widower; and that the step-son seemed to be a promising and\r\ninteresting young man.\r\n\r\nPierston was instantly struck with the perception that these and other\r\nallusions, though general, were in accord with the history of his\r\nlong-lost Marcia. He hardly felt any desire to hunt her up after nearly\r\ntwo score years of separation, but he was impressed enough to resolve to\r\nexchange a word with the strangers as soon as he could get opportunity.\r\n\r\nHe could not well attract their attention through the plants upon the\r\nwide table, and even if he had been able he was disinclined to ask\r\nquestions in public. He waited on till dinner was over, and when the\r\nstrangers withdrew Pierston withdrew in their rear.\r\n\r\nThey were not in the drawing-room, and he found that they had gone\r\nout. There was no chance of overtaking them, but Pierston, waked to\r\nrestlessness by their remarks, wandered up and down the adjoining Piazza\r\ndi Spagna, thinking they might return. The streets below were immersed\r\nin shade, the front of the church of the Trinita de\xe2\x80\x99 Monti at the\r\ntop was flooded with orange light, the gloom of evening gradually\r\nintensifying upon the broad, long flight of steps, which foot-passengers\r\nincessantly ascended and descended with the insignificance of ants; the\r\ndusk wrapped up the house to the left, in which Shelley had lived, and\r\nthat to the right, in which Keats had died.\r\n\r\nGetting back to the hotel he learnt that the Americans had only dropped\r\nin to dine, and were staying elsewhere. He saw no more of them; and on\r\nreflection he was not deeply concerned, for what earthly woman, going\r\noff in a freak as Marcia had done, and keeping silence so long, would\r\ncare for a belated friendship with him now in the sere, even if he were\r\nto take the trouble to discover her.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nThus much Marcia. The other thread of his connection with the ancient\r\nIsle of Slingers was stirred by a letter he received from Avice a little\r\nafter this date, in which she stated that her husband Ike had been\r\nkilled in his own quarry by an accident within the past year; that she\r\nherself had been ill, and though well again, and left amply provided\r\nfor, she would like to see him if he ever came that way.\r\n\r\nAs she had not communicated for several long years, her expressed wish\r\nto see him now was likely to be prompted by something more, something\r\nnewer, than memories of him. Yet the manner of her writing precluded all\r\nsuspicion that she was thinking of him as an old lover whose suit events\r\nhad now made practicable. He told her he was sorry to hear that she had\r\nbeen ill, and that he would certainly take an early opportunity of going\r\ndown to her home on his next visit to England.\r\n\r\nHe did more. Her request had revived thoughts of his old home and its\r\nassociations, and instead of awaiting other reasons for a return he made\r\nher the operating one. About a week later he stood once again at the\r\nfoot of the familiar steep whereon the houses at the entrance to the\r\nIsle were perched like grey pigeons on a roof-side.\r\n\r\nAt Top-o\xe2\x80\x99-Hill--as the summit of the rock was mostly called--he stood\r\nlooking at the busy doings in the quarries beyond, where the numerous\r\nblack hoisting-cranes scattered over the central plateau had the\r\nappearance of a swarm of crane-flies resting there. He went a little\r\nfurther, made some general inquiries about the accident which had\r\ncarried off Avice\xe2\x80\x99s husband in the previous year, and learnt that though\r\nnow a widow, she had plenty of friends and sympathizers about her,\r\nwhich rendered any immediate attention to her on his part unnecessary.\r\nConsidering, therefore, that there was no great reason why he should\r\ncall on her so soon, and without warning, he turned back. Perhaps after\r\nall her request had been dictated by a momentary feeling only, and a\r\nconsiderable strangeness to each other must naturally be the result of\r\na score of dividing years. Descending to the bottom he took his seat in\r\nthe train on the shore, which soon carried him along the Bank, and\r\nround to the watering-place five miles off, at which he had taken up his\r\nquarters for a few days.\r\n\r\nHere, as he stayed on, his local interests revived. Whenever he went out\r\nhe could see the island that was once his home lying like a great\r\nsnail upon the sea across the bay. It was the spring of the year; local\r\nsteamers had begun to run, and he was never tired of standing on the\r\nthinly occupied deck of one of these as it skirted the island and\r\nrevealed to him on the cliffs far up its height the ruins of Red-King\r\nCastle, behind which the little village of East Quarriers lay.\r\n\r\nThus matters went on, if they did not rather stand still, for several\r\ndays before Pierston redeemed his vague promise to seek Avice out. And\r\nin the meantime he was surprised by the arrival of another letter from\r\nher by a roundabout route. She had heard, she said, that he had been on\r\nthe island, and imagined him therefore to be staying somewhere near. Why\r\ndid he not call as he had told her he would do? She was always thinking\r\nof him, and wishing to see him.\r\n\r\nHer tone was anxious, and there was no doubt that she really had\r\nsomething to say which she did not want to write. He wondered what it\r\ncould be, and started the same afternoon.\r\n\r\nAvice, who had been little in his mind of late years, began to renew for\r\nherself a distinct position therein. He was fully aware that since his\r\nearlier manhood a change had come over his regard of womankind. Once the\r\nindividual had been nothing more to him than the temporary abiding-place\r\nof the typical or ideal; now his heart showed its bent to be a growing\r\nfidelity to the specimen, with all her pathetic flaws of detail; which\r\nflaws, so far from sending him further, increased his tenderness. This\r\nmaturer feeling, if finer and higher, was less convenient than the old.\r\nArdours of passion could be felt as in youth without the recuperative\r\nintervals which had accompanied evanescence.\r\n\r\nThe first sensation was to find that she had long ceased to live in\r\nthe little freehold cottage she had occupied of old. In answer to his\r\ninquiries he was directed along the road to the west of the modern\r\ncastle, past the entrance on that side, and onward to the very house\r\nthat had once been his own home. There it stood as of yore, facing\r\nup the Channel, a comfortable roomy structure, the euonymus and other\r\nshrubs, which alone would stand in the teeth of the salt wind, living\r\non at about the same stature in front of it; but the paint-work much\r\nrenewed. A thriving man had resided there of late, evidently.\r\n\r\nThe widow in mourning who received him in the front parlour was, alas!\r\nbut the sorry shadow of Avice the Second. How could he have fancied\r\notherwise after twenty years? Yet he had been led to fancy otherwise,\r\nalmost without knowing it, by feeling himself unaltered. Indeed,\r\ncuriously enough, nearly the first words she said to him were: \xe2\x80\x98Why--you\r\nare just the same!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just the same. Yes, I am, Avice,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered sadly; for this inability\r\nto ossify with the rest of his generation threw him out of proportion\r\nwith the time. Moreover, while wearing the aspect of comedy, it was of\r\nthe nature of tragedy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is well to be you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on. \xe2\x80\x98I have had troubles to take\r\nthe bloom off me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; I have been sorry for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe continued to regard him curiously, with humorous interest; and\r\nhe knew what was passing in her mind: that this man, to whom she had\r\nformerly looked up as to a person far in advance of her along the lane\r\nof life, seemed now to be a well-adjusted contemporary, the pair of them\r\nobserving the world with fairly level eyes.\r\n\r\nHe had come to her with warmth for a vision which, on reaching her,\r\nhe found to have departed; and, though fairly weaned by the natural\r\nreality, he was so far staunch as to linger hankeringly. They talked of\r\npast days, his old attachment, which she had then despised, being now\r\nfar more absorbing and present to her than to himself.\r\n\r\nShe unmistakably won upon him as he sat on. A curious closeness between\r\nthem had been produced in his imagination by the discovery that she\r\nwas passing her life within the house of his own childhood. Her similar\r\nsurname meant little here; but it was also his, and, added to the\r\nidentity of domicile, lent a strong suggestiveness to the accident.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is where I used to sit when my parents occupied the house,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said, placing himself beside that corner of the fireplace which\r\ncommanded a view through the window. \xe2\x80\x98I could see a bough of tamarisk\r\nwave outside at that time, and, beyond the bough, the same abrupt grassy\r\nwaste towards the sea, and at night the same old lightship blinking far\r\nout there. Place yourself on the spot, to please me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe set her chair where he indicated, and Pierston stood close beside\r\nher, directing her gaze to the familiar objects he had regarded thence\r\nas a boy. Her head and face--the latter thoughtful and worn enough, poor\r\nthing, to suggest a married life none too comfortable--were close to his\r\nbreast, and, with a few inches further incline, would have touched it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now you are the inhabitant; I the visitor,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98I am glad to\r\nsee you here--so glad, Avice! You are fairly well provided for--I think\r\nI may assume that?\xe2\x80\x99 He looked round the room at the solid mahogany\r\nfurniture, and at the modern piano and show bookcase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Ike left me comfortable. \xe2\x80\x98Twas he who thought of moving from my\r\ncottage to this larger house. He bought it, and I can live here as long\r\nas I choose to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nApart from the decline of his adoration to friendship, there seemed to\r\nbe a general convergence of positions which suggested that he might make\r\namends for the desertion of Avice the First by proposing to this Avice\r\nwhen a meet time should arrive. If he did not love her as he had done\r\nwhen she was a slim thing catching mice in his rooms in London, he could\r\nsurely be content at his age with comradeship. After all she was only\r\nforty to his sixty. The feeling that he really could be thus content\r\nwas so convincing that he almost believed the luxury of getting old and\r\nreposeful was coming to his restless, wandering heart at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, you have come at last, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on; \xe2\x80\x98and I am grateful to\r\nyou. I did not like writing, and yet I wanted to be straightforward.\r\nHave you guessed at all why I wished to see you so much that I could not\r\nhelp sending twice to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have tried, but cannot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Try again. It is a pretty reason, which I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t unriddle it. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this on my own account\r\nbefore you tell me. I have always taken a lingering interest in you,\r\nwhich you must value for what it is worth. It originated, so far as it\r\nconcerns you personally, with the sight of you in that cottage round the\r\ncorner, nineteen or twenty years ago, when I became tenant of the castle\r\nopposite. But that was not the very beginning. The very beginning was\r\na score of years before that, when I, a young fellow of one-and-twenty,\r\ncoming home here, from London, to see my father, encountered a tender\r\nwoman as like you as your double; was much attracted by her as I saw\r\nher day after day flit past this window; till I made it my business to\r\naccompany her in her walks awhile. I, as you know, was not a staunch\r\nfellow, and it all ended badly. But, at any rate you, her daughter, and\r\nI are friends.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! there she is!\xe2\x80\x99 suddenly exclaimed Avice, whose attention had\r\nwandered somewhat from his retrospective discourse. She was looking from\r\nthe window towards the cliffs, where, upon the open ground quite near at\r\nhand, a slender female form was seen rambling along. \xe2\x80\x98She is out for\r\na walk,\xe2\x80\x99 Avice continued. \xe2\x80\x98I wonder if she is going to call here this\r\nafternoon? She is living at the castle opposite as governess.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, she\xe2\x80\x99s--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Her education was very thorough--better even than her\r\ngrandmother\xe2\x80\x99s. I was the neglected one, and her father and myself both\r\nvowed that there should be no complaint on that score about her. We\r\nchristened her Avice, to keep up the name, as you requested. I wish you\r\ncould speak to her--I am sure you would like her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that the baby?\xe2\x80\x99 faltered Jocelyn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, the baby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe person signified, now much nearer, was a still more modernized,\r\nup-to-date edition of the two Avices of that blood with whom he had been\r\ninvolved more or less for the last forty years. A ladylike creature was\r\nshe--almost elegant. She was altogether finer in figure than her\r\nmother or grandmother had ever been, which made her more of a woman in\r\nappearance than in years. She wore a large-disked sun-hat, with a brim\r\nlike a wheel whose spokes were radiating folds of muslin lining the\r\nbrim, a black margin beyond the muslin being the felloe. Beneath this\r\nbrim her hair was massed low upon her brow, the colour of the thick\r\ntresses being probably, from her complexion, repeated in the irises of\r\nher large, deep eyes. Her rather nervous lips were thin and closed, so\r\nthat they only appeared as a delicate red line. A changeable temperament\r\nwas shown by that mouth--quick transitions from affection to aversion,\r\nfrom a pout to a smile.\r\n\r\nIt was Avice the Third.\r\n\r\nJocelyn and the second Avice continued to gaze ardently at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! she is not coming in now; she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t time,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured the mother,\r\nwith some disappointment. \xe2\x80\x98Perhaps she means to run across in the\r\nevening.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe tall girl, in fact, went past and on till she was out of sight.\r\nPierston stood as in a dream. It was the very she, in all essential\r\nparticulars, and with an intensification of general charm, who had\r\nkissed him forty years before. When he turned his head from the window\r\nhis eyes fell again upon the intermediate Avice at his side. Before but\r\nthe relic of the Well-Beloved, she had now become its empty shrine. Warm\r\nfriendship, indeed, he felt for her; but whatever that might have done\r\ntowards the instauration of a former dream was now hopelessly barred by\r\nthe rivalry of the thing itself in the guise of a lineal successor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. II. MISGIVINGS ON THE RE-EMBODIMENT\r\n\r\nPierston had been about to leave, but he sat down again on being asked\r\nif he would stay and have a cup of tea. He hardly knew for a moment what\r\nhe did; a dim thought that Avice--the renewed Avice--might come into the\r\nhouse made his reseating himself an act of spontaneity.\r\n\r\nHe forgot that twenty years earlier he had called the now Mrs. Pierston\r\nan elf, a witch; and that lapse of time had probably not diminished the\r\nsubtleties implied by those epithets. He did not know that she had noted\r\nevery impression that her daughter had made upon him.\r\n\r\nHow he contrived to attenuate and disperse the rather tender\r\npersonalities he had opened up with the new Avice\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Pierston\r\nnever exactly defined. Perhaps she saw more than he thought she\r\nsaw--read something in his face--knew that about his nature which he\r\ngave her no credit for knowing. Anyhow, the conversation took the form\r\nof a friendly gossip from that minute, his remarks being often given\r\nwhile his mind was turned elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut a chill passed through Jocelyn when there had been time for\r\nreflection. The renewed study of his art in Rome without any\r\ncounterbalancing practical pursuit had nourished and developed his\r\nnatural responsiveness to impressions; he now felt that his old trouble,\r\nhis doom--his curse, indeed, he had sometimes called it--was come\r\nback again. His divinity was not yet propitiated for that original sin\r\nagainst her image in the person of Avice the First, and now, at the age\r\nof one-and-sixty, he was urged on and on like the Jew Ahasuerus--or, in\r\nthe phrase of the islanders themselves, like a blind ram.\r\n\r\nThe Goddess, an abstraction to the general, was a fairly real personage\r\nto Pierston. He had watched the marble images of her which stood in his\r\nworking-room, under all changes of light and shade in the brightening\r\nof morning, in the blackening of eve, in moonlight, in lamplight. Every\r\nline and curve of her body none, naturally, knew better than he;\r\nand, though not a belief, it was, as has been stated, a formula, a\r\nsuperstition, that the three Avices were inter-penetrated with her\r\nessence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the next Avice--your daughter,\xe2\x80\x99 he said stumblingly; \xe2\x80\x98she is, you\r\nsay, a governess at the castle opposite?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Pierston reaffirmed the fact, adding that the girl often slept at\r\nhome because she, her mother, was so lonely. She often thought she would\r\nlike to keep her daughter at home altogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She plays that instrument, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 said Pierston, regarding the\r\npiano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, she plays beautifully; she had the best instruction that masters\r\ncould give her. She was educated at Sandbourne.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which room does she call hers when at home?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The little one over this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt had been his own. \xe2\x80\x98Strange,\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured.\r\n\r\nHe finished tea, and sat after tea, but the youthful Avice did not\r\narrive. With the Avice present he conversed as the old friend--no more.\r\nAt last it grew dusk, and Pierston could not find an excuse for staying\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope to make the acquaintance--of your daughter,\xe2\x80\x99 he said in leaving,\r\nknowing that he might have added with predestinate truth, \xe2\x80\x98of my new\r\ntenderly-beloved.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope you will,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered. \xe2\x80\x98This evening she evidently has gone\r\nfor a walk instead of coming here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And, by-the-bye, you have not told me what you especially wanted to see\r\nme for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, no. I will put it off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well. I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to guess.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must tell you another time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it is any little business in connection with your late husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffairs, do command me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything I can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you. And I shall see you again soon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly. Quite soon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone she looked reflectively at the spot where he had\r\nbeen standing, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Best hold my tongue. It will work of itself,\r\nwithout my telling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJocelyn went from the house, but as the white road passed under his\r\nfeet he felt in no mood to get back to his lodgings in the town on the\r\nmainland. He lingered about upon the rugged ground for a long while,\r\nthinking of the extraordinary reproduction of the original girl in this\r\nnew form he had seen, and of himself as of a foolish dreamer in being so\r\nsuddenly fascinated by the renewed image in a personality not one-third\r\nof his age. As a physical fact, no doubt, the preservation of the\r\nlikeness was no uncommon thing here, but it helped the dream.\r\n\r\nPassing round the walls of the new castle he deviated from his homeward\r\ntrack by turning down the familiar little lane which led to the ruined\r\ncastle of the Red King. It took him past the cottage in which the new\r\nAvice was born, from whose precincts he had heard her first infantine\r\ncry. Pausing he saw near the west behind him the new moon growing\r\ndistinct upon the glow.\r\n\r\nHe was subject to gigantic fantasies still. In spite of himself,\r\nthe sight of the new moon, as representing one who, by her so-called\r\ninconstancy, acted up to his own idea of a migratory Well-Beloved, made\r\nhim feel as if his wraith in a changed sex had suddenly looked over the\r\nhorizon at him. In a crowd secretly, or in solitude boldly, he had\r\noften bowed the knee three times to this sisterly divinity on her first\r\nappearance monthly, and directed a kiss towards her shining shape. The\r\ncurse of his qualities (if it were not a blessing) was far from having\r\nspent itself yet.\r\n\r\nIn the other direction the castle ruins rose square and dusky against\r\nthe sea. He went on towards these, around which he had played as a boy,\r\nand stood by the walls at the edge of the cliff pondering. There was no\r\nwind and but little tide, and he thought he could hear from years ago a\r\nvoice that he knew. It certainly was a voice, but it came from the rocks\r\nbeneath the castle ruin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Atway!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA silence followed, and nobody came. The voice spoke again; \xe2\x80\x98John\r\nStoney!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNeither was this summons attended to. The cry continued, with more\r\nentreaty: \xe2\x80\x98William Scribben!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe voice was that of a Pierston--there could be no doubt of it--young\r\nAvice\xe2\x80\x99s, surely? Something or other seemed to be detaining her down\r\nthere against her will. A sloping path beneath the beetling cliff and\r\nthe castle walls rising sheer from its summit, led down to the lower\r\nlevel whence the voice proceeded. Pierston followed the pathway, and\r\nsoon beheld a girl in light clothing--the same he had seen through\r\nthe window--standing upon one of the rocks, apparently unable to move.\r\nPierston hastened across to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, thank you for coming!\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured with some timidity. \xe2\x80\x98I have met\r\nwith an awkward mishap. I live near here, and am not frightened really.\r\nMy foot has become jammed in a crevice of the rock, and I cannot get it\r\nout, try how I will. What SHALL I do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJocelyn stooped and examined the cause of discomfiture. \xe2\x80\x98I think if you\r\ncan take your boot off,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98your foot might slip out, leaving the\r\nboot behind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe tried to act upon this advice, but could not do so effectually.\r\nPierston then experimented by slipping his hand into the crevice till he\r\ncould just reach the buttons of her boot, which, however, he could not\r\nunfasten any more than she. Taking his penknife from his pocket he tried\r\nagain, and cut off the buttons one by one. The boot unfastened, and out\r\nslipped the foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, how glad I am!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried joyfully. \xe2\x80\x98I was fearing I should have to\r\nstay here all night. How can I thank you enough?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was tugging to withdraw the boot, but no skill that he could exercise\r\nwould move it without tearing. At last she said: \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t try any longer.\r\nIt is not far to the house. I can walk in my stocking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll assist you in,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\nShe said she did not want help, nevertheless allowed him to help her on\r\nthe unshod side. As they moved on she explained that she had come out\r\nthrough the garden door; had been standing on the boulders to look at\r\nsomething out at sea just discernible in the evening light as assisted\r\nby the moon, and, in jumping down, had wedged her foot as he had found\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhatever Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s years might have made him look by day, in the dusk\r\nof evening he was fairly presentable as a pleasing man of no marked\r\nantiquity, his outline differing but little from what it had been when\r\nhe was half his years. He was well preserved, still upright, trimly\r\nshaven, agile in movement; wore a tightly buttoned suit which set off a\r\nnaturally slight figure; in brief, he might have been of any age as he\r\nappeared to her at this moment. She talked to him with the co-equality\r\nof one who assumed him to be not far ahead of her own generation; and,\r\nas the growing darkness obscured him more and more, he adopted her\r\nassumption of his age with increasing boldness of tone.\r\n\r\nThe flippant, harmless freedom of the watering-place Miss, which Avice\r\nhad plainly acquired during her sojourn at the Sandbourne school, helped\r\nPierston greatly in this role of jeune premier which he was not unready\r\nto play. Not a word did he say about being a native of the island;\r\nstill more carefully did he conceal the fact of his having courted her\r\ngrandmother, and engaged himself to marry that attractive lady.\r\n\r\nHe found that she had come out upon the rocks through the same little\r\nprivate door from the lawn of the modern castle which had frequently\r\nafforded him egress to the same spot in years long past. Pierston\r\naccompanied her across the grounds almost to the entrance of the\r\nmansion--the place being now far better kept and planted than when he\r\nhad rented it as a lonely tenant; almost, indeed, restored to the order\r\nand neatness which had characterized it when he was a boy.\r\n\r\nLike her granny she was too inexperienced to be reserved, and during\r\nthis little climb, leaning upon his arm, there was time for a great deal\r\nof confidence. When he had bidden her farewell, and she had entered,\r\nleaving him in the dark, a rush of sadness through Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s soul swept\r\ndown all the temporary pleasure he had found in the charming girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany. Had Mephistopheles sprung from the ground there and then with\r\nan offer to Jocelyn of restoration to youth on the usual terms of his\r\nfirm, the sculptor might have consented to sell a part of himself which\r\nhe felt less immediate need of than of a ruddy lip and cheek and an\r\nunploughed brow.\r\n\r\nBut what could only have been treated as a folly by outsiders was almost\r\na sorrow for him. Why was he born with such a temperament? And this\r\nconcatenated interest could hardly have arisen, even with Pierston, but\r\nfor a conflux of circumstances only possible here. The three Avices, the\r\nsecond something like the first, the third a glorification of the first,\r\nat all events externally, were the outcome of the immemorial island\r\ncustoms of intermarriage and of prenuptial union, under which conditions\r\nthe type of feature was almost uniform from parent to child through\r\ngenerations: so that, till quite latterly, to have seen one native man\r\nand woman was to have seen the whole population of that isolated rock,\r\nso nearly cut off from the mainland. His own predisposition and the\r\nsense of his early faithlessness did all the rest.\r\n\r\nHe turned gloomily away, and let himself out of the precincts. Before\r\nwalking along the couple of miles of road which would conduct him to the\r\nlittle station on the shore, he redescended to the rocks whereon he had\r\nfound her, and searched about for the fissure which had made a prisoner\r\nof this terribly belated edition of the Beloved. Kneeling down beside\r\nthe spot he inserted his hand, and ultimately, by much wriggling,\r\nwithdrew the pretty boot. He mused over it for a moment, put it in his\r\npocket, and followed the stony route to the Street of Wells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. III. THE RENEWED IMAGE BURNS ITSELF IN\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to hinder Pierston in calling upon the new Avice\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother as often as he should choose, beyond the five miles of\r\nintervening railway and additional mile or two of clambering over\r\nthe heights of the island. Two days later, therefore, he repeated his\r\njourney and knocked about tea-time at the widow\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\nAs he had feared, the daughter was not at home. He sat down beside the\r\nold sweetheart who, having eclipsed her mother in past days, had now\r\neclipsed herself in her child. Jocelyn produced the girl\xe2\x80\x99s boot from his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, \xe2\x80\x98tis YOU who helped Avice out of her predicament?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs.\r\nPierston, with surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my dear friend; and perhaps I shall ask you to help me out of mine\r\nbefore I have done. But never mind that now. What did she tell you about\r\nthe adventure?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Pierston was looking thoughtfully upon him. \xe2\x80\x98Well, \xe2\x80\x98tis rather\r\nstrange it should have been you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied. She seemed to be\r\na good deal interested. \xe2\x80\x98I thought it might have been a younger man--a\r\nmuch younger man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It might have been as far as feelings were concerned.... Now, Avice,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll to the point at once. Virtually I have known your daughter any\r\nnumber of years. When I talk to her I can anticipate every turn of her\r\nthought, every sentiment, every act, so long did I study those things in\r\nyour mother and in you. Therefore I do not require to learn her; she\r\nwas learnt by me in her previous existences. Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t be shocked: I am\r\nwilling to marry her--I should be overjoyed to do it, if there would\r\nbe nothing preposterous about it, or that would seem like a man making\r\nhimself too much of a fool, and so degrading her in consenting. I can\r\nmake her comparatively rich, as you know, and I would indulge her every\r\nwhim. There is the idea, bluntly put. It would set right something in my\r\nmind that has been wrong for forty years. After my death she would have\r\nplenty of freedom and plenty of means to enjoy it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Isaac Pierston seemed only a little surprised; certainly not\r\nshocked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you might be a bit taken with her!\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid with an arch simplicity which could hardly be called unaffected.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Knowing the set of your mind, from my little time with you years ago,\r\nnothing you could do in this way would astonish me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you don\xe2\x80\x99t think badly of me for it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all.... By-the-bye, did you ever guess why I asked you to\r\ncome?... But never mind it now: the matter is past.... Of course, it\r\nwould depend upon what Avice felt.... Perhaps she would rather marry a\r\nyounger man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And suppose a satisfactory younger man should not appear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Pierston showed in her face that she fully recognized the\r\ndifference between a rich bird in hand and a young bird in the bush. She\r\nlooked him curiously up and down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know you would make anybody a very nice husband,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98I know\r\nthat you would be nicer than many men half your age; and, though there\r\nis a great deal of difference between you and her, there have been more\r\nunequal marriages, that\xe2\x80\x99s true. Speaking as her mother, I can say that\r\nI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t object to you, sir, for her, provided she liked you. That is\r\nwhere the difficulty will lie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you would help me to get over that difficulty,\xe2\x80\x99 he said gently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Remember, I brought back a truant husband to you twenty years ago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, you did,\xe2\x80\x99 she assented; \xe2\x80\x98and, though I may say no great things as\r\nto happiness came of it, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always seen that your intentions towards\r\nme were none the less noble on that account. I would do for you what I\r\nwould do for no other man, and there is one reason in particular which\r\ninclines me to help you with Avice--that I should feel absolutely\r\ncertain I was helping her to a kind husband.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, that would remain to be seen. I would, at any rate, try to be\r\nworthy of your opinion. Come, Avice, for old times\xe2\x80\x99 sake, you must help\r\nme. You never felt anything but friendship in those days, you know, and\r\nthat makes it easy and proper for you to do me a good turn now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter a little more conversation his old friend promised that she really\r\nwould do everything that lay in her power. She did not say how simple\r\nshe thought him not to perceive that she had already, by writing to him,\r\nbeen doing everything that lay in her power; had created the feeling\r\nwhich prompted his entreaty. And to show her good faith in this promise\r\nshe asked him to wait till later in the evening, when Avice might\r\npossibly run across to see her.\r\n\r\nPierston, who fancied he had won the younger Avice\xe2\x80\x99s interest, at least,\r\nby the part he had played upon the rocks the week before, had a dread\r\nof encountering her in full light till he should have advanced a little\r\nfurther in her regard. He accordingly was perplexed at this proposal,\r\nand, seeing his hesitation, Mrs. Pierston suggested that they should\r\nwalk together in the direction whence Avice would come, if she came at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nHe welcomed the idea, and in a few minutes they started, strolling\r\nalong under the now strong moonlight, and when they reached the gates of\r\nSylvania Castle turning back again towards the house. After two or three\r\nsuch walks up and down the gate of the castle grounds clicked, and a\r\nform came forth which proved to be the expected one.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they met the girl recognized in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s companion the\r\ngentleman who had helped her on the shore; and she seemed really glad to\r\nfind that her chivalrous assistant was claimed by her parent as an old\r\nfriend. She remembered hearing at divers times about this worthy London\r\nman of talent and position, whose ancestry were people of her own isle,\r\nand possibly, from the name, of a common stock with her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you have actually lived in Sylvania Castle yourself, Mr. Pierston?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nasked Avice the daughter, with her innocent young voice. \xe2\x80\x98Was it long\r\nago?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it was some time ago,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the sculptor, with a sinking at his\r\nheart lest she should ask how long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It must have been when I was away--or when I was very little?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you were away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could have been here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, perhaps you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think she was hiding herself in the parsley-bed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Avice\xe2\x80\x99s mother\r\nblandly.\r\n\r\nThey talked in this general way till they reached Mrs. Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s house;\r\nbut Jocelyn resisted both the widow\xe2\x80\x99s invitation and the desire of\r\nhis own heart, and went away without entering. To risk, by visibly\r\nconfronting her, the advantage that he had already gained, or fancied\r\nhe had gained, with the re-incarnate Avice required more courage than he\r\ncould claim in his present mood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch evening promenades as these were frequent during the waxing of\r\nthat summer moon. On one occasion, as they were all good walkers, it was\r\narranged that they should meet halfway between the island and the town\r\nin which Pierston had lodgings. It was impossible that by this time the\r\npretty young governess should not have guessed the ultimate reason of\r\nthese rambles to be a matrimonial intention; but she inclined to the\r\nbelief that the widow rather than herself was the object of Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nregard; though why this educated and apparently wealthy man should be\r\nattracted by her mother--whose homeliness was apparent enough to the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s more modern training--she could not comprehend.\r\n\r\nThey met accordingly in the middle of the Pebble-bank, Pierston coming\r\nfrom the mainland, and the women from the peninsular rock. Crossing the\r\nwooden bridge which connected the bank with the shore proper they moved\r\nin the direction of Henry the Eighth\xe2\x80\x99s Castle, on the verge of the\r\nrag-stone cliff. Like the Red King\xe2\x80\x99s Castle on the island, the interior\r\nwas open to the sky, and when they entered and the full moon streamed\r\ndown upon them over the edge of the enclosing masonry, the whole present\r\nreality faded from Jocelyn\xe2\x80\x99s mind under the press of memories. Neither\r\nof his companions guessed what Pierston was thinking of. It was in this\r\nvery spot that he was to have met the grandmother of the girl at his\r\nside, and in which he would have met her had she chosen to keep the\r\nappointment, a meeting which might--nay, must--have changed the whole\r\ncurrent of his life.\r\n\r\nInstead of that, forty years had passed--forty years of severance from\r\nAvice, till a secondly renewed copy of his sweetheart had arisen to fill\r\nher place. But he, alas, was not renewed. And of all this the pretty\r\nyoung thing at his side knew nothing.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the younger woman\xe2\x80\x99s retreat to view the sea through\r\nan opening of the walls, Pierston appealed to her mother in a whisper:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you ever given her a hint of what my meaning is? No? Then I think\r\nyou might, if you really have no objection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Pierston, as the widow, was far from being so coldly disposed in\r\nher own person towards her friend as in the days when he wanted to marry\r\nher. Had she now been the object of his wishes he would not have needed\r\nto ask her twice. But like a good mother she stifled all this, and said\r\nshe would sound Avice there and then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Avice, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, advancing to where the girl mused in the\r\nwindow-gap, \xe2\x80\x98what do you think of Mr. Pierston paying his addresses to\r\nyou--coming courting, as _I_ call it in my old-fashioned way. Supposing\r\nhe were to, would you encourage him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To ME, mother?\xe2\x80\x99 said Avice, with an inquiring laugh. \xe2\x80\x98I thought--he\r\nmeant you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean me,\xe2\x80\x99 said her mother hastily. \xe2\x80\x98He is nothing more\r\nthan my friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any addresses,\xe2\x80\x99 said the daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a man in society, and would take you to an elegant house in\r\nLondon suited to your education, instead of leaving you to mope here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like that well enough,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Avice carelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then give him some encouragement.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t care enough about him to do any encouraging. It is his\r\nbusiness, I should think, to do all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe spoke in her lightest vein; but the result was that when Pierston,\r\nwho had discreetly withdrawn, returned to them, she walked docilely,\r\nthough perhaps gloomily, beside him, her mother dropping to the rear.\r\nThey came to a rugged descent, and Pierston took her hand to help her.\r\nShe allowed him to retain it when they arrived on level ground.\r\n\r\nAltogether it was not an unsuccessful evening for the man with the\r\nunanchored heart, though possibly initial success meant worse for him in\r\nthe long run than initial failure. There was nothing marvellous in the\r\nfact of her tractability thus far. In his modern dress and style, under\r\nthe rays of the moon, he looked a very presentable gentleman indeed,\r\nwhile his knowledge of art and his travelled manners were not without\r\ntheir attractions for a girl who with one hand touched the educated\r\nmiddle-class and with the other the rude and simple inhabitants of the\r\nisle. Her intensely modern sympathies were quickened by her peculiar\r\noutlook.\r\n\r\nPierston would have regarded his interest in her as overmuch selfish\r\nif there had not existed a redeeming quality in the substratum of\r\nold pathetic memory by which such love had been created--which still\r\npermeated it, rendering it the tenderest, most anxious, most protective\r\ninstinct he had ever known. It may have had in its composition too much\r\nof the boyish fervour that had characterized such affection when he was\r\ncherry-cheeked, and light in the foot as a girl; but, if it was all this\r\nfeeling of youth, it was more.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pierston, in fearing to be frank, lest she might seem to be angling\r\nfor his fortune, did not fully divine his cheerful readiness to offer\r\nit, if by so doing he could make amends for his infidelity to her family\r\nforty years back in the past. Time had not made him mercenary, and it\r\nhad quenched his ambitions; and though his wish to wed Avice was not\r\nentirely a wish to enrich her, the knowledge that she would be enriched\r\nbeyond anything that she could have anticipated was what allowed him to\r\nindulge his love.\r\n\r\nHe was not exactly old he said to himself the next morning as he beheld\r\nhis face in the glass. And he looked considerably younger than he was.\r\nBut there was history in his face--distinct chapters of it; his brow was\r\nnot that blank page it once had been. He knew the origin of that line in\r\nhis forehead; it had been traced in the course of a month or two by past\r\ntroubles. He remembered the coming of this pale wiry hair; it had been\r\nbrought by the illness in Rome, when he had wished each night that he\r\nmight never wake again. This wrinkled corner, that drawn bit of skin,\r\nthey had resulted from those months of despondency when all seemed going\r\nagainst his art, his strength, his happiness. \xe2\x80\x98You cannot live your life\r\nand keep it, Jocelyn,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. Time was against him and love, and time\r\nwould probably win.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I went away from the first Avice,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued with whimsical\r\nmisery, \xe2\x80\x98I had a presentiment that I should ache for it some day. And\r\nI am aching--have ached ever since this jade of an Ideal learnt the\r\nunconscionable trick of inhabiting one image only.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUpon the whole he was not without a bodement that it would be folly to\r\npress on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. IV. A DASH FOR THE LAST INCARNATION\r\n\r\nThis desultory courtship of a young girl which had been brought about by\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s contrivance was interrupted by the appearance of Somers and\r\nhis wife and family on the Budmouth Esplanade. Alfred Somers, once the\r\nyouthful, picturesque as his own paintings, was now a middle-aged family\r\nman with spectacles--spectacles worn, too, with the single object of\r\nseeing through them--and a row of daughters tailing off to infancy, who\r\nat present added appreciably to the income of the bathing-machine women\r\nestablished along the sands.\r\n\r\nMrs. Somers--once the intellectual, emancipated Mrs. Pine-Avon--had now\r\nretrograded to the petty and timid mental position of her mother and\r\ngrandmother, giving sharp, strict regard to the current literature and\r\nart that reached the innocent presence of her long perspective of girls,\r\nwith the view of hiding every skull and skeleton of life from their\r\ndear eyes. She was another illustration of the rule that succeeding\r\ngenerations of women are seldom marked by cumulative progress, their\r\nadvance as girls being lost in their recession as matrons; so that they\r\nmove up and down the stream of intellectual development like flotsam\r\nin a tidal estuary. And this perhaps not by reason of their faults as\r\nindividuals, but of their misfortune as child-rearers.\r\n\r\nThe landscape-painter, now an Academician like Pierston himself--rather\r\npopular than distinguished--had given up that peculiar and personal\r\ntaste in subjects which had marked him in times past, executing instead\r\nmany pleasing aspects of nature addressed to the furnishing householder\r\nthrough the middling critic, and really very good of their kind. In this\r\nway he received many large cheques from persons of wealth in England and\r\nAmerica, out of which he built himself a sumptuous studio and an awkward\r\nhouse around it, and paid for the education of the growing maidens.\r\n\r\nThe vision of Somers\xe2\x80\x99s humble position as jackal to this lion of a\r\nfamily and house and studio and social reputation--Somers, to whom\r\nstrange conceits and wild imaginings were departed joys never to\r\nreturn--led Pierston, as the painter\xe2\x80\x99s contemporary, to feel that\r\nhe ought to be one of the bygones likewise, and to put on an air of\r\nunromantic bufferism. He refrained from entering Avice\xe2\x80\x99s peninsula for\r\nthe whole fortnight of Somers\xe2\x80\x99s stay in the neighbouring town, although\r\nits grey poetical outline--\xe2\x80\x98throned along the sea\xe2\x80\x99--greeted his eyes\r\nevery morn and eve across the roadstead.\r\n\r\nWhen the painter and his family had gone back from their bathing\r\nholiday, he thought that he, too, would leave the neighbourhood. To do\r\nso, however, without wishing at least the elder Avice good-bye would be\r\nunfriendly, considering the extent of their acquaintance. One evening,\r\nknowing this time of day to suit her best, he took the few-minutes\xe2\x80\x99\r\njourney to the rock along the thin connecting string of junction, and\r\narrived at Mrs. Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s door just after dark.\r\n\r\nA light shone from an upper chamber. On asking for his widowed\r\nacquaintance he was informed that she was ill, seriously, though not\r\ndangerously. While learning that her daughter was with her, and further\r\nparticulars, and doubting if he should go in, a message was sent down to\r\nask him to enter. His voice had been heard, and Mrs. Pierston would like\r\nto see him.\r\n\r\nHe could not with any humanity refuse, but there flashed across his mind\r\nthe recollection that Avice the youngest had never yet really seen\r\nhim, had seen nothing more of him than an outline, which might have\r\nappertained as easily to a man thirty years his junior as to himself,\r\nand a countenance so renovated by faint moonlight as fairly to\r\ncorrespond. It was with misgiving, therefore, that the sculptor ascended\r\nthe staircase and entered the little upper sitting-room, now arranged as\r\na sick-chamber.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pierston reclined on a sofa, her face emaciated to a surprising\r\nthinness for the comparatively short interval since her attack. \xe2\x80\x98Come\r\nin, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, as soon as she saw him, holding out her hand. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet me frighten you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAvice was seated beside her, reading. The girl jumped up, hardly seeming\r\nto recognize him. \xe2\x80\x98O! it\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Pierston,\xe2\x80\x99 she said in a moment, adding\r\nquickly, with evident surprise and off her guard: \xe2\x80\x98I thought Mr.\r\nPierston was--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhat she had thought he was did not pass her lips, and it remained\r\na riddle for Jocelyn until a new departure in her manner towards him\r\nshowed that the words \xe2\x80\x98much younger\xe2\x80\x99 would have accurately ended the\r\nsentence. Had Pierston not now confronted her anew, he might have\r\nendured philosophically her changed opinion of him. But he was seeing\r\nher again, and a rooted feeling was revived.\r\n\r\nPierston now learnt for the first time that the widow had been visited\r\nby sudden attacks of this sort not infrequently of late years. They were\r\nsaid to be due to angina pectoris, the latter paroxysms having been the\r\nmost severe. She was at the present moment out of pain, though weak,\r\nexhausted, and nervous. She would not, however, converse about herself,\r\nbut took advantage of her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s absence from the room to broach the\r\nsubject most in her thoughts.\r\n\r\nNo compunctions had stirred her as they had her visitor on the\r\nexpediency of his suit in view of his years. Her fever of anxiety lest\r\nafter all he should not come to see Avice again had been not without\r\nan effect upon her health; and it made her more candid than she had\r\nintended to be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Troubles and sickness raise all sorts of fears, Mr. Pierston,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x98What I felt only a wish for, when you first named it, I have\r\nhoped for a good deal since; and I have been so anxious that--that it\r\nshould come to something! I am glad indeed that you are come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My wanting to marry Avice, you mean, dear Mrs. Pierston?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--that\xe2\x80\x99s it. I wonder if you are still in the same mind? You are?\r\nThen I wish something could be done--to make her agree to it--so as to\r\nget it settled. I dread otherwise what will become of her. She is not a\r\npractical girl as I was--she would hardly like now to settle down as an\r\nislander\xe2\x80\x99s wife; and to leave her living here alone would trouble me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing will happen to you yet, I hope, my dear old friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, it is a risky complaint; and the attacks, when they come, are\r\nso agonizing that to endure them I ought to get rid of all outside\r\nanxieties, folk say. Now--do you want her, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With all my soul! But she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she is so against you as you imagine. I fancy if it were\r\nput to her plainly, now I am in this state, it might be done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey lapsed into conversation on the early days of their acquaintance,\r\nuntil Mrs. Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s daughter re-entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Avice,\xe2\x80\x99 said her mother, when the girl had been with them a few\r\nminutes. \xe2\x80\x98About this matter that I have talked over with you so many\r\ntimes since my attack. Here is Mr. Pierston, and he wishes to be your\r\nhusband. He is much older than you; but, in spite of it, that you will\r\never get a better husband I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe. Now, will you take him,\r\nseeing the state I am in, and how naturally anxious I am to see you\r\nsettled before I die?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you won\xe2\x80\x99t die, mother! You are getting better!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just for the present only. Come, he is a good man and a clever man, and\r\na rich man. I want you, O so much, to be his wife! I can say no more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAvice looked appealingly at the sculptor, and then on the floor. \xe2\x80\x98Does\r\nhe really wish me to?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked almost inaudibly, turning as she spoke\r\nto Pierston. \xe2\x80\x98He has never quite said so to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear one, how can you doubt it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Jocelyn quickly. \xe2\x80\x98But I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npress you to marry me as a favour, against your feelings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought Mr. Pierston was younger!\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured to her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That counts for little, when you think how much there is on the other\r\nside. Think of our position, and of his--a sculptor, with a mansion, and\r\na studio full of busts and statues that I have dusted in my time, and\r\nof the beautiful studies you would be able to take up. Surely the life\r\nwould just suit you? Your expensive education is wasted down here!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAvice did not care to argue. She was outwardly gentle as her grandmother\r\nhad been, and it seemed just a question with her of whether she must or\r\nmust not. \xe2\x80\x98Very well--I feel I ought to agree to marry him, since you\r\ntell me to,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered quietly, after some thought. \xe2\x80\x98I see that it\r\nwould be a wise thing to do, and that you wish it, and that Mr. Pierston\r\nreally does--like me. So--so that--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston was not backward at this critical juncture, despite unpleasant\r\nsensations. But it was the historic ingredient in this genealogical\r\npassion--if its continuity through three generations may be so\r\ndescribed--which appealed to his perseverance at the expense of his\r\nwisdom. The mother was holding the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s hand; she took Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand laid Avice\xe2\x80\x99s in it.\r\n\r\nNo more was said in argument, and the thing was regarded as determined.\r\nAfterwards a noise was heard upon the window-panes, as of fine sand\r\nthrown; and, lifting the blind, Pierston saw that the distant lightship\r\nwinked with a bleared and indistinct eye. A drizzling rain had come\r\non with the dark, and it was striking the window in handfuls. He had\r\nintended to walk the two miles back to the station, but it meant a\r\ndrenching to do it now. He waited and had supper; and, finding the\r\nweather no better, accepted Mrs. Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to stay over the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThus it fell out that again he lodged in the house he had been\r\naccustomed to live in as a boy, before his father had made his fortune,\r\nand before his own name had been heard of outside the boundaries of the\r\nisle.\r\n\r\nHe slept but little, and in the first movement of the dawn sat up in\r\nbed. Why should he ever live in London or any other fashionable city\r\nif this plan of marriage could be carried out? Surely, with this young\r\nwife, the island would be the best place for him. It might be possible\r\nto rent Sylvania Castle as he had formerly done--better still to buy it.\r\nIf life could offer him anything worth having it would be a home with\r\nAvice there on his native cliffs to the end of his days.\r\n\r\nAs he sat thus thinking, and the daylight increased, he discerned, a\r\nshort distance before him, a movement of something ghostly. His position\r\nwas facing the window, and he found that by chance the looking-glass\r\nhad swung itself vertical, so that what he saw was his own shape. The\r\nrecognition startled him. The person he appeared was too grievously\r\nfar, chronologically, in advance of the person he felt himself to be.\r\nPierston did not care to regard the figure confronting him so mockingly.\r\nIts voice seemed to say \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s tragedy hanging on to this!\xe2\x80\x99 But the\r\nquestion of age being pertinent he could not give the spectre up, and\r\nultimately got out of bed under the weird fascination of the reflection.\r\nWhether he had overwalked himself lately, or what he had done, he knew\r\nnot; but never had he seemed so aged by a score of years as he was\r\nrepresented in the glass in that cold grey morning light. While his soul\r\nwas what it was, why should he have been encumbered with that withering\r\ncarcase, without the ability to shift it off for another, as his ideal\r\nBeloved had so frequently done?\r\n\r\nBy reason of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s illness Avice was now living in the house,\r\nand, on going downstairs, he found that they were to breakfast en\r\ntete-a-tete. She was not then in the room, but she entered in the course\r\nof a few minutes. Pierston had already heard that the widow felt better\r\nthis morning, and elated by the prospect of sitting with Avice at this\r\nmeal he went forward to her joyously. As soon as she saw him in the full\r\nstroke of day from the window she started; and he then remembered that\r\nit was their first meeting under the solar rays.\r\n\r\nShe was so overcome that she turned and left the room as if she had\r\nforgotten something; when she re-entered she was visibly pale. She\r\nrecovered herself, and apologized. She had been sitting up the night\r\nbefore the last, she said, and was not quite so well as usual.\r\n\r\nThere may have been some truth in this; but Pierston could not get over\r\nthat first scared look of hers. It was enough to give daytime stability\r\nto his night views of a possible tragedy lurking in this wedding\r\nproject. He determined that, at any cost to his heart, there should be\r\nno misapprehension about him from this moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Pierston,\xe2\x80\x99 he said as they sat down, \xe2\x80\x98since it is well you should\r\nknow all the truth before we go any further, that there may be no\r\nawkward discoveries afterwards, I am going to tell you something about\r\nmyself--if you are not too distressed to hear it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--let me hear it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was once the lover of your mother, and wanted to marry her, only she\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, or rather couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, marry me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O how strange!\xe2\x80\x99 said the girl, looking from him to the breakfast\r\nthings, and from the breakfast things to him. \xe2\x80\x98Mother has never told me\r\nthat. Yet of course, you might have been. I mean, you are old enough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe took the remark as a satire she had not intended. \xe2\x80\x98O yes--quite old\r\nenough,\xe2\x80\x99 he said grimly. \xe2\x80\x98Almost too old.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Too old for mother? How\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I belonged to your grandmother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No? How can that be?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was her lover likewise. I should have married her if I had gone\r\nstraight on instead of round the corner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been, Mr. Pierston! You are not old enough? Why,\r\nhow old are you?--you have never told me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very old.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My mother\xe2\x80\x99s, and my grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, looking at him no longer\r\nas at a possible husband, but as a strange fossilized relic in human\r\nform. Pierston saw it, but meaning to give up the game he did not care\r\nto spare himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your mother\xe2\x80\x99s and your grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s young man,\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And were you my great-grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s too?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked, with an\r\nexpectant interest in his case as a drama that overcame her personal\r\nconsiderations for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--not your great-grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s. Your imagination beats even my\r\nconfessions!... But I am VERY old, as you see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not know it!\xe2\x80\x99 said she in an appalled murmur. \xe2\x80\x98You do not look\r\nso; and I thought that what you looked you were.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you--you are very young,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued.\r\n\r\nA stillness followed, during which she sat in a troubled constraint,\r\nregarding him now and then with something in her open eyes and large\r\npupils that might have been sympathy or nervousness. Pierston ate scarce\r\nany breakfast, and rising abruptly from the table said he would take a\r\nwalk on the cliffs as the morning was fine.\r\n\r\nHe did so, proceeding along the north-east heights for nearly a mile. He\r\nhad virtually given Avice up, but not formally. His intention had been\r\nto go back to the house in half-an-hour and pay a morning visit to the\r\ninvalid; but by not returning the plans of the previous evening might be\r\nallowed to lapse silently, as mere pourparlers that had come to nothing\r\nin the face of Avice\xe2\x80\x99s want of love for him. Pierston accordingly\r\nwent straight along, and in the course of an hour was at his Budmouth\r\nlodgings.\r\n\r\nNothing occurred till the evening to inform him how his absence had been\r\ntaken. Then a note arrived from Mrs. Pierston; it was written in pencil,\r\nevidently as she lay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am alarmed,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98at your going so suddenly. Avice seems to\r\nthink she has offended you. She did not mean to do that, I am sure. It\r\nmakes me dreadfully anxious! Will you send a line? Surely you will not\r\ndesert us now--my heart is so set on my child\xe2\x80\x99s welfare!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Desert you I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jocelyn. \xe2\x80\x98It is too much like the original\r\ncase. But I must let her desert me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn his return, with no other object than that of wishing Mrs. Pierston\r\ngood-bye, he found her painfully agitated. She clasped his hand and\r\nwetted it with her tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O don\xe2\x80\x99t be offended with her!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried. \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s young. We are one\r\npeople--don\xe2\x80\x99t marry a kimberlin! It will break my heart if you forsake\r\nher now! Avice!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe girl came. \xe2\x80\x98My manner was hasty and thoughtless this morning,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x98Please pardon me. I wish to abide by my promise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer mother, still tearful, again joined their hands; and the engagement\r\nstood as before.\r\n\r\nPierston went back to Budmouth, but dimly seeing how curiously, through\r\nhis being a rich suitor, ideas of beneficence and reparation were\r\nretaining him in the course arranged by her mother, and urged by his own\r\ndesire in the face of his understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. V. ON THE VERGE OF POSSESSION\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of his marriage Pierston had taken a new red house of\r\nthe approved Kensington pattern, with a new studio at the back as large\r\nas a mediaeval barn. Hither, in collusion with the elder Avice--whose\r\nhealth had mended somewhat--he invited mother and daughter to spend\r\na week or two with him, thinking thereby to exercise on the latter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimagination an influence which was not practicable while he was a guest\r\nat their house; and by interesting his betrothed in the fitting and\r\nfurnishing of this residence to create in her an ambition to be its\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasant, reposeful time to be in town. There was nobody to\r\ninterrupt them in their proceedings, and, it being out of the season,\r\nthe largest tradesmen were as attentive to their wants as if those firms\r\nhad never before been honoured with a single customer whom they really\r\nliked. Pierston and his guests, almost equally inexperienced--for the\r\nsculptor had nearly forgotten what knowledge of householding he had\r\nacquired earlier in life--could consider and practise thoroughly a\r\nspecies of skeleton-drill in receiving visitors when the pair should\r\nannounce themselves as married and at home in the coming winter season.\r\n\r\nAvice was charming, even if a little cold. He congratulated himself yet\r\nagain that time should have reserved for him this final chance for one\r\nof the line. She was somewhat like her mother, whom he had loved in the\r\nflesh, but she had the soul of her grandmother, whom he had loved in the\r\nspirit--and, for that matter, loved now. Only one criticism had he to\r\npass upon his choice: though in outward semblance her grandam idealized,\r\nshe had not the first Avice\xe2\x80\x99s candour, but rather her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncloseness. He never knew exactly what she was thinking and feeling. Yet\r\nhe seemed to have such prescriptive rights in women of her blood that\r\nher occasional want of confidence did not deeply trouble him.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those ripe and mellow afternoons that sometimes colour\r\nLondon with their golden light at this time of the year, and produce\r\nthose marvellous sunset effects which, if they were not known to be made\r\nup of kitchen coal-smoke and animal exhalations, would be rapturously\r\napplauded. Behind the perpendicular, oblique, zigzagged, and curved zinc\r\n\xe2\x80\x98tall-boys,\xe2\x80\x99 that formed a grey pattern not unlike early Gothic numerals\r\nagainst the sky, the men and women on the tops of the omnibuses saw an\r\nirradiation of topaz hues, darkened here and there into richest russet.\r\n\r\nThere had been a sharp shower during the afternoon, and Pierston--who\r\nhad to take care of himself--had worn a pair of goloshes on his short\r\nwalk in the street. He noiselessly entered the studio, inside which\r\nsome gleams of the same mellow light had managed to creep, and where he\r\nguessed he should find his prospective wife and mother-in-law awaiting\r\nhim with tea. But only Avice was there, seated beside the teapot of\r\nbrown delf, which, as artists, they affected, her back being toward him.\r\nShe was holding her handkerchief to her eyes, and he saw that she was\r\nweeping silently.\r\n\r\nIn another moment he perceived that she was weeping over a book. By this\r\ntime she had heard him, and came forward. He made it appear that he\r\nhad not noticed her distress, and they discussed some arrangements of\r\nfurniture. When he had taken a cup of tea she went away, leaving the\r\nbook behind her.\r\n\r\nPierston took it up. The volume was an old school-book; Stievenard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lectures Francaises,\xe2\x80\x99 with her name in it as a pupil at Sandbourne\r\nHigh School, and date-markings denoting lessons taken at a comparatively\r\nrecent time, for Avice had been but a novice as governess when he\r\ndiscovered her.\r\n\r\nFor a school-girl--which she virtually was--to weep over a school-book\r\nwas strange. Could she have been affected by some subject in the\r\nreadings? Impossible. Pierston fell to thinking, and zest died for the\r\nprocess of furnishing, which he had undertaken so gaily. Somehow, the\r\nbloom was again disappearing from his approaching marriage. Yet he\r\nloved Avice more and more tenderly; he feared sometimes that in the\r\nsolicitousness of his affection he was spoiling her by indulging her\r\nevery whim.\r\n\r\nHe looked round the large and ambitious apartment, now becoming clouded\r\nwith shades, out of which the white and cadaverous countenances of his\r\nstudies, casts, and other lumber peered meditatively at him, as if they\r\nwere saying, \xe2\x80\x98What are you going to do now, old boy?\xe2\x80\x99 They had never\r\nlooked like that while standing in his past homely workshop, where all\r\nthe real labours of his life had been carried out. What should a man of\r\nhis age, who had not for years done anything to speak of--certainly not\r\nto add to his reputation as an artist--want with a new place like this?\r\nIt was all because of the elect lady, and she apparently did not want\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nPierston did not observe anything further in Avice to cause him\r\nmisgiving till one dinner-time, a week later, towards the end of the\r\nvisit. Then, as he sat himself between her and her mother at their\r\nlimited table, he was struck with her nervousness, and was tempted to\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x98Why are you troubled, my little dearest?\xe2\x80\x99 in tones which disclosed\r\nthat he was as troubled as she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Am I troubled?\xe2\x80\x99 she said with a start, turning her gentle hazel\r\neyes upon him. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I suppose I am. It is because I have received a\r\nletter--from an old friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You didn\xe2\x80\x99t show it to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--I tore it up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was not necessary to keep it, so I destroyed it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Pierston did not press her further on the subject, and Avice showed\r\nno disposition to continue it. They retired rather early, as they always\r\ndid, but Pierston remained pacing about his studio a long while, musing\r\non many things, not the least being the perception that to wed a woman\r\nmay be by no means the same thing as to be united with her. The \xe2\x80\x98old\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99 of Avice\xe2\x80\x99s remark had sounded very much like \xe2\x80\x98lover.\xe2\x80\x99 Otherwise\r\nwhy should the letter have so greatly disturbed her?\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be something uncanny, after all, about London, in its\r\nrelation to his contemplated marriage. When she had first come up she\r\nwas easier with him than now. And yet his bringing her there had helped\r\nhis cause; the house had decidedly impressed her--almost overawed her,\r\nand though he owned that by no law of nature or reason had her mother\r\nor himself any right to urge on Avice partnership with him against\r\nher inclination, he resolved to make the most of having her under his\r\ninfluence by getting the wedding details settled before she and her\r\nmother left.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he proceeded to do this. When he encountered Avice\r\nthere was a trace of apprehension on her face; but he set that down to\r\na fear that she had offended him the night before by her taciturnity.\r\nDirectly he requested her mother, in Avice\xe2\x80\x99s presence, to get her to\r\nfix the day quite early, Mrs. Pierston became brighter and brisker. She,\r\ntoo, plainly had doubts about the wisdom of delay, and turning to her\r\ndaughter said, \xe2\x80\x98Now, my dear, do you hear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was ultimately agreed that the widow and her daughter should go\r\nback in a day or two, to await Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s arrival on the wedding-eve,\r\nimmediately after their return.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the arrangement Pierston found himself on the south\r\nshore of England in the gloom of the aforesaid evening, the isle, as\r\nhe looked across at it with his approach, being just discernible as a\r\nmoping countenance, a creature sullen with a sense that he was about to\r\nwithdraw from its keeping the rarest object it had ever owned. He had\r\ncome alone, not to embarrass them, and had intended to halt a couple of\r\nhours in the neighbouring seaport to give some orders relating to the\r\nwedding, but the little railway train being in waiting to take him on,\r\nhe proceeded with a natural impatience, resolving to do his business\r\nhere by messenger from the isle.\r\n\r\nHe passed the ruins of the Tudor castle and the long featureless rib of\r\ngrinding pebbles that screened off the outer sea, which could be heard\r\nlifting and dipping rhythmically in the wide vagueness of the Bay.\r\nAt the under-hill island townlet of the Wells there were no flys, and\r\nleaving his things to be brought on, as he often did, he climbed the\r\neminence on foot.\r\n\r\nHalf-way up the steepest part of the pass he saw in the dusk a figure\r\npausing--the single person on the incline. Though it was too dark to\r\nidentify faces, Pierston gathered from the way in which the halting\r\nstranger was supporting himself by the handrail, which here bordered the\r\nroad to assist climbers, that the person was exhausted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anything the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no--not much,\xe2\x80\x99 was returned by the other. \xe2\x80\x98But it is steep just\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe accent was not quite that of an Englishman, and struck him as\r\nhailing from one of the Channel Islands. \xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t I help you up to the\r\ntop?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, for the voice, though that of a young man, seemed faint\r\nand shaken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, thank you. I have been ill; but I thought I was all right again;\r\nand as the night was fine I walked into the island by the road. It\r\nturned out to be rather too much for me, as there is some weakness left\r\nstill; and this stiff incline brought it out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Naturally. You\xe2\x80\x99d better take hold of my arm--at any rate to the brow\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus pressed the stranger did so, and they went on towards the ridge,\r\ntill, reaching the lime-kiln standing there the stranger abandoned his\r\nhold, saying: \xe2\x80\x98Thank you for your assistance, sir. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I recognize your voice as a native\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, it is not. I am a Jersey man. Goodnight, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-night, if you are sure you can get on. Here, take this stick--it\r\nis no use to me.\xe2\x80\x99 Saying which, Pierston put his walking-stick into the\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you again. I shall be quite recovered when I have rested a minute\r\nor two. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me detain you, please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe stranger as he spoke turned his face towards the south, where the\r\nBeal light had just come into view, and stood regarding it with an\r\nobstinate fixity. As he evidently wished to be left to himself Jocelyn\r\nwent on, and troubled no more about him, though the desire of the young\r\nman to be rid of his company, after accepting his walking-stick and\r\nhis arm, had come with a suddenness that was almost emotional; and\r\nimpressionable as Jocelyn was, no less now than in youth, he was\r\nsaddened for a minute by the sense that there were people in the world\r\nwho did not like even his sympathy.\r\n\r\nHowever, a pleasure which obliterated all this arose when Pierston drew\r\nnear to the house that was likely to be his dear home on all future\r\nvisits to the isle, perhaps even his permanent home as he grew older and\r\nthe associations of his youth re-asserted themselves. It had been, too,\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s house, the house in which he was born, and he amused his\r\nfancy with plans for its enlargement under the supervision of Avice and\r\nhimself. It was a still greater pleasure to behold a tall and shapely\r\nfigure standing against the light of the open door and presumably\r\nawaiting him.\r\n\r\nAvice, who it was, gave a little jump when she recognized him, but\r\ndutifully allowed him to kiss her when he reached her side; though her\r\nnervousness was only too apparent, and was like a child\xe2\x80\x99s towards a\r\nparent who may prove stern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How dear of you to guess that I might come on at once instead of\r\nlater!\xe2\x80\x99 said Jocelyn. \xe2\x80\x98Well, if I had stayed in the town to go to the\r\nshops and so on, I could not have got here till the last train. How is\r\nmother?--our mother, as I shall call her soon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAvice said that her mother had not been so well--she feared not nearly\r\nso well since her return from London, so that she was obliged to keep\r\nher room. The visit had perhaps been too much for her. \xe2\x80\x98But she will\r\nnot acknowledge that she is much weaker, because she will not disturb my\r\nhappiness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJocelyn was in a mood to let trifles of manner pass, and he took no\r\nnotice of the effort which had accompanied the last word. They went\r\nupstairs to Mrs. Pierston, whose obvious relief and thankfulness at\r\nsight of him was grateful to her visitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am so, O so glad you are come!\xe2\x80\x99 she said huskily, as she held out her\r\nthin hand and stifled a sob. \xe2\x80\x98I have been so--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe could get no further for a moment, and Avice turned away weeping,\r\nand abruptly left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have so set my heart on this,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Pierston went on, \xe2\x80\x98that I have\r\nnot been able to sleep of late, for I have feared I might drop off\r\nsuddenly before she is yours, and lose the comfort of seeing you\r\nactually united. Your being so kind to me in old times has made me so\r\nsure that she will find a good husband in you, that I am over anxious, I\r\nknow. Indeed, I have not liked to let her know quite how anxious I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus they talked till Jocelyn bade her goodnight, it being noticeable\r\nthat Mrs. Pierston, chastened by her illnesses, maintained no longer\r\nany reserve on her gladness to acquire him as her son-in-law; and\r\nher feelings destroyed any remaining scruples he might have had from\r\nperceiving that Avice\xe2\x80\x99s consent was rather an obedience than a desire.\r\nAs he went downstairs, and found Avice awaiting his descent, he wondered\r\nif anything had occurred here during his absence to give Mrs. Pierston\r\nnew uneasiness about the marriage, but it was an inquiry he could\r\nnot address to a girl whose actions could alone be the cause of such\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\nHe looked round for her as he supped, but though she had come into the\r\nroom with him she was not there now. He remembered her telling him that\r\nshe had had supper with her mother, and Jocelyn sat on quietly musing\r\nand sipping his wine for something near half-an-hour. Wondering then\r\nfor the first time what had become of her, he rose and went to the door.\r\nAvice was quite near him after all--only standing at the front door\r\nas she had been doing when he came, looking into the light of the full\r\nmoon, which had risen since his arrival. His sudden opening of the\r\ndining-room door seemed to agitate her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it, dear?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As mother is much better and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want me, I ought to go and see\r\nsomebody I promised to take a parcel to--I feel I ought. And yet, as you\r\nhave just come to see me--I suppose you don\xe2\x80\x99t approve of my going out\r\nwhile you are here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is the person?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Somebody down that way,\xe2\x80\x99 she said indefinitely. \xe2\x80\x98It is not very far\r\noff. I am not afraid--I go out often by myself at night hereabout.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe reassured her good-humouredly. \xe2\x80\x98If you really wish to go, my dear, of\r\ncourse I don\xe2\x80\x99t object. I have no authority to do that till tomorrow, and\r\nyou know that if I had it I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O but you have! Mother being an invalid, you are in her place, apart\r\nfrom--to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense, darling. Run across to your friend\xe2\x80\x99s house by all means if\r\nyou want to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you\xe2\x80\x99ll be here when I come in?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I am going down to the inn to see if my things are brought up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But hasn\xe2\x80\x99t mother asked you to stay here? The spare room was got ready\r\nfor you.... Dear me, I am afraid I ought to have told you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She did ask me. But I have some things coming, directed to the inn,\r\nand I had better be there. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll wish you good-night, though it is not\r\nlate. I will come in quite early to-morrow, to inquire how your mother\r\nis going on, and to wish you good-morning. You will be back again\r\nquickly this evening?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I needn\xe2\x80\x99t go with you for company?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no, thank you. It is no distance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston then departed, thinking how entirely her manner was that of one\r\nto whom a question of doing anything was a question of permission and\r\nnot of judgment. He had no sooner gone than Avice took a parcel from\r\na cupboard, put on her hat and cloak, and following by the way he had\r\ntaken till she reached the entrance to Sylvania Castle, there stood\r\nstill. She could hear Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps passing down East Quarriers\r\nto the inn; but she went no further in that direction. Turning into the\r\nlane on the right, of which mention has so often been made, she went\r\nquickly past the last cottage, and having entered the gorge beyond\r\nshe clambered into the ruin of the Red King\xe2\x80\x99s or Bow-and-Arrow Castle,\r\nstanding as a square black mass against the moonlit, indefinite sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. VI. THE WELL-BELOVED IS--WHERE?\r\n\r\nMrs. Pierston passed a restless night, but this she let nobody know;\r\nnor, what was painfully evident to herself, that her prostration was\r\nincreased by anxiety and suspense about the wedding on which she had too\r\nmuch set her heart.\r\n\r\nDuring the very brief space in which she dozed Avice came into her room.\r\nAs it was not infrequent for her daughter to look in upon her thus she\r\ntook little notice, merely saying to assure the girl: \xe2\x80\x98I am better,\r\ndear. Don\xe2\x80\x99t come in again. Get to sleep yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe mother, however, went thinking anew. She had no apprehensions about\r\nthis marriage. She felt perfectly sure that it was the best thing she\r\ncould do for her girl. Not a young woman on the island but was envying\r\nAvice at that moment; for Jocelyn was absurdly young for three score,\r\na good-looking man, one whose history was generally known here; as also\r\nwere the exact figures of the fortune he had inherited from his father,\r\nand the social standing he could claim--a standing, however, which that\r\nfortune would not have been large enough to procure unassisted by his\r\nreputation in his art.\r\n\r\nBut Avice had been weak enough, as her mother knew, to indulge in\r\nfancies for local youths from time to time, and Mrs. Pierston could not\r\nhelp congratulating herself that her daughter had been so docile in the\r\ncircumstances. Yet to every one except, perhaps, Avice herself, Jocelyn\r\nwas the most romantic of lovers. Indeed was there ever such a romance\r\nas that man embodied in his relations to her house? Rejecting the first\r\nAvice, the second had rejected him, and to rally to the third with final\r\nachievement was an artistic and tender finish to which it was ungrateful\r\nin anybody to be blind.\r\n\r\nThe widow thought that the second Avice might probably not have rejected\r\nPierston on that occasion in the London studio so many years ago if\r\ndestiny had not arranged that she should have been secretly united to\r\nanother when the proposing moment came.\r\n\r\nBut what had come was best. \xe2\x80\x98My God,\xe2\x80\x99 she said at times that night, \xe2\x80\x98to\r\nthink my aim in writing to him should be fulfilling itself like this!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen all was right and done, what a success upon the whole her life\r\nwould have been. She who had begun her career as a cottage-girl, a\r\nsmall quarry-owner\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, had sunk so low as to the position\r\nof laundress, had engaged in various menial occupations, had made an\r\nunhappy marriage for love which had, however, in the long run, thanks to\r\nJocelyn\xe2\x80\x99s management, much improved her position, was at last to see\r\nher daughter secure what she herself had just missed securing, and\r\nestablished in a home of affluence and refinement.\r\n\r\nThus the sick woman excited herself as the hours went on. At last, in\r\nher tenseness it seemed to her that the time had already come at which\r\nthe household was stirring, and she fancied she heard conversation in\r\nher daughter\xe2\x80\x99s room. But she found that it was only five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and\r\nnot yet daylight. Her state was such that she could see the hangings of\r\nthe bed tremble with her tremors. She had declared overnight that she\r\ndid not require any one to sit up with her, but she now rang a little\r\nhandbell, and in a few minutes a nurse appeared; Ruth Stockwool, an\r\nisland woman and neighbour, whom Mrs. Pierston knew well, and who knew\r\nall Mrs. Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s history.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am so nervous that I can\xe2\x80\x99t stay by myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said the widow. \xe2\x80\x98And I\r\nthought I heard Becky dressing Miss Avice in her wedding things.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no--not yet, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. There\xe2\x80\x99s nobody up. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you something.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Pierston had taken a little nourishment she went on: \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp frightening myself with thoughts that she won\xe2\x80\x99t marry him. You see\r\nhe is older than Avice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, he is,\xe2\x80\x99 said her neighbour. \xe2\x80\x98But I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how anything can\r\nhender the wedden now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Avice, you know, had fancies; at least one fancy for another man; a\r\nyoung fellow of five-and-twenty. And she\xe2\x80\x99s been very secret and odd\r\nabout it. I wish she had raved and cried and had it out; but she\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nquite the other way. I know she\xe2\x80\x99s fond of him still.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What--that young Frenchman, Mr. Leverre o\xe2\x80\x99 Sandbourne? I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a\r\nlittle of it. But I should say there wadden much between \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there was. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve a sort of conviction that she saw him\r\nlast night. I believe it was only to bid him good-bye, and return him\r\nsome books he had given her; but I wish she had never known him; he is\r\nrather an excitable, impulsive young man, and he might make mischief.\r\nHe isn\xe2\x80\x99t a Frenchman, though he has lived in France. His father was a\r\nJersey gentleman, and on his becoming a widower he married as his second\r\nwife a native of this very island. That\xe2\x80\x99s mainly why the young man is so\r\nat home in these parts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--now I follow \xe2\x80\x98ee. She was a Bencomb, his stepmother: I heard\r\nsomething about her years ago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; her father had the biggest stone-trade on the island at one time;\r\nbut the name is forgotten here now. He retired years before I was born.\r\nHowever, mother used to tell me that she was a handsome young woman,\r\nwho tried to catch Mr. Pierston when he was a young man, and scandalized\r\nherself a bit with him. She went off abroad with her father, who had\r\nmade a fortune here; but when he got over there he lost it nearly all in\r\nsome way. Years after she married this Jerseyman, Mr. Leverre, who had\r\nbeen fond of her as a girl, and she brought up his child as her own.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Pierston paused, but as Ruth did not ask any question she presently\r\nresumed her self-relieving murmur:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How Miss Avice got to know the young man was in this way. When Mrs.\r\nLeverre\xe2\x80\x99s husband died she came from Jersey to live at Sandbourne;\r\nand made it her business one day to cross over to this place to make\r\ninquiries about Mr. Jocelyn Pierston. As my name was Pierston she called\r\nupon me with her son, and so Avice and he got acquainted. When Avice\r\nwent back to Sandbourne to the finishing school they kept up the\r\nacquaintance in secret. He taught French somewhere there, and does\r\nstill, I believe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I hope she\xe2\x80\x99ll forget en. He idden good enough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope so--I hope so.... Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get a little nap.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRuth Stockwool went back to her room, where, finding it would not be\r\nnecessary to get up for another hour, she lay down again and soon slept.\r\nHer bed was close to the staircase, from which it was divided by a lath\r\npartition only, and her consciousness either was or seemed to be aroused\r\nby light brushing touches on the outside of the partition, as of fingers\r\nfeeling the way downstairs in the dark. The slight noise passed, and in\r\na few seconds she dreamt or fancied she could hear the unfastening of\r\nthe back door.\r\n\r\nShe had nearly sunk into another sound sleep when precisely the same\r\nphenomena were repeated; fingers brushing along the wall close to her\r\nhead, down, downward, the soft opening of the door, its close, and\r\nsilence again.\r\n\r\nShe now became clearly awake. The repetition of the process had made the\r\nwhole matter a singular one. Early as it was the first sounds might have\r\nbeen those of the housemaid descending, though why she should have come\r\ndown so stealthily and in the dark did not make itself clear. But the\r\nsecond performance was inexplicable. Ruth got out of bed and lifted her\r\nblind. The dawn was hardly yet pink, and the light from the sandbank\r\nwas not yet extinguished. But the bushes of euonymus against the white\r\npalings of the front garden could be seen, also the light surface of\r\nthe road winding away like a riband to the north entrance of Sylvania\r\nCastle, thence round to the village, the cliffs, and the Cove behind.\r\nUpon the road two dark figures could just be discerned, one a little\r\nway behind the other, but overtaking and joining the foremost as Ruth\r\nlooked. After all they might be quarriers or lighthouse-keepers from the\r\nsouth of the island, or fishermen just landed from a night\xe2\x80\x99s work. There\r\nbeing nothing to connect them with the noises she had heard indoors she\r\ndismissed the whole subject, and went to bed again.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nJocelyn had promised to pay an early visit to ascertain the state of\r\nMrs. Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s health after her night\xe2\x80\x99s rest, her precarious condition\r\nbeing more obvious to him than to Avice, and making him a little\r\nanxious. Subsequent events caused him to remember that while he was\r\ndressing he casually observed two or three boatmen standing near the\r\ncliff beyond the village, and apparently watching with deep interest\r\nwhat seemed to be a boat far away towards the opposite shore of South\r\nWessex. At half-past eight he came from the door of the inn and went\r\nstraight to Mrs. Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s. On approaching he discovered that a strange\r\nexpression which seemed to hang about the house-front that morning was\r\nmore than a fancy, the gate, door, and two windows being open, though\r\nthe blinds of other windows were not drawn up, the whole lending a\r\nvacant, dazed look to the domicile, as of a person gaping in sudden\r\nstultification. Nobody answered his knock, and walking into the\r\ndining-room he found that no breakfast had been laid. His flashing\r\nthought was, \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Pierston is dead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile standing in the room somebody came downstairs, and Jocelyn\r\nencountered Ruth Stockwool, an open letter fluttering in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Mr. Pierston, Mr. Pierston! The Lord-a-Lord!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What? Mrs. Pierston--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no! Miss Avice! She is gone!--yes--gone! Read ye this, sir. It was\r\nleft in her bedroom, and we be fairly gallied out of our senses!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe took the letter and confusedly beheld that it was in two\r\nhandwritings, the first section being in Avice\xe2\x80\x99s:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAR MOTHER,--How ever will you forgive me for what I have done!\r\nSo deceitful as it seems. And yet till this night I had no idea of\r\ndeceiving either you or Mr. Pierston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Last night at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock I went out, as you may have guessed, to see\r\nMr. Leverre for the last time, and to give him back his books, letters,\r\nand little presents to me. I went only a few steps--to Bow-and-Arrow\r\nCastle, where we met as we had agreed to do, since he could not call.\r\nWhen I reached the place I found him there waiting, but quite ill.\r\nHe had been unwell at his mother\xe2\x80\x99s house for some days, and had been\r\nobliged to stay in bed, but he had got up on purpose to come and bid\r\nme good-bye. The over-exertion of the journey upset him, and though we\r\nstayed and stayed till twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock he felt quite unable to go back\r\nhome--unable, indeed, to move more than a few yards. I had tried so\r\nhard not to love him any longer, but I loved him so now that I could\r\nnot desert him and leave him out there to catch his death. So I helped\r\nhim--nearly carrying him--on and on to our door, and then round to the\r\nback. Here he got a little better, and as he could not stay there, and\r\neverybody was now asleep, I helped him upstairs into the room we had\r\nprepared for Mr. Pierston if he should have wanted one. I got him into\r\nbed, and then fetched some brandy and a little of your tonic. Did you\r\nsee me come into your room for it, or were you asleep?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I sat by him all night. He improved slowly, and we talked over what\r\nwe had better do. I felt that, though I had intended to give him up, I\r\ncould not now becomingly marry any other man, and that I ought to marry\r\nhim. We decided to do it at once, before anybody could hinder us. So we\r\ncame down before it was light, and have gone away to get the ceremony\r\nsolemnized.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell Mr. Pierston it was not premeditated, but the result of an\r\naccident. I am sincerely sorry to have treated him with what he will\r\nthink unfairness, but though I did not love him I meant to obey you and\r\nmarry him. But God sent this necessity of my having to give shelter to\r\nmy Love, to prevent, I think, my doing what I am now convinced would\r\nhave been wrong--Ever your loving daughter, AVICE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe second was in a man\xe2\x80\x99s hand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98DEAR MOTHER (as you will soon be to me),--Avice has clearly explained\r\nabove how it happened that I have not been able to give her up to\r\nMr. Pierston. I think I should have died if I had not accepted the\r\nhospitality of a room in your house this night, and your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntender nursing through the dark dreary hours. We love each other beyond\r\nexpression, and it is obvious that, if we are human, we cannot resist\r\nmarrying now, in spite of friends\xe2\x80\x99 wishes. Will you please send the\r\nnote lying beside this to my mother. It is merely to explain what I have\r\ndone--Yours with warmest regard, HENRI LEVERRE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJocelyn turned away and looked out of the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Pierston thought she heard some talking in the night, but of\r\ncourse she put it down to fancy. And she remembers Miss Avice coming\r\ninto her room at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, and going to the table\r\nwhere the medicine was standing. A sly girl--all the time her young\r\nman within a yard or two, in the very room, and a using the very clean\r\nsheets that you, sir, were to have used! They are our best linen ones,\r\ngot up beautiful, and a kept wi\xe2\x80\x99 rosemary. Really, sir, one would say\r\nyou stayed out o\xe2\x80\x99 your chammer o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose to oblige the young man with a\r\nbed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t blame them, don\xe2\x80\x99t blame them!\xe2\x80\x99 said Jocelyn in an even and\r\ncharacterless voice. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t blame her, particularly. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the\r\ncircumstances. I did.... It was how I served her grandmother. ... Well,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s gone! You needn\xe2\x80\x99t make a mystery of it. Tell it to all the island:\r\nsay that a man came to marry a wife, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t find her at home. Tell\r\neverybody that she\xe2\x80\x99s run away. It must be known sooner or later.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOne of the servants said, after waiting a few moments: \xe2\x80\x98We shan\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nthat, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh--Why won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We liked her too well, with all her faults.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--did you,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; and he sighed. He perceived that the younger\r\nmaids were secretly on Avice\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How does her mother bear it?\xe2\x80\x99 Jocelyn asked. \xe2\x80\x98Is she awake?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Pierston had hardly slept, and, having learnt the tidings\r\ninadvertently, became so distracted and incoherent as to be like a\r\nperson in a delirium; till, a few moments before he arrived, all her\r\nexcitement ceased, and she lay in a weak, quiet silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me go up,\xe2\x80\x99 Pierston said. \xe2\x80\x98And send for the doctor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPassing Avice\xe2\x80\x99s chamber he perceived that the little bed had not been\r\nslept on. At the door of the spare room he looked in. In one corner\r\nstood a walking-stick--his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where did that come from?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We found it there, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah yes--I gave it to him. \xe2\x80\x98Tis like me to play another\xe2\x80\x99s game!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was the last spurt of bitterness that Jocelyn let escape him. He went\r\non towards Mrs. Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s room, preceded by the servant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pierston has come, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 he heard her say to the invalid. But as\r\nthe latter took no notice the woman rushed forward to the bed. \xe2\x80\x98What has\r\nhappened to her, Mr. Pierston? O what do it mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAvice the Second was lying placidly in the position in which the nurse\r\nhad left her; but no breath came from her lips, and a rigidity\r\nof feature was accompanied by the precise expression which had\r\ncharacterized her face when Pierston had her as a girl in his studio.\r\nHe saw that it was death, though she appeared to have breathed her last\r\nonly a few moments before.\r\n\r\nRuth Stockwool\xe2\x80\x99s composure deserted her. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis the shock of finding Miss\r\nAvice gone that has done it!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried. \xe2\x80\x98She has killed her mother!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t say such a terrible thing!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Jocelyn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But she ought to have obeyed her mother--a good mother as she was! How\r\nshe had set her heart upon the wedding, poor soul; and we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nher knowing what had happened! O how ungrateful young folk be! That girl\r\nwill rue this morning\xe2\x80\x99s work!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must get the doctor,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pierston, mechanically, hastening from\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nWhen the local practitioner came he merely confirmed their own verdict,\r\nand thought her death had undoubtedly been hastened by the shock of the\r\nill news upon a feeble heart, following a long strain of anxiety about\r\nthe wedding. He did not consider that an inquest would be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two shadowy figures seen through the grey gauzes of the morning by\r\nRuth, five hours before this time, had gone on to the open place by the\r\nnorth entrance of Sylvania Castle, where the lane to the ruins of the\r\nold castle branched off. A listener would not have gathered that\r\na single word passed between them. The man walked with difficulty,\r\nsupported by the woman. At this spot they stopped and kissed each other\r\na long while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We ought to walk all the way to Budmouth, if we wish not to be\r\ndiscovered,\xe2\x80\x99 he said sadly. \xe2\x80\x98And I can\xe2\x80\x99t even get across the island,\r\neven by your help, darling. It is two miles to the foot of the hill.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe, who was trembling, tried to speak consolingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you could walk we should have to go down the Street of Wells, where\r\nperhaps somebody would know me? Now if we get below here to the Cove,\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t we push off one of the little boats I saw there last night, and\r\npaddle along close to the shore till we get to the north side? Then we\r\ncan walk across to the station very well. It is quite calm, and as the\r\ntide sets in that direction, it will take us along of itself, without\r\nmuch rowing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve often got round in a boat that way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis seemed to be the only plan that offered, and abandoning the\r\nstraight road they wound down the defile spanned further on by the old\r\ncastle arch, and forming the original fosse of the fortress.\r\n\r\nThe stroke of their own footsteps, lightly as these fell, was flapped\r\nback to them with impertinent gratuitousness by the vertical faces of\r\nthe rock, so still was everything around. A little further, and they\r\nemerged upon the open ledge of the lower tier of cliffs, to the right\r\nbeing the sloping pathway leading down to the secluded creek at their\r\nbase--the single practicable spot of exit from or entrance to the isle\r\non this side by a seagoing craft; once an active wharf, whence many a\r\nfine public building had sailed--including Saint Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe timorous shadowy shapes descended the footway, one at least of them\r\nknowing the place so well that she found it scarcely necessary to guide\r\nherself down by touching the natural wall of stone on her right hand, as\r\nher companion did. Thus, with quick suspensive breathings they\r\narrived at the bottom, and trod the few yards of shingle which, on the\r\nforbidding shore hereabout, could be found at this spot alone. It was so\r\nsolitary as to be unvisited often for four-and-twenty hours by a\r\nliving soul. Upon the confined beach were drawn up two or three\r\nfishing-lerrets, and a couple of smaller ones, beside them being a rough\r\nslipway for launching, and a boathouse of tarred boards. The two lovers\r\nunited their strength to push the smallest of the boats down the slope,\r\nand floating it they scrambled in.\r\n\r\nThe girl broke the silence by asking, \xe2\x80\x98Where are the oars?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe felt about the boat, but could find none. \xe2\x80\x98I forgot to look for the\r\noars!\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are locked in the boathouse, I suppose. Now we can only steer and\r\ntrust to the current!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe currents here were of a complicated kind. It was true, as the girl\r\nhad said, that the tide ran round to the north, but at a special moment\r\nin every flood there set in along the shore a narrow reflux contrary to\r\nthe general outer flow, called \xe2\x80\x98The Southern\xe2\x80\x99 by the local sailors. It\r\nwas produced by the peculiar curves of coast lying east and west of the\r\nBeal; these bent southward in two back streams the up-Channel flow on\r\neach side of the peninsula, which two streams united outside the\r\nBeal, and there met the direct tidal flow, the confluence of the three\r\ncurrents making the surface of the sea at this point to boil like a pot,\r\neven in calmest weather. The disturbed area, as is well known, is called\r\nthe Race.\r\n\r\nThus although the outer sea was now running northward to the roadstead\r\nand the mainland of Wessex \xe2\x80\x98The Southern\xe2\x80\x99 ran in full force towards the\r\nBeal and the Race beyond. It caught the lovers\xe2\x80\x99 hapless boat in a\r\nfew moments, and, unable to row across it--mere river\xe2\x80\x99s width that\r\nit was--they beheld the grey rocks near them, and the grim wrinkled\r\nforehead of the isle above, sliding away northwards.\r\n\r\nThey gazed helplessly at each other, though, in the long-living faith\r\nof youth, without distinct fear. The undulations increased in magnitude,\r\nand swung them higher and lower. The boat rocked, received a smart slap\r\nof the waves now and then, and wheeled round, so that the lightship\r\nwhich stolidly winked at them from the quicksand, the single object\r\nwhich told them of their bearings, was sometimes on their right hand and\r\nsometimes on their left. Nevertheless they could always discern from it\r\nthat their course, whether stemwards or sternwards, was steadily south.\r\n\r\nA bright idea occurred to the young man. He pulled out his handkerchief\r\nand, striking a light, set it on fire. She gave him hers, and he made\r\nthat flare up also. The only available fuel left was the small umbrella\r\nthe girl had brought; this was also kindled in an opened state, and he\r\nheld it up by the stem till it was consumed.\r\n\r\nThe lightship had loomed quite large by this time, and a few minutes\r\nafter they had burnt the handkerchiefs and umbrella a coloured flame\r\nreplied to them from the vessel. They flung their arms round each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knew we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be drowned!\xe2\x80\x99 said Avice hysterically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t too,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\nWith the appearance of day a boat put off to their assistance, and they\r\nwere towed towards the heavy red hulk with the large white letters on\r\nits side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. VII. AN OLD TABERNACLE IN A NEW ASPECT\r\n\r\nThe October day thickened into dusk, and Jocelyn sat musing beside the\r\ncorpse of Mrs. Pierston. Avice having gone away nobody knew whither, he\r\nhad acted as the nearest friend of the family, and attended as well as\r\nhe could to the sombre duties necessitated by her mother\xe2\x80\x99s decease. It\r\nwas doubtful, indeed, if anybody else were in a position to do so. Of\r\nAvice the Second\xe2\x80\x99s two brothers, one had been drowned at sea, and the\r\nother had emigrated, while her only child besides the present Avice had\r\ndied in infancy. As for her friends, she had become so absorbed in her\r\nambitious and nearly accomplished design of marrying her daughter to\r\nJocelyn, that she had gradually completed that estrangement between\r\nherself and the other islanders which had been begun so long ago as\r\nwhen, a young woman, she had herself been asked by Pierston to marry\r\nhim. On her tantalizing inability to accept the honour offered, she and\r\nher husband had been set up in a matter-of-fact business in the stone\r\ntrade by her patron, but that unforgettable request in the London studio\r\nhad made her feel ever since a refined kinship with sculpture, and a\r\nproportionate aloofness from mere quarrying, which was, perhaps, no more\r\nthan a venial weakness in Avice the Second. Her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s objection to\r\nJocelyn she could never understand. To her own eye he was no older than\r\nwhen he had proposed to her.\r\n\r\nAs he sat darkling here the ghostly outlines of former shapes taken by\r\nhis Love came round their sister the unconscious corpse, confronting\r\nhim from the wall in sad array, like the pictured Trojan women beheld by\r\nAEneas on the walls of Carthage. Many of them he had idealized in\r\nbust and in figure from time to time, but it was not as such that he\r\nremembered and reanimated them now; rather was it in all their natural\r\ncircumstances, weaknesses, and stains. And then as he came to himself\r\ntheir voices grew fainter; they had all gone off on their different\r\ncareers, and he was left here alone.\r\n\r\nThe probable ridicule that would result to him from the events of the\r\nday he did not mind in itself at all. But he would fain have removed\r\nthe misapprehensions on which it would be based. That, however, was\r\nimpossible. Nobody would ever know the truth about him; what it was he\r\nhad sought that had so eluded, tantalized, and escaped him; what it was\r\nthat had led him such a dance, and had at last, as he believed just now\r\nin the freshness of his loss, been discovered in the girl who had left\r\nhim. It was not the flesh; he had never knelt low to that. Not a woman\r\nin the world had been wrecked by him, though he had been impassioned\r\nby so many. Nobody would guess the further sentiment--the cordial\r\nloving-kindness--which had lain behind what had seemed to him the\r\nenraptured fulfilment of a pleasing destiny postponed for forty years.\r\nHis attraction to the third Avice would be regarded by the world as the\r\nselfish designs of an elderly man on a maid.\r\n\r\nHis life seemed no longer a professional man\xe2\x80\x99s experience, but a ghost\r\nstory; and he would fain have vanished from his haunts on this\r\ncritical afternoon, as the rest had done. He desired to sleep away\r\nhis tendencies, to make something happen which would put an end to his\r\nbondage to beauty in the ideal.\r\n\r\nSo he sat on till it was quite dark, and a light was brought. There was\r\na chilly wind blowing outside, and the lightship on the quicksand afar\r\nlooked harassed and forlorn. The haggard solitude was broken by a ring\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\nPierston heard a voice below, the accents of a woman. They had a ground\r\nquality of familiarity, a superficial articulation of strangeness. Only\r\none person in all his experience had ever possessed precisely those\r\ntones; rich, as if they had once been powerful. Explanations seemed to\r\nbe asked for and given, and in a minute he was informed that a lady was\r\ndownstairs whom perhaps he would like to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is the lady?\xe2\x80\x99 Jocelyn asked.\r\n\r\nThe servant hesitated a little. \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Leverre--the mother of the--young\r\ngentleman Miss Avice has run off with.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--I\xe2\x80\x99ll see her,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pierston.\r\n\r\nHe covered the face of the dead Avice, and descended. \xe2\x80\x98Leverre,\xe2\x80\x99 he said\r\nto himself. His ears had known that name before to-day. It was the name\r\nthose travelling Americans he had met in Rome gave the woman he supposed\r\nmight be Marcia Bencomb.\r\n\r\nA sudden adjusting light burst upon many familiar things at that moment.\r\nHe found the visitor in the drawing-room, standing up veiled, the\r\ncarriage which had brought her being in waiting at the door. By the dim\r\nlight he could see nothing of her features in such circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Pierston?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am Mr. Pierston.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You represent the late Mrs. Pierston?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do--though I am not one of the family.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know it.... I am Marcia--after forty years.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was divining as much, Marcia. May the lines have fallen to you in\r\npleasant places since we last met! But, of all moments of my life, why\r\ndo you choose to hunt me up now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why--I am the step-mother and only relation of the young man your bride\r\neloped with this morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was just guessing that, too, as I came downstairs. But--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I am naturally making inquiries.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Let us take it quietly, and shut the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMarcia sat down. And he learnt that the conjunction of old things and\r\nnew was no accident. What Mrs. Pierston had discussed with her nurse and\r\nneighbour as vague intelligence, was now revealed to Jocelyn at first\r\nhand by Marcia herself; how, many years after their separation, and\r\nwhen she was left poor by the death of her impoverished father, she had\r\nbecome the wife of that bygone Jersey lover of hers, who wanted a tender\r\nnurse and mother for the infant left him by his first wife recently\r\ndeceased; how he had died a few years later, leaving her with the boy,\r\nwhom she had brought up at St. Heliers and in Paris, educating him as\r\nwell as she could with her limited means, till he became the French\r\nmaster at a school in Sandbourne; and how, a year ago, she and her son\r\nhad got to know Mrs. Pierston and her daughter on their visit to the\r\nisland, \xe2\x80\x98to ascertain,\xe2\x80\x99 she added, more deliberately, \xe2\x80\x98not entirely for\r\nsentimental reasons, what had become of the man with whom I eloped in\r\nthe first flush of my young womanhood, and only missed marrying by my\r\nown will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, that was how the acquaintance between the children began, and\r\ntheir passionate attachment to each other.\xe2\x80\x99 She detailed how Avice had\r\ninduced her mother to let her take lessons in French of young Leverre,\r\nrendering their meetings easy. Marcia had never thought of hindering\r\ntheir intimacy, for in her recent years of affliction she had acquired\r\na new interest in the name she had refused to take in her purse-proud\r\nyoung womanhood; and it was not until she knew how determined Mrs.\r\nPierston was to make her daughter Jocelyn\xe2\x80\x99s wife that she had objected\r\nto her son\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance with Avice. But it was too late to hinder what\r\nhad been begun. He had lately been ill, and she had been frightened by\r\nhis not returning home the night before. The note she had received from\r\nhim that day had only informed her that Avice and himself had gone to be\r\nmarried immediately--whither she did not know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean to do?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do nothing: there is nothing to be done.... It is how I served her\r\ngrandmother--one of Time\xe2\x80\x99s revenges.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Served her so for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Now she me for your son.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMarcia paused a long while thinking that over, till arousing herself she\r\nresumed: \xe2\x80\x98But can\xe2\x80\x99t we inquire which way they went out of the island, or\r\ngather some particulars about them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aye--yes. We will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd Pierston found himself as in a dream walking beside Marcia along the\r\nroad in their common quest. He discovered that almost every one of the\r\nneighbouring inhabitants knew more about the lovers than he did himself.\r\n\r\nAt the corner some men were engaged in conversation on the occurrence.\r\nIt was allusive only, but knowing the dialect, Pierston and Marcia\r\ngathered its import easily. As soon as it had got light that morning one\r\nof the boats was discovered missing from the creek below, and when the\r\nflight of the lovers was made known it was inferred that they were the\r\nculprits.\r\n\r\nUnconsciously Pierston turned in the direction of the creek, without\r\nregarding whether Marcia followed him, and though it was darker than\r\nwhen Avice and Leverre had descended in the morning he pursued his way\r\ndown the incline till he reached the water-side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that you, Jocelyn?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe inquiry came from Marcia. She was behind him, about half-way down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, noticing that it was the first time she had called him\r\nby his Christian name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t see where you are, and I am afraid to follow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfraid to follow. How strangely that altered his conception of her.\r\nTill this moment she had stood in his mind as the imperious, invincible\r\nMarcia of old. There was a strange pathos in this revelation. He went\r\nback and felt for her hand. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll lead you down,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. And he did\r\nso.\r\n\r\nThey looked out upon the sea, and the lightship shining as if it had\r\nquite forgotten all about the fugitives. \xe2\x80\x98I am so uneasy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Marcia.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think they got safely to land?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied some one other than Jocelyn. It was a boatman smoking in\r\nthe shadow of the boathouse. He informed her that they were picked up by\r\nthe lightship men, and afterwards, at their request, taken across to\r\nthe opposite shore, where they landed, proceeding thence on foot to\r\nthe nearest railway station and entering the train for London. This\r\nintelligence had reached the island about an hour before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99ll be married to-morrow morning!\xe2\x80\x99 said Marcia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So much the better. Don\xe2\x80\x99t regret it, Marcia. He shall not lose by it. I\r\nhave no relation in the world except some twentieth cousins in the isle,\r\nof whom her father was one, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take steps at once to make her a\r\ngood match for him. As for me... I have lived a day too long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. VIII. \xe2\x80\x98ALAS FOR THIS GREY SHADOW, ONCE A MAN!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn the month of November which followed Pierston was lying dangerously\r\nill of a fever at his house in London.\r\n\r\nThe funeral of the second Avice had happened to be on one of those\r\ndrenching afternoons of the autumn, when the raw rain flies level as the\r\nmissiles of the ancient inhabitants across the beaked promontory which\r\nhas formed the scene of this narrative, scarcely alighting except\r\nagainst the upright sides of things sturdy enough to stand erect.\r\nOne person only followed the corpse into the church as chief mourner,\r\nJocelyn Pierston--fickle lover in the brief, faithful friend in the\r\nlong run. No means had been found of communicating with Avice before the\r\ninterment, though the death had been advertised in the local and other\r\npapers in the hope that it might catch her eye.\r\n\r\nSo, when the pathetic procession came out of the church and moved round\r\ninto the graveyard, a hired vehicle from Budmouth was seen coming at\r\ngreat speed along the open road from Top-o\xe2\x80\x99-Hill. It stopped at the\r\nchurchyard gate, and a young man and woman alighted and entered, the\r\nvehicle waiting. They glided along the path and reached Pierston\xe2\x80\x99s side\r\njust as the body was deposited by the grave.\r\n\r\nHe did not turn his head. He knew it was Avice, with Henri Leverre--by\r\nthis time, he supposed, her husband. Her remorseful grief, though\r\nsilent, seemed to impregnate the atmosphere with its heaviness.\r\nPerceiving that they had not expected him to be there Pierston edged\r\nback; and when the service was over he kept still further aloof, an act\r\nof considerateness which she seemed to appreciate.\r\n\r\nThus, by his own contrivance, neither Avice nor the young man held\r\ncommunication with Jocelyn by word or by sign. After the burial they\r\nreturned as they had come.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed that his exposure that day in the bleakest churchyard\r\nin Wessex, telling upon a distracted mental and bodily condition, had\r\nthrown Pierston into the chill and fever which held him swaying for\r\nweeks between life and death shortly after his return to town. When he\r\nhad passed the crisis, and began to know again that there was such a\r\nstate as mental equilibrium and physical calm, he heard a whispered\r\nconversation going on around him, and the touch of footsteps on the\r\ncarpet. The light in the chamber was so subdued that nothing around him\r\ncould be seen with any distinctness. Two living figures were present, a\r\nnurse moving about softly, and a visitor. He discerned that the latter\r\nwas feminine, and for the time this was all.\r\n\r\nHe was recalled to his surroundings by a voice murmuring the inquiry:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does the light try your eyes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe tones seemed familiar: they were spoken by the woman who was\r\nvisiting him. He recollected them to be Marcia\xe2\x80\x99s, and everything that\r\nhad happened before he fell ill came back to his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you helping to nurse me, Marcia?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. I have come up to stay here till you are better, as you seem to\r\nhave no other woman friend who cares whether you are dead or alive. I am\r\nliving quite near. I am glad you have got round the corner. We have been\r\nvery anxious.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How good you are!... And--have you heard of the others?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are married. They have been here to see you, and are very sorry.\r\nShe sat by you, but you did not know her. She was broken down when she\r\ndiscovered her mother\xe2\x80\x99s death, which had never once occurred to her as\r\nbeing imminent. They have gone away again. I thought it best she should\r\nleave, now that you are out of danger. Now you must be quiet till I come\r\nand talk again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston was conscious of a singular change in himself, which had been\r\nrevealed by this slight discourse. He was no longer the same man that he\r\nhad hitherto been. The malignant fever, or his experiences, or both, had\r\ntaken away something from him, and put something else in its place.\r\n\r\nDuring the next days, with further intellectual expansion, he became\r\nclearly aware of what this was. The artistic sense had left him, and he\r\ncould no longer attach a definite sentiment to images of beauty recalled\r\nfrom the past. His appreciativeness was capable of exercising itself\r\nonly on utilitarian matters, and recollection of Avice\xe2\x80\x99s good qualities\r\nalone had any effect on his mind; of her appearance none at all.\r\n\r\nAt first he was appalled; and then he said, \xe2\x80\x98Thank God!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMarcia, who, with something of her old absolutism, came to his house\r\ncontinually to inquire and give orders, and to his room to see him every\r\nafternoon, found out for herself in the course of his convalescence this\r\nstrange death of the sensuous side of Jocelyn\xe2\x80\x99s nature. She had said\r\nthat Avice was getting extraordinarily handsome, and that she did not\r\nwonder her stepson lost his heart to her--an inadvertent remark which\r\nshe immediately regretted, in fear lest it should agitate him. He merely\r\nanswered, however, \xe2\x80\x98Yes; I suppose she is handsome. She\xe2\x80\x99s more--a wise\r\ngirl who will make a good housewife in time.... I wish you were not\r\nhandsome, Marcia.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite know why. Well--it seems a stupid quality to me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand what it is good for any more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O--I as a woman think there\xe2\x80\x99s good in it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is there? Then I have lost all conception of it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what has\r\nhappened to me. I only know I don\xe2\x80\x99t regret it. Robinson Crusoe lost\r\na day in his illness: I have lost a faculty, for which loss Heaven be\r\npraised!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was something pathetic in this announcement, and Marcia sighed as\r\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x98Perhaps when you get strong it will come back to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPierston shook his head. It then occurred to him that never since the\r\nreappearance of Marcia had he seen her in full daylight, or without\r\na bonnet and thick veil, which she always retained on these frequent\r\nvisits, and that he had been unconsciously regarding her as the Marcia\r\nof their early time, a fancy which the small change in her voice well\r\nsustained. The stately figure, the good colour, the classical profile,\r\nthe rather large handsome nose and somewhat prominent, regular teeth,\r\nthe full dark eye, formed still the Marcia of his imagination; the\r\nqueenly creature who had infatuated him when the first Avice was\r\ndespised and her successors unknown. It was this old idea which, in his\r\nrevolt from beauty, had led to his regret at her assumed handsomeness.\r\nHe began wondering now how much remained of that presentation after\r\nforty years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you ever let me see you, Marcia?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. You mean without my bonnet? You have never asked me\r\nto, and I am obliged to wrap up my face with this wool veil because I\r\nsuffer so from aches in these cold winter winds, though a thick veil is\r\nawkward for any one whose sight is not so good as it was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe impregnable Marcia\xe2\x80\x99s sight not so good as it was, and her face\r\nin the aching stage of life: these simple things came as sermons to\r\nJocelyn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But certainly I will gratify your curiosity,\xe2\x80\x99 she resumed\r\ngood-naturedly. \xe2\x80\x98It is really a compliment that you should still take\r\nthat sort of interest in me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had moved round from the dark side of the room to the lamp--for the\r\ndaylight had gone--and she now suddenly took off the bonnet, veil\r\nand all. She stood revealed to his eyes as remarkably good-looking,\r\nconsidering the lapse of years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am--vexed!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, turning his head aside impatiently. \xe2\x80\x98You are\r\nfair and five-and-thirty--not a day more. You still suggest beauty. YOU\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do as a chastisement, Marcia!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, but I may! To think that you know woman no better after all this\r\ntime!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be so easily deceived. Think: it is lamplight; and your sight is\r\nweak at present; and... Well, I have no reason for being anything but\r\ncandid now, God knows! So I will tell you.... My husband was younger\r\nthan myself; and he had an absurd wish to make people think he had\r\nmarried a young and fresh-looking woman. To fall in with his vanity I\r\ntried to look it. We were often in Paris, and I became as skilled in\r\nbeautifying artifices as any passee wife of the Faubourg St. Germain.\r\nSince his death I have kept up the practice, partly because the vice is\r\nalmost ineradicable, and partly because I found that it helped me\r\nwith men in bringing up his boy on small means. At this moment I\r\nam frightfully made up. But I can cure that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come in to-morrow\r\nmorning, if it is bright, just as I really am; you\xe2\x80\x99ll find that Time has\r\nnot disappointed you. Remember I am as old as yourself; and I look it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe morrow came, and with it Marcia, quite early, as she had promised.\r\nIt happened to be sunny, and shutting the bedroom door she went round to\r\nthe window, where she uncovered immediately, in his full view, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98See if I am satisfactory now--to you who think beauty vain. The rest\r\nof me--and it is a good deal--lies on my dressing-table at home. I shall\r\nnever put it on again--never!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut she was a woman; and her lips quivered, and there was a tear in her\r\neye, as she exposed the ruthless treatment to which she had subjected\r\nherself. The cruel morning rays--as with Jocelyn under Avice\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nscrutiny--showed in their full bareness, unenriched by addition,\r\nundisguised by the arts of colour and shade, the thin remains of\r\nwhat had once been Marcia\xe2\x80\x99s majestic bloom. She stood the image and\r\nsuperscription of Age--an old woman, pale and shrivelled, her forehead\r\nploughed, her cheek hollow, her hair white as snow. To this the face he\r\nonce kissed had been brought by the raspings, chisellings, scourgings,\r\nbakings, freezings of forty invidious years--by the thinkings of more\r\nthan half a lifetime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry if I shock you,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on huskily but firmly, as he\r\ndid not speak. \xe2\x80\x98But the moth frets the garment somewhat in such an\r\ninterval.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--yes!... Marcia, you are a brave woman. You have the courage of the\r\ngreat women of history. I can no longer love; but I admire you from my\r\nsoul!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t say I am great. Say I have begun to be passably honest. It is\r\nmore than enough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well--I\xe2\x80\x99ll say nothing then, more than how wonderful it is that a woman\r\nshould have been able to put back the clock of Time thirty years!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It shames me now, Jocelyn. I shall never do it any more!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was strong enough he got her to take him round to his\r\nstudio in a carriage. The place had been kept aired, but the shutters\r\nwere shut, and they opened them themselves. He looked round upon the\r\nfamiliar objects--some complete and matured, the main of them seedlings,\r\ngrafts, and scions of beauty, waiting for a mind to grow to perfection\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--I don\xe2\x80\x99t like them!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, turning away. \xe2\x80\x98They are as ugliness\r\nto me! I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel a single touch of kin with or interest in any one of\r\nthem whatever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jocelyn--this is sad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--not at all.\xe2\x80\x99 He went again towards the door. \xe2\x80\x98Now let me look\r\nround.\xe2\x80\x99 He looked back, Marcia remaining silent. \xe2\x80\x98The Aphrodites--how I\r\ninsulted her fair form by those failures!--the Freyjas, the Nymphs and\r\nFauns, Eves, Avices, and other innumerable Well-Beloveds--I want to see\r\nthem never any more!... \xe2\x80\x9cInstead of sweet smell there shall be stink,\r\nand there shall be burning instead of beauty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prophet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd they came away. On another afternoon they went to the National\r\nGallery, to test his taste in paintings, which had formerly been good.\r\nAs she had expected, it was just the same with him there. He saw no more\r\nto move him, he declared, in the time-defying presentations of Perugino,\r\nTitian, Sebastiano, and other statuesque creators than in the work of\r\nthe pavement artist they had passed on their way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is strange!\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t regret it. That fever has killed a faculty which has, after\r\nall, brought me my greatest sorrows, if a few little pleasures. Let us\r\nbe gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was now so well advanced in convalescence that it was deemed a most\r\ndesirable thing to take him down into his native air. Marcia agreed\r\nto accompany him. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98An old\r\nfriendless woman like me, and you an old friendless man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Thank Heaven I am old at last. The curse is removed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt may be shortly stated here that after his departure for the isle\r\nPierston never again saw his studio or its contents. He had been down\r\nthere but a brief while when, finding his sense of beauty in art and\r\nnature absolutely extinct, he directed his agent in town to disperse the\r\nwhole collection; which was done. His lease of the building was sold,\r\nand in the course of time another sculptor won admiration there from\r\nthose who knew not Joseph. The next year his name figured on the retired\r\nlist of Academicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nAs time went on he grew as well as one of his age could expect to be\r\nafter such a blasting illness, but remained on the isle, in the only\r\nhouse he now possessed, a comparatively small one at the top of the\r\nStreet of Wells. A growing sense of friendship which it would be foolish\r\nto interrupt led him to take a somewhat similar house for Marcia quite\r\nnear, and remove her furniture thither from Sandbourne. Whenever the\r\nafternoon was fine he would call for her and they would take a stroll\r\ntogether towards the Beal, or the ancient Castle, seldom going the whole\r\nway, his sciatica and her rheumatism effectually preventing them,\r\nexcept in the driest atmospheres. He had now changed his style of dress\r\nentirely, appearing always in a homely suit of local make, and of the\r\nfashion of thirty years before, the achievement of a tailoress at East\r\nQuarriers. He also let his iron-grey beard grow as it would, and what\r\nlittle hair he had left from the baldness which had followed the fever.\r\nAnd thus, numbering in years but two-and-sixty, he might have passed for\r\nseventy-five.\r\n\r\nThough their early adventure as lovers had happened so long ago, its\r\nhistory had become known in the isle with mysterious rapidity and\r\nfulness of detail. The gossip to which its bearing on their present\r\nfriendship gave rise was the subject of their conversation on one of\r\nthese walks along the cliffs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is extraordinary what an interest our neighbours take in our\r\naffairs,\xe2\x80\x99 he observed. \xe2\x80\x98They say \xe2\x80\x9cthose old folk ought to marry; better\r\nlate than never.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s how people are--wanting to round off other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s histories in the best machine-made conventional manner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. They keep on about it to me, too, indirectly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do they! I believe a deputation will wait upon us some morning,\r\nrequesting in the interests of matchmaking that we will please to get\r\nmarried as soon as possible.... How near we were to doing it forty years\r\nago, only you were so independent! I thought you would have come back\r\nand was much surprised that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My independent ideas were not blameworthy in me, as an islander, though\r\nas a kimberlin young lady perhaps they would have been. There was simply\r\nno reason from an islander\xe2\x80\x99s point of view why I should come back, since\r\nno result threatened from our union; and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. My father kept that\r\nview before me, and I bowed to his judgment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so the island ruled our destinies, though we were not on it.\r\nYes--we are in hands not our own.... Did you ever tell your husband?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did he ever hear anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not that I am aware.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCalling upon her one day, he found her in a state of great discomfort.\r\nIn certain gusty winds the chimneys of the little house she had taken\r\nhere smoked intolerably, and one of these winds was blowing then. Her\r\ndrawing-room fire could not be kept burning, and rather than let a woman\r\nwho suffered from rheumatism shiver fireless he asked her to come\r\nround and lunch with him as she had often done before. As they went he\r\nthought, not for the first time, how needless it was that she should be\r\nput to this inconvenience by their occupying two houses, when one would\r\nbetter suit their now constant companionship, and disembarrass her\r\nof the objectionable chimneys. Moreover, by marrying Marcia, and\r\nestablishing a parental relation with the young people, the rather\r\ndelicate business of his making them a regular allowance would become a\r\nnatural proceeding.\r\n\r\nAnd so the zealous wishes of the neighbours to give a geometrical shape\r\nto their story were fulfilled almost in spite of the chief parties\r\nthemselves. When he put the question to her distinctly, Marcia admitted\r\nthat she had always regretted the imperious decision of her youth; and\r\nshe made no ado about accepting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no love to give, you know, Marcia,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98But such\r\nfriendship as I am capable of is yours till the end.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is nearly the same with me--perhaps not quite. But, like the other\r\npeople, I have somehow felt, and you will understand why, that I ought\r\nto be your wife before I die.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt chanced that a day or two before the ceremony, which was fixed to\r\ntake place very shortly after the foregoing conversation, Marcia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrheumatism suddenly became acute. The attack promised, however, to be\r\nonly temporary, owing to some accidental exposure of herself in making\r\npreparations for removal, and as they thought it undesirable to postpone\r\ntheir union for such a reason, Marcia, after being well wrapped up, was\r\nwheeled into the church in a chair.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *          *          *\r\n\r\n\r\nA month thereafter, when they were sitting at breakfast one morning,\r\nMarcia exclaimed \xe2\x80\x98Well--good heavens!\xe2\x80\x99 while reading a letter she had\r\njust received from Avice, who was living with her husband in a house\r\nPierston had bought for them at Sandbourne.\r\n\r\nJocelyn looked up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why--Avice says she wants to be separated from Henri! Did you ever hear\r\nof such a thing! She\xe2\x80\x99s coming here about it to-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Separated? What does the child mean!\xe2\x80\x99 Pierston read the letter.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ridiculous nonsense!\xe2\x80\x99 he continued. \xe2\x80\x98She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what she wants.\r\nI say she sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be separated! Tell her so, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it.\r\nWhy--how long have they been married? Not twelve months. What will she\r\nsay when they have been married twenty years!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMarcia remained reflecting. \xe2\x80\x98I think that remorseful feeling she\r\nunluckily has at times, of having disobeyed her mother, and caused her\r\ndeath, makes her irritable,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured. \xe2\x80\x98Poor child!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLunch-time had hardly come when Avice arrived, looking very tearful and\r\nexcited. Marcia took her into an inner room, had a conversation with\r\nher, and they came out together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Marcia. \xe2\x80\x98I tell her she must go back directly she\r\nhas had some luncheon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s all very well!\xe2\x80\x99 sobbed Avice. \xe2\x80\x98B-b-but if you had been\r\nm-married so long as I have, y-you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say go back like that!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it all about?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Pierston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He said that if he were to die I--I--should be looking out for somebody\r\nwith fair hair and grey eyes, just--just to spite him in his grave,\r\nbecause he\xe2\x80\x99s dark, and he\xe2\x80\x99s quite sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t like dark people! And\r\nthen he said--But I won\xe2\x80\x99t be so treacherous as to tell any more about\r\nhim! I wish--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Avice, your mother did this very thing. And she went back to her\r\nhusband. Now you are to do the same. Let me see; there is a train--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She must have something to eat first. Sit down, dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe question was settled by the arrival of Henri himself at the end\r\nof luncheon, with a very anxious and pale face. Pierston went off to a\r\nbusiness meeting, and left the young couple to adjust their differences\r\nin their own way.\r\n\r\nHis business was, among kindred undertakings which followed the\r\nextinction of the Well-Beloved and other ideals, to advance a scheme for\r\nthe closing of the old natural fountains in the Street of Wells, because\r\nof their possible contamination, and supplying the townlet with water\r\nfrom pipes, a scheme that was carried out at his expense, as is well\r\nknown. He was also engaged in acquiring some old moss-grown, mullioned\r\nElizabethan cottages, for the purpose of pulling them down because\r\nthey were damp; which he afterwards did, and built new ones with hollow\r\nwalls, and full of ventilators.\r\n\r\nAt present he is sometimes mentioned as \xe2\x80\x98the late Mr. Pierston\xe2\x80\x99 by\r\ngourd-like young art-critics and journalists; and his productions are\r\nalluded to as those of a man not without genius, whose powers were\r\ninsufficiently recognized in his lifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Well-Beloved, by Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WELL-BELOVED ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 3326-0.txt or 3326-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/3/2/3326/\r\n\r\nProduced by Les Bowler\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
