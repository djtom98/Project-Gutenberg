But not of late years are we about to speak; we\r\nare going back to the beginning of this century: late years--present\r\nyears are dusty, sunburnt, hot, arid; we will evade the noon, forget it\r\nin siesta, pass the midday in slumber, and dream of dawn.\r\n\r\nIf you think, from this prelude, that anything like a romance is\r\npreparing for you, reader, you never were more mistaken. Do you\r\nanticipate sentiment, and poetry, and reverie? Do you expect passion,\r\nand stimulus, and melodrama? Calm your expectations; reduce them to a\r\nlowly standard. Something real, cool, and solid lies before you;\r\nsomething unromantic as Monday morning, when all who have work wake with\r\nthe consciousness that they must rise and betake themselves thereto. It\r\nis not positively affirmed that you shall not have a taste of the\r\nexciting, perhaps towards the middle and close of the meal, but it is\r\nresolved that the first dish set upon the table shall be one that a\r\nCatholic--ay, even an Anglo-Catholic--might eat on Good Friday in\r\nPassion Week: it shall be cold lentils and vinegar without oil; it shall\r\nbe unleavened bread with bitter herbs, and no roast lamb.\r\n\r\nOf late years, I say, an abundant shower of curates has fallen upon the\r\nnorth of England; but in eighteen-hundred-eleven-twelve that affluent\r\nrain had not descended. Curates were scarce then: there was no Pastoral\r\nAid--no Additional Curates\' Society to stretch a helping hand to\r\nworn-out old rectors and incumbents, and give them the wherewithal to\r\npay a vigorous young colleague from Oxford or Cambridge. The present\r\nsuccessors of the apostles, disciples of Dr. Pusey and tools of the\r\nPropaganda, were at that time being hatched under cradle-blankets, or\r\nundergoing regeneration by nursery-baptism in wash-hand basins. You\r\ncould not have guessed by looking at any one of them that the\r\nItalian-ironed double frills of its net-cap surrounded the brows of a\r\npreordained, specially-sanctified successor of St. Paul, St. Peter, or\r\nSt. John; nor could you have foreseen in the folds of its long\r\nnight-gown the white surplice in which it was hereafter cruelly to\r\nexercise the souls of its parishioners, and strangely to nonplus its\r\nold-fashioned vicar by flourishing aloft in a pulpit the shirt-like\r\nraiment which had never before waved higher than the reading-desk.\r\n\r\nYet even in those days of scarcity there were curates: the precious\r\nplant was rare, but it might be found. A certain favoured district in\r\nthe West Riding of Yorkshire could boast three rods of Aaron blossoming\r\nwithin a circuit of twenty miles. You shall see them, reader. Step into\r\nthis neat garden-house on the skirts of Whinbury, walk forward into the\r\nlittle parlour. There they are at dinner. Allow me to introduce them to\r\nyou: Mr. Donne, curate of Whinbury; Mr. Malone, curate of Briarfield;\r\nMr. Sweeting, curate of Nunnely. These are Mr. Donne\'s lodgings, being\r\nthe habitation of one John Gale, a small clothier. Mr. Donne has kindly\r\ninvited his brethren to regale with him. You and I will join the party,\r\nsee what is to be seen, and hear what is to be heard. At present,\r\nhowever, they are only eating; and while they eat we will talk aside.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen are in the bloom of youth; they possess all the activity\r\nof that interesting age--an activity which their moping old vicars would\r\nfain turn into the channel of their pastoral duties, often expressing a\r\nwish to see it expended in a diligent superintendence of the schools,\r\nand in frequent visits to the sick of their respective parishes. But the\r\nyouthful Levites feel this to be dull work; they prefer lavishing their\r\nenergies on a course of proceeding which, though to other eyes it appear\r\nmore heavy with _ennui_, more cursed with monotony, than the toil of\r\nthe weaver at his loom, seems to yield them an unfailing supply of\r\nenjoyment and occupation.\r\n\r\nI allude to a rushing backwards and forwards, amongst themselves, to and\r\nfrom their respective lodgings--not a round, but a triangle of visits,\r\nwhich they keep up all the year through, in winter, spring, summer, and\r\nautumn. Season and weather make no difference; with unintelligible zeal\r\nthey dare snow and hail, wind and rain, mire and dust, to go and dine,\r\nor drink tea, or sup with each other. What attracts them it would be\r\ndifficult to say. It is not friendship, for whenever they meet they\r\nquarrel. It is not religion--the thing is never named amongst them;\r\ntheology they may discuss occasionally, but piety--never. It is not the\r\nlove of eating and drinking: each might have as good a joint and\r\npudding, tea as potent, and toast as succulent, at his own lodgings, as\r\nis served to him at his brother\'s. Mrs. Gale, Mrs. Hogg, and Mrs.\r\nWhipp--their respective landladies--affirm that "it is just for naught\r\nelse but to give folk trouble." By "folk" the good ladies of course mean\r\nthemselves, for indeed they are kept in a continual "fry" by this system\r\nof mutual invasion.\r\n\r\nMr. Donne and his guests, as I have said, are at dinner; Mrs. Gale waits\r\non them, but a spark of the hot kitchen fire is in her eye. She\r\nconsiders that the privilege of inviting a friend to a meal\r\noccasionally, without additional charge (a privilege included in the\r\nterms on which she lets her lodgings), has been quite sufficiently\r\nexercised of late. The present week is yet but at Thursday, and on\r\nMonday Mr. Malone, the curate of Briarfield, came to breakfast and\r\nstayed dinner; on Tuesday Mr. Malone and Mr. Sweeting of Nunnely came to\r\ntea, remained to supper, occupied the spare bed, and favoured her with\r\ntheir company to breakfast on Wednesday morning; now, on Thursday, they\r\nare both here at dinner, and she is almost certain they will stay all\r\nnight. "C\'en est trop," she would say, if she could speak French.\r\n\r\nMr. Sweeting is mincing the slice of roast beef on his plate, and\r\ncomplaining that it is very tough; Mr. Donne says the beer is flat. Ay,\r\nthat is the worst of it: if they would only be civil Mrs. Gale wouldn\'t\r\nmind it so much, if they would only seem satisfied with what they get\r\nshe wouldn\'t care; but "these young parsons is so high and so scornful,\r\nthey set everybody beneath their \'fit.\' They treat her with less than\r\ncivility, just because she doesn\'t keep a servant, but does the work of\r\nthe house herself, as her mother did afore her; then they are always\r\nspeaking against Yorkshire ways and Yorkshire folk," and by that very\r\ntoken Mrs. Gale does not believe one of them to be a real gentleman, or\r\ncome of gentle kin. "The old parsons is worth the whole lump of college\r\nlads; they know what belongs to good manners, and is kind to high and\r\nlow."\r\n\r\n"More bread!" cries Mr. Malone, in a tone which, though prolonged but to\r\nutter two syllables, proclaims him at once a native of the land of\r\nshamrocks and potatoes. Mrs. Gale hates Mr. Malone more than either of\r\nthe other two; but she fears him also, for he is a tall, strongly-built\r\npersonage, with real Irish legs and arms, and a face as genuinely\r\nnational--not the Milesian face, not Daniel O\'Connell\'s style, but the\r\nhigh-featured, North-American-Indian sort of visage, which belongs to a\r\ncertain class of the Irish gentry, and has a petrified and proud look,\r\nbetter suited to the owner of an estate of slaves than to the landlord\r\nof a free peasantry. Mr. Malone\'s father termed himself a gentleman: he\r\nwas poor and in debt, and besottedly arrogant; and his son was like him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gale offered the loaf.\r\n\r\n"Cut it, woman," said her guest; and the "woman" cut it accordingly. Had\r\nshe followed her inclinations, she would have cut the parson also; her\r\nYorkshire soul revolted absolutely from his manner of command.\r\n\r\nThe curates had good appetites, and though the beef was "tough," they\r\nate a great deal of it. They swallowed, too, a tolerable allowance of\r\nthe "flat beer," while a dish of Yorkshire pudding, and two tureens of\r\nvegetables, disappeared like leaves before locusts. The cheese, too,\r\nreceived distinguished marks of their attention; and a "spice-cake,"\r\nwhich followed by way of dessert, vanished like a vision, and was no\r\nmore found. Its elegy was chanted in the kitchen by Abraham, Mrs. Gale\'s\r\nson and heir, a youth of six summers; he had reckoned upon the reversion\r\nthereof, and when his mother brought down the empty platter, he lifted\r\nup his voice and wept sore.\r\n\r\nThe curates, meantime, sat and sipped their wine, a liquor of\r\nunpretending vintage, moderately enjoyed. Mr. Malone, indeed, would much\r\nrather have had whisky; but Mr. Donne, being an Englishman, did not keep\r\nthe beverage. While they sipped they argued, not on politics, nor on\r\nphilosophy, nor on literature--these topics were now, as ever, totally\r\nwithout interest for them--not even on theology, practical or doctrinal,\r\nbut on minute points of ecclesiastical discipline, frivolities which\r\nseemed empty as bubbles to all save themselves. Mr. Malone, who\r\ncontrived to secure two glasses of wine, when his brethren contented\r\nthemselves with one, waxed by degrees hilarious after his fashion; that\r\nis, he grew a little insolent, said rude things in a hectoring tone, and\r\nlaughed clamorously at his own brilliancy.\r\n\r\nEach of his companions became in turn his butt. Malone had a stock of\r\njokes at their service, which he was accustomed to serve out regularly\r\non convivial occasions like the present, seldom varying his wit; for\r\nwhich, indeed, there was no necessity, as he never appeared to consider\r\nhimself monotonous, and did not at all care what others thought. Mr.\r\nDonne he favoured with hints about his extreme meagreness, allusions to\r\nhis turned-up nose, cutting sarcasms on a certain threadbare chocolate\r\nsurtout which that gentleman was accustomed to sport whenever it rained\r\nor seemed likely to rain, and criticisms on a choice set of cockney\r\nphrases and modes of pronunciation, Mr. Donne\'s own property, and\r\ncertainly deserving of remark for the elegance and finish they\r\ncommunicated to his style.\r\n\r\nMr. Sweeting was bantered about his stature--he was a little man, a mere\r\nboy in height and breadth compared with the athletic Malone; rallied on\r\nhis musical accomplishments--he played the flute and sang hymns like a\r\nseraph, some young ladies of his parish thought; sneered at as "the\r\nladies\' pet;" teased about his mamma and sisters, for whom poor Mr.\r\nSweeting had some lingering regard, and of whom he was foolish enough\r\nnow and then to speak in the presence of the priestly Paddy, from whose\r\nanatomy the bowels of natural affection had somehow been omitted.\r\n\r\nThe victims met these attacks each in his own way: Mr. Donne with a\r\nstilted self-complacency and half-sullen phlegm, the sole props of his\r\notherwise somewhat rickety dignity; Mr. Sweeting with the indifference\r\nof a light, easy disposition, which never professed to have any dignity\r\nto maintain.\r\n\r\nWhen Malone\'s raillery became rather too offensive, which it soon did,\r\nthey joined, in an attempt to turn the tables on him by asking him how\r\nmany boys had shouted "Irish Peter!" after him as he came along the road\r\nthat day (Malone\'s name was Peter--the Rev. Peter Augustus Malone);\r\nrequesting to be informed whether it was the mode in Ireland for\r\nclergymen to carry loaded pistols in their pockets, and a shillelah in\r\ntheir hands, when they made pastoral visits; inquiring the signification\r\nof such words as vele, firrum, hellum, storrum (so Mr. Malone invariably\r\npronounced veil, firm, helm, storm), and employing such other methods of\r\nretaliation as the innate refinement of their minds suggested.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, would not do. Malone, being neither good-natured nor\r\nphlegmatic, was presently in a towering passion. He vociferated,\r\ngesticulated; Donne and Sweeting laughed. He reviled them as Saxons and\r\nsnobs at the very top pitch of his high Celtic voice; they taunted him\r\nwith being the native of a conquered land. He menaced rebellion in the\r\nname of his "counthry," vented bitter hatred against English rule; they\r\nspoke of rags, beggary, and pestilence. The little parlour was in an\r\nuproar; you would have thought a duel must follow such virulent abuse;\r\nit seemed a wonder that Mr. and Mrs. Gale did not take alarm at the\r\nnoise, and send for a constable to keep the peace. But they were\r\naccustomed to such demonstrations; they well knew that the curates never\r\ndined or took tea together without a little exercise of the sort, and\r\nwere quite easy as to consequences, knowing that these clerical quarrels\r\nwere as harmless as they were noisy, that they resulted in nothing, and\r\nthat, on whatever terms the curates might part to-night, they would be\r\nsure to meet the best friends in the world to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\nAs the worthy pair were sitting by their kitchen fire, listening to the\r\nrepeated and sonorous contact of Malone\'s fist with the mahogany plane\r\nof the parlour table, and to the consequent start and jingle of\r\ndecanters and glasses following each assault, to the mocking laughter of\r\nthe allied English disputants, and the stuttering declamation of the\r\nisolated Hibernian--as they thus sat, a foot was heard on the outer\r\ndoor-step, and the knocker quivered to a sharp appeal.\r\n\r\nMr. Gale went and opened.\r\n\r\n"Whom have you upstairs in the parlour?" asked a voice--a rather\r\nremarkable voice, nasal in tone, abrupt in utterance.\r\n\r\n"O Mr. Helstone, is it you, sir? I could hardly see you for the\r\ndarkness; it is so soon dark now. Will you walk in, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I want to know first whether it is worth my while walking in. Whom have\r\nyou upstairs?"\r\n\r\n"The curates, sir."\r\n\r\n"What! all of them?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Been dining here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"That will do."\r\n\r\nWith these words a person entered--a middle-aged man, in black. He\r\nwalked straight across the kitchen to an inner door, opened it, inclined\r\nhis head forward, and stood listening. There was something to listen to,\r\nfor the noise above was just then louder than ever.\r\n\r\n"Hey!" he ejaculated to himself; then turning to Mr. Gale--"Have you\r\noften this sort of work?"\r\n\r\nMr. Gale had been a churchwarden, and was indulgent to the clergy.\r\n\r\n"They\'re young, you know, sir--they\'re young," said he deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n"Young! They want caning. Bad boys--bad boys! And if you were a\r\nDissenter, John Gale, instead of being a good Churchman, they\'d do the\r\nlike--they\'d expose themselves; but I\'ll----"\r\n\r\nBy way of finish to this sentence, he passed through the inner door,\r\ndrew it after him, and mounted the stair. Again he listened a few\r\nminutes when he arrived at the upper room. Making entrance without\r\nwarning, he stood before the curates.\r\n\r\nAnd they were silent; they were transfixed; and so was the invader.\r\nHe--a personage short of stature, but straight of port, and bearing on\r\nbroad shoulders a hawk\'s head, beak, and eye, the whole surmounted by a\r\nRehoboam, or shovel hat, which he did not seem to think it necessary to\r\nlift or remove before the presence in which he then stood--_he_ folded\r\nhis arms on his chest and surveyed his young friends, if friends they\r\nwere, much at his leisure.\r\n\r\n"What!" he began, delivering his words in a voice no longer nasal, but\r\ndeep--more than deep--a voice made purposely hollow and\r\ncavernous--"what! has the miracle of Pentecost been renewed? Have the\r\ncloven tongues come down again? Where are they? The sound filled the\r\nwhole house just now. I heard the seventeen languages in full action:\r\nParthians, and Medes, and Elamites, the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in\r\nJudea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, in\r\nEgypt and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, strangers of Rome, Jews\r\nand proselytes, Cretes and Arabians; every one of these must have had\r\nits representative in this room two minutes since."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, Mr. Helstone," began Mr. Donne; "take a seat, pray,\r\nsir. Have a glass of wine?"\r\n\r\nHis civilities received no answer. The falcon in the black coat\r\nproceeded,--\r\n\r\n"What do I talk about the gift of tongues? Gift, indeed! I mistook the\r\nchapter, and book, and Testament--gospel for law, Acts for Genesis, the\r\ncity of Jerusalem for the plain of Shinar. It was no gift but the\r\nconfusion of tongues which has gabbled me deaf as a post. _You_,\r\napostles? What! you three? Certainly not; three presumptuous Babylonish\r\nmasons--neither more nor less!"\r\n\r\n"I assure you, sir, we were only having a little chat together over a\r\nglass of wine after a friendly dinner--settling the Dissenters!"\r\n\r\n"Oh! settling the Dissenters, were you? Was Malone settling the\r\nDissenters? It sounded to me much more like settling his co-apostles.\r\nYou were quarrelling together, making almost as much noise--you three\r\nalone--as Moses Barraclough, the preaching tailor, and all his hearers\r\nare making in the Methodist chapel down yonder, where they are in the\r\nthick of a revival. I know whose fault it is.--It is yours, Malone."\r\n\r\n"Mine, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yours, sir. Donne and Sweeting were quiet before you came, and would be\r\nquiet if you were gone. I wish, when you crossed the Channel, you had\r\nleft your Irish habits behind you. Dublin student ways won\'t do here.\r\nThe proceedings which might pass unnoticed in a wild bog and mountain\r\ndistrict in Connaught will, in a decent English parish, bring disgrace\r\non those who indulge in them, and, what is far worse, on the sacred\r\ninstitution of which they are merely the humble appendages."\r\n\r\nThere was a certain dignity in the little elderly gentleman\'s manner of\r\nrebuking these youths, though it was not, perhaps, quite the dignity\r\nmost appropriate to the occasion. Mr. Helstone, standing straight as a\r\nramrod, looking keen as a kite, presented, despite his clerical hat,\r\nblack coat, and gaiters, more the air of a veteran officer chiding his\r\nsubalterns than of a venerable priest exhorting his sons in the faith.\r\nGospel mildness, apostolic benignity, never seemed to have breathed\r\ntheir influence over that keen brown visage, but firmness had fixed the\r\nfeatures, and sagacity had carved her own lines about them.\r\n\r\n"I met Supplehough," he continued, "plodding through the mud this wet\r\nnight, going to preach at Milldean opposition shop. As I told you, I\r\nheard Barraclough bellowing in the midst of a conventicle like a\r\npossessed bull; and I find _you_, gentlemen, tarrying over your\r\nhalf-pint of muddy port wine, and scolding like angry old women. No\r\nwonder Supplehough should have dipped sixteen adult converts in a\r\nday--which he did a fortnight since; no wonder Barraclough, scamp and\r\nhypocrite as he is, should attract all the weaver-girls in their flowers\r\nand ribbons, to witness how much harder are his knuckles than the wooden\r\nbrim of his tub; as little wonder that _you_, when you are left to\r\nyourselves, without your rectors--myself, and Hall, and Boultby--to back\r\nyou, should too often perform the holy service of our church to bare\r\nwalls, and read your bit of a dry discourse to the clerk, and the\r\norganist, and the beadle. But enough of the subject. I came to see\r\nMalone.--I have an errand unto thee, O captain!"\r\n\r\n"What is it?" inquired Malone discontentedly. "There can be no funeral\r\nto take at this time of day."\r\n\r\n"Have you any arms about you?"\r\n\r\n"Arms, sir?--yes, and legs." And he advanced the mighty members.\r\n\r\n"Bah! weapons I mean."\r\n\r\n"I have the pistols you gave me yourself. I never part with them. I lay\r\nthem ready cocked on a chair by my bedside at night. I have my\r\nblackthorn."\r\n\r\n"Very good. Will you go to Hollow\'s Mill?"\r\n\r\n"What is stirring at Hollow\'s Mill?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing as yet, nor perhaps will be; but Moore is alone there. He has\r\nsent all the workmen he can trust to Stilbro\'; there are only two women\r\nleft about the place. It would be a nice opportunity for any of his\r\nwell-wishers to pay him a visit, if they knew how straight the path was\r\nmade before them."\r\n\r\n"I am none of his well-wishers, sir. I don\'t care for him."\r\n\r\n"Soh! Malone, you are afraid."\r\n\r\n"You know me better than that. If I really thought there was a chance\r\nof a row I would go: but Moore is a strange, shy man, whom I never\r\npretend to understand; and for the sake of his sweet company only I\r\nwould not stir a step."\r\n\r\n"But there _is_ a chance of a row; if a positive riot does not take\r\nplace--of which, indeed, I see no signs--yet it is unlikely this night\r\nwill pass quite tranquilly. You know Moore has resolved to have new\r\nmachinery, and he expects two wagon-loads of frames and shears from\r\nStilbro\' this evening. Scott, the overlooker, and a few picked men are\r\ngone to fetch them."\r\n\r\n"They will bring them in safely and quietly enough, sir."\r\n\r\n"Moore says so, and affirms he wants nobody. Some one, however, he must\r\nhave, if it were only to bear evidence in case anything should happen. I\r\ncall him very careless. He sits in the counting-house with the shutters\r\nunclosed; he goes out here and there after dark, wanders right up the\r\nhollow, down Fieldhead Lane, among the plantations, just as if he were\r\nthe darling of the neighbourhood, or--being, as he is, its\r\ndetestation--bore a \'charmed life,\' as they say in tale-books. He takes\r\nno warning from the fate of Pearson, nor from that of Armitage--shot,\r\none in his own house and the other on the moor."\r\n\r\n"But he should take warning, sir, and use precautions too," interposed\r\nMr. Sweeting; "and I think he would if he heard what I heard the other\r\nday."\r\n\r\n"What did you hear, Davy?"\r\n\r\n"You know Mike Hartley, sir?"\r\n\r\n"The Antinomian weaver? Yes."\r\n\r\n"When Mike has been drinking for a few weeks together, he generally\r\nwinds up by a visit to Nunnely vicarage, to tell Mr. Hall a piece of his\r\nmind about his sermons, to denounce the horrible tendency of his\r\ndoctrine of works, and warn him that he and all his hearers are sitting\r\nin outer darkness."\r\n\r\n"Well, that has nothing to do with Moore."\r\n\r\n"Besides being an Antinomian, he is a violent Jacobin and leveller,\r\nsir."\r\n\r\n"I know. When he is very drunk, his mind is always running on regicide.\r\nMike is not unacquainted with history, and it is rich to hear him going\r\nover the list of tyrants of whom, as he says, \'the revenger of blood has\r\nobtained satisfaction.\' The fellow exults strangely in murder done on\r\ncrowned heads or on any head for political reasons. I have already\r\nheard it hinted that he seems to have a queer hankering after Moore. Is\r\nthat what you allude to, Sweeting?"\r\n\r\n"You use the proper term, sir. Mr. Hall thinks Mike has no personal\r\nhatred of Moore. Mike says he even likes to talk to him and run after\r\nhim, but he has a _hankering_ that Moore should be made an example of.\r\nHe was extolling him to Mr. Hall the other day as the mill-owner with\r\nthe most brains in Yorkshire, and for that reason he affirms Moore\r\nshould be chosen as a sacrifice, an oblation of a sweet savour. Is Mike\r\nHartley in his right mind, do you think, sir?" inquired Sweeting simply.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t tell, Davy. He may be crazed, or he may be only crafty, or\r\nperhaps a little of both."\r\n\r\n"He talks of seeing visions, sir."\r\n\r\n"Ay! He is a very Ezekiel or Daniel for visions. He came just when I was\r\ngoing to bed last Friday night to describe one that had been revealed to\r\nhim in Nunnely Park that very afternoon."\r\n\r\n"Tell it, sir. What was it?" urged Sweeting.\r\n\r\n"Davy, thou hast an enormous organ of wonder in thy cranium. Malone, you\r\nsee, has none. Neither murders nor visions interest him. See what a big\r\nvacant Saph he looks at this moment."\r\n\r\n"Saph! Who was Saph, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I thought you would not know. You may find it out. It is biblical. I\r\nknow nothing more of him than his name and race; but from a boy upwards\r\nI have always attached a personality to Saph. Depend on it he was\r\nhonest, heavy, and luckless. He met his end at Gob by the hand of\r\nSibbechai."\r\n\r\n"But the vision, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Davy, thou shalt hear. Donne is biting his nails, and Malone yawning,\r\nso I will tell it but to thee. Mike is out of work, like many others,\r\nunfortunately. Mr. Grame, Sir Philip Nunnely\'s steward, gave him a job\r\nabout the priory. According to his account, Mike was busy hedging rather\r\nlate in the afternoon, but before dark, when he heard what he thought\r\nwas a band at a distance--bugles, fifes, and the sound of a trumpet; it\r\ncame from the forest, and he wondered that there should be music there.\r\nHe looked up. All amongst the trees he saw moving objects, red, like\r\npoppies, or white, like may-blossom. The wood was full of them; they\r\npoured out and filled the park. He then perceived they were\r\nsoldiers--thousands and tens of thousands; but they made no more noise\r\nthan a swarm of midges on a summer evening. They formed in order, he\r\naffirmed, and marched, regiment after regiment, across the park. He\r\nfollowed them to Nunnely Common; the music still played soft and\r\ndistant. On the common he watched them go through a number of\r\nevolutions. A man clothed in scarlet stood in the centre and directed\r\nthem. They extended, he declared, over fifty acres. They were in sight\r\nhalf an hour; then they marched away quite silently. The whole time he\r\nheard neither voice nor tread--nothing but the faint music playing a\r\nsolemn march."\r\n\r\n"Where did they go, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Towards Briarfield. Mike followed them. They seemed passing Fieldhead,\r\nwhen a column of smoke, such as might be vomited by a park of artillery,\r\nspread noiseless over the fields, the road, the common, and rolled, he\r\nsaid, blue and dim, to his very feet. As it cleared away he looked again\r\nfor the soldiers, but they were vanished; he saw them no more. Mike,\r\nlike a wise Daniel as he is, not only rehearsed the vision but gave the\r\ninterpretation thereof. It signifies, he intimated, bloodshed and civil\r\nconflict."\r\n\r\n"Do you credit it, sir?" asked Sweeting.\r\n\r\n"Do you, Davy?--But come, Malone; why are you not off?"\r\n\r\n"I am rather surprised, sir, you did not stay with Moore yourself. You\r\nlike this kind of thing."\r\n\r\n"So I should have done, had I not unfortunately happened to engage\r\nBoultby to sup with me on his way home from the Bible Society meeting at\r\nNunnely. I promised to send you as my substitute; for which, by-the-bye,\r\nhe did not thank me. He would much rather have had me than you, Peter.\r\nShould there be any real need of help I shall join you. The mill-bell\r\nwill give warning. Meantime, go--unless (turning suddenly to Messrs.\r\nSweeting and Donne)--unless Davy Sweeting or Joseph Donne prefers\r\ngoing.--What do you say, gentlemen? The commission is an honourable one,\r\nnot without the seasoning of a little real peril; for the country is in\r\na queer state, as you all know, and Moore and his mill and his machinery\r\nare held in sufficient odium. There are chivalric sentiments, there is\r\nhigh-beating courage, under those waistcoats of yours, I doubt not.\r\nPerhaps I am too partial to my favourite Peter. Little David shall be\r\nthe champion, or spotless Joseph.--Malone, you are but a great\r\nfloundering Saul after all, good only to lend your armour. Out with your\r\nfirearms; fetch your shillelah. It is there--in the corner."\r\n\r\nWith a significant grin Malone produced his pistols, offering one to\r\neach of his brethren. They were not readily seized on. With graceful\r\nmodesty each gentleman retired a step from the presented weapon.\r\n\r\n"I never touch them. I never did touch anything of the kind," said Mr.\r\nDonne.\r\n\r\n"I am almost a stranger to Mr. Moore," murmured Sweeting.\r\n\r\n"If you never touched a pistol, try the feel of it now, great satrap of\r\nEgypt. As to the little minstrel, he probably prefers encountering the\r\nPhilistines with no other weapon than his flute.--Get their hats, Peter.\r\nThey\'ll both of \'em go."\r\n\r\n"No, sir; no, Mr. Helstone. My mother wouldn\'t like it," pleaded\r\nSweeting.\r\n\r\n"And I make it a rule never to get mixed up in affairs of the kind,"\r\nobserved Donne.\r\n\r\nHelstone smiled sardonically; Malone laughed a horse-laugh. He then\r\nreplaced his arms, took his hat and cudgel, and saying that "he never\r\nfelt more in tune for a shindy in his life, and that he wished a score\r\nof greasy cloth-dressers might beat up Moore\'s quarters that night," he\r\nmade his exit, clearing the stairs at a stride or two, and making the\r\nhouse shake with the bang of the front-door behind him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE WAGONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evening was pitch dark: star and moon were quenched in gray\r\nrain-clouds--gray they would have been by day; by night they looked\r\nsable. Malone was not a man given to close observation of nature; her\r\nchanges passed, for the most part, unnoticed by him. He could walk miles\r\non the most varying April day and never see the beautiful dallying of\r\nearth and heaven--never mark when a sunbeam kissed the hill-tops, making\r\nthem smile clear in green light, or when a shower wept over them, hiding\r\ntheir crests with the low-hanging, dishevelled tresses of a cloud. He\r\ndid not, therefore, care to contrast the sky as it now appeared--a\r\nmuffled, streaming vault, all black, save where, towards the east, the\r\nfurnaces of Stilbro\' ironworks threw a tremulous lurid shimmer on the\r\nhorizon--with the same sky on an unclouded frosty night. He did not\r\ntrouble himself to ask where the constellations and the planets were\r\ngone, or to regret the "black-blue" serenity of the air-ocean which\r\nthose white islets stud, and which another ocean, of heavier and denser\r\nelement, now rolled below and concealed. He just doggedly pursued his\r\nway, leaning a little forward as he walked, and wearing his hat on the\r\nback of his head, as his Irish manner was. "Tramp, tramp," he went along\r\nthe causeway, where the road boasted the privilege of such an\r\naccommodation; "splash, splash," through the mire-filled cart ruts,\r\nwhere the flags were exchanged for soft mud. He looked but for certain\r\nlandmarks--the spire of Briarfield Church; farther on, the lights of\r\nRedhouse. This was an inn; and when he reached it, the glow of a fire\r\nthrough a half-curtained window, a vision of glasses on a round table,\r\nand of revellers on an oaken settle, had nearly drawn aside the curate\r\nfrom his course. He thought longingly of a tumbler of whisky-and-water.\r\nIn a strange place he would instantly have realized the dream; but the\r\ncompany assembled in that kitchen were Mr. Helstone\'s own parishioners;\r\nthey all knew him. He sighed, and passed on.\r\n\r\nThe highroad was now to be quitted, as the remaining distance to\r\nHollow\'s Mill might be considerably reduced by a short cut across\r\nfields. These fields were level and monotonous. Malone took a direct\r\ncourse through them, jumping hedge and wall. He passed but one building\r\nhere, and that seemed large and hall-like, though irregular. You could\r\nsee a high gable, then a long front, then a low gable, then a thick,\r\nlofty stack of chimneys. There were some trees behind it. It was dark;\r\nnot a candle shone from any window. It was absolutely still; the rain\r\nrunning from the eaves, and the rather wild but very low whistle of the\r\nwind round the chimneys and through the boughs were the sole sounds in\r\nits neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThis building passed, the fields, hitherto flat, declined in a rapid\r\ndescent. Evidently a vale lay below, through which you could hear the\r\nwater run. One light glimmered in the depth. For that beacon Malone\r\nsteered.\r\n\r\nHe came to a little white house--you could see it was white even through\r\nthis dense darkness--and knocked at the door. A fresh-faced servant\r\nopened it. By the candle she held was revealed a narrow passage,\r\nterminating in a narrow stair. Two doors covered with crimson baize, a\r\nstrip of crimson carpet down the steps, contrasted with light-coloured\r\nwalls and white floor, made the little interior look clean and fresh.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Moore is at home, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, but he is not in."\r\n\r\n"Not in! Where is he then?"\r\n\r\n"At the mill--in the counting-house."\r\n\r\nHere one of the crimson doors opened.\r\n\r\n"Are the wagons come, Sarah?" asked a female voice, and a female head at\r\nthe same time was apparent. It might not be the head of a\r\ngoddess--indeed a screw of curl-paper on each side the temples quite\r\nforbade that supposition--but neither was it the head of a Gorgon; yet\r\nMalone seemed to take it in the latter light. Big as he was, he shrank\r\nbashfully back into the rain at the view thereof, and saying, "I\'ll go\r\nto him," hurried in seeming trepidation down a short lane, across an\r\nobscure yard, towards a huge black mill.\r\n\r\nThe work-hours were over; the "hands" were gone. The machinery was at\r\nrest, the mill shut up. Malone walked round it. Somewhere in its great\r\nsooty flank he found another chink of light; he knocked at another\r\ndoor, using for the purpose the thick end of his shillelah, with which\r\nhe beat a rousing tattoo. A key turned; the door unclosed.\r\n\r\n"Is it Joe Scott? What news of the wagons, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"No; it\'s myself. Mr. Helstone would send me."\r\n\r\n"Oh! Mr. Malone." The voice in uttering this name had the slightest\r\npossible cadence of disappointment. After a moment\'s pause it continued,\r\npolitely but a little formally,--\r\n\r\n"I beg you will come in, Mr. Malone. I regret extremely Mr. Helstone\r\nshould have thought it necessary to trouble you so far. There was no\r\nnecessity--I told him so--and on such a night; but walk forwards."\r\n\r\nThrough a dark apartment, of aspect undistinguishable, Malone followed\r\nthe speaker into a light and bright room within--very light and bright\r\nindeed it seemed to eyes which, for the last hour, had been striving to\r\npenetrate the double darkness of night and fog; but except for its\r\nexcellent fire, and for a lamp of elegant design and vivid lustre\r\nburning on a table, it was a very plain place. The boarded floor was\r\ncarpetless; the three or four stiff-backed, green-painted chairs seemed\r\nonce to have furnished the kitchen of some farm-house; a desk of strong,\r\nsolid formation, the table aforesaid, and some framed sheets on the\r\nstone-coloured walls, bearing plans for building, for gardening, designs\r\nof machinery, etc., completed the furniture of the place.\r\n\r\nPlain as it was, it seemed to satisfy Malone, who, when he had removed\r\nand hung up his wet surtout and hat, drew one of the rheumatic-looking\r\nchairs to the hearth, and set his knees almost within the bars of the\r\nred grate.\r\n\r\n"Comfortable quarters you have here, Mr. Moore; and all snug to\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but my sister would be glad to see you, if you would prefer\r\nstepping into the house."\r\n\r\n"Oh no! The ladies are best alone, I never was a lady\'s man. You don\'t\r\nmistake me for my friend Sweeting, do you, Mr. Moore?"\r\n\r\n"Sweeting! Which of them is that? The gentleman in the chocolate\r\novercoat, or the little gentleman?"\r\n\r\n"The little one--he of Nunnely; the cavalier of the Misses Sykes, with\r\nthe whole six of whom he is in love, ha! ha!"\r\n\r\n"Better be generally in love with all than specially with one, I should\r\nthink, in that quarter."\r\n\r\n"But he is specially in love with one besides, for when I and Donne\r\nurged him to make a choice amongst the fair bevy, he named--which do you\r\nthink?"\r\n\r\nWith a queer, quiet smile Mr. Moore replied, "Dora, of course, or\r\nHarriet."\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha! you\'ve an excellent guess. But what made you hit on those two?"\r\n\r\n"Because they are the tallest, the handsomest, and Dora, at least, is\r\nthe stoutest; and as your friend Mr. Sweeting is but a little slight\r\nfigure, I concluded that, according to a frequent rule in such cases, he\r\npreferred his contrast."\r\n\r\n"You are right; Dora it is. But he has no chance, has he, Moore?"\r\n\r\n"What has Mr. Sweeting besides his curacy?"\r\n\r\nThis question seemed to tickle Malone amazingly. He laughed for full\r\nthree minutes before he answered it.\r\n\r\n"What has Sweeting? Why, David has his harp, or flute, which comes to\r\nthe same thing. He has a sort of pinchbeck watch; ditto, ring; ditto,\r\neyeglass. That\'s what he has."\r\n\r\n"How would he propose to keep Miss Sykes in gowns only?"\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha! Excellent! I\'ll ask him that next time I see him. I\'ll roast\r\nhim for his presumption. But no doubt he expects old Christopher Sykes\r\nwould do something handsome. He is rich, is he not? They live in a large\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"Sykes carries on an extensive concern."\r\n\r\n"Therefore he must be wealthy, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Therefore he must have plenty to do with his wealth, and in these times\r\nwould be about as likely to think of drawing money from the business to\r\ngive dowries to his daughters as I should be to dream of pulling down\r\nthe cottage there, and constructing on its ruins a house as large as\r\nFieldhead."\r\n\r\n"Do you know what I heard, Moore, the other day?"\r\n\r\n"No. Perhaps that I _was_ about to effect some such change. Your\r\nBriarfield gossips are capable of saying that or sillier things."\r\n\r\n"That you were going to take Fieldhead on a lease (I thought it looked a\r\ndismal place, by-the-bye, to-night, as I passed it), and that it was\r\nyour intention to settle a Miss Sykes there as mistress--to be married,\r\nin short, ha! ha! Now, which is it? Dora, I am sure. You said she was\r\nthe handsomest."\r\n\r\n"I wonder how often it has been settled that I was to be married since I\r\ncame to Briarfield. They have assigned me every marriageable single\r\nwoman by turns in the district. Now it was the two Misses Wynns--first\r\nthe dark, then the light one; now the red-haired Miss Armitage; then the\r\nmature Ann Pearson. At present you throw on my shoulders all the tribe\r\nof the Misses Sykes. On what grounds this gossip rests God knows. I\r\nvisit nowhere; I seek female society about as assiduously as you do, Mr.\r\nMalone. If ever I go to Whinbury, it is only to give Sykes or Pearson a\r\ncall in their counting-house, where our discussions run on other topics\r\nthan matrimony, and our thoughts are occupied with other things than\r\ncourtships, establishments, dowries. The cloth we can\'t sell, the hands\r\nwe can\'t employ, the mills we can\'t run, the perverse course of events\r\ngenerally, which we cannot alter, fill our hearts, I take it, pretty\r\nwell at present, to the tolerably complete exclusion of such figments as\r\nlove-making, etc."\r\n\r\n"I go along with you completely, Moore. If there is one notion I hate\r\nmore than another, it is that of marriage--I mean marriage in the vulgar\r\nweak sense, as a mere matter of sentiment--two beggarly fools agreeing\r\nto unite their indigence by some fantastic tie of feeling. Humbug! But\r\nan advantageous connection, such as can be formed in consonance with\r\ndignity of views and permanency of solid interests, is not so bad--eh?"\r\n\r\n"No," responded Moore, in an absent manner. The subject seemed to have\r\nno interest for him; he did not pursue it. After sitting for some time\r\ngazing at the fire with a preoccupied air, he suddenly turned his head.\r\n\r\n"Hark!" said he. "Did you hear wheels?"\r\n\r\nRising, he went to the window, opened it, and listened. He soon closed\r\nit. "It is only the sound of the wind rising," he remarked, "and the\r\nrivulet a little swollen, rushing down the hollow. I expected those\r\nwagons at six; it is near nine now."\r\n\r\n"Seriously, do you suppose that the putting up of this new machinery\r\nwill bring you into danger?" inquired Malone. "Helstone seems to think\r\nit will."\r\n\r\n"I only wish the machines--the frames--were safe here, and lodged within\r\nthe walls of this mill. Once put up, I defy the frame-breakers. Let them\r\nonly pay me a visit and take the consequences. My mill is my castle."\r\n\r\n"One despises such low scoundrels," observed Malone, in a profound vein\r\nof reflection. "I almost wish a party would call upon you to-night; but\r\nthe road seemed extremely quiet as I came along. I saw nothing astir."\r\n\r\n"You came by the Redhouse?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"There would be nothing on that road. It is in the direction of Stilbro\'\r\nthe risk lies."\r\n\r\n"And you think there is risk?"\r\n\r\n"What these fellows have done to others they may do to me. There is only\r\nthis difference: most of the manufacturers seem paralyzed when they are\r\nattacked. Sykes, for instance, when his dressing-shop was set on fire\r\nand burned to the ground, when the cloth was torn from his tenters and\r\nleft in shreds in the field, took no steps to discover or punish the\r\nmiscreants: he gave up as tamely as a rabbit under the jaws of a ferret.\r\nNow I, if I know myself, should stand by my trade, my mill, and my\r\nmachinery."\r\n\r\n"Helstone says these three are your gods; that the \'Orders in Council\'\r\nare with you another name for the seven deadly sins; that Castlereagh is\r\nyour Antichrist, and the war-party his legions."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I abhor all these things because they ruin me. They stand in my\r\nway. I cannot get on. I cannot execute my plans because of them. I see\r\nmyself baffled at every turn by their untoward effects."\r\n\r\n"But you are rich and thriving, Moore?"\r\n\r\n"I am very rich in cloth I cannot sell. You should step into my\r\nwarehouse yonder, and observe how it is piled to the roof with pieces.\r\nRoakes and Pearson are in the same condition. America used to be their\r\nmarket, but the Orders in Council have cut that off."\r\n\r\nMalone did not seem prepared to carry on briskly a conversation of this\r\nsort. He began to knock the heels of his boots together, and to yawn.\r\n\r\n"And then to think," continued Mr. Moore who seemed too much taken up\r\nwith the current of his own thoughts to note the symptoms of his guest\'s\r\n_ennui_--"to think that these ridiculous gossips of Whinbury and\r\nBriarfield will keep pestering one about being married! As if there was\r\nnothing to be done in life but to \'pay attention,\' as they say, to some\r\nyoung lady, and then to go to church with her, and then to start on a\r\nbridal tour, and then to run through a round of visits, and then, I\r\nsuppose, to be \'having a family.\' Oh, que le diable emporte!" He broke\r\noff the aspiration into which he was launching with a certain energy,\r\nand added, more calmly, "I believe women talk and think only of these\r\nthings, and they naturally fancy men\'s minds similarly occupied."\r\n\r\n"Of course--of course," assented Malone; "but never mind them." And he\r\nwhistled, looked impatiently round, and seemed to feel a great want of\r\nsomething. This time Moore caught and, it appeared, comprehended his\r\ndemonstrations.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Malone," said he, "you must require refreshment after your wet\r\nwalk. I forget hospitality."\r\n\r\n"Not at all," rejoined Malone; but he looked as if the right nail was at\r\nlast hit on the head, nevertheless. Moore rose and opened a cupboard.\r\n\r\n"It is my fancy," said he, "to have every convenience within myself, and\r\nnot to be dependent on the feminity in the cottage yonder for every\r\nmouthful I eat or every drop I drink. I often spend the evening and sup\r\nhere alone, and sleep with Joe Scott in the mill. Sometimes I am my own\r\nwatchman. I require little sleep, and it pleases me on a fine night to\r\nwander for an hour or two with my musket about the hollow. Mr. Malone,\r\ncan you cook a mutton chop?"\r\n\r\n"Try me. I\'ve done it hundreds of times at college."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a dishful, then, and there\'s the gridiron. Turn them quickly.\r\nYou know the secret of keeping the juices in?"\r\n\r\n"Never fear me; you shall see. Hand a knife and fork, please."\r\n\r\nThe curate turned up his coat-cuffs, and applied himself to the cookery\r\nwith vigour. The manufacturer placed on the table plates, a loaf of\r\nbread, a black bottle, and two tumblers. He then produced a small copper\r\nkettle--still from the same well-stored recess, his cupboard--filled it\r\nwith water from a large stone jar in a corner, set it on the fire beside\r\nthe hissing gridiron, got lemons, sugar, and a small china punch-bowl;\r\nbut while he was brewing the punch a tap at the door called him away.\r\n\r\n"Is it you, Sarah?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. Will you come to supper, please, sir?"\r\n\r\n"No; I shall not be in to-night; I shall sleep in the mill. So lock the\r\ndoors, and tell your mistress to go to bed."\r\n\r\nHe returned.\r\n\r\n"You have your household in proper order," observed Malone approvingly,\r\nas, with his fine face ruddy as the embers over which he bent, he\r\nassiduously turned the mutton chops. "You are not under petticoat\r\ngovernment, like poor Sweeting, a man--whew! how the fat spits! it has\r\nburnt my hand--destined to be ruled by women. Now you and I,\r\nMoore--there\'s a fine brown one for you, and full of gravy--you and I\r\nwill have no gray mares in our stables when we marry."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; I never think about it. If the gray mare is handsome and\r\ntractable, why not?"\r\n\r\n"The chops are done. Is the punch brewed?"\r\n\r\n"There is a glassful. Taste it. When Joe Scott and his minions return\r\nthey shall have a share of this, provided they bring home the frames\r\nintact."\r\n\r\nMalone waxed very exultant over the supper. He laughed aloud at trifles,\r\nmade bad jokes and applauded them himself, and, in short, grew\r\nunmeaningly noisy. His host, on the contrary, remained quiet as before.\r\nIt is time, reader, that you should have some idea of the appearance of\r\nthis same host. I must endeavour to sketch him as he sits at table.\r\n\r\nHe is what you would probably call, at first view, rather a\r\nstrange-looking man; for he is thin, dark, sallow, very foreign of\r\naspect, with shadowy hair carelessly streaking his forehead. It appears\r\nthat he spends but little time at his toilet, or he would arrange it\r\nwith more taste. He seems unconscious that his features are fine, that\r\nthey have a southern symmetry, clearness, regularity in their\r\nchiselling; nor does a spectator become aware of this advantage till he\r\nhas examined him well, for an anxious countenance and a hollow, somewhat\r\nhaggard, outline of face disturb the idea of beauty with one of care.\r\nHis eyes are large, and grave, and gray; their expression is intent and\r\nmeditative, rather searching than soft, rather thoughtful than genial.\r\nWhen he parts his lips in a smile, his physiognomy is agreeable--not\r\nthat it is frank or cheerful even then, but you feel the influence of a\r\ncertain sedate charm, suggestive, whether truly or delusively, of a\r\nconsiderate, perhaps a kind nature, of feelings that may wear well at\r\nhome--patient, forbearing, possibly faithful feelings. He is still\r\nyoung--not more than thirty; his stature is tall, his figure slender.\r\nHis manner of speaking displeases. He has an outlandish accent, which,\r\nnotwithstanding a studied carelessness of pronunciation and diction,\r\ngrates on a British, and especially on a Yorkshire, ear.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore, indeed, was but half a Briton, and scarcely that. He came of\r\na foreign ancestry by the mother\'s side, and was himself born and partly\r\nreared on a foreign soil. A hybrid in nature, it is probable he had a\r\nhybrid\'s feeling on many points--patriotism for one; it is likely that\r\nhe was unapt to attach himself to parties, to sects, even to climes and\r\ncustoms; it is not impossible that he had a tendency to isolate his\r\nindividual person from any community amidst which his lot might\r\ntemporarily happen to be thrown, and that he felt it to be his best\r\nwisdom to push the interests of Robert G\xc3\xa9rard Moore, to the exclusion of\r\nphilanthropic consideration for general interests, with which he\r\nregarded the said G\xc3\xa9rard Moore as in a great measure disconnected. Trade\r\nwas Mr. Moore\'s hereditary calling: the G\xc3\xa9rards of Antwerp had been\r\nmerchants for two centuries back. Once they had been wealthy merchants;\r\nbut the uncertainties, the involvements, of business had come upon them;\r\ndisastrous speculations had loosened by degrees the foundations of their\r\ncredit. The house had stood on a tottering base for a dozen years; and\r\nat last, in the shock of the French Revolution, it had rushed down a\r\ntotal ruin. In its fall was involved the English and Yorkshire firm of\r\nMoore, closely connected with the Antwerp house, and of which one of the\r\npartners, resident in Antwerp, Robert Moore, had married Hortense\r\nG\xc3\xa9rard, with the prospect of his bride inheriting her father Constantine\r\nG\xc3\xa9rard\'s share in the business. She inherited, as we have seen, but his\r\nshare in the liabilities of the firm; and these liabilities, though duly\r\nset aside by a composition with creditors, some said her son Robert\r\naccepted, in his turn, as a legacy, and that he aspired one day to\r\ndischarge them, and to rebuild the fallen house of G\xc3\xa9rard and Moore on a\r\nscale at least equal to its former greatness. It was even supposed that\r\nhe took by-past circumstances much to heart; and if a childhood passed\r\nat the side of a saturnine mother, under foreboding of coming evil, and\r\na manhood drenched and blighted by the pitiless descent of the storm,\r\ncould painfully impress the mind, _his_ probably was impressed in no\r\ngolden characters.\r\n\r\nIf, however, he had a great end of restoration in view, it was not in\r\nhis power to employ great means for its attainment. He was obliged to be\r\ncontent with the day of small things. When he came to Yorkshire,\r\nhe--whose ancestors had owned warehouses in this seaport, and factories\r\nin that inland town, had possessed their town-house and their\r\ncountry-seat--saw no way open to him but to rent a cloth-mill in an\r\nout-of-the-way nook of an out-of-the-way district; to take a cottage\r\nadjoining it for his residence, and to add to his possessions, as\r\npasture for his horse, and space for his cloth-tenters, a few acres of\r\nthe steep, rugged land that lined the hollow through which his\r\nmill-stream brawled. All this he held at a somewhat high rent (for these\r\nwar times were hard, and everything was dear) of the trustees of the\r\nFieldhead estate, then the property of a minor.\r\n\r\nAt the time this history commences, Robert Moore had lived but two years\r\nin the district, during which period he had at least proved himself\r\npossessed of the quality of activity. The dingy cottage was converted\r\ninto a neat, tasteful residence. Of part of the rough land he had made\r\ngarden-ground, which he cultivated with singular, even with Flemish,\r\nexactness and care. As to the mill, which was an old structure, and\r\nfitted up with old machinery, now become inefficient and out of date, he\r\nhad from the first evinced the strongest contempt for all its\r\narrangements and appointments. His aim had been to effect a radical\r\nreform, which he had executed as fast as his very limited capital would\r\nallow; and the narrowness of that capital, and consequent check on his\r\nprogress, was a restraint which galled his spirit sorely. Moore ever\r\nwanted to push on. "Forward" was the device stamped upon his soul; but\r\npoverty curbed him. Sometimes (figuratively) he foamed at the mouth when\r\nthe reins were drawn very tight.\r\n\r\nIn this state of feeling, it is not to be expected that he would\r\ndeliberate much as to whether his advance was or was not prejudicial to\r\nothers. Not being a native, nor for any length of time a resident of the\r\nneighbourhood, he did not sufficiently care when the new inventions\r\nthrew the old workpeople out of employ. He never asked himself where\r\nthose to whom he no longer paid weekly wages found daily bread; and in\r\nthis negligence he only resembled thousands besides, on whom the\r\nstarving poor of Yorkshire seemed to have a closer claim.\r\n\r\nThe period of which I write was an overshadowed one in British history,\r\nand especially in the history of the northern provinces. War was then\r\nat its height. Europe was all involved therein. England, if not weary,\r\nwas worn with long resistance--yes, and half her people were weary too,\r\nand cried out for peace on any terms. National honour was become a mere\r\nempty name, of no value in the eyes of many, because their sight was dim\r\nwith famine; and for a morsel of meat they would have sold their\r\nbirthright.\r\n\r\nThe "Orders in Council," provoked by Napoleon\'s Milan and Berlin\r\ndecrees, and forbidding neutral powers to trade with France, had, by\r\noffending America, cut off the principal market of the Yorkshire woollen\r\ntrade, and brought it consequently to the verge of ruin. Minor foreign\r\nmarkets were glutted, and would receive no more. The Brazils, Portugal,\r\nSicily, were all overstocked by nearly two years\' consumption. At this\r\ncrisis certain inventions in machinery were introduced into the staple\r\nmanufactures of the north, which, greatly reducing the number of hands\r\nnecessary to be employed, threw thousands out of work, and left them\r\nwithout legitimate means of sustaining life. A bad harvest supervened.\r\nDistress reached its climax. Endurance, overgoaded, stretched the hand\r\nof fraternity to sedition. The throes of a sort of moral earthquake were\r\nfelt heaving under the hills of the northern counties. But, as is usual\r\nin such cases, nobody took much notice. When a food-riot broke out in a\r\nmanufacturing town, when a gig-mill was burnt to the ground, or a\r\nmanufacturer\'s house was attacked, the furniture thrown into the\r\nstreets, and the family forced to flee for their lives, some local\r\nmeasures were or were not taken by the local magistracy. A ringleader\r\nwas detected, or more frequently suffered to elude detection; newspaper\r\nparagraphs were written on the subject, and there the thing stopped. As\r\nto the sufferers, whose sole inheritance was labour, and who had lost\r\nthat inheritance--who could not get work, and consequently could not get\r\nwages, and consequently could not get bread--they were left to suffer\r\non, perhaps inevitably left. It would not do to stop the progress of\r\ninvention, to damage science by discouraging its improvements; the war\r\ncould not be terminated; efficient relief could not be raised. There was\r\nno help then; so the unemployed underwent their destiny--ate the bread\r\nand drank the waters of affliction.\r\n\r\nMisery generates hate. These sufferers hated the machines which they\r\nbelieved took their bread from them; they hated the buildings which\r\ncontained those machines; they hated the manufacturers who owned those\r\nbuildings. In the parish of Briarfield, with which we have at present to\r\ndo, Hollow\'s Mill was the place held most abominable; G\xc3\xa9rard Moore, in\r\nhis double character of semi-foreigner and thorough-going progressist,\r\nthe man most abominated. And it perhaps rather agreed with Moore\'s\r\ntemperament than otherwise to be generally hated, especially when he\r\nbelieved the thing for which he was hated a right and an expedient\r\nthing; and it was with a sense of warlike excitement he, on this night,\r\nsat in his counting-house waiting the arrival of his frame-laden wagons.\r\nMalone\'s coming and company were, it may be, most unwelcome to him. He\r\nwould have preferred sitting alone; for he liked a silent, sombre,\r\nunsafe solitude. His watchman\'s musket would have been company enough\r\nfor him; the full-flowing beck in the den would have delivered\r\ncontinuously the discourse most genial to his ear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the queerest look in the world had the manufacturer for some ten\r\nminutes been watching the Irish curate, as the latter made free with the\r\npunch, when suddenly that steady gray eye changed, as if another vision\r\ncame between it and Malone. Moore raised his hand.\r\n\r\n"Chut!" he said in his French fashion, as Malone made a noise with his\r\nglass. He listened a moment, then rose, put his hat on, and went out at\r\nthe counting-house door.\r\n\r\nThe night was still, dark, and stagnant: the water yet rushed on full\r\nand fast; its flow almost seemed a flood in the utter silence. Moore\'s\r\near, however, caught another sound, very distant but yet dissimilar,\r\nbroken and rugged--in short, a sound of heavy wheels crunching a stony\r\nroad. He returned to the counting-house and lit a lantern, with which he\r\nwalked down the mill-yard, and proceeded to open the gates. The big\r\nwagons were coming on; the dray-horses\' huge hoofs were heard splashing\r\nin the mud and water. Moore hailed them.\r\n\r\n"Hey, Joe Scott! Is all right?"\r\n\r\nProbably Joe Scott was yet at too great a distance to hear the inquiry.\r\nHe did not answer it.\r\n\r\n"Is all right, I say?" again asked Moore, when the elephant-like\r\nleader\'s nose almost touched his.\r\n\r\nSome one jumped out from the foremost wagon into the road; a voice cried\r\naloud, "Ay, ay, divil; all\'s raight! We\'ve smashed \'em."\r\n\r\nAnd there was a run. The wagons stood still; they were now deserted.\r\n\r\n"Joe Scott!" No Joe Scott answered. "Murgatroyd! Pighills! Sykes!" No\r\nreply. Mr. Moore lifted his lantern and looked into the vehicles. There\r\nwas neither man nor machinery; they were empty and abandoned.\r\n\r\nNow Mr. Moore loved his machinery. He had risked the last of his capital\r\non the purchase of these frames and shears which to-night had been\r\nexpected. Speculations most important to his interests depended on the\r\nresults to be wrought by them. Where were they?\r\n\r\nThe words "we\'ve smashed \'em" rang in his ears. How did the catastrophe\r\naffect him? By the light of the lantern he held were his features\r\nvisible, relaxing to a singular smile--the smile the man of determined\r\nspirit wears when he reaches a juncture in his life where this\r\ndetermined spirit is to feel a demand on its strength, when the strain\r\nis to be made, and the faculty must bear or break. Yet he remained\r\nsilent, and even motionless; for at the instant he neither knew what to\r\nsay nor what to do. He placed the lantern on the ground, and stood with\r\nhis arms folded, gazing down and reflecting.\r\n\r\nAn impatient trampling of one of the horses made him presently look up.\r\nHis eye in the moment caught the gleam of something white attached to a\r\npart of the harness. Examined by the light of the lantern this proved to\r\nbe a folded paper--a billet. It bore no address without; within was the\r\nsuperscription:--\r\n\r\n"To the Divil of Hollow\'s Miln."\r\n\r\nWe will not copy the rest of the orthography, which was very peculiar,\r\nbut translate it into legible English. It ran thus:--\r\n\r\n"Your hellish machinery is shivered to smash on Stilbro\' Moor, and your\r\nmen are lying bound hand and foot in a ditch by the roadside. Take this\r\nas a warning from men that are starving, and have starving wives and\r\nchildren to go home to when they have done this deed. If you get new\r\nmachines, or if you otherwise go on as you have done, you shall hear\r\nfrom us again. Beware!"\r\n\r\n"Hear from you again? Yes, I\'ll hear from you again, and you shall hear\r\nfrom me. I\'ll speak to you directly. On Stilbro\' Moor you shall hear\r\nfrom me in a moment."\r\n\r\nHaving led the wagons within the gates, he hastened towards the cottage.\r\nOpening the door, he spoke a few words quickly but quietly to two\r\nfemales who ran to meet him in the passage. He calmed the seeming alarm\r\nof one by a brief palliative account of what had taken place; to the\r\nother he said, "Go into the mill, Sarah--there is the key--and ring the\r\nmill-bell as loud as you can. Afterwards you will get another lantern\r\nand help me to light up the front."\r\n\r\nReturning to his horses, he unharnessed, fed, and stabled them with\r\nequal speed and care, pausing occasionally, while so occupied, as if to\r\nlisten for the mill-bell. It clanged out presently, with irregular but\r\nloud and alarming din. The hurried, agitated peal seemed more urgent\r\nthan if the summons had been steadily given by a practised hand. On that\r\nstill night, at that unusual hour, it was heard a long way round. The\r\nguests in the kitchen of the Redhouse were startled by the clamour, and\r\ndeclaring that "there must be summat more nor common to do at Hollow\'s\r\nMiln," they called for lanterns, and hurried to the spot in a body. And\r\nscarcely had they thronged into the yard with their gleaming lights,\r\nwhen the tramp of horses was heard, and a little man in a shovel hat,\r\nsitting erect on the back of a shaggy pony, "rode lightly in," followed\r\nby an aide-de-camp mounted on a larger steed.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore, meantime, after stabling his dray-horses, had saddled his\r\nhackney, and with the aid of Sarah, the servant, lit up his mill, whose\r\nwide and long front now glared one great illumination, throwing a\r\nsufficient light on the yard to obviate all fear of confusion arising\r\nfrom obscurity. Already a deep hum of voices became audible. Mr. Malone\r\nhad at length issued from the counting-house, previously taking the\r\nprecaution to dip his head and face in the stone water-jug; and this\r\nprecaution, together with the sudden alarm, had nearly restored to him\r\nthe possession of those senses which the punch had partially scattered.\r\nHe stood with his hat on the back of his head, and his shillelah grasped\r\nin his dexter fist, answering much at random the questions of the\r\nnewly-arrived party from the Redhouse. Mr. Moore now appeared, and was\r\nimmediately confronted by the shovel hat and the shaggy pony.\r\n\r\n"Well, Moore, what is your business with us? I thought you would want us\r\nto-night--me and the hetman here (patting his pony\'s neck), and Tom and\r\nhis charger. When I heard your mill-bell I could sit still no longer, so\r\nI left Boultby to finish his supper alone. But where is the enemy? I do\r\nnot see a mask or a smutted face present; and there is not a pane of\r\nglass broken in your windows. Have you had an attack, or do you expect\r\none?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, not at all! I have neither had one nor expect one," answered Moore\r\ncoolly. "I only ordered the bell to be rung because I want two or three\r\nneighbours to stay here in the Hollow while I and a couple or so more go\r\nover to Stilbro\' Moor."\r\n\r\n"To Stilbro\' Moor! What to do? To meet the wagons?"\r\n\r\n"The wagons are come home an hour ago."\r\n\r\n"Then all\'s right. What more would you have?"\r\n\r\n"They came home empty; and Joe Scott and company are left on the moor,\r\nand so are the frames. Read that scrawl."\r\n\r\nMr. Helstone received and perused the document of which the contents\r\nhave before been given.\r\n\r\n"Hum! They\'ve only served you as they serve others. But, however, the\r\npoor fellows in the ditch will be expecting help with some impatience.\r\nThis is a wet night for such a berth. I and Tom will go with you. Malone\r\nmay stay behind and take care of the mill. What is the matter with him?\r\nHis eyes seem starting out of his head."\r\n\r\n"He has been eating a mutton chop."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!--Peter Augustus, be on your guard. Eat no more mutton chops\r\nto-night. You are left here in command of these premises--an honourable\r\npost!"\r\n\r\n"Is anybody to stay with me?"\r\n\r\n"As many of the present assemblage as choose.--My lads, how many of you\r\nwill remain here, and how many will go a little way with me and Mr.\r\nMoore on the Stilbro\' road, to meet some men who have been waylaid and\r\nassaulted by frame-breakers?"\r\n\r\nThe small number of three volunteered to go; the rest preferred staying\r\nbehind. As Mr. Moore mounted his horse, the rector asked him in a low\r\nvoice whether he had locked up the mutton chops, so that Peter Augustus\r\ncould not get at them? The manufacturer nodded an affirmative, and the\r\nrescue-party set out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMR. YORKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheerfulness, it would appear, is a matter which depends fully as much\r\non the state of things within as on the state of things without and\r\naround us. I make this trite remark, because I happen to know that\r\nMessrs. Helstone and Moore trotted forth from the mill-yard gates, at\r\nthe head of their very small company, in the best possible spirits. When\r\na ray from a lantern (the three pedestrians of the party carried each\r\none) fell on Mr. Moore\'s face, you could see an unusual, because a\r\nlively, spark dancing in his eyes, and a new-found vivacity mantling on\r\nhis dark physiognomy; and when the rector\'s visage was illuminated, his\r\nhard features were revealed all agrin and ashine with glee. Yet a\r\ndrizzling night, a somewhat perilous expedition, you would think were\r\nnot circumstances calculated to enliven those exposed to the wet and\r\nengaged in the adventure. If any member or members of the crew who had\r\nbeen at work on Stilbro\' Moor had caught a view of this party, they\r\nwould have had great pleasure in shooting either of the leaders from\r\nbehind a wall: and the leaders knew this; and the fact is, being both\r\nmen of steely nerves and steady-beating hearts, were elate with the\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nI am aware, reader, and you need not remind me, that it is a dreadful\r\nthing for a parson to be warlike; I am aware that he should be a man of\r\npeace. I have some faint outline of an idea of what a clergyman\'s\r\nmission is amongst mankind, and I remember distinctly whose servant he\r\nis, whose message he delivers, whose example he should follow; yet, with\r\nall this, if you are a parson-hater, you need not expect me to go along\r\nwith you every step of your dismal, downward-tending, unchristian road;\r\nyou need not expect me to join in your deep anathemas, at once so narrow\r\nand so sweeping, in your poisonous rancour, so intense and so absurd,\r\nagainst "the cloth;" to lift up my eyes and hands with a Supplehough,\r\nor to inflate my lungs with a Barraclough, in horror and denunciation of\r\nthe diabolical rector of Briarfield.\r\n\r\nHe was not diabolical at all. The evil simply was--he had missed his\r\nvocation. He should have been a soldier, and circumstances had made him\r\na priest. For the rest, he was a conscientious, hard-headed,\r\nhard-handed, brave, stern, implacable, faithful little man; a man almost\r\nwithout sympathy, ungentle, prejudiced, and rigid, but a man true to\r\nprinciple, honourable, sagacious, and sincere. It seems to me, reader,\r\nthat you cannot always cut out men to fit their profession, and that you\r\nought not to curse them because their profession sometimes hangs on them\r\nungracefully. Nor will I curse Helstone, clerical Cossack as he was. Yet\r\nhe _was_ cursed, and by many of his own parishioners, as by others he\r\nwas adored--which is the frequent fate of men who show partiality in\r\nfriendship and bitterness in enmity, who are equally attached to\r\nprinciples and adherent to prejudices.\r\n\r\nHelstone and Moore being both in excellent spirits, and united for the\r\npresent in one cause, you would expect that, as they rode side by side,\r\nthey would converse amicably. Oh no! These two men, of hard, bilious\r\nnatures both, rarely came into contact but they chafed each other\'s\r\nmoods. Their frequent bone of contention was the war. Helstone was a\r\nhigh Tory (there were Tories in those days), and Moore was a bitter\r\nWhig--a Whig, at least, as far as opposition to the war-party was\r\nconcerned, that being the question which affected his own interest; and\r\nonly on that question did he profess any British politics at all. He\r\nliked to infuriate Helstone by declaring his belief in the invincibility\r\nof Bonaparte, by taunting England and Europe with the impotence of their\r\nefforts to withstand him, and by coolly advancing the opinion that it\r\nwas as well to yield to him soon as late, since he must in the end crush\r\nevery antagonist, and reign supreme.\r\n\r\nHelstone could not bear these sentiments. It was only on the\r\nconsideration of Moore being a sort of outcast and alien, and having but\r\nhalf measure of British blood to temper the foreign gall which corroded\r\nhis veins, that he brought himself to listen to them without indulging\r\nthe wish he felt to cane the speaker. Another thing, too, somewhat\r\nallayed his disgust--namely, a fellow-feeling for the dogged tone with\r\nwhich these opinions were asserted, and a respect for the consistency\r\nof Moore\'s crabbed contumacy.\r\n\r\nAs the party turned into the Stilbro\' road, they met what little wind\r\nthere was; the rain dashed in their faces. Moore had been fretting his\r\ncompanion previously, and now, braced up by the raw breeze, and perhaps\r\nirritated by the sharp drizzle, he began to goad him.\r\n\r\n"Does your Peninsular news please you still?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" was the surly demand of the rector.\r\n\r\n"I mean, have you still faith in that Baal of a Lord Wellington?"\r\n\r\n"And what do you mean now?"\r\n\r\n"Do you still believe that this wooden-faced and pebble-hearted idol of\r\nEngland has power to send fire down from heaven to consume the French\r\nholocaust you want to offer up?"\r\n\r\n"I believe Wellington will flog Bonaparte\'s marshals into the sea the\r\nday it pleases him to lift his arm."\r\n\r\n"But, my dear sir, you can\'t be serious in what you say. Bonaparte\'s\r\nmarshals are great men, who act under the guidance of an omnipotent\r\nmaster-spirit. Your Wellington is the most humdrum of commonplace\r\nmartinets, whose slow, mechanical movements are further cramped by an\r\nignorant home government."\r\n\r\n"Wellington is the soul of England. Wellington is the right champion of\r\na good cause, the fit representative of a powerful, a resolute, a\r\nsensible, and an honest nation."\r\n\r\n"Your good cause, as far as I understand it, is simply the restoration\r\nof that filthy, feeble Ferdinand to a throne which he disgraced. Your\r\nfit representative of an honest people is a dull-witted drover, acting\r\nfor a duller-witted farmer; and against these are arrayed victorious\r\nsupremacy and invincible genius."\r\n\r\n"Against legitimacy is arrayed usurpation; against modest,\r\nsingle-minded, righteous, and brave resistance to encroachment is\r\narrayed boastful, double-tongued, selfish, and treacherous ambition to\r\npossess. God defend the right!"\r\n\r\n"God often defends the powerful."\r\n\r\n"What! I suppose the handful of Israelites standing dryshod on the\r\nAsiatic side of the Red Sea was more powerful than the host of the\r\nEgyptians drawn up on the African side? Were they more numerous? Were\r\nthey better appointed? Were they more mighty, in a word--eh? Don\'t\r\nspeak, or you\'ll tell a lie, Moore; you know you will. They were a poor,\r\noverwrought band of bondsmen. Tyrants had oppressed them through four\r\nhundred years; a feeble mixture of women and children diluted their thin\r\nranks; their masters, who roared to follow them through the divided\r\nflood, were a set of pampered Ethiops, about as strong and brutal as the\r\nlions of Libya. They were armed, horsed, and charioted; the poor Hebrew\r\nwanderers were afoot. Few of them, it is likely, had better weapons than\r\ntheir shepherds\' crooks or their masons\' building-tools; their meek and\r\nmighty leader himself had only his rod. But bethink you, Robert Moore,\r\nright was with them; the God of battles was on their side. Crime and the\r\nlost archangel generalled the ranks of Pharaoh, and which triumphed? We\r\nknow that well. \'The Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the\r\nEgyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore\'--yea,\r\n\'the depths covered them, they sank to the bottom as a stone.\' The right\r\nhand of the Lord became glorious in power; the right hand of the Lord\r\ndashed in pieces the enemy!"\r\n\r\n"You are all right; only you forget the true parallel. France is Israel,\r\nand Napoleon is Moses. Europe, with her old overgorged empires and\r\nrotten dynasties, is corrupt Egypt; gallant France is the Twelve Tribes,\r\nand her fresh and vigorous Usurper the Shepherd of Horeb."\r\n\r\n"I scorn to answer you."\r\n\r\nMoore accordingly answered himself--at least, he subjoined to what he\r\nhad just said an additional observation in a lower voice.\r\n\r\n"Oh, in Italy he was as great as any Moses! He was the right thing\r\nthere, fit to head and organize measures for the regeneration of\r\nnations. It puzzles me to this day how the conqueror of Lodi should have\r\ncondescended to become an emperor, a vulgar, a stupid humbug; and still\r\nmore how a people who had once called themselves republicans should have\r\nsunk again to the grade of mere slaves. I despise France! If England had\r\ngone as far on the march of civilization as France did, she would hardly\r\nhave retreated so shamelessly."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say that besotted imperial France is any worse than\r\nbloody republican France?" demanded Helstone fiercely.\r\n\r\n"I mean to say nothing, but I can think what I please, you know, Mr.\r\nHelstone, both about France and England; and about revolutions, and\r\nregicides, and restorations in general; and about the divine right of\r\nkings, which you often stickle for in your sermons, and the duty of\r\nnon-resistance, and the sanity of war, and----"\r\n\r\nMr. Moore\'s sentence was here cut short by the rapid rolling up of a\r\ngig, and its sudden stoppage in the middle of the road. Both he and the\r\nrector had been too much occupied with their discourse to notice its\r\napproach till it was close upon them.\r\n\r\n"Nah, maister; did th\' wagons hit home?" demanded a voice from the\r\nvehicle.\r\n\r\n"Can that be Joe Scott?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay!" returned another voice; for the gig contained two persons, as\r\nwas seen by the glimmer of its lamp. The men with the lanterns had now\r\nfallen into the rear, or rather, the equestrians of the rescue-party had\r\noutridden the pedestrians. "Ay, Mr. Moore, it\'s Joe Scott. I\'m bringing\r\nhim back to you in a bonny pickle. I fand him on the top of the moor\r\nyonder, him and three others. What will you give me for restoring him to\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Why, my thanks, I believe; for I could better have afforded to lose a\r\nbetter man. That is you, I suppose, Mr. Yorke, by your voice?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, lad, it\'s me. I was coming home from Stilbro\' market, and just as I\r\ngot to the middle of the moor, and was whipping on as swift as the wind\r\n(for these, they say, are not safe times, thanks to a bad government!),\r\nI heard a groan. I pulled up. Some would have whipt on faster; but I\'ve\r\nnaught to fear that I know of. I don\'t believe there\'s a lad in these\r\nparts would harm me--at least, I\'d give them as good as I got if they\r\noffered to do it. I said, \'Is there aught wrong anywhere?\' \'\'Deed is\r\nthere,\' somebody says, speaking out of the ground, like. \'What\'s to do?\r\nBe sharp and tell me,\' I ordered. \'Nobbut four on us ligging in a\r\nditch,\' says Joe, as quiet as could be. I telled \'em more shame to \'em,\r\nand bid them get up and move on, or I\'d lend them a lick of the\r\ngig-whip; for my notion was they were all fresh. \'We\'d ha\' done that an\r\nhour sin\', but we\'re teed wi\' a bit o\' band,\' says Joe. So in a while I\r\ngot down and loosed \'em wi\' my penknife; and Scott would ride wi\' me, to\r\ntell me all how it happened; and t\' others are coming on as fast as\r\ntheir feet will bring them."\r\n\r\n"Well, I am greatly obliged to you, Mr. Yorke."\r\n\r\n"Are you, my lad? You know you\'re not. However, here are the rest\r\napproaching. And here, by the Lord, is another set with lights in their\r\npitchers, like the army of Gideon; and as we\'ve th\' parson wi\',\r\nus--good-evening, Mr. Helstone--we\'se do."\r\n\r\nMr. Helstone returned the salutation of the individual in the gig very\r\nstiffly indeed. That individual proceeded,--\r\n\r\n"We\'re eleven strong men, and there\'s both horses and chariots amang us.\r\nIf we could only fall in wi\' some of these starved ragamuffins of\r\nframe-breakers we could win a grand victory. We could iv\'ry one be a\r\nWellington--that would please ye, Mr. Helstone--and sich paragraphs as\r\nwe could contrive for t\' papers! Briarfield suld be famous. But we\'se\r\nhev a column and a half i\' th\' _Stilbro\' Courier_ ower this job, as it\r\nis, I dare say. I\'se expect no less."\r\n\r\n"And I\'ll promise you no less, Mr. Yorke, for I\'ll write the article\r\nmyself," returned the rector.\r\n\r\n"To be sure--sartainly! And mind ye recommend weel that them \'at brake\r\nt\' bits o\' frames, and teed Joe Scott\'s legs wi\' band, suld be hung\r\nwithout benefit o\' clergy. It\'s a hanging matter, or suld be. No doubt\r\no\' that."\r\n\r\n"If I judged them I\'d give them short shrift!" cried Moore. "But I mean\r\nto let them quite alone this bout, to give them rope enough, certain\r\nthat in the end they will hang themselves."\r\n\r\n"Let them alone, will ye, Moore? Do you promise that?"\r\n\r\n"Promise! No. All I mean to say is, I shall give myself no particular\r\ntrouble to catch them; but if one falls in my way----"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll snap him up, of course. Only you would rather they would do\r\nsomething worse than merely stop a wagon before you reckon with them.\r\nWell, we\'ll say no more on the subject at present. Here we are at my\r\ndoor, gentlemen, and I hope you and the men will step in. You will none\r\nof you be the worse of a little refreshment."\r\n\r\nMoore and Helstone opposed this proposition as unnecessary. It was,\r\nhowever, pressed on them so courteously, and the night, besides, was so\r\ninclement, and the gleam from the muslin-curtained windows of the house\r\nbefore which they had halted looked so inviting, that at length they\r\nyielded. Mr. Yorke, after having alighted from his gig, which he left in\r\ncharge of a man who issued from an outbuilding on his arrival, led the\r\nway in.\r\n\r\nIt will have been remarked that Mr. Yorke varied a little in his\r\nphraseology. Now he spoke broad Yorkshire, and anon he expressed himself\r\nin very pure English. His manner seemed liable to equal alternations. He\r\ncould be polite and affable, and he could be blunt and rough. His\r\nstation then you could not easily determine by his speech and demeanour.\r\nPerhaps the appearance of his residence may decide it.\r\n\r\nThe men he recommended to take the kitchen way, saying that he would\r\n"see them served wi\' summat to taste presently." The gentlemen were\r\nushered in at the front entrance. They found themselves in a matted\r\nhall, lined almost to the ceiling with pictures. Through this they were\r\nconducted to a large parlour, with a magnificent fire in the grate--the\r\nmost cheerful of rooms it appeared as a whole, and when you came to\r\nexamine details, the enlivening effect was not diminished. There was no\r\nsplendour, but there was taste everywhere, unusual taste--the taste, you\r\nwould have said, of a travelled man, a scholar, and a gentleman. A\r\nseries of Italian views decked the walls. Each of these was a specimen\r\nof true art. A connoisseur had selected them; they were genuine and\r\nvaluable. Even by candle-light the bright clear skies, the soft\r\ndistances, with blue air quivering between the eye and the hills, the\r\nfresh tints, and well-massed lights and shadows, charmed the view. The\r\nsubjects were all pastoral, the scenes were all sunny. There was a\r\nguitar and some music on a sofa; there were cameos, beautiful\r\nminiatures; a set of Grecian-looking vases on the mantelpiece; there\r\nwere books well arranged in two elegant bookcases.\r\n\r\nMr. Yorke bade his guests be seated. He then rang for wine. To the\r\nservant who brought it he gave hospitable orders for the refreshment of\r\nthe men in the kitchen. The rector remained standing; he seemed not to\r\nlike his quarters; he would not touch the wine his host offered him.\r\n\r\n"E\'en as you will," remarked Mr. Yorke. "I reckon you\'re thinking of\r\nEastern customs, Mr. Helstone, and you\'ll not eat nor drink under my\r\nroof, feared we suld be forced to be friends; but I am not so particular\r\nor superstitious. You might sup the contents of that decanter, and you\r\nmight give me a bottle of the best in your own cellar, and I\'d hold\r\nmyself free to oppose you at every turn still--in every vestry-meeting\r\nand justice-meeting where we encountered one another."\r\n\r\n"It is just what I should expect of you, Mr. Yorke."\r\n\r\n"Does it agree wi\' ye now, Mr. Helstone, to be riding out after rioters,\r\nof a wet night, at your age?"\r\n\r\n"It always agrees with me to be doing my duty; and in this case my duty\r\nis a thorough pleasure. To hunt down vermin is a noble occupation, fit\r\nfor an archbishop."\r\n\r\n"Fit for ye, at ony rate. But where\'s t\' curate? He\'s happen gone to\r\nvisit some poor body in a sick gird, or he\'s happen hunting down vermin\r\nin another direction."\r\n\r\n"He is doing garrison-duty at Hollow\'s Mill."\r\n\r\n"You left him a sup o\' wine, I hope, Bob" (turning to Mr. Moore), "to\r\nkeep his courage up?"\r\n\r\nHe did not pause for an answer, but continued, quickly, still addressing\r\nMoore, who had thrown himself into an old-fashioned chair by the\r\nfireside--"Move it, Robert! Get up, my lad! That place is mine. Take the\r\nsofa, or three other chairs, if you will, but not this. It belangs to\r\nme, and nob\'dy else."\r\n\r\n"Why are you so particular to that chair, Mr. Yorke?" asked Moore,\r\nlazily vacating the place in obedience to orders.\r\n\r\n"My father war afore me, and that\'s all t\' answer I sall gie thee; and\r\nit\'s as good a reason as Mr. Helstone can give for the main feck o\' his\r\nnotions."\r\n\r\n"Moore, are you ready to go?" inquired the rector.\r\n\r\n"Nay; Robert\'s not ready, or rather, I\'m not ready to part wi\' him. He\'s\r\nan ill lad, and wants correcting."\r\n\r\n"Why, sir? What have I done?"\r\n\r\n"Made thyself enemies on every hand."\r\n\r\n"What do I care for that? What difference does it make to me whether\r\nyour Yorkshire louts hate me or like me?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, there it is. The lad is a mak\' of an alien amang us. His father\r\nwould never have talked i\' that way.--Go back to Antwerp, where you were\r\nborn and bred, mauvaise t\xc3\xaate!"\r\n\r\n"Mauvaise t\xc3\xaate vous-m\xc3\xaame; je ne fais que mon devoir; quant \xc3\xa0 vos\r\nlourdauds de paysans, je m\'en moque!"\r\n\r\n"En ravanche, mon gar\xc3\xa7on, nos lourdauds de paysans se moqueront de toi;\r\nsois en certain," replied Yorke, speaking with nearly as pure a French\r\naccent as G\xc3\xa9rard Moore.\r\n\r\n"C\'est bon! c\'est bon! Et puisque cela m\'est \xc3\xa9gal, que mes amis ne s\'en\r\ninqui\xc3\xa8tent pas."\r\n\r\n"Tes amis! O\xc3\xb9 sont-ils, tes amis?"\r\n\r\n"Je fais \xc3\xa9cho, o\xc3\xb9 sont-ils? et je suis fort aise que l\'\xc3\xa9cho seul y\r\nr\xc3\xa9pond. Au diable les amis! Je me souviens encore du moment o\xc3\xb9 mon p\xc3\xa8re\r\net mes oncles G\xc3\xa9rard appell\xc3\xa8rent autour d\'eux leurs amis, et Dieu sait\r\nsi les amis se sont empress\xc3\xa9s d\'accourir \xc3\xa0 leur secours! Tenez, M.\r\nYorke, ce mot, ami, m\'irrite trop; ne m\'en parlez plus."\r\n\r\n"Comme tu voudras."\r\n\r\nAnd here Mr. Yorke held his peace; and while he sits leaning back in his\r\nthree-cornered carved oak chair, I will snatch my opportunity to sketch\r\nthe portrait of this French-speaking Yorkshire gentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMR. YORKE (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nA Yorkshire gentleman he was, _par excellence_, in every point; about\r\nfifty-five years old, but looking at first sight still older, for his\r\nhair was silver white. His forehead was broad, not high; his face fresh\r\nand hale; the harshness of the north was seen in his features, as it was\r\nheard in his voice; every trait was thoroughly English--not a Norman\r\nline anywhere; it was an inelegant, unclassic, unaristocratic mould of\r\nvisage. Fine people would perhaps have called it vulgar; sensible people\r\nwould have termed it characteristic; shrewd people would have delighted\r\nin it for the pith, sagacity, intelligence, the rude yet real\r\noriginality marked in every lineament, latent in every furrow. But it\r\nwas an indocile, a scornful, and a sarcastic face--the face of a man\r\ndifficult to lead, and impossible to drive. His stature was rather tall,\r\nand he was well made and wiry, and had a stately integrity of port;\r\nthere was not a suspicion of the clown about him anywhere.\r\n\r\nI did not find it easy to sketch Mr. Yorke\'s person, but it is more\r\ndifficult to indicate his mind. If you expect to be treated to a\r\nPerfection, reader, or even to a benevolent, philanthropic old gentleman\r\nin him, you are mistaken. He has spoken with some sense and with some\r\ngood feeling to Mr. Moore, but you are not thence to conclude that he\r\nalways spoke and thought justly and kindly.\r\n\r\nMr. Yorke, in the first place, was without the organ of veneration--a\r\ngreat want, and which throws a man wrong on every point where veneration\r\nis required. Secondly, he was without the organ of comparison--a\r\ndeficiency which strips a man of sympathy; and thirdly, he had too\r\nlittle of the organs of benevolence and ideality, which took the glory\r\nand softness from his nature, and for him diminished those divine\r\nqualities throughout the universe.\r\n\r\nThe want of veneration made him intolerant to those above him--kings and\r\nnobles and priests, dynasties and parliaments and establishments, with\r\nall their doings, most of their enactments, their forms, their rights,\r\ntheir claims, were to him an abomination, all rubbish; he found no use\r\nor pleasure in them, and believed it would be clear gain, and no damage\r\nto the world, if its high places were razed, and their occupants crushed\r\nin the fall. The want of veneration, too, made him dead at heart to the\r\nelectric delight of admiring what is admirable; it dried up a thousand\r\npure sources of enjoyment; it withered a thousand vivid pleasures. He\r\nwas not irreligious, though a member of no sect; but his religion could\r\nnot be that of one who knows how to venerate. He believed in God and\r\nheaven; but his God and heaven were those of a man in whom awe,\r\nimagination, and tenderness lack.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of his powers of comparison made him inconsistent; while he\r\nprofessed some excellent general doctrines of mutual toleration and\r\nforbearance, he cherished towards certain classes a bigoted antipathy.\r\nHe spoke of "parsons" and all who belonged to parsons, of "lords" and\r\nthe appendages of lords, with a harshness, sometimes an insolence, as\r\nunjust as it was insufferable. He could not place himself in the\r\nposition of those he vituperated; he could not compare their errors with\r\ntheir temptations, their defects with their disadvantages; he could not\r\nrealize the effect of such and such circumstances on himself similarly\r\nsituated, and he would often express the most ferocious and tyrannical\r\nwishes regarding those who had acted, as he thought, ferociously and\r\ntyrannically. To judge by his threats, he would have employed arbitrary,\r\neven cruel, means to advance the cause of freedom and equality.\r\nEquality! yes, Mr. Yorke talked about equality, but at heart he was a\r\nproud man--very friendly to his workpeople, very good to all who were\r\nbeneath him, and submitted quietly to be beneath him, but haughty as\r\nBeelzebub to whomsoever the world deemed (for he deemed no man) his\r\nsuperior. Revolt was in his blood: he could not bear control; his\r\nfather, his grandfather before him, could not bear it, and his children\r\nafter him never could.\r\n\r\nThe want of general benevolence made him very impatient of imbecility,\r\nand of all faults which grated on his strong, shrewd nature; it left no\r\ncheck to his cutting sarcasm. As he was not merciful, he would sometimes\r\nwound and wound again, without noticing how much he hurt, or caring how\r\ndeep he thrust.\r\n\r\nAs to the paucity of ideality in his mind, that can scarcely be called a\r\nfault: a fine ear for music, a correct eye for colour and form, left him\r\nthe quality of taste; and who cares for imagination? Who does not think\r\nit a rather dangerous, senseless attribute, akin to weakness, perhaps\r\npartaking of frenzy--a disease rather than a gift of the mind?\r\n\r\nProbably all think it so but those who possess, or fancy they possess,\r\nit. To hear them speak, you would believe that their hearts would be\r\ncold if that elixir did not flow about them, that their eyes would be\r\ndim if that flame did not refine their vision, that they would be lonely\r\nif this strange companion abandoned them. You would suppose that it\r\nimparted some glad hope to spring, some fine charm to summer, some\r\ntranquil joy to autumn, some consolation to winter, which you do not\r\nfeel. An illusion, of course; but the fanatics cling to their dream, and\r\nwould not give it for gold.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Yorke did not possess poetic imagination himself, he considered\r\nit a most superfluous quality in others. Painters and musicians he could\r\ntolerate, and even encourage, because he could relish the results of\r\ntheir art; he could see the charm of a fine picture, and feel the\r\npleasure of good music; but a quiet poet--whatever force struggled,\r\nwhatever fire glowed, in his breast--if he could not have played the man\r\nin the counting-house, of the tradesman in the Piece Hall, might have\r\nlived despised, and died scorned, under the eyes of Hiram Yorke.\r\n\r\nAnd as there are many Hiram Yorkes in the world, it is well that the\r\ntrue poet, quiet externally though he may be, has often a truculent\r\nspirit under his placidity, and is full of shrewdness in his meekness,\r\nand can measure the whole stature of those who look down on him, and\r\ncorrectly ascertain the weight and value of the pursuits they disdain\r\nhim for not having followed. It is happy that he can have his own bliss,\r\nhis own society with his great friend and goddess Nature, quite\r\nindependent of those who find little pleasure in him, and in whom he\r\nfinds no pleasure at all. It is just that while the world and\r\ncircumstances often turn a dark, cold side to him--and properly, too,\r\nbecause he first turns a dark, cold, careless side to them--he should be\r\nable to maintain a festal brightness and cherishing glow in his bosom,\r\nwhich makes all bright and genial for him; while strangers, perhaps,\r\ndeem his existence a Polar winter never gladdened by a sun. The true\r\npoet is not one whit to be pitied, and he is apt to laugh in his sleeve\r\nwhen any misguided sympathizer whines over his wrongs. Even when\r\nutilitarians sit in judgment on him, and pronounce him and his art\r\nuseless, he hears the sentence with such a hard derision, such a broad,\r\ndeep, comprehensive, and merciless contempt of the unhappy Pharisees who\r\npronounce it, that he is rather to be chidden than condoled with. These,\r\nhowever, are not Mr. Yorke\'s reflections, and it is with Mr. Yorke we\r\nhave at present to do.\r\n\r\nI have told you some of his faults, reader: as to his good points, he\r\nwas one of the most honourable and capable men in Yorkshire; even those\r\nwho disliked him were forced to respect him. He was much beloved by the\r\npoor, because he was thoroughly kind and very fatherly to them. To his\r\nworkmen he was considerate and cordial. When he dismissed them from an\r\noccupation, he would try to set them on to something else, or, if that\r\nwas impossible, help them to remove with their families to a district\r\nwhere work might possibly be had. It must also be remarked that if, as\r\nsometimes chanced, any individual amongst his "hands" showed signs of\r\ninsubordination, Yorke--who, like many who abhor being controlled, knew\r\nhow to control with vigour--had the secret of crushing rebellion in the\r\ngerm, of eradicating it like a bad weed, so that it never spread or\r\ndeveloped within the sphere of his authority. Such being the happy state\r\nof his own affairs, he felt himself at liberty to speak with the utmost\r\nseverity of those who were differently situated, to ascribe whatever was\r\nunpleasant in their position entirely to their own fault, to sever\r\nhimself from the masters, and advocate freely the cause of the\r\noperatives.\r\n\r\nMr. Yorke\'s family was the first and oldest in the district; and he,\r\nthough not the wealthiest, was one of the most influential men. His\r\neducation had been good. In his youth, before the French Revolution, he\r\nhad travelled on the Continent. He was an adept in the French and\r\nItalian languages. During a two years\' sojourn in Italy he had collected\r\nmany good paintings and tasteful rarities, with which his residence was\r\nnow adorned. His manners, when he liked, were those of a finished\r\ngentleman of the old school; his conversation, when he was disposed to\r\nplease, was singularly interesting and original; and if he usually\r\nexpressed himself in the Yorkshire dialect, it was because he chose to\r\ndo so, preferring his native Doric to a more refined vocabulary, "A\r\nYorkshire burr," he affirmed, "was as much better than a cockney\'s lisp\r\nas a bull\'s bellow than a raton\'s squeak."\r\n\r\nMr. Yorke knew every one, and was known by every one, for miles round;\r\nyet his intimate acquaintances were very few. Himself thoroughly\r\noriginal, he had no taste for what was ordinary: a racy, rough\r\ncharacter, high or low, ever found acceptance with him; a refined,\r\ninsipid personage, however exalted in station, was his aversion. He\r\nwould spend an hour any time in talking freely with a shrewd workman of\r\nhis own, or with some queer, sagacious old woman amongst his cottagers,\r\nwhen he would have grudged a moment to a commonplace fine gentleman or\r\nto the most fashionable and elegant, if frivolous, lady. His preferences\r\non these points he carried to an extreme, forgetting that there may be\r\namiable and even admirable characters amongst those who cannot be\r\noriginal. Yet he made exceptions to his own rule. There was a certain\r\norder of mind, plain, ingenuous, neglecting refinement, almost devoid of\r\nintellectuality, and quite incapable of appreciating what was\r\nintellectual in him, but which, at the same time, never felt disgust at\r\nhis rudeness, was not easily wounded by his sarcasm, did not closely\r\nanalyze his sayings, doings, or opinions, with which he was peculiarly\r\nat ease, and, consequently, which he peculiarly preferred. He was lord\r\namongst such characters. They, while submitting implicitly to his\r\ninfluence, never acknowledged, because they never reflected on, his\r\nsuperiority; they were quite tractable, therefore, without running the\r\nsmallest danger of being servile; and their unthinking, easy, artless\r\ninsensibility was as acceptable, because as convenient, to Mr. Yorke as\r\nthat of the chair he sat on, or of the floor he trod.\r\n\r\nIt will have been observed that he was not quite uncordial with Mr.\r\nMoore. He had two or three reasons for entertaining a faint partiality\r\nto that gentleman. It may sound odd, but the first of these was that\r\nMoore spoke English with a foreign, and French with a perfectly pure,\r\naccent; and that his dark, thin face, with its fine though rather wasted\r\nlines, had a most anti-British and anti-Yorkshire look. These points\r\nseem frivolous, unlikely to influence a character like Yorke\'s; but the\r\nfact is they recalled old, perhaps pleasurable, associations--they\r\nbrought back his travelling, his youthful days. He had seen, amidst\r\nItalian cities and scenes, faces like Moore\'s; he had heard, in Parisian\r\ncaf\xc3\xa9s and theatres, voices like his. He was young then, and when he\r\nlooked at and listened to the alien, he seemed young again.\r\n\r\nSecondly, he had known Moore\'s father, and had had dealings with him.\r\nThat was a more substantial, though by no means a more agreeable tie;\r\nfor as his firm had been connected with Moore\'s in business, it had\r\nalso, in some measure, been implicated in its losses.\r\n\r\nThirdly, he had found Robert himself a sharp man of business. He saw\r\nreason to anticipate that he would, in the end, by one means or another,\r\nmake money; and he respected both his resolution and acuteness--perhaps,\r\nalso, his hardness. A fourth circumstance which drew them together was\r\nthat of Mr. Yorke being one of the guardians of the minor on whose\r\nestate Hollow\'s Mill was situated; consequently Moore, in the course of\r\nhis alterations and improvements, had frequent occasion to consult him.\r\n\r\nAs to the other guest now present in Mr. Yorke\'s parlour, Mr. Helstone,\r\nbetween him and his host there existed a double antipathy--the antipathy\r\nof nature and that of circumstances. The free-thinker hated the\r\nformalist; the lover of liberty detested the disciplinarian. Besides, it\r\nwas said that in former years they had been rival suitors of the same\r\nlady.\r\n\r\nMr. Yorke, as a general rule, was, when young, noted for his preference\r\nof sprightly and dashing women: a showy shape and air, a lively wit, a\r\nready tongue, chiefly seemed to attract him. He never, however, proposed\r\nto any of these brilliant belles whose society he sought; and all at\r\nonce he seriously fell in love with and eagerly wooed a girl who\r\npresented a complete contrast to those he had hitherto noticed--a girl\r\nwith the face of a Madonna; a girl of living marble--stillness\r\npersonified. No matter that, when he spoke to her, she only answered him\r\nin monosyllables; no matter that his sighs seemed unheard, that his\r\nglances were unreturned, that she never responded to his opinions,\r\nrarely smiled at his jests, paid him no respect and no attention; no\r\nmatter that she seemed the opposite of everything feminine he had ever\r\nin his whole life been known to admire. For him Mary Cave was perfect,\r\nbecause somehow, for some reason--no doubt he had a reason--he loved\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMr. Helstone, at that time curate of Briarfield, loved Mary too--or, at\r\nany rate, he fancied her. Several others admired her, for she was\r\nbeautiful as a monumental angel; but the clergyman was preferred for his\r\noffice\'s sake--that office probably investing him with some of the\r\nillusion necessary to allure to the commission of matrimony, and which\r\nMiss Cave did not find in any of the young wool-staplers, her other\r\nadorers. Mr. Helstone neither had, nor professed to have, Mr. Yorke\'s\r\nabsorbing passion for her. He had none of the humble reverence which\r\nseemed to subdue most of her suitors; he saw her more as she really was\r\nthan the rest did. He was, consequently, more master of her and himself.\r\nShe accepted him at the first offer, and they were married.\r\n\r\nNature never intended Mr. Helstone to make a very good husband,\r\nespecially to a quiet wife. He thought so long as a woman was silent\r\nnothing ailed her, and she wanted nothing. If she did not complain of\r\nsolitude, solitude, however continued, could not be irksome to her. If\r\nshe did not talk and put herself forward, express a partiality for this,\r\nan aversion to that, she had no partialities or aversions, and it was\r\nuseless to consult her tastes. He made no pretence of comprehending\r\nwomen, or comparing them with men. They were a different, probably a\r\nvery inferior, order of existence. A wife could not be her husband\'s\r\ncompanion, much less his confidante, much less his stay. _His_ wife,\r\nafter a year or two, was of no great importance to him in any shape; and\r\nwhen she one day, as he thought, suddenly--for he had scarcely noticed\r\nher decline--but, as others thought, gradually, took her leave of him\r\nand of life, and there was only a still, beautiful-featured mould of\r\nclay left, cold and white, in the conjugal couch, he felt his\r\nbereavement--who shall say how little? Yet, perhaps, more than he seemed\r\nto feel it; for he was not a man from whom grief easily wrung tears.\r\n\r\nHis dry-eyed and sober mourning scandalized an old housekeeper, and\r\nlikewise a female attendant, who had waited upon Mrs. Helstone in her\r\nsickness, and who, perhaps, had had opportunities of learning more of\r\nthe deceased lady\'s nature, of her capacity for feeling and loving, than\r\nher husband knew. They gossiped together over the corpse, related\r\nanecdotes, with embellishments of her lingering decline, and its real or\r\nsupposed cause. In short, they worked each other up to some indignation\r\nagainst the austere little man, who sat examining papers in an adjoining\r\nroom, unconscious of what opprobrium he was the object.\r\n\r\nMrs. Helstone was hardly under the sod when rumours began to be rife in\r\nthe neighbourhood that she had died of a broken heart. These magnified\r\nquickly into reports of hard usage, and, finally, details of harsh\r\ntreatment on the part of her husband--reports grossly untrue, but not\r\nthe less eagerly received on that account. Mr. Yorke heard them, partly\r\nbelieved them. Already, of course, he had no friendly feeling to his\r\nsuccessful rival. Though himself a married man now, and united to a\r\nwoman who seemed a complete contrast to Mary Cave in all respects, he\r\ncould not forget the great disappointment of his life; and when he heard\r\nthat what would have been so precious to him had been neglected, perhaps\r\nabused, by another, he conceived for that other a rooted and bitter\r\nanimosity.\r\n\r\nOf the nature and strength of this animosity Mr. Helstone was but half\r\naware. He neither knew how much Yorke had loved Mary Cave, what he had\r\nfelt on losing her, nor was he conscious of the calumnies concerning his\r\ntreatment of her, familiar to every ear in the neighbourhood but his\r\nown. He believed political and religious differences alone separated him\r\nand Mr. Yorke. Had he known how the case really stood, he would hardly\r\nhave been induced by any persuasion to cross his former rival\'s\r\nthreshold.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Yorke did not resume his lecture of Robert Moore. The conversation\r\nere long recommenced in a more general form, though still in a somewhat\r\ndisputative tone. The unquiet state of the country, the various\r\ndepredations lately committed on mill-property in the district, supplied\r\nabundant matter for disagreement, especially as each of the three\r\ngentlemen present differed more or less in his views on these subjects.\r\nMr. Helstone thought the masters aggrieved, the workpeople unreasonable;\r\nhe condemned sweepingly the widespread spirit of disaffection against\r\nconstituted authorities, the growing indisposition to bear with patience\r\nevils he regarded as inevitable. The cures he prescribed were vigorous\r\ngovernment interference, strict magisterial vigilance; when necessary,\r\nprompt military coercion.\r\n\r\nMr. Yorke wished to know whether this interference, vigilance, and\r\ncoercion would feed those who were hungry, give work to those who wanted\r\nwork, and whom no man would hire. He scouted the idea of inevitable\r\nevils. He said public patience was a camel, on whose back the last atom\r\nthat could be borne had already been laid, and that resistance was now a\r\nduty; the widespread spirit of disaffection against constituted\r\nauthorities he regarded as the most promising sign of the times; the\r\nmasters, he allowed, were truly aggrieved, but their main grievances had\r\nbeen heaped on them by a "corrupt, base, and bloody" government (these\r\nwere Mr. Yorke\'s epithets). Madmen like Pitt, demons like Castlereagh,\r\nmischievous idiots like Perceval, were the tyrants, the curses of the\r\ncountry, the destroyers of her trade. It was their infatuated\r\nperseverance in an unjustifiable, a hopeless, a ruinous war, which had\r\nbrought the nation to its present pass. It was their monstrously\r\noppressive taxation, it was the infamous "Orders in Council"--the\r\noriginators of which deserved impeachment and the scaffold, if ever\r\npublic men did--that hung a millstone about England\'s neck.\r\n\r\n"But where was the use of talking?" he demanded. "What chance was there\r\nof reason being heard in a land that was king-ridden, priest-ridden,\r\npeer-ridden; where a lunatic was the nominal monarch, an unprincipled\r\ndebauchee the real ruler; where such an insult to common sense as\r\nhereditary legislators was tolerated; where such a humbug as a bench of\r\nbishops, such an arrogant abuse as a pampered, persecuting established\r\nchurch was endured and venerated; where a standing army was maintained,\r\nand a host of lazy parsons and their pauper families were kept on the\r\nfat of the land?"\r\n\r\nMr. Helstone, rising up and putting on his shovel-hat, observed in\r\nreply, "that in the course of his life he had met with two or three\r\ninstances where sentiments of this sort had been very bravely maintained\r\nso long as health, strength, and worldly prosperity had been the allies\r\nof him who professed them; but there came a time," he said, "to all men,\r\n\'when the keepers of the house should tremble; when they should be\r\nafraid of that which is high, and fear should be in the way;\' and that\r\ntime was the test of the advocate of anarchy and rebellion, the enemy of\r\nreligion and order. Ere now," he affirmed, "he had been called upon to\r\nread those prayers our church has provided for the sick by the miserable\r\ndying-bed of one of her most rancorous foes; he had seen such a one\r\nstricken with remorse, solicitous to discover a place for repentance,\r\nand unable to find any, though he sought it carefully with tears. He\r\nmust forewarn Mr. Yorke that blasphemy against God and the king was a\r\ndeadly sin, and that there was such a thing as \'judgment to come.\'"\r\n\r\nMr. Yorke "believed fully that there was such a thing as judgment to\r\ncome. If it were otherwise, it would be difficult to imagine how all the\r\nscoundrels who seemed triumphant in this world, who broke innocent\r\nhearts with impunity, abused unmerited privileges, were a scandal to\r\nhonourable callings, took the bread out of the mouths of the poor,\r\nbrowbeat the humble, and truckled meanly to the rich and proud, were to\r\nbe properly paid off in such coin as they had earned. But," he added,\r\n"whenever he got low-spirited about such-like goings-on, and their\r\nseeming success in this mucky lump of a planet, he just reached down t\'\r\nowd book" (pointing to a great Bible in the bookcase), "opened it like\r\nat a chance, and he was sure to light of a verse blazing wi\' a blue\r\nbrimstone low that set all straight. He knew," he said, "where some folk\r\nwar bound for, just as weel as if an angel wi\' great white wings had\r\ncome in ower t\' door-stone and told him."\r\n\r\n"Sir," said Mr. Helstone, collecting all his dignity--"sir, the great\r\nknowledge of man is to know himself, and the bourne whither his own\r\nsteps tend."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay. You\'ll recollect, Mr. Helstone, that Ignorance was carried away\r\nfrom the very gates of heaven, borne through the air, and thrust in at a\r\ndoor in the side of the hill which led down to hell."\r\n\r\n"Nor have I forgotten, Mr. Yorke, that Vain-Confidence, not seeing the\r\nway before him, fell into a deep pit, which was on purpose there made by\r\nthe prince of the grounds, to catch vainglorious fools withal, and was\r\ndashed to pieces with his fall."\r\n\r\n"Now," interposed Mr. Moore, who had hitherto sat a silent but amused\r\nspectator of this worldly combat, and whose indifference to the party\r\npolitics of the day, as well as to the gossip of the neighbourhood, made\r\nhim an impartial, if apathetic, judge of the merits of such an\r\nencounter, "you have both sufficiently blackballed each other, and\r\nproved how cordially you detest each other, and how wicked you think\r\neach other. For my part, my hate is still running in such a strong\r\ncurrent against the fellows who have broken my frames that I have none\r\nto spare for my private acquaintance, and still less for such a vague\r\nthing as a sect or a government. But really, gentlemen, you both seem\r\nvery bad by your own showing--worse than ever I suspected you to be.--I\r\ndare not stay all night with a rebel and blasphemer like you, Yorke; and\r\nI hardly dare ride home with a cruel and tyrannical ecclesiastic like\r\nMr. Helstone."\r\n\r\n"I am going, however, Mr. Moore," said the rector sternly. "Come with me\r\nor not, as you please."\r\n\r\n"Nay, he shall not have the choice; he _shall_ go with you," responded\r\nYorke. "It\'s midnight, and past; and I\'ll have nob\'dy staying up i\' my\r\nhouse any longer. Ye mun all go."\r\n\r\nHe rang the bell.\r\n\r\n"Deb," said he to the servant who answered it, "clear them folk out o\'\r\nt\' kitchen, and lock t\' doors, and be off to bed.--Here is your way,\r\ngentlemen," he continued to his guests; and, lighting them through the\r\npassage, he fairly put them out at his front door.\r\n\r\nThey met their party hurrying out pell-mell by the back way. Their\r\nhorses stood at the gate; they mounted, and rode off, Moore laughing at\r\ntheir abrupt dismissal, Helstone deeply indignant thereat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nHOLLOW\'S COTTAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoore\'s good spirits were still with him when he rose next morning. He\r\nand Joe Scott had both spent the night in the mill, availing themselves\r\nof certain sleeping accommodations producible from recesses in the front\r\nand back counting-houses. The master, always an early riser, was up\r\nsomewhat sooner even than usual. He awoke his man by singing a French\r\nsong as he made his toilet.\r\n\r\n"Ye\'re not custen dahn, then, maister?" cried Joe.\r\n\r\n"Not a stiver, mon gar\xc3\xa7on--which means, my lad. Get up, and we\'ll take a\r\nturn through the mill before the hands come in, and I\'ll explain my\r\nfuture plans. We\'ll have the machinery yet, Joseph. You never heard of\r\nBruce, perhaps?"\r\n\r\n"And th\' arrand (spider)? Yes, but I hev. I\'ve read th\' history o\'\r\nScotland, and happen knaw as mich on\'t as ye; and I understand ye to\r\nmean to say ye\'ll persevere."\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"Is there mony o\' your mak\' i\' your country?" inquired Joe, as he folded\r\nup his temporary bed, and put it away.\r\n\r\n"In my country! Which is my country?"\r\n\r\n"Why, France--isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Not it, indeed! The circumstance of the French having seized Antwerp,\r\nwhere I was born, does not make me a Frenchman."\r\n\r\n"Holland, then?"\r\n\r\n"I am not a Dutchman. Now you are confounding Antwerp with Amsterdam."\r\n\r\n"Flanders?"\r\n\r\n"I scorn the insinuation, Joe! I a Flamand! Have I a Flemish face--the\r\nclumsy nose standing out, the mean forehead falling back, the pale blue\r\neyes \'\xc3\xa0 fleur de t\xc3\xaate\'? Am I all body and no legs, like a Flamand? But\r\nyou don\'t know what they are like, those Netherlanders. Joe, I\'m an\r\nAnversois. My mother was an Anversoise, though she came of French\r\nlineage, which is the reason I speak French."\r\n\r\n"But your father war Yorkshire, which maks ye a bit Yorkshire too; and\r\nonybody may see ye\'re akin to us, ye\'re so keen o\' making brass, and\r\ngetting forrards."\r\n\r\n"Joe, you\'re an impudent dog; but I\'ve always been accustomed to a\r\nboorish sort of insolence from my youth up. The \'classe ouvri\xc3\xa8re\'--that\r\nis, the working people in Belgium--bear themselves brutally towards\r\ntheir employers; and by _brutally_, Joe, I mean _brutalement_--which,\r\nperhaps, when properly translated, should be _roughly_."\r\n\r\n"We allus speak our minds i\' this country; and them young parsons and\r\ngrand folk fro\' London is shocked at wer \'incivility;\' and we like weel\r\nenough to gi\'e \'em summat to be shocked at, \'cause it\'s sport to us to\r\nwatch \'em turn up the whites o\' their een, and spreed out their bits o\'\r\nhands, like as they\'re flayed wi\' bogards, and then to hear \'em say,\r\nnipping off their words short like, \'Dear! dear! Whet seveges! How very\r\ncorse!\'"\r\n\r\n"You _are_ savages, Joe. You don\'t suppose you\'re civilized, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Middling, middling, maister. I reckon \'at us manufacturing lads i\' th\'\r\nnorth is a deal more intelligent, and knaws a deal more nor th\' farming\r\nfolk i\' th\' south. Trade sharpens wer wits; and them that\'s mechanics\r\nlike me is forced to think. Ye know, what wi\' looking after machinery\r\nand sich like, I\'ve getten into that way that when I see an effect, I\r\nlook straight out for a cause, and I oft lig hold on\'t to purpose; and\r\nthen I like reading, and I\'m curious to knaw what them that reckons to\r\ngovern us aims to do for us and wi\' us. And there\'s many \'cuter nor me;\r\nthere\'s many a one amang them greasy chaps \'at smells o\' oil, and amang\r\nthem dyers wi\' blue and black skins, that has a long head, and that can\r\ntell what a fooil of a law is, as well as ye or old Yorke, and a deal\r\nbetter nor soft uns like Christopher Sykes o\' Whinbury, and greet\r\nhectoring nowts like yond\' Irish Peter, Helstone\'s curate."\r\n\r\n"You think yourself a clever fellow, I know, Scott."\r\n\r\n"Ay! I\'m fairish. I can tell cheese fro\' chalk, and I\'m varry weel aware\r\nthat I\'ve improved sich opportunities as I have had, a deal better nor\r\nsome \'at reckons to be aboon me; but there\'s thousands i\' Yorkshire\r\nthat\'s as good as me, and a two-three that\'s better."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a great man--you\'re a sublime fellow; but you\'re a prig, a\r\nconceited noodle with it all, Joe! You need not to think that because\r\nyou\'ve picked up a little knowledge of practical mathematics, and\r\nbecause you have found some scantling of the elements of chemistry at\r\nthe bottom of a dyeing vat, that therefore you\'re a neglected man of\r\nscience; and you need not to suppose that because the course of trade\r\ndoes not always run smooth, and you, and such as you, are sometimes\r\nshort of work and of bread, that therefore your class are martyrs, and\r\nthat the whole form of government under which you live is wrong. And,\r\nmoreover, you need not for a moment to insinuate that the virtues have\r\ntaken refuge in cottages and wholly abandoned slated houses. Let me tell\r\nyou, I particularly abominate that sort of trash, because I know so well\r\nthat human nature is human nature everywhere, whether under tile or\r\nthatch, and that in every specimen of human nature that breathes, vice\r\nand virtue are ever found blended, in smaller or greater proportions,\r\nand that the proportion is not determined by station. I have seen\r\nvillains who were rich, and I have seen villains who were poor, and I\r\nhave seen villains who were neither rich nor poor, but who had realized\r\nAgar\'s wish, and lived in fair and modest competency. The clock is going\r\nto strike six. Away with you, Joe, and ring the mill bell."\r\n\r\nIt was now the middle of the month of February; by six o\'clock therefore\r\ndawn was just beginning to steal on night, to penetrate with a pale ray\r\nits brown obscurity, and give a demi-translucence to its opaque shadows.\r\nPale enough that ray was on this particular morning: no colour tinged\r\nthe east, no flush warmed it. To see what a heavy lid day slowly lifted,\r\nwhat a wan glance she flung along the hills, you would have thought the\r\nsun\'s fire quenched in last night\'s floods. The breath of this morning\r\nwas chill as its aspect; a raw wind stirred the mass of night-cloud, and\r\nshowed, as it slowly rose, leaving a colourless, silver-gleaming ring\r\nall round the horizon, not blue sky, but a stratum of paler vapour\r\nbeyond. It had ceased to rain, but the earth was sodden, and the pools\r\nand rivulets were full.\r\n\r\nThe mill-windows were alight, the bell still rung loud, and now the\r\nlittle children came running in, in too great a hurry, let us hope, to\r\nfeel very much nipped by the inclement air; and indeed, by contrast,\r\nperhaps the morning appeared rather favourable to them than otherwise,\r\nfor they had often come to their work that winter through snow-storms,\r\nthrough heavy rain, through hard frost.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore stood at the entrance to watch them pass. He counted them as\r\nthey went by. To those who came rather late he said a word of reprimand,\r\nwhich was a little more sharply repeated by Joe Scott when the lingerers\r\nreached the work-rooms. Neither master nor overlooker spoke savagely.\r\nThey were not savage men either of them, though it appeared both were\r\nrigid, for they fined a delinquent who came considerably too late. Mr.\r\nMoore made him pay his penny down ere he entered, and informed him that\r\nthe next repetition of the fault would cost him twopence.\r\n\r\nRules, no doubt, are necessary in such cases, and coarse and cruel\r\nmasters will make coarse and cruel rules, which, at the time we treat of\r\nat least, they used sometimes to enforce tyrannically; but though I\r\ndescribe imperfect characters (every character in this book will be\r\nfound to be more or less imperfect, my pen refusing to draw anything in\r\nthe model line), I have not undertaken to handle degraded or utterly\r\ninfamous ones. Child-torturers, slave masters and drivers, I consign to\r\nthe hands of jailers. The novelist may be excused from sullying his page\r\nwith the record of their deeds.\r\n\r\nInstead, then, of harrowing up my reader\'s soul and delighting his organ\r\nof wonder with effective descriptions of stripes and scourgings, I am\r\nhappy to be able to inform him that neither Mr. Moore nor his overlooker\r\never struck a child in their mill. Joe had, indeed, once very severely\r\nflogged a son of his own for telling a lie and persisting in it; but,\r\nlike his employer, he was too phlegmatic, too calm, as well as too\r\nreasonable a man, to make corporal chastisement other than the exception\r\nto his treatment of the young.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore haunted his mill, his mill-yard, his dye-house, and his\r\nwarehouse till the sickly dawn strengthened into day. The sun even\r\nrose--at least a white disc, clear, tintless, and almost chill-looking\r\nas ice, peeped over the dark crest of a hill, changed to silver the\r\nlivid edge of the cloud above it, and looked solemnly down the whole\r\nlength of the den, or narrow dale, to whose strait bounds we are at\r\npresent limited. It was eight o\'clock; the mill lights were all\r\nextinguished; the signal was given for breakfast; the children, released\r\nfor half an hour from toil, betook themselves to the little tin cans\r\nwhich held their coffee, and to the small baskets which contained their\r\nallowance of bread. Let us hope they have enough to eat; it would be a\r\npity were it otherwise.\r\n\r\nAnd now at last Mr. Moore quitted the mill-yard, and bent his steps to\r\nhis dwelling-house. It was only a short distance from the factory, but\r\nthe hedge and high bank on each side of the lane which conducted to it\r\nseemed to give it something of the appearance and feeling of seclusion.\r\nIt was a small, whitewashed place, with a green porch over the door;\r\nscanty brown stalks showed in the garden soil near this porch, and\r\nlikewise beneath the windows--stalks budless and flowerless now, but\r\ngiving dim prediction of trained and blooming creepers for summer days.\r\nA grass plat and borders fronted the cottage. The borders presented only\r\nblack mould yet, except where, in sheltered nooks, the first shoots of\r\nsnowdrop or crocus peeped, green as emerald, from the earth. The spring\r\nwas late; it had been a severe and prolonged winter; the last deep snow\r\nhad but just disappeared before yesterday\'s rains; on the hills, indeed,\r\nwhite remnants of it yet gleamed, flecking the hollows and crowning the\r\npeaks; the lawn was not verdant, but bleached, as was the grass on the\r\nbank, and under the hedge in the lane. Three trees, gracefully grouped,\r\nrose beside the cottage. They were not lofty, but having no rivals near,\r\nthey looked well and imposing where they grew. Such was Mr. Moore\'s\r\nhome--a snug nest for content and contemplation, but one within which\r\nthe wings of action and ambition could not long lie folded.\r\n\r\nIts air of modest comfort seemed to possess no particular attraction for\r\nits owner. Instead of entering the house at once he fetched a spade from\r\na little shed and began to work in the garden. For about a quarter of an\r\nhour he dug on uninterrupted. At length, however, a window opened, and a\r\nfemale voice called to him,--\r\n\r\n"Eh, bien! Tu ne d\xc3\xa9je\xc3\xbbnes pas ce matin?"\r\n\r\nThe answer, and the rest of the conversation, was in French; but as this\r\nis an English book, I shall translate it into English.\r\n\r\n"Is breakfast ready, Hortense?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly; it has been ready half an hour."\r\n\r\n"Then I am ready too. I have a canine hunger."\r\n\r\nHe threw down his spade, and entered the house. The narrow passage\r\nconducted him to a small parlour, where a breakfast of coffee and bread\r\nand butter, with the somewhat un-English accompaniment of stewed pears,\r\nwas spread on the table. Over these viands presided the lady who had\r\nspoken from the window. I must describe her before I go any farther.\r\n\r\nShe seemed a little older than Mr. Moore--perhaps she was thirty-five,\r\ntall, and proportionately stout; she had very black hair, for the\r\npresent twisted up in curl-papers, a high colour in her cheeks, a small\r\nnose, a pair of little black eyes. The lower part of her face was large\r\nin proportion to the upper; her forehead was small and rather\r\ncorrugated; she had a fretful though not an ill-natured expression of\r\ncountenance; there was something in her whole appearance one felt\r\ninclined to be half provoked with and half amused at. The strangest\r\npoint was her dress--a stuff petticoat and a striped cotton camisole.\r\nThe petticoat was short, displaying well a pair of feet and ankles which\r\nleft much to be desired in the article of symmetry.\r\n\r\nYou will think I have depicted a remarkable slattern, reader. Not at\r\nall. Hortense Moore (she was Mr. Moore\'s sister) was a very orderly,\r\neconomical person. The petticoat, camisole, and curl-papers were her\r\nmorning costume, in which, of forenoons, she had always been accustomed\r\nto "go her household ways" in her own country. She did not choose to\r\nadopt English fashions because she was obliged to live in England; she\r\nadhered to her old Belgian modes, quite satisfied that there was a merit\r\nin so doing.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle had an excellent opinion of herself--an opinion not wholly\r\nundeserved, for she possessed some good and sterling qualities; but she\r\nrather over-estimated the kind and degree of these qualities, and quite\r\nleft out of the account sundry little defects which accompanied them.\r\nYou could never have persuaded her that she was a prejudiced and\r\nnarrow-minded person, that she was too susceptible on the subject of her\r\nown dignity and importance, and too apt to take offence about trifles;\r\nyet all this was true. However, where her claims to distinction were not\r\nopposed, and where her prejudices were not offended, she could be kind\r\nand friendly enough. To her two brothers (for there was another G\xc3\xa9rard\r\nMoore besides Robert) she was very much attached. As the sole remaining\r\nrepresentatives of their decayed family, the persons of both were almost\r\nsacred in her eyes. Of Louis, however, she knew less than of Robert. He\r\nhad been sent to England when a mere boy, and had received his education\r\nat an English school. His education not being such as to adapt him for\r\ntrade, perhaps, too, his natural bent not inclining him to mercantile\r\npursuits, he had, when the blight of hereditary prospects rendered it\r\nnecessary for him to push his own fortune, adopted the very arduous and\r\nvery modest career of a teacher. He had been usher in a school, and was\r\nsaid now to be tutor in a private family. Hortense, when she mentioned\r\nLouis, described him as having what she called "des moyens," but as\r\nbeing too backward and quiet. Her praise of Robert was in a different\r\nstrain, less qualified: she was very proud of him; she regarded him as\r\nthe greatest man in Europe; all he said and did was remarkable in her\r\neyes, and she expected others to behold him from the same point of view;\r\nnothing could be more irrational, monstrous, and infamous than\r\nopposition from any quarter to Robert, unless it were opposition to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, as soon as the said Robert was seated at the\r\nbreakfast-table, and she had helped him to a portion of stewed pears,\r\nand cut him a good-sized Belgian tartine, she began to pour out a flood\r\nof amazement and horror at the transaction of last night, the\r\ndestruction of the frames.\r\n\r\n"Quelle id\xc3\xa9e! to destroy them. Quelle action honteuse! On voyait bien\r\nque les ouvriers de ce pays \xc3\xa9taient \xc3\xa0 la fois betes et m\xc3\xa9chants. C\'\xc3\xa9tait\r\nabsolument comme les domestiques anglais, les servantes surtout: rien\r\nd\'insupportable comme cette Sara, par exemple!"\r\n\r\n"She looks clean and industrious," Mr. Moore remarked.\r\n\r\n"Looks! I don\'t know how she looks, and I do not say that she is\r\naltogether dirty or idle, mais elle est d\'une insolence! She disputed\r\nwith me a quarter of an hour yesterday about the cooking of the beef;\r\nshe said I boiled it to rags, that English people would never be able to\r\neat such a dish as our bouilli, that the bouillon was no better than\r\ngreasy warm water, and as to the choucroute, she affirms she cannot\r\ntouch it! That barrel we have in the cellar--delightfully prepared by my\r\nown hands--she termed a tub of hog-wash, which means food for pigs. I am\r\nharassed with the girl, and yet I cannot part with her lest I should get\r\na worse. You are in the same position with your workmen, pauvre cher\r\nfr\xc3\xa8re!"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid you are not very happy in England, Hortense."\r\n\r\n"It is my duty to be happy where you are, brother; but otherwise there\r\nare certainly a thousand things which make me regret our native town.\r\nAll the world here appears to me ill-bred (mal-\xc3\xa9lev\xc3\xa9). I find my habits\r\nconsidered ridiculous. If a girl out of your mill chances to come into\r\nthe kitchen and find me in my jupon and camisole preparing dinner (for\r\nyou know I cannot trust Sarah to cook a single dish), she sneers. If I\r\naccept an invitation out to tea, which I have done once or twice, I\r\nperceive I am put quite into the background; I have not that attention\r\npaid me which decidedly is my due. Of what an excellent family are the\r\nG\xc3\xa9rards, as we know, and the Moores also! They have a right to claim a\r\ncertain respect, and to feel wounded when it is withheld from them. In\r\nAntwerp I was always treated with distinction; here, one would think\r\nthat when I open my lips in company I speak English with a ridiculous\r\naccent, whereas I am quite assured that I pronounce it perfectly."\r\n\r\n"Hortense, in Antwerp we were known rich; in England we were never known\r\nbut poor."\r\n\r\n"Precisely, and thus mercenary are mankind. Again, dear brother, last\r\nSunday, if you recollect, was very wet; accordingly I went to church in\r\nmy neat black sabots, objects one would not indeed wear in a fashionable\r\ncity, but which in the country I have ever been accustomed to use for\r\nwalking in dirty roads. Believe me, as I paced up the aisle, composed\r\nand tranquil, as I am always, four ladies, and as many gentlemen,\r\nlaughed and hid their faces behind their prayer-books."\r\n\r\n"Well, well! don\'t put on the sabots again. I told you before I thought\r\nthey were not quite the thing for this country."\r\n\r\n"But, brother, they are not common sabots, such as the peasantry wear. I\r\ntell you, they are sabots noirs, tr\xc3\xa8s propres, tr\xc3\xa8s convenables. At Mons\r\nand Leuze--cities not very far removed from the elegant capital of\r\nBrussels--it is very seldom that the respectable people wear anything\r\nelse for walking in winter. Let any one try to wade the mud of the\r\nFlemish chauss\xc3\xa9es in a pair of Paris brodequins, on m\'en dirait des\r\nnouvelles!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind Mons and Leuze and the Flemish chauss\xc3\xa9es; do at Rome as the\r\nRomans do. And as to the camisole and jupon, I am not quite sure about\r\nthem either. I never see an English lady dressed in such garments. Ask\r\nCaroline Helstone."\r\n\r\n"Caroline! _I_ ask Caroline? _I_ consult her about my dress? It is _she_\r\nwho on all points should consult _me_. She is a child."\r\n\r\n"She is eighteen, or at least seventeen--old enough to know all about\r\ngowns, petticoats, and chaussures."\r\n\r\n"Do not spoil Caroline, I entreat you, brother. Do not make her of more\r\nconsequence than she ought to be. At present she is modest and\r\nunassuming: let us keep her so."\r\n\r\n"With all my heart. Is she coming this morning?"\r\n\r\n"She will come at ten, as usual, to take her French lesson."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t find that she sneers at you, do you?"\r\n\r\n"She does not. She appreciates me better than any one else here; but\r\nthen she has more intimate opportunities of knowing me. She sees that I\r\nhave education, intelligence, manner, principles--all, in short, which\r\nbelongs to a person well born and well bred."\r\n\r\n"Are you at all fond of her?"\r\n\r\n"For _fond_ I cannot say. I am not one who is prone to take violent\r\nfancies, and, consequently, my friendship is the more to be depended on.\r\nI have a regard for her as my relative; her position also inspires\r\ninterest, and her conduct as my pupil has hitherto been such as rather\r\nto enhance than diminish the attachment that springs from other causes."\r\n\r\n"She behaves pretty well at lessons?"\r\n\r\n"To _me_ she behaves very well; but you are conscious, brother, that I\r\nhave a manner calculated to repel over-familiarity, to win esteem, and\r\nto command respect. Yet, possessed of penetration, I perceive clearly\r\nthat Caroline is not perfect, that there is much to be desired in her."\r\n\r\n"Give me a last cup of coffee, and while I am drinking it amuse me with\r\nan account of her faults."\r\n\r\n"Dear brother, I am happy to see you eat your breakfast with relish,\r\nafter the fatiguing night you have passed. Caroline, then, is defective;\r\nbut with my forming hand and almost motherly care she may improve. There\r\nis about her an occasional something--a reserve, I think--which I do not\r\nquite like, because it is not sufficiently girlish and submissive; and\r\nthere are glimpses of an unsettled hurry in her nature, which put me\r\nout. Yet she is usually most tranquil, too dejected and thoughtful\r\nindeed sometimes. In time, I doubt not, I shall make her uniformly\r\nsedate and decorous, without being unaccountably pensive. I ever\r\ndisapprove what is not intelligible."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand your account in the least. What do you mean by\r\n\'unsettled hurries,\' for instance?"\r\n\r\n"An example will, perhaps, be the most satisfactory explanation. I\r\nsometimes, you are aware, make her read French poetry by way of\r\npractice in pronunciation. She has in the course of her lessons gone\r\nthrough much of Corneille and Racine, in a very steady, sober spirit,\r\nsuch as I approve. Occasionally she showed, indeed, a degree of languor\r\nin the perusal of those esteemed authors, partaking rather of apathy\r\nthan sobriety; and apathy is what I cannot tolerate in those who have\r\nthe benefit of my instructions--besides, one should not be apathetic in\r\nstudying standard works. The other day I put into her hands a volume of\r\nshort fugitive pieces. I sent her to the window to learn one by heart,\r\nand when I looked up I saw her turning the leaves over impatiently, and\r\ncurling her lip, absolutely with scorn, as she surveyed the little poems\r\ncursorily. I chid her. \'Ma cousine,\' said she, \'tout cela m\'ennuie \xc3\xa0 la\r\nmort.\' I told her this was improper language. \'Dieu!\' she exclaimed, \'il\r\nn\'y a donc pas deux lignes de po\xc3\xabsie dans toute la litt\xc3\xa9rature\r\nfran\xc3\xa7aise?\' I inquired what she meant. She begged my pardon with proper\r\nsubmission. Ere long she was still. I saw her smiling to herself over\r\nthe book. She began to learn assiduously. In half an hour she came and\r\nstood before me, presented the volume, folded her hands, as I always\r\nrequire her to do, and commenced the repetition of that short thing by\r\nCh\xc3\xa9nier, \'La Jeune Captive.\' If you had heard the manner in which she\r\nwent through this, and in which she uttered a few incoherent comments\r\nwhen she had done, you would have known what I meant by the phrase\r\n\'unsettled hurry.\' One would have thought Ch\xc3\xa9nier was more moving than\r\nall Racine and all Corneille. You, brother, who have so much sagacity,\r\nwill discern that this disproportionate preference argues an\r\nill-regulated mind; but she is fortunate in her preceptress. I will give\r\nher a system, a method of thought, a set of opinions; I will give her\r\nthe perfect control and guidance of her feelings."\r\n\r\n"Be sure you do, Hortense. Here she comes. That was her shadow passed\r\nthe window, I believe."\r\n\r\n"Ah! truly. She is too early--half an hour before her time.--My child,\r\nwhat brings you here before I have breakfasted?"\r\n\r\nThis question was addressed to an individual who now entered the room, a\r\nyoung girl, wrapped in a winter mantle, the folds of which were gathered\r\nwith some grace round an apparently slender figure.\r\n\r\n"I came in haste to see how you were, Hortense, and how Robert was too.\r\nI was sure you would be both grieved by what happened last night. I did\r\nnot hear till this morning. My uncle told me at breakfast."\r\n\r\n"Ah! it is unspeakable. You sympathize with us? Your uncle sympathizes\r\nwith us?"\r\n\r\n"My uncle is very angry--but he was with Robert, I believe, was he\r\nnot?--Did he not go with you to Stilbro\' Moor?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, we set out in very martial style, Caroline; but the prisoners we\r\nwent to rescue met us half-way."\r\n\r\n"Of course nobody was hurt?"\r\n\r\n"Why, no; only Joe Scott\'s wrists were a little galled with being\r\npinioned too tightly behind his back."\r\n\r\n"You were not there? You were not with the wagons when they were\r\nattacked?"\r\n\r\n"No. One seldom has the fortune to be present at occurrences at which\r\none would particularly wish to assist."\r\n\r\n"Where are you going this morning? I saw Murgatroyd saddling your horse\r\nin the yard."\r\n\r\n"To Whinbury. It is market day."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Yorke is going too. I met him in his gig. Come home with him."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Two are better than one, and nobody dislikes Mr. Yorke--at least, poor\r\npeople do not dislike him."\r\n\r\n"Therefore he would be a protection to me, who am hated?"\r\n\r\n"Who are _misunderstood_. That, probably, is the word. Shall you be\r\nlate?--Will he be late, Cousin Hortense?"\r\n\r\n"It is too probable. He has often much business to transact at Whinbury.\r\nHave you brought your exercise-book, child?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.--What time will you return, Robert?"\r\n\r\n"I generally return at seven. Do you wish me to be at home earlier?"\r\n\r\n"Try rather to be back by six. It is not absolutely dark at six now, but\r\nby seven daylight is quite gone."\r\n\r\n"And what danger is to be apprehended, Caroline, when daylight _is_\r\ngone? What peril do you conceive comes as the companion of darkness for\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"I am not sure that I can define my fears, but we all have a certain\r\nanxiety at present about our friends. My uncle calls these times\r\ndangerous. He says, too, that mill-owners are unpopular."\r\n\r\n"And I am one of the most unpopular? Is not that the fact? You are\r\nreluctant to speak out plainly, but at heart you think me liable to\r\nPearson\'s fate, who was shot at--not, indeed, from behind a hedge, but\r\nin his own house, through his staircase window, as he was going to bed."\r\n\r\n"Anne Pearson showed me the bullet in the chamber-door," remarked\r\nCaroline gravely, as she folded her mantle and arranged it and her muff\r\non a side-table. "You know," she continued, "there is a hedge all the\r\nway along the road from here to Whinbury, and there are the Fieldhead\r\nplantations to pass; but you will be back by six--or before?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly he will," affirmed Hortense. "And now, my child, prepare your\r\nlessons for repetition, while I put the peas to soak for the pur\xc3\xa9e at\r\ndinner."\r\n\r\nWith this direction she left the room.\r\n\r\n"You suspect I have many enemies, then, Caroline," said Mr. Moore, "and\r\ndoubtless you know me to be destitute of friends?"\r\n\r\n"Not destitute, Robert. There is your sister, your brother Louis, whom I\r\nhave never seen; there is Mr. Yorke, and there is my uncle--besides, of\r\ncourse, many more."\r\n\r\nRobert smiled. "You would be puzzled to name your \'many more,\'" said he.\r\n"But show me your exercise-book. What extreme pains you take with the\r\nwriting! My sister, I suppose, exacts this care. She wants to form you\r\nin all things after the model of a Flemish school-girl. What life are\r\nyou destined for, Caroline? What will you do with your French, drawing,\r\nand other accomplishments, when they are acquired?"\r\n\r\n"You may well say, when they are acquired; for, as you are aware, till\r\nHortense began to teach me, I knew precious little. As to the life I am\r\ndestined for, I cannot tell. I suppose to keep my uncle\'s house\r\ntill----" She hesitated.\r\n\r\n"Till what? Till he dies?"\r\n\r\n"No. How harsh to say that! I never think of his dying. He is only\r\nfifty-five. But till--in short, till events offer other occupations for\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"A remarkably vague prospect! Are you content with it?"\r\n\r\n"I used to be, formerly. Children, you know, have little reflection, or\r\nrather their reflections run on ideal themes. There are moments _now_\r\nwhen I am not quite satisfied."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"I am making no money--earning nothing."\r\n\r\n"You come to the point, Lina. You too, then, wish to make money?"\r\n\r\n"I do. I should like an occupation; and if I were a boy, it would not be\r\nso difficult to find one. I see such an easy, pleasant way of learning a\r\nbusiness, and making my way in life."\r\n\r\n"Go on. Let us hear what way."\r\n\r\n"I could be apprenticed to your trade--the cloth-trade. I could learn it\r\nof you, as we are distant relations. I would do the counting-house work,\r\nkeep the books, and write the letters, while you went to market. I know\r\nyou greatly desire to be rich, in order to pay your father\'s debts;\r\nperhaps I could help you to get rich."\r\n\r\n"Help _me_? You should think of yourself."\r\n\r\n"I do think of myself; but must one for ever think only of oneself?"\r\n\r\n"Of whom else do I think? Of whom else _dare_ I think? The poor ought to\r\nhave no large sympathies; it is their duty to be narrow."\r\n\r\n"No, Robert----"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Caroline. Poverty is necessarily selfish, contracted, grovelling,\r\nanxious. Now and then a poor man\'s heart, when certain beams and dews\r\nvisit it, may smell like the budding vegetation in yonder garden on this\r\nspring day, may feel ripe to evolve in foliage, perhaps blossom; but he\r\nmust not encourage the pleasant impulse; he must invoke Prudence to\r\ncheck it, with that frosty breath of hers, which is as nipping as any\r\nnorth wind."\r\n\r\n"No cottage would be happy then."\r\n\r\n"When I speak of poverty, I do not so much mean the natural, habitual\r\npoverty of the working-man, as the embarrassed penury of the man in\r\ndebt. My grub-worm is always a straitened, struggling, care-worn\r\ntradesman."\r\n\r\n"Cherish hope, not anxiety. Certain ideas have become too fixed in your\r\nmind. It may be presumptuous to say it, but I have the impression that\r\nthere is something wrong in your notions of the best means of attaining\r\nhappiness, as there is in----" Second hesitation.\r\n\r\n"I am all ear, Caroline."\r\n\r\n"In (courage! let me speak the truth)--in your manner--mind, I say only\r\n_manner_--to these Yorkshire workpeople."\r\n\r\n"You have often wanted to tell me that, have you not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; often--very often."\r\n\r\n"The faults of my manner are, I think, only negative. I am not proud.\r\nWhat has a man in my position to be proud of? I am only taciturn,\r\nphlegmatic, and joyless."\r\n\r\n"As if your living cloth-dressers were all machines like your frames and\r\nshears. In your own house you seem different."\r\n\r\n"To those of my own house I am no alien, which I am to these English\r\nclowns. I might act the benevolent with them, but acting is not my\r\n_forte_. I find them irrational, perverse; they hinder me when I long to\r\nhurry forward. In treating them justly I fulfil my whole duty towards\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t expect them to love you, of course?"\r\n\r\n"Nor wish it."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said the monitress, shaking her head and heaving a deep sigh. With\r\nthis ejaculation, indicative that she perceived a screw to be loose\r\nsomewhere, but that it was out of her reach to set it right, she bent\r\nover her grammar, and sought the rule and exercise for the day.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I am not an affectionate man, Caroline. The attachment of a\r\nvery few suffices me."\r\n\r\n"If you please, Robert, will you mend me a pen or two before you go?"\r\n\r\n"First let me rule your book, for you always contrive to draw the lines\r\naslant. There now. And now for the pens. You like a fine one, I think?"\r\n\r\n"Such as you generally make for me and Hortense; not your own broad\r\npoints."\r\n\r\n"If I were of Louis\'s calling I might stay at home and dedicate this\r\nmorning to you and your studies, whereas I must spend it in Skyes\'s\r\nwool-warehouse."\r\n\r\n"You will be making money."\r\n\r\n"More likely losing it."\r\n\r\nAs he finished mending the pens, a horse, saddled and bridled, was\r\nbrought up to the garden-gate.\r\n\r\n"There, Fred is ready for me; I must go. I\'ll take one look to see what\r\nthe spring has done in the south border, too, first."\r\n\r\nHe quitted the room, and went out into the garden ground behind the\r\nmill. A sweet fringe of young verdure and opening flowers--snowdrop,\r\ncrocus, even primrose--bloomed in the sunshine under the hot wall of the\r\nfactory. Moore plucked here and there a blossom and leaf, till he had\r\ncollected a little bouquet. He returned to the parlour, pilfered a\r\nthread of silk from his sister\'s work-basket, tied the flowers, and laid\r\nthem on Caroline\'s desk.\r\n\r\n"Now, good-morning."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Robert. It is pretty; it looks, as it lies there, like\r\nsparkles of sunshine and blue sky. Good-morning."\r\n\r\nHe went to the door, stopped, opened his lips as if to speak, said\r\nnothing, and moved on. He passed through the wicket, and mounted his\r\nhorse. In a second he had flung himself from his saddle again,\r\ntransferred the reins to Murgatroyd, and re-entered the cottage.\r\n\r\n"I forgot my gloves," he said, appearing to take something from the\r\nside-table; then, as an impromptu thought, he remarked, "You have no\r\nbinding engagement at home perhaps, Caroline?"\r\n\r\n"I never have. Some children\'s socks, which Mrs. Ramsden has ordered, to\r\nknit for the Jew\'s basket; but they will keep."\r\n\r\n"Jew\'s basket be--sold! Never was utensil better named. Anything more\r\nJewish than it--its contents and their prices--cannot be conceived. But\r\nI see something, a very tiny curl, at the corners of your lip, which\r\ntells me that you know its merits as well as I do. Forget the Jew\'s\r\nbasket, then, and spend the day here as a change. Your uncle won\'t break\r\nhis heart at your absence?"\r\n\r\nShe smiled. "No."\r\n\r\n"The old Cossack! I dare say not," muttered Moore.\r\n\r\n"Then stay and dine with Hortense; she will be glad of your company. I\r\nshall return in good time. We will have a little reading in the evening.\r\nThe moon rises at half-past eight, and I will walk up to the rectory\r\nwith you at nine. Do you agree?"\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head, and her eyes lit up.\r\n\r\nMoore lingered yet two minutes. He bent over Caroline\'s desk and glanced\r\nat her grammar, he fingered her pen, he lifted her bouquet and played\r\nwith it; his horse stamped impatient; Fred Murgatroyd hemmed and coughed\r\nat the gate, as if he wondered what in the world his master was doing.\r\n"Good-morning," again said Moore, and finally vanished.\r\n\r\nHortense, coming in ten minutes after, found, to her surprise, that\r\nCaroline had not yet commenced her exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCORIOLANUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Moore had that morning a somewhat absent-minded pupil.\r\nCaroline forgot, again and again, the explanations which were given to\r\nher. However, she still bore with unclouded mood the chidings her\r\ninattention brought upon her. Sitting in the sunshine near the window,\r\nshe seemed to receive with its warmth a kind influence, which made her\r\nboth happy and good. Thus disposed, she looked her best, and her best\r\nwas a pleasing vision.\r\n\r\nTo her had not been denied the gift of beauty. It was not absolutely\r\nnecessary to know her in order to like her; she was fair enough to\r\nplease, even at the first view. Her shape suited her age: it was\r\ngirlish, light, and pliant; every curve was neat, every limb\r\nproportionate; her face was expressive and gentle; her eyes were\r\nhandsome, and gifted at times with a winning beam that stole into the\r\nheart, with a language that spoke softly to the affections. Her mouth\r\nwas very pretty; she had a delicate skin, and a fine flow of brown hair,\r\nwhich she knew how to arrange with taste; curls became her, and she\r\npossessed them in picturesque profusion. Her style of dress announced\r\ntaste in the wearer--very unobtrusive in fashion, far from costly in\r\nmaterial, but suitable in colour to the fair complexion with which it\r\ncontrasted, and in make to the slight form which it draped. Her present\r\nwinter garb was of merino--the same soft shade of brown as her hair; the\r\nlittle collar round her neck lay over a pink ribbon, and was fastened\r\nwith a pink knot. She wore no other decoration.\r\n\r\nSo much for Caroline Helstone\'s appearance. As to her character or\r\nintellect, if she had any, they must speak for themselves in due time.\r\n\r\nHer connections are soon explained. She was the child of parents\r\nseparated soon after her birth, in consequence of disagreement of\r\ndisposition. Her mother was the half-sister of Mr. Moore\'s father; thus,\r\nthough there was no mixture of blood, she was, in a distant sense, the\r\ncousin of Robert, Louis, and Hortense. Her father was the brother of Mr.\r\nHelstone--a man of the character friends desire not to recall, after\r\ndeath has once settled all earthly accounts. He had rendered his wife\r\nunhappy. The reports which were known to be true concerning him had\r\ngiven an air of probability to those which were falsely circulated\r\nrespecting his better-principled brother. Caroline had never known her\r\nmother, as she was taken from her in infancy, and had not since seen\r\nher; her father died comparatively young, and her uncle, the rector, had\r\nfor some years been her sole guardian. He was not, as we are aware, much\r\nadapted, either by nature or habits, to have the charge of a young girl.\r\nHe had taken little trouble about her education; probably he would have\r\ntaken none if she, finding herself neglected, had not grown anxious on\r\nher own account, and asked, every now and then, for a little attention,\r\nand for the means of acquiring such amount of knowledge as could not be\r\ndispensed with. Still, she had a depressing feeling that she was\r\ninferior, that her attainments were fewer than were usually possessed by\r\ngirls of her age and station; and very glad was she to avail herself of\r\nthe kind offer made by her cousin Hortense, soon after the arrival of\r\nthe latter at Hollow\'s Mill, to teach her French and fine needle-work.\r\nMdlle. Moore, for her part, delighted in the task, because it gave her\r\nimportance; she liked to lord it a little over a docile yet quick pupil.\r\nShe took Caroline precisely at her own estimate, as an\r\nirregularly-taught, even ignorant girl; and when she found that she made\r\nrapid and eager progress, it was to no talent, no application, in the\r\nscholar she ascribed the improvement, but entirely to her own superior\r\nmethod of teaching. When she found that Caroline, unskilled in routine,\r\nhad a knowledge of her own, desultory but varied, the discovery caused\r\nher no surprise, for she still imagined that from her conversation had\r\nthe girl unawares gleaned these treasures. She thought it even when\r\nforced to feel that her pupil knew much on subjects whereof she knew\r\nlittle. The idea was not logical, but Hortense had perfect faith in it.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle, who prided herself on possessing "un esprit positif," and\r\non entertaining a decided preference for dry studies, kept her young\r\ncousin to the same as closely as she could. She worked her unrelentingly\r\nat the grammar of the French language, assigning her, as the most\r\nimproving exercise she could devise, interminable "analyses logiques."\r\nThese "analyses" were by no means a source of particular pleasure to\r\nCaroline; she thought she could have learned French just as well without\r\nthem, and grudged excessively the time spent in pondering over\r\n"propositions, principales, et incidents;" in deciding the "incidente\r\ndeterminative," and the "incidente applicative;" in examining whether\r\nthe proposition was "pleine," "elliptique," or "implicite." Sometimes\r\nshe lost herself in the maze, and when so lost she would, now and then\r\n(while Hortense was rummaging her drawers upstairs--an unaccountable\r\noccupation in which she spent a large portion of each day, arranging,\r\ndisarranging, rearranging, and counter-arranging), carry her book to\r\nRobert in the counting-house, and get the rough place made smooth by his\r\naid. Mr. Moore possessed a clear, tranquil brain of his own. Almost as\r\nsoon as he looked at Caroline\'s little difficulties they seemed to\r\ndissolve beneath his eye. In two minutes he would explain all, in two\r\nwords give the key to the puzzle. She thought if Hortense could only\r\nteach like him, how much faster she might learn! Repaying him by an\r\nadmiring and grateful smile, rather shed at his feet than lifted to his\r\nface, she would leave the mill reluctantly to go back to the cottage,\r\nand then, while she completed the exercise, or worked out the sum (for\r\nMdlle. Moore taught her arithmetic too), she would wish nature had made\r\nher a boy instead of a girl, that she might ask Robert to let her be his\r\nclerk, and sit with him in the counting-house, instead of sitting with\r\nHortense in the parlour.\r\n\r\nOccasionally--but this happened very rarely--she spent the evening at\r\nHollow\'s Cottage. Sometimes during these visits Moore was away attending\r\na market; sometimes he was gone to Mr. Yorke\'s; often he was engaged\r\nwith a male visitor in another room; but sometimes, too, he was at home,\r\ndisengaged, free to talk with Caroline. When this was the case, the\r\nevening hours passed on wings of light; they were gone before they were\r\ncounted. There was no room in England so pleasant as that small parlour\r\nwhen the three cousins occupied it. Hortense, when she was not teaching,\r\nor scolding, or cooking, was far from ill-humoured; it was her custom to\r\nrelax towards evening, and to be kind to her young English kinswoman.\r\nThere was a means, too, of rendering her delightful, by inducing her to\r\ntake her guitar and sing and play. She then became quite good-natured.\r\nAnd as she played with skill, and had a well-toned voice, it was not\r\ndisagreeable to listen to her. It would have been absolutely agreeable,\r\nexcept that her formal and self-important character modulated her\r\nstrains, as it impressed her manners and moulded her countenance.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore, released from the business yoke, was, if not lively himself,\r\na willing spectator of Caroline\'s liveliness, a complacent listener to\r\nher talk, a ready respondent to her questions. He was something\r\nagreeable to sit near, to hover round, to address and look at. Sometimes\r\nhe was better than this--almost animated, quite gentle and friendly.\r\n\r\nThe drawback was that by the next morning he was sure to be frozen up\r\nagain; and however much he seemed, in his quiet way, to enjoy these\r\nsocial evenings, he rarely contrived their recurrence. This circumstance\r\npuzzled the inexperienced head of his cousin. "If I had a means of\r\nhappiness at my command," she thought, "I would employ that means often.\r\nI would keep it bright with use, and not let it lie for weeks aside,\r\ntill it gets rusty."\r\n\r\nYet she was careful not to put in practice her own theory. Much as she\r\nliked an evening visit to the cottage, she never paid one unasked.\r\nOften, indeed, when pressed by Hortense to come, she would refuse,\r\nbecause Robert did not second, or but slightly seconded the request.\r\nThis morning was the first time he had ever, of his own unprompted will,\r\ngiven her an invitation; and then he had spoken so kindly that in\r\nhearing him she had received a sense of happiness sufficient to keep her\r\nglad for the whole day.\r\n\r\nThe morning passed as usual. Mademoiselle, ever breathlessly busy, spent\r\nit in bustling from kitchen to parlour, now scolding Sarah, now looking\r\nover Caroline\'s exercise or hearing her repetition-lesson. However\r\nfaultlessly these tasks were achieved, she never commended: it was a\r\nmaxim with her that praise is inconsistent with a teacher\'s dignity, and\r\nthat blame, in more or less unqualified measure, is indispensable to it.\r\nShe thought incessant reprimand, severe or slight, quite necessary to\r\nthe maintenance of her authority; and if no possible error was to be\r\nfound in the lesson, it was the pupil\'s carriage, or air, or dress, or\r\nmien, which required correction.\r\n\r\nThe usual affray took place about the dinner, which meal, when Sarah at\r\nlast brought it into the room, she almost flung upon the table, with a\r\nlook that expressed quite plainly, "I never dished such stuff i\' my life\r\nafore; it\'s not fit for dogs." Notwithstanding Sarah\'s scorn, it was a\r\nsavoury repast enough. The soup was a sort of pur\xc3\xa9e of dried peas, which\r\nmademoiselle had prepared amidst bitter lamentations that in this\r\ndesolate country of England no haricot beans were to be had. Then came a\r\ndish of meat--nature unknown, but supposed to be\r\nmiscellaneous--singularly chopped up with crumbs of bread, seasoned\r\nuniquely though not unpleasantly, and baked in a mould--a queer but by\r\nno means unpalatable dish. Greens, oddly bruised, formed the\r\naccompanying vegetable; and a p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9 of fruit, conserved after a recipe\r\ndevised by Madame G\xc3\xa9rard Moore\'s "grand\'m\xc3\xa8re," and from the taste of\r\nwhich it appeared probable that "m\xc3\xa9lasse" had been substituted for\r\nsugar, completed the dinner.\r\n\r\nCaroline had no objection to this Belgian cookery--indeed she rather\r\nliked it for a change; and it was well she did so, for had she evinced\r\nany disrelish thereof, such manifestation would have injured her in\r\nmademoiselle\'s good graces for ever; a positive crime might have been\r\nmore easily pardoned than a symptom of distaste for the foreign\r\ncomestibles.\r\n\r\nSoon after dinner Caroline coaxed her governess-cousin upstairs to\r\ndress. This man\xc5\x93uvre required management. To have hinted that the\r\njupon, camisole, and curl-papers were odious objects, or indeed other\r\nthan quite meritorious points, would have been a felony. Any premature\r\nattempt to urge their disappearance was therefore unwise, and would be\r\nlikely to issue in the persevering wear of them during the whole day.\r\nCarefully avoiding rocks and quicksands, however, the pupil, on pretence\r\nof requiring a change of scene, contrived to get the teacher aloft; and,\r\nonce in the bedroom, she persuaded her that it was not worth while\r\nreturning thither, and that she might as well make her toilet now; and\r\nwhile mademoiselle delivered a solemn homily on her own surpassing merit\r\nin disregarding all frivolities of fashion, Caroline denuded her of the\r\ncamisole, invested her with a decent gown, arranged her collar, hair,\r\netc., and made her quite presentable. But Hortense would put the\r\nfinishing touches herself, and these finishing touches consisted in a\r\nthick handkerchief tied round the throat, and a large, servant-like\r\nblack apron, which spoiled everything. On no account would mademoiselle\r\nhave appeared in her own house without the thick handkerchief and the\r\nvoluminous apron. The first was a positive matter of morality--it was\r\nquite improper not to wear a fichu; the second was the ensign of a good\r\nhousewife--she appeared to think that by means of it she somehow\r\neffected a large saving in her brother\'s income. She had, with her own\r\nhands, made and presented to Caroline similar equipments; and the only\r\nserious quarrel they had ever had, and which still left a soreness in\r\nthe elder cousin\'s soul, had arisen from the refusal of the younger one\r\nto accept of and profit by these elegant presents.\r\n\r\n"I wear a high dress and a collar," said Caroline, "and I should feel\r\nsuffocated with a handkerchief in addition; and my short aprons do quite\r\nas well as that very long one. I would rather make no change."\r\n\r\nYet Hortense, by dint of perseverance, would probably have compelled her\r\nto make a change, had not Mr. Moore chanced to overhear a dispute on the\r\nsubject, and decided that Caroline\'s little aprons would suffice, and\r\nthat, in his opinion, as she was still but a child, she might for the\r\npresent dispense with the fichu, especially as her curls were long, and\r\nalmost touched her shoulders.\r\n\r\nThere was no appeal against Robert\'s opinion, therefore his sister was\r\ncompelled to yield; but she disapproved entirely of the piquant neatness\r\nof Caroline\'s costume, and the ladylike grace of her appearance.\r\nSomething more solid and homely she would have considered "beaucoup plus\r\nconvenable."\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was devoted to sewing. Mademoiselle, like most Belgian\r\nladies, was specially skilful with her needle. She by no means thought\r\nit waste of time to devote unnumbered hours to fine embroidery,\r\nsight-destroying lace-work, marvellous netting and knitting, and, above\r\nall, to most elaborate stocking-mending. She would give a day to the\r\nmending of two holes in a stocking any time, and think her "mission"\r\nnobly fulfilled when she had accomplished it. It was another of\r\nCaroline\'s troubles to be condemned to learn this foreign style of\r\ndarning, which was done stitch by stitch, so as exactly to imitate the\r\nfabric of the stocking itself--a wearifu\' process, but considered by\r\nHortense G\xc3\xa9rard, and by her ancestresses before her for long generations\r\nback, as one of the first "duties of a woman." She herself had had a\r\nneedle, cotton, and a fearfully torn stocking put into her hand while\r\nshe yet wore a child\'s coif on her little black head; her "hauts faits"\r\nin the darning line had been exhibited to company ere she was six years\r\nold; and when she first discovered that Caroline was profoundly ignorant\r\nof this most essential of attainments, she could have wept with pity\r\nover her miserably-neglected youth.\r\n\r\nNo time did she lose in seeking up a hopeless pair of hose, of which the\r\nheels were entirely gone, and in setting the ignorant English girl to\r\nrepair the deficiency. This task had been commenced two years ago, and\r\nCaroline had the stockings in her work-bag yet. She did a few rows every\r\nday, by way of penance for the expiation of her sins. They were a\r\ngrievous burden to her; she would much have liked to put them in the\r\nfire; and once Mr. Moore, who had observed her sitting and sighing over\r\nthem, had proposed a private incremation in the counting-house; but to\r\nthis proposal Caroline knew it would have been impolitic to accede--the\r\nresult could only be a fresh pair of hose, probably in worse condition.\r\nShe adhered, therefore, to the ills she knew.\r\n\r\nAll the afternoon the two ladies sat and sewed, till the eyes and\r\nfingers, and even the spirits of one of them, were weary. The sky since\r\ndinner had darkened; it had begun to rain again, to pour fast. Secret\r\nfears began to steal on Caroline that Robert would be persuaded by Mr.\r\nSykes or Mr. Yorke to remain at Whinbury till it cleared, and of that\r\nthere appeared no present chance. Five o\'clock struck, and time stole\r\non; still the clouds streamed. A sighing wind whispered in the\r\nroof-trees of the cottage; day seemed already closing; the parlour fire\r\nshed on the clear hearth a glow ruddy as at twilight.\r\n\r\n"It will not be fair till the moon rises," pronounced Mademoiselle\r\nMoore, "consequently I feel assured that my brother will not return till\r\nthen. Indeed I should be sorry if he did. We will have coffee. It would\r\nbe vain to wait for him."\r\n\r\n"I am tired. May I leave my work now, cousin?"\r\n\r\n"You may, since it grows too dark to see to do it well. Fold it up; put\r\nit carefully in your bag; then step into the kitchen and desire Sarah to\r\nbring in the go\xc3\xbbter, or tea, as you call it."\r\n\r\n"But it has not yet struck six. He may still come."\r\n\r\n"He will not, I tell you. I can calculate his movements. I understand my\r\nbrother."\r\n\r\nSuspense is irksome, disappointment bitter. All the world has, some\r\ntime or other, felt that. Caroline, obedient to orders, passed into the\r\nkitchen. Sarah was making a dress for herself at the table.\r\n\r\n"You are to bring in coffee," said the young lady in a spiritless tone;\r\nand then she leaned her arm and head against the kitchen mantelpiece,\r\nand hung listlessly over the fire.\r\n\r\n"How low you seem, miss! But it\'s all because your cousin keeps you so\r\nclose to work. It\'s a shame!"\r\n\r\n"Nothing of the kind, Sarah," was the brief reply.\r\n\r\n"Oh! but I know it is. You\'re fit to cry just this minute, for nothing\r\nelse but because you\'ve sat still the whole day. It would make a kitten\r\ndull to be mewed up so."\r\n\r\n"Sarah, does your master often come home early from market when it is\r\nwet?"\r\n\r\n"Never, hardly; but just to-day, for some reason, he has made a\r\ndifference."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"He is come. I am certain I saw Murgatroyd lead his horse into the yard\r\nby the back-way, when I went to get some water at the pump five minutes\r\nsince. He was in the counting-house with Joe Scott, I believe."\r\n\r\n"You are mistaken."\r\n\r\n"What should I be mistaken for? I know his horse surely?"\r\n\r\n"But you did not see himself?"\r\n\r\n"I heard him speak, though. He was saying something to Joe Scott about\r\nhaving settled all concerning ways and means, and that there would be a\r\nnew set of frames in the mill before another week passed, and that this\r\ntime he would get four soldiers from Stilbro\' barracks to guard the\r\nwagon."\r\n\r\n"Sarah, are you making a gown?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Is it a handsome one?"\r\n\r\n"Beautiful! Get the coffee ready. I\'ll finish cutting out that sleeve\r\nfor you, and I\'ll give you some trimming for it. I have some narrow\r\nsatin ribbon of a colour that will just match it."\r\n\r\n"You\'re very kind, miss."\r\n\r\n"Be quick; there\'s a good girl. But first put your master\'s shoes on the\r\nhearth: he will take his boots off when he comes in. I hear him; he is\r\ncoming."\r\n\r\n"Miss, you are cutting the stuff wrong."\r\n\r\n"So I am; but it is only a snip. There is no harm done."\r\n\r\nThe kitchen door opened; Mr. Moore entered, very wet and cold. Caroline\r\nhalf turned from her dressmaking occupation, but renewed it for a\r\nmoment, as if to gain a minute\'s time for some purpose. Bent over the\r\ndress, her face was hidden; there was an attempt to settle her features\r\nand veil their expression, which failed. When she at last met Mr. Moore,\r\nher countenance beamed.\r\n\r\n"We had ceased to expect you. They asserted you would not come," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"But I promised to return soon. _You_ expected me, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"No, Robert; I dared not when it rained so fast. And you are wet and\r\nchilled. Change everything. If you took cold, I should--we should blame\r\nourselves in some measure."\r\n\r\n"I am not wet through: my riding-coat is waterproof. Dry shoes are all I\r\nrequire. There--the fire is pleasant after facing the cold wind and rain\r\nfor a few miles."\r\n\r\nHe stood on the kitchen hearth; Caroline stood beside him. Mr. Moore,\r\nwhile enjoying the genial glow, kept his eyes directed towards the\r\nglittering brasses on the shelf above. Chancing for an instant to look\r\ndown, his glance rested on an uplifted face, flushed, smiling, happy,\r\nshaded with silky curls, lit with fine eyes. Sarah was gone into the\r\nparlour with the tray; a lecture from her mistress detained her there.\r\nMoore placed his hand a moment on his young cousin\'s shoulder, stooped,\r\nand left a kiss on her forehead.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said she, as if the action had unsealed her lips, "I was miserable\r\nwhen I thought you would not come. I am almost too happy now. Are you\r\nhappy, Robert? Do you like to come home?"\r\n\r\n"I think I do--to-night, at least."\r\n\r\n"Are you certain you are not fretting about your frames, and your\r\nbusiness, and the war?"\r\n\r\n"Not just now."\r\n\r\n"Are you positive you don\'t feel Hollow\'s Cottage too small for you, and\r\nnarrow, and dismal?"\r\n\r\n"At this moment, no."\r\n\r\n"Can you affirm that you are not bitter at heart because rich and great\r\npeople forget you?"\r\n\r\n"No more questions. You are mistaken if you think I am anxious to curry\r\nfavour with rich and great people. I only want means--a position--a\r\ncareer."\r\n\r\n"Which your own talent and goodness shall win you. You were made to be\r\ngreat; you _shall_ be great."\r\n\r\n"I wonder now, if you spoke honestly out of your heart, what recipe you\r\nwould give me for acquiring this same greatness; but I know it--better\r\nthan you know it yourself. Would it be efficacious? Would it work?\r\nYes--poverty, misery, bankruptcy. Oh, life is not what you think it,\r\nLina!"\r\n\r\n"But you are what I think you."\r\n\r\n"I am not."\r\n\r\n"You are better, then?"\r\n\r\n"Far worse."\r\n\r\n"No; far better. I know you are good."\r\n\r\n"How do you know it?"\r\n\r\n"You look so, and I feel you _are_ so."\r\n\r\n"Where do you feel it?"\r\n\r\n"In my heart."\r\n\r\n"Ah! You judge me with your heart, Lina: you should judge me with your\r\nhead."\r\n\r\n"I do; and then I am quite proud of you. Robert, you cannot tell all my\r\nthoughts about you."\r\n\r\nMr. Moore\'s dark face mustered colour; his lips smiled, and yet were\r\ncompressed; his eyes laughed, and yet he resolutely knit his brow.\r\n\r\n"Think meanly of me, Lina," said he. "Men, in general, are a sort of\r\nscum, very different to anything of which you have an idea. I make no\r\npretension to be better than my fellows."\r\n\r\n"If you did, I should not esteem you so much. It is because you are\r\nmodest that I have such confidence in your merit."\r\n\r\n"Are you flattering me?" he demanded, turning sharply upon her, and\r\nsearching her face with an eye of acute penetration.\r\n\r\n"No," she said softly, laughing at his sudden quickness. She seemed to\r\nthink it unnecessary to proffer any eager disavowal of the charge.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t care whether I think you flatter me or not?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"You are so secure of your own intentions?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so."\r\n\r\n"What are they, Caroline?"\r\n\r\n"Only to ease my mind by expressing for once part of what I think, and\r\nthen to make you better satisfied with yourself."\r\n\r\n"By assuring me that my kinswoman is my sincere friend?"\r\n\r\n"Just so. I am your sincere friend, Robert."\r\n\r\n"And I am--what chance and change shall make me, Lina."\r\n\r\n"Not my enemy, however?"\r\n\r\nThe answer was cut short by Sarah and her mistress entering the kitchen\r\ntogether in some commotion. They had been improving the time which Mr.\r\nMoore and Miss Helstone had spent in dialogue by a short dispute on the\r\nsubject of "caf\xc3\xa9 au lait," which Sarah said was the queerest mess she\r\never saw, and a waste of God\'s good gifts, as it was "the nature of\r\ncoffee to be boiled in water," and which mademoiselle affirmed to be "un\r\nbreuvage royal," a thousand times too good for the mean person who\r\nobjected to it.\r\n\r\nThe former occupants of the kitchen now withdrew into the parlour.\r\nBefore Hortense followed them thither, Caroline had only time again to\r\nquestion, "Not my enemy, Robert?" And Moore, Quaker-like, had replied\r\nwith another query, "Could I be?" And then, seating himself at the\r\ntable, had settled Caroline at his side.\r\n\r\nCaroline scarcely heard mademoiselle\'s explosion of wrath when she\r\nrejoined them; the long declamation about the "conduite indigne de cette\r\nm\xc3\xa9chante cr\xc3\xa9ature" sounded in her ear as confusedly as the agitated\r\nrattling of the china. Robert laughed a little at it, in very subdued\r\nsort, and then, politely and calmly entreating his sister to be\r\ntranquil, assured her that if it would yield her any satisfaction, she\r\nshould have her choice of an attendant amongst all the girls in his\r\nmill. Only he feared they would scarcely suit her, as they were most of\r\nthem, he was informed, completely ignorant of household work; and pert\r\nand self-willed as Sarah was, she was, perhaps, no worse than the\r\nmajority of the women of her class.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle admitted the truth of this conjecture: according to her,\r\n"ces paysannes anglaises \xc3\xa9taient tout insupportables." What would she\r\nnot give for some "bonne cuisini\xc3\xa8re anversoise," with the high cap,\r\nshort petticoat, and decent sabots proper to her class--something\r\nbetter, indeed, than an insolent coquette in a flounced gown, and\r\nabsolutely without cap! (For Sarah, it appears, did not partake the\r\nopinion of St. Paul that "it is a shame for a woman to go with her head\r\nuncovered;" but, holding rather a contrary doctrine, resolutely refused\r\nto imprison in linen or muslin the plentiful tresses of her yellow hair,\r\nwhich it was her wont to fasten up smartly with a comb behind, and on\r\nSundays to wear curled in front.)\r\n\r\n"Shall I try and get you an Antwerp girl?" asked Mr. Moore, who, stern\r\nin public, was on the whole very kind in private.\r\n\r\n"Merci du cadeau!" was the answer. "An Antwerp girl would not stay here\r\nten days, sneered at as she would be by all the young coquines in your\r\nfactory;" then softening, "You are very good, dear brother--excuse my\r\npetulance--but truly my domestic trials are severe, yet they are\r\nprobably my destiny; for I recollect that our revered mother experienced\r\nsimilar sufferings, though she had the choice of all the best servants\r\nin Antwerp. Domestics are in all countries a spoiled and unruly set."\r\n\r\nMr. Moore had also certain reminiscences about the trials of his revered\r\nmother. A good mother she had been to him, and he honoured her memory;\r\nbut he recollected that she kept a hot kitchen of it in Antwerp, just as\r\nhis faithful sister did here in England. Thus, therefore, he let the\r\nsubject drop, and when the coffee-service was removed, proceeded to\r\nconsole Hortense by fetching her music-book and guitar; and having\r\narranged the ribbon of the instrument round her neck with a quiet\r\nfraternal kindness he knew to be all-powerful in soothing her most\r\nruffled moods, he asked her to give him some of their mother\'s favourite\r\nsongs.\r\n\r\nNothing refines like affection. Family jarring vulgarizes; family union\r\nelevates. Hortense, pleased with her brother, and grateful to him,\r\nlooked, as she touched her guitar, almost graceful, almost handsome; her\r\neveryday fretful look was gone for a moment, and was replaced by a\r\n"sourire plein de bont\xc3\xa9." She sang the songs he asked for, with feeling;\r\nthey reminded her of a parent to whom she had been truly attached; they\r\nreminded her of her young days. She observed, too, that Caroline\r\nlistened with na\xc3\xafve interest; this augmented her good-humour; and the\r\nexclamation at the close of the song, "I wish I could sing and play like\r\nHortense!" achieved the business, and rendered her charming for the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nIt is true a little lecture to Caroline followed, on the vanity of\r\n_wishing_ and the duty of _trying_. "As Rome," it was suggested, "had\r\nnot been built in a day, so neither had Mademoiselle G\xc3\xa9rard Moore\'s\r\neducation been completed in a week, or by merely _wishing_ to be clever.\r\nIt was effort that had accomplished that great work. She was ever\r\nremarkable for her perseverance, for her industry. Her masters had\r\nremarked that it was as delightful as it was uncommon to find so much\r\ntalent united with so much solidity, and so on." Once on the theme of\r\nher own merits, mademoiselle was fluent.\r\n\r\nCradled at last in blissful self-complacency, she took her knitting, and\r\nsat down tranquil. Drawn curtains, a clear fire, a softly-shining lamp,\r\ngave now to the little parlour its best, its evening charm. It is\r\nprobable that the three there present felt this charm. They all looked\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\n"What shall we do now, Caroline?" asked Mr. Moore, returning to his seat\r\nbeside his cousin.\r\n\r\n"What shall we do, Robert?" repeated she playfully. "You decide."\r\n\r\n"Not play at chess?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Nor draughts, nor backgammon?"\r\n\r\n"No, no; we both hate silent games that only keep one\'s hands employed,\r\ndon\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"I believe we do. Then shall we talk scandal?"\r\n\r\n"About whom? Are we sufficiently interested in anybody to take a\r\npleasure in pulling their character to pieces?"\r\n\r\n"A question that comes to the point. For my part, unamiable as it\r\nsounds, I must say no."\r\n\r\n"And I too. But it is strange, though we want no third--fourth, I mean\r\n(she hastily and with contrition glanced at Hortense), living person\r\namong us--so selfish we are in our happiness--though we don\'t want to\r\nthink of the present existing world, it would be pleasant to go back to\r\nthe past, to hear people that have slept for generations in graves that\r\nare perhaps no longer graves now, but gardens and fields, speak to us\r\nand tell us their thoughts, and impart their ideas."\r\n\r\n"Who shall be the speaker? What language shall he utter? French?"\r\n\r\n"Your French forefathers don\'t speak so sweetly, nor so solemnly, nor so\r\nimpressively as your English ancestors, Robert. To-night you shall be\r\nentirely English. You shall read an English book."\r\n\r\n"An old English book?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, an old English book--one that you like; and I will choose a part\r\nof it that is toned quite in harmony with something in you. It shall\r\nwaken your nature, fill your mind with music; it shall pass like a\r\nskilful hand over your heart, and make its strings sound. Your heart is\r\na lyre, Robert; but the lot of your life has not been a minstrel to\r\nsweep it, and it is often silent. Let glorious William come near and\r\ntouch it. You will see how he will draw the English power and melody out\r\nof its chords."\r\n\r\n"I must read Shakespeare?"\r\n\r\n"You must have his spirit before you; you must hear his voice with your\r\nmind\'s ear; you must take some of his soul into yours."\r\n\r\n"With a view to making me better? Is it to operate like a sermon?"\r\n\r\n"It is to stir you, to give you new sensations. It is to make you feel\r\nyour life strongly--not only your virtues, but your vicious, perverse\r\npoints."\r\n\r\n"Dieu! que dit-elle?" cried Hortense, who hitherto had been counting\r\nstitches in her knitting, and had not much attended to what was said,\r\nbut whose ear these two strong words caught with a tweak.\r\n\r\n"Never mind her, sister; let her talk. Now just let her say anything she\r\npleases to-night. She likes to come down hard upon your brother\r\nsometimes. It amuses me, so let her alone."\r\n\r\nCaroline, who, mounted on a chair, had been rummaging the bookcase,\r\nreturned with a book.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s Shakespeare," she said, "and there\'s \'Coriolanus.\' Now, read,\r\nand discover by the feelings the reading will give you at once how low\r\nand how high you are."\r\n\r\n"Come, then, sit near me, and correct when I mispronounce."\r\n\r\n"I am to be the teacher then, and you my pupil?"\r\n\r\n"Ainsi, soit-il!"\r\n\r\n"And Shakespeare is our science, since we are going to study?"\r\n\r\n"It appears so."\r\n\r\n"And you are not going to be French, and sceptical, and sneering? You\r\nare not going to think it a sign of wisdom to refuse to admire?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"If you do, Robert, I\'ll take Shakespeare away; and I\'ll shrivel up\r\nwithin myself, and put on my bonnet and go home."\r\n\r\n"Sit down. Here I begin."\r\n\r\n"One minute, if you please, brother," interrupted mademoiselle. "When\r\nthe gentleman of a family reads, the ladies should always\r\nsew.--Caroline, dear child, take your embroidery. You may get three\r\nsprigs done to-night."\r\n\r\nCaroline looked dismayed. "I can\'t see by lamp-light; my eyes are tired,\r\nand I can\'t do two things well at once. If I sew, I cannot listen; if I\r\nlisten, I cannot sew."\r\n\r\n"Fi, donc! Quel enfantillage!" began Hortense. Mr. Moore, as usual,\r\nsuavely interposed.\r\n\r\n"Permit her to neglect the embroidery for this evening. I wish her whole\r\nattention to be fixed on my accent; and to ensure this, she must follow\r\nthe reading with her eyes--she must look at the book."\r\n\r\nHe placed it between them, reposed his arm on the back of Caroline\'s\r\nchair, and thus began to read.\r\n\r\nThe very first scene in "Coriolanus" came with smart relish to his\r\nintellectual palate, and still as he read he warmed. He delivered the\r\nhaughty speech of Caius Marcius to the starving citizens with unction;\r\nhe did not say he thought his irrational pride right, but he seemed to\r\nfeel it so. Caroline looked up at him with a singular smile.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a vicious point hit already," she said. "You sympathize with\r\nthat proud patrician who does not sympathize with his famished\r\nfellow-men, and insults them. There, go on." He proceeded. The warlike\r\nportions did not rouse him much; he said all that was out of date, or\r\nshould be; the spirit displayed was barbarous; yet the encounter\r\nsingle-handed between Marcius and Tullus Aufidius he delighted in. As he\r\nadvanced, he forgot to criticise; it was evident he appreciated the\r\npower, the truth of each portion; and, stepping out of the narrow line\r\nof private prejudices, began to revel in the large picture of human\r\nnature, to feel the reality stamped upon the characters who were\r\nspeaking from that page before him.\r\n\r\nHe did not read the comic scenes well; and Caroline, taking the book out\r\nof his hand, read these parts for him. From her he seemed to enjoy them,\r\nand indeed she gave them with a spirit no one could have expected of\r\nher, with a pithy expression with which she seemed gifted on the spot,\r\nand for that brief moment only. It may be remarked, in passing, that the\r\ngeneral character of her conversation that evening, whether serious or\r\nsprightly, grave or gay, was as of something untaught, unstudied,\r\nintuitive, fitful--when once gone, no more to be reproduced as it had\r\nbeen than the glancing ray of the meteor, than the tints of the dew-gem,\r\nthan the colour or form of the sunset cloud, than the fleeting and\r\nglittering ripple varying the flow of a rivulet.\r\n\r\nCoriolanus in glory, Coriolanus in disaster, Coriolanus banished,\r\nfollowed like giant shades one after the other. Before the vision of the\r\nbanished man Moore\'s spirit seemed to pause. He stood on the hearth of\r\nAufidius\'s hall, facing the image of greatness fallen, but greater than\r\never in that low estate. He saw "the grim appearance," the dark face\r\n"bearing command in it," "the noble vessel with its tackle torn." With\r\nthe revenge of Caius Marcius, Moore perfectly sympathized; he was not\r\nscandalized by it; and again Caroline whispered, "There I see another\r\nglimpse of brotherhood in error."\r\n\r\nThe march on Rome, the mother\'s supplication, the long resistance, the\r\nfinal yielding of bad passions to good, which ever must be the case in a\r\nnature worthy the epithet of noble, the rage of Aufidius at what he\r\nconsidered his ally\'s weakness, the death of Coriolanus, the final\r\nsorrow of his great enemy--all scenes made of condensed truth and\r\nstrength--came on in succession and carried with them in their deep,\r\nfast flow the heart and mind of reader and listener.\r\n\r\n"Now, have you felt Shakespeare?" asked Caroline, some ten minutes after\r\nher cousin had closed the book.\r\n\r\n"I think so."\r\n\r\n"And have you felt anything in Coriolanus like you?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I have."\r\n\r\n"Was he not faulty as well as great?"\r\n\r\nMoore nodded.\r\n\r\n"And what was his fault? What made him hated by the citizens? What\r\ncaused him to be banished by his countrymen?"\r\n\r\n"What do you think it was?"\r\n\r\n"I ask again--\r\n\r\n                      \'Whether was it pride,\r\n    Which out of daily fortune ever taints\r\n    The happy man? whether defect of judgment,\r\n    To fail in the disposing of those chances\r\n    Which he was lord of? or whether nature,\r\n    Not to be other than one thing, not moving\r\n    From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace\r\n    Even with the same austerity and garb\r\n    As he controlled the war?\'"\r\n\r\n"Well, answer yourself, Sphinx."\r\n\r\n"It was a spice of all; and you must not be proud to your workpeople;\r\nyou must not neglect chances of soothing them; and you must not be of an\r\ninflexible nature, uttering a request as austerely as if it were a\r\ncommand."\r\n\r\n"That is the moral you tack to the play. What puts such notions into\r\nyour head?"\r\n\r\n"A wish for your good, a care for your safety, dear Robert, and a fear,\r\ncaused by many things which I have heard lately, that you will come to\r\nharm."\r\n\r\n"Who tells you these things?"\r\n\r\n"I hear my uncle talk about you. He praises your hard spirit, your\r\ndetermined cast of mind, your scorn of low enemies, your resolution not\r\n\'to truckle to the mob,\' as he says."\r\n\r\n"And would you have me truckle to them?"\r\n\r\n"No, not for the world. I never wish you to lower yourself; but somehow\r\nI cannot help thinking it unjust to include all poor working-people\r\nunder the general and insulting name of \'the mob,\' and continually to\r\nthink of them and treat them haughtily."\r\n\r\n"You are a little democrat, Caroline. If your uncle knew, what would he\r\nsay?"\r\n\r\n"I rarely talk to my uncle, as you know, and never about such things. He\r\nthinks everything but sewing and cooking above women\'s comprehension,\r\nand out of their line."\r\n\r\n"And do you fancy you comprehend the subjects on which you advise me?"\r\n\r\n"As far as they concern you, I comprehend them. I know it would be\r\nbetter for you to be loved by your workpeople than to be hated by them,\r\nand I am sure that kindness is more likely to win their regard than\r\npride. If you were proud and cold to me and Hortense, should we love\r\nyou? When you are cold to me, as you _are_ sometimes, can I venture to\r\nbe affectionate in return?"\r\n\r\n"Now, Lina, I\'ve had my lesson both in languages and ethics, with a\r\ntouch on politics; it is your turn. Hortense tells me you were much\r\ntaken by a little piece of poetry you learned the other day, a piece by\r\npoor Andr\xc3\xa9 Ch\xc3\xa9nier--\'La Jeune Captive.\' Do you remember it still?"\r\n\r\n"I think so."\r\n\r\n"Repeat it, then. Take your time and mind your accent; especially let us\r\nhave no English _u_\'s."\r\n\r\nCaroline, beginning in a low, rather tremulous voice, but gaining\r\ncourage as she proceeded, repeated the sweet verses of Ch\xc3\xa9nier. The last\r\nthree stanzas she rehearsed well.\r\n\r\n    "Mon beau voyage encore est si loin de sa fin!\r\n     Je pars, et des ormeaux qui bordent le chemin\r\n       J\'ai pass\xc3\xa9 le premiers \xc3\xa0 peine.\r\n     Au banquet de la vie \xc3\xa0 peine commenc\xc3\xa9,\r\n     Un instant seulement mes l\xc3\xa8vres ont press\xc3\xa9\r\n       La coupe en mes mains encore pleine.\r\n\r\n    "Je ne suis qu\'au printemps--je veux voir la moisson;\r\n     Et comme le soleil, de saison en saison,\r\n       Je veux achever mon ann\xc3\xa9e,\r\n     Brillante sur ma tige, et l\'honneur du jardin\r\n     Je n\'ai vu luire encore que les feux du matin,\r\n       Je veux achever ma journ\xc3\xa9e!"\r\n\r\nMoore listened at first with his eyes cast down, but soon he furtively\r\nraised them. Leaning back in his chair he could watch Caroline without\r\nher perceiving where his gaze was fixed. Her cheek had a colour, her\r\neyes a light, her countenance an expression this evening which would\r\nhave made even plain features striking; but there was not the grievous\r\ndefect of plainness to pardon in her case. The sunshine was not shed on\r\nrough barrenness; it fell on soft bloom. Each lineament was turned with\r\ngrace; the whole aspect was pleasing. At the present moment--animated,\r\ninterested, touched--she might be called beautiful. Such a face was\r\ncalculated to awaken not only the calm sentiment of esteem, the distant\r\none of admiration, but some feeling more tender, genial,\r\nintimate--friendship, perhaps, affection, interest. When she had\r\nfinished, she turned to Moore, and met his eye.\r\n\r\n"Is that pretty well repeated?" she inquired, smiling like any happy,\r\ndocile child.\r\n\r\n"I really don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you know? Have you not listened?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--and looked. You are fond of poetry, Lina?"\r\n\r\n"When I meet with _real_ poetry, I cannot rest till I have learned it by\r\nheart, and so made it partly mine."\r\n\r\nMr. Moore now sat silent for several minutes. It struck nine o\'clock.\r\nSarah entered, and said that Mr. Helstone\'s servant was come for Miss\r\nCaroline.\r\n\r\n"Then the evening is gone already," she observed, "and it will be long,\r\nI suppose, before I pass another here."\r\n\r\nHortense had been for some time nodding over her knitting; fallen into a\r\ndoze now, she made no response to the remark.\r\n\r\n"You would have no objection to come here oftener of an evening?"\r\ninquired Robert, as he took her folded mantle from the side-table, where\r\nit still lay, and carefully wrapped it round her.\r\n\r\n"I like to come here; but I have no desire to be intrusive. I am not\r\nhinting to be asked; you must understand that."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I understand thee, child. You sometimes lecture me for wishing to\r\nbe rich, Lina; but if I _were_ rich, you should live here always--at any\r\nrate, you should live with me wherever my habitation might be."\r\n\r\n"That would be pleasant; and if you were poor--ever so poor--it would\r\nstill be pleasant. Good-night, Robert."\r\n\r\n"I promised to walk with you up to the rectory."\r\n\r\n"I know you did; but I thought you had forgotten, and I hardly knew how\r\nto remind you, though I wished to do it. But would you like to go? It is\r\na cold night, and as Fanny is come, there is no necessity----"\r\n\r\n"Here is your muff; don\'t wake Hortense--come."\r\n\r\nThe half mile to the rectory was soon traversed. They parted in the\r\ngarden without kiss, scarcely with a pressure of hands; yet Robert sent\r\nhis cousin in excited and joyously troubled. He had been singularly kind\r\nto her that day--not in phrase, compliment, profession, but in manner,\r\nin look, and in soft and friendly tones.\r\n\r\nFor himself, he came home grave, almost morose. As he stood leaning on\r\nhis own yard-gate, musing in the watery moonlight all alone, the hushed,\r\ndark mill before him, the hill-environed hollow round, he exclaimed,\r\nabruptly,--\r\n\r\n"This won\'t do! There\'s weakness--there\'s downright ruin in all this.\r\nHowever," he added, dropping his voice, "the frenzy is quite temporary.\r\nI know it very well; I have had it before. It will be gone to-morrow."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nThe Curates at Tea.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaroline Helstone was just eighteen years old, and at eighteen the true\r\nnarrative of life is yet to be commenced. Before that time we sit\r\nlistening to a tale, a marvellous fiction, delightful sometimes, and sad\r\nsometimes, almost always unreal. Before that time our world is heroic,\r\nits inhabitants half-divine or semi-demon; its scenes are dream-scenes;\r\ndarker woods and stranger hills, brighter skies, more dangerous waters,\r\nsweeter flowers, more tempting fruits, wider plains, drearier deserts,\r\nsunnier fields than are found in nature, overspread our enchanted globe.\r\nWhat a moon we gaze on before that time! How the trembling of our hearts\r\nat her aspect bears witness to its unutterable beauty! As to our sun, it\r\nis a burning heaven--the world of gods.\r\n\r\nAt that time, at eighteen, drawing near the confines of illusive, void\r\ndreams, Elf-land lies behind us, the shores of Reality rise in front.\r\nThese shores are yet distant; they look so blue, soft, gentle, we long\r\nto reach them. In sunshine we see a greenness beneath the azure, as of\r\nspring meadows; we catch glimpses of silver lines, and imagine the roll\r\nof living waters. Could we but reach this land, we think to hunger and\r\nthirst no more; whereas many a wilderness, and often the flood of death,\r\nor some stream of sorrow as cold and almost as black as death, is to be\r\ncrossed ere true bliss can be tasted. Every joy that life gives must be\r\nearned ere it is secured; and how hardly earned, those only know who\r\nhave wrestled for great prizes. The heart\'s blood must gem with red\r\nbeads the brow of the combatant, before the wreath of victory rustles\r\nover it.\r\n\r\nAt eighteen we are not aware of this. Hope, when she smiles on us, and\r\npromises happiness to-morrow, is implicitly believed; Love, when he\r\ncomes wandering like a lost angel to our door, is at once admitted,\r\nwelcomed, embraced. His quiver is not seen; if his arrows penetrate,\r\ntheir wound is like a thrill of new life. There are no fears of poison,\r\nnone of the barb which no leech\'s hand can extract. That perilous\r\npassion--an agony ever in some of its phases; with many, an agony\r\nthroughout--is believed to be an unqualified good. In short, at eighteen\r\nthe school of experience is to be entered, and her humbling, crushing,\r\ngrinding, but yet purifying and invigorating lessons are yet to be\r\nlearned.\r\n\r\nAlas, Experience! No other mentor has so wasted and frozen a face as\r\nyours, none wears a robe so black, none bears a rod so heavy, none with\r\nhand so inexorable draws the novice so sternly to his task, and forces\r\nhim with authority so resistless to its acquirement. It is by your\r\ninstructions alone that man or woman can ever find a safe track through\r\nlife\'s wilds; without it, how they stumble, how they stray! On what\r\nforbidden grounds do they intrude, down what dread declivities are they\r\nhurled!\r\n\r\nCaroline, having been convoyed home by Robert, had no wish to pass what\r\nremained of the evening with her uncle. The room in which he sat was\r\nvery sacred ground to her; she seldom intruded on it; and to-night she\r\nkept aloof till the bell rang for prayers. Part of the evening church\r\nservice was the form of worship observed in Mr. Helstone\'s household. He\r\nread it in his usual nasal voice, clear, loud, and monotonous. The rite\r\nover, his niece, according to her wont, stepped up to him.\r\n\r\n"Good-night, uncle."\r\n\r\n"Hey! You\'ve been gadding abroad all day--visiting, dining out, and what\r\nnot!"\r\n\r\n"Only at the cottage."\r\n\r\n"And have you learned your lessons?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And made a shirt?"\r\n\r\n"Only part of one."\r\n\r\n"Well, that will do. Stick to the needle, learn shirt-making and\r\ngown-making and piecrust-making, and you\'ll be a clever woman some day.\r\nGo to bed now. I\'m busy with a pamphlet here."\r\n\r\nPresently the niece was enclosed in her small bedroom, the door bolted,\r\nher white dressing-gown assumed, her long hair loosened and falling\r\nthick, soft, and wavy to her waist; and as, resting from the task of\r\ncombing it out, she leaned her check on her hand and fixed her eyes on\r\nthe carpet, before her rose, and close around her drew, the visions we\r\nsee at eighteen years.\r\n\r\nHer thoughts were speaking with her, speaking pleasantly, as it seemed,\r\nfor she smiled as she listened. She looked pretty meditating thus; but a\r\nbrighter thing than she was in that apartment--the spirit of youthful\r\nHope. According to this flattering prophet, she was to know\r\ndisappointment, to feel chill no more; she had entered on the dawn of a\r\nsummer day--no false dawn, but the true spring of morning--and her sun\r\nwould quickly rise. Impossible for her now to suspect that she was the\r\nsport of delusion; her expectations seemed warranted, the foundation on\r\nwhich they rested appeared solid.\r\n\r\n"When people love, the next step is they marry," was her argument. "Now,\r\nI love Robert, and I feel sure that Robert loves me. I have thought so\r\nmany a time before; to-day I _felt_ it. When I looked up at him after\r\nrepeating Ch\xc3\xa9nier\'s poem, his eyes (what handsome eyes he has!) sent the\r\ntruth through my heart. Sometimes I am afraid to speak to him, lest I\r\nshould be too frank, lest I should seem forward--for I have more than\r\nonce regretted bitterly overflowing, superfluous words, and feared I had\r\nsaid more than he expected me to say, and that he would disapprove what\r\nhe might deem my indiscretion; now, to-night I could have ventured to\r\nexpress any thought, he was so indulgent. How kind he was as we walked\r\nup the lane! He does not flatter or say foolish things; his love-making\r\n(friendship, I mean; of course I don\'t yet account him my lover, but I\r\nhope he will be so some day) is not like what we read of in books,--it\r\nis far better--original, quiet, manly, sincere. I _do_ like him; I would\r\nbe an excellent wife to him if he did marry me; I would tell him of his\r\nfaults (for he has a few faults), but I would study his comfort, and\r\ncherish him, and do my best to make him happy. Now, I am sure he will\r\nnot be cold to-morrow. I feel almost certain that to-morrow evening he\r\nwill either come here, or ask me to go there."\r\n\r\nShe recommenced combing her hair, long as a mermaid\'s. Turning her head\r\nas she arranged it she saw her own face and form in the glass. Such\r\nreflections are soberizing to plain people: their own eyes are not\r\nenchanted with the image; they are confident then that the eyes of\r\nothers can see in it no fascination. But the fair must naturally draw\r\nother conclusions: the picture is charming, and must charm. Caroline saw\r\na shape, a head, that, daguerreotyped in that attitude and with that\r\nexpression, would have been lovely. She could not choose but derive\r\nfrom the spectacle confirmation to her hopes. It was then in\r\nundiminished gladness she sought her couch.\r\n\r\nAnd in undiminished gladness she rose the next day. As she entered her\r\nuncle\'s breakfast-room, and with soft cheerfulness wished him\r\ngood-morning, even that little man of bronze himself thought, for an\r\ninstant, his niece was growing "a fine girl." Generally she was quiet\r\nand timid with him--very docile, but not communicative; this morning,\r\nhowever, she found many things to say. Slight topics alone might be\r\ndiscussed between them; for with a woman--a girl--Mr. Helstone would\r\ntouch on no other. She had taken an early walk in the garden, and she\r\ntold him what flowers were beginning to spring there; she inquired when\r\nthe gardener was to come and trim the borders; she informed him that\r\ncertain starlings were beginning to build their nests in the\r\nchurch-tower (Briarfield church was close to Briarfield rectory); she\r\nwondered the tolling of the bells in the belfry did not scare them.\r\n\r\nMr. Helstone opined that "they were like other fools who had just\r\npaired--insensible to inconvenience just for the moment." Caroline, made\r\nperhaps a little too courageous by her temporary good spirits, here\r\nhazarded a remark of a kind she had never before ventured to make on\r\nobservations dropped by her revered relative.\r\n\r\n"Uncle," said she, "whenever you speak of marriage you speak of it\r\nscornfully. Do you think people shouldn\'t marry?"\r\n\r\n"It is decidedly the wisest plan to remain single, especially for\r\nwomen."\r\n\r\n"Are all marriages unhappy?"\r\n\r\n"Millions of marriages are unhappy. If everybody confessed the truth,\r\nperhaps all are more or less so."\r\n\r\n"You are always vexed when you are asked to come and marry a couple.\r\nWhy?"\r\n\r\n"Because one does not like to act as accessory to the commission of a\r\npiece of pure folly."\r\n\r\nMr. Helstone spoke so readily, he seemed rather glad of the opportunity\r\nto give his niece a piece of his mind on this point. Emboldened by the\r\nimpunity which had hitherto attended her questions, she went a little\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n"But why," said she, "should it be pure folly? If two people like each\r\nother, why shouldn\'t they consent to live together?"\r\n\r\n"They tire of each other--they tire of each other in a month. A\r\nyokefellow is not a companion; he or she is a fellow-sufferer."\r\n\r\nIt was by no means na\xc3\xafve simplicity which inspired Caroline\'s next\r\nremark; it was a sense of antipathy to such opinions, and of displeasure\r\nat him who held them.\r\n\r\n"One would think you had never been married, uncle. One would think you\r\nwere an old bachelor."\r\n\r\n"Practically, I am so."\r\n\r\n"But you have been married. Why were you so inconsistent as to marry?"\r\n\r\n"Every man is mad once or twice in his life."\r\n\r\n"So you tired of my aunt, and my aunt of you, and you were miserable\r\ntogether?"\r\n\r\nMr. Helstone pushed out his cynical lip, wrinkled his brown forehead,\r\nand gave an inarticulate grunt.\r\n\r\n"Did she not suit you? Was she not good-tempered? Did you not get used\r\nto her? Were you not sorry when she died?"\r\n\r\n"Caroline," said Mr. Helstone, bringing his hand slowly down to within\r\nan inch or two of the table, and then smiting it suddenly on the\r\nmahogany, "understand this: it is vulgar and puerile to confound\r\ngenerals with particulars. In every case there is the rule and there are\r\nthe exceptions. Your questions are stupid and babyish. Ring the bell, if\r\nyou have done breakfast."\r\n\r\nThe breakfast was taken away, and that meal over, it was the general\r\ncustom of uncle and niece to separate, and not to meet again till\r\ndinner; but to-day the niece, instead of quitting the room, went to the\r\nwindow-seat, and sat down there. Mr. Helstone looked round uneasily once\r\nor twice, as if he wished her away; but she was gazing from the window,\r\nand did not seem to mind him: so he continued the perusal of his morning\r\npaper--a particularly interesting one it chanced to be, as new movements\r\nhad just taken place in the Peninsula, and certain columns of the\r\njournal were rich in long dispatches from General Lord Wellington. He\r\nlittle knew, meantime, what thoughts were busy in his niece\'s\r\nmind--thoughts the conversation of the past half-hour had revived but\r\nnot generated; tumultuous were they now, as disturbed bees in a hive,\r\nbut it was years since they had first made their cells in her brain.\r\n\r\nShe was reviewing his character, his disposition, repeating his\r\nsentiments on marriage. Many a time had she reviewed them before, and\r\nsounded the gulf between her own mind and his; and then, on the other\r\nside of the wide and deep chasm, she had seen, and she now saw, another\r\nfigure standing beside her uncle\'s--a strange shape, dim, sinister,\r\nscarcely earthly--the half-remembered image of her own father, James\r\nHelstone, Matthewson Helstone\'s brother.\r\n\r\nRumours had reached her ear of what that father\'s character was; old\r\nservants had dropped hints; she knew, too, that he was not a good man,\r\nand that he was never kind to her. She recollected--a dark recollection\r\nit was--some weeks that she had spent with him in a great town\r\nsomewhere, when she had had no maid to dress her or take care of her;\r\nwhen she had been shut up, day and night, in a high garret-room, without\r\na carpet, with a bare uncurtained bed, and scarcely any other furniture;\r\nwhen he went out early every morning, and often forgot to return and\r\ngive her her dinner during the day, and at night, when he came back, was\r\nlike a madman, furious, terrible, or--still more painful--like an idiot,\r\nimbecile, senseless. She knew she had fallen ill in this place, and that\r\none night, when she was very sick he had come raving into the room, and\r\nsaid he would kill her, for she was a burden to him. Her screams had\r\nbrought aid; and from the moment she was then rescued from him she had\r\nnever seen him, except as a dead man in his coffin.\r\n\r\nThat was her father. Also she had a mother, though Mr. Helstone never\r\nspoke to her of that mother, though she could not remember having seen\r\nher; but that she was alive she knew. This mother was then the\r\ndrunkard\'s wife. What had _their_ marriage been? Caroline, turning from\r\nthe lattice, whence she had been watching the starlings (though without\r\nseeing them), in a low voice, and with a sad, bitter tone, thus broke\r\nthe silence of the room,--\r\n\r\n"You term marriage miserable, I suppose, from what you saw of my father\r\nand mother\'s. If my mother suffered what I suffered when I was with\r\npapa, she must have had a dreadful life."\r\n\r\nMr. Helstone, thus addressed, wheeled about in his chair, and looked\r\nover his spectacles at his niece. He was taken aback.\r\n\r\nHer father and mother! What had put it into her head to mention her\r\nfather and mother, of whom he had never, during the twelve years she had\r\nlived with him, spoken to her? That the thoughts were self-matured, that\r\nshe had any recollections or speculations about her parents, he could\r\nnot fancy.\r\n\r\n"Your father and mother? Who has been talking to you about them?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody; but I remember something of what papa was, and I pity mamma.\r\nWhere is she?"\r\n\r\nThis "Where is she?" had been on Caroline\'s lips hundreds of times\r\nbefore, but till now she had never uttered it.\r\n\r\n"I hardly know," returned Mr. Helstone; "I was little acquainted with\r\nher. I have not heard from her for years: but wherever she is, she\r\nthinks nothing of you; she never inquires about you. I have reason to\r\nbelieve she does not wish to see you. Come, it is school-time. You go to\r\nyour cousin at ten, don\'t you? The clock has struck."\r\n\r\nPerhaps Caroline would have said more; but Fanny, coming in, informed\r\nher master that the churchwardens wanted to speak to him in the vestry.\r\nHe hastened to join them, and his niece presently set out for the\r\ncottage.\r\n\r\nThe road from the rectory to Hollow\'s Mill inclined downwards; she ran,\r\ntherefore, almost all the way. Exercise, the fresh air, the thought of\r\nseeing Robert, at least of being on his premises, in his vicinage,\r\nrevived her somewhat depressed spirits quickly. Arriving in sight of the\r\nwhite house, and within hearing of the thundering mill and its rushing\r\nwatercourse, the first thing she saw was Moore at his garden gate. There\r\nhe stood, in his belted Holland blouse, a light cap covering his head,\r\nwhich undress costume suited him. He was looking down the lane, not in\r\nthe direction of his cousin\'s approach. She stopped, withdrawing a\r\nlittle behind a willow, and studied his appearance.\r\n\r\n"He has not his peer," she thought. "He is as handsome as he is\r\nintelligent. What a keen eye he has! What clearly-cut, spirited\r\nfeatures--thin and serious, but graceful! I do like his face, I do like\r\nhis aspect, I do like him so much--better than any of those shuffling\r\ncurates, for instance--better than anybody; bonny Robert!"\r\n\r\nShe sought "bonny Robert\'s" presence speedily. For his part, when she\r\nchallenged his sight, I believe he would have passed from before her\r\neyes like a phantom, if he could; but being a tall fact, and no fiction,\r\nhe was obliged to stand the greeting. He made it brief. It was\r\ncousin-like, brother-like, friend-like, anything but lover-like. The\r\nnameless charm of last night had left his manner: he was no longer the\r\nsame man: or, at any rate, the same heart did not beat in his breast.\r\nRude disappointment, sharp cross! At first the eager girl would not\r\nbelieve in the change, though she saw and felt it. It was difficult to\r\nwithdraw her hand from his, till he had bestowed at least something like\r\na kind pressure; it was difficult to turn her eyes from his eyes, till\r\nhis looks had expressed something more and fonder than that cool\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nA lover masculine so disappointed can speak and urge explanation, a\r\nlover feminine can say nothing; if she did, the result would be shame\r\nand anguish, inward remorse for self-treachery. Nature would brand such\r\ndemonstration as a rebellion against her instincts, and would\r\nvindictively repay it afterwards by the thunderbolt of self-contempt\r\nsmiting suddenly in secret. Take the matter as you find it: ask no\r\nquestions, utter no remonstrances; it is your best wisdom. You expected\r\nbread, and you have got a stone: break your teeth on it, and don\'t\r\nshriek because the nerves are martyrized; do not doubt that your mental\r\nstomach--if you have such a thing--is strong as an ostrich\'s; the stone\r\nwill digest. You held out your hand for an egg, and fate put into it a\r\nscorpion. Show no consternation: close your fingers firmly upon the\r\ngift; let it sting through your palm. Never mind; in time, after your\r\nhand and arm have swelled and quivered long with torture, the squeezed\r\nscorpion will die, and you will have learned the great lesson how to\r\nendure without a sob. For the whole remnant of your life, if you survive\r\nthe test--some, it is said, die under it--you will be stronger, wiser,\r\nless sensitive. This you are not aware of, perhaps, at the time, and so\r\ncannot borrow courage of that hope. Nature, however, as has been\r\nintimated, is an excellent friend in such cases, sealing the lips,\r\ninterdicting utterance, commanding a placid dissimulation--a\r\ndissimulation often wearing an easy and gay mien at first, settling down\r\nto sorrow and paleness in time, then passing away, and leaving a\r\nconvenient stoicism, not the less fortifying because it is half-bitter.\r\n\r\nHalf-bitter! Is that wrong? No; it should be bitter: bitterness is\r\nstrength--it is a tonic. Sweet, mild force following acute suffering you\r\nfind nowhere; to talk of it is delusion. There may be apathetic\r\nexhaustion after the rack. If energy remains, it will be rather a\r\ndangerous energy--deadly when confronted with injustice.\r\n\r\nWho has read the ballad of "Puir Mary Lee"--that old Scotch ballad,\r\nwritten I know not in what generation nor by what hand? Mary had been\r\nill-used--probably in being made to believe that truth which was\r\nfalsehood. She is not complaining, but she is sitting alone in the\r\nsnowstorm, and you hear her thoughts. They are not the thoughts of a\r\nmodel heroine under her circumstances, but they are those of a\r\ndeeply-feeling, strongly-resentful peasant-girl. Anguish has driven her\r\nfrom the ingle-nook of home to the white-shrouded and icy hills.\r\nCrouched under the "cauld drift," she recalls every image of\r\nhorror--"the yellow-wymed ask," "the hairy adder," "the auld moon-bowing\r\ntyke," "the ghaist at e\'en,", "the sour bullister," "the milk on the\r\ntaed\'s back." She hates these, but "waur she hates Robin-a-Ree."\r\n\r\n    "Oh, ance I lived happily by yon bonny burn--\r\n       The warld was in love wi\' me;\r\n     But now I maun sit \'neath the cauld drift and mourn,\r\n       And curse black Robin-a-Ree!\r\n\r\n    "Then whudder awa, thou bitter biting blast,\r\n       And sough through the scrunty tree,\r\n     And smoor me up in the snaw fu\' fast,\r\n       And n\'er let the sun me see!\r\n\r\n    "Oh, never melt awa, thou wreath o\' snaw,\r\n       That\'s sae kind in graving me;\r\n     But hide me frae the scorn and guffaw\r\n       O\' villains like Robin-a-Ree!"\r\n\r\nBut what has been said in the last page or two is not germane to\r\nCaroline Helstone\'s feelings, or to the state of things between her and\r\nRobert Moore. Robert had done her no wrong; he had told her no lie; it\r\nwas she that was to blame, if any one was. What bitterness her mind\r\ndistilled should and would be poured on her own head. She had loved\r\nwithout being asked to love--a natural, sometimes an inevitable chance,\r\nbut big with misery.\r\n\r\nRobert, indeed, had sometimes seemed to be fond of her; but why? Because\r\nshe had made herself so pleasing to him, he could not, in spite of all\r\nhis efforts, help testifying a state of feeling his judgment did not\r\napprove nor his will sanction. He was about to withdraw decidedly from\r\nintimate communication with her, because he did not choose to have his\r\naffections inextricably entangled, nor to be drawn, despite his reason,\r\ninto a marriage he believed imprudent. Now, what was she to do? To give\r\nway to her feelings, or to vanquish them? To pursue him, or to turn\r\nupon herself? If she is weak, she will try the first expedient--will\r\nlose his esteem and win his aversion; if she has sense, she will be her\r\nown governor, and resolve to subdue and bring under guidance the\r\ndisturbed realm of her emotions. She will determine to look on life\r\nsteadily, as it is; to begin to learn its severe truths seriously, and\r\nto study its knotty problems closely, conscientiously.\r\n\r\nIt appeared she had a little sense, for she quitted Robert quietly,\r\nwithout complaint or question, without the alteration of a muscle or the\r\nshedding of a tear, betook herself to her studies under Hortense as\r\nusual, and at dinner-time went home without lingering.\r\n\r\nWhen she had dined, and found herself in the rectory drawing-room alone,\r\nhaving left her uncle over his temperate glass of port wine, the\r\ndifficulty that occurred to and embarrassed her was, "How am I to get\r\nthrough this day?"\r\n\r\nLast night she had hoped it would be spent as yesterday was, that the\r\nevening would be again passed with happiness and Robert. She had learned\r\nher mistake this morning; and yet she could not settle down, convinced\r\nthat no chance would occur to recall her to Hollow\'s Cottage, or to\r\nbring Moore again into her society.\r\n\r\nHe had walked up after tea more than once to pass an hour with her\r\nuncle. The door-bell had rung, his voice had been heard in the passage\r\njust at twilight, when she little expected such a pleasure; and this had\r\nhappened twice after he had treated her with peculiar reserve; and\r\nthough he rarely talked to her in her uncle\'s presence, he had looked at\r\nher relentingly as he sat opposite her work-table during his stay. The\r\nfew words he had spoken to her were comforting; his manner on bidding\r\nher good-night was genial. Now, he might come this evening, said False\r\nHope. She almost knew it was False Hope which breathed the whisper, and\r\nyet she listened.\r\n\r\nShe tried to read--her thoughts wandered; she tried to sew--every stitch\r\nshe put in was an _ennui_, the occupation was insufferably tedious; she\r\nopened her desk and attempted to write a French composition--she wrote\r\nnothing but mistakes.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door-bell sharply rang; her heart leaped; she sprang to the\r\ndrawing-room door, opened it softly, peeped through the aperture. Fanny\r\nwas admitting a visitor--a gentleman--a tall man--just the height of\r\nRobert. For one second she thought it was Robert--for one second she\r\nexulted; but the voice asking for Mr. Helstone undeceived her. That\r\nvoice was an Irish voice, consequently not Moore\'s, but the\r\ncurate\'s--Malone\'s. He was ushered into the dining-room, where,\r\ndoubtless, he speedily helped his rector to empty the decanters.\r\n\r\nIt was a fact to be noted, that at whatever house in Briarfield,\r\nWhinbury, or Nunnely one curate dropped in to a meal--dinner or tea, as,\r\nthe case might be--another presently followed, often two more. Not that\r\nthey gave each other the rendezvous, but they were usually all on the\r\nrun at the same time; and when Donne, for instance, sought Malone at his\r\nlodgings and found him not, he inquired whither he had posted, and\r\nhaving learned of the landlady his destination, hastened with all speed\r\nafter him. The same causes operated in the same way with Sweeting. Thus\r\nit chanced on that afternoon that Caroline\'s ears were three times\r\ntortured with the ringing of the bell and the advent of undesired\r\nguests; for Donne followed Malone, and Sweeting followed Donne; and more\r\nwine was ordered up from the cellar into the dining-room (for though old\r\nHelstone chid the inferior priesthood when he found them "carousing," as\r\nhe called it, in their own tents, yet at his hierarchical table he ever\r\nliked to treat them to a glass of his best), and through the closed\r\ndoors Caroline heard their boyish laughter, and the vacant cackle of\r\ntheir voices. Her fear was lest they should stay to tea, for she had no\r\npleasure in making tea for that particular trio. What distinctions\r\npeople draw! These three were men--young men--educated men, like Moore;\r\nyet, for her, how great the difference! Their society was a bore--his a\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nNot only was she destined to be favoured with their clerical company,\r\nbut Fortune was at this moment bringing her four other guests--lady\r\nguests, all packed in a pony-phaeton now rolling somewhat heavily along\r\nthe road from Whinbury: an elderly lady and three of her buxom daughters\r\nwere coming to see her "in a friendly way," as the custom of that\r\nneighbourhood was. Yes, a fourth time the bell clanged. Fanny brought\r\nthe present announcement to the drawing-room,--\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Sykes and the three Misses Sykes."\r\n\r\nWhen Caroline was going to receive company, her habit was to wring her\r\nhands very nervously, to flush a little, and come forward hurriedly yet\r\nhesitatingly, wishing herself meantime at Jericho. She was, at such\r\ncrises, sadly deficient in finished manner, though she had once been at\r\nschool a year. Accordingly, on this occasion, her small white hands\r\nsadly maltreated each other, while she stood up, waiting the entrance of\r\nMrs. Sykes.\r\n\r\nIn stalked that lady, a tall, bilious gentlewoman, who made an ample and\r\nnot altogether insincere profession of piety, and was greatly given to\r\nhospitality towards the clergy. In sailed her three daughters, a showy\r\ntrio, being all three well-grown, and more or less handsome.\r\n\r\nIn English country ladies there is this point to be remarked. Whether\r\nyoung or old, pretty or plain, dull or sprightly, they all (or almost\r\nall) have a certain expression stamped on their features, which seems to\r\nsay, "I know--I do not boast of it, but I _know_ that I am the standard\r\nof what is proper; let every one therefore whom I approach, or who\r\napproaches me, keep a sharp lookout, for wherein they differ from me--be\r\nthe same in dress, manner, opinion, principle, or practice--therein they\r\nare wrong."\r\n\r\nMrs. and Misses Sykes, far from being exceptions to this observation,\r\nwere pointed illustrations of its truth. Miss Mary--a well-looked,\r\nwell-meant, and, on the whole, well-dispositioned girl--wore her\r\ncomplacency with some state, though without harshness. Miss Harriet--a\r\nbeauty--carried it more overbearingly; she looked high and cold. Miss\r\nHannah, who was conceited, dashing, pushing, flourished hers consciously\r\nand openly. The mother evinced it with the gravity proper to her age and\r\nreligious fame.\r\n\r\nThe reception was got through somehow. Caroline "was glad to see them"\r\n(an unmitigated fib), hoped they were well, hoped Mrs. Sykes\'s cough was\r\nbetter (Mrs. Sykes had had a cough for the last twenty years), hoped the\r\nMisses Sykes had left their sisters at home well; to which inquiry the\r\nMisses Sykes, sitting on three chairs opposite the music-stool, whereon\r\nCaroline had undesignedly come to anchor, after wavering for some\r\nseconds between it and a large arm-chair, into which she at length\r\nrecollected she ought to induct Mrs. Sykes--and indeed that lady saved\r\nher the trouble by depositing herself therein--the Misses Sykes replied\r\nto Caroline by one simultaneous bow, very majestic and mighty awful. A\r\npause followed. This bow was of a character to ensure silence for the\r\nnext five minutes, and it did. Mrs. Sykes then inquired after Mr.\r\nHelstone, and whether he had had any return of rheumatism, and whether\r\npreaching twice on a Sunday fatigued him, and if he was capable of\r\ntaking a full service now; and on being assured he was, she and all her\r\ndaughters, combining in chorus, expressed their opinion that he was "a\r\nwonderful man of his years."\r\n\r\nPause second.\r\n\r\nMiss Mary, getting up the steam in her turn, asked whether Caroline had\r\nattended the Bible Society meeting which had been held at Nunnely last\r\nThursday night. The negative answer which truth compelled Caroline to\r\nutter--for last Thursday evening she had been sitting at home, reading a\r\nnovel which Robert had lent her--elicited a simultaneous expression of\r\nsurprise from the lips of the four ladies.\r\n\r\n"We were all there," said Miss Mary--"mamma and all of us. We even\r\npersuaded papa to go. Hannah would insist upon it. But he fell asleep\r\nwhile Mr. Langweilig, the German Moravian minister, was speaking. I felt\r\nquite ashamed, he nodded so."\r\n\r\n"And there was Dr. Broadbent," cried Hannah--"such a beautiful speaker!\r\nYou couldn\'t expect it of him, for he is almost a vulgar-looking man."\r\n\r\n"But such a dear man," interrupted Mary.\r\n\r\n"And such a good man, such a useful man," added her mother.\r\n\r\n"Only like a butcher in appearance," interposed the fair, proud Harriet.\r\n"I couldn\'t bear to look at him. I listened with my eyes shut."\r\n\r\nMiss Helstone felt her ignorance and incompetency. Not having seen Dr.\r\nBroadbent, she could not give her opinion. Pause third came on. During\r\nits continuance, Caroline was feeling at her heart\'s core what a\r\ndreaming fool she was, what an unpractical life she led, how little\r\nfitness there was in her for ordinary intercourse with the ordinary\r\nworld. She was feeling how exclusively she had attached herself to the\r\nwhite cottage in the Hollow, how in the existence of one inmate of that\r\ncottage she had pent all her universe. She was sensible that this would\r\nnot do, and that some day she would be forced to make an alteration. It\r\ncould not be said that she exactly wished to resemble the ladies before\r\nher, but she wished to become superior to her present self, so as to\r\nfeel less scared by their dignity.\r\n\r\nThe sole means she found of reviving the flagging discourse was by\r\nasking them if they would all stay to tea; and a cruel struggle it cost\r\nher to perform this piece of civility. Mrs. Sykes had begun, "We are\r\nmuch obliged to you, but----" when in came Fanny once more.\r\n\r\n"The gentlemen will stay the evening, ma\'am," was the message she\r\nbrought from Mr. Helstone.\r\n\r\n"What gentlemen have you?" now inquired Mrs. Sykes. Their names were\r\nspecified; she and her daughters interchanged glances. The curates were\r\nnot to them what they were to Caroline. Mr. Sweeting was quite a\r\nfavourite with them; even Mr. Malone rather so, because he was a\r\nclergyman. "Really, since you have company already, I think we will\r\nstay," remarked Mrs. Sykes. "We shall be quite a pleasant little party.\r\nI always like to meet the clergy."\r\n\r\nAnd now Caroline had to usher them upstairs, to help them to unshawl,\r\nsmooth their hair, and make themselves smart; to reconduct them to the\r\ndrawing-room, to distribute amongst them books of engravings, or odd\r\nthings purchased from the Jew-basket. She was obliged to be a purchaser,\r\nthough she was but a slack contributor; and if she had possessed plenty\r\nof money, she would rather, when it was brought to the rectory--an awful\r\nincubus!--have purchased the whole stock than contributed a single\r\npin-cushion.\r\n\r\nIt ought perhaps to be explained in passing, for the benefit of those\r\nwho are not _au fait_ to the mysteries of the "Jew-basket" and\r\n"missionary-basket," that these _meubles_ are willow repositories, of\r\nthe capacity of a good-sized family clothes-basket, dedicated to the\r\npurpose of conveying from house to house a monster collection of\r\npin-cushions, needle-books, card-racks, workbags, articles of infant\r\nwear, etc., etc., etc., made by the willing or reluctant hands of the\r\nChristian ladies of a parish, and sold perforce to the heathenish\r\ngentlemen thereof, at prices unblushingly exorbitant. The proceeds of\r\nsuch compulsory sales are applied to the conversion of the Jews, the\r\nseeking up of the ten missing tribes, or to the regeneration of the\r\ninteresting coloured population of the globe. Each lady contributor\r\ntakes it in her turn to keep the basket a month, to sew for it, and to\r\nfoist off its contents on a shrinking male public. An exciting time it\r\nis when that turn comes round. Some active-minded woman, with a good\r\ntrading spirit, like it, and enjoy exceedingly the fun of making\r\nhard-handed worsted-spinners cash up, to the tune of four or five\r\nhundred per cent. above cost price, for articles quite useless to them;\r\nother feebler souls object to it, and would rather see the prince of\r\ndarkness himself at their door any morning than that phantom basket,\r\nbrought with "Mrs. Rouse\'s compliments; and please, ma\'am, she says it\'s\r\nyour turn now."\r\n\r\nMiss Helstone\'s duties of hostess performed, more anxiously than\r\ncheerily, she betook herself to the kitchen, to hold a brief\r\nprivy-council with Fanny and Eliza about the tea.\r\n\r\n"What a lot on \'em!" cried Eliza, who was cook. "And I put off the\r\nbaking to-day because I thought there would be bread plenty to fit while\r\nmorning. We shall never have enow."\r\n\r\n"Are there any tea-cakes?" asked the young mistress.\r\n\r\n"Only three and a loaf. I wish these fine folk would stay at home till\r\nthey\'re asked; and I want to finish trimming my hat" (bonnet she meant).\r\n\r\n"Then," suggested Caroline, to whom the importance of the emergency gave\r\na certain energy, "Fanny must run down to Briarfield and buy some\r\nmuffins and crumpets and some biscuits. And don\'t be cross, Eliza; we\r\ncan\'t help it now."\r\n\r\n"And which tea-things are we to have?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, the best, I suppose. I\'ll get out the silver service." And she ran\r\nupstairs to the plate-closet, and presently brought down teapot,\r\ncream-ewer, and sugar-basin.\r\n\r\n"And mun we have th\' urn?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and now get it ready as quickly as you can, for the sooner we have\r\ntea over the sooner they will go--at least, I hope so. Heigh-ho! I wish\r\nthey were gone," she sighed, as she returned to the drawing-room.\r\n"Still," she thought, as she paused at the door ere opening it, "if\r\nRobert would but come even now how bright all would be! How\r\ncomparatively easy the task of amusing these people if he were present!\r\nThere would be an interest in hearing him talk (though he never says\r\nmuch in company) and in talking in his presence. There can be no\r\ninterest in hearing any of them, or in speaking to them. How they will\r\ngabble when the curates come in, and how weary I shall grow with\r\nlistening to them! But I suppose I am a selfish fool. These are very\r\nrespectable gentlefolks. I ought, no doubt, to be proud of their\r\ncountenance. I don\'t say they are not as good as I am--far from it--but\r\nthey are different from me."\r\n\r\nShe went in.\r\n\r\nYorkshire people in those days took their tea round the table, sitting\r\nwell into it, with their knees duly introduced under the mahogany. It\r\nwas essential to have a multitude of plates of bread and butter, varied\r\nin sorts and plentiful in quantity. It was thought proper, too, that on\r\nthe centre plate should stand a glass dish of marmalade. Among the\r\nviands was expected to be found a small assortment of cheesecakes and\r\ntarts. If there was also a plate of thin slices of pink ham garnished\r\nwith green parsley, so much the better.\r\n\r\nEliza, the rector\'s cook, fortunately knew her business as provider. She\r\nhad been put out of humour a little at first, when the invaders came so\r\nunexpectedly in such strength; but it appeared that she regained her\r\ncheerfulness with action, for in due time the tea was spread forth in\r\nhandsome style, and neither ham, tarts, nor marmalade were wanting among\r\nits accompaniments.\r\n\r\nThe curates, summoned to this bounteous repast, entered joyous; but at\r\nonce, on seeing the ladies, of whose presence they had not been\r\nforewarned, they came to a stand in the doorway. Malone headed the\r\nparty; he stopped short and fell back, almost capsizing Donne, who was\r\nbehind him. Donne, staggering three paces in retreat, sent little\r\nSweeting into the arms of old Helstone, who brought up the rear. There\r\nwas some expostulation, some tittering. Malone was desired to mind what\r\nhe was about, and urged to push forward, which at last he did, though\r\ncolouring to the top of his peaked forehead a bluish purple. Helstone,\r\nadvancing, set the shy curates aside, welcomed all his fair guests,\r\nshook hands and passed a jest with each, and seated himself snugly\r\nbetween the lovely Harriet and the dashing Hannah. Miss Mary he\r\nrequested to move to the seat opposite to him, that he might see her if\r\nhe couldn\'t be near her. Perfectly easy and gallant, in his way, were\r\nhis manners always to young ladies, and most popular was he amongst\r\nthem; yet at heart he neither respected nor liked the sex, and such of\r\nthem as circumstances had brought into intimate relation with him had\r\never feared rather than loved him.\r\n\r\nThe curates were left to shift for themselves. Sweeting, who was the\r\nleast embarrassed of the three, took refuge beside Mrs. Sykes, who, he\r\nknew, was almost as fond of him as if he had been her son. Donne, after\r\nmaking his general bow with a grace all his own, and saying in a high,\r\npragmatical voice, "How d\'ye do, Miss Helstone?" dropped into a seat at\r\nCaroline\'s elbow, to her unmitigated annoyance, for she had a peculiar\r\nantipathy to Donne, on account of his stultified and immovable\r\nself-conceit and his incurable narrowness of mind. Malone, grinning most\r\nunmeaningly, inducted himself into the corresponding seat on the other\r\nside. She was thus blessed in a pair of supporters, neither of whom, she\r\nknew, would be of any mortal use, whether for keeping up the\r\nconversation, handing cups, circulating the muffins, or even lifting the\r\nplate from the slop-basin. Little Sweeting, small and boyish as he was,\r\nwould have been worth twenty of them.\r\n\r\nMalone, though a ceaseless talker when there were only men present, was\r\nusually tongue-tied in the presence of ladies. Three phrases, however,\r\nhe had ready cut and dried, which he never failed to produce:--\r\n\r\n1stly. "Have you had a walk to-day, Miss Helstone?"\r\n\r\n2ndly. "Have you seen your cousin Moore lately?"\r\n\r\n3rdly. "Does your class at the Sunday school keep up its number?"\r\n\r\nThese three questions being put and responded to, between Caroline and\r\nMalone reigned silence.\r\n\r\nWith Donne it was otherwise; he was troublesome, exasperating. He had a\r\nstock of small-talk on hand, at once the most trite and perverse that\r\ncan well be imagined--abuse of the people of Briarfield; of the natives\r\nof Yorkshire generally; complaints of the want of high society; of the\r\nbackward state of civilization in these districts; murmurings against\r\nthe disrespectful conduct of the lower orders in the north toward their\r\nbetters; silly ridicule of the manner of living in these parts--the want\r\nof style, the absence of elegance, as if he, Donne, had been accustomed\r\nto very great doings indeed, an insinuation which his somewhat underbred\r\nmanner and aspect failed to bear out. These strictures, he seemed to\r\nthink, must raise him in the estimation of Miss Helstone or of any other\r\nlady who heard him; whereas with her, at least, they brought him to a\r\nlevel below contempt, though sometimes, indeed, they incensed her; for,\r\na Yorkshire girl herself, she hated to hear Yorkshire abused by such a\r\npitiful prater; and when wrought up to a certain pitch, she would turn\r\nand say something of which neither the matter nor the manner recommended\r\nher to Mr. Donne\'s good-will. She would tell him it was no proof of\r\nrefinement to be ever scolding others for vulgarity, and no sign of a\r\ngood pastor to be eternally censuring his flock. She would ask him what\r\nhe had entered the church for, since he complained there were only\r\ncottages to visit, and poor people to preach to--whether he had been\r\nordained to the ministry merely to wear soft clothing and sit in king\'s\r\nhouses. These questions were considered by all the curates as, to the\r\nlast degree, audacious and impious.\r\n\r\nTea was a long time in progress; all the guests gabbled as their hostess\r\nhad expected they would. Mr. Helstone, being in excellent spirits--when,\r\nindeed, was he ever otherwise in society, attractive female society? it\r\nbeing only with the one lady of his own family that he maintained a grim\r\ntaciturnity--kept up a brilliant flow of easy prattle with his\r\nright-hand and left-hand neighbours, and even with his _vis-\xc3\xa0-vis_, Miss\r\nMary; though, as Mary was the most sensible, the least coquettish, of\r\nthe three, to her the elderly widower was the least attentive. At heart\r\nhe could not abide sense in women. He liked to see them as silly, as\r\nlight-headed, as vain, as open to ridicule as possible, because they\r\nwere then in reality what he held them to be, and wished them to\r\nbe--inferior, toys to play with, to amuse a vacant hour, and to be\r\nthrown away.\r\n\r\nHannah was his favourite. Harriet, though beautiful, egotistical, and\r\nself-satisfied, was not quite weak enough for him. She had some genuine\r\nself-respect amidst much false pride, and if she did not talk like an\r\noracle, neither would she babble like one crazy; she would not permit\r\nherself to be treated quite as a doll, a child, a plaything; she\r\nexpected to be bent to like a queen.\r\n\r\nHannah, on the contrary, demanded no respect, only flattery. If her\r\nadmirers only _told_ her that she was an angel, she would let them\r\n_treat_ her like an idiot. So very credulous and frivolous was she, so\r\nvery silly did she become when besieged with attention, flattered and\r\nadmired to the proper degree, that there were moments when Helstone\r\nactually felt tempted to commit matrimony a second time, and to try the\r\nexperiment of taking her for his second helpmeet; but fortunately the\r\nsalutary recollection of the _ennuis_ of his first marriage, the\r\nimpression still left on him of the weight of the millstone he had once\r\nworn round his neck, the fixity of his feelings respecting the\r\ninsufferable evils of conjugal existence, operated as a check to his\r\ntenderness, suppressed the sigh heaving his old iron lungs, and\r\nrestrained him from whispering to Hannah proposals it would have been\r\nhigh fun and great satisfaction to her to hear.\r\n\r\nIt is probable she would have married him if he had asked her; her\r\nparents would have quite approved the match. To them his fifty-five\r\nyears, his bend-leather heart, could have presented no obstacles; and as\r\nhe was a rector, held an excellent living, occupied a good house, and\r\nwas supposed even to have private property (though in that the world was\r\nmistaken; every penny of the \xc2\xa35,000 inherited by him from his father had\r\nbeen devoted to the building and endowing of a new church at his native\r\nvillage in Lancashire--for he could show a lordly munificence when he\r\npleased, and if the end was to his liking, never hesitated about making\r\na grand sacrifice to attain it)--her parents, I say, would have\r\ndelivered Hannah over to his lovingkindness and his tender mercies\r\nwithout one scruple; and the second Mrs. Helstone, inverting the natural\r\norder of insect existence, would have fluttered through the honeymoon a\r\nbright, admired butterfly, and crawled the rest of her days a sordid,\r\ntrampled worm.\r\n\r\nLittle Mr. Sweeting, seated between Mrs. Sykes and Miss Mary, both of\r\nwhom were very kind to him, and having a dish of tarts before him, and\r\nmarmalade and crumpet upon his plate, looked and felt more content than\r\nany monarch. He was fond of all the Misses Sykes; they were all fond of\r\nhim. He thought them magnificent girls, quite proper to mate with one of\r\nhis inches. If he had a cause of regret at this blissful moment, it was\r\nthat Miss Dora happened to be absent--Dora being the one whom he\r\nsecretly hoped one day to call Mrs. David Sweeting, with whom he dreamt\r\nof taking stately walks, leading her like an empress through the village\r\nof Nunnely; and an empress she would have been, if size could make an\r\nempress. She was vast, ponderous. Seen from behind, she had the air of a\r\nvery stout lady of forty; but withal she possessed a good face, and no\r\nunkindly character.\r\n\r\nThe meal at last drew to a close. It would have been over long ago if\r\nMr. Donne had not persisted in sitting with his cup half full of cold\r\ntea before him, long after the rest had finished and after he himself\r\nhad discussed such allowance of viands as he felt competent to\r\nswallow--long, indeed, after signs of impatience had been manifested\r\nall round the board, till chairs were pushed back, till the talk\r\nflagged, till silence fell. Vainly did Caroline inquire repeatedly if he\r\nwould have another cup, if he would take a little hot tea, as that must\r\nbe cold, etc.; he would neither drink it nor leave it. He seemed to\r\nthink that this isolated position of his gave him somehow a certain\r\nimportance, that it was dignified and stately to be the last, that it\r\nwas grand to keep all the others waiting. So long did he linger, that\r\nthe very urn died; it ceased to hiss. At length, however, the old rector\r\nhimself, who had hitherto been too pleasantly engaged with Hannah to\r\ncare for the delay, got impatient.\r\n\r\n"For whom are we waiting?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"For me, I believe," returned Donne complacently, appearing to think it\r\nmuch to his credit that a party should thus be kept dependent on his\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\n"Tut!" cried Helstone. Then standing up, "Let us return thanks," said\r\nhe; which he did forthwith, and all quitted the table. Donne, nothing\r\nabashed, still sat ten minutes quite alone, whereupon Mr. Helstone rang\r\nthe bell for the things to be removed. The curate at length saw himself\r\nforced to empty his cup, and to relinquish the _r\xc3\xb4le_ which, he thought,\r\nhad given him such a felicitous distinction, drawing upon him such\r\nflattering general notice.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in the natural course of events (Caroline, knowing how it would\r\nbe, had opened the piano, and produced music-books in readiness), music\r\nwas asked for. This was Mr. Sweeting\'s chance for showing off. He was\r\neager to commence. He undertook, therefore, the arduous task of\r\npersuading the young ladies to favour the company with an air--a song.\r\n_Con amore_ he went through the whole business of begging, praying,\r\nresisting excuses, explaining away difficulties, and at last succeeded\r\nin persuading Miss Harriet to allow herself to be led to the instrument.\r\nThen out came the pieces of his flute (he always carried them in his\r\npocket, as unfailingly as he carried his handkerchief). They were\r\nscrewed and arranged, Malone and Donne meanwhile herding together and\r\nsneering at him, which the little man, glancing over his shoulder, saw,\r\nbut did not heed at all. He was persuaded their sarcasm all arose from\r\nenvy. They could not accompany the ladies as he could; he was about to\r\nenjoy a triumph over them.\r\n\r\nThe triumph began. Malone, much chagrined at hearing him pipe up in most\r\nsuperior style, determined to earn distinction too, if possible, and\r\nall at once assuming the character of a swain (which character he had\r\nendeavoured to enact once or twice before, but in which he had not\r\nhitherto met with the success he doubtless opined his merits deserved),\r\napproached a sofa on which Miss Helstone was seated, and depositing his\r\ngreat Irish frame near her, tried his hand (or rather tongue) at a fine\r\nspeech or two, accompanied by grins the most extraordinary and\r\nincomprehensible. In the course of his efforts to render himself\r\nagreeable, he contrived to possess himself of the two long sofa cushions\r\nand a square one; with which, after rolling them about for some time\r\nwith strange gestures, he managed to erect a sort of barrier between\r\nhimself and the object of his attentions. Caroline, quite willing that\r\nthey should be sundered, soon devised an excuse for stepping over to the\r\nopposite side of the room, and taking up a position beside Mrs. Sykes,\r\nof which good lady she entreated some instruction in a new stitch in\r\nornamental knitting, a favour readily granted; and thus Peter Augustus\r\nwas thrown out.\r\n\r\nVery sullenly did his countenance lower when he saw himself\r\nabandoned--left entirely to his own resources, on a large sofa, with the\r\ncharge of three small cushions on his hands. The fact was, he felt\r\ndisposed seriously to cultivate acquaintance with Miss Helstone, because\r\nhe thought, in common with others, that her uncle possessed money, and\r\nconcluded that, since he had no children, he would probably leave it to\r\nhis niece. G\xc3\xa9rard Moore was better instructed on this point: he had seen\r\nthe neat church that owed its origin to the rector\'s zeal and cash, and\r\nmore than once, in his inmost soul, had cursed an expensive caprice\r\nwhich crossed his wishes.\r\n\r\nThe evening seemed long to one person in that room. Caroline at\r\nintervals dropped her knitting on her lap, and gave herself up to a sort\r\nof brain-lethargy--closing her eyes and depressing her head--caused by\r\nwhat seemed to her the unmeaning hum around her,--the inharmonious,\r\ntasteless rattle of the piano keys, the squeaking and gasping notes of\r\nthe flute, the laughter and mirth of her uncle, and Hannah, and Mary,\r\nshe could not tell whence originating, for she heard nothing comic or\r\ngleeful in their discourse; and more than all, by the interminable\r\ngossip of Mrs. Sykes murmured close at her ear, gossip which rang the\r\nchanges on four subjects--her own health and that of the various\r\nmembers of her family; the missionary and Jew baskets and their\r\ncontents; the late meeting at Nunnely, and one which was expected to\r\ncome off next week at Whinbury.\r\n\r\nTired at length to exhaustion, she embraced the opportunity of Mr.\r\nSweeting coming up to speak to Mrs. Sykes to slip quietly out of the\r\napartment, and seek a moment\'s respite in solitude. She repaired to the\r\ndining-room, where the clear but now low remnant of a fire still burned\r\nin the grate. The place was empty and quiet, glasses and decanters were\r\ncleared from the table, the chairs were put back in their places, all\r\nwas orderly. Caroline sank into her uncle\'s large easy-chair, half shut\r\nher eyes, and rested herself--rested at least her limbs, her senses, her\r\nhearing, her vision--weary with listening to nothing, and gazing on\r\nvacancy. As to her mind, that flew directly to the Hollow. It stood on\r\nthe threshold of the parlour there, then it passed to the\r\ncounting-house, and wondered which spot was blessed by the presence of\r\nRobert. It so happened that neither locality had that honour; for Robert\r\nwas half a mile away from both, and much nearer to Caroline than her\r\ndeadened spirit suspected. He was at this moment crossing the\r\nchurchyard, approaching the rectory garden-gate--not, however, coming to\r\nsee his cousin, but intent solely on communicating a brief piece of\r\nintelligence to the rector.\r\n\r\nYes, Caroline; you hear the wire of the bell vibrate; it rings again for\r\nthe fifth time this afternoon. You start, and you are certain now that\r\nthis must be he of whom you dream. Why you are so certain you cannot\r\nexplain to yourself, but you know it. You lean forward, listening\r\neagerly as Fanny opens the door. Right! That is _the_ voice--low, with\r\nthe slight foreign accent, but so sweet, as you fancy. You half rise.\r\n"Fanny will tell him Mr. Helstone is with company, and then he will go\r\naway." Oh! she cannot let him go. In spite of herself, in spite of her\r\nreason, she walks half across the room; she stands ready to dart out in\r\ncase the step should retreat; but he enters the passage. "Since your\r\nmaster is engaged," he says, "just show me into the dining-room. Bring\r\nme pen and ink. I will write a short note and leave it for him."\r\n\r\nNow, having caught these words, and hearing him advance, Caroline, if\r\nthere was a door within the dining-room, would glide through it and\r\ndisappear. She feels caught, hemmed in; she dreads her unexpected\r\npresence may annoy him. A second since she would have flown to him;\r\nthat second past, she would flee from him. She cannot. There is no way\r\nof escape. The dining-room has but one door, through which now enters\r\nher cousin. The look of troubled surprise she expected to see in his\r\nface has appeared there, has shocked her, and is gone. She has stammered\r\na sort of apology:--\r\n\r\n"I only left the drawing-room a minute for a little quiet."\r\n\r\nThere was something so diffident and downcast in the air and tone with\r\nwhich she said this, any one might perceive that some saddening change\r\nhad lately passed over her prospects, and that the faculty of cheerful\r\nself-possession had left her. Mr. Moore, probably, remembered how she\r\nhad formerly been accustomed to meet him with gentle ardour and hopeful\r\nconfidence. He must have seen how the check of this morning had\r\noperated. Here was an opportunity for carrying out his new system with\r\neffect, if he chose to improve it. Perhaps he found it easier to\r\npractise that system in broad daylight, in his mill-yard, amidst busy\r\noccupations, than in a quiet parlour, disengaged, at the hour of\r\neventide. Fanny lit the candles, which before had stood unlit on the\r\ntable, brought writing materials, and left the room. Caroline was about\r\nto follow her. Moore, to act consistently, should have let her go;\r\nwhereas he stood in the doorway, and, holding out his hand, gently kept\r\nher back. He did not ask her to stay, but he would not let her go.\r\n\r\n"Shall I tell my uncle you are here?" asked she, still in the same\r\nsubdued voice.\r\n\r\n"No; I can say to you all I had to say to him. You will be my\r\nmessenger?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Robert."\r\n\r\n"Then you may just inform him that I have got a clue to the identity of\r\none, at least, of the men who broke my frames; that he belongs to the\r\nsame gang who attacked Sykes and Pearson\'s dressing-shop, and that I\r\nhope to have him in custody to-morrow. You can remember that?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes!" These two monosyllables were uttered in a sadder tone than\r\never; and as she said them she shook her head slightly and sighed. "Will\r\nyou prosecute him?"\r\n\r\n"Doubtless."\r\n\r\n"No, Robert."\r\n\r\n"And why no, Caroline?"\r\n\r\n"Because it will set all the neighbourhood against you more than ever."\r\n\r\n"That is no reason why I should not do my duty, and defend my property.\r\nThis fellow is a great scoundrel, and ought to be incapacitated from\r\nperpetrating further mischief."\r\n\r\n"But his accomplices will take revenge on you. You do not know how the\r\npeople of this country bear malice. It is the boast of some of them that\r\nthey can keep a stone in their pocket seven years, turn it at the end of\r\nthat time, keep it seven years longer, and hurl it and hit their mark\r\n\'at last.\'"\r\n\r\nMoore laughed.\r\n\r\n"A most pithy vaunt," said he--"one that redounds vastly to the credit\r\nof your dear Yorkshire friends. But don\'t fear for me, Lina. I am on my\r\nguard against these lamb-like compatriots of yours. Don\'t make yourself\r\nuneasy about me."\r\n\r\n"How can I help it? You are my cousin. If anything happened----" She\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n"Nothing will happen, Lina. To speak in your own language, there is a\r\nProvidence above all--is there not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear Robert. May He guard you!"\r\n\r\n"And if prayers have efficacy, yours will benefit me. You pray for me\r\nsometimes?"\r\n\r\n"Not _sometimes_, Robert. You, and Louis, and Hortense are _always_\r\nremembered."\r\n\r\n"So I have often imagined. It has occurred to me when, weary and vexed,\r\nI have myself gone to bed like a heathen, that another had asked\r\nforgiveness for my day, and safety for my night. I don\'t suppose such\r\nvicarial piety will avail much, but the petitions come out of a sincere\r\nbreast, from innocent lips. They should be acceptable as Abel\'s\r\noffering; and doubtless would be, if the object deserved them."\r\n\r\n"Annihilate that doubt. It is groundless."\r\n\r\n"When a man has been brought up only to make money, and lives to make\r\nit, and for nothing else, and scarcely breathes any other air than that\r\nof mills and markets, it seems odd to utter his name in a prayer, or to\r\nmix his idea with anything divine; and very strange it seems that a\r\ngood, pure heart should take him in and harbour him, as if he had any\r\nclaim to that sort of nest. If I could guide that benignant heart, I\r\nbelieve I should counsel it to exclude one who does not profess to have\r\nany higher aim in life than that of patching up his broken fortune, and\r\nwiping clean from his _bourgeois_ scutcheon the foul stain of\r\nbankruptcy."\r\n\r\nThe hint, though conveyed thus tenderly and modestly (as Caroline\r\nthought), was felt keenly and comprehended clearly.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I only think--or I _will only_ think--of you as my cousin," was\r\nthe quick answer. "I am beginning to understand things better than I\r\ndid, Robert, when you first came to England--better than I did a week, a\r\nday ago. I know it is your duty to try to get on, and that it won\'t do\r\nfor you to be romantic; but in future you must not misunderstand me if I\r\nseem friendly. You misunderstood me this morning, did you not?"\r\n\r\n"What made you think so?"\r\n\r\n"Your look--your manner."\r\n\r\n"But look at me now----"\r\n\r\n"Oh! you are different now. At present I dare speak to you."\r\n\r\n"Yet I am the same, except that I have left the tradesman behind me in\r\nthe Hollow. Your kinsman alone stands before you."\r\n\r\n"My cousin Robert--not Mr. Moore."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of Mr. Moore. Caroline----"\r\n\r\nHere the company was heard rising in the other room. The door was\r\nopened; the pony-carriage was ordered; shawls and bonnets were demanded;\r\nMr. Helstone called for his niece.\r\n\r\n"I must go, Robert."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you must go, or they will come in and find us here; and I, rather\r\nthan meet all that host in the passage, will take my departure through\r\nthe window. Luckily it opens like a door. One minute only--put down the\r\ncandle an instant--good-night. I kiss you because we are cousins, and,\r\nbeing cousins, one--two--three kisses are allowable. Caroline,\r\ngood-night."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nNOAH AND MOSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day Moore had risen before the sun, and had taken a ride to\r\nWhinbury and back ere his sister had made the caf\xc3\xa9 au lait or cut the\r\ntartines for his breakfast. What business he transacted there he kept to\r\nhimself. Hortense asked no questions: it was not her wont to comment on\r\nhis movements, nor his to render an account of them. The secrets of\r\nbusiness--complicated and often dismal mysteries--were buried in his\r\nbreast, and never came out of their sepulchre save now and then to scare\r\nJoe Scott, or give a start to some foreign correspondent. Indeed, a\r\ngeneral habit of reserve on whatever was important seemed bred in his\r\nmercantile blood.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, he went to his counting-house. Henry, Joe Scott\'s boy,\r\nbrought in the letters and the daily papers; Moore seated himself at his\r\ndesk, broke the seals of the documents, and glanced them over. They were\r\nall short, but not, it seemed, sweet--probably rather sour, on the\r\ncontrary, for as Moore laid down the last, his nostrils emitted a\r\nderisive and defiant snuff, and though he burst into no soliloquy, there\r\nwas a glance in his eye which seemed to invoke the devil, and lay\r\ncharges on him to sweep the whole concern to Gehenna. However, having\r\nchosen a pen and stripped away the feathered top in a brief spasm of\r\nfinger-fury (only finger-fury--his face was placid), he dashed off a\r\nbatch of answers, sealed them, and then went out and walked through the\r\nmill. On coming back he sat down to read his newspaper.\r\n\r\nThe contents seemed not absorbingly interesting; he more than once laid\r\nit across his knee, folded his arms, and gazed into the fire; he\r\noccasionally turned his head towards the window; he looked at intervals\r\nat his watch; in short, his mind appeared preoccupied. Perhaps he was\r\nthinking of the beauty of the weather--for it was a fine and mild\r\nmorning for the season--and wishing to be out in the fields enjoying\r\nit. The door of his counting-house stood wide open. The breeze and\r\nsunshine entered freely; but the first visitant brought no spring\r\nperfume on its wings, only an occasional sulphur-puff from the\r\nsoot-thick column of smoke rushing sable from the gaunt mill-chimney.\r\n\r\nA dark-blue apparition (that of Joe Scott, fresh from a dyeing vat)\r\nappeared momentarily at the open door, uttered the words "He\'s comed,\r\nsir," and vanished.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore raised not his eyes from the paper. A large man,\r\nbroad-shouldered and massive-limbed, clad in fustian garments and gray\r\nworsted stockings, entered, who was received with a nod, and desired to\r\ntake a seat, which he did, making the remark, as he removed his hat (a\r\nvery bad one), stowed it away under his chair, and wiped his forehead\r\nwith a spotted cotton handkerchief extracted from the hat-crown, that it\r\nwas "raight dahn warm for Febewerry." Mr. Moore assented--at least he\r\nuttered some slight sound, which, though inarticulate, might pass for an\r\nassent. The visitor now carefully deposited in the corner beside him an\r\nofficial-looking staff which he bore in his hand; this done, he\r\nwhistled, probably by way of appearing at his ease.\r\n\r\n"You have what is necessary, I suppose?" said Mr. Moore.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay! all\'s right."\r\n\r\nHe renewed his whistling, Mr. Moore his reading. The paper apparently\r\nhad become more interesting. Presently, however, he turned to his\r\ncupboard, which was within reach of his long arm, opened it without\r\nrising, took out a black bottle--the same he had produced for Malone\'s\r\nbenefit--a tumbler, and a jug, placed them on the table, and said to his\r\nguest,--\r\n\r\n"Help yourself; there\'s water in that jar in the corner."\r\n\r\n"I dunnut knaw that there\'s mich need, for all a body is dry (thirsty)\r\nin a morning," said the fustian gentleman, rising and doing as\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\n"Will you tak naught yourseln, Mr. Moore?" he inquired, as with skilled\r\nhand he mixed a portion, and having tested it by a deep draught, sank\r\nback satisfied and bland in his seat. Moore, chary of words, replied by\r\na negative movement and murmur.\r\n\r\n"Yah\'d as good," continued his visitor; "it \'uld set ye up wald a sup o\'\r\nthis stuff. Uncommon good hollands. Ye get it fro\' furrin parts, I\'se\r\nthink?"\r\n\r\n"Ay!"\r\n\r\n"Tak my advice and try a glass on\'t. Them lads \'at\'s coming \'ll keep ye\r\ntalking, nob\'dy knows how long. Ye\'ll need propping."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen Mr. Sykes this morning?" inquired Moore.\r\n\r\n"I seed him a hauf an hour--nay, happen a quarter of an hour sin\', just\r\nafore I set off. He said he aimed to come here, and I sudn\'t wonder but\r\nye\'ll have old Helstone too. I seed \'em saddling his little nag as I\r\npassed at back o\' t\' rectory."\r\n\r\nThe speaker was a true prophet, for the trot of a little nag\'s hoofs\r\nwas, five minutes after, heard in the yard. It stopped, and a well-known\r\nnasal voice cried aloud, "Boy" (probably addressing Harry Scott, who\r\nusually hung about the premises from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.), "take my horse\r\nand lead him into the stable."\r\n\r\nHelstone came in marching nimbly and erect, looking browner, keener, and\r\nlivelier than usual.\r\n\r\n"Beautiful morning, Moore. How do, my boy? Ha! whom have we here?"\r\n(turning to the personage with the staff). "Sugden! What! you\'re going\r\nto work directly? On my word, you lose no time. But I come to ask\r\nexplanations. Your message was delivered to me. Are you sure you are on\r\nthe right scent? How do you mean to set about the business? Have you got\r\na warrant?"\r\n\r\n"Sugden has."\r\n\r\n"Then you are going to seek him now? I\'ll accompany you."\r\n\r\n"You will be spared that trouble, sir; he is coming to seek me. I\'m just\r\nnow sitting in state waiting his arrival."\r\n\r\n"And who is it? One of my parishioners?"\r\n\r\nJoe Scott had entered unobserved. He now stood, a most sinister phantom,\r\nhalf his person being dyed of the deepest tint of indigo, leaning on the\r\ndesk. His master\'s answer to the rector\'s question was a smile. Joe took\r\nthe word. Putting on a quiet but pawky look, he said,--\r\n\r\n"It\'s a friend of yours, Mr. Helstone, a gentleman you often speak of."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! His name, Joe? You look well this morning."\r\n\r\n"Only the Rev. Moses Barraclough; t\' tub orator you call him sometimes,\r\nI think."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said the rector, taking out his snuff-box, and administering to\r\nhimself a very long pinch--"ah! couldn\'t have supposed it. Why, the\r\npious man never was a workman of yours, Moore. He\'s a tailor by trade."\r\n\r\n"And so much the worse grudge I owe him, for interfering and setting my\r\ndiscarded men against me."\r\n\r\n"And Moses was actually present at the battle of Stilbro\' Moor? He went\r\nthere, wooden leg and all?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, sir," said Joe; "he went there on horseback, that his leg mightn\'t\r\nbe noticed. He was the captain, and wore a mask. The rest only had their\r\nfaces blackened."\r\n\r\n"And how was he found out?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you, sir," said Joe. "T\' maister\'s not so fond of talking.\r\nI\'ve no objections. He courted Sarah, Mr. Moore\'s sarvant lass, and so\r\nit seems she would have nothing to say to him; she either didn\'t like\r\nhis wooden leg or she\'d some notion about his being a hypocrite. Happen\r\n(for women is queer hands; we may say that amang werseln when there\'s\r\nnone of \'em nigh) she\'d have encouraged him, in spite of his leg and his\r\ndeceit, just to pass time like. I\'ve known some on \'em do as mich, and\r\nsome o\' t\' bonniest and mimmest-looking, too--ay, I\'ve seen clean, trim\r\nyoung things, that looked as denty and pure as daisies, and wi\' time a\r\nbody fun\' \'em out to be nowt but stinging, venomed nettles."\r\n\r\n"Joe\'s a sensible fellow," interjected Helstone.\r\n\r\n"Howsiver, Sarah had another string to her bow. Fred Murgatroyd, one of\r\nour lads, is for her; and as women judge men by their faces--and Fred\r\nhas a middling face, while Moses is none so handsome, as we all\r\nknaw--the lass took on wi\' Fred. A two-three months sin\', Murgatroyd and\r\nMoses chanced to meet one Sunday night; they\'d both come lurking about\r\nthese premises wi\' the notion of counselling Sarah to tak a bit of a\r\nwalk wi\' them. They fell out, had a tussle, and Fred was worsted, for\r\nhe\'s young and small, and Barraclough, for all he has only one leg, is\r\nalmost as strong as Sugden there--indeed, anybody that hears him roaring\r\nat a revival or a love-feast may be sure he\'s no weakling."\r\n\r\n"Joe, you\'re insupportable," here broke in Mr. Moore. "You spin out your\r\nexplanation as Moses spins out his sermons. The long and short of it is,\r\nMurgatroyd was jealous of Barraclough; and last night, as he and a\r\nfriend took shelter in a barn from a shower, they heard and saw Moses\r\nconferring with some associates within. From their discourse it was\r\nplain he had been the leader, not only at Stilbro\' Moor, but in the\r\nattack on Sykes\'s property. Moreover they planned a deputation to wait\r\non me this morning, which the tailor is to head, and which, in the most\r\nreligious and peaceful spirit, is to entreat me to put the accursed\r\nthing out of my tent. I rode over to Whinbury this morning, got a\r\nconstable and a warrant, and I am now waiting to give my friend the\r\nreception he deserves. Here, meantime, comes Sykes. Mr. Helstone, you\r\nmust spirit him up. He feels timid at the thoughts of prosecuting."\r\n\r\nA gig was heard to roll into the yard. Mr. Sykes entered--a tall stout\r\nman of about fifty, comely of feature, but feeble of physiognomy. He\r\nlooked anxious.\r\n\r\n"Have they been? Are they gone? Have you got him? Is it over?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Not yet," returned Moore with phlegm. "We are waiting for them."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll not come; it\'s near noon. Better give it up. It will excite bad\r\nfeeling--make a stir--cause perhaps fatal consequences."\r\n\r\n"_You_ need not appear," said Moore. "I shall meet them in the yard when\r\nthey come; _you_ can stay here."\r\n\r\n"But my name must be seen in the law proceedings. A wife and family, Mr.\r\nMoore--a wife and family make a man cautious."\r\n\r\nMoore looked disgusted. "Give way, if you please," said he; "leave me to\r\nmyself. I have no objection to act alone; only be assured you will not\r\nfind safety in submission. Your partner Pearson gave way, and conceded,\r\nand forbore. Well, that did not prevent them from attempting to shoot\r\nhim in his own house."\r\n\r\n"My dear sir, take a little wine and water," recommended Mr. Helstone.\r\nThe wine and water was hollands and water, as Mr. Sykes discovered when\r\nhe had compounded and swallowed a brimming tumbler thereof. It\r\ntransfigured him in two minutes, brought the colour back to his face,\r\nand made him at least _word_-valiant. He now announced that he hoped he\r\nwas above being trampled on by the common people; he was determined to\r\nendure the insolence of the working-classes no longer; he had considered\r\nof it, and made up his mind to go all lengths; if money and spirit could\r\nput down these rioters, they should be put down; Mr. Moore might do as\r\nhe liked, but _he_--Christie Sykes--would spend his last penny in law\r\nbefore he would be beaten; he\'d settle them, or he\'d see.\r\n\r\n"Take another glass," urged Moore.\r\n\r\nMr. Sykes didn\'t mind if he did. This was a cold morning (Sugden had\r\nfound it a warm one); it was necessary to be careful at this season of\r\nthe year--it was proper to take something to keep the damp out; he had a\r\nlittle cough already (here he coughed in attestation of the fact);\r\nsomething of this sort (lifting the black bottle) was excellent, taken\r\nmedicinally (he poured the physic into his tumbler); he didn\'t make a\r\npractice of drinking spirits in a morning, but occasionally it really\r\nwas prudent to take precautions.\r\n\r\n"Quite prudent, and take them by all means," urged the host.\r\n\r\nMr. Sykes now addressed Mr. Helstone, who stood on the hearth, his\r\nshovel-hat on his head, watching him significantly with his little, keen\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"You, sir, as a clergyman," said he, "may feel it disagreeable to be\r\npresent amidst scenes of hurry and flurry, and, I may say, peril. I dare\r\nsay your nerves won\'t stand it. You\'re a man of peace, sir; but we\r\nmanufacturers, living in the world, and always in turmoil, get quite\r\nbelligerent. Really, there\'s an ardour excited by the thoughts of danger\r\nthat makes my heart pant. When Mrs. Sykes is afraid of the house being\r\nattacked and broke open--as she is every night--I get quite excited. I\r\ncouldn\'t describe to you, sir, my feelings. Really, if anybody was to\r\ncome--thieves or anything--I believe I should enjoy it, such is my\r\nspirit."\r\n\r\nThe hardest of laughs, though brief and low, and by no means insulting,\r\nwas the response of the rector. Moore would have pressed upon the heroic\r\nmill-owner a third tumbler, but the clergyman, who never transgressed,\r\nnor would suffer others in his presence to transgress, the bounds of\r\ndecorum, checked him.\r\n\r\n"Enough is as good as a feast, is it not, Mr. Sykes?" he said; and Mr.\r\nSykes assented, and then sat and watched Joe Scott remove the bottle at\r\na sign from Helstone, with a self-satisfied simper on his lips and a\r\nregretful glisten in his eye. Moore looked as if he should have liked to\r\nfool him to the top of his bent. What would a certain young kinswoman of\r\nhis have said could she have seen her dear, good, great Robert--her\r\nCoriolanus--just now? Would she have acknowledged in that mischievous,\r\nsardonic visage the same face to which she had looked up with such love,\r\nwhich had bent over her with such gentleness last night? Was that the\r\nman who had spent so quiet an evening with his sister and his cousin--so\r\nsuave to one, so tender to the other--reading Shakespeare and listening\r\nto Ch\xc3\xa9nier?\r\n\r\nYes, it was the same man, only seen on a different side--a side Caroline\r\nhad not yet fairly beheld, though perhaps she had enough sagacity\r\nfaintly to suspect its existence. Well, Caroline had, doubtless, her\r\ndefective side too. She was human. She must, then, have been very\r\nimperfect; and had she seen Moore on his very worst side, she would\r\nprobably have said this to herself and excused him. Love can excuse\r\nanything except meanness; but meanness kills love, cripples even natural\r\naffection; without esteem true love cannot exist. Moore, with all his\r\nfaults, might be esteemed; for he had no moral scrofula in his mind, no\r\nhopeless polluting taint--such, for instance, as that of falsehood;\r\nneither was he the slave of his appetites. The active life to which he\r\nhad been born and bred had given him something else to do than to join\r\nthe futile chase of the pleasure-hunter. He was a man undegraded, the\r\ndisciple of reason, _not_ the votary of sense. The same might be said of\r\nold Helstone. Neither of these two would look, think, or speak a lie;\r\nfor neither of them had the wretched black bottle, which had just been\r\nput away, any charms. Both might boast a valid claim to the proud title\r\nof "lord of the creation," for no animal vice was lord of them; they\r\nlooked and were superior beings to poor Sykes.\r\n\r\nA sort of gathering and trampling sound was heard in the yard, and then\r\na pause. Moore walked to the window; Helstone followed. Both stood on\r\none side, the tall junior behind the under-sized senior, looking forth\r\ncarefully, so that they might not be visible from without. Their sole\r\ncomment on what they saw was a cynical smile flashed into each other\'s\r\nstern eyes.\r\n\r\nA flourishing oratorical cough was now heard, followed by the\r\ninterjection "Whisht!" designed, as it seemed, to still the hum of\r\nseveral voices. Moore opened his casement an inch or two to admit sound\r\nmore freely.\r\n\r\n"Joseph Scott," began a snuffling voice--Scott was standing sentinel at\r\nthe counting-house door--"might we inquire if your master be within, and\r\nis to be spoken to?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s within, ay," said Joe nonchalantly.\r\n\r\n"Would you then, if _you_ please" (emphasis on "you"), "have the\r\ngoodness to tell _him_ that twelve gentlemen wants to see him."\r\n\r\n"He\'d happen ax what for," suggested Joe. "I mught as weel tell him that\r\nat t\' same time."\r\n\r\n"For a purpose," was the answer. Joe entered.\r\n\r\n"Please, sir, there\'s twelve gentlemen wants to see ye, \'for a\r\npurpose.\'"\r\n\r\n"Good, Joe; I\'m their man.--Sugden, come when I whistle."\r\n\r\nMoore went out, chuckling dryly. He advanced into the yard, one hand in\r\nhis pocket, the other in his waistcoat, his cap brim over his eyes,\r\nshading in some measure their deep dancing ray of scorn. Twelve men\r\nwaited in the yard, some in their shirt-sleeves, some in blue aprons.\r\nTwo figured conspicuously in the van of the party. One, a little dapper\r\nstrutting man with a turned-up nose; the other a broad-shouldered\r\nfellow, distinguished no less by his demure face and cat like, trustless\r\neyes than by a wooden leg and stout crutch. There was a kind of leer\r\nabout his lips; he seemed laughing in his sleeve at some person or\r\nthing; his whole air was anything but that of a true man.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, Mr. Barraclough," said Moore debonairly, for him.\r\n\r\n"Peace be unto you!" was the answer, Mr. Barraclough entirely closing\r\nhis naturally half-shut eyes as he delivered it.\r\n\r\n"I\'m obliged to you. Peace is an excellent thing; there\'s nothing I more\r\nwish for myself. But that is not all you have to say to me, I suppose? I\r\nimagine peace is not your purpose?"\r\n\r\n"As to our purpose," began Barraclough, "it\'s one that may sound strange\r\nand perhaps foolish to ears like yours, for the childer of this world is\r\nwiser in their generation than the childer of light."\r\n\r\n"To the point, if you please, and let me hear what it is."\r\n\r\n"Ye\'se hear, sir. If I cannot get it off, there\'s eleven behint can help\r\nme. It is a grand purpose, and" (changing his voice from a half-sneer to\r\na whine) "it\'s the Looard\'s own purpose, and that\'s better."\r\n\r\n"Do you want a subscription to a new Ranter\'s chapel, Mr. Barraclough?\r\nUnless your errand be something of that sort, I cannot see what you have\r\nto do with it."\r\n\r\n"I hadn\'t that duty on my mind, sir; but as Providence has led ye to\r\nmention the subject, I\'ll make it i\' my way to tak ony trifle ye may\r\nhave to spare; the smallest contribution will be acceptable."\r\n\r\nWith that he doffed his hat, and held it out as a begging-box, a brazen\r\ngrin at the same time crossing his countenance.\r\n\r\n"If I gave you sixpence you would drink it."\r\n\r\nBarraclough uplifted the palms of his hands and the whites of his eyes,\r\nevincing in the gesture a mere burlesque of hypocrisy.\r\n\r\n"You seem a fine fellow," said Moore, quite coolly and dryly; "you don\'t\r\ncare for showing me that you are a double-dyed hypocrite, that your\r\ntrade is fraud. You expect indeed to make me laugh at the cleverness\r\nwith which you play your coarsely farcical part, while at the same time\r\nyou think you are deceiving the men behind you."\r\n\r\nMoses\' countenance lowered. He saw he had gone too far. He was going to\r\nanswer, when the second leader, impatient of being hitherto kept in the\r\nbackground, stepped forward. This man did not look like a traitor,\r\nthough he had an exceedingly self-confident and conceited air.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Moore," commenced he, speaking also in his throat and nose, and\r\nenunciating each word very slowly, as if with a view to giving his\r\naudience time to appreciate fully the uncommon elegance of the\r\nphraseology, "it might, perhaps, justly be said that reason rather than\r\npeace is our purpose. We come, in the first place, to request you to\r\nhear reason; and should _you_ refuse, it is my duty to warn _you_, in\r\nvery decided terms, that measures will be had resort to" (he meant\r\nrecourse) "which will probably terminate in--in bringing _you_ to a\r\nsense of the unwisdom, of the--the foolishness which seems to guide and\r\nguard your proceedings as a tradesman in this manufacturing part of the\r\ncountry. Hem! Sir, I would beg to allude that as a furriner, coming from\r\na distant coast, another quarter and hemisphere of this globe, thrown,\r\nas I may say, a perfect outcast on these shores--the cliffs of\r\nAlbion--you have not that understanding of huz and wer ways which might\r\nconduce to the benefit of the working-classes. If, to come at once to\r\npartic\'lars, you\'d consider to give up this here miln, and go without\r\nfurther protractions straight home to where you belong, it \'ud happen be\r\nas well. I can see naught ageean such a plan.--What hev ye to say\r\ntull\'t, lads?" turning round to the other members of the deputation,\r\nwho responded unanimously, "Hear, hear!"\r\n\r\n"Brayvo, Noah o\' Tim\'s!" murmured Joe Scott, who stood behind Mr. Moore.\r\n"Moses\'ll niver beat that. Cliffs o\' Albion, and t\' other hemisphere! My\r\ncerty! Did ye come fro\' th\' Antarctic Zone, maister? Moses is dished."\r\n\r\nMoses, however, refused to be dished. He thought he would try again.\r\nCasting a somewhat ireful glance at "Noah o\' Tim\'s," he launched out in\r\nhis turn; and now he spoke in a serious tone, relinquishing the sarcasm\r\nwhich he found had not answered.\r\n\r\n"Or iver you set up the pole o\' your tent amang us, Mr. Moore, we lived\r\ni\' peace and quietness--yea, I may say, in all loving-kindness. I am not\r\nmyself an aged person as yet, but I can remember as far back as maybe\r\nsome twenty year, when hand-labour were encouraged and respected, and no\r\nmischief-maker had ventured to introduce these here machines which is so\r\npernicious. Now, I\'m not a cloth-dresser myself, but by trade a tailor.\r\nHowsiver, my heart is of a softish nature. I\'m a very feeling man, and\r\nwhen I see my brethren oppressed, like my great namesake of old, I stand\r\nup for \'em; for which intent I this day speak with you face to face, and\r\nadvises you to part wi\' your infernal machinery, and tak on more hands."\r\n\r\n"What if I don\'t follow your advice, Mr. Barraclough?"\r\n\r\n"The Looard pardon you! The Looard soften your heart, sir!"\r\n\r\n"Are you in connection with the Wesleyans now, Mr. Barraclough?"\r\n\r\n"Praise God! Bless His name! I\'m a joined Methody!"\r\n\r\n"Which in no respect prevents you from being at the same time a drunkard\r\nand a swindler. I saw you one night a week ago laid dead-drunk by the\r\nroadside, as I returned from Stilbro\' market; and while you preach\r\npeace, you make it the business of your life to stir up dissension. You\r\nno more sympathize with the poor who are in distress than you sympathize\r\nwith me. You incite them to outrage for bad purposes of your own; so\r\ndoes the individual called Noah of Tim\'s. You two are restless,\r\nmeddling, impudent scoundrels, whose chief motive-principle is a selfish\r\nambition, as dangerous as it is puerile. The persons behind you are some\r\nof them honest though misguided men; but you two I count altogether\r\nbad."\r\n\r\nBarraclough was going to speak.\r\n\r\n"Silence! You have had your say, and now I will have mine. As to being\r\ndictated to by you, or any Jack, Jem, or Jonathan on earth, I shall not\r\nsuffer it for a moment. You desire me to quit the country; you request\r\nme to part with my machinery. In case I refuse, you threaten me. I _do_\r\nrefuse--point-blank! Here I stay, and by this mill I stand, and into it\r\nwill I convey the best machinery inventors can furnish. What will you\r\ndo? The utmost you _can_ do--and this you will never _dare_ to do--is to\r\nburn down my mill, destroy its contents, and shoot me. What then?\r\nSuppose that building was a ruin and I was a corpse--what then, you lads\r\nbehind these two scamps? Would that stop invention or exhaust science?\r\nNot for the fraction of a second of time! Another and better gig-mill\r\nwould rise on the ruins of this, and perhaps a more enterprising owner\r\ncome in my place. Hear me! I\'ll make my cloth as I please, and according\r\nto the best lights I have. In its manufacture I will employ what means I\r\nchoose. Whoever, after hearing this, shall dare to interfere with me may\r\njust take the consequences. An example shall prove I\'m in earnest."\r\n\r\nHe whistled shrill and loud. Sugden, his staff and warrant, came on the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nMoore turned sharply to Barraclough. "You were at Stilbro\'," said he; "I\r\nhave proof of that. You were on the moor, you wore a mask, you knocked\r\ndown one of my men with your own hand--you! a preacher of the\r\ngospel!--Sugden, arrest him!"\r\n\r\nMoses was captured. There was a cry and a rush to rescue, but the right\r\nhand which all this while had lain hidden in Moore\'s breast,\r\nreappearing, held out a pistol.\r\n\r\n"Both barrels are loaded," said he. "I\'m quite determined! Keep off!"\r\n\r\nStepping backwards, facing the foe as he went, he guarded his prey to\r\nthe counting-house. He ordered Joe Scott to pass in with Sugden and the\r\nprisoner, and to bolt the door inside. For himself, he walked backwards\r\nand forwards along the front of the mill, looking meditatively on the\r\nground, his hand hanging carelessly by his side, but still holding the\r\npistol. The eleven remaining deputies watched him some time, talking\r\nunder their breath to each other. At length one of them approached. This\r\nman looked very different from either of the two who had previously\r\nspoken; he was hard-favoured, but modest and manly-looking.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not much faith i\' Moses Barraclough," said he, "and I would speak\r\na word to you myseln, Mr. Moore. It\'s out o\' no ill-will that I\'m here,\r\nfor my part; it\'s just to mak a effort to get things straightened, for\r\nthey\'re sorely a-crooked. Ye see we\'re ill off--varry ill off; wer\r\nfamilies is poor and pined. We\'re thrown out o\' work wi\' these frames;\r\nwe can get nought to do; we can earn nought. What is to be done? Mun we\r\nsay, wisht! and lig us down and dee? Nay; I\'ve no grand words at my\r\ntongue\'s end, Mr. Moore, but I feel that it wad be a low principle for a\r\nreasonable man to starve to death like a dumb cratur. I willn\'t do\'t.\r\nI\'m not for shedding blood: I\'d neither kill a man nor hurt a man; and\r\nI\'m not for pulling down mills and breaking machines--for, as ye say,\r\nthat way o\' going on\'ll niver stop invention; but I\'ll talk--I\'ll mak as\r\nbig a din as ever I can. Invention may be all right, but I know it isn\'t\r\nright for poor folks to starve. Them that governs mun find a way to help\r\nus; they mun make fresh orderations. Ye\'ll say that\'s hard to do. So\r\nmich louder mun we shout out then, for so much slacker will t\'\r\nParliament-men be to set on to a tough job."\r\n\r\n"Worry the Parliament-men as much as you please," said Moore; "but to\r\nworry the mill-owners is absurd, and I for one won\'t stand it."\r\n\r\n"Ye\'re a raight hard un!" returned the workman. "Willn\'t ye gie us a bit\r\no\' time? Willn\'t ye consent to mak your changes rather more slowly?"\r\n\r\n"Am I the whole body of clothiers in Yorkshire? Answer me that."\r\n\r\n"Ye\'re yourseln."\r\n\r\n"And only myself. And if I stopped by the way an instant, while others\r\nare rushing on, I should be trodden down. If I did as you wish me to do,\r\nI should be bankrupt in a month; and would my bankruptcy put bread into\r\nyour hungry children\'s mouths? William Farren, neither to your dictation\r\nnor to that of any other will I submit. Talk to me no more about\r\nmachinery. I will have my own way. I shall get new frames in to-morrow.\r\nIf you broke these, I would still get more. _I\'ll never give in._"\r\n\r\nHere the mill-bell rang twelve o\'clock. It was the dinner-hour. Moore\r\nabruptly turned from the deputation and re-entered his counting-house.\r\n\r\nHis last words had left a bad, harsh impression; he, at least, had\r\n"failed in the disposing of a chance he was lord of." By speaking kindly\r\nto William Farren--who was a very honest man, without envy or hatred of\r\nthose more happily circumstanced than himself, thinking it no hardship\r\nand no injustice to be forced to live by labour, disposed to be\r\nhonourably content if he could but get work to do--Moore might have made\r\na friend. It seemed wonderful how he could turn from such a man without\r\na conciliatory or a sympathizing expression. The poor fellow\'s face\r\nlooked haggard with want; he had the aspect of a man who had not known\r\nwhat it was to live in comfort and plenty for weeks, perhaps months,\r\npast, and yet there was no ferocity, no malignity in his countenance; it\r\nwas worn, dejected, austere, but still patient. How could Moore leave\r\nhim thus, with the words, "I\'ll never give in," and not a whisper of\r\ngood-will, or hope, or aid?\r\n\r\nFarren, as he went home to his cottage--once, in better times, a decent,\r\nclean, pleasant place, but now, though still clean, very dreary, because\r\nso poor--asked himself this question. He concluded that the foreign\r\nmill-owner was a selfish, an unfeeling, and, he thought, too, a foolish\r\nman. It appeared to him that emigration, had he only the means to\r\nemigrate, would be preferable to service under such a master. He felt\r\nmuch cast down--almost hopeless.\r\n\r\nOn his entrance his wife served out, in orderly sort, such dinner as she\r\nhad to give him and the bairns. It was only porridge, and too little of\r\nthat. Some of the younger children asked for more when they had done\r\ntheir portion--an application which disturbed William much. While his\r\nwife quieted them as well as she could, he left his seat and went to the\r\ndoor. He whistled a cheery stave, which did not, however, prevent a\r\nbroad drop or two (much more like the "first of a thunder-shower" than\r\nthose which oozed from the wound of the gladiator) from gathering on the\r\nlids of his gray eyes, and plashing thence to the threshold. He cleared\r\nhis vision with his sleeve, and the melting mood over, a very stern one\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nHe still stood brooding in silence, when a gentleman in black came up--a\r\nclergyman, it might be seen at once, but neither Helstone, nor Malone,\r\nnor Donne, nor Sweeting. He might be forty years old; he was\r\nplain-looking, dark-complexioned, and already rather gray-haired. He\r\nstooped a little in walking. His countenance, as he came on, wore an\r\nabstracted and somewhat doleful air; but in approaching Farren he looked\r\nup, and then a hearty expression illuminated the preoccupied, serious\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Is it you, William? How are you?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Middling, Mr. Hall. How are _ye_? Will ye step in and rest ye?"\r\n\r\nMr. Hall, whose name the reader has seen mentioned before (and who,\r\nindeed, was vicar of Nunnely, of which parish Farren was a native, and\r\nfrom whence he had removed but three years ago to reside in Briarfield,\r\nfor the convenience of being near Hollow\'s Mill, where he had obtained\r\nwork), entered the cottage, and having greeted the good-wife and the\r\nchildren, sat down. He proceeded to talk very cheerfully about the\r\nlength of time that had elapsed since the family quitted his parish, the\r\nchanges which had occurred since; he answered questions touching his\r\nsister Margaret, who was inquired after with much interest; he asked\r\nquestions in his turn, and at last, glancing hastily and anxiously round\r\nthrough his spectacles (he wore spectacles, for he was short-sighted) at\r\nthe bare room, and at the meagre and wan faces of the circle about\r\nhim--for the children had come round his knee, and the father and mother\r\nstood before him--he said abruptly,--\r\n\r\n"And how are you all? How do you get on?"\r\n\r\nMr. Hall, be it remarked, though an accomplished scholar, not only spoke\r\nwith a strong northern accent, but, on occasion, used freely\r\nnorth-country expressions.\r\n\r\n"We get on poorly," said William; "we\'re all out of work. I\'ve selled\r\nmost o\' t\' household stuff, as ye may see; and what we\'re to do next,\r\nGod knows."\r\n\r\n"Has Mr. Moore turned you off?"\r\n\r\n"He has turned us off; and I\'ve sich an opinion of him now that I think\r\nif he\'d tak me on again to-morrow I wouldn\'t work for him."\r\n\r\n"It is not like you to say so, William."\r\n\r\n"I know it isn\'t; but I\'m getting different to mysel\'; I feel I am\r\nchanging. I wadn\'t heed if t\' bairns and t\' wife had enough to live on;\r\nbut they\'re pinched--they\'re pined----"\r\n\r\n"Well, my lad, and so are you; I see you are. These are grievous times;\r\nI see suffering wherever I turn. William, sit down. Grace, sit down. Let\r\nus talk it over."\r\n\r\nAnd in order the better to talk it over, Mr. Hall lifted the least of\r\nthe children on to his knee, and placed his hand on the head of the\r\nnext least; but when the small things began to chatter to him he bade\r\nthem "Whisht!" and fixing his eyes on the grate, he regarded the handful\r\nof embers which burned there very gravely.\r\n\r\n"Sad times," he said, "and they last long. It is the will of God. His\r\nwill be done. But He tries us to the utmost."\r\n\r\nAgain he reflected.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve no money, William, and you\'ve nothing you could sell to raise a\r\nsmall sum?"\r\n\r\n"No. I\'ve selled t\' chest o\' drawers, and t\' clock, and t\' bit of a\r\nmahogany stand, and t\' wife\'s bonny tea-tray and set o\' cheeney \'at she\r\nbrought for a portion when we were wed."\r\n\r\n"And if somebody lent you a pound or two, could you make any good use of\r\nit? Could you get into a new way of doing something?"\r\n\r\nFarren did not answer, but his wife said quickly, "Ay, I\'m sure he\r\ncould, sir. He\'s a very contriving chap is our William. If he\'d two or\r\nthree pounds he could begin selling stuff."\r\n\r\n"Could you, William?"\r\n\r\n"Please God," returned William deliberately, "I could buy groceries, and\r\nbits o\' tapes, and thread, and what I thought would sell, and I could\r\nbegin hawking at first."\r\n\r\n"And you know, sir," interposed Grace, "you\'re sure William would\r\nneither drink, nor idle, nor waste, in any way. He\'s my husband, and I\r\nshouldn\'t praise him; but I _will_ say there\'s not a soberer, honester\r\nman i\' England nor he is."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll speak to one or two friends, and I think I can promise to\r\nlet him have \xc2\xa35 in a day or two--as a loan, ye mind, not a gift. He must\r\npay it back."\r\n\r\n"I understand, sir. I\'m quite agreeable to that."\r\n\r\n"Meantime, there\'s a few shillings for you, Grace, just to keep the pot\r\nboiling till custom comes.--Now, bairns, stand up in a row and say your\r\ncatechism, while your mother goes and buys some dinner; for you\'ve not\r\nhad much to-day, I\'ll be bound.--You begin, Ben. What is your name?"\r\n\r\nMr. Hall stayed till Grace came back; then he hastily took his leave,\r\nshaking hands with both Farren and his wife. Just at the door he said to\r\nthem a few brief but very earnest words of religious consolation and\r\nexhortation. With a mutual "God bless you, sir!" "God bless you, my\r\nfriends!" they separated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nBRIARMAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. Helstone and Sykes began to be extremely jocose and\r\ncongratulatory with Mr. Moore when he returned to them after dismissing\r\nthe deputation. He was so quiet, however, under their compliments upon\r\nhis firmness, etc., and wore a countenance so like a still, dark day,\r\nequally beamless and breezeless, that the rector, after glancing\r\nshrewdly into his eyes, buttoned up his felicitations with his coat, and\r\nsaid to Sykes, whose senses were not acute enough to enable him to\r\ndiscover unassisted where his presence and conversation were a nuisance,\r\n"Come, sir; your road and mine lie partly together. Had we not better\r\nbear each other company? We\'ll bid Moore good-morning, and leave him to\r\nthe happy fancies he seems disposed to indulge."\r\n\r\n"And where is Sugden?" demanded Moore, looking up.\r\n\r\n"Ah, ha!" cried Helstone. "I\'ve not been quite idle while you were busy.\r\nI\'ve been helping you a little; I flatter myself not injudiciously. I\r\nthought it better not to lose time; so, while you were parleying with\r\nthat down-looking gentleman--Farren I think his name is--I opened this\r\nback window, shouted to Murgatroyd, who was in the stable, to bring Mr.\r\nSykes\'s gig round; then I smuggled Sugden and brother Moses--wooden leg\r\nand all--through the aperture, and saw them mount the gig (always with\r\nour good friend Sykes\'s permission, of course). Sugden took the\r\nreins--he drives like Jehu--and in another quarter of an hour\r\nBarraclough will be safe in Stilbro\' jail."\r\n\r\n"Very good; thank you," said Moore; "and good-morning, gentlemen," he\r\nadded, and so politely conducted them to the door, and saw them clear of\r\nhis premises.\r\n\r\nHe was a taciturn, serious man the rest of the day. He did not even\r\nbandy a repartee with Joe Scott, who, for his part, said to his master\r\nonly just what was absolutely necessary to the progress of business,\r\nbut looked at him a good deal out of the corners of his eyes, frequently\r\ncame to poke the counting-house fire for him, and once, as he was\r\nlocking up for the day (the mill was then working short time, owing to\r\nthe slackness of trade), observed that it was a grand evening, and he\r\n"could wish Mr. Moore to take a bit of a walk up th\' Hollow. It would do\r\nhim good."\r\n\r\nAt this recommendation Mr. Moore burst into a short laugh, and after\r\ndemanding of Joe what all this solicitude meant, and whether he took him\r\nfor a woman or a child, seized the keys from his hand, and shoved him by\r\nthe shoulders out of his presence. He called him back, however, ere he\r\nhad reached the yard-gate.\r\n\r\n"Joe, do you know those Farrens? They are not well off, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"They cannot be well off, sir, when they\'ve not had work as a three\r\nmonth. Ye\'d see yoursel\' \'at William\'s sorely changed--fair paired.\r\nThey\'ve selled most o\' t\' stuff out o\' th\' house."\r\n\r\n"He was not a bad workman?"\r\n\r\n"Ye never had a better, sir, sin\' ye began trade."\r\n\r\n"And decent people--the whole family?"\r\n\r\n"Niver dacenter. Th\' wife\'s a raight cant body, and as clean--ye mught\r\neat your porridge off th\' house floor. They\'re sorely comed down. I wish\r\nWilliam could get a job as gardener or summat i\' that way; he\r\nunderstands gardening weel. He once lived wi\' a Scotchman that tached\r\nhim the mysteries o\' that craft, as they say."\r\n\r\n"Now, then, you can go, Joe. You need not stand there staring at me."\r\n\r\n"Ye\'ve no orders to give, sir?"\r\n\r\n"None, but for you to take yourself off."\r\n\r\nWhich Joe did accordingly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSpring evenings are often cold and raw, and though this had been a fine\r\nday, warm even in the morning and meridian sunshine, the air chilled at\r\nsunset, the ground crisped, and ere dusk a hoar frost was insidiously\r\nstealing over growing grass and unfolding bud. It whitened the pavement\r\nin front of Briarmains (Mr. Yorke\'s residence), and made silent havoc\r\namong the tender plants in his garden, and on the mossy level of his\r\nlawn. As to that great tree, strong-trunked and broad-armed, which\r\nguarded the gable nearest the road, it seemed to defy a spring-night\r\nfrost to harm its still bare boughs; and so did the leafless grove of\r\nwalnut-trees rising tall behind the house.\r\n\r\nIn the dusk of the moonless if starry night, lights from windows shone\r\nvividly. This was no dark or lonely scene, nor even a silent one.\r\nBriarmains stood near the highway. It was rather an old place, and had\r\nbeen built ere that highway was cut, and when a lane winding up through\r\nfields was the only path conducting to it. Briarfield lay scarce a mile\r\noff; its hum was heard, its glare distinctly seen. Briar Chapel, a\r\nlarge, new, raw Wesleyan place of worship, rose but a hundred yards\r\ndistant; and as there was even now a prayer-meeting being held within\r\nits walls, the illumination of its windows cast a bright reflection on\r\nthe road, while a hymn of a most extraordinary description, such as a\r\nvery Quaker might feel himself moved by the Spirit to dance to, roused\r\ncheerily all the echoes of the vicinage. The words were distinctly\r\naudible by snatches. Here is a quotation or two from different strains;\r\nfor the singers passed jauntily from hymn to hymn and from tune to tune,\r\nwith an ease and buoyancy all their own:--\r\n\r\n    "Oh! who can explain\r\n       This struggle for life,\r\n     This travail and pain,\r\n       This trembling and strife?\r\n     Plague, earthquake, and famine,\r\n       And tumult and war,\r\n     The wonderful coming\r\n       Of Jesus declare!\r\n\r\n    "For every fight\r\n       Is dreadful and loud:\r\n     The warrior\'s delight\r\n       Is slaughter and blood,\r\n     His foes overturning,\r\n       Till all shall expire:\r\n     And this is with burning,\r\n       And fuel, and fire!"\r\n\r\nHere followed an interval of clamorous prayer, accompanied by fearful\r\ngroans. A shout of "I\'ve found liberty!" "Doad o\' Bill\'s has fun\'\r\nliberty!" rang from the chapel, and out all the assembly broke again.\r\n\r\n    "What a mercy is this!\r\n      What a heaven of bliss!\r\n    How unspeakably happy am I!\r\n      Gathered into the fold,\r\n      With Thy people enrolled,\r\n    With Thy people to live and to die!\r\n\r\n    "Oh, the goodness of God\r\n      In employing a clod\r\n    His tribute of glory to raise;\r\n      His standard to bear,\r\n      And with triumph declare\r\n    His unspeakable riches of grace!\r\n\r\n    "Oh, the fathomless love\r\n      That has deigned to approve\r\n    And prosper the work of my hands.\r\n      With my pastoral crook\r\n      I went over the brook,\r\n    And behold I am spread into bands!\r\n\r\n    "Who, I ask in amaze,\r\n      Hath begotten me these?\r\n    And inquire from what quarter they came.\r\n      My full heart it replies,\r\n      They are born from the skies,\r\n    And gives glory to God and the Lamb!"\r\n\r\nThe stanza which followed this, after another and longer interregnum of\r\nshouts, yells, ejaculations, frantic cries, agonized groans, seemed to\r\ncap the climax of noise and zeal.\r\n\r\n    "Sleeping on the brink of sin,\r\n     Tophet gaped to take us in;\r\n     Mercy to our rescue flew,\r\n     Broke the snare, and brought us through.\r\n\r\n    "Here, as in a lion\'s den,\r\n     Undevoured we still remain,\r\n     Pass secure the watery flood,\r\n     Hanging on the arm of God.\r\n\r\n    "Here----"\r\n\r\n(Terrible, most distracting to the ear, was the strained shout in which\r\nthe last stanza was given.)\r\n\r\n    "Here we raise our voices higher,\r\n     Shout in the refiner\'s fire,\r\n     Clap our hands amidst the flame,\r\n     Glory give to Jesus\' name!"\r\n\r\nThe roof of the chapel did _not_ fly off, which speaks volumes in praise\r\nof its solid slating.\r\n\r\nBut if Briar Chapel seemed alive, so also did Briarmains, though\r\ncertainly the mansion appeared to enjoy a quieter phase of existence\r\nthan the temple. Some of its windows too were aglow; the lower casements\r\nopened upon the lawn; curtains concealed the interior, and partly\r\nobscured the ray of the candles which lit it, but they did not entirely\r\nmuffle the sound of voice and laughter. We are privileged to enter that\r\nfront door, and to penetrate to the domestic sanctum.\r\n\r\nIt is not the presence of company which makes Mr. Yorke\'s habitation\r\nlively, for there is none within it save his own family, and they are\r\nassembled in that farthest room to the right, the back parlour.\r\n\r\nThis is the usual sitting-room of an evening. Those windows would be\r\nseen by daylight to be of brilliantly-stained glass, purple and amber\r\nthe predominant hues, glittering round a gravely-tinted medallion in the\r\ncentre of each, representing the suave head of William Shakespeare, and\r\nthe serene one of John Milton. Some Canadian views hung on the\r\nwalls--green forest and blue water scenery--and in the midst of them\r\nblazes a night-eruption of Vesuvius; very ardently it glows, contrasted\r\nwith the cool foam and azure of cataracts, and the dusky depths of\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nThe fire illuminating this room, reader, is such as, if you be a\r\nsouthern, you do not often see burning on the hearth of a private\r\napartment. It is a clear, hot coal fire, heaped high in the ample\r\nchimney. Mr. Yorke _will_ have such fires even in warm summer weather.\r\nHe sits beside it with a book in his hand, a little round stand at his\r\nelbow supporting a candle; but he is not reading--he is watching his\r\nchildren. Opposite to him sits his lady--a personage whom I might\r\ndescribe minutely, but I feel no vocation to the task. I see her,\r\nthough, very plainly before me--a large woman of the gravest aspect,\r\ncare on her front and on her shoulders, but not overwhelming, inevitable\r\ncare, rather the sort of voluntary, exemplary cloud and burden people\r\never carry who deem it their duty to be gloomy. Ah, well-a-day! Mrs.\r\nYorke had that notion, and grave as Saturn she was, morning, noon, and,\r\nnight; and hard things she thought if any unhappy wight--especially of\r\nthe female sex--who dared in her presence to show the light of a gay\r\nheart on a sunny countenance. In her estimation, to be mirthful was to\r\nbe profane, to be cheerful was to be frivolous. She drew no\r\ndistinctions. Yet she was a very good wife, a very careful mother,\r\nlooked after her children unceasingly, was sincerely attached to her\r\nhusband; only the worst of it was, if she could have had her will, she\r\nwould not have permitted him to have any friend in the world beside\r\nherself. All his relations were insupportable to her, and she kept them\r\nat arm\'s length.\r\n\r\nMr. Yorke and she agreed perfectly well, yet he was naturally a social,\r\nhospitable man, an advocate for family unity; and in his youth, as has\r\nbeen said, he liked none but lively, cheerful women. Why he chose her,\r\nhow they contrived to suit each other, is a problem puzzling enough, but\r\nwhich might soon be solved if one had time to go into the analysis of\r\nthe case. Suffice it here to say that Yorke had a shadowy side as well\r\nas a sunny side to his character, and that his shadowy side found\r\nsympathy and affinity in the whole of his wife\'s uniformly overcast\r\nnature. For the rest, she was a strong-minded woman; never said a weak\r\nor a trite thing; took stern, democratic views of society, and rather\r\ncynical ones of human nature; considered herself perfect and safe, and\r\nthe rest of the world all wrong. Her main fault was a brooding, eternal,\r\nimmitigable suspicion of all men, things, creeds, and parties; this\r\nsuspicion was a mist before her eyes, a false guide in her path,\r\nwherever she looked, wherever she turned.\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed that the children of such a pair were not likely to\r\nturn out quite ordinary, commonplace beings; and they were not. You see\r\nsix of them, reader. The youngest is a baby on the mother\'s knee. It is\r\nall her own yet, and that one she has not yet begun to doubt, suspect,\r\ncondemn; it derives its sustenance from her, it hangs on her, it clings\r\nto her, it loves her above everything else in the world. She is sure of\r\nthat, because, as it lives by her, it cannot be otherwise, therefore she\r\nloves it.\r\n\r\nThe two next are girls, Rose and Jessy; they are both now at their\r\nfather\'s knee; they seldom go near their mother, except when obliged to\r\ndo so. Rose, the elder, is twelve years old; she is like her father--the\r\nmost like him of the whole group--but it is a granite head copied in\r\nivory; all is softened in colour and line. Yorke himself has a harsh\r\nface--his daughter\'s is not harsh, neither is it quite pretty; it is\r\nsimple, childlike in feature; the round cheeks bloom: as to the gray\r\neyes, they are otherwise than childlike; a serious soul lights them--a\r\nyoung soul yet, but it will mature, if the body lives; and neither\r\nfather nor mother have a spirit to compare with it. Partaking of the\r\nessence of each, it will one day be better than either--stronger, much\r\npurer, more aspiring. Rose is a still, sometimes a stubborn, girl now.\r\nHer mother wants to make of her such a woman as she is herself--a woman\r\nof dark and dreary duties; and Rose has a mind full-set, thick-sown with\r\nthe germs of ideas her mother never knew. It is agony to her often to\r\nhave these ideas trampled on and repressed. She has never rebelled yet;\r\nbut if hard driven, she will rebel one day, and then it will be once for\r\nall. Rose loves her father: her father does not rule her with a rod of\r\niron; he is good to her. He sometimes fears she will not live, so bright\r\nare the sparks of intelligence which, at moments, flash from her glance\r\nand gleam in her language. This idea makes him often sadly tender to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHe has no idea that little Jessy will die young, she is so gay and\r\nchattering, arch, original even now; passionate when provoked, but most\r\naffectionate if caressed; by turns gentle and rattling; exacting, yet\r\ngenerous; fearless--of her mother, for instance, whose irrationally hard\r\nand strict rule she has often defied--yet reliant on any who will help\r\nher. Jessy, with her little piquant face, engaging prattle, and winning\r\nways, is made to be a pet, and her father\'s pet she accordingly is. It\r\nis odd that the doll should resemble her mother feature by feature, as\r\nRose resembles her father, and yet the physiognomy--how different!\r\n\r\nMr. Yorke, if a magic mirror were now held before you, and if therein\r\nwere shown you your two daughters as they will be twenty years from this\r\nnight, what would you think? The magic mirror is here: you shall learn\r\ntheir destinies--and first that of your little life, Jessy.\r\n\r\nDo you know this place? No, you never saw it; but you recognize the\r\nnature of these trees, this foliage--the cypress, the willow, the yew.\r\nStone crosses like these are not unfamiliar to you, nor are these dim\r\ngarlands of everlasting flowers. Here is the place--green sod and a gray\r\nmarble headstone. Jessy sleeps below. She lived through an April day;\r\nmuch loved was she, much loving. She often, in her brief life, shed\r\ntears, she had frequent sorrows; she smiled between, gladdening whatever\r\nsaw her. Her death was tranquil and happy in Rose\'s guardian arms, for\r\nRose had been her stay and defence through many trials. The dying and\r\nthe watching English girls were at that hour alone in a foreign\r\ncountry, and the soil of that country gave Jessy a grave.\r\n\r\nNow, behold Rose two years later. The crosses and garlands looked\r\nstrange, but the hills and woods of this landscape look still stranger.\r\nThis, indeed, is far from England; remote must be the shores which wear\r\nthat wild, luxuriant aspect. This is some virgin solitude. Unknown birds\r\nflutter round the skirts of that forest; no European river this, on\r\nwhose banks Rose sits thinking. The little quiet Yorkshire girl is a\r\nlonely emigrant in some region of the southern hemisphere. Will she ever\r\ncome back?\r\n\r\nThe three eldest of the family are all boys--Matthew, Mark, and Martin.\r\nThey are seated together in that corner, engaged in some game. Observe\r\ntheir three heads: much alike at a first glance; at a second, different;\r\nat a third, contrasted. Dark-haired, dark-eyed, red-cheeked are the\r\nwhole trio; small English features they all possess; all own a blended\r\nresemblance to sire and mother; and yet a distinctive physiognomy, mark\r\nof a separate character, belongs to each.\r\n\r\nI shall not say much about Matthew, the first-born of the house, though\r\nit is impossible to avoid gazing at him long, and conjecturing what\r\nqualities that visage hides or indicates. He is no plain-looking boy:\r\nthat jet-black hair, white brow, high-coloured cheek, those quick, dark\r\neyes, are good points in their way. How is it that, look as long as you\r\nwill, there is but one object in the room, and that the most sinister,\r\nto which Matthew\'s face seems to bear an affinity, and of which, ever\r\nand anon, it reminds you strangely--the eruption of Vesuvius? Flame and\r\nshadow seem the component parts of that lad\'s soul--no daylight in it,\r\nand no sunshine, and no pure, cool moonbeam ever shone there. He has an\r\nEnglish frame, but, apparently, not an English mind--you would say, an\r\nItalian stiletto in a sheath of British workmanship. He is crossed in\r\nthe game--look at his scowl. Mr. Yorke sees it, and what does he say? In\r\na low voice he pleads, "Mark and Martin, don\'t anger your brother." And\r\nthis is ever the tone adopted by both parents. Theoretically, they decry\r\npartiality--no rights of primogeniture are to be allowed in that house;\r\nbut Matthew is never to be vexed, never to be opposed; they avert\r\nprovocation from him as assiduously as they would avert fire from a\r\nbarrel of gunpowder. "Concede, conciliate," is their motto wherever he\r\nis concerned. The republicans are fast making a tyrant of their own\r\nflesh and blood. This the younger scions know and feel, and at heart\r\nthey all rebel against the injustice. They cannot read their parents\'\r\nmotives; they only see the difference of treatment. The dragon\'s teeth\r\nare already sown amongst Mr. Yorke\'s young olive-branches; discord will\r\none day be the harvest.\r\n\r\nMark is a bonny-looking boy, the most regular-featured of the family. He\r\nis exceedingly calm; his smile is shrewd; he can say the driest, most\r\ncutting things in the quietest of tones. Despite his tranquillity, a\r\nsomewhat heavy brow speaks temper, and reminds you that the smoothest\r\nwaters are not always the safest. Besides, he is too still, unmoved,\r\nphlegmatic, to be happy. Life will never have much joy in it for Mark.\r\nBy the time he is five-and-twenty he will wonder why people ever laugh,\r\nand think all fools who seem merry. Poetry will not exist for Mark,\r\neither in literature or in life; its best effusions will sound to him\r\nmere rant and jargon. Enthusiasm will be his aversion and contempt. Mark\r\nwill have no youth; while he looks juvenile and blooming, he will be\r\nalready middle-aged in mind. His body is now fourteen years of age, but\r\nhis soul is already thirty.\r\n\r\nMartin, the youngest of the three, owns another nature. Life may, or may\r\nnot, be brief for him, but it will certainly be brilliant. He will pass\r\nthrough all its illusions, half believe in them, wholly enjoy them, then\r\noutlive them. That boy is not handsome--not so handsome as either of his\r\nbrothers. He is plain; there is a husk upon him, a dry shell, and he\r\nwill wear it till he is near twenty, then he will put it off. About that\r\nperiod he will make himself handsome. He will wear uncouth manners till\r\nthat age, perhaps homely garments; but the chrysalis will retain the\r\npower of transfiguring itself into the butterfly, and such\r\ntransfiguration will, in due season, take place. For a space he will be\r\nvain, probably a downright puppy, eager for pleasure and desirous of\r\nadmiration, athirst, too, for knowledge. He will want all that the world\r\ncan give him, both of enjoyment and lore; he will, perhaps, take deep\r\ndraughts at each fount. That thirst satisfied, what next? I know not.\r\nMartin might be a remarkable man. Whether he will or not, the seer is\r\npowerless to predict: on that subject there has been no open vision.\r\n\r\nTake Mr. Yorke\'s family in the aggregate: there is as much mental power\r\nin those six young heads, as much originality, as much activity and\r\nvigour of brain, as--divided amongst half a dozen commonplace\r\nbroods--would give to each rather more than an average amount of sense\r\nand capacity. Mr. Yorke knows this, and is proud of his race. Yorkshire\r\nhas such families here and there amongst her hills and wolds--peculiar,\r\nracy, vigorous; of good blood and strong brain; turbulent somewhat in\r\nthe pride of their strength, and intractable in the force of their\r\nnative powers; wanting polish, wanting consideration, wanting docility,\r\nbut sound, spirited, and true-bred as the eagle on the cliff or the\r\nsteed in the steppe.\r\n\r\nA low tap is heard at the parlour door; the boys have been making such a\r\nnoise over their game, and little Jessy, besides, has been singing so\r\nsweet a Scotch song to her father--who delights in Scotch and Italian\r\nsongs, and has taught his musical little daughter some of the best--that\r\nthe ring at the outer door was not observed.\r\n\r\n"Come in," says Mrs. Yorke, in that conscientiously constrained and\r\nsolemnized voice of hers, which ever modulates itself to a funereal\r\ndreariness of tone, though the subject it is exercised upon be but to\r\ngive orders for the making of a pudding in the kitchen, to bid the boys\r\nhang up their caps in the hall, or to call the girls to their\r\nsewing--"come in!" And in came Robert Moore.\r\n\r\nMoore\'s habitual gravity, as well as his abstemiousness (for the case of\r\nspirit decanters is never ordered up when he pays an evening visit), has\r\nso far recommended him to Mrs. Yorke that she has not yet made him the\r\nsubject of private animadversions with her husband; she has not yet\r\nfound out that he is hampered by a secret intrigue which prevents him\r\nfrom marrying, or that he is a wolf in sheep\'s clothing--discoveries\r\nwhich she made at an early date after marriage concerning most of her\r\nhusband\'s bachelor friends, and excluded them from her board\r\naccordingly; which part of her conduct, indeed, might be said to have\r\nits just and sensible as well as its harsh side.\r\n\r\n"Well, is it you?" she says to Mr. Moore, as he comes up to her and\r\ngives his hand. "What are you roving about at this time of night for?\r\nYou should be at home."\r\n\r\n"Can a single man be said to have a home, madam?" he asks.\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" says Mrs. Yorke, who despises conventional smoothness quite as\r\nmuch as her husband does, and practises it as little, and whose plain\r\nspeaking on all occasions is carried to a point calculated, sometimes,\r\nto awaken admiration, but oftener alarm--"pooh! you need not talk\r\nnonsense to me; a single man can have a home if he likes. Pray, does not\r\nyour sister make a home for you?"\r\n\r\n"Not she," joined in Mr. Yorke. "Hortense is an honest lass. But when I\r\nwas Robert\'s age I had five or six sisters, all as decent and proper as\r\nshe is; but you see, Hesther, for all that it did not hinder me from\r\nlooking out for a wife."\r\n\r\n"And sorely he has repented marrying me," added Mrs. Yorke, who liked\r\noccasionally to crack a dry jest against matrimony, even though it\r\nshould be at her own expense. "He has repented it in sackcloth and\r\nashes, Robert Moore, as you may well believe when you see his\r\npunishment" (here she pointed to her children). "Who would burden\r\nthemselves with such a set of great, rough lads as those, if they could\r\nhelp it? It is not only bringing them into the world, though that is bad\r\nenough, but they are all to feed, to clothe, to rear, to settle in life.\r\nYoung sir, when you feel tempted to marry, think of our four sons and\r\ntwo daughters, and look twice before you leap."\r\n\r\n"I am not tempted now, at any rate. I think these are not times for\r\nmarrying or giving in marriage."\r\n\r\nA lugubrious sentiment of this sort was sure to obtain Mrs. Yorke\'s\r\napprobation. She nodded and groaned acquiescence; but in a minute she\r\nsaid, "I make little account of the wisdom of a Solomon of your age; it\r\nwill be upset by the first fancy that crosses you. Meantime, sit down,\r\nsir. You can talk, I suppose, as well sitting as standing?"\r\n\r\nThis was her way of inviting her guest to take a chair. He had no sooner\r\nobeyed her than little Jessy jumped from her father\'s knee and ran into\r\nMr. Moore\'s arms, which were very promptly held out to receive her.\r\n\r\n"You talk of marrying him," said she to her mother, quite indignantly,\r\nas she was lifted lightly to his knee, "and he is married now, or as\r\ngood. He promised that I should be his wife last summer, the first time\r\nhe saw me in my new white frock and blue sash. Didn\'t he, father?"\r\n(These children were not accustomed to say papa and mamma; their mother\r\nwould allow no such "namby-pamby.")\r\n\r\n"Ay, my little lassie, he promised; I\'ll bear witness. But make him say\r\nit over again now, Jessy. Such as he are only false loons."\r\n\r\n"He is not false. He is too bonny to be false," said Jessy, looking up\r\nto her tall sweetheart with the fullest confidence in his faith.\r\n\r\n"Bonny!" cried Mr. Yorke. "That\'s the reason that he should be, and\r\nproof that he is, a scoundrel."\r\n\r\n"But he looks too sorrowful to be false," here interposed a quiet voice\r\nfrom behind the father\'s chair. "If he was always laughing, I should\r\nthink he forgot promises soon, but Mr. Moore never laughs."\r\n\r\n"Your sentimental buck is the greatest cheat of all, Rose," remarked Mr.\r\nYorke.\r\n\r\n"He\'s not sentimental," said Rose.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore turned to her with a little surprise, smiling at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n"How do you know I am not sentimental, Rose?"\r\n\r\n"Because I heard a lady say you were not."\r\n\r\n"Voil\xc3\xa0, qui devient int\xc3\xa9ressant!" exclaimed Mr. Yorke, hitching his\r\nchair nearer the fire. "A lady! That has quite a romantic twang. We must\r\nguess who it is.--Rosy, whisper the name low to your father. Don\'t let\r\n_him_ hear."\r\n\r\n"Rose, don\'t be too forward to talk," here interrupted Mrs. Yorke, in\r\nher usual kill-joy fashion, "nor Jessy either. It becomes all children,\r\nespecially girls, to be silent in the presence of their elders."\r\n\r\n"Why have we tongues, then?" asked Jessy pertly; while Rose only looked\r\nat her mother with an expression that seemed to say she should take that\r\nmaxim in and think it over at her leisure. After two minutes\' grave\r\ndeliberation, she asked, "And why especially girls, mother?"\r\n\r\n"Firstly, because I say so; and secondly, because discretion and reserve\r\nare a girl\'s best wisdom."\r\n\r\n"My dear madam," observed Moore, "what you say is excellent--it reminds\r\nme, indeed, of my dear sister\'s observations; but really it is not\r\napplicable to these little ones. Let Rose and Jessy talk to me freely,\r\nor my chief pleasure in coming here is gone. I like their prattle; it\r\ndoes me good."\r\n\r\n"Does it not?" asked Jessy. "More good than if the rough lads came round\r\nyou.--You call them rough, mother, yourself."\r\n\r\n"Yes, mignonne, a thousand times more good. I have rough lads enough\r\nabout me all day long, poulet."\r\n\r\n"There are plenty of people," continued she, "who take notice of the\r\nboys. All my uncles and aunts seem to think their nephews better than\r\ntheir nieces, and when gentlemen come here to dine, it is always\r\nMatthew, and Mark, and Martin that are talked to, and never Rose and me.\r\nMr. Moore is _our_ friend, and we\'ll keep him.--But mind, Rose, he\'s not\r\nso much your friend as he is mine. He is my _particular acquaintance_;\r\nremember that!" And she held up her small hand with an admonitory\r\ngesture.\r\n\r\nRose was quite accustomed to be admonished by that small hand. Her will\r\ndaily bent itself to that of the impetuous little Jessy. She was guided,\r\noverruled by Jessy in a thousand things. On all occasions of show and\r\npleasure Jessy took the lead, and Rose fell quietly into the background;\r\nwhereas, when the disagreeables of life--its work and privations--were\r\nin question, Rose instinctively took upon her, in addition to her own\r\nshare, what she could of her sister\'s. Jessy had already settled it in\r\nher mind that she, when she was old enough, was to be married; Rose, she\r\ndecided, must be an old maid, to live with her, look after her children,\r\nkeep her house. This state of things is not uncommon between two\r\nsisters, where one is plain and the other pretty; but in this case, if\r\nthere _was_ a difference in external appearance, Rose had the advantage:\r\nher face was more regular-featured than that of the piquant little\r\nJessy. Jessy, however, was destined to possess, along with sprightly\r\nintelligence and vivacious feeling, the gift of fascination, the power\r\nto charm when, where, and whom she would. Rose was to have a fine,\r\ngenerous soul, a noble intellect profoundly cultivated, a heart as true\r\nas steel, but the manner to attract was not to be hers.\r\n\r\n"Now, Rose, tell me the name of this lady who denied that I was\r\nsentimental," urged Mr. Moore.\r\n\r\nRose had no idea of tantalization, or she would have held him a while in\r\ndoubt. She answered briefly, "I can\'t. I don\'t know her name."\r\n\r\n"Describe her to me. What was she like? Where did you see her?"\r\n\r\n"When Jessy and I went to spend the day at Whinbury with Kate and Susan\r\nPearson, who were just come home from school, there was a party at Mrs.\r\nPearson\'s, and some grown-up ladies were sitting in a corner of the\r\ndrawing-room talking about you."\r\n\r\n"Did you know none of them?"\r\n\r\n"Hannah, and Harriet, and Dora, and Mary Sykes."\r\n\r\n"Good. Were they abusing me, Rosy?"\r\n\r\n"Some of them were. They called you a misanthrope. I remember the word.\r\nI looked for it in the dictionary when I came home. It means a\r\nman-hater."\r\n\r\n"What besides?"\r\n\r\n"Hannah Sykes said you were a solemn puppy."\r\n\r\n"Better!" cried Mr. Yorke, laughing. "Oh, excellent! Hannah! that\'s the\r\none with the red hair--a fine girl, but half-witted."\r\n\r\n"She has wit enough for me, it appears," said Moore. "A solemn puppy,\r\nindeed! Well, Rose, go on."\r\n\r\n"Miss Pearson said she believed there was a good deal of affectation\r\nabout you, and that with your dark hair and pale face you looked to her\r\nlike some sort of a sentimental noodle."\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Yorke laughed. Mrs. Yorke even joined in this time. "You see\r\nin what esteem you are held behind your back," said she; "yet I believe\r\n_that_ Miss Pearson would like to catch you. She set her cap at you when\r\nyou first came into the country, old as she is."\r\n\r\n"And who contradicted her, Rosy?" inquired Moore.\r\n\r\n"A lady whom I don\'t know, because she never visits here, though I see\r\nher every Sunday at church. She sits in the pew near the pulpit. I\r\ngenerally look at her, instead of looking at my prayer-book, for she is\r\nlike a picture in our dining-room, that woman with the dove in her\r\nhand--at least she has eyes like it, and a nose too, a straight nose,\r\nthat makes all her face look, somehow, what I call clear."\r\n\r\n"And you don\'t know her!" exclaimed Jessy, in a tone of exceeding\r\nsurprise. "That\'s so like Rose. Mr. Moore, I often wonder in what sort\r\nof a world my sister lives. I am sure she does not live all her time in\r\nthis. One is continually finding out that she is quite ignorant of some\r\nlittle matter which everybody else knows. To think of her going solemnly\r\nto church every Sunday, and looking all service-time at one particular\r\nperson, and never so much as asking that person\'s name. She means\r\nCaroline Helstone, the rector\'s niece. I remember all about it. Miss\r\nHelstone was quite angry with Anne Pearson. She said, \'Robert Moore is\r\nneither affected nor sentimental; you mistake his character utterly, or\r\nrather not one of you here knows anything about it.\' Now, shall I tell\r\nyou what she is like? I can tell what people are like, and how they are\r\ndressed, better than Rose can."\r\n\r\n"Let us hear."\r\n\r\n"She is nice; she is fair; she has a pretty white slender throat; she\r\nhas long curls, not stiff ones--they hang loose and soft, their colour\r\nis brown but not dark; she speaks quietly, with a clear tone; she never\r\nmakes a bustle in moving; she often wears a gray silk dress; she is neat\r\nall over--her gowns, and her shoes, and her gloves always fit her. She\r\nis what I call a lady, and when I am as tall as she is, I mean to be\r\nlike her. Shall I suit you if I am? Will you really marry me?"\r\n\r\nMoore stroked Jessy\'s hair. For a minute he seemed as if he would draw\r\nher nearer to him, but instead he put her a little farther off.\r\n\r\n"Oh! you won\'t have me? You push me away."\r\n\r\n"Why, Jessy, you care nothing about me. You never come to see me now at\r\nthe Hollow."\r\n\r\n"Because you don\'t ask me."\r\n\r\nHereupon Mr. Moore gave both the little girls an invitation to pay him a\r\nvisit next day, promising that, as he was going to Stilbro\' in the\r\nmorning, he would buy them each a present, of what nature he would not\r\nthen declare, but they must come and see. Jessy was about to reply, when\r\none of the boys unexpectedly broke in,--\r\n\r\n"I know that Miss Helstone you have all been palavering about. She\'s an\r\nugly girl. I hate her. I hate all womenites. I wonder what they were\r\nmade for."\r\n\r\n"Martin!" said his father, for Martin it was. The lad only answered by\r\nturning his cynical young face, half-arch, half-truculent, towards the\r\npaternal chair. "Martin, my lad, thou\'rt a swaggering whelp now; thou\r\nwilt some day be an outrageous puppy. But stick to those sentiments of\r\nthine. See, I\'ll write down the words now i\' my pocket-book." (The\r\nsenior took out a morocco-covered book, and deliberately wrote therein.)\r\n"Ten years hence, Martin, if thou and I be both alive at that day, I\'ll\r\nremind thee of that speech."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll say the same then. I mean always to hate women. They\'re such\r\ndolls; they do nothing but dress themselves finely, and go swimming\r\nabout to be admired. I\'ll never marry. I\'ll be a bachelor."\r\n\r\n"Stick to it! stick to it!--Hesther" (addressing his wife), "I was like\r\nhim when I was his age--a regular misogamist; and, behold! by the time I\r\nwas three-and-twenty--being then a tourist in France and Italy, and the\r\nLord knows where--I curled my hair every night before I went to bed, and\r\nwore a ring i\' my ear, and would have worn one i\' my nose if it had been\r\nthe fashion, and all that I might make myself pleasing and charming to\r\nthe ladies. Martin will do the like."\r\n\r\n"Will I? Never! I\'ve more sense. What a guy you were, father! As to\r\ndressing, I make this vow: I\'ll never dress more finely than as you see\r\nme at present.--Mr. Moore, I\'m clad in blue cloth from top to toe, and\r\nthey laugh at me, and call me sailor at the grammar-school. I laugh\r\nlouder at them, and say they are all magpies and parrots, with their\r\ncoats one colour, and their waistcoats another, and their trousers a\r\nthird. I\'ll always wear blue cloth, and nothing but blue cloth. It is\r\nbeneath a human being\'s dignity to dress himself in parti-coloured\r\ngarments."\r\n\r\n"Ten years hence, Martin, no tailor\'s shop will have choice of colours\r\nvaried enough for thy exacting taste; no perfumer\'s stores essences\r\nexquisite enough for thy fastidious senses."\r\n\r\nMartin looked disdain, but vouchsafed no further reply. Meantime Mark,\r\nwho for some minutes had been rummaging amongst a pile of books on a\r\nside-table, took the word. He spoke in a peculiarly slow, quiet voice,\r\nand with an expression of still irony in his face not easy to describe.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Moore," said he, "you think perhaps it was a compliment on Miss\r\nCaroline Helstone\'s part to say you were not sentimental. I thought you\r\nappeared confused when my sisters told you the words, as if you felt\r\nflattered. You turned red, just like a certain vain little lad at our\r\nschool, who always thinks proper to blush when he gets a rise in the\r\nclass. For your benefit, Mr. Moore, I\'ve been looking up the word\r\n\'sentimental\' in the dictionary, and I find it to mean \'tinctured with\r\nsentiment.\' On examining further, \'sentiment\' is explained to be\r\nthought, idea, notion. A sentimental man, then, is one who has thoughts,\r\nideas, notions; an unsentimental man is one destitute of thought, idea,\r\nor notion."\r\n\r\nAnd Mark stopped. He did not smile, he did not look round for\r\nadmiration. He had said his say, and was silent.\r\n\r\n"Ma foi! mon ami," observed Mr. Moore to Yorke, "ce sont vraiment des\r\nenfants terribles, que les v\xc3\xb4tres!"\r\n\r\nRose, who had been listening attentively to Mark\'s speech, replied to\r\nhim, "There are different kinds of thoughts, ideas, and notions," said\r\nshe, "good and bad. Sentimental must refer to the bad, or Miss Helstone\r\nmust have taken it in that sense, for she was not blaming Mr. Moore; she\r\nwas defending him."\r\n\r\n"That\'s my kind little advocate!" said Moore, taking Rose\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"She was defending him," repeated Rose, "as I should have done had I\r\nbeen in her place, for the other ladies seemed to speak spitefully."\r\n\r\n"Ladies always do speak spitefully," observed Martin. "It is the nature\r\nof womenites to be spiteful."\r\n\r\nMatthew now, for the first time, opened his lips. "What a fool Martin\r\nis, to be always gabbling about what he does not understand!"\r\n\r\n"It is my privilege, as a freeman, to gabble on whatever subject I\r\nlike," responded Martin.\r\n\r\n"You use it, or rather abuse it, to such an extent," rejoined the elder\r\nbrother, "that you prove you ought to have been a slave."\r\n\r\n"A slave! a slave! That to a Yorke, and from a Yorke! This fellow," he\r\nadded, standing up at the table, and pointing across it to\r\nMatthew--"this fellow forgets, what every cottier in Briarfield knows,\r\nthat all born of our house have that arched instep under which water can\r\nflow--proof that there has not been a slave of the blood for three\r\nhundred years."\r\n\r\n"Mountebank!" said Matthew.\r\n\r\n"Lads, be silent!" exclaimed Mr. Yorke.--"Martin, you are a\r\nmischief-maker. There would have been no disturbance but for you."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! Is that correct? Did I begin, or did Matthew? Had I spoken to\r\nhim when he accused me of gabbling like a fool?"\r\n\r\n"A presumptuous fool!" repeated Matthew.\r\n\r\nHere Mrs. Yorke commenced rocking herself--rather a portentous movement\r\nwith her, as it was occasionally followed, especially when Matthew was\r\nworsted in a conflict, by a fit of hysterics.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why I should bear insolence from Matthew Yorke, or what\r\nright he has to use bad language to me," observed Martin.\r\n\r\n"He has no right, my lad; but forgive your brother until\r\nseventy-and-seven times," said Mr. Yorke soothingly.\r\n\r\n"Always alike, and theory and practice always adverse!" murmured Martin\r\nas he turned to leave the room.\r\n\r\n"Where art thou going, my son?" asked the father.\r\n\r\n"Somewhere where I shall be safe from insult, if in this house I can\r\nfind any such place."\r\n\r\nMatthew laughed very insolently. Martin threw a strange look at him, and\r\ntrembled through all his slight lad\'s frame; but he restrained himself.\r\n\r\n"I suppose there is no objection to my withdrawing?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"No. Go, my lad; but remember not to bear malice."\r\n\r\nMartin went, and Matthew sent another insolent laugh after him. Rose,\r\nlifting her fair head from Moore\'s shoulder, against which, for a\r\nmoment, it had been resting, said, as she directed a steady gaze to\r\nMatthew, "Martin is grieved, and you are glad; but I would rather be\r\nMartin than you. I dislike your nature."\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Moore, by way of averting, or at least escaping, a scene--which\r\na sob from Mrs. Yorke warned him was likely to come on--rose, and\r\nputting Jessy off his knee, he kissed her and Rose, reminding them, at\r\nthe same time, to be sure and come to the Hollow in good time to-morrow\r\nafternoon; then, having taken leave of his hostess, he said to Mr.\r\nYorke, "May I speak a word with you?" and was followed by him from the\r\nroom. Their brief conference took place in the hall.\r\n\r\n"Have you employment for a good workman?" asked Moore.\r\n\r\n"A nonsense question in these times, when you know that every master has\r\nmany good workmen to whom he cannot give full employment."\r\n\r\n"You must oblige me by taking on this man, if possible."\r\n\r\n"My lad, I can take on no more hands to oblige all England."\r\n\r\n"It does not signify; I must find him a place somewhere."\r\n\r\n"Who is he?"\r\n\r\n"William Farren."\r\n\r\n"I know William. A right-down honest man is William."\r\n\r\n"He has been out of work three months. He has a large family. We are\r\nsure they cannot live without wages. He was one of the deputation of\r\ncloth-dressers who came to me this morning to complain and threaten.\r\nWilliam did not threaten. He only asked me to give them rather more\r\ntime--to make my changes more slowly. You know I cannot do that:\r\nstraitened on all sides as I am, I have nothing for it but to push on. I\r\nthought it would be idle to palaver long with them. I sent them away,\r\nafter arresting a rascal amongst them, whom I hope to transport--a\r\nfellow who preaches at the chapel yonder sometimes."\r\n\r\n"Not Moses Barraclough?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Ah! you\'ve arrested him? Good! Then out of a scoundrel you\'re going to\r\nmake a martyr. You\'ve done a wise thing."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve done a right thing. Well, the short and the long of it is, I\'m\r\ndetermined to get Farren a place, and I reckon on you to give him one."\r\n\r\n"This is cool, however!" exclaimed Mr. Yorke. "What right have you to\r\nreckon on me to provide for your dismissed workmen? What do I know about\r\nyour Farrens and your Williams? I\'ve heard he\'s an honest man, but am I\r\nto support all the honest men in Yorkshire? You may say that would be no\r\ngreat charge to undertake; but great or little, I\'ll none of it."\r\n\r\n"Come, Mr. Yorke, what can you find for him to do?"\r\n\r\n"_I_ find! You\'ll make me use language I\'m not accustomed to use. I wish\r\nyou would go home. Here is the door; set off."\r\n\r\nMoore sat down on one of the hall chairs.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t give him work in your mill--good; but you have land. Find him\r\nsome occupation on your land, Mr. Yorke."\r\n\r\n"Bob, I thought you cared nothing about our _lourdauds de paysans_. I\r\ndon\'t understand this change."\r\n\r\n"I do. The fellow spoke to me nothing but truth and sense. I answered\r\nhim just as roughly as I did the rest, who jabbered mere gibberish. I\r\ncouldn\'t make distinctions there and then. His appearance told what he\r\nhad gone through lately clearer than his words; but where is the use of\r\nexplaining? Let him have work."\r\n\r\n"Let him have it yourself. If you are so very much in earnest, strain a\r\npoint."\r\n\r\n"If there was a point left in my affairs to strain, I would strain it\r\ntill it cracked again; but I received letters this morning which showed\r\nme pretty clearly where I stand, and it is not far off the end of the\r\nplank. My foreign market, at any rate, is gorged. If there is no\r\nchange--if there dawns no prospect of peace--if the Orders in Council\r\nare not, at least, suspended, so as to open our way in the West--I do\r\nnot know where I am to turn. I see no more light than if I were sealed\r\nin a rock, so that for me to pretend to offer a man a livelihood would\r\nbe to do a dishonest thing."\r\n\r\n"Come, let us take a turn on the front. It is a starlight night," said\r\nMr. Yorke.\r\n\r\nThey passed out, closing the front door after them, and side by side\r\npaced the frost-white pavement to and fro.\r\n\r\n"Settle about Farren at once," urged Mr. Moore. "You have large\r\nfruit-gardens at Yorke Mills. He is a good gardener. Give him work\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Well, so be it. I\'ll send for him to-morrow, and we\'ll see. And now, my\r\nlad, you\'re concerned about the condition of your affairs?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a second failure--which I may delay, but which, at this moment, I\r\nsee no way finally to avert--would blight the name of Moore completely;\r\nand you are aware I had fine intentions of paying off every debt and\r\nre-establishing the old firm on its former basis."\r\n\r\n"You want capital--that\'s all you want."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but you might as well say that breath is all a dead man wants to\r\nlive."\r\n\r\n"I know--I know capital is not to be had for the asking; and if you were\r\na married man, and had a family, like me, I should think your case\r\npretty nigh desperate; but the young and unencumbered have chances\r\npeculiar to themselves. I hear gossip now and then about your being on\r\nthe eve of marriage with this miss and that; but I suppose it is none of\r\nit true?"\r\n\r\n"You may well suppose that. I think I am not in a position to be\r\ndreaming of marriage. Marriage! I cannot bear the word; it sounds so\r\nsilly and utopian. I have settled it decidedly that marriage and love\r\nare superfluities, intended only for the rich, who live at ease, and\r\nhave no need to take thought for the morrow; or desperations--the last\r\nand reckless joy of the deeply wretched, who never hope to rise out of\r\nthe slough of their utter poverty."\r\n\r\n"I should not think so if I were circumstanced as you are. I should\r\nthink I could very likely get a wife with a few thousands, who would\r\nsuit both me and my affairs."\r\n\r\n"I wonder where?"\r\n\r\n"Would you try if you had a chance?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. It depends on--in short, it depends on many things."\r\n\r\n"Would you take an old woman?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather break stones on the road."\r\n\r\n"So would I. Would you take an ugly one?"\r\n\r\n"Bah! I hate ugliness and delight in beauty. My eyes and heart, Yorke,\r\ntake pleasure in a sweet, young, fair face, as they are repelled by a\r\ngrim, rugged, meagre one. Soft delicate lines and hues please, harsh\r\nones prejudice me. I won\'t have an ugly wife."\r\n\r\n"Not if she were rich?"\r\n\r\n"Not if she were dressed in gems. I could not love--I could not fancy--I\r\ncould not endure her. My taste must have satisfaction, or disgust would\r\nbreak out in despotism, or worse--freeze to utter iciness."\r\n\r\n"What! Bob, if you married an honest, good-natured, and wealthy lass,\r\nthough a little hard-favoured, couldn\'t you put up with the high\r\ncheek-bones, the rather wide mouth, and reddish hair?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll never try, I tell you. Grace at least I _will_ have, and youth and\r\nsymmetry--yes, and what I call beauty."\r\n\r\n"And poverty, and a nursery full of bairns you can neither clothe nor\r\nfeed, and very soon an anxious, faded mother; and then bankruptcy,\r\ndiscredit--a life-long struggle."\r\n\r\n"Let me alone, Yorke."\r\n\r\n"If you are romantic, Robert, and especially if you are already in love,\r\nit is of no use talking."\r\n\r\n"I am not romantic. I am stripped of romance as bare as the white\r\ntenters in that field are of cloth."\r\n\r\n"Always use such figures of speech, lad; I can understand them. And\r\nthere is no love affair to disturb your judgment?"\r\n\r\n"I thought I had said enough on that subject before. Love for me?\r\nStuff!"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, if you are sound both in heart and head, there is no\r\nreason why you should not profit by a good chance if it offers;\r\ntherefore, wait and see."\r\n\r\n"You are quite oracular, Yorke."\r\n\r\n"I think I am a bit i\' that line. I promise ye naught and I advise ye\r\nnaught; but I bid ye keep your heart up, and be guided by\r\ncircumstances."\r\n\r\n"My namesake the physician\'s almanac could not speak more guardedly."\r\n\r\n"In the meantime, I care naught about ye, Robert Moore: ye are nothing\r\nakin to me or mine, and whether ye lose or find a fortune it maks no\r\ndifference to me. Go home, now. It has stricken ten. Miss Hortense will\r\nbe wondering where ye are."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nOLD MAIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTime wore on, and spring matured. The surface of England began to look\r\npleasant: her fields grew green, her hills fresh, her gardens blooming;\r\nbut at heart she was no better. Still her poor were wretched, still\r\ntheir employers were harassed. Commerce, in some of its branches, seemed\r\nthreatened with paralysis, for the war continued; England\'s blood was\r\nshed and her wealth lavished--all, it seemed, to attain most inadequate\r\nends. Some tidings there were indeed occasionally of successes in the\r\nPeninsula, but these came in slowly; long intervals occurred between, in\r\nwhich no note was heard but the insolent self-felicitations of Bonaparte\r\non his continued triumphs. Those who suffered from the results of the\r\nwar felt this tedious, and, as they thought, hopeless struggle against\r\nwhat their fears or their interests taught them to regard as an\r\ninvincible power, most insufferable. They demanded peace on any terms.\r\nMen like Yorke and Moore--and there were thousands whom the war placed\r\nwhere it placed them, shuddering on the verge of bankruptcy--insisted on\r\npeace with the energy of desperation.\r\n\r\nThey held meetings, they made speeches, they got up petitions to extort\r\nthis boon; on what terms it was made they cared not.\r\n\r\nAll men, taken singly, are more or less selfish; and taken in bodies,\r\nthey are intensely so. The British merchant is no exception to this\r\nrule: the mercantile classes illustrate it strikingly. These classes\r\ncertainly think too exclusively of making money; they are too oblivious\r\nof every national consideration but that of extending England\'s--that\r\nis, their own--commerce. Chivalrous feeling, disinterestedness, pride in\r\nhonour, is too dead in their hearts. A land ruled by them alone would\r\ntoo often make ignominious submission--not at all from the motives\r\nChrist teaches, but rather from those Mammon instils. During the late\r\nwar, the tradesmen of England would have endured buffets from the\r\nFrench on the right cheek and on the left; their cloak they would have\r\ngiven to Napoleon, and then have politely offered him their coat also,\r\nnor would they have withheld their waistcoat if urged; they would have\r\nprayed permission only to retain their one other garment, for the sake\r\nof the purse in its pocket. Not one spark of spirit, not one symptom of\r\nresistance, would they have shown till the hand of the Corsican bandit\r\nhad grasped that beloved purse; _then_, perhaps, transfigured at once\r\ninto British bulldogs, they would have sprung at the robber\'s throat,\r\nand there they would have fastened, and there hung, inveterate,\r\ninsatiable, till the treasure had been restored. Tradesmen, when they\r\nspeak against war, always profess to hate it because it is a bloody and\r\nbarbarous proceeding. You would think, to hear them talk, that they are\r\npeculiarly civilized--especially gentle and kindly of disposition to\r\ntheir fellow-men. This is not the case. Many of them are extremely\r\nnarrow and cold-hearted; have no good feeling for any class but their\r\nown; are distant, even hostile, to all others; call them useless; seem\r\nto question their right to exist; seem to grudge them the very air they\r\nbreathe, and to think the circumstance of their eating, drinking, and\r\nliving in decent houses quite unjustifiable. They do not know what\r\nothers do in the way of helping, pleasing, or teaching their race; they\r\nwill not trouble themselves to inquire. Whoever is not in trade is\r\naccused of eating the bread of idleness, of passing a useless existence.\r\nLong may it be ere England really becomes a nation of shop-keepers!\r\n\r\nWe have already said that Moore was no self-sacrificing patriot, and we\r\nhave also explained what circumstances rendered him specially prone to\r\nconfine his attention and efforts to the furtherance of his individual\r\ninterest; accordingly, when he felt himself urged a second time to the\r\nbrink of ruin, none struggled harder than he against the influences\r\nwhich would have thrust him over. What he _could_ do towards stirring\r\nagitation in the north against the war he did, and he instigated others\r\nwhose money and connections gave them more power than he possessed.\r\nSometimes, by flashes, he felt there was little reason in the demands\r\nhis party made on Government. When he heard of all Europe threatened by\r\nBonaparte, and of all Europe arming to resist him; when he saw Russia\r\nmenaced, and beheld Russia rising, incensed and stern, to defend her\r\nfrozen soil, her wild provinces of serfs, her dark native despotism,\r\nfrom the tread, the yoke, the tyranny of a foreign victor--he knew that\r\nEngland, a free realm, could not _then_ depute her sons to make\r\nconcessions and propose terms to the unjust, grasping French leader.\r\nWhen news came from time to time of the movements of that MAN then\r\nrepresenting England in the Peninsula, of his advance from success to\r\nsuccess--that advance so deliberate but so unswerving, so circumspect\r\nbut so certain, so "unhasting" but so "unresting;" when he read Lord\r\nWellington\'s own dispatches in the columns of the newspapers, documents\r\nwritten by modesty to the dictation of truth--Moore confessed at heart\r\nthat a power was with the troops of Britain, of that vigilant, enduring,\r\ngenuine, unostentatious sort, which must win victory to the side it led,\r\nin the end. In the end! But that end, he thought, was yet far off; and\r\nmeantime he, Moore, as an individual, would be crushed, his hopes ground\r\nto dust. It was himself he had to care for, his hopes he had to pursue;\r\nand he would fulfil his destiny.\r\n\r\nHe fulfilled it so vigorously that ere long he came to a decisive\r\nrupture with his old Tory friend the rector. They quarrelled at a public\r\nmeeting, and afterwards exchanged some pungent letters in the\r\nnewspapers. Mr. Helstone denounced Moore as a Jacobin, ceased to see\r\nhim, would not even speak to him when they met. He intimated also to his\r\nniece, very distinctly, that her communications with Hollow\'s Cottage\r\nmust for the present cease; she must give up taking French lessons. The\r\nlanguage, he observed, was a bad and frivolous one at the best, and most\r\nof the works it boasted were bad and frivolous, highly injurious in\r\ntheir tendency to weak female minds. He wondered (he remarked\r\nparenthetically) what noodle first made it the fashion to teach women\r\nFrench. Nothing was more improper for them. It was like feeding a\r\nrickety child on chalk and water gruel. Caroline must give it up, and\r\ngive up her cousins too. They were dangerous people.\r\n\r\nMr. Helstone quite expected opposition to this order; he expected tears.\r\nSeldom did he trouble himself about Caroline\'s movements, but a vague\r\nidea possessed him that she was fond of going to Hollow\'s Cottage; also\r\nhe suspected that she liked Robert Moore\'s occasional presence at the\r\nrectory. The Cossack had perceived that whereas if Malone stepped in of\r\nan evening to make himself sociable and charming, by pinching the ears\r\nof an aged black cat, which usually shared with Miss Helstone\'s feet the\r\naccommodation of her footstool, or by borrowing a fowling-piece, and\r\nbanging away at a tool shed door in the garden while enough of daylight\r\nremained to show that conspicuous mark, keeping the passage and\r\nsitting-room doors meantime uncomfortably open for the convenience of\r\nrunning in and out to announce his failures and successes with noisy\r\n_brusquerie_--he had observed that under such entertaining circumstances\r\nCaroline had a trick of disappearing, tripping noiselessly upstairs, and\r\nremaining invisible till called down to supper. On the other hand, when\r\nRobert Moore was the guest, though he elicited no vivacities from the\r\ncat, did nothing to it, indeed, beyond occasionally coaxing it from the\r\nstool to his knee, and there letting it purr, climb to his shoulder, and\r\nrub its head against his cheek; though there was no ear-splitting\r\ncracking off of firearms, no diffusion of sulphurous gunpowder perfume,\r\nno noise, no boasting during his stay--that still Caroline sat in the\r\nroom, and seemed to find wondrous content in the stitching of Jew-basket\r\npin-cushions and the knitting of missionary-basket socks.\r\n\r\nShe was very quiet, and Robert paid her little attention, scarcely ever\r\naddressing his discourse to her; but Mr. Helstone, not being one of\r\nthose elderly gentlemen who are easily blinded--on the contrary, finding\r\nhimself on all occasions extremely wide-awake--had watched them when\r\nthey bade each other good-night. He had just seen their eyes meet\r\nonce--only once. Some natures would have taken pleasure in the glance\r\nthen surprised, because there was no harm and some delight in it. It was\r\nby no means a glance of mutual intelligence, for mutual love secrets\r\nexisted not between them. There was nothing then of craft and\r\nconcealment to offend: only Mr. Moore\'s eyes, looking into Caroline\'s,\r\nfelt they were clear and gentle; and Caroline\'s eyes, encountering Mr.\r\nMoore\'s, confessed they were manly and searching. Each acknowledged the\r\ncharm in his or her own way. Moore smiled slightly, and Caroline\r\ncoloured as slightly. Mr. Helstone could, on the spot, have rated them\r\nboth. They annoyed him. Why? Impossible to say. If you had asked him\r\nwhat Moore merited at that moment, he would have said a "horsewhip;" if\r\nyou had inquired into Caroline\'s deserts, he would have adjudged her a\r\nbox on the ear; if you had further demanded the reason of such\r\nchastisements, he would have stormed against flirtation and\r\nlove-making, and vowed he would have no such folly going on under his\r\nroof.\r\n\r\nThese private considerations, combined with political reasons, fixed his\r\nresolution of separating the cousins. He announced his will to Caroline\r\none evening as she was sitting at work near the drawing-room window. Her\r\nface was turned towards him, and the light fell full upon it. It had\r\nstruck him a few minutes before that she was looking paler and quieter\r\nthan she used to look. It had not escaped him either that Robert Moore\'s\r\nname had never, for some three weeks past, dropped from her lips; nor\r\nduring the same space of time had that personage made his appearance at\r\nthe rectory. Some suspicion of clandestine meetings haunted his mind.\r\nHaving but an indifferent opinion of women, he always suspected them. He\r\nthought they needed constant watching. It was in a tone dryly\r\nsignificant he desired her to cease her daily visits to the Hollow. He\r\nexpected a start, a look of depreciation. The start he saw, but it was a\r\nvery slight one; no look whatever was directed to him.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear me?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, uncle."\r\n\r\n"Of course you mean to attend to what I say?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, certainly."\r\n\r\n"And there must be no letter-scribbling to your cousin Hortense--no\r\nintercourse whatever. I do not approve of the principles of the family.\r\nThey are Jacobinical."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Caroline quietly. She acquiesced then. There was no\r\nvexed flushing of the face, no gathering tears; the shadowy\r\nthoughtfulness which had covered her features ere Mr. Helstone spoke\r\nremained undisturbed; she was obedient.\r\n\r\nYes, perfectly; because the mandate coincided with her own previous\r\njudgment; because it was now become pain to her to go to Hollow\'s\r\nCottage; nothing met her there but disappointment. Hope and love had\r\nquitted that little tenement, for Robert seemed to have deserted its\r\nprecincts. Whenever she asked after him--which she very seldom did,\r\nsince the mere utterance of his name made her face grow hot--the answer\r\nwas, he was from home, or he was quite taken up with business. Hortense\r\nfeared he was killing himself by application. He scarcely ever took a\r\nmeal in the house; he lived in the counting-house.\r\n\r\nAt church only Caroline had the chance of seeing him, and there she\r\nrarely looked at him. It was both too much pain and too much pleasure\r\nto look--it excited too much emotion; and that it was all wasted emotion\r\nshe had learned well to comprehend.\r\n\r\nOnce, on a dark, wet Sunday, when there were few people at church, and\r\nwhen especially certain ladies were absent, of whose observant faculties\r\nand tomahawk tongues Caroline stood in awe, she had allowed her eye to\r\nseek Robert\'s pew, and to rest awhile on its occupant. He was there\r\nalone. Hortense had been kept at home by prudent considerations relative\r\nto the rain and a new spring _chapeau_. During the sermon he sat with\r\nfolded arms and eyes cast down, looking very sad and abstracted. When\r\ndepressed, the very hue of his face seemed more dusk than when he\r\nsmiled, and to-day cheek and forehead wore their most tintless and sober\r\nolive. By instinct Caroline knew, as she examined that clouded\r\ncountenance, that his thoughts were running in no familiar or kindly\r\nchannel; that they were far away, not merely from her, but from all\r\nwhich she could comprehend, or in which she could sympathize. Nothing\r\nthat they had ever talked of together was now in his mind: he was wrapt\r\nfrom her by interests and responsibilities in which it was deemed such\r\nas she could have no part.\r\n\r\nCaroline meditated in her own way on the subject; speculated on his\r\nfeelings, on his life, on his fears, on his fate; mused over the mystery\r\nof "business," tried to comprehend more about it than had ever been told\r\nher--to understand its perplexities, liabilities, duties, exactions;\r\nendeavoured to realize the state of mind of a "man of business," to\r\nenter into it, feel what he would feel, aspire to what he would aspire.\r\nHer earnest wish was to see things as they were, and not to be romantic.\r\nBy dint of effort she contrived to get a glimpse of the light of truth\r\nhere and there, and hoped that scant ray might suffice to guide her.\r\n\r\n"Different, indeed," she concluded, "is Robert\'s mental condition to\r\nmine. I think only of him; he has no room, no leisure, to think of me.\r\nThe feeling called love is and has been for two years the predominant\r\nemotion of my heart--always there, always awake, always astir. Quite\r\nother feelings absorb his reflections and govern his faculties. He is\r\nrising now, going to leave the church, for service is over. Will he turn\r\nhis head towards this pew? No, not once. He has not one look for me.\r\nThat is hard. A kind glance would have made me happy till to-morrow. I\r\nhave not got it; he would not give it; he is gone. Strange that grief\r\nshould now almost choke me, because another human being\'s eye has failed\r\nto greet mine."\r\n\r\nThat Sunday evening, Mr. Malone coming, as usual, to pass it with his\r\nrector, Caroline withdrew after tea to her chamber. Fanny, knowing her\r\nhabits, had lit her a cheerful little fire, as the weather was so gusty\r\nand chill. Closeted there, silent and solitary, what could she do but\r\nthink? She noiselessly paced to and fro the carpeted floor, her head\r\ndrooped, her hands folded. It was irksome to sit; the current of\r\nreflection ran rapidly through her mind; to-night she was mutely\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\nMute was the room, mute the house. The double door of the study muffled\r\nthe voices of the gentlemen. The servants were quiet in the kitchen,\r\nengaged with books their young mistress had lent them--books which she\r\nhad told them were "fit for Sunday reading." And she herself had another\r\nof the same sort open on the table, but she could not read it. Its\r\ntheology was incomprehensible to her, and her own mind was too busy,\r\nteeming, wandering, to listen to the language of another mind.\r\n\r\nThen, too, her imagination was full of pictures--images of Moore, scenes\r\nwhere he and she had been together; winter fireside sketches; a glowing\r\nlandscape of a hot summer afternoon passed with him in the bosom of\r\nNunnely Wood; divine vignettes of mild spring or mellow autumn moments,\r\nwhen she had sat at his side in Hollow\'s Copse, listening to the call of\r\nthe May cuckoo, or sharing the September treasure of nuts and ripe\r\nblackberries--a wild dessert which it was her morning\'s pleasure to\r\ncollect in a little basket, and cover with green leaves and fresh\r\nblossoms, and her afternoon\'s delight to administer to Moore, berry by\r\nberry, and nut by nut, like a bird feeding its fledgling.\r\n\r\nRobert\'s features and form were with her; the sound of his voice was\r\nquite distinct in her ear; his few caresses seemed renewed. But these\r\njoys, being hollow, were, ere long, crushed in. The pictures faded, the\r\nvoice failed, the visionary clasp melted chill from her hand, and where\r\nthe warm seal of lips had made impress on her forehead, it felt now as\r\nif a sleety rain-drop had fallen. She returned from an enchanted region\r\nto the real world: for Nunnely Wood in June she saw her narrow chamber;\r\nfor the songs of birds in alleys she heard the rain on her casement; for\r\nthe sigh of the south wind came the sob of the mournful east; and for\r\nMoore\'s manly companionship she had the thin illusion of her own dim\r\nshadow on the wall. Turning from the pale phantom which reflected\r\nherself in its outline, and her reverie in the drooped attitude of its\r\ndim head and colourless tresses, she sat down--inaction would suit the\r\nframe of mind into which she was now declining--she said to herself, "I\r\nhave to live, perhaps, till seventy years. As far as I know, I have good\r\nhealth; half a century of existence may lie before me. How am I to\r\noccupy it? What am I to do to fill the interval of time which spreads\r\nbetween me and the grave?"\r\n\r\nShe reflected.\r\n\r\n"I shall not be married, it appears," she continued. "I suppose, as\r\nRobert does not care for me, I shall never have a husband to love, nor\r\nlittle children to take care of. Till lately I had reckoned securely on\r\nthe duties and affections of wife and mother to occupy my existence. I\r\nconsidered, somehow, as a matter of course, that I was growing up to the\r\nordinary destiny, and never troubled myself to seek any other; but now I\r\nperceive plainly I may have been mistaken. Probably I shall be an old\r\nmaid. I shall live to see Robert married to some one else, some rich\r\nlady. I shall never marry. What was I created for, I wonder? Where is my\r\nplace in the world?"\r\n\r\nShe mused again.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I see," she pursued presently; "that is the question which most old\r\nmaids are puzzled to solve. Other people solve it for them by saying,\r\n\'Your place is to do good to others, to be helpful whenever help is\r\nwanted.\' That is right in some measure, and a very convenient doctrine\r\nfor the people who hold it; but I perceive that certain sets of human\r\nbeings are very apt to maintain that other sets should give up their\r\nlives to them and their service, and then they requite them by praise;\r\nthey call them devoted and virtuous. Is this enough? Is it to live? Is\r\nthere not a terrible hollowness, mockery, want, craving, in that\r\nexistence which is given away to others, for want of something of your\r\nown to bestow it on? I suspect there is. Does virtue lie in abnegation\r\nof self? I do not believe it. Undue humility makes tyranny; weak\r\nconcession creates selfishness. The Romish religion especially teaches\r\nrenunciation of self, submission to others, and nowhere are found so\r\nmany grasping tyrants as in the ranks of the Romish priesthood. Each\r\nhuman being has his share of rights. I suspect it would conduce to the\r\nhappiness and welfare of all if each knew his allotment, and held to it\r\nas tenaciously as the martyr to his creed. Queer thoughts these that\r\nsurge in my mind. Are they right thoughts? I am not certain.\r\n\r\n"Well, life is short at the best. Seventy years, they say, pass like a\r\nvapour, like a dream when one awaketh; and every path trod by human feet\r\nterminates in one bourne--the grave, the little chink in the surface of\r\nthis great globe, the furrow where the mighty husbandman with the scythe\r\ndeposits the seed he has shaken from the ripe stem; and there it falls,\r\ndecays, and thence it springs again, when the world has rolled round a\r\nfew times more. So much for the body. The soul meantime wings its long\r\nflight upward, folds its wings on the brink of the sea of fire and\r\nglass, and gazing down through the burning clearness, finds there\r\nmirrored the vision of the Christian\'s triple Godhead--the sovereign\r\nFather, the mediating Son, the Creator Spirit. Such words, at least,\r\nhave been chosen to express what is inexpressible, to describe what\r\nbaffles description. The soul\'s real hereafter who shall guess?"\r\n\r\nHer fire was decayed to its last cinder; Malone had departed; and now\r\nthe study bell rang for prayers.\r\n\r\nThe next day Caroline had to spend altogether alone, her uncle being\r\ngone to dine with his friend Dr. Boultby, vicar of Whinbury. The whole\r\ntime she was talking inwardly in the same strain--looking forwards,\r\nasking what she was to do with life. Fanny, as she passed in and out of\r\nthe room occasionally, intent on housemaid errands, perceived that her\r\nyoung mistress sat very still. She was always in the same place, always\r\nbent industriously over a piece of work. She did not lift her head to\r\nspeak to Fanny, as her custom was; and when the latter remarked that the\r\nday was fine, and she ought to take a walk, she only said, "It is cold."\r\n\r\n"You are very diligent at that sewing, Miss Caroline," continued the\r\ngirl, approaching her little table.\r\n\r\n"I am tired of it, Fanny."\r\n\r\n"Then why do you go on with it? Put it down. Read, or do something to\r\namuse you."\r\n\r\n"It is solitary in this house, Fanny. Don\'t you think so?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t find it so, miss. Me and Eliza are company for one another; but\r\nyou are quite too still. You should visit more. Now, be persuaded: go\r\nupstairs and dress yourself smart, and go and take tea, in a friendly\r\nway, with Miss Mann or Miss Ainley. I am certain either of those ladies\r\nwould be delighted to see you."\r\n\r\n"But their houses are dismal: they are both old maids. I am certain old\r\nmaids are a very unhappy race."\r\n\r\n"Not they, miss. They can\'t be unhappy; they take such care of\r\nthemselves. They are all selfish."\r\n\r\n"Miss Ainley is not selfish, Fanny. She is always doing good. How\r\ndevotedly kind she was to her step-mother as long as the old lady lived;\r\nand now when she is quite alone in the world, without brother or sister,\r\nor any one to care for her, how charitable she is to the poor, as far as\r\nher means permit! Still nobody thinks much of her, or has pleasure in\r\ngoing to see her; and how gentlemen always sneer at her!"\r\n\r\n"They shouldn\'t, miss. I believe she is a good woman. But gentlemen\r\nthink only of ladies\' looks."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go and see her," exclaimed Caroline, starting up; "and if she asks\r\nme to stay to tea, I\'ll stay. How wrong it is to neglect people because\r\nthey are not pretty, and young, and merry! And I will certainly call to\r\nsee Miss Mann too. She may not be amiable, but what has made her\r\nunamiable? What has life been to her?"\r\n\r\nFanny helped Miss Helstone to put away her work, and afterwards assisted\r\nher to dress.\r\n\r\n"_You_\'ll not be an old maid, Miss Caroline," she said, as she tied the\r\nsash of her brown silk frock, having previously smoothed her soft, full,\r\nand shining curls; "there are no signs of an old maid about you."\r\n\r\nCaroline looked at the little mirror before her, and she thought there\r\nwere some signs. She could see that she was altered within the last\r\nmonth; that the hues of her complexion were paler, her eyes changed--a\r\nwan shade seemed to circle them; her countenance was dejected--she was\r\nnot, in short, so pretty or so fresh as she used to be. She distantly\r\nhinted this to Fanny, from whom she got no direct answer, only a remark\r\nthat people did vary in their looks, but that at her age a little\r\nfalling away signified nothing; she would soon come round again, and be\r\nplumper and rosier than ever. Having given this assurance, Fanny showed\r\nsingular zeal in wrapping her up in warm shawls and handkerchiefs, till\r\nCaroline, nearly smothered with the weight, was fain to resist further\r\nadditions.\r\n\r\nShe paid her visits--first to Miss Mann, for this was the most difficult\r\npoint. Miss Mann was certainly not quite a lovable person. Till now,\r\nCaroline had always unhesitatingly declared she disliked her, and more\r\nthan once she had joined her cousin Robert in laughing at some of her\r\npeculiarities. Moore was not habitually given to sarcasm, especially on\r\nanything humbler or weaker than himself; but he had once or twice\r\nhappened to be in the room when Miss Mann had made a call on his sister,\r\nand after listening to her conversation and viewing her features for a\r\ntime, he had gone out into the garden where his little cousin was\r\ntending some of his favourite flowers, and while standing near and\r\nwatching her he had amused himself with comparing fair youth, delicate\r\nand attractive, with shrivelled eld, livid and loveless, and in\r\njestingly repeating to a smiling girl the vinegar discourse of a\r\ncankered old maid. Once on such an occasion Caroline had said to him,\r\nlooking up from the luxuriant creeper she was binding to its frame, "Ah!\r\nRobert, you do not like old maids. I, too, should come under the lash of\r\nyour sarcasm if I were an old maid."\r\n\r\n"You an old maid!" he had replied. "A piquant notion suggested by lips\r\nof that tint and form. I can fancy you, though, at forty, quietly\r\ndressed, pale and sunk, but still with that straight nose, white\r\nforehead, and those soft eyes. I suppose, too, you will keep your voice,\r\nwhich has another \'timbre\' than that hard, deep organ of Miss Mann\'s.\r\nCourage, Cary! Even at fifty you will not be repulsive."\r\n\r\n"Miss Mann did not make herself, or tune her voice, Robert."\r\n\r\n"Nature made her in the mood in which she makes her briars and thorns;\r\nwhereas for the creation of some women she reserves the May morning\r\nhours, when with light and dew she wooes the primrose from the turf and\r\nthe lily from the wood-moss."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUshered into Miss Mann\'s little parlour, Caroline found her, as she\r\nalways found her, surrounded by perfect neatness, cleanliness, and\r\ncomfort (after all, is it not a virtue in old maids that solitude rarely\r\nmakes them negligent or disorderly?)--no dust on her polished furniture,\r\nnone on her carpet, fresh flowers in the vase on her table, a bright\r\nfire in the grate. She herself sat primly and somewhat grimly-tidy in a\r\ncushioned rocking-chair, her hands busied with some knitting. This was\r\nher favourite work, as it required the least exertion. She scarcely rose\r\nas Caroline entered. To avoid excitement was one of Miss Mann\'s aims in\r\nlife. She had been composing herself ever since she came down in the\r\nmorning, and had just attained a certain lethargic state of tranquillity\r\nwhen the visitor\'s knock at the door startled her, and undid her day\'s\r\nwork. She was scarcely pleased, therefore, to see Miss Helstone. She\r\nreceived her with reserve, bade her be seated with austerity, and when\r\nshe got her placed opposite, she fixed her with her eye.\r\n\r\nThis was no ordinary doom--to be fixed with Miss Mann\'s eye. Robert\r\nMoore had undergone it once, and had never forgotten the circumstance.\r\n\r\nHe considered it quite equal to anything Medusa could do. He professed\r\nto doubt whether, since that infliction, his flesh had been quite what\r\nit was before--whether there was not something stony in its texture. The\r\ngaze had had such an effect on him as to drive him promptly from the\r\napartment and house; it had even sent him straightway up to the rectory,\r\nwhere he had appeared in Caroline\'s presence with a very queer face, and\r\namazed her by demanding a cousinly salute on the spot, to rectify a\r\ndamage that had been done him.\r\n\r\nCertainly Miss Mann had a formidable eye for one of the softer sex. It\r\nwas prominent, and showed a great deal of the white, and looked as\r\nsteadily, as unwinkingly, at you as if it were a steel ball soldered in\r\nher head; and when, while looking, she began to talk in an indescribably\r\ndry, monotonous tone--a tone without vibration or inflection--you felt\r\nas if a graven image of some bad spirit were addressing you. But it was\r\nall a figment of fancy, a matter of surface. Miss Mann\'s goblin grimness\r\nscarcely went deeper than the angel sweetness of hundreds of beauties.\r\nShe was a perfectly honest, conscientious woman, who had performed\r\nduties in her day from whose severe anguish many a human Peri,\r\ngazelle-eyed, silken-tressed, and silver-tongued, would have shrunk\r\nappalled. She had passed alone through protracted scenes of suffering,\r\nexercised rigid self-denial, made large sacrifices of time, money,\r\nhealth for those who had repaid her only by ingratitude, and now her\r\nmain--almost her sole--fault was that she was censorious.\r\n\r\nCensorious she certainly was. Caroline had not sat five minutes ere her\r\nhostess, still keeping her under the spell of that dread and Gorgon\r\ngaze, began flaying alive certain of the families in the neighbourhood.\r\nShe went to work at this business in a singularly cool, deliberate\r\nmanner, like some surgeon practising with his scalpel on a lifeless\r\nsubject. She made few distinctions; she allowed scarcely any one to be\r\ngood; she dissected impartially almost all her acquaintance. If her\r\nauditress ventured now and then to put in a palliative word she set it\r\naside with a certain disdain. Still, though thus pitiless in moral\r\nanatomy, she was no scandal-monger. She never disseminated really\r\nmalignant or dangerous reports. It was not her heart so much as her\r\ntemper that was wrong.\r\n\r\nCaroline made this discovery for the first time to-day, and moved\r\nthereby to regret divers unjust judgments she had more than once passed\r\non the crabbed old maid, she began to talk to her softly, not in\r\nsympathizing words, but with a sympathizing voice. The loneliness of her\r\ncondition struck her visitor in a new light, as did also the character\r\nof her ugliness--a bloodless pallor of complexion, and deeply worn lines\r\nof feature. The girl pitied the solitary and afflicted woman; her looks\r\ntold what she felt. A sweet countenance is never so sweet as when the\r\nmoved heart animates it with compassionate tenderness. Miss Mann, seeing\r\nsuch a countenance raised to her, was touched in her turn. She\r\nacknowledged her sense of the interest thus unexpectedly shown in her,\r\nwho usually met with only coldness and ridicule, by replying to her\r\ncandidly. Communicative on her own affairs she usually was not, because\r\nno one cared to listen to her; but to-day she became so, and her\r\nconfidante shed tears as she heard her speak, for she told of cruel,\r\nslow-wasting, obstinate sufferings. Well might she be corpse-like; well\r\nmight she look grim, and never smile; well might she wish to avoid\r\nexcitement, to gain and retain composure! Caroline, when she knew all,\r\nacknowledged that Miss Mann was rather to be admired for fortitude than\r\nblamed for moroseness. Reader! when you behold an aspect for whose\r\nconstant gloom and frown you cannot account, whose unvarying cloud\r\nexasperates you by its apparent causelessness, be sure that there is a\r\ncanker somewhere, and a canker not the less deeply corroding because\r\nconcealed.\r\n\r\nMiss Mann felt that she was understood partly, and wished to be\r\nunderstood further; for, however old, plain, humble, desolate, afflicted\r\nwe may be, so long as our hearts preserve the feeblest spark of life,\r\nthey preserve also, shivering near that pale ember, a starved, ghostly\r\nlonging for appreciation and affection. To this extenuated spectre,\r\nperhaps, a crumb is not thrown once a year, but when ahungered and\r\nathirst to famine--when all humanity has forgotten the dying tenant of a\r\ndecaying house--Divine mercy remembers the mourner, and a shower of\r\nmanna falls for lips that earthly nutriment is to pass no more. Biblical\r\npromises, heard first in health, but then unheeded, come whispering to\r\nthe couch of sickness; it is felt that a pitying God watches what all\r\nmankind have forsaken. The tender compassion of Jesus is recalled and\r\nrelied on; the faded eye, gazing beyond time, sees a home, a friend, a\r\nrefuge in eternity.\r\n\r\nMiss Mann, drawn on by the still attention of her listener, proceeded to\r\nallude to circumstances in her past life. She spoke like one who tells\r\nthe truth--simply, and with a certain reserve; she did not boast, nor\r\ndid she exaggerate. Caroline found that the old maid had been a most\r\ndevoted daughter and sister, an unwearied watcher by lingering\r\ndeathbeds; that to prolonged and unrelaxing attendance on the sick the\r\nmalady that now poisoned her own life owed its origin; that to one\r\nwretched relative she had been a support and succour in the depths of\r\nself-earned degradation, and that it was still her hand which kept him\r\nfrom utter destitution. Miss Helstone stayed the whole evening, omitting\r\nto pay her other intended visit; and when she left Miss Mann it was with\r\nthe determination to try in future to excuse her faults; never again to\r\nmake light of her peculiarities or to laugh at her plainness; and, above\r\nall things, not to neglect her, but to come once a week, and to offer\r\nher, from one human heart at least, the homage of affection and respect.\r\nShe felt she could now sincerely give her a small tribute of each\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nCaroline, on her return, told Fanny she was very glad she had gone out,\r\nas she felt much better for the visit. The next day she failed not to\r\nseek Miss Ainley. This lady was in narrower circumstances than Miss\r\nMann, and her dwelling was more humble. It was, however, if possible,\r\nyet more exquisitely clean, though the decayed gentlewoman could not\r\nafford to keep a servant, but waited on herself, and had only the\r\noccasional assistance of a little girl who lived in a cottage near.\r\n\r\nNot only was Miss Ainley poorer, but she was even plainer than the other\r\nold maid. In her first youth she must have been ugly; now, at the age of\r\nfifty, she was _very_ ugly. At first sight, all but peculiarly\r\nwell-disciplined minds were apt to turn from her with annoyance, to\r\nconceive against her a prejudice, simply on the ground of her\r\nunattractive look. Then she was prim in dress and manner; she looked,\r\nspoke, and moved the complete old maid.\r\n\r\nHer welcome to Caroline was formal, even in its kindness--for it was\r\nkind; but Miss Helstone excused this. She knew something of the\r\nbenevolence of the heart which beat under that starched kerchief; all\r\nthe neighbourhood--at least all the female neighbourhood--knew something\r\nof it. No one spoke against Miss Ainley except lively young gentlemen\r\nand inconsiderate old ones, who declared her hideous.\r\n\r\nCaroline was soon at home in that tiny parlour. A kind hand took from\r\nher her shawl and bonnet, and installed her in the most comfortable seat\r\nnear the fire. The young and the antiquated woman were presently deep in\r\nkindly conversation, and soon Caroline became aware of the power a most\r\nserene, unselfish, and benignant mind could exercise over those to whom\r\nit was developed. She talked never of herself, always of others. Their\r\nfaults she passed over. Her theme was their wants, which she sought to\r\nsupply; their sufferings, which she longed to alleviate. She was\r\nreligious, a professor of religion--what some would call "a saint;" and\r\nshe referred to religion often in sanctioned phrase--in phrase which\r\nthose who possess a perception of the ridiculous, without owning the\r\npower of exactly testing and truly judging character, would certainly\r\nhave esteemed a proper subject for satire, a matter for mimicry and\r\nlaughter. They would have been hugely mistaken for their pains.\r\nSincerity is never ludicrous; it is always respectable. Whether\r\ntruth--be it religious or moral truth--speak eloquently and in\r\nwell-chosen language or not, its voice should be heard with reverence.\r\nLet those who cannot nicely, and with certainty, discern the difference\r\nbetween the tones of hypocrisy and those of sincerity, never presume to\r\nlaugh at all, lest they should have the miserable misfortune to laugh in\r\nthe wrong place, and commit impiety when they think they are achieving\r\nwit.\r\n\r\nNot from Miss Ainley\'s own lips did Caroline hear of her good works, but\r\nshe knew much of them nevertheless. Her beneficence was the familiar\r\ntopic of the poor in Briarfield. They were not works of almsgiving. The\r\nold maid was too poor to give much, though she straitened herself to\r\nprivation that she might contribute her mite when needful. They were the\r\nworks of a Sister of Charity--far more difficult to perform than those\r\nof a Lady Bountiful. She would watch by any sick-bed; she seemed to fear\r\nno disease. She would nurse the poorest whom none else would nurse. She\r\nwas serene, humble, kind, and equable through everything.\r\n\r\nFor this goodness she got but little reward in this life. Many of the\r\npoor became so accustomed to her services that they hardly thanked her\r\nfor them. The rich heard them mentioned with wonder, but were silent,\r\nfrom a sense of shame at the difference between her sacrifices and their\r\nown. Many ladies, however, respected her deeply. They could not help it.\r\nOne gentleman--one only--gave her his friendship and perfect confidence.\r\nThis was Mr. Hall, the vicar of Nunnely. He said, and said truly, that\r\nher life came nearer the life of Christ than that of any other human\r\nbeing he had ever met with. You must not think, reader, that in\r\nsketching Miss Ainley\'s character I depict a figment of imagination. No.\r\nWe seek the originals of such portraits in real life only.\r\n\r\nMiss Helstone studied well the mind and heart now revealed to her. She\r\nfound no high intellect to admire--the old maid was merely sensible--but\r\nshe discovered so much goodness, so much usefulness, so much mildness,\r\npatience, truth, that she bent her own mind before Miss Ainley\'s in\r\nreverence. What was her love of nature, what was her sense of beauty,\r\nwhat were her more varied and fervent emotions, what was her deeper\r\npower of thought, what her wider capacity to comprehend, compared to the\r\npractical excellence of this good woman? Momently, they seemed only\r\nbeautiful forms of selfish delight; mentally, she trod them under foot.\r\n\r\nIt is true she still felt with pain that the life which made Miss Ainley\r\nhappy could not make her happy. Pure and active as it was, in her heart\r\nshe deemed it deeply dreary, because it was so loveless--to her ideas,\r\nso forlorn. Yet, doubtless, she reflected, it needed only habit to make\r\nit practicable and agreeable to any one. It was despicable, she felt, to\r\npine sentimentally, to cherish secret griefs, vain memories, to be\r\ninert, to waste youth in aching languor, to grow old doing nothing.\r\n\r\n"I will bestir myself," was her resolution, "and try to be wise if I\r\ncannot be good."\r\n\r\nShe proceeded to make inquiry of Miss Ainley if she could help her in\r\nanything. Miss Ainley, glad of an assistant, told her that she could,\r\nand indicated some poor families in Briarfield that it was desirable she\r\nshould visit, giving her likewise, at her further request, some work to\r\ndo for certain poor women who had many children, and who were unskilled\r\nin using the needle for themselves.\r\n\r\nCaroline went home, laid her plans, and took a resolve not to swerve\r\nfrom them. She allotted a certain portion of her time for her various\r\nstudies, and a certain portion for doing anything Miss Ainley might\r\ndirect her to do. The remainder was to be spent in exercise; not a\r\nmoment was to be left for the indulgence of such fevered thoughts as had\r\npoisoned last Sunday evening.\r\n\r\nTo do her justice, she executed her plans conscientiously,\r\nperseveringly. It was very hard work at first--it was even hard work to\r\nthe end--but it helped her to stem and keep down anguish; it forced her\r\nto be employed; it forbade her to brood; and gleams of satisfaction\r\nchequered her gray life here and there when she found she had done good,\r\nimparted pleasure, or allayed suffering.\r\n\r\nYet I must speak truth. These efforts brought her neither health of body\r\nnor continued peace of mind. With them all she wasted, grew more joyless\r\nand more wan; with them all her memory kept harping on the name of\r\nRobert Moore; an elegy over the past still rung constantly in her ear; a\r\nfunereal inward cry haunted and harassed her; the heaviness of a broken\r\nspirit, and of pining and palsying faculties, settled slow on her\r\nbuoyant youth. Winter seemed conquering her spring; the mind\'s soil and\r\nits treasures were freezing gradually to barren stagnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nFIELDHEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet Caroline refused tamely to succumb. She had native strength in her\r\ngirl\'s heart, and she used it. Men and women never struggle so hard as\r\nwhen they struggle alone, without witness, counsellor, or confidant,\r\nunencouraged, unadvised, and unpitied.\r\n\r\nMiss Helstone was in this position. Her sufferings were her only spur,\r\nand being very real and sharp, they roused her spirit keenly. Bent on\r\nvictory over a mortal pain, she did her best to quell it. Never had she\r\nbeen seen so busy, so studious, and, above all, so active. She took\r\nwalks in all weathers, long walks in solitary directions. Day by day she\r\ncame back in the evening, pale and wearied-looking, yet seemingly not\r\nfatigued; for still, as soon as she had thrown off her bonnet and shawl,\r\nshe would, instead of resting, begin to pace her apartment. Sometimes\r\nshe would not sit down till she was literally faint. She said she did\r\nthis to tire herself well, that she might sleep soundly at night. But if\r\nthat was her aim it was unattained; for at night, when others slumbered,\r\nshe was tossing on her pillow, or sitting at the foot of her couch in\r\nthe darkness, forgetful, apparently, of the necessity of seeking repose.\r\nOften, unhappy girl! she was crying--crying in a sort of intolerable\r\ndespair, which, when it rushed over her, smote down her strength, and\r\nreduced her to childlike helplessness.\r\n\r\nWhen thus prostrate, temptations besieged her. Weak suggestions\r\nwhispered in her weary heart to write to Robert, and say that she was\r\nunhappy because she was forbidden to see him and Hortense, and that she\r\nfeared he would withdraw his friendship (not love) from her, and forget\r\nher entirely, and begging him to remember her, and sometimes to write to\r\nher. One or two such letters she actually indited, but she never sent\r\nthem: shame and good sense forbade.\r\n\r\nAt last the life she led reached the point when it seemed she could bear\r\nit no longer, that she must seek and find a change somehow, or her heart\r\nand head would fail under the pressure which strained them. She longed\r\nto leave Briarfield, to go to some very distant place. She longed for\r\nsomething else--the deep, secret, anxious yearning to discover and know\r\nher mother strengthened daily; but with the desire was coupled a doubt,\r\na dread--if she knew her, could she love her? There was cause for\r\nhesitation, for apprehension on this point. Never in her life had she\r\nheard that mother praised; whoever mentioned her mentioned her coolly.\r\nHer uncle seemed to regard his sister-in-law with a sort of tacit\r\nantipathy; an old servant, who had lived with Mrs. James Helstone for a\r\nshort time after her marriage, whenever she referred to her former\r\nmistress, spoke with chilling reserve--sometimes she called her "queer,"\r\nsometimes she said she did not understand her. These expressions were\r\nice to the daughter\'s heart; they suggested the conclusion that it was\r\nperhaps better never to know her parent than to know her and not like\r\nher.\r\n\r\nBut one project could she frame whose execution seemed likely to bring\r\nher a hope of relief: it was to take a situation, to be a governess; she\r\ncould do nothing else. A little incident brought her to the point, when\r\nshe found courage to break her design to her uncle.\r\n\r\nHer long and late walks lay always, as has been said, on lonely roads;\r\nbut in whatever direction she had rambled--whether along the drear\r\nskirts of Stilbro\' Moor or over the sunny stretch of Nunnely Common--her\r\nhomeward path was still so contrived as to lead her near the Hollow. She\r\nrarely descended the den, but she visited its brink at twilight almost\r\nas regularly as the stars rose over the hillcrests. Her resting-place\r\nwas at a certain stile under a certain old thorn. Thence she could look\r\ndown on the cottage, the mill, the dewy garden-ground, the still, deep\r\ndam; thence was visible the well-known counting-house window, from whose\r\npanes at a fixed hour shot, suddenly bright, the ray of the well-known\r\nlamp. Her errand was to watch for this ray, her reward to catch it,\r\nsometimes sparkling bright in clear air, sometimes shimmering dim\r\nthrough mist, and anon flashing broken between slant lines of rain--for\r\nshe came in all weathers.\r\n\r\nThere were nights when it failed to appear. She knew then that Robert\r\nwas from home, and went away doubly sad; whereas its kindling rendered\r\nher elate, as though she saw in it the promise of some indefinite hope.\r\nIf, while she gazed, a shadow bent between the light and lattice, her\r\nheart leaped. That eclipse was Robert; she had seen him. She would\r\nreturn home comforted, carrying in her mind a clearer vision of his\r\naspect, a distincter recollection of his voice, his smile, his bearing;\r\nand blent with these impressions was often a sweet persuasion that, if\r\nshe could get near him, his heart might welcome her presence yet, that\r\nat this moment he might be willing to extend his hand and draw her to\r\nhim, and shelter her at his side as he used to do. That night, though\r\nshe might weep as usual, she would fancy her tears less scalding; the\r\npillow they watered seemed a little softer; the temples pressed to that\r\npillow ached less.\r\n\r\nThe shortest path from the Hollow to the rectory wound near a certain\r\nmansion, the same under whose lone walls Malone passed on that\r\nnight-journey mentioned in an early chapter of this work--the old and\r\ntenantless dwelling yclept Fieldhead. Tenantless by the proprietor it\r\nhad been for ten years, but it was no ruin. Mr. Yorke had seen it kept\r\nin good repair, and an old gardener and his wife had lived in it,\r\ncultivated the grounds, and maintained the house in habitable condition.\r\n\r\nIf Fieldhead had few other merits as a building, it might at least be\r\ntermed picturesque. Its regular architecture, and the gray and mossy\r\ncolouring communicated by time, gave it a just claim to this epithet.\r\nThe old latticed windows, the stone porch, the walls, the roof, the\r\nchimney-stacks, were rich in crayon touches and sepia lights and shades.\r\nThe trees behind were fine, bold, and spreading; the cedar on the lawn\r\nin front was grand; and the granite urns on the garden wall, the fretted\r\narch of the gateway, were, for an artist, as the very desire of the eye.\r\n\r\nOne mild May evening Caroline, passing near about moonrise, and feeling,\r\nthough weary, unwilling yet to go home, where there was only the bed of\r\nthorns and the night of grief to anticipate, sat down on the mossy\r\nground near the gate, and gazed through towards cedar and mansion. It\r\nwas a still night--calm, dewy, cloudless; the gables, turned to the\r\nwest, reflected the clear amber of the horizon they faced; the oaks\r\nbehind were black; the cedar was blacker. Under its dense, raven boughs\r\na glimpse of sky opened gravely blue. It was full of the moon, which\r\nlooked solemnly and mildly down on Caroline from beneath that sombre\r\ncanopy.\r\n\r\nShe felt this night and prospect mournfully lovely. She wished she could\r\nbe happy; she wished she could know inward peace; she wondered\r\nProvidence had no pity on her, and would not help or console her.\r\nRecollections of happy trysts of lovers, commemorated in old ballads,\r\nreturned on her mind; she thought such tryst in such scene would be\r\nblissful. Where now was Robert? she asked. Not at the Hollow; she had\r\nwatched for his lamp long, and had not seen it. She questioned within\r\nherself whether she and Moore were ever destined to meet and speak\r\nagain. Suddenly the door within the stone porch of the hall opened, and\r\ntwo men came out--one elderly and white-headed, the other young,\r\ndark-haired, and tall. They passed across the lawn, out through a portal\r\nin the garden wall. Caroline saw them cross the road, pass the stile,\r\ndescend the fields; she saw them disappear. Robert Moore had passed\r\nbefore her with his friend Mr. Yorke. Neither had seen her.\r\n\r\nThe apparition had been transient--scarce seen ere gone; but its\r\nelectric passage left her veins kindled, her soul insurgent. It found\r\nher despairing, it left her desperate--two different states.\r\n\r\n"Oh, had he but been alone! had he but seen me!" was her cry. "He would\r\nhave said something. He would have given me his hand. He _does_, he\r\n_must_, love me a little. He would have shown some token of affection.\r\nIn his eye, on his lips, I should have read comfort; but the chance is\r\nlost. The wind, the cloud\'s shadow, does not pass more silently, more\r\nemptily than he. I have been mocked, and Heaven is cruel!"\r\n\r\nThus, in the utter sickness of longing and disappointment, she went\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe next morning at breakfast, where she appeared white-cheeked and\r\nmiserable-looking as one who had seen a ghost, she inquired of Mr.\r\nHelstone, "Have you any objection, uncle, to my inquiring for a\r\nsituation in a family?"\r\n\r\nHer uncle, ignorant as the table supporting his coffee-cup of all his\r\nniece had undergone and was undergoing, scarcely believed his ears.\r\n\r\n"What whim now?" he asked. "Are you bewitched? What can you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I am not well, and need a change," she said.\r\n\r\nHe examined her. He discovered she had _experienced_ a change, at any\r\nrate. Without his being aware of it, the rose had dwindled and faded to\r\na mere snowdrop; bloom had vanished, flesh wasted; she sat before him\r\ndrooping, colourless, and thin. But for the soft expression of her brown\r\neyes, the delicate lines of her features, and the flowing abundance of\r\nher hair, she would no longer have possessed a claim to the epithet\r\npretty.\r\n\r\n"What on earth is the matter with you?" he asked. "What is wrong? How\r\nare you ailing?"\r\n\r\nNo answer; only the brown eyes filled, the faintly-tinted lips trembled.\r\n\r\n"Look out for a situation, indeed! For what situation are you fit? What\r\nhave you been doing with yourself? You are not well."\r\n\r\n"I should be well if I went from home."\r\n\r\n"These women are incomprehensible. They have the strangest knack of\r\nstartling you with unpleasant surprises. To-day you see them bouncing,\r\nbuxom, red as cherries, and round as apples; to-morrow they exhibit\r\nthemselves effete as dead weeds, blanched and broken down. And the\r\nreason of it all? That\'s the puzzle. She has her meals, her liberty, a\r\ngood house to live in, and good clothes to wear, as usual. A while since\r\nthat sufficed to keep her handsome and cheery, and there she sits now a\r\npoor, little, pale, puling chit enough. Provoking! Then comes the\r\nquestion, What is to be done? I suppose I must send for advice. Will you\r\nhave a doctor, child?"\r\n\r\n"No, uncle, I don\'t want one. A doctor could do me no good. I merely\r\nwant change of air and scene."\r\n\r\n"Well, if that be the caprice, it shall be gratified. You shall go to a\r\nwatering-place. I don\'t mind the expense. Fanny shall accompany you."\r\n\r\n"But, uncle, some day I must do something for myself; I have no fortune.\r\nI had better begin now."\r\n\r\n"While I live, you shall not turn out as a governess, Caroline. I will\r\nnot have it said that my niece is a governess."\r\n\r\n"But the later in life one makes a change of that sort, uncle, the more\r\ndifficult and painful it is. I should wish to get accustomed to the yoke\r\nbefore any habits of ease and independence are formed."\r\n\r\n"I beg you will not harass me, Caroline. I mean to provide for you. I\r\nhave always meant to provide for you. I will purchase an annuity. Bless\r\nme! I am but fifty-five; my health and constitution are excellent.\r\nThere is plenty of time to save and take measures. Don\'t make yourself\r\nanxious respecting the future. Is that what frets you?"\r\n\r\n"No, uncle; but I long for a change."\r\n\r\nHe laughed. "There speaks the woman!" cried he, "the very woman! A\r\nchange! a change! Always fantastical and whimsical! Well, it\'s in her\r\nsex."\r\n\r\n"But it is not fantasy and whim, uncle."\r\n\r\n"What is it then?"\r\n\r\n"Necessity, I think. I feel weaker than formerly. I believe I should\r\nhave more to do."\r\n\r\n"Admirable! She feels weak, and _therefore_ she should be set to hard\r\nlabour--\'clair comme le jour,\' as Moore--confound Moore! You shall go to\r\nCliff Bridge; and there are two guineas to buy a new frock. Come, Cary,\r\nnever fear. We\'ll find balm in Gilead."\r\n\r\n"Uncle, I wish you were less generous and more----"\r\n\r\n"More what?"\r\n\r\nSympathizing was the word on Caroline\'s lips, but it was not uttered.\r\nShe checked herself in time. Her uncle would indeed have laughed if that\r\nnamby-pamby word had escaped her. Finding her silent, he said, "The fact\r\nis, you don\'t know precisely what you want."\r\n\r\n"Only to be a governess."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! mere nonsense! I\'ll not hear of governessing. Don\'t mention it\r\nagain. It is rather too feminine a fancy. I have finished breakfast.\r\nRing the bell. Put all crotchets out of your head, and run away and\r\namuse yourself."\r\n\r\n"What with? My doll?" asked Caroline to herself as she quitted the room.\r\n\r\nA week or two passed; her bodily and mental health neither grew worse\r\nnor better. She was now precisely in that state when, if her\r\nconstitution had contained the seeds of consumption, decline, or slow\r\nfever, those diseases would have been rapidly developed, and would soon\r\nhave carried her quietly from the world. People never die of love or\r\ngrief alone, though some die of inherent maladies which the tortures of\r\nthose passions prematurely force into destructive action. The sound by\r\nnature undergo these tortures, and are racked, shaken, shattered; their\r\nbeauty and bloom perish, but life remains untouched. They are brought to\r\na certain point of dilapidation; they are reduced to pallor, debility,\r\nand emaciation. People think, as they see them gliding languidly about,\r\nthat they will soon withdraw to sick-beds, perish there, and cease from\r\namong the healthy and happy. This does not happen. They live on; and\r\nthough they cannot regain youth and gaiety, they may regain strength and\r\nserenity. The blossom which the March wind nips, but fails to sweep\r\naway, may survive to hang a withered apple on the tree late into autumn:\r\nhaving braved the last frosts of spring, it may also brave the first of\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nEvery one noticed the change in Miss Helstone\'s appearance, and most\r\npeople said she was going to die. She never thought so herself. She felt\r\nin no dying case; she had neither pain nor sickness. Her appetite was\r\ndiminished; she knew the reason. It was because she wept so much at\r\nnight. Her strength was lessened; she could account for it. Sleep was\r\ncoy and hard to be won; dreams were distressing and baleful. In the far\r\nfuture she still seemed to anticipate a time when this passage of misery\r\nshould be got over, and when she should once more be calm, though\r\nperhaps never again happy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile her uncle urged her to visit, to comply with the frequent\r\ninvitations of their acquaintance. This she evaded doing. She could not\r\nbe cheerful in company; she felt she was observed there with more\r\ncuriosity than sympathy. Old ladies were always offering her their\r\nadvice, recommending this or that nostrum; young ladies looked at her in\r\na way she understood, and from which she shrank. Their eyes said they\r\nknew she had been "disappointed," as custom phrases it; by whom, they\r\nwere not certain.\r\n\r\nCommonplace young ladies can be quite as hard as commonplace young\r\ngentlemen--quite as worldly and selfish. Those who suffer should always\r\navoid them. Grief and calamity they despise; they seem to regard them as\r\nthe judgments of God on the lowly. With them, to "love" is merely to\r\ncontrive a scheme for achieving a good match; to be "disappointed" is to\r\nhave their scheme seen through and frustrated. They think the feelings\r\nand projects of others on the subject of love similar to their own, and\r\njudge them accordingly.\r\n\r\nAll this Caroline knew, partly by instinct, partly by observation. She\r\nregulated her conduct by her knowledge, keeping her pale face and wasted\r\nfigure as much out of sight as she could. Living thus in complete\r\nseclusion, she ceased to receive intelligence of the little transactions\r\nof the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nOne morning her uncle came into the parlour, where she sat endeavouring\r\nto find some pleasure in painting a little group of wild flowers,\r\ngathered under a hedge at the top of the Hollow fields, and said to her\r\nin his abrupt manner, "Come, child, you are always stooping over\r\npalette, or book, or sampler; leave that tinting work. By-the-bye, do\r\nyou put your pencil to your lips when you paint?"\r\n\r\n"Sometimes, uncle, when I forget."\r\n\r\n"Then it is that which is poisoning you. The paints are deleterious,\r\nchild. There is white lead and red lead, and verdigris, and gamboge, and\r\ntwenty other poisons in those colour cakes. Lock them up! lock them up!\r\nGet your bonnet on. I want you to make a call with me."\r\n\r\n"With _you_, uncle?"\r\n\r\nThis question was asked in a tone of surprise. She was not accustomed to\r\nmake calls with her uncle. She never rode or walked out with him on any\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n"Quick! quick! I am always busy, you know. I have no time to lose."\r\n\r\nShe hurriedly gathered up her materials, asking, meantime, where they\r\nwere going.\r\n\r\n"To Fieldhead."\r\n\r\n"Fieldhead! What! to see old James Booth, the gardener? Is he ill?"\r\n\r\n"We are going to see Miss Shirley Keeldar."\r\n\r\n"Miss Keeldar! Is she coming to Yorkshire? Is she at Fieldhead?"\r\n\r\n"She is. She has been there a week. I met her at a party last\r\nnight--that party to which you would not go. I was pleased with her. I\r\nchoose that you shall make her acquaintance. It will do you good."\r\n\r\n"She is now come of age, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"She is come of age, and will reside for a time on her property. I\r\nlectured her on the subject; I showed her her duty. She is not\r\nintractable. She is rather a fine girl; she will teach you what it is to\r\nhave a sprightly spirit. Nothing lackadaisical about _her_."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she will want to see me, or to have me introduced to her.\r\nWhat good can I do her? How can I amuse her?"\r\n\r\n"Pshaw! Put your bonnet on."\r\n\r\n"Is she proud, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know. You hardly imagine she would show her pride to me, I\r\nsuppose? A chit like that would scarcely presume to give herself airs\r\nwith the rector of her parish, however rich she might be."\r\n\r\n"No. But how did she behave to other people?"\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t observe. She holds her head high, and probably can be saucy\r\nenough where she dare. She wouldn\'t be a woman otherwise. There! Away\r\nnow for your bonnet at once!"\r\n\r\nNot naturally very confident, a failure of physical strength and a\r\ndepression of spirits had not tended to increase Caroline\'s presence of\r\nmind and ease of manner, or to give her additional courage to face\r\nstrangers, and she quailed, in spite of self-remonstrance, as she and\r\nher uncle walked up the broad, paved approach leading from the gateway\r\nof Fieldhead to its porch. She followed Mr. Helstone reluctantly through\r\nthat porch into the sombre old vestibule beyond.\r\n\r\nVery sombre it was--long, vast, and dark; one latticed window lit it but\r\ndimly. The wide old chimney contained now no fire, for the present warm\r\nweather needed it not; it was filled instead with willow-boughs. The\r\ngallery on high, opposite the entrance, was seen but in outline, so\r\nshadowy became this hall towards its ceiling. Carved stags\' heads, with\r\nreal antlers, looked down grotesquely from the walls. This was neither a\r\ngrand nor a comfortable house; within as without it was antique,\r\nrambling, and incommodious. A property of a thousand a year belonged to\r\nit, which property had descended, for lack of male heirs, on a female.\r\nThere were mercantile families in the district boasting twice the\r\nincome, but the Keeldars, by virtue of their antiquity, and their\r\ndistinction of lords of the manor, took the precedence of all.\r\n\r\nMr. and Miss Helstone were ushered into a parlour. Of course, as was to\r\nbe expected in such a Gothic old barrack, this parlour was lined with\r\noak: fine, dark, glossy panels compassed the walls gloomily and grandly.\r\nVery handsome, reader, these shining brown panels are, very mellow in\r\ncolouring and tasteful in effect, but--if you know what a "spring clean"\r\nis--very execrable and inhuman. Whoever, having the bowels of humanity,\r\nhas seen servants scrubbing at these polished wooden walls with\r\nbeeswaxed cloths on a warm May day must allow that they are "intolerable\r\nand not to be endured;" and I cannot but secretly applaud the benevolent\r\nbarbarian who had painted another and larger apartment of Fieldhead--the\r\ndrawing-room, to wit, formerly also an oak-room--of a delicate pinky\r\nwhite, thereby earning for himself the character of a Hun, but mightily\r\nenhancing the cheerfulness of that portion of his abode, and saving\r\nfuture housemaids a world of toil.\r\n\r\nThe brown-panelled parlour was furnished all in old style, and with real\r\nold furniture. On each side of the high mantelpiece stood two antique\r\nchairs of oak, solid as silvan thrones, and in one of these sat a lady.\r\nBut if this were Miss Keeldar, she must have come of age at least some\r\ntwenty years ago. She was of matronly form, and though she wore no cap,\r\nand possessed hair of quite an undimmed auburn, shading small and\r\nnaturally young-looking features, she had no youthful aspect, nor\r\napparently the wish to assume it. You could have wished her attire of a\r\nnewer fashion. In a well-cut, well-made gown hers would have been no\r\nuncomely presence. It puzzled you to guess why a garment of handsome\r\nmaterials should be arranged in such scanty folds, and devised after\r\nsuch an obsolete mode. You felt disposed to set down the wearer as\r\nsomewhat eccentric at once.\r\n\r\nThis lady received the visitors with a mixture of ceremony and\r\ndiffidence quite English. No middle-aged matron who was not an\r\nEnglishwoman _could_ evince precisely the same manner--a manner so\r\nuncertain of herself, of her own merits, of her power to please, and yet\r\nso anxious to be proper, and, if possible, rather agreeable than\r\notherwise. In the present instance, however, more embarrassment was\r\nshown than is usual even with diffident Englishwomen. Miss Helstone felt\r\nthis, sympathized with the stranger, and knowing by experience what was\r\ngood for the timid, took a seat quietly near her, and began to talk to\r\nher with a gentle ease, communicated for the moment by the presence of\r\none less self-possessed than herself.\r\n\r\nShe and this lady would, if alone, have at once got on extremely well\r\ntogether. The lady had the clearest voice imaginable--infinitely softer\r\nand more tuneful than could have been reasonably expected from forty\r\nyears--and a form decidedly inclined to _embonpoint_. This voice\r\nCaroline liked; it atoned for the formal, if correct, accent and\r\nlanguage. The lady would soon have discovered she liked it and her, and\r\nin ten minutes they would have been friends. But Mr. Helstone stood on\r\nthe rug looking at them both, looking especially at the strange lady\r\nwith his sarcastic, keen eye, that clearly expressed impatience of her\r\nchilly ceremony, and annoyance at her want of _aplomb_. His hard gaze\r\nand rasping voice discomfited the lady more and more. She tried,\r\nhowever, to get up little speeches about the weather, the aspect of the\r\ncountry, etc.; but the impracticable Mr. Helstone presently found\r\nhimself somewhat deaf. Whatever she said he affected not to hear\r\ndistinctly, and she was obliged to go over each elaborately-constructed\r\nnothing twice. The effort soon became too much for her. She was just\r\nrising in a perplexed flutter, nervously murmuring that she knew not\r\nwhat detained Miss Keeldar, that she would go and look for her, when\r\nMiss Keeldar saved her the trouble by appearing. It was to be presumed\r\nat least that she who now came in through a glass door from the garden\r\nowned that name.\r\n\r\nThere is real grace in ease of manner, and so old Helstone felt when an\r\nerect, slight girl walked up to him, retaining with her left hand her\r\nlittle silk apron full of flowers, and, giving him her right hand, said\r\npleasantly, "I knew you would come to see me, though you _do_ think Mr.\r\nYorke has made me a Jacobin. Good-morning."\r\n\r\n"But we\'ll not have you a Jacobin," returned he. "No, Miss Shirley; they\r\nshall not steal the flower of my parish from me. Now that you are\r\namongst us, you shall be my pupil in politics and religion; I\'ll teach\r\nyou sound doctrine on both points."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Pryor has anticipated you," she replied, turning to the elder\r\nlady. "Mrs. Pryor, you know, was my governess, and is still my friend;\r\nand of all the high and rigid Tories she is queen; of all the stanch\r\nchurchwomen she is chief. I have been well drilled both in theology and\r\nhistory, I assure you, Mr. Helstone."\r\n\r\nThe rector immediately bowed very low to Mrs. Pryor, and expressed\r\nhimself obliged to her.\r\n\r\nThe ex-governess disclaimed skill either in political or religious\r\ncontroversy, explained that she thought such matters little adapted for\r\nfemale minds, but avowed herself in general terms the advocate of order\r\nand loyalty, and, of course, truly attached to the Establishment. She\r\nadded she was ever averse to change under any circumstances, and\r\nsomething scarcely audible about the extreme danger of being too ready\r\nto take up new ideas closed her sentence.\r\n\r\n"Miss Keeldar thinks as you think, I hope, madam."\r\n\r\n"Difference of age and difference of temperament occasion difference of\r\nsentiment," was the reply. "It can scarcely be expected that the eager\r\nand young should hold the opinions of the cool and middle-aged."\r\n\r\n"Oh! oh! we are independent; we think for ourselves!" cried Mr.\r\nHelstone. "We are a little Jacobin, for anything I know--a little\r\nfreethinker, in good earnest. Let us have a confession of faith on the\r\nspot."\r\n\r\nAnd he took the heiress\'s two hands--causing her to let fall her whole\r\ncargo of flowers--and seated her by him on the sofa.\r\n\r\n"Say your creed," he ordered.\r\n\r\n"The Apostles\' Creed?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nShe said it like a child.\r\n\r\n"Now for St. Athanasius\'s. That\'s the test!"\r\n\r\n"Let me gather up my flowers. Here is Tartar coming; he will tread upon\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nTartar was a rather large, strong, and fierce-looking dog, very ugly,\r\nbeing of a breed between mastiff and bulldog, who at this moment entered\r\nthrough the glass door, and posting directly to the rug, snuffed the\r\nfresh flowers scattered there. He seemed to scorn them as food; but\r\nprobably thinking their velvety petals might be convenient as litter, he\r\nwas turning round preparatory to depositing his tawny bulk upon them,\r\nwhen Miss Helstone and Miss Keeldar simultaneously stooped to the\r\nrescue.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said the heiress, as she again held out her little apron\r\nfor Caroline to heap the blossoms into it. "Is this your daughter, Mr.\r\nHelstone?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"My niece Caroline."\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar shook hands with her, and then looked at her. Caroline also\r\nlooked at her hostess.\r\n\r\nShirley Keeldar (she had no Christian name but Shirley: her parents, who\r\nhad wished to have a son, finding that, after eight years of marriage,\r\nProvidence had granted them only a daughter, bestowed on her the same\r\nmasculine family cognomen they would have bestowed on a boy, if with a\r\nboy they had been blessed)--Shirley Keeldar was no ugly heiress. She was\r\nagreeable to the eye. Her height and shape were not unlike Miss\r\nHelstone\'s; perhaps in stature she might have the advantage by an inch\r\nor two. She was gracefully made, and her face, too, possessed a charm as\r\nwell described by the word grace as any other. It was pale naturally,\r\nbut intelligent, and of varied expression. She was not a blonde, like\r\nCaroline. Clear and dark were the characteristics of her aspect as to\r\ncolour. Her face and brow were clear, her eyes of the darkest gray (no\r\ngreen lights in them--transparent, pure, neutral gray), and her hair of\r\nthe darkest brown. Her features were distinguished--by which I do not\r\nmean that they were high, bony, and Roman, being indeed rather small and\r\nslightly marked than otherwise, but only that they were, to use a few\r\nFrench words, "fins, gracieux, spirituels"--mobile they were and\r\nspeaking; but their changes were not to be understood nor their language\r\ninterpreted all at once. She examined Caroline seriously, inclining her\r\nhead a little to one side, with a thoughtful air.\r\n\r\n"You see she is only a feeble chick," observed Mr. Helstone.\r\n\r\n"She looks young--younger than I.--How old are you?" she inquired in a\r\nmanner that would have been patronizing if it had not been extremely\r\nsolemn and simple.\r\n\r\n"Eighteen years and six months."\r\n\r\n"And I am twenty-one."\r\n\r\nShe said no more. She had now placed her flowers on the table, and was\r\nbusied in arranging them.\r\n\r\n"And St. Athanasius\'s Creed?" urged the rector. "You believe it all,\r\ndon\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t remember it quite all. I will give you a nosegay, Mr. Helstone,\r\nwhen I have given your niece one."\r\n\r\nShe had selected a little bouquet of one brilliant and two or three\r\ndelicate flowers, relieved by a spray of dark verdure. She tied it with\r\nsilk from her work-box, and placed it on Caroline\'s lap; and then she\r\nput her hands behind her, and stood bending slightly towards her guest,\r\nstill regarding her, in the attitude and with something of the aspect of\r\na grave but gallant little cavalier. This temporary expression of face\r\nwas aided by the style in which she wore her hair, parted on one temple,\r\nand brushed in a glossy sweep above the forehead, whence it fell in\r\ncurls that looked natural, so free were their wavy undulations.\r\n\r\n"Are you tired with your walk?" she inquired.\r\n\r\n"No--not in the least. It is but a short distance--but a mile."\r\n\r\n"You look pale.--Is she always so pale?" she asked, turning to the\r\nrector.\r\n\r\n"She used to be as rosy as the reddest of your flowers."\r\n\r\n"Why is she altered? What has made her pale? Has she been ill?"\r\n\r\n"She tells me she wants a change."\r\n\r\n"She ought to have one. You ought to give her one. You should send her\r\nto the sea-coast."\r\n\r\n"I will, ere summer is over. Meantime, I intend her to make acquaintance\r\nwith you, if you have no objection."\r\n\r\n"I am sure Miss Keeldar will have no objection," here observed Mrs.\r\nPryor. "I think I may take it upon me to say that Miss Helstone\'s\r\nfrequent presence at Fieldhead will be esteemed a favour."\r\n\r\n"You speak my sentiments precisely, ma\'am," said Shirley, "and I thank\r\nyou for anticipating me.--Let me tell you," she continued, turning again\r\nto Caroline, "that you also ought to thank my governess. It is not every\r\none she would welcome as she has welcomed you. You are distinguished\r\nmore than you think. This morning, as soon as you are gone, I shall ask\r\nMrs. Pryor\'s opinion of you. I am apt to rely on her judgment of\r\ncharacter, for hitherto I have found it wondrous accurate. Already I\r\nforesee a favourable answer to my inquiries.--Do I not guess rightly,\r\nMrs. Pryor?"\r\n\r\n"My dear, you said but now you would ask my opinion when Miss Helstone\r\nwas gone. I am scarcely likely to give it in her presence."\r\n\r\n"No; and perhaps it will be long enough before I obtain it.--I am\r\nsometimes sadly tantalized, Mr. Helstone, by Mrs. Pryor\'s extreme\r\ncaution. Her judgments ought to be correct when they come, for they are\r\noften as tardy of delivery as a Lord Chancellor\'s. On some people\'s\r\ncharacters I cannot get her to pronounce a sentence, entreat as I may."\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor here smiled.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said her pupil, "I know what that smile means. You are thinking\r\nof my gentleman-tenant.--Do you know Mr. Moore of the Hollow?" she asked\r\nMr. Helstone.\r\n\r\n"Ay! ay! Your tenant--so he is. You have seen a good deal of him, no\r\ndoubt, since you came?"\r\n\r\n"I have been obliged to see him. There was business to transact.\r\nBusiness! Really the word makes me conscious I am indeed no longer a\r\ngirl, but quite a woman and something more. I am an esquire! Shirley\r\nKeeldar, Esquire, ought to be my style and title. They gave me a man\'s\r\nname; I hold a man\'s position. It is enough to inspire me with a touch\r\nof manhood; and when I see such people as that stately\r\nAnglo-Belgian--that G\xc3\xa9rard Moore--before me, gravely talking to me of\r\nbusiness, really I feel quite gentlemanlike. You must choose me for your\r\nchurchwarden, Mr. Helstone, the next time you elect new ones. They ought\r\nto make me a magistrate and a captain of yeomanry. Tony Lumpkin\'s mother\r\nwas a colonel, and his aunt a justice of the peace. Why shouldn\'t I be?"\r\n\r\n"With all my heart. If you choose to get up a requisition on the\r\nsubject, I promise to head the list of signatures with my name. But you\r\nwere speaking of Moore?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! yes. I find it a little difficult to understand Mr. Moore, to know\r\nwhat to think of him, whether to like him or not. He seems a tenant of\r\nwhom any proprietor might be proud--and proud of him I am, in that\r\nsense; but as a neighbour, what is he? Again and again I have entreated\r\nMrs. Pryor to say what she thinks of him, but she still evades returning\r\na direct answer. I hope you will be less oracular, Mr. Helstone, and\r\npronounce at once. Do you like him?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all, just now. His name is entirely blotted from my good books."\r\n\r\n"What is the matter? What has he done?"\r\n\r\n"My uncle and he disagree on politics," interposed the low voice of\r\nCaroline. She had better not have spoken just then. Having scarcely\r\njoined in the conversation before, it was not apropos to do it now. She\r\nfelt this with nervous acuteness as soon as she had spoken, and coloured\r\nto the eyes.\r\n\r\n"What are Moore\'s politics?" inquired Shirley.\r\n\r\n"Those of a tradesman," returned the rector--"narrow, selfish, and\r\nunpatriotic. The man is eternally writing and speaking against the\r\ncontinuance of the war. I have no patience with him."\r\n\r\n"The war hurts his trade. I remember he remarked that only yesterday.\r\nBut what other objection have you to him?"\r\n\r\n"That is enough."\r\n\r\n"He looks the gentleman, in my sense of the term," pursued Shirley, "and\r\nit pleases me to think he is such."\r\n\r\nCaroline rent the Tyrian petals of the one brilliant flower in her\r\nbouquet, and answered in distinct tones, "Decidedly he is." Shirley,\r\nhearing this courageous affirmation, flashed an arch, searching glance\r\nat the speaker from her deep, expressive eyes.\r\n\r\n"_You_ are his friend, at any rate," she said. "You defend him in his\r\nabsence."\r\n\r\n"I am both his friend and his relative," was the prompt reply. "Robert\r\nMoore is my cousin."\r\n\r\n"Oh, then, you can tell me all about him. Just give me a sketch of his\r\ncharacter."\r\n\r\nInsuperable embarrassment seized Caroline when this demand was made. She\r\ncould not, and did not, attempt to comply with it. Her silence was\r\nimmediately covered by Mrs. Pryor, who proceeded to address sundry\r\nquestions to Mr. Helstone regarding a family or two in the\r\nneighbourhood, with whose connections in the south she said she was\r\nacquainted. Shirley soon withdrew her gaze from Miss Helstone\'s face.\r\nShe did not renew her interrogations, but returning to her flowers,\r\nproceeded to choose a nosegay for the rector. She presented it to him as\r\nhe took leave, and received the homage of a salute on the hand in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n"Be sure you wear it for my sake," said she.\r\n\r\n"Next my heart, of course," responded Helstone.--"Mrs. Pryor, take care\r\nof this future magistrate, this churchwarden in perspective, this\r\ncaptain of yeomanry, this young squire of Briarfield, in a word. Don\'t\r\nlet him exert himself too much; don\'t let him break his neck in hunting;\r\nespecially, let him mind how he rides down that dangerous hill near the\r\nHollow."\r\n\r\n"I like a descent," said Shirley; "I like to clear it rapidly; and\r\nespecially I like that romantic Hollow with all my heart."\r\n\r\n"Romantic, with a mill in it?"\r\n\r\n"Romantic with a mill in it. The old mill and the white cottage are each\r\nadmirable in its way."\r\n\r\n"And the counting-house, Mr. Keeldar?"\r\n\r\n"The counting-house is better than my bloom-coloured drawing-room. I\r\nadore the counting-house."\r\n\r\n"And the trade? The cloth, the greasy wool, the polluting dyeing-vats?"\r\n\r\n"The trade is to be thoroughly respected."\r\n\r\n"And the tradesman is a hero? Good!"\r\n\r\n"I am glad to hear you say so. I thought the tradesman looked heroic."\r\n\r\nMischief, spirit, and glee sparkled all over her face as she thus\r\nbandied words with the old Cossack, who almost equally enjoyed the tilt.\r\n\r\n"Captain Keeldar, you have no mercantile blood in your veins. Why are\r\nyou so fond of trade?"\r\n\r\n"Because I am a mill-owner, of course. Half my income comes from the\r\nworks in that Hollow."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t enter into partnership--that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve put it into my head! you\'ve put it into my head!" she exclaimed,\r\nwith a joyous laugh. "It will never get out. Thank you." And waving her\r\nhand, white as a lily and fine as a fairy\'s, she vanished within the\r\nporch, while the rector and his niece passed out through the arched\r\ngateway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSHIRLEY AND CAROLINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nShirley showed she had been sincere in saying she should be glad of\r\nCaroline\'s society, by frequently seeking it; and, indeed, if she had\r\nnot sought it, she would not have had it, for Miss Helstone was slow to\r\nmake fresh acquaintance. She was always held back by the idea that\r\npeople could not want her, that she could not amuse them; and a\r\nbrilliant, happy, youthful creature like the heiress of Fieldhead seemed\r\nto her too completely independent of society so uninteresting as hers\r\never to find it really welcome.\r\n\r\nShirley might be brilliant, and probably happy likewise, but no one is\r\nindependent of genial society; and though in about a month she had made\r\nthe acquaintance of most of the families round, and was on quite free\r\nand easy terms with all the Misses Sykes, and all the Misses Pearson,\r\nand the two superlative Misses Wynne of Walden Hall, yet, it appeared,\r\nshe found none amongst them very genial: she fraternized with none of\r\nthem, to use her own words. If she had had the bliss to be really\r\nShirley Keeldar, Esq., lord of the manor of Briarfield, there was not a\r\nsingle fair one in this and the two neighbouring parishes whom she\r\nshould have felt disposed to request to become Mrs. Keeldar, lady of the\r\nmanor. This declaration she made to Mrs. Pryor, who received it very\r\nquietly, as she did most of her pupil\'s off-hand speeches, responding,\r\n"My dear, do not allow that habit of alluding to yourself as a gentleman\r\nto be confirmed. It is a strange one. Those who do not know you, hearing\r\nyou speak thus, would think you affected masculine manners."\r\n\r\nShirley never laughed at her former governess; even the little\r\nformalities and harmless peculiarities of that lady were respectable in\r\nher eyes. Had it been otherwise, she would have proved herself a weak\r\ncharacter at once; for it is only the weak who make a butt of quiet\r\nworth. Therefore she took her remonstrance in silence. She stood\r\nquietly near the window, looking at the grand cedar on her lawn\r\nwatching a bird on one of its lower boughs. Presently she began to\r\nchirrup to the bird; soon her chirrup grew clearer; ere long she was\r\nwhistling; the whistle struck into a tune, and very sweetly and deftly\r\nit was executed.\r\n\r\n"My dear!" expostulated Mrs. Pryor.\r\n\r\n"Was I whistling?" said Shirley. "I forgot. I beg your pardon, ma\'am. I\r\nhad resolved to take care not to whistle before you."\r\n\r\n"But, Miss Keeldar, where did you learn to whistle? You must have got\r\nthe habit since you came down into Yorkshire. I never knew you guilty of\r\nit before."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I learned to whistle a long while ago."\r\n\r\n"Who taught you?"\r\n\r\n"No one. I took it up by listening, and I had laid it down again. But\r\nlately, yesterday evening, as I was coming up our lane, I heard a\r\ngentleman whistling that very tune in the field on the other side of the\r\nhedge, and that reminded me."\r\n\r\n"What gentleman was it?"\r\n\r\n"We have only one gentleman in this region, ma\'am, and that is Mr.\r\nMoore--at least he is the only gentleman who is not gray-haired. My two\r\nvenerable favourites, Mr. Helstone and Mr. Yorke, it is true, are fine\r\nold beaus, infinitely better than any of the stupid young ones."\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor was silent.\r\n\r\n"You do not like Mr. Helstone, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"My dear, Mr. Helstone\'s office secures him from criticism."\r\n\r\n"You generally contrive to leave the room when he is announced."\r\n\r\n"Do you walk out this morning, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I shall go to the rectory, and seek and find Caroline Helstone,\r\nand make her take some exercise. She shall have a breezy walk over\r\nNunnely Common."\r\n\r\n"If you go in that direction, my dear, have the goodness to remind Miss\r\nHelstone to wrap up well, as there is a fresh wind, and she appears to\r\nme to require care."\r\n\r\n"You shall be minutely obeyed, Mrs. Pryor. Meantime, will you not\r\naccompany us yourself?"\r\n\r\n"No, my love; I should be a restraint upon you. I am stout, and cannot\r\nwalk so quickly as you would wish to do."\r\n\r\nShirley easily persuaded Caroline to go with her, and when they were\r\nfairly out on the quiet road, traversing the extensive and solitary\r\nsweep of Nunnely Common, she as easily drew her into conversation. The\r\nfirst feelings of diffidence overcome, Caroline soon felt glad to talk\r\nwith Miss Keeldar. The very first interchange of slight observations\r\nsufficed to give each an idea of what the other was. Shirley said she\r\nliked the green sweep of the common turf, and, better still, the heath\r\non its ridges, for the heath reminded her of moors. She had seen moors\r\nwhen she was travelling on the borders near Scotland. She remembered\r\nparticularly a district traversed one long afternoon, on a sultry but\r\nsunless day in summer. They journeyed from noon till sunset, over what\r\nseemed a boundless waste of deep heath, and nothing had they seen but\r\nwild sheep, nothing heard but the cries of wild birds.\r\n\r\n"I know how the heath would look on such a day," said Caroline;\r\n"purple-black--a deeper shade of the sky-tint, and that would be livid."\r\n\r\n"Yes, quite livid, with brassy edges to the clouds, and here and there a\r\nwhite gleam, more ghastly than the lurid tinge, which, as you looked at\r\nit, you momentarily expected would kindle into blinding lightning."\r\n\r\n"Did it thunder?"\r\n\r\n"It muttered distant peals, but the storm did not break till evening,\r\nafter we had reached our inn--that inn being an isolated house at the\r\nfoot of a range of mountains."\r\n\r\n"Did you watch the clouds come down over the mountains?"\r\n\r\n"I did. I stood at the window an hour watching them. The hills seemed\r\nrolled in a sullen mist, and when the rain fell in whitening sheets,\r\nsuddenly they were blotted from the prospect; they were washed from the\r\nworld."\r\n\r\n"I have seen such storms in hilly districts in Yorkshire; and at their\r\nriotous climax, while the sky was all cataract, the earth all flood, I\r\nhave remembered the Deluge."\r\n\r\n"It is singularly reviving after such hurricanes to feel calm return,\r\nand from the opening clouds to receive a consolatory gleam, softly\r\ntestifying that the sun is not quenched."\r\n\r\n"Miss Keeldar, just stand still now, and look down at Nunnely dale and\r\nwood."\r\n\r\nThey both halted on the green brow of the common. They looked down on\r\nthe deep valley robed in May raiment; on varied meads, some pearled with\r\ndaisies, and some golden with king-cups. To-day all this young verdure\r\nsmiled clear in sunlight; transparent emerald and amber gleams played\r\nover it. On Nunnwood--the sole remnant of antique British forest in a\r\nregion whose lowlands were once all silvan chase, as its highlands were\r\nbreast-deep heather--slept the shadow of a cloud; the distant hills were\r\ndappled, the horizon was shaded and tinted like mother-of-pearl; silvery\r\nblues, soft purples, evanescent greens and rose-shades, all melting into\r\nfleeces of white cloud, pure as azury snow, allured the eye as with a\r\nremote glimpse of heaven\'s foundations. The air blowing on the brow was\r\nfresh, and sweet, and bracing.\r\n\r\n"Our England is a bonny island," said Shirley, "and Yorkshire is one of\r\nher bonniest nooks."\r\n\r\n"You are a Yorkshire girl too?"\r\n\r\n"I am--Yorkshire in blood and birth. Five generations of my race sleep\r\nunder the aisles of Briarfield Church. I drew my first breath in the old\r\nblack hall behind us."\r\n\r\nHereupon Caroline presented her hand, which was accordingly taken and\r\nshaken. "We are compatriots," said she.\r\n\r\n"Yes," agreed Shirley, with a grave nod.\r\n\r\n"And that," asked Miss Keeldar, pointing to the forest--"that is\r\nNunnwood?"\r\n\r\n"It is."\r\n\r\n"Were you ever there?"\r\n\r\n"Many a time."\r\n\r\n"In the heart of it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"What is it like?"\r\n\r\n"It is like an encampment of forest sons of Anak. The trees are huge and\r\nold. When you stand at their roots, the summits seem in another region.\r\nThe trunks remain still and firm as pillars, while the boughs sway to\r\nevery breeze. In the deepest calm their leaves are never quite hushed,\r\nand in high wind a flood rushes, a sea thunders above you."\r\n\r\n"Was it not one of Robin Hood\'s haunts?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and there are mementos of him still existing. To penetrate into\r\nNunnwood, Miss Keeldar, is to go far back into the dim days of old. Can\r\nyou see a break in the forest, about the centre?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, distinctly."\r\n\r\n"That break is a dell--a deep, hollow cup, lined with turf as green and\r\nshort as the sod of this common. The very oldest of the trees, gnarled\r\nmighty oaks, crowd about the brink of this dell. In the bottom lie the\r\nruins of a nunnery."\r\n\r\n"We will go--you and I alone, Caroline--to that wood, early some fine\r\nsummer morning, and spend a long day there. We can take pencils and\r\nsketch-books, and any interesting reading book we like; and of course we\r\nshall take something to eat. I have two little baskets, in which Mrs.\r\nGill, my housekeeper, might pack our provisions, and we could each carry\r\nour own. It would not tire you too much to walk so far?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no; especially if we rested the whole day in the wood. And I know\r\nall the pleasantest spots. I know where we could get nuts in nutting\r\ntime; I know where wild strawberries abound; I know certain lonely,\r\nquite untrodden glades, carpeted with strange mosses, some yellow as if\r\ngilded, some a sober gray, some gem-green. I know groups of trees that\r\nravish the eye with their perfect, picture-like effects--rude oak,\r\ndelicate birch, glossy beech, clustered in contrast; and ash trees\r\nstately as Saul, standing isolated; and superannuated wood-giants clad\r\nin bright shrouds of ivy. Miss Keeldar, I could guide you."\r\n\r\n"You would be dull with me alone?"\r\n\r\n"I should not. I think we should suit; and what third person is there\r\nwhose presence would not spoil our pleasure?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I know of none about our own ages--no lady at least; and as to\r\ngentlemen----"\r\n\r\n"An excursion becomes quite a different thing when there are gentlemen\r\nof the party," interrupted Caroline.\r\n\r\n"I agree with you--quite a different thing to what we were proposing."\r\n\r\n"We were going simply to see the old trees, the old ruins; to pass a day\r\nin old times, surrounded by olden silence, and above all by quietude."\r\n\r\n"You are right; and the presence of gentlemen dispels the last charm, I\r\nthink. If they are of the wrong sort, like your Malones, and your young\r\nSykes, and Wynnes, irritation takes the place of serenity. If they are\r\nof the right sort, there is still a change; I can hardly tell what\r\nchange--one easy to feel, difficult to describe."\r\n\r\n"We forget Nature, _imprimis_."\r\n\r\n"And then Nature forgets us, covers her vast calm brow with a dim veil,\r\nconceals her face, and withdraws the peaceful joy with which, if we had\r\nbeen content to worship her only, she would have filled our hearts."\r\n\r\n"What does she give us instead?"\r\n\r\n"More elation and more anxiety; an excitement that steals the hours away\r\nfast, and a trouble that ruffles their course."\r\n\r\n"Our power of being happy lies a good deal in ourselves, I believe,"\r\nremarked Caroline sagely. "I have gone to Nunnwood with a large\r\nparty--all the curates and some other gentry of these parts, together\r\nwith sundry ladies--and I found the affair insufferably tedious and\r\nabsurd; and I have gone quite alone, or accompanied but by Fanny, who\r\nsat in the woodman\'s hut and sewed, or talked to the goodwife, while I\r\nroamed about and made sketches, or read; and I have enjoyed much\r\nhappiness of a quiet kind all day long. But that was when I was\r\nyoung--two years ago."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever go with your cousin, Robert Moore?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; once."\r\n\r\n"What sort of a companion is he on these occasions?"\r\n\r\n"A cousin, you know, is different to a stranger."\r\n\r\n"I am aware of that; but cousins, if they are stupid, are still more\r\ninsupportable than strangers, because you cannot so easily keep them at\r\na distance. But your cousin is not stupid?"\r\n\r\n"No; but----"\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"If the company of fools irritates, as you say, the society of clever\r\nmen leaves its own peculiar pain also. Where the goodness or talent of\r\nyour friend is beyond and above all doubt, your own worthiness to be his\r\nassociate often becomes a matter of question."\r\n\r\n"Oh! there I cannot follow you. That crotchet is not one I should choose\r\nto entertain for an instant. I consider myself not unworthy to be the\r\nassociate of the best of them--of gentlemen, I mean--though that is\r\nsaying a great deal. Where they are good, they are very good, I believe.\r\nYour uncle, by-the-bye, is not a bad specimen of the elderly gentleman.\r\nI am always glad to see his brown, keen, sensible old face, either in my\r\nown house or any other. Are you fond of him? Is he kind to you? Now,\r\nspeak the truth."\r\n\r\n"He has brought me up from childhood, I doubt not, precisely as he would\r\nhave brought up his own daughter, if he had had one; and that is\r\nkindness. But I am not fond of him. I would rather be out of his\r\npresence than in it."\r\n\r\n"Strange, when he has the art of making himself so agreeable."\r\n\r\n"Yes, in company; but he is stern and silent at home. As he puts away\r\nhis cane and shovel-hat in the rectory hall, so he locks his liveliness\r\nin his book-case and study-desk: the knitted brow and brief word for the\r\nfireside; the smile, the jest, the witty sally for society."\r\n\r\n"Is he tyrannical?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least. He is neither tyrannical nor hypocritical. He is\r\nsimply a man who is rather liberal than good-natured, rather brilliant\r\nthan genial, rather scrupulously equitable than truly just--if you can\r\nunderstand such superfine distinctions."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes! Good-nature implies indulgence, which he has not; geniality,\r\nwarmth of heart, which he does not own; and genuine justice is the\r\noffspring of sympathy and considerateness, of which, I can well\r\nconceive, my bronzed old friend is quite innocent."\r\n\r\n"I often wonder, Shirley, whether most men resemble my uncle in their\r\ndomestic relations; whether it is necessary to be new and unfamiliar to\r\nthem in order to seem agreeable or estimable in their eyes; and whether\r\nit is impossible to their natures to retain a constant interest and\r\naffection for those they see every day."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I can\'t clear up your doubts. I ponder over similar ones\r\nmyself sometimes. But, to tell you a secret, if I were convinced that\r\nthey are necessarily and universally different from us--fickle, soon\r\npetrifying, unsympathizing--I would never marry. I should not like to\r\nfind out that what I loved did not love me, that it was weary of me, and\r\nthat whatever effort I might make to please would hereafter be worse\r\nthan useless, since it was inevitably in its nature to change and become\r\nindifferent. That discovery once made, what should I long for? To go\r\naway, to remove from a presence where my society gave no pleasure."\r\n\r\n"But you could not if you were married."\r\n\r\n"No, I could not. There it is. I could never be my own mistress more. A\r\nterrible thought! It suffocates me! Nothing irks me like the idea of\r\nbeing a burden and a bore--an inevitable burden, a ceaseless bore! Now,\r\nwhen I feel my company superfluous, I can comfortably fold my\r\nindependence round me like a mantle, and drop my pride like a veil, and\r\nwithdraw to solitude. If married, that could not be."\r\n\r\n"I wonder we don\'t all make up our minds to remain single," said\r\nCaroline. "We should if we listened to the wisdom of experience. My\r\nuncle always speaks of marriage as a burden; and I believe whenever he\r\nhears of a man being married he invariably regards him as a fool, or, at\r\nany rate, as doing a foolish thing."\r\n\r\n"But, Caroline, men are not all like your uncle. Surely not. I hope\r\nnot."\r\n\r\nShe paused and mused.\r\n\r\n"I suppose we each find an exception in the one we love, till we _are_\r\nmarried," suggested Caroline.\r\n\r\n"I suppose so. And this exception we believe to be of sterling\r\nmaterials. We fancy it like ourselves; we imagine a sense of harmony. We\r\nthink his voice gives the softest, truest promise of a heart that will\r\nnever harden against us; we read in his eyes that faithful\r\nfeeling--affection. I don\'t think we should trust to what they call\r\npassion at all, Caroline. I believe it is a mere fire of dry sticks,\r\nblazing up and vanishing. But we watch him, and see him kind to animals,\r\nto little children, to poor people. He is kind to us likewise, good,\r\nconsiderate. He does not flatter women, but he is patient with them, and\r\nhe seems to be easy in their presence, and to find their company genial.\r\nHe likes them not only for vain and selfish reasons, but as _we_ like\r\nhim--because we like him. Then we observe that he is just, that he\r\nalways speaks the truth, that he is conscientious. We feel joy and peace\r\nwhen he comes into a room; we feel sadness and trouble when he leaves\r\nit. We know that this man has been a kind son, that he is a kind\r\nbrother. Will any one dare to tell me that he will not be a kind\r\nhusband?"\r\n\r\n"My uncle would affirm it unhesitatingly. \'He will be sick of you in a\r\nmonth,\' he would say."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Pryor would seriously intimate the same."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Yorke and Miss Mann would darkly suggest ditto."\r\n\r\n"If they are true oracles, it is good never to fall in love."\r\n\r\n"Very good, if you can avoid it."\r\n\r\n"I choose to doubt their truth."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid that proves you are already caught."\r\n\r\n"Not I. But if I were, do you know what soothsayers I would consult?"\r\n\r\n"Let me hear."\r\n\r\n"Neither man nor woman, elderly nor young: the little Irish beggar that\r\ncomes barefoot to my door; the mouse that steals out of the cranny in\r\nthe wainscot; the bird that in frost and snow pecks at my window for a\r\ncrumb; the dog that licks my hand and sits beside my knee."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see any one who was kind to such things?"\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see any one whom such things seemed instinctively to\r\nfollow, like, rely on?"\r\n\r\n"We have a black cat and an old dog at the rectory. I know somebody to\r\nwhose knee that black cat loves to climb, against whose shoulder and\r\ncheek it likes to purr. The old dog always comes out of his kennel and\r\nwags his tail, and whines affectionately when somebody passes."\r\n\r\n"And what does that somebody do?"\r\n\r\n"He quietly strokes the cat, and lets her sit while he conveniently can;\r\nand when he must disturb her by rising, he puts her softly down, and\r\nnever flings her from him roughly. He always whistles to the dog and\r\ngives him a caress."\r\n\r\n"Does he? It is not Robert?"\r\n\r\n"But it is Robert."\r\n\r\n"Handsome fellow!" said Shirley, with enthusiasm. Her eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n"Is he not handsome? Has he not fine eyes and well-cut features, and a\r\nclear, princely forehead?"\r\n\r\n"He has all that, Caroline. Bless him! he is both graceful and good."\r\n\r\n"I was sure you would see that he was. When I first looked at your face\r\nI knew you would."\r\n\r\n"I was well inclined to him before I saw him. I liked him when I did see\r\nhim. I admire him now. There is charm in beauty for itself, Caroline;\r\nwhen it is blent with goodness, there is a powerful charm."\r\n\r\n"When mind is added, Shirley?"\r\n\r\n"Who can resist it?"\r\n\r\n"Remember my uncle, Mesdames Pryor, Yorke, and Mann."\r\n\r\n"Remember the croaking of the frogs of Egypt. He is a noble being. I\r\ntell you when they _are_ good they are the lords of the creation--they\r\nare the sons of God. Moulded in their Maker\'s image, the minutest spark\r\nof His spirit lifts them almost above mortality. Indisputably, a great,\r\ngood, handsome man is the first of created things."\r\n\r\n"Above us?"\r\n\r\n"I would scorn to contend for empire with him--I would scorn it. Shall\r\nmy left hand dispute for precedence with my right? Shall my heart\r\nquarrel with my pulse? Shall my veins be jealous of the blood which\r\nfills them?"\r\n\r\n"Men and women, husbands and wives, quarrel horribly, Shirley."\r\n\r\n"Poor things! Poor, fallen, degenerate things! God made them for another\r\nlot, for other feelings."\r\n\r\n"But are we men\'s equals, or are we not?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing ever charms me more than when I meet my superior--one who makes\r\nme sincerely feel that he is my superior."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever meet him?"\r\n\r\n"I should be glad to see him any day. The higher above me, so much the\r\nbetter. It degrades to stoop; it is glorious to look up. What frets me\r\nis, that when I try to esteem, I am baffled; when religiously inclined,\r\nthere are but false gods to adore. I disdain to be a pagan."\r\n\r\n"Miss Keeldar, will you come in? We are here at the rectory gates."\r\n\r\n"Not to-day, but to-morrow I shall fetch you to spend the evening with\r\nme. Caroline Helstone, if you really are what at present to me you seem,\r\nyou and I will suit. I have never in my whole life been able to talk to\r\na young lady as I have talked to you this morning. Kiss me--and\r\ngood-bye."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor seemed as well disposed to cultivate Caroline\'s acquaintance\r\nas Shirley. She, who went nowhere else, called on an early day at the\r\nrectory. She came in the afternoon, when the rector happened to be out.\r\nIt was rather a close day; the heat of the weather had flushed her, and\r\nshe seemed fluttered too by the circumstance of entering a strange\r\nhouse, for it appeared her habits were most retiring and secluded. When\r\nMiss Helstone went to her in the dining-room she found her seated on the\r\nsofa, trembling, fanning herself with her handkerchief, and seeming to\r\ncontend with a nervous discomposure that threatened to become\r\nhysterical.\r\n\r\nCaroline marvelled somewhat at this unusual want of self-command in a\r\nlady of her years, and also at the lack of real strength in one who\r\nappeared almost robust--for Mrs. Pryor hastened to allege the fatigue of\r\nher walk, the heat of the sun, etc., as reasons for her temporary\r\nindisposition; and still as, with more hurry than coherence, she again\r\nand again enumerated these causes of exhaustion, Caroline gently sought\r\nto relieve her by opening her shawl and removing her bonnet. Attentions\r\nof this sort Mrs. Pryor would not have accepted from every one. In\r\ngeneral she recoiled from touch or close approach with a mixture of\r\nembarrassment and coldness far from flattering to those who offered her\r\naid. To Miss Helstone\'s little light hand, however, she yielded\r\ntractably, and seemed soothed by its contact. In a few minutes she\r\nceased to tremble, and grew quiet and tranquil.\r\n\r\nHer usual manner being resumed, she proceeded to talk of ordinary\r\ntopics. In a miscellaneous company Mrs. Pryor rarely opened her lips,\r\nor, if obliged to speak, she spoke under restraint, and consequently not\r\nwell; in dialogue she was a good converser. Her language, always a\r\nlittle formal, was well chosen; her sentiments were just; her\r\ninformation was varied and correct. Caroline felt it pleasant to listen\r\nto her, more pleasant than she could have anticipated.\r\n\r\nOn the wall opposite the sofa where they sat hung three pictures--the\r\ncentre one, above the mantelpiece, that of a lady; the two others, male\r\nportraits.\r\n\r\n"That is a beautiful face," said Mrs. Pryor, interrupting a brief pause\r\nwhich had followed half an hour\'s animated conversation. "The features\r\nmay be termed perfect; no statuary\'s chisel could improve them. It is a\r\nportrait from the life, I presume?"\r\n\r\n"It is a portrait of Mrs. Helstone."\r\n\r\n"Of Mrs. Matthewson Helstone? Of your uncle\'s wife?"\r\n\r\n"It is, and is said to be a good likeness. Before her marriage she was\r\naccounted the beauty of the district."\r\n\r\n"I should say she merited the distinction. What accuracy in all the\r\nlineaments! It is, however, a passive face. The original could not have\r\nbeen what is generally termed \'a woman of spirit.\'"\r\n\r\n"I believe she was a remarkably still, silent person."\r\n\r\n"One would scarcely have expected, my dear, that your uncle\'s choice\r\nshould have fallen on a partner of that description. Is he not fond of\r\nbeing amused by lively chat?"\r\n\r\n"In company he is. But he always says he could never do with a talking\r\nwife. He must have quiet at home. You go out to gossip, he affirms; you\r\ncome home to read and reflect."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Matthewson lived but a few years after her marriage, I think I\r\nhave heard?"\r\n\r\n"About five years."\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear," pursued Mrs. Pryor, rising to go, "I trust it is\r\nunderstood that you will frequently come to Fieldhead. I hope you will.\r\nYou must feel lonely here, having no female relative in the house; you\r\nmust necessarily pass much of your time in solitude."\r\n\r\n"I am inured to it. I have grown up by myself. May I arrange your shawl\r\nfor you?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor submitted to be assisted.\r\n\r\n"Should you chance to require help in your studies," she said, "you may\r\ncommand me."\r\n\r\nCaroline expressed her sense of such kindness.\r\n\r\n"I hope to have frequent conversations with you. I should wish to be of\r\nuse to you."\r\n\r\nAgain Miss Helstone returned thanks. She thought what a kind heart was\r\nhidden under her visitor\'s seeming chilliness. Observing that Mrs. Pryor\r\nagain glanced with an air of interest towards the portraits, as she\r\nwalked down the room, Caroline casually explained: "The likeness that\r\nhangs near the window, you will see, is my uncle, taken twenty years\r\nago; the other, to the left of the mantelpiece, is his brother James, my\r\nfather."\r\n\r\n"They resemble each other in some measure," said Mrs. Pryor; "yet a\r\ndifference of character may be traced in the different mould of the brow\r\nand mouth."\r\n\r\n"What difference?" inquired Caroline, accompanying her to the door.\r\n"James Helstone--that is, my father--is generally considered the\r\nbest-looking of the two. Strangers, I remark, always exclaim, \'What a\r\nhandsome man!\' Do you think his picture handsome, Mrs. Pryor?"\r\n\r\n"It is much softer or finer featured than that of your uncle."\r\n\r\n"But where or what is the difference of character to which you alluded?\r\nTell me. I wish to see if you guess right."\r\n\r\n"My dear, your uncle is a man of principle. His forehead and his lips\r\nare firm, and his eye is steady."\r\n\r\n"Well, and the other? Do not be afraid of offending me. I always like\r\nthe truth."\r\n\r\n"Do you like the truth? It is well for you. Adhere to that\r\npreference--never swerve thence. The other, my dear, if he had been\r\nliving now, would probably have furnished little support to his\r\ndaughter. It is, however, a graceful head--taken in youth, I should\r\nthink. My dear" (turning abruptly), "you acknowledge an inestimable\r\nvalue in principle?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure no character can have true worth without it."\r\n\r\n"You feel what you say? You have considered the subject?"\r\n\r\n"Often. Circumstances early forced it upon my attention."\r\n\r\n"The lesson was not lost, then, though it came so prematurely. I suppose\r\nthe soil is not light nor stony, otherwise seed falling in that season\r\nnever would have borne fruit. My dear, do not stand in the air of the\r\ndoor; you will take cold. Good-afternoon."\r\n\r\nMiss Helstone\'s new acquaintance soon became of value to her: their\r\nsociety was acknowledged a privilege. She found she would have been in\r\nerror indeed to have let slip this chance of relief, to have neglected\r\nto avail herself of this happy change. A turn was thereby given to her\r\nthoughts; a new channel was opened for them, which, diverting a few of\r\nthem at least from the one direction in which all had hitherto tended,\r\nabated the impetuosity of their rush, and lessened the force of their\r\npressure on one worn-down point.\r\n\r\nSoon she was content to spend whole days at Fieldhead, doing by turns\r\nwhatever Shirley or Mrs. Pryor wished her to do; and now one would claim\r\nher, now the other. Nothing could be less demonstrative than the\r\nfriendship of the elder lady, but also nothing could be more vigilant,\r\nassiduous, untiring. I have intimated that she was a peculiar personage,\r\nand in nothing was her peculiarity more shown than in the nature of the\r\ninterest she evinced for Caroline. She watched all her movements; she\r\nseemed as if she would have guarded all her steps. It gave her pleasure\r\nto be applied to by Miss Helstone for advice and assistance. She yielded\r\nher aid, when asked, with such quiet yet obvious enjoyment that Caroline\r\nere long took delight in depending on her.\r\n\r\nShirley Keeldar\'s complete docility with Mrs. Pryor had at first\r\nsurprised Miss Helstone, and not less the fact of the reserved\r\nex-governess being so much at home and at ease in the residence of her\r\nyoung pupil, where she filled with such quiet independency a very\r\ndependent post; but she soon found that it needed but to know both\r\nladies to comprehend fully the enigma. Every one, it seemed to her, must\r\nlike, must love, must prize Mrs. Pryor when they knew her. No matter\r\nthat she perseveringly wore old-fashioned gowns; that her speech was\r\nformal and her manner cool; that she had twenty little ways such as\r\nnobody else had: she was still such a stay, such a counsellor, so\r\ntruthful, so kind in her way, that, in Caroline\'s idea, none once\r\naccustomed to her presence could easily afford to dispense with it.\r\n\r\nAs to dependency or humiliation, Caroline did not feel it in her\r\nintercourse with Shirley, and why should Mrs. Pryor? The heiress was\r\nrich--very rich--compared with her new friend: one possessed a clear\r\nthousand a year, the other not a penny; and yet there was a safe sense\r\nof equality experienced in her society, never known in that of the\r\nordinary Briarfield and Whinbury gentry.\r\n\r\nThe reason was, Shirley\'s head ran on other things than money and\r\nposition. She was glad to be independent as to property; by fits she was\r\neven elated at the notion of being lady of the manor, and having tenants\r\nand an estate. She was especially tickled with an agreeable complacency\r\nwhen reminded of "all that property" down in the Hollow, "comprising an\r\nexcellent cloth-mill, dyehouse, warehouse, together with the messuage,\r\ngardens, and outbuildings, termed Hollow\'s Cottage;" but her exultation\r\nbeing quite undisguised was singularly inoffensive; and, for her serious\r\nthoughts, they tended elsewhere. To admire the great, reverence the\r\ngood, and be joyous with the genial, was very much the bent of Shirley\'s\r\nsoul: she mused, therefore, on the means of following this bent far\r\noftener than she pondered on her social superiority.\r\n\r\nIn Caroline Miss Keeldar had first taken an interest because she was\r\nquiet, retiring, looked delicate, and seemed as if she needed some one\r\nto take care of her. Her predilection increased greatly when she\r\ndiscovered that her own way of thinking and talking was understood and\r\nresponded to by this new acquaintance. She had hardly expected it. Miss\r\nHelstone, she fancied, had too pretty a face, manners and voice too\r\nsoft, to be anything out of the common way in mind and attainments; and\r\nshe very much wondered to see the gentle features light up archly to the\r\nreveille of a dry sally or two risked by herself; and more did she\r\nwonder to discover the self-won knowledge treasured, and the untaught\r\nspeculations working in that girlish, curl-veiled head. Caroline\'s\r\ninstinct of taste, too, was like her own. Such books as Miss Keeldar had\r\nread with the most pleasure were Miss Helstone\'s delight also. They held\r\nmany aversions too in common, and could have the comfort of laughing\r\ntogether over works of false sentimentality and pompous pretension.\r\n\r\nFew, Shirley conceived, men or women have the right taste in poetry, the\r\nright sense for discriminating between what is real and what is false.\r\nShe had again and again heard very clever people pronounce this or that\r\npassage, in this or that versifier, altogether admirable, which, when\r\nshe read, her soul refused to acknowledge as anything but cant,\r\nflourish, and tinsel, or at the best elaborate wordiness, curious,\r\nclever, learned, perhaps, haply even tinged with the fascinating hues of\r\nfancy, but, God knows, as different from real poetry as the gorgeous and\r\nmassy vase of mosaic is from the little cup of pure metal; or, to give\r\nthe reader a choice of similes, as the milliner\'s artificial wreath is\r\nfrom the fresh-gathered lily of the field.\r\n\r\nCaroline, she found, felt the value of the true ore, and knew the\r\ndeception of the flashy dross. The minds of the two girls being toned in\r\nharmony often chimed very sweetly together.\r\n\r\nOne evening they chanced to be alone in the oak-parlour. They had passed\r\na long wet day together without _ennui_. It was now on the edge of dark;\r\ncandles were not yet brought in; both, as twilight deepened, grew\r\nmeditative and silent. A western wind roared high round the hall,\r\ndriving wild clouds and stormy rain up from the far-remote ocean; all\r\nwas tempest outside the antique lattices, all deep peace within. Shirley\r\nsat at the window, watching the rack in heaven, the mist on earth,\r\nlistening to certain notes of the gale that plained like restless\r\nspirits--notes which, had she not been so young, gay, and healthy, would\r\nhave swept her trembling nerves like some omen, some anticipatory dirge.\r\nIn this her prime of existence and bloom of beauty they but subdued\r\nvivacity to pensiveness. Snatches of sweet ballads haunted her ear; now\r\nand then she sang a stanza. Her accents obeyed the fitful impulse of the\r\nwind; they swelled as its gusts rushed on, and died as they wandered\r\naway. Caroline, withdrawn to the farthest and darkest end of the room,\r\nher figure just discernible by the ruby shine of the flameless fire,\r\nwas pacing to and fro, muttering to herself fragments of well-remembered\r\npoetry. She spoke very low, but Shirley heard her; and while singing\r\nsoftly, she listened. This was the strain:--\r\n\r\n    "Obscurest night involved the sky,\r\n       The Atlantic billows roared,\r\n     When such a destined wretch as I,\r\n       Washed headlong from on board,\r\n     Of friends, of hope, of all bereft,\r\n     His floating home for ever left."\r\n\r\nHere the fragment stopped, because Shirley\'s song, erewhile somewhat\r\nfull and thrilling, had become delicately faint.\r\n\r\n"Go on," said she.\r\n\r\n"Then you go on too. I was only repeating \'The Castaway.\'"\r\n\r\n"I know. If you can remember it all, say it all."\r\n\r\nAnd as it was nearly dark, and, after all, Miss Keeldar was no\r\nformidable auditor, Caroline went through it. She went through it as she\r\nshould have gone through it. The wild sea, the drowning mariner, the\r\nreluctant ship swept on in the storm, you heard were realized by her;\r\nand more vividly was realized the heart of the poet, who did not weep\r\nfor "The Castaway," but who, in an hour of tearless anguish, traced a\r\nsemblance to his own God-abandoned misery in the fate of that\r\nman-forsaken sailor, and cried from the depths where he struggled,--\r\n\r\n    "No voice divine the storm allayed,\r\n       No light propitious shone,\r\n     When, snatched from all effectual aid,\r\n       We perished--each alone!\r\n     But I beneath a rougher sea,\r\n     And whelmed in deeper gulfs than he."\r\n\r\n"I hope William Cowper is safe and calm in heaven now," said Caroline.\r\n\r\n"Do you pity what he suffered on earth?" asked Miss Keeldar.\r\n\r\n"Pity him, Shirley? What can I do else? He was nearly broken-hearted\r\nwhen he wrote that poem, and it almost breaks one\'s heart to read it.\r\nBut he found relief in writing it--I know he did; and that gift of\r\npoetry--the most divine bestowed on man--was, I believe, granted to\r\nallay emotions when their strength threatens harm. It seems to me,\r\nShirley, that nobody should write poetry to exhibit intellect or\r\nattainment. Who cares for that sort of poetry? Who cares for\r\nlearning--who cares for fine words in poetry? And who does not care for\r\nfeeling--real feeling--however simply, even rudely expressed?"\r\n\r\n"It seems you care for it, at all events; and certainly, in hearing that\r\npoem, one discovers that Cowper was under an impulse strong as that of\r\nthe wind which drove the ship--an impulse which, while it would not\r\nsuffer him to stop to add ornament to a single stanza, filled him with\r\nforce to achieve the whole with consummate perfection. You managed to\r\nrecite it with a steady voice, Caroline. I wonder thereat."\r\n\r\n"Cowper\'s hand did not tremble in writing the lines. Why should my voice\r\nfalter in repeating them? Depend on it, Shirley, no tear blistered the\r\nmanuscript of \'The Castaway.\' I hear in it no sob of sorrow, only the\r\ncry of despair; but, that cry uttered, I believe the deadly spasm passed\r\nfrom his heart, that he wept abundantly, and was comforted."\r\n\r\nShirley resumed her ballad minstrelsy. Stopping short, she remarked ere\r\nlong, "One could have loved Cowper, if it were only for the sake of\r\nhaving the privilege of comforting him."\r\n\r\n"You never would have loved Cowper," rejoined Caroline promptly. "He was\r\nnot made to be loved by woman."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"What I say. I know there is a kind of natures in the world--and very\r\nnoble, elevated natures too--whom love never comes near. You might have\r\nsought Cowper with the intention of loving him, and you would have\r\nlooked at him, pitied him, and left him, forced away by a sense of the\r\nimpossible, the incongruous, as the crew were borne from their drowning\r\ncomrade by \'the furious blast.\'"\r\n\r\n"You may be right. Who told you this?"\r\n\r\n"And what I say of Cowper, I should say of Rousseau. Was Rousseau ever\r\nloved? He loved passionately; but was his passion ever returned? I am\r\ncertain, never. And if there were any female Cowpers and Rousseaus, I\r\nshould assert the same of them."\r\n\r\n"Who told you this, I ask? Did Moore?"\r\n\r\n"Why should anybody have told me? Have I not an instinct? Can I not\r\ndivine by analogy? Moore never talked to me either about Cowper, or\r\nRousseau, or love. The voice we hear in solitude told me all I know on\r\nthese subjects."\r\n\r\n"Do you like characters of the Rousseau order, Caroline?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all, as a whole. I sympathize intensely with certain qualities\r\nthey possess. Certain divine sparks in their nature dazzle my eyes, and\r\nmake my soul glow. Then, again, I scorn them. They are made of clay and\r\ngold. The refuse and the ore make a mass of weakness: taken altogether,\r\nI feel them unnatural, unhealthy, repulsive."\r\n\r\n"I dare say I should be more tolerant of a Rousseau than you would,\r\nCary. Submissive and contemplative yourself, you like the stern and the\r\npractical. By the way, you must miss that Cousin Robert of yours very\r\nmuch, now that you and he never meet."\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"And he must miss you?"\r\n\r\n"That he does not."\r\n\r\n"I cannot imagine," pursued Shirley, who had lately got a habit of\r\nintroducing Moore\'s name into the conversation, even when it seemed to\r\nhave no business there--"I cannot imagine but that he was fond of you,\r\nsince he took so much notice of you, talked to you, and taught you so\r\nmuch."\r\n\r\n"He never was fond of me; he never professed to be fond of me. He took\r\npains to prove that he only just tolerated me."\r\n\r\nCaroline, determined not to err on the flattering side in estimating her\r\ncousin\'s regard for her, always now habitually thought of it and\r\nmentioned it in the most scanty measure. She had her own reasons for\r\nbeing less sanguine than ever in hopeful views of the future, less\r\nindulgent to pleasurable retrospections of the past.\r\n\r\n"Of course, then," observed Miss Keeldar, "you only just tolerated him\r\nin return?"\r\n\r\n"Shirley, men and women are so different; they are in such a different\r\nposition. Women have so few things to think about, men so many. You may\r\nhave a friendship for a man, while he is almost indifferent to you. Much\r\nof what cheers your life may be dependent on him, while not a feeling or\r\ninterest of moment in his eyes may have reference to you. Robert used to\r\nbe in the habit of going to London, sometimes for a week or a fortnight\r\ntogether. Well, while he was away, I found his absence a void. There\r\nwas something wanting; Briarfield was duller. Of course, I had my usual\r\noccupations; still I missed him. As I sat by myself in the evenings, I\r\nused to feel a strange certainty of conviction I cannot describe, that\r\nif a magician or a genius had, at that moment, offered me Prince Ali\'s\r\ntube (you remember it in the \'Arabian Nights\'?), and if, with its aid, I\r\nhad been enabled to take a view of Robert--to see where he was, how\r\noccupied--I should have learned, in a startling manner, the width of the\r\nchasm which gaped between such as he and such as I. I knew that, however\r\nmy thoughts might adhere to him, his were effectually sundered from me."\r\n\r\n"Caroline," demanded Miss Keeldar abruptly, "don\'t you wish you had a\r\nprofession--a trade?"\r\n\r\n"I wish it fifty times a day. As it is, I often wonder what I came into\r\nthe world for. I long to have something absorbing and compulsory to fill\r\nmy head and hands and to occupy my thoughts."\r\n\r\n"Can labour alone make a human being happy?"\r\n\r\n"No; but it can give varieties of pain, and prevent us from breaking our\r\nhearts with a single tyrant master-torture. Besides, successful labour\r\nhas its recompense; a vacant, weary, lonely, hopeless life has none."\r\n\r\n"But hard labour and learned professions, they say, make women\r\nmasculine, coarse, unwomanly."\r\n\r\n"And what does it signify whether unmarried and never-to-be-married\r\nwomen are unattractive and inelegant or not? Provided only they are\r\ndecent, decorous, and neat, it is enough. The utmost which ought to be\r\nrequired of old maids, in the way of appearance, is that they should not\r\nabsolutely offend men\'s eyes as they pass them in the street; for the\r\nrest, they should be allowed, without too much scorn, to be as absorbed,\r\ngrave, plain-looking, and plain-dressed as they please."\r\n\r\n"You might be an old maid yourself, Caroline, you speak so earnestly."\r\n\r\n"I shall be one. It is my destiny. I will never marry a Malone or a\r\nSykes; and no one else will ever marry me."\r\n\r\nHere fell a long pause. Shirley broke it. Again the name by which she\r\nseemed bewitched was almost the first on her lips.\r\n\r\n"Lina--did not Moore call you Lina sometimes?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. It is sometimes used as the abbreviation of Caroline in his native\r\ncountry."\r\n\r\n"Well, Lina, do you remember my one day noticing an inequality in your\r\nhair--a curl wanting on that right side--and your telling me that it was\r\nRobert\'s fault, as he had once cut therefrom a long lock?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"If he is, and always was, as indifferent to you as you say, why did he\r\nsteal your hair?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know--yes, I do. It was my doing, not his. Everything of that\r\nsort always was my doing. He was going from home--to London, as usual;\r\nand the night before he went, I had found in his sister\'s workbox a lock\r\nof black hair--a short, round curl. Hortense told me it was her\r\nbrother\'s, and a keepsake. He was sitting near the table. I looked at\r\nhis head. He has plenty of hair; on the temples were many such round\r\ncurls. I thought he could spare me one. I knew I should like to have it,\r\nand I asked for it. He said, on condition that he might have his choice\r\nof a tress from my head. So he got one of my long locks of hair, and I\r\ngot one of his short ones. I keep his, but I dare say he has lost mine.\r\nIt was my doing, and one of those silly deeds it distresses the heart\r\nand sets the face on fire to think of; one of those small but sharp\r\nrecollections that return, lacerating your self-respect like tiny\r\npenknives, and forcing from your lips, as you sit alone, sudden,\r\ninsane-sounding interjections."\r\n\r\n"Caroline!"\r\n\r\n"I _do_ think myself a fool, Shirley, in some respects; I _do_ despise\r\nmyself. But I said I would not make you my confessor, for you cannot\r\nreciprocate foible for foible; you are not weak. How steadily you watch\r\nme now! Turn aside your clear, strong, she-eagle eye; it is an insult to\r\nfix it on me thus."\r\n\r\n"What a study of character you are--weak, certainly, but not in the\r\nsense you think!--Come in!"\r\n\r\nThis was said in answer to a tap at the door. Miss Keeldar happened to\r\nbe near it at the moment, Caroline at the other end of the room. She saw\r\na note put into Shirley\'s hands, and heard the words, "From Mr. Moore,\r\nma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Bring candles," said Miss Keeldar.\r\n\r\nCaroline sat expectant.\r\n\r\n"A communication on business," said the heiress; but when candles were\r\nbrought, she neither opened nor read it. The rector\'s Fanny was\r\npresently announced, and the rector\'s niece went home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nFURTHER COMMUNICATIONS ON BUSINESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Shirley\'s nature prevailed at times an easy indolence. There were\r\nperiods when she took delight in perfect vacancy of hand and\r\neye--moments when her thoughts, her simple existence, the fact of the\r\nworld being around and heaven above her, seemed to yield her such\r\nfullness of happiness that she did not need to lift a finger to increase\r\nthe joy. Often, after an active morning, she would spend a sunny\r\nafternoon in lying stirless on the turf, at the foot of some tree of\r\nfriendly umbrage. No society did she need but that of Caroline, and it\r\nsufficed if she were within call; no spectacle did she ask but that of\r\nthe deep blue sky, and such cloudlets as sailed afar and aloft across\r\nits span; no sound but that of the bee\'s hum, the leaf\'s whisper. Her\r\nsole book in such hours was the dim chronicle of memory or the sibyl\r\npage of anticipation. From her young eyes fell on each volume a glorious\r\nlight to read by; round her lips at moments played a smile which\r\nrevealed glimpses of the tale or prophecy. It was not sad, not dark.\r\nFate had been benign to the blissful dreamer, and promised to favour her\r\nyet again. In her past were sweet passages, in her future rosy hopes.\r\n\r\nYet one day when Caroline drew near to rouse her, thinking she had lain\r\nlong enough, behold, as she looked down, Shirley\'s cheek was wet as if\r\nwith dew; those fine eyes of hers shone humid and brimming.\r\n\r\n"Shirley, why do _you_ cry?" asked Caroline, involuntarily laying stress\r\non _you_.\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar smiled, and turned her picturesque head towards the\r\nquestioner. "Because it pleases me mightily to cry," she said. "My heart\r\nis both sad and glad. But why, you good, patient child--why do you not\r\nbear me company? I only weep tears, delightful and soon wiped away; you\r\nmight weep gall, if you choose."\r\n\r\n"Why should I weep gall?"\r\n\r\n"Mateless, solitary bird!" was the only answer.\r\n\r\n"And are not you too mateless, Shirley?"\r\n\r\n"At heart--no."\r\n\r\n"Oh! who nestles there, Shirley?"\r\n\r\nBut Shirley only laughed gaily at this question, and alertly started up.\r\n\r\n"I have dreamed," she said, "a mere day-dream--certainly bright,\r\nprobably baseless!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Helstone was by this time free enough from illusions: she took a\r\nsufficiently grave view of the future, and fancied she knew pretty well\r\nhow her own destiny and that of some others were tending. Yet old\r\nassociations retained their influence over her, and it was these and the\r\npower of habit which still frequently drew her of an evening to the\r\nfield-style and the old thorn overlooking the Hollow.\r\n\r\nOne night, the night after the incident of the note, she had been at her\r\nusual post, watching for her beacon--watching vainly: that evening no\r\nlamp was lit. She waited till the rising of certain constellations\r\nwarned her of lateness and signed her away. In passing Fieldhead, on her\r\nreturn, its moonlight beauty attracted her glance, and stayed her step\r\nan instant. Tree and hall rose peaceful under the night sky and clear\r\nfull orb; pearly paleness gilded the building; mellow brown gloom\r\nbosomed it round; shadows of deep green brooded above its oak-wreathed\r\nroof. The broad pavement in front shone pale also; it gleamed as if some\r\nspell had transformed the dark granite to glistering Parian. On the\r\nsilvery space slept two sable shadows, thrown sharply defined from two\r\nhuman figures. These figures when first seen were motionless and mute;\r\npresently they moved in harmonious step, and spoke low in harmonious\r\nkey. Earnest was the gaze that scrutinized them as they emerged from\r\nbehind the trunk of the cedar. "Is it Mrs. Pryor and Shirley?"\r\n\r\nCertainly it is Shirley. Who else has a shape so lithe, and proud, and\r\ngraceful? And her face, too, is visible--her countenance careless and\r\npensive, and musing and mirthful, and mocking and tender. Not fearing\r\nthe dew, she has not covered her head; her curls are free--they veil her\r\nneck and caress her shoulder with their tendril rings. An ornament of\r\ngold gleams through the half-closed folds of the scarf she has wrapped\r\nacross her bust, and a large bright gem glitters on the white hand\r\nwhich confines it. Yes, that is Shirley.\r\n\r\nHer companion then is, of course, Mrs. Pryor?\r\n\r\nYes, if Mrs. Pryor owns six feet of stature, and if she has changed her\r\ndecent widow\'s weeds for masculine disguise. The figure walking at Miss\r\nKeeldar\'s side is a man--a tall, young, stately man; it is her tenant,\r\nRobert Moore.\r\n\r\nThe pair speak softly; their words are not distinguishable. To remain a\r\nmoment to gaze is not to be an eavesdropper; and as the moon shines so\r\nclearly and their countenances are so distinctly apparent, who can\r\nresist the attraction of such interest? Caroline, it seems, cannot, for\r\nshe lingers.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when, on summer nights, Moore had been wont to walk\r\nwith his cousin, as he was now walking with the heiress. Often had she\r\ngone up the Hollow with him after sunset, to scent the freshness of the\r\nearth, where a growth of fragrant herbage carpeted a certain narrow\r\nterrace, edging a deep ravine, from whose rifted gloom was heard a sound\r\nlike the spirit of the lonely watercourse, moaning amongst its wet\r\nstones, and between its weedy banks, and under its dark bower of alders.\r\n\r\n"But I used to be closer to him," thought Caroline. "He felt no\r\nobligation to treat me with homage; I needed only kindness. He used to\r\nhold my hand; he does not touch hers. And yet Shirley is not proud where\r\nshe loves. There is no haughtiness in her aspect now, only a little in\r\nher port--what is natural to and inseparable from her, what she retains\r\nin her most careless as in her most guarded moments. Robert must think,\r\nas I think, that he is at this instant looking down on a fine face; and\r\nhe must think it with a man\'s brain, not with mine. She has such\r\ngenerous yet soft fire in her eyes. She smiles--what makes her smile so\r\nsweet? I saw that Robert felt its beauty, and he must have felt it with\r\nhis man\'s heart, not with my dim woman\'s perceptions. They look to me\r\nlike two great happy spirits. Yonder silvered pavement reminds me of\r\nthat white shore we believe to be beyond the death-flood. They have\r\nreached it; they walk there united. And what am I, standing here in\r\nshadow, shrinking into concealment, my mind darker than my hiding-place?\r\nI am one of this world, no spirit--a poor doomed mortal, who asks, in\r\nignorance and hopelessness, wherefore she was born, to what end she\r\nlives; whose mind for ever runs on the question, how she shall at last\r\nencounter, and by whom be sustained through death.\r\n\r\n"This is the worst passage I have come to yet; still I was quite\r\nprepared for it. I gave Robert up, and gave him up to Shirley, the first\r\nday I heard she was come, the first moment I saw her--rich, youthful,\r\nand lovely. She has him now. He is her lover. She is his darling. She\r\nwill be far more his darling yet when they are married. The more Robert\r\nknows of Shirley the more his soul will cleave to her. They will both be\r\nhappy, and I do not grudge them their bliss; but I groan under my own\r\nmisery. Some of my suffering is very acute. Truly I ought not to have\r\nbeen born; they should have smothered me at the first cry."\r\n\r\nHere, Shirley stepping aside to gather a dewy flower, she and her\r\ncompanion turned into a path that lay nearer the gate. Some of their\r\nconversation became audible. Caroline would not stay to listen. She\r\npassed away noiselessly, and the moonlight kissed the wall which her\r\nshadow had dimmed. The reader is privileged to remain, and try what he\r\ncan make of the discourse.\r\n\r\n"I cannot conceive why nature did not give you a bulldog\'s head, for you\r\nhave all a bulldog\'s tenacity," said Shirley.\r\n\r\n"Not a flattering idea. Am I so ignoble?"\r\n\r\n"And something also you have of the same animal\'s silent ways of going\r\nabout its work. You give no warning; you come noiselessly behind, seize\r\nfast, and hold on."\r\n\r\n"This is guess-work. You have witnessed no such feat on my part. In your\r\npresence I have been no bulldog."\r\n\r\n"Your very silence indicates your race. How little you talk in general,\r\nyet how deeply you scheme! You are far-seeing; you are calculating."\r\n\r\n"I know the ways of these people. I have gathered information of their\r\nintentions. My note last night informed you that Barraclough\'s trial had\r\nended in his conviction and sentence to transportation. His associates\r\nwill plot vengeance. I shall lay my plans so as to counteract or at\r\nleast be prepared for theirs--that is all. Having now given you as clear\r\nan explanation as I can, am I to understand that for what I propose\r\ndoing I have your approbation?"\r\n\r\n"I shall stand by you so long as you remain on the defensive. Yes."\r\n\r\n"Good! Without any aid--even opposed or disapproved by you--I believe I\r\nshould have acted precisely as I now intend to act, but in another\r\nspirit. I now feel satisfied. On the whole, I relish the position."\r\n\r\n"I dare say you do. That is evident. You relish the work which lies\r\nbefore you still better than you would relish the execution of a\r\ngovernment order for army-cloth."\r\n\r\n"I certainly feel it congenial."\r\n\r\n"So would old Helstone. It is true there is a shade of difference in\r\nyour motives--many shades, perhaps. Shall I speak to Mr. Helstone? I\r\nwill, if you like."\r\n\r\n"Act as you please. Your judgment, Miss Keeldar, will guide you\r\naccurately. I could rely on it myself in a more difficult crisis. But I\r\nshould inform you Mr. Helstone is somewhat prejudiced against me at\r\npresent."\r\n\r\n"I am aware--I have heard all about your differences. Depend upon it,\r\nthey will melt away. He cannot resist the temptation of an alliance\r\nunder present circumstances."\r\n\r\n"I should be glad to have him; he is of true metal."\r\n\r\n"I think so also."\r\n\r\n"An old blade, and rusty somewhat, but the edge and temper still\r\nexcellent."\r\n\r\n"Well, you shall have him, Mr. Moore--that is, if I can win him."\r\n\r\n"Whom can you not win?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not the rector; but I will make the effort."\r\n\r\n"Effort! He will yield for a word--a smile."\r\n\r\n"By no means. It will cost me several cups of tea, some toast and cake,\r\nand an ample measure of remonstrances, expostulations, and persuasions.\r\nIt grows rather chill."\r\n\r\n"I perceive you shiver. Am I acting wrongly to detain you here? Yet it\r\nis so calm--I even feel it warm--and society such as yours is a pleasure\r\nto me so rare. If you were wrapped in a thicker shawl----"\r\n\r\n"I might stay longer, and forget how late it is, which would chagrin\r\nMrs. Pryor. We keep early and regular hours at Fieldhead, Mr. Moore; and\r\nso, I am sure, does your sister at the cottage."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but Hortense and I have an understanding the most convenient in\r\nthe world, that we shall each do as we please."\r\n\r\n"How do you please to do?"\r\n\r\n"Three nights in the week I sleep in the mill--but I require little\r\nrest--and when it is moonlight and mild I often haunt the Hollow till\r\ndaybreak."\r\n\r\n"When I was a very little girl, Mr. Moore, my nurse used to tell me\r\ntales of fairies being seen in that Hollow. That was before my father\r\nbuilt the mill, when it was a perfectly solitary ravine. You will be\r\nfalling under enchantment."\r\n\r\n"I fear it is done," said Moore, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"But there are worse things than fairies to be guarded against," pursued\r\nMiss Keeldar.\r\n\r\n"Things more perilous," he subjoined.\r\n\r\n"Far more so. For instance, how would you like to meet Michael Hartley,\r\nthat mad Calvinist and Jacobin weaver? They say he is addicted to\r\npoaching, and often goes abroad at night with his gun."\r\n\r\n"I have already had the luck to meet him. We held a long argument\r\ntogether one night. A strange little incident it was; I liked it."\r\n\r\n"Liked it? I admire your taste! Michael is not sane. Where did you meet\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"In the deepest, shadiest spot in the glen, where the water runs low,\r\nunder brushwood. We sat down near that plank bridge. It was moonlight,\r\nbut clouded, and very windy. We had a talk."\r\n\r\n"On politics?"\r\n\r\n"And religion. I think the moon was at the full, and Michael was as near\r\ncrazed as possible. He uttered strange blasphemy in his Antinomian\r\nfashion."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, but I think you must have been nearly as mad as he, to sit\r\nlistening to him."\r\n\r\n"There is a wild interest in his ravings. The man would be half a poet,\r\nif he were not wholly a maniac; and perhaps a prophet, if he were not a\r\nprofligate. He solemnly informed me that hell was foreordained my\r\ninevitable portion; that he read the mark of the beast on my brow; that\r\nI had been an outcast from the beginning. God\'s vengeance, he said, was\r\npreparing for me, and affirmed that in a vision of the night he had\r\nbeheld the manner and the instrument of my doom. I wanted to know\r\nfurther, but he left me with these words, \'The end is not yet.\'"\r\n\r\n"Have you ever seen him since?"\r\n\r\n"About a month afterwards, in returning from market, I encountered him\r\nand Moses Barraclough, both in an advanced stage of inebriation. They\r\nwere praying in frantic sort at the roadside. They accosted me as Satan,\r\nbid me avaunt, and clamoured to be delivered from temptation. Again, but\r\na few days ago, Michael took the trouble of appearing at the\r\ncounting-house door, hatless, in his shirt-sleeves--his coat and castor\r\nhaving been detained at the public-house in pledge. He delivered himself\r\nof the comfortable message that he could wish Mr. Moore to set his house\r\nin order, as his soul was likely shortly to be required of him."\r\n\r\n"Do you make light of these things?"\r\n\r\n"The poor man had been drinking for weeks, and was in a state bordering\r\non delirium tremens."\r\n\r\n"What then? He is the more likely to attempt the fulfilment of his own\r\nprophecies."\r\n\r\n"It would not do to permit incidents of this sort to affect one\'s\r\nnerves."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Moore, go home!"\r\n\r\n"So soon?"\r\n\r\n"Pass straight down the fields, not round by the lade and plantations."\r\n\r\n"It is early yet."\r\n\r\n"It is late. For my part, I am going in. Will you promise me not to\r\nwander in the Hollow to-night?"\r\n\r\n"If you wish it."\r\n\r\n"I do wish it. May I ask whether you consider life valueless?"\r\n\r\n"By no means. On the contrary, of late I regard my life as invaluable."\r\n\r\n"Of late?"\r\n\r\n"Existence is neither aimless nor hopeless to me now, and it was both\r\nthree months ago. I was then drowning, and rather wished the operation\r\nover. All at once a hand was stretched to me--such a delicate hand I\r\nscarcely dared trust it; its strength, however, has rescued me from\r\nruin."\r\n\r\n"Are you really rescued?"\r\n\r\n"For the time. Your assistance has given me another chance."\r\n\r\n"Live to make the best of it. Don\'t offer yourself as a target to\r\nMichael Hartley; and good-night!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Helstone was under a promise to spend the evening of the next day\r\nat Fieldhead. She kept her promise. Some gloomy hours had she spent in\r\nthe interval. Most of the time had been passed shut up in her own\r\napartment, only issuing from it, indeed, to join her uncle at meals, and\r\nanticipating inquiries from Fanny by telling her that she was busy\r\naltering a dress, and preferred sewing upstairs, to avoid interruption.\r\n\r\nShe did sew. She plied her needle continuously, ceaselessly, but her\r\nbrain worked faster than her fingers. Again, and more intensely than\r\never, she desired a fixed occupation, no matter how onerous, how\r\nirksome. Her uncle must be once more entreated, but first she would\r\nconsult Mrs. Pryor. Her head laboured to frame projects as diligently as\r\nher hands to plait and stitch the thin texture of the muslin summer\r\ndress spread on the little white couch at the foot of which she sat. Now\r\nand then, while thus doubly occupied, a tear would fill her eyes and\r\nfall on her busy hands; but this sign of emotion was rare and quickly\r\neffaced. The sharp pang passed; the dimness cleared from her vision. She\r\nwould re-thread her needle, rearrange tuck and trimming, and work on.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon she dressed herself. She reached Fieldhead, and\r\nappeared in the oak parlour just as tea was brought in. Shirley asked\r\nher why she came so late.\r\n\r\n"Because I have been making my dress," said she. "These fine sunny days\r\nbegan to make me ashamed of my winter merino, so I have furbished up a\r\nlighter garment."\r\n\r\n"In which you look as I like to see you," said Shirley. "You are a\r\nlady-like little person, Caroline.--Is she not, Mrs. Pryor?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor never paid compliments, and seldom indulged in remarks,\r\nfavourable or otherwise, on personal appearance. On the present occasion\r\nshe only swept Caroline\'s curls from her cheek as she took a seat near\r\nher, caressed the oval outline, and observed, "You get somewhat thin, my\r\nlove, and somewhat pale. Do you sleep well? your eyes have a languid\r\nlook." And she gazed at her anxiously.\r\n\r\n"I sometimes dream melancholy dreams," answered Caroline; "and if I lie\r\nawake for an hour or two in the night, I am continually thinking of the\r\nrectory as a dreary old place. You know it is very near the churchyard.\r\nThe back part of the house is extremely ancient, and it is said that the\r\nout-kitchens there were once enclosed in the churchyard, and that there\r\nare graves under them. I rather long to leave the rectory."\r\n\r\n"My dear, you are surely not superstitious?"\r\n\r\n"No, Mrs. Pryor; but I think I grow what is called nervous. I see things\r\nunder a darker aspect than I used to do. I have fears I never used to\r\nhave--not of ghosts, but of omens and disastrous events; and I have an\r\ninexpressible weight on my mind which I would give the world to shake\r\noff, and I cannot do it."\r\n\r\n"Strange!" cried Shirley. "I never feel so." Mrs. Pryor said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Fine weather, pleasant days, pleasant scenes, are powerless to give me\r\npleasure," continued Caroline. "Calm evenings are not calm to me.\r\nMoonlight, which I used to think mild, now only looks mournful. Is this\r\nweakness of mind, Mrs. Pryor, or what is it? I cannot help it. I often\r\nstruggle against it. I reason; but reason and effort make no\r\ndifference."\r\n\r\n"You should take more exercise," said Mrs. Pryor.\r\n\r\n"Exercise! I exercise sufficiently. I exercise till I am ready to drop."\r\n\r\n"My dear, you should go from home."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Pryor, I should like to go from home, but not on any purposeless\r\nexcursion or visit. I wish to be a governess, as you have been. It would\r\noblige me greatly if you would speak to my uncle on the subject."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" broke in Shirley. "What an idea! Be a governess! Better be a\r\nslave at once. Where is the necessity of it? Why should you dream of\r\nsuch a painful step?"\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Mrs. Pryor, "you are very young to be a governess, and\r\nnot sufficiently robust. The duties a governess undertakes are often\r\nsevere."\r\n\r\n"And I believe I want severe duties to occupy me."\r\n\r\n"Occupy you!" cried Shirley. "When are you idle? I never saw a more\r\nindustrious girl than you. You are always at work. Come," she\r\ncontinued--"come and sit by my side, and take some tea to refresh you.\r\nYou don\'t care much for my friendship, then, that you wish to leave me?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I do, Shirley; and I don\'t wish to leave you. I shall never find\r\nanother friend so dear."\r\n\r\nAt which words Miss Keeldar put her hand into Caroline\'s with an\r\nimpulsively affectionate movement, which was well seconded by the\r\nexpression of her face.\r\n\r\n"If you think so, you had better make much of me," she said, "and not\r\nrun away from me. I hate to part with those to whom I am become\r\nattached. Mrs. Pryor there sometimes talks of leaving me, and says I\r\nmight make a more advantageous connection than herself. I should as soon\r\nthink of exchanging an old-fashioned mother for something modish and\r\nstylish. As for you--why, I began to flatter myself we were thoroughly\r\nfriends; that you liked Shirley almost as well as Shirley likes you, and\r\nshe does not stint her regard."\r\n\r\n"I _do_ like Shirley. I like her more and more every day. But that does\r\nnot make me strong or happy."\r\n\r\n"And would it make you strong or happy to go and live as a dependent\r\namongst utter strangers? It would not. And the experiment must not be\r\ntried; I tell you it would fail. It is not in your nature to bear the\r\ndesolate life governesses generally lead; you would fall ill. I won\'t\r\nhear of it."\r\n\r\nAnd Miss Keeldar paused, having uttered this prohibition very decidedly.\r\nSoon she recommenced, still looking somewhat _courrouc\xc3\xa9e_, "Why, it is\r\nmy daily pleasure now to look out for the little cottage bonnet and the\r\nsilk scarf glancing through the trees in the lane, and to know that my\r\nquiet, shrewd, thoughtful companion and monitress is coming back to me;\r\nthat I shall have her sitting in the room to look at, to talk to or to\r\nlet alone, as she and I please. This may be a selfish sort of\r\nlanguage--I know it is--but it is the language which naturally rises to\r\nmy lips, therefore I utter it."\r\n\r\n"I would write to you, Shirley."\r\n\r\n"And what are letters? Only a sort of _pis aller_. Drink some tea,\r\nCaroline. Eat something--you eat nothing. Laugh and be cheerful, and\r\nstay at home."\r\n\r\nMiss Helstone shook her head and sighed. She felt what difficulty she\r\nwould have to persuade any one to assist or sanction her in making that\r\nchange in her life which she believed desirable. Might she only follow\r\nher own judgment, she thought she should be able to find perhaps a harsh\r\nbut an effectual cure for her sufferings. But this judgment, founded on\r\ncircumstances she could fully explain to none, least of all to Shirley,\r\nseemed, in all eyes but her own, incomprehensible and fantastic, and\r\nwas opposed accordingly.\r\n\r\nThere really was no present pecuniary need for her to leave a\r\ncomfortable home and "take a situation;" and there was every probability\r\nthat her uncle might, in some way, permanently provide for her. So her\r\nfriends thought, and, as far as their lights enabled them to see, they\r\nreasoned correctly; but of Caroline\'s strange sufferings, which she\r\ndesired so eagerly to overcome or escape, they had no idea, of her\r\nracked nights and dismal days no suspicion. It was at once impossible\r\nand hopeless to explain; to wait and endure was her only plan. Many that\r\nwant food and clothing have cheerier lives and brighter prospects than\r\nshe had; many, harassed by poverty, are in a strait less afflictive.\r\n\r\n"Now, is your mind quieted?" inquired Shirley. "Will you consent to stay\r\nat home?"\r\n\r\n"I shall not leave it against the approbation of my friends," was the\r\nreply; "but I think in time they will be obliged to think as I do."\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation Mrs. Pryor looked far from easy. Her extreme\r\nhabitual reserve would rarely permit her to talk freely or to\r\ninterrogate others closely. She could think a multitude of questions she\r\nnever ventured to put, give advice in her mind which her tongue never\r\ndelivered. Had she been alone with Caroline, she might possibly have\r\nsaid something to the point: Miss Keeldar\'s presence, accustomed as she\r\nwas to it, sealed her lips. Now, as on a thousand other occasions,\r\ninexplicable nervous scruples kept her back from interfering. She merely\r\nshowed her concern for Miss Helstone in an indirect way, by asking her\r\nif the fire made her too warm, placing a screen between her chair and\r\nthe hearth, closing a window whence she imagined a draught proceeded,\r\nand often and restlessly glancing at her. Shirley resumed: "Having\r\ndestroyed your plan," she said, "which I hope I have done, I shall\r\nconstruct a new one of my own. Every summer I make an excursion. This\r\nseason I propose spending two months either at the Scotch lochs or the\r\nEnglish lakes--that is, I shall go there provided you consent to\r\naccompany me. If you refuse, I shall not stir a foot."\r\n\r\n"You are very good, Shirley."\r\n\r\n"I would be very good if you would let me. I have every disposition to\r\nbe good. It is my misfortune and habit, I know, to think of myself\r\nparamount to anybody else; but who is not like me in that respect?\r\nHowever, when Captain Keeldar is made comfortable, accommodated with all\r\nhe wants, including a sensible, genial comrade, it gives him a thorough\r\npleasure to devote his spare efforts to making that comrade happy. And\r\nshould we not be happy, Caroline, in the Highlands? We will go to the\r\nHighlands. We will, if you can bear a sea-voyage, go to the Isles--the\r\nHebrides, the Shetland, the Orkney Islands. Would you not like that? I\r\nsee you would.--Mrs. Pryor, I call you to witness. Her face is all\r\nsunshine at the bare mention of it."\r\n\r\n"I should like it much," returned Caroline, to whom, indeed, the notion\r\nof such a tour was not only pleasant, but gloriously reviving. Shirley\r\nrubbed her hands.\r\n\r\n"Come; I can bestow a benefit," she exclaimed. "I can do a good deed\r\nwith my cash. My thousand a year is not merely a matter of dirty\r\nbank-notes and jaundiced guineas (let me speak respectfully of both,\r\nthough, for I adore them), but, it may be, health to the drooping,\r\nstrength to the weak, consolation to the sad. I was determined to make\r\nsomething of it better than a fine old house to live in, than satin\r\ngowns to wear, better than deference from acquaintance and homage from\r\nthe poor. Here is to begin. This summer, Caroline, Mrs. Pryor and I go\r\nout into the North Atlantic, beyond the Shetland, perhaps to the Faroe\r\nIsles. We will see seals in Suderoe, and, doubtless, mermaids in\r\nStromoe.--Caroline is laughing, Mrs. Pryor. _I_ made her laugh; _I_ have\r\ndone her good."\r\n\r\n"I shall like to go, Shirley," again said Miss Helstone. "I long to hear\r\nthe sound of waves--ocean-waves--and to see them as I have imagined them\r\nin dreams, like tossing banks of green light, strewed with vanishing and\r\nreappearing wreaths of foam, whiter than lilies. I shall delight to pass\r\nthe shores of those lone rock-islets where the sea-birds live and breed\r\nunmolested. We shall be on the track of the old Scandinavians--of the\r\nNorsemen. We shall almost see the shores of Norway. This is a very vague\r\ndelight that I feel, communicated by your proposal, but it _is_ a\r\ndelight."\r\n\r\n"Will you think of Fitful Head now when you lie awake at night, of gulls\r\nshrieking round it, and waves tumbling in upon it, rather than of the\r\ngraves under the rectory back-kitchen?"\r\n\r\n"I will try; and instead of musing about remnants of shrouds, and\r\nfragments of coffins, and human bones and mould, I will fancy seals\r\nlying in the sunshine on solitary shores, where neither fisherman nor\r\nhunter ever come; of rock crevices full of pearly eggs bedded in\r\nseaweed; of unscared birds covering white sands in happy flocks."\r\n\r\n"And what will become of that inexpressible weight you said you had on\r\nyour mind?"\r\n\r\n"I will try to forget it in speculation on the sway of the whole great\r\ndeep above a herd of whales rushing through the livid and liquid thunder\r\ndown from the frozen zone--a hundred of them, perhaps, wallowing,\r\nflashing, rolling in the wake of a patriarch bull, huge enough to have\r\nbeen spawned before the Flood, such a creature as poor Smart had in his\r\nmind when he said,--\r\n\r\n    \'Strong against tides, the enormous whale\r\n       Emerges as he goes.\'"\r\n\r\n"I hope our bark will meet with no such shoal, or herd as you term it,\r\nCaroline. (I suppose you fancy the sea-mammoths pasturing about the\r\nbases of the \'everlasting hills,\' devouring strange provender in the\r\nvast valleys through and above which sea-billows roll.) I should not\r\nlike to be capsized by the patriarch bull."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you expect to see mermaids, Shirley?"\r\n\r\n"One of them, at any rate--I do not bargain for less--and she is to\r\nappear in some such fashion as this. I am to be walking by myself on\r\ndeck, rather late of an August evening, watching and being watched by a\r\nfull harvest moon. Something is to rise white on the surface of the sea,\r\nover which that moon mounts silent and hangs glorious. The object\r\nglitters and sinks. It rises again. I think I hear it cry with an\r\narticulate voice; I call you up from the cabin; I show you an image,\r\nfair as alabaster, emerging from the dim wave. We both see the long\r\nhair, the lifted and foam-white arm, the oval mirror brilliant as a\r\nstar. It glides nearer; a human face is plainly visible--a face in the\r\nstyle of yours--whose straight, pure (excuse the word, it is\r\nappropriate)--whose straight, pure lineaments paleness does not\r\ndisfigure. It looks at us, but not with your eyes. I see a preternatural\r\nlure in its wily glance. It beckons. Were we men, we should spring at\r\nthe sign--the cold billow would be dared for the sake of the colder\r\nenchantress; being women, we stand safe, though not dreadless. She\r\ncomprehends our unmoved gaze; she feels herself powerless; anger crosses\r\nher front; she cannot charm, but she will appal us; she rises high, and\r\nglides all revealed on the dark wave-ridge. Temptress-terror! monstrous\r\nlikeness of ourselves! Are you not glad, Caroline, when at last, and\r\nwith a wild shriek, she dives?"\r\n\r\n"But, Shirley, she is not like us. We are neither temptresses, nor\r\nterrors, nor monsters."\r\n\r\n"Some of our kind, it is said, are all three. There are men who ascribe\r\nto \'woman,\' in general, such attributes."\r\n\r\n"My dears," here interrupted Mrs. Pryor, "does it not strike you that\r\nyour conversation for the last ten minutes has been rather fanciful?"\r\n\r\n"But there is no harm in our fancies; is there, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"We are aware that mermaids do not exist; why speak of them as if they\r\ndid? How can you find interest in speaking of a nonentity?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Shirley.\r\n\r\n"My dear, I think there is an arrival. I heard a step in the lane while\r\nyou were talking; and is not that the garden-gate which creaks?"\r\n\r\nShirley stepped to the window.\r\n\r\n"Yes, there is some one," said she, turning quietly away; and as she\r\nresumed her seat a sensitive flush animated her face, while a trembling\r\nray at once kindled and softened her eye. She raised her hand to her\r\nchin, cast her gaze down, and seemed to think as she waited.\r\n\r\nThe servant announced Mr. Moore, and Shirley turned round when Mr. Moore\r\nappeared at the door. His figure seemed very tall as he entered, and\r\nstood in contrast with the three ladies, none of whom could boast a\r\nstature much beyond the average. He was looking well, better than he had\r\nbeen known to look for the past twelve months. A sort of renewed youth\r\nglowed in his eye and colour, and an invigorated hope and settled\r\npurpose sustained his bearing. Firmness his countenance still indicated,\r\nbut not austerity. It looked as cheerful as it was earnest.\r\n\r\n"I am just returned from Stilbro\'," he said to Miss Keeldar, as he\r\ngreeted her; "and I thought I would call to impart to you the result of\r\nmy mission."\r\n\r\n"You did right not to keep me in suspense," she said, "and your visit is\r\nwell timed. Sit down. We have not finished tea. Are you English enough\r\nto relish tea, or do you faithfully adhere to coffee?"\r\n\r\nMoore accepted tea.\r\n\r\n"I am learning to be a naturalized Englishman," said he; "my foreign\r\nhabits are leaving me one by one."\r\n\r\nAnd now he paid his respects to Mrs. Pryor, and paid them well, with a\r\ngrave modesty that became his age compared with hers. Then he looked at\r\nCaroline--not, however, for the first time: his glance had fallen upon\r\nher before. He bent towards her as she sat, gave her his hand, and asked\r\nher how she was. The light from the window did not fall upon Miss\r\nHelstone; her back was turned towards it. A quiet though rather low\r\nreply, a still demeanour, and the friendly protection of early twilight\r\nkept out of view each traitorous symptom. None could affirm that she had\r\ntrembled or blushed, that her heart had quaked or her nerves thrilled;\r\nnone could prove emotion; a greeting showing less effusion was never\r\ninterchanged. Moore took the empty chair near her, opposite Miss\r\nKeeldar. He had placed himself well. His neighbour, screened by the very\r\ncloseness of his vicinage from his scrutiny, and sheltered further by\r\nthe dusk which deepened each moment, soon regained not merely _seeming_\r\nbut _real_ mastery of the feelings which had started into insurrection\r\nat the first announcement of his name.\r\n\r\nHe addressed his conversation to Miss Keeldar.\r\n\r\n"I went to the barracks," he said, "and had an interview with Colonel\r\nRyde. He approved my plans, and promised the aid I wanted. Indeed, he\r\noffered a more numerous force than I require--half a dozen will suffice.\r\nI don\'t intend to be swamped by redcoats. They are needed for appearance\r\nrather than anything else. My main reliance is on my own civilians."\r\n\r\n"And on their captain," interposed Shirley.\r\n\r\n"What, Captain Keeldar?" inquired Moore, slightly smiling, and not\r\nlifting his eyes. The tone of raillery in which he said this was very\r\nrespectful and suppressed.\r\n\r\n"No," returned Shirley, answering the smile; "Captain G\xc3\xa9rard Moore, who\r\ntrusts much to the prowess of his own right arm, I believe."\r\n\r\n"Furnished with his counting-house ruler," added Moore. Resuming his\r\nusual gravity, he went on: "I received by this evening\'s post a note\r\nfrom the Home Secretary in answer to mine. It appears they are uneasy at\r\nthe state of matters here in the north; they especially condemn the\r\nsupineness and pusillanimity of the mill-owners. They say, as I have\r\nalways said, that inaction, under present circumstances, is criminal,\r\nand that cowardice is cruelty, since both can only encourage disorder,\r\nand lead finally to sanguinary outbreaks. There is the note--I brought\r\nit for your perusal; and there is a batch of newspapers, containing\r\nfurther accounts of proceedings in Nottingham, Manchester, and\r\nelsewhere."\r\n\r\nHe produced letters and journals, and laid them before Miss Keeldar.\r\nWhile she perused them he took his tea quietly; but though his tongue\r\nwas still, his observant faculties seemed by no means off duty. Mrs.\r\nPryor, sitting in the background, did not come within the range of his\r\nglance, but the two younger ladies had the full benefit thereof.\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar, placed directly opposite, was seen without effort. She was\r\nthe object his eyes, when lifted, naturally met first; and as what\r\nremained of daylight--the gilding of the west--was upon her, her shape\r\nrose in relief from the dark panelling behind. Shirley\'s clear cheek was\r\ntinted yet with the colour which had risen into it a few minutes since.\r\nThe dark lashes of her eyes looking down as she read, the dusk yet\r\ndelicate line of her eyebrows, the almost sable gloss of her curls, made\r\nher heightened complexion look fine as the bloom of a red wild flower by\r\ncontrast. There was natural grace in her attitude, and there was\r\nartistic effect in the ample and shining folds of her silk dress--an\r\nattire simply fashioned, but almost splendid from the shifting\r\nbrightness of its dye, warp and woof being of tints deep and changing as\r\nthe hue on a pheasant\'s neck. A glancing bracelet on her arm produced\r\nthe contrast of gold and ivory. There was something brilliant in the\r\nwhole picture. It is to be supposed that Moore thought so, as his eye\r\ndwelt long on it, but he seldom permitted his feelings or his opinions\r\nto exhibit themselves in his face. His temperament boasted a certain\r\namount of phlegm, and he preferred an undemonstrative, not ungentle, but\r\nserious aspect to any other.\r\n\r\nHe could not, by looking straight before him, see Caroline, as she was\r\nclose at his side. It was necessary, therefore, to man\xc5\x93uvre a little to\r\nget her well within the range of his observation. He leaned back in his\r\nchair, and looked down on her. In Miss Helstone neither he nor any one\r\nelse could discover brilliancy. Sitting in the shade, without flowers\r\nor ornaments, her attire the modest muslin dress, colourless but for its\r\nnarrow stripe of pale azure, her complexion unflushed, unexcited, the\r\nvery brownness of her hair and eyes invisible by this faint light, she\r\nwas, compared with the heiress, as a graceful pencil sketch compared\r\nwith a vivid painting. Since Robert had seen her last a great change had\r\nbeen wrought in her. Whether he perceived it might not be ascertained.\r\nHe said nothing to that effect.\r\n\r\n"How is Hortense?" asked Caroline softly.\r\n\r\n"Very well; but she complains of being unemployed. She misses you."\r\n\r\n"Tell her that I miss her, and that I write and read a portion of French\r\nevery day."\r\n\r\n"She will ask if you sent your love; she is always particular on that\r\npoint. You know she likes attention."\r\n\r\n"My best love--my very best. And say to her that whenever she has time\r\nto write me a little note I shall be glad to hear from her."\r\n\r\n"What if I forget? I am not the surest messenger of compliments."\r\n\r\n"No, don\'t forget, Robert. It is no compliment; it is in good earnest."\r\n\r\n"And must, therefore, be delivered punctually."\r\n\r\n"If you please."\r\n\r\n"Hortense will be ready to shed tears. She is tenderhearted on the\r\nsubject of her pupil; yet she reproaches you sometimes for obeying your\r\nuncle\'s injunctions too literally. Affection, like love, will be unjust\r\nnow and then."\r\n\r\nAnd Caroline made no answer to this observation; for indeed her heart\r\nwas troubled, and to her eyes she would have raised her handkerchief if\r\nshe had dared. If she had dared, too, she would have declared how the\r\nvery flowers in the garden of Hollow\'s Cottage were dear to her; how the\r\nlittle parlour of that house was her earthly paradise; how she longed to\r\nreturn to it, as much almost as the first woman, in her exile, must have\r\nlonged to revisit Eden. Not daring, however, to say these things, she\r\nheld her peace; she sat quiet at Robert\'s side, waiting for him to say\r\nsomething more. It was long since this proximity had been hers--long\r\nsince his voice had addressed her; could she, with any show of\r\nprobability, even of possibility, have imagined that the meeting gave\r\nhim pleasure, to her it would have given deep bliss. Yet, even in doubt\r\nthat it pleased, in dread that it might annoy him, she received the\r\nboon of the meeting as an imprisoned bird would the admission of\r\nsunshine to its cage. It was of no use arguing, contending against the\r\nsense of present happiness; to be near Robert was to be revived.\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar laid down the papers.\r\n\r\n"And are you glad or sad for all these menacing tidings?" she inquired\r\nof her tenant.\r\n\r\n"Not precisely either; but I certainly am instructed. I see that our\r\nonly plan is to be firm. I see that efficient preparation and a resolute\r\nattitude are the best means of averting bloodshed."\r\n\r\nHe then inquired if she had observed some particular paragraph, to which\r\nshe replied in the negative, and he rose to show it to her. He continued\r\nthe conversation standing before her. From the tenor of what he said, it\r\nappeared evident that they both apprehended disturbances in the\r\nneighbourhood of Briarfield, though in what form they expected them to\r\nbreak out was not specified. Neither Caroline nor Mrs. Pryor asked\r\nquestions. The subject did not appear to be regarded as one ripe for\r\nfree discussion; therefore the lady and her tenant were suffered to keep\r\ndetails to themselves, unimportuned by the curiosity of their listeners.\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar, in speaking to Mr. Moore, took a tone at once animated and\r\ndignified, confidential and self-respecting. When, however, the candles\r\nwere brought in, and the fire was stirred up, and the fullness of light\r\nthus produced rendered the expression of her countenance legible, you\r\ncould see that she was all interest, life, and earnestness. There was\r\nnothing coquettish in her demeanour; whatever she felt for Moore she\r\nfelt it seriously. And serious, too, were his feelings, and settled were\r\nhis views, apparently, for he made no petty effort to attract, dazzle,\r\nor impress. He contrived, notwithstanding, to command a little; because\r\nthe deeper voice, however mildly modulated, the somewhat harder mind,\r\nnow and then, though involuntarily and unintentionally, bore down by\r\nsome peremptory phrase or tone the mellow accents and susceptible, if\r\nhigh, nature of Shirley. Miss Keeldar looked happy in conversing with\r\nhim, and her joy seemed twofold--a joy of the past and present, of\r\nmemory and of hope.\r\n\r\nWhat I have just said are Caroline\'s ideas of the pair. She felt what\r\nhas just been described. In thus feeling she tried not to suffer, but\r\nsuffered sharply nevertheless. She suffered, indeed, miserably. A few\r\nminutes before her famished heart had tasted a drop and crumb of\r\nnourishment, that, if freely given, would have brought back abundance of\r\nlife where life was failing; but the generous feast was snatched from\r\nher, spread before another, and she remained but a bystander at the\r\nbanquet.\r\n\r\nThe clock struck nine; it was Caroline\'s time for going home. She\r\ngathered up her work, put the embroidery, the scissors, the thimble into\r\nher bag. She bade Mrs. Pryor a quiet good-night, receiving from that\r\nlady a warmer pressure of the hand than usual. She stepped up to Miss\r\nKeeldar.\r\n\r\n"Good-night, Shirley!"\r\n\r\nShirley started up. "What! so soon? Are you going already?"\r\n\r\n"It is past nine."\r\n\r\n"I never heard the clock. You will come again to-morrow, and you will be\r\nhappy to-night, will you not? Remember our plans."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Caroline; "I have not forgotten."\r\n\r\nHer mind misgave her that neither those plans nor any other could\r\npermanently restore her mental tranquillity. She turned to Robert, who\r\nstood close behind her. As he looked up, the light of the candles on the\r\nmantelpiece fell full on her face. All its paleness, all its change, all\r\nits forlorn meaning were clearly revealed. Robert had good eyes, and\r\nmight have seen it if he would; whether he did see it, nothing\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\n"Good-night!" she said, shaking like a leaf, offering her thin hand\r\nhastily, anxious to part from him quickly.\r\n\r\n"You are going home?" he asked, not touching her hand.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Is Fanny come for you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I may as well accompany you a step of the way; not up to the rectory,\r\nthough, lest my old friend Helstone should shoot me from the window."\r\n\r\nHe laughed, and took his hat. Caroline spoke of unnecessary trouble; he\r\ntold her to put on her bonnet and shawl. She was quickly ready, and they\r\nwere soon both in the open air. Moore drew her hand under his arm, just\r\nin his old manner--that manner which she ever felt to be so kind.\r\n\r\n"You may run on, Fanny," he said to the housemaid; "we shall overtake\r\nyou." And when the girl had got a little in advance, he enclosed\r\nCaroline\'s hand in his, and said he was glad to find she was a familiar\r\nguest at Fieldhead. He hoped her intimacy with Miss Keeldar would\r\ncontinue; such society would be both pleasant and improving.\r\n\r\nCaroline replied that she liked Shirley.\r\n\r\n"And there is no doubt the liking is mutual," said Moore. "If she\r\nprofesses friendship, be certain she is sincere. She cannot feign; she\r\nscorns hypocrisy. And, Caroline, are we never to see you at Hollow\'s\r\nCottage again?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose not, unless my uncle should change his mind."\r\n\r\n"Are you much alone now?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a good deal. I have little pleasure in any society but Miss\r\nKeeldar\'s."\r\n\r\n"Have you been quite well lately?"\r\n\r\n"Quite."\r\n\r\n"You must take care of yourself. Be sure not to neglect exercise. Do you\r\nknow I fancied you somewhat altered--a little fallen away, and pale. Is\r\nyour uncle kind to you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he is just as he always is."\r\n\r\n"Not too tender, that is to say--not too protective and attentive. And\r\nwhat ails you, then? Tell me, Lina."\r\n\r\n"Nothing, Robert." But her voice faltered.\r\n\r\n"That is to say, nothing that you will tell me. I am not to be taken\r\ninto confidence. Separation is then quite to estrange us, is it?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know. Sometimes I almost fear it is."\r\n\r\n"But it ought not to have that effect. \'Should auld acquaintance be\r\nforgot, and days o\' lang syne?\'"\r\n\r\n"Robert, I don\'t forget."\r\n\r\n"It is two months, I should think, Caroline, since you were at the\r\ncottage."\r\n\r\n"Since I was _within_ it--yes."\r\n\r\n"Have you ever passed that way in your walk?"\r\n\r\n"I have come to the top of the fields sometimes of an evening and looked\r\ndown. Once I saw Hortense in the garden watering her flowers, and I know\r\nat what time you light your lamp in the counting-house. I have waited\r\nfor it to shine out now and then, and I have seen you bend between it\r\nand the window. I knew it was you; I could almost trace the outline of\r\nyour form."\r\n\r\n"I wonder I never encountered you. I occasionally walk to the top of the\r\nHollow\'s fields after sunset."\r\n\r\n"I know you do. I had almost spoken to you one night, you passed so near\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Did I? I passed near you, and did not see you! Was I alone?"\r\n\r\n"I saw you twice, and neither time were you alone."\r\n\r\n"Who was my companion? Probably nothing but Joe Scott, or my own shadow\r\nby moonlight."\r\n\r\n"No; neither Joe Scott nor your shadow, Robert. The first time you were\r\nwith Mr. Yorke; and the second time what you call your shadow was a\r\nshape with a white forehead and dark curls, and a sparkling necklace\r\nround its neck. But I only just got a glimpse of you and that fairy\r\nshadow; I did not wait to hear you converse."\r\n\r\n"It appears you walk invisible. I noticed a ring on your hand this\r\nevening; can it be the ring of Gyges? Henceforth, when sitting in the\r\ncounting-house by myself, perhaps at dead of night, I shall permit\r\nmyself to imagine that Caroline may be leaning over my shoulder reading\r\nwith me from the same book, or sitting at my side engaged in her own\r\nparticular task, and now and then raising her unseen eyes to my face to\r\nread there my thoughts."\r\n\r\n"You need fear no such infliction. I do not come near you; I only stand\r\nafar off, watching what may become of you."\r\n\r\n"When I walk out along the hedgerows in the evening after the mill is\r\nshut, or at night when I take the watchman\'s place, I shall fancy the\r\nflutter of every little bird over its nest, the rustle of every leaf, a\r\nmovement made by you; tree-shadows will take your shape; in the white\r\nsprays of hawthorn I shall imagine glimpses of you. Lina, you will haunt\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"I will never be where you would not wish me to be, nor see nor hear\r\nwhat you would wish unseen and unheard."\r\n\r\n"I shall see you in my very mill in broad daylight. Indeed, I have seen\r\nyou there once. But a week ago I was standing at the top of one of my\r\nlong rooms; girls were working at the other end, and amongst half a\r\ndozen of them, moving to and fro, I seemed to see a figure resembling\r\nyours. It was some effect of doubtful light or shade, or of dazzling\r\nsunbeam. I walked up to this group. What I sought had glided away; I\r\nfound myself between two buxom lasses in pinafores."\r\n\r\n"I shall not follow you into your mill, Robert, unless you call me\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Nor is that the only occasion on which imagination has played me a\r\ntrick. One night, when I came home late from market, I walked into the\r\ncottage parlour thinking to find Hortense; but instead of her I thought\r\nI found you. There was no candle in the room; my sister had taken the\r\nlight upstairs with her. The window-blind was not drawn, and broad\r\nmoonbeams poured through the panes. There you were, Lina, at the\r\ncasement, shrinking a little to one side in an attitude not unusual with\r\nyou. You were dressed in white, as I have seen you dressed at an evening\r\nparty. For half a second your fresh, living face seemed turned towards\r\nme, looking at me; for half a second my idea was to go and take your\r\nhand, to chide you for your long absence, and welcome your present\r\nvisit. Two steps forward broke the spell. The drapery of the dress\r\nchanged outline; the tints of the complexion dissolved, and were\r\nformless. Positively, as I reached the spot, there was nothing left but\r\nthe sweep of a white muslin curtain, and a balsam plant in a flower-pot,\r\ncovered with a flush of bloom. \'Sic transit,\' et cetera."\r\n\r\n"It was not my wraith, then? I almost thought it was."\r\n\r\n"No; only gauze, crockery, and pink blossom--a sample of earthly\r\nillusions."\r\n\r\n"I wonder you have time for such illusions, occupied as your mind must\r\nbe."\r\n\r\n"So do I. But I find in myself, Lina, two natures--one for the world and\r\nbusiness, and one for home and leisure. G\xc3\xa9rard Moore is a hard dog,\r\nbrought up to mill and market; the person you call your cousin Robert is\r\nsometimes a dreamer, who lives elsewhere than in Cloth-hall and\r\ncounting-house."\r\n\r\n"Your two natures agree with you. I think you are looking in good\r\nspirits and health. You have quite lost that harassed air which it often\r\npained one to see in your face a few months ago."\r\n\r\n"Do you observe that? Certainly I am disentangled of some difficulties.\r\nI have got clear of some shoals, and have more sea-room."\r\n\r\n"And, with a fair wind, you may now hope to make a prosperous voyage?"\r\n\r\n"I may _hope_ it--yes--but hope is deceptive. There is no controlling\r\nwind or wave. Gusts and swells perpetually trouble the mariner\'s\r\ncourse; he dare not dismiss from his mind the expectation of tempest."\r\n\r\n"But you are ready for a breeze; you are a good seaman, an able\r\ncommander. You are a skilful pilot, Robert; you will weather the storm."\r\n\r\n"My kinswoman always thinks the best of me, but I will take her words\r\nfor a propitious omen. I will consider that in meeting her to-night I\r\nhave met with one of those birds whose appearance is to the sailor the\r\nharbinger of good luck."\r\n\r\n"A poor harbinger of good luck is she who can do nothing, who has no\r\npower. I feel my incapacity. It is of no use saying I have the will to\r\nserve you when I cannot prove it. Yet I have that will. I wish you\r\nsuccess. I wish you high fortune and true happiness."\r\n\r\n"When did you ever wish me anything else? What is Fanny waiting for? I\r\ntold her to walk on. Oh! we have reached the churchyard. Then we are to\r\npart here, I suppose. We might have sat a few minutes in the church\r\nporch, if the girl had not been with us. It is so fine a night, so\r\nsummer-mild and still, I have no particular wish to return yet to the\r\nHollow."\r\n\r\n"But we cannot sit in the porch now, Robert."\r\n\r\nCaroline said this because Moore was turning her round towards it.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not. But tell Fanny to go in. Say we are coming. A few minutes\r\nwill make no difference."\r\n\r\nThe church clock struck ten.\r\n\r\n"My uncle will be coming out to take his usual sentinel round, and he\r\nalways surveys the church and churchyard."\r\n\r\n"And if he does? If it were not for Fanny, who knows we are here, I\r\nshould find pleasure in dodging and eluding him. We could be under the\r\neast window when he is at the porch; as he came round to the north side\r\nwe could wheel off to the south; we might at a pinch hide behind some of\r\nthe monuments. That tall erection of the Wynnes would screen us\r\ncompletely."\r\n\r\n"Robert, what good spirits you have! Go! go!" added Caroline hastily. "I\r\nhear the front door----"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to go; on the contrary, I want to stay."\r\n\r\n"You know my uncle will be terribly angry. He forbade me to see you\r\nbecause you are a Jacobin."\r\n\r\n"A queer Jacobin!"\r\n\r\n"Go, Robert, he is coming; I hear him cough."\r\n\r\n"Diable! It is strange--what a pertinacious wish I feel to stay!"\r\n\r\n"You remember what he did to Fanny\'s--" began Caroline, and stopped\r\nabruptly short. "Sweetheart" was the word that ought to have followed,\r\nbut she could not utter it. It seemed calculated to suggest ideas she\r\nhad no intention to suggest--ideas delusive and disturbing. Moore was\r\nless scrupulous. "Fanny\'s sweetheart?" he said at once. "He gave him a\r\nshower-bath under the pump, did he not? He\'d do as much for me, I dare\r\nsay, with pleasure. I should like to provoke the old Turk--not, however,\r\nagainst you. But he would make a distinction between a cousin and a\r\nlover, would he not?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, he would not think of you in that way, of course not; his quarrel\r\nwith you is entirely political. Yet I should not like the breach to be\r\nwidened, and he is so testy. Here he is at the garden gate. For your own\r\nsake and mine, Robert, go!"\r\n\r\nThe beseeching words were aided by a beseeching gesture and a more\r\nbeseeching look. Moore covered her clasped hands an instant with his,\r\nanswered her upward by a downward gaze, said "Good-night!" and went.\r\n\r\nCaroline was in a moment at the kitchen door behind Fanny. The shadow of\r\nthe shovel-hat at that very instant fell on a moonlit tomb. The rector\r\nemerged, erect as a cane, from his garden, and proceeded in slow march,\r\nhis hands behind him, down the cemetery. Moore was almost caught. He had\r\nto "dodge" after all, to coast round the church, and finally to bend his\r\ntall form behind the Wynnes\' ambitious monument. There he was forced to\r\nhide full ten minutes, kneeling with one knee on the turf, his hat off,\r\nhis curls bare to the dew, his dark eye shining, and his lips parted\r\nwith inward laughter at his position; for the rector meantime stood\r\ncoolly star-gazing, and taking snuff within three feet of him.\r\n\r\nIt happened, however, that Mr. Helstone had no suspicion whatever on his\r\nmind; for being usually but vaguely informed of his niece\'s movements,\r\nnot thinking it worth while to follow them closely, he was not aware\r\nthat she had been out at all that day, and imagined her then occupied\r\nwith book or work in her chamber--where, indeed, she was by this time,\r\nthough not absorbed in the tranquil employment he ascribed to her, but\r\nstanding at her window with fast-throbbing heart, peeping anxiously from\r\nbehind the blind, watching for her uncle to re-enter and her cousin to\r\nescape. And at last she was gratified. She heard Mr. Helstone come in;\r\nshe saw Robert stride the tombs and vault the wall; she then went down\r\nto prayers. When she returned to her chamber, it was to meet the memory\r\nof Robert. Slumber\'s visitation was long averted. Long she sat at her\r\nlattice, long gazed down on the old garden and older church, on the\r\ntombs laid out all gray and calm, and clear in moonlight. She followed\r\nthe steps of the night, on its pathway of stars, far into the "wee sma\'\r\nhours ayont the twal\'." She was with Moore, in spirit, the whole time;\r\nshe was at his side; she heard his voice; she gave her hand into his\r\nhand; it rested warm in his fingers. When the church clock struck, when\r\nany other sound stirred, when a little mouse familiar to her chamber--an\r\nintruder for which she would never permit Fanny to lay a trap--came\r\nrattling amongst the links of her locket-chain, her one ring, and\r\nanother trinket or two on the toilet-table, to nibble a bit of biscuit\r\nlaid ready for it, she looked up, recalled momentarily to the real. Then\r\nshe said half aloud, as if deprecating the accusation of some unseen and\r\nunheard monitor, "I am not cherishing love dreams; I am only thinking\r\nbecause I cannot sleep. Of course, I know he will marry Shirley."\r\n\r\nWith returning silence, with the lull of the chime, and the retreat of\r\nher small untamed and unknown _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9_, she still resumed the dream,\r\nnestling to the vision\'s side--listening to, conversing with it. It\r\npaled at last. As dawn approached, the setting stars and breaking day\r\ndimmed the creation of fancy; the wakened song of birds hushed her\r\nwhispers. The tale full of fire, quick with interest, borne away by the\r\nmorning wind, became a vague murmur. The shape that, seen in a moonbeam,\r\nlived, had a pulse, had movement, wore health\'s glow and youth\'s\r\nfreshness, turned cold and ghostly gray, confronted with the red of\r\nsunrise. It wasted. She was left solitary at last. She crept to her\r\ncouch, chill and dejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nSHIRLEY SEEKS TO BE SAVED BY WORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Of course, I know he will marry Shirley," were her first words when she\r\nrose in the morning. "And he ought to marry her. She can help him," she\r\nadded firmly. "But I shall be forgotten when they _are_ married," was\r\nthe cruel succeeding thought. "Oh! I shall be wholly forgotten! And\r\nwhat--_what_ shall I do when Robert is taken quite from me? Where shall\r\nI turn? _My_ Robert! I wish I could justly call him mine. But I am\r\npoverty and incapacity; Shirley is wealth and power. And she is beauty\r\ntoo, and love. I cannot deny it. This is no sordid suit. She loves\r\nhim--not with inferior feelings. She loves, or _will_ love, as he must\r\nfeel proud to be loved. Not a valid objection can be made. Let them be\r\nmarried, then. But afterwards I shall be nothing to him. As for being\r\nhis sister, and all that stuff, I despise it. I will either be all or\r\nnothing to a man like Robert; no feeble shuffling or false cant is\r\nendurable. Once let that pair be united, and I will certainly leave\r\nthem. As for lingering about, playing the hypocrite, and pretending to\r\ncalm sentiments of friendship, when my soul will be wrung with other\r\nfeelings, I shall not descend to such degradation. As little could I\r\nfill the place of their mutual friend as that of their deadly foe; as\r\nlittle could I stand between them as trample over them. Robert is a\r\nfirst-rate man--in my eyes. I _have_ loved, _do_ love, and _must___ love\r\nhim. I would be his wife if I could; as I cannot, I must go where I\r\nshall never see him. There is but one alternative--to cleave to him as\r\nif I were a part of him, or to be sundered from him wide as the two\r\npoles of a sphere.--Sunder me then, Providence. Part us speedily."\r\n\r\nSome such aspirations as these were again working in her mind late in\r\nthe afternoon, when the apparition of one of the personages haunting her\r\nthoughts passed the parlour window. Miss Keeldar sauntered slowly by,\r\nher gait, her countenance, wearing that mixture of wistfulness and\r\ncarelessness which, when quiescent, was the wonted cast of her look and\r\ncharacter of her bearing. When animated, the carelessness quite\r\nvanished, the wistfulness became blent with a genial gaiety, seasoning\r\nthe laugh, the smile, the glance, with a unique flavour of sentiment, so\r\nthat mirth from her never resembled "the crackling of thorns under a\r\npot."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by not coming to see me this afternoon, as you\r\npromised?" was her address to Caroline as she entered the room.\r\n\r\n"I was not in the humour," replied Miss Helstone, very truly.\r\n\r\nShirley had already fixed on her a penetrating eye.\r\n\r\n"No," she said; "I see you are not in the humour for loving me. You are\r\nin one of your sunless, inclement moods, when one feels a\r\nfellow-creature\'s presence is not welcome to you. You have such moods.\r\nAre you aware of it?"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to stay long, Shirley?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I am come to have my tea, and must have it before I go. I shall\r\ntake the liberty, then, of removing my bonnet, without being asked."\r\n\r\nAnd this she did, and then stood on the rug with her hands behind her.\r\n\r\n"A pretty expression you have in your countenance," she went on, still\r\ngazing keenly, though not inimically--rather indeed pityingly--at\r\nCaroline. "Wonderfully self-supported you look, you solitude-seeking,\r\nwounded deer. Are you afraid Shirley will worry you if she discovers\r\nthat you are hurt, and that you bleed?"\r\n\r\n"I never do fear Shirley."\r\n\r\n"But sometimes you dislike her; often you avoid her. Shirley can feel\r\nwhen she is slighted and shunned. If you had not walked home in the\r\ncompany you did last night, you would have been a different girl to-day.\r\nWhat time did you reach the rectory?"\r\n\r\n"By ten."\r\n\r\n"Humph! You took three-quarters of an hour to walk a mile. Was it you,\r\nor Moore, who lingered so?"\r\n\r\n"Shirley, you talk nonsense."\r\n\r\n"_He_ talked nonsense--that I doubt not; or he looked it, which is a\r\nthousand times worse. I see the reflection of his eyes on your forehead\r\nat this moment. I feel disposed to call him out, if I could only get a\r\ntrustworthy second. I feel desperately irritated. I felt so last night,\r\nand have felt it all day."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t ask me why," she proceeded, after a pause, "you little\r\nsilent, over-modest thing; and you don\'t deserve that I should pour out\r\nmy secrets into your lap without an invitation. Upon my word, I could\r\nhave found it in my heart to have dogged Moore yesterday evening with\r\ndire intent. I have pistols, and can use them."\r\n\r\n"Stuff, Shirley! Which would you have shot--me or Robert?"\r\n\r\n"Neither, perhaps. Perhaps myself--more likely a bat or a tree-bough. He\r\nis a puppy, your cousin--a quiet, serious, sensible, judicious,\r\nambitious puppy. I see him standing before me, talking his half-stern,\r\nhalf-gentle talk, bearing me down (as I am very conscious he does) with\r\nhis fixity of purpose, etc.; and then--I have no patience with him!"\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar started off on a rapid walk through the room, repeating\r\nenergetically that she had no patience with men in general, and with her\r\ntenant in particular.\r\n\r\n"You are mistaken," urged Caroline, in some anxiety. "Robert is no puppy\r\nor male flirt; I can vouch for that."\r\n\r\n"_You_ vouch for it! Do you think I\'ll take your word on the subject?\r\nThere is no one\'s testimony I would not credit sooner than yours. To\r\nadvance Moore\'s fortune you would cut off your right hand."\r\n\r\n"But not tell lies. And if I speak the truth, I must assure you that he\r\nwas just civil to me last night--that was all."\r\n\r\n"I never asked what he was. I can guess. I saw him from the window take\r\nyour hand in his long fingers, just as he went out at my gate."\r\n\r\n"That is nothing. I am not a stranger, you know. I am an old\r\nacquaintance, and his cousin."\r\n\r\n"I feel indignant, and that is the long and short of the matter,"\r\nresponded Miss Keeldar. "All my comfort," she added presently, "is\r\nbroken up by his man\xc5\x93uvres. He keeps intruding between you and me.\r\nWithout him we should be good friends; but that six feet of puppyhood\r\nmakes a perpetually-recurring eclipse of our friendship. Again and again\r\nhe crosses and obscures the disc I want always to see clear; ever and\r\nanon he renders me to you a mere bore and nuisance."\r\n\r\n"No, Shirley, no."\r\n\r\n"He does. You did not want my society this afternoon, and I feel it\r\nhard. You are naturally somewhat reserved, but I am a social personage,\r\nwho cannot live alone. If we were but left unmolested, I have that\r\nregard for you that I could bear you in my presence for ever, and not\r\nfor the fraction of a second do I ever wish to be rid of you. You cannot\r\nsay as much respecting me."\r\n\r\n"Shirley, I can say anything you wish. Shirley, I like you."\r\n\r\n"You will wish me at Jericho to-morrow, Lina."\r\n\r\n"I shall not. I am every day growing more accustomed to--fonder of you.\r\nYou know I am too English to get up a vehement friendship all at once;\r\nbut you are so much better than common--you are so different to\r\nevery-day young ladies--I esteem you, I value you; you are never a\r\nburden to me--never. Do you believe what I say?"\r\n\r\n"Partly," replied Miss Keeldar, smiling rather incredulously; "but you\r\nare a peculiar personage. Quiet as you look, there is both a force and a\r\ndepth somewhere within not easily reached or appreciated. Then you\r\ncertainly are not happy."\r\n\r\n"And unhappy people are rarely good. Is that what you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all. I mean rather that unhappy people are often preoccupied,\r\nand not in the mood for discoursing with companions of my nature.\r\nMoreover, there is a sort of unhappiness which not only depresses, but\r\ncorrodes; and that, I fear, is your portion. Will pity do you any good,\r\nLina? If it will, take some from Shirley; she offers largely, and\r\nwarrants the article genuine."\r\n\r\n"Shirley, I never had a sister--you never had a sister; but it flashes\r\non me at this moment how sisters feel towards each other--affection\r\ntwined with their life, which no shocks of feeling can uproot, which\r\nlittle quarrels only trample an instant, that it may spring more freshly\r\nwhen the pressure is removed; affection that no passion can ultimately\r\noutrival, with which even love itself cannot do more than compete in\r\nforce and truth. Love hurts us so, Shirley. It is so tormenting, so\r\nracking, and it burns away our strength with its flame. In affection is\r\nno pain and no fire, only sustenance and balm. I am supported and\r\nsoothed when you--that is, _you only_--are near, Shirley. Do you\r\nbelieve me now?"\r\n\r\n"I am always easy of belief when the creed pleases me. We really are\r\nfriends, then, Lina, in spite of the black eclipse?"\r\n\r\n"We really are," returned the other, drawing Shirley towards her, and\r\nmaking her sit down, "chance what may."\r\n\r\n"Come, then; we will talk of something else than the Troubler." But at\r\nthis moment the rector came in, and the "something else" of which Miss\r\nKeeldar was about to talk was not again alluded to till the moment of\r\nher departure. She then delayed a few minutes in the passage to say,\r\n"Caroline, I wish to tell you that I have a great weight on my mind; my\r\nconscience is quite uneasy as if I had committed, or was going to\r\ncommit, a crime. It is not my _private_ conscience, you must understand,\r\nbut my landed-proprietor and lord-of-the-manor conscience. I have got\r\ninto the clutch of an eagle with iron talons. I have fallen under a\r\nstern influence, which I scarcely approve, but cannot resist. Something\r\nwill be done ere long, I fear, which it by no means pleases me to think\r\nof. To ease my mind, and to prevent harm as far as I can, I mean to\r\nenter on a series of good works. Don\'t be surprised, therefore, if you\r\nsee me all at once turn outrageously charitable. I have no idea how to\r\nbegin, but you must give me some advice. We will talk more on the\r\nsubject to-morrow; and just ask that excellent person, Miss Ainley, to\r\nstep up to Fieldhead. I have some notion of putting myself under her\r\ntuition. Won\'t she have a precious pupil? Drop a hint to her, Lina,\r\nthat, though a well-meaning, I am rather a neglected character, and then\r\nshe will feel less scandalized at my ignorance about clothing societies\r\nand such things."\r\n\r\nOn the morrow Caroline found Shirley sitting gravely at her desk, with\r\nan account-book, a bundle of banknotes, and a well-filled purse before\r\nher. She was looking mighty serious, but a little puzzled. She said she\r\nhad been "casting an eye" over the weekly expenditure in housekeeping at\r\nthe hall, trying to find out where she could retrench; that she had also\r\njust given audience to Mrs. Gill, the cook, and had sent that person\r\naway with a notion that her (Shirley\'s) brain was certainly crazed. "I\r\nhave lectured her on the duty of being careful," said she, "in a way\r\nquite new to her. So eloquent was I on the text of economy that I\r\nsurprised myself; for, you see, it is altogether a fresh idea. I never\r\nthought, much less spoke, on the subject till lately. But it is all\r\ntheory; for when I came to the practical part I could retrench nothing.\r\nI had not firmness to take off a single pound of butter, or to prosecute\r\nto any clear result an inquest into the destiny of either dripping,\r\nlard, bread, cold meat, or other kitchen perquisite whatever. I know we\r\nnever get up illuminations at Fieldhead, but I could not ask the meaning\r\nof sundry quite unaccountable pounds of candles. We do not wash for the\r\nparish, yet I viewed in silence items of soap and bleaching-powder\r\ncalculated to satisfy the solicitude of the most anxious inquirer after\r\nour position in reference to those articles. Carnivorous I am not, nor\r\nis Mrs. Pryor, nor is Mrs. Gill herself, yet I only hemmed and opened my\r\neyes a little wide when I saw butchers\' bills whose figures seemed to\r\nprove that fact--falsehood, I mean. Caroline, you may laugh at me, but\r\nyou can\'t change me. I am a poltroon on certain points; I feel it. There\r\nis a base alloy of moral cowardice in my composition. I blushed and hung\r\nmy head before Mrs. Gill, when she ought to have been faltering\r\nconfessions to me. I found it impossible to get up the spirit even to\r\nhint, much less to prove, to her that she was a cheat. I have no calm\r\ndignity, no true courage about me."\r\n\r\n"Shirley, what fit of self-injustice is this? My uncle, who is not given\r\nto speak well of women, says there are not ten thousand men in England\r\nas genuinely fearless as you."\r\n\r\n"I am fearless, physically; I am never nervous about danger. I was not\r\nstartled from self-possession when Mr. Wynne\'s great red bull rose with\r\na bellow before my face, as I was crossing the cowslip lea alone,\r\nstooped his begrimed, sullen head, and made a run at me; but I was\r\nafraid of seeing Mrs. Gill brought to shame and confusion of face. You\r\nhave twice--ten times--my strength of mind on certain subjects,\r\nCaroline. You, whom no persuasion can induce to pass a bull, however\r\nquiet he looks, would have firmly shown my housekeeper she had done\r\nwrong; then you would have gently and wisely admonished her; and at\r\nlast, I dare say, provided she had seemed penitent, you would have very\r\nsweetly forgiven her. Of this conduct I am incapable. However, in spite\r\nof exaggerated imposition, I still find we live within our means. I have\r\nmoney in hand, and I really must do some good with it. The Briarfield\r\npoor are badly off; they must be helped. What ought I to do, think you,\r\nLina? Had I not better distribute the cash at once?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, Shirley; you will not manage properly. I have often noticed\r\nthat your only notion of charity is to give shillings and half-crowns in\r\na careless, free-handed sort of way, which is liable to continual abuse.\r\nYou must have a prime minister, or you will get yourself into a series\r\nof scrapes. You suggested Miss Ainley yourself; to Miss Ainley I will\r\napply. And, meantime, promise to keep quiet, and not begin throwing away\r\nyour money. What a great deal you have, Shirley! You must feel very rich\r\nwith all that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I feel of consequence. It is not an immense sum, but I feel\r\nresponsible for its disposal; and really this responsibility weighs on\r\nmy mind more heavily than I could have expected. They say that there are\r\nsome families almost starving to death in Briarfield. Some of my own\r\ncottagers are in wretched circumstances. I must and will help them."\r\n\r\n"Some people say we shouldn\'t give alms to the poor, Shirley."\r\n\r\n"They are great fools for their pains. For those who are not hungry, it\r\nis easy to palaver about the degradation of charity, and so on: but they\r\nforget the brevity of life, as well as its bitterness. We have none of\r\nus long to live. Let us help each other through seasons of want and woe\r\nas well as we can, without heeding in the least the scruples of vain\r\nphilosophy."\r\n\r\n"But you do help others, Shirley. You give a great deal as it is."\r\n\r\n"Not enough. I must give more, or, I tell you, my brother\'s blood will\r\nsome day be crying to Heaven against me. For, after all, if political\r\nincendiaries come here to kindle conflagration in the neighbourhood, and\r\nmy property is attacked, I shall defend it like a tigress--I know I\r\nshall. Let me listen to Mercy as long as she is near me. Her voice once\r\ndrowned by the shout of ruffian defiance, and I shall be full of\r\nimpulses to resist and quell. If once the poor gather and rise in the\r\nform of the mob, I shall turn against them as an aristocrat; if they\r\nbully me, I must defy: if they attack, I must resist, and I will."\r\n\r\n"You talk like Robert."\r\n\r\n"I feel like Robert, only more fierily. Let them meddle with Robert, or\r\nRobert\'s mill, or Robert\'s interests, and I shall hate them. At present\r\nI am no patrician, nor do I regard the poor around me as plebeians; but\r\nif once they violently wrong me or mine, and then presume to dictate to\r\nus, I shall quite forget pity for their wretchedness and respect for\r\ntheir poverty, in scorn of their ignorance and wrath at their\r\ninsolence."\r\n\r\n"Shirley, how your eyes flash!"\r\n\r\n"Because my soul burns. Would you, any more than me, let Robert be borne\r\ndown by numbers?"\r\n\r\n"If I had your power to aid Robert, I would use it as you mean to use\r\nit. If I could be such a friend to him as you can be, I would stand by\r\nhim, as you mean to stand by him, till death."\r\n\r\n"And now, Lina, though your eyes don\'t flash, they glow. You drop your\r\nlids; but I saw a kindled spark. However, it is not yet come to\r\nfighting. What I want to do is to _prevent_ mischief. I cannot forget,\r\neither day or night, that these embittered feelings of the poor against\r\nthe rich have been generated in suffering: they would neither hate nor\r\nenvy us if they did not deem us so much happier than themselves. To\r\nallay this suffering, and thereby lessen this hate, let me, out of my\r\nabundance, give abundantly; and that the donation may go farther, let it\r\nbe made wisely. To that intent, we must introduce some clear, calm,\r\npractical sense into our councils. So go and fetch Miss Ainley."\r\n\r\nWithout another word Caroline put on her bonnet and departed. It may,\r\nperhaps, appear strange that neither she nor Shirley thought of\r\nconsulting Mrs. Pryor on their scheme; but they were wise in abstaining.\r\nTo have consulted her--and this they knew by instinct--would only have\r\nbeen to involve her in painful embarrassment. She was far better\r\ninformed, better read, a deeper thinker than Miss Ainley, but of\r\nadministrative energy, of executive activity, she had none. She would\r\nsubscribe her own modest mite to a charitable object willingly--secret\r\nalmsgiving suited her; but in public plans, on a large scale, she could\r\ntake no part; as to originating them, that was out of the question. This\r\nShirley knew, and therefore she did not trouble Mrs. Pryor by unavailing\r\nconferences, which could only remind her of her own deficiencies, and do\r\nno good.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright day for Miss Ainley when she was summoned to Fieldhead\r\nto deliberate on projects so congenial to her; when she was seated with\r\nall honour and deference at a table with paper, pen, ink, and--what was\r\nbest of all--cash before her, and requested to draw up a regular plan\r\nfor administering relief to the destitute poor of Briarfield. She, who\r\nknew them all, had studied their wants, had again and again felt in what\r\nway they might best be succoured, could the means of succour only be\r\nfound, was fully competent to the undertaking, and a meek exultation\r\ngladdened her kind heart as she felt herself able to answer clearly and\r\npromptly the eager questions put by the two young girls, as she showed\r\nthem in her answers how much and what serviceable knowledge she had\r\nacquired of the condition of her fellow-creatures around her.\r\n\r\nShirley placed at her disposal \xc2\xa3300, and at sight of the money Miss\r\nAinley\'s eyes filled with joyful tears; for she already saw the hungry\r\nfed, the naked clothed, the sick comforted thereby. She quickly drew up\r\na simple, sensible plan for its expenditure; and she assured them\r\nbrighter times would now come round, for she doubted not the lady of\r\nFieldhead\'s example would be followed by others. She should try to get\r\nadditional subscriptions, and to form a fund; but first she must consult\r\nthe clergy. Yes, on that point she was peremptory. Mr. Helstone, Dr.\r\nBoultby, Mr. Hall, _must_ be consulted (for not only must Briarfield be\r\nrelieved, but Whinbury and Nunnely). It would, she averred, be\r\npresumption in her to take a single step unauthorized by them.\r\n\r\nThe clergy were sacred beings in Miss Ainley\'s eyes; no matter what\r\nmight be the insignificance of the individual, his station made him\r\nholy. The very curates--who, in their trivial arrogance, were hardly\r\nworthy to tie her patten-strings, or carry her cotton umbrella, or check\r\nwoollen shawl--she, in her pure, sincere enthusiasm, looked upon as\r\nsucking saints. No matter how clearly their little vices and enormous\r\nabsurdities were pointed out to her, she could not see them; she was\r\nblind to ecclesiastical defects; the white surplice covered a multitude\r\nof sins.\r\n\r\nShirley, knowing this harmless infatuation on the part of her\r\nrecently-chosen prime minister, stipulated expressly that the curates\r\nwere to have no voice in the disposal of the money, that their meddling\r\nfingers were not to be inserted into the pie. The rectors, of course,\r\nmust be paramount, and they might be trusted. They had some experience,\r\nsome sagacity, and Mr. Hall, at least, had sympathy and loving-kindness\r\nfor his fellow-men; but as for the youth under them, they must be set\r\naside, kept down, and taught that subordination and silence best became\r\ntheir years and capacity.\r\n\r\nIt was with some horror Miss Ainley heard this language. Caroline,\r\nhowever, interposing with a mild word or two in praise of Mr Sweeting,\r\ncalmed her again. Sweeting was, indeed, her own favourite. She\r\nendeavoured to respect Messrs. Malone and Donne, but the slices of\r\nsponge-cake and glasses of cowslip or primrose wine she had at different\r\ntimes administered to Sweeting, when he came to see her in her little\r\ncottage, were ever offered with sentiments of truly motherly regard. The\r\nsame innocuous collation she had once presented to Malone; but that\r\npersonage evinced such open scorn of the offering, she had never\r\nventured to renew it. To Donne she always served the treat, and was\r\nhappy to see his approbation of it proved beyond a doubt by the fact of\r\nhis usually eating two pieces of cake, and putting a third in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nIndefatigable in her exertions where good was to be done, Miss Ainley\r\nwould immediately have set out on a walk of ten miles round to the three\r\nrectors, in order to show her plan, and humbly solicit their approval;\r\nbut Miss Keeldar interdicted this, and proposed, as an amendment, to\r\ncollect the clergy in a small select reunion that evening at Fieldhead.\r\nMiss Ainley was to meet them, and the plan was to be discussed in full\r\nprivy council.\r\n\r\nShirley managed to get the senior priesthood together accordingly, and\r\nbefore the old maid\'s arrival, she had, further, talked all the\r\ngentlemen into the most charming mood imaginable. She herself had taken\r\nin hand Dr. Boultby and Mr. Helstone. The first was a stubborn old\r\nWelshman, hot, opinionated, and obstinate, but withal a man who did a\r\ngreat deal of good, though not without making some noise about it. The\r\nlatter we know. She had rather a friendly feeling for both, especially\r\nfor old Helstone; and it cost her no trouble to be quite delightful to\r\nthem. She took them round the garden; she gathered them flowers; she was\r\nlike a kind daughter to them. Mr. Hall she left to Caroline--or rather,\r\nit was to Caroline\'s care Mr. Hall consigned himself.\r\n\r\nHe generally sought Caroline in every party where she and he happened to\r\nbe. He was not in general a lady\'s man, though all ladies liked him;\r\nsomething of a book-worm he was, near-sighted, spectacled, now and then\r\nabstracted. To old ladies he was kind as a son. To men of every\r\noccupation and grade he was acceptable. The truth, simplicity, frankness\r\nof his manners, the nobleness of his integrity, the reality and\r\nelevation of his piety, won him friends in every grade. His poor clerk\r\nand sexton delighted in him; the noble patron of his living esteemed him\r\nhighly. It was only with young, handsome, fashionable, and stylish\r\nladies he felt a little shy. Being himself a plain man--plain in aspect,\r\nplain in manners, plain in speech--he seemed to fear their dash,\r\nelegance, and airs. But Miss Helstone had neither dash nor airs, and her\r\nnative elegance was of a very quiet order--quiet as the beauty of a\r\nground-loving hedge-flower. He was a fluent, cheerful, agreeable talker.\r\nCaroline could talk too in a _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_. She liked Mr. Hall to come\r\nand take the seat next her in a party, and thus secure her from Peter\r\nAugustus Malone, Joseph Donne, or John Sykes; and Mr. Hall never failed\r\nto avail himself of this privilege when he possibly could. Such\r\npreference shown by a single gentleman to a single lady would certainly,\r\nin ordinary cases, have set in motion the tongues of the gossips; but\r\nCyril Hall was forty-five years old, slightly bald, and slightly gray,\r\nand nobody ever said or thought he was likely to be married to Miss\r\nHelstone. Nor did he think so himself. He was wedded already to his\r\nbooks and his parish. His kind sister Margaret, spectacled and learned\r\nlike himself, made him happy in his single state; he considered it too\r\nlate to change. Besides, he had known Caroline as a pretty little girl.\r\nShe had sat on his knee many a time; he had bought her toys and given\r\nher books; he felt that her friendship for him was mixed with a sort of\r\nfilial respect; he could not have brought himself to attempt to give\r\nanother colour to her sentiments, and his serene mind could glass a fair\r\nimage without feeling its depths troubled by the reflection.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Ainley arrived, she was made kindly welcome by every one. Mrs.\r\nPryor and Margaret Hall made room for her on the sofa between them; and\r\nwhen the three were seated, they formed a trio which the gay and\r\nthoughtless would have scorned, indeed, as quite worthless and\r\nunattractive--a middle-aged widow and two plain, spectacled old\r\nmaids--yet which had its own quiet value, as many a suffering and\r\nfriendless human being knew.\r\n\r\nShirley opened the business and showed the plan.\r\n\r\n"I know the hand which drew up that," said Mr. Hall, glancing at Miss\r\nAinley, and smiling benignantly. His approbation was won at once.\r\nBoultby heard and deliberated with bent brow and protruded under lip.\r\nHis consent he considered too weighty to be given in a hurry. Helstone\r\nglanced sharply round with an alert, suspicious expression, as if he\r\napprehended that female craft was at work, and that something in\r\npetticoats was somehow trying underhand to acquire too much influence,\r\nand make itself of too much importance. Shirley caught and comprehended\r\nthe expression. "This scheme is nothing," said she carelessly. "It is\r\nonly an outline--a mere suggestion. You, gentlemen, are requested to\r\ndraw up rules of your own."\r\n\r\nAnd she directly fetched her writing-case, smiling queerly to herself as\r\nshe bent over the table where it stood. She produced a sheet of paper, a\r\nnew pen, drew an arm-chair to the table, and presenting her hand to old\r\nHelstone, begged permission to install him in it. For a minute he was a\r\nlittle stiff, and stood wrinkling his copper-coloured forehead\r\nstrangely. At last he muttered, "Well, you are neither my wife nor my\r\ndaughter, so I\'ll be led for once; but mind--I know I _am_ led. Your\r\nlittle female man\xc5\x93uvres don\'t blind me."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Shirley, dipping the pen in the ink, and putting it into his\r\nhand, "you must regard me as Captain Keeldar to-day. This is quite a\r\ngentleman\'s affair--yours and mine entirely, doctor" (so she had dubbed\r\nthe rector). "The ladies there are only to be our aides-de-camp, and at\r\ntheir peril they speak, till we have settled the whole business."\r\n\r\nHe smiled a little grimly, and began to write. He soon interrupted\r\nhimself to ask questions, and consult his brethren, disdainfully lifting\r\nhis glance over the curly heads of the two girls and the demure caps of\r\nthe elder ladies, to meet the winking glasses and gray pates of the\r\npriests. In the discussion which ensued, all three gentlemen, to their\r\ninfinite credit, showed a thorough acquaintance with the poor of their\r\nparishes--an even minute knowledge of their separate wants. Each rector\r\nknew where clothing was needed, where food would be most acceptable,\r\nwhere money could be bestowed with a probability of it being judiciously\r\nlaid out. Wherever their memories fell short, Miss Ainley or Miss Hall,\r\nif applied to, could help them out; but both ladies took care not to\r\nspeak unless spoken to. Neither of them wanted to be foremost, but each\r\nsincerely desired to be useful; and useful the clergy consented to make\r\nthem--with which boon they were content.\r\n\r\nShirley stood behind the rectors, leaning over their shoulders now and\r\nthen to glance at the rules drawn up and the list of cases making out,\r\nlistening to all they said, and still at intervals smiling her queer\r\nsmile--a smile not ill-natured, but significant--too significant to be\r\ngenerally thought amiable. Men rarely like such of their fellows as read\r\ntheir inward nature too clearly and truly. It is good for women,\r\nespecially, to be endowed with a soft blindness; to have mild, dim eyes,\r\nthat never penetrate below the surface of things--that take all for what\r\nit seems. Thousands, knowing this, keep their eyelids drooped on system;\r\nbut the most downcast glance has its loophole, through which it can, on\r\noccasion, take its sentinel-survey of life. I remember once seeing a\r\npair of blue eyes, that were usually thought sleepy, secretly on the\r\nalert, and I knew by their expression--an expression which chilled my\r\nblood, it was in that quarter so wondrously unexpected--that for years\r\nthey had been accustomed to silent soul-reading. The world called the\r\nowner of these blue eyes _bonne petite femme_ (she was not an\r\nEnglishwoman). I learned her nature afterwards--got it off by\r\nheart--studied it in its farthest, most hidden recesses. She was the\r\nfinest, deepest, subtlest schemer in Europe.\r\n\r\nWhen all was at length settled to Miss Keeldar\'s mind, and the clergy\r\nhad entered so fully into the spirit of her plans as to head the\r\nsubscription-list with their signatures for \xc2\xa350 each, she ordered supper\r\nto be served, having previously directed Mrs. Gill to exercise her\r\nutmost skill in the preparation of this repast. Mr. Hall was no _bon\r\nvivant_--he was naturally an abstemious man, indifferent to luxury; but\r\nBoultby and Helstone both liked good cookery. The _recherch\xc3\xa9_ supper\r\nconsequently put them into excellent humour. They did justice to it,\r\nthough in a gentlemanly way--not in the mode Mr. Donne would have done\r\nhad he been present. A glass of fine wine was likewise tasted, with\r\ndiscerning though most decorous relish. Captain Keeldar was complimented\r\non his taste; the compliment charmed him. It had been his aim to gratify\r\nand satisfy his priestly guests. He had succeeded, and was radiant with\r\nglee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nMR. DONNE\'S EXODUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day Shirley expressed to Caroline how delighted she felt that\r\nthe little party had gone off so well.\r\n\r\n"I rather like to entertain a circle of gentlemen," said she. "It is\r\namusing to observe how they enjoy a judiciously concocted repast. For\r\nourselves, you see, these choice wines and these scientific dishes are\r\nof no importance to us; but gentlemen seem to retain something of the\r\n_na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9_ of children about food, and one likes to please them--that is,\r\nwhen they show the becoming, decent self-government of our admirable\r\nrectors. I watch Moore sometimes, to try and discover how he can be\r\npleased; but he has not that child\'s simplicity about him. Did you ever\r\nfind out his accessible point, Caroline? you have seen more of him than\r\nI."\r\n\r\n"It is not, at any rate, that of my uncle and Dr. Boultby," returned\r\nCaroline, smiling. She always felt a sort of shy pleasure in following\r\nMiss Keeldar\'s lead respecting the discussion of her cousin\'s character.\r\nLeft to herself, she would never have touched on the subject; but when\r\ninvited, the temptation of talking about him of whom she was ever\r\nthinking was irresistible. "But," she added, "I really don\'t know what\r\nit is, for I never watched Robert in my life but my scrutiny was\r\npresently baffled by finding he was watching me."\r\n\r\n"There it is!" exclaimed Shirley. "You can\'t fix your eyes on him but\r\nhis presently flash on you. He is never off his guard. He won\'t give you\r\nan advantage. Even when he does not look at you, his thoughts seem to be\r\nbusy amongst your own thoughts, tracing your words and actions to their\r\nsource, contemplating your motives at his ease. Oh! I know that sort of\r\ncharacter, or something in the same style. It is one that piques me\r\nsingularly. How does it affect you?"\r\n\r\nThis question was a specimen of one of Shirley\'s sharp, sudden turns.\r\nCaroline used to be fluttered by them at first, but she had now got into\r\nthe way of parrying these home-thrusts like a little Quakeress.\r\n\r\n"Pique you? In what way does it pique you?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Here he comes!" suddenly exclaimed Shirley, breaking off, starting up\r\nand running to the window. "Here comes a diversion. I never told you of\r\na superb conquest I have made lately--made at those parties to which I\r\ncan never persuade you to accompany me; and the thing has been done\r\nwithout effort or intention on my part--that I aver. There is the\r\nbell--and, by all that\'s delicious! there are two of them. Do they never\r\nhunt, then, except in couples? You may have one, Lina, and you may take\r\nyour choice. I hope I am generous enough. Listen to Tartar!"\r\n\r\nThe black-muzzled, tawny dog, a glimpse of which was seen in the chapter\r\nwhich first introduced its mistress to the reader, here gave tongue in\r\nthe hall, amidst whose hollow space the deep bark resounded formidably.\r\nA growl more terrible than the bark, menacing as muttered thunder,\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\n"Listen!" again cried Shirley, laughing. "You would think that the\r\nprelude to a bloody onslaught. They will be frightened. They don\'t know\r\nold Tartar as I do. They are not aware his uproars are all sound and\r\nfury, signifying nothing!"\r\n\r\nSome bustle was heard. "Down, sir, down!" exclaimed a high-toned,\r\nimperious voice, and then came a crack of a cane or whip. Immediately\r\nthere was a yell--a scutter--a run--a positive tumult.\r\n\r\n"O Malone, Malone!"\r\n\r\n"Down! down! down!" cried the high voice.\r\n\r\n"He really is worrying them!" exclaimed Shirley. "They have struck him.\r\nA blow is what he is not used to, and will not take."\r\n\r\nOut she ran. A gentleman was fleeing up the oak staircase, making for\r\nrefuge in the gallery or chambers in hot haste; another was backing fast\r\nto the stairfoot, wildly flourishing a knotty stick, at the same time\r\nreiterating, "Down! down! down!" while the tawny dog bayed, bellowed,\r\nhowled at him, and a group of servants came bundling from the kitchen.\r\nThe dog made a spring; the second gentleman turned tail and rushed after\r\nhis comrade. The first was already safe in a bedroom; he held the door\r\nagainst his fellow--nothing so merciless as terror. But the other\r\nfugitive struggled hard; the door was about to yield to his strength.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," was uttered in Miss Keeldar\'s silvery but vibrating tones,\r\n"spare my locks, if you please. Calm yourselves! Come down! Look at\r\nTartar; he won\'t harm a cat."\r\n\r\nShe was caressing the said Tartar. He lay crouched at her feet, his fore\r\npaws stretched out, his tail still in threatening agitation, his\r\nnostrils snorting, his bulldog eyes conscious of a dull fire. He was an\r\nhonest, phlegmatic, stupid, but stubborn canine character. He loved his\r\nmistress and John--the man who fed him--but was mostly indifferent to\r\nthe rest of the world. Quiet enough he was, unless struck or threatened\r\nwith a stick, and that put a demon into him at once.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Malone, how do you do?" continued Shirley, lifting up her mirth-lit\r\nface to the gallery. "That is not the way to the oak parlour; that is\r\nMrs. Pryor\'s apartment. Request your friend Mr. Donne to evacuate. I\r\nshall have the greatest pleasure in receiving him in a lower room."\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha!" cried Malone, in hollow laughter, quitting the door, and\r\nleaning over the massive balustrade. "Really that animal alarmed Donne.\r\nHe is a little timid," he proceeded, stiffening himself, and walking\r\ntrimly to the stairhead. "I thought it better to follow, in order to\r\nreassure him."\r\n\r\n"It appears you did. Well, come down, if you please.--John" (turning to\r\nher manservant), "go upstairs and liberate Mr. Donne.--Take care, Mr.\r\nMalone; the stairs are slippery."\r\n\r\nIn truth they were, being of polished oak. The caution came a little\r\nlate for Malone. He had slipped already in his stately descent, and was\r\nonly saved from falling by a clutch at the banisters, which made the\r\nwhole structure creak again.\r\n\r\nTartar seemed to think the visitor\'s descent effected with unwarranted\r\n_\xc3\xa9clat_, and accordingly he growled once more. Malone, however, was no\r\ncoward. The spring of the dog had taken him by surprise, but he passed\r\nhim now in suppressed fury rather than fear. If a look could have\r\nstrangled Tartar, he would have breathed no more. Forgetting politeness\r\nin his sullen rage, Malone pushed into the parlour before Miss Keeldar.\r\nHe glanced at Miss Helstone; he could scarcely bring himself to bend to\r\nher. He glared on both the ladies. He looked as if, had either of them\r\nbeen his wife, he would have made a glorious husband at the moment. In\r\neach hand he seemed as if he would have liked to clutch one and gripe\r\nher to death.\r\n\r\nHowever, Shirley took pity. She ceased to laugh; and Caroline was too\r\ntrue a lady to smile even at any one under mortification. Tartar was\r\ndismissed; Peter Augustus was soothed--for Shirley had looks and tones\r\nthat might soothe a very bull. He had sense to feel that, since he could\r\nnot challenge the owner of the dog, he had better be civil. And civil he\r\ntried to be; and his attempts being well received, he grew presently\r\n_very_ civil and quite himself again. He had come, indeed, for the\r\nexpress purpose of making himself charming and fascinating. Rough\r\nportents had met him on his first admission to Fieldhead; but that\r\npassage got over, charming and fascinating he resolved to be. Like\r\nMarch, having come in like a lion, he purposed to go out like a lamb.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of air, as it appeared, or perhaps for that of ready exit\r\nin case of some new emergency arising, he took his seat,--not on the\r\nsofa, where Miss Keeldar offered him enthronization, nor yet near the\r\nfireside, to which Caroline, by a friendly sign, gently invited him, but\r\non a chair close to the door. Being no longer sullen or furious, he\r\ngrew, after his fashion, constrained and embarrassed. He talked to the\r\nladies by fits and starts, choosing for topics whatever was most\r\nintensely commonplace. He sighed deeply, significantly, at the close of\r\nevery sentence; he sighed in each pause; he sighed ere he opened his\r\nmouth. At last, finding it desirable to add ease to his other charms, he\r\ndrew forth to aid him an ample silk pocket-handkerchief. This was to be\r\nthe graceful toy with which his unoccupied hands were to trifle. He went\r\nto work with a certain energy. He folded the red-and-yellow square\r\ncornerwise; he whipped it open with a waft; again he folded it in\r\nnarrower compass; he made of it a handsome band. To what purpose would\r\nhe proceed to apply the ligature? Would he wrap it about his throat--his\r\nhead? Should it be a comforter or a turban? Neither. Peter Augustus had\r\nan inventive, an original genius. He was about to show the ladies graces\r\nof action possessing at least the charm of novelty. He sat on the chair\r\nwith his athletic Irish legs crossed, and these legs, in that attitude,\r\nhe circled with the bandana and bound firmly together. It was evident\r\nhe felt this device to be worth an encore; he repeated it more than\r\nonce. The second performance sent Shirley to the window, to laugh her\r\nsilent but irrepressible laugh unseen; it turned Caroline\'s head aside,\r\nthat her long curls might screen the smile mantling on her features.\r\nMiss Helstone, indeed, was amused by more than one point in Peter\'s\r\ndemeanour. She was edified at the complete though abrupt diversion of\r\nhis homage from herself to the heiress. The \xc2\xa35,000 he supposed her\r\nlikely one day to inherit were not to be weighed in the balance against\r\nMiss Keeldar\'s estate and hall. He took no pains to conceal his\r\ncalculations and tactics. He pretended to no gradual change of views; he\r\nwheeled about at once. The pursuit of the lesser fortune was openly\r\nrelinquished for that of the greater. On what grounds he expected to\r\nsucceed in his chase himself best knew; certainly not by skilful\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nFrom the length of time that elapsed, it appeared that John had some\r\ndifficulty in persuading Mr. Donne to descend. At length, however, that\r\ngentleman appeared; nor, as he presented himself at the oak-parlour\r\ndoor, did he seem in the slightest degree ashamed or confused--not a\r\nwhit. Donne, indeed, was of that coldly phlegmatic, immovably\r\ncomplacent, densely self-satisfied nature which is insensible to shame.\r\nHe had never blushed in his life; no humiliation could abash him; his\r\nnerves were not capable of sensation enough to stir his life and make\r\ncolour mount to his cheek; he had no fire in his blood and no modesty in\r\nhis soul; he was a frontless, arrogant, decorous slip of the\r\ncommonplace--conceited, inane, insipid; and this gentleman had a notion\r\nof wooing Miss Keeldar! He knew no more, however, how to set about the\r\nbusiness than if he had been an image carved in wood. He had no idea of\r\na taste to be pleased, a heart to be reached in courtship. His notion\r\nwas, when he should have formally visited her a few times, to write a\r\nletter proposing marriage. Then he calculated she would accept him for\r\nlove of his office; then they would be married; then he should be master\r\nof Fieldhead; and he should live very comfortably, have servants at his\r\ncommand, eat and drink of the best, and be a great man. You would not\r\nhave suspected his intentions when he addressed his intended bride in an\r\nimpertinent, injured tone--"A very dangerous dog that, Miss Keeldar. I\r\nwonder you should keep such an animal."\r\n\r\n"Do you, Mr. Donne? Perhaps you will wonder more when I tell you I am\r\nvery fond of him."\r\n\r\n"I should say you are not serious in the assertion. Can\'t fancy a lady\r\nfond of that brute--\'tis so ugly--a mere carter\'s dog. Pray hang him."\r\n\r\n"Hang what I am fond of!"\r\n\r\n"And purchase in his stead some sweetly pooty pug or poodle--something\r\nappropriate to the fair sex. Ladies generally like lap-dogs."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I am an exception."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you can\'t be, you know. All ladies are alike in those matters. That\r\nis universally allowed."\r\n\r\n"Tartar frightened you terribly, Mr. Donne. I hope you won\'t take any\r\nharm."\r\n\r\n"That I shall, no doubt. He gave me a turn I shall not soon forget. When\r\nI _sor_ him" (such was Mr. Donne\'s pronunciation) "about to spring, I\r\nthought I should have fainted."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you did faint in the bedroom; you were a long time there."\r\n\r\n"No; I bore up that I might hold the door fast. I was determined not to\r\nlet any one enter. I thought I would keep a barrier between me and the\r\nenemy."\r\n\r\n"But what if your friend Mr. Malone had been worried?"\r\n\r\n"Malone must take care of himself. Your man persuaded me to come out at\r\nlast by saying the dog was chained up in his kennel. If I had not been\r\nassured of this, I would have remained all day in the chamber. But what\r\nis that? I declare the man has told a falsehood! The dog is there!"\r\n\r\nAnd indeed Tartar walked past the glass door opening to the garden,\r\nstiff, tawny, and black-muzzled as ever. He still seemed in bad humour.\r\nHe was growling again, and whistling a half-strangled whistle, being an\r\ninheritance from the bulldog side of his ancestry.\r\n\r\n"There are other visitors coming," observed Shirley, with that provoking\r\ncoolness which the owners of formidable-looking dogs are apt to show\r\nwhile their animals are all bristle and bay. Tartar sprang down the\r\npavement towards the gate, bellowing _avec explosion_. His mistress\r\nquietly opened the glass door, and stepped out chirruping to him. His\r\nbellow was already silenced, and he was lifting up his huge, blunt,\r\nstupid head to the new callers to be patted.\r\n\r\n"What! Tartar, Tartar!" said a cheery, rather boyish voice, "don\'t you\r\nknow us? Good-morning, old boy!"\r\n\r\nAnd little Mr. Sweeting, whose conscious good nature made him\r\ncomparatively fearless of man, woman, child, or brute, came through the\r\ngate, caressing the guardian. His vicar, Mr. Hall, followed. He had no\r\nfear of Tartar either, and Tartar had no ill-will to him. He snuffed\r\nboth the gentlemen round, and then, as if concluding that they were\r\nharmless, and might be allowed to pass, he withdrew to the sunny front\r\nof the hall, leaving the archway free. Mr. Sweeting followed, and would\r\nhave played with him; but Tartar took no notice of his caresses. It was\r\nonly his mistress\'s hand whose touch gave him pleasure; to all others he\r\nshowed himself obstinately insensible.\r\n\r\nShirley advanced to meet Messrs. Hall and Sweeting, shaking hands with\r\nthem cordially. They were come to tell her of certain successes they had\r\nachieved that morning in applications for subscriptions to the fund. Mr.\r\nHall\'s eyes beamed benignantly through his spectacles, his plain face\r\nlooked positively handsome with goodness; and when Caroline, seeing who\r\nwas come, ran out to meet him, and put both her hands into his, he gazed\r\ndown on her with a gentle, serene, affectionate expression that gave him\r\nthe aspect of a smiling Melanchthon.\r\n\r\nInstead of re-entering the house, they strayed through the garden, the\r\nladies walking one on each side of Mr. Hall. It was a breezy sunny day;\r\nthe air freshened the girls\' cheeks and gracefully dishevelled their\r\nringlets. Both of them looked pretty--one gay. Mr. Hall spoke oftenest\r\nto his brilliant companion, looked most frequently at the quiet one.\r\nMiss Keeldar gathered handfuls of the profusely blooming flowers whose\r\nperfume filled the enclosure. She gave some to Caroline, telling her to\r\nchoose a nosegay for Mr. Hall; and with her lap filled with delicate and\r\nsplendid blossoms, Caroline sat down on the steps of a summer-house. The\r\nvicar stood near her, leaning on his cane.\r\n\r\nShirley, who could not be inhospitable, now called out the neglected\r\npair in the oak parlour. She convoyed Donne past his dread enemy Tartar,\r\nwho, with his nose on his fore paws, lay snoring under the meridian sun.\r\nDonne was not grateful--he never _was_ grateful for kindness and\r\nattention--but he was glad of the safeguard. Miss Keeldar, desirous of\r\nbeing impartial, offered the curates flowers. They accepted them with\r\nnative awkwardness. Malone seemed specially at a loss, when a bouquet\r\nfilled one hand, while his shillelah occupied the other. Donne\'s "Thank\r\nyou!" was rich to hear. It was the most fatuous and arrogant of sounds,\r\nimplying that he considered this offering a homage to his merits, and an\r\nattempt on the part of the heiress to ingratiate herself into his\r\npriceless affections. Sweeting alone received the posy like a smart,\r\nsensible little man, as he was, putting it gallantly and nattily into\r\nhis buttonhole.\r\n\r\nAs a reward for his good manners, Miss Keeldar, beckoning him apart,\r\ngave him some commission, which made his eyes sparkle with glee. Away he\r\nflew, round by the courtyard to the kitchen. No need to give him\r\ndirections; he was always at home everywhere. Ere long he reappeared,\r\ncarrying a round table, which he placed under the cedar; then he\r\ncollected six garden-chairs from various nooks and bowers in the\r\ngrounds, and placed them in a circle. The parlour-maid--Miss Keeldar\r\nkept no footman--came out, bearing a napkin-covered tray. Sweeting\'s\r\nnimble fingers aided in disposing glasses, plates, knives, and forks; he\r\nassisted her too in setting forth a neat luncheon, consisting of cold\r\nchicken, ham, and tarts.\r\n\r\nThis sort of impromptu regale it was Shirley\'s delight to offer any\r\nchance guests; and nothing pleased her better than to have an alert,\r\nobliging little friend, like Sweeting, to run about her hand, cheerily\r\nreceive and briskly execute her hospitable hints. David and she were on\r\nthe best terms in the world; and his devotion to the heiress was quite\r\ndisinterested, since it prejudiced in nothing his faithful allegiance to\r\nthe magnificent Dora Sykes.\r\n\r\nThe repast turned out a very merry one. Donne and Malone, indeed,\r\ncontributed but little to its vivacity, the chief part they played in it\r\nbeing what concerned the knife, fork, and wine-glass; but where four\r\nsuch natures as Mr. Hall, David Sweeting, Shirley, and Caroline were\r\nassembled in health and amity, on a green lawn, under a sunny sky,\r\namidst a wilderness of flowers, there could not be ungenial dullness.\r\n\r\nIn the course of conversation Mr. Hall reminded the ladies that\r\nWhitsuntide was approaching, when the grand united Sunday-school\r\ntea-drinking and procession of the three parishes of Briarfield,\r\nWhinbury, and Nunnely were to take place. Caroline, he knew, would be at\r\nher post as teacher, he said, and he hoped Miss Keeldar would not be\r\nwanting. He hoped she would make her first public appearance amongst\r\nthem at that time. Shirley was not the person to miss an occasion of\r\nthis sort. She liked festive excitement, a gathering of happiness, a\r\nconcentration and combination of pleasant details, a throng of glad\r\nfaces, a muster of elated hearts. She told Mr. Hall they might count on\r\nher with security. She did not know what she would have to do, but they\r\nmight dispose of her as they pleased.\r\n\r\n"And," said Caroline, "you will promise to come to my table, and to sit\r\nnear me, Mr. Hall?"\r\n\r\n"I shall not fail, _Deo volente_," said he.--"I have occupied the place\r\non her right hand at these monster tea-drinkings for the last six\r\nyears," he proceeded, turning to Miss Keeldar. "They made her a\r\nSunday-school teacher when she was a little girl of twelve. She is not\r\nparticularly self-confident by nature, as you may have observed; and the\r\nfirst time she had to \'take a tray,\' as the phrase is, and make tea in\r\npublic, there was some piteous trembling and flushing. I observed the\r\nspeechless panic, the cups shaking in the little hand, and the\r\noverflowing teapot filled too full from the urn. I came to her aid, took\r\na seat near her, managed the urn and the slop-basin, and in fact made\r\nthe tea for her like any old woman."\r\n\r\n"I was very grateful to you," interposed Caroline.\r\n\r\n"You were. You told me so with an earnest sincerity that repaid me well,\r\ninasmuch as it was not like the majority of little ladies of twelve,\r\nwhom you may help and caress for ever without their evincing any quicker\r\nsense of the kindness done and meant than if they were made of wax and\r\nwood instead of flesh and nerves.--She kept close to me, Miss Keeldar,\r\nthe rest of the evening, walking with me over the grounds where the\r\nchildren were playing; she followed me into the vestry when all were\r\nsummoned into church; she would, I believe, have mounted with me to the\r\npulpit, had I not taken the previous precaution of conducting her to the\r\nrectory pew."\r\n\r\n"And he has been my friend ever since," said Caroline.\r\n\r\n"And always sat at her table, near her tray, and handed the cups--that\r\nis the extent of my services. The next thing I do for her will be to\r\nmarry her some day to some curate or mill-owner.--But mind, Caroline, I\r\nshall inquire about the bridegroom\'s character; and if he is not a\r\ngentleman likely to render happy the little girl who walked with me\r\nhand in hand over Nunnely Common, I will not officiate. So take care."\r\n\r\n"The caution is useless. I am not going to be married. I shall live\r\nsingle, like your sister Margaret, Mr. Hall."\r\n\r\n"Very well. You might do worse. Margaret is not unhappy. She has her\r\nbooks for a pleasure, and her brother for a care, and is content. If\r\never you want a home, if the day should come when Briarfield rectory is\r\nyours no longer, come to Nunnely vicarage. Should the old maid and\r\nbachelor be still living, they will make you tenderly welcome."\r\n\r\n"There are your flowers. Now," said Caroline, who had kept the nosegay\r\nshe had selected for him till this moment, "_you_ don\'t care for a\r\nbouquet, but you must give it to Margaret; only--to be sentimental for\r\nonce--keep that little forget-me-not, which is a wild flower I gathered\r\nfrom the grass; and--to be still more sentimental--let me take two or\r\nthree of the blue blossoms and put them in my souvenir."\r\n\r\nAnd she took out a small book with enamelled cover and silver clasp,\r\nwherein, having opened it, she inserted the flowers, writing round them\r\nin pencil, "To be kept for the sake of the Rev. Cyril Hall, my friend.\r\nMay --, 18--."\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Cyril Hall, on his part, also placed a sprig in safety between\r\nthe leaves of a pocket Testament. He only wrote on the margin,\r\n"Caroline."\r\n\r\n"Now," said he, smiling, "I trust we are romantic enough. Miss Keeldar,"\r\nhe continued (the curates, by-the-bye, during this conversation, were\r\ntoo much occupied with their own jokes to notice what passed at the\r\nother end of the table), "I hope you are laughing at this trait of\r\n\'_exaltation_\' in the old gray-headed vicar; but the fact is, I am so\r\nused to comply with the requests of this young friend of yours, I don\'t\r\nknow how to refuse her when she tells me to do anything. You would say\r\nit is not much in my way to traffic with flowers and forget-me-nots;\r\nbut, you see, when requested to be sentimental, I am obedient."\r\n\r\n"He is naturally rather sentimental," remarked Caroline. "Margaret told\r\nme so, and I know what pleases him."\r\n\r\n"That you should be good and happy? Yes; that is one of my greatest\r\npleasures. May God long preserve to you the blessings of peace and\r\ninnocence! By which phrase I mean _comparative_ innocence; for in His\r\nsight, I am well aware, _none_ are pure. What to our human perceptions\r\nlooks spotless as we fancy angels, is to Him but frailty, needing the\r\nblood of His Son to cleanse, and the strength of His Spirit to sustain.\r\nLet us each and all cherish humility--I, as you, my young friends; and\r\nwe may well do it when we look into our own hearts, and see there\r\ntemptations, inconsistencies, propensities, even we blush to recognize.\r\nAnd it is not youth, nor good looks, nor grace, nor any gentle outside\r\ncharm which makes either beauty or goodness in God\'s eyes.--Young\r\nladies, when your mirror or men\'s tongues flatter you, remember that, in\r\nthe sight of her Maker, Mary Ann Ainley--a woman whom neither glass nor\r\nlips have ever panegyrized--is fairer and better than either of you. She\r\nis indeed," he added, after a pause--"she is indeed. You young things,\r\nwrapt up in yourselves and in earthly hopes, scarcely live as Christ\r\nlived. Perhaps you cannot do it yet, while existence is so sweet and\r\nearth so smiling to you; it would be too much to expect. She, with meek\r\nheart and due reverence, treads close in her Redeemer\'s steps."\r\n\r\nHere the harsh voice of Donne broke in on the mild tones of Mr. Hall.\r\n"Ahem!" he began, clearing his throat evidently for a speech of some\r\nimportance--"ahem! Miss Keeldar, your attention an instant, if you\r\nplease."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Shirley nonchalantly, "what is it? I listen. All of me is\r\near that is not eye."\r\n\r\n"I hope part of you is hand also," returned Donne, in his vulgarly\r\npresumptuous and familiar style, "and part purse. It is to the hand and\r\npurse I propose to appeal. I came here this morning with a view to beg\r\nof you----"\r\n\r\n"You should have gone to Mrs. Gill; she is my almoner."\r\n\r\n"To beg of you a subscription to a school. I and Dr. Boultby intend to\r\nerect one in the hamlet of Ecclefigg, which is under our vicarage of\r\nWhinbury. The Baptists have got possession of it. They have a chapel\r\nthere, and we want to dispute the ground."\r\n\r\n"But I have nothing to do with Ecclefigg. I possess no property there."\r\n\r\n"What does that signify? You\'re a churchwoman, ain\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Admirable creature!" muttered Shirley, under her breath. "Exquisite\r\naddress! Fine style! What raptures he excites in me!" Then aloud, "I am\r\na churchwoman, certainly."\r\n\r\n"Then you can\'t refuse to contribute in this case. The population of\r\nEcclefigg are a parcel of brutes; we want to civilize them."\r\n\r\n"Who is to be the missionary?"\r\n\r\n"Myself, probably."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t fail through lack of sympathy with your flock."\r\n\r\n"I hope not--I expect success; but we must have money. There is the\r\npaper. Pray give a handsome sum."\r\n\r\nWhen asked for money, Shirley rarely held back. She put down her name\r\nfor \xc2\xa35. After the \xc2\xa3300 she had lately given, and the many smaller sums\r\nshe was giving constantly, it was as much as she could at present\r\nafford. Donne looked at it, declared the subscription "shabby," and\r\nclamorously demanded more. Miss Keeldar flushed up with some indignation\r\nand more astonishment.\r\n\r\n"At present I shall give no more," said she.\r\n\r\n"Not give more! Why, I expected you to head the list with a cool\r\nhundred. With your property, you should never put down a signature for\r\nless."\r\n\r\nShe was silent.\r\n\r\n"In the south," went on Donne, "a lady with a thousand a year would be\r\nashamed to give five pounds for a public object."\r\n\r\nShirley, so rarely haughty, looked so now. Her slight frame became\r\nnerved; her distinguished face quickened with scorn.\r\n\r\n"Strange remarks?" said she--"most inconsiderate! Reproach in return for\r\nbounty is misplaced."\r\n\r\n"Bounty! Do you call five pounds bounty?"\r\n\r\n"I do; and bounty which, had I not given it to Dr. Boultby\'s intended\r\nschool, of the erection of which I approve, and in no sort to his\r\ncurate, who seems ill-advised in his manner of applying for, or rather\r\nextorting, subscriptions--bounty, I repeat, which, but for this\r\nconsideration, I should instantly reclaim."\r\n\r\nDonne was thick-skinned. He did not feel all or half that the tone, air,\r\nglance of the speaker expressed. He knew not on what ground he stood.\r\n\r\n"Wretched place this Yorkshire," he went on. "I could never have formed\r\nan idea_r_ of the country had I not seen it. And the people--rich and\r\npoor--what a set! How _corse_ and uncultivated! They would be scouted in\r\nthe south."\r\n\r\nShirley leaned forwards on the table, her nostrils dilating a little,\r\nher taper fingers interlaced and compressing each other hard.\r\n\r\n"The rich," pursued the infatuated and unconscious Donne, "are a parcel\r\nof misers, never living as persons with their incomes ought to live. You\r\nscarsley"--(you must excuse Mr. Donne\'s pronunciation, reader; it was\r\nvery choice; he considered it genteel, and prided himself on his\r\nsouthern accent; northern ears received with singular sensations his\r\nutterance of certain words)--"you scarsley ever see a fam\'ly where a\r\npropa carriage or a reg\'la butla is kep; and as to the poor--just look\r\nat them when they come crowding about the church doors on the occasion\r\nof a marriage or a funeral, clattering in clogs; the men in their\r\nshirt-sleeves and wool-combers\' aprons, the women in mob-caps and\r\nbed-gowns. They positively deserve that one should turn a mad cow in\r\namongst them to rout their rabble-ranks. He-he! what fun it would be!"\r\n\r\n"There! you have reached the climax," said Shirley quietly. "You have\r\nreached the climax," she repeated, turning her glowing glance towards\r\nhim. "You cannot go beyond it, and," she added with emphasis, "you\r\n_shall_ not, in my house."\r\n\r\nUp she rose--nobody could control her now, for she was\r\nexasperated--straight she walked to her garden gates, wide she flung\r\nthem open.\r\n\r\n"Walk through," she said austerely, "and pretty quickly, and set foot on\r\nthis pavement no more."\r\n\r\nDonne was astounded. He had thought all the time he was showing himself\r\noff to high advantage, as a lofty-souled person of the first "ton;" he\r\nimagined he was producing a crushing impression. Had he not expressed\r\ndisdain of everything in Yorkshire? What more conclusive proof could be\r\ngiven that he was better than anything there? And yet here was he about\r\nto be turned like a dog out of a Yorkshire garden! Where, under such\r\ncircumstances, was the "concatenation accordingly"?\r\n\r\n"Rid me of you instantly--instantly!" reiterated Shirley, as he\r\nlingered.\r\n\r\n"Madam--a clergyman! turn out a clergyman!"\r\n\r\n"Off! Were you an archbishop you have proved yourself no gentleman, and\r\nmust go. Quick!"\r\n\r\nShe was quite resolved. There was no trifling with her. Besides, Tartar\r\nwas again rising; he perceived symptoms of a commotion; he manifested a\r\ndisposition to join in. There was evidently nothing for it but to go,\r\nand Donne made his exodus, the heiress sweeping him a deep curtsy as she\r\nclosed the gates on him.\r\n\r\n"How dare the pompous priest abuse his flock! How dare the lisping\r\ncockney revile Yorkshire!" was her sole observation on the circumstance,\r\nas she returned to the table.\r\n\r\nEre long the little party broke up; Miss Keeldar\'s ruffled and darkened\r\nbrow, curled lip, and incensed eye gave no invitation to further social\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nWHITSUNTIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fund prospered. By dint of Miss Keeldar\'s example, the three\r\nrectors\' vigorous exertions, and the efficient though quiet aid of their\r\nspinster and spectacled lieutenants, Mary Ann Ainley and Margaret Hall,\r\na handsome sum was raised; and this being judiciously managed, served\r\nfor the present greatly to alleviate the distress of the unemployed\r\npoor. The neighbourhood seemed to grow calmer. For a fortnight past no\r\ncloth had been destroyed; no outrage on mill or mansion had been\r\ncommitted in the three parishes. Shirley was sanguine that the evil she\r\nwished to avert was almost escaped, that the threatened storm was\r\npassing over. With the approach of summer she felt certain that trade\r\nwould improve--it always did; and then this weary war could not last for\r\never; peace must return one day. With peace, what an impulse would be\r\ngiven to commerce!\r\n\r\nSuch was the usual tenor of her observations to her tenant, G\xc3\xa9rard\r\nMoore, whenever she met him where they could converse; and Moore would\r\nlisten very quietly--too quietly to satisfy her. She would then by her\r\nimpatient glance demand something more from him--some explanation, or at\r\nleast some additional remark. Smiling in his way, with that expression\r\nwhich gave a remarkable cast of sweetness to his mouth, while his brow\r\nremained grave, he would answer to the effect that himself too trusted\r\nin the finite nature of the war; that it was indeed on that ground the\r\nanchor of his hopes was fixed; thereon his speculations depended. "For\r\nyou are aware," he would continue, "that I now work Hollow\'s Mill\r\nentirely on speculation. I sell nothing; there is no market for my\r\ngoods. I manufacture for a future day. I make myself ready to take\r\nadvantage of the first opening that shall occur. Three months ago this\r\nwas impossible to me; I had exhausted both credit and capital. You well\r\nknow who came to my rescue, from what hand I received the loan which\r\nsaved me. It is on the strength of that loan I am enabled to continue\r\nthe bold game which, a while since, I feared I should never play more.\r\nTotal ruin I know will follow loss, and I am aware that gain is\r\ndoubtful; but I am quite cheerful. So long as I can be active, so long\r\nas I can strive, so long, in short, as my hands are not tied, it is\r\nimpossible for me to be depressed. One year--nay, but six months--of the\r\nreign of the olive, and I am safe; for, as you say, peace will give an\r\nimpulse to commerce. In this you are right; but as to the restored\r\ntranquillity of the neighbourhood, as to the permanent good effect of\r\nyour charitable fund, I doubt. Eleemosynary relief never yet\r\ntranquillized the working-classes--it never made them grateful; it is\r\nnot in human nature that it should. I suppose, were all things ordered\r\naright, they ought not to be in a position to need that humiliating\r\nrelief; and this they feel. We should feel it were we so placed.\r\nBesides, to whom should they be grateful? To you, to the clergy perhaps,\r\nbut not to us mill-owners. They hate us worse than ever. Then the\r\ndisaffected here are in correspondence with the disaffected elsewhere.\r\nNottingham is one of their headquarters, Manchester another, Birmingham\r\na third. The subalterns receive orders from their chiefs; they are in a\r\ngood state of discipline; no blow is struck without mature deliberation.\r\nIn sultry weather you have seen the sky threaten thunder day by day, and\r\nyet night after night the clouds have cleared, and the sun has set\r\nquietly; but the danger was not gone--it was only delayed. The\r\nlong-threatening storm is sure to break at last. There is analogy\r\nbetween the moral and physical atmosphere."\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Moore" (so these conferences always ended), "take care of\r\nyourself. If you think that I have ever done you any good, reward me by\r\npromising to take care of yourself."\r\n\r\n"I do; I will take close and watchful care. I wish to live, not to die.\r\nThe future opens like Eden before me; and still, when I look deep into\r\nthe shades of my paradise, I see a vision that I like better than seraph\r\nor cherub glide across remote vistas."\r\n\r\n"Do you? Pray, what vision?"\r\n\r\n"I see----"\r\n\r\nThe maid came bustling in with the tea-things.\r\n\r\nThe early part of that May, as we have seen, was fine; the middle was\r\nwet; but in the last week, at change of moon, it cleared again. A fresh\r\nwind swept off the silver-white, deep-piled rain-clouds, bearing them,\r\nmass on mass, to the eastern horizon, on whose verge they dwindled, and\r\nbehind whose rim they disappeared, leaving the vault behind all pure\r\nblue space, ready for the reign of the summer sun. That sun rose broad\r\non Whitsuntide. The gathering of the schools was signalized by splendid\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nWhit-Tuesday was the great day, in preparation for which the two large\r\nschoolrooms of Briarfield, built by the present rector, chiefly at his\r\nown expense, were cleaned out, whitewashed, repainted, and decorated\r\nwith flowers and evergreens--some from the rectory garden, two cartloads\r\nfrom Fieldhead, and a wheel-barrowful from the more stingy domain of De\r\nWalden, the residence of Mr. Wynne. In these schoolrooms twenty tables,\r\neach calculated to accommodate twenty guests, were laid out, surrounded\r\nwith benches, and covered with white cloths. Above them were suspended\r\nat least some twenty cages, containing as many canaries, according to a\r\nfancy of the district, specially cherished by Mr. Helstone\'s clerk, who\r\ndelighted in the piercing song of these birds, and knew that amidst\r\nconfusion of tongues they always carolled loudest. These tables, be it\r\nunderstood, were not spread for the twelve hundred scholars to be\r\nassembled from the three parishes, but only for the patrons and teachers\r\nof the schools. The children\'s feast was to be spread in the open air.\r\nAt one o\'clock the troops were to come in; at two they were to be\r\nmarshalled; till four they were to parade the parish; then came the\r\nfeast, and afterwards the meeting, with music and speechifying in the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nWhy Briarfield was chosen for the point of rendezvous--the scene of the\r\n_f\xc3\xaate_--should be explained. It was not because it was the largest or\r\nmost populous parish--Whinbury far outdid it in that respect; nor\r\nbecause it was the oldest, antique as were the hoary church and\r\nrectory--Nunnely\'s low-roofed temple and mossy parsonage, buried both in\r\ncoeval oaks, outstanding sentinels of Nunnwood, were older still. It was\r\nsimply because Mr. Helstone willed it so, and Mr. Helstone\'s will was\r\nstronger than that of Boultby or Hall; the former _could_ not, the\r\nlatter _would_ not, dispute a point of precedence with their resolute\r\nand imperious brother. They let him lead and rule.\r\n\r\nThis notable anniversary had always hitherto been a trying day to\r\nCaroline Helstone, because it dragged her perforce into public,\r\ncompelling her to face all that was wealthy, respectable, influential in\r\nthe neighbourhood; in whose presence, but for the kind countenance of\r\nMr. Hall, she would have appeared unsupported. Obliged to be\r\nconspicuous; obliged to walk at the head of her regiment as the rector\'s\r\nniece, and first teacher of the first class; obliged to make tea at the\r\nfirst table for a mixed multitude of ladies and gentlemen, and to do all\r\nthis without the countenance of mother, aunt, or other chaperon--she,\r\nmeantime, being a nervous person, who mortally feared publicity--it will\r\nbe comprehended that, under these circumstances, she trembled at the\r\napproach of Whitsuntide.\r\n\r\nBut this year Shirley was to be with her, and that changed the aspect of\r\nthe trial singularly--it changed it utterly. It was a trial no\r\nlonger--it was almost an enjoyment. Miss Keeldar was better in her\r\nsingle self than a host of ordinary friends. Quite self-possessed, and\r\nalways spirited and easy; conscious of her social importance, yet never\r\npresuming upon it--it would be enough to give one courage only to look\r\nat her. The only fear was lest the heiress should not be punctual to\r\ntryst. She often had a careless way of lingering behind time, and\r\nCaroline knew her uncle would not wait a second for any one. At the\r\nmoment of the church clock tolling two, the bells would clash out and\r\nthe march begin. She must look after Shirley, then, in this matter, or\r\nher expected companion would fail her.\r\n\r\nWhit-Tuesday saw her rise almost with the sun. She, Fanny, and Eliza\r\nwere busy the whole morning arranging the rectory parlours in first-rate\r\ncompany order, and setting out a collation of cooling\r\nrefreshments--wine, fruit, cakes--on the dining-room sideboard. Then she\r\nhad to dress in her freshest and fairest attire of white muslin: the\r\nperfect fineness of the day and the solemnity of the occasion warranted,\r\nand even exacted, such costume. Her new sash--a birthday present from\r\nMargaret Hall, which she had reason to believe Cyril himself had bought,\r\nand in return for which she had indeed given him a set of cambric bands\r\nin a handsome case--was tied by the dexterous fingers of Fanny, who took\r\nno little pleasure in arraying her fair young mistress for the occasion.\r\nHer simple bonnet had been trimmed to correspond with her sash; her\r\npretty but inexpensive scarf of white crape suited her dress. When ready\r\nshe formed a picture, not bright enough to dazzle, but fair enough to\r\ninterest; not brilliantly striking, but very delicately pleasing--a\r\npicture in which sweetness of tint, purity of air, and grace of mien\r\natoned for the absence of rich colouring and magnificent contour. What\r\nher brown eye and clear forehead showed of her mind was in keeping with\r\nher dress and face--modest, gentle, and, though pensive, harmonious. It\r\nappeared that neither lamb nor dove need fear her, but would welcome\r\nrather, in her look of simplicity and softness, a sympathy with their\r\nown natures, or with the natures we ascribe to them.\r\n\r\nAfter all, she was an imperfect, faulty human being, fair enough of\r\nform, hue, and array, but, as Cyril Hall said, neither so good nor so\r\ngreat as the withered Miss Ainley, now putting on her best black gown\r\nand Quaker drab shawl and bonnet in her own narrow cottage chamber.\r\n\r\nAway Caroline went, across some very sequestered fields and through some\r\nquite hidden lanes, to Fieldhead. She glided quickly under the green\r\nhedges and across the greener leas. There was no dust, no moisture, to\r\nsoil the hem of her stainless garment, or to damp her slender sandal.\r\nAfter the late rains all was clean, and under the present glowing sun\r\nall was dry. She walked fearlessly, then, on daisy and turf, and through\r\nthick plantations; she reached Fieldhead, and penetrated to Miss\r\nKeeldar\'s dressing-room.\r\n\r\nIt was well she had come, or Shirley would have been too late. Instead\r\nof making ready with all speed, she lay stretched on a couch, absorbed\r\nin reading. Mrs. Pryor stood near, vainly urging her to rise and dress.\r\nCaroline wasted no words. She immediately took the book from her, and\r\nwith her own hands commenced the business of disrobing and rerobing her.\r\nShirley, indolent with the heat, and gay with her youth and pleasurable\r\nnature, wanted to talk, laugh, and linger; but Caroline, intent on being\r\nin time, persevered in dressing her as fast as fingers could fasten\r\nstrings or insert pins. At length, as she united a final row of hooks\r\nand eyes, she found leisure to chide her, saying she was very naughty to\r\nbe so unpunctual, that she looked even now the picture of incorrigible\r\ncarelessness; and so Shirley did, but a very lovely picture of that\r\ntiresome quality.\r\n\r\nShe presented quite a contrast to Caroline. There was style in every\r\nfold of her dress and every line of her figure. The rich silk suited her\r\nbetter than a simpler costume; the deep embroidered scarf became her.\r\nShe wore it negligently but gracefully. The wreath on her bonnet\r\ncrowned her well. The attention to fashion, the tasteful appliance of\r\nornament in each portion of her dress, were quite in place with her. All\r\nthis suited her, like the frank light in her eyes, the rallying smile\r\nabout her lips, like her shaft-straight carriage and lightsome step.\r\nCaroline took her hand when she was dressed, hurried her downstairs, out\r\nof doors; and thus they sped through the fields, laughing as they went,\r\nand looking very much like a snow-white dove and gem-tinted bird of\r\nparadise joined in social flight.\r\n\r\nThanks to Miss Helstone\'s promptitude, they arrived in good time. While\r\nyet trees hid the church, they heard the bell tolling a measured but\r\nurgent summons for all to assemble. The trooping in of numbers, the\r\ntrampling of many steps and murmuring of many voices, were likewise\r\naudible. From a rising ground, they presently saw, on the Whinbury road,\r\nthe Whinbury school approaching. It numbered five hundred souls. The\r\nrector and curate, Boultby and Donne, headed it--the former looming\r\nlarge in full canonicals, walking as became a beneficed priest, under\r\nthe canopy of a shovel-hat, with the dignity of an ample corporation,\r\nthe embellishment of the squarest and vastest of black coats, and the\r\nsupport of the stoutest of gold-headed canes. As the doctor walked, he\r\nnow and then slightly flourished his cane, and inclined his shovel-hat\r\nwith a dogmatical wag towards his aide-de-camp. That\r\naide-de-camp--Donne, to wit--narrow as the line of his shape was,\r\ncompared to the broad bulk of his principal, contrived, notwithstanding,\r\nto look every inch a curate. All about him was pragmatical and\r\nself-complacent, from his turned-up nose and elevated chin to his\r\nclerical black gaiters, his somewhat short, strapless trousers, and his\r\nsquare-toed shoes.\r\n\r\nWalk on, Mr. Donne! You have undergone scrutiny. You think you look\r\nwell. Whether the white and purple figures watching you from yonder hill\r\nthink so is another question.\r\n\r\nThese figures come running down when the regiment has marched by. The\r\nchurchyard is full of children and teachers, all in their very best\r\nholiday attire; and, distressed as is the district, bad as are the\r\ntimes, it is wonderful to see how respectably, how handsomely even, they\r\nhave contrived to clothe themselves. That British love of decency will\r\nwork miracles. The poverty which reduces an Irish girl to rags is\r\nimpotent to rob the English girl of the neat wardrobe she knows\r\nnecessary to her self-respect. Besides, the lady of the manor--that\r\nShirley, now gazing with pleasure on this well-dressed and happy-looking\r\ncrowd--has really done them good. Her seasonable bounty consoled many a\r\npoor family against the coming holiday, and supplied many a child with a\r\nnew frock or bonnet for the occasion. She knows it, and is elate with\r\nthe consciousness--glad that her money, example, and influence have\r\nreally, substantially, benefited those around her. She cannot be\r\ncharitable like Miss Ainley: it is not in her nature. It relieves her to\r\nfeel that there is another way of being charitable, practicable for\r\nother characters, and under other circumstances.\r\n\r\nCaroline, too, is pleased, for she also has done good in her small\r\nway--robbed herself of more than one dress, ribbon, or collar she could\r\nill spare, to aid in fitting out the scholars of her class; and as she\r\ncould not give money, she has followed Miss Ainley\'s example in giving\r\nher time and her industry to sew for the children.\r\n\r\nNot only is the churchyard full, but the rectory garden is also\r\nthronged. Pairs and parties of ladies and gentlemen are seen walking\r\namongst the waving lilacs and laburnums. The house also is occupied: at\r\nthe wide-open parlour windows gay groups are standing. These are the\r\npatrons and teachers, who are to swell the procession. In the parson\'s\r\ncroft, behind the rectory, are the musicians of the three parish bands,\r\nwith their instruments. Fanny and Eliza, in the smartest of caps and\r\ngowns, and the whitest of aprons, move amongst them, serving out quarts\r\nof ale, whereof a stock was brewed very sound and strong some weeks\r\nsince by the rector\'s orders, and under his special superintendence.\r\nWhatever he had a hand in must be managed handsomely. "Shabby doings" of\r\nany description were not endured under his sanction. From the erection\r\nof a public building, a church, school, or court-house, to the cooking\r\nof a dinner, he still advocated the lordly, liberal, and effective. Miss\r\nKeeldar was like him in this respect, and they mutually approved each\r\nother\'s arrangements.\r\n\r\nCaroline and Shirley were soon in the midst of the company. The former\r\nmet them very easily for her. Instead of sitting down in a retired\r\ncorner, or stealing away to her own room till the procession should be\r\nmarshalled, according to her wont, she moved through the three\r\nparlours, conversed and smiled, absolutely spoke once or twice ere she\r\nwas spoken to, and, in short, seemed a new creature. It was Shirley\'s\r\npresence which thus transformed her; the view of Miss Keeldar\'s air and\r\nmanner did her a world of good. Shirley had no fear of her kind, no\r\ntendency to shrink from, to avoid it. All human beings--men, women, or\r\nchildren--whom low breeding or coarse presumption did not render\r\npositively offensive, were welcome enough to her--some much more so than\r\nothers, of course; but, generally speaking, till a man had indisputably\r\nproved himself bad and a nuisance, Shirley was willing to think him good\r\nand an acquisition, and to treat him accordingly. This disposition made\r\nher a general favourite, for it robbed her very raillery of its sting,\r\nand gave her serious or smiling conversation a happy charm; nor did it\r\ndiminish the value of her intimate friendship, which was a distinct\r\nthing from this social benevolence--depending, indeed, on quite a\r\ndifferent part of her character. Miss Helstone was the choice of her\r\naffection and intellect; the Misses Pearson, Sykes, Wynne, etc., etc.,\r\nonly the profiteers by her good-nature and vivacity.\r\n\r\nDonne happened to come into the drawing-room while Shirley, sitting on\r\nthe sofa, formed the centre of a tolerably wide circle. She had already\r\nforgotten her exasperation against him, and she bowed and smiled\r\ngood-humouredly. The disposition of the man was then seen. He knew\r\nneither how to decline the advance with dignity, as one whose just pride\r\nhas been wounded, nor how to meet it with frankness, as one who is glad\r\nto forget and forgive. His punishment had impressed him with no sense of\r\nshame, and he did not experience that feeling on encountering his\r\nchastiser. He was not vigorous enough in evil to be actively\r\nmalignant--he merely passed by sheepishly with a rated, scowling look.\r\nNothing could ever again reconcile him to his enemy; while no passion of\r\nresentment, for even sharper and more ignominious inflictions, could his\r\nlymphatic nature know.\r\n\r\n"He was not worth a scene!" said Shirley to Caroline. "What a fool I\r\nwas! To revenge on poor Donne his silly spite at Yorkshire is something\r\nlike crushing a gnat for attacking the hide of a rhinoceros. Had I been\r\na gentleman, I believe I should have helped him off the premises by dint\r\nof physical force. I am glad now I only employed the moral weapon. But\r\nhe must come near me no more. I don\'t like him. He irritates me. There\r\nis not even amusement to be had out of him. Malone is better sport."\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if Malone wished to justify the preference, for the words\r\nwere scarcely out of the speaker\'s mouth when Peter Augustus came up,\r\nall in _grande tenue_, gloved and scented, with his hair oiled and\r\nbrushed to perfection, and bearing in one hand a huge bunch of\r\ncabbage-roses, five or six in full blow. These he presented to the\r\nheiress with a grace to which the most cunning pencil could do but\r\ndefective justice. And who, after this, could dare to say that Peter was\r\nnot a lady\'s man? He had gathered and he had given flowers; he had\r\noffered a sentimental, a poetic tribute at the shrine of Love or Mammon.\r\nHercules holding the distaff was but a faint type of Peter bearing the\r\nroses. He must have thought this himself, for he seemed amazed at what\r\nhe had done. He backed without a word; he was going away with a husky\r\nchuckle of self-satisfaction; then he bethought himself to stop and\r\nturn, to ascertain by ocular testimony that he really had presented a\r\nbouquet. Yes, there were the six red cabbages on the purple satin lap, a\r\nvery white hand, with some gold rings on the fingers, slightly holding\r\nthem together, and streaming ringlets, half hiding a laughing face,\r\ndrooped over them. Only _half_ hiding! Peter saw the laugh; it was\r\nunmistakable. He was made a joke of; his gallantry, his chivalry, were\r\nthe subject of a jest for a petticoat--for two petticoats: Miss Helstone\r\ntoo was smiling. Moreover, he felt he was seen through, and Peter grew\r\nblack as a thunder-cloud. When Shirley looked up, a fell eye was\r\nfastened on her. Malone, at least, had energy enough in hate. She saw it\r\nin his glance.\r\n\r\n"Peter _is_ worth a scene, and shall have it, if he likes, one day," she\r\nwhispered to her friend.\r\n\r\nAnd now--solemn and sombre as to their colour, though bland enough as to\r\ntheir faces--appeared at the dining-room door the three rectors. They\r\nhad hitherto been busy in the church, and were now coming to take some\r\nlittle refreshment for the body, ere the march commenced. The large\r\nmorocco-covered easy-chair had been left vacant for Dr. Boultby. He was\r\nput into it, and Caroline, obeying the instigations of Shirley, who told\r\nher now was the time to play the hostess, hastened to hand to her\r\nuncle\'s vast, revered, and, on the whole, worthy friend, a glass of\r\nwine and a plate of macaroons. Boultby\'s churchwardens, patrons of the\r\nSunday school both, as he insisted on their being, were already beside\r\nhim; Mrs. Sykes and the other ladies of his congregation were on his\r\nright hand and on his left, expressing their hopes that he was not\r\nfatigued, their fears that the day would be too warm for him. Mrs.\r\nBoultby, who held an opinion that when her lord dropped asleep after a\r\ngood dinner his face became as the face of an angel, was bending over\r\nhim, tenderly wiping some perspiration, real or imaginary, from his\r\nbrow. Boultby, in short, was in his glory, and in a round, sound _voix\r\nde poitrine_ he rumbled out thanks for attentions and assurances of his\r\ntolerable health. Of Caroline he took no manner of notice as she came\r\nnear, save to accept what she offered. He did not see her--he never did\r\nsee her; he hardly knew that such a person existed. He saw the\r\nmacaroons, however, and being fond of sweets, possessed himself of a\r\nsmall handful thereof. The wine Mrs. Boultby insisted on mingling with\r\nhot water, and qualifying with sugar and nutmeg.\r\n\r\nMr. Hall stood near an open window, breathing the fresh air and scent of\r\nflowers, and talking like a brother to Miss Ainley. To him Caroline\r\nturned her attention with pleasure. "What should she bring him? He must\r\nnot help himself--he must be served by her." And she provided herself\r\nwith a little salver, that she might offer him variety. Margaret Hall\r\njoined them; so did Miss Keeldar. The four ladies stood round their\r\nfavourite pastor. They also had an idea that they looked on the face of\r\nan earthly angel. Cyril Hall was their pope, infallible to them as Dr.\r\nThomas Boultby to his admirers. A throng, too, enclosed the rector of\r\nBriarfield--twenty or more pressed round him; and no parson was ever\r\nmore potent in a circle than old Helstone. The curates, herding together\r\nafter their manner, made a constellation of three lesser planets. Divers\r\nyoung ladies watched them afar off, but ventured not nigh.\r\n\r\nMr. Helstone produced his watch. "Ten minutes to two," he announced\r\naloud. "Time for all to fall into line. Come." He seized his shovel-hat\r\nand marched away. All rose and followed _en masse_.\r\n\r\nThe twelve hundred children were drawn up in three bodies of four\r\nhundred souls each; in the rear of each regiment was stationed a band;\r\nbetween every twenty there was an interval, wherein Helstone posted the\r\nteachers in pairs. To the van of the armies he summoned,--\r\n\r\n"Grace Boultby and Mary Sykes lead out Whinbury.\r\n\r\n"Margaret Hall and Mary Ann Ainley conduct Nunnely.\r\n\r\n"Caroline Helstone and Shirley Keeldar head Briarfield."\r\n\r\nThen again he gave command,--\r\n\r\n"Mr. Donne to Whinbury; Mr. Sweeting to Nunnely; Mr. Malone to\r\nBriarfield."\r\n\r\nAnd these gentlemen stepped up before the lady-generals.\r\n\r\nThe rectors passed to the full front; the parish clerks fell to the\r\nextreme rear. Helstone lifted his shovel-hat. In an instant out clashed\r\nthe eight bells in the tower, loud swelled the sounding bands, flute\r\nspoke and clarion answered, deep rolled the drums, and away they\r\nmarched.\r\n\r\nThe broad white road unrolled before the long procession, the sun and\r\nsky surveyed it cloudless, the wind tossed the tree boughs above it, and\r\nthe twelve hundred children and one hundred and forty adults of which it\r\nwas composed trod on in time and tune, with gay faces and glad hearts.\r\nIt was a joyous scene, and a scene to do good. It was a day of happiness\r\nfor rich and poor--the work, first of God, and then of the clergy. Let\r\nEngland\'s priests have their due. They are a faulty set in some\r\nrespects, being only of common flesh and blood like us all; but the land\r\nwould be badly off without them. Britain would miss her church, if that\r\nchurch fell. God save it! God also reform it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL FEAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot on combat bent, nor of foemen in search, was this priest-led and\r\nwoman-officered company; yet their music played martial tunes, and, to\r\njudge by the eyes and carriage of some--Miss Keeldar, for\r\ninstance--these sounds awoke, if not a martial, yet a longing spirit.\r\nOld Helstone, turning by chance, looked into her face; and he laughed,\r\nand she laughed at him.\r\n\r\n"There is no battle in prospect," he said; "our country does not want us\r\nto fight for it. No foe or tyrant is questioning or threatening our\r\nliberty. There is nothing to be done. We are only taking a walk. Keep\r\nyour hand on the reins, captain, and slack the fire of that spirit. It\r\nis not wanted, the more\'s the pity."\r\n\r\n"Take your own advice, doctor," was Shirley\'s response. To Caroline she\r\nmurmured, "I\'ll borrow of imagination what reality will not give me. We\r\nare not soldiers--bloodshed is not my desire--or if we are, we are\r\nsoldiers of the Cross. Time has rolled back some hundreds of years, and\r\nwe are bound on a pilgrimage to Palestine. But no; that is too\r\nvisionary. I need a sterner dream. We are Lowlanders of Scotland,\r\nfollowing a Covenanting captain up into the hills to hold a meeting out\r\nof the reach of persecuting troopers. We know that battle may follow\r\nprayer; and as we believe that in the worst issue of battle heaven must\r\nbe our reward, we are ready and willing to redden the peat-moss with our\r\nblood. That music stirs my soul; it wakens all my life; it makes my\r\nheart beat--not with its temperate daily pulse, but with a new,\r\nthrilling vigour. I almost long for danger--for a faith, a land, or at\r\nleast a lover to defend."\r\n\r\n"Look, Shirley!" interrupted Caroline. "What is that red speck above\r\nStilbro\' Brow? You have keener sight than I. Just turn your eagle eye to\r\nit."\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar looked. "I see," she said; then added presently, "there is\r\na line of red. They are soldiers--cavalry soldiers," she subjoined\r\nquickly. "They ride fast. There are six of them. They will pass us. No;\r\nthey have turned off to the right. They saw our procession, and avoid it\r\nby making a circuit. Where are they going?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they are only exercising their horses."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so. We see them no more now."\r\n\r\nMr. Helstone here spoke.\r\n\r\n"We shall pass through Royd Lane, to reach Nunnely Common by a short\r\ncut," said he.\r\n\r\nAnd into the straits of Royd Lane they accordingly defiled. It was very\r\nnarrow--so narrow that only two could walk abreast without falling into\r\nthe ditch which ran along each side. They had gained the middle of it,\r\nwhen excitement became obvious in the clerical commanders. Boultby\'s\r\nspectacles and Helstone\'s Rehoboam were agitated; the curates nudged\r\neach other; Mr. Hall turned to the ladies and smiled.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" was the demand.\r\n\r\nHe pointed with his staff to the end of the lane before them. Lo and\r\nbehold! another, an opposition, procession was there entering, headed\r\nalso by men in black, and followed also, as they could now hear, by\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n"Is it our double?" asked Shirley, "our manifold wraith? Here is a card\r\nturned up."\r\n\r\n"If you wanted a battle, you are likely to get one--at least of looks,"\r\nwhispered Caroline, laughing.\r\n\r\n"They shall not pass us!" cried the curates unanimously; "we\'ll not give\r\nway!"\r\n\r\n"Give way!" retorted Helstone sternly, turning round; "who talks of\r\ngiving way? You, boys, mind what you are about. The ladies, I know, will\r\nbe firm. I can trust them. There is not a churchwoman here but will\r\nstand her ground against these folks, for the honour of the\r\nEstablishment.--What does Miss Keeldar say?"\r\n\r\n"She asks what is it."\r\n\r\n"The Dissenting and Methodist schools, the Baptists, Independents, and\r\nWesleyans, joined in unholy alliance, and turning purposely into this\r\nlane with the intention of obstructing our march and driving us back."\r\n\r\n"Bad manners!" said Shirley, "and I hate bad manners. Of course, they\r\nmust have a lesson."\r\n\r\n"A lesson in politeness," suggested Mr. Hall, who was ever for peace;\r\n"not an example of rudeness."\r\n\r\nOld Helstone moved on. Quickening his step, he marched some yards in\r\nadvance of his company. He had nearly reached the other sable leaders,\r\nwhen he who appeared to act as the hostile commander-in-chief--a large,\r\ngreasy man, with black hair combed flat on his forehead--called a halt.\r\nThe procession paused. He drew forth a hymn book, gave out a verse, set\r\na tune, and they all struck up the most dolorous of canticles.\r\n\r\nHelstone signed to his bands. They clashed out with all the power of\r\nbrass. He desired them to play "Rule, Britannia!" and ordered the\r\nchildren to join in vocally, which they did with enthusiastic spirit.\r\nThe enemy was sung and stormed down, his psalm quelled. As far as noise\r\nwent, he was conquered.\r\n\r\n"Now, follow me!" exclaimed Helstone; "not at a run, but at a firm,\r\nsmart pace. Be steady, every child and woman of you. Keep together. Hold\r\non by each other\'s skirts, if necessary."\r\n\r\nAnd he strode on with such a determined and deliberate gait, and was,\r\nbesides, so well seconded by his scholars and teachers, who did exactly\r\nas he told them, neither running nor faltering, but marching with cool,\r\nsolid impetus--the curates, too, being compelled to do the same, as they\r\nwere between two fires, Helstone and Miss Keeldar, both of whom watched\r\nany deviation with lynx-eyed vigilance, and were ready, the one with his\r\ncane, the other with her parasol, to rebuke the slightest breach of\r\norders, the least independent or irregular demonstration--that the body\r\nof Dissenters were first amazed, then alarmed, then borne down and\r\npressed back, and at last forced to turn tail and leave the outlet from\r\nRoyd Lane free. Boultby suffered in the onslaught, but Helstone and\r\nMalone, between them, held him up, and brought him through the business,\r\nwhole in limb, though sorely tried in wind.\r\n\r\nThe fat Dissenter who had given out the hymn was left sitting in the\r\nditch. He was a spirit merchant by trade, a leader of the\r\nNonconformists, and, it was said, drank more water in that one afternoon\r\nthan he had swallowed for a twelvemonth before. Mr. Hall had taken care\r\nof Caroline, and Caroline of him. He and Miss Ainley made their own\r\nquiet comments to each other afterwards on the incident. Miss Keeldar\r\nand Mr. Helstone shook hands heartily when they had fairly got the whole\r\nparty through the lane. The curates began to exult, but Mr. Helstone\r\npresently put the curb on their innocent spirits. He remarked that they\r\nnever had sense to know what to say, and had better hold their tongues;\r\nand he reminded them that the business was none of their managing.\r\n\r\nAbout half-past three the procession turned back, and at four once more\r\nregained the starting-place. Long lines of benches were arranged in the\r\nclose-shorn fields round the school. There the children were seated, and\r\nhuge baskets, covered up with white cloths, and great smoking tin\r\nvessels were brought out. Ere the distribution of good things commenced,\r\na brief grace was pronounced by Mr. Hall and sung by the children. Their\r\nyoung voices sounded melodious, even touching, in the open air. Large\r\ncurrant buns and hot, well-sweetened tea were then administered in the\r\nproper spirit of liberality. No stinting was permitted on this day, at\r\nleast; the rule for each child\'s allowance being that it was to have\r\nabout twice as much as it could possibly eat, thus leaving a reserve to\r\nbe carried home for such as age, sickness, or other impediment prevented\r\nfrom coming to the feast. Buns and beer circulated, meantime, amongst\r\nthe musicians and church-singers; afterwards the benches were removed,\r\nand they were left to unbend their spirits in licensed play.\r\n\r\nA bell summoned the teachers, patrons, and patronesses to the\r\nschoolroom. Miss Keeldar, Miss Helstone, and many other ladies were\r\nalready there, glancing over the arrangement of their separate trays and\r\ntables. Most of the female servants of the neighbourhood, together with\r\nthe clerks\', the singers\', and the musicians\' wives, had been pressed\r\ninto the service of the day as waiters. Each vied with the other in\r\nsmartness and daintiness of dress, and many handsome forms were seen\r\namongst the younger ones. About half a score were cutting bread and\r\nbutter, another half-score supplying hot water, brought from the coppers\r\nof the rector\'s kitchen. The profusion of flowers and evergreens\r\ndecorating the white walls, the show of silver teapots and bright\r\nporcelain on the tables, the active figures, blithe faces, gay dresses\r\nflitting about everywhere, formed altogether a refreshing and lively\r\nspectacle. Everybody talked, not very loudly, but merrily, and the\r\ncanary birds sang shrill in their high-hung cages.\r\n\r\nCaroline, as the rector\'s niece, took her place at one of the three\r\nfirst tables; Mrs. Boultby and Margaret Hall officiated at the others.\r\nAt these tables the _\xc3\xa9lite_ of the company were to be entertained,\r\nstrict rules of equality not being more in fashion at Briarfield than\r\nelsewhere. Miss Helstone removed her bonnet and scarf, that she might be\r\nless oppressed with the heat. Her long curls, falling on her neck,\r\nserved almost in place of a veil; and for the rest, her muslin dress was\r\nfashioned modestly as a nun\'s robe, enabling her thus to dispense with\r\nthe encumbrance of a shawl.\r\n\r\nThe room was filling. Mr. Hall had taken his post beside Caroline, who\r\nnow, as she rearranged the cups and spoons before her, whispered to him\r\nin a low voice remarks on the events of the day. He looked a little\r\ngrave about what had taken place in Royd Lane, and she tried to smile\r\nhim out of his seriousness. Miss Keeldar sat near--for a wonder, neither\r\nlaughing nor talking; on the contrary, very still, and gazing round her\r\nvigilantly. She seemed afraid lest some intruder should take a seat she\r\napparently wished to reserve next her own. Ever and anon she spread her\r\nsatin dress over an undue portion of the bench, or laid her gloves or\r\nher embroidered handkerchief upon it. Caroline noticed this _man\xc3\xa8ge_ at\r\nlast, and asked her what friend she expected. Shirley bent towards her,\r\nalmost touched her ear with her rosy lips, and whispered with a musical\r\nsoftness that often characterized her tones when what she said tended\r\neven remotely to stir some sweet secret source of feeling in her heart,\r\n"I expect Mr. Moore. I saw him last night, and I made him promise to\r\ncome with his sister, and to sit at our table. He won\'t fail me, I feel\r\ncertain; but I apprehend his coming too late, and being separated from\r\nus. Here is a fresh batch arriving; every place will be taken.\r\nProvoking!"\r\n\r\nIn fact, Mr. Wynne the magistrate, his wife, his son, and his two\r\ndaughters now entered in high state. They were Briarfield gentry. Of\r\ncourse their place was at the first table, and being conducted thither,\r\nthey filled up the whole remaining space. For Miss Keeldar\'s comfort,\r\nMr. Sam Wynne inducted himself into the very vacancy she had kept for\r\nMoore, planting himself solidly on her gown, her gloves, and her\r\nhandkerchief. Mr. Sam was one of the objects of her aversion, and the\r\nmore so because he showed serious symptoms of an aim at her hand. The\r\nold gentleman, too, had publicly declared that the Fieldhead estate and\r\nthe De Walden estate were delightfully _contagious_--a malapropism which\r\nrumour had not failed to repeat to Shirley.\r\n\r\nCaroline\'s ears yet rung with that thrilling whisper, "I expect Mr.\r\nMoore," her heart yet beat and her cheek yet glowed with it, when a note\r\nfrom the organ pealed above the confused hum of the place. Dr. Boultby,\r\nMr. Helstone, and Mr. Hall rose, so did all present, and grace was sung\r\nto the accompaniment of the music; and then tea began. She was kept too\r\nbusy with her office for a while to have leisure for looking round, but\r\nthe last cup being filled, she threw a restless glance over the room.\r\nThere were some ladies and several gentlemen standing about yet\r\nunaccommodated with seats. Amidst a group she recognized her spinster\r\nfriend, Miss Mann, whom the fine weather had tempted, or some urgent\r\nfriend had persuaded, to leave her drear solitude for one hour of social\r\nenjoyment. Miss Mann looked tired of standing; a lady in a yellow bonnet\r\nbrought her a chair. Caroline knew well that _chapeau en satin jaune_;\r\nshe knew the black hair, and the kindly though rather opinionated and\r\nfroward-looking face under it; she knew that _robe de soie noire_, she\r\nknew even that _schall gris de lin_; she knew, in short, Hortense Moore,\r\nand she wanted to jump up and run to her and kiss her--to give her one\r\nembrace for her own sake and two for her brother\'s. She half rose,\r\nindeed, with a smothered exclamation, and perhaps--for the impulse was\r\nvery strong--she would have run across the room and actually saluted\r\nher; but a hand replaced her in her seat, and a voice behind her\r\nwhispered, "Wait till after tea, Lina, and then I\'ll bring her to you."\r\n\r\nAnd when she _could_ look up she did, and there was Robert himself close\r\nbehind, smiling at her eagerness, looking better than she had ever seen\r\nhim look--looking, indeed, to her partial eyes, so very handsome that\r\nshe dared not trust herself to hazard a second glance; for his image\r\nstruck on her vision with painful brightness, and pictured itself on her\r\nmemory as vividly as if there daguerreotyped by a pencil of keen\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nHe moved on, and spoke to Miss Keeldar. Shirley, irritated by some\r\nunwelcome attentions from Sam Wynne, and by the fact of that gentleman\r\nbeing still seated on her gloves and handkerchief--and probably, also,\r\nby Moore\'s want of punctuality--was by no means in good humour. She\r\nfirst shrugged her shoulders at him, and then she said a bitter word or\r\ntwo about his "insupportable tardiness." Moore neither apologized nor\r\nretorted. He stood near her quietly, as if waiting to see whether she\r\nwould recover her temper; which she did in little more than three\r\nminutes, indicating the change by offering him her hand. Moore took it\r\nwith a smile, half-corrective, half-grateful. The slightest possible\r\nshake of the head delicately marked the former quality; it is probable a\r\ngentle pressure indicated the latter.\r\n\r\n"You may sit where you can now, Mr. Moore," said Shirley, also smiling.\r\n"You see there is not an inch of room for you here; but I discern plenty\r\nof space at Mrs. Boultby\'s table, between Miss Armitage and Miss\r\nBirtwhistle. Go! John Sykes will be your _vis-\xc3\xa0-vis_, and you will sit\r\nwith your back towards us."\r\n\r\nMoore, however, preferred lingering about where he was. He now and then\r\ntook a turn down the long room, pausing in his walk to interchange\r\ngreetings with other gentlemen in his own placeless predicament; but\r\nstill he came back to the magnet, Shirley, bringing with him, each time\r\nhe returned, observations it was necessary to whisper in her ear.\r\n\r\nMeantime poor Sam Wynne looked far from comfortable. His fair neighbour,\r\njudging from her movements, appeared in a mood the most unquiet and\r\nunaccommodating. She would not sit still two seconds. She was hot; she\r\nfanned herself; complained of want of air and space. She remarked that,\r\nin her opinion, when people had finished their tea they ought to leave\r\nthe tables, and announced distinctly that she expected to faint if the\r\npresent state of things continued. Mr. Sam offered to accompany her into\r\nthe open air; just the way to give her her death of cold, she alleged.\r\nIn short, his post became untenable; and having swallowed his quantum of\r\ntea, he judged it expedient to evacuate.\r\n\r\nMoore should have been at hand, whereas he was quite at the other\r\nextremity of the room, deep in conference with Christopher Sykes. A\r\nlarge corn-factor, Timothy Ramsden, Esq., happened to be nearer; and\r\nfeeling himself tired of standing, he advanced to fill the vacant seat.\r\nShirley\'s expedients did not fail her. A sweep of her scarf upset her\r\nteacup: its contents were shared between the bench and her own satin\r\ndress. Of course, it became necessary to call a waiter to remedy the\r\nmischief. Mr. Ramsden, a stout, puffy gentleman, as large in person as\r\nhe was in property, held aloof from the consequent commotion. Shirley,\r\nusually almost culpably indifferent to slight accidents affecting dress,\r\netc., now made a commotion that might have become the most delicate and\r\nnervous of her sex. Mr. Ramsden opened his mouth, withdrew slowly, and,\r\nas Miss Keeldar again intimated her intention to "give way" and swoon on\r\nthe spot, he turned on his heel, and beat a heavy retreat.\r\n\r\nMoore at last returned. Calmly surveying the bustle, and somewhat\r\nquizzically scanning Shirley\'s enigmatical-looking countenance, he\r\nremarked that in truth this was the hottest end of the room, that he\r\nfound a climate there calculated to agree with none but cool\r\ntemperaments like his own; and putting the waiters, the napkins, the\r\nsatin robe--the whole turmoil, in short--to one side, he installed\r\nhimself where destiny evidently decreed he should sit. Shirley subsided;\r\nher features altered their lines; the raised knit brow and inexplicable\r\ncurve of the mouth became straight again; wilfulness and roguery gave\r\nplace to other expressions; and all the angular movements with which she\r\nhad vexed the soul of Sam Wynne were conjured to rest as by a charm.\r\nStill no gracious glance was cast on Moore. On the contrary, he was\r\naccused of giving her a world of trouble, and roundly charged with being\r\nthe cause of depriving her of the esteem of Mr. Ramsden and the\r\ninvaluable friendship of Mr. Samuel Wynne.\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t have offended either gentleman for the world," she averred. "I\r\nhave always been accustomed to treat both with the most respectful\r\nconsideration, and there, owing to you, how they have been used! I shall\r\nnot be happy till I have made it up. I never am happy till I am friends\r\nwith my neighbours. So to-morrow I must make a pilgrimage to Royd\r\ncorn-mill, soothe the miller, and praise the grain; and next day I must\r\ncall at De Walden--where I hate to go--and carry in my reticule half an\r\noatcake to give to Mr. Sam\'s favourite pointers."\r\n\r\n"You know the surest path to the heart of each swain, I doubt not," said\r\nMoore quietly. He looked very content to have at last secured his\r\npresent place; but he made no fine speech expressive of gratification,\r\nand offered no apology for the trouble he had given. His phlegm became\r\nhim wonderfully. It made him look handsomer, he was so composed; it made\r\nhis vicinage pleasant, it was so peace-restoring. You would not have\r\nthought, to look at him, that he was a poor, struggling man seated\r\nbeside a rich woman; the calm of equality stilled his aspect; perhaps\r\nthat calm, too, reigned in his soul. Now and then, from the way in which\r\nhe looked down on Miss Keeldar as he addressed her, you would have\r\nfancied his station towered above hers as much as his stature did.\r\nAlmost stern lights sometimes crossed his brow and gleamed in his eyes.\r\nTheir conversation had become animated, though it was confined to a low\r\nkey; she was urging him with questions--evidently he refused to her\r\ncuriosity all the gratification it demanded. She sought his eye once\r\nwith hers. You read, in its soft yet eager expression, that it solicited\r\nclearer replies. Moore smiled pleasantly, but his lips continued sealed.\r\nThen she was piqued, and turned away; but he recalled her attention in\r\ntwo minutes. He seemed making promises, which he soothed her into\r\naccepting in lieu of information.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that the heat of the room did not suit Miss Helstone. She\r\ngrew paler and paler as the process of tea-making was protracted. The\r\nmoment thanks were returned she quitted the table, and hastened to\r\nfollow her cousin Hortense, who, with Miss Mann, had already sought the\r\nopen air. Robert Moore had risen when she did--perhaps he meant to speak\r\nto her; but there was yet a parting word to exchange with Miss Keeldar,\r\nand while it was being uttered Caroline had vanished.\r\n\r\nHortense received her former pupil with a demeanour of more dignity than\r\nwarmth. She had been seriously offended by Mr. Helstone\'s proceedings,\r\nand had all along considered Caroline to blame in obeying her uncle too\r\nliterally.\r\n\r\n"You are a very great stranger," she said austerely, as her pupil held\r\nand pressed her hand. The pupil knew her too well to remonstrate or\r\ncomplain of coldness. She let the punctilious whim pass, sure that her\r\nnatural _bont\xc3\xa9_ (I use this French word because it expresses just what I\r\nmean--neither goodness nor good-nature, but something between the two)\r\nwould presently get the upper hand. It did. Hortense had no sooner\r\nexamined her face well, and observed the change its somewhat wasted\r\nfeatures betrayed, than her mien softened. Kissing her on both cheeks,\r\nshe asked anxiously after her health. Caroline answered gaily. It would,\r\nhowever, have been her lot to undergo a long cross-examination, followed\r\nby an endless lecture on this head, had not Miss Mann called off the\r\nattention of the questioner by requesting to be conducted home. The poor\r\ninvalid was already fatigued. Her weariness made her cross--too cross\r\nalmost to speak to Caroline; and besides, that young person\'s white\r\ndress and lively look were displeasing in the eyes of Miss Mann. The\r\neveryday garb of brown stuff or gray gingham, and the everyday air of\r\nmelancholy, suited the solitary spinster better; she would hardly know\r\nher young friend to-night, and quitted her with a cool nod. Hortense\r\nhaving promised to accompany her home, they departed together.\r\n\r\nCaroline now looked round for Shirley. She saw the rainbow scarf and\r\npurple dress in the centre of a throng of ladies, all well known to\r\nherself, but all of the order whom she systematically avoided whenever\r\navoidance was possible. Shyer at some moments than at others, she felt\r\njust now no courage at all to join this company. She could not, however,\r\nstand alone where all others went in pairs or parties; so she approached\r\na group of her own scholars, great girls, or rather young women, who\r\nwere standing watching some hundreds of the younger children playing at\r\nblind-man\'s buff.\r\n\r\nMiss Helstone knew these girls liked her, yet she was shy even with them\r\nout of school. They were not more in awe of her than she of them. She\r\ndrew near them now, rather to find protection in their company than to\r\npatronize them with her presence. By some instinct they knew her\r\nweakness, and with natural politeness they respected it. Her knowledge\r\ncommanded their esteem when she taught them; her gentleness attracted\r\ntheir regard; and because she was what they considered wise and good\r\nwhen _on_ duty, they kindly overlooked her evident timidity when off.\r\nThey did not take advantage of it. Peasant girls as they were, they had\r\ntoo much of our own English sensibility to be guilty of the coarse\r\nerror. They stood round her still, civil, friendly, receiving her slight\r\nsmiles and rather hurried efforts to converse with a good feeling and\r\ngood breeding--the last quality being the result of the first--which\r\nsoon set her at her ease.\r\n\r\nMr. Sam Wynne coming up with great haste, to insist on the elder girls\r\njoining in the game as well as the younger ones, Caroline was again left\r\nalone. She was meditating a quiet retreat to the house, when Shirley,\r\nperceiving from afar her isolation, hastened to her side.\r\n\r\n"Let us go to the top of the fields," she said. "I know you don\'t like\r\ncrowds, Caroline."\r\n\r\n"But it will be depriving you of a pleasure, Shirley, to take you from\r\nall these fine people, who court your society so assiduously, and to\r\nwhom you can, without art or effort, make yourself so pleasant."\r\n\r\n"Not quite without effort; I am already tired of the exertion. It is but\r\ninsipid, barren work, talking and laughing with the good gentlefolks of\r\nBriarfield. I have been looking out for your white dress for the last\r\nten minutes. I like to watch those I love in a crowd, and to compare\r\nthem with others. I have thus compared you. You resemble none of the\r\nrest, Lina. There are some prettier faces than yours here. You are not a\r\nmodel beauty like Harriet Sykes, for instance--beside her your person\r\nappears almost insignificant--but you look agreeable, you look\r\nreflective, you look what I call interesting."\r\n\r\n"Hush, Shirley! you flatter me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wonder that your scholars like you."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Shirley! Talk of something else."\r\n\r\n"We will talk of Moore, then, and we will watch him. I see him even\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"Where?" And as Caroline asked the question she looked not over the\r\nfields, but into Miss Keeldar\'s eyes, as was her wont whenever Shirley\r\nmentioned any object she descried afar. Her friend had quicker vision\r\nthan herself, and Caroline seemed to think that the secret of her eagle\r\nacuteness might be read in her dark gray irides, or rather, perhaps, she\r\nonly sought guidance by the direction of those discriminating and\r\nbrilliant spheres.\r\n\r\n"There is Moore," said Shirley, pointing right across the wide field\r\nwhere a thousand children were playing, and now nearly a thousand adult\r\nspectators walking about. "There--can you miss the tall stature and\r\nstraight port? He looks amidst the set that surround him like Eliab\r\namongst humbler shepherds--like Saul in a war-council; and a war-council\r\nit is, if I am not mistaken."\r\n\r\n"Why so, Shirley?" asked Caroline, whose eye had at last caught the\r\nobject it sought. "Robert is just now speaking to my uncle, and they are\r\nshaking hands. They are then reconciled."\r\n\r\n"Reconciled not without good reason, depend on it--making common cause\r\nagainst some common foe. And why, think you, are Messrs. Wynne and\r\nSykes, and Armitage and Ramsden, gathered in such a close circle round\r\nthem? And why is Malone beckoned to join them? Where _he_ is summoned,\r\nbe sure a strong arm is needed."\r\n\r\nShirley, as she watched, grew restless; her eyes flashed.\r\n\r\n"They won\'t trust me," she said. "That is always the way when it comes\r\nto the point."\r\n\r\n"What about?"\r\n\r\n"Cannot you feel? There is some mystery afloat; some event is expected;\r\nsome preparation is to be made, I am certain. I saw it all in Mr.\r\nMoore\'s manner this evening. He was excited, yet hard."\r\n\r\n"Hard to _you_, Shirley?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to _me_. He often is hard to me. We seldom converse _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_\r\nbut I am made to feel that the basis of his character is not of eider\r\ndown."\r\n\r\n"Yet he seemed to talk to you softly."\r\n\r\n"Did he not? Very gentle tones and quiet manner. Yet the man is\r\nperemptory and secret: his secrecy vexes me."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Robert is secret."\r\n\r\n"Which he has scarcely a right to be with me, especially as he commenced\r\nby giving me his confidence. Having done nothing to forfeit that\r\nconfidence, it ought not to be withdrawn; but I suppose I am not\r\nconsidered iron-souled enough to be trusted in a crisis."\r\n\r\n"He fears, probably, to occasion you uneasiness."\r\n\r\n"An unnecessary precaution. I am of elastic materials, not soon crushed.\r\nHe ought to know that. But the man is proud. He has his faults, say what\r\nyou will, Lina. Observe how engaged that group appear. They do not know\r\nwe are watching them."\r\n\r\n"If we keep on the alert, Shirley, we shall perhaps find the clue to\r\ntheir secret."\r\n\r\n"There will be some unusual movements ere long--perhaps to-morrow,\r\npossibly to-night. But my eyes and ears are wide open. Mr. Moore, you\r\nshall be under surveillance. Be you vigilant also, Lina."\r\n\r\n"I will. Robert is going; I saw him turn. I believe he noticed us. They\r\nare shaking hands."\r\n\r\n"Shaking hands, with emphasis," added Shirley, "as if they were\r\nratifying some solemn league and covenant."\r\n\r\nThey saw Robert quit the group, pass through a gate, and disappear.\r\n\r\n"And he has not bid us good-bye," murmured Caroline.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the words escaped her lips when she tried by a smile to\r\ndeny the confession of disappointment they seemed to imply. An unbidden\r\nsuffusion for one moment both softened and brightened her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that is soon remedied!" exclaimed Shirley: "we\'ll _make_ him bid us\r\ngood-bye."\r\n\r\n"_Make_ him! That is not the same thing," was the answer.\r\n\r\n"It _shall_ be the same thing."\r\n\r\n"But he is gone; you can\'t overtake him."\r\n\r\n"I know a shorter way than that he has taken. We will intercept him."\r\n\r\n"But, Shirley, I would rather not go."\r\n\r\nCaroline said this as Miss Keeldar seized her arm and hurried her down\r\nthe fields. It was vain to contend. Nothing was so wilful as Shirley\r\nwhen she took a whim into her head. Caroline found herself out of sight\r\nof the crowd almost before she was aware, and ushered into a narrow\r\nshady spot, embowered above with hawthorns, and enamelled under foot\r\nwith daisies. She took no notice of the evening sun chequering the turf,\r\nnor was she sensible of the pure incense exhaling at this hour from tree\r\nand plant; she only heard the wicket opening at one end, and knew Robert\r\nwas approaching. The long sprays of the hawthorns, shooting out before\r\nthem, served as a screen. They saw him before he observed them. At a\r\nglance Caroline perceived that his social hilarity was gone; he had left\r\nit behind him in the joy-echoing fields round the school. What remained\r\nnow was his dark, quiet, business countenance. As Shirley had said, a\r\ncertain hardness characterized his air, while his eye was excited, but\r\naustere. So much the worse timed was the present freak of Shirley\'s. If\r\nhe had looked disposed for holiday mirth, it would not have mattered\r\nmuch; but now----\r\n\r\n"I told you not to come," said Caroline, somewhat bitterly, to her\r\nfriend. She seemed truly perturbed. To be intruded on Robert thus,\r\nagainst her will and his expectation, and when he evidently would rather\r\nnot be delayed, keenly annoyed her. It did not annoy Miss Keeldar in the\r\nleast. She stepped forward and faced her tenant, barring his way. "You\r\nomitted to bid us good-bye," she said.\r\n\r\n"Omitted to bid you good-bye! Where did you come from? Are you fairies?\r\nI left two like you, one in purple and one in white, standing at the top\r\nof a bank, four fields off, but a minute ago."\r\n\r\n"You left us there and find us here. We have been watching you, and\r\nshall watch you still. You must be questioned one day, but not now. At\r\npresent all you have to do is to say good-night, and then pass."\r\n\r\nMoore glanced from one to the other without unbending his aspect. "Days\r\nof f\xc3\xaate have their privileges, and so have days of hazard," observed he\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n"Come, don\'t moralize. Say good-night, and pass," urged Shirley.\r\n\r\n"Must I say good-night to you, Miss Keeldar?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and to Caroline likewise. It is nothing new, I hope. You have bid\r\nus both good-night before."\r\n\r\nHe took her hand, held it in one of his, and covered it with the other.\r\nHe looked down at her gravely, kindly, yet commandingly. The heiress\r\ncould not make this man her subject. In his gaze on her bright face\r\nthere was no servility, hardly homage; but there were interest and\r\naffection, heightened by another feeling. Something in his tone when he\r\nspoke, as well as in his words, marked that last sentiment to be\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\n"Your debtor bids you good-night! May you rest safely and serenely till\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"And you, Mr. Moore--what are you going to do? What have you been saying\r\nto Mr. Helstone, with whom I saw you shake hands? Why did all those\r\ngentlemen gather round you? Put away reserve for once. Be frank with\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Who can resist you? I will be frank. To-morrow, if there is anything to\r\nrelate, you shall hear it."\r\n\r\n"Just now," pleaded Shirley; "don\'t procrastinate."\r\n\r\n"But I could only tell half a tale. And my time is limited; I have not a\r\nmoment to spare. Hereafter I will make amends for delay by candour."\r\n\r\n"But are you going home?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Not to leave it any more to-night?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. At present, farewell to both of you."\r\n\r\nHe would have taken Caroline\'s hand and joined it in the same clasp in\r\nwhich he held Shirley\'s, but somehow it was not ready for him. She had\r\nwithdrawn a few steps apart. Her answer to Moore\'s adieu was only a\r\nslight bend of the head and a gentle, serious smile. He sought no more\r\ncordial token. Again he said "Farewell," and quitted them both.\r\n\r\n"There! it is over," said Shirley when he was gone. "We have made him\r\nbid us good-night, and yet not lost ground in his esteem, I think,\r\nCary."\r\n\r\n"I hope not," was the brief reply.\r\n\r\n"I consider you very timid and undemonstrative," remarked Miss Keeldar.\r\n"Why did you not give Moore your hand when he offered you his? He is\r\nyour cousin; you like him. Are you ashamed to let him perceive your\r\naffection?"\r\n\r\n"He perceives all of it that interests him. No need to make a display of\r\nfeeling."\r\n\r\n"You are laconic; you would be stoical if you could. Is love, in your\r\neyes, a crime, Caroline?"\r\n\r\n"Love a crime! No, Shirley; love is a divine virtue. But why drag that\r\nword into the conversation? It is singularly irrelevant."\r\n\r\n"Good!" pronounced Shirley.\r\n\r\nThe two girls paced the green lane in silence. Caroline first resumed.\r\n\r\n"Obtrusiveness is a crime, forwardness is a crime, and both disgust; but\r\nlove! no purest angel need blush to love. And when I see or hear either\r\nman or woman couple shame with love, I know their minds are coarse,\r\ntheir associations debased. Many who think themselves refined ladies and\r\ngentlemen, and on whose lips the word \'vulgarity\' is for ever hovering,\r\ncannot mention \'love\' without betraying their own innate and imbecile\r\ndegradation. It is a low feeling in their estimation, connected only\r\nwith low ideas for them."\r\n\r\n"You describe three-fourths of the world, Caroline."\r\n\r\n"They are cold--they are cowardly--they are stupid on the subject,\r\nShirley! They never loved--they never were loved!"\r\n\r\n"Thou art right, Lina. And in their dense ignorance they blaspheme\r\nliving fire, seraph-brought from a divine altar."\r\n\r\n"They confound it with sparks mounting from Tophet."\r\n\r\nThe sudden and joyous clash of bells here stopped the dialogue by\r\nsummoning all to the church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nWHICH THE GENTEEL READER IS RECOMMENDED TO SKIP, LOW PERSONS BEING HERE\r\nINTRODUCED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evening was still and warm; close and sultry it even promised to\r\nbecome. Round the descending sun the clouds glowed purple; summer tints,\r\nrather Indian than English, suffused the horizon, and cast rosy\r\nreflections on hillside, house-front, tree-bole, on winding road and\r\nundulating pasture-ground. The two girls came down from the fields\r\nslowly. By the time they reached the churchyard the bells were hushed;\r\nthe multitudes were gathered into the church. The whole scene was\r\nsolitary.\r\n\r\n"How pleasant and calm it is!" said Caroline.\r\n\r\n"And how hot it will be in the church!" responded Shirley. "And what a\r\ndreary long speech Dr. Boultby will make! And how the curates will\r\nhammer over their prepared orations! For my part, I would rather not\r\nenter."\r\n\r\n"But my uncle will be angry if he observes our absence."\r\n\r\n"I will bear the brunt of his wrath; he will not devour me. I shall be\r\nsorry to miss his pungent speech. I know it will be all sense for the\r\nchurch, and all causticity for schism. He\'ll not forget the battle of\r\nRoyd Lane. I shall be sorry also to deprive you of Mr. Hall\'s sincere\r\nfriendly homily, with all its racy Yorkshireisms; but here I must stay.\r\nThe gray church and grayer tombs look divine with this crimson gleam on\r\nthem. Nature is now at her evening prayers; she is kneeling before those\r\nred hills. I see her prostrate on the great steps of her altar, praying\r\nfor a fair night for mariners at sea, for travellers in deserts, for\r\nlambs on moors, and unfledged birds in woods. Caroline, I see her, and I\r\nwill tell you what she is like. She is like what Eve was when she and\r\nAdam stood alone on earth."\r\n\r\n"And that is not Milton\'s Eve, Shirley."\r\n\r\n"Milton\'s Eve! Milton\'s Eve! I repeat. No, by the pure Mother of God,\r\nshe is not! Cary, we are alone; we may speak what we think. Milton was\r\ngreat; but was he good? His brain was right; how was his heart? He saw\r\nheaven; he looked down on hell. He saw Satan, and Sin his daughter, and\r\nDeath their horrible offspring. Angels serried before him their\r\nbattalions; the long lines of adamantine shields flashed back on his\r\nblind eyeballs the unutterable splendour of heaven. Devils gathered\r\ntheir legions in his sight; their dim, discrowned, and tarnished armies\r\npassed rank and file before him. Milton tried to see the first woman;\r\nbut, Cary, he saw her not."\r\n\r\n"You are bold to say so, Shirley."\r\n\r\n"Not more bold than faithful. It was his cook that he saw; or it was\r\nMrs. Gill, as I have seen her, making custards, in the heat of summer,\r\nin the cool dairy, with rose-trees and nasturtiums about the latticed\r\nwindow, preparing a cold collation for the rectors--preserves and\r\n\'dulcet creams;\' puzzled \'what choice to choose for delicacy best; what\r\norder so contrived as not to mix tastes, not well-joined, inelegant, but\r\nbring taste after taste, upheld with kindliest change.\'"\r\n\r\n"All very well too, Shirley."\r\n\r\n"I would beg to remind him that the first men of the earth were Titans,\r\nand that Eve was their mother; from her sprang Saturn, Hyperion,\r\nOceanus; she bore Prometheus----"\r\n\r\n"Pagan that you are! what does that signify?"\r\n\r\n"I say, there were giants on the earth in those days--giants that strove\r\nto scale heaven. The first woman\'s breast that heaved with life on this\r\nworld yielded the daring which could contend with Omnipotence, the\r\nstrength which could bear a thousand years of bondage, the vitality\r\nwhich could feed that vulture death through uncounted ages, the\r\nunexhausted life and uncorrupted excellence, sisters to immortality,\r\nwhich, after millenniums of crimes, struggles, and woes, could conceive\r\nand bring forth a Messiah. The first woman was heaven-born. Vast was the\r\nheart whence gushed the well-spring of the blood of nations, and grand\r\nthe undegenerate head where rested the consort-crown of creation."\r\n\r\n"She coveted an apple, and was cheated by a snake; but you have got such\r\na hash of Scripture and mythology into your head that there is no making\r\nany sense of you. You have not yet told me what you saw kneeling on\r\nthose hills."\r\n\r\n"I saw--I now see--a woman-Titan. Her robe of blue air spreads to the\r\noutskirts of the heath, where yonder flock is grazing; a veil white as\r\nan avalanche sweeps from her head to her feet, and arabesques of\r\nlightning flame on its borders. Under her breast I see her zone, purple\r\nlike that horizon; through its blush shines the star of evening. Her\r\nsteady eyes I cannot picture. They are clear, they are deep as lakes,\r\nthey are lifted and full of worship, they tremble with the softness of\r\nlove and the lustre of prayer. Her forehead has the expanse of a cloud,\r\nand is paler than the early moon, risen long before dark gathers. She\r\nreclines her bosom on the ridge of Stilbro\' Moor; her mighty hands are\r\njoined beneath it. So kneeling, face to face she speaks with God. That\r\nEve is Jehovah\'s daughter, as Adam was His son."\r\n\r\n"She is very vague and visionary. Come, Shirley, we ought to go into\r\nchurch."\r\n\r\n"Caroline, I will not; I will stay out here with my mother Eve, in these\r\ndays called Nature. I love her--undying, mighty being! Heaven may have\r\nfaded from her brow when she fell in paradise, but all that is glorious\r\non earth shines there still. She is taking me to her bosom, and showing\r\nme her heart. Hush, Caroline! You will see her and feel as I do, if we\r\nare both silent."\r\n\r\n"I will humour your whim; but you will begin talking again ere ten\r\nminutes are over."\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar, on whom the soft excitement of the warm summer evening\r\nseemed working with unwonted power, leaned against an upright headstone;\r\nshe fixed her eyes on the deep-burning west, and sank into a pleasurable\r\ntrance. Caroline, going a little apart, paced to and fro beneath the\r\nrectory garden wall, dreaming too in her way. Shirley had mentioned the\r\nword "mother." That word suggested to Caroline\'s imagination not the\r\nmighty and mystical parent of Shirley\'s visions, but a gentle human\r\nform--the form she ascribed to her own mother, unknown, unloved, but not\r\nunlonged for.\r\n\r\n"Oh that the day would come when she would remember her child! Oh that I\r\nmight know her, and knowing, love her!"\r\n\r\nSuch was her aspiration.\r\n\r\nThe longing of her childhood filled her soul again. The desire which\r\nmany a night had kept her awake in her crib, and which fear of its\r\nfallacy had of late years almost extinguished, relit suddenly, and\r\nglowed warm in her heart, that her mother might come some happy day,\r\nand send for her to her presence, look upon her fondly with loving eyes,\r\nand say to her tenderly, in a sweet voice, "Caroline, my child, I have a\r\nhome for you; you shall live with me. All the love you have needed, and\r\nnot tasted, from infancy, I have saved for you carefully. Come; it shall\r\ncherish you now."\r\n\r\nA noise on the road roused Caroline from her filial hopes, and Shirley\r\nfrom her Titan visions. They listened, and heard the tramp of horses.\r\nThey looked, and saw a glitter through the trees. They caught through\r\nthe foliage glimpses of martial scarlet; helm shone, plume waved. Silent\r\nand orderly, six soldiers rode softly by.\r\n\r\n"The same we saw this afternoon," whispered Shirley. "They have been\r\nhalting somewhere till now. They wish to be as little noticed as\r\npossible, and are seeking their rendezvous at this quiet hour, while the\r\npeople are at church. Did I not say we should see unusual things ere\r\nlong?"\r\n\r\nScarcely were sight and sound of the soldiers lost, when another and\r\nsomewhat different disturbance broke the night-hush--a child\'s impatient\r\nscream. They looked. A man issued from the church, carrying in his arms\r\nan infant--a robust, ruddy little boy of some two years old--roaring\r\nwith all the power of his lungs. He had probably just awaked from a\r\nchurch-sleep. Two little girls, of nine and ten, followed. The influence\r\nof the fresh air, and the attraction of some flowers gathered from a\r\ngrave, soon quieted the child. The man sat down with him, dandling him\r\non his knee as tenderly as any woman; the two little girls took their\r\nplaces one on each side.\r\n\r\n"Good-evening, William," said Shirley, after due scrutiny of the man. He\r\nhad seen her before, and apparently was waiting to be recognized. He now\r\ntook off his hat, and grinned a smile of pleasure. He was a\r\nrough-headed, hard-featured personage, not old, but very weather-beaten.\r\nHis attire was decent and clean; that of his children singularly neat.\r\nIt was our old friend Farren. The young ladies approached him.\r\n\r\n"You are not going into the church?" he inquired, gazing at them\r\ncomplacently, yet with a mixture of bashfulness in his look--a sentiment\r\nnot by any means the result of awe of their station, but only of\r\nappreciation of their elegance and youth. Before gentlemen--such as\r\nMoore or Helstone, for instance--William was often a little dogged;\r\nwith proud or insolent ladies, too, he was quite unmanageable, sometimes\r\nvery resentful; but he was most sensible of, most tractable to,\r\ngood-humour and civility. His nature--a stubborn one--was repelled by\r\ninflexibility in other natures; for which reason he had never been able\r\nto like his former master, Moore; and unconscious of that gentleman\'s\r\ngood opinion of himself, and of the service he had secretly rendered him\r\nin recommending him as gardener to Mr. Yorke, and by this means to other\r\nfamilies in the neighbourhood, he continued to harbour a grudge against\r\nhis austerity. Latterly he had often worked at Fieldhead. Miss Keeldar\'s\r\nfrank, hospitable manners were perfectly charming to him. Caroline he\r\nhad known from her childhood; unconsciously she was his ideal of a lady.\r\nHer gentle mien, step, gestures, her grace of person and attire, moved\r\nsome artist-fibres about his peasant heart. He had a pleasure in looking\r\nat her, as he had in examining rare flowers or in seeing pleasant\r\nlandscapes. Both the ladies liked William; it was their delight to lend\r\nhim books, to give him plants; and they preferred his conversation far\r\nbefore that of many coarse, hard, pretentious people immeasurably higher\r\nin station.\r\n\r\n"Who was speaking, William, when you came out?" asked Shirley.\r\n\r\n"A gentleman ye set a deal of store on, Miss Shirley--Mr. Donne."\r\n\r\n"You look knowing, William. How did you find out my regard for Mr.\r\nDonne?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, Miss Shirley, there\'s a gleg light i\' your een sometimes which\r\nbetrays you. You look raight down scornful sometimes when Mr. Donne is\r\nby."\r\n\r\n"Do you like him yourself, William?"\r\n\r\n"Me? I\'m stalled o\' t\' curates, and so is t\' wife. They\'ve no manners.\r\nThey talk to poor folk fair as if they thought they were beneath them.\r\nThey\'re allus magnifying their office. It is a pity but their office\r\ncould magnify them; but it does nought o\' t\' soart. I fair hate pride."\r\n\r\n"But you are proud in your own way yourself," interposed Caroline. "You\r\nare what you call house-proud: you like to have everything handsome\r\nabout you. Sometimes you look as if you were almost too proud to take\r\nyour wages. When you were out of work, you were too proud to get\r\nanything on credit. But for your children, I believe you would rather\r\nhave starved than gone to the shops without money; and when I wanted to\r\ngive you something, what a difficulty I had in making you take it!"\r\n\r\n"It is partly true, Miss Caroline. Ony day I\'d rather give than take,\r\nespecially from sich as ye. Look at t\' difference between us. Ye\'re a\r\nlittle, young, slender lass, and I\'m a great strong man; I\'m rather more\r\nnor twice your age. It is not _my_ part, then, I think, to tak fro\'\r\n_ye_--to be under obligations (as they say) to _ye_. And that day ye\r\ncame to our house, and called me to t\' door, and offered me five\r\nshillings, which I doubt ye could ill spare--for ye\'ve no fortin\', I\r\nknow--that day I war fair a rebel, a radical, an insurrectionist; and\r\n_ye_ made me so. I thought it shameful that, willing and able as I was\r\nto work, I suld be i\' such a condition that a young cratur about the age\r\no\' my own eldest lass suld think it needful to come and offer me her bit\r\no\' brass."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you were angry with me, William?"\r\n\r\n"I almost was, in a way. But I forgave ye varry soon. Ye meant well. Ay,\r\n_I am_ proud, and so are _ye_; but your pride and mine is t\' raight\r\nmak--what we call i\' Yorkshire clean pride--such as Mr. Malone and Mr.\r\nDonne knows nought about. Theirs is mucky pride. Now, I shall teach my\r\nlasses to be as proud as Miss Shirley there, and my lads to be as proud\r\nas myseln; but I dare ony o\' \'em to be like t\' curates. I\'d lick little\r\nMichael if I seed him show any signs o\' that feeling."\r\n\r\n"What is the difference, William?"\r\n\r\n"Ye know t\' difference weel enow, but ye want me to get a gate o\'\r\ntalking. Mr. Malone and Mr. Donne is almost too proud to do aught for\r\ntheirseln; _we_ are almost too proud to let anybody do aught for us. T\'\r\ncurates can hardly bide to speak a civil word to them they think beneath\r\nthem; _we_ can hardly bide to tak an uncivil word fro\' them that thinks\r\nthemseln aboon us."\r\n\r\n"Now, William, be humble enough to tell me truly how you are getting on\r\nin the world. Are you well off?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Shirley, I am varry well off. Since I got into t\' gardening line,\r\nwi\' Mr. Yorke\'s help, and since Mr. Hall (another o\' t\' raight sort)\r\nhelped my wife to set up a bit of a shop, I\'ve nought to complain of. My\r\nfamily has plenty to eat and plenty to wear. My pride makes me find\r\nmeans to have an odd pound now and then against rainy days; for I think\r\nI\'d die afore I\'d come to t\' parish; and me and mine is content. But t\'\r\nneighbours is poor yet. I see a great deal of distress."\r\n\r\n"And, consequently, there is still discontent, I suppose?" inquired Miss\r\nKeeldar.\r\n\r\n"_Consequently_--ye say right--_consequently_. In course, starving folk\r\ncannot be satisfied or settled folk. The country\'s not in a safe\r\ncondition--I\'ll say so mich!"\r\n\r\n"But what can be done? What more can I do, for instance?"\r\n\r\n"Do? Ye can do not mich, poor young lass! Ye\'ve gi\'en your brass; ye\'ve\r\ndone well. If ye could transport your tenant, Mr. Moore, to Botany Bay,\r\nye\'d happen do better. Folks hate him."\r\n\r\n"William, for shame!" exclaimed Caroline warmly. "If folks _do_ hate\r\nhim, it is to their disgrace, not his. Mr. Moore himself hates nobody.\r\nHe only wants to do his duty, and maintain his rights. You are wrong to\r\ntalk so."\r\n\r\n"I talk as I think. He has a cold, unfeeling heart, yond\' Moore."\r\n\r\n"But," interposed Shirley, "supposing Moore was driven from the country,\r\nand his mill razed to the ground, would people have more work?"\r\n\r\n"They\'d have less. I know that, and they know that; and there is many an\r\nhonest lad driven desperate by the certainty that whichever way he turns\r\nhe cannot better himself; and there is dishonest men plenty to guide\r\nthem to the devil, scoundrels that reckons to be the \'people\'s friends,\'\r\nand that knows nought about the people, and is as insincere as Lucifer.\r\nI\'ve lived aboon forty year in the world, and I believe that \'the\r\npeople\' will never have any true friends but theirseln and them two or\r\nthree good folk i\' different stations that is friends to all the world.\r\nHuman natur\', taking it i\' th\' lump, is nought but selfishness. It is\r\nbut excessive few, it is but just an exception here and there, now and\r\nthen, sich as ye two young uns and me, that, being in a different\r\nsphere, can understand t\' one t\' other, and be friends wi\'out\r\nslavishness o\' one hand or pride o\' t\' other. Them that reckons to be\r\nfriends to a lower class than their own fro\' political motives is never\r\nto be trusted; they always try to make their inferiors tools. For my own\r\npart, I will neither be patronized nor misled for no man\'s pleasure.\r\nI\'ve had overtures made to me lately that I saw were treacherous, and I\r\nflung \'em back i\' the faces o\' them that offered \'em."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t tell us what overtures?"\r\n\r\n"I will not. It would do no good. It would mak no difference. Them they\r\nconcerned can look after theirseln."\r\n\r\n"Ay, we\'se look after werseln," said another voice. Joe Scott had\r\nsauntered forth from the church to get a breath of fresh air, and there\r\nhe stood.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll warrant _ye_, Joe," observed William, smiling.\r\n\r\n"And I\'ll warrant my maister," was the answer.--"Young ladies,"\r\ncontinued Joe, assuming a lordly air, "ye\'d better go into th\' house."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what for?" inquired Shirley, to whom the overlooker\'s somewhat\r\npragmatical manners were familiar, and who was often at war with him;\r\nfor Joe, holding supercilious theories about women in general, resented\r\ngreatly, in his secret soul, the fact of his master and his master\'s\r\nmill being, in a manner, under petticoat government, and had felt as\r\nwormwood and gall certain business visits of the heiress to the Hollow\'s\r\ncounting-house.\r\n\r\n"Because there is nought agate that fits women to be consarned in."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! There is prayer and preaching agate in that church. Are we not\r\nconcerned in that?"\r\n\r\n"Ye have been present neither at the prayer nor preaching, ma\'am, if I\r\nhave observed aright. What I alluded to was politics. William Farren\r\nhere was touching on that subject, if I\'m not mista\'en."\r\n\r\n"Well, what then? Politics are our habitual study, Joe. Do you know I\r\nsee a newspaper every day, and two of a Sunday?"\r\n\r\n"I should think you\'ll read the marriages, probably, miss, and the\r\nmurders, and the accidents, and sich like?"\r\n\r\n"I read the leading articles, Joe, and the foreign intelligence, and I\r\nlook over the market prices. In short, I read just what gentlemen read."\r\n\r\nJoe looked as if he thought this talk was like the chattering of a pie.\r\nHe replied to it by a disdainful silence.\r\n\r\n"Joe," continued Miss Keeldar, "I never yet could ascertain properly\r\nwhether you are a Whig or a Tory. Pray, which party has the honour of\r\nyour alliance?"\r\n\r\n"It is rayther difficult to explain where you are sure not to be\r\nunderstood," was Joe\'s haughty response; "but as to being a Tory, I\'d as\r\nsoon be an old woman, or a young one, which is a more flimsier article\r\nstill. It is the Tories that carries on the war and ruins trade; and if\r\nI be of any party--though political parties is all nonsense--I\'m of\r\nthat which is most favourable to peace, and, by consequence, to the\r\nmercantile interests of this here land."\r\n\r\n"So am I, Joe," replied Shirley, who had rather a pleasure in teasing\r\nthe overlooker, by persisting in talking on subjects with which he\r\nopined she, as a woman, had no right to meddle--"partly, at least. I\r\nhave rather a leaning to the agricultural interest, too; as good reason\r\nis, seeing that I don\'t desire England to be under the feet of France,\r\nand that if a share of my income comes from Hollow\'s Mill, a larger\r\nshare comes from the landed estate around it. It would not do to take\r\nany measures injurious to the farmers, Joe, I think?"\r\n\r\n"The dews at this hour is unwholesome for females," observed Joe.\r\n\r\n"If you make that remark out of interest in me, I have merely to assure\r\nyou that I am impervious to cold. I should not mind taking my turn to\r\nwatch the mill one of these summer nights, armed with your musket, Joe."\r\n\r\nJoe Scott\'s chin was always rather prominent. He poked it out, at this\r\nspeech, some inches farther than usual.\r\n\r\n"But--to go back to my sheep," she proceeded--"clothier and mill-owner\r\nas I am, besides farmer, I cannot get out of my head a certain idea that\r\nwe manufacturers and persons of business are sometimes a little--a _very\r\nlittle_--selfish and short-sighted in our views, and rather _too_\r\nregardless of human suffering, rather heartless in our pursuit of gain.\r\nDon\'t you agree with me, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot argue where I cannot be comprehended," was again the answer.\r\n\r\n"Man of mystery! Your master will argue with me sometimes, Joe. He is\r\nnot so stiff as you are."\r\n\r\n"Maybe not. We\'ve all our own ways."\r\n\r\n"Joe, do you seriously think all the wisdom in the world is lodged in\r\nmale skulls?"\r\n\r\n"I think that women are a kittle and a froward generation; and I\'ve a\r\ngreat respect for the doctrines delivered in the second chapter of St.\r\nPaul\'s first Epistle to Timothy."\r\n\r\n"What doctrines, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"\'Let the woman learn in silence, with all subjection. I suffer not a\r\nwoman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in\r\nsilence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve.\'"\r\n\r\n"What has that to do with the business?" interjected Shirley. "That\r\nsmacks of rights of primogeniture. I\'ll bring it up to Mr. Yorke the\r\nfirst time he inveighs against those rights."\r\n\r\n"And," continued Joe Scott, "Adam was not deceived, but the woman being\r\ndeceived was in the transgression."\r\n\r\n"More shame to Adam to sin with his eyes open!" cried Miss Keeldar. "To\r\nconfess the honest truth, Joe, I never was easy in my mind concerning\r\nthat chapter. It puzzles me."\r\n\r\n"It is very plain, miss. He that runs may read."\r\n\r\n"He may read it in his own fashion," remarked Caroline, now joining in\r\nthe dialogue for the first time. "You allow the right of private\r\njudgment, I suppose, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"My certy, that I do! I allow and claim it for every line of the holy\r\nBook."\r\n\r\n"Women may exercise it as well as men?"\r\n\r\n"Nay. Women is to take their husbands\' opinion, both in politics and\r\nreligion. It\'s wholesomest for them."\r\n\r\n"Oh! oh!" exclaimed both Shirley and Caroline.\r\n\r\n"To be sure; no doubt on\'t," persisted the stubborn overlooker.\r\n\r\n"Consider yourself groaned down, and cried shame over, for such a stupid\r\nobservation," said Miss Keeldar. "You might as well say men are to take\r\nthe opinions of their priests without examination. Of what value would a\r\nreligion so adopted be? It would be mere blind, besotted superstition."\r\n\r\n"And what is _your_ reading, Miss Helstone, o\' these words o\' St.\r\nPaul\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Hem! I--I account for them in this way. He wrote that chapter for a\r\nparticular congregation of Christians, under peculiar circumstances; and\r\nbesides, I dare say, if I could read the original Greek, I should find\r\nthat many of the words have been wrongly translated, perhaps\r\nmisapprehended altogether. It would be possible, I doubt not, with a\r\nlittle ingenuity, to give the passage quite a contrary turn--to make it\r\nsay, \'Let the woman speak out whenever she sees fit to make an\r\nobjection.\' \'It is permitted to a woman to teach and to exercise\r\nauthority as much as may be. Man, meantime, cannot do better than hold\r\nhis peace;\' and so on."\r\n\r\n"That willn\'t wash, miss."\r\n\r\n"I dare say it will. My notions are dyed in faster colours than yours,\r\nJoe. Mr. Scott, you are a thoroughly dogmatical person, and always\r\nwere. I like William better than you."\r\n\r\n"Joe is well enough in his own house," said Shirley. "I have seen him as\r\nquiet as a lamb at home. There is not a better nor a kinder husband in\r\nBriarfield. He does not dogmatize to his wife."\r\n\r\n"My wife is a hard-working, plain woman; time and trouble has ta\'en all\r\nthe conceit out of her. But that is not the case with you, young misses.\r\nAnd then you reckon to have so much knowledge; and i\' my thoughts it\'s\r\nonly superficial sort o\' vanities you\'re acquainted with. I can\r\ntell--happen a year sin\'--one day Miss Caroline coming into our\r\ncounting-house when I war packing up summat behind t\' great desk, and\r\nshe didn\'t see me, and she brought a slate wi\' a sum on it to t\'\r\nmaister. It war only a bit of a sum in practice, that our Harry would\r\nhave settled i\' two minutes. She couldn\'t do it. Mr. Moore had to show\r\nher how. And when he did show her, she couldn\'t understand him."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Joe!"\r\n\r\n"Nay, it\'s no nonsense. And Miss Shirley there reckons to hearken to t\'\r\nmaister when he\'s talking ower trade, so attentive like, as if she\r\nfollowed him word for word, and all war as clear as a lady\'s\r\nlooking-glass to her een; and all t\' while she\'s peeping and peeping out\r\no\' t\' window to see if t\' mare stands quiet; and then looking at a bit\r\nof a splash on her riding-skirt; and then glancing glegly round at wer\r\ncounting-house cobwebs and dust, and thinking what mucky folk we are,\r\nand what a grand ride she\'ll have just i\' now ower Nunnely Common. She\r\nhears no more o\' Mr. Moore\'s talk nor if he spake Hebrew."\r\n\r\n"Joe, you are a real slanderer. I would give you your answer, only the\r\npeople are coming out of church. We must leave you. Man of prejudice,\r\ngood-bye.--William, good-bye.--Children, come up to Fieldhead to-morrow,\r\nand you shall choose what you like best out of Mrs. Gill\'s store-room."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nA SUMMER NIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hour was now that of dusk. A clear air favoured the kindling of the\r\nstars.\r\n\r\n"There will be just light enough to show me the way home," said Miss\r\nKeeldar, as she prepared to take leave of Caroline at the rectory garden\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"You must not go alone, Shirley; Fanny shall accompany you."\r\n\r\n"That she shall not. Of what need I be afraid in my own parish? I would\r\nwalk from Fieldhead to the church any fine midsummer night, three hours\r\nlater than this, for the mere pleasure of seeing the stars and the\r\nchance of meeting a fairy."\r\n\r\n"But just wait till the crowd is cleared away."\r\n\r\n"Agreed. There are the five Misses Armitage streaming by. Here comes\r\nMrs. Sykes\'s phaeton, Mr. Wynne\'s close carriage, Mrs. Birtwhistle\'s\r\ncar. I don\'t wish to go through the ceremony of bidding them all\r\ngood-bye, so we will step into the garden and take shelter amongst the\r\nlaburnums for an instant."\r\n\r\nThe rectors, their curates, and their churchwardens now issued from the\r\nchurch porch. There was a great confabulation, shaking of hands,\r\ncongratulation on speeches, recommendation to be careful of the night\r\nair, etc. By degrees the throng dispersed, the carriages drove off. Miss\r\nKeeldar was just emerging from her flowery refuge when Mr. Helstone\r\nentered the garden and met her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I want you!" he said. "I was afraid you were already\r\ngone.--Caroline, come here."\r\n\r\nCaroline came, expecting, as Shirley did, a lecture on not having been\r\nvisible at church. Other subjects, however, occupied the rector\'s mind.\r\n\r\n"I shall not sleep at home to-night," he continued. "I have just met\r\nwith an old friend, and promised to accompany him. I shall return\r\nprobably about noon to-morrow. Thomas, the clerk, is engaged, and I\r\ncannot get him to sleep in the house, as I usually do when I am absent\r\nfor a night. Now----"\r\n\r\n"Now," interrupted Shirley, "you want me as a gentleman--the first\r\ngentleman in Briarfield, in short--to supply your place, be master of\r\nthe rectory and guardian of your niece and maids while you are away?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly, captain. I thought the post would suit you. Will you favour\r\nCaroline so far as to be her guest for one night? Will you stay here\r\ninstead of going back to Fieldhead?"\r\n\r\n"And what will Mrs. Pryor do? she expects me home."\r\n\r\n"I will send her word. Come, make up your mind to stay. It grows late;\r\nthe dew falls heavily. You and Caroline will enjoy each other\'s society,\r\nI doubt not."\r\n\r\n"I promise you, then, to stay with Caroline," replied Shirley. "As you\r\nsay, we shall enjoy each other\'s society. We will not be separated\r\nto-night. Now, rejoin your old friend, and fear nothing for us."\r\n\r\n"If there should chance to be any disturbance in the night, captain; if\r\nyou should hear the picking of a lock, the cutting out of a pane of\r\nglass, a stealthy tread of steps about the house (and I need not fear to\r\ntell _you_, who bear a well-tempered, mettlesome heart under your girl\'s\r\nribbon sash, that such little incidents are very possible in the present\r\ntime), what would you do?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know; faint, perhaps--fall down, and have to be picked up again.\r\nBut, doctor, if you assign me the post of honour, you must give me arms.\r\nWhat weapons are there in your stronghold?"\r\n\r\n"You could not wield a sword?"\r\n\r\n"No; I could manage the carving-knife better."\r\n\r\n"You will find a good one in the dining-room sideboard--a lady\'s knife,\r\nlight to handle, and as sharp-pointed as a poniard."\r\n\r\n"It will suit Caroline. But you must give me a brace of pistols. I know\r\nyou have pistols."\r\n\r\n"I have two pairs. One pair I can place at your disposal. You will find\r\nthem suspended over the mantelpiece of my study in cloth cases."\r\n\r\n"Loaded?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but not on the cock. Cock them before you go to bed. It is paying\r\nyou a great compliment, captain, to lend you these. Were you one of the\r\nawkward squad you should not have them."\r\n\r\n"I will take care. You need delay no longer, Mr. Helstone. You may go\r\nnow.--He is gracious to me to lend me his pistols," she remarked, as the\r\nrector passed out at the garden gate. "But come, Lina," she continued,\r\n"let us go in and have some supper. I was too much vexed at tea with the\r\nvicinage of Mr. Sam Wynne to be able to eat, and now I am really\r\nhungry."\r\n\r\nEntering the house, they repaired to the darkened dining-room, through\r\nthe open windows of which apartment stole the evening air, bearing the\r\nperfume of flowers from the garden, the very distant sound of\r\nfar-retreating steps from the road, and a soft, vague murmur whose\r\norigin Caroline explained by the remark, uttered as she stood listening\r\nat the casement, "Shirley, I hear the beck in the Hollow."\r\n\r\nThen she rang the bell, asked for a candle and some bread and milk--Miss\r\nKeeldar\'s usual supper and her own. Fanny, when she brought in the tray,\r\nwould have closed the windows and the shutters, but was requested to\r\ndesist for the present. The twilight was too calm, its breath too balmy\r\nto be yet excluded. They took their meal in silence. Caroline rose once\r\nto remove to the window-sill a glass of flowers which stood on the\r\nsideboard, the exhalation from the blossoms being somewhat too powerful\r\nfor the sultry room. In returning she half opened a drawer, and took\r\nfrom it something that glittered clear and keen in her hand.\r\n\r\n"You assigned this to me, then, Shirley, did you? It is bright,\r\nkeen-edged, finely tapered; it is dangerous-looking. I never yet felt\r\nthe impulse which could move me to direct this against a\r\nfellow-creature. It is difficult to fancy that circumstances could nerve\r\nmy arm to strike home with this long knife."\r\n\r\n"I should hate to do it," replied Shirley, "but I think I could do it,\r\nif goaded by certain exigencies which I can imagine." And Miss Keeldar\r\nquietly sipped her glass of new milk, looking somewhat thoughtful and a\r\nlittle pale; though, indeed, when did she not look pale? She was never\r\nflorid.\r\n\r\nThe milk sipped and the bread eaten, Fanny was again summoned. She and\r\nEliza were recommended to go to bed, which they were quite willing to\r\ndo, being weary of the day\'s exertions, of much cutting of currant-buns,\r\nand filling of urns and teapots, and running backwards and forwards\r\nwith trays. Ere long the maids\' chamber door was heard to close.\r\nCaroline took a candle and went quietly all over the house, seeing that\r\nevery window was fast and every door barred. She did not even evade the\r\nhaunted back kitchen nor the vault-like cellars. These visited, she\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n"There is neither spirit nor flesh in the house at present," she said,\r\n"which should not be there. It is now near eleven o\'clock, fully\r\nbedtime; yet I would rather sit up a little longer, if you do not\r\nobject, Shirley. Here," she continued, "I have brought the brace of\r\npistols from my uncle\'s study. You may examine them at your leisure."\r\n\r\nShe placed them on the table before her friend.\r\n\r\n"Why would you rather sit up longer?" asked Miss Keeldar, taking up the\r\nfirearms, examining them, and again laying them down.\r\n\r\n"Because I have a strange, excited feeling in my heart."\r\n\r\n"So have I."\r\n\r\n"Is this state of sleeplessness and restlessness caused by something\r\nelectrical in the air, I wonder?"\r\n\r\n"No; the sky is clear, the stars numberless. It is a fine night."\r\n\r\n"But very still. I hear the water fret over its stony bed in Hollow\'s\r\nCopse as distinctly as if it ran below the churchyard wall."\r\n\r\n"I am glad it is so still a night. A moaning wind or rushing rain would\r\nvex me to fever just now."\r\n\r\n"Why, Shirley?"\r\n\r\n"Because it would baffle my efforts to listen."\r\n\r\n"Do you listen towards the Hollow?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is the only quarter whence we can hear a sound just now."\r\n\r\n"The only one, Shirley."\r\n\r\nThey both sat near the window, and both leaned their arms on the sill,\r\nand both inclined their heads towards the open lattice. They saw each\r\nother\'s young faces by the starlight and that dim June twilight which\r\ndoes not wholly fade from the west till dawn begins to break in the\r\neast.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Helstone thinks we have no idea which way he is gone," murmured\r\nMiss Keeldar, "nor on what errand, nor with what expectations, nor how\r\nprepared. But I guess much; do not you?"\r\n\r\n"I guess something."\r\n\r\n"All those gentlemen--your cousin Moore included--think that you and I\r\nare now asleep in our beds, unconscious."\r\n\r\n"Caring nothing about them--hoping and fearing nothing for them," added\r\nCaroline.\r\n\r\nBoth kept silent for full half an hour. The night was silent too; only\r\nthe church clock measured its course by quarters. Some words were\r\ninterchanged about the chill of the air. They wrapped their scarves\r\ncloser round them, resumed their bonnets, which they had removed, and\r\nagain watched.\r\n\r\nTowards midnight the teasing, monotonous bark of the house-dog disturbed\r\nthe quietude of their vigil. Caroline rose, and made her way noiselessly\r\nthrough the dark passages to the kitchen, intending to appease him with\r\na piece of bread. She succeeded. On returning to the dining-room she\r\nfound it all dark, Miss Keeldar having extinguished the candle. The\r\noutline of her shape was visible near the still open window, leaning\r\nout. Miss Helstone asked no questions; she stole to her side. The dog\r\nrecommenced barking furiously. Suddenly he stopped, and seemed to\r\nlisten. The occupants of the dining-room listened too, and not merely\r\nnow to the flow of the mill-stream. There was a nearer, though a\r\nmuffled, sound on the road below the churchyard--a measured, beating,\r\napproaching sound--a dull tramp of marching feet.\r\n\r\nIt drew near. Those who listened by degrees comprehended its extent. It\r\nwas not the tread of two, nor of a dozen, nor of a score of men; it was\r\nthe tread of hundreds. They could see nothing; the high shrubs of the\r\ngarden formed a leafy screen between them and the road. To hear,\r\nhowever, was not enough, and this they felt as the troop trod forwards,\r\nand seemed actually passing the rectory. They felt it more when a human\r\nvoice--though that voice spoke but one word--broke the hush of the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n"Halt!"\r\n\r\nA halt followed. The march was arrested. Then came a low conference, of\r\nwhich no word was distinguishable from the dining-room.\r\n\r\n"We _must_ hear this," said Shirley.\r\n\r\nShe turned, took her pistols from the table, silently passed out through\r\nthe middle window of the dining-room, which was, in fact, a glass door,\r\nstole down the walk to the garden wall, and stood listening under the\r\nlilacs. Caroline would not have quitted the house had she been alone,\r\nbut where Shirley went she would go. She glanced at the weapon on the\r\nsideboard, but left it behind her, and presently stood at her friend\'s\r\nside. They dared not look over the wall, for fear of being seen; they\r\nwere obliged to crouch behind it. They heard these words,--\r\n\r\n"It looks a rambling old building. Who lives in it besides the damned\r\nparson?"\r\n\r\n"Only three women--his niece and two servants."\r\n\r\n"Do you know where they sleep?"\r\n\r\n"The lasses behind; the niece in a front room."\r\n\r\n"And Helstone?"\r\n\r\n"Yonder is his chamber. He was burning a light, but I see none now."\r\n\r\n"Where would you get in?"\r\n\r\n"If I were ordered to do his job--and he desarves it--I\'d try yond\' long\r\nwindow; it opens to the dining-room. I could grope my way upstairs, and\r\nI know his chamber."\r\n\r\n"How would you manage about the women folk?"\r\n\r\n"Let \'em alone except they shrieked, and then I\'d soon quieten \'em. I\r\ncould wish to find the old chap asleep. If he waked, he\'d be dangerous."\r\n\r\n"Has he arms?"\r\n\r\n"Firearms, allus--and allus loadened."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re a fool to stop us here. A shot would give the alarm. Moore\r\nwould be on us before we could turn round. We should miss our main\r\nobject."\r\n\r\n"You might go on, I tell you. I\'d engage Helstone alone."\r\n\r\nA pause. One of the party dropped some weapon, which rang on the stone\r\ncauseway. At this sound the rectory dog barked again\r\nfuriously--fiercely.\r\n\r\n"That spoils all!" said the voice. "He\'ll awake. A noise like that might\r\nrouse the dead. You did not say there was a dog. Damn you! Forward!"\r\n\r\nForward they went--tramp, tramp--with mustering, manifold, slow-filing\r\ntread. They were gone.\r\n\r\nShirley stood erect, looked over the wall, along the road.\r\n\r\n"Not a soul remains," she said.\r\n\r\nShe stood and mused. "Thank God!" was the next observation.\r\n\r\nCaroline repeated the ejaculation--not in so steady a tone. She was\r\ntrembling much. Her heart was beating fast and thick; her face was cold,\r\nher forehead damp.\r\n\r\n"Thank God for us!" she reiterated. "But what will happen elsewhere?\r\nThey have passed us by that they may make sure of others."\r\n\r\n"They have done well," returned Shirley, with composure. "The others\r\nwill defend themselves. They can do it. They are prepared for them. With\r\nus it is otherwise. My finger was on the trigger of this pistol. I was\r\nquite ready to give that man, if he had entered, such a greeting as he\r\nlittle calculated on; but behind him followed three hundred. I had\r\nneither three hundred hands nor three hundred weapons. I could not have\r\neffectually protected either you, myself, or the two poor women asleep\r\nunder that roof. Therefore I again earnestly thank God for insult and\r\nperil escaped."\r\n\r\nAfter a second pause she continued: "What is it my duty and wisdom to do\r\nnext? Not to stay here inactive, I am glad to say, but, of course, to\r\nwalk over to the Hollow."\r\n\r\n"To the Hollow, Shirley?"\r\n\r\n"To the Hollow. Will you go with me?"\r\n\r\n"Where those men are gone?"\r\n\r\n"They have taken the highway; we should not encounter them. The road\r\nover the fields is as safe, silent, and solitary as a path through the\r\nair would be. Will you go?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," was the answer, given mechanically, not because the speaker\r\nwished or was prepared to go, or, indeed, was otherwise than scared at\r\nthe prospect of going, but because she felt she could not abandon\r\nShirley.\r\n\r\n"Then we must fasten up these windows, and leave all as secure as we can\r\nbehind us. Do you know what we are going for, Cary?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--no--because you wish it."\r\n\r\n"Is that all? And are you so obedient to a mere caprice of mine? What a\r\ndocile wife you would make to a stern husband! The moon\'s face is not\r\nwhiter than yours at this moment, and the aspen at the gate does not\r\ntremble more than your busy fingers; and so, tractable and\r\nterror-struck, and dismayed and devoted, you would follow me into the\r\nthick of real danger! Cary, let me give your fidelity a motive. We are\r\ngoing for Moore\'s sake--to see if we can be of use to him, to make an\r\neffort to warn him of what is coming."\r\n\r\n"To be sure! I am a blind, weak fool, and you are acute and sensible,\r\nShirley. I will go with you; I will gladly go with you!"\r\n\r\n"I do not doubt it. You would die blindly and meekly for me, but you\r\nwould intelligently and gladly die for Moore. But, in truth, there is no\r\nquestion of death to-night; we run no risk at all."\r\n\r\nCaroline rapidly closed shutter and lattice. "Do not fear that I shall\r\nnot have breath to run as fast as you can possibly run, Shirley. Take my\r\nhand. Let us go straight across the fields."\r\n\r\n"But you cannot climb walls?"\r\n\r\n"To-night I can."\r\n\r\n"You are afraid of hedges, and the beck which we shall be forced to\r\ncross?"\r\n\r\n"I can cross it."\r\n\r\nThey started; they ran. Many a wall checked but did not baffle them.\r\nShirley was surefooted and agile; she could spring like a deer when she\r\nchose. Caroline, more timid and less dexterous, fell once or twice, and\r\nbruised herself; but she rose again directly, saying she was not hurt. A\r\nquickset hedge bounded the last field; they lost time in seeking a gap\r\nin it. The aperture, when found, was narrow, but they worked their way\r\nthrough. The long hair, the tender skin, the silks and the muslins\r\nsuffered; but what was chiefly regretted was the impediment this\r\ndifficulty had caused to speed. On the other side they met the beck,\r\nflowing deep in a rough bed. At this point a narrow plank formed the\r\nonly bridge across it. Shirley had trodden the plank successfully and\r\nfearlessly many a time before; Caroline had never yet dared to risk the\r\ntransit.\r\n\r\n"I will carry you across," said Miss Keeldar. "You are light, and I am\r\nnot weak. Let me try."\r\n\r\n"If I fall in, you may fish me out," was the answer, as a grateful\r\nsqueeze compressed her hand. Caroline, without pausing, trod forward on\r\nthe trembling plank as if it were a continuation of the firm turf.\r\nShirley, who followed, did not cross it more resolutely or safely. In\r\ntheir present humour, on their present errand, a strong and foaming\r\nchannel would have been a barrier to neither. At the moment they were\r\nabove the control either of fire or water. All Stilbro\' Moor, alight and\r\naglow with bonfires, would not have stopped them, nor would Calder or\r\nAire thundering in flood. Yet one sound made them pause. Scarce had\r\nthey set foot on the solid opposite bank when a shot split the air from\r\nthe north. One second elapsed. Further off burst a like note in the\r\nsouth. Within the space of three minutes similar signals boomed in the\r\neast and west.\r\n\r\n"I thought we were dead at the first explosion," observed Shirley,\r\ndrawing a long breath. "I felt myself hit in the temples, and I\r\nconcluded your heart was pierced; but the reiterated voice was an\r\nexplanation. Those are signals--it is their way--the attack must be\r\nnear. We should have had wings. Our feet have not borne us swiftly\r\nenough."\r\n\r\nA portion of the copse was now to clear. When they emerged from it the\r\nmill lay just below them. They could look down upon the buildings, the\r\nyard; they could see the road beyond. And the first glance in that\r\ndirection told Shirley she was right in her conjecture. They were\r\nalready too late to give warning. It had taken more time than they\r\ncalculated on to overcome the various obstacles which embarrassed the\r\nshort cut across the fields.\r\n\r\nThe road, which should have been white, was dark with a moving mass. The\r\nrioters were assembled in front of the closed yard gates, and a single\r\nfigure stood within, apparently addressing them. The mill itself was\r\nperfectly black and still. There was neither life, light, nor motion\r\naround it.\r\n\r\n"Surely he is prepared. Surely that is not Moore meeting them alone?"\r\nwhispered Shirley.\r\n\r\n"It is. We must go to him. I _will_ go to him."\r\n\r\n"_That_ you will not."\r\n\r\n"Why did I come, then? I came only for him. I shall join him."\r\n\r\n"Fortunately it is out of your power. There is no entrance to the yard."\r\n\r\n"There _is_ a small entrance at the back, besides the gates in front. It\r\nopens by a secret method which I know. I will try it."\r\n\r\n"Not with my leave."\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar clasped her round the waist with both arms and held her\r\nback. "Not one step shall you stir," she went on authoritatively. "At\r\nthis moment Moore would be both shocked and embarrassed if he saw either\r\nyou or me. Men never want women near them in time of real danger."\r\n\r\n"I would not trouble--I would help him," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"How?--by inspiring him with heroism? Pooh! these are not the days of\r\nchivalry. It is not a tilt at a tournament we are going to behold, but a\r\nstruggle about money, and food, and life."\r\n\r\n"It is natural that I should be at his side."\r\n\r\n"As queen of his heart? His mill is his lady-love, Cary! Backed by his\r\nfactory and his frames, he has all the encouragement he wants or can\r\nknow. It is not for love or beauty, but for ledger and broadcloth, he is\r\ngoing to break a spear. Don\'t be sentimental; Robert is not so."\r\n\r\n"I _could_ help him; I _will_ seek him."\r\n\r\n"Off then--I let you go--seek Moore. You\'ll not find him."\r\n\r\nShe loosened her hold. Caroline sped like levelled shaft from bent bow;\r\nafter her rang a jesting, gibing laugh. "Look well there is no mistake!"\r\nwas the warning given.\r\n\r\nBut there _was_ a mistake. Miss Helstone paused, hesitated, gazed. The\r\nfigure had suddenly retreated from the gate, and was running back\r\nhastily to the mill.\r\n\r\n"Make haste, Lina!" cried Shirley; "meet him before he enters."\r\n\r\nCaroline slowly returned. "It is not Robert," she said. "It has neither\r\nhis height, form, nor bearing."\r\n\r\n"I saw it was not Robert when I let you go. How could you imagine it? It\r\nis a shabby little figure of a private soldier; they had posted him as\r\nsentinel. He is safe in the mill now. I saw the door open and admit him.\r\nMy mind grows easier. Robert is prepared. Our warning would have been\r\nsuperfluous; and now I am thankful we came too late to give it. It has\r\nsaved us the trouble of a scene. How fine to have entered the\r\ncounting-house _toute \xc3\xa9perdue_, and to have found oneself in presence of\r\nMessrs. Armitage and Ramsden smoking, Malone swaggering, your uncle\r\nsneering, Mr. Sykes sipping a cordial, and Moore himself in his cold\r\nman-of-business vein! I am glad we missed it all."\r\n\r\n"I wonder if there are many in the mill, Shirley!"\r\n\r\n"Plenty to defend it. The soldiers we have twice seen to-day were going\r\nthere, no doubt, and the group we noticed surrounding your cousin in the\r\nfields will be with him."\r\n\r\n"What are they doing now, Shirley? What is that noise?"\r\n\r\n"Hatchets and crowbars against the yard gates. They are forcing them.\r\nAre you afraid?"\r\n\r\n"No; but my heart throbs fast. I have a difficulty in standing. I will\r\nsit down. Do you feel unmoved?"\r\n\r\n"Hardly that; but I am glad I came. We shall see what transpires with\r\nour own eyes. We are here on the spot, and none know it. Instead of\r\namazing the curate, the clothier, and the corn-dealer with a romantic\r\nrush on the stage, we stand alone with the friendly night, its mute\r\nstars, and these whispering trees, whose report our friends will not\r\ncome to gather."\r\n\r\n"Shirley, Shirley, the gates are down! That crash was like the felling\r\nof great trees. Now they are pouring through. They will break down the\r\nmill doors as they have broken the gate. What can Robert do against so\r\nmany? Would to God I were a little nearer him--could hear him\r\nspeak--could speak to him! With my will--my longing to serve him--I\r\ncould not be a useless burden in his way; I could be turned to some\r\naccount."\r\n\r\n"They come on!" cried Shirley. "How steadily they march in! There is\r\ndiscipline in their ranks. I will not say there is courage--hundreds\r\nagainst tens are no proof of that quality--but" (she dropped her voice)\r\n"there is suffering and desperation enough amongst them. These goads\r\nwill urge them forwards."\r\n\r\n"Forwards against Robert; and they hate him. Shirley, is there much\r\ndanger they will win the day?"\r\n\r\n"We shall see. Moore and Helstone are of \'earth\'s first blood\'--no\r\nbunglers--no cravens----"\r\n\r\nA crash--smash--shiver--stopped their whispers. A simultaneously hurled\r\nvolley of stones had saluted the broad front of the mill, with all its\r\nwindows; and now every pane of every lattice lay in shattered and\r\npounded fragments. A yell followed this demonstration--a rioters\'\r\nyell--a north-of-England, a Yorkshire, a West-Riding, a\r\nWest-Riding-clothing-district-of-Yorkshire rioters\' yell.\r\n\r\nYou never heard that sound, perhaps, reader? So much the better for your\r\nears--perhaps for your heart, since, if it rends the air in hate to\r\nyourself, or to the men or principles you approve, the interests to\r\nwhich you wish well, wrath wakens to the cry of hate; the lion shakes\r\nhis mane, and rises to the howl of the hyena; caste stands up, ireful\r\nagainst caste; and the indignant, wronged spirit of the middle rank\r\nbears down in zeal and scorn on the famished and furious mass of the\r\noperative class. It is difficult to be tolerant, difficult to be just,\r\nin such moments.\r\n\r\nCaroline rose; Shirley put her arm round her: they stood together as\r\nstill as the straight stems of two trees. That yell was a long one, and\r\nwhen it ceased the night was yet full of the swaying and murmuring of a\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\n"What next?" was the question of the listeners. Nothing came yet. The\r\nmill remained mute as a mausoleum.\r\n\r\n"He _cannot_ be alone!" whispered Caroline.\r\n\r\n"I would stake all I have that he is as little alone as he is alarmed,"\r\nresponded Shirley.\r\n\r\nShots were discharged by the rioters. Had the defenders waited for this\r\nsignal? It seemed so. The hitherto inert and passive mill woke; fire\r\nflashed from its empty window-frames; a volley of musketry pealed sharp\r\nthrough the Hollow.\r\n\r\n"Moore speaks at last!" said Shirley, "and he seems to have the gift of\r\ntongues. That was not a single voice."\r\n\r\n"He has been forbearing. No one can accuse him of rashness," alleged\r\nCaroline. "Their discharge preceded his. They broke his gates and his\r\nwindows. They fired at his garrison before he repelled them."\r\n\r\nWhat was going on now? It seemed difficult, in the darkness, to\r\ndistinguish; but something terrible, a still-renewing tumult, was\r\nobvious--fierce attacks, desperate repulses. The mill-yard, the mill\r\nitself, was full of battle movement. There was scarcely any cessation\r\nnow of the discharge of firearms; and there was struggling, rushing,\r\ntrampling, and shouting between. The aim of the assailants seemed to be\r\nto enter the mill, that of the defenders to beat them off. They heard\r\nthe rebel leader cry, "To the back, lads!" They heard a voice retort,\r\n"Come round; we will meet you."\r\n\r\n"To the counting-house!" was the order again.\r\n\r\n"Welcome! we shall have you there!" was the response. And accordingly\r\nthe fiercest blaze that had yet glowed, the loudest rattle that had yet\r\nbeen heard, burst from the counting-house front when the mass of rioters\r\nrushed up to it.\r\n\r\nThe voice that had spoken was Moore\'s own voice. They could tell by its\r\ntones that his soul was now warm with the conflict; they could guess\r\nthat the fighting animal was roused in every one of those men there\r\nstruggling together, and was for the time quite paramount above the\r\nrational human being.\r\n\r\nBoth the girls felt their faces glow and their pulses throb; both knew\r\nthey would do no good by rushing down into the _m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e_. They desired\r\nneither to deal nor to receive blows; but they could not have run\r\naway--Caroline no more than Shirley; they could not have fainted; they\r\ncould not have taken their eyes from the dim, terrible scene--from the\r\nmass of cloud, of smoke, the musket-lightning--for the world.\r\n\r\n"How and when would it end?" was the demand throbbing in their throbbing\r\npulses. "Would a juncture arise in which they could be useful?" was what\r\nthey waited to see; for though Shirley put off their too-late arrival\r\nwith a jest, and was ever ready to satirize her own or any other\r\nperson\'s enthusiasm, she would have given a farm of her best land for a\r\nchance of rendering good service.\r\n\r\nThe chance was not vouchsafed her; the looked-for juncture never came.\r\nIt was not likely. Moore had expected this attack for days, perhaps\r\nweeks; he was prepared for it at every point. He had fortified and\r\ngarrisoned his mill, which in itself was a strong building. He was a\r\ncool, brave man; he stood to the defence with unflinching firmness.\r\nThose who were with him caught his spirit, and copied his demeanour. The\r\nrioters had never been so met before. At other mills they had attacked\r\nthey had found no resistance; an organized, resolute defence was what\r\nthey never dreamed of encountering. When their leaders saw the steady\r\nfire kept up from the mill, witnessed the composure and determination of\r\nits owner, heard themselves coolly defied and invited on to death, and\r\nbeheld their men falling wounded round them, they felt that nothing was\r\nto be done here. In haste they mustered their forces, drew them away\r\nfrom the building. A roll was called over, in which the men answered to\r\nfigures instead of names. They dispersed wide over the fields, leaving\r\nsilence and ruin behind them. The attack, from its commencement to its\r\ntermination, had not occupied an hour.\r\n\r\nDay was by this time approaching; the west was dim, the east beginning\r\nto gleam. It would have seemed that the girls who had watched this\r\nconflict would now wish to hasten to the victors, on whose side all\r\ntheir interest had been enlisted; but they only very cautiously\r\napproached the now battered mill, and when suddenly a number of soldiers\r\nand gentlemen appeared at the great door opening into the yard, they\r\nquickly stepped aside into a shed, the deposit of old iron and timber,\r\nwhence they could see without being seen.\r\n\r\nIt was no cheering spectacle. These premises were now a mere blot of\r\ndesolation on the fresh front of the summer dawn. All the copse up the\r\nHollow was shady and dewy, the hill at its head was green; but just\r\nhere, in the centre of the sweet glen, Discord, broken loose in the\r\nnight from control, had beaten the ground with his stamping hoofs, and\r\nleft it waste and pulverized. The mill yawned all ruinous with unglazed\r\nframes; the yard was thickly bestrewn with stones and brickbats; and\r\nclose under the mill, with the glittering fragments of the shattered\r\nwindows, muskets and other weapons lay here and there. More than one\r\ndeep crimson stain was visible on the gravel, a human body lay quiet on\r\nits face near the gates, and five or six wounded men writhed and moaned\r\nin the bloody dust.\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar\'s countenance changed at this view. It was the after-taste\r\nof the battle, death and pain replacing excitement and exertion. It was\r\nthe blackness the bright fire leaves when its blaze is sunk, its warmth\r\nfailed, and its glow faded.\r\n\r\n"This is what I wished to prevent," she said, in a voice whose cadence\r\nbetrayed the altered impulse of her heart.\r\n\r\n"But you could not prevent it; you did your best--it was in vain," said\r\nCaroline comfortingly. "Don\'t grieve, Shirley."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for those poor fellows," was the answer, while the spark in\r\nher glance dissolved to dew. "Are any within the mill hurt, I wonder? Is\r\nthat your uncle?"\r\n\r\n"It is, and there is Mr. Malone; and, O Shirley, there is Robert!"\r\n\r\n"Well" (resuming her former tone), "don\'t squeeze your fingers quite\r\ninto my hand. I see. There is nothing wonderful in that. We knew he, at\r\nleast, was here, whoever might be absent."\r\n\r\n"He is coming here towards us, Shirley!"\r\n\r\n"Towards the pump, that is to say, for the purpose of washing his hands\r\nand his forehead, which has got a scratch, I perceive."\r\n\r\n"He bleeds, Shirley. Don\'t hold me. I must go."\r\n\r\n"Not a step."\r\n\r\n"He is hurt, Shirley!"\r\n\r\n"Fiddlestick!"\r\n\r\n"But I _must_ go to him. I wish to go so much. I cannot bear to be\r\nrestrained."\r\n\r\n"What for?"\r\n\r\n"To speak to him, to ask how he is, and what I can do for him."\r\n\r\n"To tease and annoy him; to make a spectacle of yourself and him before\r\nthose soldiers, Mr. Malone, your uncle, et cetera. Would he like it,\r\nthink you? Would you like to remember it a week hence?"\r\n\r\n"Am I always to be curbed and kept down?" demanded Caroline, a little\r\npassionately.\r\n\r\n"For his sake, yes; and still more for your own. I tell you, if you\r\nshowed yourself now you would repent it an hour hence, and so would\r\nRobert."\r\n\r\n"You think he would not like it, Shirley?"\r\n\r\n"Far less than he would like our stopping him to say good-night, which\r\nyou were so sore about."\r\n\r\n"But that was all play; there was no danger."\r\n\r\n"And this is serious work; he must be unmolested."\r\n\r\n"I only wish to go to him because he is my cousin--you understand?"\r\n\r\n"I quite understand. But now, watch him. He has bathed his forehead, and\r\nthe blood has ceased trickling. His hurt is really a mere graze; I can\r\nsee it from hence. He is going to look after the wounded men."\r\n\r\nAccordingly Mr. Moore and Mr. Helstone went round the yard, examining\r\neach prostrate form. They then gave directions to have the wounded taken\r\nup and carried into the mill. This duty being performed, Joe Scott was\r\nordered to saddle his master\'s horse and Mr. Helstone\'s pony, and the\r\ntwo gentlemen rode away full gallop, to seek surgical aid in different\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nCaroline was not yet pacified.\r\n\r\n"Shirley, Shirley, I should have liked to speak one word to him before\r\nhe went," she murmured, while the tears gathered glittering in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Why do you cry, Lina?" asked Miss Keeldar a little sternly. "You ought\r\nto be glad instead of sorry. Robert has escaped any serious harm; he is\r\nvictorious; he has been cool and brave in combat; he is now considerate\r\nin triumph. Is this a time--are these causes for weeping?"\r\n\r\n"You do not know what I have in my heart," pleaded the other--"what\r\npain, what distraction--nor whence it arises. I can understand that you\r\nshould exult in Robert\'s greatness and goodness; so do I, in one sense,\r\nbut in another I feel _so_ miserable. I am too far removed from him. I\r\nused to be nearer. Let me alone, Shirley. Do let me cry a few minutes;\r\nit relieves me."\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar, feeling her tremble in every limb, ceased to expostulate\r\nwith her. She went out of the shed, and left her to weep in peace. It\r\nwas the best plan. In a few minutes Caroline rejoined her, much calmer.\r\nShe said, with her natural, docile, gentle manner, "Come, Shirley, we\r\nwill go home now. I promise not to try to see Robert again till he asks\r\nfor me. I never will try to push myself on him. I thank you for\r\nrestraining me just now."\r\n\r\n"I did it with a good intention," returned Miss Keeldar.\r\n\r\n"Now, dear Lina," she continued, "let us turn our faces to the cool\r\nmorning breeze, and walk very quietly back to the rectory. We will steal\r\nin as we stole out. None shall know where we have been or what we have\r\nseen to-night; neither taunt nor misconstruction can consequently molest\r\nus. To-morrow we will see Robert, and be of good cheer; but I will say\r\nno more, lest I should begin to cry too. I seem hard towards you, but I\r\nam not so."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTO-MORROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two girls met no living soul on their way back to the rectory. They\r\nlet themselves in noiselessly; they stole upstairs unheard--the breaking\r\nmorning gave them what light they needed. Shirley sought her couch\r\nimmediately; and though the room was strange--for she had never slept at\r\nthe rectory before--and though the recent scene was one unparalleled for\r\nexcitement and terror by any it had hitherto been her lot to witness,\r\nyet scarce was her head laid on the pillow ere a deep, refreshing sleep\r\nclosed her eyes and calmed her senses.\r\n\r\nPerfect health was Shirley\'s enviable portion. Though warm-hearted and\r\nsympathetic, she was not nervous; powerful emotions could rouse and sway\r\nwithout exhausting her spirit. The tempest troubled and shook her while\r\nit lasted, but it left her elasticity unbent, and her freshness quite\r\nunblighted. As every day brought her stimulating emotion, so every night\r\nyielded her recreating rest. Caroline now watched her sleeping, and read\r\nthe serenity of her mind in the beauty of her happy countenance.\r\n\r\nFor herself, being of a different temperament, she could not sleep. The\r\ncommonplace excitement of the tea-drinking and school-gathering would\r\nalone have sufficed to make her restless all night; the effect of the\r\nterrible drama which had just been enacted before her eyes was not\r\nlikely to quit her for days. It was vain even to try to retain a\r\nrecumbent posture; she sat up by Shirley\'s side, counting the slow\r\nminutes, and watching the June sun mount the heavens.\r\n\r\nLife wastes fast in such vigils as Caroline had of late but too often\r\nkept--vigils during which the mind, having no pleasant food to nourish\r\nit, no manna of hope, no hived-honey of joyous memories, tries to live\r\non the meagre diet of wishes, and failing to derive thence either\r\ndelight or support, and feeling itself ready to perish with craving\r\nwant, turns to philosophy, to resolution, to resignation; calls on all\r\nthese gods for aid, calls vainly--is unheard, unhelped, and languishes.\r\n\r\nCaroline was a Christian; therefore in trouble she framed many a prayer\r\nafter the Christian creed, preferred it with deep earnestness, begged\r\nfor patience, strength, relief. This world, however, we all know, is the\r\nscene of trial and probation; and, for any favourable result her\r\npetitions had yet wrought, it seemed to her that they were unheard and\r\nunaccepted. She believed, sometimes, that God had turned His face from\r\nher. At moments she was a Calvinist, and, sinking into the gulf of\r\nreligious despair, she saw darkening over her the doom of reprobation.\r\n\r\nMost people have had a period or periods in their lives when they have\r\nfelt thus forsaken--when, having long hoped against hope, and still seen\r\nthe day of fruition deferred, their hearts have truly sickened within\r\nthem. This is a terrible hour, but it is often that darkest point which\r\nprecedes the rise of day--that turn of the year when the icy January\r\nwind carries over the waste at once the dirge of departing winter and\r\nthe prophecy of coming spring. The perishing birds, however, cannot thus\r\nunderstand the blast before which they shiver; and as little can the\r\nsuffering soul recognize, in the climax of its affliction, the dawn of\r\nits deliverance. Yet, let whoever grieves still cling fast to love and\r\nfaith in God. God will never deceive, never finally desert him. "Whom He\r\nloveth, He chasteneth." These words are true, and should not be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nThe household was astir at last; the servants were up; the shutters were\r\nopened below. Caroline, as she quitted the couch, which had been but a\r\nthorny one to her, felt that revival of spirits which the return of day,\r\nof action, gives to all but the wholly despairing or actually dying. She\r\ndressed herself, as usual, carefully, trying so to arrange her hair and\r\nattire that nothing of the forlornness she felt at heart should be\r\nvisible externally. She looked as fresh as Shirley when both were\r\ndressed, only that Miss Keeldar\'s eyes were lively, and Miss Helstone\'s\r\nlanguid.\r\n\r\n"To-day I shall have much to say to Moore," were Shirley\'s first words;\r\nand you could see in her face that life was full of interest,\r\nexpectation, and occupation for her. "He will have to undergo\r\ncross-examination," she added. "I dare say he thinks he has outwitted me\r\ncleverly. And this is the way men deal with women--still concealing\r\ndanger from them--thinking, I suppose, to spare them pain. They\r\nimagined we little knew where they were to-night. We _know_ they little\r\nconjectured where we were. Men, I believe, fancy women\'s minds something\r\nlike those of children. Now, that is a mistake."\r\n\r\nThis was said as she stood at the glass, training her naturally waved\r\nhair into curls, by twining it round her fingers. She took up the theme\r\nagain five minutes after, as Caroline fastened her dress and clasped her\r\ngirdle.\r\n\r\n"If men could see us as we really are, they would be a little amazed;\r\nbut the cleverest, the acutest men are often under an illusion about\r\nwomen. They do not read them in a true light; they misapprehend them,\r\nboth for good and evil. Their good woman is a queer thing, half doll,\r\nhalf angel; their bad woman almost always a fiend. Then to hear them\r\nfall into ecstasies with each other\'s creations--worshipping the heroine\r\nof such a poem, novel, drama--thinking it fine, divine! Fine and divine\r\nit may be, but often quite artificial--false as the rose in my best\r\nbonnet there. If I spoke all I think on this point, if I gave my real\r\nopinion of some first-rate female characters in first-rate works, where\r\nshould I be? Dead under a cairn of avenging stones in half an hour."\r\n\r\n"Shirley, you chatter so, I can\'t fasten you. Be still. And, after all,\r\nauthors\' heroines are almost as good as authoresses\' heroes."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. Women read men more truly than men read women. I\'ll prove\r\nthat in a magazine paper some day when I\'ve time; only it will never be\r\ninserted. It will be \'declined with thanks,\' and left for me at the\r\npublisher\'s."\r\n\r\n"To be sure. You could not write cleverly enough. You don\'t know enough.\r\nYou are not learned, Shirley."\r\n\r\n"God knows I can\'t contradict you, Cary; I\'m as ignorant as a stone.\r\nThere\'s one comfort, however: you are not much better."\r\n\r\nThey descended to breakfast.\r\n\r\n"I wonder how Mrs. Pryor and Hortense Moore have passed the night," said\r\nCaroline, as she made the coffee. "Selfish being that I am, I never\r\nthought of either of them till just now. They will have heard all the\r\ntumult, Fieldhead and the cottage are so near; and Hortense is timid in\r\nsuch matters--so, no doubt, is Mrs. Pryor."\r\n\r\n"Take my word for it, Lina, Moore will have contrived to get his sister\r\nout of the way. She went home with Miss Mann. He will have quartered\r\nher there for the night. As to Mrs. Pryor, I own I am uneasy about her;\r\nbut in another half-hour we will be with her."\r\n\r\nBy this time the news of what had happened at the Hollow was spread all\r\nover the neighbourhood. Fanny, who had been to Fieldhead to fetch the\r\nmilk, returned in panting haste with tidings that there had been a\r\nbattle in the night at Mr. Moore\'s mill, and that some said twenty men\r\nwere killed. Eliza, during Fanny\'s absence, had been apprised by the\r\nbutcher\'s boy that the mill was burnt to the ground. Both women rushed\r\ninto the parlour to announce these terrible facts to the ladies,\r\nterminating their clear and accurate narrative by the assertion that\r\nthey were sure master must have been in it all. He and Thomas, the\r\nclerk, they were confident, must have gone last night to join Mr. Moore\r\nand the soldiers. Mr. Malone, too, had not been heard of at his lodgings\r\nsince yesterday afternoon; and Joe Scott\'s wife and family were in the\r\ngreatest distress, wondering what had become of their head.\r\n\r\nScarcely was this information imparted when a knock at the kitchen door\r\nannounced the Fieldhead errand-boy, arrived in hot haste, bearing a\r\nbillet from Mrs. Pryor. It was hurriedly written, and urged Miss Keeldar\r\nto return directly, as the neighbourhood and the house seemed likely to\r\nbe all in confusion, and orders would have to be given which the\r\nmistress of the hall alone could regulate. In a postscript it was\r\nentreated that Miss Helstone might not be left alone at the rectory. She\r\nhad better, it was suggested, accompany Miss Keeldar.\r\n\r\n"There are not two opinions on that head," said Shirley, as she tied on\r\nher own bonnet, and then ran to fetch Caroline\'s.\r\n\r\n"But what will Fanny and Eliza do? And if my uncle returns?"\r\n\r\n"Your uncle will not return yet; he has other fish to fry. He will be\r\ngalloping backwards and forwards from Briarfield to Stilbro\' all day,\r\nrousing the magistrates in the court-house and the officers at the\r\nbarracks; and Fanny and Eliza can have in Joe Scott\'s and the clerk\'s\r\nwives to bear them company. Besides, of course, there is no real danger\r\nto be apprehended now. Weeks will elapse before the rioters can again\r\nrally, or plan any other attempt; and I am much mistaken if Moore and\r\nMr. Helstone will not take advantage of last night\'s outbreak to quell\r\nthem altogether. They will frighten the authorities of Stilbro\' into\r\nenergetic measures. I only hope they will not be too severe--not pursue\r\nthe discomfited too relentlessly."\r\n\r\n"Robert will not be cruel. We saw that last night," said Caroline.\r\n\r\n"But he will be hard," retorted Shirley; "and so will your uncle."\r\n\r\nAs they hurried along the meadow and plantation path to Fieldhead, they\r\nsaw the distant highway already alive with an unwonted flow of\r\nequestrians and pedestrians, tending in the direction of the usually\r\nsolitary Hollow. On reaching the hall, they found the backyard gates\r\nopen, and the court and kitchen seemed crowded with excited\r\nmilk-fetchers--men, women, and children--whom Mrs. Gill, the\r\nhousekeeper, appeared vainly persuading to take their milk-cans and\r\ndepart. (It _is_, or _was_, by-the-bye, the custom in the north of\r\nEngland for the cottagers on a country squire\'s estate to receive their\r\nsupplies of milk and butter from the dairy of the manor house, on whose\r\npastures a herd of milch kine was usually fed for the convenience of the\r\nneighbourhood. Miss Keeldar owned such a herd--all deep-dewlapped,\r\nCraven cows, reared on the sweet herbage and clear waters of bonny\r\nAiredale; and very proud she was of their sleek aspect and high\r\ncondition.) Seeing now the state of matters, and that it was desirable\r\nto effect a clearance of the premises, Shirley stepped in amongst the\r\ngossiping groups. She bade them good-morning with a certain frank,\r\ntranquil ease--the natural characteristic of her manner when she\r\naddressed numbers, especially if those numbers belonged to the\r\nworking-class; she was cooler amongst her equals, and rather proud to\r\nthose above her. She then asked them if they had all got their milk\r\nmeasured out; and understanding that they had, she further observed that\r\nshe "wondered what they were waiting for, then."\r\n\r\n"We\'re just talking a bit over this battle there has been at your mill,\r\nmistress," replied a man.\r\n\r\n"Talking a bit! Just like you!" said Shirley. "It is a queer thing all\r\nthe world is so fond of _talking_ over events. You _talk_ if anybody\r\ndies suddenly; you _talk_ if a fire breaks out; you _talk_ if a\r\nmill-owner fails; you _talk_ if he\'s murdered. What good does your\r\ntalking do?"\r\n\r\nThere is nothing the lower orders like better than a little downright\r\ngood-humoured rating. Flattery they scorn very much; honest abuse they\r\nenjoy. They call it speaking plainly, and take a sincere delight in\r\nbeing the objects thereof. The homely harshness of Miss Keeldar\'s\r\nsalutation won her the ear of the whole throng in a second.\r\n\r\n"We\'re no war nor some \'at is aboon us, are we?" asked a man, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Nor a whit better. You that should be models of industry are just as\r\ngossip-loving as the idle. Fine, rich people that have nothing to do may\r\nbe partly excused for trifling their time away; you who have to earn\r\nyour bread with the sweat of your brow are quite inexcusable."\r\n\r\n"That\'s queer, mistress. Suld we never have a holiday because we work\r\nhard?"\r\n\r\n"_Never_," was the prompt answer; "unless," added the "mistress," with a\r\nsmile that half belied the severity of her speech--"unless you knew how\r\nto make a better use of it than to get together over rum and tea if you\r\nare women, or over beer and pipes if you are men, and _talk_ scandal at\r\nyour neighbours\' expense. Come, friends," she added, changing at once\r\nfrom bluntness to courtesy, "oblige me by taking your cans and going\r\nhome. I expect several persons to call to-day, and it will be\r\ninconvenient to have the avenues to the house crowded."\r\n\r\nYorkshire people are as yielding to persuasion as they are stubborn\r\nagainst compulsion. The yard was clear in five minutes.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, and good-bye to you, friends," said Shirley, as she closed\r\nthe gates on a quiet court.\r\n\r\nNow, let me hear the most refined of cockneys presume to find fault with\r\nYorkshire manners. Taken as they ought to be, the majority of the lads\r\nand lasses of the West Riding are gentlemen and ladies, every inch of\r\nthem. It is only against the weak affectation and futile pomposity of a\r\nwould-be aristocrat they turn mutinous.\r\n\r\nEntering by the back way, the young ladies passed through the kitchen\r\n(or _house_, as the inner kitchen is called) to the hall. Mrs. Pryor\r\ncame running down the oak staircase to meet them. She was all unnerved;\r\nher naturally sanguine complexion was pale; her usually placid, though\r\ntimid, blue eye was wandering, unsettled, alarmed. She did not, however,\r\nbreak out into any exclamations, or hurried narrative of what had\r\nhappened. Her predominant feeling had been in the course of the night,\r\nand was now this morning, a sense of dissatisfaction with herself that\r\nshe could not feel firmer, cooler, more equal to the demands of the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n"You are aware," she began with a trembling voice, and yet the most\r\nconscientious anxiety to avoid exaggeration in what she was about to\r\nsay, "that a body of rioters has attacked Mr. Moore\'s mill to-night. We\r\nheard the firing and confusion very plainly here; we none of us slept.\r\nIt was a sad night. The house has been in great bustle all the morning\r\nwith people coming and going. The servants have applied to me for orders\r\nand directions, which I really did not feel warranted in giving. Mr.\r\nMoore has, I believe, sent up for refreshments for the soldiers and\r\nothers engaged in the defence, for some conveniences also for the\r\nwounded. I could not undertake the responsibility of giving orders or\r\ntaking measures. I fear delay may have been injurious in some instances;\r\nbut this is not my house. You were absent, my dear Miss Keeldar. What\r\ncould I do?"\r\n\r\n"Were no refreshments sent?" asked Shirley, while her countenance,\r\nhitherto so clear, propitious, and quiet, even while she was rating the\r\nmilk-fetchers, suddenly turned dark and warm.\r\n\r\n"I think not, my dear."\r\n\r\n"And nothing for the wounded--no linen, no wine, no bedding?"\r\n\r\n"I think not. I cannot tell what Mrs. Gill did; but it seemed impossible\r\nto me, at the moment, to venture to dispose of your property by sending\r\nsupplies to soldiers. Provisions for a company of soldiers sounds\r\nformidable. How many there are I did not ask; but I could not think of\r\nallowing them to pillage the house, as it were. I intended to do what\r\nwas right, yet I did not see the case quite clearly, I own."\r\n\r\n"It lies in a nutshell, notwithstanding. These soldiers have risked\r\ntheir lives in defence of my property: I suppose they have a right to my\r\ngratitude. The wounded are our fellow-creatures: I suppose we should aid\r\nthem.--Mrs. Gill!"\r\n\r\nShe turned, and called in a voice more clear than soft. It rang through\r\nthe thick oak of the hall and kitchen doors more effectually than a\r\nbell\'s summons. Mrs. Gill, who was deep in bread-making, came with hands\r\nand apron in culinary case, not having dared to stop to rub the dough\r\nfrom the one or to shake the flour from the other. Her mistress had\r\nnever called a servant in that voice save once before, and that was when\r\nshe had seen from the window Tartar in full tug with two carriers\' dogs,\r\neach of them a match for him in size, if not in courage, and their\r\nmasters standing by, encouraging their animals, while hers was\r\nunbefriended. Then indeed she had summoned John as if the Day of\r\nJudgment were at hand. Nor had she waited for the said John\'s coming,\r\nbut had walked out into the lane bonnetless, and after informing the\r\ncarriers that she held them far less of men than the three brutes\r\nwhirling and worrying in the dust before them, had put her hands round\r\nthe thick neck of the largest of the curs, and given her whole strength\r\nto the essay of choking it from Tartar\'s torn and bleeding eye, just\r\nabove and below which organ the vengeful fangs were inserted. Five or\r\nsix men were presently on the spot to help her, but she never thanked\r\none of them. "They might have come before if their will had been good,"\r\nshe said. She had not a word for anybody during the rest of the day, but\r\nsat near the hall fire till evening watching and tending Tartar, who lay\r\nall gory, stiff, and swelled on a mat at her feet. She wept furtively\r\nover him sometimes, and murmured the softest words of pity and\r\nendearment, in tones whose music the old, scarred, canine warrior\r\nacknowledged by licking her hand or her sandal alternately with his own\r\nred wounds. As to John, his lady turned a cold shoulder on him for a\r\nweek afterwards.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gill, remembering this little episode, came "all of a tremble," as\r\nshe said herself. In a firm, brief voice Miss Keeldar proceeded to put\r\nquestions and give orders. That at such a time Fieldhead should have\r\nevinced the inhospitality of a miser\'s hovel stung her haughty spirit to\r\nthe quick; and the revolt of its pride was seen in the heaving of her\r\nheart, stirred stormily under the lace and silk which veiled it.\r\n\r\n"How long is it since that message came from the mill?"\r\n\r\n"Not an hour yet, ma\'am," answered the housekeeper soothingly.\r\n\r\n"Not an hour! You might almost as well have said not a day. They will\r\nhave applied elsewhere by this time. Send a man instantly down to tell\r\nthem that everything this house contains is at Mr. Moore\'s, Mr.\r\nHelstone\'s, and the soldiers\' service. Do that first."\r\n\r\nWhile the order was being executed, Shirley moved away from her friends,\r\nand stood at the hall-window, silent, unapproachable. When Mrs. Gill\r\ncame back, she turned. The purple flush which painful excitement kindles\r\non a pale cheek glowed on hers; the spark which displeasure lights in a\r\ndark eye fired her glance.\r\n\r\n"Let the contents of the larder and the wine-cellar be brought up, put\r\ninto the hay-carts, and driven down to the Hollow. If there does not\r\nhappen to be much bread or much meat in the house, go to the butcher and\r\nbaker, and desire them to send what they have. But I will see for\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\nShe moved off.\r\n\r\n"All will be right soon; she will get over it in an hour," whispered\r\nCaroline to Mrs. Pryor. "Go upstairs, dear madam," she added\r\naffectionately, "and try to be as calm and easy as you can. The truth\r\nis, Shirley will blame herself more than you before the day is over."\r\n\r\nBy dint of a few more gentle assurances and persuasions, Miss Helstone\r\ncontrived to soothe the agitated lady. Having accompanied her to her\r\napartment, and promised to rejoin her there when things were settled,\r\nCaroline left her to see, as she said, "if she could be useful." She\r\npresently found that she could be very useful; for the retinue of\r\nservants at Fieldhead was by no means numerous, and just now their\r\nmistress found plenty of occupation for all the hands at her command,\r\nand for her own also. The delicate good-nature and dexterous activity\r\nwhich Caroline brought to the aid of the housekeeper and maids--all\r\nsomewhat scared by their lady\'s unwonted mood--did a world of good at\r\nonce; it helped the assistants and appeased the directress. A chance\r\nglance and smile from Caroline moved Shirley to an answering smile\r\ndirectly. The former was carrying a heavy basket up the cellar stairs.\r\n\r\n"This is a shame!" cried Shirley, running to her. "It will strain your\r\narm."\r\n\r\nShe took it from her, and herself bore it out into the yard. The cloud\r\nof temper was dispelled when she came back; the flash in her eye was\r\nmelted; the shade on her forehead vanished. She resumed her usual\r\ncheerful and cordial manner to those about her, tempering her revived\r\nspirits with a little of the softness of shame at her previous unjust\r\nanger.\r\n\r\nShe was still superintending the lading of the cart, when a gentleman\r\nentered the yard and approached her ere she was aware of his presence.\r\n\r\n"I hope I see Miss Keeldar well this morning?" he said, examining with\r\nrather significant scrutiny her still flushed face.\r\n\r\nShe gave him a look, and then again bent to her employment without\r\nreply. A pleasant enough smile played on her lips, but she hid it. The\r\ngentleman repeated his salutation, stooping, that it might reach her ear\r\nwith more facility.\r\n\r\n"Well enough, if she be good enough," was the answer; "and so is Mr.\r\nMoore too, I dare say. To speak truth, I am not anxious about him; some\r\nslight mischance would be only his just due. His conduct has been--we\r\nwill say _strange_ just now, till we have time to characterize it by a\r\nmore exact epithet. Meantime, may I ask what brings him here?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Helstone and I have just received your message that everything at\r\nFieldhead was at our service. We judged, by the unlimited wording of the\r\ngracious intimation, that you would be giving yourself too much trouble.\r\nI perceive our conjecture was correct. We are not a regiment,\r\nremember--only about half a dozen soldiers and as many civilians. Allow\r\nme to retrench something from these too abundant supplies."\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar blushed, while she laughed at her own over-eager generosity\r\nand most disproportionate calculations. Moore laughed too, very quietly\r\nthough; and as quietly he ordered basket after basket to be taken from\r\nthe cart, and remanded vessel after vessel to the cellar.\r\n\r\n"The rector must hear of this," he said; "he will make a good story of\r\nit. What an excellent army contractor Miss Keeldar would have been!"\r\nAgain he laughed, adding, "It is precisely as I conjectured."\r\n\r\n"You ought to be thankful," said Shirley, "and not mock me. What could I\r\ndo? How could I gauge your appetites or number your band? For aught I\r\nknew, there might have been fifty of you at least to victual. You told\r\nme nothing; and then an application to provision soldiers naturally\r\nsuggests large ideas."\r\n\r\n"It appears so," remarked Moore, levelling another of his keen, quiet\r\nglances at the discomfited Shirley.--"Now," he continued, addressing the\r\ncarter, "I think you may take what remains to the Hollow. Your load will\r\nbe somewhat lighter than the one Miss Keeldar destined you to carry."\r\n\r\nAs the vehicle rumbled out of the yard, Shirley, rallying her spirits,\r\ndemanded what had become of the wounded.\r\n\r\n"There was not a single man hurt on our side," was the answer.\r\n\r\n"You were hurt yourself, on the temples," interposed a quick, low\r\nvoice--that of Caroline, who, having withdrawn within the shade of the\r\ndoor, and behind the large person of Mrs. Gill, had till now escaped\r\nMoore\'s notice. When she spoke, his eye searched the obscurity of her\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\n"Are you much hurt?" she inquired.\r\n\r\n"As you might scratch your finger with a needle in sewing."\r\n\r\n"Lift your hair and let us see."\r\n\r\nHe took his hat off, and did as he was bid, disclosing only a narrow\r\nslip of court-plaster. Caroline indicated, by a slight movement of the\r\nhead, that she was satisfied, and disappeared within the clear obscure\r\nof the interior.\r\n\r\n"How did she know I was hurt?" asked Moore.\r\n\r\n"By rumour, no doubt. But it is too good in her to trouble herself about\r\nyou. For my part, it was of your victims I was thinking when I inquired\r\nafter the wounded. What damage have your opponents sustained?"\r\n\r\n"One of the rioters, or victims as you call them, was killed, and six\r\nwere hurt."\r\n\r\n"What have you done with them?"\r\n\r\n"What you will perfectly approve. Medical aid was procured immediately;\r\nand as soon as we can get a couple of covered wagons and some clean\r\nstraw, they will be removed to Stilbro\'."\r\n\r\n"Straw! You must have beds and bedding. I will send my wagon directly,\r\nproperly furnished; and Mr. Yorke, I am sure, will send his."\r\n\r\n"You guess correctly; he has volunteered already. And Mrs. Yorke--who,\r\nlike you, seems disposed to regard the rioters as martyrs, and me, and\r\nespecially Mr. Helstone, as murderers--is at this moment, I believe,\r\nmost assiduously engaged in fitting it up with feather-beds, pillows,\r\nbolsters, blankets, etc. The _victims_ lack no attentions, I promise\r\nyou. Mr. Hall, your favourite parson, has been with them ever since six\r\no\'clock, exhorting them, praying with them, and even waiting on them\r\nlike any nurse; and Caroline\'s good friend, Miss Ainley, that _very_\r\nplain old maid, sent in a stock of lint and linen, something in the\r\nproportion of another lady\'s allowance of beef and wine."\r\n\r\n"That will do. Where is your sister?"\r\n\r\n"Well cared for. I had her securely domiciled with Miss Mann. This very\r\nmorning the two set out for Wormwood Wells [a noted watering-place],\r\nand will stay there some weeks."\r\n\r\n"So Mr. Helstone domiciled me at the rectory! Mighty clever you\r\ngentlemen think you are! I make you heartily welcome to the idea, and\r\nhope its savour, as you chew the cud of reflection upon it, gives you\r\npleasure. Acute and astute, why are you not also omniscient? How is it\r\nthat events transpire, under your very noses, of which you have no\r\nsuspicion? It should be so, otherwise the exquisite gratification of\r\noutmanoeuvring you would be unknown. Ah, friend, you may search my\r\ncountenance, but you cannot read it."\r\n\r\nMoore, indeed, looked as if he could not.\r\n\r\n"You think me a dangerous specimen of my sex. Don\'t you now?"\r\n\r\n"A peculiar one, at least."\r\n\r\n"But Caroline--is she peculiar?"\r\n\r\n"In her way--yes."\r\n\r\n"Her way! What is her way?"\r\n\r\n"You know her as well as I do."\r\n\r\n"And knowing her, I assert that she is neither eccentric nor difficult\r\nof control. Is she?"\r\n\r\n"That depends----"\r\n\r\n"However, there is nothing masculine about _her_?"\r\n\r\n"Why lay such emphasis on _her_? Do you consider her a contrast, in that\r\nrespect, to yourself?"\r\n\r\n"You do, no doubt; but that does not signify. Caroline is neither\r\nmasculine, nor of what they call the spirited order of women."\r\n\r\n"I have seen her flash out."\r\n\r\n"So have I, but not with manly fire. It was a short, vivid, trembling\r\nglow, that shot up, shone, vanished----"\r\n\r\n"And left her scared at her own daring. You describe others besides\r\nCaroline."\r\n\r\n"The point I wish to establish is, that Miss Helstone, though gentle,\r\ntractable, and candid enough, is still perfectly capable of defying even\r\nMr. Moore\'s penetration."\r\n\r\n"What have you and she been doing?" asked Moore suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Have you had any breakfast?"\r\n\r\n"What is your mutual mystery?"\r\n\r\n"If you are hungry, Mrs. Gill will give you something to eat here. Step\r\ninto the oak parlour, and ring the bell. You will be served as if at an\r\ninn; or, if you like better, go back to the Hollow."\r\n\r\n"The alternative is not open to me; I _must_ go back. Good-morning. The\r\nfirst leisure I have I will see you again."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nMRS. PRYOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Shirley was talking with Moore, Caroline rejoined Mrs. Pryor\r\nupstairs. She found that lady deeply depressed. She would not say that\r\nMiss Keeldar\'s hastiness had hurt her feelings, but it was evident an\r\ninward wound galled her. To any but a congenial nature she would have\r\nseemed insensible to the quiet, tender attentions by which Miss Helstone\r\nsought to impart solace; but Caroline knew that, unmoved or slightly\r\nmoved as she looked, she felt, valued, and was healed by them.\r\n\r\n"I am deficient in self-confidence and decision," she said at last. "I\r\nalways have been deficient in those qualities. Yet I think Miss Keeldar\r\nshould have known my character well enough by this time to be aware that\r\nI always feel an even painful solicitude to do right, to act for the\r\nbest. The unusual nature of the demand on my judgment puzzled me,\r\nespecially following the alarms of the night. I could not venture to act\r\npromptly for another; but I trust no serious harm will result from my\r\nlapse of firmness."\r\n\r\nA gentle knock was here heard at the door. It was half opened.\r\n\r\n"Caroline, come here," said a low voice.\r\n\r\nMiss Helstone went out. There stood Shirley in the gallery, looking\r\ncontrite, ashamed, sorry as any repentant child.\r\n\r\n"How is Mrs. Pryor?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Rather out of spirits," said Caroline.\r\n\r\n"I have behaved very shamefully, very ungenerously, very ungratefully to\r\nher," said Shirley. "How insolent in me to turn on her thus for what,\r\nafter all, was no fault--only an excess of conscientiousness on her\r\npart. But I regret my error most sincerely. Tell her so, and ask if she\r\nwill forgive me."\r\n\r\nCaroline discharged the errand with heartfelt pleasure. Mrs. Pryor rose,\r\ncame to the door. She did not like scenes; she dreaded them as all\r\ntimid people do. She said falteringly, "Come in, my dear."\r\n\r\nShirley did come in with some impetuosity. She threw her arms round her\r\ngoverness, and while she kissed her heartily she said, "You know you\r\n_must_ forgive me, Mrs. Pryor. I could not get on at all if there was a\r\nmisunderstanding between you and me."\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to forgive," was the reply. "We will pass it over now,\r\nif you please. The final result of the incident is that it proves more\r\nplainly than ever how unequal I am to certain crises."\r\n\r\nAnd that was the painful feeling which _would_ remain on Mrs. Pryor\'s\r\nmind. No effort of Shirley\'s or Caroline\'s could efface it thence. She\r\ncould forgive her offending pupil, not her innocent self.\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar, doomed to be in constant request during the morning, was\r\npresently summoned downstairs again. The rector called first. A lively\r\nwelcome and livelier reprimand were at his service. He expected both,\r\nand, being in high spirits, took them in equally good part.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his brief visit he quite forgot to ask after his niece;\r\nthe riot, the rioters, the mill, the magistrates, the heiress, absorbed\r\nall his thoughts to the exclusion of family ties. He alluded to the part\r\nhimself and curate had taken in the defence of the Hollow.\r\n\r\n"The vials of pharisaical wrath will be emptied on our heads for our\r\nshare in this business," he said; "but I defy every calumniator. I was\r\nthere only to support the law, to play my part as a man and a Briton;\r\nwhich characters I deem quite compatible with those of the priest and\r\nLevite, in their highest sense. Your tenant Moore," he went on, "has won\r\nmy approbation. A cooler commander I would not wish to see, nor a more\r\ndetermined. Besides, the man has shown sound judgment and good\r\nsense--first, in being thoroughly prepared for the event which has taken\r\nplace; and subsequently, when his well-concerted plans had secured him\r\nsuccess, in knowing how to use without abusing his victory. Some of the\r\nmagistrates are now well frightened, and, like all cowards, show a\r\ntendency to be cruel. Moore restrains them with admirable prudence. He\r\nhas hitherto been very unpopular in the neighbourhood; but, mark my\r\nwords, the tide of opinion will now take a turn in his favour. People\r\nwill find out that they have not appreciated him, and will hasten to\r\nremedy their error; and he, when he perceives the public disposed to\r\nacknowledge his merits, will show a more gracious mien than that with\r\nwhich he has hitherto favoured us."\r\n\r\nMr. Helstone was about to add to this speech some half-jesting,\r\nhalf-serious warnings to Miss Keeldar on the subject of her rumoured\r\npartiality for her talented tenant, when a ring at the door, announcing\r\nanother caller, checked his raillery; and as that other caller appeared\r\nin the form of a white-haired elderly gentleman, with a rather truculent\r\ncountenance and disdainful eye--in short, our old acquaintance, and the\r\nrector\'s old enemy, Mr. Yorke--the priest and Levite seized his hat, and\r\nwith the briefest of adieus to Miss Keeldar and the sternest of nods to\r\nher guest took an abrupt leave.\r\n\r\nMr. Yorke was in no mild mood, and in no measured terms did he express\r\nhis opinion on the transaction of the night. Moore, the magistrates, the\r\nsoldiers, the mob leaders, each and all came in for a share of his\r\ninvectives; but he reserved his strongest epithets--and real racy\r\nYorkshire Doric adjectives they were--for the benefit of the fighting\r\nparsons, the "sanguinary, demoniac" rector and curate. According to him,\r\nthe cup of ecclesiastical guilt was now full indeed.\r\n\r\n"The church," he said, "was in a bonny pickle now. It was time it came\r\ndown when parsons took to swaggering amang soldiers, blazing away wi\'\r\nbullet and gunpowder, taking the lives of far honester men than\r\nthemselves."\r\n\r\n"What would Moore have done if nobody had helped him?" asked Shirley.\r\n\r\n"Drunk as he\'d brewed, eaten as he\'d baked."\r\n\r\n"Which means you would have left him by himself to face that mob. Good!\r\nHe has plenty of courage, but the greatest amount of gallantry that ever\r\ngarrisoned one human breast could scarce avail against two hundred."\r\n\r\n"He had the soldiers, those poor slaves who hire out their own blood and\r\nspill other folk\'s for money."\r\n\r\n"You abuse soldiers almost as much as you abuse clergymen. All who wear\r\nred coats are national refuse in your eyes, and all who wear black are\r\nnational swindlers. Mr. Moore, according to you, did wrong to get\r\nmilitary aid, and he did still worse to accept of any other aid. Your\r\nway of talking amounts to this: he should have abandoned his mill and\r\nhis life to the rage of a set of misguided madmen, and Mr. Helstone and\r\nevery other gentleman in the parish should have looked on, and seen the\r\nbuilding razed and its owner slaughtered, and never stirred a finger to\r\nsave either."\r\n\r\n"If Moore had behaved to his men from the beginning as a master ought to\r\nbehave, they never would have entertained their present feelings towards\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Easy for you to talk," exclaimed Miss Keeldar, who was beginning to wax\r\nwarm in her tenant\'s cause--"you, whose family have lived at Briarmains\r\nfor six generations, to whose person the people have been accustomed for\r\nfifty years, who know all their ways, prejudices, and preferences--easy,\r\nindeed, for _you_ to act so as to avoid offending them. But Mr. Moore\r\ncame a stranger into the district; he came here poor and friendless,\r\nwith nothing but his own energies to back him, nothing but his honour,\r\nhis talent, and his industry to make his way for him. A monstrous crime\r\nindeed that, under such circumstances, he could not popularize his\r\nnaturally grave, quiet manners all at once; could not be jocular, and\r\nfree, and cordial with a strange peasantry, as you are with your\r\nfellow-townsmen! An unpardonable transgression that when he introduced\r\nimprovements he did not go about the business in quite the most politic\r\nway, did not graduate his changes as delicately as a rich capitalist\r\nmight have done! For errors of this sort is he to be the victim of mob\r\noutrage? Is he to be denied even the privilege of defending himself? Are\r\nthose who have the hearts of men in their breasts (and Mr. Helstone, say\r\nwhat you will of him, has such a heart) to be reviled like malefactors\r\nbecause they stand by him, because they venture to espouse the cause of\r\none against two hundred?"\r\n\r\n"Come, come now, be cool," said Mr. Yorke, smiling at the earnestness\r\nwith which Shirley multiplied her rapid questions.\r\n\r\n"Cool! Must I listen coolly to downright nonsense--to dangerous\r\nnonsense? No. I like you very well, Mr. Yorke, as you know, but I\r\nthoroughly dislike some of your principles. All that cant--excuse me,\r\nbut I repeat the word--all that _cant_ about soldiers and parsons is\r\nmost offensive in my ears. All ridiculous, irrational crying up of one\r\nclass, whether the same be aristocrat or democrat--all howling down of\r\nanother class, whether clerical or military--all exacting injustice to\r\nindividuals, whether monarch or mendicant--is really sickening to me;\r\nall arraying of ranks against ranks, all party hatreds, all tyrannies\r\ndisguised as liberties, I reject and wash my hands of. _You_ think you\r\nare a philanthropist; _you_ think you are an advocate of liberty; but I\r\nwill tell you this--Mr. Hall, the parson of Nunnely, is a better friend\r\nboth of man and freedom than Hiram Yorke, the reformer of Briarfield."\r\n\r\nFrom a man Mr. Yorke would not have borne this language very patiently,\r\nnor would he have endured it from some women; but he accounted Shirley\r\nboth honest and pretty, and her plain-spoken ire amused him. Besides, he\r\ntook a secret pleasure in hearing her defend her tenant, for we have\r\nalready intimated he had Robert Moore\'s interest very much at heart.\r\nMoreover, if he wished to avenge himself for her severity, he knew the\r\nmeans lay in his power: a word, he believed, would suffice to tame and\r\nsilence her, to cover her frank forehead with the rosy shadow of shame,\r\nand veil the glow of her eye under down-drooped lid and lash.\r\n\r\n"What more hast thou to say?" he inquired, as she paused, rather, it\r\nappeared, to take breath than because her subject or her zeal was\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\n"Say, Mr. Yorke!" was the answer, the speaker meantime walking fast from\r\nwall to wall of the oak parlour--"say? I have a great deal to say, if I\r\ncould get it out in lucid order, which I never _can_ do. I have to say\r\nthat your views, and those of most extreme politicians, are such as none\r\nbut men in an irresponsible position _can_ advocate; that they are\r\npurely opposition views, meant only to be talked about, and never\r\nintended to be acted on. Make you Prime Minister of England to-morrow,\r\nand you would have to abandon them. You abuse Moore for defending his\r\nmill. Had you been in Moore\'s place you could not with honour or sense\r\nhave acted otherwise than he acted. You abuse Mr. Helstone for\r\neverything he does. Mr. Helstone has his faults; he sometimes does\r\nwrong, but oftener right. Were you ordained vicar of Briarfield, you\r\nwould find it no easy task to sustain all the active schemes for the\r\nbenefit of the parish planned and persevered in by your predecessor. I\r\nwonder people cannot judge more fairly of each other and themselves.\r\nWhen I hear Messrs. Malone and Donne chatter about the authority of the\r\nchurch, the dignity and claims of the priesthood, the deference due to\r\nthem as clergymen; when I hear the outbreaks of their small spite\r\nagainst Dissenters; when I witness their silly, narrow jealousies and\r\nassumptions; when their palaver about forms, and traditions, and\r\nsuperstitions is sounding in my ear; when I behold their insolent\r\ncarriage to the poor, their often base servility to the rich--I think\r\nthe Establishment is indeed in a poor way, and both she and her sons\r\nappear in the utmost need of reformation. Turning away distressed from\r\nminster tower and village spire--ay, as distressed as a churchwarden who\r\nfeels the exigence of white-wash and has not wherewithal to purchase\r\nlime--I recall your senseless sarcasms on the \'fat bishops,\' the\r\n\'pampered parsons,\' \'old mother church,\' etc. I remember your strictures\r\non all who differ from you, your sweeping condemnation of classes and\r\nindividuals, without the slightest allowance made for circumstances or\r\ntemptations; and then, Mr. Yorke, doubt clutches my inmost heart as to\r\nwhether men exist clement, reasonable, and just enough to be entrusted\r\nwith the task of reform. I don\'t believe _you_ are of the number."\r\n\r\n"You have an ill opinion of me, Miss Shirley. You never told me so much\r\nof your mind before."\r\n\r\n"I never had an opening. But I have sat on Jessy\'s stool by your chair\r\nin the back-parlour at Briarmains, for evenings together, listening\r\nexcitedly to your talk, half admiring what you said, and half rebelling\r\nagainst it. I think you a fine old Yorkshireman, sir. I am proud to have\r\nbeen born in the same county and parish as yourself. Truthful, upright,\r\nindependent you are, as a rock based below seas; but also you are harsh,\r\nrude, narrow, and merciless."\r\n\r\n"Not to the poor, lass, nor to the meek of the earth; only to the proud\r\nand high-minded."\r\n\r\n"And what right have you, sir, to make such distinctions? A prouder, a\r\nhigher-minded man than yourself does not exist. You find it easy to\r\nspeak comfortably to your inferiors; you are too haughty, too ambitious,\r\ntoo jealous to be civil to those above you. But you are all alike.\r\nHelstone also is proud and prejudiced. Moore, though juster and more\r\nconsiderate than either you or the rector, is still haughty, stern, and,\r\nin a public sense, selfish. It is well there are such men as Mr. Hall to\r\nbe found occasionally--men of large and kind hearts, who can love their\r\nwhole race, who can forgive others for being richer, more prosperous, or\r\nmore powerful than they are. Such men may have less originality, less\r\nforce of character than you, but they are better friends to mankind."\r\n\r\n"And when is it to be?" said Mr. Yorke, now rising.\r\n\r\n"When is what to be?"\r\n\r\n"The wedding."\r\n\r\n"Whose wedding?"\r\n\r\n"Only that of Robert G\xc3\xa9rard Moore, Esq., of Hollow\'s Cottage, with Miss\r\nKeeldar, daughter and heiress of the late Charles Cave Keeldar of\r\nFieldhead Hall."\r\n\r\nShirley gazed at the questioner with rising colour. But the light in her\r\neye was not faltering; it shone steadily--yes, it burned deeply.\r\n\r\n"That is your revenge," she said slowly; then added, "Would it be a bad\r\nmatch, unworthy of the late Charles Cave Keeldar\'s representative?"\r\n\r\n"My lass, Moore is a gentleman; his blood is pure and ancient as mine or\r\nthine."\r\n\r\n"And we two set store by ancient blood? We have family pride, though one\r\nof us at least is a republican?"\r\n\r\nYorke bowed as he stood before her. His lips were mute, but his eye\r\nconfessed the impeachment. Yes, he had family pride; you saw it in his\r\nwhole bearing.\r\n\r\n"Moore _is_ a gentleman," echoed Shirley, lifting her head with glad\r\ngrace. She checked herself. Words seemed crowding to her tongue. She\r\nwould not give them utterance; but her look spoke much at the moment.\r\nWhat, Yorke tried to read, but could not. The language was there,\r\nvisible, but untranslatable--a poem, a fervid lyric, in an unknown\r\ntongue. It was not a plain story, however, no simple gush of feeling, no\r\nordinary love-confession--that was obvious. It was something other,\r\ndeeper, more intricate than he guessed at. He felt his revenge had not\r\nstruck home. He felt that Shirley triumphed. She held him at fault,\r\nbaffled, puzzled. _She_ enjoyed the moment, not _he_.\r\n\r\n"And if Moore _is_ a gentleman, you _can_ be only a lady; therefore----"\r\n\r\n"Therefore there would be no inequality in our union."\r\n\r\n"None."\r\n\r\n"Thank you for your approbation. Will you give me away when I relinquish\r\nthe name of Keeldar for that of Moore?"\r\n\r\nMr. Yorke, instead of replying, gazed at her much puzzled. He could not\r\ndivine what her look signified--whether she spoke in earnest or in jest.\r\nThere were purpose and feeling, banter and scoff, playing, mingled, on\r\nher mobile lineaments.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand thee," he said, turning away.\r\n\r\nShe laughed. "Take courage, sir; you are not singular in your ignorance.\r\nBut I suppose if Moore understands me that will do, will it not?"\r\n\r\n"Moore may settle his own matters henceforward for me; I\'ll neither\r\nmeddle nor make with them further."\r\n\r\nA new thought crossed her. Her countenance changed magically. With a\r\nsudden darkening of the eye and austere fixing of the features she\r\ndemanded, "Have you been asked to interfere? Are you questioning me as\r\nanother\'s proxy?"\r\n\r\n"The Lord save us! Whoever weds thee must look about him! Keep all your\r\nquestions for Robert; I\'ll answer no more on \'em. Good-day, lassie!"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe day being fine, or at least fair--for soft clouds curtained the sun,\r\nand a dim but not chill or waterish haze slept blue on the\r\nhills--Caroline, while Shirley was engaged with her callers, had\r\npersuaded Mrs. Pryor to assume her bonnet and summer shawl, and to take\r\na walk with her up towards the narrow end of the Hollow.\r\n\r\nHere the opposing sides of the glen, approaching each other and becoming\r\nclothed with brushwood and stunted oaks, formed a wooded ravine, at the\r\nbottom of which ran the mill-stream, in broken, unquiet course,\r\nstruggling with many stones, chafing against rugged banks, fretting with\r\ngnarled tree-roots, foaming, gurgling, battling as it went. Here, when\r\nyou had wandered half a mile from the mill, you found a sense of deep\r\nsolitude--found it in the shade of unmolested trees, received it in the\r\nsinging of many birds, for which that shade made a home. This was no\r\ntrodden way. The freshness of the wood flowers attested that foot of man\r\nseldom pressed them; the abounding wild roses looked as if they budded,\r\nbloomed, and faded under the watch of solitude, as if in a sultan\'s\r\nharem. Here you saw the sweet azure of blue-bells, and recognized in\r\npearl-white blossoms, spangling the grass, a humble type of some starlit\r\nspot in space.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor liked a quiet walk. She ever shunned high-roads, and sought\r\nbyways and lonely lanes. One companion she preferred to total solitude,\r\nfor in solitude she was nervous; a vague fear of annoying encounters\r\nbroke the enjoyment of quite lonely rambles. But she feared nothing with\r\nCaroline. When once she got away from human habitations, and entered\r\nthe still demesne of nature accompanied by this one youthful friend, a\r\npropitious change seemed to steal over her mind and beam in her\r\ncountenance. When with Caroline--and Caroline only--her heart, you would\r\nhave said, shook off a burden, her brow put aside a veil, her spirits\r\ntoo escaped from a restraint. With her she was cheerful; with her, at\r\ntimes, she was tender; to her she would impart her knowledge, reveal\r\nglimpses of her experience, give her opportunities for guessing what\r\nlife she had lived, what cultivation her mind had received, of what\r\ncalibre was her intelligence, how and where her feelings were\r\nvulnerable.\r\n\r\nTo-day, for instance, as they walked along, Mrs. Pryor talked to her\r\ncompanion about the various birds singing in the trees, discriminated\r\ntheir species, and said something about their habits and peculiarities.\r\nEnglish natural history seemed familiar to her. All the wild flowers\r\nround their path were recognized by her; tiny plants springing near\r\nstones and peeping out of chinks in old walls--plants such as Caroline\r\nhad scarcely noticed before--received a name and an intimation of their\r\nproperties. It appeared that she had minutely studied the botany of\r\nEnglish fields and woods. Having reached the head of the ravine, they\r\nsat down together on a ledge of gray and mossy rock jutting from the\r\nbase of a steep green hill which towered above them. She looked round\r\nher, and spoke of the neighbourhood as she had once before seen it long\r\nago. She alluded to its changes, and compared its aspect with that of\r\nother parts of England, revealing in quiet, unconscious touches of\r\ndescription a sense of the picturesque, an appreciation of the beautiful\r\nor commonplace, a power of comparing the wild with the cultured, the\r\ngrand with the tame, that gave to her discourse a graphic charm as\r\npleasant as it was unpretending.\r\n\r\nThe sort of reverent pleasure with which Caroline listened--so sincere,\r\nso quiet, yet so evident--stirred the elder lady\'s faculties to gentle\r\nanimation. Rarely, probably, had she, with her chill, repellent outside,\r\nher diffident mien, and incommunicative habits, known what it was to\r\nexcite in one whom she herself could love feelings of earnest affection\r\nand admiring esteem. Delightful, doubtless, was the consciousness that a\r\nyoung girl towards whom it seemed, judging by the moved expression of\r\nher eyes and features, her heart turned with almost a fond impulse,\r\nlooked up to her as an instructor, and clung to her as a friend. With a\r\nsomewhat more marked accent of interest than she often permitted herself\r\nto use, she said, as she bent towards her youthful companion, and put\r\naside from her forehead a pale brown curl which had strayed from the\r\nconfining comb, "I do hope this sweet air blowing from the hill will do\r\nyou good, my dear Caroline. I wish I could see something more of colour\r\nin these cheeks; but perhaps you were never florid?"\r\n\r\n"I had red cheeks once," returned Miss Helstone, smiling. "I remember a\r\nyear--two years ago--when I used to look in the glass, I saw a different\r\nface there to what I see now--rounder and rosier. But when we are\r\nyoung," added the girl of eighteen, "our minds are careless and our\r\nlives easy."\r\n\r\n"Do you," continued Mrs. Pryor, mastering by an effort that tyrant\r\ntimidity which made it difficult for her, even under present\r\ncircumstances, to attempt the scrutiny of another\'s heart--"do you, at\r\nyour age, fret yourself with cares for the future? Believe me, you had\r\nbetter not. Let the morrow take thought for the things of itself."\r\n\r\n"True, dear madam. It is not over the future I pine. The evil of the day\r\nis sometimes oppressive--too oppressive--and I long to escape it."\r\n\r\n"That is--the evil of the day--that is--your uncle perhaps is not--you\r\nfind it difficult to understand--he does not appreciate----"\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor could not complete her broken sentences; she could not manage\r\nto put the question whether Mr. Helstone was too harsh with his niece.\r\nBut Caroline comprehended.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that is nothing," she replied. "My uncle and I get on very well. We\r\nnever quarrel--I don\'t call him harsh--he never scolds me. Sometimes I\r\nwish somebody in the world loved me, but I cannot say that I\r\nparticularly wish him to have more affection for me than he has. As a\r\nchild, I should perhaps have felt the want of attention, only the\r\nservants were very kind to me; but when people are long indifferent to\r\nus, we grow indifferent to their indifference. It is my uncle\'s way not\r\nto care for women and girls, unless they be ladies that he meets in\r\ncompany. He could not alter, and I have no wish that he should alter, as\r\nfar as I am concerned. I believe it would merely annoy and frighten me\r\nwere he to be affectionate towards me now. But you know, Mrs. Pryor, it\r\nis scarcely _living_ to measure time as I do at the rectory. The hours\r\npass, and I get them over somehow, but I do not _live_. I endure\r\nexistence, but I rarely enjoy it. Since Miss Keeldar and you came I have\r\nbeen--I was going to say happier, but that would be untrue." She paused.\r\n\r\n"How untrue? You are fond of Miss Keeldar, are you not, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Very fond of Shirley. I both like and admire her. But I am painfully\r\ncircumstanced. For a reason I cannot explain I want to go away from this\r\nplace, and to forget it."\r\n\r\n"You told me before you wished to be a governess; but, my dear, if you\r\nremember, I did not encourage the idea. I have been a governess myself\r\ngreat part of my life. In Miss Keeldar\'s acquaintance I esteem myself\r\nmost fortunate. Her talents and her really sweet disposition have\r\nrendered my office easy to me; but when I was young, before I married,\r\nmy trials were severe, poignant. I should not like a---- I should not\r\nlike you to endure similar ones. It was my lot to enter a family of\r\nconsiderable pretensions to good birth and mental superiority, and the\r\nmembers of which also believed that \'on them was perceptible\' an unusual\r\nendowment of the \'Christian graces;\' that all their hearts were\r\nregenerate, and their spirits in a peculiar state of discipline. I was\r\nearly given to understand that \'as I was not their equal,\' so I could\r\nnot expect \'to have their sympathy.\' It was in no sort concealed from me\r\nthat I was held a \'burden and a restraint in society.\' The gentlemen, I\r\nfound, regarded me as a \'tabooed woman,\' to whom \'they were interdicted\r\nfrom granting the usual privileges of the sex,\' and yet \'who annoyed\r\nthem by frequently crossing their path.\' The ladies too made it plain\r\nthat they thought me \'a bore.\' The servants, it was signified, \'detested\r\nme;\' _why_, I could never clearly comprehend. My pupils, I was told,\r\n\'however much they might love me, and how deep soever the interest I\r\nmight take in them, could not be my friends.\' It was intimated that I\r\nmust \'live alone, and never transgress the invisible but rigid line\r\nwhich established the difference between me and my employers.\' My life\r\nin this house was sedentary, solitary, constrained, joyless, toilsome.\r\nThe dreadful crushing of the animal spirits, the ever-prevailing sense\r\nof friendlessness and homelessness consequent on this state of things\r\nbegan ere long to produce mortal effects on my constitution. I sickened.\r\nThe lady of the house told me coolly I was the victim of \'wounded\r\nvanity.\' She hinted that if I did not make an effort to quell my\r\n\'ungodly discontent,\' to cease \'murmuring against God\'s appointment,\'\r\nand to cultivate the profound humility befitting my station, my mind\r\nwould very likely \'go to pieces\' on the rock that wrecked most of my\r\nsisterhood--morbid self-esteem--and that I should die an inmate of a\r\nlunatic asylum.\r\n\r\n"I said nothing to Mrs. Hardman--it would have been useless; but to her\r\neldest daughter I one day dropped a few observations, which were\r\nanswered thus. There were hardships, she allowed, in the position of a\r\ngoverness. \'Doubtless they had their trials; but,\' she averred, with a\r\nmanner it makes me smile now to recall--\'but it must be so. _She_\' (Miss\r\nH.) \'had neither view, hope, nor _wish_ to see these things remedied;\r\nfor in the inherent constitution of English habits, feelings, and\r\nprejudices there was no possibility that they should be. Governesses,\'\r\nshe observed, \'must ever be kept in a sort of isolation. It is the only\r\nmeans of maintaining that distance which the reserve of English manners\r\nand the decorum of English families exact.\'\r\n\r\n"I remember I sighed as Miss Hardman quitted my bedside. She caught the\r\nsound, and turning, said severely, \'I fear, Miss Grey, you have\r\ninherited in fullest measure the worst sin of our fallen nature--the sin\r\nof pride. You are proud, and therefore you are ungrateful too. Mamma\r\npays you a handsome salary, and if you had average sense you would\r\nthankfully put up with much that is fatiguing to do and irksome to bear,\r\nsince it is so well made worth your while.\'\r\n\r\n"Miss Hardman, my love, was a very strong-minded young lady, of most\r\ndistinguished talents. The aristocracy are decidedly a very superior\r\nclass, you know, both physically, and morally, and mentally; as a high\r\nTory I acknowledge that. I could not describe the dignity of her voice\r\nand mien as she addressed me thus; still, I fear she was selfish, my\r\ndear. I would never wish to speak ill of my superiors in rank, but I\r\nthink she was a little selfish."\r\n\r\n"I remember," continued Mrs. Pryor, after a pause, "another of Miss H.\'s\r\nobservations, which she would utter with quite a grand air. \'WE,\' she\r\nwould say--\'WE need the imprudences, extravagances, mistakes, and crimes\r\nof a certain number of fathers to sow the seed from which WE reap the\r\nharvest of governesses. The daughters of trades-people, however well\r\neducated, must necessarily be underbred, and as such unfit to be\r\ninmates of OUR dwellings, or guardians of OUR children\'s minds and\r\npersons. WE shall ever prefer to place those about OUR offspring who\r\nhave been born and bred with somewhat of the same refinement as\r\nOURSELVES.\'"\r\n\r\n"Miss Hardman must have thought herself something better than her\r\nfellow-creatures, ma\'am, since she held that their calamities, and even\r\ncrimes, were necessary to minister to her convenience. You say she was\r\nreligious. Her religion must have been that of the Pharisee who thanked\r\nGod that he was not as other men are, nor even as that publican."\r\n\r\n"My dear, we will not discuss the point. I should be the last person to\r\nwish to instil into your mind any feeling of dissatisfaction with your\r\nlot in life, or any sentiment of envy or insubordination towards your\r\nsuperiors. Implicit submission to authorities, scrupulous deference to\r\nour betters (under which term I, of course, include the higher classes\r\nof society), are, in my opinion, indispensable to the well-being of\r\nevery community. All I mean to say, my dear, is that you had better not\r\nattempt to be a governess, as the duties of the position would be too\r\nsevere for your constitution. Not one word of disrespect would I breathe\r\ntowards either Mrs. or Miss Hardman; only, recalling my own experience,\r\nI cannot but feel that, were you to fall under auspices such as theirs,\r\nyou would contend a while courageously with your doom, then you would\r\npine and grow too weak for your work; you would come home--if you still\r\nhad a home--broken down. Those languishing years would follow of which\r\nnone but the invalid and her immediate friends feel the heart-sickness\r\nand know the burden. Consumption or decline would close the chapter.\r\nSuch is the history of many a life. I would not have it yours. My dear,\r\nwe will now walk about a little, if you please."\r\n\r\nThey both rose, and slowly paced a green natural terrace bordering the\r\nchasm.\r\n\r\n"My dear," ere long again began Mrs. Pryor, a sort of timid, embarrassed\r\nabruptness marking her manner as she spoke, "the young, especially those\r\nto whom nature has been favourable, often--frequently--anticipate--look\r\nforward to--to marriage as the end, the goal of their hopes."\r\n\r\nAnd she stopped. Caroline came to her relief with promptitude, showing a\r\ngreat deal more self-possession and courage than herself on the\r\nformidable topic now broached.\r\n\r\n"They do, and naturally," she replied, with a calm emphasis that\r\nstartled Mrs. Pryor. "They look forward to marriage with some one they\r\nlove as the brightest, the only bright destiny that can await them. Are\r\nthey wrong?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear!" exclaimed Mrs. Pryor, clasping her hands; and again she\r\npaused. Caroline turned a searching, an eager eye on the face of her\r\nfriend: that face was much agitated. "My dear," she murmured, "life is\r\nan illusion."\r\n\r\n"But not love! Love is real--the most real, the most lasting, the\r\nsweetest and yet the bitterest thing we know."\r\n\r\n"My dear, it is very bitter. It is said to be strong--strong as death!\r\nMost of the cheats of existence are strong. As to their sweetness,\r\nnothing is so transitory; its date is a moment, the twinkling of an eye.\r\nThe sting remains for ever. It may perish with the dawn of eternity, but\r\nit tortures through time into its deepest night."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it tortures through time," agreed Caroline, "except when it is\r\nmutual love."\r\n\r\n"Mutual love! My dear, romances are pernicious. You do not read them, I\r\nhope?"\r\n\r\n"Sometimes--whenever I can get them, indeed. But romance-writers might\r\nknow nothing of love, judging by the way in which they treat of it."\r\n\r\n"Nothing whatever, my dear," assented Mrs. Pryor eagerly, "nor of\r\nmarriage; and the false pictures they give of those subjects cannot be\r\ntoo strongly condemned. They are not like reality. They show you only\r\nthe green, tempting surface of the marsh, and give not one faithful or\r\ntruthful hint of the slough underneath."\r\n\r\n"But it is not always slough," objected Caroline. "There are happy\r\nmarriages. Where affection is reciprocal and sincere, and minds are\r\nharmonious, marriage _must_ be happy."\r\n\r\n"It is never wholly happy. Two people can never literally be as one.\r\nThere is, perhaps, a possibility of content under peculiar\r\ncircumstances, such as are seldom combined; but it is as well not to run\r\nthe risk--you may make fatal mistakes. Be satisfied, my dear. Let all\r\nthe single be satisfied with their freedom."\r\n\r\n"You echo my uncle\'s words!" exclaimed Caroline, in a tone of dismay.\r\n"You speak like Mrs. Yorke in her most gloomy moments, like Miss Mann\r\nwhen she is most sourly and hypochondriacally disposed. This is\r\nterrible!"\r\n\r\n"No, it is only true. O child, you have only lived the pleasant morning\r\ntime of life; the hot, weary noon, the sad evening, the sunless night,\r\nare yet to come for you. Mr. Helstone, you say, talks as I talk; and I\r\nwonder how Mrs. Matthewson Helstone would have talked had she been\r\nliving. She died! she died!"\r\n\r\n"And, alas! my own mother and father----" exclaimed Caroline, struck by\r\na sombre recollection.\r\n\r\n"What of them?"\r\n\r\n"Did I never tell you that they were separated?"\r\n\r\n"I have heard it."\r\n\r\n"They must, then, have been very miserable."\r\n\r\n"You see all _facts_ go to prove what I say."\r\n\r\n"In this case there ought to be no such thing as marriage."\r\n\r\n"There ought, my dear, were it only to prove that this life is a mere\r\nstate of probation, wherein neither rest nor recompense is to be\r\nvouchsafed."\r\n\r\n"But your own marriage, Mrs. Pryor?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor shrank and shuddered as if a rude finger had pressed a naked\r\nnerve. Caroline felt she had touched what would not bear the slightest\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\n"My marriage was unhappy," said the lady, summoning courage at last;\r\n"but yet----" She hesitated.\r\n\r\n"But yet," suggested Caroline, "not immitigably wretched?"\r\n\r\n"Not in its results, at least. No," she added, in a softer tone; "God\r\nmingles something of the balm of mercy even in vials of the most\r\ncorrosive woe. He can so turn events that from the very same blind, rash\r\nact whence sprang the curse of half our life may flow the blessing of\r\nthe remainder. Then I am of a peculiar disposition--I own that--far from\r\nfacile, without address, in some points eccentric. I ought never to have\r\nmarried. Mine is not the nature easily to find a duplicate or likely to\r\nassimilate with a contrast. I was quite aware of my own ineligibility;\r\nand if I had not been so miserable as a governess, I never should have\r\nmarried; and then----"\r\n\r\nCaroline\'s eyes asked her to proceed. They entreated her to break the\r\nthick cloud of despair which her previous words had seemed to spread\r\nover life.\r\n\r\n"And then, my dear, Mr.--that is, the gentleman I married--was, perhaps,\r\nrather an exceptional than an average character. I hope, at least, the\r\nexperience of few has been such as mine was, or that few have felt their\r\nsufferings as I felt mine. They nearly shook my mind; relief was so\r\nhopeless, redress so unattainable. But, my dear, I do not wish to\r\ndishearten; I only wish to warn you, and to prove that the single should\r\nnot be too anxious to change their state, as they may change for the\r\nworse."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, my dear madam. I quite understand your kind intentions, but\r\nthere is no fear of my falling into the error to which you allude. I, at\r\nleast, have no thoughts of marriage, and for that reason I want to make\r\nmyself a position by some other means."\r\n\r\n"My dear, listen to me. On what I am going to say I have carefully\r\ndeliberated, having, indeed, revolved the subject in my thoughts ever\r\nsince you first mentioned your wish to obtain a situation. You know I at\r\npresent reside with Miss Keeldar in the capacity of companion. Should\r\nshe marry (and that she _will_ marry ere long many circumstances induce\r\nme to conclude), I shall cease to be necessary to her in that capacity.\r\nI must tell you that I possess a small independency, arising partly from\r\nmy own savings, and partly from a legacy left me some years since.\r\nWhenever I leave Fieldhead I shall take a house of my own. I could not\r\nendure to live in solitude. I have no relations whom I care to invite to\r\nclose intimacy; for, as you must have observed, and as I have already\r\navowed, my habits and tastes have their peculiarities. To you, my dear,\r\nI need not say I am attached; with you I am happier than I have ever\r\nbeen with any living thing" (this was said with marked emphasis). "Your\r\nsociety I should esteem a very dear privilege--an inestimable privilege,\r\na comfort, a blessing. You shall come to me, then. Caroline, do you\r\nrefuse me? I hope you can love me?"\r\n\r\nAnd with these two abrupt questions she stopped.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I _do_ love you," was the reply. "I should like to live with\r\nyou. But you are too kind."\r\n\r\n"All I have," went on Mrs. Pryor, "I would leave to you. You should be\r\nprovided for. But never again say I am _too kind_. You pierce my heart,\r\nchild!"\r\n\r\n"But, my dear madam--this generosity--I have no claim----"\r\n\r\n"Hush! you must not talk about it. There are some things we cannot bear\r\nto hear. Oh! it is late to begin, but I may yet live a few years. I can\r\nnever wipe out the past, but perhaps a brief space in the future may\r\nyet be mine."\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor seemed deeply agitated. Large tears trembled in her eyes and\r\nrolled down her cheeks. Caroline kissed her, in her gentle, caressing\r\nway, saying softly, "I love you dearly. Don\'t cry."\r\n\r\nBut the lady\'s whole frame seemed shaken. She sat down, bent her head to\r\nher knee, and wept aloud. Nothing could console her till the inward\r\nstorm had had its way. At last the agony subsided of itself.\r\n\r\n"Poor thing!" she murmured, returning Caroline\'s kiss, "poor lonely\r\nlamb! But come," she added abruptly--"come; we must go home."\r\n\r\nFor a short distance Mrs. Pryor walked very fast. By degrees, however,\r\nshe calmed down to her wonted manner, fell into her usual characteristic\r\npace--a peculiar one, like all her movements--and by the time they\r\nreached Fieldhead she had re-entered into herself. The outside was, as\r\nusual, still and shy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTWO LIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly half of Moore\'s activity and resolution had been seen in his\r\ndefence of the mill; he showed the other half (and a terrible half it\r\nwas) in the indefatigable, the relentless assiduity with which he\r\npursued the leaders of the riot. The mob, the mere followers, he let\r\nalone. Perhaps an innate sense of justice told him that men misled by\r\nfalse counsel and goaded by privations are not fit objects of vengeance,\r\nand that he who would visit an even violent act on the bent head of\r\nsuffering is a tyrant, not a judge. At all events, though he knew many\r\nof the number, having recognized them during the latter part of the\r\nattack when day began to dawn, he let them daily pass him on street and\r\nroad without notice or threat.\r\n\r\nThe leaders he did not know. They were strangers--emissaries from the\r\nlarge towns. Most of these were not members of the operative class. They\r\nwere chiefly "down-draughts," bankrupts, men always in debt and often in\r\ndrink, men who had nothing to lose, and much, in the way of character,\r\ncash, and cleanliness, to gain. These persons Moore hunted like any\r\nsleuth-hound, and well he liked the occupation. Its excitement was of a\r\nkind pleasant to his nature. He liked it better than making cloth.\r\n\r\nHis horse must have hated these times, for it was ridden both hard and\r\noften. He almost lived on the road, and the fresh air was as welcome to\r\nhis lungs as the policeman\'s quest to his mood; he preferred it to the\r\nsteam of dye-houses. The magistrates of the district must have dreaded\r\nhim. They were slow, timid men; he liked both to frighten and to rouse\r\nthem. He liked to force them to betray a certain fear, which made them\r\nalike falter in resolve and recoil in action--the fear, simply, of\r\nassassination. This, indeed, was the dread which had hitherto hampered\r\nevery manufacturer and almost every public man in the district. Helstone\r\nalone had ever repelled it. The old Cossack knew well he might be shot.\r\nHe knew there was risk; but such death had for his nerves no terrors. It\r\nwould have been his chosen, might he have had a choice.\r\n\r\nMoore likewise knew his danger. The result was an unquenchable scorn of\r\nthe quarter whence such danger was to be apprehended. The consciousness\r\nthat he hunted assassins was the spur in his high-mettled temper\'s\r\nflank. As for fear, he was too proud, too hard-natured (if you will),\r\ntoo phlegmatic a man to fear. Many a time he rode belated over the\r\nmoors, moonlit or moonless as the case might be, with feelings far more\r\nelate, faculties far better refreshed, than when safety and stagnation\r\nenvironed him in the counting-house. Four was the number of the leaders\r\nto be accounted for. Two, in the course of a fortnight, were brought to\r\nbay near Stilbro\'; the remaining two it was necessary to seek farther\r\noff. Their haunts were supposed to lie near Birmingham.\r\n\r\nMeantime the clothier did not neglect his battered mill. Its reparation\r\nwas esteemed a light task, carpenters\' and glaziers\' work alone being\r\nneeded. The rioters not having succeeded in effecting an entrance, his\r\ngrim metal darlings--the machines--had escaped damage.\r\n\r\nWhether during this busy life--whether while stern justice and exacting\r\nbusiness claimed his energies and harassed his thoughts--he now and then\r\ngave one moment, dedicated one effort, to keep alive gentler fires than\r\nthose which smoulder in the fane of Nemesis, it was not easy to\r\ndiscover. He seldom went near Fieldhead; if he did, his visits were\r\nbrief. If he called at the rectory, it was only to hold conferences with\r\nthe rector in his study. He maintained his rigid course very steadily.\r\nMeantime the history of the year continued troubled. There was no lull\r\nin the tempest of war; her long hurricane still swept the Continent.\r\nThere was not the faintest sign of serene weather, no opening amid "the\r\nclouds of battle-dust and smoke," no fall of pure dews genial to the\r\nolive, no cessation of the red rain which nourishes the baleful and\r\nglorious laurel. Meantime, Ruin had her sappers and miners at work under\r\nMoore\'s feet, and whether he rode or walked, whether he only crossed his\r\ncounting-house hearth or galloped over sullen Rushedge, he was aware of\r\na hollow echo, and felt the ground shake to his tread.\r\n\r\nWhile the summer thus passed with Moore, how did it lapse with Shirley\r\nand Caroline? Let us first visit the heiress. How does she look? Like a\r\nlove-lorn maiden, pale and pining for a neglectful swain? Does she sit\r\nthe day long bent over some sedentary task? Has she for ever a book in\r\nher hand, or sewing on her knee, and eyes only for that, and words for\r\nnothing, and thoughts unspoken?\r\n\r\nBy no means. Shirley is all right. If her wistful cast of physiognomy is\r\nnot gone, no more is her careless smile. She keeps her dark old\r\nmanor-house light and bright with her cheery presence. The gallery and\r\nthe low-ceiled chambers that open into it have learned lively echoes\r\nfrom her voice; the dim entrance-hall, with its one window, has grown\r\npleasantly accustomed to the frequent rustle of a silk dress, as its\r\nwearer sweeps across from room to room, now carrying flowers to the\r\nbarbarous peach-bloom salon, now entering the dining-room to open its\r\ncasements and let in the scent of mignonette and sweet-briar, anon\r\nbringing plants from the staircase window to place in the sun at the\r\nopen porch door.\r\n\r\nShe takes her sewing occasionally; but, by some fatality, she is doomed\r\nnever to sit steadily at it for above five minutes at a time. Her\r\nthimble is scarcely fitted on, her needle scarce threaded, when a sudden\r\nthought calls her upstairs. Perhaps she goes to seek some\r\njust-then-remembered old ivory-backed needle-book or older china-topped\r\nwork-box, quite unneeded, but which seems at the moment indispensable;\r\nperhaps to arrange her hair, or a drawer which she recollects to have\r\nseen that morning in a state of curious confusion; perhaps only to take\r\na peep from a particular window at a particular view, whence Briarfield\r\nchurch and rectory are visible, pleasantly bowered in trees. She has\r\nscarcely returned, and again taken up the slip of cambric or square of\r\nhalf-wrought canvas, when Tartar\'s bold scrape and strangled whistle are\r\nheard at the porch door, and she must run to open it for him. It is a\r\nhot day; he comes in panting; she must convoy him to the kitchen, and\r\nsee with her own eyes that his water-bowl is replenished. Through the\r\nopen kitchen door the court is visible, all sunny and gay, and peopled\r\nwith turkeys and their poults, peahens and their chicks, pearl-flecked\r\nGuinea-fowls, and a bright variety of pure white, and purple-necked, and\r\nblue and cinnamon plumed pigeons. Irresistible spectacle to Shirley! She\r\nruns to the pantry for a roll, and she stands on the door step\r\nscattering crumbs. Around her throng her eager, plump, happy feathered\r\nvassals. John is about the stables, and John must be talked to, and her\r\nmare looked at. She is still petting and patting it when the cows come\r\nin to be milked. This is important; Shirley must stay and take a review\r\nof them all. There are perhaps some little calves, some little\r\nnew-yeaned lambs--it may be twins, whose mothers have rejected them.\r\nMiss Keeldar must be introduced to them by John, must permit herself the\r\ntreat of feeding them with her own hand, under the direction of her\r\ncareful foreman. Meantime John moots doubtful questions about the\r\nfarming of certain "crofts," and "ings," and "holmes," and his mistress\r\nis necessitated to fetch her garden-hat--a gipsy straw--and accompany\r\nhim, over stile and along hedgerow, to hear the conclusion of the whole\r\nagricultural matter on the spot, and with the said "crofts," "ings," and\r\n"holms" under her eye. Bright afternoon thus wears into soft evening,\r\nand she comes home to a late tea, and after tea she never sews.\r\n\r\nAfter tea Shirley reads, and she is just about as tenacious of her book\r\nas she is lax of her needle. Her study is the rug, her seat a footstool,\r\nor perhaps only the carpet at Mrs. Pryor\'s feet: there she always\r\nlearned her lessons when a child, and old habits have a strong power\r\nover her. The tawny and lionlike bulk of Tartar is ever stretched beside\r\nher, his negro muzzle laid on his fore paws--straight, strong, and\r\nshapely as the limbs of an Alpine wolf. One hand of the mistress\r\ngenerally reposes on the loving serf\'s rude head, because if she takes\r\nit away he groans and is discontented. Shirley\'s mind is given to her\r\nbook. She lifts not her eyes; she neither stirs nor speaks--unless,\r\nindeed, it be to return a brief respectful answer to Mrs. Pryor, who\r\naddresses deprecatory phrases to her now and then.\r\n\r\n"My dear, you had better not have that great dog so near you; he is\r\ncrushing the border of your dress."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is only muslin. I can put a clean one on to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"My dear, I wish you could acquire the habit of sitting to a table when\r\nyou read."\r\n\r\n"I will try, ma\'am, some time; but it is so comfortable to do as one has\r\nalways been accustomed to do."\r\n\r\n"My dear, let me beg of you to put that book down. You are trying your\r\neyes by the doubtful firelight."\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am, not at all; my eyes are never tired."\r\n\r\nAt last, however, a pale light falls on the page from the window. She\r\nlooks; the moon is up. She closes the volume, rises, and walks through\r\nthe room. Her book has perhaps been a good one; it has refreshed,\r\nrefilled, rewarmed her heart; it has set her brain astir, furnished her\r\nmind with pictures. The still parlour, the clean hearth, the window\r\nopening on the twilight sky, and showing its "sweet regent," new throned\r\nand glorious, suffice to make earth an Eden, life a poem, for Shirley. A\r\nstill, deep, inborn delight glows in her young veins, unmingled,\r\nuntroubled, not to be reached or ravished by human agency, because by no\r\nhuman agency bestowed--the pure gift of God to His creature, the free\r\ndower of Nature to her child. This joy gives her experience of a\r\ngenii-life. Buoyant, by green steps, by glad hills, all verdure and\r\nlight, she reaches a station scarcely lower than that whence angels\r\nlooked down on the dreamer of Bethel, and her eye seeks, and her soul\r\npossesses, the vision of life as she wishes it. No, not as she wishes\r\nit; she has not time to wish. The swift glory spreads out, sweeping and\r\nkindling, and multiplies its splendours faster than Thought can effect\r\nhis combinations, faster than Aspiration can utter her longings. Shirley\r\nsays nothing while the trance is upon her--she is quite mute; but if\r\nMrs. Pryor speaks to her now, she goes out quietly, and continues her\r\nwalk upstairs in the dim gallery.\r\n\r\nIf Shirley were not an indolent, a reckless, an ignorant being, she\r\nwould take a pen at such moments, or at least while the recollection of\r\nsuch moments was yet fresh on her spirit. She would seize, she would fix\r\nthe apparition, tell the vision revealed. Had she a little more of the\r\norgan of acquisitiveness in her head, a little more of the love of\r\nproperty in her nature, she would take a good-sized sheet of paper and\r\nwrite plainly out, in her own queer but clear and legible hand, the\r\nstory that has been narrated, the song that has been sung to her, and\r\nthus possess what she was enabled to create. But indolent she is,\r\nreckless she is, and most ignorant; for she does not know her dreams are\r\nrare, her feelings peculiar. She does not know, has never known, and\r\nwill die without knowing, the full value of that spring whose bright\r\nfresh bubbling in her heart keeps it green.\r\n\r\nShirley takes life easily. Is not that fact written in her eye? In her\r\ngood-tempered moments is it not as full of lazy softness as in her brief\r\nfits of anger it is fulgent with quick-flashing fire? Her nature is in\r\nher eye. So long as she is calm, indolence, indulgence, humour, and\r\ntenderness possess that large gray sphere; incense her, a red ray\r\npierces the dew, it quickens instantly to flame.\r\n\r\nEre the month of July was past, Miss Keeldar would probably have started\r\nwith Caroline on that northern tour they had planned; but just at that\r\nepoch an invasion befell Fieldhead. A genteel foraging party besieged\r\nShirley in her castle, and compelled her to surrender at discretion. An\r\nuncle, an aunt, and two cousins from the south--a Mr., Mrs., and two\r\nMisses Sympson, of Sympson Grove, ----shire--came down upon her in\r\nstate. The laws of hospitality obliged her to give in, which she did\r\nwith a facility which somewhat surprised Caroline, who knew her to be\r\nprompt in action and fertile in expedient where a victory was to be\r\ngained for her will. Miss Helstone even asked her how it was she\r\nsubmitted so readily. She answered, old feelings had their power; she\r\nhad passed two years of her early youth at Sympson Grove.\r\n\r\n"How did she like her relatives?"\r\n\r\nShe had nothing in common with them, she replied. Little Harry Sympson,\r\nindeed, the sole son of the family, was very unlike his sisters, and of\r\nhim she had formerly been fond; but he was not coming to Yorkshire--at\r\nleast not yet.\r\n\r\nThe next Sunday the Fieldhead pew in Briarfield Church appeared peopled\r\nwith a prim, trim, fidgety, elderly gentleman, who shifted his\r\nspectacles, and changed his position every three minutes; a patient,\r\nplacid-looking elderly lady in brown satin; and two pattern young\r\nladies, in pattern attire, with pattern deportment. Shirley had the air\r\nof a black swan or a white crow in the midst of this party, and very\r\nforlorn was her aspect. Having brought her into respectable society, we\r\nwill leave her there a while, and look after Miss Helstone.\r\n\r\nSeparated from Miss Keeldar for the present, as she could not seek her\r\nin the midst of her fine relatives, scared away from Fieldhead by the\r\nvisiting commotion which the new arrivals occasioned in the\r\nneighbourhood, Caroline was limited once more to the gray rectory, the\r\nsolitary morning walk in remote by-paths, the long, lonely afternoon\r\nsitting in a quiet parlour which the sun forsook at noon, or in the\r\ngarden alcove where it shone bright, yet sad, on the ripening red\r\ncurrants trained over the trellis, and on the fair monthly roses\r\nentwined between, and through them fell chequered on Caroline sitting in\r\nher white summer dress, still as a garden statue. There she read old\r\nbooks, taken from her uncle\'s library. The Greek and Latin were of no\r\nuse to her, and its collection of light literature was chiefly contained\r\non a shelf which had belonged to her aunt Mary--some venerable Lady\'s\r\nMagazines, that had once performed a sea-voyage with their owner, and\r\nundergone a storm, and whose pages were stained with salt water; some\r\nmad Methodist Magazines, full of miracles and apparitions, of\r\npreternatural warnings, ominous dreams, and frenzied fanaticism; the\r\nequally mad letters of Mrs. Elizabeth Rowe from the Dead to the Living;\r\na few old English classics. From these faded flowers Caroline had in her\r\nchildhood extracted the honey; they were tasteless to her now. By way of\r\nchange, and also of doing good, she would sew--make garments for the\r\npoor, according to good Miss Ainley\'s direction. Sometimes, as she felt\r\nand saw her tears fall slowly on her work, she would wonder how the\r\nexcellent woman who had cut it out and arranged it for her managed to be\r\nso equably serene in _her_ solitude.\r\n\r\n"I never find Miss Ainley oppressed with despondency or lost in grief,"\r\nshe thought; "yet her cottage is a still, dim little place, and she is\r\nwithout a bright hope or near friend in the world. I remember, though,\r\nshe told me once she had tutored her thoughts to tend upwards to heaven.\r\nShe allowed there was, and ever had been, little enjoyment in this world\r\nfor her, and she looks, I suppose, to the bliss of the world to come. So\r\ndo nuns, with their close cell, their iron lamp, their robe strait as a\r\nshroud, their bed narrow as a coffin. She says often she has no fear of\r\ndeath--no dread of the grave; no more, doubtless, had St. Simeon\r\nStylites, lifted up terrible on his wild column in the wilderness; no\r\nmore has the Hindu votary stretched on his couch of iron spikes. Both\r\nthese having violated nature, their natural likings and antipathies are\r\nreversed; they grow altogether morbid. I do fear death as yet, but I\r\nbelieve it is because I am young. Poor Miss Ainley would cling closer to\r\nlife if life had more charms for her. God surely did not create us and\r\ncause us to live with the sole end of wishing always to die. I believe\r\nin my heart we were intended to prize life and enjoy it so long as we\r\nretain it. Existence never was originally meant to be that useless,\r\nblank, pale, slow-trailing thing it often becomes to many, and is\r\nbecoming to me among the rest.\r\n\r\n"Nobody," she went on--"nobody in particular is to blame, that I can\r\nsee, for the state in which things are; and I cannot tell, however much\r\nI puzzle over it, how they are to be altered for the better; but I feel\r\nthere is something wrong somewhere. I believe single women should have\r\nmore to do--better chances of interesting and profitable occupation than\r\nthey possess now. And when I speak thus I have no impression that I\r\ndisplease God by my words; that I am either impious or impatient,\r\nirreligious or sacrilegious. My consolation is, indeed, that God hears\r\nmany a groan, and compassionates much grief which man stops his ears\r\nagainst, or frowns on with impotent contempt. I say _impotent_, for I\r\nobserve that to such grievances as society cannot readily cure it\r\nusually forbids utterance, on pain of its scorn, this scorn being only a\r\nsort of tinselled cloak to its deformed weakness. People hate to be\r\nreminded of ills they are unable or unwilling to remedy. Such reminder,\r\nin forcing on them a sense of their own incapacity, or a more painful\r\nsense of an obligation to make some unpleasant effort, troubles their\r\nease and shakes their self-complacency. Old maids, like the houseless\r\nand unemployed poor, should not ask for a place and an occupation in the\r\nworld; the demand disturbs the happy and rich--it disturbs parents. Look\r\nat the numerous families of girls in this neighbourhood--the Armitages,\r\nthe Birtwhistles, the Sykeses. The brothers of these girls are every one\r\nin business or in professions; they have something to do. Their sisters\r\nhave no earthly employment but household work and sewing, no earthly\r\npleasure but an unprofitable visiting, and no hope, in all their life to\r\ncome, of anything better. This stagnant state of things makes them\r\ndecline in health. They are never well, and their minds and views shrink\r\nto wondrous narrowness. The great wish, the sole aim of every one of\r\nthem is to be married, but the majority will never marry; they will die\r\nas they now live. They scheme, they plot, they dress to ensnare\r\nhusbands. The gentlemen turn them into ridicule; they don\'t want them;\r\nthey hold them very cheap. They say--I have heard them say it with\r\nsneering laughs many a time--the matrimonial market is overstocked.\r\nFathers say so likewise, and are angry with their daughters when they\r\nobserve their man\xc5\x93uvres--they order them to stay at home. What do they\r\nexpect them to do at home? If you ask, they would answer, sew and cook.\r\nThey expect them to do this, and this only, contentedly, regularly,\r\nuncomplainingly, all their lives long, as if they had no germs of\r\nfaculties for anything else--a doctrine as reasonable to hold as it\r\nwould be that the fathers have no faculties but for eating what their\r\ndaughters cook or for wearing what they sew. Could men live so\r\nthemselves? Would they not be very weary? And when there came no relief\r\nto their weariness, but only reproaches at its slightest manifestation,\r\nwould not their weariness ferment in time to frenzy? Lucretia, spinning\r\nat midnight in the midst of her maidens, and Solomon\'s virtuous woman\r\nare often quoted as patterns of what \'the sex,\' as they say, ought to\r\nbe. I don\'t know. Lucretia, I dare say, was a most worthy sort of\r\nperson, much like my cousin Hortense Moore; but she kept her servants up\r\nvery late. I should not have liked to be amongst the number of the\r\nmaidens. Hortense would just work me and Sarah in that fashion, if she\r\ncould, and neither of us would bear it. The \'virtuous woman,\' again, had\r\nher household up in the very middle of the night; she \'got breakfast\r\nover,\' as Mrs. Sykes says, before one o\'clock a.m.; but _she_ had\r\nsomething more to do than spin and give out portions. She was a\r\nmanufacturer--she made fine linen and sold it; she was an\r\nagriculturist--she bought estates and planted vineyards. _That_ woman\r\nwas a manager. She was what the matrons hereabouts call \'a clever\r\nwoman.\' On the whole, I like her a good deal better than Lucretia; but I\r\ndon\'t believe either Mr. Armitage or Mr. Sykes could have got the\r\nadvantage of her in a bargain. Yet I like her. \'Strength and honour were\r\nher clothing; the heart of her husband safely trusted in her. She opened\r\nher mouth with wisdom; in her tongue was the law of kindness; her\r\nchildren rose up and called her blessed; her husband also praised her.\'\r\nKing of Israel! your model of a woman is a worthy model! But are we, in\r\nthese days, brought up to be like her? Men of Yorkshire! do your\r\ndaughters reach this royal standard? Can they reach it? Can you help\r\nthem to reach it? Can you give them a field in which their faculties may\r\nbe exercised and grow? Men of England! look at your poor girls, many of\r\nthem fading around you, dropping off in consumption or decline; or, what\r\nis worse, degenerating to sour old maids--envious, back-biting,\r\nwretched, because life is a desert to them; or, what is worst of all,\r\nreduced to strive, by scarce modest coquetry and debasing artifice, to\r\ngain that position and consideration by marriage which to celibacy is\r\ndenied. Fathers! cannot you alter these things? Perhaps not all at once;\r\nbut consider the matter well when it is brought before you, receive it\r\nas a theme worthy of thought; do not dismiss it with an idle jest or an\r\nunmanly insult. You would wish to be proud of your daughters, and not to\r\nblush for them; then seek for them an interest and an occupation which\r\nshall raise them above the flirt, the man\xc5\x93uvrer, the mischief-making\r\ntale-bearer. Keep your girls\' minds narrow and fettered; they will still\r\nbe a plague and a care, sometimes a disgrace to you. Cultivate\r\nthem--give them scope and work; they will be your gayest companions in\r\nhealth, your tenderest nurses in sickness, your most faithful prop in\r\nage."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nAN EVENING OUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne fine summer day that Caroline had spent entirely alone (her uncle\r\nbeing at Whinbury), and whose long, bright, noiseless, breezeless,\r\ncloudless hours (how many they seemed since sunrise!) had been to her as\r\ndesolate as if they had gone over her head in the shadowless and\r\ntrackless wastes of Sahara, instead of in the blooming garden of an\r\nEnglish home, she was sitting in the alcove--her task of work on her\r\nknee, her fingers assiduously plying the needle, her eyes following and\r\nregulating their movements, her brain working restlessly--when Fanny\r\ncame to the door, looked round over the lawn and borders, and not seeing\r\nher whom she sought, called out, "Miss Caroline!"\r\n\r\nA low voice answered "Fanny!" It issued from the alcove, and thither\r\nFanny hastened, a note in her hand, which she delivered to fingers that\r\nhardly seemed to have nerve to hold it. Miss Helstone did not ask whence\r\nit came, and she did not look at it; she let it drop amongst the folds\r\nof her work.\r\n\r\n"Joe Scott\'s son, Harry, brought it," said Fanny.\r\n\r\nThe girl was no enchantress, and knew no magic spell; yet what she said\r\ntook almost magical effect on her young mistress. She lifted her head\r\nwith the quick motion of revived sensation; she shot, not a languid, but\r\na lifelike, questioning glance at Fanny.\r\n\r\n"Harry Scott! who sent him?"\r\n\r\n"He came from the Hollow."\r\n\r\nThe dropped note was snatched up eagerly, the seal was broken--it was\r\nread in two seconds. An affectionate billet from Hortense, informing her\r\nyoung cousin that she was returned from Wormwood Wells; that she was\r\nalone to-day, as Robert was gone to Whinbury market; that nothing would\r\ngive her greater pleasure than to have Caroline\'s company to tea, and\r\nthe good lady added, she was quite sure such a change would be most\r\nacceptable and beneficial to Caroline, who must be sadly at a loss both\r\nfor safe guidance and improving society since the misunderstanding\r\nbetween Robert and Mr. Helstone had occasioned a separation from her\r\n"meilleure amie, Hortense G\xc3\xa9rard Moore." In a postscript she was urged\r\nto put on her bonnet and run down directly.\r\n\r\nCaroline did not need the injunction. Glad was she to lay by the brown\r\nholland child\'s slip she was trimming with braid for the Jew\'s basket,\r\nto hasten upstairs, cover her curls with her straw bonnet, and throw\r\nround her shoulders the black silk scarf, whose simple drapery suited as\r\nwell her shape as its dark hue set off the purity of her dress and the\r\nfairness of her face; glad was she to escape for a few hours the\r\nsolitude, the sadness, the nightmare of her life; glad to run down the\r\ngreen lane sloping to the Hollow, to scent the fragrance of hedge\r\nflowers sweeter than the perfume of moss-rose or lily. True, she knew\r\nRobert was not at the cottage; but it was delight to go where he had\r\nlately been. So long, so totally separated from him, merely to see his\r\nhome, to enter the room where he had that morning sat, felt like a\r\nreunion. As such it revived her; and then Illusion was again following\r\nher in Peri mask. The soft agitation of wings caressed her cheek, and\r\nthe air, breathing from the blue summer sky, bore a voice which\r\nwhispered, "Robert may come home while you are in his house, and then,\r\nat least, you may look in his face--at least you may give him your hand;\r\nperhaps, for a minute, you may sit beside him."\r\n\r\n"Silence!" was her austere response; but she loved the comforter and the\r\nconsolation.\r\n\r\nMiss Moore probably caught from the window the gleam and flutter of\r\nCaroline\'s white attire through the branchy garden shrubs, for she\r\nadvanced from the cottage porch to meet her. Straight, unbending,\r\nphlegmatic as usual, she came on. No haste or ecstasy was ever permitted\r\nto disorder the dignity of _her_ movements; but she smiled, well pleased\r\nto mark the delight of her pupil, to feel her kiss and the gentle,\r\ngenial strain of her embrace. She led her tenderly in, half deceived and\r\nwholly flattered. Half deceived! had it not been so she would in all\r\nprobability have put her to the wicket, and shut her out. Had she known\r\nclearly to whose account the chief share of this childlike joy was to be\r\nplaced, Hortense would most likely have felt both shocked and incensed.\r\nSisters do not like young ladies to fall in love with their brothers.\r\nIt seems, if not presumptuous, silly, weak, a delusion, an absurd\r\nmistake. _They_ do not love these gentlemen--whatever sisterly affection\r\nthey may cherish towards them--and that others should, repels them with\r\na sense of crude romance. The first movement, in short, excited by such\r\ndiscovery (as with many parents on finding their children to be in love)\r\nis one of mixed impatience and contempt. Reason--if they be rational\r\npeople--corrects the false feeling in time; but if they be irrational,\r\nit is never corrected, and the daughter or sister-in-law is disliked to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\n"You would expect to find me alone, from what I said in my note,"\r\nobserved Miss Moore, as she conducted Caroline towards the parlour; "but\r\nit was written this morning: since dinner, company has come in."\r\n\r\nAnd opening the door she made visible an ample spread of crimson skirts\r\noverflowing the elbow-chair at the fireside, and above them, presiding\r\nwith dignity, a cap more awful than a crown. That cap had never come to\r\nthe cottage under a bonnet; no, it had been brought in a vast bag, or\r\nrather a middle-sized balloon of black silk, held wide with whalebone.\r\nThe screed, or frill of the cap, stood a quarter of a yard broad round\r\nthe face of the wearer. The ribbon, flourishing in puffs and bows about\r\nthe head, was of the sort called love-ribbon. There was a good deal of\r\nit, I may say, a very great deal. Mrs. Yorke wore the cap--it became\r\nher; she wore the gown also--it suited her no less.\r\n\r\nThat great lady was come in a friendly way to take tea with Miss Moore.\r\nIt was almost as great and as rare a favour as if the queen were to go\r\nuninvited to share pot-luck with one of her subjects. A higher mark of\r\ndistinction she could not show--she who in general scorned visiting and\r\ntea-drinking, and held cheap and stigmatized as "gossips" every maid and\r\nmatron of the vicinage.\r\n\r\nThere was no mistake, however; Miss Moore _was_ a favourite with her.\r\nShe had evinced the fact more than once--evinced it by stopping to speak\r\nto her in the churchyard on Sundays; by inviting her, almost hospitably,\r\nto come to Briarmains; evinced it to-day by the grand condescension of a\r\npersonal visit. Her reasons for the preference, as assigned by herself,\r\nwere that Miss Moore was a woman of steady deportment, without the least\r\nlevity of conversation or carriage; also that, being a foreigner, she\r\nmust feel the want of a friend to countenance her. She might have added\r\nthat her plain aspect, homely, precise dress, and phlegmatic,\r\nunattractive manner were to her so many additional recommendations. It\r\nis certain, at least, that ladies remarkable for the opposite qualities\r\nof beauty, lively bearing, and elegant taste in attire were not often\r\nfavoured with her approbation. Whatever gentlemen are apt to admire in\r\nwomen, Mrs. Yorke condemned; and what they overlook or despise, she\r\npatronized.\r\n\r\nCaroline advanced to the mighty matron with some sense of diffidence.\r\nShe knew little of Mrs. Yorke, and, as a parson\'s niece, was doubtful\r\nwhat sort of a reception she might get. She got a very cool one, and was\r\nglad to hide her discomfiture by turning away to take off her bonnet.\r\nNor, upon sitting down, was she displeased to be immediately accosted by\r\na little personage in a blue frock and sash, who started up like some\r\nfairy from the side of the great dame\'s chair, where she had been\r\nsitting on a footstool, screened from view by the folds of the wide red\r\ngown, and running to Miss Helstone, unceremoniously threw her arms round\r\nher neck and demanded a kiss.\r\n\r\n"My mother is not civil to you," said the petitioner, as she received\r\nand repaid a smiling salute, "and Rose there takes no notice of you; it\r\nis their way. If, instead of you, a white angel, with a crown of stars,\r\nhad come into the room, mother would nod stiffly, and Rose never lift\r\nher head at all; but I will be your friend--I have always liked you."\r\n\r\n"Jessie, curb that tongue of yours, and repress your forwardness!" said\r\nMrs. Yorke.\r\n\r\n"But, mother, you are so frozen!" expostulated Jessie. "Miss Helstone\r\nhas never done you any harm; why can\'t you be kind to her? You sit so\r\nstiff, and look so cold, and speak so dry--what for? That\'s just the\r\nfashion in which you treat Miss Shirley Keeldar and every other young\r\nlady who comes to our house. And Rose there is such an aut--aut--I have\r\nforgotten the word, but it means a machine in the shape of a human\r\nbeing. However, between you, you will drive every soul away from\r\nBriarmains; Martin often says so."\r\n\r\n"I am an automaton? Good! Let me alone, then," said Rose, speaking from\r\na corner where she was sitting on the carpet at the foot of a bookcase,\r\nwith a volume spread open on her knee.--"Miss Helstone, how do you do?"\r\nshe added, directing a brief glance to the person addressed, and then\r\nagain casting down her gray, remarkable eyes on the book and returning\r\nto the study of its pages.\r\n\r\nCaroline stole a quiet gaze towards her, dwelling on her young, absorbed\r\ncountenance, and observing a certain unconscious movement of the mouth\r\nas she read--a movement full of character. Caroline had tact, and she\r\nhad fine instinct. She felt that Rose Yorke was a peculiar child--one of\r\nthe unique; she knew how to treat her. Approaching quietly, she knelt on\r\nthe carpet at her side, and looked over her little shoulder at her book.\r\nIt was a romance of Mrs. Radcliffe\'s--"The Italian."\r\n\r\nCaroline read on with her, making no remark. Presently Rose showed her\r\nthe attention of asking, ere she turned the leaf, "Are you ready?"\r\n\r\nCaroline only nodded.\r\n\r\n"Do you like it?" inquired Rose ere long.\r\n\r\n"Long since, when I read it as a child, I was wonderfully taken with\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"It seemed to open with such promise--such foreboding of a most strange\r\ntale to be unfolded."\r\n\r\n"And in reading it you feel as if you were far away from England--really\r\nin Italy--under another sort of sky--that blue sky of the south which\r\ntravellers describe."\r\n\r\n"You are sensible of that, Rose?"\r\n\r\n"It makes me long to travel, Miss Helstone."\r\n\r\n"When you are a woman, perhaps, you may be able to gratify your wish."\r\n\r\n"I mean to make a way to do so, if one is not made for me. I cannot live\r\nalways in Briarfield. The whole world is not very large compared with\r\ncreation. I must see the outside of our own round planet, at least."\r\n\r\n"How much of its outside?"\r\n\r\n"First this hemisphere where we live; then the other. I am resolved that\r\nmy life shall be a life. Not a black trance like the toad\'s, buried in\r\nmarble; nor a long, slow death like yours in Briarfield rectory."\r\n\r\n"Like mine! what can you mean, child?"\r\n\r\n"Might you not as well be tediously dying as for ever shut up in that\r\nglebe-house--a place that, when I pass it, always reminds me of a\r\nwindowed grave? I never see any movement about the door. I never hear a\r\nsound from the wall. I believe smoke never issues from the chimneys.\r\nWhat do you do there?"\r\n\r\n"I sew, I read, I learn lessons."\r\n\r\n"Are you happy?"\r\n\r\n"Should I be happy wandering alone in strange countries as you wish to\r\ndo?"\r\n\r\n"Much happier, even if you did nothing but wander. Remember, however,\r\nthat I shall have an object in view; but if you only went on and on,\r\nlike some enchanted lady in a fairy tale, you might be happier than now.\r\nIn a day\'s wandering you would pass many a hill, wood, and watercourse,\r\neach perpetually altering in aspect as the sun shone out or was\r\novercast; as the weather was wet or fair, dark or bright. Nothing\r\nchanges in Briarfield rectory. The plaster of the parlour ceilings, the\r\npaper on the walls, the curtains, carpets, chairs, are still the same."\r\n\r\n"Is change necessary to happiness?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Is it synonymous with it?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; but I feel monotony and death to be almost the same."\r\n\r\nHere Jessie spoke.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t she mad?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"But, Rose," pursued Caroline, "I fear a wanderer\'s life, for me at\r\nleast, would end like that tale you are reading--in disappointment,\r\nvanity, and vexation of spirit."\r\n\r\n"Does \'The Italian\' so end?"\r\n\r\n"I thought so when I read it."\r\n\r\n"Better to try all things and find all empty than to try nothing and\r\nleave your life a blank. To do this is to commit the sin of him who\r\nburied his talent in a napkin--despicable sluggard!"\r\n\r\n"Rose," observed Mrs. Yorke, "solid satisfaction is only to be realized\r\nby doing one\'s duty."\r\n\r\n"Right, mother! And if my Master has given me ten talents, my duty is to\r\ntrade with them, and make them ten talents more. Not in the dust of\r\nhousehold drawers shall the coin be interred. I will _not_ deposit it in\r\na broken-spouted teapot, and shut it up in a china closet among\r\ntea-things. I will _not_ commit it to your work-table to be smothered in\r\npiles of woollen hose. I will _not_ prison it in the linen press to find\r\nshrouds among the sheets. And least of all, mother" (she got up from the\r\nfloor)--"least of all will I hide it in a tureen of cold potatoes, to be\r\nranged with bread, butter, pastry, and ham on the shelves of the\r\nlarder."\r\n\r\nShe stopped, then went on, "Mother, the Lord who gave each of us our\r\ntalents will come home some day, and will demand from all an account.\r\nThe teapot, the old stocking-foot, the linen rag, the willow-pattern\r\ntureen will yield up their barren deposit in many a house. Suffer your\r\ndaughters, at least, to put their money to the exchangers, that they may\r\nbe enabled at the Master\'s coming to pay Him His own with usury."\r\n\r\n"Rose, did you bring your sampler with you, as I told you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mother."\r\n\r\n"Sit down, and do a line of marking."\r\n\r\nRose sat down promptly, and wrought according to orders. After a busy\r\npause of ten minutes, her mother asked, "Do you think yourself oppressed\r\nnow--a victim?"\r\n\r\n"No, mother."\r\n\r\n"Yet, as far as I understood your tirade, it was a protest against all\r\nwomanly and domestic employment."\r\n\r\n"You misunderstood it, mother. I should be sorry not to learn to sew.\r\nYou do right to teach me, and to make me work."\r\n\r\n"Even to the mending of your brothers\' stockings and the making of\r\nsheets?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Where is the use of ranting and spouting about it, then?"\r\n\r\n"Am I to do nothing but that? I will do that, and then I will do more.\r\nNow, mother, I have said my say. I am twelve years old at present, and\r\nnot till I am sixteen will I speak again about talents. For four years I\r\nbind myself an industrious apprentice to all you can teach me."\r\n\r\n"You see what my daughters are, Miss Helstone," observed Mrs. Yorke;\r\n"how precociously wise in their own conceits! \'I would rather this, I\r\nprefer that\'--such is Jessie\'s cuckoo song; while Rose utters the bolder\r\ncry, \'I _will_, and I will _not_!\'"\r\n\r\n"I render a reason, mother; besides, if my cry is bold, it is only heard\r\nonce in a twelvemonth. About each birthday the spirit moves me to\r\ndeliver one oracle respecting my own instruction and management. I utter\r\nit and leave it; it is for you, mother, to listen or not."\r\n\r\n"I would advise all young ladies," pursued Mrs. Yorke, "to study the\r\ncharacters of such children as they chance to meet with before they\r\nmarry and have any of their own to consider well how they would like\r\nthe responsibility of guiding the careless, the labour of persuading the\r\nstubborn, the constant burden and task of training the best."\r\n\r\n"But with love it need not be so very difficult," interposed Caroline.\r\n"Mothers love their children most dearly--almost better than they love\r\nthemselves."\r\n\r\n"Fine talk! very sentimental! There is the rough, practical part of life\r\nyet to come for you, young miss."\r\n\r\n"But, Mrs. Yorke, if I take a little baby into my arms--any poor woman\'s\r\ninfant, for instance--I feel that I love that helpless thing quite\r\npeculiarly, though I am not its mother. I could do almost anything for\r\nit willingly, if it were delivered over entirely to my care--if it were\r\nquite dependent on me."\r\n\r\n"You _feel_! Yes, yes! I dare say, now. You are led a great deal by your\r\n_feelings_, and you think yourself a very sensitive personage, no doubt.\r\nAre you aware that, with all these romantic ideas, you have managed to\r\ntrain your features into an habitually lackadaisical expression, better\r\nsuited to a novel-heroine than to a woman who is to make her way in the\r\nreal world by dint of common sense?"\r\n\r\n"No; I am not at all aware of that, Mrs. Yorke."\r\n\r\n"Look in the glass just behind you. Compare the face you see there with\r\nthat of any early-rising, hard-working milkmaid."\r\n\r\n"My face is a pale one, but it is _not_ sentimental; and most milkmaids,\r\nhowever red and robust they may be, are more stupid and less practically\r\nfitted to make their way in the world than I am. I think more, and more\r\ncorrectly, than milkmaids in general do; consequently, where they would\r\noften, for want of reflection, act weakly, I, by dint of reflection,\r\nshould act judiciously."\r\n\r\n"Oh no! you would be influenced by your feelings; you would be guided by\r\nimpulse."\r\n\r\n"Of course I should often be influenced by my feelings. They were given\r\nme to that end. Whom my feelings teach me to love I _must_ and _shall_\r\nlove; and I hope, if ever I have a husband and children, my feelings\r\nwill induce me to love them. I hope, in that case, all my impulses will\r\nbe strong in compelling me to love."\r\n\r\nCaroline had a pleasure in saying this with emphasis; she had a pleasure\r\nin daring to say it in Mrs. Yorke\'s presence. She did not care what\r\nunjust sarcasm might be hurled at her in reply. She flushed, not with\r\nanger but excitement, when the ungenial matron answered coolly, "Don\'t\r\nwaste your dramatic effects. That was well said--it was quite fine; but\r\nit is lost on two women--an old wife and an old maid. There should have\r\nbeen a disengaged gentleman present.--Is Mr. Robert nowhere hid behind\r\nthe curtains, do you think, Miss Moore?"\r\n\r\nHortense, who during the chief part of the conversation had been in the\r\nkitchen superintending the preparations for tea, did not yet quite\r\ncomprehend the drift of the discourse. She answered, with a puzzled air,\r\nthat Robert was at Whinbury. Mrs. Yorke laughed her own peculiar short\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n"Straightforward Miss Moore!" said she patronizingly. "It is like you to\r\nunderstand my question so literally and answer it so simply. _Your_ mind\r\ncomprehends nothing of intrigue. Strange things might go on around you\r\nwithout your being the wiser; you are not of the class the world calls\r\nsharp-witted."\r\n\r\nThese equivocal compliments did not seem to please Hortense. She drew\r\nherself up, puckered her black eyebrows, but still looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n"I have ever been noted for sagacity and discernment from childhood,"\r\nshe returned; for, indeed, on the possession of these qualities she\r\npeculiarly piqued herself.\r\n\r\n"You never plotted to win a husband, I\'ll be bound," pursued Mrs. Yorke;\r\n"and you have not the benefit of previous experience to aid you in\r\ndiscovering when others plot."\r\n\r\nCaroline felt this kind language where the benevolent speaker intended\r\nshe should feel it--in her very heart. She could not even parry the\r\nshafts; she was defenceless for the present. To answer would have been\r\nto avow that the cap fitted. Mrs. Yorke, looking at her as she sat with\r\ntroubled, downcast eyes, and cheek burning painfully, and figure\r\nexpressing in its bent attitude and unconscious tremor all the\r\nhumiliation and chagrin she experienced, felt the sufferer was fair\r\ngame. The strange woman had a natural antipathy to a shrinking,\r\nsensitive character--a nervous temperament; nor was a pretty, delicate,\r\nand youthful face a passport to her affections. It was seldom she met\r\nwith all these obnoxious qualities combined in one individual; still\r\nmore seldom she found that individual at her mercy, under circumstances\r\nin which she could crush her well. She happened this afternoon to be\r\nspecially bilious and morose--as much disposed to gore as any vicious\r\n"mother of the herd." Lowering her large head she made a new charge.\r\n\r\n"Your cousin Hortense is an excellent sister, Miss Helstone. Such ladies\r\nas come to try their life\'s luck here at Hollow\'s Cottage may, by a very\r\nlittle clever female artifice, cajole the mistress of the house, and\r\nhave the game all in their own hands. You are fond of your cousin\'s\r\nsociety, I dare say, miss?"\r\n\r\n"Of which cousin\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, of the lady\'s, _of course_."\r\n\r\n"Hortense is, and always has been, most kind to me."\r\n\r\n"Every sister with an eligible single brother is considered most kind by\r\nher spinster friends."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Yorke," said Caroline, lifting her eyes slowly, their blue orbs at\r\nthe same time clearing from trouble, and shining steady and full, while\r\nthe glow of shame left her cheek, and its hue turned pale and\r\nsettled--"Mrs. Yorke, may I ask what you mean?"\r\n\r\n"To give you a lesson on the cultivation of rectitude, to disgust you\r\nwith craft and false sentiment."\r\n\r\n"Do I need this lesson?"\r\n\r\n"Most young ladies of the present day need it. You are quite a modern\r\nyoung lady--morbid, delicate, professing to like retirement; which\r\nimplies, I suppose, that you find little worthy of your sympathies in\r\nthe ordinary world. The ordinary world--every-day honest folks--are\r\nbetter than you think them, much better than any bookish, romancing chit\r\nof a girl can be who hardly ever puts her nose over her uncle the\r\nparson\'s garden wall."\r\n\r\n"Consequently of whom you know nothing. Excuse me--indeed, it does not\r\nmatter whether you excuse me or not--you have attacked me without\r\nprovocation; I shall defend myself without apology. Of my relations with\r\nmy two cousins you are ignorant. In a fit of ill-humour you have\r\nattempted to poison them by gratuitous insinuations, which are far more\r\ncrafty and false than anything with which you can justly charge me. That\r\nI happen to be pale, and sometimes to look diffident, is no business of\r\nyours; that I am fond of books, and indisposed for common gossip, is\r\nstill less your business; that I am a \'romancing chit of a girl\' is a\r\nmere conjecture on your part. I never romanced to you nor to anybody you\r\nknow. That I am the parson\'s niece is not a crime, though you may be\r\nnarrow-minded enough to think it so. You dislike me. You have no just\r\nreason for disliking me; therefore keep the expression of your aversion\r\nto yourself. If at any time in future you evince it annoyingly, I shall\r\nanswer even less scrupulously than I have done now."\r\n\r\nShe ceased, and sat in white and still excitement. She had spoken in the\r\nclearest of tones, neither fast nor loud; but her silver accents\r\nthrilled the ear. The speed of the current in her veins was just then as\r\nswift as it was viewless.\r\n\r\nMrs. Yorke was not irritated at the reproof, worded with a severity so\r\nsimple, dictated by a pride so quiet. Turning coolly to Miss Moore, she\r\nsaid, nodding her cap approvingly, "She has spirit in her, after\r\nall.--Always speak as honestly as you have done just now," she\r\ncontinued, "and you\'ll do."\r\n\r\n"I repel a recommendation so offensive," was the answer, delivered in\r\nthe same pure key, with the same clear look. "I reject counsel poisoned\r\nby insinuation. It is my right to speak as I think proper; nothing binds\r\nme to converse as you dictate. So far from always speaking as I have\r\ndone just now, I shall never address any one in a tone so stern or in\r\nlanguage so harsh, unless in answer to unprovoked insult."\r\n\r\n"Mother, you have found your match," pronounced little Jessie, whom the\r\nscene appeared greatly to edify. Rose had heard the whole with an\r\nunmoved face. She now said, "No; Miss Helstone is not my mother\'s match,\r\nfor she allows herself to be vexed. My mother would wear her out in a\r\nfew weeks. Shirley Keeldar manages better.--Mother, you have never hurt\r\nMiss Keeldar\'s feelings yet. She wears armour under her silk dress that\r\nyou cannot penetrate."\r\n\r\nMrs. Yorke often complained that her children were mutinous. It was\r\nstrange that with all her strictness, with all her "strong-mindedness,"\r\nshe could gain no command over them. A look from their father had more\r\ninfluence with them than a lecture from her.\r\n\r\nMiss Moore--to whom the position of witness to an altercation in which\r\nshe took no part was highly displeasing, as being an unimportant\r\nsecondary post--now rallying her dignity, prepared to utter a discourse\r\nwhich was to prove both parties in the wrong, and to make it clear to\r\neach disputant that she had reason to be ashamed of herself, and ought\r\nto submit humbly to the superior sense of the individual then addressing\r\nher. Fortunately for her audience, she had not harangued above ten\r\nminutes when Sarah\'s entrance with the tea-tray called her attention,\r\nfirst to the fact of that damsel having a gilt comb in her hair and a\r\nred necklace round her throat, and secondly, and subsequently to a\r\npointed remonstrance, to the duty of making tea. After the meal Rose\r\nrestored her to good-humour by bringing her guitar and asking for a\r\nsong, and afterwards engaging her in an intelligent and sharp\r\ncross-examination about guitar-playing and music in general.\r\n\r\nJessie, meantime, directed her assiduities to Caroline. Sitting on a\r\nstool at her feet, she talked to her, first about religion and then\r\nabout politics. Jessie was accustomed at home to drink in a great deal\r\nof what her father said on these subjects, and afterwards in company to\r\nretail, with more wit and fluency than consistency or discretion, his\r\nopinions, antipathies, and preferences. She rated Caroline soundly for\r\nbeing a member of the Established Church, and for having an uncle a\r\nclergyman. She informed her that she lived on the country, and ought to\r\nwork for her living honestly, instead of passing a useless life, and\r\neating the bread of idleness in the shape of tithes. Thence Jessie\r\npassed to a review of the ministry at that time in office, and a\r\nconsideration of its deserts. She made familiar mention of the names of\r\nLord Castlereagh and Mr. Perceval. Each of these personages she adorned\r\nwith a character that might have separately suited Moloch and Belial.\r\nShe denounced the war as wholesale murder, and Lord Wellington as a\r\n"hired butcher."\r\n\r\nHer auditress listened with exceeding edification. Jessie had something\r\nof the genius of humour in her nature. It was inexpressibly comic to\r\nhear her repeating her sire\'s denunciations in his nervous northern\r\nDoric; as hearty a little Jacobin as ever pent a free mutinous spirit in\r\na muslin frock and sash. Not malignant by nature, her language was not\r\nso bitter as it was racy, and the expressive little face gave a piquancy\r\nto every phrase which held a beholder\'s interest captive.\r\n\r\nCaroline chid her when she abused Lord Wellington; but she listened\r\ndelighted to a subsequent tirade against the Prince Regent. Jessie\r\nquickly read, in the sparkle of her hearer\'s eye and the laughter\r\nhovering round her lips, that at last she had hit on a topic that\r\npleased. Many a time had she heard the fat "Adonis of fifty" discussed\r\nat her father\'s breakfast-table, and she now gave Mr. Yorke\'s comments\r\non the theme--genuine as uttered by his Yorkshire lips.\r\n\r\nBut, Jessie, I will write about you no more. This is an autumn evening,\r\nwet and wild. There is only one cloud in the sky, but it curtains it\r\nfrom pole to pole. The wind cannot rest; it hurries sobbing over hills\r\nof sullen outline, colourless with twilight and mist. Rain has beat all\r\nday on that church tower. It rises dark from the stony enclosure of its\r\ngraveyard. The nettles, the long grass, and the tombs all drip with wet.\r\nThis evening reminds me too forcibly of another evening some years\r\nago--a howling, rainy autumn evening too--when certain who had that day\r\nperformed a pilgrimage to a grave new-made in a heretic cemetery sat\r\nnear a wood fire on the hearth of a foreign dwelling. They were merry\r\nand social, but they each knew that a gap, never to be filled, had been\r\nmade in their circle. They knew they had lost something whose absence\r\ncould never be quite atoned for so long as they lived; and they knew\r\nthat heavy falling rain was soaking into the wet earth which covered\r\ntheir lost darling, and that the sad, sighing gale was mourning above\r\nher buried head. The fire warmed them; life and friendship yet blessed\r\nthem; but Jessie lay cold, coffined, solitary--only the sod screening\r\nher from the storm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Yorke folded up her knitting, cut short the music lesson and the\r\nlecture on politics, and concluded her visit to the cottage, at an hour\r\nearly enough to ensure her return to Briarmains before the blush of\r\nsunset should quite have faded in heaven, or the path up the fields have\r\nbecome thoroughly moist with evening dew.\r\n\r\nThe lady and her daughters being gone, Caroline felt that she also ought\r\nto resume her scarf, kiss her cousin\'s cheek, and trip away homeward. If\r\nshe lingered much later dusk would draw on, and Fanny would be put to\r\nthe trouble of coming to fetch her. It was both baking and ironing day\r\nat the rectory, she remembered--Fanny would be busy. Still, she could\r\nnot quit her seat at the little parlour window. From no point of view\r\ncould the west look so lovely as from that lattice with the garland of\r\njessamine round it, whose white stars and green leaves seemed now but\r\ngray pencil outlines--graceful in form, but colourless in tint--against\r\nthe gold incarnadined of a summer evening--against the fire-tinged blue\r\nof an August sky at eight o\'clock p.m.\r\n\r\nCaroline looked at the wicket-gate, beside which holly-oaks spired up\r\ntall. She looked at the close hedge of privet and laurel fencing in the\r\ngarden; her eyes longed to see something more than the shrubs before\r\nthey turned from that limited prospect. They longed to see a human\r\nfigure, of a certain mould and height, pass the hedge and enter the\r\ngate. A human figure she at last saw--nay, two. Frederick Murgatroyd\r\nwent by, carrying a pail of water; Joe Scott followed, dangling on his\r\nforefinger the keys of the mill. They were going to lock up mill and\r\nstables for the night, and then betake themselves home.\r\n\r\n"So must I," thought Caroline, as she half rose and sighed.\r\n\r\n"This is all folly--heart-breaking folly," she added. "In the first\r\nplace, though I should stay till dark there will be no arrival; because\r\nI feel in my heart, Fate has written it down in to-day\'s page of her\r\neternal book, that I am not to have the pleasure I long for. In the\r\nsecond place, if he stepped in this moment, my presence here would be a\r\nchagrin to him, and the consciousness that it must be so would turn half\r\nmy blood to ice. His hand would, perhaps, be loose and chill if I put\r\nmine into it; his eye would be clouded if I sought its beam. I should\r\nlook up for that kindling, something I have seen in past days, when my\r\nface, or my language, or my disposition had at some happy moment pleased\r\nhim; I should discover only darkness. I had better go home."\r\n\r\nShe took her bonnet from the table where it lay, and was just fastening\r\nthe ribbon, when Hortense, directing her attention to a splendid bouquet\r\nof flowers in a glass on the same table, mentioned that Miss Keeldar had\r\nsent them that morning from Fieldhead; and went on to comment on the\r\nguests that lady was at present entertaining, on the bustling life she\r\nhad lately been leading; adding divers conjectures that she did not very\r\nwell like it, and much wonderment that a person who was so fond of her\r\nown way as the heiress did not find some means of sooner getting rid of\r\nthis _cort\xc3\xa9ge_ of relatives.\r\n\r\n"But they say she actually will not let Mr. Sympson and his family go,"\r\nshe added. "They wanted much to return to the south last week, to be\r\nready for the reception of the only son, who is expected home from a\r\ntour. She insists that her cousin Henry shall come and join his friends\r\nhere in Yorkshire. I dare say she partly does it to oblige Robert and\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"How to oblige Robert and you?" inquired Caroline.\r\n\r\n"Why, my child, you are dull. Don\'t you know--you must often have\r\nheard----"\r\n\r\n"Please, ma\'am," said Sarah, opening the door, "the preserves that you\r\ntold me to boil in treacle--the congfiters, as you call them--is all\r\nburnt to the pan."\r\n\r\n"Les confitures! Elles sont br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9es? Ah, quelle n\xc3\xa9gligence coupable!\r\nCoquine de cuisini\xc3\xa8re, fille insupportable!"\r\n\r\nAnd mademoiselle, hastily taking from a drawer a large linen apron, and\r\ntying it over her black apron, rushed _\xc3\xa9perdue_ into the kitchen,\r\nwhence, to speak truth, exhaled an odour of calcined sweets rather\r\nstrong than savoury.\r\n\r\nThe mistress and maid had been in full feud the whole day, on the\r\nsubject of preserving certain black cherries, hard as marbles, sour as\r\nsloes. Sarah held that sugar was the only orthodox condiment to be used\r\nin that process; mademoiselle maintained--and proved it by the practice\r\nand experience of her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother--that\r\ntreacle, "m\xc3\xa9lasse," was infinitely preferable. She had committed an\r\nimprudence in leaving Sarah in charge of the preserving-pan, for her\r\nwant of sympathy in the nature of its contents had induced a degree of\r\ncarelessness in watching their confection, whereof the result was--dark\r\nand cindery ruin. Hubbub followed; high upbraiding, and sobs rather loud\r\nthan deep or real.\r\n\r\nCaroline, once more turning to the little mirror, was shading her\r\nringlets from her cheek to smooth them under her cottage bonnet, certain\r\nthat it would not only be useless but unpleasant to stay longer, when,\r\non the sudden opening of the back-door, there fell an abrupt calm in the\r\nkitchen. The tongues were checked, pulled up as with bit and bridle.\r\n"Was it--was it--Robert?" He often--almost always--entered by the\r\nkitchen way on his return from market. No; it was only Joe Scott, who,\r\nhaving hemmed significantly thrice--every hem being meant as a lofty\r\nrebuke to the squabbling womankind--said, "Now, I thowt I heerd a\r\ncrack?"\r\n\r\nNone answered.\r\n\r\n"And," he continued pragmatically, "as t\' maister\'s comed, and as he\'ll\r\nenter through this hoyle, I _con_sidered it desirable to step in and let\r\nye know. A household o\' women is nivver fit to be comed on wi\'out\r\nwarning. Here he is.--Walk forrard, sir. They war playing up queerly,\r\nbut I think I\'ve quietened \'em."\r\n\r\nAnother person, it was now audible, entered. Joe Scott proceeded with\r\nhis rebukes.\r\n\r\n"What d\'ye mean by being all i\' darkness? Sarah, thou quean, canst t\'\r\nnot light a candle? It war sundown an hour syne. He\'ll brak his shins\r\nagean some o\' yer pots, and tables, and stuff.--Tak tent o\' this\r\nbaking-bowl, sir; they\'ve set it i\' yer way, fair as if they did it i\'\r\nmalice."\r\n\r\nTo Joe\'s observations succeeded a confused sort of pause, which\r\nCaroline, though she was listening with both her ears, could not\r\nunderstand. It was very brief. A cry broke it--a sound of surprise,\r\nfollowed by the sound of a kiss; ejaculations, but half articulate,\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\n"Mon Dieu! mon Dieu! Est-ce que je m\'y attendais?" were the words\r\nchiefly to be distinguished.\r\n\r\n"Et tu te portes toujours bien, bonne s\xc5\x93ur?" inquired another\r\nvoice--Robert\'s, certainly.\r\n\r\nCaroline was puzzled. Obeying an impulse the wisdom of which she had not\r\ntime to question, she escaped from the little parlour, by way of leaving\r\nthe coast clear, and running upstairs took up a position at the head of\r\nthe banisters, whence she could make further observations ere presenting\r\nherself. It was considerably past sunset now; dusk filled the passage,\r\nyet not such deep dusk but that she could presently see Robert and\r\nHortense traverse it.\r\n\r\n"Caroline! Caroline!" called Hortense, a moment afterwards, "venez voir\r\nmon fr\xc3\xa8re!"\r\n\r\n"Strange," commented Miss Helstone, "passing strange! What does this\r\nunwonted excitement about such an every-day occurrence as a return from\r\nmarket portend? She has not lost her senses, has she? Surely the burnt\r\ntreacle has not crazed her?"\r\n\r\nShe descended in a subdued flutter. Yet more was she fluttered when\r\nHortense seized her hand at the parlour door, and leading her to Robert,\r\nwho stood in bodily presence, tall and dark against the one window,\r\npresented her with a mixture of agitation and formality, as though they\r\nhad been utter strangers, and this was their first mutual introduction.\r\n\r\nIncreasing puzzle! He bowed rather awkwardly, and turning from her with\r\na stranger\'s embarrassment, he met the doubtful light from the window.\r\nIt fell on his face, and the enigma of the dream (a dream it seemed)\r\nwas at its height. She saw a visage like and unlike--Robert, and no\r\nRobert.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" said Caroline. "Is my sight wrong? Is it my\r\ncousin?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly it is your cousin," asserted Hortense.\r\n\r\nThen who was this now coming through the passage--now entering the room?\r\nCaroline, looking round, met a new Robert--the real Robert, as she felt\r\nat once.\r\n\r\n"Well," said he, smiling at her questioning, astonished face, "which is\r\nwhich?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, this is _you_!" was the answer.\r\n\r\nHe laughed. "I believe it is _me_. And do you know who _he_ is? You\r\nnever saw him before, but you have heard of him."\r\n\r\nShe had gathered her senses now.\r\n\r\n"It _can_ be only one person--your brother, since it is so like you; my\r\nother cousin, Louis."\r\n\r\n"Clever little \xc5\x92dipus! you would have baffled the Sphinx! But now, see\r\nus together.--Change places; change again, to confuse her, Louis.--Which\r\nis the old love now, Lina?"\r\n\r\n"As if it were possible to make a mistake when you speak! You should\r\nhave told Hortense to ask. But you are not so much alike. It is only\r\nyour height, your figure, and complexion that are so similar."\r\n\r\n"And I am Robert, am I not?" asked the newcomer, making a first effort\r\nto overcome what seemed his natural shyness.\r\n\r\nCaroline shook her head gently. A soft, expressive ray from her eye\r\nbeamed on the real Robert. It said much.\r\n\r\nShe was not permitted to quit her cousins soon. Robert himself was\r\nperemptory in obliging her to remain. Glad, simple, and affable in her\r\ndemeanour (glad for this night, at least), in light, bright spirits for\r\nthe time, she was too pleasant an addition to the cottage circle to be\r\nwillingly parted with by any of them. Louis seemed naturally rather a\r\ngrave, still, retiring man; but the Caroline of this evening, which was\r\nnot (as you know, reader) the Caroline of every day, thawed his reserve,\r\nand cheered his gravity soon. He sat near her and talked to her. She\r\nalready knew his vocation was that of tuition. She learned now he had\r\nfor some years been the tutor of Mr. Sympson\'s son; that he had been\r\ntravelling with him, and had accompanied him to the north. She inquired\r\nif he liked his post, but got a look in reply which did not invite or\r\nlicense further question. The look woke Caroline\'s ready sympathy. She\r\nthought it a very sad expression to pass over so sensible a face as\r\nLouis\'s; for he _had_ a sensible face, though not handsome, she\r\nconsidered, when seen near Robert\'s. She turned to make the comparison.\r\nRobert was leaning against the wall, a little behind her, turning over\r\nthe leaves of a book of engravings, and probably listening, at the same\r\ntime, to the dialogue between her and Louis.\r\n\r\n"How could I think them alike?" she asked herself. "I see now it is\r\nHortense Louis resembles, not Robert."\r\n\r\nAnd this was in part true. He had the shorter nose and longer upper lip\r\nof his sister rather than the fine traits of his brother. He had her\r\nmould of mouth and chin--all less decisive, accurate, and clear than\r\nthose of the young mill-owner. His air, though deliberate and\r\nreflective, could scarcely be called prompt and acute. You felt, in\r\nsitting near and looking up at him, that a slower and probably a more\r\nbenignant nature than that of the elder Moore shed calm on your\r\nimpressions.\r\n\r\nRobert--perhaps aware that Caroline\'s glance had wandered towards and\r\ndwelt upon him, though he had neither met nor answered it--put down the\r\nbook of engravings, and approaching, took a seat at her side. She\r\nresumed her conversation with Louis, but while she talked to him her\r\nthoughts were elsewhere. Her heart beat on the side from which her face\r\nwas half averted. She acknowledged a steady, manly, kindly air in Louis;\r\nbut she bent before the secret power of Robert. To be so near\r\nhim--though he was silent, though he did not touch so much as her\r\nscarf-fringe or the white hem of her dress--affected her like a spell.\r\nHad she been obliged to speak to him _only_, it would have quelled, but,\r\nat liberty to address another, it excited her. Her discourse flowed\r\nfreely; it was gay, playful, eloquent. The indulgent look and placid\r\nmanner of her auditor encouraged her to ease; the sober pleasure\r\nexpressed by his smile drew out all that was brilliant in her nature.\r\nShe felt that this evening she appeared to advantage, and as Robert was\r\na spectator, the consciousness contented her. Had he been called away,\r\ncollapse would at once have succeeded stimulus.\r\n\r\nBut her enjoyment was not long to shine full-orbed; a cloud soon crossed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHortense, who for some time had been on the move ordering supper, and\r\nwas now clearing the little table of some books, etc., to make room for\r\nthe tray, called Robert\'s attention to the glass of flowers, the carmine\r\nand snow and gold of whose petals looked radiant indeed by candlelight.\r\n\r\n"They came from Fieldhead," she said, "intended as a gift to you, no\r\ndoubt. We know who is the favourite there; not I, I\'m sure."\r\n\r\nIt was a wonder to hear Hortense jest--a sign that her spirits were at\r\nhigh-water mark indeed.\r\n\r\n"We are to understand, then, that Robert is the favourite?" observed\r\nLouis.\r\n\r\n"Mon cher," replied Hortense, "Robert--c\'est tout ce qu\'il y a de plus\r\npr\xc3\xa9cieux au monde; \xc3\xa0 c\xc3\xb4t\xc3\xa9 de lui le reste du genre humain n\'est que du\r\nrebut.--N\'ai-je pas raison, mon enfant?" she added, appealing to\r\nCaroline.\r\n\r\nCaroline was obliged to reply, "Yes," and her beacon was quenched. Her\r\nstar withdrew as she spoke.\r\n\r\n"Et toi, Robert?" inquired Louis.\r\n\r\n"When you shall have an opportunity, ask herself," was the quiet answer.\r\nWhether he reddened or paled Caroline did not examine. She discovered\r\nthat it was late, and she must go home. Home she would go; not even\r\nRobert could detain her now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe future sometimes seems to sob a low warning of the events it is\r\nbringing us, like some gathering though yet remote storm, which, in\r\ntones of the wind, in flushings of the firmament, in clouds strangely\r\ntorn, announces a blast strong to strew the sea with wrecks; or\r\ncommissioned to bring in fog the yellow taint of pestilence covering\r\nwhite Western isles with the poisoned exhalations of the East, dimming\r\nthe lattices of English homes with the breath of Indian plague. At other\r\ntimes this future bursts suddenly, as if a rock had rent, and in it a\r\ngrave had opened, whence issues the body of one that slept. Ere you are\r\naware you stand face to face with a shrouded and unthought-of\r\ncalamity--a new Lazarus.\r\n\r\nCaroline Helstone went home from Hollow\'s Cottage in good health, as she\r\nimagined. On waking the next morning she felt oppressed with unwonted\r\nlanguor. At breakfast, at each meal of the following day, she missed all\r\nsense of appetite. Palatable food was as ashes and sawdust to her.\r\n\r\n"Am I ill?" she asked, and looked at herself in the glass. Her eyes were\r\nbright, their pupils dilated, her cheeks seemed rosier, and fuller than\r\nusual. "I look well; why can I not eat?"\r\n\r\nShe felt a pulse beat fast in her temples; she felt, too, her brain in\r\nstrange activity. Her spirits were raised; hundreds of busy and broken\r\nbut brilliant thoughts engaged her mind. A glow rested on them, such as\r\ntinged her complexion.\r\n\r\nNow followed a hot, parched, thirsty, restless night. Towards morning\r\none terrible dream seized her like a tiger; when she woke, she felt and\r\nknew she was ill.\r\n\r\nHow she had caught the fever (fever it was) she could not tell. Probably\r\nin her late walk home, some sweet, poisoned breeze, redolent of\r\nhoney-dew and miasma, had passed into her lungs and veins, and finding\r\nthere already a fever of mental excitement, and a languor of long\r\nconflict and habitual sadness, had fanned the spark to flame, and left a\r\nwell-lit fire behind it.\r\n\r\nIt seemed, however, but a gentle fire. After two hot days and worried\r\nnights, there was no violence in the symptoms, and neither her uncle,\r\nnor Fanny, nor the doctor, nor Miss Keeldar, when she called, had any\r\nfear for her. A few days would restore her, every one believed.\r\n\r\nThe few days passed, and--though it was still thought it could not long\r\ndelay--the revival had not begun. Mrs. Pryor, who had visited her\r\ndaily--being present in her chamber one morning when she had been ill a\r\nfortnight--watched her very narrowly for some minutes. She took her hand\r\nand placed her finger on her wrist; then, quietly leaving the chamber,\r\nshe went to Mr. Helstone\'s study. With him she remained closeted a long\r\ntime--half the morning. On returning to her sick young friend, she laid\r\naside shawl and bonnet. She stood awhile at the bedside, one hand placed\r\nin the other, gently rocking herself to and fro, in an attitude and with\r\na movement habitual to her. At last she said, "I have sent Fanny to\r\nFieldhead to fetch a few things for me, such as I shall want during a\r\nshort stay here. It is my wish to remain with you till you are better.\r\nYour uncle kindly permits my attendance. Will it to yourself be\r\nacceptable, Caroline?"\r\n\r\n"I am sorry you should take such needless trouble. I do not feel very\r\nill, but I cannot refuse resolutely. It will be such comfort to know you\r\nare in the house, to see you sometimes in the room; but don\'t confine\r\nyourself on my account, dear Mrs. Pryor. Fanny nurses me very well."\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor, bending over the pale little sufferer, was now smoothing the\r\nhair under her cap, and gently raising her pillow. As she performed\r\nthese offices, Caroline, smiling, lifted her face to kiss her.\r\n\r\n"Are you free from pain? Are you tolerably at ease?" was inquired in a\r\nlow, earnest voice, as the self-elected nurse yielded to the caress.\r\n\r\n"I think I am almost happy."\r\n\r\n"You wish to drink? Your lips are parched."\r\n\r\nShe held a glass filled with some cooling beverage to her mouth.\r\n\r\n"Have you eaten anything to-day, Caroline?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot eat."\r\n\r\n"But soon your appetite will return; it _must_ return--that is, I pray\r\nGod it may."\r\n\r\nIn laying her again on the couch, she encircled her in her arms; and\r\nwhile so doing, by a movement which seemed scarcely voluntary, she drew\r\nher to her heart, and held her close gathered an instant.\r\n\r\n"I shall hardly wish to get well, that I may keep you always," said\r\nCaroline.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor did not smile at this speech. Over her features ran a tremor,\r\nwhich for some minutes she was absorbed in repressing.\r\n\r\n"You are more used to Fanny than to me," she remarked ere long. "I\r\nshould think my attendance must seem strange, officious?"\r\n\r\n"No; quite natural, and very soothing. You must have been accustomed to\r\nwait on sick people, ma\'am. You move about the room so softly, and you\r\nspeak so quietly, and touch me so gently."\r\n\r\n"I am dexterous in nothing, my dear. You will often find me awkward, but\r\nnever negligent."\r\n\r\nNegligent, indeed, she was not. From that hour Fanny and Eliza became\r\nciphers in the sick-room. Mrs. Pryor made it her domain; she performed\r\nall its duties; she lived in it day and night. The patient\r\nremonstrated--faintly, however, from the first, and not at all ere long.\r\nLoneliness and gloom were now banished from her bedside; protection and\r\nsolace sat there instead. She and her nurse coalesced in wondrous union.\r\nCaroline was usually pained to require or receive much attendance. Mrs.\r\nPryor, under ordinary circumstances, had neither the habit nor the art\r\nof performing little offices of service; but all now passed with such\r\nease, so naturally, that the patient was as willing to be cherished as\r\nthe nurse was bent on cherishing; no sign of weariness in the latter\r\never reminded the former that she ought to be anxious. There was, in\r\nfact, no very hard duty to perform; but a hireling might have found it\r\nhard.\r\n\r\nWith all this care it seemed strange the sick girl did not get well; yet\r\nsuch was the case. She wasted like any snow-wreath in thaw; she faded\r\nlike any flower in drought. Miss Keeldar, on whose thoughts danger or\r\ndeath seldom intruded, had at first entertained no fears at all for her\r\nfriend; but seeing her change and sink from time to time when she paid\r\nher visits, alarm clutched her heart. She went to Mr. Helstone and\r\nexpressed herself with so much energy that that gentleman was at last\r\nobliged, however unwillingly, to admit the idea that his niece was ill\r\nof something more than a migraine; and when Mrs. Pryor came and quietly\r\ndemanded a physician, he said she might send for two if she liked. One\r\ncame, but that one was an oracle. He delivered a dark saying of which\r\nthe future was to solve the mystery, wrote some prescriptions, gave some\r\ndirections--the whole with an air of crushing authority--pocketed his\r\nfee, and went. Probably he knew well enough he could do no good, but\r\ndidn\'t like to say so.\r\n\r\nStill, no rumour of serious illness got wind in the neighbourhood. At\r\nHollow\'s Cottage it was thought that Caroline had only a severe cold,\r\nshe having written a note to Hortense to that effect; and mademoiselle\r\ncontented herself with sending two pots of currant jam, a recipe for a\r\ntisane, and a note of advice.\r\n\r\nMrs. Yorke being told that a physician had been summoned, sneered at the\r\nhypochondriac fancies of the rich and idle, who, she said, having\r\nnothing but themselves to think about, must needs send for a doctor if\r\nonly so much as their little finger ached.\r\n\r\nThe "rich and idle," represented in the person of Caroline, were\r\nmeantime falling fast into a condition of prostration, whose quickly\r\nconsummated debility puzzled all who witnessed it except one; for that\r\none alone reflected how liable is the undermined structure to sink in\r\nsudden ruin.\r\n\r\nSick people often have fancies inscrutable to ordinary attendants, and\r\nCaroline had one which even her tender nurse could not at first explain.\r\nOn a certain day in the week, at a certain hour, she would--whether\r\nworse or better--entreat to be taken up and dressed, and suffered to sit\r\nin her chair near the window. This station she would retain till noon\r\nwas past. Whatever degree of exhaustion or debility her wan aspect\r\nbetrayed, she still softly put off all persuasion to seek repose until\r\nthe church clock had duly tolled midday. The twelve strokes sounded, she\r\ngrew docile, and would meekly lie down. Returned to the couch, she\r\nusually buried her face deep in the pillow, and drew the coverlets close\r\nround her, as if to shut out the world and sun, of which she was tired.\r\nMore than once, as she thus lay, a slight convulsion shook the sick-bed,\r\nand a faint sob broke the silence round it. These things were not\r\nunnoted by Mrs. Pryor.\r\n\r\nOne Tuesday morning, as usual, she had asked leave to rise, and now she\r\nsat wrapped in her white dressing-gown, leaning forward in the\r\neasy-chair, gazing steadily and patiently from the lattice. Mrs. Pryor\r\nwas seated a little behind, knitting as it seemed, but, in truth,\r\nwatching her. A change crossed her pale, mournful brow, animating its\r\nlanguor; a light shot into her faded eyes, reviving their lustre; she\r\nhalf rose and looked earnestly out. Mrs. Pryor, drawing softly near,\r\nglanced over her shoulder. From this window was visible the churchyard,\r\nbeyond it the road; and there, riding sharply by, appeared a horseman.\r\nThe figure was not yet too remote for recognition. Mrs. Pryor had long\r\nsight; she knew Mr. Moore. Just as an intercepting rising ground\r\nconcealed him from view, the clock struck twelve.\r\n\r\n"May I lie down again?" asked Caroline.\r\n\r\nHer nurse assisted her to bed. Having laid her down and drawn the\r\ncurtain, she stood listening near. The little couch trembled, the\r\nsuppressed sob stirred the air. A contraction as of anguish altered Mrs.\r\nPryor\'s features; she wrung her hands; half a groan escaped her lips.\r\nShe now remembered that Tuesday was Whinbury market day. Mr. Moore must\r\nalways pass the rectory on his way thither, just ere noon of that day.\r\n\r\nCaroline wore continually round her neck a slender braid of silk,\r\nattached to which was some trinket. Mrs. Pryor had seen the bit of gold\r\nglisten, but had not yet obtained a fair view of it. Her patient never\r\nparted with it. When dressed it was hidden in her bosom; as she lay in\r\nbed she always held it in her hand. That Tuesday afternoon the transient\r\ndoze--more like lethargy than sleep--which sometimes abridged the long\r\ndays, had stolen over her. The weather was hot. While turning in febrile\r\nrestlessness, she had pushed the coverlets a little aside. Mrs. Pryor\r\nbent to replace them. The small, wasted hand, lying nerveless on the\r\nsick girl\'s breast, clasped as usual her jealously-guarded treasure.\r\nThose fingers whose attenuation it gave pain to see were now relaxed in\r\nsleep. Mrs. Pryor gently disengaged the braid, drawing out a tiny\r\nlocket--a slight thing it was, such as it suited her small purse to\r\npurchase. Under its crystal face appeared a curl of black hair, too\r\nshort and crisp to have been severed from a female head.\r\n\r\nSome agitated movement occasioned a twitch of the silken chain. The\r\nsleeper started and woke. Her thoughts were usually now somewhat\r\nscattered on waking, her look generally wandering. Half rising, as if\r\nin terror, she exclaimed, "Don\'t take it from me, Robert! Don\'t! It is\r\nmy last comfort; let me keep it. I never tell any one whose hair it is;\r\nI never show it."\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor had already disappeared behind the curtain. Reclining far\r\nback in a deep arm-chair by the bedside, she was withdrawn from view.\r\nCaroline looked abroad into the chamber; she thought it empty. As her\r\nstray ideas returned slowly, each folding its weak wings on the mind\'s\r\nsad shore, like birds exhausted, beholding void, and perceiving silence\r\nround her, she believed herself alone. Collected she was not yet;\r\nperhaps healthy self-possession and self-control were to be hers no\r\nmore; perhaps that world the strong and prosperous live in had already\r\nrolled from beneath her feet for ever. So, at least, it often seemed to\r\nherself. In health she had never been accustomed to think aloud, but now\r\nwords escaped her lips unawares.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I _should_ see him once more before all is over! Heaven _might_\r\nfavour me thus far!" she cried. "God grant me a little comfort before I\r\ndie!" was her humble petition.\r\n\r\n"But he will not know I am ill till I am gone, and he will come when\r\nthey have laid me out, and I am senseless, cold, and stiff.\r\n\r\n"What can my departed soul feel then? Can it see or know what happens to\r\nthe clay? Can spirits, through any medium, communicate with living\r\nflesh? Can the dead at all revisit those they leave? Can they come in\r\nthe elements? Will wind, water, fire, lend me a path to Moore?\r\n\r\n"Is it for nothing the wind sounds almost articulately sometimes--sings\r\nas I have lately heard it sing at night--or passes the casement sobbing,\r\nas if for sorrow to come? Does nothing, then, haunt it, nothing inspire\r\nit?\r\n\r\n"Why, it suggested to me words one night; it poured a strain which I\r\ncould have written down, only I was appalled, and dared not rise to seek\r\npencil and paper by the dim watch-light.\r\n\r\n"What is that electricity they speak of, whose changes make us well or\r\nill, whose lack or excess blasts, whose even balance revives? What are\r\nall those influences that are about us in the atmosphere, that keep\r\nplaying over our nerves like fingers on stringed instruments, and call\r\nforth now a sweet note, and now a wail--now an exultant swell, and anon\r\nthe saddest cadence?\r\n\r\n"_Where is_ the other world? In _what_ will another life consist? Why do\r\nI ask? Have I not cause to think that the hour is hasting but too fast\r\nwhen the veil must be rent for me? Do I not know the Grand Mystery is\r\nlikely to burst prematurely on me? Great Spirit, in whose goodness I\r\nconfide, whom, as my Father, I have petitioned night and morning from\r\nearly infancy, help the weak creation of Thy hands! Sustain me through\r\nthe ordeal I dread and must undergo! Give me strength! Give me patience!\r\nGive me--oh, _give me_ FAITH!"\r\n\r\nShe fell back on her pillow. Mrs. Pryor found means to steal quietly\r\nfrom the room. She re-entered it soon after, apparently as composed as\r\nif she had really not overheard this strange soliloquy.\r\n\r\nThe next day several callers came. It had become known that Miss\r\nHelstone was worse. Mr. Hall and his sister Margaret arrived. Both,\r\nafter they had been in the sickroom, quitted it in tears; they had found\r\nthe patient more altered than they expected. Hortense Moore came.\r\nCaroline seemed stimulated by her presence. She assured her, smiling,\r\nshe was not dangerously ill; she talked to her in a low voice, but\r\ncheerfully. During her stay, excitement kept up the flush of her\r\ncomplexion; she looked better.\r\n\r\n"How is Mr. Robert?" asked Mrs. Pryor, as Hortense was preparing to take\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n"He was very well when he left."\r\n\r\n"Left! Is he gone from home?"\r\n\r\nIt was then explained that some police intelligence about the rioters of\r\nwhom he was in pursuit had, that morning, called him away to Birmingham,\r\nand probably a fortnight might elapse ere he returned.\r\n\r\n"He is not aware that Miss Helstone is very ill?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no! He thought, like me, that she had only a bad cold."\r\n\r\nAfter this visit, Mrs. Pryor took care not to approach Caroline\'s couch\r\nfor above an hour. She heard her weep, and dared not look on her tears.\r\n\r\nAs evening closed in, she brought her some tea. Caroline, opening her\r\neyes from a moment\'s slumber, viewed her nurse with an unrecognizing\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n"I smelt the honeysuckles in the glen this summer morning," she said,\r\n"as I stood at the counting-house window."\r\n\r\nStrange words like these from pallid lips pierce a loving listener\'s\r\nheart more poignantly than steel. They sound romantic, perhaps, in\r\nbooks; in real life they are harrowing.\r\n\r\n"My darling, do you know me?" said Mrs. Pryor.\r\n\r\n"I went in to call Robert to breakfast. I have been with him in the\r\ngarden. He asked me to go. A heavy dew has refreshed the flowers. The\r\npeaches are ripening."\r\n\r\n"My darling! my darling!" again and again repeated the nurse.\r\n\r\n"I thought it was daylight--long after sunrise. It looks dark. Is the\r\nmoon now set?"\r\n\r\nThat moon, lately risen, was gazing full and mild upon her. Floating in\r\ndeep blue space, it watched her unclouded.\r\n\r\n"Then it is not morning? I am not at the cottage? Who is this? I see a\r\nshape at my bedside."\r\n\r\n"It is myself--it is your friend--your nurse--your---- Lean your head on\r\nmy shoulder. Collect yourself." In a lower tone--"O God, take pity! Give\r\n_her_ life, and _me_ strength! Send me courage! Teach me words!"\r\n\r\nSome minutes passed in silence. The patient lay mute and passive in the\r\ntrembling arms, on the throbbing bosom of the nurse.\r\n\r\n"I am better now," whispered Caroline at last, "much better. I feel\r\nwhere I am. This is Mrs. Pryor near me. I was dreaming. I talk when I\r\nwake up from dreams; people often do in illness. How fast your heart\r\nbeats, ma\'am! Do not be afraid."\r\n\r\n"It is not fear, child--only a little anxiety, which will pass. I have\r\nbrought you some tea, Cary. Your uncle made it himself. You know he says\r\nhe can make a better cup of tea than any housewife can. Taste it. He is\r\nconcerned to hear that you eat so little; he would be glad if you had a\r\nbetter appetite."\r\n\r\n"I am thirsty. Let me drink."\r\n\r\nShe drank eagerly.\r\n\r\n"What o\'clock is it, ma\'am?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Past nine."\r\n\r\n"Not later? Oh! I have yet a long night before me. But the tea has made\r\nme strong. I will sit up."\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor raised her, and arranged her pillows.\r\n\r\n"Thank Heaven! I am not always equally miserable, and ill, and hopeless.\r\nThe afternoon has been bad since Hortense went; perhaps the evening may\r\nbe better. It is a fine night, I think? The moon shines clear."\r\n\r\n"Very fine--a perfect summer night. The old church-tower gleams white\r\nalmost as silver."\r\n\r\n"And does the churchyard look peaceful?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and the garden also. Dew glistens on the foliage."\r\n\r\n"Can you see many long weeds and nettles amongst the graves? or do they\r\nlook turfy and flowery?"\r\n\r\n"I see closed daisy-heads gleaming like pearls on some mounds. Thomas\r\nhas mown down the dock-leaves and rank grass, and cleared all away."\r\n\r\n"I always like that to be done; it soothes one\'s mind to see the place\r\nin order. And, I dare say, within the church just now that moonlight\r\nshines as softly as in my room. It will fall through the east window\r\nfull on the Helstone monument. When I close my eyes I seem to see poor\r\npapa\'s epitaph in black letters on the white marble. There is plenty of\r\nroom for other inscriptions underneath."\r\n\r\n"William Farren came to look after your flowers this morning. He was\r\nafraid, now you cannot tend them yourself, they would be neglected. He\r\nhas taken two of your favourite plants home to nurse for you."\r\n\r\n"If I were to make a will, I would leave William all my plants; Shirley\r\nmy trinkets--except one, which must not be taken off my neck; and you,\r\nma\'am, my books." After a pause--"Mrs. Pryor, I feel a longing wish for\r\nsomething."\r\n\r\n"For what, Caroline?"\r\n\r\n"You know I always delight to hear you sing. Sing me a hymn just now.\r\nSing that hymn which begins,--\r\n\r\n    \'Our God, our help in ages past,\r\n       Our hope for years to come,\r\n     Our shelter from the stormy blast,\r\n       Our refuge, haven, home!\'"\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor at once complied.\r\n\r\nNo wonder Caroline liked to hear her sing. Her voice, even in speaking,\r\nwas sweet and silver clear; in song it was almost divine. Neither flute\r\nnor dulcimer has tones so pure. But the tone was secondary, compared to\r\nthe expression which trembled through--a tender vibration from a feeling\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe servants in the kitchen, hearing the strain, stole to the stair-foot\r\nto listen. Even old Helstone, as he walked in the garden, pondering over\r\nthe unaccountable and feeble nature of women, stood still amongst his\r\nborders to catch the mournful melody more distinctly. Why it reminded\r\nhim of his forgotten dead wife, he could not tell; nor why it made him\r\nmore concerned than he had hitherto been for Caroline\'s fading girlhood.\r\nHe was glad to recollect that he had promised to pay Wynne, the\r\nmagistrate, a visit that evening. Low spirits and gloomy thoughts were\r\nvery much his aversion. When they attacked him he usually found means to\r\nmake them march in double-quick time. The hymn followed him faintly as\r\nhe crossed the fields. He hastened his customary sharp pace, that he\r\nmight get beyond its reach.\r\n\r\n    "Thy word commands our flesh to dust,--\r\n       \'Return, ye sons of men;\'\r\n     All nations rose from earth at first,\r\n       And turn to earth again.\r\n\r\n    "A thousand ages in Thy sight\r\n       Are like an evening gone--\r\n     Short as the watch that ends the night\r\n       Before the rising sun.\r\n\r\n    "Time, like an ever-rolling stream,\r\n       Bears all its sons away;\r\n     They fly, forgotten, as a dream\r\n       Dies at the opening day.\r\n\r\n    "Like flowery fields, the nations stand,\r\n       Fresh in the morning light;\r\n     The flowers beneath the mower\'s hand\r\n       Lie withering ere \'tis night.\r\n\r\n    "Our God, our help in ages past,\r\n       Our hope for years to come,\r\n     Be Thou our guard while troubles last--\r\n       O Father, be our home!"\r\n\r\n"Now sing a song--a Scottish song," suggested Caroline, when the hymn\r\nwas over--"\'Ye banks and braes o\' bonnie Doon.\'"\r\n\r\nAgain Mrs. Pryor obeyed, or essayed to obey. At the close of the first\r\nstanza she stopped. She could get no further. Her full heart flowed\r\nover.\r\n\r\n"You are weeping at the pathos of the air. Come here, and I will comfort\r\nyou," said Caroline, in a pitying accent. Mrs. Pryor came. She sat down\r\non the edge of her patient\'s bed, and allowed the wasted arms to\r\nencircle her.\r\n\r\n"You often soothe me; let me soothe you," murmured the young girl,\r\nkissing her cheek. "I hope," she added, "it is not for me you weep?"\r\n\r\nNo answer followed.\r\n\r\n"Do you think I shall not get better? I do not feel _very_ ill--only\r\nweak."\r\n\r\n"But your mind, Caroline--your mind is crushed. Your heart is almost\r\nbroken; you have been so neglected, so repulsed, left so desolate."\r\n\r\n"I believe grief is, and always has been, my worst ailment. I sometimes\r\nthink if an abundant gush of happiness came on me I could revive yet."\r\n\r\n"Do you wish to live?"\r\n\r\n"I have no object in life."\r\n\r\n"You love me, Caroline?"\r\n\r\n"Very much--very truly--inexpressibly sometimes. Just now I feel as if I\r\ncould almost grow to your heart."\r\n\r\n"I will return directly, dear," remarked Mrs. Pryor, as she laid\r\nCaroline down.\r\n\r\nQuitting her, she glided to the door, softly turned the key in the lock,\r\nascertained that it was fast, and came back. She bent over her. She\r\nthrew back the curtain to admit the moonlight more freely. She gazed\r\nintently on her face.\r\n\r\n"Then, if you love me," said she, speaking quickly, with an altered\r\nvoice; "if you feel as if, to use your own words, you could \'grow to my\r\nheart,\' it will be neither shock nor pain for you to know that _that_\r\nheart is the source whence yours was filled; that from _my_ veins issued\r\nthe tide which flows in _yours_; that you are _mine_--my daughter--my\r\nown child."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Pryor----"\r\n\r\n"My own child!"\r\n\r\n"That is--that means--you have adopted me?"\r\n\r\n"It means that, if I have given you nothing else, I at least gave you\r\nlife; that I bore you, nursed you; that I am your true mother. No other\r\nwoman can claim the title; it is _mine_."\r\n\r\n"But Mrs. James Helstone--but my father\'s wife, whom I do not remember\r\never to have seen, she is my mother?"\r\n\r\n"She _is_ your mother. James Helstone was _my_ husband. I say you are\r\n_mine_. I have proved it. I thought perhaps you were all his, which\r\nwould have been a cruel dispensation for me. I find it is _not_ so. God\r\npermitted me to be the parent of my child\'s mind. It belongs to me; it\r\nis my property--my _right_. These features are James\'s own. He had a\r\nfine face when he was young, and not altered by error. Papa, my darling,\r\ngave you your blue eyes and soft brown hair; he gave you the oval of\r\nyour face and the regularity of your lineaments--the outside _he_\r\nconferred; but the heart and the brain are _mine_. The germs are from\r\n_me_, and they are improved, they are developed to excellence. I esteem\r\nand approve my child as highly as I do most fondly love her."\r\n\r\n"Is what I hear true? Is it no dream?"\r\n\r\n"I wish it were as true that the substance and colour of health were\r\nrestored to your cheek."\r\n\r\n"My own mother! is she one I can be so fond of as I can of you? People\r\ngenerally did not like her--so I have been given to understand."\r\n\r\n"They told you that? Well, your mother now tells you that, not having\r\nthe gift to please people generally, for their approbation she does not\r\ncare. Her thoughts are centred in her child. Does that child welcome or\r\nreject her?"\r\n\r\n"But if you _are_ my mother, the world is all changed to me. Surely I\r\ncan live. I should like to recover----"\r\n\r\n"You _must_ recover. You drew life and strength from my breast when you\r\nwere a tiny, fair infant, over whose blue eyes I used to weep, fearing I\r\nbeheld in your very beauty the sign of qualities that had entered my\r\nheart like iron, and pierced through my soul like a sword. Daughter! we\r\nhave been long parted; I return now to cherish you again."\r\n\r\nShe held her to her bosom; she cradled her in her arms; she rocked her\r\nsoftly, as if lulling a young child to sleep.\r\n\r\n"My mother--my own mother!"\r\n\r\nThe offspring nestled to the parent; that parent, feeling the endearment\r\nand hearing the appeal, gathered her closer still. She covered her with\r\nnoiseless kisses; she murmured love over her, like a cushat fostering\r\nits young.\r\n\r\nThere was silence in the room for a long while.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Does my uncle know?"\r\n\r\n"Your uncle knows. I told him when I first came to stay with you here."\r\n\r\n"Did you recognize me when we first met at Fieldhead?"\r\n\r\n"How could it be otherwise? Mr. and Miss Helstone being announced, I was\r\nprepared to see my child."\r\n\r\n"It was that, then, which moved you. I saw you disturbed."\r\n\r\n"You saw nothing, Caroline; I can cover my feelings. You can never tell\r\nwhat an age of strange sensation I lived, during the two minutes that\r\nelapsed between the report of your name and your entrance. You can never\r\ntell how your look, mien, carriage, shook me."\r\n\r\n"Why? Were you disappointed?"\r\n\r\n"What will she be like? I had asked myself; and when I saw what you were\r\nlike, I could have dropped."\r\n\r\n"Mamma, why?"\r\n\r\n"I trembled in your presence. I said, I will never own her; she shall\r\nnever know me."\r\n\r\n"But I said and did nothing remarkable. I felt a little diffident at the\r\nthought of an introduction to strangers--that was all."\r\n\r\n"I soon saw you were diffident. That was the first thing which reassured\r\nme. Had you been rustic, clownish, awkward, I should have been content."\r\n\r\n"You puzzle me."\r\n\r\n"I had reason to dread a fair outside, to mistrust a popular bearing, to\r\nshudder before distinction, grace, and courtesy. Beauty and affability\r\nhad come in my way when I was recluse, desolate, young, and ignorant--a\r\ntoil-worn governess perishing of uncheered labour, breaking down before\r\nher time. These, Caroline, when they smiled on me, I mistook for angels.\r\nI followed them home; and when into their hands I had given without\r\nreserve my whole chance of future happiness, it was my lot to witness a\r\ntransfiguration on the domestic hearth--to see the white mask lifted,\r\nthe bright disguise put away, and opposite me sat down---- O God, I\r\n_have_ suffered!"\r\n\r\nShe sank on the pillow.\r\n\r\n"I _have_ suffered! None saw--none knew. There was no sympathy, no\r\nredemption, no redress!"\r\n\r\n"Take comfort, mother. It is over now."\r\n\r\n"It is over, and not fruitlessly. I tried to keep the word of His\r\npatience. He kept me in the days of my anguish. I was afraid with\r\nterror--I was troubled. Through great tribulation He brought me through\r\nto a salvation revealed in this last time. My fear had torment; He has\r\ncast it out. He has given me in its stead perfect love. But,\r\nCaroline----"\r\n\r\nThus she invoked her daughter after a pause.\r\n\r\n"Mother!"\r\n\r\n"I charge you, when you next look on your father\'s monument, to respect\r\nthe name chiselled there. To you he did only good. On you he conferred\r\nhis whole treasure of beauties, nor added to them one dark defect. All\r\n_you_ derived from him is excellent. You owe him gratitude. Leave,\r\nbetween him and me, the settlement of our mutual account. Meddle not.\r\nGod is the arbiter. This world\'s laws never came near us--never! They\r\nwere powerless as a rotten bulrush to protect me--impotent as idiot\r\nbabblings to restrain him! As you said, it is all over now; the grave\r\nlies between us. There he sleeps, in that church. To his dust I say this\r\nnight, what I have never said before, \'James, slumber peacefully! See!\r\nyour terrible debt is cancelled! Look! I wipe out the long, black\r\naccount with my own hand! James, your child atones. This living likeness\r\nof you--this thing with your perfect features--this one good gift you\r\ngave me has nestled affectionately to my heart, and tenderly called me\r\n"mother." Husband, rest forgiven!\'"\r\n\r\n"Dearest mother, that is right! Can papa\'s spirit hear us? Is he\r\ncomforted to know that we still love him?"\r\n\r\n"I said nothing of love. I spoke of forgiveness. Mind the truth, child;\r\nI said nothing of love! On the threshold of eternity, should he be there\r\nto see me enter, will I maintain that."\r\n\r\n"O mother, you must have suffered!"\r\n\r\n"O child, the human heart _can_ suffer! It can hold more tears than the\r\nocean holds waters. We never know how deep, how wide it is, till misery\r\nbegins to unbind her clouds, and fill it with rushing blackness."\r\n\r\n"Mother, forget."\r\n\r\n"Forget!" she said, with the strangest spectre of a laugh. "The north\r\npole will rush to the south, and the headlands of Europe be locked into\r\nthe bays of Australia ere I forget."\r\n\r\n"Hush, mother! Rest! Be at peace!"\r\n\r\nAnd the child lulled the parent, as the parent had erst lulled the\r\nchild. At last Mrs. Pryor wept. She then grew calmer. She resumed those\r\ntender cares agitation had for a moment suspended. Replacing her\r\ndaughter on the couch, she smoothed the pillow and spread the sheet. The\r\nsoft hair whose locks were loosened she rearranged, the damp brow she\r\nrefreshed with a cool, fragrant essence.\r\n\r\n"Mamma, let them bring a candle, that I may see you; and tell my uncle\r\nto come into this room by-and-by. I want to hear him say that I am your\r\ndaughter. And, mamma, take your supper here. Don\'t leave me for one\r\nminute to-night."\r\n\r\n"O Caroline, it is well you are gentle! You will say to me, Go, and I\r\nshall go; Come, and I shall come; Do this, and I shall do it. You\r\ninherit a certain manner as well as certain features. It will always be\r\n\'mamma\' prefacing a mandate--softly spoken, though, from you, thank God!\r\nWell," she added, under her breath, "he spoke softly too, once, like a\r\nflute breathing tenderness; and then, when the world was not by to\r\nlisten, discords that split the nerves and curdled the blood--sounds to\r\ninspire insanity."\r\n\r\n"It seems so natural, mamma, to ask you for this and that. I shall want\r\nnobody but you to be near me, or to do anything for me. But do not let\r\nme be troublesome. Check me if I encroach."\r\n\r\n"You must not depend on me to check you; you must keep guard over\r\nyourself. I have little moral courage; the want of it is my bane. It is\r\nthat which has made me an unnatural parent--which has kept me apart from\r\nmy child during the ten years which have elapsed since my husband\'s\r\ndeath left me at liberty to claim her. It was that which first unnerved\r\nmy arms and permitted the infant I might have retained a while longer to\r\nbe snatched prematurely from their embrace."\r\n\r\n"How, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"I let you go as a babe, because you were pretty, and I feared your\r\nloveliness, deeming it the stamp of perversity. They sent me your\r\nportrait, taken at eight years old; that portrait confirmed my fears.\r\nHad it shown me a sunburnt little rustic--a heavy, blunt-featured,\r\ncommonplace child--I should have hastened to claim you; but there, under\r\nthe silver paper, I saw blooming the delicacy of an aristocratic\r\nflower--\'little lady\' was written on every trait. I had too recently\r\ncrawled from under the yoke of the fine gentleman--escaped galled,\r\ncrushed, paralyzed, dying--to dare to encounter his still finer and most\r\nfairy-like representative. My sweet little lady overwhelmed me with\r\ndismay; her air of native elegance froze my very marrow. In my\r\nexperience I had not met with truth, modesty, good principle as the\r\nconcomitants of beauty. A form so straight and fine, I argued, must\r\nconceal a mind warped and cruel. I had little faith in the power of\r\neducation to rectify such a mind; or rather, I entirely misdoubted my\r\nown ability to influence it. Caroline, I dared not undertake to rear\r\nyou. I resolved to leave you in your uncle\'s hands. Matthewson Helstone\r\nI knew, if an austere, was an upright man. He and all the world thought\r\nhardly of me for my strange, unmotherly resolve, and I deserved to be\r\nmisjudged."\r\n\r\n"Mamma, why did you call yourself Mrs. Pryor?"\r\n\r\n"It was a name in my mother\'s family. I adopted it that I might live\r\nunmolested. My married name recalled too vividly my married life; I\r\ncould not bear it. Besides, threats were uttered of forcing me to return\r\nto bondage. It could not be. Rather a bier for a bed, the grave for a\r\nhome. My new name sheltered me. I resumed under its screen my old\r\noccupation of teaching. At first it scarcely procured me the means of\r\nsustaining life; but how savoury was hunger when I fasted in peace! How\r\nsafe seemed the darkness and chill of an unkindled hearth when no lurid\r\nreflection from terror crimsoned its desolation! How serene was\r\nsolitude, when I feared not the irruption of violence and vice!"\r\n\r\n"But, mamma, you have been in this neighbourhood before. How did it\r\nhappen that when you reappeared here with Miss Keeldar you were not\r\nrecognized?"\r\n\r\n"I only paid a short visit, as a bride, twenty years ago, and then I was\r\nvery different to what I am now--slender, almost as slender as my\r\ndaughter is at this day. My complexion, my very features are changed; my\r\nhair, my style of dress--everything is altered. You cannot fancy me a\r\nslim young person, attired in scanty drapery of white muslin, with bare\r\narms, bracelets and necklace of beads, and hair disposed in round\r\nGrecian curls above my forehead?"\r\n\r\n"You must, indeed, have been different. Mamma, I heard the front door\r\nopen. If it is my uncle coming in, just ask him to step upstairs, and\r\nlet me hear his assurance that I am truly awake and collected, and not\r\ndreaming or delirious."\r\n\r\nThe rector, of his own accord, was mounting the stairs, and Mrs. Pryor\r\nsummoned him to his niece\'s apartment.\r\n\r\n"She\'s not worse, I hope?" he inquired hastily.\r\n\r\n"I think her better. She is disposed to converse; she seems stronger."\r\n\r\n"Good!" said he, brushing quickly into the room.--"Ha, Cary! how do? Did\r\nyou drink my cup of tea? I made it for you just as I like it myself."\r\n\r\n"I drank it every drop, uncle. It did me good; it has made me quite\r\nalive. I have a wish for company, so I begged Mrs. Pryor to call you\r\nin."\r\n\r\nThe respected ecclesiastic looked pleased, and yet embarrassed. He was\r\nwilling enough to bestow his company on his sick niece for ten minutes,\r\nsince it was her whim to wish it; but what means to employ for her\r\nentertainment he knew not. He hemmed--he fidgeted.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be up in a trice," he observed, by way of saying something. "The\r\nlittle weakness will soon pass off; and then you must drink port wine--a\r\npipe, if you can--and eat game and oysters. I\'ll get them for you, if\r\nthey are to be had anywhere. Bless me! we\'ll make you as strong as\r\nSamson before we\'re done with you."\r\n\r\n"Who is that lady, uncle, standing beside you at the bed-foot?"\r\n\r\n"Good God!" he ejaculated. "She\'s not wandering, is she, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor smiled.\r\n\r\n"I am wandering in a pleasant world," said Caroline, in a soft, happy\r\nvoice, "and I want you to tell me whether it is real or visionary. What\r\nlady is that? Give her a name, uncle."\r\n\r\n"We must have Dr. Rile again, ma\'am; or better still, MacTurk. He\'s less\r\nof a humbug. Thomas must saddle the pony and go for him."\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t want a doctor. Mamma shall be my only physician. Now, do\r\nyou understand, uncle?"\r\n\r\nMr. Helstone pushed up his spectacles from his nose to his forehead,\r\nhandled his snuff-box, and administered to himself a portion of the\r\ncontents. Thus fortified, he answered briefly, "I see daylight. You\'ve\r\ntold her then, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"And is it _true_?" demanded Caroline, rising on her pillow. "Is she\r\n_really_ my mother?"\r\n\r\n"You won\'t cry, or make any scene, or turn hysterical, if I answer Yes?"\r\n\r\n"Cry! I\'d cry if you said _No_. It would be terrible to be disappointed\r\nnow. But give her a name. How do you call her?"\r\n\r\n"I call this stout lady in a quaint black dress, who looks young enough\r\nto wear much smarter raiment, if she would--I call her Agnes Helstone.\r\nShe married my brother James, and is his widow."\r\n\r\n"And my mother?"\r\n\r\n"What a little sceptic it is! Look at her small face, Mrs. Pryor,\r\nscarcely larger than the palm of my hand, alive with acuteness and\r\neagerness." To Caroline--"She had the trouble of bringing you into the\r\nworld at any rate. Mind you show your duty to her by quickly getting\r\nwell, and repairing the waste of these cheeks.--Heigh-ho! she used to be\r\nplump. What she has done with it all I can\'t, for the life of me,\r\ndivine."\r\n\r\n"If _wishing_ to get well will help me, I shall not be long sick. This\r\nmorning I had no reason and no strength to wish it."\r\n\r\nFanny here tapped at the door, and said that supper was ready.\r\n\r\n"Uncle, if you please, you may send me a little bit of supper--anything\r\nyou like, from your own plate. That is wiser than going into hysterics,\r\nis it not?"\r\n\r\n"It is spoken like a sage, Cary. See if I don\'t cater for you\r\njudiciously. When women are sensible, and, above all, intelligible, I\r\ncan get on with them. It is only the vague, superfine sensations, and\r\nextremely wire-drawn notions, that put me about. Let a woman ask me to\r\ngive her an edible or a wearable--be the same a roc\'s egg or the\r\nbreastplate of Aaron, a share of St. John\'s locusts and honey or the\r\nleathern girdle about his loins--I can, at least, understand the demand;\r\nbut when they pine for they know not what--sympathy, sentiment, some of\r\nthese indefinite abstractions--I can\'t do it; I don\'t know it; I haven\'t\r\ngot it.--Madam, accept my arm."\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor signified that she should stay with her daughter that\r\nevening. Helstone, accordingly, left them together. He soon returned,\r\nbringing a plate in his own consecrated hand.\r\n\r\n"This is chicken," he said, "but we\'ll have partridge to-morrow.--Lift\r\nher up, and put a shawl over her. On my word, I understand\r\nnursing.--Now, here is the very same little silver fork you used when\r\nyou first came to the rectory. That strikes me as being what you may\r\ncall a happy thought--a delicate attention. Take it, Cary, and munch\r\naway cleverly."\r\n\r\nCaroline did her best. Her uncle frowned to see that her powers were so\r\nlimited. He prophesied, however, great things for the future; and as she\r\npraised the morsel he had brought, and smiled gratefully in his face, he\r\nstooped over her pillow, kissed her, and said, with a broken, rugged\r\naccent, "Good-night, bairnie! God bless thee!"\r\n\r\nCaroline enjoyed such peaceful rest that night, circled by her mother\'s\r\narms, and pillowed on her breast, that she forgot to wish for any other\r\nstay; and though more than one feverish dream came to her in slumber,\r\nyet, when she woke up panting, so happy and contented a feeling returned\r\nwith returning consciousness that her agitation was soothed almost as\r\nsoon as felt.\r\n\r\nAs to the mother, she spent the night like Jacob at Peniel. Till break\r\nof day she wrestled with God in earnest prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE WEST WIND BLOWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot always do those who dare such divine conflict prevail. Night after\r\nnight the sweat of agony may burst dark on the forehead; the supplicant\r\nmay cry for mercy with that soundless voice the soul utters when its\r\nappeal is to the Invisible. "Spare my beloved," it may implore. "Heal my\r\nlife\'s life. Rend not from me what long affection entwines with my whole\r\nnature. God of heaven, bend, hear, be clement!" And after this cry and\r\nstrife the sun may rise and see him worsted. That opening morn, which\r\nused to salute him with the whisper of zephyrs, the carol of skylarks,\r\nmay breathe, as its first accents, from the dear lips which colour and\r\nheat have quitted, "Oh! I have had a suffering night. This morning I am\r\nworse. I have tried to rise. I cannot. Dreams I am unused to have\r\ntroubled me."\r\n\r\nThen the watcher approaches the patient\'s pillow, and sees a new and\r\nstrange moulding of the familiar features, feels at once that the\r\ninsufferable moment draws nigh, knows that it is God\'s will his idol\r\nshall be broken, and bends his head, and subdues his soul to the\r\nsentence he cannot avert and scarce can bear.\r\n\r\nHappy Mrs. Pryor! She was still praying, unconscious that the summer sun\r\nhung above the hills, when her child softly woke in her arms. No\r\npiteous, unconscious moaning--sound which so wastes our strength that,\r\neven if we have sworn to be firm, a rush of unconquerable tears sweeps\r\naway the oath--preceded her waking. No space of deaf apathy followed.\r\nThe first words spoken were not those of one becoming estranged from\r\nthis world, and already permitted to stray at times into realms foreign\r\nto the living. Caroline evidently remembered with clearness what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n"Mamma, I have slept _so_ well. I only dreamed and woke twice."\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor rose with a start, that her daughter might not see the joyful\r\ntears called into her eyes by that affectionate word "mamma," and the\r\nwelcome assurance that followed it.\r\n\r\nFor many days the mother dared rejoice only with trembling. That first\r\nrevival seemed like the flicker of a dying lamp. If the flame streamed\r\nup bright one moment, the next it sank dim in the socket. Exhaustion\r\nfollowed close on excitement.\r\n\r\nThere was always a touching endeavour to _appear_ better, but too often\r\nability refused to second will; too often the attempt to bear up failed.\r\nThe effort to eat, to talk, to look cheerful, was unsuccessful. Many an\r\nhour passed during which Mrs. Pryor feared that the chords of life could\r\nnever more be strengthened, though the time of their breaking might be\r\ndeferred.\r\n\r\nDuring this space the mother and daughter seemed left almost alone in\r\nthe neighbourhood. It was the close of August; the weather was\r\nfine--that is to say, it was very dry and very dusty, for an arid wind\r\nhad been blowing from the east this month past; very cloudless, too,\r\nthough a pale haze, stationary in the atmosphere, seemed to rob of all\r\ndepth of tone the blue of heaven, of all freshness the verdure of earth,\r\nand of all glow the light of day. Almost every family in Briarfield was\r\nabsent on an excursion. Miss Keeldar and her friends were at the\r\nseaside; so were Mrs. Yorke\'s household. Mr. Hall and Louis Moore,\r\nbetween whom a spontaneous intimacy seemed to have arisen--the result,\r\nprobably, of harmony of views and temperament--were gone "up north" on a\r\npedestrian excursion to the Lakes. Even Hortense, who would fain have\r\nstayed at home and aided Mrs. Pryor in nursing Caroline, had been so\r\nearnestly entreated by Miss Mann to accompany her once more to Wormwood\r\nWells, in the hope of alleviating sufferings greatly aggravated by the\r\ninsalubrious weather, that she felt obliged to comply; indeed, it was\r\nnot in her nature to refuse a request that at once appealed to her\r\ngoodness of heart, and, by a confession of dependency, flattered her\r\n_amour propre_. As for Robert, from Birmingham he had gone on to London,\r\nwhere he still sojourned.\r\n\r\nSo long as the breath of Asiatic deserts parched Caroline\'s lips and\r\nfevered her veins, her physical convalescence could not keep pace with\r\nher returning mental tranquillity; but there came a day when the wind\r\nceased to sob at the eastern gable of the rectory, and at the oriel\r\nwindow of the church. A little cloud like a man\'s hand arose in the\r\nwest; gusts from the same quarter drove it on and spread it wide; wet\r\nand tempest prevailed a while. When that was over the sun broke out\r\ngenially, heaven regained its azure, and earth its green; the livid\r\ncholera-tint had vanished from the face of nature; the hills rose clear\r\nround the horizon, absolved from that pale malaria-haze.\r\n\r\nCaroline\'s youth could now be of some avail to her, and so could her\r\nmother\'s nurture. Both, crowned by God\'s blessing, sent in the pure west\r\nwind blowing soft as fresh through the ever-open chamber lattice,\r\nrekindled her long-languishing energies. At last Mrs. Pryor saw that it\r\nwas permitted to hope: a genuine, material convalescence had commenced.\r\nIt was not merely Caroline\'s smile which was brighter, or her spirits\r\nwhich were cheered, but a certain look had passed from her face and\r\neye--a look dread and indescribable, but which will easily be recalled\r\nby those who have watched the couch of dangerous disease. Long before\r\nthe emaciated outlines of her aspect began to fill, or its departed\r\ncolour to return, a more subtle change took place; all grew softer and\r\nwarmer. Instead of a marble mask and glassy eye, Mrs. Pryor saw laid on\r\nthe pillow a face pale and wasted enough, perhaps more haggard than the\r\nother appearance, but less awful; for it was a sick, living girl, not a\r\nmere white mould or rigid piece of statuary.\r\n\r\nNow, too, she was not always petitioning to drink. The words, "I am _so_\r\nthirsty," ceased to be her plaint. Sometimes, when she had swallowed a\r\nmorsel, she would say it had revived her. All descriptions of food were\r\nno longer equally distasteful; she could be induced, sometimes, to\r\nindicate a preference. With what trembling pleasure and anxious care did\r\nnot her nurse prepare what was selected! How she watched her as she\r\npartook of it!\r\n\r\nNourishment brought strength. She could sit up. Then she longed to\r\nbreathe the fresh air, to revisit her flowers, to see how the fruit had\r\nripened. Her uncle, always liberal, had bought a garden-chair for her\r\nexpress use. He carried her down in his own arms, and placed her in it\r\nhimself, and William Farren was there to wheel her round the walks, to\r\nshow her what he had done amongst her plants, to take her directions for\r\nfurther work.\r\n\r\nWilliam and she found plenty to talk about. They had a dozen topics in\r\ncommon--interesting to them, unimportant to the rest of the world. They\r\ntook a similar interest in animals, birds, insects, and plants; they\r\nheld similar doctrines about humanity to the lower creation, and had a\r\nsimilar turn for minute observation on points of natural history. The\r\nnest and proceedings of some ground-bees, which had burrowed in the turf\r\nunder an old cherry-tree, was one subject of interest; the haunts of\r\ncertain hedge-sparrows, and the welfare of certain pearly eggs and\r\ncallow fledglings, another.\r\n\r\nHad _Chambers\'s Journal_ existed in those days, it would certainly have\r\nformed Miss Helstone\'s and Farren\'s favourite periodical. She would have\r\nsubscribed for it, and to him each number would duly have been lent;\r\nboth would have put implicit faith and found great savour in its\r\nmarvellous anecdotes of animal sagacity.\r\n\r\nThis is a digression, but it suffices to explain why Caroline would have\r\nno other hand than William\'s to guide her chair, and why his society and\r\nconversation sufficed to give interest to her garden-airings.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor, walking near, wondered how her daughter could be so much at\r\nease with a "man of the people." _She_ found it impossible to speak to\r\nhim otherwise than stiffly. She felt as if a great gulf lay between her\r\ncaste and his, and that to cross it or meet him half-way would be to\r\ndegrade herself. She gently asked Caroline, "Are you not afraid, my\r\ndear, to converse with that person so unreservedly? He may presume, and\r\nbecome troublesomely garrulous."\r\n\r\n"William presume, mamma? You don\'t know him. He never presumes. He is\r\naltogether too proud and sensitive to do so. William has very fine\r\nfeelings."\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Pryor smiled sceptically at the na\xc3\xafve notion of that\r\nrough-handed, rough-headed, fustian-clad clown having "fine feelings."\r\n\r\nFarren, for his part, showed Mrs. Pryor only a very sulky brow. He knew\r\nwhen he was misjudged, and was apt to turn unmanageable with such as\r\nfailed to give him his due.\r\n\r\nThe evening restored Caroline entirely to her mother, and Mrs. Pryor\r\nliked the evening; for then, alone with her daughter, no human shadow\r\ncame between her and what she loved. During the day she would have her\r\nstiff demeanour and cool moments, as was her wont. Between her and Mr.\r\nHelstone a very respectful but most rigidly ceremonious intercourse was\r\nkept up. Anything like familiarity would have bred contempt at once in\r\none or both these personages; but by dint of strict civility and\r\nwell-maintained distance they got on very smoothly.\r\n\r\nTowards the servants Mrs. Pryor\'s bearing was not uncourteous, but shy,\r\nfreezing, ungenial. Perhaps it was diffidence rather than pride which\r\nmade her appear so haughty; but, as was to be expected, Fanny and Eliza\r\nfailed to make the distinction, and she was unpopular with them\r\naccordingly. She felt the effect produced; it rendered her at times\r\ndissatisfied with herself for faults she could not help, and with all\r\nelse dejected, chill, and taciturn.\r\n\r\nThis mood changed to Caroline\'s influence, and to that influence alone.\r\nThe dependent fondness of her nursling, the natural affection of her\r\nchild, came over her suavely. Her frost fell away, her rigidity unbent;\r\nshe grew smiling and pliant. Not that Caroline made any wordy profession\r\nof love--that would ill have suited Mrs. Pryor; she would have read\r\ntherein the proof of insincerity--but she hung on her with easy\r\ndependence; she confided in her with fearless reliance. These things\r\ncontented the mother\'s heart.\r\n\r\nShe liked to hear her daughter say, "Mamma, do this;" "Please, mamma,\r\nfetch me that;" "Mamma, read to me;" "Sing a little, mamma."\r\n\r\nNobody else--not one living thing--had ever so claimed her services, so\r\nlooked for help at her hand. Other people were always more or less\r\nreserved and stiff with her, as she was reserved and stiff with them;\r\nother people betrayed consciousness of and annoyance at her weak points.\r\nCaroline no more showed such wounding sagacity or reproachful\r\nsensitiveness now than she had done when a suckling of three months old.\r\n\r\nYet Caroline could find fault. Blind to the constitutional defects that\r\nwere incurable, she had her eyes wide open to the acquired habits that\r\nwere susceptible of remedy. On certain points she would quite artlessly\r\nlecture her parent; and that parent, instead of being hurt, felt a\r\nsensation of pleasure in discovering that the girl _dared_ lecture her,\r\nthat she was so much at home with her.\r\n\r\n"Mamma, I am determined you shall not wear that old gown any more. Its\r\nfashion is not becoming; it is too strait in the skirt. You shall put on\r\nyour black silk every afternoon. In that you look nice; it suits you.\r\nAnd you shall have a black satin dress for Sundays--a real satin, not a\r\nsatinet or any of the shams. And, mamma, when you get the new one, mind\r\nyou must wear it."\r\n\r\n"My dear, I thought of the black silk serving me as a best dress for\r\nmany years yet, and I wished to buy you several things."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, mamma. My uncle gives me cash to get what I want. You know he\r\nis generous enough; and I have set my heart on seeing you in a black\r\nsatin. Get it soon, and let it be made by a dressmaker of my\r\nrecommending. Let me choose the pattern. You always want to disguise\r\nyourself like a grandmother. You would persuade one that you are old and\r\nugly. Not at all! On the contrary, when well dressed and cheerful you\r\nare very comely indeed; your smile is so pleasant, your teeth are so\r\nwhite, your hair is still such a pretty light colour. And then you speak\r\nlike a young lady, with such a clear, fine tone, and you sing better\r\nthan any young lady I ever heard. Why do you wear such dresses and\r\nbonnets, mamma, such as nobody else ever wears?"\r\n\r\n"Does it annoy you, Caroline?"\r\n\r\n"Very much; it vexes me even. People say you are miserly; and yet you\r\nare not, for you give liberally to the poor and to religious\r\nsocieties--though your gifts are conveyed so secretly and quietly that\r\nthey are known to few except the receivers. But I will be your\r\nlady\'s-maid myself. When I get a little stronger I will set to work, and\r\nyou must be good, mamma, and do as I bid you."\r\n\r\nAnd Caroline, sitting near her mother, rearranged her muslin\r\nhandkerchief and resmoothed her hair.\r\n\r\n"My own mamma," then she went on, as if pleasing herself with the\r\nthought of their relationship, "who belongs to me, and to whom I belong!\r\nI am a rich girl now. I have something I can love well, and not be\r\nafraid of loving. Mamma, who gave you this little brooch? Let me unpin\r\nit and look at it."\r\n\r\nMrs. Pryor, who usually shrank from meddling fingers and near approach,\r\nallowed the license complacently.\r\n\r\n"Did papa give you this, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"My sister gave it me--my only sister, Cary. Would that your Aunt\r\nCaroline had lived to see her niece!"\r\n\r\n"Have you nothing of papa\'s--no trinket, no gift of his?"\r\n\r\n"I have one thing."\r\n\r\n"That you prize?"\r\n\r\n"That I prize."\r\n\r\n"Valuable and pretty?"\r\n\r\n"Invaluable and sweet to me."\r\n\r\n"Show it, mamma. Is it here or at Fieldhead?"\r\n\r\n"It is talking to me now, leaning on me. Its arms are round me."\r\n\r\n"Ah, mamma, you mean your teasing daughter, who will never let you\r\nalone; who, when you go into your room, cannot help running to seek for\r\nyou; who follows you upstairs and down, like a dog."\r\n\r\n"Whose features still give me such a strange thrill sometimes. I half\r\nfear your fair looks yet, child."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t; you can\'t. Mamma, I am sorry papa was not good. I do so wish\r\nhe had been. Wickedness spoils and poisons all pleasant things. It kills\r\nlove. If you and I thought each other wicked, we could not love each\r\nother, could we?"\r\n\r\n"And if we could not trust each other, Cary?"\r\n\r\n"How miserable we should be! Mother, before I knew you I had an\r\napprehension that you were not good--that I could not esteem you. That\r\ndread damped my wish to see you. And now my heart is elate because I\r\nfind you perfect--almost; kind, clever, nice. Your sole fault is that\r\nyou are old-fashioned, and of that I shall cure you. Mamma, put your\r\nwork down; read to me. I like your southern accent; it is so pure, so\r\nsoft. It has no rugged burr, no nasal twang, such as almost every one\'s\r\nvoice here in the north has. My uncle and Mr. Hall say that you are a\r\nfine reader, mamma. Mr. Hall said he never heard any lady read with such\r\npropriety of expression or purity of accent."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could reciprocate the compliment, Cary; but, really, the first\r\ntime I heard your truly excellent friend read and preach I could not\r\nunderstand his broad northern tongue."\r\n\r\n"Could you understand me, mamma? Did I seem to speak roughly?"\r\n\r\n"No. I almost wished you had, as I wished you had looked unpolished.\r\nYour father, Caroline, naturally spoke well, quite otherwise than your\r\nworthy uncle--correctly, gently, smoothly. You inherit the gift."\r\n\r\n"Poor papa! When he was so agreeable, why was he not good?"\r\n\r\n"Why he was _as_ he was--and happily of that you, child, can form no\r\nconception--I cannot tell. It is a deep mystery. The key is in the hands\r\nof his Maker. There I leave it."\r\n\r\n"Mamma, you will keep stitching, stitching away. Put down the sewing; I\r\nam an enemy to it. It cumbers your lap, and I want it for my head; it\r\nengages your eyes, and I want them for a book. Here is your\r\nfavourite--Cowper."\r\n\r\nThese importunities were the mother\'s pleasure. If ever she delayed\r\ncompliance, it was only to hear them repeated, and to enjoy her child\'s\r\nsoft, half-playful, half-petulant urgency. And then, when she yielded,\r\nCaroline would say archly, "You will spoil me, mamma. I always thought I\r\nshould like to be spoiled, and I find it very sweet." So did Mrs.\r\nPryor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nOLD COPY-BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time the Fieldhead party returned to Briarfield Caroline was\r\nnearly well. Miss Keeldar, who had received news by post of her friend\'s\r\nconvalescence, hardly suffered an hour to elapse between her arrival at\r\nhome and her first call at the rectory.\r\n\r\nA shower of rain was falling gently, yet fast, on the late flowers and\r\nrusset autumn shrubs, when the garden wicket was heard to swing open,\r\nand Shirley\'s well-known form passed the window. On her entrance her\r\nfeelings were evinced in her own peculiar fashion. When deeply moved by\r\nserious fears or joys she was not garrulous. The strong emotion was\r\nrarely suffered to influence her tongue, and even her eye refused it\r\nmore than a furtive and fitful conquest. She took Caroline in her arms,\r\ngave her one look, one kiss, then said, "You are better."\r\n\r\nAnd a minute after, "I see you are safe now; but take care. God grant\r\nyour health may be called on to sustain no more shocks!"\r\n\r\nShe proceeded to talk fluently about the journey. In the midst of\r\nvivacious discourse her eye still wandered to Caroline. There spoke in\r\nits light a deep solicitude, some trouble, and some amaze.\r\n\r\n"She may be better," it said, "but how weak she still is! What peril she\r\nhas come through!"\r\n\r\nSuddenly her glance reverted to Mrs. Pryor. It pierced her through.\r\n\r\n"When will my governess return to me?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"May I tell her all?" demanded Caroline of her mother. Leave being\r\nsignified by a gesture, Shirley was presently enlightened on what had\r\nhappened in her absence.\r\n\r\n"Very good," was the cool comment--"very good! But it is no news to me."\r\n\r\n"What! did you know?"\r\n\r\n"I guessed long since the whole business. I have heard somewhat of Mrs.\r\nPryor\'s history--not from herself, but from others. With every detail of\r\nMr. James Helstone\'s career and character I was acquainted. An\r\nafternoon\'s sitting and conversation with Miss Mann had rendered me\r\nfamiliar therewith; also he is one of Mrs. Yorke\'s warning examples--one\r\nof the blood-red lights she hangs out to scare young ladies from\r\nmatrimony. I believe I should have been sceptical about the truth of the\r\nportrait traced by such fingers--both these ladies take a dark pleasure\r\nin offering to view the dark side of life--but I questioned Mr. Yorke on\r\nthe subject, and he said, \'Shirley, my woman, if you want to know aught\r\nabout yond\' James Helstone, I can only say he was a man-tiger. He was\r\nhandsome, dissolute, soft, treacherous, courteous, cruel----\' Don\'t cry,\r\nCary; we\'ll say no more about it."\r\n\r\n"I am not crying, Shirley; or if I am, it is nothing. Go on; you are no\r\nfriend if you withhold from me the truth. I hate that false plan of\r\ndisguising, mutilating the truth."\r\n\r\n"Fortunately I have said pretty nearly all that I have to say, except\r\nthat your uncle himself confirmed Mr. Yorke\'s words; for he too scorns a\r\nlie, and deals in none of those conventional subterfuges that are\r\nshabbier than lies."\r\n\r\n"But papa is dead; they should let him alone now."\r\n\r\n"They should; and we _will_ let him alone. Cry away, Cary; it will do\r\nyou good. It is wrong to check natural tears. Besides, I choose to\r\nplease myself by sharing an idea that at this moment beams in your\r\nmother\'s eye while she looks at you. Every drop blots out a sin. Weep!\r\nyour tears have the virtue which the rivers of Damascus lacked. Like\r\nJordan, they can cleanse a leprous memory."\r\n\r\n"Madam," she continued, addressing Mrs. Pryor, "did you think I could be\r\ndaily in the habit of seeing you and your daughter together--marking\r\nyour marvellous similarity in many points, observing (pardon me) your\r\nirrepressible emotions in the presence and still more in the absence of\r\nyour child--and not form my own conjectures? I formed them, and they are\r\nliterally correct. I shall begin to think myself shrewd."\r\n\r\n"And you said nothing?" observed Caroline, who soon regained the quiet\r\ncontrol of her feelings.\r\n\r\n"Nothing. I had no warrant to breathe a word on the subject. _My_\r\nbusiness it was not; I abstained from making it such."\r\n\r\n"You guessed so deep a secret, and did not hint that you guessed it?"\r\n\r\n"Is that so difficult?"\r\n\r\n"It is not like you."\r\n\r\n"How do you know?"\r\n\r\n"You are not reserved; you are frankly communicative."\r\n\r\n"I may be communicative, yet know where to stop. In showing my treasure\r\nI may withhold a gem or two--a curious, unbought graven stone--an amulet\r\nof whose mystic glitter I rarely permit even myself a glimpse.\r\nGood-day."\r\n\r\nCaroline thus seemed to get a view of Shirley\'s character under a novel\r\naspect. Ere long the prospect was renewed; it opened upon her.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had she regained sufficient strength to bear a change of\r\nscene--the excitement of a little society--than Miss Keeldar sued daily\r\nfor her presence at Fieldhead. Whether Shirley had become wearied of her\r\nhonoured relatives is not known. She did not say she was; but she\r\nclaimed and retained Caroline with an eagerness which proved that an\r\naddition to that worshipful company was not unwelcome.\r\n\r\nThe Sympsons were church people. Of course the rector\'s niece was\r\nreceived by them with courtesy. Mr. Sympson proved to be a man of\r\nspotless respectability, worrying temper, pious principles, and worldly\r\nviews; his lady was a very good woman--patient, kind, well-bred. She had\r\nbeen brought up on a narrow system of views, starved on a few\r\nprejudices--a mere handful of bitter herbs; a few preferences, soaked\r\ntill their natural flavour was extracted, and with no seasoning added in\r\nthe cooking; some excellent principles, made up in a stiff raised crust\r\nof bigotry difficult to digest. Far too submissive was she to complain\r\nof this diet or to ask for a crumb beyond it.\r\n\r\nThe daughters were an example to their sex. They were tall, with a Roman\r\nnose apiece. They had been educated faultlessly. All they did was well\r\ndone. History and the most solid books had cultivated their minds.\r\nPrinciples and opinions they possessed which could not be mended. More\r\nexactly-regulated lives, feelings, manners, habits, it would have been\r\ndifficult to find anywhere. They knew by heart a certain\r\nyoung-ladies\'-schoolroom code of laws on language, demeanour, etc.;\r\nthemselves never deviated from its curious little pragmatical\r\nprovisions, and they regarded with secret whispered horror all\r\ndeviations in others. The Abomination of Desolation was no mystery to\r\nthem; they had discovered that unutterable Thing in the characteristic\r\nothers call Originality. Quick were they to recognize the signs of this\r\nevil; and wherever they saw its trace--whether in look, word, or deed;\r\nwhether they read it in the fresh, vigorous style of a book, or listened\r\nto it in interesting, unhackneyed, pure, expressive language--they\r\nshuddered, they recoiled. Danger was above their heads, peril about\r\ntheir steps. What was this strange thing? Being unintelligible it must\r\nbe bad. Let it be denounced and chained up.\r\n\r\nHenry Sympson, the only son and youngest child of the family, was a boy\r\nof fifteen. He generally kept with his tutor. When he left him, he\r\nsought his cousin Shirley. This boy differed from his sisters. He was\r\nlittle, lame, and pale; his large eyes shone somewhat languidly in a wan\r\norbit. They were, indeed, usually rather dim, but they were capable of\r\nillumination. At times they could not only shine, but blaze. Inward\r\nemotion could likewise give colour to his cheek and decision to his\r\ncrippled movements. Henry\'s mother loved him; she thought his\r\npeculiarities were a mark of election. He was not like other children,\r\nshe allowed. She believed him regenerate--a new Samuel--called of God\r\nfrom his birth. He was to be a clergyman. Mr. and the Misses Sympson,\r\nnot understanding the youth, let him much alone. Shirley made him her\r\npet, and he made Shirley his playmate.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this family circle, or rather outside it, moved the\r\ntutor--the satellite.\r\n\r\nYes, Louis Moore was a satellite of the house of Sympson--connected, yet\r\napart; ever attendant, ever distant. Each member of that correct family\r\ntreated him with proper dignity. The father was austerely civil,\r\nsometimes irritable; the mother, being a kind woman, was attentive, but\r\nformal; the daughters saw in him an abstraction, not a man. It seemed,\r\nby their manner, that their brother\'s tutor did not live for them. They\r\nwere learned; so was he--but not for them. They were accomplished; he\r\nhad talents too, imperceptible to their senses. The most spirited sketch\r\nfrom his fingers was a blank to their eyes; the most original\r\nobservation from his lips fell unheard on their ears. Nothing could\r\nexceed the propriety of their behaviour.\r\n\r\nI should have said nothing could have equalled it; but I remember a fact\r\nwhich strangely astonished Caroline Helstone. It was--to discover that\r\nher cousin had absolutely _no_ sympathizing friend at Fieldhead; that to\r\nMiss Keeldar he was as much a mere teacher, as little a gentleman, as\r\nlittle a man, as to the estimable Misses Sympson.\r\n\r\nWhat had befallen the kind-hearted Shirley that she should be so\r\nindifferent to the dreary position of a fellow-creature thus isolated\r\nunder her roof? She was not, perhaps, haughty to him, but she never\r\nnoticed him--she let him alone. He came and went, spoke or was silent,\r\nand she rarely recognized his existence.\r\n\r\nAs to Louis Moore himself, he had the air of a man used to this life,\r\nand who had made up his mind to bear it for a time. His faculties seemed\r\nwalled up in him, and were unmurmuring in their captivity. He never\r\nlaughed; he seldom smiled; he was uncomplaining. He fulfilled the round\r\nof his duties scrupulously. His pupil loved him; he asked nothing more\r\nthan civility from the rest of the world. It even appeared that he would\r\naccept nothing more--in that abode at least; for when his cousin\r\nCaroline made gentle overtures of friendship, he did not encourage\r\nthem--he rather avoided than sought her. One living thing alone, besides\r\nhis pale, crippled scholar, he fondled in the house, and that was the\r\nruffianly Tartar, who, sullen and impracticable to others, acquired a\r\nsingular partiality for him--a partiality so marked that sometimes, when\r\nMoore, summoned to a meal, entered the room and sat down unwelcomed,\r\nTartar would rise from his lair at Shirley\'s feet and betake himself to\r\nthe taciturn tutor. Once--but once--she noticed the desertion, and\r\nholding out her white hand, and speaking softly, tried to coax him back.\r\nTartar looked, slavered, and sighed, as his manner was, but yet\r\ndisregarded the invitation, and coolly settled himself on his haunches\r\nat Louis Moore\'s side. That gentleman drew the dog\'s big, black-muzzled\r\nhead on to his knee, patted him, and smiled one little smile to himself.\r\n\r\nAn acute observer might have remarked, in the course of the same\r\nevening, that after Tartar had resumed his allegiance to Shirley, and\r\nwas once more couched near her footstool, the audacious tutor by one\r\nword and gesture fascinated him again. He pricked up his ears at the\r\nword; he started erect at the gesture, and came, with head lovingly\r\ndepressed, to receive the expected caress. As it was given, the\r\nsignificant smile again rippled across Moore\'s quiet face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Shirley," said Caroline one day, as they two were sitting alone in the\r\nsummer-house, "did you know that my cousin Louis was tutor in your\r\nuncle\'s family before the Sympsons came down here?"\r\n\r\nShirley\'s reply was not so prompt as her responses usually were, but at\r\nlast she answered, "Yes--of course; I knew it well."\r\n\r\n"I thought you must have been aware of the circumstance."\r\n\r\n"Well! what then?"\r\n\r\n"It puzzles me to guess how it chanced that you never mentioned it to\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Why should it puzzle you?"\r\n\r\n"It seems odd. I cannot account for it. You talk a great deal--you talk\r\nfreely. How was that circumstance never touched on?"\r\n\r\n"Because it never was," and Shirley laughed.\r\n\r\n"You are a singular being!" observed her friend. "I thought I knew you\r\nquite well; I begin to find myself mistaken. You were silent as the\r\ngrave about Mrs. Pryor, and now again here is another secret. But why\r\nyou made it a secret is the mystery to me."\r\n\r\n"I never made it a secret; I had no reason for so doing. If you had\r\nasked me who Henry\'s tutor was, I would have told you. Besides, I\r\nthought you knew."\r\n\r\n"I am puzzled about more things than one in this matter. You don\'t like\r\npoor Louis. Why? Are you impatient at what you perhaps consider his\r\n_servile_ position? Do you wish that Robert\'s brother were more highly\r\nplaced?"\r\n\r\n"Robert\'s brother, indeed!" was the exclamation, uttered in a tone like\r\nthe accents of scorn; and with a movement of proud impatience Shirley\r\nsnatched a rose from a branch peeping through the open lattice.\r\n\r\n"Yes," repeated Caroline, with mild firmness, "Robert\'s brother. He _is_\r\nthus closely related to G\xc3\xa9rard Moore of the Hollow, though nature has\r\nnot given him features so handsome or an air so noble as his kinsman;\r\nbut his blood is as good, and he is as much a gentleman were he free."\r\n\r\n"Wise, humble, pious Caroline!" exclaimed Shirley ironically. "Men and\r\nangels, hear her! We should not despise plain features, nor a laborious\r\nyet honest occupation, should we? Look at the subject of your panegyric.\r\nHe is there in the garden," she continued, pointing through an aperture\r\nin the clustering creepers; and by that aperture Louis Moore was\r\nvisible, coming slowly down the walk.\r\n\r\n"He is not ugly, Shirley," pleaded Caroline; "he is not ignoble. He is\r\nsad; silence seals his mind. But I believe him to be intelligent; and be\r\ncertain, if he had not something very commendable in his disposition,\r\nMr. Hall would never seek his society as he does."\r\n\r\nShirley laughed; she laughed again, each time with a slightly sarcastic\r\nsound. "Well, well," was her comment. "On the plea of the man being\r\nCyril Hall\'s friend and Robert Moore\'s brother, we\'ll just tolerate his\r\nexistence; won\'t we, Cary? You believe him to be intelligent, do you?\r\nNot quite an idiot--eh? Something commendable in his disposition!--_id\r\nest_, not an absolute ruffian. Good! Your representations have weight\r\nwith me; and to prove that they have, should he come this way I will\r\nspeak to him."\r\n\r\nHe approached the summer-house. Unconscious that it was tenanted, he sat\r\ndown on the step. Tartar, now his customary companion, had followed him,\r\nand he couched across his feet.\r\n\r\n"Old boy!" said Louis, pulling his tawny ear, or rather the mutilated\r\nremains of that organ, torn and chewed in a hundred battles, "the autumn\r\nsun shines as pleasantly on us as on the fairest and richest. This\r\ngarden is none of ours, but we enjoy its greenness and perfume, don\'t\r\nwe?"\r\n\r\nHe sat silent, still caressing Tartar, who slobbered with exceeding\r\naffection. A faint twittering commenced among the trees round. Something\r\nfluttered down as light as leaves. They were little birds, which,\r\nlighting on the sward at shy distance, hopped as if expectant.\r\n\r\n"The small brown elves actually remember that I fed them the other day,"\r\nagain soliloquized Louis. "They want some more biscuit. To-day I forgot\r\nto save a fragment. Eager little sprites, I have not a crumb for you."\r\n\r\nHe put his hand in his pocket and drew it out empty.\r\n\r\n"A want easily supplied," whispered the listening Miss Keeldar.\r\n\r\nShe took from her reticule a morsel of sweet-cake; for that repository\r\nwas never destitute of something available to throw to the chickens,\r\nyoung ducks, or sparrows. She crumbled it, and bending over his\r\nshoulder, put the crumbs into his hand.\r\n\r\n"There," said she--"there is a providence for the improvident."\r\n\r\n"This September afternoon is pleasant," observed Louis Moore, as, not at\r\nall discomposed, he calmly cast the crumbs on to the grass.\r\n\r\n"Even for you?"\r\n\r\n"As pleasant for me as for any monarch."\r\n\r\n"You take a sort of harsh, solitary triumph in drawing pleasure out of\r\nthe elements and the inanimate and lower animate creation."\r\n\r\n"Solitary, but not harsh. With animals I feel I am Adam\'s son, the heir\r\nof him to whom dominion was given over \'every living thing that moveth\r\nupon the earth.\' Your dog likes and follows me. When I go into that\r\nyard, the pigeons from your dovecot flutter at my feet. Your mare in the\r\nstable knows me as well as it knows you, and obeys me better."\r\n\r\n"And my roses smell sweet to you, and my trees give you shade."\r\n\r\n"And," continued Louis, "no caprice can withdraw these pleasures from\r\nme; they are _mine_."\r\n\r\nHe walked off. Tartar followed him, as if in duty and affection bound,\r\nand Shirley remained standing on the summer-house step. Caroline saw her\r\nface as she looked after the rude tutor. It was pale, as if her pride\r\nbled inwardly.\r\n\r\n"You see," remarked Caroline apologetically, "his feelings are so often\r\nhurt it makes him morose."\r\n\r\n"You see," retorted Shirley, with ire, "he is a topic on which you and I\r\nshall quarrel if we discuss it often; so drop it henceforward and for\r\never."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he has more than once behaved in this way," thought Caroline\r\nto herself, "and that renders Shirley so distant to him. Yet I wonder\r\nshe cannot make allowance for character and circumstances. I wonder the\r\ngeneral modesty, manliness, sincerity of his nature do not plead with\r\nher in his behalf. She is not often so inconsiderate, so irritable."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe verbal testimony of two friends of Caroline\'s to her cousin\'s\r\ncharacter augmented her favourable opinion of him. William Farren, whose\r\ncottage he had visited in company with Mr. Hall, pronounced him a "real\r\ngentleman;" there was not such another in Briarfield.\r\nHe--William--"could do aught for that man. And then to see how t\' bairns\r\nliked him, and how t\' wife took to him first minute she saw him. He\r\nnever went into a house but t\' childer wor about him directly. Them\r\nlittle things wor like as if they\'d a keener sense nor grown-up folks i\'\r\nfinding our folk\'s natures."\r\n\r\nMr. Hall, in answer to a question of Miss Helstone\'s as to what he\r\nthought of Louis Moore, replied promptly that he was the best fellow he\r\nhad met with since he left Cambridge.\r\n\r\n"But he is so grave," objected Caroline.\r\n\r\n"Grave! the finest company in the world! Full of odd, quiet,\r\nout-of-the-way humour. Never enjoyed an excursion so much in my life as\r\nthe one I took with him to the Lakes. His understanding and tastes are\r\nso superior, it does a man good to be within their influence; and as to\r\nhis temper and nature, I call them fine."\r\n\r\n"At Fieldhead he looks gloomy, and, I believe, has the character of\r\nbeing misanthropical."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I fancy he is rather out of place there--in a false position. The\r\nSympsons are most estimable people, but not the folks to comprehend him.\r\nThey think a great deal about form and ceremony, which are quite out of\r\nLouis\'s way."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Miss Keeldar likes him."\r\n\r\n"She doesn\'t know him--she doesn\'t know him; otherwise she has sense\r\nenough to do justice to his merits."\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose she doesn\'t know him," mused Caroline to herself, and\r\nby this hypothesis she endeavoured to account for what seemed else\r\nunaccountable. But such simple solution of the difficulty was not left\r\nher long. She was obliged to refuse Miss Keeldar even this negative\r\nexcuse for her prejudice.\r\n\r\nOne day she chanced to be in the schoolroom with Henry Sympson, whose\r\namiable and affectionate disposition had quickly recommended him to her\r\nregard. The boy was busied about some mechanical contrivance; his\r\nlameness made him fond of sedentary occupation. He began to ransack his\r\ntutor\'s desk for a piece of wax or twine necessary to his work. Moore\r\nhappened to be absent. Mr. Hall, indeed, had called for him to take a\r\nlong walk. Henry could not immediately find the object of his search. He\r\nrummaged compartment after compartment; and at last, opening an inner\r\ndrawer, he came upon--not a ball of cord or a lump of beeswax, but a\r\nlittle bundle of small marble-coloured cahiers, tied with tape. Henry\r\nlooked at them. "What rubbish Mr. Moore stores up in his desk!" he\r\nsaid. "I hope he won\'t keep my old exercises so carefully."\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Old copy-books."\r\n\r\nHe threw the bundle to Caroline. The packet looked so neat externally\r\nher curiosity was excited to see its contents.\r\n\r\n"If they are only copy-books, I suppose I may open them?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, quite freely. Mr. Moore\'s desk is half mine--for he lets me\r\nkeep all sorts of things in it--and I give you leave."\r\n\r\nOn scrutiny they proved to be French compositions, written in a hand\r\npeculiar but compact, and exquisitely clean and clear. The writing was\r\nrecognizable. She scarcely needed the further evidence of the name\r\nsigned at the close of each theme to tell her whose they were. Yet that\r\nname astonished her--"Shirley Keeldar, Sympson Grove, ----shire" (a\r\nsouthern county), and a date four years back.\r\n\r\nShe tied up the packet, and held it in her hand, meditating over it. She\r\nhalf felt as if, in opening it, she had violated a confidence.\r\n\r\n"They are Shirley\'s, you see," said Henry carelessly.\r\n\r\n"Did _you_ give them to Mr. Moore? She wrote them with Mrs. Pryor, I\r\nsuppose?"\r\n\r\n"She wrote them in my schoolroom at Sympson Grove, when she lived with\r\nus there. Mr. Moore taught her French; it is his native language."\r\n\r\n"I know. Was she a good pupil, Henry?"\r\n\r\n"She was a wild, laughing thing, but pleasant to have in the room. She\r\nmade lesson-time charming. She learned fast--you could hardly tell when\r\nor how. French was nothing to her. She spoke it quick, quick--as quick\r\nas Mr. Moore himself."\r\n\r\n"Was she obedient? Did she give trouble?"\r\n\r\n"She gave plenty of trouble, in a way. She was giddy, but I liked her.\r\nI\'m desperately fond of Shirley."\r\n\r\n"_Desperately_ fond--you small simpleton! You don\'t know what you say."\r\n\r\n"I _am desperately_ fond of her. She is the light of my eyes. I said so\r\nto Mr. Moore last night."\r\n\r\n"He would reprove you for speaking with exaggeration."\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t. He never reproves and reproves, as girls\' governesses do. He\r\nwas reading, and he only smiled into his book, and said that if Miss\r\nKeeldar was no more than that, she was less than he took her to be; for\r\nI was but a dim-eyed, short-sighted little chap. I\'m afraid I am a poor\r\nunfortunate, Miss Caroline Helstone. I am a cripple, you know."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Henry, you are a very nice little fellow; and if God has\r\nnot given you health and strength, He has given you a good disposition\r\nand an excellent heart and brain."\r\n\r\n"I shall be despised. I sometimes think both Shirley and you despise\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Listen, Henry. Generally, I don\'t like schoolboys. I have a great\r\nhorror of them. They seem to me little ruffians, who take an unnatural\r\ndelight in killing and tormenting birds, and insects, and kittens, and\r\nwhatever is weaker than themselves. But you are so different I am quite\r\nfond of you. You have almost as much sense as a man (far more, God wot,"\r\nshe muttered to herself, "than many men); you are fond of reading, and\r\nyou can talk sensibly about what you read."\r\n\r\n"I _am_ fond of reading. I know I have sense, and I know I have\r\nfeeling."\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar here entered.\r\n\r\n"Henry," she said, "I have brought your lunch here. I shall prepare it\r\nfor you myself."\r\n\r\nShe placed on the table a glass of new milk, a plate of something which\r\nlooked not unlike leather, and a utensil which resembled a\r\ntoasting-fork.\r\n\r\n"What are you two about," she continued, "ransacking Mr. Moore\'s desk?"\r\n\r\n"Looking at your old copy-books," returned Caroline.\r\n\r\n"My old copy-books?"\r\n\r\n"French exercise-books. Look here! They must be held precious; they are\r\nkept carefully."\r\n\r\nShe showed the bundle. Shirley snatched it up. "Did not know one was in\r\nexistence," she said. "I thought the whole lot had long since lit the\r\nkitchen fire, or curled the maid\'s hair at Sympson Grove.--What made you\r\nkeep them, Henry?"\r\n\r\n"It is not my doing. I should not have thought of it. It never entered\r\nmy head to suppose copy-books of value. Mr. Moore put them by in the\r\ninner drawer of his desk. Perhaps he forgot them."\r\n\r\n"C\'est cela. He forgot them, no doubt," echoed Shirley. "They are\r\nextremely well written," she observed complacently.\r\n\r\n"What a giddy girl you were, Shirley, in those days! I remember you so\r\nwell. A slim, light creature whom, though you were so tall, I could lift\r\noff the floor. I see you with your long, countless curls on your\r\nshoulders, and your streaming sash. You used to make Mr. Moore\r\nlively--that is, at first. I believe you grieved him after a while."\r\n\r\nShirley turned the closely-written pages and said nothing. Presently she\r\nobserved, "That was written one winter afternoon. It was a description\r\nof a snow scene."\r\n\r\n"I remember," said Henry. "Mr. Moore, when he read it, cried, \'Voil\xc3\xa0 le\r\nFran\xc3\xa7ais gagn\xc3\xa9!\' He said it was well done. Afterwards you made him draw,\r\nin sepia, the landscape you described."\r\n\r\n"You have not forgotten, then, Hal?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all. We were all scolded that day for not coming down to tea\r\nwhen called. I can remember my tutor sitting at his easel, and you\r\nstanding behind him, holding the candle, and watching him draw the snowy\r\ncliff, the pine, the deer couched under it, and the half-moon hung\r\nabove."\r\n\r\n"Where are his drawings, Harry? Caroline should see them."\r\n\r\n"In his portfolio. But it is padlocked; he has the key."\r\n\r\n"Ask him for it when he comes in."\r\n\r\n"You should ask him, Shirley. You are shy of him now. You are grown a\r\nproud lady to him; I notice that."\r\n\r\n"Shirley, you are a real enigma," whispered Caroline in her ear. "What\r\nqueer discoveries I make day by day now!--I who thought I had your\r\nconfidence. Inexplicable creature! even this boy reproves you."\r\n\r\n"I have forgotten \'auld lang syne,\' you see, Harry," said Miss Keeldar,\r\nanswering young Sympson, and not heeding Caroline.\r\n\r\n"Which you never should have done. You don\'t deserve to be a man\'s\r\nmorning star if you have so short a memory."\r\n\r\n"A man\'s morning star, indeed! and by \'a man\' is meant your worshipful\r\nself, I suppose? Come, drink your new milk while it is warm."\r\n\r\nThe young cripple rose and limped towards the fire; he had left his\r\ncrutch near the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n"My poor lame darling!" murmured Shirley, in her softest voice, aiding\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Whether do you like me or Mr. Sam Wynne best, Shirley?" inquired the\r\nboy, as she settled him in an arm-chair.\r\n\r\n"O Harry, Sam Wynne is my aversion; you are my pet."\r\n\r\n"Me or Mr. Malone?"\r\n\r\n"You again, a thousand times."\r\n\r\n"Yet they are great whiskered fellows, six feet high each."\r\n\r\n"Whereas, as long as you live, Harry, you will never be anything more\r\nthan a little pale lameter."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know."\r\n\r\n"You need not be sorrowful. Have I not often told you who was almost as\r\nlittle, as pale, as suffering as you, and yet potent as a giant and\r\nbrave as a lion?"\r\n\r\n"Admiral Horatio?"\r\n\r\n"Admiral Horatio, Viscount Nelson, and Duke of Bronte; great at heart as\r\na Titan; gallant and heroic as all the world and age of chivalry; leader\r\nof the might of England; commander of her strength on the deep; hurler\r\nof her thunder over the flood."\r\n\r\n"A great man. But I am not warlike, Shirley; and yet my mind is so\r\nrestless I burn day and night--for what I can hardly tell--to be--to\r\ndo--to suffer, I think."\r\n\r\n"Harry, it is your mind, which is stronger and older than your frame,\r\nthat troubles you. It is a captive; it lies in physical bondage. But it\r\nwill work its own redemption yet. Study carefully not only books but the\r\nworld. You love nature; love her without fear. Be patient--wait the\r\ncourse of time. You will not be a soldier or a sailor, Henry; but if you\r\nlive you will be--listen to my prophecy--you will be an author, perhaps\r\na poet."\r\n\r\n"An author! It is a flash--a flash of light to me! I will--I _will_!\r\nI\'ll write a book that I may dedicate it to you."\r\n\r\n"You will write it that you may give your soul its natural release.\r\nBless me! what am I saying? more than I understand, I believe, or can\r\nmake good. Here, Hal--here is your toasted oatcake; eat and live!"\r\n\r\n"Willingly!" here cried a voice outside the open window. "I know that\r\nfragrance of meal bread. Miss Keeldar, may I come in and partake?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hall"--it was Mr. Hall, and with him was Louis Moore, returned from\r\ntheir walk--"there is a proper luncheon laid out in the dining-room and\r\nthere are proper people seated round it. You may join that society and\r\nshare that fare if you please; but if your ill-regulated tastes lead you\r\nto prefer ill-regulated proceedings, step in here, and do as we do."\r\n\r\n"I approve the perfume, and therefore shall suffer myself to be led by\r\nthe nose," returned Mr. Hall, who presently entered, accompanied by\r\nLouis Moore. That gentleman\'s eye fell on his desk, pillaged.\r\n\r\n"Burglars!" said he.--"Henry, you merit the ferule."\r\n\r\n"Give it to Shirley and Caroline; they did it," was alleged, with more\r\nattention to effect than truth.\r\n\r\n"Traitor and false witness!" cried both the girls. "We never laid hands\r\non a thing, except in the spirit of laudable inquiry!"\r\n\r\n"Exactly so," said Moore, with his rare smile. "And what have you\r\nferreted out, in your \'spirit of laudable inquiry\'?"\r\n\r\nHe perceived the inner drawer open.\r\n\r\n"This is empty," said he. "Who has taken----"\r\n\r\n"Here, here!" Caroline hastened to say, and she restored the little\r\npacket to its place. He shut it up; he locked it in with a small key\r\nattached to his watch-guard; he restored the other papers to order,\r\nclosed the repository, and sat down without further remark.\r\n\r\n"I thought you would have scolded much more, sir," said Henry. "The\r\ngirls deserve reprimand."\r\n\r\n"I leave them to their own consciences."\r\n\r\n"It accuses them of crimes intended as well as perpetrated, sir. If I\r\nhad not been here, they would have treated your portfolio as they have\r\ndone your desk; but I told them it was padlocked."\r\n\r\n"And will you have lunch with us?" here interposed Shirley, addressing\r\nMoore, and desirous, as it seemed, to turn the conversation.\r\n\r\n"Certainly, if I may."\r\n\r\n"You will be restricted to new milk and Yorkshire oatcake."\r\n\r\n"Va--pour le lait frais!" said Louis. "But for your oatcake!" and he\r\nmade a grimace.\r\n\r\n"He cannot eat it," said Henry. "He thinks it is like bran, raised with\r\nsour yeast."\r\n\r\n"Come, then; by special dispensation we will allow him a few cracknels,\r\nbut nothing less homely."\r\n\r\nThe hostess rang the bell and gave her frugal orders, which were\r\npresently executed. She herself measured out the milk, and distributed\r\nthe bread round the cosy circle now enclosing the bright little\r\nschoolroom fire. She then took the post of toaster-general; and kneeling\r\non the rug, fork in hand, fulfilled her office with dexterity. Mr. Hall,\r\nwho relished any homely innovation on ordinary usages, and to whom the\r\nhusky oatcake was from custom suave as manna, seemed in his best\r\nspirits. He talked and laughed gleefully--now with Caroline, whom he had\r\nfixed by his side, now with Shirley, and again with Louis Moore. And\r\nLouis met him in congenial spirit. He did not laugh much, but he uttered\r\nin the quietest tone the wittiest things. Gravely spoken sentences,\r\nmarked by unexpected turns and a quite fresh flavour and poignancy, fell\r\neasily from his lips. He proved himself to be--what Mr. Hall had said he\r\nwas--excellent company. Caroline marvelled at his humour, but still more\r\nat his entire self-possession. Nobody there present seemed to impose on\r\nhim a sensation of unpleasant restraint. Nobody seemed a bore--a\r\ncheck--a chill to him; and yet there was the cool and lofty Miss Keeldar\r\nkneeling before the fire, almost at his feet.\r\n\r\nBut Shirley was cool and lofty no longer, at least not at this moment.\r\nShe appeared unconscious of the humility of her present position; or if\r\nconscious, it was only to taste a charm in its lowliness. It did not\r\nrevolt her pride that the group to whom she voluntarily officiated as\r\nhandmaid should include her cousin\'s tutor. It did not scare her that\r\nwhile she handed the bread and milk to the rest, she had to offer it to\r\nhim also; and Moore took his portion from her hand as calmly as if he\r\nhad been her equal.\r\n\r\n"You are overheated now," he said, when she had retained the fork for\r\nsome time; "let me relieve you."\r\n\r\nAnd he took it from her with a sort of quiet authority, to which she\r\nsubmitted passively, neither resisting him nor thanking him.\r\n\r\n"I should like to see your pictures, Louis," said Caroline, when the\r\nsumptuous luncheon was discussed.--"Would not you, Mr. Hall?"\r\n\r\n"To please you, I should; but, for my own part, I have cut him as an\r\nartist. I had enough of him in that capacity in Cumberland and\r\nWestmoreland. Many a wetting we got amongst the mountains because he\r\nwould persist in sitting on a camp-stool, catching effects of\r\nrain-clouds, gathering mists, fitful sunbeams, and what not."\r\n\r\n"Here is the portfolio," said Henry, bringing it in one hand and leaning\r\non his crutch with the other.\r\n\r\nLouis took it, but he still sat as if he wanted another to speak. It\r\nseemed as if he would not open it unless the proud Shirley deigned to\r\nshow herself interested in the exhibition.\r\n\r\n"He makes us wait to whet our curiosity," she said.\r\n\r\n"You understand opening it," observed Louis, giving her the key. "You\r\nspoiled the lock for me once; try now."\r\n\r\nHe held it. She opened it, and, monopolizing the contents, had the first\r\nview of every sketch herself. She enjoyed the treat--if treat it\r\nwere--in silence, without a single comment. Moore stood behind her chair\r\nand looked over her shoulder, and when she had done and the others were\r\nstill gazing, he left his post and paced through the room.\r\n\r\nA carriage was heard in the lane--the gate-bell rang. Shirley started.\r\n\r\n"There are callers," she said, "and I shall be summoned to the room. A\r\npretty figure--as they say--I am to receive company. I and Henry have\r\nbeen in the garden gathering fruit half the morning. Oh for rest under\r\nmy own vine and my own fig-tree! Happy is the slave-wife of the Indian\r\nchief, in that she has no drawing-room duty to perform, but can sit at\r\nease weaving mats, and stringing beads, and peacefully flattening her\r\npickaninny\'s head in an unmolested corner of her wigwam. I\'ll emigrate\r\nto the western woods."\r\n\r\nLouis Moore laughed.\r\n\r\n"To marry a White Cloud or a Big Buffalo, and after wedlock to devote\r\nyourself to the tender task of digging your lord\'s maize-field while he\r\nsmokes his pipe or drinks fire-water."\r\n\r\nShirley seemed about to reply, but here the schoolroom door unclosed,\r\nadmitting Mr. Sympson. That personage stood aghast when he saw the group\r\naround the fire.\r\n\r\n"I thought you alone, Miss Keeldar," he said. "I find quite a party."\r\n\r\nAnd evidently from his shocked, scandalized air, had he not recognized\r\nin one of the party a clergyman, he would have delivered an extempore\r\nphilippic on the extraordinary habits of his niece: respect for the\r\ncloth arrested him.\r\n\r\n"I merely wished to announce," he proceeded coldly, "that the family\r\nfrom De Walden Hall, Mr., Mrs., the Misses, and Mr. Sam Wynne, are in\r\nthe drawing-room." And he bowed and withdrew.\r\n\r\n"The family from De Walden Hall! Couldn\'t be a worse set," murmured\r\nShirley.\r\n\r\nShe sat still, looking a little contumacious, and very much indisposed\r\nto stir. She was flushed with the fire. Her dark hair had been more than\r\nonce dishevelled by the morning wind that day. Her attire was a light,\r\nneatly fitting, but amply flowing dress of muslin; the shawl she had\r\nworn in the garden was still draped in a careless fold round her.\r\nIndolent, wilful, picturesque, and singularly pretty was her\r\naspect--prettier than usual, as if some soft inward emotion, stirred who\r\nknows how, had given new bloom and expression to her features.\r\n\r\n"Shirley, Shirley, you ought to go," whispered Caroline.\r\n\r\n"I wonder why?"\r\n\r\nShe lifted her eyes, and saw in the glass over the fireplace both Mr.\r\nHall and Louis Moore gazing at her gravely.\r\n\r\n"If," she said, with a yielding smile--"if a majority of the present\r\ncompany maintain that the De Walden Hall people have claims on my\r\ncivility, I will subdue my inclinations to my duty. Let those who think\r\nI ought to go hold up their hands."\r\n\r\nAgain consulting the mirror, it reflected an unanimous vote against her.\r\n\r\n"You must go," said Mr. Hall, "and behave courteously too. You owe many\r\nduties to society. It is not permitted you to please only yourself."\r\n\r\nLouis Moore assented with a low "Hear, hear!"\r\n\r\nCaroline, approaching her, smoothed her wavy curls, gave to her attire a\r\nless artistic and more domestic grace, and Shirley was put out of the\r\nroom, protesting still, by a pouting lip, against her dismissal.\r\n\r\n"There is a curious charm about her," observed Mr. Hall, when she was\r\ngone. "And now," he added, "I must away; for Sweeting is off to see his\r\nmother, and there are two funerals."\r\n\r\n"Henry, get your books; it is lesson-time," said Moore, sitting down to\r\nhis desk.\r\n\r\n"A curious charm!" repeated the pupil, when he and his master were left\r\nalone. "True. Is she not a kind of white witch?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Of whom are you speaking, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Of my cousin Shirley."\r\n\r\n"No irrelevant questions; study in silence."\r\n\r\nMr. Moore looked and spoke sternly--sourly. Henry knew this mood. It was\r\na rare one with his tutor; but when it came he had an awe of it. He\r\nobeyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST BLUESTOCKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar and her uncle had characters that would not harmonize, that\r\nnever had harmonized. He was irritable, and she was spirited. He was\r\ndespotic, and she liked freedom. He was worldly, and she, perhaps,\r\nromantic.\r\n\r\nNot without purpose had he come down to Yorkshire. His mission was\r\nclear, and he intended to discharge it conscientiously. He anxiously\r\ndesired to have his niece married, to make for her a suitable match,\r\ngive her in charge to a proper husband, and wash his hands of her for\r\never.\r\n\r\nThe misfortune was, from infancy upwards, Shirley and he had disagreed\r\non the meaning of the words "suitable" and "proper." She never yet had\r\naccepted his definition; and it was doubtful whether, in the most\r\nimportant step of her life, she would consent to accept it.\r\n\r\nThe trial soon came.\r\n\r\nMr. Wynne proposed in form for his son, Samuel Fawthrop Wynne.\r\n\r\n"Decidedly suitable! most proper!" pronounced Mr. Sympson. "A fine\r\nunencumbered estate, real substance, good connections. _It must be\r\ndone!_"\r\n\r\nHe sent for his niece to the oak parlour; he shut himself up there with\r\nher alone; he communicated the offer; he gave his opinion; he claimed\r\nher consent.\r\n\r\nIt was withheld.\r\n\r\n"No; I shall not marry Samuel Fawthrop Wynne."\r\n\r\n"I ask why. I must have a reason. In all respects he is more than worthy\r\nof you."\r\n\r\nShe stood on the hearth. She was pale as the white marble slab and\r\ncornice behind her; her eyes flashed large, dilated, unsmiling.\r\n\r\n"And _I_ ask in what sense that young man is worthy of _me_?"\r\n\r\n"He has twice your money, twice your common sense, equal connections,\r\nequal respectability."\r\n\r\n"Had he my money counted fivescore times I would take no vow to love\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Please to state your objections."\r\n\r\n"He has run a course of despicable, commonplace profligacy. Accept that\r\nas the first reason why I spurn him."\r\n\r\n"Miss Keeldar, you shock me!"\r\n\r\n"That conduct alone sinks him in a gulf of immeasurable inferiority. His\r\nintellect reaches no standard I can esteem: there is a second\r\nstumbling-block. His views are narrow, his feelings are blunt, his\r\ntastes are coarse, his manners vulgar."\r\n\r\n"The man is a respectable, wealthy man! To refuse him is presumption on\r\nyour part."\r\n\r\n"I refuse point-blank! Cease to annoy me with the subject; I forbid it!"\r\n\r\n"Is it your intention ever to marry; or do you prefer celibacy?"\r\n\r\n"I deny your right to claim an answer to that question."\r\n\r\n"May I ask if you expect some man of title--some peer of the realm--to\r\ndemand your hand?"\r\n\r\n"I doubt if the peer breathes on whom I would confer it."\r\n\r\n"Were there insanity in the family, I should believe you mad. Your\r\neccentricity and conceit touch the verge of frenzy."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, ere I have finished, you will see me over-leap it."\r\n\r\n"I anticipate no less. Frantic and impracticable girl! Take warning! I\r\ndare you to sully our name by a _m\xc3\xa9salliance_!"\r\n\r\n"_Our_ name! Am _I_ called Sympson?"\r\n\r\n"God be thanked that you are not! But be on your guard; I will not be\r\ntrifled with!"\r\n\r\n"What, in the name of common law and common sense, would you or could\r\nyou do if my pleasure led me to a choice you disapproved?"\r\n\r\n"Take care! take care!" warning her with voice and hand that trembled\r\nalike.\r\n\r\n"Why? What shadow of power have _you_ over me? Why should I fear you?"\r\n\r\n"Take care, madam!"\r\n\r\n"Scrupulous care I will take, Mr. Sympson. Before I marry I am resolved\r\nto esteem--to admire--to _love_."\r\n\r\n"Preposterous stuff! indecorous, unwomanly!"\r\n\r\n"To love with my whole heart. I know I speak in an unknown tongue; but I\r\nfeel indifferent whether I am comprehended or not."\r\n\r\n"And if this love of yours should fall on a beggar?"\r\n\r\n"On a beggar it will never fall. Mendicancy is not estimable."\r\n\r\n"On a low clerk, a play-actor, a play-writer, or--or----"\r\n\r\n"Take courage, Mr. Sympson! Or what?"\r\n\r\n"Any literary scrub, or shabby, whining artist."\r\n\r\n"For the scrubby, shabby, whining I have no taste; for literature and\r\nthe arts I have. And there I wonder how your Fawthrop Wynne would suit\r\nme. He cannot write a note without orthographical errors; he reads only\r\na sporting paper; he was the booby of Stilbro\' grammar school!"\r\n\r\n"Unladylike language! Great God! to what will she come?" He lifted hands\r\nand eyes.\r\n\r\n"Never to the altar of Hymen with Sam Wynne."\r\n\r\n"To what will she come? Why are not the laws more stringent, that I\r\nmight compel her to hear reason?"\r\n\r\n"Console yourself, uncle. Were Britain a serfdom and you the Czar, you\r\ncould not _compel_ me to this step. _I_ will write to Mr. Wynne. Give\r\nyourself no further trouble on the subject."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFortune is proverbially called changeful, yet her caprice often takes\r\nthe form of repeating again and again a similar stroke of luck in the\r\nsame quarter. It appeared that Miss Keeldar--or her fortune--had by this\r\ntime made a sensation in the district, and produced an impression in\r\nquarters by her unthought of. No less than three offers followed Mr.\r\nWynne\'s, all more or less eligible. All were in succession pressed on\r\nher by her uncle, and all in succession she refused. Yet amongst them\r\nwas more than one gentleman of unexceptionable character as well as\r\nample wealth. Many besides her uncle asked what she meant, and whom she\r\nexpected to entrap, that she was so insolently fastidious.\r\n\r\nAt last the gossips thought they had found the key to her conduct, and\r\nher uncle was sure of it; and what is more, the discovery showed his\r\nniece to him in quite a new light, and he changed his whole deportment\r\nto her accordingly.\r\n\r\nFieldhead had of late been fast growing too hot to hold them both. The\r\nsuave aunt could not reconcile them; the daughters froze at the view of\r\ntheir quarrels. Gertrude and Isabella whispered by the hour together in\r\ntheir dressing-room, and became chilled with decorous dread if they\r\nchanced to be left alone with their audacious cousin. But, as I have\r\nsaid, a change supervened. Mr. Sympson was appeased and his family\r\ntranquillized.\r\n\r\nThe village of Nunnely has been alluded to--its old church, its forest,\r\nits monastic ruins. It had also its hall, called the priory--an older, a\r\nlarger, a more lordly abode than any Briarfield or Whinbury owned; and\r\nwhat is more, it had its man of title--its baronet, which neither\r\nBriarfield nor Whinbury could boast. This possession--its proudest and\r\nmost prized--had for years been nominal only. The present baronet, a\r\nyoung man hitherto resident in a distant province, was unknown on his\r\nYorkshire estate.\r\n\r\nDuring Miss Keeldar\'s stay at the fashionable watering-place of\r\nCliffbridge, she and her friends had met with and been introduced to Sir\r\nPhilip Nunnely. They encountered him again and again on the sands, the\r\ncliffs, in the various walks, sometimes at the public balls of the\r\nplace. He seemed solitary. His manner was very unpretending--too simple\r\nto be termed affable; rather timid than proud. He did not _condescend_\r\nto their society; he seemed _glad_ of it.\r\n\r\nWith any unaffected individual Shirley could easily and quickly cement\r\nan acquaintance. She walked and talked with Sir Philip; she, her aunt,\r\nand cousins sometimes took a sail in his yacht. She liked him because\r\nshe found him kind and modest, and was charmed to feel she had the power\r\nto amuse him.\r\n\r\nOne slight drawback there was--where is the friendship without it?--Sir\r\nPhilip had a literary turn. He wrote poetry--sonnets, stanzas, ballads.\r\nPerhaps Miss Keeldar thought him a little too fond of reading and\r\nreciting these compositions; perhaps she wished the rhyme had possessed\r\nmore accuracy, the measure more music, the tropes more freshness, the\r\ninspiration more fire. At any rate, she always winced when he recurred\r\nto the subject of his poems, and usually did her best to divert the\r\nconversation into another channel.\r\n\r\nHe would beguile her to take moonlight walks with him on the bridge, for\r\nthe sole purpose, as it seemed, of pouring into her ear the longest of\r\nhis ballads. He would lead her away to sequestered rustic seats, whence\r\nthe rush of the surf to the sands was heard soft and soothing; and when\r\nhe had her all to himself, and the sea lay before them, and the scented\r\nshade of gardens spread round, and the tall shelter of cliffs rose\r\nbehind them, he would pull out his last batch of sonnets, and read them\r\nin a voice tremulous with emotion. He did not seem to know that though\r\nthey might be rhyme they were not poetry. It appeared, by Shirley\'s\r\ndowncast eye and disturbed face, that she knew it, and felt heartily\r\nmortified by the single foible of this good and amiable gentleman.\r\n\r\nOften she tried, as gently as might be, to wean him from this fanatic\r\nworship of the Muses. It was his monomania; on all ordinary subjects he\r\nwas sensible enough, and fain was she to engage him in ordinary topics.\r\nHe questioned her sometimes about his place at Nunnely; she was but too\r\nhappy to answer his interrogatories at length. She never wearied of\r\ndescribing the antique priory, the wild silvan park, the hoary church\r\nand hamlet; nor did she fail to counsel him to come down and gather his\r\ntenantry about him in his ancestral halls.\r\n\r\nSomewhat to her surprise, Sir Philip followed her advice to the letter,\r\nand actually, towards the close of September, arrived at the priory.\r\n\r\nHe soon made a call at Fieldhead, and his first visit was not his last.\r\nHe said--when he had achieved the round of the neighbourhood--that under\r\nno roof had he found such pleasant shelter as beneath the massive oak\r\nbeams of the gray manor-house of Briarfield; a cramped, modest dwelling\r\nenough compared with his own, but he liked it.\r\n\r\nPresently it did not suffice to sit with Shirley in her panelled\r\nparlour, where others came and went, and where he could rarely find a\r\nquiet moment to show her the latest production of his fertile muse; he\r\nmust have her out amongst the pleasant pastures, and lead her by the\r\nstill waters. _T\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ ramblings she shunned, so he made parties\r\nfor her to his own grounds, his glorious forest; to remoter\r\nscenes--woods severed by the Wharfe, vales watered by the Aire.\r\n\r\nSuch assiduity covered Miss Keeldar with distinction. Her uncle\'s\r\nprophetic soul anticipated a splendid future. He already scented the\r\ntime afar off when, with nonchalant air, and left foot nursed on his\r\nright knee, he should be able to make dashingly-familiar allusion to his\r\n"nephew the baronet." Now his niece dawned upon him no longer "a mad\r\ngirl," but a "most sensible woman." He termed her, in confidential\r\ndialogues with Mrs. Sympson, "a truly superior person; peculiar, but\r\nvery clever." He treated her with exceeding deference; rose reverently\r\nto open and shut doors for her; reddened his face and gave himself\r\nheadaches with stooping to pick up gloves, handkerchiefs, and other\r\nloose property, whereof Shirley usually held but insecure tenure. He\r\nwould cut mysterious jokes about the superiority of woman\'s wit over\r\nman\'s wisdom; commence obscure apologies for the blundering mistake he\r\nhad committed respecting the generalship, the tactics, of "a personage\r\nnot a hundred miles from Fieldhead." In short, he seemed elate as any\r\n"midden-cock on pattens."\r\n\r\nHis niece viewed his man\xc5\x93uvres and received his innuendoes with phlegm;\r\napparently she did not above half comprehend to what aim they tended.\r\nWhen plainly charged with being the preferred of the baronet, she said\r\nshe believed he did like her, and for her part she liked him. She had\r\nnever thought a man of rank--the only son of a proud, fond mother, the\r\nonly brother of doting sisters--could have so much goodness, and, on the\r\nwhole, so much sense.\r\n\r\nTime proved, indeed, that Sir Philip liked her. Perhaps he had found in\r\nher that "curious charm" noticed by Mr. Hall. He sought her presence\r\nmore and more, and at last with a frequency that attested it had become\r\nto him an indispensable stimulus. About this time strange feelings\r\nhovered round Fieldhead; restless hopes and haggard anxieties haunted\r\nsome of its rooms. There was an unquiet wandering of some of the inmates\r\namong the still fields round the mansion; there was a sense of\r\nexpectancy that kept the nerves strained.\r\n\r\nOne thing seemed clear: Sir Philip was not a man to be despised. He was\r\namiable; if not highly intellectual, he was intelligent. Miss Keeldar\r\ncould not affirm of him, what she had so bitterly affirmed of Sam Wynne,\r\nthat his feelings were blunt, his tastes coarse, and his manners vulgar.\r\nThere was sensibility in his nature; there was a very real, if not a\r\nvery discriminating, love of the arts; there was the English gentleman\r\nin all his deportment. As to his lineage and wealth, both were, of\r\ncourse, far beyond her claims.\r\n\r\nHis appearance had at first elicited some laughing though not\r\nill-natured remarks from the merry Shirley. It was boyish. His features\r\nwere plain and slight, his hair sandy, his stature insignificant. But\r\nshe soon checked her sarcasm on this point; she would even fire up if\r\nany one else made uncomplimentary allusion thereto. He had "a pleasing\r\ncountenance," she affirmed; "and there was that in his heart which was\r\nbetter than three Roman noses, than the locks of Absalom or the\r\nproportions of Saul." A spare and rare shaft she still reserved for his\r\nunfortunate poetic propensity; but even here she would tolerate no irony\r\nsave her own.\r\n\r\nIn short, matters had reached a point which seemed fully to warrant an\r\nobservation made about this time by Mr. Yorke to the tutor, Louis.\r\n\r\n"Yond\' brother Robert of yours seems to me to be either a fool or a\r\nmadman. Two months ago I could have sworn he had the game all in his own\r\nhands; and there he runs the country, and quarters himself up in London\r\nfor weeks together, and by the time he comes back he\'ll find himself\r\ncheckmated. Louis, \'there is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken\r\nat the flood, leads on to fortune, but, once let slip, never returns\r\nagain.\' I\'d write to Robert, if I were you, and remind him of that."\r\n\r\n"Robert had views on Miss Keeldar?" inquired Louis, as if the idea was\r\nnew to him.\r\n\r\n"Views I suggested to him myself, and views he might have realized, for\r\nshe liked him."\r\n\r\n"As a neighbour?"\r\n\r\n"As more than that. I have seen her change countenance and colour at the\r\nmere mention of his name. Write to the lad, I say, and tell him to come\r\nhome. He is a finer gentleman than this bit of a baronet, after all."\r\n\r\n"Does it not strike you, Mr. Yorke, that for a mere penniless adventurer\r\nto aspire to a rich woman\'s hand is presumptuous--contemptible?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, if you are for high notions and double-refined sentiment, I\'ve\r\nnaught to say. I\'m a plain, practical man myself, and if Robert is\r\nwilling to give up that royal prize to a lad-rival--a puling slip of\r\naristocracy--I am quite agreeable. At _his_ age, in _his_ place, with\r\n_his_ inducements, I would have acted differently. Neither baronet, nor\r\nduke, nor prince should have snatched my sweetheart from me without a\r\nstruggle. But you tutors are such solemn chaps; it is almost like\r\nspeaking to a parson to consult with you."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFlattered and fawned upon as Shirley was just now, it appeared she was\r\nnot absolutely spoiled--that her better nature did not quite leave her.\r\nUniversal report had indeed ceased to couple her name with that of\r\nMoore, and this silence seemed sanctioned by her own apparent oblivion\r\nof the absentee; but that she had not _quite_ forgotten him--that she\r\nstill regarded him, if not with love, yet with interest--seemed proved\r\nby the increased attention which at this juncture of affairs a sudden\r\nattack of illness induced her to show that tutor-brother of Robert\'s, to\r\nwhom she habitually bore herself with strange alternations of cool\r\nreserve and docile respect--now sweeping past him in all the dignity of\r\nthe moneyed heiress and prospective Lady Nunnely, and anon accosting him\r\nas abashed school-girls are wont to accost their stern professors;\r\nbridling her neck of ivory and curling her lip of carmine, if he\r\nencountered her glance, one minute, and the next submitting to the grave\r\nrebuke of his eye with as much contrition as if he had the power to\r\ninflict penalties in case of contumacy.\r\n\r\nLouis Moore had perhaps caught the fever, which for a few days laid him\r\nlow, in one of the poor cottages of the district, which he, his lame\r\npupil, and Mr. Hall were in the habit of visiting together. At any rate\r\nhe sickened, and after opposing to the malady a taciturn resistance for\r\na day or two, was obliged to keep his chamber.\r\n\r\nHe lay tossing on his thorny bed one evening, Henry, who would not quit\r\nhim, watching faithfully beside him, when a tap--too light to be that of\r\nMrs. Gill or the housemaid--summoned young Sympson to the door.\r\n\r\n"How is Mr. Moore to-night?" asked a low voice from the dark gallery.\r\n\r\n"Come in and see him yourself."\r\n\r\n"Is he asleep?"\r\n\r\n"I wish he could sleep. Come and speak to him, Shirley."\r\n\r\n"He would not like it."\r\n\r\nBut the speaker stepped in, and Henry, seeing her hesitate on the\r\nthreshold, took her hand and drew her to the couch.\r\n\r\nThe shaded light showed Miss Keeldar\'s form but imperfectly; yet it\r\nrevealed her in elegant attire. There was a party assembled below,\r\nincluding Sir Philip Nunnely; the ladies were now in the drawing-room,\r\nand their hostess had stolen from them to visit Henry\'s tutor. Her pure\r\nwhite dress, her fair arms and neck, the trembling chainlet of gold\r\ncircling her throat and quivering on her breast, glistened strangely\r\namid the obscurity of the sickroom. Her mien was chastened and pensive.\r\nShe spoke gently.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Moore, how are you to-night?"\r\n\r\n"I have not been very ill, and am now better."\r\n\r\n"I heard that you complained of thirst. I have brought you some grapes;\r\ncan you taste one?"\r\n\r\n"No; but I thank you for remembering me."\r\n\r\n"Just one."\r\n\r\nFrom the rich cluster that filled a small basket held in her hand she\r\nsevered a berry and offered it to his lips. He shook his head, and\r\nturned aside his flushed face.\r\n\r\n"But what, then, can I bring you instead? You have no wish for fruit;\r\nyet I see that your lips are parched. What beverage do you prefer?"\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Gill supplies me with toast-and-water. I like it best."\r\n\r\nSilence fell for some minutes.\r\n\r\n"Do you suffer?--have you pain?"\r\n\r\n"Very little."\r\n\r\n"What made you ill?"\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what caused this fever? To what do you attribute it?"\r\n\r\n"Miasma, perhaps--malaria. This is autumn, a season fertile in fevers."\r\n\r\n"I hear you often visit the sick in Briarfield, and Nunnely too, with\r\nMr. Hall. You should be on your guard; temerity is not wise."\r\n\r\n"That reminds me, Miss Keeldar, that perhaps you had better not enter\r\nthis chamber or come near this couch. I do not believe my illness is\r\ninfectious. I scarcely fear"--with a sort of smile--"_you_ will take it;\r\nbut why should you run even the shadow of a risk? Leave me."\r\n\r\n"Patience, I will go soon; but I should like to do something for you\r\nbefore I depart--any little service----"\r\n\r\n"They will miss you below."\r\n\r\n"No; the gentlemen are still at table."\r\n\r\n"They will not linger long. Sir Philip Nunnely is no wine-bibber, and I\r\nhear him just now pass from the dining-room to the drawing-room."\r\n\r\n"It is a servant."\r\n\r\n"It is Sir Philip; I know his step."\r\n\r\n"Your hearing is acute."\r\n\r\n"It is never dull, and the sense seems sharpened at present. Sir Philip\r\nwas here to tea last night. I heard you sing to him some song which he\r\nhad brought you. I heard him, when he took his departure at eleven\r\no\'clock, call you out on to the pavement, to look at the evening star."\r\n\r\n"You must be nervously sensitive."\r\n\r\n"I heard him kiss your hand."\r\n\r\n"Impossible!"\r\n\r\n"No: my chamber is over the hall, the window just above the front door;\r\nthe sash was a little raised, for I felt feverish. You stood ten minutes\r\nwith him on the steps. I heard your discourse, every word, and I heard\r\nthe salute.--Henry, give me some water."\r\n\r\n"Let me give it him."\r\n\r\nBut he half rose to take the glass from young Sympson, and declined her\r\nattendance.\r\n\r\n"And can I do nothing?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing; for you cannot guarantee me a night\'s peaceful rest, and it is\r\nall I at present want."\r\n\r\n"You do not sleep well?"\r\n\r\n"Sleep has left me."\r\n\r\n"Yet you said you were not very ill?"\r\n\r\n"I am often sleepless when in high health."\r\n\r\n"If I had power, I would lap you in the most placid slumber--quite deep\r\nand hushed, without a dream."\r\n\r\n"Blank annihilation! I do not ask that."\r\n\r\n"With dreams of all you most desire."\r\n\r\n"Monstrous delusions! The sleep would be delirium, the waking death."\r\n\r\n"Your wishes are not so chimerical; you are no visionary."\r\n\r\n"Miss Keeldar, I suppose you think so; but my character is not, perhaps,\r\nquite as legible to you as a page of the last new novel might be."\r\n\r\n"That is possible. But this sleep--I _should_ like to woo it to your\r\npillow, to win for you its favour. If I took a book and sat down and\r\nread some pages? I can well spare half an hour."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, but I will not detain you."\r\n\r\n"I would read softly."\r\n\r\n"It would not do. I am too feverish and excitable to bear a soft,\r\ncooing, vibrating voice close at my ear. You had better leave me."\r\n\r\n"Well, I will go."\r\n\r\n"And no good-night?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, yes. Mr. Moore, good-night." (Exit Shirley.)\r\n\r\n"Henry, my boy, go to bed now; it is time you had some repose."\r\n\r\n"Sir, it would please me to watch at your bedside all night."\r\n\r\n"Nothing less called for. I am getting better. There, go."\r\n\r\n"Give me your blessing, sir."\r\n\r\n"God bless you, my best pupil!"\r\n\r\n"You never call me your dearest pupil!"\r\n\r\n"No, nor ever shall."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPossibly Miss Keeldar resented her former teacher\'s rejection of her\r\ncourtesy. It is certain she did not repeat the offer of it. Often as her\r\nlight step traversed the gallery in the course of a day, it did not\r\nagain pause at his door; nor did her "cooing, vibrating voice" disturb a\r\nsecond time the hush of the sickroom. A sickroom, indeed, it soon ceased\r\nto be; Mr. Moore\'s good constitution quickly triumphed over his\r\nindisposition. In a few days he shook it off, and resumed his duties as\r\ntutor.\r\n\r\nThat "auld lang syne" had still its authority both with preceptor and\r\nscholar was proved by the manner in which he sometimes promptly passed\r\nthe distance she usually maintained between them, and put down her high\r\nreserve with a firm, quiet hand.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon the Sympson family were gone out to take a carriage\r\nairing. Shirley, never sorry to snatch a reprieve from their society,\r\nhad remained behind, detained by business, as she said. The business--a\r\nlittle letter-writing--was soon dispatched after the yard gates had\r\nclosed on the carriage; Miss Keeldar betook herself to the garden.\r\n\r\nIt was a peaceful autumn day. The gilding of the Indian summer mellowed\r\nthe pastures far and wide. The russet woods stood ripe to be stripped,\r\nbut were yet full of leaf. The purple of heath-bloom, faded but not\r\nwithered, tinged the hills. The beck wandered down to the Hollow,\r\nthrough a silent district; no wind followed its course or haunted its\r\nwoody borders. Fieldhead gardens bore the seal of gentle decay. On the\r\nwalks, swept that morning, yellow leaves had fluttered down again. Its\r\ntime of flowers, and even of fruits, was over; but a scantling of\r\napples enriched the trees. Only a blossom here and there expanded pale\r\nand delicate amidst a knot of faded leaves.\r\n\r\nThese single flowers--the last of their race--Shirley culled as she\r\nwandered thoughtfully amongst the beds. She was fastening into her\r\ngirdle a hueless and scentless nosegay, when Henry Sympson called to her\r\nas he came limping from the house.\r\n\r\n"Shirley, Mr. Moore would be glad to see you in the schoolroom and to\r\nhear you read a little French, if you have no more urgent occupation."\r\n\r\nThe messenger delivered his commission very simply, as if it were a mere\r\nmatter of course.\r\n\r\n"Did Mr. Moore tell you to say that?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly; why not? And now, do come, and let us once more be as we\r\nwere at Sympson Grove. We used to have pleasant school-hours in those\r\ndays."\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar perhaps thought that circumstances were changed since then;\r\nhowever, she made no remark, but after a little reflection quietly\r\nfollowed Henry.\r\n\r\nEntering the schoolroom, she inclined her head with a decent obeisance,\r\nas had been her wont in former times. She removed her bonnet, and hung\r\nit up beside Henry\'s cap. Louis Moore sat at his desk, turning the\r\nleaves of a book, open before him, and marking passages with his pencil.\r\nHe just moved, in acknowledgment of her curtsy, but did not rise.\r\n\r\n"You proposed to read to me a few nights ago," said he. "I could not\r\nhear you then. My attention is now at your service. A little renewed\r\npractice in French may not be unprofitable. Your accent, I have\r\nobserved, begins to rust."\r\n\r\n"What book shall I take?"\r\n\r\n"Here are the posthumous works of St. Pierre. Read a few pages of the\r\n\'Fragments de l\'Amazone.\'"\r\n\r\nShe accepted the chair which he had placed in readiness near his own;\r\nthe volume lay on his desk--there was but one between them; her sweeping\r\ncurls dropped so low as to hide the page from him.\r\n\r\n"Put back your hair," he said.\r\n\r\nFor one moment Shirley looked not quite certain whether she would obey\r\nthe request or disregard it. A flicker of her eye beamed furtive on the\r\nprofessor\'s face. Perhaps if he had been looking at her harshly or\r\ntimidly, or if one undecided line had marked his countenance, she would\r\nhave rebelled, and the lesson had ended there and then; but he was only\r\nawaiting her compliance--as calm as marble, and as cool. She threw the\r\nveil of tresses behind her ear. It was well her face owned an agreeable\r\noutline, and that her cheek possessed the polish and the roundness of\r\nearly youth, or, thus robbed of a softening shade, the contours might\r\nhave lost their grace. But what mattered that in the present society?\r\nNeither Calypso nor Eucharis cared to fascinate Mentor.\r\n\r\nShe began to read. The language had become strange to her tongue; it\r\nfaltered; the lecture flowed unevenly, impeded by hurried breath, broken\r\nby Anglicized tones. She stopped.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t do it. Read me a paragraph, if you please, Mr. Moore."\r\n\r\nWhat _he_ read _she_ repeated. She caught his accent in three minutes.\r\n\r\n"Tr\xc3\xa8s bien," was the approving comment at the close of the piece.\r\n\r\n"C\'est presque le Fran\xc3\xa7ais rattrap\xc3\xa9, n\'est-ce pas?"\r\n\r\n"You could not write French as you once could, I dare say?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no! I should make strange work of my concords now."\r\n\r\n"You could not compose the _devoir_ of \'La Premi\xc3\xa8re Femme Savante\'?"\r\n\r\n"Do you still remember that rubbish?"\r\n\r\n"Every line."\r\n\r\n"I doubt you."\r\n\r\n"I will engage to repeat it word for word."\r\n\r\n"You would stop short at the first line."\r\n\r\n"Challenge me to the experiment."\r\n\r\n"I challenge you."\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to recite the following. He gave it in French, but we must\r\ntranslate, on pain of being unintelligible to some readers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    "And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of\r\n       the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons\r\n       of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they\r\n       took them wives of all which they chose."\r\n\r\nThis was in the dawn of time, before the morning stars were set, and\r\nwhile they yet sang together.\r\n\r\nThe epoch is so remote, the mists and dewy gray of matin twilight veil\r\nit with so vague an obscurity, that all distinct feature of custom, all\r\nclear line of locality, evade perception and baffle research. It must\r\nsuffice to know that the world then existed; that men peopled it; that\r\nman\'s nature, with its passions, sympathies, pains, and pleasures,\r\ninformed the planet and gave it soul.\r\n\r\nA certain tribe colonized a certain spot on the globe; of what race this\r\ntribe--unknown; in what region that spot--untold. We usually think of\r\nthe East when we refer to transactions of that date; but who shall\r\ndeclare that there was no life in the West, the South, the North? What\r\nis to disprove that this tribe, instead of camping under palm groves in\r\nAsia, wandered beneath island oak woods rooted in our own seas of\r\nEurope?\r\n\r\nIt is no sandy plain, nor any circumscribed and scant oasis I seem to\r\nrealize. A forest valley, with rocky sides and brown profundity of\r\nshade, formed by tree crowding on tree, descends deep before me. Here,\r\nindeed, dwell human beings, but so few, and in alleys so thick branched\r\nand overarched, they are neither heard nor seen. Are they savage?\r\nDoubtless. They live by the crook and the bow; half shepherds, half\r\nhunters, their flocks wander wild as their prey. Are they happy? No, not\r\nmore happy than we are at this day. Are they good? No, not better than\r\nourselves. Their nature is our nature--human both. There is one in this\r\ntribe too often miserable--a child bereaved of both parents. None cares\r\nfor this child. She is fed sometimes, but oftener forgotten. A hut\r\nrarely receives her; the hollow tree and chill cavern are her home.\r\nForsaken, lost, and wandering, she lives more with the wild beast and\r\nbird than with her own kind. Hunger and cold are her comrades; sadness\r\nhovers over, and solitude besets her round. Unheeded and unvalued, she\r\nshould die; but she both lives and grows. The green wilderness nurses\r\nher, and becomes to her a mother; feeds her on juicy berry, on\r\nsaccharine root and nut.\r\n\r\nThere is something in the air of this clime which fosters life kindly.\r\nThere must be something, too, in its dews which heals with sovereign\r\nbalm. Its gentle seasons exaggerate no passion, no sense; its\r\ntemperature tends to harmony; its breezes, you would say, bring down\r\nfrom heaven the germ of pure thought and purer feeling. Not grotesquely\r\nfantastic are the forms of cliff and foliage, not violently vivid the\r\ncolouring of flower and bird. In all the grandeur of these forests\r\nthere is repose; in all their freshness there is tenderness.\r\n\r\nThe gentle charm vouchsafed to flower and tree, bestowed on deer and\r\ndove, has not been denied to the human nursling. All solitary, she has\r\nsprung up straight and graceful. Nature cast her features in a fine\r\nmould; they have matured in their pure, accurate first lines, unaltered\r\nby the shocks of disease. No fierce dry blast has dealt rudely with the\r\nsurface of her frame; no burning sun has crisped or withered her\r\ntresses. Her form gleams ivory-white through the trees; her hair flows\r\nplenteous, long, and glossy; her eyes, not dazzled by vertical fires,\r\nbeam in the shade large and open, and full and dewy. Above those eyes,\r\nwhen the breeze bares her forehead, shines an expanse fair and ample--a\r\nclear, candid page, whereon knowledge, should knowledge ever come, might\r\nwrite a golden record. You see in the desolate young savage nothing\r\nvicious or vacant. She haunts the wood harmless and thoughtful, though\r\nof what one so untaught can think it is not easy to divine.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of one summer day, before the Flood, being utterly\r\nalone--for she had lost all trace of her tribe, who had wandered leagues\r\naway, she knew not where--she went up from the vale, to watch Day take\r\nleave and Night arrive. A crag overspread by a tree was her station. The\r\noak roots, turfed and mossed, gave a seat; the oak boughs, thick-leaved,\r\nwove a canopy.\r\n\r\nSlow and grand the Day withdrew, passing in purple fire, and parting to\r\nthe farewell of a wild, low chorus from the woodlands. Then Night\r\nentered, quiet as death. The wind fell, the birds ceased singing. Now\r\nevery nest held happy mates, and hart and hind slumbered blissfully safe\r\nin their lair.\r\n\r\nThe girl sat, her body still, her soul astir; occupied, however, rather\r\nin feeling than in thinking, in wishing than hoping, in imagining than\r\nprojecting. She felt the world, the sky, the night, boundlessly mighty.\r\nOf all things herself seemed to herself the centre--a small, forgotten\r\natom of life, a spark of soul, emitted inadvertent from the great\r\ncreative source, and now burning unmarked to waste in the heart of a\r\nblack hollow. She asked, was she thus to burn out and perish, her living\r\nlight doing no good, never seen, never needed--a star in an else\r\nstarless firmament, which nor shepherd, nor wanderer, nor sage, nor\r\npriest tracked as a guide or read as a prophecy? Could this be, she\r\ndemanded, when the flame of her intelligence burned so vivid; when her\r\nlife beat so true, and real, and potent; when something within her\r\nstirred disquieted, and restlessly asserted a God-given strength, for\r\nwhich it insisted she should find exercise?\r\n\r\nShe gazed abroad on Heaven and Evening. Heaven and Evening gazed back on\r\nher. She bent down, searching bank, hill, river, spread dim below. All\r\nshe questioned responded by oracles. She heard--she was impressed; but\r\nshe could not understand. Above her head she raised her hands joined\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n"Guidance--help--comfort--come!" was her cry.\r\n\r\nThere was no voice, nor any that answered.\r\n\r\nShe waited, kneeling, steadfastly looking up. Yonder sky was sealed; the\r\nsolemn stars shone alien and remote.\r\n\r\nAt last one overstretched chord of her agony slacked; she thought\r\nSomething above relented; she felt as if Something far round drew\r\nnigher; she heard as if Silence spoke. There was no language, no word,\r\nonly a tone.\r\n\r\nAgain--a fine, full, lofty tone, a deep, soft sound, like a storm\r\nwhispering, made twilight undulate.\r\n\r\nOnce more, profounder, nearer, clearer, it rolled harmonious.\r\n\r\nYet again--a distinct voice passed between Heaven and Earth.\r\n\r\n"Eva!"\r\n\r\nIf Eva were not this woman\'s name, she had none. She rose. "Here am I."\r\n\r\n"Eva!"\r\n\r\n"O Night (it can be but Night that speaks), I am here!"\r\n\r\nThe voice, descending, reached Earth.\r\n\r\n"Eva!"\r\n\r\n"Lord," she cried, "behold thine handmaid!"\r\n\r\nShe had her religion--all tribes held some creed.\r\n\r\n"I come--a Comforter!"\r\n\r\n"Lord, come quickly!"\r\n\r\nThe Evening flushed full of hope; the Air panted; the Moon--rising\r\nbefore--ascended large, but her light showed no shape.\r\n\r\n"Lean towards me, Eva. Enter my arms; repose thus."\r\n\r\n"Thus I lean, O Invisible but felt! And what art thou?"\r\n\r\n"Eva, I have brought a living draught from heaven. Daughter of Man,\r\ndrink of my cup!"\r\n\r\n"I drink: it is as if sweetest dew visited my lips in a full current. My\r\narid heart revives; my affliction is lightened; my strait and struggle\r\nare gone. And the night changes! the wood, the hill, the moon, the wide\r\nsky--all change!"\r\n\r\n"All change, and for ever. I take from thy vision darkness; I loosen\r\nfrom thy faculties fetters! I level in thy path obstacles; I with my\r\npresence fill vacancy. I claim as mine the lost atom of life. I take to\r\nmyself the spark of soul--burning heretofore forgotten!"\r\n\r\n"O take me! O claim me! This is a god."\r\n\r\n"This is a son of God--one who feels himself in the portion of life that\r\nstirs you. He is suffered to reclaim his own, and so to foster and aid\r\nthat it shall not perish hopeless."\r\n\r\n"A son of God! Am I indeed chosen?"\r\n\r\n"Thou only in this land. I saw thee that thou wert fair; I knew thee\r\nthat thou wert mine. To me it is given to rescue, to sustain, to cherish\r\nmine own. Acknowledge in me that Seraph on earth named Genius."\r\n\r\n"My glorious Bridegroom! true Dayspring from on high! All I would have\r\nat last I possess. I receive a revelation. The dark hint, the obscure\r\nwhisper, which have haunted me from childhood, are interpreted. Thou art\r\nHe I sought. Godborn, take me, thy bride!"\r\n\r\n"Unhumbled, I can take what is mine. Did I not give from the altar the\r\nvery flame which lit Eva\'s being? Come again into the heaven whence thou\r\nwert sent."\r\n\r\nThat Presence, invisible but mighty, gathered her in like a lamb to the\r\nfold; that voice, soft but all-pervading, vibrated through her heart\r\nlike music. Her eye received no image; and yet a sense visited her\r\nvision and her brain as of the serenity of stainless air, the power of\r\nsovereign seas, the majesty of marching stars, the energy of colliding\r\nelements, the rooted endurance of hills wide based, and, above all, as\r\nof the lustre of heroic beauty rushing victorious on the Night,\r\nvanquishing its shadows like a diviner sun.\r\n\r\nSuch was the bridal hour of Genius and Humanity. Who shall rehearse the\r\ntale of their after-union? Who shall depict its bliss and bale? Who\r\nshall tell how He between whom and the Woman God put enmity forged\r\ndeadly plots to break the bond or defile its purity? Who shall record\r\nthe long strife between Serpent and Seraph:--How still the Father of\r\nLies insinuated evil into good, pride into wisdom, grossness into glory,\r\npain into bliss, poison into passion? How the "dreadless Angel" defied,\r\nresisted, and repelled? How again and again he refined the polluted cup,\r\nexalted the debased emotion, rectified the perverted impulse, detected\r\nthe lurking venom, baffled the frontless temptation--purified,\r\njustified, watched, and withstood? How, by his patience, by his\r\nstrength, by that unutterable excellence he held from God--his\r\nOrigin--this faithful Seraph fought for Humanity a good fight through\r\ntime; and, when Time\'s course closed, and Death was encountered at the\r\nend, barring with fleshless arm the portals of Eternity, how Genius\r\nstill held close his dying bride, sustained her through the agony of the\r\npassage, bore her triumphant into his own home, Heaven; restored her,\r\nredeemed, to Jehovah, her Maker; and at last, before Angel and\r\nArchangel, crowned her with the crown of Immortality?\r\n\r\nWho shall of these things write the chronicle?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I never could correct that composition," observed Shirley, as Moore\r\nconcluded. "Your censor-pencil scored it with condemnatory lines, whose\r\nsignification I strove vainly to fathom."\r\n\r\nShe had taken a crayon from the tutor\'s desk, and was drawing little\r\nleaves, fragments of pillars, broken crosses, on the margin of the book.\r\n\r\n"French may be half forgotten, but the habits of the French lesson are\r\nretained, I see," said Louis. "My books would now, as erst, be unsafe\r\nwith you. My newly-bound St. Pierre would soon be like my Racine--Miss\r\nKeeldar, her mark, traced on every page."\r\n\r\nShirley dropped her crayon as if it burned her fingers.\r\n\r\n"Tell me what were the faults of that _devoir_?" she asked. "Were they\r\ngrammatical errors, or did you object to the substance?"\r\n\r\n"I never said that the lines I drew were indications of faults at all.\r\nYou would have it that such was the case, and I refrained from\r\ncontradiction."\r\n\r\n"What else did they denote?"\r\n\r\n"No matter now."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Moore," cried Henry, "make Shirley repeat some of the pieces she\r\nused to say so well by heart."\r\n\r\n"If I ask for any, it will be \'Le Cheval Dompt\xc3\xa9,\'" said Moore, trimming\r\nwith his penknife the pencil Miss Keeldar had worn to a stump.\r\n\r\nShe turned aside her head; the neck, the clear cheek, forsaken by their\r\nnatural veil, were seen to flush warm.\r\n\r\n"Ah! she has not forgotten, you see, sir," said Henry, exultant. "She\r\nknows how naughty she was."\r\n\r\nA smile, which Shirley would not permit to expand, made her lip tremble;\r\nshe bent her face, and hid it half with her arms, half in her curls,\r\nwhich, as she stooped, fell loose again. "Certainly I was a rebel," she\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n"A rebel!" repeated Henry. "Yes; you and papa had quarrelled terribly,\r\nand you set both him and mamma, and Mrs. Pryor, and everybody, at\r\ndefiance. You said he had insulted you----"\r\n\r\n"He _had_ insulted me," interposed Shirley.\r\n\r\n"And you wanted to leave Sympson Grove directly. You packed your things\r\nup, and papa threw them out of your trunk; mamma cried, Mrs. Pryor\r\ncried; they both stood wringing their hands begging you to be patient;\r\nand you knelt on the floor with your things and your up-turned box\r\nbefore you, looking, Shirley, looking--why, in one of _your_ passions.\r\nYour features, in such passions, are not distorted; they are fixed, but\r\nquite beautiful. You scarcely look angry, only resolute, and in a\r\ncertain haste; yet one feels that at such times an obstacle cast across\r\nyour path would be split as with lightning. Papa lost heart, and called\r\nMr. Moore."\r\n\r\n"Enough, Henry."\r\n\r\n"No, it is not enough. I hardly know how Mr. Moore managed, except that\r\nI recollect he suggested to papa that agitation would bring on his gout;\r\nand then he spoke quietly to the ladies, and got them away; and\r\nafterwards he said to you, Miss Shirley, that it was of no use talking\r\nor lecturing now, but that the tea-things were just brought into the\r\nschoolroom, and he was very thirsty, and he would be glad if you would\r\nleave your packing for the present and come and make a cup of tea for\r\nhim and me. You came; you would not talk at first, but soon you softened\r\nand grew cheerful. Mr. Moore began to tell us about the Continent, the\r\nwar, and Bonaparte--subjects we were both fond of listening to. After\r\ntea he said we should neither of us leave him that evening; he would not\r\nlet us stray out of his sight, lest we should again get into mischief.\r\nWe sat one on each side of him. We were so happy. I never passed so\r\npleasant an evening. The next day he gave you, missy, a lecture of an\r\nhour, and wound it up by marking you a piece to learn in Bossuet as a\r\npunishment-lesson--\'Le Cheval Dompt\xc3\xa9.\' You learned it instead of packing\r\nup, Shirley. We heard no more of your running away. Mr. Moore used to\r\ntease you on the subject for a year afterwards."\r\n\r\n"She never said a lesson with greater spirit," subjoined Moore. "She\r\nthen, for the first time, gave me the treat of hearing my native tongue\r\nspoken without accent by an English girl."\r\n\r\n"She was as sweet as summer cherries for a month afterwards," struck in\r\nHenry: "a good hearty quarrel always left Shirley\'s temper better than\r\nit found it."\r\n\r\n"You talk of me as if I were not present," observed Miss Keeldar, who\r\nhad not yet lifted her face.\r\n\r\n"Are you sure you _are_ present?" asked Moore. "There have been moments\r\nsince my arrival here when I have been tempted to inquire of the lady of\r\nFieldhead if she knew what had become of my former pupil."\r\n\r\n"She is here now."\r\n\r\n"I see her, and humble enough; but I would neither advise Harry nor\r\nothers to believe too implicitly in the humility which one moment can\r\nhide its blushing face like a modest little child, and the next lift it\r\npale and lofty as a marble Juno."\r\n\r\n"One man in times of old, it is said, imparted vitality to the statue he\r\nhad chiselled; others may have the contrary gift of turning life to\r\nstone."\r\n\r\nMoore paused on this observation before he replied to it. His look, at\r\nonce struck and meditative, said, "A strange phrase; what may it mean?"\r\nHe turned it over in his mind, with thought deep and slow, as some\r\nGerman pondering metaphysics.\r\n\r\n"You mean," he said at last, "that some men inspire repugnance, and so\r\nchill the kind heart."\r\n\r\n"Ingenious!" responded Shirley. "If the interpretation pleases you, you\r\nare welcome to hold it valid. _I_ don\'t care."\r\n\r\nAnd with that she raised her head, lofty in look and statue-like in hue,\r\nas Louis had described it.\r\n\r\n"Behold the metamorphosis!" he said; "scarce imagined ere it is\r\nrealized: a lowly nymph develops to an inaccessible goddess. But Henry\r\nmust not be disappointed of his recitation, and Olympia will deign to\r\noblige him. Let us begin."\r\n\r\n"I have forgotten the very first line."\r\n\r\n"Which I have not. _My_ memory, if a slow, is a retentive one. I acquire\r\ndeliberately both knowledge and liking. The acquisition grows into my\r\nbrain, and the sentiment into my breast; and it is not as the\r\nrapid-springing produce which, having no root in itself, flourishes\r\nverdurous enough for a time, but too soon falls withered away.\r\nAttention, Henry! Miss Keeldar consents to favour you. \'Voyez ce cheval\r\nardent et imp\xc3\xa9tueux,\' so it commences."\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar did consent to make the effort; but she soon stopped.\r\n\r\n"Unless I heard the whole repeated I cannot continue it," she said.\r\n\r\n"Yet it was quickly learned--\'soon gained, soon gone,\'" moralized the\r\ntutor. He recited the passage deliberately, accurately, with slow,\r\nimpressive emphasis.\r\n\r\nShirley, by degrees, inclined her ear as he went on. Her face, before\r\nturned from him, _re_turned towards him. When he ceased, she took the\r\nword up as if from his lips; she took his very tone; she seized his very\r\naccent; she delivered the periods as he had delivered them; she\r\nreproduced his manner, his pronunciation, his expression.\r\n\r\nIt was now her turn to petition.\r\n\r\n"Recall \'Le Songe d\'Athalie,\'" she entreated, "and say it."\r\n\r\nHe said it for her. She took it from him; she found lively excitement in\r\nthe pleasure of making his language her own. She asked for further\r\nindulgence; all the old school pieces were revived, and with them\r\nShirley\'s old school days.\r\n\r\nHe had gone through some of the best passages of Racine and Corneille,\r\nand then had heard the echo of his own deep tones in the girl\'s voice,\r\nthat modulated itself faithfully on his. "Le ch\xc3\xaane et le Roseau," that\r\nmost beautiful of La Fontaine\'s fables, had been recited, well recited,\r\nby the tutor, and the pupil had animatedly availed herself of the\r\nlesson. Perhaps a simultaneous feeling seized them now, that their\r\nenthusiasm had kindled to a glow, which the slight fuel of French poetry\r\nno longer sufficed to feed; perhaps they longed for a trunk of English\r\noak to be thrown as a Yule log to the devouring flame. Moore observed,\r\n"And these are our best pieces! And we have nothing more dramatic,\r\nnervous, natural!"\r\n\r\nAnd then he smiled and was silent. His whole nature seemed serenely\r\nalight. He stood on the hearth, leaning his elbow on the mantelpiece,\r\nmusing not unblissfully.\r\n\r\nTwilight was closing on the diminished autumn day. The schoolroom\r\nwindows--darkened with creeping plants, from which no high October winds\r\nhad as yet swept the sere foliage--admitted scarce a gleam of sky; but\r\nthe fire gave light enough to talk by.\r\n\r\nAnd now Louis Moore addressed his pupil in French, and she answered at\r\nfirst with laughing hesitation and in broken phrase. Moore encouraged\r\nwhile he corrected her. Henry joined in the lesson; the two scholars\r\nstood opposite the master, their arms round each other\'s waists. Tartar,\r\nwho long since had craved and obtained admission, sat sagely in the\r\ncentre of the rug, staring at the blaze which burst fitful from morsels\r\nof coal among the red cinders. The group were happy enough, but--\r\n\r\n    "Pleasures are like poppies spread;\r\n     You seize the flower--its bloom is shed."\r\n\r\nThe dull, rumbling sound of wheels was heard on the pavement in the\r\nyard.\r\n\r\n"It is the carriage returned," said Shirley; "and dinner must be just\r\nready, and I am not dressed."\r\n\r\nA servant came in with Mr. Moore\'s candle and tea; for the tutor and his\r\npupil usually dined at luncheon time.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Sympson and the ladies are returned," she said, "and Sir Philip\r\nNunnely is with them."\r\n\r\n"How you did start, and how your hand trembled, Shirley!" said Henry,\r\nwhen the maid had closed the shutter and was gone. "But I know\r\nwhy--don\'t you, Mr. Moore? I know what papa intends. He is a little ugly\r\nman, that Sir Philip. I wish he had not come. I wish sisters and all of\r\nthem had stayed at De Walden Hall to dine.--Shirley should once more\r\nhave made tea for you and me, Mr. Moore, and we would have had a happy\r\nevening of it."\r\n\r\nMoore was locking up his desk and putting away his St. Pierre. "That was\r\n_your_ plan, was it, my boy?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you approve it, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I approve nothing utopian. Look Life in its iron face; stare Reality\r\nout of its brassy countenance. Make the tea, Henry; I shall be back in a\r\nminute."\r\n\r\nHe left the room; so did Shirley, by another door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nPH\xc5\x92BE.\r\n\r\n\r\nShirley probably got on pleasantly with Sir Philip that evening, for the\r\nnext morning she came down in one of her best moods.\r\n\r\n"Who will take a walk with me?" she asked, after breakfast. "Isabella\r\nand Gertrude, will you?"\r\n\r\nSo rare was such an invitation from Miss Keeldar to her female cousins\r\nthat they hesitated before they accepted it. Their mamma, however,\r\nsignifying acquiescence in the project, they fetched their bonnets, and\r\nthe trio set out.\r\n\r\nIt did not suit these three young persons to be thrown much together.\r\nMiss Keeldar liked the society of few ladies; indeed, she had a cordial\r\npleasure in that of none except Mrs. Pryor and Caroline Helstone. She\r\nwas civil, kind, attentive even to her cousins; but still she usually\r\nhad little to say to them. In the sunny mood of this particular morning,\r\nshe contrived to entertain even the Misses Sympson. Without deviating\r\nfrom her wonted rule of discussing with them only ordinary themes, she\r\nimparted to these themes an extraordinary interest; the sparkle of her\r\nspirit glanced along her phrases.\r\n\r\nWhat made her so joyous? All the cause must have been in herself. The\r\nday was not bright. It was dim--a pale, waning autumn day. The walks\r\nthrough the dun woods were damp; the atmosphere was heavy, the sky\r\novercast; and yet it seemed that in Shirley\'s heart lived all the light\r\nand azure of Italy, as all its fervour laughed in her gray English eye.\r\n\r\nSome directions necessary to be given to her foreman, John, delayed her\r\nbehind her cousins as they neared Fieldhead on their return. Perhaps an\r\ninterval of twenty minutes elapsed between her separation from them and\r\nher re-entrance into the house. In the meantime she had spoken to John,\r\nand then she had lingered in the lane at the gate. A summons to\r\nluncheon called her in. She excused herself from the meal, and went\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\n"Is not Shirley coming to luncheon?" asked Isabella. "She said she was\r\nhungry."\r\n\r\nAn hour after, as she did not quit her chamber, one of her cousins went\r\nto seek her there. She was found sitting at the foot of the bed, her\r\nhead resting on her hand; she looked quite pale, very thoughtful, almost\r\nsad.\r\n\r\n"You are not ill?" was the question put.\r\n\r\n"A little sick," replied Miss Keeldar.\r\n\r\nCertainly she was not a little changed from what she had been two hours\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThis change, accounted for only by those three words, explained no\r\notherwise; this change--whencesoever springing, effected in a brief ten\r\nminutes--passed like no light summer cloud. She talked when she joined\r\nher friends at dinner, talked as usual. She remained with them during\r\nthe evening. When again questioned respecting her health, she declared\r\nherself perfectly recovered. It had been a mere passing faintness, a\r\nmomentary sensation, not worth a thought; yet it was felt there was a\r\ndifference in Shirley.\r\n\r\nThe next day--the day, the week, the fortnight after--this new and\r\npeculiar shadow lingered on the countenance, in the manner of Miss\r\nKeeldar. A strange quietude settled over her look, her movements, her\r\nvery voice. The alteration was not so marked as to court or permit\r\nfrequent questioning, yet it _was_ there, and it would not pass away. It\r\nhung over her like a cloud which no breeze could stir or disperse. Soon\r\nit became evident that to notice this change was to annoy her. First she\r\nshrank from remark; and, if persisted in, she, with her own peculiar\r\n_hauteur_, repelled it. "Was she ill?" The reply came with decision.\r\n\r\n"I _am not_."\r\n\r\n"Did anything weigh on her mind? Had anything happened to affect her\r\nspirits?"\r\n\r\nShe scornfully ridiculed the idea. "What did they mean by spirits? She\r\nhad no spirits, black or white, blue or gray, to affect."\r\n\r\n"Something must be the matter--she was so altered."\r\n\r\n"She supposed she had a right to alter at her ease. She knew she was\r\nplainer. If it suited her to grow ugly, why need others fret themselves\r\non the subject?"\r\n\r\n"There must be a cause for the change. What was it?"\r\n\r\nShe peremptorily requested to be let alone.\r\n\r\nThen she would make every effort to appear quite gay, and she seemed\r\nindignant at herself that she could not perfectly succeed. Brief\r\nself-spurning epithets burst from her lips when alone. "Fool! coward!"\r\nshe would term herself. "Poltroon!" she would say, "if you must tremble,\r\ntremble in secret! Quail where no eye sees you!"\r\n\r\n"How dare you," she would ask herself--"how dare you show your weakness\r\nand betray your imbecile anxieties? Shake them off; rise above them. If\r\nyou cannot do this, hide them."\r\n\r\nAnd to hide them she did her best. She once more became resolutely\r\nlively in company. When weary of effort and forced to relax, she sought\r\nsolitude--not the solitude of her chamber (she refused to mope, shut up\r\nbetween four walls), but that wilder solitude which lies out of doors,\r\nand which she could chase, mounted on Zo\xc3\xab, her mare. She took long rides\r\nof half a day. Her uncle disapproved, but he dared not remonstrate. It\r\nwas never pleasant to face Shirley\'s anger, even when she was healthy\r\nand gay; but now that her face showed thin, and her large eye looked\r\nhollow, there was something in the darkening of that face and kindling\r\nof that eye which touched as well as alarmed.\r\n\r\nTo all comparative strangers who, unconscious of the alterations in her\r\nspirits, commented on the alteration in her looks, she had one reply,--\r\n\r\n"I am perfectly well; I have not an ailment."\r\n\r\nAnd health, indeed, she must have had, to be able to bear the exposure\r\nto the weather she now encountered. Wet or fair, calm or storm, she took\r\nher daily ride over Stilbro\' Moor, Tartar keeping up at her side, with\r\nhis wolf-like gallop, long and untiring.\r\n\r\nTwice, three times, the eyes of gossips--those eyes which are\r\neverywhere, in the closet and on the hill-top--noticed that instead of\r\nturning on Rushedge, the top ridge of Stilbro\' Moor, she rode forwards\r\nall the way to the town. Scouts were not wanting to mark her destination\r\nthere. It was ascertained that she alighted at the door of one Mr.\r\nPearson Hall, a solicitor, related to the vicar of Nunnely. This\r\ngentleman and his ancestors had been the agents of the Keeldar family\r\nfor generations back. Some people affirmed that Miss Keeldar was become\r\ninvolved in business speculations connected with Hollow\'s Mill--that she\r\nhad lost money, and was constrained to mortgage her land. Others\r\nconjectured that she was going to be married, and that the settlements\r\nwere preparing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Moore and Henry Sympson were together in the schoolroom. The tutor\r\nwas waiting for a lesson which the pupil seemed busy in preparing.\r\n\r\n"Henry, make haste. The afternoon is getting on."\r\n\r\n"Is it, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. Are you nearly ready with that lesson?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Not _nearly_ ready?"\r\n\r\n"I have not construed a line."\r\n\r\nMr. Moore looked up. The boy\'s tone was rather peculiar.\r\n\r\n"The task presents no difficulties, Henry; or, if it does, bring them to\r\nme. We will work together."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Moore, I can do no work."\r\n\r\n"My boy, you are ill."\r\n\r\n"Sir, I am not worse in bodily health than usual, but my heart is full."\r\n\r\n"Shut the book. Come hither, Harry. Come to the fireside."\r\n\r\nHarry limped forward. His tutor placed him in a chair; his lips were\r\nquivering, his eyes brimming. He laid his crutch on the floor, bent down\r\nhis head, and wept.\r\n\r\n"This distress is not occasioned by physical pain, you say, Harry? You\r\nhave a grief; tell it me."\r\n\r\n"Sir, I have such a grief as I never had before. I wish it could be\r\nrelieved in some way; I can hardly bear it."\r\n\r\n"Who knows but, if we talk it over, we may relieve it? What is the\r\ncause? Whom does it concern?"\r\n\r\n"The cause, sir, is Shirley; it concerns Shirley."\r\n\r\n"Does it? You think her changed?"\r\n\r\n"All who know her think her changed--you too, Mr. Moore."\r\n\r\n"Not seriously--no. I see no alteration but such as a favourable turn\r\nmight repair in a few weeks; besides, her own word must go for\r\nsomething: she says she is well."\r\n\r\n"There it is, sir. As long as she maintained she was well, I believed\r\nher. When I was sad out of her sight, I soon recovered spirits in her\r\npresence. Now----"\r\n\r\n"Well, Harry, now. Has she said anything to you? You and she were\r\ntogether in the garden two hours this morning. I saw her talking, and\r\nyou listening. Now, my dear Harry, if Miss Keeldar has said she is ill,\r\nand enjoined you to keep her secret, do not obey her. For her life\'s\r\nsake, avow everything. Speak, my boy."\r\n\r\n"_She_ say she is ill! I believe, sir, if she were dying, she would\r\nsmile, and aver, \'Nothing ails me.\'"\r\n\r\n"What have you learned then? What new circumstance?"\r\n\r\n"I have learned that she has just made her will."\r\n\r\n"Made her will?"\r\n\r\nThe tutor and pupil were silent.\r\n\r\n"She told you that?" asked Moore, when some minutes had elapsed.\r\n\r\n"She told me quite cheerfully, not as an ominous circumstance, which I\r\nfelt it to be. She said I was the only person besides her solicitor,\r\nPearson Hall, and Mr. Helstone and Mr. Yorke, who knew anything about\r\nit; and to me, she intimated, she wished specially to explain its\r\nprovisions."\r\n\r\n"Go on, Harry."\r\n\r\n"\'Because,\' she said, looking down on me with her beautiful eyes--oh!\r\nthey _are_ beautiful, Mr. Moore! I love them! I love her! She is my\r\nstar! Heaven must not claim her! She is lovely in this world, and fitted\r\nfor this world. Shirley is not an angel; she is a woman, and she shall\r\nlive with men. Seraphs shall not have her! Mr. Moore, if one of the\r\n\'sons of God,\' with wings wide and bright as the sky, blue and sounding\r\nas the sea, having seen that she was fair, descended to claim her, his\r\nclaim should be withstood--withstood by me--boy and cripple as I am."\r\n\r\n"Henry Sympson, go on, when I tell you."\r\n\r\n"\'Because,\' she said, \'if I made no will, and died before you, Harry,\r\nall my property would go to you; and I do not intend that it should be\r\nso, though your father would like it. But you,\' she said, \'will have his\r\nwhole estate, which is large--larger than Fieldhead. Your sisters will\r\nhave nothing; so I have left them some money, though I do not love them,\r\nboth together, half so much as I love one lock of your fair hair.\' She\r\nsaid these words, and she called me her \'darling,\' and let me kiss her.\r\nShe went on to tell me that she had left Caroline Helstone some money\r\ntoo; that this manor house, with its furniture and books, she had\r\nbequeathed to me, as she did not choose to take the old family place\r\nfrom her own blood; and that all the rest of her property, amounting to\r\nabout twelve thousand pounds, exclusive of the legacies to my sisters\r\nand Miss Helstone, she had willed, not to me, seeing I was already rich,\r\nbut to a good man, who would make the best use of it that any human\r\nbeing could do--a man, she said, that was both gentle and brave, strong\r\nand merciful--a man that might not profess to be pious, but she knew he\r\nhad the secret of religion pure and undefiled before God. The spirit of\r\nlove and peace was with him. He visited the fatherless and widows in\r\ntheir affliction, and kept himself unspotted from the world. Then she\r\nasked, \'Do you approve what I have done, Harry?\' I could not answer. My\r\ntears choked me, as they do now."\r\n\r\nMr. Moore allowed his pupil a moment to contend with and master his\r\nemotion. He then demanded, "What else did she say?"\r\n\r\n"When I had signified my full consent to the conditions of her will, she\r\ntold me I was a generous boy, and she was proud of me. \'And now,\' she\r\nadded, \'in case anything should happen, you will know what to say to\r\nMalice when she comes whispering hard things in your ear, insinuating\r\nthat Shirley has wronged you, that she did not love you. You will know\r\nthat I _did_ love you, Harry; that no sister could have loved you\r\nbetter--my own treasure.\' Mr. Moore, sir, when I remember her voice, and\r\nrecall her look, my heart beats as if it would break its strings. She\r\n_may_ go to heaven before me--if God commands it, she _must_; but the\r\nrest of my life--and my life will not be long, I am glad of that\r\nnow--shall be a straight, quick, thoughtful journey in the path her step\r\nhas pressed. I thought to enter the vault of the Keeldars before her.\r\nShould it be otherwise, lay my coffin by Shirley\'s side."\r\n\r\nMoore answered him with a weighty calm, that offered a strange contrast\r\nto the boy\'s perturbed enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"You are wrong, both of you--you harm each other. If youth once falls\r\nunder the influence of a shadowy terror, it imagines there will never be\r\nfull sunlight again; its first calamity it fancies will last a lifetime.\r\nWhat more did she say? Anything more?"\r\n\r\n"We settled one or two family points between ourselves."\r\n\r\n"I should rather like to know what----"\r\n\r\n"But, Mr. Moore, you smile. _I_ could not smile to see Shirley in such a\r\nmood."\r\n\r\n"My boy, I am neither nervous, nor poetic, nor inexperienced. I see\r\nthings as they are; you don\'t as yet. Tell me these family points."\r\n\r\n"Only, sir, she asked me whether I considered myself most of a Keeldar\r\nor a Sympson; and I answered I was Keeldar to the core of the heart and\r\nto the marrow of the bones. She said she was glad of it; for, besides\r\nher, I was the only Keeldar left in England. And then we agreed on some\r\nmatters."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, that if I lived to inherit my father\'s estate, and her\r\nhouse, I was to take the name of Keeldar, and to make Fieldhead my\r\nresidence. Henry Shirley Keeldar I said I would be called; and I will.\r\nHer name and her manor house are ages old, and Sympson and Sympson Grove\r\nare of yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Come, you are neither of you going to heaven yet. I have the best hopes\r\nof you both, with your proud distinctions--a pair of half-fledged\r\neaglets. Now, what is your inference from all you have told me? Put it\r\ninto words."\r\n\r\n"That Shirley thinks she is going to die."\r\n\r\n"She referred to her health?"\r\n\r\n"Not once; but I assure you she is wasting. Her hands are grown quite\r\nthin, and so is her cheek."\r\n\r\n"Does she ever complain to your mother or sisters?"\r\n\r\n"Never. She laughs at them when they question her. Mr. Moore, she is a\r\nstrange being, so fair and girlish--not a man-like woman at all, not an\r\nAmazon, and yet lifting her head above both help and sympathy."\r\n\r\n"Do you know where she is now, Henry? Is she in the house, or riding\r\nout?"\r\n\r\n"Surely not out, sir. It rains fast."\r\n\r\n"True; which, however, is no guarantee that she is not at this moment\r\ncantering over Rushedge. Of late she has never permitted weather to be a\r\nhindrance to her rides."\r\n\r\n"You remember, Mr. Moore, how wet and stormy it was last Wednesday--so\r\nwild, indeed, that she would not permit Zo\xc3\xab to be saddled? Yet the blast\r\nshe thought too tempestuous for her mare she herself faced on foot; that\r\nafternoon she walked nearly as far as Nunnely. I asked her, when she\r\ncame in, if she was not afraid of taking cold. \'Not I,\' she said. \'It\r\nwould be too much good luck for me. I don\'t know, Harry, but the best\r\nthing that could happen to me would be to take a good cold and fever,\r\nand so pass off like other Christians.\' She is reckless, you see, sir."\r\n\r\n"Reckless indeed! Go and find out where she is, and if you can get an\r\nopportunity of speaking to her without attracting attention, request her\r\nto come here a minute."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\nHe snatched his crutch, and started up to go.\r\n\r\n"Harry!"\r\n\r\nHe returned.\r\n\r\n"Do not deliver the message formally. Word it as, in former days, you\r\nwould have worded an ordinary summons to the schoolroom."\r\n\r\n"I see, sir. She will be more likely to obey."\r\n\r\n"And, Harry----"\r\n\r\n"Sir?"\r\n\r\n"I will call you when I want you. Till then, you are dispensed from\r\nlessons."\r\n\r\nHe departed. Mr. Moore, left alone, rose from his desk.\r\n\r\n"I can be very cool and very supercilious with Henry," he said. "I can\r\nseem to make light of his apprehensions, and look down _du haut de ma\r\ngrandeur_ on his youthful ardour. To _him_ I can speak as if, in my\r\neyes, they were both children. Let me see if I can keep up the same r\xc3\xb4le\r\nwith her. I have known the moment when I seemed about to forget it, when\r\nConfusion and Submission seemed about to crush me with their soft\r\ntyranny, when my tongue faltered, and I have almost let the mantle drop,\r\nand stood in her presence, not master--no--but something else. I trust I\r\nshall never so play the fool. It is well for a Sir Philip Nunnely to\r\nredden when he meets her eye. He may permit himself the indulgence of\r\nsubmission. He may even, without disgrace, suffer his hand to tremble\r\nwhen it touches hers; but if one of her farmers were to show himself\r\nsusceptible and sentimental, he would merely prove his need of a strait\r\nwaistcoat. So far I have always done very well. She has sat near me, and\r\nI have not shaken--more than my desk. I have encountered her looks and\r\nsmiles like--why, like a tutor, as I am. Her hand I never yet\r\ntouched--never underwent that test. Her farmer or her footman I am\r\nnot--no serf nor servant of hers have I ever been; but I am poor, and it\r\nbehoves me to look to my self-respect--not to compromise an inch of it.\r\nWhat did she mean by that allusion to the cold people who petrify flesh\r\nto marble? It pleased me--I hardly know why; I would not permit myself\r\nto inquire. I never do indulge in scrutiny either of her language or\r\ncountenance; for if I did, I should sometimes forget common sense and\r\nbelieve in romance. A strange, secret ecstasy steals through my veins at\r\nmoments. I\'ll not encourage--I\'ll not remember it. I am resolved, as\r\nlong as may be, to retain the right to say with Paul, \'I am not mad, but\r\nspeak forth the words of truth and soberness.\'"\r\n\r\nHe paused, listening.\r\n\r\n"Will she come, or will she not come?" he inquired. "How will she take\r\nthe message? Na\xc3\xafvely or disdainfully? Like a child or like a queen? Both\r\ncharacters are in her nature.\r\n\r\n"If she comes, what shall I say to her? How account, firstly, for the\r\nfreedom of the request? Shall I apologize to her? I could in all\r\nhumility; but would an apology tend to place us in the positions we\r\nought relatively to occupy in this matter? I _must_ keep up the\r\nprofessor, otherwise---- I hear a door."\r\n\r\nHe waited. Many minutes passed.\r\n\r\n"She will refuse me. Henry is entreating her to come; she declines. My\r\npetition is presumption in her eyes. Let her _only_ come, I can teach\r\nher to the contrary. I would rather she were a little perverse; it will\r\nsteel me. I prefer her cuirassed in pride, armed with a taunt. Her scorn\r\nstartles me from my dreams; I stand up myself. A sarcasm from her eyes\r\nor lips puts strength into every nerve and sinew I have. Some step\r\napproaches, and not Henry\'s."\r\n\r\nThe door unclosed; Miss Keeldar came in. The message, it appeared, had\r\nfound her at her needle; she brought her work in her hand. That day she\r\nhad not been riding out; she had evidently passed it quietly. She wore\r\nher neat indoor dress and silk apron. This was no Thalestris from the\r\nfields, but a quiet domestic character from the fireside. Mr. Moore had\r\nher at advantage. He should have addressed her at once in solemn\r\naccents, and with rigid mien. Perhaps he would, had she looked saucy;\r\nbut her air never showed less of _cr\xc3\xa2nerie_. A soft kind of youthful\r\nshyness depressed her eyelid and mantled on her cheek. The tutor stood\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nShe made a full stop between the door and his desk.\r\n\r\n"Did you want me, sir?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I ventured, Miss Keeldar, to send for you--that is, to ask an interview\r\nof a few minutes."\r\n\r\nShe waited; she plied her needle.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir" (not lifting her eyes), "what about?"\r\n\r\n"Be seated first. The subject I would broach is one of some moment.\r\nPerhaps I have hardly a right to approach it. It is possible I ought to\r\nframe an apology; it is possible no apology can excuse me. The liberty I\r\nhave taken arises from a conversation with Henry. The boy is unhappy\r\nabout your health; all your friends are unhappy on that subject. It is\r\nof your health I would speak."\r\n\r\n"I am quite well," she said briefly.\r\n\r\n"Yet changed."\r\n\r\n"That matters to none but myself. We all change."\r\n\r\n"Will you sit down? Formerly, Miss Keeldar, I had some influence with\r\nyou: have I any now? May I feel that what I am saying is not accounted\r\npositive presumption?"\r\n\r\n"Let me read some French, Mr. Moore, or I will even take a spell at the\r\nLatin grammar, and let us proclaim a truce to all sanitary discussions."\r\n\r\n"No, no. It is time there were discussions."\r\n\r\n"Discuss away, then, but do not choose me for your text. I am a healthy\r\nsubject."\r\n\r\n"Do you not think it wrong to affirm and reaffirm what is substantially\r\nuntrue?"\r\n\r\n"I say I am well. I have neither cough, pain, nor fever."\r\n\r\n"Is there no equivocation in that assertion? Is it the direct truth?"\r\n\r\n"The direct truth."\r\n\r\nLouis Moore looked at her earnestly.\r\n\r\n"I can myself," he said, "trace no indications of actual disease. But\r\nwhy, then, are you altered?"\r\n\r\n"_Am_ I altered?"\r\n\r\n"We will try. We will seek a proof."\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"I ask, in the first place, do you sleep as you used to?"\r\n\r\n"I do not; but it is not because I am ill."\r\n\r\n"Have you the appetite you once had?"\r\n\r\n"No; but it is not because I am ill."\r\n\r\n"You remember this little ring fastened to my watch-chain? It was my\r\nmother\'s, and is too small to pass the joint of my little finger. You\r\nhave many a time sportively purloined it. It fitted your fore-finger.\r\nTry now."\r\n\r\nShe permitted the test. The ring dropped from the wasted little hand.\r\nLouis picked it up, and reattached it to the chain. An uneasy flush\r\ncoloured his brow. Shirley again said, "It is not because I am ill."\r\n\r\n"Not only have you lost sleep, appetite, and flesh," proceeded Moore,\r\n"but your spirits are always at ebb. Besides, there is a nervous alarm\r\nin your eye, a nervous disquiet in your manner. These peculiarities were\r\nnot formerly yours."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Moore, we will pause here. You have exactly hit it. I am nervous.\r\nNow, talk of something else. What wet weather we have--steady, pouring\r\nrain!"\r\n\r\n"_You_ nervous? Yes; and if Miss Keeldar is nervous, it is not without a\r\ncause. Let me reach it. Let me look nearer. The ailment is not physical.\r\nI have suspected that. It came in one moment. I know the day. I noticed\r\nthe change. Your pain is mental."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. It is nothing so dignified--merely nervous. Oh! dismiss the\r\ntopic."\r\n\r\n"When it is exhausted; not till then. Nervous alarms should always be\r\ncommunicated, that they may be dissipated. I wish I had the gift of\r\npersuasion, and could incline you to speak willingly. I believe\r\nconfession, in your case, would be half equivalent to cure."\r\n\r\n"No," said Shirley abruptly. "I wish that were at all probable; but I am\r\nafraid it is not."\r\n\r\nShe suspended her work a moment. She was now seated. Resting her elbow\r\non the table, she leaned her head on her hand. Mr. Moore looked as if he\r\nfelt he had at last gained some footing in this difficult path. She was\r\nserious, and in her wish was implied an important admission; after that\r\nshe could no longer affirm that _nothing_ ailed her.\r\n\r\nThe tutor allowed her some minutes for repose and reflection ere he\r\nreturned to the charge. Once his lips moved to speak, but he thought\r\nbetter of it, and prolonged the pause. Shirley lifted her eye to his.\r\nHad he betrayed injudicious emotion, perhaps obstinate persistence in\r\nsilence would have been the result; but he looked calm, strong,\r\ntrustworthy.\r\n\r\n"I had better tell _you_ than my aunt," she said, "or than my cousins,\r\nor my uncle. They would all make such a bustle, and it is that very\r\nbustle I dread--the alarm, the flurry, the _\xc3\xa9clat_. In short, I never\r\nliked to be the centre of a small domestic whirlpool. You can bear a\r\nlittle shock--eh?"\r\n\r\n"A great one, if necessary."\r\n\r\nNot a muscle of the man\'s frame moved, and yet his large heart beat fast\r\nin his deep chest. What was she going to tell him? Was irremediable\r\nmischief done?\r\n\r\n"Had I thought it right to go to you, I would never have made a secret\r\nof the matter one moment," she continued. "I would have told you at\r\nonce, and asked advice."\r\n\r\n"Why was it not right to come to me?"\r\n\r\n"It might be _right_--I do not mean that; but I could not do it. I\r\nseemed to have no title to trouble you. The mishap concerned me only. I\r\nwanted to keep it to myself, and people will not let me. I tell you, I\r\nhate to be an object of worrying attention, or a theme for village\r\ngossip. Besides, it may pass away without result--God knows!"\r\n\r\nMoore, though tortured with suspense, did not demand a quick\r\nexplanation. He suffered neither gesture, glance, nor word to betray\r\nimpatience. His tranquillity tranquillized Shirley; his confidence\r\nreassured her.\r\n\r\n"Great effects may spring from trivial causes," she remarked, as she\r\nloosened a bracelet from her wrist. Then, unfastening her sleeve, and\r\npartially turning it up, "Look here, Mr. Moore."\r\n\r\nShe showed a mark in her white arm--rather a deep though healed-up\r\nindentation--something between a burn and a cut.\r\n\r\n"I would not show that to any one in Briarfield but you, because you can\r\ntake it quietly."\r\n\r\n"Certainly there is nothing in the little mark to shock. Its history\r\nwill explain."\r\n\r\n"Small as it is, it has taken my sleep away, and made me nervous, thin,\r\nand foolish; because, on account of that little mark, I am obliged to\r\nlook forward to a possibility that has its terrors."\r\n\r\nThe sleeve was readjusted, the bracelet replaced.\r\n\r\n"Do you know that you try me?" he said, smiling. "I am a patient sort of\r\nman, but my pulse is quickening."\r\n\r\n"Whatever happens, you will befriend me, Mr. Moore? You will give me the\r\nbenefit of your self-possession, and not leave me at the mercy of\r\nagitated cowards?"\r\n\r\n"I make no promise now. Tell me the tale, and then exact what pledge you\r\nwill."\r\n\r\n"It is a very short tale. I took a walk with Isabella and Gertrude one\r\nday, about three weeks ago. They reached home before me; I stayed behind\r\nto speak to John. After leaving him, I pleased myself with lingering in\r\nthe lane, where all was very still and shady. I was tired of chattering\r\nto the girls, and in no hurry to rejoin them. As I stood leaning against\r\nthe gate-pillar, thinking some very happy thoughts about my future\r\nlife--for that morning I imagined that events were beginning to turn as\r\nI had long wished them to turn----"\r\n\r\n"Ah! Nunnely had been with her the evening before!" thought Moore\r\nparenthetically.\r\n\r\n"I heard a panting sound; a dog came running up the lane. I know most of\r\nthe dogs in this neighbourhood. It was Ph\xc5\x93be, one of Mr. Sam Wynne\'s\r\npointers. The poor creature ran with her head down, her tongue hanging\r\nout; she looked as if bruised and beaten all over. I called her. I meant\r\nto coax her into the house and give her some water and dinner. I felt\r\nsure she had been ill-used. Mr. Sam often flogs his pointers cruelly.\r\nShe was too flurried to know me; and when I attempted to pat her head,\r\nshe turned and snatched at my arm. She bit it so as to draw blood, then\r\nran panting on. Directly after, Mr. Wynne\'s keeper came up, carrying a\r\ngun. He asked if I had seen a dog. I told him I had seen Ph\xc5\x93be.\r\n\r\n"\'You had better chain up Tartar, ma\'am,\' he said, \'and tell your people\r\nto keep within the house. I am after Ph\xc5\x93be to shoot her, and the groom\r\nis gone another way. She is raging mad.\'"\r\n\r\nMr. Moore leaned back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest.\r\nMiss Keeldar resumed her square of silk canvas, and continued the\r\ncreation of a wreath of Parmese violets.\r\n\r\n"And you told no one, sought no help, no cure? You would not come to\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"I got as far as the schoolroom door; there my courage failed. I\r\npreferred to cushion the matter."\r\n\r\n"Why? What can I demand better in this world than to be of use to you?"\r\n\r\n"I had no claim."\r\n\r\n"Monstrous! And you did nothing?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I walked straight into the laundry, where they are ironing most of\r\nthe week, now that I have so many guests in the house. While the maid\r\nwas busy crimping or starching, I took an Italian iron from the fire,\r\nand applied the light scarlet glowing tip to my arm. I bored it well\r\nin. It cauterized the little wound. Then I went upstairs."\r\n\r\n"I dare say you never once groaned?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure I don\'t know. I was very miserable--not firm or tranquil at\r\nall, I think. There was no calm in my mind."\r\n\r\n"There was calm in your person. I remember listening the whole time we\r\nsat at luncheon, to hear if you moved in the room above. All was quiet."\r\n\r\n"I was sitting at the foot of the bed, wishing Ph\xc5\x93be had not bitten\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"And alone. You like solitude."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me."\r\n\r\n"You disdain sympathy."\r\n\r\n"Do I, Mr. Moore?"\r\n\r\n"With your powerful mind you must feel independent of help, of advice,\r\nof society."\r\n\r\n"So be it, since it pleases you."\r\n\r\nShe smiled. She pursued her embroidery carefully and quickly, but her\r\neyelash twinkled, and then it glittered, and then a drop fell.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore leaned forward on his desk, moved his chair, altered his\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n"If it is not so," he asked, with a peculiar, mellow change in his\r\nvoice, "how is it, then?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"You do know, but you won\'t speak. All must be locked up in yourself."\r\n\r\n"Because it is not worth sharing."\r\n\r\n"Because nobody can give the high price you require for your confidence.\r\nNobody is rich enough to purchase it. Nobody has the honour, the\r\nintellect, the power you demand in your adviser. There is not a shoulder\r\nin England on which you would rest your hand for support, far less a\r\nbosom which you would permit to pillow your head. Of course you must\r\nlive alone."\r\n\r\n"I _can_ live alone, if need be. But the question is not how to live,\r\nbut how to die alone. That strikes me in a more grisly light."\r\n\r\n"You apprehend the effects of the virus? You anticipate an indefinitely\r\nthreatening, dreadful doom?"\r\n\r\nShe bowed.\r\n\r\n"You are very nervous and womanish."\r\n\r\n"You complimented me two minutes since on my powerful mind."\r\n\r\n"You are very womanish. If the whole affair were coolly examined and\r\ndiscussed, I feel assured it would turn out that there is no danger of\r\nyour dying at all."\r\n\r\n"Amen! I am very willing to live, if it please God. I have felt life\r\nsweet."\r\n\r\n"How can it be otherwise than sweet with your endowments and nature? Do\r\nyou truly expect that you will be seized with hydrophobia, and die\r\nraving mad?"\r\n\r\n"I _expect_ it, and have _feared_ it. Just now I fear nothing."\r\n\r\n"Nor do I, on your account. I doubt whether the smallest particle of\r\nvirus mingled with your blood; and if it did, let me assure you that,\r\nyoung, healthy, faultlessly sound as you are, no harm will ensue. For\r\nthe rest, I shall inquire whether the dog was really mad. I hold she was\r\nnot mad."\r\n\r\n"Tell nobody that she bit me."\r\n\r\n"Why should I, when I believe the bite innocuous as a cut of this\r\npenknife? Make yourself easy. _I_ am easy, though I value your life as\r\nmuch as I do my own chance of happiness in eternity. Look up."\r\n\r\n"Why, Mr. Moore?"\r\n\r\n"I wish to see if you are cheered. Put your work down; raise your head."\r\n\r\n"There----"\r\n\r\n"Look at me. Thank you. And is the cloud broken?"\r\n\r\n"I fear nothing."\r\n\r\n"Is your mind restored to its own natural sunny clime?"\r\n\r\n"I am very content; but I want your promise."\r\n\r\n"Dictate."\r\n\r\n"You know, in case the worst I _have_ feared should happen, they will\r\nsmother me. You need not smile. They will; they always do. My uncle will\r\nbe full of horror, weakness, precipitation; and that is the only\r\nexpedient which will suggest itself to him. Nobody in the house will be\r\nself-possessed but you. Now promise to befriend me--to keep Mr. Sympson\r\naway from me, not to let Henry come near, lest I should hurt him.\r\nMind--_mind_ that you take care of yourself too. But I shall not injure\r\nyou; I know I shall not. Lock the chamber door against the surgeons;\r\nturn them out if they get in. Let neither the young nor the old MacTurk\r\nlay a finger on me; nor Mr. Greaves, their colleague; and lastly, if I\r\ngive trouble, with your own hand administer to me a strong\r\nnarcotic--such a sure dose of laudanum as shall leave no mistake.\r\n_Promise to do this._"\r\n\r\nMoore left his desk, and permitted himself the recreation of one or two\r\nturns through the room. Stopping behind Shirley\'s chair, he bent over\r\nher, and said, in a low, emphatic voice, "I promise all you ask--without\r\ncomment, without reservation."\r\n\r\n"If female help is needed, call in my housekeeper, Mrs. Gill. Let her\r\nlay me out if I die. She is attached to me. She wronged me again and\r\nagain, and again and again I forgave her. She now loves me, and would\r\nnot defraud me of a pin. Confidence has made her honest; forbearance has\r\nmade her kind-hearted. At this day I can trust both her integrity, her\r\ncourage, and her affection. Call her; but keep my good aunt and my timid\r\ncousins away. Once more, promise."\r\n\r\n"I promise."\r\n\r\n"That is good in you," she said, looking up at him as he bent over her,\r\nand smiling.\r\n\r\n"Is it good? Does it comfort?"\r\n\r\n"Very much."\r\n\r\n"I will be with you--I and Mrs. Gill only--in any, in every extremity\r\nwhere calm and fidelity are needed. No rash or coward hand shall\r\nmeddle."\r\n\r\n"Yet you think me childish?"\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"Ah! you despise me."\r\n\r\n"Do we despise children?"\r\n\r\n"In fact, I am neither so strong, nor have I such pride in my strength,\r\nas people think, Mr. Moore; nor am I so regardless of sympathy. But when\r\nI have any grief, I fear to impart it to those I love, lest it should\r\npain them; and to those whom I view with indifference I cannot\r\ncondescend to complain. After all, you should not taunt me with being\r\nchildish, for if you were as unhappy as I have been for the last three\r\nweeks, you too would want some friend."\r\n\r\n"We all want a friend, do we not?"\r\n\r\n"All of us that have anything good in our natures."\r\n\r\n"Well, you have Caroline Helstone."\r\n\r\n"Yes. And you have Mr. Hall."\r\n\r\n"Yes. Mrs. Pryor is a wise, good woman. She can counsel you when you\r\nneed counsel."\r\n\r\n"For your part, you have your brother Robert."\r\n\r\n"For any right-hand defections, there is the Rev. Matthewson Helstone,\r\nM.A., to lean upon; for any left-hand fallings-off there is Hiram Yorke,\r\nEsq. Both elders pay you homage."\r\n\r\n"I never saw Mrs. Yorke so motherly to any young man as she is to you. I\r\ndon\'t know how you have won her heart, but she is more tender to you\r\nthan she is to her own sons. You have, besides, your sister Hortense."\r\n\r\n"It appears we are both well provided."\r\n\r\n"It appears so."\r\n\r\n"How thankful we ought to be!"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"How contented!"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"For my part, I am almost contented just now, and very thankful.\r\nGratitude is a divine emotion. It fills the heart, but not to bursting;\r\nit warms it, but not to fever. I like to taste leisurely of bliss.\r\nDevoured in haste, I do not know its flavour."\r\n\r\nStill leaning on the back of Miss Keeldar\'s chair, Moore watched the\r\nrapid motion of her fingers, as the green and purple garland grew\r\nbeneath them. After a prolonged pause, he again asked, "Is the shadow\r\n_quite_ gone?"\r\n\r\n"Wholly. As I _was_ two hours since, and as I _am_ now, are two\r\ndifferent states of existence. I believe, Mr. Moore, griefs and fears\r\nnursed in silence grow like Titan infants."\r\n\r\n"You will cherish such feelings no more in silence?"\r\n\r\n"Not if I dare speak."\r\n\r\n"In using the word \'_dare_,\' to whom do you allude?"\r\n\r\n"To you."\r\n\r\n"How is it applicable to me?"\r\n\r\n"On account of your austerity and shyness."\r\n\r\n"Why am I austere and shy?"\r\n\r\n"Because you are proud."\r\n\r\n"Why am I proud?"\r\n\r\n"I should like to know. Will you be good enough to tell me?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, because I am poor, for one reason. Poverty and pride often go\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"That is such a nice reason. I should be charmed to discover another\r\nthat would pair with it. Mate that turtle, Mr. Moore."\r\n\r\n"Immediately. What do you think of marrying to sober Poverty many-tinted\r\nCaprice?"\r\n\r\n"Are you capricious?"\r\n\r\n"_You_ are."\r\n\r\n"A libel. I am steady as a rock, fixed as the polar star."\r\n\r\n"I look out at some early hour of the day, and see a fine, perfect\r\nrainbow, bright with promise, gloriously spanning the beclouded welkin\r\nof life. An hour afterwards I look again: half the arch is gone, and the\r\nrest is faded. Still later, the stern sky denies that it ever wore so\r\nbenign a symbol of hope."\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Moore, you should contend against these changeful humours.\r\nThey are your besetting sin. One never knows where to have you."\r\n\r\n"Miss Keeldar, I had once, for two years, a pupil who grew very dear to\r\nme. Henry is dear, but she was dearer. Henry never gives me trouble;\r\nshe--well, she did. I think she vexed me twenty-three hours out of the\r\ntwenty-four----"\r\n\r\n"She was never with you above three hours, or at the most six at a\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"She sometimes spilled the draught from my cup, and stole the food from\r\nmy plate; and when she had kept me unfed for a day (and that did not\r\nsuit me, for I am a man accustomed to take my meals with reasonable\r\nrelish, and to ascribe due importance to the rational enjoyment of\r\ncreature comforts)----"\r\n\r\n"I know you do. I can tell what sort of dinners you like best--perfectly\r\nwell. I know precisely the dishes you prefer----"\r\n\r\n"She robbed these dishes of flavour, and made a fool of me besides. I\r\nlike to sleep well. In my quiet days, when I was my own man, I never\r\nquarrelled with the night for being long, nor cursed my bed for its\r\nthorns. She changed all this."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Moore----"\r\n\r\n"And having taken from me peace of mind and ease of life, she took from\r\nme herself--quite coolly, just as if, when she was gone, the world would\r\nbe all the same to me. I knew I should see her again at some time. At\r\nthe end of two years, it fell out that we encountered again under her\r\nown roof, where she was mistress. How do you think she bore herself\r\ntowards me, Miss Keeldar?"\r\n\r\n"Like one who had profited well by lessons learned from yourself."\r\n\r\n"She received me haughtily. She meted out a wide space between us, and\r\nkept me aloof by the reserved gesture, the rare and alienated glance,\r\nthe word calmly civil."\r\n\r\n"She was an excellent pupil! Having seen you distant, she at once\r\nlearned to withdraw. Pray, sir, admire in her _hauteur_ a careful\r\nimprovement on your own coolness."\r\n\r\n"Conscience, and honour, and the most despotic necessity dragged me\r\napart from her, and kept me sundered with ponderous fetters. She was\r\nfree: she might have been clement."\r\n\r\n"Never free to compromise her self-respect, to seek where she had been\r\nshunned."\r\n\r\n"Then she was inconsistent; she tantalized as before. When I thought I\r\nhad made up my mind to seeing in her only a lofty stranger, she would\r\nsuddenly show me such a glimpse of loving simplicity--she would warm me\r\nwith such a beam of reviving sympathy, she would gladden an hour with\r\nconverse so gentle, gay, and kindly--that I could no more shut my heart\r\non her image than I could close that door against her presence. Explain\r\nwhy she distressed me so."\r\n\r\n"She could not bear to be quite outcast; and then she would sometimes\r\nget a notion into her head, on a cold, wet day, that the schoolroom was\r\nno cheerful place, and feel it incumbent on her to go and see if you and\r\nHenry kept up a good fire; and once there, she liked to stay."\r\n\r\n"But she should not be changeful. If she came at all, she should come\r\noftener."\r\n\r\n"There is such a thing as intrusion."\r\n\r\n"To-morrow you will not be as you are to-day."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Will you?"\r\n\r\n"I am not mad, most noble Berenice! We may give one day to dreaming, but\r\nthe next we must awake; and I shall awake to purpose the morning you are\r\nmarried to Sir Philip Nunnely. The fire shines on you and me, and shows\r\nus very clearly in the glass, Miss Keeldar; and I have been gazing on\r\nthe picture all the time I have been talking. Look up! What a difference\r\nbetween your head and mine! I look old for thirty!"\r\n\r\n"You are so grave; you have such a square brow; and your face is sallow.\r\nI never regard you as a young man, nor as Robert\'s junior."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you? I thought not. Imagine Robert\'s clear-cut, handsome face\r\nlooking over my shoulder. Does not the apparition make vividly manifest\r\nthe obtuse mould of my heavy traits? There!" (he started), "I have been\r\nexpecting that wire to vibrate this last half-hour."\r\n\r\nThe dinner-bell rang, and Shirley rose.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Moore," she said, as she gathered up her silks, "have you heard\r\nfrom your brother lately? Do you know what he means by staying in town\r\nso long? Does he talk of returning?"\r\n\r\n"He talks of returning; but what has caused his long absence I cannot\r\ntell. To speak the truth, I thought none in Yorkshire knew better than\r\nyourself why he was reluctant to come home."\r\n\r\nA crimson shadow passed across Miss Keeldar\'s cheek.\r\n\r\n"Write to him and urge him to come," she said. "I know there has been no\r\nimpolicy in protracting his absence thus far. It is good to let the mill\r\nstand, while trade is so bad; but he must not abandon the county."\r\n\r\n"I am aware," said Louis, "that he had an interview with you the evening\r\nbefore he left, and I saw him quit Fieldhead afterwards. I read his\r\ncountenance, or _tried_ to read it. He turned from me. I divined that he\r\nwould be long away. Some fine, slight fingers have a wondrous knack at\r\npulverizing a man\'s brittle pride. I suppose Robert put too much trust\r\nin his manly beauty and native gentlemanhood. Those are better off who,\r\nbeing destitute of advantage, cannot cherish delusion. But I will write,\r\nand say you advise his return."\r\n\r\n"Do not say _I_ advise his return, but that his return is advisable."\r\n\r\nThe second bell rang, and Miss Keeldar obeyed its call.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nLOUIS MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLouis Moore was used to a quiet life. Being a quiet man, he endured it\r\nbetter than most men would. Having a large world of his own in his own\r\nhead and heart, he tolerated confinement to a small, still corner of the\r\nreal world very patiently.\r\n\r\nHow hushed is Fieldhead this evening! All but Moore--Miss Keeldar, the\r\nwhole family of the Sympsons, even Henry--are gone to Nunnely. Sir\r\nPhilip would have them come; he wished to make them acquainted with his\r\nmother and sisters, who are now at the priory. Kind gentleman as the\r\nbaronet is, he asked the tutor too; but the tutor would much sooner have\r\nmade an appointment with the ghost of the Earl of Huntingdon to meet\r\nhim, and a shadowy ring of his merry men, under the canopy of the\r\nthickest, blackest, oldest oak in Nunnely Forest. Yes, he would rather\r\nhave appointed tryst with a phantom abbess, or mist-pale nun, among the\r\nwet and weedy relics of that ruined sanctuary of theirs, mouldering in\r\nthe core of the wood. Louis Moore longs to have something near him\r\nto-night; but not the boy-baronet, nor his benevolent but stern mother,\r\nnor his patrician sisters, nor one soul of the Sympsons.\r\n\r\nThis night is not calm; the equinox still struggles in its storms. The\r\nwild rains of the day are abated; the great single cloud disparts and\r\nrolls away from heaven, not passing and leaving a sea all sapphire, but\r\ntossed buoyant before a continued, long-sounding, high-rushing moonlight\r\ntempest. The moon reigns glorious, glad of the gale, as glad as if she\r\ngave herself to his fierce caress with love. No Endymion will watch for\r\nhis goddess to-night. There are no flocks out on the mountains; and it\r\nis well, for to-night she welcomes \xc3\x86olus.\r\n\r\nMoore, sitting in the schoolroom, heard the storm roar round the other\r\ngable and along the hall-front. This end was sheltered. He wanted no\r\nshelter; he desired no subdued sounds or screened position.\r\n\r\n"All the parlours are empty," said he. "I am sick at heart of this\r\ncell."\r\n\r\nHe left it, and went where the casements, larger and freer than the\r\nbranch-screened lattice of his own apartment, admitted unimpeded the\r\ndark-blue, the silver-fleeced, the stirring and sweeping vision of the\r\nautumn night-sky. He carried no candle; unneeded was lamp or fire. The\r\nbroad and clear though cloud-crossed and fluctuating beam of the moon\r\nshone on every floor and wall.\r\n\r\nMoore wanders through all the rooms. He seems following a phantom from\r\nparlour to parlour. In the oak room he stops. This is not chill, and\r\npolished, and fireless like the _salon_. The hearth is hot and ruddy;\r\nthe cinders tinkle in the intense heat of their clear glow; near the rug\r\nis a little work-table, a desk upon it, a chair near it.\r\n\r\nDoes the vision Moore has tracked occupy that chair? You would think so,\r\ncould you see him standing before it. There is as much interest now in\r\nhis eye, and as much significance in his face, as if in this household\r\nsolitude he had found a living companion, and was going to speak to it.\r\n\r\nHe makes discoveries. A bag--a small satin bag--hangs on the chair-back.\r\nThe desk is open, the keys are in the lock. A pretty seal, a silver pen,\r\na crimson berry or two of ripe fruit on a green leaf, a small, clean,\r\ndelicate glove--these trifles at once decorate and disarrange the stand\r\nthey strew. Order forbids details in a picture--she puts them tidily\r\naway; but details give charm.\r\n\r\nMoore spoke.\r\n\r\n"Her mark," he said. "Here she has been--careless, attractive\r\nthing!--called away in haste, doubtless, and forgetting to return and\r\nput all to rights. Why does she leave fascination in her footprints?\r\nWhence did she acquire the gift to be heedless and never offend? There\r\nis always something to chide in her, and the reprimand never settles in\r\ndispleasure on the heart, but, for her lover or her husband, when it had\r\ntrickled a while in words, would naturally melt from his lips in a kiss.\r\nBetter pass half an hour in remonstrating with her than a day in\r\nadmiring or praising any other woman alive. Am I muttering?\r\nsoliloquizing? Stop that."\r\n\r\nHe did stop it. He stood thinking, and then he made an arrangement for\r\nhis evening\'s comfort.\r\n\r\nHe dropped the curtains over the broad window and regal moon. He shut\r\nout sovereign and court and starry armies; he added fuel to the hot but\r\nfast-wasting fire; he lit a candle, of which there were a pair on the\r\ntable; he placed another chair opposite that near the workstand; and\r\nthen he sat down. His next movement was to take from his pocket a small,\r\nthick book of blank paper, to produce a pencil, and to begin to write in\r\na cramp, compact hand. Come near, by all means, reader. Do not be shy.\r\nStoop over his shoulder fearlessly, and read as he scribbles.\r\n\r\n"It is nine o\'clock; the carriage will not return before eleven, I am\r\ncertain. Freedom is mine till then; till then I may occupy her room, sit\r\nopposite her chair, rest my elbow on her table, have her little\r\nmementoes about me.\r\n\r\n"I used rather to like Solitude--to fancy her a somewhat quiet and\r\nserious, yet fair nymph; an Oread, descending to me from lone\r\nmountain-passes, something of the blue mist of hills in her array and of\r\ntheir chill breeze in her breath, but much also of their solemn beauty\r\nin her mien. I once could court her serenely, and imagine my heart\r\neasier when I held her to it--all mute, but majestic.\r\n\r\n"Since that day I called S. to me in the schoolroom, and she came and\r\nsat so near my side; since she opened the trouble of her mind to me,\r\nasked my protection, appealed to my strength--since that hour I abhor\r\nSolitude. Cold abstraction, fleshless skeleton, daughter, mother, and\r\nmate of Death!\r\n\r\n"It is pleasant to write about what is near and dear as the core of my\r\nheart. None can deprive me of this little book, and through this pencil\r\nI can say to it what I will--say what I dare utter to nothing\r\nliving--say what I dare not _think_ aloud.\r\n\r\n"We have scarcely encountered each other since that evening. Once, when\r\nI was alone in the drawing-room, seeking a book of Henry\'s, she entered,\r\ndressed for a concert at Stilbro\'. Shyness--_her_ shyness, not\r\nmine--drew a silver veil between us. Much cant have I heard and read\r\nabout \'maiden modesty,\' but, properly used, and not hackneyed, the words\r\nare good and appropriate words. As she passed to the window, after\r\ntacitly but gracefully recognizing me, I could call her nothing in my\r\nown mind save \'stainless virgin.\' To my perception, a delicate\r\nsplendour robed her, and the modesty of girlhood was her halo. I may be\r\nthe most fatuous, as I am one of the plainest, of men, but in truth that\r\nshyness of hers touched me exquisitely; it flattered my finest\r\nsensations. I looked a stupid block, I dare say. I was alive with a life\r\nof Paradise, as she turned _her_ glance from _my_ glance, and softly\r\naverted her head to hide the suffusion of her cheek.\r\n\r\n"I know this is the talk of a dreamer--of a rapt, romantic lunatic. I\r\n_do_ dream. I _will_ dream now and then; and if she has inspired romance\r\ninto my prosaic composition, how can I help it?\r\n\r\n"What a child she is sometimes! What an unsophisticated, untaught thing!\r\nI see her now looking up into my face, and entreating me to prevent them\r\nfrom smothering her, and to be sure and give her a strong narcotic. I\r\nsee her confessing that she was not so self-sufficing, so independent of\r\nsympathy, as people thought. I see the secret tear drop quietly from her\r\neyelash. She said I thought her childish, and I did. She imagined I\r\ndespised her. Despised her! It was unutterably sweet to feel myself at\r\nonce near her and above her--to be conscious of a natural right and\r\npower to sustain her, as a husband should sustain his wife.\r\n\r\n"I worship her perfections; but it is her faults, or at least her\r\nfoibles, that bring her near to me, that nestle her to my heart, that\r\nfold her about with my love, and that for a most selfish but\r\ndeeply-natural reason. These faults are the steps by which I mount to\r\nascendency over her. If she rose a trimmed, artificial mound, without\r\ninequality, what vantage would she offer the foot? It is the natural\r\nhill, with its mossy breaks and hollows, whose slope invites ascent,\r\nwhose summit it is pleasure to gain.\r\n\r\n"To leave metaphor. It delights my eye to look on her. She suits me. If\r\nI were a king and she the housemaid that swept my palace-stairs, across\r\nall that space between us my eye would recognize her qualities; a true\r\npulse would beat for her in my heart, though an unspanned gulf made\r\nacquaintance impossible. If I were a gentleman, and she waited on me as\r\na servant, I could not help liking that Shirley. Take from her her\r\neducation; take her ornaments, her sumptuous dress, all extrinsic\r\nadvantages; take all grace, but such as the symmetry of her form renders\r\ninevitable; present her to me at a cottage door, in a stuff gown; let\r\nher offer me there a draught of water, with that smile, with that warm\r\ngood-will with which she now dispenses manorial hospitality--I should\r\nlike her. I should wish to stay an hour; I should linger to talk with\r\nthat rustic. I should not feel as I _now_ do; I should find in her\r\nnothing divine; but whenever I met the young peasant, it would be with\r\npleasure; whenever I left her, it would be with regret.\r\n\r\n"How culpably careless in her to leave her desk open, where I know she\r\nhas money! In the lock hang the keys of all her repositories, of her\r\nvery jewel-casket. There is a purse in that little satin bag; I see the\r\ntassel of silver beads hanging out. That spectacle would provoke my\r\nbrother Robert. All her little failings would, I know, be a source of\r\nirritation to him. If they vex me it is a most pleasurable vexation. I\r\ndelight to find her at fault; and were I always resident with her, I am\r\naware she would be no niggard in thus ministering to my enjoyment. She\r\nwould just give me something to do, to rectify--a theme for my tutor\r\nlectures. I never lecture Henry, never feel disposed to do so. If he\r\ndoes wrong--and that is very seldom, dear, excellent lad!--a word\r\nsuffices. Often I do no more than shake my head. But the moment her\r\n_minois mutin_ meets my eye, expostulatory words crowd to my lips. From\r\na taciturn man I believe she would transform me into a talker. Whence\r\ncomes the delight I take in that talk? It puzzles myself sometimes. The\r\nmore _cr\xc3\xa2ne, malin, taquin_ is her mood, consequently the clearer\r\noccasion she gives me for disapprobation, the more I seek her, the\r\nbetter I like her. She is never wilder than when equipped in her habit\r\nand hat, never less manageable than when she and Zo\xc3\xab come in fiery from\r\na race with the wind on the hills; and I confess it--to this mute page I\r\nmay confess it--I have waited an hour in the court for the chance of\r\nwitnessing her return, and for the dearer chance of receiving her in my\r\narms from the saddle. I have noticed (again it is to this page only I\r\nwould make the remark) that she will never permit any man but myself to\r\nrender her that assistance. I have seen her politely decline Sir Philip\r\nNunnely\'s aid. She is always mighty gentle with her young baronet,\r\nmighty tender for his feelings, forsooth, and of his very thin-skinned\r\n_amour propre_. I have marked her haughtily reject Sam Wynne\'s. Now I\r\nknow--my heart knows it, for it has felt it--that she resigns herself to\r\nme unreluctantly. Is she conscious how my strength rejoices to serve\r\nher? I myself am not her slave--I declare it--but my faculties gather\r\nto her beauty, like the genii to the glisten of the lamp. All my\r\nknowledge, all my prudence, all my calm, and all my power stand in her\r\npresence humbly waiting a task. How glad they are when a mandate comes!\r\nWhat joy they take in the toils she assigns! Does she know it?\r\n\r\n"I have called her careless. It is remarkable that her carelessness\r\nnever compromises her refinement. Indeed, through this very loophole of\r\ncharacter, the reality, depth, genuineness of that refinement may be\r\nascertained. A whole garment sometimes covers meagreness and\r\nmalformation; through a rent sleeve a fair round arm may be revealed. I\r\nhave seen and handled many of her possessions, because they are\r\nfrequently astray. I never saw anything that did not proclaim the\r\nlady--nothing sordid, nothing soiled. In one sense she is as scrupulous\r\nas, in another, she is unthinking. As a peasant girl, she would go ever\r\ntrim and cleanly. Look at the pure kid of this little glove, at the\r\nfresh, unsullied satin of the bag.\r\n\r\n"What a difference there is between S. and that pearl C. H.! Caroline, I\r\nfancy, is the soul of conscientious punctuality and nice exactitude. She\r\nwould precisely suit the domestic habits of a certain fastidious kinsman\r\nof mine--so delicate, dexterous, quaint, quick, quiet--all done to a\r\nminute, all arranged to a strawbreadth. She would suit Robert. But what\r\ncould _I_ do with anything so nearly faultless? _She_ is my equal, poor\r\nas myself. She is certainly pretty: a little Raffaelle head\r\nhers--Raffaelle in feature, quite English in expression, all insular\r\ngrace and purity; but where is there anything to alter, anything to\r\nendure, anything to reprimand, to be anxious about? There she is, a lily\r\nof the valley, untinted, needing no tint. What change could improve her?\r\nWhat pencil dare to paint? _My_ sweetheart, if I ever have one, must\r\nbear nearer affinity to the rose--a sweet, lively delight guarded with\r\nprickly peril. _My_ wife, if I ever marry, must stir my great frame with\r\na sting now and then; she must furnish use to her husband\'s vast mass of\r\npatience. I was not made so enduring to be mated with a lamb; I should\r\nfind more congenial responsibility in the charge of a young lioness or\r\nleopardess. I like few things sweet but what are likewise pungent--few\r\nthings bright but what are likewise hot. I like the summer day, whose\r\nsun makes fruit blush and corn blanch. Beauty is never so beautiful as\r\nwhen, if I tease it, it wreathes back on me with spirit. Fascination is\r\nnever so imperial as when, roused and half ireful, she threatens\r\ntransformation to fierceness. I fear I should tire of the mute,\r\nmonotonous innocence of the lamb; I should ere long feel as burdensome\r\nthe nestling dove which never stirred in my bosom; but my patience would\r\nexult in stilling the flutterings and training the energies of the\r\nrestless merlin. In managing the wild instincts of the scarce manageable\r\n_b\xc3\xaate fauve_ my powers would revel.\r\n\r\n"O my pupil! O Peri! too mutinous for heaven, too innocent for hell,\r\nnever shall I do more than see, and worship, and wish for thee. Alas!\r\nknowing I could make thee happy, will it be my doom to see thee\r\npossessed by those who have not that power?\r\n\r\n"However kindly the hand, if it is feeble, it cannot bend Shirley; and\r\nshe must be bent. It cannot curb her; and she must be curbed.\r\n\r\n"Beware, Sir Philip Nunnely! I never see you walking or sitting at her\r\nside, and observe her lips compressed, or her brow knit, in resolute\r\nendurance of some trait of your character which she neither admires nor\r\nlikes, in determined toleration of some weakness she believes atoned for\r\nby a virtue, but which annoys her despite that belief; I never mark the\r\ngrave glow of her face, the unsmiling sparkle of her eye, the slight\r\nrecoil of her whole frame when you draw a little too near, and gaze a\r\nlittle too expressively, and whisper a little too warmly--I never\r\nwitness these things but I think of the fable of Semele reversed.\r\n\r\n"It is not the daughter of Cadmus I see, nor do I realize her fatal\r\nlonging to look on Jove in the majesty of his god-head. It is a priest\r\nof Juno that stands before me, watching late and lone at a shrine in an\r\nArgive temple. For years of solitary ministry he has lived on dreams.\r\nThere is divine madness upon him. He loves the idol he serves, and prays\r\nday and night that his frenzy may be fed, and that the Ox-eyed may smile\r\non her votary. She has heard; she will be propitious. All Argos\r\nslumbers. The doors of the temple are shut; the priest waits at the\r\naltar.\r\n\r\n"A shock of heaven and earth is felt--not by the slumbering city, only\r\nby that lonely watcher, brave and unshaken in his fanaticism. In the\r\nmidst of silence, with no preluding sound, he is wrapped in sudden\r\nlight. Through the roof, through the rent, wide-yawning, vast,\r\nwhite-blazing blue of heaven above, pours a wondrous descent, dread as\r\nthe downrushing of stars. He has what he asked. Withdraw--forbear to\r\nlook--I am blinded. I hear in that fane an unspeakable sound. Would that\r\nI could not hear it! I see an insufferable glory burning terribly\r\nbetween the pillars. Gods be merciful and quench it!\r\n\r\n"A pious Argive enters to make an early offering in the cool dawn of\r\nmorning. There was thunder in the night; the bolt fell here. The shrine\r\nis shivered, the marble pavement round split and blackened. Saturnia\'s\r\nstatue rises chaste, grand, untouched; at her feet piled ashes lie pale.\r\nNo priest remains; he who watched will be seen no more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"There is the carriage! Let me lock up the desk and pocket the keys. She\r\nwill be seeking them to-morrow; she will have to come to me. I hear her:\r\n\'Mr. Moore, have you seen my keys?\'\r\n\r\n"So she will say, in her clear voice, speaking with reluctance, looking\r\nashamed, conscious that this is the twentieth time of asking. I will\r\ntantalize her, keep her with me, expecting, doubting; and when I _do_\r\nrestore them, it shall not be without a lecture. Here is the bag, too,\r\nand the purse; the glove--pen--seal. She shall wring them all out of me\r\nslowly and separately--only by confession, penitence, entreaty. I never\r\ncan touch her hand, or a ringlet of her head, or a ribbon of her dress,\r\nbut I will make privileges for myself. Every feature of her face, her\r\nbright eyes, her lips, shall go through each change they know, for my\r\npleasure--display each exquisite variety of glance and curve, to\r\ndelight, thrill, perhaps more hopelessly to enchain me. If I must be her\r\nslave, I will not lose my freedom for nothing."\r\n\r\nHe locked the desk, pocketed all the property, and went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nRUSHEDGE--A CONFESSIONAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nEverybody said it was high time for Mr. Moore to return home. All\r\nBriarfield wondered at his strange absence, and Whinbury and Nunnely\r\nbrought each its separate contribution of amazement.\r\n\r\nWas it known why he stayed away? Yes. It was known twenty--forty times\r\nover, there being at least forty plausible reasons adduced to account\r\nfor the unaccountable circumstance. Business it was not--_that_ the\r\ngossips agreed. He had achieved the business on which he departed long\r\nago. His four ringleaders he had soon scented out and run down. He had\r\nattended their trial, heard their conviction and sentence, and seen them\r\nsafely shipped prior to transportation.\r\n\r\nThis was known at Briarfield. The newspapers had reported it. The\r\n_Stilbro\' Courier_ had given every particular, with amplifications. None\r\napplauded his perseverance or hailed his success, though the mill-owners\r\nwere glad of it, trusting that the terrors of law vindicated would\r\nhenceforward paralyze the sinister valour of disaffection. Disaffection,\r\nhowever, was still heard muttering to himself. He swore ominous oaths\r\nover the drugged beer of alehouses, and drank strange toasts in fiery\r\nBritish gin.\r\n\r\nOne report affirmed that Moore _dared_ not come to Yorkshire; he knew\r\nhis life was not worth an hour\'s purchase if he did.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell him that," said Mr. Yorke, when his foreman mentioned the\r\nrumour; "and if _that_ does not bring him home full gallop, nothing\r\nwill."\r\n\r\nEither that or some other motive prevailed at last to recall him. He\r\nannounced to Joe Scott the day he should arrive at Stilbro\', desiring\r\nhis hackney to be sent to the George for his accommodation; and Joe\r\nScott having informed Mr. Yorke, that gentleman made it in his way to\r\nmeet him.\r\n\r\nIt was market-day. Moore arrived in time to take his usual place at the\r\nmarket dinner. As something of a stranger, and as a man of note and\r\naction, the assembled manufacturers received him with a certain\r\ndistinction. Some, who in public would scarcely have dared to\r\nacknowledge his acquaintance, lest a little of the hate and vengeance\r\nlaid up in store for him should perchance have fallen on them, in\r\nprivate hailed him as in some sort their champion. When the wine had\r\ncirculated, their respect would have kindled to enthusiasm had not\r\nMoore\'s unshaken nonchalance held it in a damp, low, smouldering state.\r\n\r\nMr. Yorke, the permanent president of these dinners, witnessed his young\r\nfriend\'s bearing with exceeding complacency. If one thing could stir his\r\ntemper or excite his contempt more than another, it was to see a man\r\nbefooled by flattery or elate with popularity. If one thing smoothed,\r\nsoothed, and charmed him especially, it was the spectacle of a public\r\ncharacter incapable of relishing his publicity--_incapable_, I say.\r\nDisdain would but have incensed; it was indifference that appeased his\r\nrough spirit.\r\n\r\nRobert, leaning back in his chair, quiet and almost surly, while the\r\nclothiers and blanket-makers vaunted his prowess and rehearsed his\r\ndeeds--many of them interspersing their flatteries with coarse\r\ninvectives against the operative class--was a delectable sight for Mr.\r\nYorke. His heart tingled with the pleasing conviction that these gross\r\neulogiums shamed Moore deeply, and made him half scorn himself and his\r\nwork. On abuse, on reproach, on calumny, it is easy to smile; but\r\npainful indeed is the panegyric of those we contemn. Often had Moore\r\ngazed with a brilliant countenance over howling crowds from a hostile\r\nhustings. He had breasted the storm of unpopularity with gallant bearing\r\nand soul elate; but he drooped his head under the half-bred tradesmen\'s\r\npraise, and shrank chagrined before their congratulations.\r\n\r\nYorke could not help asking him how he liked his supporters, and whether\r\nhe did not think they did honour to his cause. "But it is a pity, lad,"\r\nhe added, "that you did not hang these four samples of the unwashed. If\r\nyou had managed _that_ feat, the gentry here would have riven the horses\r\nout of the coach, yoked to a score of asses, and drawn you into Stilbro\'\r\nlike a conquering general."\r\n\r\nMoore soon forsook the wine, broke from the party, and took the road.\r\nIn less than five minutes Mr. Yorke followed him. They rode out of\r\nStilbro\' together.\r\n\r\nIt was early to go home, but yet it was late in the day. The last ray of\r\nthe sun had already faded from the cloud-edges, and the October night\r\nwas casting over the moorlands the shadow of her approach.\r\n\r\nMr. Yorke, moderately exhilarated with his moderate libations, and not\r\ndispleased to see young Moore again in Yorkshire, and to have him for\r\nhis comrade during the long ride home, took the discourse much to\r\nhimself. He touched briefly, but scoffingly, on the trials and the\r\nconviction; he passed thence to the gossip of the neighbourhood, and ere\r\nlong he attacked Moore on his own personal concerns.\r\n\r\n"Bob, I believe you are worsted, and you deserve it. All was smooth.\r\nFortune had fallen in love with you. She had decreed you the first prize\r\nin her wheel--twenty thousand pounds; she only required that you should\r\nhold your hand out and take it. And what did you do? You called for a\r\nhorse and rode a-hunting to Warwickshire. Your sweetheart--Fortune, I\r\nmean--was perfectly indulgent. She said, \'I\'ll excuse him; he\'s young.\'\r\nShe waited, like \'Patience on a monument,\' till the chase was over and\r\nthe vermin-prey run down. She expected you would come back then, and be\r\na good lad. You might still have had her first prize.\r\n\r\n"It capped her beyond expression, and me too, to find that, instead of\r\nthundering home in a breakneck gallop and laying your assize laurels at\r\nher feet, you coolly took coach up to London. What you have done there\r\nSatan knows; nothing in this world, I believe, but sat and sulked. Your\r\nface was never lily fair, but it is olive green now. You\'re not as bonny\r\nas you were, man."\r\n\r\n"And who is to have this prize you talk so much about?"\r\n\r\n"Only a baronet; that is all. I have not a doubt in my own mind you\'ve\r\nlost her. She will be Lady Nunnely before Christmas."\r\n\r\n"Hem! Quite probable."\r\n\r\n"But she need not to have been. Fool of a lad! I swear you might have\r\nhad her."\r\n\r\n"By what token, Mr. Yorke?"\r\n\r\n"By every token--by the light of her eyes, the red of her cheeks. Red\r\nthey grew when your name was mentioned, though of custom they are pale."\r\n\r\n"My chance is quite over, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"It ought to be. But try; it is worth trying. I call this Sir Philip\r\nmilk and water. And then he writes verses, they say--tags rhymes. _You_\r\nare above that, Bob, at all events."\r\n\r\n"Would you advise me to propose, late as it is, Mr. Yorke--at the\r\neleventh hour?"\r\n\r\n"You can but make the experiment, Robert. If she has a fancy for\r\nyou--and, on my conscience, I believe she has or had--she will forgive\r\nmuch. But, my lad, you are laughing. Is it at me? You had better grin at\r\nyour own perverseness. I see, however, you laugh at the wrong side of\r\nyour mouth. You have as sour a look at this moment as one need wish to\r\nsee."\r\n\r\n"I have so quarrelled with myself, Yorke. I have so kicked against the\r\npricks, and struggled in a strait waistcoat, and dislocated my wrists\r\nwith wrenching them in handcuffs, and battered my hard head by driving\r\nit against a harder wall."\r\n\r\n"Ha! I\'m glad to hear that. Sharp exercise yon! I hope it has done you\r\ngood--ta\'en some of the self-conceit out of you?"\r\n\r\n"Self-conceit? What is it? Self-respect, self-tolerance even, what are\r\nthey? Do you sell the articles? Do you know anybody who does? Give an\r\nindication. They would find in me a liberal chapman. I would part with\r\nmy last guinea this minute to buy."\r\n\r\n"Is it so with you, Robert? I find that spicy. I like a man to speak his\r\nmind. What has gone wrong?"\r\n\r\n"The machinery of all my nature; the whole enginery of this human mill;\r\nthe boiler, which I take to be the heart, is fit to burst."\r\n\r\n"That suld be putten i\' print; it\'s striking. It\'s almost blank verse.\r\nYe\'ll be jingling into poetry just e\'now. If the afflatus comes, give\r\nway, Robert. Never heed me; I\'ll bear it this whet [time]."\r\n\r\n"Hideous, abhorrent, base blunder! You may commit in a moment what you\r\nwill rue for years--what life cannot cancel."\r\n\r\n"Lad, go on. I call it pie, nuts, sugar-candy. I like the taste\r\nuncommonly. Go on. It will do you good to talk. The moor is before us\r\nnow, and there is no life for many a mile round."\r\n\r\n"I _will_ talk. I am not ashamed to tell. There is a sort of wild cat in\r\nmy breast, and I choose that you shall hear how it can yell."\r\n\r\n"To me it is music. What grand voices you and Louis have! When Louis\r\nsings--tones off like a soft, deep bell--I\'ve felt myself tremble again.\r\nThe night is still. It listens. It is just leaning down to you, like a\r\nblack priest to a blacker penitent. Confess, lad. Smooth naught down. Be\r\ncandid as a convicted, justified, sanctified Methody at an experience\r\nmeeting. Make yourself as wicked as Beelzebub. It will ease your mind."\r\n\r\n"As mean as Mammon, you would say. Yorke, if I got off horseback and\r\nlaid myself down across the road, would you have the goodness to gallop\r\nover me, backwards and forwards, about twenty times?"\r\n\r\n"Wi\' all the pleasure in life, if there were no such thing as a\r\ncoroner\'s inquest."\r\n\r\n"Hiram Yorke, I certainly believed she loved me. I have seen her eyes\r\nsparkle radiantly when she has found me out in a crowd; she has flushed\r\nup crimson when she has offered me her hand, and said, \'How do you do,\r\nMr. Moore?\'\r\n\r\n"My name had a magical influence over her. When others uttered it she\r\nchanged countenance--I know she did. She pronounced it herself in the\r\nmost musical of her many musical tones. She was cordial to me; she took\r\nan interest in me; she was anxious about me; she wished me well; she\r\nsought, she seized every opportunity to benefit me. I considered,\r\npaused, watched, weighed, wondered. I could come to but one\r\nconclusion--this is love.\r\n\r\n"I looked at her, Yorke. I saw in her youth and a species of beauty. I\r\nsaw power in her. Her wealth offered me the redemption of my honour and\r\nmy standing. I owed her gratitude. She had aided me substantially and\r\neffectually by a loan of five thousand pounds. Could I remember these\r\nthings? Could I believe she loved me? Could I hear wisdom urge me to\r\nmarry her, and disregard every dear advantage, disbelieve every\r\nflattering suggestion, disdain every well-weighed counsel, turn and\r\nleave her? Young, graceful, gracious--my benefactress, attached to me,\r\nenamoured of me. I used to say so to myself; dwell on the word; mouth it\r\nover and over again; swell over it with a pleasant, pompous complacency,\r\nwith an admiration dedicated entirely to myself, and unimpaired even by\r\nesteem for her; indeed I smiled in deep secrecy at her _na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9_ and\r\nsimplicity in being the first to love, and to show it. That whip of\r\nyours seems to have a good heavy handle, Yorke; you can swing it about\r\nyour head and knock me out of the saddle, if you choose. I should rather\r\nrelish a loundering whack."\r\n\r\n"Tak patience, Robert, till the moon rises and I can see you. Speak\r\nplain out--did you love her or not? I could like to know. I feel\r\ncurious."\r\n\r\n"Sir--sir--I say--she is very pretty, in her own style, and very\r\nattractive. She has a look, at times, of a thing made out of fire and\r\nair, at which I stand and marvel, without a thought of clasping and\r\nkissing it. I felt in her a powerful magnet to my interest and vanity. I\r\nnever felt as if nature meant her to be my other and better self. When a\r\nquestion on that head rushed upon me, I flung it off, saying brutally I\r\nshould be rich with her and ruined without her--vowing I would be\r\npractical, and not romantic."\r\n\r\n"A very sensible resolve. What mischief came of it, Bob?"\r\n\r\n"With this sensible resolve I walked up to Fieldhead one night last\r\nAugust. It was the very eve of my departure for Birmingham; for, you\r\nsee, I wanted to secure Fortune\'s splendid prize. I had previously\r\ndispatched a note requesting a private interview. I found her at home,\r\nand alone.\r\n\r\n"She received me without embarrassment, for she thought I came on\r\nbusiness. _I_ was embarrassed enough, but determined. I hardly know how\r\nI got the operation over; but I went to work in a hard, firm\r\nfashion--frightful enough, I dare say. I sternly offered myself--my fine\r\nperson--with my debts, of course, as a settlement.\r\n\r\n"It vexed me, it kindled my ire, to find that she neither blushed,\r\ntrembled, nor looked down. She responded, \'I doubt whether I have\r\nunderstood you, Mr. Moore.\'\r\n\r\n"And I had to go over the whole proposal twice, and word it as plainly\r\nas A B C, before she would fully take it in. And then, what did she do?\r\nInstead of faltering a sweet Yes, or maintaining a soft, confused\r\nsilence (which would have been as good), she started up, walked twice\r\nfast through the room, in the way that _she_ only does, and no other\r\nwoman, and ejaculated, \'God bless me!\'\r\n\r\n"Yorke, I stood on the hearth, backed by the mantelpiece; against it I\r\nleaned, and prepared for anything--everything. I knew my doom, and I\r\nknew myself. There was no misunderstanding her aspect and voice. She\r\nstopped and looked at me.\r\n\r\n"\'God bless me!\' she piteously repeated, in that shocked, indignant, yet\r\nsaddened accent. \'You have made a strange proposal--strange from _you_;\r\nand if you knew how strangely you worded it and looked it, you would be\r\nstartled at yourself. You spoke like a brigand who demanded my purse\r\nrather than like a lover who asked my heart.\'\r\n\r\n"A queer sentence, was it not, Yorke? And I knew, as she uttered it, it\r\nwas true as queer. Her words were a mirror in which I saw myself.\r\n\r\n"I looked at her, dumb and wolfish. She at once enraged and shamed me.\r\n\r\n"\'G\xc3\xa9rard Moore, you know you don\'t love Shirley Keeldar.\' I might have\r\nbroken out into false swearing--vowed that I did love her; but I could\r\nnot lie in her pure face. I could not perjure myself in her truthful\r\npresence. Besides, such hollow oaths would have been vain as void. She\r\nwould no more have believed me than she would have believed the ghost of\r\nJudas, had he broken from the night and stood before her. Her female\r\nheart had finer perceptions than to be cheated into mistaking my\r\nhalf-coarse, half-cold admiration for true-throbbing, manly love.\r\n\r\n"What next happened? you will say, Mr. Yorke.\r\n\r\n"Why, she sat down in the window-seat and cried. She cried passionately.\r\nHer eyes not only rained but lightened. They flashed, open, large, dark,\r\nhaughty, upon me. They said, \'You have pained me; you have outraged me;\r\nyou have deceived me.\'\r\n\r\n"She added words soon to looks.\r\n\r\n"\'I _did_ respect--I _did_ admire--I _did_ like you,\' she said--\'yes, as\r\nmuch as if you were my brother; and _you--you_ want to make a\r\nspeculation of me. You would immolate me to that mill, your Moloch!\'\r\n\r\n"I had the common sense to abstain from any word of excuse, any attempt\r\nat palliation. I stood to be scorned.\r\n\r\n"Sold to the devil for the time being, I was certainly infatuated. When\r\nI did speak, what do you think I said?\r\n\r\n"\'Whatever my own feelings were, I was persuaded _you_ loved _me_, Miss\r\nKeeldar.\'\r\n\r\n"Beautiful, was it not? She sat quite confounded. \'Is it Robert Moore\r\nthat speaks?\' I heard her mutter. \'Is it a man--or something lower?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Do you mean,\' she asked aloud--\'do you mean you thought I loved you as\r\nwe love those we wish to marry?\'\r\n\r\n"It _was_ my meaning, and I said so.\r\n\r\n"\'You conceived an idea obnoxious to a woman\'s feelings,\' was her\r\nanswer. \'You have announced it in a fashion revolting to a woman\'s soul.\r\nYou insinuate that all the frank kindness I have shown you has been a\r\ncomplicated, a bold, and an immodest man\xc5\x93uvre to ensnare a husband. You\r\nimply that at last you come here out of pity to offer me your hand,\r\nbecause I have courted you. Let me say this: Your sight is jaundiced;\r\nyou have seen wrong. Your mind is warped; you have judged wrong. Your\r\ntongue betrays you; you now speak wrong. I never loved you. Be at rest\r\nthere. My heart is as pure of passion for you as yours is barren of\r\naffection for me.\'\r\n\r\n"I hope I was answered, Yorke?\r\n\r\n"\'I seem to be a blind, besotted sort of person,\' was my remark.\r\n\r\n"\'_Loved_ you!\' she cried. \'Why, I have been as frank with you as a\r\nsister--never shunned you, never feared you. You cannot,\' she affirmed\r\ntriumphantly--\'you cannot make me tremble with your coming, nor\r\naccelerate my pulse by your influence.\'\r\n\r\n"I alleged that often, when she spoke to me, she blushed, and that the\r\nsound of my name moved her.\r\n\r\n"\'Not for _your_ sake!\' she declared briefly. I urged explanation, but\r\ncould get none.\r\n\r\n"\'When I sat beside you at the school feast, did you think I loved you\r\nthen? When I stopped you in Maythorn Lane, did you think I loved you\r\nthen? When I called on you in the counting-house, when I walked with you\r\non the pavement, did you think I loved you then?\'\r\n\r\n"So she questioned me; and I said I did.\r\n\r\n"By the Lord! Yorke, she rose, she grew tall, she expanded and refined\r\nalmost to flame. There was a trembling all through her, as in live coal\r\nwhen its vivid vermilion is hottest.\r\n\r\n"\'That is to say that you have the worst opinion of me; that you deny me\r\nthe possession of all I value most. That is to say that I am a traitor\r\nto all my sisters; that I have acted as no woman can act without\r\ndegrading herself and her sex; that I have sought where the incorrupt of\r\nmy kind naturally scorn and abhor to seek.\' She and I were silent for\r\nmany a minute. \'Lucifer, Star of the Morning,\' she went on, \'thou art\r\nfallen! You, once high in my esteem, are hurled down; you, once intimate\r\nin my friendship, are cast out. Go!\'\r\n\r\n"I went not. I had heard her voice tremble, seen her lip quiver. I knew\r\nanother storm of tears would fall, and then I believed some calm and\r\nsome sunshine must come, and I would wait for it.\r\n\r\n"As fast, but more quietly than before, the warm rain streamed down.\r\nThere was another sound in her weeping--a softer, more regretful sound.\r\nWhile I watched, her eyes lifted to me a gaze more reproachful than\r\nhaughty, more mournful than incensed.\r\n\r\n"\'O Moore!\' said she. It was worse than \'Et tu, Brute!\'\r\n\r\n"I relieved myself by what should have been a sigh, but it became a\r\ngroan. A sense of Cain-like desolation made my breast ache.\r\n\r\n"\'There has been error in what I have done,\' I said, \'and it has won me\r\nbitter wages, which I will go and spend far from her who gave them.\'\r\n\r\n"I took my hat. All the time I could not have borne to depart so, and I\r\nbelieved she would not let me. Nor would she but for the mortal pang I\r\nhad given her pride, that cowed her compassion and kept her silent.\r\n\r\n"I was obliged to turn back of my own accord when I reached the door, to\r\napproach her, and to say, \'Forgive me.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I could, if there was not myself to forgive too,\' was her reply; \'but\r\nto mislead a sagacious man so far I must have done wrong.\'\r\n\r\n"I broke out suddenly with some declamation I do not remember. I know\r\nthat it was sincere, and that my wish and aim were to absolve her to\r\nherself. In fact, in her case self-accusation was a chimera.\r\n\r\n"At last she extended her hand. For the first time I wished to take her\r\nin my arms and kiss her. I _did_ kiss her hand many times.\r\n\r\n"\'Some day we shall be friends again,\' she said, \'when you have had time\r\nto read my actions and motives in a true light, and not so horribly to\r\nmisinterpret them. Time may give you the right key to all. Then,\r\nperhaps, you will comprehend me, and then we shall be reconciled.\'\r\n\r\n"Farewell drops rolled slow down her cheeks. She wiped them away.\r\n\r\n"\'I am sorry for what has happened--deeply sorry,\' she sobbed. So was I,\r\nGod knows! Thus were we severed."\r\n\r\n"A queer tale!" commented Mr. Yorke.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do it no more," vowed his companion; "never more will I mention\r\nmarriage to a woman unless I feel love. Henceforth credit and commerce\r\nmay take care of themselves. Bankruptcy may come when it lists. I have\r\ndone with slavish fear of disaster. I mean to work diligently, wait\r\npatiently, bear steadily. Let the worst come, I will take my axe and an\r\nemigrant\'s berth, and go out with Louis to the West; he and I have\r\nsettled it. No woman shall ever again look at me as Miss Keeldar looked,\r\never again feel towards me as Miss Keeldar felt. In no woman\'s presence\r\nwill I ever again stand at once such a fool and such a knave, such a\r\nbrute and such a puppy."\r\n\r\n"Tut!" said the imperturbable Yorke, "you make too much of it; but\r\nstill, I say, I am capped. Firstly, that she did not love you; and\r\nsecondly, that you did not love her. You are both young; you are both\r\nhandsome; you are both well enough for wit and even for temper--take you\r\non the right side. What ailed you that you could not agree?"\r\n\r\n"We never _have_ been, never _could_ be _at home_ with each other,\r\nYorke. Admire each other as we might at a distance, still we jarred when\r\nwe came very near. I have sat at one side of a room and observed her at\r\nthe other, perhaps in an excited, genial moment, when she had some of\r\nher favourites round her--her old beaux, for instance, yourself and\r\nHelstone, with whom she is so playful, pleasant, and eloquent. I have\r\nwatched her when she was most natural, most lively, and most lovely; my\r\njudgment has pronounced her beautiful. Beautiful she is at times, when\r\nher mood and her array partake of the splendid. I have drawn a little\r\nnearer, feeling that our terms of acquaintance gave me the right of\r\napproach. I have joined the circle round her seat, caught her eye, and\r\nmastered her attention; then we have conversed; and others, thinking me,\r\nperhaps, peculiarly privileged, have withdrawn by degrees, and left us\r\nalone. Were we happy thus left? For myself, I must say No. Always a\r\nfeeling of constraint came over me; always I was disposed to be stern\r\nand strange. We talked politics and business. No soft sense of domestic\r\nintimacy ever opened our hearts, or thawed our language and made it flow\r\neasy and limpid. If we had confidences, they were confidences of the\r\ncounting-house, not of the heart. Nothing in her cherished affection in\r\nme, made me better, gentler; she only stirred my brain and whetted my\r\nacuteness. She never crept into my heart or influenced its pulse; and\r\nfor this good reason, no doubt, because I had not the secret of making\r\nher love me."\r\n\r\n"Well, lad, it is a queer thing. I might laugh at thee, and reckon to\r\ndespise thy refinements; but as it is dark night and we are by\r\nourselves, I don\'t mind telling thee that thy talk brings back a glimpse\r\nof my own past life. Twenty-five years ago I tried to persuade a\r\nbeautiful woman to love me, and she would not. I had not the key to her\r\nnature; she was a stone wall to me, doorless and windowless."\r\n\r\n"But you loved _her_, Yorke; you worshipped Mary Cave. Your conduct,\r\nafter all, was that of a man--never of a fortune-hunter."\r\n\r\n"Ay, I _did_ love her; but then she was beautiful as the moon we do\r\n_not_ see to-night. There is naught like her in these days. Miss\r\nHelstone, maybe, has a look of her, but nobody else."\r\n\r\n"Who has a look of her?"\r\n\r\n"That black-coated tyrant\'s niece--that quiet, delicate Miss Helstone.\r\nMany a time I have put on my spectacles to look at the lassie in church,\r\nbecause she has gentle blue een, wi\' long lashes; and when she sits in\r\nshadow, and is very still and very pale, and is, happen, about to fall\r\nasleep wi\' the length of the sermon and the heat of the biggin\', she is\r\nas like one of Canova\'s marbles as aught else."\r\n\r\n"Was Mary Cave in that style?"\r\n\r\n"Far grander!--less lass-like and flesh-like. You wondered why she\r\nhadn\'t wings and a crown. She was a stately, peaceful angel was my\r\nMary."\r\n\r\n"And you could not persuade her to love you?"\r\n\r\n"Not with all I could do, though I prayed Heaven many a time, on my\r\nbended knees, to help me."\r\n\r\n"Mary Cave was not what you think her, Yorke. I have seen her picture at\r\nthe rectory. She is no angel, but a fair, regular-featured,\r\ntaciturn-looking woman--rather too white and lifeless for my taste. But,\r\nsupposing she had been something better than she was----"\r\n\r\n"Robert," interrupted Yorke, "I could fell you off your horse at this\r\nmoment. However, I\'ll hold my hand. Reason tells me you are right and I\r\nam wrong. I know well enough that the passion I still have is only the\r\nremnant of an illusion. If Miss Cave had possessed either feeling or\r\nsense, she could not have been so perfectly impassible to my regard as\r\nshe showed herself; she must have preferred me to that copper-faced\r\ndespot."\r\n\r\n"Supposing, Yorke, she had been educated (no women were educated in\r\nthose days); supposing she had possessed a thoughtful, original mind, a\r\nlove of knowledge, a wish for information, which she took an artless\r\ndelight in receiving from your lips, and having measured out to her by\r\nyour hand; supposing her conversation, when she sat at your side, was\r\nfertile, varied, imbued with a picturesque grace and genial interest,\r\nquiet flowing but clear and bounteous; supposing that when you stood\r\nnear her by chance, or when you sat near her by design, comfort at once\r\nbecame your atmosphere, and content your element; supposing that\r\nwhenever her face was under your gaze, or her idea filled your thoughts,\r\nyou gradually ceased to be hard and anxious, and pure affection, love of\r\nhome, thirst for sweet discourse, unselfish longing to protect and\r\ncherish, replaced the sordid, cankering calculations of your trade;\r\nsupposing, with all this, that many a time, when you had been so happy\r\nas to possess your Mary\'s little hand, you had felt it tremble as you\r\nheld it, just as a warm little bird trembles when you take it from its\r\nnest; supposing you had noticed her shrink into the background on your\r\nentrance into a room, yet if you sought her in her retreat she welcomed\r\nyou with the sweetest smile that ever lit a fair virgin face, and only\r\nturned her eyes from the encounter of your own lest their clearness\r\nshould reveal too much; supposing, in short, your Mary had been not\r\ncold, but modest; not vacant, but reflective; not obtuse, but sensitive;\r\nnot inane, but innocent; not prudish, but pure,--would you have left her\r\nto court another woman for her wealth?"\r\n\r\nMr. Yorke raised his hat, wiped his forehead with his handkerchief.\r\n\r\n"The moon is up," was his first not quite relevant remark, pointing with\r\nhis whip across the moor. "There she is, rising into the haze, staring\r\nat us wi\' a strange red glower. She is no more silver than old\r\nHelstone\'s brow is ivory. What does she mean by leaning her cheek on\r\nRushedge i\' that way, and looking at us wi\' a scowl and a menace?"\r\n\r\n"Yorke, if Mary had loved you silently yet faithfully, chastely yet\r\nfervently, as you would wish your wife to love, would you have left\r\nher?"\r\n\r\n"Robert!"--he lifted his arm, he held it suspended, and paused--"Robert!\r\nthis is a queer world, and men are made of the queerest dregs that\r\nChaos churned up in her ferment. I might swear sounding oaths--oaths\r\nthat would make the poachers think there was a bittern booming in\r\nBilberry Moss--that, in the case you put, death only should have parted\r\nme from Mary. But I have lived in the world fifty-five years; I have\r\nbeen forced to study human nature; and, to speak a dark truth, the odds\r\nare, if Mary had loved and not scorned me, if I had been secure of her\r\naffection, certain of her constancy, been irritated by no doubts, stung\r\nby no humiliations--the odds are" (he let his hand fall heavy on the\r\nsaddle)--"the odds are I should have left her!"\r\n\r\nThey rode side by side in silence. Ere either spoke again they were on\r\nthe other side of Rushedge. Briarfield lights starred the purple skirt\r\nof the moor. Robert, being the youngest, and having less of the past to\r\nabsorb him than his comrade, recommenced first.\r\n\r\n"I believe--I daily find it proved--that we can get nothing in this\r\nworld worth keeping, not so much as a principle or a conviction, except\r\nout of purifying flame or through strengthening peril. We err, we fall,\r\nwe are humbled; then we walk more carefully. We greedily eat and drink\r\npoison out of the gilded cup of vice or from the beggar\'s wallet of\r\navarice. We are sickened, degraded; everything good in us rebels against\r\nus; our souls rise bitterly indignant against our bodies; there is a\r\nperiod of civil war; if the soul has strength, it conquers and rules\r\nthereafter."\r\n\r\n"What art thou going to do now, Robert? What are thy plans?"\r\n\r\n"For my private plans, I\'ll keep them to myself--which is very easy, as\r\nat present I have none. No private life is permitted a man in my\r\nposition--a man in debt. For my public plans, my views are a little\r\naltered. While I was in Birmingham I looked a little into reality,\r\nconsidered closely and at their source the causes of the present\r\ntroubles of this country. I did the same in London. Unknown, I could go\r\nwhere I pleased, mix with whom I would. I went where there was want of\r\nfood, of fuel, of clothing; where there was no occupation and no hope. I\r\nsaw some, with naturally elevated tendencies and good feelings, kept\r\ndown amongst sordid privations and harassing griefs. I saw many\r\noriginally low, and to whom lack of education left scarcely anything but\r\nanimal wants, disappointed in those wants, ahungered, athirst, and\r\ndesperate as famished animals. I saw what taught my brain a new lesson,\r\nand filled my breast with fresh feelings. I have no intention to profess\r\nmore softness or sentiment than I have hitherto professed; mutiny and\r\nambition I regard as I have always regarded them. I should resist a\r\nriotous mob just as heretofore; I should open on the scent of a runaway\r\nringleader as eagerly as ever, and run him down as relentlessly, and\r\nfollow him up to condign punishment as rigorously; but I should do it\r\nnow chiefly for the sake and the security of those he misled. Something\r\nthere is to look to, Yorke, beyond a man\'s personal interest, beyond the\r\nadvancement of well-laid schemes, beyond even the discharge of\r\ndishonouring debts. To respect himself, a man must believe he renders\r\njustice to his fellow-men. Unless I am more considerate to ignorance,\r\nmore forbearing to suffering, than I have hitherto been, I shall scorn\r\nmyself as grossly unjust.--What now?" he said, addressing his horse,\r\nwhich, hearing the ripple of water, and feeling thirsty, turned to a\r\nwayside trough, where the moonbeam was playing in a crystal eddy.\r\n\r\n"Yorke," pursued Moore, "ride on; I must let him drink."\r\n\r\nYorke accordingly rode slowly forwards, occupying himself as he advanced\r\nin discriminating, amongst the many lights now spangling the distance,\r\nthose of Briarmains. Stilbro\' Moor was left behind; plantations rose\r\ndusk on either hand; they were descending the hill; below them lay the\r\nvalley with its populous parish: they felt already at home.\r\n\r\nSurrounded no longer by heath, it was not startling to Mr. Yorke to see\r\na hat rise, and to hear a voice speak behind the wall. The words,\r\nhowever, were peculiar.\r\n\r\n"When the wicked perisheth there is shouting," it said; and added, "As\r\nthe whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more" (with a deeper growl):\r\n"terrors take hold of him as waters; hell is naked before him. He shall\r\ndie without knowledge."\r\n\r\nA fierce flash and sharp crack violated the calm of night. Yorke, ere he\r\nturned, knew the four convicts of Birmingham were avenged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nUNCLE AND NIECE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe die was cast. Sir Philip Nunnely knew it; Shirley knew it; Mr.\r\nSympson knew it. That evening, when all the Fieldhead family dined at\r\nNunnely Priory, decided the business.\r\n\r\nTwo or three things conduced to bring the baronet to a point. He had\r\nobserved that Miss Keeldar looked pensive and delicate. This new phase\r\nin her demeanour smote him on his weak or poetic side. A spontaneous\r\nsonnet brewed in his brain; and while it was still working there, one of\r\nhis sisters persuaded his lady-love to sit down to the piano and sing a\r\nballad--one of Sir Philip\'s own ballads. It was the least elaborate, the\r\nleast affected--out of all comparison the best of his numerous efforts.\r\n\r\nIt chanced that Shirley, the moment before, had been gazing from a\r\nwindow down on the park. She had seen that stormy moonlight which "le\r\nProfesseur Louis" was perhaps at the same instant contemplating from her\r\nown oak-parlour lattice; she had seen the isolated trees of the\r\ndomain--broad, strong, spreading oaks, and high-towering heroic\r\nbeeches--wrestling with the gale. Her ear had caught the full roar of\r\nthe forest lower down; the swift rushing of clouds, the moon, to the\r\neye, hasting swifter still, had crossed her vision. She turned from\r\nsight and sound--touched, if not rapt; wakened, if not inspired.\r\n\r\nShe sang, as requested. There was much about love in the\r\nballad--faithful love that refused to abandon its object; love that\r\ndisaster could not shake; love that in calamity waxed fonder, in poverty\r\nclung closer. The words were set to a fine old air; in themselves they\r\nwere simple and sweet. Perhaps, when read, they wanted force; when\r\n_well_ sung, they wanted nothing. Shirley sang them well. She breathed\r\ninto the feeling softness; she poured round the passion force. Her voice\r\nwas fine that evening, its expression dramatic. She impressed all, and\r\ncharmed one.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the instrument she went to the fire, and sat down on a\r\nseat--semi-stool, semi-cushion. The ladies were round her; none of them\r\nspoke. The Misses Sympson and the Misses Nunnely looked upon her as\r\nquiet poultry might look on an egret, an ibis, or any other strange\r\nfowl. What made her sing so? _They_ never sang so. Was it _proper_ to\r\nsing with such expression, with such originality--so unlike a\r\nschool-girl? Decidedly not. It was strange, it was unusual. What was\r\n_strange_ must be _wrong_; what was _unusual_ must be _improper_.\r\nShirley was judged.\r\n\r\nMoreover, old Lady Nunnely eyed her stonily from her great chair by the\r\nfireside. Her gaze said, "This woman is not of mine or my daughters\'\r\nkind. I object to her as my son\'s wife."\r\n\r\nHer son, catching the look, read its meaning. He grew alarmed. What he\r\nso wished to win there was danger he might lose. He must make haste.\r\n\r\nThe room they were in had once been a picture-gallery. Sir Philip\'s\r\nfather--Sir Monckton--had converted it into a saloon; but still it had a\r\nshadowy, long-withdrawing look. A deep recess with a window--a recess\r\nthat held one couch, one table, and a fairy cabinet--formed a room\r\nwithin a room. Two persons standing there might interchange a dialogue,\r\nand, so it were neither long nor loud, none be the wiser.\r\n\r\nSir Philip induced two of his sisters to perpetrate a duet. He gave\r\noccupation to the Misses Sympson. The elder ladies were conversing\r\ntogether. He was pleased to remark that meantime Shirley rose to look at\r\nthe pictures. He had a tale to tell about one ancestress, whose dark\r\nbeauty seemed as that of a flower of the south. He joined her, and began\r\nto tell it.\r\n\r\nThere were mementoes of the same lady in the cabinet adorning the\r\nrecess; and while Shirley was stooping to examine the missal and the\r\nrosary on the inlaid shelf, and while the Misses Nunnely indulged in a\r\nprolonged screech, guiltless of expression, pure of originality,\r\nperfectly conventional and absolutely unmeaning, Sir Philip stooped too,\r\nand whispered a few hurried sentences. At first Miss Keeldar was struck\r\nso still you might have fancied that whisper a charm which had changed\r\nher to a statue; but she presently looked up and answered. They parted.\r\nMiss Keeldar returned to the fire, and resumed her seat. The baronet\r\ngazed after her, then went and stood behind his sisters. Mr.\r\nSympson--Mr. Sympson only--had marked the pantomime.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman drew his own conclusions. Had he been as acute as he was\r\nmeddling, as profound as he was prying, he might have found that in Sir\r\nPhilip\'s face whereby to correct his inference. Ever shallow, hasty, and\r\npositive, he went home quite cock-a-hoop.\r\n\r\nHe was not a man that kept secrets well. When elate on a subject, he\r\ncould not avoid talking about it. The next morning, having occasion to\r\nemploy his son\'s tutor as his secretary, he must needs announce to him,\r\nin mouthing accents, and with much flimsy pomp of manner, that he had\r\nbetter hold himself prepared for a return to the south at an early day,\r\nas the important business which had detained him (Mr. Sympson) so long\r\nin Yorkshire was now on the eve of fortunate completion. His anxious and\r\nlaborious efforts were likely, at last, to be crowned with the happiest\r\nsuccess. A truly eligible addition was about to be made to the family\r\nconnections.\r\n\r\n"In Sir Philip Nunnely?" Louis Moore conjectured.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Mr. Sympson treated himself simultaneously to a pinch of snuff\r\nand a chuckling laugh, checked only by a sudden choke of dignity, and an\r\norder to the tutor to proceed with business.\r\n\r\nFor a day or two Mr. Sympson continued as bland as oil, but also he\r\nseemed to sit on pins, and his gait, when he walked, emulated that of a\r\nhen treading a hot girdle. He was for ever looking out of the window and\r\nlistening for chariot-wheels. Bluebeard\'s wife--Sisera\'s mother--were\r\nnothing to him. He waited when the matter should be opened in form, when\r\nhimself should be consulted, when lawyers should be summoned, when\r\nsettlement discussions and all the delicious worldly fuss should\r\npompously begin.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a letter. He himself handed it to Miss Keeldar out of\r\nthe bag. He knew the handwriting; he knew the crest on the seal. He did\r\nnot see it opened and read, for Shirley took it to her own room; nor did\r\nhe see it answered, for she wrote her reply shut up, and was very long\r\nabout it--the best part of a day. He questioned her whether it was\r\nanswered; she responded, "Yes."\r\n\r\nAgain he waited--waited in silence, absolutely not daring to speak, kept\r\nmute by something in Shirley\'s face--a very awful something--inscrutable\r\nto him as the writing on the wall to Belshazzar. He was moved more than\r\nonce to call Daniel, in the person of Louis Moore, and to ask an\r\ninterpretation; but his dignity forbade the familiarity. Daniel himself,\r\nperhaps, had his own private difficulties connected with that baffling\r\nbit of translation; he looked like a student for whom grammars are blank\r\nand dictionaries dumb.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Sympson had been out, to while away an anxious hour in the society\r\nof his friends at De Walden Hall. He returned a little sooner than was\r\nexpected. His family and Miss Keeldar were assembled in the oak parlour.\r\nAddressing the latter, he requested her to step with him into another\r\nroom. He wished to have with her a "_strictly_ private interview."\r\n\r\nShe rose, asking no questions and professing no surprise.\r\n\r\n"Very well, sir," she said, in the tone of a determined person who is\r\ninformed that the dentist is come to extract that large double tooth of\r\nhis, from which he has suffered such a purgatory this month past. She\r\nleft her sewing and her thimble in the window-seat, and followed her\r\nuncle where he led.\r\n\r\nShut into the drawing-room, the pair took seats, each in an arm-chair,\r\nplaced opposite, a few yards between them.\r\n\r\n"I have been to De Walden Hall," said Mr. Sympson. He paused. Miss\r\nKeeldar\'s eyes were on the pretty white-and-green carpet. _That_\r\ninformation required no response. She gave none.\r\n\r\n"I have learned," he went on slowly--"I have learned a circumstance\r\nwhich surprises me."\r\n\r\nResting her cheek on her forefinger, she waited to be told _what_\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\n"It seems that Nunnely Priory is shut up--that the family are gone back\r\nto their place in ----shire. It seems that the baronet--that the\r\nbaronet--that Sir Philip himself has accompanied his mother and\r\nsisters."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said Shirley.\r\n\r\n"May I ask if you share the amazement with which I received this news?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"_Is_ it news to you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"I mean--I mean," pursued Mr. Sympson, now fidgeting in his chair,\r\nquitting his hitherto brief and tolerably clear phraseology, and\r\nreturning to his customary wordy, confused, irritable style--"I mean to\r\nhave a _thorough_ explanation. I will _not_ be put off. I--I--shall\r\n_insist_ on being heard, and on--on having my own way. My questions\r\n_must_ be answered. I will have clear, satisfactory replies. I am not to\r\nbe trifled with. (Silence.)\r\n\r\n"It is a strange and an extraordinary thing--a very singular--a most odd\r\nthing! I thought all was right, knew no other; and there--the family are\r\ngone!"\r\n\r\n"I suppose, sir, they had a right to go."\r\n\r\n"_Sir Philip is gone!_" (with emphasis).\r\n\r\nShirley raised her brows. "_Bon voyage!_" said she.\r\n\r\n"This will not do; this must be altered, ma\'am."\r\n\r\nHe drew his chair forward; he pushed it back; he looked perfectly\r\nincensed, and perfectly helpless.\r\n\r\n"Come, come now, uncle," expostulated Shirley, "do not begin to fret and\r\nfume, or we shall make no sense of the business. Ask me what you want to\r\nknow. I am as willing to come to an explanation as you. I promise you\r\ntruthful replies."\r\n\r\n"I want--I demand to know, Miss Keeldar, whether Sir Philip has made you\r\nan offer?"\r\n\r\n"He has."\r\n\r\n"You avow it?"\r\n\r\n"I avow it. But now, go on. Consider that point settled."\r\n\r\n"He made you an offer that night we dined at the priory?"\r\n\r\n"It is enough to say that he made it. Go on."\r\n\r\n"He proposed in the recess--in the room that used to be a\r\npicture-gallery--that Sir Monckton converted into it saloon?"\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n"You were both examining a cabinet. I saw it all. My sagacity was not at\r\nfault--it never is. Subsequently you received a letter from him. On what\r\nsubject--of what nature were the contents?"\r\n\r\n"No matter."\r\n\r\n"Ma\'am, is that the way in which you speak to me?"\r\n\r\nShirley\'s foot tapped quick on the carpet.\r\n\r\n"There you sit, silent and sullen--_you_ who promised truthful replies."\r\n\r\n"Sir, I have answered you thus far. Proceed."\r\n\r\n"I should like to see that letter."\r\n\r\n"You _cannot_ see it."\r\n\r\n"I _must_ and _shall_, ma\'am; I am your guardian."\r\n\r\n"Having ceased to be a ward, I have no guardian."\r\n\r\n"Ungrateful being! Reared by me as my own daughter----"\r\n\r\n"Once more, uncle, have the kindness to keep to the point. Let us both\r\nremain cool. For my part, I do not wish to get into a passion; but, you\r\nknow, once drive me beyond certain bounds, I care little what I say--I\r\nam not then soon checked. Listen! You have asked me whether Sir Philip\r\nmade me an offer. That question is answered. What do you wish to know\r\nnext?"\r\n\r\n"I desire to know whether you accepted or refused him, and know it I\r\nwill."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, you ought to know it. I refused him."\r\n\r\n"Refused him! You--_you_, Shirley Keeldar, _refused_ Sir Philip\r\nNunnely?"\r\n\r\n"I did."\r\n\r\nThe poor gentleman bounced from his chair, and first rushed and then\r\ntrotted through the room.\r\n\r\n"There it is! There it is! There it is!"\r\n\r\n"Sincerely speaking, I am sorry, uncle, you are so disappointed."\r\n\r\nConcession, contrition, never do any good with some people. Instead of\r\nsoftening and conciliating, they but embolden and harden them. Of that\r\nnumber was Mr. Sympson.\r\n\r\n"_I_ disappointed? What is it to me? Have _I_ an interest in it? You\r\nwould insinuate, perhaps, that I have motives?"\r\n\r\n"Most people have motives of some sort for their actions."\r\n\r\n"She accuses me to my face! I, that have been a parent to her, she\r\ncharges with bad motives!"\r\n\r\n"_Bad_ motives I did not say."\r\n\r\n"And now you prevaricate; you have no principles!"\r\n\r\n"Uncle, you tire me. I want to go away."\r\n\r\n"Go you shall not! I will be answered. What are your intentions, Miss\r\nKeeldar?"\r\n\r\n"In what respect?"\r\n\r\n"In respect of matrimony?"\r\n\r\n"To be quiet, and to do just as I please."\r\n\r\n"Just as you please! The words are to the last degree indecorous."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Sympson, I advise you not to become insulting. You know I will not\r\nbear that."\r\n\r\n"You read French. Your mind is poisoned with French novels. You have\r\nimbibed French principles."\r\n\r\n"The ground you are treading now returns a mighty hollow sound under\r\nyour feet. Beware!"\r\n\r\n"It will end in infamy, sooner or later. I have foreseen it all along."\r\n\r\n"Do you assert, sir, that something in which _I_ am concerned will end\r\nin infamy?"\r\n\r\n"That it will--that it will. You said just now you would act as you\r\nplease. You acknowledge no rules--no limitations."\r\n\r\n"Silly stuff, and vulgar as silly!"\r\n\r\n"Regardless of decorum, you are prepared to fly in the face of\r\npropriety."\r\n\r\n"You tire me, uncle."\r\n\r\n"What, madam--_what_ could be your reasons for refusing Sir Philip?"\r\n\r\n"At last there is another sensible question; I shall be glad to reply to\r\nit. Sir Philip is too young for me. I regard him as a boy. All his\r\nrelations--his mother especially--would be annoyed if he married me.\r\nSuch a step would embroil him with them. I am not his equal in the\r\nworld\'s estimation."\r\n\r\n"Is that all?"\r\n\r\n"Our dispositions are not compatible."\r\n\r\n"Why, a more amiable gentleman never breathed."\r\n\r\n"He is very amiable--very excellent--truly estimable; but _not my\r\nmaster_--not in one point. I could not trust myself with his happiness.\r\nI would not undertake the keeping of it for thousands. I will accept no\r\nhand which cannot hold me in check."\r\n\r\n"I thought you liked to do as you please. You are vastly inconsistent."\r\n\r\n"When I promise to obey, it shall be under the conviction that I can\r\nkeep that promise. I could not obey a youth like Sir Philip. Besides, he\r\nwould never command me. He would expect me always to rule--to guide--and\r\nI have no taste whatever for the office."\r\n\r\n"_You_ no taste for swaggering, and subduing, and ordering, and ruling?"\r\n\r\n"Not my husband; only my uncle."\r\n\r\n"Where is the difference?"\r\n\r\n"There _is_ a slight difference--that is certain. And I know full well\r\nany man who wishes to live in decent comfort with me as a husband must\r\nbe able to control me."\r\n\r\n"I wish you had a real tyrant."\r\n\r\n"A tyrant would not hold me for a day, not for an hour. I would\r\nrebel--break from him--defy him."\r\n\r\n"Are you not enough to bewilder one\'s brain with your\r\nself-contradiction?"\r\n\r\n"It is evident I bewilder your brain."\r\n\r\n"You talk of Sir Philip being young. He is two-and-twenty."\r\n\r\n"My husband must be thirty, with the sense of forty."\r\n\r\n"You had better pick out some old man--some white-headed or bald-headed\r\nswain."\r\n\r\n"No, thank you."\r\n\r\n"You could lead some doting fool; you might pin him to your apron."\r\n\r\n"I might do that with a boy; but it is not my vocation. Did I not say I\r\nprefer a _master_--one in whose presence I shall feel obliged and\r\ndisposed to be good; one whose control my impatient temper must\r\nacknowledge; a man whose approbation can reward, whose displeasure\r\npunish me; a man I shall feel it impossible not to love, and very\r\npossible to fear?"\r\n\r\n"What is there to hinder you from doing all this with Sir Philip? He is\r\na baronet--a man of rank, property, connections far above yours. If you\r\ntalk of intellect, he is a poet--he writes verses; which you, I take it,\r\ncannot do, with all your cleverness."\r\n\r\n"Neither his title, wealth, pedigree, nor poetry avail to invest him\r\nwith the power I describe. These are feather-weights; they want ballast.\r\nA measure of sound, solid, practical sense would have stood him in\r\nbetter stead with me."\r\n\r\n"You and Henry rave about poetry! You used to catch fire like tinder on\r\nthe subject when you were a girl."\r\n\r\n"O uncle, there is nothing really valuable in this world, there is\r\nnothing glorious in the world to come that is not poetry!"\r\n\r\n"Marry a poet, then, in God\'s name!"\r\n\r\n"Show him me, and I will."\r\n\r\n"Sir Philip."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. You are almost as good a poet as he."\r\n\r\n"Madam, you are wandering from the point."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, uncle, I wanted to do so, and I shall be glad to lead you away\r\nwith me. Do not let us get out of temper with each other; it is not\r\nworth while."\r\n\r\n"Out of temper, Miss Keeldar! I should be glad to know who is out of\r\ntemper."\r\n\r\n"_I_ am not, yet."\r\n\r\n"If you mean to insinuate that _I_ am, I consider that you are guilty of\r\nimpertinence."\r\n\r\n"You will be soon, if you go on at that rate."\r\n\r\n"There it is! With your pert tongue you would try the patience of a\r\nJob."\r\n\r\n"I know I should."\r\n\r\n"No levity, miss! This is not a laughing matter. It is an affair I am\r\nresolved to probe thoroughly, convinced that there is mischief at the\r\nbottom. You described just now, with far too much freedom for your years\r\nand sex, the sort of individual you would prefer as a husband. Pray, did\r\nyou paint from the life?"\r\n\r\nShirley opened her lips, but instead of speaking she only glowed\r\nrose-red.\r\n\r\n"I shall have an answer to that question," affirmed Mr. Sympson,\r\nassuming vast courage and consequence on the strength of this symptom of\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n"It was an historical picture, uncle, from several originals."\r\n\r\n"Several originals! Bless my heart!"\r\n\r\n"I have been in love several times."\r\n\r\n"This is cynical."\r\n\r\n"With heroes of many nations."\r\n\r\n"What next----"\r\n\r\n"And philosophers."\r\n\r\n"She is mad----"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t ring the bell, uncle; you will alarm my aunt."\r\n\r\n"Your poor dear aunt, what a niece has she!"\r\n\r\n"Once I loved Socrates."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! no trifling, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"I admired Themistocles, Leonidas, Epaminondas."\r\n\r\n"Miss Keeldar----"\r\n\r\n"To pass over a few centuries, Washington was a plain man, but I liked\r\nhim; but to speak of the actual present----"\r\n\r\n"Ah! the actual present."\r\n\r\n"To quit crude schoolgirl fancies, and come to realities."\r\n\r\n"Realities! That is the test to which you shall be brought, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"To avow before what altar I now kneel--to reveal the present idol of my\r\nsoul----"\r\n\r\n"You will make haste about it, if you please. It is near luncheon time,\r\nand confess _you shall_."\r\n\r\n"Confess I must. My heart is full of the secret. It must be spoken. I\r\nonly wish you were Mr. Helstone instead of Mr. Sympson; you would\r\nsympathize with me better."\r\n\r\n"Madam, it is a question of common sense and common prudence, not of\r\nsympathy and sentiment, and so on. Did you say it was Mr. Helstone?"\r\n\r\n"Not precisely, but as near as may be; they are rather alike."\r\n\r\n"I will know the name; I will have particulars."\r\n\r\n"They positively _are_ rather alike. Their very faces are not\r\ndissimilar--a pair of human falcons--and dry, direct, decided both. But\r\nmy hero is the mightier of the two. His mind has the clearness of the\r\ndeep sea, the patience of its rocks, the force of its billows."\r\n\r\n"Rant and fustian!"\r\n\r\n"I dare say he can be harsh as a saw-edge and gruff as a hungry raven."\r\n\r\n"Miss Keeldar, does the person reside in Briarfield? Answer me that."\r\n\r\n"Uncle, I am going to tell you; his name is trembling on my tongue."\r\n\r\n"Speak, girl!"\r\n\r\n"That was well said, uncle. \'Speak, girl!\' It is quite tragic. England\r\nhas howled savagely against this man, uncle, and she will one day roar\r\nexultingly over him. He has been unscared by the howl, and he will be\r\nunelated by the shout."\r\n\r\n"I said she was mad. She is."\r\n\r\n"This country will change and change again in her demeanour to him; he\r\nwill never change in his duty to her. Come, cease to chafe, uncle, I\'ll\r\ntell you his name."\r\n\r\n"You shall tell me, or----"\r\n\r\n"Listen! Arthur Wellesley, Lord Wellington."\r\n\r\nMr. Sympson rose up furious. He bounced out of the room, but immediately\r\nbounced back again, shut the door, and resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n"Ma\'am, you _shall_ tell me _this_. Will your principles permit you to\r\nmarry a man without money--a man below you?"\r\n\r\n"Never a man below me."\r\n\r\n(In a high voice.) "Will you, Miss Keeldar, marry a poor man?"\r\n\r\n"What right have you, Mr. Sympson, to ask me?"\r\n\r\n"I insist upon knowing."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t go the way to know."\r\n\r\n"My family respectability shall not be compromised."\r\n\r\n"A good resolution; keep it."\r\n\r\n"Madam, it is _you_ who shall keep it."\r\n\r\n"Impossible, sir, since I form no part of your family."\r\n\r\n"Do you disown us?"\r\n\r\n"I disdain your dictatorship."\r\n\r\n"Whom _will_ you marry, Miss Keeldar?"\r\n\r\n"Not Mr. Sam Wynne, because I scorn him; not Sir Philip Nunnely, because\r\nI _only_ esteem him."\r\n\r\n"Whom have you in your eye?"\r\n\r\n"Four rejected candidates."\r\n\r\n"Such obstinacy could not be unless you were under improper influence."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean? There are certain phrases potent to make my blood\r\nboil. Improper influence! What old woman\'s cackle is that?"\r\n\r\n"Are you a young lady?"\r\n\r\n"I am a thousand times better: I am an honest woman, and as such I will\r\nbe treated."\r\n\r\n"Do you know" (leaning mysteriously forward, and speaking with ghastly\r\nsolemnity)--"do you know the whole neighbourhood teems with rumours\r\nrespecting you and a bankrupt tenant of yours, the foreigner Moore?"\r\n\r\n"Does it?"\r\n\r\n"It does. Your name is in every mouth."\r\n\r\n"It honours the lips it crosses, and I wish to the gods it may purify\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"Is it _that_ person who has power to influence you?"\r\n\r\n"Beyond any whose cause you have advocated."\r\n\r\n"Is it he you will marry?"\r\n\r\n"He is handsome, and manly, and commanding."\r\n\r\n"You declare it to my face! The Flemish knave! the low trader!"\r\n\r\n"He is talented, and venturous, and resolute. Prince is on his brow, and\r\nruler in his bearing."\r\n\r\n"She glories in it! She conceals nothing! No shame, no fear!"\r\n\r\n"When we speak the name of Moore, shame should be forgotten and fear\r\ndiscarded. The Moores know only honour and courage."\r\n\r\n"I say she is mad."\r\n\r\n"You have taunted me till my blood is up; you have worried me till I\r\nturn again."\r\n\r\n"That Moore is the brother of my son\'s tutor. Would you let the usher\r\ncall you sister?"\r\n\r\nBright and broad shone Shirley\'s eye as she fixed it on her questioner\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n"No, no; not for a province of possession, not for a century of life."\r\n\r\n"You cannot separate the husband from his family."\r\n\r\n"What then?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Louis Moore\'s sister you will be."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Sympson, I am sick at heart with all this weak trash; I will bear\r\nno more. Your thoughts are not my thoughts, your aims are not my aims,\r\nyour gods are not my gods. We do not view things in the same light; we\r\ndo not measure them by the same standard; we hardly speak in the same\r\ntongue. Let us part."\r\n\r\n"It is not," she resumed, much excited--"it is not that I hate you; you\r\nare a good sort of man. Perhaps you mean well in your way. But we cannot\r\nsuit; we are ever at variance. You annoy me with small meddling, with\r\npetty tyranny; you exasperate my temper, and make and keep me\r\npassionate. As to your small maxims, your narrow rules, your little\r\nprejudices, aversions, dogmas, bundle them off. Mr. Sympson, go, offer\r\nthem a sacrifice to the deity you worship; I\'ll none of them. I wash my\r\nhands of the lot. I walk by another creed, light, faith, and hope than\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Another creed! I believe she is an infidel."\r\n\r\n"An infidel to _your_ religion, an atheist to _your_ god."\r\n\r\n"_An--atheist!!!_"\r\n\r\n"Your god, sir, is the world. In my eyes you too, if not an infidel, are\r\nan idolater. I conceive that you ignorantly worship; in all things you\r\nappear to me too superstitious. Sir, your god, your great Bel, your\r\nfish-tailed Dagon, rises before me as a demon. You, and such as you,\r\nhave raised him to a throne, put on him a crown, given him a sceptre.\r\nBehold how hideously he governs! See him busied at the work he likes\r\nbest--making marriages. He binds the young to the old, the strong to the\r\nimbecile. He stretches out the arm of Mezentius, and fetters the dead to\r\nthe living. In his realm there is hatred--secret hatred; there is\r\ndisgust--unspoken disgust; there is treachery--family treachery; there\r\nis vice--deep, deadly domestic vice. In his dominions children grow\r\nunloving between parents who have never loved; infants are nursed on\r\ndeception from their very birth; they are reared in an atmosphere\r\ncorrupt with lies. Your god rules at the bridal of kings; look at your\r\nroyal dynasties! Your deity is the deity of foreign aristocracies;\r\nanalyze the blue blood of Spain! Your god is the Hymen of France; what\r\nis French domestic life? All that surrounds him hastens to decay; all\r\ndeclines and degenerates under his sceptre. _Your_ god is a masked\r\nDeath."\r\n\r\n"This language is terrible! My daughters and you must associate no\r\nlonger, Miss Keeldar; there is danger in such companionship. Had I known\r\nyou a little earlier--but, extraordinary as I thought you, I could not\r\nhave believed----"\r\n\r\n"Now, sir, do you begin to be aware that it is useless to scheme for me;\r\nthat in doing so you but sow the wind to reap the whirlwind? I sweep\r\nyour cobweb projects from my path, that I may pass on unsullied. I am\r\nanchored on a resolve you cannot shake. My heart, my conscience shall\r\ndispose of my hand--_they only_. Know this at last."\r\n\r\nMr. Sympson was becoming a little bewildered.\r\n\r\n"Never heard such language!" he muttered again and again; "never was so\r\naddressed in my life--never was so used!"\r\n\r\n"You are quite confused, sir. You had better withdraw, or I will."\r\n\r\nHe rose hastily. "We must leave this place; they must pack up at once."\r\n\r\n"Do not hurry my aunt and cousins; give them time."\r\n\r\n"No more intercourse; she\'s not proper."\r\n\r\nHe made his way to the door. He came back for his handkerchief. He\r\ndropped his snuff-box, leaving the contents scattered on the carpet; he\r\nstumbled out. Tartar lay outside across the mat; Mr. Sympson almost fell\r\nover him. In the climax of his exasperation he hurled an oath at the dog\r\nand a coarse epithet at his mistress.\r\n\r\n"Poor Mr. Sympson! he is both feeble and vulgar," said Shirley to\r\nherself. "My head aches, and I am tired," she added; and leaning her\r\nhead upon a cushion, she softly subsided from excitement to repose. One,\r\nentering the room a quarter of an hour afterwards, found her asleep.\r\nWhen Shirley had been agitated, she generally took this natural\r\nrefreshment; it would come at her call.\r\n\r\nThe intruder paused in her unconscious presence, and said, "Miss\r\nKeeldar."\r\n\r\nPerhaps his voice harmonized with some dream into which she was passing.\r\nIt did not startle, it hardly roused her. Without opening her eyes, she\r\nbut turned her head a little, so that her cheek and profile, before\r\nhidden by her arm, became visible. She looked rosy, happy, half smiling,\r\nbut her eyelashes were wet. She had wept in slumber; or perhaps, before\r\ndropping asleep, a few natural tears had fallen after she had heard that\r\nepithet. No man--no woman--is always strong, always able to bear up\r\nagainst the unjust opinion, the vilifying word. Calumny, even from the\r\nmouth of a fool, will sometimes cut into unguarded feelings. Shirley\r\nlooked like a child that had been naughty and punished, but was now\r\nforgiven and at rest.\r\n\r\n"Miss Keeldar," again said the voice. This time it woke her. She looked\r\nup, and saw at her side Louis Moore--not close at her side, but\r\nstanding, with arrested step, two or three yards from her.\r\n\r\n"O Mr. Moore!" she said. "I was afraid it was my uncle again: he and I\r\nhave quarrelled."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Sympson should let you alone," was the reply. "Can he not see that\r\nyou are as yet far from strong?"\r\n\r\n"I assure you he did not find me weak. I did not cry when he was here."\r\n\r\n"He is about to evacuate Fieldhead--so he says. He is now giving orders\r\nto his family. He has been in the schoolroom issuing commands in a\r\nmanner which, I suppose, was a continuation of that with which he has\r\nharassed you."\r\n\r\n"Are you and Henry to go?"\r\n\r\n"I believe, as far as Henry is concerned, that was the tenor of his\r\nscarcely intelligible directions; but he may change all to-morrow. He is\r\njust in that mood when you cannot depend on his consistency for two\r\nconsecutive hours. I doubt whether he will leave you for weeks yet. To\r\nmyself he addressed some words which will require a little attention and\r\ncomment by-and-by, when I have time to bestow on them. At the moment he\r\ncame in I was busied with a note I had got from Mr. Yorke--so fully\r\nbusied that I cut short the interview with him somewhat abruptly. I left\r\nhim raving. Here is the note. I wish you to see it. It refers to my\r\nbrother Robert." And he looked at Shirley.\r\n\r\n"I shall be glad to hear news of him. Is he coming home?"\r\n\r\n"He is come. He is in Yorkshire. Mr. Yorke went yesterday to Stilbro\' to\r\nmeet him."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Moore, something is wrong----"\r\n\r\n"Did my voice tremble? He is now at Briarmains, and I am going to see\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"What has occurred?"\r\n\r\n"If you turn so pale I shall be sorry I have spoken. It might have been\r\nworse. Robert is not dead, but much hurt."\r\n\r\n"O sir, it is you who are pale. Sit down near me."\r\n\r\n"Read the note. Let me open it."\r\n\r\nMiss Keeldar read the note. It briefly signified that last night Robert\r\nMoore had been shot at from behind the wall of Milldean plantation, at\r\nthe foot of the Brow; that he was wounded severely, but it was hoped not\r\nfatally. Of the assassin, or assassins, nothing was known; they had\r\nescaped. "No doubt," Mr. Yorke observed, "it was done in revenge. It was\r\na pity ill-will had ever been raised; but that could not be helped now."\r\n\r\n"He is my only brother," said Louis, as Shirley returned the note. "I\r\ncannot hear unmoved that ruffians have laid in wait for him, and shot\r\nhim down, like some wild beast from behind a wall."\r\n\r\n"Be comforted; be hopeful. He will get better--I know he will."\r\n\r\nShirley, solicitous to soothe, held her hand over Mr. Moore\'s as it lay\r\non the arm of the chair. She just touched it lightly, scarce palpably.\r\n\r\n"Well, give me your hand," he said. "It will be for the first time; it\r\nis in a moment of calamity. Give it me."\r\n\r\nAwaiting neither consent nor refusal, he took what he asked.\r\n\r\n"I am going to Briarmains now," he went on. "I want you to step over to\r\nthe rectory and tell Caroline Helstone what has happened. Will you do\r\nthis? She will hear it best from you."\r\n\r\n"Immediately," said Shirley, with docile promptitude. "Ought I to say\r\nthat there is no danger?"\r\n\r\n"Say so."\r\n\r\n"You will come back soon, and let me know more?"\r\n\r\n"I will either come or write."\r\n\r\n"Trust me for watching over Caroline. I will communicate with your\r\nsister too; but doubtless she is already with Robert?"\r\n\r\n"Doubtless, or will be soon. Good-morning now."\r\n\r\n"You will bear up, come what may."\r\n\r\n"We shall see that."\r\n\r\nShirley\'s fingers were obliged to withdraw from the tutor\'s. Louis was\r\nobliged to relinquish that hand folded, clasped, hidden in his own.\r\n\r\n"I thought I should have had to support her," he said, as he walked\r\ntowards Briarmains, "and it is she who has made me strong. That look of\r\npity, that gentle touch! No down was ever softer, no elixir more potent!\r\nIt lay like a snowflake; it thrilled like lightning. A thousand times I\r\nhave longed to possess that hand--to have it in mine. I _have_ possessed\r\nit; for five minutes I held it. Her fingers and mine can never be\r\nstrangers more. Having met once they must meet again."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOLBOY AND THE WOOD-NYMPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nBriarmains being nearer than the Hollow, Mr. Yorke had conveyed his\r\nyoung comrade there. He had seen him laid in the best bed of the house,\r\nas carefully as if he had been one of his own sons. The sight of his\r\nblood, welling from the treacherously inflicted wound, made him indeed\r\nthe son of the Yorkshire gentleman\'s heart. The spectacle of the sudden\r\nevent, of the tall, straight shape prostrated in its pride across the\r\nroad, of the fine southern head laid low in the dust, of that youth in\r\nprime flung at once before him pallid, lifeless, helpless--this was the\r\nvery combination of circumstances to win for the victim Mr. Yorke\'s\r\nliveliest interest.\r\n\r\nNo other hand was there to raise--to aid, no other voice to question\r\nkindly, no other brain to concert measures; he had to do it all himself.\r\nThis utter dependence of the speechless, bleeding youth (as a youth he\r\nregarded him) on his benevolence secured that benevolence most\r\neffectually. Well did Mr. Yorke like to have power, and to use it. He\r\nhad now between his hands power over a fellow-creature\'s life. It suited\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNo less perfectly did it suit his saturnine better half. The incident\r\nwas quite in her way and to her taste. Some women would have been\r\nterror-struck to see a gory man brought in over their threshold, and\r\nlaid down in their hall in the "howe of the night." There, you would\r\nsuppose, was subject-matter for hysterics. No. Mrs. Yorke went into\r\nhysterics when Jessie would not leave the garden to come to her\r\nknitting, or when Martin proposed starting for Australia, with a view to\r\nrealize freedom and escape the tyranny of Matthew; but an attempted\r\nmurder near her door--a half-murdered man in her best bed--set her\r\nstraight, cheered her spirits, gave her cap the dash of a turban.\r\n\r\nMrs. Yorke was just the woman who, while rendering miserable the\r\ndrudging life of a simple maid-servant, would nurse like a heroine a\r\nhospital full of plague patients. She almost loved Moore. Her tough\r\nheart almost yearned towards him when she found him committed to her\r\ncharge--left in her arms, as dependent on her as her youngest-born in\r\nthe cradle. Had she seen a domestic or one of her daughters give him a\r\ndraught of water or smooth his pillow, she would have boxed the\r\nintruder\'s ears. She chased Jessie and Rose from the upper realm of the\r\nhouse; she forbade the housemaids to set their foot in it.\r\n\r\nNow, if the accident had happened at the rectory gates, and old Helstone\r\nhad taken in the martyr, neither Yorke nor his wife would have pitied\r\nhim. They would have adjudged him right served for his tyranny and\r\nmeddling. As it was, he became, for the present, the apple of their eye.\r\n\r\nStrange! Louis Moore was permitted to come--to sit down on the edge of\r\nthe bed and lean over the pillow; to hold his brother\'s hand, and press\r\nhis pale forehead with his fraternal lips; and Mrs. Yorke bore it well.\r\nShe suffered him to stay half the day there; she once suffered him to\r\nsit up all night in the chamber; she rose herself at five o\'clock of a\r\nwet November morning, and with her own hands lit the kitchen fire, and\r\nmade the brothers a breakfast, and served it to them herself.\r\nMajestically arrayed in a boundless flannel wrapper, a shawl, and her\r\nnightcap, she sat and watched them eat, as complacently as a hen beholds\r\nher chickens feed. Yet she gave the cook warning that day for venturing\r\nto make and carry up to Mr. Moore a basin of sago-gruel; and the\r\nhousemaid lost her favour because, when Mr. Louis was departing, she\r\nbrought him his surtout aired from the kitchen, and, like a "forward\r\npiece" as she was, helped him on with it, and accepted in return a\r\nsmile, a "Thank you, my girl," and a shilling. Two ladies called one\r\nday, pale and anxious, and begged earnestly, humbly, to be allowed to\r\nsee Mr. Moore one instant. Mrs. Yorke hardened her heart, and sent them\r\npacking--not without opprobrium.\r\n\r\nBut how was it when Hortense Moore came? Not so bad as might have been\r\nexpected. The whole family of the Moores really seemed to suit Mrs.\r\nYorke so as no other family had ever suited her. Hortense and she\r\npossessed an exhaustless mutual theme of conversation in the corrupt\r\npropensities of servants. Their views of this class were similar; they\r\nwatched them with the same suspicion, and judged them with the same\r\nseverity. Hortense, too, from the very first showed no manner of\r\njealousy of Mrs. Yorke\'s attentions to Robert--she let her keep the post\r\nof nurse with little interference; and, for herself, found ceaseless\r\noccupation in fidgeting about the house, holding the kitchen under\r\nsurveillance, reporting what passed there, and, in short, making herself\r\ngenerally useful. Visitors they both of them agreed in excluding\r\nsedulously from the sickroom. They held the young mill-owner captive,\r\nand hardly let the air breathe or the sun shine on him.\r\n\r\nMr. MacTurk, the surgeon to whom Moore\'s case had been committed,\r\npronounced his wound of a dangerous, but, he trusted, not of a hopeless\r\ncharacter. At first he wished to place with him a nurse of his own\r\nselection; but this neither Mrs. Yorke nor Hortense would hear of. They\r\npromised faithful observance of directions. He was left, therefore, for\r\nthe present in their hands.\r\n\r\nDoubtless they executed the trust to the best of their ability; but\r\nsomething got wrong. The bandages were displaced or tampered with; great\r\nloss of blood followed. MacTurk, being summoned, came with steed afoam.\r\nHe was one of those surgeons whom it is dangerous to vex--abrupt in his\r\nbest moods, in his worst savage. On seeing Moore\'s state he relieved his\r\nfeelings by a little flowery language, with which it is not necessary to\r\nstrew the present page. A bouquet or two of the choicest blossoms fell\r\non the unperturbed head of one Mr. Graves, a stony young assistant he\r\nusually carried about with him; with a second nosegay he gifted another\r\nyoung gentleman in his train--an interesting fac-simile of himself,\r\nbeing indeed his own son; but the full _corbeille_ of blushing bloom\r\nfell to the lot of meddling womankind, _en masse_.\r\n\r\nFor the best part of one winter night himself and satellites were busied\r\nabout Moore. There at his bedside, shut up alone with him in his\r\nchamber, they wrought and wrangled over his exhausted frame. They three\r\nwere on one side of the bed, and Death on the other. The conflict was\r\nsharp; it lasted till day broke, when the balance between the\r\nbelligerents seemed so equal that both parties might have claimed the\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nAt dawn Graves and young MacTurk were left in charge of the patient,\r\nwhile the senior went himself in search of additional strength, and\r\nsecured it in the person of Mrs. Horsfall, the best nurse on his staff.\r\nTo this woman he gave Moore in charge, with the sternest injunctions\r\nrespecting the responsibility laid on her shoulders. She took this\r\nresponsibility stolidly, as she did also the easy-chair at the bedhead.\r\nThat moment she began her reign.\r\n\r\nMrs. Horsfall had one virtue--orders received from MacTurk she obeyed to\r\nthe letter. The ten commandments were less binding in her eyes than her\r\nsurgeon\'s dictum. In other respects she was no woman, but a dragon.\r\nHortense Moore fell effaced before her; Mrs. Yorke withdrew--crushed;\r\nyet both these women were personages of some dignity in their own\r\nestimation, and of some bulk in the estimation of others. Perfectly\r\ncowed by the breadth, the height, the bone, and the brawn of Mrs.\r\nHorsfall, they retreated to the back parlour. She, for her part, sat\r\nupstairs when she liked, and downstairs when she preferred it. She took\r\nher dram three times a day, and her pipe of tobacco four times.\r\n\r\nAs to Moore, no one now ventured to inquire about him. Mrs. Horsfall had\r\nhim at dry-nurse. It was she who was to do for him, and the general\r\nconjecture now ran that she did for him accordingly.\r\n\r\nMorning and evening MacTurk came to see him. His case, thus complicated\r\nby a new mischance, was become one of interest in the surgeon\'s eyes. He\r\nregarded him as a damaged piece of clockwork, which it would be\r\ncreditable to his skill to set agoing again. Graves and young\r\nMacTurk--Moore\'s sole other visitors--contemplated him in the light in\r\nwhich they were wont to contemplate the occupant for the time being of\r\nthe dissecting-room at Stilbro\' Infirmary.\r\n\r\nRobert Moore had a pleasant time of it--in pain, in danger, too weak to\r\nmove, almost too weak to speak, a sort of giantess his keeper, the three\r\nsurgeons his sole society. Thus he lay through the diminishing days and\r\nlengthening nights of the whole drear month of November.\r\n\r\nIn the commencement of his captivity Moore used feebly to resist Mrs.\r\nHorsfall. He hated the sight of her rough bulk, and dreaded the contact\r\nof her hard hands; but she taught him docility in a trice. She made no\r\naccount whatever of his six feet, his manly thews and sinews; she turned\r\nhim in his bed as another woman would have turned a babe in its cradle.\r\nWhen he was good she addressed him as "my dear" and "honey," and when he\r\nwas bad she sometimes shook him. Did he attempt to speak when MacTurk\r\nwas there, she lifted her hand and bade him "Hush!" like a nurse\r\nchecking a forward child. If she had not smoked, if she had not taken\r\ngin, it would have been better, he thought; but she did both. Once, in\r\nher absence, he intimated to MacTurk that "that woman was a\r\ndram-drinker."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! my dear sir, they are all so," was the reply he got for his\r\npains. "But Horsfall has this virtue," added the surgeon--"drunk or\r\nsober, she always remembers to obey _me_."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt length the latter autumn passed; its fogs, its rains withdrew from\r\nEngland their mourning and their tears; its winds swept on to sigh over\r\nlands far away. Behind November came deep winter--clearness, stillness,\r\nfrost accompanying.\r\n\r\nA calm day had settled into a crystalline evening. The world wore a\r\nNorth Pole colouring; all its lights and tints looked like the\r\n_reflets_[A] of white, or violet, or pale green gems. The hills wore a\r\nlilac blue; the setting sun had purple in its red; the sky was ice, all\r\nsilvered azure; when the stars rose, they were of white crystal, not\r\ngold; gray, or cerulean, or faint emerald hues--cool, pure, and\r\ntransparent--tinged the mass of the landscape.\r\n\r\n    [A] Find me an English word as good, reader, and I will gladly\r\n        dispense with the French word. "Reflections" won\'t do.\r\n\r\nWhat is this by itself in a wood no longer green, no longer even russet,\r\na wood neutral tint--this dark blue moving object? Why, it is a\r\nschoolboy--a Briarfield grammar-school boy--who has left his companions,\r\nnow trudging home by the highroad, and is seeking a certain tree, with a\r\ncertain mossy mound at its root, convenient as a seat. Why is he\r\nlingering here? The air is cold and the time wears late. He sits down.\r\nWhat is he thinking about? Does he feel the chaste charm Nature wears\r\nto-night? A pearl-white moon smiles through the gray trees; does he care\r\nfor her smile?\r\n\r\nImpossible to say; for he is silent, and his countenance does not speak.\r\nAs yet it is no mirror to reflect sensation, but rather a mask to\r\nconceal it. This boy is a stripling of fifteen--slight, and tall of his\r\nyears. In his face there is as little of amenity as of servility, his\r\neye seems prepared to note any incipient attempt to control or overreach\r\nhim, and the rest of his features indicate faculties alert for\r\nresistance. Wise ushers avoid unnecessary interference with that lad.\r\nTo break him in by severity would be a useless attempt; to win him by\r\nflattery would be an effort worse than useless. He is best let alone.\r\nTime will educate and experience train him.\r\n\r\nProfessedly Martin Yorke (it is a young Yorke, of course) tramples on\r\nthe name of poetry. Talk sentiment to him, and you would be answered by\r\nsarcasm. Here he is, wandering alone, waiting duteously on Nature, while\r\nshe unfolds a page of stern, of silent, and of solemn poetry beneath his\r\nattentive gaze.\r\n\r\nBeing seated, he takes from his satchel a book--not the Latin grammar,\r\nbut a contraband volume of fairy tales. There will be light enough yet\r\nfor an hour to serve his keen young vision. Besides, the moon waits on\r\nhim; her beam, dim and vague as yet, fills the glade where he sits.\r\n\r\nHe reads. He is led into a solitary mountain region; all round him is\r\nrude and desolate, shapeless, and almost colourless. He hears bells\r\ntinkle on the wind. Forth-riding from the formless folds of the mist\r\ndawns on him the brightest vision--a green-robed lady, on a snow-white\r\npalfrey. He sees her dress, her gems, and her steed. She arrests him\r\nwith some mysterious question. He is spell-bound, and must follow her\r\ninto fairyland.\r\n\r\nA second legend bears him to the sea-shore. There tumbles in a strong\r\ntide, boiling at the base of dizzy cliffs. It rains and blows. A reef of\r\nrocks, black and rough, stretches far into the sea. All along, and\r\namong, and above these crags dash and flash, sweep and leap, swells,\r\nwreaths, drifts of snowy spray. Some lone wanderer is out on these\r\nrocks, treading with cautious step the wet, wild seaweed; glancing down\r\ninto hollows where the brine lies fathoms deep and emerald clear, and\r\nseeing there wilder and stranger and huger vegetation than is found on\r\nland, with treasure of shells--some green, some purple, some\r\npearly--clustered in the curls of the snaky plants. He hears a cry.\r\nLooking up and forward, he sees, at the bleak point of the reef, a tall,\r\npale thing--shaped like man, but made of spray--transparent, tremulous,\r\nawful. It stands not alone. They are all human figures that wanton in\r\nthe rocks--a crowd of foam-women--a band of white, evanescent Nereids.\r\n\r\nHush! Shut the book; hide it in the satchel. Martin hears a tread. He\r\nlistens. No--yes. Once more the dead leaves, lightly crushed, rustle on\r\nthe wood path. Martin watches; the trees part, and a woman issues\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nShe is a lady dressed in dark silk, a veil covering her face. Martin\r\nnever met a lady in this wood before--nor any female, save, now and\r\nthen, a village girl come to gather nuts. To-night the apparition does\r\nnot displease him. He observes, as she approaches, that she is neither\r\nold nor plain, but, on the contrary, very youthful; and, but that he now\r\nrecognizes her for one whom he has often wilfully pronounced ugly, he\r\nwould deem that he discovered traits of beauty behind the thin gauze of\r\nthat veil.\r\n\r\nShe passes him and says nothing. He knew she would. All women are proud\r\nmonkeys, and he knows no more conceited doll than that Caroline\r\nHelstone. The thought is hardly hatched in his mind when the lady\r\nretraces those two steps she had got beyond him, and raising her veil,\r\nreposes her glance on his face, while she softly asks, "Are you one of\r\nMr. Yorke\'s sons?"\r\n\r\nNo human evidence would ever have been able to persuade Martin Yorke\r\nthat he blushed when thus addressed; yet blush he did, to the ears.\r\n\r\n"I am," he said bluntly, and encouraged himself to wonder,\r\nsuperciliously, what would come next.\r\n\r\n"You are Martin, I think?" was the observation that followed.\r\n\r\nIt could not have been more felicitous. It was a simple sentence--very\r\nartlessly, a little timidly, pronounced; but it chimed in harmony to the\r\nyouth\'s nature. It stilled him like a note of music.\r\n\r\nMartin had a keen sense of his personality; he felt it right and\r\nsensible that the girl should discriminate him from his brothers. Like\r\nhis father, he hated ceremony. It was acceptable to hear a lady address\r\nhim as "Martin," and not Mr. Martin or Master Martin, which form would\r\nhave lost her his good graces for ever. Worse, if possible, than\r\nceremony was the other extreme of slipshod familiarity. The slight tone\r\nof bashfulness, the scarcely perceptible hesitation, was considered\r\nperfectly in place.\r\n\r\n"I am Martin," he said.\r\n\r\n"Are your father and mother well?" (it was lucky she did not say _papa_\r\nand _mamma_; that would have undone all); "and Rose and Jessie?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so."\r\n\r\n"My cousin Hortense is still at Briarmains?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes."\r\n\r\nMartin gave a comic half-smile and demi-groan. The half-smile was\r\nresponded to by the lady, who could guess in what sort of odour Hortense\r\nwas likely to be held by the young Yorkes.\r\n\r\n"Does your mother like her?"\r\n\r\n"They suit so well about the servants they can\'t help liking each\r\nother."\r\n\r\n"It is cold to-night."\r\n\r\n"Why are you out so late?"\r\n\r\n"I lost my way in this wood."\r\n\r\nNow, indeed, Martin allowed himself a refreshing laugh of scorn.\r\n\r\n"Lost your way in the mighty forest of Briarmains! You deserve never\r\nmore to find it."\r\n\r\n"I never was here before, and I believe I am trespassing now. You might\r\ninform against me if you chose, Martin, and have me fined. It is your\r\nfather\'s wood."\r\n\r\n"I should think I knew that. But since you are so simple as to lose your\r\nway, I will guide you out."\r\n\r\n"You need not. I have got into the track now. I shall be right. Martin"\r\n(a little quickly), "how is Mr. Moore?"\r\n\r\nMartin had heard certain rumours; it struck him that it might be amusing\r\nto make an experiment.\r\n\r\n"Going to die. Nothing can save him. All hope flung overboard!"\r\n\r\nShe put her veil aside. She looked into his eyes, and said, "To die!"\r\n\r\n"To die. All along of the women, my mother and the rest. They did\r\nsomething about his bandages that finished everything. He would have got\r\nbetter but for them. I am sure they should be arrested, cribbed, tried,\r\nand brought in for Botany Bay, at the very least."\r\n\r\nThe questioner, perhaps, did nor hear this judgment. She stood\r\nmotionless. In two minutes, without another word, she moved forwards; no\r\ngood-night, no further inquiry. This was not amusing, nor what Martin\r\nhad calculated on. He expected something dramatic and demonstrative. It\r\nwas hardly worth while to frighten the girl if she would not entertain\r\nhim in return. He called, "Miss Helstone!"\r\n\r\nShe did not hear or turn. He hastened after and overtook her.\r\n\r\n"Come; are you uneasy about what I said?"\r\n\r\n"You know nothing about death, Martin; you are too young for me to talk\r\nto concerning such a thing."\r\n\r\n"Did you believe me? It\'s all flummery! Moore eats like three men. They\r\nare always making sago or tapioca or something good for him. I never go\r\ninto the kitchen but there is a saucepan on the fire, cooking him some\r\ndainty. I think I will play the old soldier, and be fed on the fat of\r\nthe land like him."\r\n\r\n"Martin! Martin!" Here her voice trembled, and she stopped.\r\n\r\n"It is exceedingly wrong of you, Martin. You have almost killed me."\r\n\r\nAgain she stopped. She leaned against a tree, trembling, shuddering, and\r\nas pale as death.\r\n\r\nMartin contemplated her with inexpressible curiosity. In one sense it\r\nwas, as he would have expressed it, "nuts" to him to see this. It told\r\nhim so much, and he was beginning to have a great relish for discovering\r\nsecrets. In another sense it reminded him of what he had once felt when\r\nhe had heard a blackbird lamenting for her nestlings, which Matthew had\r\ncrushed with a stone, and that was not a pleasant feeling. Unable to\r\nfind anything very appropriate to _say_ in order to comfort her, he\r\nbegan to cast about in his mind what he could _do_. He smiled. The lad\'s\r\nsmile gave wondrous transparency to his physiognomy.\r\n\r\n"Eureka!" he cried. "I\'ll set all straight by-and-by. You are better\r\nnow, Miss Caroline. Walk forward," he urged.\r\n\r\nNot reflecting that it would be more difficult for Miss Helstone than\r\nfor himself to climb a wall or penetrate a hedge, he piloted her by a\r\nshort cut which led to no gate. The consequence was he had to help her\r\nover some formidable obstacles, and while he railed at her for\r\nhelplessness, he perfectly liked to feel himself of use.\r\n\r\n"Martin, before we separate, assure me seriously, and on your word of\r\nhonour, that Mr. Moore is better."\r\n\r\n"How very much you think of that Moore!"\r\n\r\n"No--but--many of his friends may ask me, and I wish to be able to give\r\nan authentic answer."\r\n\r\n"You may tell them he is well enough, only idle. You may tell them that\r\nhe takes mutton chops for dinner, and the best of arrowroot for supper.\r\nI intercepted a basin myself one night on its way upstairs, and ate half\r\nof it."\r\n\r\n"And who waits on him, Martin? who nurses him?"\r\n\r\n"Nurses him? The great baby! Why, a woman as round and big as our\r\nlargest water-butt--a rough, hard-favoured old girl. I make no doubt\r\nshe leads him a rich life. Nobody else is let near him. He is chiefly in\r\nthe dark. It is my belief she knocks him about terribly in that chamber.\r\nI listen at the wall sometimes when I am in bed, and I think I hear her\r\nthumping him. You should see her fist. She could hold half a dozen hands\r\nlike yours in her one palm. After all, notwithstanding the chops and\r\njellies he gets, I would not be in his shoes. In fact, it is my private\r\nopinion that she eats most of what goes up on the tray to Mr. Moore. I\r\nwish she may not be starving him."\r\n\r\nProfound silence and meditation on Caroline\'s part, and a sly\r\nwatchfulness on Martin\'s.\r\n\r\n"You never see him, I suppose, Martin?"\r\n\r\n"I? No. I don\'t care to see him, for my own part."\r\n\r\nSilence again.\r\n\r\n"Did not you come to our house once with Mrs. Pryor, about five weeks\r\nsince, to ask after him?" again inquired Martin.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I dare say you wished to be shown upstairs?"\r\n\r\n"We _did_ wish it. We entreated it; but your mother declined."\r\n\r\n"Ay! she declined. I heard it all. She treated you as it is her pleasure\r\nto treat visitors now and then. She behaved to you rudely and harshly."\r\n\r\n"She was not kind; for you know, Martin, we are relations, and it is\r\nnatural we should take an interest in Mr. Moore. But here we must part;\r\nwe are at your father\'s gate."\r\n\r\n"Very well, what of that? I shall walk home with you."\r\n\r\n"They will miss you, and wonder where you are."\r\n\r\n"Let them. I can take care of myself, I suppose."\r\n\r\nMartin knew that he had already incurred the penalty of a lecture, and\r\ndry bread for his tea. No matter; the evening had furnished him with an\r\nadventure. It was better than muffins and toast.\r\n\r\nHe walked home with Caroline. On the way he promised to see Mr. Moore,\r\nin spite of the dragon who guarded his chamber, and appointed an hour on\r\nthe next day when Caroline was to come to Briarmains Wood and get\r\ntidings of him. He would meet her at a certain tree. The scheme led to\r\nnothing; still he liked it.\r\n\r\nHaving reached home, the dry bread and the lecture were duly\r\nadministered to him, and he was dismissed to bed at an early hour. He\r\naccepted his punishment with the toughest stoicism.\r\n\r\nEre ascending to his chamber he paid a secret visit to the dining-room,\r\na still, cold, stately apartment, seldom used, for the family\r\ncustomarily dined in the back parlour. He stood before the mantelpiece,\r\nand lifted his candle to two pictures hung above--female heads: one, a\r\ntype of serene beauty, happy and innocent; the other, more lovely, but\r\nforlorn and desperate.\r\n\r\n"She looked like _that_," he said, gazing on the latter sketch, "when\r\nshe sobbed, turned white, and leaned against the tree."\r\n\r\n"I suppose," he pursued, when he was in his room, and seated on the edge\r\nof his pallet-bed--"I suppose she is what they call \'_in love_\'--yes,\r\n_in love_ with that long thing in the next chamber. Whisht! is that\r\nHorsfall clattering him? I wonder he does not yell out. It really sounds\r\nas if she had fallen on him tooth and nail; but I suppose she is making\r\nthe bed. I saw her at it once. She hit into the mattresses as if she was\r\nboxing. It is queer, Zillah (they call her Zillah)--Zillah Horsfall is a\r\nwoman, and Caroline Helstone is a woman; they are two individuals of the\r\nsame species--not much alike though. Is she a pretty girl, that\r\nCaroline? I suspect she is; very nice to look at--something so clear in\r\nher face, so soft in her eyes. I approve of her looking at me; it does\r\nme good. She has long eyelashes. Their shadow seems to rest where she\r\ngazes, and to instil peace and thought. If she behaves well, and\r\ncontinues to suit me as she has suited me to-day, I may do her a good\r\nturn. I rather relish the notion of circumventing my mother and that\r\nogress old Horsfall. Not that I like humouring Moore; but whatever I do\r\nI\'ll be paid for, and in coin of my own choosing. I know what reward I\r\nwill claim--one displeasing to Moore, and agreeable to myself."\r\n\r\nHe turned into bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nMARTIN\'S TACTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to the arrangement of Martin\'s plan that he should stay\r\nat home that day. Accordingly, he found no appetite for breakfast, and\r\njust about school-time took a severe pain about his heart, which\r\nrendered it advisable that, instead of setting out to the grammar school\r\nwith Mark, he should succeed to his father\'s arm-chair by the fireside,\r\nand also to his morning paper. This point being satisfactorily settled,\r\nand Mark being gone to Mr. Summer\'s class, and Matthew and Mr. Yorke\r\nwithdrawn to the counting-house, three other exploits--nay,\r\nfour--remained to be achieved.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was to realize the breakfast he had not yet tasted,\r\nand with which his appetite of fifteen could ill afford to dispense; the\r\nsecond, third, fourth, to get his mother, Miss Moore, and Mrs. Horsfall\r\nsuccessfully out of the way before four o\'clock that afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe first was, for the present, the most pressing, since the work before\r\nhim demanded an amount of energy which the present empty condition of\r\nhis youthful stomach did not seem likely to supply.\r\n\r\nMartin knew the way to the larder, and knowing this way he took it. The\r\nservants were in the kitchen, breakfasting solemnly with closed doors;\r\nhis mother and Miss Moore were airing themselves on the lawn, and\r\ndiscussing the closed doors aforesaid. Martin, safe in the larder, made\r\nfastidious selection from its stores. His breakfast had been delayed; he\r\nwas determined it should be _recherch\xc3\xa9_. It appeared to him that a\r\nvariety on his usual somewhat insipid fare of bread and milk was both\r\ndesirable and advisable; the savoury and the salutary he thought might\r\nbe combined. There was store of rosy apples laid in straw upon a shelf;\r\nhe picked out three. There was pastry upon a dish; he selected an\r\napricot puff and a damson tart. On the plain household bread his eye\r\ndid not dwell; but he surveyed with favour some currant tea-cakes, and\r\ncondescended to make choice of one. Thanks to his clasp-knife, he was\r\nable to appropriate a wing of fowl and a slice of ham; a cantlet of cold\r\ncustard-pudding he thought would harmonize with these articles; and\r\nhaving made this final addition to his booty, he at length sallied forth\r\ninto the hall.\r\n\r\nHe was already half-way across--three steps more would have anchored him\r\nin the harbour of the back parlour--when the front door opened, and\r\nthere stood Matthew. Better far had it been the Old Gentleman, in full\r\nequipage of horns, hoofs, and tail.\r\n\r\nMatthew, sceptic and scoffer, had already failed to subscribe a prompt\r\nbelief in that pain about the heart. He had muttered some words, amongst\r\nwhich the phrase "shamming Abraham" had been very distinctly audible,\r\nand the succession to the armchair and newspaper had appeared to affect\r\nhim with mental spasms. The spectacle now before him--the apples, the\r\ntarts, the tea-cakes, the fowl, ham, and pudding--offered evidence but\r\ntoo well calculated to inflate his opinion of his own sagacity.\r\n\r\nMartin paused _interdit_ one minute, one instant; the next he knew his\r\nground, and pronounced all well. With the true perspicacity _des \xc3\xa2mes\r\n\xc3\xa9lites_, he at once saw how this at first sight untoward event might be\r\nturned to excellent account. He saw how it might be so handled as to\r\nsecure the accomplishment of his second task--namely, the disposal of\r\nhis mother. He knew that a collision between him and Matthew always\r\nsuggested to Mrs. Yorke the propriety of a fit of hysterics. He further\r\nknew that, on the principle of calm succeeding to storm, after a morning\r\nof hysterics his mother was sure to indulge in an afternoon of bed. This\r\nwould accommodate him perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe collision duly took place in the hall. A dry laugh, an insulting\r\nsneer, a contemptuous taunt, met by a nonchalant but most cutting reply,\r\nwere the signals. They rushed at it. Martin, who usually made little\r\nnoise on these occasions, made a great deal now. In flew the servants,\r\nMrs. Yorke, Miss Moore. No female hand could separate them. Mr. Yorke\r\nwas summoned.\r\n\r\n"Sons," said he, "one of you must leave my roof if this occurs again. I\r\nwill have no Cain and Abel strife here."\r\n\r\nMartin now allowed himself to be taken off. He had been hurt; he was the\r\nyoungest and slightest. He was quite cool, in no passion; he even\r\nsmiled, content that the most difficult part of the labour he had set\r\nhimself was over.\r\n\r\nOnce he seemed to flag in the course of the morning.\r\n\r\n"It is not worth while to bother myself for that Caroline," he remarked.\r\nBut a quarter of an hour afterwards he was again in the dining-room,\r\nlooking at the head with dishevelled tresses, and eyes turbid with\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "I made her sob, shudder, almost faint. I\'ll see her\r\nsmile before I\'ve done with her; besides, I want to outwit all these\r\nwomenites."\r\n\r\nDirectly after dinner Mrs. Yorke fulfilled her son\'s calculation by\r\nwithdrawing to her chamber. Now for Hortense.\r\n\r\nThat lady was just comfortably settled to stocking-mending in the back\r\nparlour, when Martin--laying down a book which, stretched on the sofa\r\n(he was still indisposed, according to his own account), he had been\r\nperusing in all the voluptuous ease of a yet callow pacha--lazily\r\nintroduced some discourse about Sarah, the maid at the Hollow. In the\r\ncourse of much verbal meandering he insinuated information that this\r\ndamsel was said to have three suitors--Frederic Murgatroyd, Jeremiah\r\nPighills, and John-of-Mally\'s-of-Hannah\'s-of-Deb\'s; and that Miss Mann\r\nhad affirmed she knew for a fact that, now the girl was left in sole\r\ncharge of the cottage, she often had her swains to meals, and\r\nentertained them with the best the house afforded.\r\n\r\nIt needed no more. Hortense could not have lived another hour without\r\nbetaking herself to the scene of these nefarious transactions, and\r\ninspecting the state of matters in person. Mrs. Horsfall remained.\r\n\r\nMartin, master of the field now, extracted from his mother\'s work-basket\r\na bunch of keys; with these he opened the sideboard cupboard, produced\r\nthence a black bottle and a small glass, placed them on the table,\r\nnimbly mounted the stairs, made for Mr. Moore\'s door, tapped; the nurse\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n"If you please, ma\'am, you are invited to step into the back parlour and\r\ntake some refreshment. You will not be disturbed; the family are out."\r\n\r\nHe watched her down; he watched her in; himself shut the door. He knew\r\nshe was safe.\r\n\r\nThe hard work was done; now for the pleasure. He snatched his cap, and\r\naway for the wood.\r\n\r\nIt was yet but half-past three. It had been a fine morning, but the sky\r\nlooked dark now. It was beginning to snow; the wind blew cold; the wood\r\nlooked dismal, the old tree grim. Yet Martin approved the shadow on his\r\npath. He found a charm in the spectral aspect of the doddered oak.\r\n\r\nHe had to wait. To and fro he walked, while the flakes fell faster; and\r\nthe wind, which at first had but moaned, pitifully howled.\r\n\r\n"She is long in coming," he muttered, as he glanced along the narrow\r\ntrack. "I wonder," he subjoined, "what I wish to see her so much for?\r\nShe is not coming for me. But I have power over her, and I want her to\r\ncome that I may use that power."\r\n\r\nHe continued his walk.\r\n\r\n"Now," he resumed, when a further period had elapsed, "if she fails to\r\ncome, I shall hate and scorn her."\r\n\r\nIt struck four. He heard the church clock far away. A step so quick, so\r\nlight, that, but for the rustling of leaves, it would scarcely have\r\nsounded on the wood-walk, checked his impatience. The wind blew fiercely\r\nnow, and the thickening white storm waxed bewildering; but on she came,\r\nand not dismayed.\r\n\r\n"Well, Martin," she said eagerly, "how is he?"\r\n\r\n"It is queer how she thinks of _him_," reflected Martin. "The blinding\r\nsnow and bitter cold are nothing to her, I believe; yet she is but a\r\n\'chitty-faced creature,\' as my mother would say. I could find in my\r\nheart to wish I had a cloak to wrap her in."\r\n\r\nThus meditating to himself, he neglected to answer Miss Helstone.\r\n\r\n"You have seen him?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Oh! you promised you would."\r\n\r\n"I mean to do better by you than that. Didn\'t I say _I_ don\'t care to\r\nsee him?"\r\n\r\n"But now it will be so long before I get to know any thing certain about\r\nhim, and I am sick of waiting. Martin, _do_ see him, and give him\r\nCaroline Helstone\'s regards, and say she wished to know how he was, and\r\nif anything could be done for his comfort."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t."\r\n\r\n"You are changed. You were so friendly last night."\r\n\r\n"Come, we must not stand in this wood; it is too cold."\r\n\r\n"But before I go promise me to come again to-morrow with news."\r\n\r\n"No such thing. I am much too delicate to make and keep such\r\nappointments in the winter season. If you knew what a pain I had in my\r\nchest this morning, and how I went without breakfast, and was knocked\r\ndown besides, you\'d feel the impropriety of bringing me here in the\r\nsnow. Come, I say."\r\n\r\n"Are you really delicate, Martin?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I look so?"\r\n\r\n"You have rosy cheeks."\r\n\r\n"That\'s hectic. Will you come--or you won\'t?"\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"With me. I was a fool not to bring a cloak. I would have made you\r\ncosy."\r\n\r\n"You are going home; my nearest road lies in the opposite direction."\r\n\r\n"Put your arm through mine; I\'ll take care of you."\r\n\r\n"But the wall--the hedge--it is such hard work climbing, and you are too\r\nslender and young to help me without hurting yourself."\r\n\r\n"You shall go through the gate."\r\n\r\n"But----"\r\n\r\n"But, but--will you trust me or not?"\r\n\r\nShe looked into his face.\r\n\r\n"I think I will. Anything rather than return as anxious as I came."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t answer for that. This, however, I promise you: be ruled by me,\r\nand you shall see Moore yourself."\r\n\r\n"See him myself?"\r\n\r\n"Yourself."\r\n\r\n"But, dear Martin, does he know?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! I\'m dear now. No, he doesn\'t know."\r\n\r\n"And your mother and the others?"\r\n\r\n"All is right."\r\n\r\nCaroline fell into a long, silent fit of musing, but still she walked on\r\nwith her guide. They came in sight of Briarmains.\r\n\r\n"Have you made up your mind?" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe was silent.\r\n\r\n"Decide; we are just on the spot. I _won\'t_ see him--that I tell\r\nyou--except to announce your arrival."\r\n\r\n"Martin, you are a strange boy, and this is a strange step; but all I\r\nfeel _is_ and _has_ been, for a long time, strange. I will see him."\r\n\r\n"Having said that, you will neither hesitate nor retract?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Here we are, then. Do not be afraid of passing the parlour window; no\r\none will see you. My father and Matthew are at the mill, Mark is at\r\nschool, the servants are in the back kitchen, Miss Moore is at the\r\ncottage, my mother in her bed, and Mrs. Horsfall in paradise. Observe--I\r\nneed not ring. I open the door; the hall is empty, the staircase quiet;\r\nso is the gallery. The whole house and all its inhabitants are under a\r\nspell, which I will not break till you are gone."\r\n\r\n"Martin, I trust you."\r\n\r\n"You never said a better word. Let me take your shawl. I will shake off\r\nthe snow and dry it for you. You are cold and wet. Never mind; there is\r\na fire upstairs. Are you ready?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Follow me."\r\n\r\nHe left his shoes on the mat, mounted the stair unshod. Caroline stole\r\nafter, with noiseless step. There was a gallery, and there was a\r\npassage; at the end of that passage Martin paused before a door and\r\ntapped. He had to tap twice--thrice. A voice, known to one listener, at\r\nlast said, "Come in."\r\n\r\nThe boy entered briskly.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Moore, a lady called to inquire after you. None of the women were\r\nabout. It is washing-day, and the maids are over the crown of the head\r\nin soap-suds in the back kitchen, so I asked her to step up."\r\n\r\n"Up here, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Up here, sir; but if you object, she shall go down again."\r\n\r\n"Is this a place or am I a person to bring a lady to, you absurd lad?"\r\n\r\n"No; so I\'ll take her off."\r\n\r\n"Martin, you will stay here. Who is she?"\r\n\r\n"Your grandmother from that ch\xc3\xa2teau on the Scheldt Miss Moore talks\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"Martin," said the softest whisper at the door, "don\'t be foolish."\r\n\r\n"Is she there?" inquired Moore hastily. He had caught an imperfect\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n"She is there, fit to faint. She is standing on the mat, shocked at your\r\nwant of filial affection."\r\n\r\n"Martin, you are an evil cross between an imp and a page. What is she\r\nlike?"\r\n\r\n"More like me than you; for she is young and beautiful."\r\n\r\n"You are to show her forward. Do you hear?"\r\n\r\n"Come, Miss Caroline."\r\n\r\n"Miss Caroline!" repeated Moore.\r\n\r\nAnd when Miss Caroline entered she was encountered in the middle of the\r\nchamber by a tall, thin, wasted figure, who took both her hands.\r\n\r\n"I give you a quarter of an hour," said Martin, as he withdrew, "no\r\nmore. Say what you have to say in that time. Till it is past I will wait\r\nin the gallery; nothing shall approach; I\'ll see you safe away. Should\r\nyou persist in staying longer, I leave you to your fate."\r\n\r\nHe shut the door. In the gallery he was as elate as a king. He had never\r\nbeen engaged in an adventure he liked so well, for no adventure had ever\r\ninvested him with so much importance or inspired him with so much\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n"You are come at last," said the meagre man, gazing on his visitress\r\nwith hollow eyes.\r\n\r\n"Did you expect me before?"\r\n\r\n"For a month, near two months, we have been very near; and I have been\r\nin sad pain, and danger, and misery, Cary."\r\n\r\n"I could not come."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t you? But the rectory and Briarmains are very near--not two\r\nmiles apart."\r\n\r\nThere was pain and there was pleasure in the girl\'s face as she listened\r\nto these implied reproaches. It was sweet, it was bitter to defend\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n"When I say I could not come, I mean I could not see you; for I came\r\nwith mamma the very day we heard what had happened. Mr. MacTurk then\r\ntold us it was impossible to admit any stranger."\r\n\r\n"But afterwards--every fine afternoon these many weeks past I have\r\nwaited and listened. Something here, Cary"--laying his hand on his\r\nbreast--"told me it was impossible but that you should think of me. Not\r\nthat I merit thought; but we are old acquaintance--we are cousins."\r\n\r\n"I came again, Robert; mamma and I came again."\r\n\r\n"Did you? Come, that is worth hearing. Since you came again, we will sit\r\ndown and talk about it."\r\n\r\nThey sat down. Caroline drew her chair up to his. The air was now dark\r\nwith snow; an Iceland blast was driving it wildly. This pair neither\r\nheard the long "wuthering" rush, nor saw the white burden it drifted.\r\nEach seemed conscious but of one thing--the presence of the other.\r\n\r\n"So mamma and you came again?"\r\n\r\n"And Mrs. Yorke did treat us strangely. We asked to see you. \'No,\' said\r\nshe, \'not in my house. I am at present responsible for his life; it\r\nshall not be forfeited for half an hour\'s idle gossip.\' But I must not\r\ntell you all she said; it was very disagreeable. However, we came yet\r\nagain--mamma, Miss Keeldar, and I. This time we thought we should\r\nconquer, as we were three against one, and Shirley was on our side. But\r\nMrs. Yorke opened such a battery."\r\n\r\nMoore smiled. "What did she say?"\r\n\r\n"Things that astonished us. Shirley laughed at last; I cried; mamma was\r\nseriously annoyed. We were all three driven from the field. Since that\r\ntime I have only walked once a day past the house, just for the\r\nsatisfaction of looking up at your window, which I could distinguish by\r\nthe drawn curtains. I really dared not come in."\r\n\r\n"I _have_ wished for you, Caroline."\r\n\r\n"I did not know that; I never dreamt one instant that you thought of me.\r\nIf I had but most distantly imagined such a possibility----"\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Yorke would still have beaten you."\r\n\r\n"She would not. Stratagem should have been tried, if persuasion failed.\r\nI would have come to the kitchen door; the servants should have let me\r\nin, and I would have walked straight upstairs. In fact, it was far more\r\nthe fear of intrusion--the fear of yourself--that baffled me than the\r\nfear of Mrs. Yorke."\r\n\r\n"Only last night I despaired of ever seeing you again. Weakness has\r\nwrought terrible depression in me--terrible depression."\r\n\r\n"And you sit alone?"\r\n\r\n"Worse than alone."\r\n\r\n"But you must be getting better, since you can leave your bed?"\r\n\r\n"I doubt whether I shall live. I see nothing for it, after such\r\nexhaustion, but decline."\r\n\r\n"You--you shall go home to the Hollow."\r\n\r\n"Dreariness would accompany, nothing cheerful come near me."\r\n\r\n"I _will_ alter this. This _shall_ be altered, were there ten Mrs.\r\nYorkes to do battle with."\r\n\r\n"Cary, you make me smile."\r\n\r\n"Do smile; smile again. Shall I tell you what I should like?"\r\n\r\n"Tell me anything--only keep talking. I am Saul; but for music I should\r\nperish."\r\n\r\n"I should like you to be brought to the rectory, and given to me and\r\nmamma."\r\n\r\n"A precious gift! I have not laughed since they shot me till now."\r\n\r\n"Do you suffer pain, Robert?"\r\n\r\n"Not so much pain now; but I am hopelessly weak, and the state of my\r\nmind is inexpressible--dark, barren, impotent. Do you not read it all in\r\nmy face? I look a mere ghost."\r\n\r\n"Altered; yet I should have known you anywhere. But I understand your\r\nfeelings; I experienced something like it. Since we met, I too have been\r\nvery ill."\r\n\r\n"_Very_ ill?"\r\n\r\n"I thought I should die. The tale of my life seemed told. Every night,\r\njust at midnight, I used to wake from awful dreams; and the book lay\r\nopen before me at the last page, where was written \'Finis.\' I had\r\nstrange feelings."\r\n\r\n"You speak my experience."\r\n\r\n"I believed I should never see you again; and I grew so thin--as thin as\r\nyou are now. I could do nothing for myself--neither rise nor lie down;\r\nand I could not eat. Yet you see I am better."\r\n\r\n"Comforter--sad as sweet. I am too feeble to say what I feel; but while\r\nyou speak I _do_ feel."\r\n\r\n"Here I am at your side, where I thought never more to be. Here I speak\r\nto you. I see you listen to me willingly--look at me kindly. Did I count\r\non that? I despaired."\r\n\r\nMoore sighed--a sigh so deep it was nearly a groan. He covered his eyes\r\nwith his hand.\r\n\r\n"May I be spared to make some atonement."\r\n\r\nSuch was his prayer.\r\n\r\n"And for what?"\r\n\r\n"We will not touch on it now, Cary; unmanned as I am, I have not the\r\npower to cope with such a topic. Was Mrs. Pryor with you during your\r\nillness?"\r\n\r\n"Yes"--Caroline smiled brightly--"you know she is mamma?"\r\n\r\n"I have heard--Hortense told me; but that tale too I will receive from\r\nyourself. Does she add to your happiness?"\r\n\r\n"What! mamma? She is _dear_ to me; _how_ dear I cannot say. I was\r\naltogether weary, and she held me up."\r\n\r\n"I deserve to hear that in a moment when I can scarce lift my hand to my\r\nhead. I deserve it."\r\n\r\n"It is no reproach against you."\r\n\r\n"It is a coal of fire heaped on my head; and so is every word you\r\naddress to me, and every look that lights your sweet face. Come still\r\nnearer, Lina; and give me your hand--if my thin fingers do not scare\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nShe took those thin fingers between her two little hands; she bent her\r\nhead _et les effleura de ses l\xc3\xa8vres_. (I put that in French because the\r\nword _effleurer_ is an exquisite word.) Moore was much moved. A large\r\ntear or two coursed down his hollow cheek.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll keep these things in my heart, Cary; that kiss I will put by, and\r\nyou shall hear of it again one day."\r\n\r\n"Come out!" cried Martin, opening the door--"come away; you have had\r\ntwenty minutes instead of a quarter of an hour."\r\n\r\n"She will not stir yet, you hempseed."\r\n\r\n"I dare not stay longer, Robert."\r\n\r\n"Can you promise to return?"\r\n\r\n"No, she can\'t," responded Martin. "The thing mustn\'t become customary.\r\nI can\'t be troubled. It\'s very well for once; I\'ll not have it\r\nrepeated."\r\n\r\n"_You_\'ll not have it repeated."\r\n\r\n"Hush! don\'t vex him; we could not have met to-day but for him. But I\r\nwill come again, if it is your wish that I should come."\r\n\r\n"It _is_ my wish--my _one_ wish--almost the only wish I can feel."\r\n\r\n"Come this minute. My mother has coughed, got up, set her feet on the\r\nfloor. Let her only catch you on the stairs, Miss Caroline. You\'re not\r\nto bid him good-bye"--stepping between her and Moore--"you are to\r\nmarch."\r\n\r\n"My shawl, Martin."\r\n\r\n"I have it. I\'ll put it on for you when you are in the hall."\r\n\r\nHe made them part. He would suffer no farewell but what could be\r\nexpressed in looks. He half carried Caroline down the stairs. In the\r\nhall he wrapped her shawl round her, and, but that his mother\'s tread\r\nthen creaked in the gallery, and but that a sentiment of diffidence--the\r\nproper, natural, therefore the noble impulse of his boy\'s heart--held\r\nhim back, he would have claimed his reward; he would have said, "Now,\r\nMiss Caroline, for all this give me one kiss." But ere the words had\r\npassed his lips she was across the snowy road, rather skimming than\r\nwading the drifts.\r\n\r\n"She is my debtor, and I _will_ be paid."\r\n\r\nHe flattered himself that it was opportunity, not audacity, which had\r\nfailed him. He misjudged the quality of his own nature, and held it for\r\nsomething lower than it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nCASE OF DOMESTIC PERSECUTION--REMARKABLE INSTANCE OF PIOUS PERSEVERANCE\r\nIN THE DISCHARGE OF RELIGIOUS DUTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin, having known the taste of excitement, wanted a second draught;\r\nhaving felt the dignity of power, he loathed to relinquish it. Miss\r\nHelstone--that girl he had always called ugly, and whose face was now\r\nperpetually before his eyes, by day and by night, in dark and in\r\nsunshine--had once come within his sphere. It fretted him to think the\r\nvisit might never be repeated.\r\n\r\nThough a schoolboy he was no ordinary schoolboy; he was destined to grow\r\nup an original. At a few years\' later date he took great pains to pare\r\nand polish himself down to the pattern of the rest of the world, but he\r\nnever succeeded; an unique stamp marked him always. He now sat idle at\r\nhis desk in the grammar school, casting about in his mind for the means\r\nof adding another chapter to his commenced romance. He did not yet know\r\nhow many commenced life-romances are doomed never to get beyond the\r\nfirst, or at most the second chapter. His Saturday half-holiday he spent\r\nin the wood with his book of fairy legends, and that other unwritten\r\nbook of his imagination.\r\n\r\nMartin harboured an irreligious reluctance to see the approach of\r\nSunday. His father and mother, while disclaiming community with the\r\nEstablishment, failed not duly, once on the sacred day, to fill their\r\nlarge pew in Briarfield Church with the whole of their blooming family.\r\nTheoretically, Mr. Yorke placed all sects and churches on a level. Mrs.\r\nYorke awarded the palm to Moravians and Quakers, on account of that\r\ncrown of humility by these worthies worn. Neither of them were ever\r\nknown, however, to set foot in a conventicle.\r\n\r\nMartin, I say, disliked Sunday, because the morning service was long,\r\nand the sermon usually little to his taste. This Saturday afternoon,\r\nhowever, his woodland musings disclosed to him a new-found charm in the\r\ncoming day.\r\n\r\nIt proved a day of deep snow--so deep that Mrs. Yorke during breakfast\r\nannounced her conviction that the children, both boys and girls, would\r\nbe better at home; and her decision that, instead of going to church,\r\nthey should sit silent for two hours in the back parlour, while Rose and\r\nMartin alternately read a succession of sermons--John Wesley\'s\r\n"Sermons." John Wesley, being a reformer and an agitator, had a place\r\nboth in her own and her husband\'s favour.\r\n\r\n"Rose will do as she pleases," said Martin, not looking up from the book\r\nwhich, according to his custom then and in after-life, he was studying\r\nover his bread and milk.\r\n\r\n"Rose will do as she is told, and Martin too," observed the mother.\r\n\r\n"I am going to church."\r\n\r\nSo her son replied, with the ineffable quietude of a true Yorke, who\r\nknows his will and means to have it, and who, if pushed to the wall,\r\nwill let himself be crushed to death, provided no way of escape can be\r\nfound, but will never capitulate.\r\n\r\n"It is not fit weather," said the father.\r\n\r\nNo answer. The youth read studiously; he slowly broke his bread and\r\nsipped his milk.\r\n\r\n"Martin hates to go to church, but he hates still more to obey," said\r\nMrs. Yorke.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I am influenced by pure perverseness?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you are."\r\n\r\n"Mother, _I am not_."\r\n\r\n"By what, then, are you influenced?"\r\n\r\n"By a complication of motives, the intricacies of which I should as soon\r\nthink of explaining to you as I should of turning myself inside out to\r\nexhibit the internal machinery of my frame."\r\n\r\n"Hear Martin! hear him!" cried Mr. Yorke. "I must see and have this lad\r\nof mine brought up to the bar. Nature meant him to live by his tongue.\r\nHesther, your third son must certainly be a lawyer; he has the\r\nstock-in-trade--brass, self-conceit, and words--words--words."\r\n\r\n"Some bread, Rose, if you please," requested Martin, with intense\r\ngravity, serenity, phlegm. The boy had naturally a low, plaintive voice,\r\nwhich in his "dour moods" rose scarcely above a lady\'s whisper. The more\r\ninflexibly stubborn the humour, the softer, the sadder the tone. He\r\nrang the bell, and gently asked for his walking-shoes.\r\n\r\n"But, Martin," urged his sire, "there is drift all the way; a man could\r\nhardly wade through it. However, lad," he continued, seeing that the boy\r\nrose as the church bell began to toll, "this is a case wherein I would\r\nby no means balk the obdurate chap of his will. Go to church by all\r\nmeans. There is a pitiless wind, and a sharp, frozen sleet, besides the\r\ndepth under foot. Go out into it, since thou prefers it to a warm\r\nfireside."\r\n\r\nMartin quietly assumed his cloak, comforter, and cap, and deliberately\r\nwent out.\r\n\r\n"My father has more sense than my mother," he pronounced. "How women\r\nmiss it! They drive the nail into the flesh, thinking they are hammering\r\naway at insensate stone."\r\n\r\nHe reached church early.\r\n\r\n"Now, if the weather frightens her (and it is a real December tempest),\r\nor if that Mrs. Pryor objects to her going out, and I should miss her\r\nafter all, it will vex me; but, tempest or tornado, hail or ice, she\r\n_ought_ to come, and if she has a mind worthy of her eyes and features\r\nshe _will_ come. She will be here for the chance of seeing me, as I am\r\nhere for the chance of seeing her. She will want to get a word\r\nrespecting her confounded sweetheart, as I want to get another flavour\r\nof what I think the essence of life--a taste of existence, with the\r\nspirit preserved in it, and not evaporated. Adventure is to stagnation\r\nwhat champagne is to flat porter."\r\n\r\nHe looked round. The church was cold, silent, empty, but for one old\r\nwoman. As the chimes subsided and the single bell tolled slowly, another\r\nand another elderly parishioner came dropping in, and took a humble\r\nstation in the free sittings. It is always the frailest, the oldest, and\r\nthe poorest that brave the worst weather, to prove and maintain their\r\nconstancy to dear old mother church. This wild morning not one affluent\r\nfamily attended, not one carriage party appeared--all the lined and\r\ncushioned pews were empty; only on the bare oaken seats sat ranged the\r\ngray-haired elders and feeble paupers.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll scorn her if she doesn\'t come," muttered Martin, shortly and\r\nsavagely, to himself. The rector\'s shovel-hat had passed the porch. Mr.\r\nHelstone and his clerk were in the vestry.\r\n\r\nThe bells ceased--the reading-desk was filled--the doors were\r\nclosed--the service commenced. Void stood the rectory pew--she was not\r\nthere. Martin scorned her.\r\n\r\n"Worthless thing! vapid thing! commonplace humbug! Like all other\r\ngirls--weakly, selfish, shallow!"\r\n\r\nSuch was Martin\'s liturgy.\r\n\r\n"She is not like our picture. Her eyes are not large and expressive; her\r\nnose is not straight, delicate, Hellenic; her mouth has not that charm I\r\nthought it had, which I imagined could beguile me of sullenness in my\r\nworst moods. What is she? A thread-paper, a doll, a toy, a _girl_, in\r\nshort."\r\n\r\nSo absorbed was the young cynic he forgot to rise from his knees at the\r\nproper place, and was still in an exemplary attitude of devotion when,\r\nthe litany over, the first hymn was given out. To be so caught did not\r\ncontribute to soothe him. He started up red (for he was as sensitive to\r\nridicule as any girl). To make the matter worse, the church door had\r\nreopened, and the aisles were filling: patter, patter, patter, a hundred\r\nlittle feet trotted in. It was the Sunday scholars. According to\r\nBriarfield winter custom, these children had till now been kept where\r\nthere was a warm stove, and only led into church just before the\r\ncommunion and sermon.\r\n\r\nThe little ones were settled first, and at last, when the boys and the\r\nyounger girls were all arranged--when the organ was swelling high, and\r\nthe choir and congregation were rising to uplift a spiritual song--a\r\ntall class of young women came quietly in, closing the procession. Their\r\nteacher, having seen them seated, passed into the rectory pew. The\r\nFrench-gray cloak and small beaver bonnet were known to Martin; it was\r\nthe very costume his eyes had ached to catch. Miss Helstone had not\r\nsuffered the storm to prove an impediment. After all, she was come to\r\nchurch. Martin probably whispered his satisfaction to his hymn book; at\r\nany rate, he therewith hid his face two minutes.\r\n\r\nSatisfied or not, he had time to get very angry with her again before\r\nthe sermon was over. She had never once looked his way; at least he had\r\nnot been so lucky as to encounter a glance.\r\n\r\n"If," he said--"if she takes no notice of me, if she shows I am not in\r\nher thoughts, I shall have a worse, a meaner opinion of her than ever.\r\nMost despicable would it be to come for the sake of those sheep-faced\r\nSunday scholars, and not for my sake or that long skeleton Moore\'s."\r\n\r\nThe sermon found an end; the benediction was pronounced; the\r\ncongregation dispersed. She had not been near him.\r\n\r\nNow, indeed, as Martin set his face homeward, he felt that the sleet was\r\nsharp and the east wind cold.\r\n\r\nHis nearest way lay through some fields. It was a dangerous, because an\r\nuntrodden way. He did not care; he would take it. Near the second stile\r\nrose a clump of trees. Was that an umbrella waiting there? Yes, an\r\numbrella, held with evident difficulty against the blast; behind it\r\nfluttered a French-gray cloak. Martin grinned as he toiled up the steep,\r\nencumbered field, difficult to the foot as a slope in the upper realms\r\nof Etna. There was an inimitable look in his face when, having gained\r\nthe stile, he seated himself coolly thereupon, and thus opened a\r\nconference which, for his own part, he was willing to prolong\r\nindefinitely.\r\n\r\n"I think you had better strike a bargain. Exchange me for Mrs. Pryor."\r\n\r\n"I was not sure whether you would come this way, Martin, but I thought I\r\nwould run the chance. There is no such thing as getting a quiet word\r\nspoken in the church or churchyard."\r\n\r\n"Will you agree?--make over Mrs. Pryor to my mother, and put me in her\r\nskirts?"\r\n\r\n"As if I could understand you! What puts Mrs. Pryor into your head?"\r\n\r\n"You call her \'mamma,\' don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"She _is_ my mamma."\r\n\r\n"Not possible--or so inefficient, so careless a mamma; I should make a\r\nfive times better one. You _may_ laugh. I have no objection to see you\r\nlaugh. Your teeth--I hate ugly teeth; but yours are as pretty as a pearl\r\nnecklace, and a necklace of which the pearls are very fair, even, and\r\nwell matched too."\r\n\r\n"Martin, what now? I thought the Yorkes never paid compliments?"\r\n\r\n"They have not done till this generation; but I feel as if it were my\r\nvocation to turn out a new variety of the Yorke species. I am rather\r\ntired of my own ancestors. We have traditions going back for four\r\nages--tales of Hiram, which was the son of Hiram, which was the son of\r\nSamuel, which was the son of John, which was the son of Zerubbabel\r\nYorke. All, from Zerubbabel down to the last Hiram, were such as you see\r\nmy father. Before that there was a Godfrey. We have his picture; it\r\nhangs in Moore\'s bedroom; it is like me. Of his character we know\r\nnothing; but I am sure it was different to his descendants. He has long,\r\ncurling dark hair; he is carefully and cavalierly dressed. Having said\r\nthat he is like me, I need not add that he is handsome."\r\n\r\n"You are not handsome, Martin."\r\n\r\n"No; but wait awhile--just let me take my time. I mean to begin from\r\nthis day to cultivate, to polish, and we shall see."\r\n\r\n"You are a very strange, a very unaccountable boy, Martin. But don\'t\r\nimagine you ever will be handsome; you cannot."\r\n\r\n"I mean to try. But we were talking about Mrs. Pryor. She must be the\r\nmost unnatural mamma in existence, coolly to let her daughter come out\r\nin this weather. Mine was in such a rage because I would go to church;\r\nshe was fit to fling the kitchen brush after me."\r\n\r\n"Mamma was very much concerned about me; but I am afraid I was\r\nobstinate. I _would_ go."\r\n\r\n"To see me?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly; I thought of nothing else. I greatly feared the snow would\r\nhinder you from coming. You don\'t know how pleased I was to see you all\r\nby yourself in the pew."\r\n\r\n"_I_ came to fulfil my duty, and set the parish a good example. And so\r\nyou were obstinate, were you? I should like to see you obstinate, I\r\nshould. Wouldn\'t I have you in good discipline if I owned you? Let me\r\ntake the umbrella."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t stay two minutes; our dinner will be ready."\r\n\r\n"And so will ours; and we have always a hot dinner on Sundays. Roast\r\ngoose to-day, with apple-pie and rice-pudding. I always contrive to know\r\nthe bill of fare. Well, I like these things uncommonly; but I\'ll make\r\nthe sacrifice, if you will."\r\n\r\n"We have a cold dinner. My uncle will allow no unnecessary cooking on\r\nthe Sabbath. But I must return; the house would be in commotion if I\r\nfailed to appear."\r\n\r\n"So will Briarmains, bless you! I think I hear my father sending out the\r\noverlooker and five of the dyers, to look in six directions for the body\r\nof his prodigal son in the snow; and my mother repenting her of her\r\nmany misdeeds towards me, now I am gone."\r\n\r\n"Martin, how is Mr. Moore?"\r\n\r\n"_That_ is what you came for, just to say that word."\r\n\r\n"Come, tell me quickly."\r\n\r\n"Hang him! he is no worse; but as ill-used as ever--mewed up, kept in\r\nsolitary confinement. They mean to make either an idiot or a maniac of\r\nhim, and take out a commission of lunacy. Horsfall starves him; you saw\r\nhow thin he was."\r\n\r\n"You were very good the other day, Martin."\r\n\r\n"What day? I am always good--a model."\r\n\r\n"When will you be so good again?"\r\n\r\n"I see what you are after; but you\'ll not wheedle me--I am no\r\ncat\'s-paw."\r\n\r\n"But it must be done. It is quite a right thing, and a necessary thing."\r\n\r\n"How you encroach! Remember, I managed the matter of my own free will\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\n"And you will again."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t. The business gave me far too much trouble. I like my ease."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Moore wishes to see me, Martin, and I wish to see him."\r\n\r\n"I dare say" (coolly).\r\n\r\n"It is too bad of your mother to exclude his friends."\r\n\r\n"Tell her so."\r\n\r\n"His own relations."\r\n\r\n"Come and blow her up."\r\n\r\n"You know that would advance nothing. Well, I shall stick to my point.\r\nSee him I will. If you won\'t help me, I\'ll manage without help."\r\n\r\n"Do; there is nothing like self-reliance, self-dependence."\r\n\r\n"I have no time to reason with you now; but I consider you provoking.\r\nGood-morning."\r\n\r\nAway she went, the umbrella shut, for she could not carry it against the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\n"She is not vapid; she is not shallow," said Martin. "I shall like to\r\nwatch, and mark how she will work her way without help. If the storm\r\nwere not of snow, but of fire--such as came refreshingly down on the\r\ncities of the plain--she would go through it to procure five minutes\'\r\nspeech of that Moore. Now, I consider I have had a pleasant morning.\r\nThe disappointments got time on; the fears and fits of anger only made\r\nthat short discourse pleasanter, when it came at last. She expected to\r\ncoax me at once. She\'ll not manage that in one effort. She shall come\r\nagain, again, and yet again. It would please me to put her in a\r\npassion--to make her cry. I want to discover how far she will go--what\r\nshe will do and dare--to get her will. It seems strange and new to find\r\none human being thinking so much about another as she thinks about\r\nMoore. But it is time to go home; my appetite tells me the hour. Won\'t I\r\nwalk into that goose? and we\'ll try whether Matthew or I shall get the\r\nlargest cut of the apple-pie to-day."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nWHEREIN MATTERS MAKE SOME PROGRESS, BUT NOT MUCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin had planned well. He had laid out a dexterously concerted scheme\r\nfor his private amusement. But older and wiser schemers than he are\r\noften doomed to see their finest-spun projects swept to annihilation by\r\nthe sudden broom of Fate, that fell housewife whose red arm none can\r\ncontrol. In the present instance this broom was manufactured out of the\r\ntough fibres of Moore\'s own stubborn purpose, bound tight with his will.\r\nHe was now resuming his strength, and making strange head against Mrs.\r\nHorsfall. Each morning he amazed that matron with a fresh astonishment.\r\nFirst he discharged her from her valet duties; he would dress himself.\r\nThen he refused the coffee she brought him; he would breakfast with the\r\nfamily. Lastly, he forbade her his chamber. On the same day, amidst the\r\noutcries of all the women in the place, he put his head out of doors.\r\nThe morning after, he followed Mr. Yorke to his counting-house, and\r\nrequested an envoy to fetch a chaise from the Red House Inn. He was\r\nresolved, he said, to return home to the Hollow that very afternoon. Mr.\r\nYorke, instead of opposing, aided and abetted him. The chaise was sent\r\nfor, though Mrs. Yorke declared the step would be his death. It came.\r\nMoore, little disposed to speak, made his purse do duty for his tongue.\r\nHe expressed his gratitude to the servants and to Mrs. Horsfall by the\r\nchink of his coin. The latter personage approved and understood this\r\nlanguage perfectly; it made amends for all previous contumacy. She and\r\nher patient parted the best friends in the world.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen visited and soothed, Moore betook himself to the parlour. He\r\nhad Mrs. Yorke to appease; not quite so easy a task as the pacification\r\nof her housemaids. There she sat plunged in sullen dudgeon, the\r\ngloomiest speculations on the depths of man\'s ingratitude absorbing her\r\nthoughts. He drew near and bent over her; she was obliged to look up,\r\nif it were only to bid him "avaunt." There was beauty still in his pale,\r\nwasted features; there was earnestness and a sort of sweetness--for he\r\nwas smiling--in his hollow eyes.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye!" he said, and as he spoke the smile glittered and melted. He\r\nhad no iron mastery of his sensations now; a trifling emotion made\r\nitself apparent in his present weak state.\r\n\r\n"And what are you going to leave us for?" she asked. "We will keep you,\r\nand do anything in the world for you, if you will only stay till you are\r\nstronger."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye!" he again said; and added, "You have been a mother to me;\r\ngive your wilful son one embrace."\r\n\r\nLike a foreigner, as he was, he offered her first one cheek, then the\r\nother. She kissed him.\r\n\r\n"What a trouble--what a burden I have been to you!" he muttered.\r\n\r\n"You are the worst trouble now, headstrong youth!" was the answer. "I\r\nwonder who is to nurse you at Hollow\'s Cottage? Your sister Hortense\r\nknows no more about such matters than a child."\r\n\r\n"Thank God! for I have had nursing enough to last me my life."\r\n\r\nHere the little girls came in--Jessie crying, Rose quiet but grave.\r\nMoore took them out into the hall to soothe, pet, and kiss them. He knew\r\nit was not in their mother\'s nature to bear to see any living thing\r\ncaressed but herself. She would have felt annoyed had he fondled a\r\nkitten in her presence.\r\n\r\nThe boys were standing about the chaise as Moore entered it; but for\r\nthem he had no farewell. To Mr. Yorke he only said, "You have a good\r\nriddance of me. That was an unlucky shot for you, Yorke; it turned\r\nBriarmains into an hospital. Come and see me at the cottage soon."\r\n\r\nHe drew up the glass; the chaise rolled away. In half an hour he\r\nalighted at his own garden wicket. Having paid the driver and dismissed\r\nthe vehicle, he leaned on that wicket an instant, at once to rest and to\r\nmuse.\r\n\r\n"Six months ago I passed out at this gate," said he, "a proud, angry,\r\ndisappointed man. I come back sadder and wiser; weakly enough, but not\r\nworried. A cold, gray, yet quiet world lies round--a world where, if I\r\nhope little, I fear nothing. All slavish terrors of embarrassment have\r\nleft me. Let the worst come, I can work, as Joe Scott does, for an\r\nhonourable living; in such doom I yet see some hardship but no\r\ndegradation. Formerly, pecuniary ruin was equivalent in my eyes to\r\npersonal dishonour. It is not so now; I know the difference. Ruin _is_\r\nan evil, but one for which I am prepared; the day of whose coming I\r\nknow, for I have calculated. I can yet put it off six months--not an\r\nhour longer. If things by that time alter, which is not probable; if\r\nfetters, which now seem indissoluble, should be loosened from our trade\r\n(of all things the most unlikely to happen), I might conquer in this\r\nlong struggle yet--I might--good God! what might I not do? But the\r\nthought is a brief madness; let me see things with sane eyes. Ruin will\r\ncome, lay her axe to my fortune\'s roots, and hew them down. I shall\r\nsnatch a sapling, I shall cross the sea, and plant it in American woods.\r\nLouis will go with me. Will none but Louis go? I cannot tell--I have no\r\nright to ask."\r\n\r\nHe entered the house.\r\n\r\nIt was afternoon, twilight yet out of doors--starless and moonless\r\ntwilight; for though keenly freezing with a dry, black frost, heaven\r\nwore a mask of clouds congealed and fast locked. The mill-dam too was\r\nfrozen. The Hollow was very still. Indoors it was already dark. Sarah\r\nhad lit a good fire in the parlour; she was preparing tea in the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n"Hortense," said Moore, as his sister bustled up to help him off with\r\nhis cloak, "I am pleased to come home."\r\n\r\nHortense did not feel the peculiar novelty of this expression coming\r\nfrom her brother, who had never before called the cottage his home, and\r\nto whom its narrow limits had always heretofore seemed rather\r\nrestrictive than protective. Still, whatever contributed to his\r\nhappiness pleased her, and she expressed herself to that effect.\r\n\r\nHe sat down, but soon rose again. He went to the window; he came back to\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n"Hortense!"\r\n\r\n"Mon fr\xc3\xa8re?"\r\n\r\n"This little parlour looks very clean and pleasant--unusually bright,\r\nsomehow."\r\n\r\n"It is true, brother; I have had the whole house thoroughly and\r\nscrupulously cleaned in your absence."\r\n\r\n"Sister, I think on this first day of your return home you ought to have\r\na friend or so to tea, if it were only to see how fresh and spruce you\r\nhave made the little place."\r\n\r\n"True, brother. If it were not late I might send for Miss Mann."\r\n\r\n"So you might; but it really is too late to disturb that good lady, and\r\nthe evening is much too cold for her to come out."\r\n\r\n"How thoughtful in you, dear G\xc3\xa9rard! We must put it off till another\r\nday."\r\n\r\n"I want some one to-day, dear sister--some quiet guest, who would tire\r\nneither of us."\r\n\r\n"Miss Ainley?"\r\n\r\n"An excellent person, they say; but she lives too far off. Tell Harry\r\nScott to step up to the rectory with a request from you that Caroline\r\nHelstone should come and spend the evening with you."\r\n\r\n"Would it not be better to-morrow, dear brother?"\r\n\r\n"I should like her to see the place as it is just now; its brilliant\r\ncleanliness and perfect neatness are so much to your credit."\r\n\r\n"It might benefit her in the way of example."\r\n\r\n"It might and must; she ought to come."\r\n\r\nHe went into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n"Sarah, delay tea half an hour." He then commissioned her to dispatch\r\nHarry Scott to the rectory, giving her a twisted note hastily scribbled\r\nin pencil by himself, and addressed "Miss Helstone."\r\n\r\nScarcely had Sarah time to get impatient under the fear of damage to her\r\ntoast already prepared when the messenger returned, and with him the\r\ninvited guest.\r\n\r\nShe entered through the kitchen, quietly tripped up Sarah\'s stairs to\r\ntake off her bonnet and furs, and came down as quietly, with her\r\nbeautiful curls nicely smoothed, her graceful merino dress and delicate\r\ncollar all trim and spotless, her gay little work-bag in her hand. She\r\nlingered to exchange a few kindly words with Sarah, and to look at the\r\nnew tortoise-shell kitten basking on the kitchen hearth, and to speak to\r\nthe canary-bird, which a sudden blaze from the fire had startled on its\r\nperch; and then she betook herself to the parlour.\r\n\r\nThe gentle salutation, the friendly welcome, were interchanged in such\r\ntranquil sort as befitted cousins meeting; a sense of pleasure, subtle\r\nand quiet as a perfume, diffused itself through the room; the\r\nnewly-kindled lamp burnt up bright; the tray and the singing urn were\r\nbrought in.\r\n\r\n"I am pleased to come home," repeated Mr. Moore.\r\n\r\nThey assembled round the table. Hortense chiefly talked. She\r\ncongratulated Caroline on the evident improvement in her health. Her\r\ncolour and her plump cheeks were returning, she remarked. It was true.\r\nThere was an obvious change in Miss Helstone. All about her seemed\r\nelastic; depression, fear, forlornness, were withdrawn. No longer\r\ncrushed, and saddened, and slow, and drooping, she looked like one who\r\nhad tasted the cordial of heart\'s ease, and been lifted on the wing of\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nAfter tea Hortense went upstairs. She had not rummaged her drawers for a\r\nmonth past, and the impulse to perform that operation was now become\r\nresistless. During her absence the talk passed into Caroline\'s hands.\r\nShe took it up with ease; she fell into her best tone of conversation. A\r\npleasing facility and elegance of language gave fresh charm to familiar\r\ntopics; a new music in the always soft voice gently surprised and\r\npleasingly captivated the listener; unwonted shades and lights of\r\nexpression elevated the young countenance with character, and kindled it\r\nwith animation.\r\n\r\n"Caroline, you look as if you had heard good tidings," said Moore, after\r\nearnestly gazing at her for some minutes.\r\n\r\n"Do I?"\r\n\r\n"I sent for you this evening that I might be cheered; but you cheer me\r\nmore than I had calculated."\r\n\r\n"I am glad of that. And I _really_ cheer you?"\r\n\r\n"You look brightly, move buoyantly, speak musically."\r\n\r\n"It is pleasant to be here again."\r\n\r\n"Truly it is pleasant; I feel it so. And to see health on your cheek and\r\nhope in your eye is pleasant, Cary; but what is this hope, and what is\r\nthe source of this sunshine I perceive about you?"\r\n\r\n"For one thing, I am happy in mamma. I love her so much, and she loves\r\nme. Long and tenderly she nursed me. Now, when her care has made me\r\nwell, I can occupy myself for and with her all the day. I say it is my\r\nturn to attend to her; and I _do_ attend to her. I am her waiting-woman\r\nas well as her child. I like--you would laugh if you knew what pleasure\r\nI have in making dresses and sewing for her. She looks so nice now,\r\nRobert; I will not let her be old-fashioned. And then, she is charming\r\nto talk to--full of wisdom, ripe in judgment, rich in information,\r\nexhaustless in stores her observant faculties have quietly amassed.\r\nEvery day that I live with her I like her better, I esteem her more\r\nhighly, I love her more tenderly."\r\n\r\n"_That_ for one thing, then, Cary. You talk in such a way about \'mamma\'\r\nit is enough to make one jealous of the old lady."\r\n\r\n"She is not old, Robert."\r\n\r\n"Of the young lady, then."\r\n\r\n"She does not pretend to be young."\r\n\r\n"Well, of the matron. But you said \'mamma\'s\' affection was _one_ thing\r\nthat made you happy; now for the other thing."\r\n\r\n"I am glad you are better."\r\n\r\n"What besides?"\r\n\r\n"I am glad we are friends."\r\n\r\n"You and I?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I once thought we never should be."\r\n\r\n"Cary, some day I mean to tell you a thing about myself that is not to\r\nmy credit, and consequently will not please you."\r\n\r\n"Ah, don\'t! I cannot bear to think ill of you."\r\n\r\n"And I cannot bear that you should think better of me than I deserve."\r\n\r\n"Well, but I half know your \'thing;\' indeed, I believe I know all about\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"You do not."\r\n\r\n"I believe I do."\r\n\r\n"Whom does it concern besides me?"\r\n\r\nShe coloured; she hesitated; she was silent.\r\n\r\n"Speak, Cary! Whom does it concern?"\r\n\r\nShe tried to utter a name, and could not.\r\n\r\n"Tell me; there is none present but ourselves. Be frank."\r\n\r\n"But if I guess wrong?"\r\n\r\n"I will forgive. Whisper, Cary."\r\n\r\nHe bent his ear to her lips. Still she would not, or could not, speak\r\nclearly to the point. Seeing that Moore waited and was resolved to hear\r\nsomething, she at last said, "Miss Keeldar spent a day at the rectory\r\nabout a week since. The evening came on very wintry, and we persuaded\r\nher to stay all night."\r\n\r\n"And you and she curled your hair together?"\r\n\r\n"How do you know that?"\r\n\r\n"And then you chattered, and she told you----"\r\n\r\n"It was not at curling-hair time, so you are not as wise as you think;\r\nand, besides, she didn\'t tell me."\r\n\r\n"You slept together afterwards?"\r\n\r\n"We occupied the same room and bed. We did not sleep much; we talked the\r\nwhole night through."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be sworn you did! And then it all came out--_tant pis_. I would\r\nrather you had heard it from myself."\r\n\r\n"You are quite wrong. She did not tell me what you suspect--she is not\r\nthe person to proclaim such things; but yet I inferred something from\r\nparts of her discourse. I gathered more from rumour, and I made out the\r\nrest by instinct."\r\n\r\n"But if she did not tell you that I wanted to marry her for the sake of\r\nher money, and that she refused me indignantly and scornfully (you need\r\nneither start nor blush; nor yet need you prick your trembling fingers\r\nwith your needle. That is the plain truth, whether you like it or\r\nnot)--if such was not the subject of her august confidences, on what\r\npoint did they turn? You say you talked the whole night through; what\r\nabout?"\r\n\r\n"About things we never thoroughly discussed before, intimate friends as\r\nwe have been; but you hardly expect I should tell you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, Cary; you will tell me. You said we were friends, and friends\r\nshould always confide in each other."\r\n\r\n"But you are sure you won\'t repeat it?"\r\n\r\n"Quite sure."\r\n\r\n"Not to Louis?"\r\n\r\n"Not even to Louis. What does Louis care for young ladies\' secrets?"\r\n\r\n"Robert, Shirley is a curious, magnanimous being."\r\n\r\n"I dare say. I can imagine there are both odd points and grand points\r\nabout her."\r\n\r\n"I have found her chary in showing her feelings; but when they rush out,\r\nriver-like, and pass full and powerful before you--almost without leave\r\nfrom her--you gaze, wonder; you admire, and--I think--love her."\r\n\r\n"You saw this spectacle?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; at dead of night, when all the house was silent, and starlight and\r\nthe cold reflection from the snow glimmered in our chamber, then I saw\r\nShirley\'s heart."\r\n\r\n"Her heart\'s core? Do you think she showed you that?"\r\n\r\n"Her heart\'s core."\r\n\r\n"And how was it?"\r\n\r\n"Like a shrine, for it was holy; like snow, for it was pure; like\r\nflame, for it was warm; like death, for it was strong."\r\n\r\n"Can she love? tell me that."\r\n\r\n"What think you?"\r\n\r\n"She has loved none that have loved her yet."\r\n\r\n"Who are those that have loved her?"\r\n\r\nHe named a list of gentlemen, closing with Sir Philip Nunnely.\r\n\r\n"She has loved none of these."\r\n\r\n"Yet some of them were worthy of a woman\'s affection."\r\n\r\n"Of some women\'s, but not of Shirley\'s."\r\n\r\n"Is she better than others of her sex?"\r\n\r\n"She is peculiar, and more dangerous to take as a wife--rashly."\r\n\r\n"I can imagine that."\r\n\r\n"She spoke of you----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, she did! I thought you denied it."\r\n\r\n"She did not speak in the way you fancy; but I asked her, and I would\r\nmake her tell me what she thought of you, or rather how she felt towards\r\nyou. I wanted to know; I had long wanted to know."\r\n\r\n"So had I; but let us hear. She thinks meanly, she feels contemptuously,\r\ndoubtless?"\r\n\r\n"She thinks of you almost as highly as a woman can think of a man. You\r\nknow she can be eloquent. I yet feel in fancy the glow of the language\r\nin which her opinion was conveyed."\r\n\r\n"But how does she feel?"\r\n\r\n"Till you shocked her (she said you had shocked her, but she would not\r\ntell me how) she felt as a sister feels towards a brother of whom she is\r\nat once fond and proud."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll shock her no more, Cary, for the shock rebounded on myself till I\r\nstaggered again. But that comparison about sister and brother is all\r\nnonsense. She is too rich and proud to entertain fraternal sentiments\r\nfor me."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know her, Robert; and, somehow, I fancy now (I had other\r\nideas formerly) that you cannot know her. You and she are not so\r\nconstructed as to be able thoroughly to understand each other."\r\n\r\n"It may be so. I esteem her, I admire her; and yet my impressions\r\nconcerning her are harsh--perhaps uncharitable. I believe, for instance,\r\nthat she is incapable of love----"\r\n\r\n"Shirley incapable of love!"\r\n\r\n"That she will never marry. I imagine her jealous of compromising her\r\npride, of relinquishing her power, of sharing her property."\r\n\r\n"Shirley has hurt your _amour propre_."\r\n\r\n"She did hurt it; though I had not an emotion of tenderness, nor a spark\r\nof passion for her."\r\n\r\n"Then, Robert, it was very wicked in you to want to marry her."\r\n\r\n"And very mean, my little pastor, my pretty priestess. I never wanted to\r\nkiss Miss Keeldar in my life, though she has fine lips, scarlet and\r\nround as ripe cherries; or, if I did wish it, it was the mere desire of\r\nthe eye."\r\n\r\n"I doubt, now, whether you are speaking the truth. The grapes or the\r\ncherries are sour--\'hung too high.\'"\r\n\r\n"She has a pretty figure, a pretty face, beautiful hair. I acknowledge\r\nall her charms and feel none of them, or only feel them in a way she\r\nwould disdain. I suppose I was truly tempted by the mere gilding of the\r\nbait. Caroline, what a noble fellow your Robert is--great, good,\r\ndisinterested, and then so pure!"\r\n\r\n"But not perfect. He made a great blunder once, and we will hear no more\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"And shall we think no more about it, Cary? Shall we not despise him in\r\nour heart--gentle but just, compassionate but upright?"\r\n\r\n"Never! We will remember that with what measure we mete it shall be\r\nmeasured unto us, and so we will give no scorn, only affection."\r\n\r\n"Which won\'t satisfy, I warn you of that. Something besides\r\naffection--something far stronger, sweeter, warmer--will be demanded one\r\nday. Is it there to give?"\r\n\r\nCaroline was moved, much moved.\r\n\r\n"Be calm, Lina," said Moore soothingly. "I have no intention, because I\r\nhave no right, to perturb your mind now, nor for months to come. Don\'t\r\nlook as if you would leave me. We will make no more agitating allusions;\r\nwe will resume our gossip. Do not tremble; look me in the face. See what\r\na poor, pale, grim phantom I am--more pitiable than formidable."\r\n\r\nShe looked shyly. "There is something formidable still, pale as you\r\nare," she said, as her eye fell under his.\r\n\r\n"To return to Shirley," pursued Moore: "is it your opinion that she is\r\never likely to marry?"\r\n\r\n"She loves."\r\n\r\n"Platonically--theoretically--all humbug!"\r\n\r\n"She loves what I call sincerely."\r\n\r\n"Did she say so?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot affirm that she said so. No such confession as \'I love this\r\nman or that\' passed her lips."\r\n\r\n"I thought not."\r\n\r\n"But the feeling made its way in spite of her, and I saw it. She spoke\r\nof one man in a strain not to be misunderstood. Her voice alone was\r\nsufficient testimony. Having wrung from her an opinion on your\r\ncharacter, I demanded a second opinion of--another person about whom I\r\nhad my conjectures, though they were the most tangled and puzzled\r\nconjectures in the world. I would _make_ her speak. I shook her, I chid\r\nher, I pinched her fingers when she tried to put me off with gibes and\r\njests in her queer provoking way, and at last out it came. The voice, I\r\nsay, was enough; hardly raised above a whisper, and yet such a soft\r\nvehemence in its tones. There was no confession, no confidence, in the\r\nmatter. To these things she cannot condescend; but I am sure that man\'s\r\nhappiness is dear to her as her own life."\r\n\r\n"Who is it?"\r\n\r\n"I charged her with the fact. She did not deny, she did not avow, but\r\nlooked at me. I saw her eyes by the snow-gleam. It was quite enough. I\r\ntriumphed over her mercilessly."\r\n\r\n"What right had _you_ to triumph? Do you mean to say _you_ are fancy\r\nfree?"\r\n\r\n"Whatever _I_ am, Shirley is a bondswoman. Lioness, she has found her\r\ncaptor. Mistress she may be of all round her, but her own mistress she\r\nis not."\r\n\r\n"So you exulted at recognizing a fellow-slave in one so fair and\r\nimperial?"\r\n\r\n"I did; Robert, you say right, in one so fair and imperial."\r\n\r\n"You confess it--a _fellow_-slave?"\r\n\r\n"I confess nothing; but I say that haughty Shirley is no more free than\r\nwas Hagar."\r\n\r\n"And who, pray, is the Abraham, the hero of a patriarch who has achieved\r\nsuch a conquest?"\r\n\r\n"You still speak scornfully, and cynically, and sorely; but I will make\r\nyou change your note before I have done with you."\r\n\r\n"We will see that. Can she marry this Cupidon?"\r\n\r\n"Cupidon! he is just about as much a Cupidon as you are a Cyclops."\r\n\r\n"Can she marry him?"\r\n\r\n"You will see."\r\n\r\n"I want to know his name, Cary."\r\n\r\n"Guess it."\r\n\r\n"Is it any one in this neighbourhood?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, in Briarfield parish."\r\n\r\n"Then it is some person unworthy of her. I don\'t know a soul in\r\nBriarfield parish her equal."\r\n\r\n"Guess."\r\n\r\n"Impossible. I suppose she is under a delusion, and will plunge into\r\nsome absurdity, after all."\r\n\r\nCaroline smiled.\r\n\r\n"Do _you_ approve the choice?" asked Moore.\r\n\r\n"Quite, _quite_."\r\n\r\n"Then I _am_ puzzled; for the head which owns this bounteous fall of\r\nhazel curls is an excellent little thinking machine, most accurate in\r\nits working. It boasts a correct, steady judgment, inherited from\r\n\'mamma,\' I suppose."\r\n\r\n"And I _quite_ approve, and mamma was charmed."\r\n\r\n"\'Mamma\' charmed--Mrs. Pryor! It can\'t be romantic, then?"\r\n\r\n"It _is_ romantic, but it is also right."\r\n\r\n"Tell me, Cary--tell me out of pity; I am too weak to be tantalized."\r\n\r\n"You shall be tantalized--it will do you no harm; you are not so weak as\r\nyou pretend."\r\n\r\n"I have twice this evening had some thoughts of falling on the floor at\r\nyour feet."\r\n\r\n"You had better not. I shall decline to help you up."\r\n\r\n"And worshipping you downright. My mother was a Roman Catholic. You look\r\nlike the loveliest of her pictures of the Virgin. I think I will embrace\r\nher faith and kneel and adore."\r\n\r\n"Robert, Robert, sit still; don\'t be absurd. I will go to Hortense if\r\nyou commit extravagances."\r\n\r\n"You have stolen my senses. Just now nothing will come into my mind but\r\n_les litanies de la sainte Vi\xc3\xa8rge. Rose c\xc3\xa9leste, reine des anges_!"\r\n\r\n"_Tour d\'ivoire, maison d\'or_--is not that the jargon? Well, sit down\r\nquietly, and guess your riddle."\r\n\r\n"But \'mamma\' charmed--there\'s the puzzle."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what mamma said when I told her. \'Depend upon it, my\r\ndear, such a choice will make the happiness of Miss Keeldar\'s life.\'"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll guess once, and no more. It is old Helstone. She is going to be\r\nyour aunt."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell my uncle; I\'ll tell Shirley!" cried Caroline, laughing\r\ngleefully. "Guess again, Robert; your blunders are charming."\r\n\r\n"It is the parson--Hall."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, no; he is mine, if you please."\r\n\r\n"Yours! Ay, the whole generation of women in Briarfield seem to have\r\nmade an idol of that priest. I wonder why; he is bald, sand-blind,\r\ngray-haired."\r\n\r\n"Fanny will be here to fetch me before you have solved the riddle, if\r\nyou don\'t make haste."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll guess no more--I am tired; and then I don\'t care. Miss Keeldar may\r\nmarry _le grand Turc_ for me."\r\n\r\n"Must I whisper?"\r\n\r\n"That you must, and quickly. Here comes Hortense; come near, a little\r\nnearer, my own Lina. I care for the whisper more than the words."\r\n\r\nShe whispered. Robert gave a start, a flash of the eye, a brief laugh.\r\nMiss Moore entered, and Sarah followed behind, with information that\r\nFanny was come. The hour of converse was over.\r\n\r\nRobert found a moment to exchange a few more whispered sentences. He was\r\nwaiting at the foot of the staircase as Caroline descended after putting\r\non her shawl.\r\n\r\n"Must I call Shirley a noble creature now?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"If you wish to speak the truth, certainly."\r\n\r\n"Must I forgive her?"\r\n\r\n"Forgive her? Naughty Robert! Was she in the wrong, or were you?"\r\n\r\n"Must I at length love her downright, Cary?"\r\n\r\nCaroline looked keenly up, and made a movement towards him, something\r\nbetween the loving and the petulant.\r\n\r\n"Only give the word, and I\'ll try to obey you."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, you must not love her; the bare idea is perverse."\r\n\r\n"But then she is handsome, peculiarly handsome. Hers is a beauty that\r\ngrows on you. You think her but graceful when you first see her; you\r\ndiscover her to be beautiful when you have known her for a year."\r\n\r\n"It is not you who are to say these things. Now, Robert, be good."\r\n\r\n"O Cary, I have no love to give. Were the goddess of beauty to woo me, I\r\ncould not meet her advances. There is no heart which I can call mine in\r\nthis breast."\r\n\r\n"So much the better; you are a great deal safer without. Good-night."\r\n\r\n"Why must you always go, Lina, at the very instant when I most want you\r\nto stay?"\r\n\r\n"Because you most wish to retain when you are most certain to lose."\r\n\r\n"Listen; one other word. Take care of your own heart--do you hear me?"\r\n\r\n"There is no danger."\r\n\r\n"I am not convinced of that. The Platonic parson, for instance."\r\n\r\n"Who--Malone?"\r\n\r\n"Cyril Hall. I owe more than one twinge of jealousy to that quarter."\r\n\r\n"As to you, you have been flirting with Miss Mann. She showed me the\r\nother day a plant you had given her.--Fanny, I am ready."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN IN THE SCHOOLROOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nLouis Moore\'s doubts respecting the immediate evacuation of Fieldhead by\r\nMr. Sympson turned out to be perfectly well founded. The very next day\r\nafter the grand quarrel about Sir Philip Nunnely a sort of\r\nreconciliation was patched up between uncle and niece. Shirley, who\r\ncould never find it in her heart to be or to seem inhospitable (except\r\nin the single instance of Mr. Donne), begged the whole party to stay a\r\nlittle longer. She begged in such earnest it was evident she wished it\r\nfor some reason. They took her at her word. Indeed, the uncle could not\r\nbring himself to leave her quite unwatched--at full liberty to marry\r\nRobert Moore as soon as that gentleman should be able (Mr. Sympson\r\npiously prayed this might never be the case) to reassert his supposed\r\npretensions to her hand. They all stayed.\r\n\r\nIn his first rage against all the house of Moore, Mr. Sympson had so\r\nconducted himself towards Mr. Louis that that gentleman--patient of\r\nlabour or suffering, but intolerant of coarse insolence--had promptly\r\nresigned his post, and could now be induced to resume and retain it only\r\ntill such time as the family should quit Yorkshire. Mrs. Sympson\'s\r\nentreaties prevailed with him thus far; his own attachment to his pupil\r\nconstituted an additional motive for concession; and probably he had a\r\nthird motive, stronger than either of the other two. Probably he would\r\nhave found it very hard indeed to leave Fieldhead just now.\r\n\r\nThings went on for some time pretty smoothly. Miss Keeldar\'s health was\r\nre-established; her spirits resumed their flow. Moore had found means to\r\nrelieve her from every nervous apprehension; and, indeed, from the\r\nmoment of giving him her confidence, every fear seemed to have taken\r\nwing. Her heart became as lightsome, her manner as careless, as those of\r\na little child, that, thoughtless of its own life or death, trusts all\r\nresponsibility to its parents. He and William Farren--through whose\r\nmedium he made inquiries concerning the state of Ph\xc5\x93be--agreed in\r\nasserting that the dog was not mad, that it was only ill-usage which had\r\ndriven her from home; for it was proved that her master was in the\r\nfrequent habit of chastising her violently. Their assertion might or\r\nmight not be true. The groom and gamekeeper affirmed to the\r\ncontrary--both asserting that, if hers was not a clear case of\r\nhydrophobia, there was no such disease. But to this evidence Louis Moore\r\nturned an incredulous ear. He reported to Shirley only what was\r\nencouraging. She believed him; and, right or wrong, it is certain that\r\nin her case the bite proved innocuous.\r\n\r\nNovember passed; December came. The Sympsons were now really departing.\r\nIt was incumbent on them to be at home by Christmas. Their packages were\r\npreparing; they were to leave in a few days. One winter evening, during\r\nthe last week of their stay, Louis Moore again took out his little blank\r\nbook, and discoursed with it as follows:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"She is lovelier than ever. Since that little cloud was dispelled all\r\nthe temporary waste and wanness have vanished. It was marvellous to see\r\nhow soon the magical energy of youth raised her elastic and revived her\r\nblooming.\r\n\r\n"After breakfast this morning, when I had seen her, and listened to her,\r\nand, so to speak, felt her, in every sentient atom of my frame, I passed\r\nfrom her sunny presence into the chill drawing-room. Taking up a little\r\ngilt volume, I found it to contain a selection of lyrics. I read a poem\r\nor two; whether the spell was in me or in the verse I know not, but my\r\nheart filled genially, my pulse rose. I glowed, notwithstanding the\r\nfrost air. I, too, am young as yet. Though she said she never considered\r\nme young, I am barely thirty. There are moments when life, for no other\r\nreason than my own youth, beams with sweet hues upon me.\r\n\r\n"It was time to go to the schoolroom. I went. That same schoolroom is\r\nrather pleasant in a morning. The sun then shines through the low\r\nlattice; the books are in order; there are no papers strewn about; the\r\nfire is clear and clean; no cinders have fallen, no ashes accumulated. I\r\nfound Henry there, and he had brought with him Miss Keeldar. They were\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n"I said she was lovelier than ever. She is. A fine rose, not deep but\r\ndelicate, opens on her cheek. Her eye, always dark, clear, and speaking,\r\nutters now a language I cannot render; it is the utterance, seen not\r\nheard, through which angels must have communed when there was \'silence\r\nin heaven.\' Her hair was always dusk as night and fine as silk, her neck\r\nwas always fair, flexible, polished; but both have now a new charm. The\r\ntresses are soft as shadow, the shoulders they fall on wear a goddess\r\ngrace. Once I only _saw_ her beauty, now I _feel_ it.\r\n\r\n"Henry was repeating his lesson to her before bringing it to me. One of\r\nher hands was occupied with the book; he held the other. That boy gets\r\nmore than his share of privileges; he dares caress and is caressed. What\r\nindulgence and compassion she shows him! Too much. If this went on,\r\nHenry in a few years, when his soul was formed, would offer it on her\r\naltar, as I have offered mine.\r\n\r\n"I saw her eyelid flitter when I came in, but she did not look up; _now_\r\nshe hardly ever gives me a glance. She seems to grow silent too; to _me_\r\nshe rarely speaks, and when I am present, she says little to others. In\r\nmy gloomy moments I attribute this change to indifference, aversion,\r\nwhat not? In my sunny intervals I give it another meaning. I say, were I\r\nher equal, I could find in this shyness coyness, and in that coyness\r\nlove. As it is, dare I look for it? What could I do with it if found?\r\n\r\n"This morning I dared at least contrive an hour\'s communion for her and\r\nme; I dared not only _wish_ but _will_ an interview with her. I dared\r\nsummon solitude to guard us. Very decidedly I called Henry to the door.\r\nWithout hesitation I said, \'Go where you will, my boy; but, till I call\r\nyou, return not here.\'\r\n\r\n"Henry, I could see, did not like his dismissal. That boy is young, but\r\na thinker; his meditative eye shines on me strangely sometimes. He half\r\nfeels what links me to Shirley; he half guesses that there is a dearer\r\ndelight in the reserve with which I am treated than in all the\r\nendearments he is allowed. The young, lame, half-grown lion would growl\r\nat me now and then, because I have tamed his lioness and am her keeper,\r\ndid not the habit of discipline and the instinct of affection hold him\r\nsubdued. Go, Henry; you must learn to take your share of the bitter of\r\nlife with all of Adam\'s race that have gone before or will come after\r\nyou. Your destiny can be no exception to the common lot; be grateful\r\nthat your love is overlooked thus early, before it can claim any\r\naffinity to passion. An hour\'s fret, a pang of envy, suffice to express\r\nwhat you feel. Jealousy hot as the sun above the line, rage destructive\r\nas the tropic storm, the clime of your sensations ignores--as yet.\r\n\r\n"I took my usual seat at the desk, quite in my usual way. I am blessed\r\nin that power to cover all inward ebullition with outward calm. No one\r\nwho looks at my slow face can guess the vortex sometimes whirling in my\r\nheart, and engulfing thought and wrecking prudence. Pleasant is it to\r\nhave the gift to proceed peacefully and powerfully in your course\r\nwithout alarming by one eccentric movement. It was not my present\r\nintention to utter one word of love to her, or to reveal one glimpse of\r\nthe fire in which I wasted. Presumptuous I never have been; presumptuous\r\nI never will be. Rather than even _seem_ selfish and interested, I would\r\nresolutely rise, gird my loins, part and leave her, and seek, on the\r\nother side of the globe, a new life, cold and barren as the rock the\r\nsalt tide daily washes. My design this morning was to take of her a near\r\nscrutiny--to read a line in the page of her heart. Before I left I\r\ndetermined to know _what_ I was leaving.\r\n\r\n"I had some quills to make into pens. Most men\'s hands would have\r\ntrembled when their hearts were so stirred; mine went to work steadily,\r\nand my voice, when I called it into exercise, was firm.\r\n\r\n"\'This day week you will be alone at Fieldhead, Miss Keeldar.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes: I rather think my uncle\'s intention to go is a settled one now.\'\r\n\r\n"\'He leaves you dissatisfied.\'\r\n\r\n"\'He is not pleased with me.\'\r\n\r\n"\'He departs as he came--no better for his journey. This is mortifying.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I trust the failure of his plans will take from him all inclination to\r\nlay new ones.\'\r\n\r\n"\'In his way Mr. Sympson honestly wished you well. All he has done or\r\nintended to do he believed to be for the best.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You are kind to undertake the defence of a man who has permitted\r\nhimself to treat you with so much insolence.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I never feel shocked at, or bear malice for, what is spoken in\r\ncharacter; and most perfectly in character was that vulgar and violent\r\nonset against me, when he had quitted you worsted.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You cease now to be Henry\'s tutor?\'\r\n\r\n"\'I shall be parted from Henry for a while (if he and I live we shall\r\nmeet again somehow, for we love each other) and be ousted from the bosom\r\nof the Sympson family for ever. Happily this change does not leave me\r\nstranded; it but hurries into premature execution designs long formed.\'\r\n\r\n"\'No change finds you off your guard. I was sure, in your calm way, you\r\nwould be prepared for sudden mutation. I always think you stand in the\r\nworld like a solitary but watchful, thoughtful archer in a wood. And the\r\nquiver on your shoulder holds more arrows than one; your bow is provided\r\nwith a second string. Such too is your brother\'s wont. You two might go\r\nforth homeless hunters to the loneliest western wilds; all would be well\r\nwith you. The hewn tree would make you a hut, the cleared forest yield\r\nyou fields from its stripped bosom, the buffalo would feel your\r\nrifle-shot, and with lowered horns and hump pay homage at your feet.\'\r\n\r\n"\'And any Indian tribe of Blackfeet or Flatheads would afford us a\r\nbride, perhaps?\'\r\n\r\n"\'No\' (hesitating), \'I think not. The savage is sordid. I think--that\r\nis, I _hope_--you would neither of you share your hearth with that to\r\nwhich you could not give your heart.\'\r\n\r\n"\'What suggested the wild West to your mind, Miss Keeldar? Have you been\r\nwith me in spirit when I did not see you? Have you entered into my\r\nday-dreams, and beheld my brain labouring at its scheme of a future?\'\r\n\r\n"She had separated a slip of paper for lighting tapers--a spill, as it\r\nis called--into fragments. She threw morsel by morsel into the fire, and\r\nstood pensively watching them consume. She did not speak.\r\n\r\n"\'How did you learn what you seem to know about my intentions?\'\r\n\r\n"\'I know nothing. I am only discovering them now. I spoke at hazard.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Your hazard sounds like divination. A tutor I will never be again;\r\nnever take a pupil after Henry and yourself; not again will I sit\r\nhabitually at another man\'s table--no more be the appendage of a family.\r\nI am now a man of thirty; I have never been free since I was a boy of\r\nten. I have such a thirst for freedom, such a deep passion to know her\r\nand call her mine, such a day-desire and night-longing to win her and\r\npossess her, I will not refuse to cross the Atlantic for her sake; her I\r\nwill follow deep into virgin woods. Mine it shall not be to accept a\r\nsavage girl as a slave--she could not be a wife. I know no white woman\r\nwhom I love that would accompany me; but I am certain Liberty will await\r\nme, sitting under a pine. When I call her she will come to my loghouse,\r\nand she shall fill my arms.\'\r\n\r\n"She could not hear me speak so unmoved, and she _was_ moved. It was\r\nright--I meant to move her. She could not answer me, nor could she look\r\nat me. I should have been sorry if she could have done either. Her cheek\r\nglowed as if a crimson flower through whose petals the sun shone had\r\ncast its light upon it. On the white lid and dark lashes of her downcast\r\neye trembled all that is graceful in the sense of half-painful,\r\nhalf-pleasing shame.\r\n\r\n"Soon she controlled her emotion, and took all her feelings under\r\ncommand. I saw she had felt insurrection, and was waking to empire. She\r\nsat down. There was that in her face which I could read. It said, I see\r\nthe line which is my limit; nothing shall make me pass it. I feel--I\r\nknow how far I may reveal my feelings, and when I must clasp the volume.\r\nI have advanced to a certain distance, as far as the true and sovereign\r\nand undegraded nature of my kind permits; now here I stand rooted. My\r\nheart may break if it is baffled; let it break. It shall never dishonour\r\nme; it shall never dishonour my sisterhood in me. Suffering before\r\ndegradation! death before treachery!\r\n\r\n"I, for my part, said, \'If she were poor, I would be at her feet; if she\r\nwere lowly, I would take her in my arms. Her gold and her station are\r\ntwo griffins that guard her on each side. Love looks and longs, and\r\ndares not; Passion hovers round, and is kept at bay; Truth and Devotion\r\nare scared. There is nothing to lose in winning her, no sacrifice to\r\nmake. It is all clear gain, and therefore unimaginably difficult.\'\r\n\r\n"Difficult or not, something must be done, something must be said. I\r\ncould not, and would not, sit silent with all that beauty modestly mute\r\nin my presence. I spoke thus, and still I spoke with calm. Quiet as my\r\nwords were, I could hear they fell in a tone distinct, round, and deep.\r\n\r\n"\'Still, I know I shall be strangely placed with that mountain nymph\r\nLiberty. She is, I suspect, akin to that Solitude which I once wooed,\r\nand from which I now seek a divorce. These Oreads are peculiar. They\r\ncome upon you with an unearthly charm, like some starlight evening; they\r\ninspire a wild but not warm delight; their beauty is the beauty of\r\nspirits; their grace is not the grace of life, but of seasons or scenes\r\nin nature. Theirs is the dewy bloom of morning, the languid flush of\r\nevening, the peace of the moon, the changefulness of clouds. I want and\r\nwill have something different. This elfish splendour looks chill to my\r\nvision, and feels frozen to my touch. I am not a poet; I cannot live\r\nwith abstractions. You, Miss Keeldar, have sometimes, in your laughing\r\nsatire, called me a material philosopher, and implied that I live\r\nsufficiently for the substantial. Certainly I feel material from head to\r\nfoot; and glorious as Nature is, and deeply as I worship her with the\r\nsolid powers of a solid heart, I would rather behold her through the\r\nsoft human eyes of a loved and lovely wife than through the wild orbs of\r\nthe highest goddess of Olympus.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Juno could not cook a buffalo steak as you like it,\' said she.\r\n\r\n"\'She could not; but I will tell you who could--some young, penniless,\r\nfriendless orphan girl. I wish I could find such a one--pretty enough\r\nfor me to love, with something of the mind and heart suited to my taste;\r\nnot uneducated--honest and modest. I care nothing for attainments, but I\r\nwould fain have the germ of those sweet natural powers which nothing\r\nacquired can rival; any temper Fate wills--I can manage the hottest. To\r\nsuch a creature as this I should like to be first tutor and then\r\nhusband. I would teach her my language, my habits and my principles, and\r\nthen I would reward her with my love.\'\r\n\r\n"\'_Reward_ her, lord of the creation--_reward_ her!\'" ejaculated she,\r\nwith a curled lip.\r\n\r\n"\'And be repaid a thousandfold.\'\r\n\r\n"\'If she willed it, monseigneur.\'\r\n\r\n"\'And she _should_ will it.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You have stipulated for any temper Fate wills. Compulsion is flint and\r\na blow to the metal of some souls.\'\r\n\r\n"\'And love the spark it elicits.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Who cares for the love that is but a spark--seen, flown upward, and\r\ngone?\'\r\n\r\n"\'I must find my orphan girl. Tell me how, Miss Keeldar.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Advertise; and be sure you add, when you describe the qualifications,\r\nshe must be a good plain cook.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I must find her; and when I do find her I shall marry her.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Not you!\' and her voice took a sudden accent of peculiar scorn.\r\n\r\n"I liked this. I had roused her from the pensive mood in which I had\r\nfirst found her. I would stir her further.\r\n\r\n"\'Why doubt it?\'\r\n\r\n"\'_You_ marry!\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, of course; nothing more evident than that I can and shall.\'\r\n\r\n"\'The contrary is evident, Mr. Moore.\'\r\n\r\n"She charmed me in this mood--waxing disdainful, half insulting; pride,\r\ntemper, derision, blent in her large fine eye, that had just now the\r\nlook of a merlin\'s.\r\n\r\n"\'Favour me with your reasons for such an opinion, Miss Keeldar.\'\r\n\r\n"\'How will _you_ manage to marry, I wonder?\'\r\n\r\n"\'I shall manage it with ease and speed when I find the proper person.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Accept celibacy!\' (and she made a gesture with her hand as if she gave\r\nme something) \'take it as your doom!\'\r\n\r\n"\'No; you cannot give what I already have. Celibacy has been mine for\r\nthirty years. If you wish to offer me a gift, a parting present, a\r\nkeepsake, you must change the boon.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Take worse, then!\'\r\n\r\n"\'How--what?\'\r\n\r\n"I now felt, and looked, and spoke eagerly. I was unwise to quit my\r\nsheet-anchor of calm even for an instant; it deprived me of an advantage\r\nand transferred it to her. The little spark of temper dissolved in\r\nsarcasm, and eddied over her countenance in the ripples of a mocking\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"\'Take a wife that has paid you court to save your modesty, and thrust\r\nherself upon you to spare your scruples.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Only show me where.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Any stout widow that has had a few husbands already, and can manage\r\nthese things.\'\r\n\r\n"\'She must not be rich, then. Oh these riches!\'\r\n\r\n"\'Never would you have gathered the produce of the gold-bearing garden.\r\nYou have not courage to confront the sleepless dragon; you have not\r\ncraft to borrow the aid of Atlas.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You look hot and haughty.\'\r\n\r\n"\'And you far haughtier. Yours is the monstrous pride which counterfeits\r\nhumility.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I am a dependant; I know my place.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I am a woman; I know mine.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I am poor; I must be proud.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I have received ordinances, and own obligations stringent as yours.\'\r\n\r\n"We had reached a critical point now, and we halted and looked at each\r\nother. _She_ would not give in, I felt. Beyond this I neither felt nor\r\nsaw. A few moments yet were mine. The end was coming--I heard its\r\nrush--but not come. I would dally, wait, talk, and when impulse urged I\r\nwould act. I am never in a hurry; I never was in a hurry in my whole\r\nlife. Hasty people drink the nectar of existence scalding hot; I taste\r\nit cool as dew. I proceeded: \'Apparently, Miss Keeldar, you are as\r\nlittle likely to marry as myself. I know you have refused three--nay,\r\nfour--advantageous offers, and, I believe, a fifth. Have you rejected\r\nSir Philip Nunnely?\'\r\n\r\n"I put this question suddenly and promptly.\r\n\r\n"\'Did you think I should take him?\'\r\n\r\n"\'I thought you might.\'\r\n\r\n"\'On what grounds, may I ask?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Conformity of rank, age, pleasing contrast of temper--for _he_ is mild\r\nand amiable--harmony of intellectual tastes.\'\r\n\r\n"\'A beautiful sentence! Let us take it to pieces. "Conformity of rank."\r\nHe is quite above me. Compare my grange with his palace, if you please.\r\nI am disdained by his kith and kin. "Suitability of age." We were born\r\nin the same year; consequently he is still a boy, while I am a\r\nwoman--ten years his senior to all intents and purposes. "Contrast of\r\ntemper." Mild and amiable, is he; I--what? Tell me.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Sister of the spotted, bright, quick, fiery leopard.\'\r\n\r\n"\'And you would mate me with a kid--the millennium being yet millions of\r\ncenturies from mankind; being yet, indeed, an archangel high in the\r\nseventh heaven, uncommissioned to descend? Unjust barbarian! "Harmony of\r\nintellectual tastes." He is fond of poetry, and I hate it----\'\r\n\r\n"\'Do you? That is news.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I absolutely shudder at the sight of metre or at the sound of rhyme\r\nwhenever I am at the priory or Sir Philip at Fieldhead. Harmony,\r\nindeed! When did I whip up syllabub sonnets or string stanzas fragile as\r\nfragments of glass? and when did I betray a belief that those\r\npenny-beads were genuine brilliants?\'\r\n\r\n"\'You might have the satisfaction of leading him to a higher standard,\r\nof improving his tastes.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Leading and improving! teaching and tutoring! bearing and forbearing!\r\nPah! my husband is not to be my baby. I am not to set him his daily\r\nlesson and see that he learns it, and give him a sugar-plum if he is\r\ngood, and a patient, pensive, pathetic lecture if he is bad. But it is\r\nlike a tutor to talk of the "satisfaction of teaching." I suppose _you_\r\nthink it the finest employment in the world. I don\'t. I reject it.\r\nImproving a husband! No. I shall insist upon my husband improving me, or\r\nelse we part.\'\r\n\r\n"\'God knows it is needed!\'\r\n\r\n"\'What do you mean by that, Mr. Moore?\'\r\n\r\n"\'What I say. Improvement is imperatively needed.\'\r\n\r\n"\'If you were a woman you would school _monsieur, votre mari_,\r\ncharmingly. It would just suit you; schooling is your vocation.\'\r\n\r\n"\'May I ask whether, in your present just and gentle mood, you mean to\r\ntaunt me with being a tutor?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, bitterly; and with anything else you please--any defect of which\r\nyou are painfully conscious.\'\r\n\r\n"\'With being poor, for instance?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Of course; that will sting you. You are sore about your poverty; you\r\nbrood over that.\'\r\n\r\n"\'With having nothing but a very plain person to offer the woman who may\r\nmaster my heart?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Exactly. You have a habit of calling yourself plain. You are sensitive\r\nabout the cut of your features because they are not quite on an Apollo\r\npattern. You abase them more than is needful, in the faint hope that\r\nothers may say a word in their behalf--which won\'t happen. Your face is\r\nnothing to boast of, certainly--not a pretty line nor a pretty tint to\r\nbe found therein.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Compare it with your own.\'\r\n\r\n"\'It looks like a god of Egypt--a great sand-buried stone head; or\r\nrather I will compare it to nothing so lofty. It looks like Tartar. You\r\nare my mastiff\'s cousin. I think you as much like him as a man can be\r\nlike a dog.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Tartar is your dear companion. In summer, when you rise early, and\r\nrun out into the fields to wet your feet with the dew, and freshen your\r\ncheek and uncurl your hair with the breeze, you always call him to\r\nfollow you. You call him sometimes with a whistle that you learned from\r\nme. In the solitude of your wood, when you think nobody but Tartar is\r\nlistening, you whistle the very tunes you imitated from my lips, or sing\r\nthe very songs you have caught up by ear from my voice. I do not ask\r\nwhence flows the feeling which you pour into these songs, for I know it\r\nflows out of your heart, Miss Keeldar. In the winter evenings Tartar\r\nlies at your feet. You suffer him to rest his head on your perfumed lap;\r\nyou let him couch on the borders of your satin raiment. His rough hide\r\nis familiar with the contact of your hand. I once saw you kiss him on\r\nthat snow-white beauty spot which stars his broad forehead. It is\r\ndangerous to say I am like Tartar; it suggests to me a claim to be\r\ntreated like Tartar.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Perhaps, sir, you can extort as much from your penniless and\r\nfriendless young orphan girl, when you find her.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Oh could I find her such as I image her! Something to tame first, and\r\nteach afterwards; to break in, and then to fondle. To lift the destitute\r\nproud thing out of poverty; to establish power over and then to be\r\nindulgent to the capricious moods that never were influenced and never\r\nindulged before; to see her alternately irritated and subdued about\r\ntwelve times in the twenty-four hours; and perhaps, eventually, when her\r\ntraining was accomplished, to behold her the exemplary and patient\r\nmother of about a dozen children, only now and then lending little Louis\r\na cordial cuff by way of paying the interest of the vast debt she owes\r\nhis father. Oh\' (I went on), \'my orphan girl would give me many a kiss;\r\nshe would watch on the threshold for my coming home of an evening; she\r\nwould run into my arms; she would keep my hearth as bright as she would\r\nmake it warm. God bless the sweet idea! Find her I must.\'\r\n\r\n"Her eyes emitted an eager flash, her lips opened; but she reclosed\r\nthem, and impetuously turned away.\r\n\r\n"\'Tell me, tell me where she is, Miss Keeldar!\'\r\n\r\n"Another movement, all haughtiness and fire and impulse.\r\n\r\n"\'I must know. You _can_ tell me; you _shall_ tell me.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I _never will_.\'\r\n\r\n"She turned to leave me. Could I now let her part as she had always\r\nparted from me? No. I had gone too far not to finish; I had come too\r\nnear the end not to drive home to it. All the encumbrance of doubt, all\r\nthe rubbish of indecision, must be removed at once, and the plain truth\r\nmust be ascertained. She must take her part, and tell me what it was; I\r\nmust take mine and adhere to it.\r\n\r\n"\'A minute, madam,\' I said, keeping my hand on the door-handle before I\r\nopened it. \'We have had a long conversation this morning, but the last\r\nword has not been spoken yet. It is yours to speak it.\'\r\n\r\n"\'May I pass?\'\r\n\r\n"\'No; I guard the door. I would almost rather die than let you leave me\r\njust now, without speaking the word I demand.\'\r\n\r\n"\'What dare you expect me to say?\'\r\n\r\n"\'What I am dying and perishing to hear; what I _must_ and _will_ hear;\r\nwhat you dare not now suppress.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Mr. Moore, I hardly know what you mean. You are not like yourself.\'\r\n\r\n"I suppose I hardly was like my usual self, for I scared her--that I\r\ncould see. It was right: she must be scared to be won.\r\n\r\n"\'You _do_ know what I mean, and for the first time I stand before you\r\n_myself_. I have flung off the tutor, and beg to introduce you to the\r\nman. And remember, he is a gentleman.\'\r\n\r\n"She trembled. She put her hand to mine as if to remove it from the\r\nlock. She might as well have tried to loosen, by her soft touch, metal\r\nwelded to metal. She felt she was powerless, and receded; and again she\r\ntrembled.\r\n\r\n"What change I underwent I cannot explain, but out of her emotion passed\r\ninto me a new spirit. I neither was crushed nor elated by her lands and\r\ngold; I thought not of them, cared not for them. They were\r\nnothing--dross that could not dismay me. I saw only herself--her young\r\nbeautiful form, the grace, the majesty, the modesty of her girlhood.\r\n\r\n"\'My pupil,\' I said.\r\n\r\n"\'My master,\' was the low answer.\r\n\r\n"\'I have a thing to tell you.\'\r\n\r\n"She waited with declined brow and ringlets drooped.\r\n\r\n"\'I have to tell you that for four years you have been growing into\r\nyour tutor\'s heart, and that you are rooted there now. I have to declare\r\nthat you have bewitched me, in spite of sense, and experience, and\r\ndifference of station and estate. You have so looked, and spoken, and\r\nmoved; so shown me your faults and your virtues--beauties rather, they\r\nare hardly so stern as virtues--that I love you--love you with my life\r\nand strength. It is out now.\'\r\n\r\n"She sought what to say, but could not find a word. She tried to rally,\r\nbut vainly. I passionately repeated that I loved her.\r\n\r\n"\'Well, Mr. Moore, what then?\' was the answer I got, uttered in a tone\r\nthat would have been petulant if it had not faltered.\r\n\r\n"\'Have you nothing to say to me? Have you no love for me?\'\r\n\r\n"\'A little bit.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I am not to be tortured. I will not even play at present.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I don\'t want to play; I want to go.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I wonder you dare speak of going at this moment. _You_ go! What! with\r\nmy heart in your hand, to lay it on your toilet and pierce it with your\r\npins? From my presence you do not stir, out of my reach you do not\r\nstray, till I receive a hostage--pledge for pledge--your heart for\r\nmine.\'\r\n\r\n"\'The thing you want is mislaid--lost some time since. Let me go and\r\nseek it.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Declare that it is where your keys often are--in my possession.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You ought to know. And where are my keys, Mr. Moore? Indeed and truly\r\nI have lost them again; and Mrs. Gill wants some money, and I have none,\r\nexcept this sixpence.\'\r\n\r\n"She took the coin out of her apron pocket, and showed it in her palm. I\r\ncould have trifled with her, but it would not do; life and death were at\r\nstake. Mastering at once the sixpence and the hand that held it, I\r\ndemanded, \'Am I to die without you, or am I to live for you?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Do as you please. Far be it from me to dictate your choice.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You shall tell me with your own lips whether you doom me to exile or\r\ncall me to hope.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Go; I can bear to be left.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Perhaps I too _can_ bear to leave you. But reply, Shirley, my pupil,\r\nmy sovereign--reply.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Die without me if you will; live for me if you dare.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I am not afraid of you, my leopardess. I _dare_ live for and with you,\r\nfrom this hour till my death. Now, then, I have you. You are mine. I\r\nwill never let you go. Wherever my home be, I have chosen my wife. If I\r\nstay in England, in England you will stay; if I cross the Atlantic, you\r\nwill cross it also. Our lives are riveted, our lots intertwined.\'\r\n\r\n"\'And are we equal, then, sir? are we equal at last?\'\r\n\r\n"\'You are younger, frailer, feebler, more ignorant than I.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Will you be good to me, and never tyrannize?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Will you let me breathe, and not bewilder me? You must not smile at\r\npresent. The world swims and changes round me. The sun is a dizzying\r\nscarlet blaze, the sky a violet vortex whirling over me.\'\r\n\r\n"I am a strong man, but I staggered as I spoke. All creation was\r\nexaggerated. Colour grew more vivid, motion more rapid, life itself more\r\nvital. I hardly saw her for a moment, but I heard her voice--pitilessly\r\nsweet. She would not subdue one of her charms in compassion. Perhaps she\r\ndid not know what I felt.\r\n\r\n"\'You name me leopardess. Remember, the leopardess is tameless,\' said\r\nshe.\r\n\r\n"\'Tame or fierce, wild or subdued, you are _mine_.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I am glad I know my keeper and am used to him. Only his voice will I\r\nfollow; only his hand shall manage me; only at his feet will I repose.\'\r\n\r\n"I took her back to her seat, and sat down by her side. I wanted to hear\r\nher speak again. I could never have enough of her voice and her words.\r\n\r\n"\'How much do you love me?\' I asked.\r\n\r\n"\'Ah! you know. I will not gratify you--I will not flatter.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I don\'t know half enough; my heart craves to be fed. If you knew how\r\nhungry and ferocious it is, you would hasten to stay it with a kind word\r\nor two.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Poor Tartar!\' said she, touching and patting my hand--\'poor fellow,\r\nstalwart friend, Shirley\'s pet and favourite, lie down!\'\r\n\r\n"\'But I will not lie down till I am fed with one sweet word.\'\r\n\r\n"And at last she gave it.\r\n\r\n"\'Dear Louis, be faithful to me; never leave me. I don\'t care for life\r\nunless I may pass it at your side.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Something more.\'\r\n\r\n"She gave me a change; it was not her way to offer the same dish twice.\r\n\r\n"\'Sir,\' she said, starting up, \'at your peril you ever again name such\r\nsordid things as money, or poverty, or inequality. It will be absolutely\r\ndangerous to torment me with these maddening scruples. I defy you to do\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n"My face grew hot. I did once more wish I were not so poor or she were\r\nnot so rich. She saw the transient misery; and then, indeed, she\r\ncaressed me. Blent with torment, I experienced rapture.\r\n\r\n"\'Mr. Moore,\' said she, looking up with a sweet, open, earnest\r\ncountenance, \'teach me and help me to be good. I do not ask you to take\r\noff my shoulders all the cares and duties of property, but I ask you to\r\nshare the burden, and to show me how to sustain my part well. Your\r\njudgment is well balanced, your heart is kind, your principles are\r\nsound. I know you are wise; I feel you are benevolent; I believe you are\r\nconscientious. Be my companion through life; be my guide where I am\r\nignorant; be my master where I am faulty; be my friend always!\'\r\n\r\n"\'So help me God, I will!\'"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYet again a passage from the blank book if you like, reader; if you\r\ndon\'t like it, pass it over:--\r\n\r\n"The Sympsons are gone, but not before discovery and explanation. My\r\nmanner must have betrayed something, or my looks. I was quiet, but I\r\nforgot to be guarded sometimes. I stayed longer in the room than usual;\r\nI could not bear to be out of her presence; I returned to it, and basked\r\nin it, like Tartar in the sun. If she left the oak parlour,\r\ninstinctively I rose and left it too. She chid me for this procedure\r\nmore than once. I did it with a vague, blundering idea of getting a word\r\nwith her in the hall or elsewhere. Yesterday towards dusk I had her to\r\nmyself for five minutes by the hall fire. We stood side by side; she was\r\nrailing at me, and I was enjoying the sound of her voice. The young\r\nladies passed, and looked at us; we did not separate. Ere long they\r\nrepassed, and again looked. Mrs. Sympson came; we did not move. Mr.\r\nSympson opened the dining-room door. Shirley flashed him back full\r\npayment for his spying gaze. She curled her lip and tossed her tresses.\r\nThe glance she gave was at once explanatory and defiant. It said: \'I\r\nlike Mr. Moore\'s society, and I dare you to find fault with my taste.\'\r\n\r\n"I asked, \'Do you mean him to understand how matters are?\'\r\n\r\n"\'I do,\' said she; \'but I leave the development to chance. There will be\r\na scene. I neither invite it nor fear it; only, you must be present, for\r\nI am inexpressibly tired of facing him solus. I don\'t like to see him in\r\na rage. He then puts off all his fine proprieties and conventional\r\ndisguises, and the real human being below is what you would call\r\n_commun, plat, bas--vilain et un peu m\xc3\xa9chant_. His ideas are not clean,\r\nMr. Moore; they want scouring with soft soap and fuller\'s earth. I\r\nthink, if he could add his imagination to the contents of Mrs. Gill\'s\r\nbucking-basket, and let her boil it in her copper, with rain-water and\r\nbleaching-powder (I hope you think me a tolerable laundress), it would\r\ndo him incalculable good.\'\r\n\r\n"This morning, fancying I heard her descend somewhat early, I was down\r\ninstantly. I had not been deceived. There she was, busy at work in the\r\nbreakfast-parlour, of which the housemaid was completing the arrangement\r\nand dusting. She had risen betimes to finish some little keepsake she\r\nintended for Henry. I got only a cool reception, which I accepted till\r\nthe girl was gone, taking my book to the window-seat very quietly. Even\r\nwhen we were alone I was slow to disturb her. To sit with her in sight\r\nwas happiness, and the proper happiness, for early morning--serene,\r\nincomplete, but progressive. Had I been obtrusive, I knew I should have\r\nencountered rebuff. \'Not at home to suitors\' was written on her brow.\r\nTherefore I read on, stole now and then a look, watched her countenance\r\nsoften and open as she felt I respected her mood, and enjoyed the gentle\r\ncontent of the moment.\r\n\r\n"The distance between us shrank, and the light hoar-frost thawed\r\ninsensibly. Ere an hour elapsed I was at her side, watching her sew,\r\ngathering her sweet smiles and her merry words, which fell for me\r\nabundantly. We sat, as we had a right to sit, side by side; my arm\r\nrested on her chair; I was near enough to count the stitches of her\r\nwork, and to discern the eye of her needle. The door suddenly opened.\r\n\r\n"I believe, if I had just then started from her, she would have\r\ndespised me. Thanks to the phlegm of my nature, I rarely start. When I\r\nam well-off, _bien_, comfortable, I am not soon stirred. _Bien_ I\r\nwas--_tr\xc3\xa8s bien_--consequently immutable. No muscle moved. I hardly\r\nlooked to the door.\r\n\r\n"\'Good-morning, uncle,\' said she, addressing that personage, who paused\r\non the threshold in a state of petrifaction.\r\n\r\n"\'Have you been long downstairs, Miss Keeldar, and alone with Mr.\r\nMoore?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, a very long time. We both came down early; it was scarcely\r\nlight.\'\r\n\r\n"\'The proceeding is improper----\'\r\n\r\n"\'It was at first, I was rather cross, and not civil; but you will\r\nperceive that we are now friends.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I perceive more than you would wish me to perceive.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Hardly, sir,\' said I; \'we have no disguises. Will you permit me to\r\nintimate that any further observations you have to make may as well be\r\naddressed to me? Henceforward I stand between Miss Keeldar and all\r\nannoyance.\'\r\n\r\n"\'_You!_ What have _you_ to do with Miss Keeldar?\'\r\n\r\n"\'To protect, watch over, serve her.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You, sir--you, the tutor?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Not one word of insult, sir,\' interposed she; \'not one syllable of\r\ndisrespect to Mr. Moore in this house.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Do you take his part?\'\r\n\r\n"\'_His_ part? oh yes!\'\r\n\r\n"She turned to me with a sudden fond movement, which I met by circling\r\nher with my arm. She and I both rose.\r\n\r\n"\'Good Ged!\' was the cry from the morning-gown standing quivering at the\r\ndoor. _Ged_, I think, must be the cognomen of Mr. Sympson\'s Lares. When\r\nhard pressed he always invokes this idol.\r\n\r\n"\'Come forward, uncle; you shall hear all.--Tell him all, Louis.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I dare him to speak--the beggar! the knave! the specious hypocrite!\r\nthe vile, insinuating, infamous menial!--Stand apart from my niece, sir.\r\nLet her go!\'\r\n\r\n"She clung to me with energy. \'I am near my future husband,\' she said.\r\n\'Who dares touch him or me?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Her husband!\' He raised and spread his hands. He dropped into a seat.\r\n\r\n"\'A while ago you wanted much to know whom I meant to marry. My\r\nintention was then formed, but not mature for communication. Now it is\r\nripe, sun-mellowed, perfect. Take the crimson peach--take Louis Moore!\'\r\n\r\n"\'But\' (savagely) \'you _shall not_ have him; he _shall not_ have you.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I would die before I would have another. I would die if I might not\r\nhave him.\'\r\n\r\n"He uttered words with which this page shall never be polluted.\r\n\r\n"She turned white as death; she shook all over; she lost her strength. I\r\nlaid her down on the sofa; just looked to ascertain that she had not\r\nfainted--of which, with a divine smile, she assured me. I kissed her;\r\nand then, if I were to perish, I cannot give a clear account of what\r\nhappened in the course of the next five minutes. She has since--through\r\ntears, laughter, and trembling--told me that I turned terrible, and gave\r\nmyself to the demon. She says I left her, made one bound across the\r\nroom; that Mr. Sympson vanished through the door as if shot from a\r\ncannon. I also vanished, and she heard Mrs. Gill scream.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Gill was still screaming when I came to my senses. I was then in\r\nanother apartment--the oak parlour, I think. I held Sympson before me\r\ncrushed into a chair, and my hand was on his cravat. His eyes rolled in\r\nhis head; I was strangling him, I think. The housekeeper stood wringing\r\nher hands, entreating me to desist. I desisted that moment, and felt at\r\nonce as cool as stone. But I told Mrs. Gill to fetch the Red-House Inn\r\nchaise instantly, and informed Mr. Sympson he must depart from Fieldhead\r\nthe instant it came. Though half frightened out of his wits, he declared\r\nhe would not. Repeating the former order, I added a commission to fetch\r\na constable. I said, \'You _shall_ go, by fair means or foul.\'\r\n\r\n"He threatened prosecution; I cared for nothing. I had stood over him\r\nonce before, not quite so fiercely as now, but full as austerely. It was\r\none night when burglars attempted the house at Sympson Grove, and in his\r\nwretched cowardice he would have given a vain alarm, without daring to\r\noffer defence. I had then been obliged to protect his family and his\r\nabode by mastering himself--and I had succeeded. I now remained with him\r\ntill the chaise came. I marshalled him to it, he scolding all the way.\r\nHe was terribly bewildered, as well as enraged. He would have resisted\r\nme, but knew not how. He called for his wife and daughters to come. I\r\nsaid they should follow him as soon as they could prepare. The smoke,\r\nthe fume, the fret of his demeanour was inexpressible, but it was a fury\r\nincapable of producing a deed. That man, properly handled, must ever\r\nremain impotent. I know he will never touch me with the law. I know his\r\nwife, over whom he tyrannizes in trifles, guides him in matters of\r\nimportance. I have long since earned her undying mother\'s gratitude by\r\nmy devotion to her boy. In some of Henry\'s ailments I have nursed\r\nhim--better, she said, than any woman could nurse. She will never forget\r\nthat. She and her daughters quitted me to-day, in mute wrath and\r\nconsternation; but she respects me. When Henry clung to my neck as I\r\nlifted him into the carriage and placed him by her side, when I arranged\r\nher own wrapping to make her warm, though she turned her head from me, I\r\nsaw the tears start to her eyes. She will but the more zealously\r\nadvocate my cause because she has left me in anger. I am glad of\r\nthis--not for my own sake, but for that of my life and idol--my\r\nShirley."\r\n\r\nOnce again he writes, a week after:--"I am now at Stilbro\'. I have taken\r\nup my temporary abode with a friend--a professional man, in whose\r\nbusiness I can be useful. Every day I ride over to Fieldhead. How long\r\nwill it be before I can call that place my home, and its mistress mine?\r\nI am not easy, not tranquil; I am tantalized, sometimes tortured. To see\r\nher now, one would think she had never pressed her cheek to my shoulder,\r\nor clung to me with tenderness or trust. I feel unsafe; she renders me\r\nmiserable. I am shunned when I visit her; she withdraws from my reach.\r\nOnce this day I lifted her face, resolved to get a full look down her\r\ndeep, dark eyes. Difficult to describe what I read there! Pantheress!\r\nbeautiful forest-born! wily, tameless, peerless nature! She gnaws her\r\nchain; I see the white teeth working at the steel! She has dreams of her\r\nwild woods and pinings after virgin freedom. I wish Sympson would come\r\nagain, and oblige her again to entwine her arms about me. I wish there\r\nwas danger she should lose me, as there is risk I shall lose her. No;\r\nfinal loss I do not fear, but long delay----\r\n\r\n"It is now night--midnight. I have spent the afternoon and evening at\r\nFieldhead. Some hours ago she passed me, coming down the oak staircase\r\nto the hall. She did not know I was standing in the twilight, near the\r\nstaircase window, looking at the frost-bright constellations. How\r\nclosely she glided against the banisters! How shyly shone her large eyes\r\nupon me! How evanescent, fugitive, fitful she looked--slim and swift as\r\na northern streamer!\r\n\r\n"I followed her into the drawing-room. Mrs. Pryor and Caroline Helstone\r\nwere both there; she has summoned them to bear her company awhile. In\r\nher white evening dress, with her long hair flowing full and wavy, with\r\nher noiseless step, her pale cheek, her eye full of night and lightning,\r\nshe looked, I thought, spirit-like--a thing made of an element, the\r\nchild of a breeze and a flame, the daughter of ray and raindrop--a thing\r\nnever to be overtaken, arrested, fixed. I wished I could avoid following\r\nher with my gaze as she moved here and there, but it was impossible. I\r\ntalked with the other ladies as well as I could, but still I looked at\r\nher. She was very silent; I think she never spoke to me--not even when\r\nshe offered me tea. It happened that she was called out a minute by Mrs.\r\nGill. I passed into the moonlit hall, with the design of getting a word\r\nas she returned; nor in this did I fail.\r\n\r\n"\'Miss Keeldar, stay one instant,\' said I, meeting her.\r\n\r\n"\'Why? the hall is too cold.\'\r\n\r\n"\'It is not cold for me; at my side it should not be cold for you.\'\r\n\r\n"\'But I shiver.\'\r\n\r\n"\'With fear, I believe. What makes you fear me? You are quiet and\r\ndistant. Why?\'\r\n\r\n"\'I may well fear what looks like a great dark goblin meeting me in the\r\nmoonlight.\'\r\n\r\n"\'_Do not--do not_ pass! Stay with me awhile. Let us exchange a few\r\nquiet words. It is three days since I spoke to you alone. Such changes\r\nare cruel.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I have no wish to be cruel,\' she responded, softly enough. Indeed\r\nthere was softness in her whole deportment--in her face, in her voice;\r\nbut there was also reserve, and an air fleeting, evanishing, intangible.\r\n\r\n"\'You certainly give me pain,\' said I. \'It is hardly a week since you\r\ncalled me your future husband and treated me as such. Now I am once more\r\nthe tutor for you. I am addressed as Mr. Moore and sir. Your lips have\r\nforgotten Louis.\'\r\n\r\n"\'No, Louis, no. It is an easy, liquid name--not soon forgotten.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Be cordial to Louis, then; approach him--let him approach.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I _am_ cordial,\' said she, hovering aloof like a white shadow.\r\n\r\n"\'Your voice is very sweet and very low,\' I answered, quietly advancing.\r\n\'You seem subdued, but still startled.\'\r\n\r\n"\'No--quite calm, and afraid of nothing,\' she assured me.\r\n\r\n"\'Of nothing but your votary.\'\r\n\r\n"I bent a knee to the flags at her feet.\r\n\r\n"\'You see I am in a new world, Mr. Moore. I don\'t know myself; I don\'t\r\nknow you. But rise. When you do so I feel troubled and disturbed.\'\r\n\r\n"I obeyed. It would not have suited me to retain that attitude long. I\r\ncourted serenity and confidence for her, and not vainly. She trusted and\r\nclung to me again.\r\n\r\n"\'Now, Shirley,\' I said, \'you can conceive I am far from happy in my\r\npresent uncertain, unsettled state.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Oh yes, you _are_ happy!\' she cried hastily. \'You don\'t know how happy\r\nyou are. Any change will be for the worse.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Happy or not, I cannot bear to go on so much longer. You are too\r\ngenerous to require it.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Be reasonable, Louis; be patient! I like you because you are patient.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Like me no longer, then; love me instead. Fix our marriage day; think\r\nof it to-night, and decide.\'\r\n\r\n"She breathed a murmur, inarticulate yet expressive; darted, or melted,\r\nfrom my arms--and I lost her."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE WINDING-UP.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, reader, we must settle accounts now. I have only briefly to narrate\r\nthe final fates of some of the personages whose acquaintance we have\r\nmade in this narrative, and then you and I must shake hands, and for the\r\npresent separate.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to the curates--to the much-loved, though long-neglected.\r\nCome forward, modest merit! Malone, I see, promptly answers the\r\ninvocation. He knows his own description when he hears it.\r\n\r\nNo, Peter Augustus; we can have nothing to say to you. It won\'t do.\r\nImpossible to trust ourselves with the touching tale of your deeds and\r\ndestinies. Are you not aware, Peter, that a discriminating public has\r\nits crotchets; that the unvarnished truth does not answer; that plain\r\nfacts will not digest? Do you not know that the squeak of the real pig\r\nis no more relished now than it was in days of yore? Were I to give the\r\ncatastrophe of your life and conversation, the public would sweep off in\r\nshrieking hysterics, and there would be a wild cry for sal-volatile and\r\nburnt feathers. "Impossible!" would be pronounced here; "untrue!" would\r\nbe responded there; "inartistic!" would be solemnly decided. Note well.\r\nWhenever you present the actual, simple truth, it is, somehow, always\r\ndenounced as a lie--they disown it, cast it off, throw it on the parish;\r\nwhereas the product of your own imagination, the mere figment, the sheer\r\nfiction, is adopted, petted, termed pretty, proper, sweetly natural--the\r\nlittle, spurious wretch gets all the comfits, the honest, lawful\r\nbantling all the cuffs. Such is the way of the world, Peter; and as you\r\nare the legitimate urchin, rude, unwashed, and naughty, you must stand\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nMake way for Mr. Sweeting.\r\n\r\nHere he comes, with his lady on his arm--the most splendid and the\r\nweightiest woman in Yorkshire--Mrs. Sweeting, formerly Miss Dora Sykes.\r\nThey were married under the happiest auspices, Mr. Sweeting having been\r\njust inducted to a comfortable living, and Mr. Sykes being in\r\ncircumstances to give Dora a handsome portion. They lived long and\r\nhappily together, beloved by their parishioners and by a numerous circle\r\nof friends.\r\n\r\nThere! I think the varnish has been put on very nicely.\r\n\r\nAdvance, Mr. Donne.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman turned out admirably--far better than either you or I\r\ncould possibly have expected, reader. He, too, married a most sensible,\r\nquiet, lady-like little woman. The match was the making of him. He\r\nbecame an exemplary domestic character, and a truly active parish priest\r\n(as a pastor he, to his dying day, conscientiously refused to act). The\r\noutside of the cup and platter he burnished up with the best\r\npolishing-powder; the furniture of the altar and temple he looked after\r\nwith the zeal of an upholsterer, the care of a cabinet-maker. His little\r\nschool, his little church, his little parsonage, all owed their erection\r\nto him; and they did him credit. Each was a model in its way. If\r\nuniformity and taste in architecture had been the same thing as\r\nconsistency and earnestness in religion, what a shepherd of a Christian\r\nflock Mr. Donne would have made! There was one art in the mastery of\r\nwhich nothing mortal ever surpassed Mr. Donne: it was that of begging.\r\nBy his own unassisted efforts he begged all the money for all his\r\nerections. In this matter he had a grasp of plan, a scope of action\r\nquite unique. He begged of high and low--of the shoeless cottage brat\r\nand the coroneted duke. He sent out begging-letters far and wide--to old\r\nQueen Charlotte, to the princesses her daughters, to her sons the royal\r\ndukes, to the Prince Regent, to Lord Castlereagh, to every member of the\r\nministry then in office; and, what is more remarkable, he screwed\r\nsomething out of every one of these personages. It is on record that he\r\ngot five pounds from the close-fisted old lady Queen Charlotte, and two\r\nguineas from the royal profligate her eldest son. When Mr. Donne set out\r\non begging expeditions, he armed himself in a complete suit of brazen\r\nmail. That you had given a hundred pounds yesterday was with him no\r\nreason why you should not give two hundred to-day. He would tell you so\r\nto your face, and, ten to one, get the money out of you. People gave to\r\nget rid of him. After all, he did some good with the cash. He was\r\nuseful in his day and generation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I ought to remark that on the premature and sudden vanishing of\r\nMr. Malone from the stage of Briarfield parish (you cannot know how it\r\nhappened, reader; your curiosity must be robbed to pay your elegant love\r\nof the pretty and pleasing), there came as his successor another Irish\r\ncurate, Mr. Macarthey. I am happy to be able to inform you, _with\r\ntruth_, that this gentleman did as much credit to his country as Malone\r\nhad done it discredit. He proved himself as decent, decorous, and\r\nconscientious as Peter was rampant, boisterous, and---- This last\r\nepithet I choose to suppress, because it would let the cat out of the\r\nbag. He laboured faithfully in the parish. The schools, both Sunday and\r\nday schools, flourished under his sway like green bay trees. Being\r\nhuman, of course he had his faults. These, however, were proper,\r\nsteady-going, clerical faults--what many would call virtues. The\r\ncircumstance of finding himself invited to tea with a Dissenter would\r\nunhinge him for a week. The spectacle of a Quaker wearing his hat in the\r\nchurch, the thought of an unbaptized fellow-creature being interred with\r\nChristian rites--these things could make strange havoc in Mr.\r\nMacarthey\'s physical and mental economy. Otherwise he was sane and\r\nrational, diligent and charitable.\r\n\r\nI doubt not a justice-loving public will have remarked, ere this, that I\r\nhave thus far shown a criminal remissness in pursuing, catching, and\r\nbringing to condign punishment the would-be assassin of Mr. Robert\r\nMoore. Here was a fine opening to lead my willing readers a dance, at\r\nonce decorous and exciting--a dance of law and gospel, of the dungeon,\r\nthe dock, and the "dead-thraw." You might have liked it, reader, but _I_\r\nshould not. I and my subject would presently have quarrelled, and then I\r\nshould have broken down. I was happy to find that facts perfectly\r\nexonerated me from the attempt. The murderer was never punished, for the\r\ngood reason that he was never caught--the result of the further\r\ncircumstance that he was never pursued. The magistrates made a\r\nshuffling, as if they were going to rise and do valiant things; but\r\nsince Moore himself, instead of urging and leading them as heretofore,\r\nlay still on his little cottage-couch, laughing in his sleeve, and\r\nsneering with every feature of his pale, foreign face, they considered\r\nbetter of it, and after fulfilling certain indispensable forms,\r\nprudently resolved to let the matter quietly drop, which they did.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore knew who had shot him, and all Briarfield knew. It was no\r\nother than Michael Hartley, the half-crazed weaver once before alluded\r\nto, a frantic Antinomian in religion, and a mad leveller in politics.\r\nThe poor soul died of delirium tremens a year after the attempt on\r\nMoore, and Robert gave his wretched widow a guinea to bury him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe winter is over and gone; spring has followed with beamy and shadowy,\r\nwith flowery and showery flight. We are now in the heart of summer--in\r\nmid-June--the June of 1812.\r\n\r\nIt is burning weather. The air is deep azure and red gold. It fits the\r\ntime; it fits the age; it fits the present spirit of the nations. The\r\nnineteenth century wantons in its giant adolescence; the Titan boy\r\nuproots mountains in his game, and hurls rocks in his wild sport. This\r\nsummer Bonaparte is in the saddle; he and his host scour Russian\r\ndeserts. He has with him Frenchmen and Poles, Italians and children of\r\nthe Rhine, six hundred thousand strong. He marches on old Moscow. Under\r\nold Moscow\'s walls the rude Cossack waits him. Barbarian stoic! he waits\r\nwithout fear of the boundless ruin rolling on. He puts his trust in a\r\nsnow-cloud; the wilderness, the wind, and the hail-storm are his refuge;\r\nhis allies are the elements--air, fire, water. And what are these? Three\r\nterrible archangels ever stationed before the throne of Jehovah. They\r\nstand clothed in white, girdled with golden girdles; they uplift vials,\r\nbrimming with the wrath of God. Their time is the day of vengeance;\r\ntheir signal, the word of the Lord of hosts, "thundering with the voice\r\nof His excellency."\r\n\r\n"Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the\r\ntreasures of the hail, which I have reserved against the time of\r\ntrouble, against the day of battle and war?\r\n\r\n"Go your ways. Pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth."\r\n\r\nIt is done. The earth is scorched with fire; the sea becomes "as the\r\nblood of a dead man;" the islands flee away; the mountains are not\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nIn this year, Lord Wellington assumed the reins in Spain. They made him\r\ngeneralissimo, for their own salvation\'s sake. In this year he took\r\nBadajos, he fought the field of Vittoria, he captured Pampeluna, he\r\nstormed San Sebastian; in this year he won Salamanca.\r\n\r\nMen of Manchester, I beg your pardon for this slight _r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9_ of warlike\r\nfacts, but it is of no consequence. Lord Wellington is, for you, only a\r\ndecayed old gentleman now. I rather think some of you have called him a\r\n"dotard;" you have taunted him with his age and the loss of his physical\r\nvigour. What fine heroes you are yourselves! Men like you have a right\r\nto trample on what is mortal in a demigod. Scoff at your ease; your\r\nscorn can never break his grand old heart.\r\n\r\nBut come, friends, whether Quakers or cotton-printers, let us hold a\r\npeace-congress, and let out our venom quietly. We have been talking with\r\nunseemly zeal about bloody battles and butchering generals; we arrive\r\nnow at a triumph in your line. On the 18th of June 1812 the Orders in\r\nCouncil were repealed, and the blockaded ports thrown open. You know\r\nvery well--such of you as are old enough to remember--you made Yorkshire\r\nand Lancashire shake with your shout on that occasion. The ringers\r\ncracked a bell in Briarfield belfry; it is dissonant to this day. The\r\nAssociation of Merchants and Manufacturers dined together at Stilbro\',\r\nand one and all went home in such a plight as their wives would never\r\nwish to witness more. Liverpool started and snorted like a river-horse\r\nroused amongst his reeds by thunder. Some of the American merchants felt\r\nthreatenings of apoplexy, and had themselves bled--all, like wise men,\r\nat this first moment of prosperity, prepared to rush into the bowels of\r\nspeculation, and to delve new difficulties, in whose depths they might\r\nlose themselves at some future day. Stocks which had been accumulating\r\nfor years now went off in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.\r\nWarehouses were lightened, ships were laden; work abounded, wages rose;\r\nthe good time seemed come. These prospects might be delusive, but they\r\nwere brilliant--to some they were even true. At that epoch, in that\r\nsingle month of June, many a solid fortune was realized.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen a whole province rejoices, the humblest of its inhabitants tastes a\r\nfestal feeling; the sound of public bells rouses the most secluded\r\nabode, as if with a call to be gay. And so Caroline Helstone thought,\r\nwhen she dressed herself more carefully than usual on the day of this\r\ntrading triumph, and went, attired in her neatest muslin, to spend the\r\nafternoon at Fieldhead, there to superintend certain millinery\r\npreparations for a great event, the last appeal in these matters being\r\nreserved for her unimpeachable taste. She decided on the wreath, the\r\nveil, the dress to be worn at the altar. She chose various robes and\r\nfashions for more ordinary occasions, without much reference to the\r\nbride\'s opinion--that lady, indeed, being in a somewhat impracticable\r\nmood.\r\n\r\nLouis had presaged difficulties, and he had found them--in fact, his\r\nmistress had shown herself exquisitely provoking, putting off her\r\nmarriage day by day, week by week, month by month, at first coaxing him\r\nwith soft pretences of procrastination, and in the end rousing his whole\r\ndeliberate but determined nature to revolt against her tyranny, at once\r\nso sweet and so intolerable.\r\n\r\nIt had needed a sort of tempest-shock to bring her to the point; but\r\nthere she was at last, fettered to a fixed day. There she lay, conquered\r\nby love, and bound with a vow.\r\n\r\nThus vanquished and restricted, she pined, like any other chained\r\ndenizen of deserts. Her captor alone could cheer her; his society only\r\ncould make amends for the lost privilege of liberty. In his absence she\r\nsat or wandered alone, spoke little, and ate less.\r\n\r\nShe furthered no preparations for her nuptials; Louis was himself\r\nobliged to direct all arrangements. He was virtually master of Fieldhead\r\nweeks before he became so nominally--the least presumptuous, the kindest\r\nmaster that ever was, but with his lady absolute. She abdicated without\r\na word or a struggle. "Go to Mr. Moore, ask Mr. Moore," was her answer\r\nwhen applied to for orders. Never was wooer of wealthy bride so\r\nthoroughly absolved from the subaltern part, so inevitably compelled to\r\nassume a paramount character.\r\n\r\nIn all this Miss Keeldar partly yielded to her disposition; but a remark\r\nshe made a year afterwards proved that she partly also acted on system.\r\n"Louis," she said, "would never have learned to rule if she had not\r\nceased to govern. The incapacity of the sovereign had developed the\r\npowers of the premier."\r\n\r\nIt had been intended that Miss Helstone should act as bridesmaid at the\r\napproaching nuptials, but Fortune had destined her another part.\r\n\r\nShe came home in time to water her plants. She had performed this little\r\ntask. The last flower attended to was a rose-tree, which bloomed in a\r\nquiet green nook at the back of the house. This plant had received the\r\nrefreshing shower; she was now resting a minute. Near the wall stood a\r\nfragment of sculptured stone--a monkish relic--once, perhaps, the base\r\nof a cross. She mounted it, that she might better command the view. She\r\nhad still the watering pot in one hand; with the other her pretty dress\r\nwas held lightly aside, to avoid trickling drops. She gazed over the\r\nwall, along some lonely fields; beyond three dusk trees, rising side by\r\nside against the sky; beyond a solitary thorn at the head of a solitary\r\nlane far off. She surveyed the dusk moors, where bonfires were kindling.\r\nThe summer evening was warm; the bell-music was joyous; the blue smoke\r\nof the fires looked soft, their red flame bright. Above them, in the sky\r\nwhence the sun had vanished, twinkled a silver point--the star of love.\r\n\r\nCaroline was not unhappy that evening--far otherwise; but as she gazed\r\nshe sighed, and as she sighed a hand circled her, and rested quietly on\r\nher waist. Caroline thought she knew who had drawn near; she received\r\nthe touch unstartled.\r\n\r\n"I am looking at Venus, mamma. See, she is beautiful. How white her\r\nlustre is, compared with the deep red of the bonfires!"\r\n\r\nThe answer was a closer caress; and Caroline turned, and looked, not\r\ninto Mrs. Pryor\'s matron face, but up at a dark manly visage. She\r\ndropped her watering-pot and stepped down from the pedestal.\r\n\r\n"I have been sitting with \'mamma\' an hour," said the intruder. "I have\r\nhad a long conversation with her. Where, meantime, have you been?"\r\n\r\n"To Fieldhead. Shirley is as naughty as ever, Robert. She will neither\r\nsay Yes nor No to any question put. She sits alone. I cannot tell\r\nwhether she is melancholy or nonchalant. If you rouse her or scold her,\r\nshe gives you a look, half wistful, half reckless, which sends you away\r\nas queer and crazed as herself. What Louis will make of her, I cannot\r\ntell. For my part, if I were a gentleman, I think I would not dare\r\nundertake her."\r\n\r\n"Never mind them. They were cut out for each other. Louis, strange to\r\nsay, likes her all the better for these freaks. He will manage her, if\r\nany one can. She tries him, however. He has had a stormy courtship for\r\nsuch a calm character; but you see it all ends in victory for him.\r\nCaroline, I have sought you to ask an audience. Why are those bells\r\nringing?"\r\n\r\n"For the repeal of your terrible law--the Orders you hate so much. You\r\nare pleased, are you not?"\r\n\r\n"Yesterday evening at this time I was packing some books for a\r\nsea-voyage. They were the only possessions, except some clothes, seeds,\r\nroots, and tools, which I felt free to take with me to Canada. I was\r\ngoing to leave you."\r\n\r\n"To leave me? To leave _me_?"\r\n\r\nHer little fingers fastened on his arm; she spoke and looked affrighted.\r\n\r\n"Not now--not now. Examine my face--yes, look at me well. Is the despair\r\nof parting legible thereon?"\r\n\r\nShe looked into an illuminated countenance, whose characters were all\r\nbeaming, though the page itself was dusk. This face, potent in the\r\nmajesty of its traits, shed down on her hope, fondness, delight.\r\n\r\n"Will the repeal do you good--_much_ good, _immediate_ good?" she\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n"The repeal of the Orders in Council saves me. Now I shall not turn\r\nbankrupt; now I shall not give up business; now I shall not leave\r\nEngland; now I shall be no longer poor; now I can pay my debts; now all\r\nthe cloth I have in my warehouses will be taken off my hands, and\r\ncommissions given me for much more. This day lays for my fortunes a\r\nbroad, firm foundation, on which, for the first time in my life, I can\r\nsecurely build."\r\n\r\nCaroline devoured his words; she held his hand in hers; she drew a long\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n"You are saved? Your heavy difficulties are lifted?"\r\n\r\n"They are lifted. I breathe. I can act."\r\n\r\n"At last! Oh, Providence is kind! Thank Him, Robert."\r\n\r\n"I do thank Providence."\r\n\r\n"And I also, for your sake!" She looked up devoutly.\r\n\r\n"Now I can take more workmen, give better wages, lay wiser and more\r\nliberal plans, do some good, be less selfish. _Now_, Caroline, I can\r\nhave a house--a home which I can truly call mine--and _now_----"\r\n\r\nHe paused, for his deep voice was checked.\r\n\r\n"And _now_," he resumed--"now I can think of marriage, _now_ I can seek\r\na wife."\r\n\r\nThis was no moment for her to speak. She did not speak.\r\n\r\n"Will Caroline, who meekly hopes to be forgiven as she forgives--will\r\nshe pardon all I have made her suffer, all that long pain I have\r\nwickedly caused her, all that sickness of body and mind she owed to me?\r\nWill she forget what she knows of my poor ambition, my sordid schemes?\r\nWill she let me expiate these things? Will she suffer me to prove that,\r\nas I once deserted cruelly, trifled wantonly, injured basely, I can now\r\nlove faithfully, cherish fondly, treasure tenderly?"\r\n\r\nHis hand was in Caroline\'s still; a gentle pressure answered him.\r\n\r\n"Is Caroline mine?"\r\n\r\n"Caroline is yours."\r\n\r\n"I will prize her. The sense of her value is here, in my heart; the\r\nnecessity for her society is blended with my life. Not more jealous\r\nshall I be of the blood whose flow moves my pulses than of her happiness\r\nand well-being."\r\n\r\n"I love you, too, Robert, and will take faithful care of you."\r\n\r\n"Will you take faithful care of me? Faithful care! As if that rose\r\nshould promise to shelter from tempest this hard gray stone! But she\r\n_will_ care for me, in her way. These hands will be the gentle\r\nministrants of every comfort I can taste. I know the being I seek to\r\nentwine with my own will bring me a solace, a charity, a purity, to\r\nwhich, of myself, I am a stranger."\r\n\r\nSuddenly Caroline was troubled; her lip quivered.\r\n\r\n"What flutters my dove?" asked Moore, as she nestled to and then\r\nuneasily shrank from him.\r\n\r\n"Poor mamma! I am all mamma has. Must I leave her?"\r\n\r\n"Do you know, I thought of that difficulty. I and \'mamma\' have discussed\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Tell me what you wish, what you would like, and I will consider if it\r\nis possible to consent. But I cannot desert her, even for you. I cannot\r\nbreak her heart, even for your sake."\r\n\r\n"She was faithful when I was false--was she not? I never came near your\r\nsick-bed, and she watched it ceaselessly."\r\n\r\n"What must I do? Anything but leave her."\r\n\r\n"At my wish you never shall leave her."\r\n\r\n"She may live very near us?"\r\n\r\n"With us--only she will have her own rooms and servant. For this she\r\nstipulates herself."\r\n\r\n"You know she has an income, that, with her habits, makes her quite\r\nindependent?"\r\n\r\n"She told me that, with a gentle pride that reminded me of somebody\r\nelse."\r\n\r\n"She is not at all interfering, and incapable of gossip."\r\n\r\n"I know her, Cary. But if, instead of being the personification of\r\nreserve and discretion, she were something quite opposite, I should not\r\nfear her."\r\n\r\n"Yet she will be your mother-in-law?" The speaker gave an arch little\r\nnod. Moore smiled.\r\n\r\n"Louis and I are not of the order of men who fear their mothers-in-law,\r\nCary. Our foes never have been, nor will be, those of our own household.\r\nI doubt not my mother-in-law will make much of me."\r\n\r\n"That she will--in her quiet way, you know. She is not demonstrative;\r\nand when you see her silent, or even cool, you must not fancy her\r\ndispleased; it is only a manner she has. Be sure to let me interpret for\r\nher whenever she puzzles you; always believe my account of the matter,\r\nRobert."\r\n\r\n"Oh, implicitly! Jesting apart, I feel that she and I will suit--_on ne\r\npeut mieux_. Hortense, you know, is exquisitely susceptible--in our\r\nFrench sense of the word--and not, perhaps, always reasonable in her\r\nrequirements; yet, dear, honest girl, I never painfully wounded her\r\nfeelings or had a serious quarrel with her in my life."\r\n\r\n"No; you are most generously considerate, indeed, most tenderly\r\nindulgent to her; and you will be considerate with mamma. You are a\r\ngentleman all through, Robert, to the bone, and nowhere so perfect a\r\ngentleman as at your own fireside."\r\n\r\n"A eulogium I like; it is very sweet. I am well pleased my Caroline\r\nshould view me in this light."\r\n\r\n"Mamma just thinks of you as I do."\r\n\r\n"Not quite, I hope?"\r\n\r\n"She does not want to marry you--don\'t be vain; but she said to me the\r\nother day, \'My dear, Mr. Moore has pleasing manners; he is one of the\r\nfew gentlemen I have seen who combine politeness with an air of\r\nsincerity.\'"\r\n\r\n"\'Mamma\' is rather a misanthropist, is she not? Not the best opinion of\r\nthe sterner sex?"\r\n\r\n"She forbears to judge them as a whole, but she has her exceptions whom\r\nshe admires--Louis and Mr. Hall, and, of late, yourself. She did not\r\nlike you once; I knew that, because she would never speak of you. But,\r\nRobert----"\r\n\r\n"Well, what now? What is the new thought?"\r\n\r\n"You have not seen my uncle yet?"\r\n\r\n"I have. \'Mamma\' called him into the room. He consents conditionally. If\r\nI prove that I can keep a wife, I may have her; and I _can_ keep her\r\nbetter than he thinks--better than I choose to boast."\r\n\r\n"If you get rich you will do good with your money, Robert?"\r\n\r\n"I _will_ do good; you shall tell me how. Indeed, I have some schemes of\r\nmy own, which you and I will talk about on our own hearth one day. I\r\nhave seen the necessity of doing good; I have learned the downright\r\nfolly of being selfish. Caroline, I foresee what I will now foretell.\r\nThis war _must_ ere long draw to a close. Trade is likely to prosper for\r\nsome years to come. There may be a brief misunderstanding between\r\nEngland and America, but that will not last. What would you think if,\r\none day--perhaps ere another ten years elapse--Louis and I divide\r\nBriarfield parish betwixt us? Louis, at any rate, is certain of power\r\nand property. He will not bury his talents. He is a benevolent fellow,\r\nand has, besides, an intellect of his own of no trifling calibre. His\r\nmind is slow but strong. It must work. It may work deliberately, but it\r\nwill work well. He will be made magistrate of the district--Shirley says\r\nhe shall. She would proceed impetuously and prematurely to obtain for\r\nhim this dignity, if he would let her, but he will not. As usual, he\r\nwill be in no haste. Ere he has been master of Fieldhead a year all the\r\ndistrict will feel his quiet influence, and acknowledge his unassuming\r\nsuperiority. A magistrate is wanted; they will, in time, invest him with\r\nthe office voluntarily and unreluctantly. Everybody admires his future\r\nwife, and everybody will, in time, like him. He is of the _p\xc3\xa2te_\r\ngenerally approved, _bon comme le pain_--daily bread for the most\r\nfastidious, good for the infant and the aged, nourishing for the poor,\r\nwholesome for the rich. Shirley, in spite of her whims and oddities, her\r\ndodges and delays, has an infatuated fondness for him. She will one day\r\nsee him as universally beloved as even _she_ could wish. He will also be\r\nuniversally esteemed, considered, consulted, depended on--too much so.\r\nHis advice will be always judicious, his help always good-natured. Ere\r\nlong both will be in inconvenient request. He will have to impose\r\nrestrictions. As for me, if I succeed as I intend to do, my success will\r\nadd to his and Shirley\'s income. I can double the value of their mill\r\nproperty. I can line yonder barren Hollow with lines of cottages and\r\nrows of cottage-gardens----"\r\n\r\n"Robert! And root up the copse?"\r\n\r\n"The copse shall be firewood ere five years elapse. The beautiful wild\r\nravine shall be a smooth descent; the green natural terrace shall be a\r\npaved street. There shall be cottages in the dark ravine, and cottages\r\non the lonely slopes. The rough pebbled track shall be an even, firm,\r\nbroad, black, sooty road, bedded with the cinders from my mill; and my\r\nmill, Caroline--my mill shall fill its present yard."\r\n\r\n"Horrible! You will change our blue hill-country air into the Stilbro\'\r\nsmoke atmosphere."\r\n\r\n"I will pour the waters of Pactolus through the valley of Briarfield."\r\n\r\n"I like the beck a thousand times better."\r\n\r\n"I will get an Act for enclosing Nunnely Common, and parcelling it out\r\ninto farms."\r\n\r\n"Stilbro\' Moor, however, defies you, thank Heaven! What can you grow in\r\nBilberry Moss? What will flourish on Rushedge?"\r\n\r\n"Caroline, the houseless, the starving, the unemployed shall come to\r\nHollow\'s Mill from far and near; and Joe Scott shall give them work, and\r\nLouis Moore, Esq., shall let them a tenement, and Mrs. Gill shall mete\r\nthem a portion till the first pay-day."\r\n\r\nShe smiled up in his face.\r\n\r\n"Such a Sunday school as you will have, Cary! such collections as you\r\nwill get! such a day school as you and Shirley and Miss Ainley will have\r\nto manage between you! The mill shall find salaries for a master and\r\nmistress, and the squire or the clothier shall give a treat once a\r\nquarter."\r\n\r\nShe mutely offered a kiss--an offer taken unfair advantage of, to the\r\nextortion of about a hundred kisses.\r\n\r\n"Extravagant day-dreams," said Moore, with a sigh and smile, "yet\r\nperhaps we may realize some of them. Meantime, the dew is falling. Mrs.\r\nMoore, I shall take you in."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is August. The bells clash out again, not only through Yorkshire, but\r\nthrough England. From Spain the voice of a trumpet has sounded long; it\r\nnow waxes louder and louder; it proclaims Salamanca won. This night is\r\nBriarfield to be illuminated. On this day the Fieldhead tenantry dine\r\ntogether; the Hollow\'s Mill workpeople will be assembled for a like\r\nfestal purpose; the schools have a grand treat. This morning there were\r\ntwo marriages solemnized in Briarfield church--Louis G\xc3\xa9rard Moore, Esq.,\r\nlate of Antwerp, to Shirley, daughter of the late Charles Cave Keeldar,\r\nEsq., of Fieldhead; Robert G\xc3\xa9rard Moore, Esq., of Hollow\'s Mill, to\r\nCaroline, niece of the Rev. Matthewson Helstone, M.A., rector of\r\nBriarfield.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony, in the first instance, was performed by Mr. Helstone,\r\nHiram Yorke, Esq., of Briarmains, giving the bride away. In the second\r\ninstance, Mr. Hall, vicar of Nunnely, officiated. Amongst the bridal\r\ntrain the two most noticeable personages were the youthful bridesmen,\r\nHenry Sympson and Martin Yorke.\r\n\r\nI suppose Robert Moore\'s prophecies were, partially at least, fulfilled.\r\nThe other day I passed up the Hollow, which tradition says was once\r\ngreen, and lone, and wild; and there I saw the manufacturer\'s day-dreams\r\nembodied in substantial stone and brick and ashes--the cinder-black\r\nhighway, the cottages, and the cottage gardens; there I saw a mighty\r\nmill, and a chimney ambitious as the tower of Babel. I told my old\r\nhousekeeper when I came home where I had been.\r\n\r\n"Ay," said she, "this world has queer changes. I can remember the old\r\nmill being built--the very first it was in all the district; and then I\r\ncan remember it being pulled down, and going with my lake-lasses\r\n[companions] to see the foundation-stone of the new one laid. The two\r\nMr. Moores made a great stir about it. They were there, and a deal of\r\nfine folk besides, and both their ladies; very bonny and grand they\r\nlooked. But Mrs. Louis was the grandest; she always wore such handsome\r\ndresses. Mrs. Robert was quieter like. Mrs. Louis smiled when she\r\ntalked. She had a real, happy, glad, good-natured look; but she had een\r\nthat pierced a body through. There is no such ladies nowadays."\r\n\r\n"What was the Hollow like then, Martha?"\r\n\r\n"Different to what it is now; but I can tell of it clean different\r\nagain, when there was neither mill, nor cot, nor hall, except Fieldhead,\r\nwithin two miles of it. I can tell, one summer evening, fifty years\r\nsyne, my mother coming running in just at the edge of dark, almost\r\nfleyed out of her wits, saying she had seen a fairish [fairy] in\r\nFieldhead Hollow; and that was the last fairish that ever was seen on\r\nthis countryside (though they\'ve been heard within these forty years). A\r\nlonesome spot it was, and a bonny spot, full of oak trees and nut trees.\r\nIt is altered now."\r\n\r\nThe story is told. I think I now see the judicious reader putting on his\r\nspectacles to look for the moral. It would be an insult to his sagacity\r\nto offer directions. I only say, God speed him in the quest!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESTABLISHED 1798\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nT. NELSON AND SONS\r\n\r\nPRINTERS AND PUBLISHERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NELSON CLASSICS.\r\n\r\n_Uniform with this Volume and Same Price._\r\n\r\n\r\n=Jack Sheppard.= HARRISON AINSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Masterman Ready.= CAPTAIN MARRYAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Michael Strogoff.= JULES VERNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Wide Wide World.= ELIZ. WETHERELL.\r\n\r\nThis famous American novel has for many years been a classic in every\r\nhome. It is a masterpiece of the best type of domestic fiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hereward the Wake.= CHARLES KINGSLEY.\r\n\r\nThis brilliant romance tells of the last stand of the great English\r\nleader, Hereward, against the advance of the Normans. The scene is\r\nlargely laid in the Fen country, and every page is a record of fierce\r\nstrife. The fall of Hereward is one of the greatest death scenes in\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n\r\n=David Copperfield--I.= CHARLES DICKENS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=David Copperfield--II.= CHARLES DICKENS.\r\n\r\n"David Copperfield" is, by general consent, Dickens\'s masterpiece,\r\nshowing, as it does, all his peculiar merits in their highest form. It\r\nis the most autobiographical of his novels, and the one into which he\r\nput most of his philosophy of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Jane Eyre.= CHARLOTTE BRONT\xc3\x8b.\r\n\r\n"Jane Eyre" is Charlotte Bront\xc3\xab\'s first and most famous work. It was the\r\nfirst realistic novel, in the modern sense of the word, in English\r\nliterature, and its influence has been beyond reckoning. It ranks as one\r\nof the great novels of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Verdant Green.= CUTHBERT BEDE.\r\n\r\nThis is the humorous classic of Oxford life. Published more than half a\r\ncentury ago, its humour is as fresh to-day as ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pickwick Papers--I.= CHARLES DICKENS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pickwick Papers--II.= CHARLES DICKENS.\r\n\r\nEvery year sees a new edition of "Pickwick," and the world still asks\r\nfor more. It is one of the world\'s greatest romances of the road, where\r\nadventures fall to those who seek them. It is also a faithful and loving\r\npicture of an older England, from which we have travelled far to-day. We\r\nmay become a wiser people, but we shall never again be so humorous.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Windsor Castle.= HARRISON AINSWORTH.\r\n\r\nThe romances of Harrison Ainsworth need no advertisement. In this, as in\r\nhis "Tower of London" and "Old St. Paul\'s," he has taken one of\r\nEngland\'s great historical sites, and woven around it an appropriate\r\nromance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Peg Woffington.= CHARLES READE.\r\n\r\n"Peg Woffington" was the first of Charles Reade\'s romances, and was\r\nfounded upon his comedy, "Masks and Faces." The story of the famous\r\nIrish actress who dazzled London in the eighteenth century, and with\r\nwhom Garrick was in love, has been made the foundation of a charming\r\nromance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character.= Dean RAMSAY.\r\n\r\nThe only book of jests that has ever attained an honourable place in\r\nliterature. Its wealth of genuine humour is a perpetual refutation of\r\nthe old slander that Scots joke "wi\' deeficulty."\r\n\r\n\r\n=Parables from Nature.= Mrs. GATTY.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the great children\'s books of the world. It was a classic\r\nin our grandmothers\' time, and possesses that imperishable charm which\r\nmakes it as attractive to-day as when it was first written.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lavengro.= GEORGE BORROW.\r\n\r\nThe greatest romance of the road in English literature, telling of all\r\nthe byways and humours of that older England which is fast disappearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Little Women.= LOUISA M. ALCOTT.\r\n\r\nThis delightful book has become a possession of childhood and youth. It\r\nhas captured the affections of millions of young people in two\r\ncontinents, and is certainly the finest piece of work in the whole range\r\nof Miss Alcott\'s breezy, hopeful, genial, and tender writings.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pride and Prejudice.= JANE AUSTEN.\r\n\r\n=Sense and Sensibility.= JANE AUSTEN.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott was among the earliest to detect the merits of Miss\r\nAusten\'s work, and of recent years her humour and her keen insight into\r\nhuman nature have been abundantly recognized, so that to-day she is\r\nprobably the most read novelist of her period. In Sir Walter Scott\'s\r\nphrase she possesses "the exquisite touch which renders ordinary\r\ncommonplace things and characters interesting."\r\n\r\n\r\n=Toilers of the Sea.= VICTOR HUGO.\r\n\r\n=The Laughing Man.= VICTOR HUGO.\r\n\r\n=Les Mis\xc3\xa9rables--I.= VICTOR HUGO.\r\n\r\n=Les Mis\xc3\xa9rables--II.= VICTOR HUGO.\r\n\r\n\r\n=\'Ninety-Three.= VICTOR HUGO.\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo took the romantic novel as invented by Sir Walter Scott and\r\ngave it a new and philosophic interest. All his great romances have a\r\npurpose. "Les Mis\xc3\xa9rables" exposes the tyranny of human laws; "The\r\nToilers of the Sea" shows the conflict of man with nature; "The Laughing\r\nMan" expounds the tyranny of the aristocratic ideal as exemplified in\r\nEngland. But being a great artist as well as a great thinker, he never\r\nturned his romances into pamphlets. Drama is always his aim, and no\r\nnovelist has attained more often the supreme dramatic moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Heir of Redclyffe.= C. M. YONGE.\r\n\r\nThis is a reprint of Miss Yonge\'s most famous tale. It has been said of\r\nher that she domesticated the historical romance, which owed its origin\r\nto Sir Walter Scott, and her characters were for long the ideal figures\r\nof most English households.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wild Wales.= GEORGE BORROW.\r\n\r\nThis book was the result of Borrow\'s wanderings after the publication of\r\n"Lavengro" and "The Romany Rye." He tramped on foot throughout the\r\ncountry, and the work is a classic of description, both of the scenery\r\nand people.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Cloister and the Hearth.= CHARLES READE.\r\n\r\nThere are many who think this the greatest of all historical novels, and\r\nit is certain that there are few better. It is not a story so much as a\r\nvast and varied transcript of life. It is also a delightful romance, and\r\nGerard and Margaret are among the immortals of fiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Romola.= GEORGE ELIOT.\r\n\r\nThis is the only novel of George Eliot\'s in which the scene is laid\r\noutside her own country. It is a story of Florence during the time of\r\nthe Renaissance, a marvellous picture of the intellectual and moral\r\nferment which the New Learning created. With amazing learning and\r\ninsight the author portrays the souls of men and women, and her study of\r\na weak man and a strong woman has rarely been surpassed in English\r\nliterature for dramatic power and moral truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Silas Marner.= GEORGE ELIOT.\r\n\r\nThis, the shortest and the most exquisite of George Eliot\'s tales,\r\nrepresents her great powers at their best. In the picture of the hero\r\nshe shows a profound understanding of human nature, and the feelings\r\nwhich were then moving rural and industrial England.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Abbot.= Sir WALTER SCOTT.\r\n\r\nOne of the Waverley novels which has always been deservedly popular.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bride of Lammermoor.= Sir WALTER SCOTT.\r\n\r\nThe story is a tragedy on the lines of Greek drama, and the ending has\r\nbeen pronounced by great critics to be the most moving in prose\r\nliterature. In the Master of Ravenswood, Scott has drawn perhaps his\r\ngreatest tragic figure, and in Caleb Balderstone one of his most\r\nhumorous creations.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Black Tulip.= ALEXANDRE DUMAS.\r\n\r\nThis was the last of Dumas\' great stories. It is a veritable _tour de\r\nforce_, for in it the reader follows with consuming interest the\r\nvicissitudes of a tulip, and the human element in the story is quite\r\nsubsidiary.

"Tom Cringle\'s Log" has been many times reprinted,\r\nand has lost nothing of its popularity and power to please.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lamb\'s Tales from Shakespeare.=\r\n\r\nTens of thousands of readers have been led to Shakespeare by the\r\ncharmingly told stories which Charles and Mary Lamb, about a hundred\r\nyears ago, extracted from the plays of the greatest dramatist of all\r\ntime. Though produced by Lamb at the very outset of his literary career,\r\nthese stories betray that unique and finished art, that delightful\r\nfreshness and rare sympathy, which are the characteristics of his mature\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Scarlet Letter.= NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most powerful and affecting stories ever conceived.\r\nOn its first appearance, in 1850, it immediately leaped high into public\r\nfavour, and attained the distinction of an unmistakable classic. The\r\ntragedy of Hester Prynne and Arthur Dimmesdale is wrought out in the\r\nmidst of an austere Puritan community, which exacts the bitterest\r\nexpiation for sin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NELSON CLASSICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Uniform with this Volume and Same Price_.\r\n\r\nCONDENSED LIST.\r\n\r\n     1.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
