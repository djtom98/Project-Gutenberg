If it were a record of a\r\nsolemn scientific expedition, it would have about it that gravity, that\r\nprofundity, and that impressive incomprehensibility which are so proper\r\nto works of that kind, and withal so attractive.  Yet notwithstanding it\r\nis only a record of a pic-nic, it has a purpose, which is to suggest to\r\nthe reader how he would be likely to see Europe and the East if he looked\r\nat them with his own eyes instead of the eyes of those who traveled in\r\nthose countries before him.  I make small pretense of showing anyone how\r\nhe ought to look at objects of interest beyond the sea--other books do\r\nthat, and therefore, even if I were competent to do it, there is no need.\r\n\r\nI offer no apologies for any departures from the usual style of\r\ntravel-writing that may be charged against me--for I think I have seen with\r\nimpartial eyes, and I am sure I have written at least honestly, whether\r\nwisely or not.\r\n\r\nIn this volume I have used portions of letters which I wrote for the\r\nDaily Alta California, of San Francisco, the proprietors of that journal\r\nhaving waived their rights and given me the necessary permission.  I have\r\nalso inserted portions of several letters written for the New York\r\nTribune and the New York Herald.\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR.\r\nSAN FRANCISCO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nFor months the great pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land was\r\nchatted about in the newspapers everywhere in America and discussed at\r\ncountless firesides.  It was a novelty in the way of excursions--its like\r\nhad not been thought of before, and it compelled that interest which\r\nattractive novelties always command.  It was to be a picnic on a gigantic\r\nscale.  The participants in it, instead of freighting an ungainly steam\r\nferry--boat with youth and beauty and pies and doughnuts, and paddling up\r\nsome obscure creek to disembark upon a grassy lawn and wear themselves\r\nout with a long summer day's laborious frolicking under the impression\r\nthat it was fun, were to sail away in a great steamship with flags flying\r\nand cannon pealing, and take a royal holiday beyond the broad ocean in\r\nmany a strange clime and in many a land renowned in history! They were to\r\nsail for months over the breezy Atlantic and the sunny Mediterranean;\r\nthey were to scamper about the decks by day, filling the ship with shouts\r\nand laughter--or read novels and poetry in the shade of the smokestacks,\r\nor watch for the jelly-fish and the nautilus over the side, and the\r\nshark, the whale, and other strange monsters of the deep; and at night\r\nthey were to dance in the open air, on the upper deck, in the midst of a\r\nballroom that stretched from horizon to horizon, and was domed by the\r\nbending heavens and lighted by no meaner lamps than the stars and the\r\nmagnificent moon--dance, and promenade, and smoke, and sing, and make\r\nlove, and search the skies for constellations that never associate with\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cBig Dipper\xe2\x80\x9d they were so tired of; and they were to see the ships of\r\ntwenty navies--the customs and costumes of twenty curious peoples--the\r\ngreat cities of half a world--they were to hob-nob with nobility and hold\r\nfriendly converse with kings and princes, grand moguls, and the anointed\r\nlords of mighty empires! It was a brave conception; it was the offspring\r\nof a most ingenious brain.  It was well advertised, but it hardly needed\r\nit: the bold originality, the extraordinary character, the seductive\r\nnature, and the vastness of the enterprise provoked comment everywhere\r\nand advertised it in every household in the land.  Who could read the\r\nprogram of the excursion without longing to make one of the party?  I will\r\ninsert it here.  It is almost as good as a map.  As a text for this book,\r\nnothing could be better:\r\n\r\n                   EXCURSION TO THE HOLY LAND, EGYPT,\r\n      THE CRIMEA, GREECE, AND INTERMEDIATE POINTS OF INTEREST.\r\n                     BROOKLYN, February 1st, 1867\r\n\r\n       The undersigned will make an excursion as above during the coming\r\n     season, and begs to submit to you the following programme:\r\n\r\n       A first-class steamer, to be under his own command, and capable of\r\n     accommodating at least one hundred and fifty cabin passengers, will\r\n     be selected, in which will be taken a select company, numbering not\r\n     more than   three-fourths of the ship's capacity.  There is good\r\n     reason to believe that this company can be easily made up in this\r\n     immediate vicinity, of mutual friends and acquaintances.\r\n\r\n       The steamer will be provided with every necessary comfort,\r\n     including library and musical instruments.\r\n\r\n       An experienced physician will be on board.\r\n\r\n       Leaving New York about June 1st, a middle and pleasant route will\r\n     be taken across the Atlantic, and passing through the group of\r\n     Azores, St. Michael will be reached in about ten days.  A day or two\r\n     will be spent here, enjoying the fruit and wild scenery of these\r\n     islands, and the voyage continued, and Gibraltar reached in three or\r\n     four days.\r\n\r\n       A day or two will be spent here in looking over the wonderful\r\n     subterraneous fortifications, permission to visit these galleries\r\n     being readily obtained.\r\n\r\n       From Gibraltar, running along the coasts of Spain and France,\r\n     Marseilles will be reached in three days.  Here ample time will be\r\n     given not only to look over the city, which was founded six hundred\r\n     years before the Christian era, and its artificial port, the finest\r\n     of the kind in the Mediterranean, but to visit Paris during the\r\n     Great Exhibition; and the beautiful city of Lyons, lying\r\n     intermediate, from the heights of which, on a clear day, Mont Blanc\r\n     and the Alps can be distinctly seen.  Passengers who may wish to\r\n     extend the time at Paris can do so, and, passing down through\r\n     Switzerland, rejoin the steamer at Genoa.\r\n\r\n       From Marseilles to Genoa is a run of one night.  The excursionists\r\n     will have an opportunity to look over this, the \xe2\x80\x9cmagnificent city of\r\n     palaces,\xe2\x80\x9d and visit the birthplace of Columbus, twelve miles off,\r\n     over a beautiful road built by Napoleon I.  From this point,\r\n     excursions may be made to Milan, Lakes Como and Maggiore, or to\r\n     Milan, Verona (famous for its extraordinary fortifications), Padua,\r\n     and Venice.  Or, if passengers desire to visit Parma (famous for\r\n     Correggio's frescoes) and Bologna, they can by rail go on to\r\n     Florence, and rejoin the steamer at Leghorn, thus spending about\r\n     three weeks amid the cities most famous for art in Italy.\r\n\r\n       From Genoa the run to Leghorn will be made along the coast in one\r\n     night, and time appropriated to this point in which to visit\r\n     Florence, its palaces and galleries; Pisa, its cathedral and\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cLeaning Tower,\xe2\x80\x9d and Lucca and its baths, and Roman amphitheater;\r\n     Florence, the most remote, being distant by rail about sixty miles.\r\n\r\n       From Leghorn to Naples (calling at Civita Vecchia to land any who\r\n     may prefer to go to Rome from that point), the distance will be made\r\n     in about thirty-six hours; the route will lay along the coast of\r\n     Italy, close by Caprera, Elba, and Corsica.  Arrangements have been\r\n     made to take on board at Leghorn a pilot for Caprera, and, if\r\n     practicable, a call will be made there to visit the home of\r\n     Garibaldi.\r\n\r\n       Rome [by rail], Herculaneum, Pompeii, Vesuvius, Vergil's tomb, and\r\n     possibly the ruins of Paestum can be visited, as well as the\r\n     beautiful surroundings of Naples and its charming bay.\r\n\r\n       The next point of interest will be Palermo, the most beautiful\r\n     city of Sicily, which will be reached in one night from Naples.  A\r\n     day will be spent here, and leaving in the evening, the course will\r\n     be taken towards Athens.\r\n\r\n       Skirting along the north coast of Sicily, passing through the\r\n     group of Aeolian Isles, in sight of Stromboli and Vulcania, both\r\n     active volcanoes, through the Straits of Messina, with \xe2\x80\x9cScylla\xe2\x80\x9d on\r\n     the one hand and \xe2\x80\x9cCharybdis\xe2\x80\x9d on the other, along the east coast of\r\n     Sicily, and in sight of Mount Etna, along the south coast of Italy,\r\n     the west and south coast of Greece, in sight of ancient Crete, up\r\n     Athens Gulf, and into the Piraeus, Athens will be reached in two and\r\n     a half or three days.  After tarrying here awhile, the Bay of\r\n     Salamis will be crossed, and a day given to Corinth, whence the\r\n     voyage will be continued to Constantinople, passing on the way\r\n     through the Grecian Archipelago, the Dardanelles, the Sea of\r\n     Marmora, and the mouth of the Golden Horn, and arriving in about\r\n     forty-eight hours from Athens.\r\n\r\n       After leaving Constantinople, the way will be taken out through\r\n     the beautiful Bosphorus, across the Black Sea to Sebastopol and\r\n     Balaklava, a run of about twenty-four hours.  Here it is proposed to\r\n     remain two days, visiting the harbors, fortifications, and\r\n     battlefields of the Crimea; thence back through the Bosphorus,\r\n     touching at Constantinople to take in any who may have preferred to\r\n     remain there; down through the Sea of Marmora and the Dardanelles,\r\n     along the coasts of ancient Troy and Lydia in Asia, to Smyrna, which\r\n     will be reached in two or two and a half days from Constantinople.\r\n     A sufficient stay will be made here to give opportunity of visiting\r\n     Ephesus, fifty miles distant by rail.\r\n\r\n       From Smyrna towards the Holy Land the course will lay through the\r\n     Grecian  Archipelago, close by the Isle of Patmos, along the coast\r\n     of Asia, ancient Pamphylia, and the Isle of Cyprus.  Beirut will be\r\n     reached in three days.  At Beirut time will be given to visit\r\n     Damascus; after which the steamer will proceed to Joppa.\r\n\r\n       From Joppa, Jerusalem, the River Jordan, the Sea of Tiberias,\r\n     Nazareth, Bethany, Bethlehem, and other points of interest in the\r\n     Holy Land can be visited, and here those who may have preferred to\r\n     make the journey from Beirut through the country, passing through\r\n     Damascus, Galilee, Capernaum, Samaria, and by the River Jordan and\r\n     Sea of Tiberias, can rejoin the steamer.\r\n\r\n       Leaving Joppa, the next point of interest to visit will be\r\n     Alexandria, which will be reached in twenty-four hours.  The ruins\r\n     of Caesar's Palace, Pompey's Pillar, Cleopatra's Needle, the\r\n     Catacombs, and ruins of ancient Alexandria will be found worth the\r\n     visit.  The journey to Cairo, one hundred and thirty miles by rail,\r\n     can be made in a few hours, and from which can be visited the site\r\n     of ancient Memphis, Joseph's Granaries, and the Pyramids.\r\n\r\n       From Alexandria the route will be taken homeward, calling at\r\n     Malta, Cagliari (in Sardinia), and Palma (in Majorca), all\r\n     magnificent harbors, with charming scenery, and abounding in fruits.\r\n\r\n       A day or two will be spent at each place, and leaving Parma in the\r\n     evening, Valencia in Spain will be reached the next morning.  A few\r\n     days will be spent in this, the finest city of Spain.\r\n\r\n       From Valencia, the homeward course will be continued, skirting\r\n     along the coast of Spain.  Alicant, Carthagena, Palos, and Malaga\r\n     will be passed but a mile or two distant, and Gibraltar reached in\r\n     about twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n       A stay of one day will be made here, and the voyage continued to\r\n     Madeira, which will be reached in about three days.  Captain\r\n     Marryatt writes: \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know a spot on the globe which so much\r\n     astonishes and delights upon first arrival as Madeira.\xe2\x80\x9d A stay of\r\n     one or two days will be made here, which, if time permits, may be\r\n     extended, and passing on through the islands, and probably in sight\r\n     of the Peak of Teneriffe, a southern track will be taken, and the\r\n     Atlantic crossed within the latitudes of the northeast trade winds,\r\n     where mild and pleasant weather, and a smooth sea, can always be\r\n     expected.\r\n\r\n       A call will be made at Bermuda, which lies directly in this route\r\n     homeward, and will be reached in about ten days from Madeira, and\r\n     after spending a short time with our friends the Bermudians, the\r\n     final departure will be made for home, which will be reached in\r\n     about three days.\r\n\r\n       Already, applications have been received from parties in Europe\r\n     wishing to join the Excursion there.\r\n\r\n       The ship will at all times be a home, where the excursionists, if\r\n     sick, will be surrounded by kind friends, and have all possible\r\n     comfort and sympathy.\r\n\r\n       Should contagious sickness exist in any of the ports named in the\r\n     program, such ports will be passed, and others of interest\r\n     substituted.\r\n\r\n       The price of passage is fixed at $1,250, currency, for each adult\r\n     passenger.  Choice of rooms and of seats at the tables apportioned\r\n     in the order in which passages are engaged; and no passage\r\n     considered engaged until ten percent of the passage money is\r\n     deposited with the treasurer.\r\n\r\n       Passengers can remain on board of the steamer, at all ports, if\r\n     they desire, without additional expense, and all boating at the\r\n     expense of the ship.\r\n\r\n       All passages must be paid for when taken, in order that the most\r\n     perfect arrangements be made for starting at the appointed time.\r\n\r\n       Applications for passage must be approved by the committee before\r\n     tickets are issued, and can be made to the undersigned.\r\n\r\n       Articles of interest or curiosity, procured by the passengers\r\n     during the voyage, may be brought home in the steamer free of\r\n     charge.\r\n\r\n       Five dollars per day, in gold, it is believed, will be a fair\r\n     calculation to make for all traveling expenses onshore and at the\r\n     various points where passengers may wish to leave the steamer for\r\n     days at a time.\r\n\r\n       The trip can be extended, and the route changed, by unanimous vote\r\n     of the passengers.\r\n\r\n      CHAS.

T.\r\n     H*****, Esq. C.  C.  DUNCAN\r\n\r\n       P.S.--The very beautiful and substantial side-wheel steamship\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c__Quaker City__\xe2\x80\x9d has been chartered for the occasion, and will leave\r\n     New York June 8th.  Letters have been issued by the government\r\n     commending the party to courtesies abroad.\r\n\r\nWhat was there lacking about that program to make it perfectly\r\nirresistible?  Nothing that any finite mind could discover.  Paris,\r\nEngland, Scotland, Switzerland, Italy--Garibaldi! The Grecian\r\nArchipelago! Vesuvius! Constantinople! Smyrna! The Holy Land! Egypt and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cour friends the Bermudians\xe2\x80\x9d! People in Europe desiring to join the\r\nexcursion--contagious sickness to be avoided--boating at the expense of\r\nthe ship--physician on board--the circuit of the globe to be made if the\r\npassengers unanimously desired it--the company to be rigidly selected by\r\na pitiless \xe2\x80\x9cCommittee on Applications\xe2\x80\x9d--the vessel to be as rigidly\r\nselected by as pitiless a \xe2\x80\x9cCommittee on Selecting Steamer.\xe2\x80\x9d Human nature\r\ncould not withstand these bewildering temptations.  I hurried to the\r\ntreasurer's office and deposited my ten percent.  I rejoiced to know that\r\na few vacant staterooms were still left.  I did avoid a critical personal\r\nexamination into my character by that bowelless committee, but I referred\r\nto all the people of high standing I could think of in the community who\r\nwould be least likely to know anything about me.\r\n\r\nShortly a supplementary program was issued which set forth that the\r\nPlymouth Collection of Hymns would be used on board the ship.  I then\r\npaid the balance of my passage money.\r\n\r\nI was provided with a receipt and duly and officially accepted as an\r\nexcursionist.  There was happiness in that but it was tame compared to\r\nthe novelty of being \xe2\x80\x9cselect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis supplementary program also instructed the excursionists to provide\r\nthemselves with light musical instruments for amusement in the ship, with\r\nsaddles for Syrian travel, green spectacles and umbrellas, veils for\r\nEgypt, and substantial clothing to use in rough pilgrimizing in the Holy\r\nLand.  Furthermore, it was suggested that although the ship's library\r\nwould afford a fair amount of reading matter, it would still be well if\r\neach passenger would provide himself with a few guidebooks, a Bible, and\r\nsome standard works of travel.  A list was appended, which consisted\r\nchiefly of books relating to the Holy Land, since the Holy Land was part\r\nof the excursion and seemed to be its main feature.\r\n\r\nReverend Henry Ward Beecher was to have accompanied the expedition, but\r\nurgent duties obliged him to give up the idea.  There were other\r\npassengers who could have been spared better and would have been spared\r\nmore willingly.  Lieutenant General Sherman was to have been of the party\r\nalso, but the Indian war compelled his presence on the plains.  A popular\r\nactress had entered her name on the ship's books, but something\r\ninterfered and she couldn't go.  The \xe2\x80\x9cDrummer Boy of the Potomac\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n deserted, and lo, we had never a celebrity left!\r\n\r\nHowever, we were to have a \xe2\x80\x9cbattery of guns\xe2\x80\x9d from the Navy Department (as\r\nper advertisement) to be used in answering royal salutes; and the\r\ndocument furnished by the Secretary of the Navy, which was to make\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Sherman and party\xe2\x80\x9d welcome guests in the courts and camps of the\r\nold world, was still left to us, though both document and battery, I\r\nthink, were shorn of somewhat of their original august proportions.\r\nHowever, had not we the seductive program still, with its Paris, its\r\nConstantinople, Smyrna, Jerusalem, Jericho, and \xe2\x80\x9cour friends the\r\nBermudians?\xe2\x80\x9d What did we care?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, during the following month, I dropped in at 117 Wall Street\r\nto inquire how the repairing and refurnishing of the vessel was coming\r\non, how additions to the passenger list were averaging, how many people\r\nthe committee were decreeing not \xe2\x80\x9cselect\xe2\x80\x9d every day and banishing in\r\nsorrow and tribulation.  I was glad to know that we were to have a little\r\nprinting press on board and issue a daily newspaper of our own.  I was\r\nglad to learn that our piano, our parlor organ, and our melodeon were to\r\nbe the best instruments of the kind that could be had in the market.  I\r\nwas proud to observe that among our excursionists were three ministers of\r\nthe gospel, eight doctors, sixteen or eighteen ladies, several military\r\nand naval chieftains with sounding titles, an ample crop of \xe2\x80\x9cProfessors\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n of various kinds, and a gentleman who had \xe2\x80\x9cCOMMISSIONER OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES OF AMERICA TO EUROPE, ASIA, AND AFRICA\xe2\x80\x9d thundering after his name\r\nin one awful blast!  I had carefully prepared myself to take rather a\r\nback seat in that ship because of the uncommonly select material that\r\nwould alone be permitted to pass through the camel's eye of that\r\ncommittee on credentials; I had schooled myself to expect an imposing\r\narray of military and naval heroes and to have to set that back seat\r\nstill further back in consequence of it maybe; but I state frankly that I\r\nwas all unprepared for this crusher.\r\n\r\nI fell under that titular avalanche a torn and blighted thing.  I said\r\nthat if that potentate must go over in our ship, why, I supposed he must\r\n--but that to my thinking, when the United States considered it necessary\r\nto send a dignitary of that tonnage across the ocean, it would be in\r\nbetter taste, and safer, to take him apart and cart him over in sections\r\nin several ships.\r\n\r\nAh, if I had only known then that he was only a common mortal, and that\r\nhis mission had nothing more overpowering about it than the collecting of\r\nseeds and uncommon yams and extraordinary cabbages and peculiar bullfrogs\r\nfor that poor, useless, innocent, mildewed old fossil the Smithsonian\r\nInstitute, I would have felt so much relieved.\r\n\r\nDuring that memorable month I basked in the happiness of being for once\r\nin my life drifting with the tide of a great popular movement.  Everybody\r\nwas going to Europe--I, too, was going to Europe.  Everybody was going to\r\nthe famous Paris Exposition--I, too, was going to the Paris Exposition.\r\nThe steamship lines were carrying Americans out of the various ports of\r\nthe country at the rate of four or five thousand a week in the aggregate.\r\nIf I met a dozen individuals during that month who were not going to\r\nEurope shortly, I have no distinct remembrance of it now.  I walked about\r\nthe city a good deal with a young Mr.  Blucher, who was booked for the\r\nexcursion.  He was confiding, good-natured, unsophisticated,\r\ncompanionable; but he was not a man to set the river on fire.  He had the\r\nmost extraordinary notions about this European exodus and came at last to\r\nconsider the whole nation as packing up for emigration to France.  We\r\nstepped into a store on Broadway one day, where he bought a handkerchief,\r\nand when the man could not make change, Mr. B. said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, I'll hand it to you in Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not going to Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is--what did I understand you to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said I am not going to Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot going to Paris!  Not g---- well, then, where in the nation are you\r\ngoing to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNowhere at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot anywhere whatsoever?--not any place on earth but this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot any place at all but just this--stay here all summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy comrade took his purchase and walked out of the store without a word\r\n--walked out with an injured look upon his countenance.  Up the street\r\napiece he broke silence and said impressively: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a lie--that is my\r\nopinion of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the fullness of time the ship was ready to receive her passengers.\r\nI was introduced to the young gentleman who was to be my roommate, and\r\nfound him to be intelligent, cheerful of spirit, unselfish, full of\r\ngenerous impulses, patient, considerate, and wonderfully good-natured.\r\nNot any passenger that sailed in the __Quaker City__ will withhold his\r\nendorsement of what I have just said.  We selected a stateroom forward of\r\nthe wheel, on the starboard side, \xe2\x80\x9cbelow decks.\xe2\x80\x9d  It had two berths in\r\nit, a dismal dead-light, a sink with a washbowl in it, and a long,\r\nsumptuously cushioned locker, which was to do service as a sofa--partly\r\n--and partly as a hiding place for our things.  Notwithstanding all this\r\nfurniture, there was still room to turn around in, but not to swing a cat\r\nin, at least with entire security to the cat.  However, the room was\r\nlarge, for a ship's stateroom, and was in every way satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe vessel was appointed to sail on a certain Saturday early in June.\r\n\r\nA little after noon on that distinguished Saturday I reached the ship and\r\nwent on board.  All was bustle and confusion.  [I have seen that remark\r\nbefore somewhere.]  The pier was crowded with carriages and men;\r\npassengers were arriving and hurrying on board; the vessel's decks were\r\nencumbered with trunks and valises; groups of excursionists, arrayed in\r\nunattractive traveling costumes, were moping about in a drizzling rain\r\nand looking as droopy and woebegone as so many molting chickens.  The\r\ngallant flag was up, but it was under the spell, too, and hung limp and\r\ndisheartened by the mast.  Altogether, it was the bluest, bluest\r\nspectacle!  It was a pleasure excursion--there was no gainsaying that,\r\nbecause the program said so--it was so nominated in the bond--but it\r\nsurely hadn't the general aspect of one.\r\n\r\nFinally, above the banging, and rumbling, and shouting, and hissing of\r\nsteam rang the order to \xe2\x80\x9ccast off!\xe2\x80\x9d--a sudden rush to the gangways--a\r\nscampering ashore of visitors--a revolution of the wheels, and we were\r\noff--the pic-nic was begun!  Two very mild cheers went up from the\r\ndripping crowd on the pier; we answered them gently from the slippery\r\ndecks; the flag made an effort to wave, and failed; the \xe2\x80\x9cbattery of guns\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n spake not--the ammunition was out.\r\n\r\nWe steamed down to the foot of the harbor and came to anchor.  It was\r\nstill raining.  And not only raining, but storming.  \xe2\x80\x9cOutside\xe2\x80\x9d we could\r\nsee, ourselves, that there was a tremendous sea on.  We must lie still,\r\nin the calm harbor, till the storm should abate.  Our passengers hailed\r\nfrom fifteen states; only a few of them had ever been to sea before;\r\nmanifestly it would not do to pit them against a full-blown tempest until\r\nthey had got their sea-legs on.  Toward evening the two steam tugs that\r\nhad accompanied us with a rollicking champagne-party of young New Yorkers\r\non board who wished to bid farewell to one of our number in due and\r\nancient form departed, and we were alone on the deep.  On deep five\r\nfathoms, and anchored fast to the bottom.  And out in the solemn rain, at\r\nthat.  This was pleasuring with a vengeance.\r\n\r\nIt was an appropriate relief when the gong sounded for prayer meeting.\r\nThe first Saturday night of any other pleasure excursion might have been\r\ndevoted to whist and dancing; but I submit it to the unprejudiced mind if\r\nit would have been in good taste for us to engage in such frivolities,\r\nconsidering what we had gone through and the frame of mind we were in.\r\nWe would have shone at a wake, but not at anything more festive.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is always a cheering influence about the sea; and in my\r\nberth that night, rocked by the measured swell of the waves and lulled by\r\nthe murmur of the distant surf, I soon passed tranquilly out of all\r\nconsciousness of the dreary experiences of the day and damaging\r\npremonitions of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nAll day Sunday at anchor.  The storm had gone down a great deal, but the\r\nsea had not.  It was still piling its frothy hills high in air \xe2\x80\x9coutside,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n as we could plainly see with the glasses.  We could not properly begin a\r\npleasure excursion on Sunday; we could not offer untried stomachs to so\r\npitiless a sea as that.  We must lie still till Monday.  And we did.  But\r\nwe had repetitions of church and prayer-meetings; and so, of course, we\r\nwere just as eligibly situated as we could have been any where.\r\n\r\nI was up early that Sabbath morning and was early to breakfast.  I felt a\r\nperfectly natural desire to have a good, long, unprejudiced look at the\r\npassengers at a time when they should be free from self-consciousness\r\n--which is at breakfast, when such a moment occurs in the lives of human\r\nbeings at all.\r\n\r\nI was greatly surprised to see so many elderly people--I might almost\r\nsay, so many venerable people.  A glance at the long lines of heads was\r\napt to make one think it was all gray.  But it was not.  There was a\r\ntolerably fair sprinkling of young folks, and another fair sprinkling of\r\ngentlemen and ladies who were non-committal as to age, being neither\r\nactually old or absolutely young.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we weighed anchor and went to sea.  It was a great\r\nhappiness to get away after this dragging, dispiriting delay.  I thought\r\nthere never was such gladness in the air before, such brightness in the\r\nsun, such beauty in the sea.  I was satisfied with the picnic then and\r\nwith all its belongings.  All my malicious instincts were dead within me;\r\nand as America faded out of sight, I think a spirit of charity rose up in\r\ntheir place that was as boundless, for the time being, as the broad ocean\r\nthat was heaving its billows about us.  I wished to express my feelings\r\n--I wished to lift up my voice and sing; but I did not know anything to\r\nsing, and so I was obliged to give up the idea.  It was no loss to the\r\nship, though, perhaps.\r\n\r\nIt was breezy and pleasant, but the sea was still very rough.  One could\r\nnot promenade without risking his neck; at one moment the bowsprit was\r\ntaking a deadly aim at the sun in midheaven, and at the next it was\r\ntrying to harpoon a shark in the bottom of the ocean.  What a weird\r\nsensation it is to feel the stern of a ship sinking swiftly from under you\r\nand see the bow climbing high away among the clouds!  One's safest course\r\nthat day was to clasp a railing and hang on; walking was too precarious a\r\npastime.\r\n\r\nBy some happy fortune I was not seasick.--That was a thing to be proud\r\nof.  I had not always escaped before.  If there is one thing in the world\r\nthat will make a man peculiarly and insufferably self-conceited, it is to\r\nhave his stomach behave itself, the first day at sea, when nearly all his\r\ncomrades are seasick.  Soon a venerable fossil, shawled to the chin and\r\nbandaged like a mummy, appeared at the door of the after deck-house, and\r\nthe next lurch of the ship shot him into my arms.  I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning, Sir.  It is a fine day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his hand on his stomach and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my!\xe2\x80\x9d and then staggered\r\naway and fell over the coop of a skylight.\r\n\r\nPresently another old gentleman was projected from the same door with\r\ngreat violence.  I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCalm yourself, Sir--There is no hurry.  It is a fine day, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe, also, put his hand on his stomach and said \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my!\xe2\x80\x9d and reeled away.\r\n\r\nIn a little while another veteran was discharged abruptly from the same\r\ndoor, clawing at the air for a saving support.  I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Sir.  It is a fine day for pleasuring.  You were about to\r\nsay--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought so.  I anticipated him, anyhow.  I stayed there and was\r\nbombarded with old gentlemen for an hour, perhaps; and all I got out of\r\nany of them was \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went away then in a thoughtful mood.  I said, this is a good pleasure\r\nexcursion.  I like it.  The passengers are not garrulous, but still they\r\nare sociable.  I like those old people, but somehow they all seem to have\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my\xe2\x80\x9d rather bad.\r\n\r\nI knew what was the matter with them.  They were seasick.  And I was glad\r\nof it.  We all like to see people seasick when we are not, ourselves.\r\nPlaying whist by the cabin lamps when it is storming outside is pleasant;\r\nwalking the quarterdeck in the moonlight is pleasant; smoking in the\r\nbreezy foretop is pleasant when one is not afraid to go up there; but\r\nthese are all feeble and commonplace compared with the joy of seeing\r\npeople suffering the miseries of seasickness.\r\n\r\nI picked up a good deal of information during the afternoon.  At one time\r\nI was climbing up the quarterdeck when the vessel's stem was in the sky;\r\nI was smoking a cigar and feeling passably comfortable.  Somebody\r\nejaculated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, that won't answer.  Read the sign up there--NO SMOKING ABAFT\r\nTHE WHEEL!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Captain Duncan, chief of the expedition.  I went forward, of\r\ncourse.  I saw a long spyglass lying on a desk in one of the upper-deck\r\nstate-rooms back of the pilot-house and reached after it--there was a\r\nship in the distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah--hands off!  Come out of that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI came out of that.  I said to a deck-sweep--but in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that overgrown pirate with the whiskers and the discordant\r\nvoice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's Captain Bursley--executive officer--sailing master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI loitered about awhile, and then, for want of something better to do,\r\nfell to carving a railing with my knife.  Somebody said, in an\r\ninsinuating, admonitory voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, say--my friend--don't you know any better than to be whittling the\r\nship all to pieces that way?  You ought to know better than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went back and found the deck sweep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that smooth-faced, animated outrage yonder in the fine clothes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's Captain L****, the owner of the ship--he's one of the main\r\nbosses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the course of time I brought up on the starboard side of the\r\npilot-house and found a sextant lying on a bench.  Now, I said, they\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctake the sun\xe2\x80\x9d through this thing; I should think I might see that vessel\r\nthrough it.  I had hardly got it to my eye when someone touched me on the\r\nshoulder and said deprecatingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll have to get you to give that to me, Sir.  If there's anything you'd\r\nlike to know about taking the sun, I'd as soon tell you as not--but I\r\ndon't like to trust anybody with that instrument.  If you want any\r\nfiguring done--Aye, aye, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was gone to answer a call from the other side.  I sought the\r\ndeck-sweep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that spider-legged gorilla yonder with the sanctimonious\r\ncountenance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's Captain Jones, sir--the chief mate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell.  This goes clear away ahead of anything I ever heard of before.\r\nDo you--now I ask you as a man and a brother--do you think I could\r\nventure to throw a rock here in any given direction without hitting a\r\ncaptain of this ship?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, I don't know--I think likely you'd fetch the captain of the\r\nwatch may be, because he's a-standing right yonder in the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went below--meditating and a little downhearted.  I thought, if five\r\ncooks can spoil a broth, what may not five captains do with a pleasure\r\nexcursion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nWe plowed along bravely for a week or more, and without any conflict of\r\njurisdiction among the captains worth mentioning.  The passengers soon\r\nlearned to accommodate themselves to their new circumstances, and life in\r\nthe ship became nearly as systematically monotonous as the routine of a\r\nbarrack.  I do not mean that it was dull, for it was not entirely so by\r\nany means--but there was a good deal of sameness about it.  As is always\r\nthe fashion at sea, the passengers shortly began to pick up sailor terms\r\n--a sign that they were beginning to feel at home.  Half-past six was no\r\nlonger half-past six to these pilgrims from New England, the South, and\r\nthe Mississippi Valley, it was \xe2\x80\x9cseven bells\xe2\x80\x9d; eight, twelve, and four\r\no'clock were \xe2\x80\x9ceight bells\xe2\x80\x9d; the captain did not take the longitude at\r\nnine o'clock, but at \xe2\x80\x9ctwo bells.\xe2\x80\x9d  They spoke glibly of the \xe2\x80\x9cafter\r\ncabin,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cfor'rard cabin,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cport and starboard\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cfo'castle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt seven bells the first gong rang; at eight there was breakfast, for\r\nsuch as were not too seasick to eat it.  After that all the well people\r\nwalked arm-in-arm up and down the long promenade deck, enjoying the fine\r\nsummer mornings, and the seasick ones crawled out and propped themselves\r\nup in the lee of the paddle-boxes and ate their dismal tea and toast, and\r\nlooked wretched.  From eleven o'clock until luncheon, and from luncheon\r\nuntil dinner at six in the evening, the employments and amusements were\r\nvarious.  Some reading was done, and much smoking and sewing, though not\r\nby the same parties; there were the monsters of the deep to be looked\r\nafter and wondered at; strange ships had to be scrutinized through\r\nopera-glasses, and sage decisions arrived at concerning them; and more\r\nthan that, everybody took a personal interest in seeing that the flag was\r\nrun up and politely dipped three times in response to the salutes of\r\nthose strangers; in the smoking room there were always parties of\r\ngentlemen playing euchre, draughts and dominoes, especially dominoes,\r\nthat delightfully harmless game; and down on the main deck, \xe2\x80\x9cfor'rard\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n --for'rard of the chicken-coops and the cattle--we had what was called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chorse billiards.\xe2\x80\x9d  Horse billiards is a fine game.  It affords good,\r\nactive exercise, hilarity, and consuming excitement.  It is a mixture of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chop-scotch\xe2\x80\x9d and shuffleboard played with a crutch.  A large hop-scotch\r\ndiagram is marked out on the deck with chalk, and each compartment\r\nnumbered.  You stand off three or four steps, with some broad wooden\r\ndisks before you on the deck, and these you send forward with a vigorous\r\nthrust of a long crutch.  If a disk stops on a chalk line, it does not\r\ncount anything.  If it stops in division No. 7, it counts 7; in 5, it\r\ncounts 5, and so on.  The game is 100, and four can play at a time.  That\r\ngame would be very simple played on a stationary floor, but with us, to\r\nplay it well required science.  We had to allow for the reeling of the\r\nship to the right or the left.  Very often one made calculations for a\r\nheel to the right and the ship did not go that way.  The consequence was\r\nthat that disk missed the whole hopscotch plan a yard or two, and then\r\nthere was humiliation on one side and laughter on the other.\r\n\r\nWhen it rained the passengers had to stay in the house, of course--or at\r\nleast the cabins--and amuse themselves with games, reading, looking out\r\nof the windows at the very familiar billows, and talking gossip.\r\n\r\nBy 7 o'clock in the evening, dinner was about over; an hour's promenade\r\non the upper deck followed; then the gong sounded and a large majority of\r\nthe party repaired to the after cabin (upper), a handsome saloon fifty or\r\nsixty feet long, for prayers.  The unregenerated called this saloon the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSynagogue.\xe2\x80\x9d  The devotions consisted only of two hymns from the Plymouth\r\nCollection and a short prayer, and seldom occupied more than fifteen\r\nminutes.  The hymns were accompanied by parlor-organ music when the sea\r\nwas smooth enough to allow a performer to sit at the instrument without\r\nbeing lashed to his chair.\r\n\r\nAfter prayers the Synagogue shortly took the semblance of a writing\r\nschool.  The like of that picture was never seen in a ship before.\r\nBehind the long dining tables on either side of the saloon, and scattered\r\nfrom one end to the other of the latter, some twenty or thirty gentlemen\r\nand ladies sat them down under the swaying lamps and for two or three\r\nhours wrote diligently in their journals.  Alas! that journals so\r\nvoluminously begun should come to so lame and impotent a conclusion as\r\nmost of them did!  I doubt if there is a single pilgrim of all that host\r\nbut can show a hundred fair pages of journal concerning the first twenty\r\ndays' voyaging in the __Quaker City__, and I am morally certain that not ten\r\nof the party can show twenty pages of journal for the succeeding twenty\r\nthousand miles of voyaging!  At certain periods it becomes the dearest\r\nambition of a man to keep a faithful record of his performances in a\r\nbook; and he dashes at this work with an enthusiasm that imposes on him\r\nthe notion that keeping a journal is the veriest pastime in the world,\r\nand the pleasantest.  But if he only lives twenty-one days, he will find\r\nout that only those rare natures that are made up of pluck, endurance,\r\ndevotion to duty for duty's sake, and invincible determination may hope\r\nto venture upon so tremendous an enterprise as the keeping of a journal\r\nand not sustain a shameful defeat.\r\n\r\nOne of our favorite youths, Jack, a splendid young fellow with a head\r\nfull of good sense, and a pair of legs that were a wonder to look upon in\r\nthe way of length and straightness and slimness, used to report progress\r\nevery morning in the most glowing and spirited way, and say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I'm coming along bully!\xe2\x80\x9d (he was a little given to slang in his\r\nhappier moods.)  \xe2\x80\x9cI wrote ten pages in my journal last night--and you\r\nknow I wrote nine the night before and twelve the night before that.\r\nWhy, it's only fun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you find to put in it, Jack?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, everything.  Latitude and longitude, noon every day; and how many\r\nmiles we made last twenty-four hours; and all the domino games I beat and\r\nhorse billiards; and whales and sharks and porpoises; and the text of the\r\nsermon Sundays (because that'll tell at home, you know); and the ships we\r\nsaluted and what nation they were; and which way the wind was, and\r\nwhether there was a heavy sea, and what sail we carried, though we don't\r\never carry any, principally, going against a head wind always--wonder\r\nwhat is the reason of that?--and how many lies Moult has told--Oh, every\r\nthing!  I've got everything down.  My father told me to keep that\r\njournal.  Father wouldn't take a thousand dollars for it when I get it\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Jack; it will be worth more than a thousand dollars--when you get it\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you?--no, but do you think it will, though?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it will be worth at least as much as a thousand dollars--when you\r\nget it done.  May be more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I about half think so, myself.  It ain't no slouch of a journal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it shortly became a most lamentable \xe2\x80\x9cslouch of a journal.\xe2\x80\x9d  One night\r\nin Paris, after a hard day's toil in sightseeing, I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I'll go and stroll around the cafes awhile, Jack, and give you a\r\nchance to write up your journal, old fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis countenance lost its fire.  He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no, you needn't mind.  I think I won't run that journal anymore.\r\nIt is awful tedious.  Do you know--I reckon I'm as much as four thousand\r\npages behind hand.  I haven't got any France in it at all.  First I\r\nthought I'd leave France out and start fresh.  But that wouldn't do,\r\nwould it?  The governor would say, 'Hello, here--didn't see anything in\r\nFrance?  That cat wouldn't fight, you know.  First I thought I'd copy\r\nFrance out of the guide-book, like old Badger in the for'rard cabin,\r\nwho's writing a book, but there's more than three hundred pages of it.\r\nOh, I don't think a journal's any use--do you?  They're only a bother,\r\nain't they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a journal that is incomplete isn't of much use, but a journal\r\nproperly kept is worth a thousand dollars--when you've got it done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thousand!--well, I should think so.  I wouldn't finish it for a\r\nmillion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis experience was only the experience of the majority of that\r\nindustrious night school in the cabin.  If you wish to inflict a\r\nheartless and malignant punishment upon a young person, pledge him to\r\nkeep a journal a year.\r\n\r\nA good many expedients were resorted to to keep the excursionists amused\r\nand satisfied.  A club was formed, of all the passengers, which met in\r\nthe writing school after prayers and read aloud about the countries we\r\nwere approaching and discussed the information so obtained.\r\n\r\nSeveral times the photographer of the expedition brought out his\r\ntransparent pictures and gave us a handsome magic-lantern exhibition.\r\nHis views were nearly all of foreign scenes, but there were one or two\r\nhome pictures among them.  He advertised that he would \xe2\x80\x9copen his\r\nperformance in the after cabin at 'two bells' (nine P.M.) and show the\r\npassengers where they shall eventually arrive\xe2\x80\x9d--which was all very well,\r\nbut by a funny accident the first picture that flamed out upon the canvas\r\nwas a view of Greenwood Cemetery!\r\n\r\nOn several starlight nights we danced on the upper deck, under the\r\nawnings, and made something of a ball-room display of brilliancy by\r\nhanging a number of ship's lanterns to the stanchions.  Our music\r\nconsisted of the well-mixed strains of a melodeon which was a little\r\nasthmatic and apt to catch its breath where it ought to come out strong,\r\na clarinet which was a little unreliable on the high keys and rather\r\nmelancholy on the low ones, and a disreputable accordion that had a leak\r\nsomewhere and breathed louder than it squawked--a more elegant term does\r\nnot occur to me just now.  However, the dancing was infinitely worse than\r\nthe music.  When the ship rolled to starboard the whole platoon of\r\ndancers came charging down to starboard with it, and brought up in mass\r\nat the rail; and when it rolled to port they went floundering down to\r\nport with the same unanimity of sentiment.  Waltzers spun around\r\nprecariously for a matter of fifteen seconds and then went scurrying down\r\nto the rail as if they meant to go overboard.  The Virginia reel, as\r\nperformed on board the __Quaker City__, had more genuine reel about it than\r\nany reel I ever saw before, and was as full of interest to the spectator\r\nas it was full of desperate chances and hairbreadth escapes to the\r\nparticipant.  We gave up dancing, finally.\r\n\r\nWe celebrated a lady's birthday anniversary with toasts, speeches, a\r\npoem, and so forth.  We also had a mock trial.  No ship ever went to sea\r\nthat hadn't a mock trial on board.  The purser was accused of stealing an\r\novercoat from stateroom No. 10.  A judge was appointed; also clerks, a\r\ncrier of the court, constables, sheriffs; counsel for the State and for\r\nthe defendant; witnesses were subpoenaed, and a jury empaneled after much\r\nchallenging.  The witnesses were stupid and unreliable and contradictory,\r\nas witnesses always are.  The counsel were eloquent, argumentative, and\r\nvindictively abusive of each other, as was characteristic and proper.\r\nThe case was at last submitted and duly finished by the judge with an\r\nabsurd decision and a ridiculous sentence.\r\n\r\nThe acting of charades was tried on several evenings by the young\r\ngentlemen and ladies, in the cabins, and proved the most distinguished\r\nsuccess of all the amusement experiments.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made to organize a debating club, but it was a failure.\r\nThere was no oratorical talent in the ship.\r\n\r\nWe all enjoyed ourselves--I think I can safely say that, but it was in a\r\nrather quiet way.  We very, very seldom played the piano; we played the\r\nflute and the clarinet together, and made good music, too, what there was\r\nof it, but we always played the same old tune; it was a very pretty tune\r\n--how well I remember it--I wonder when I shall ever get rid of it.  We\r\nnever played either the melodeon or the organ except at devotions--but I\r\nam too fast: young Albert did know part of a tune something about\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Something-Or-Other How Sweet It Is to Know That He's His\r\nWhat's-his-Name\xe2\x80\x9d (I do not remember the exact title of it, but it was\r\nvery plaintive and full of sentiment); Albert played that pretty much\r\nall the time until we contracted with him to restrain himself.  But\r\nnobody ever sang by moonlight on the upper deck, and the congregational\r\nsinging at church and prayers was not of a superior order of\r\narchitecture.  I put up with it as long as I could and then joined in\r\nand tried to improve it, but this encouraged young George to join in\r\ntoo, and that made a failure of it; because George's voice was just\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cturning,\xe2\x80\x9d and when he was singing a dismal sort of bass it was apt to\r\nfly off the handle and startle everybody with a most discordant cackle\r\non the upper notes.  George didn't know the tunes, either, which was\r\nalso a drawback to his performances.  I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, George, don't improvise.  It looks too egotistical.  It will\r\nprovoke remark.  Just stick to 'Coronation,' like the others.  It is a\r\ngood tune--you can't improve it any, just off-hand, in this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I'm not trying to improve it--and I am singing like the others\r\n--just as it is in the notes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he honestly thought he was, too; and so he had no one to blame but\r\nhimself when his voice caught on the center occasionally and gave him the\r\nlockjaw.\r\n\r\nThere were those among the unregenerated who attributed the unceasing\r\nhead-winds to our distressing choir-music.  There were those who said\r\nopenly that it was taking chances enough to have such ghastly music going\r\non, even when it was at its best; and that to exaggerate the crime by\r\nletting George help was simply flying in the face of Providence.  These\r\nsaid that the choir would keep up their lacerating attempts at melody\r\nuntil they would bring down a storm some day that would sink the ship.\r\n\r\nThere were even grumblers at the prayers.  The executive officer said the\r\npilgrims had no charity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere they are, down there every night at eight bells, praying for fair\r\nwinds--when they know as well as I do that this is the only ship going\r\neast this time of the year, but there's a thousand coming west--what's a\r\nfair wind for us is a head wind to them--the Almighty's blowing a fair\r\nwind for a thousand vessels, and this tribe wants him to turn it clear\r\naround so as to accommodate one--and she a steamship at that!  It ain't\r\ngood sense, it ain't good reason, it ain't good Christianity, it ain't\r\ncommon human charity.  Avast with such nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTaking it \xe2\x80\x9cby and large,\xe2\x80\x9d as the sailors say, we had a pleasant ten days'\r\nrun from New York to the Azores islands--not a fast run, for the distance\r\nis only twenty-four hundred miles, but a right pleasant one in the main.\r\nTrue, we had head winds all the time, and several stormy experiences\r\nwhich sent fifty percent of the passengers to bed sick and made the ship\r\nlook dismal and deserted--stormy experiences that all will remember who\r\nweathered them on the tumbling deck and caught the vast sheets of spray\r\nthat every now and then sprang high in air from the weather bow and swept\r\nthe ship like a thunder-shower; but for the most part we had balmy summer\r\nweather and nights that were even finer than the days.  We had the\r\nphenomenon of a full moon located just in the same spot in the heavens at\r\nthe same hour every night.  The reason of this singular conduct on the\r\npart of the moon did not occur to us at first, but it did afterward when\r\nwe reflected that we were gaining about twenty minutes every day because\r\nwe were going east so fast--we gained just about enough every day to keep\r\nalong with the moon.  It was becoming an old moon to the friends we had\r\nleft behind us, but to us Joshuas it stood still in the same place and\r\nremained always the same.\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Blucher, who is from the Far West and is on his first voyage,\r\nwas a good deal worried by the constantly changing \xe2\x80\x9cship time.\xe2\x80\x9d  He was\r\nproud of his new watch at first and used to drag it out promptly when\r\neight bells struck at noon, but he came to look after a while as if he\r\nwere losing confidence in it.  Seven days out from New York he came on\r\ndeck and said with great decision:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis thing's a swindle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's a swindle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this watch.  I bought her out in Illinois--gave $150 for her--and I\r\nthought she was good.  And, by George, she is good onshore, but somehow\r\nshe don't keep up her lick here on the water--gets seasick may be.  She\r\nskips; she runs along regular enough till half-past eleven, and then, all\r\nof a sudden, she lets down.  I've set that old regulator up faster and\r\nfaster, till I've shoved it clear around, but it don't do any good; she\r\njust distances every watch in the ship, and clatters along in a way\r\nthat's astonishing till it is noon, but them eight bells always gets in\r\nabout ten minutes ahead of her anyway.  I don't know what to do with her\r\nnow.  She's doing all she can--she's going her best gait, but it won't\r\nsave her.  Now, don't you know, there ain't a watch in the ship that's\r\nmaking better time than she is, but what does it signify?  When you hear\r\nthem eight bells you'll find her just about ten minutes short of her\r\nscore sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ship was gaining a full hour every three days, and this fellow was\r\ntrying to make his watch go fast enough to keep up to her.  But, as he\r\nhad said, he had pushed the regulator up as far as it would go, and the\r\nwatch was \xe2\x80\x9con its best gait,\xe2\x80\x9d and so nothing was left him but to fold his\r\nhands and see the ship beat the race.  We sent him to the captain, and he\r\nexplained to him the mystery of \xe2\x80\x9cship time\xe2\x80\x9d and set his troubled mind at\r\nrest.  This young man asked a great many questions about seasickness\r\nbefore we left, and wanted to know what its characteristics were and how\r\nhe was to tell when he had it.  He found out.\r\n\r\nWe saw the usual sharks, blackfish, porpoises, &c., of course, and by and\r\nby large schools of Portuguese men-of-war were added to the regular list\r\nof sea wonders.  Some of them were white and some of a brilliant carmine\r\ncolor.  The nautilus is nothing but a transparent web of jelly that\r\nspreads itself to catch the wind, and has fleshy-looking strings a foot\r\nor two long dangling from it to keep it steady in the water.  It is an\r\naccomplished sailor and has good sailor judgment.  It reefs its sail when\r\na storm threatens or the wind blows pretty hard, and furls it entirely\r\nand goes down when a gale blows.  Ordinarily it keeps its sail wet and in\r\ngood sailing order by turning over and dipping it in the water for a\r\nmoment.  Seamen say the nautilus is only found in these waters between\r\nthe 35th and 45th parallels of latitude.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock on the morning of the twenty-first of June, we were\r\nawakened and notified that the Azores islands were in sight.  I said I\r\ndid not take any interest in islands at three o'clock in the morning.\r\nBut another persecutor came, and then another and another, and finally\r\nbelieving that the general enthusiasm would permit no one to slumber in\r\npeace, I got up and went sleepily on deck.  It was five and a half\r\no'clock now, and a raw, blustering morning.  The passengers were huddled\r\nabout the smoke-stacks and fortified behind ventilators, and all were\r\nwrapped in wintry costumes and looking sleepy and unhappy in the pitiless\r\ngale and the drenching spray.\r\n\r\nThe island in sight was Flores.  It seemed only a mountain of mud\r\nstanding up out of the dull mists of the sea.  But as we bore down upon\r\nit the sun came out and made it a beautiful picture--a mass of green\r\nfarms and meadows that swelled up to a height of fifteen hundred feet and\r\nmingled its upper outlines with the clouds.  It was ribbed with sharp,\r\nsteep ridges and cloven with narrow canyons, and here and there on the\r\nheights, rocky upheavals shaped themselves into mimic battlements and\r\ncastles; and out of rifted clouds came broad shafts of sunlight, that\r\npainted summit, and slope and glen, with bands of fire, and left belts of\r\nsomber shade between.  It was the aurora borealis of the frozen pole\r\nexiled to a summer land!\r\n\r\nWe skirted around two-thirds of the island, four miles from shore, and\r\nall the opera glasses in the ship were called into requisition to settle\r\ndisputes as to whether mossy spots on the uplands were groves of trees or\r\ngroves of weeds, or whether the white villages down by the sea were\r\nreally villages or only the clustering tombstones of cemeteries.  Finally\r\nwe stood to sea and bore away for San Miguel, and Flores shortly became a\r\ndome of mud again and sank down among the mists, and disappeared.  But to\r\nmany a seasick passenger it was good to see the green hills again, and\r\nall were more cheerful after this episode than anybody could have\r\nexpected them to be, considering how sinfully early they had gotten up.\r\n\r\nBut we had to change our purpose about San Miguel, for a storm came up\r\nabout noon that so tossed and pitched the vessel that common sense\r\ndictated a run for shelter.  Therefore we steered for the nearest island\r\nof the group--Fayal (the people there pronounce it Fy-all, and put the\r\naccent on the first syllable).  We anchored in the open roadstead of\r\nHorta, half a mile from the shore.  The town has eight thousand to ten\r\nthousand inhabitants.  Its snow-white houses nestle cosily in a sea of\r\nfresh green vegetation, and no village could look prettier or more\r\nattractive.  It sits in the lap of an amphitheater of hills which are\r\nthree hundred to seven hundred feet high, and carefully cultivated clear\r\nto their summits--not a foot of soil left idle.  Every farm and every\r\nacre is cut up into little square inclosures by stone walls, whose duty\r\nit is to protect the growing products from the destructive gales that\r\nblow there.  These hundreds of green squares, marked by their black lava\r\nwalls, make the hills look like vast checkerboards.\r\n\r\nThe islands belong to Portugal, and everything in Fayal has Portuguese\r\ncharacteristics about it.  But more of that anon.  A swarm of swarthy,\r\nnoisy, lying, shoulder-shrugging, gesticulating Portuguese boatmen, with\r\nbrass rings in their ears and fraud in their hearts, climbed the ship's\r\nsides, and various parties of us contracted with them to take us ashore\r\nat so much a head, silver coin of any country.  We landed under the walls\r\nof a little fort, armed with batteries of twelve-and-thirty-two-pounders,\r\nwhich Horta considered a most formidable institution, but if we were ever\r\nto get after it with one of our turreted monitors, they would have to\r\nmove it out in the country if they wanted it where they could go and find\r\nit again when they needed it.  The group on the pier was a rusty one--men\r\nand women, and boys and girls, all ragged and barefoot, uncombed and\r\nunclean, and by instinct, education, and profession beggars.  They\r\ntrooped after us, and never more while we tarried in Fayal did we get rid\r\nof them.  We walked up the middle of the principal street, and these\r\nvermin surrounded us on all sides and glared upon us; and every moment\r\nexcited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back,\r\njust as village boys do when they accompany the elephant on his\r\nadvertising trip from street to street.  It was very flattering to me to\r\nbe part of the material for such a sensation.  Here and there in the\r\ndoorways we saw women with fashionable Portuguese hoods on.  This hood is\r\nof thick blue cloth, attached to a cloak of the same stuff, and is a\r\nmarvel of ugliness.  It stands up high and spreads far abroad, and is\r\nunfathomably deep.  It fits like a circus tent, and a woman's head is\r\nhidden away in it like the man's who prompts the singers from his tin\r\nshed in the stage of an opera.  There is no particle of trimming about\r\nthis monstrous capote, as they call it--it is just a plain, ugly\r\ndead-blue mass of sail, and a woman can't go within eight points of the\r\nwind with one of them on; she has to go before the wind or not at all.\r\nThe general style of the capote is the same in all the islands, and will\r\nremain so for the next ten thousand years, but each island shapes its\r\ncapotes just enough differently from the others to enable an observer to\r\ntell at a glance what particular island a lady hails from.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese pennies, or reis (pronounced rays), are prodigious.  It\r\ntakes one thousand reis to make a dollar, and all financial estimates are\r\nmade in reis.  We did not know this until after we had found it out\r\nthrough Blucher.  Blucher said he was so happy and so grateful to be on\r\nsolid land once more that he wanted to give a feast--said he had heard it\r\nwas a cheap land, and he was bound to have a grand banquet.  He invited\r\nnine of us, and we ate an excellent dinner at the principal hotel.  In\r\nthe midst of the jollity produced by good cigars, good wine, and passable\r\nanecdotes, the landlord presented his bill.  Blucher glanced at it and\r\nhis countenance fell.  He took another look to assure himself that his\r\nsenses had not deceived him and then read the items aloud, in a faltering\r\nvoice, while the roses in his cheeks turned to ashes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Ten dinners, at 600 reis, 6,000 reis!'  Ruin and desolation!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Twenty-five cigars, at 100 reis, 2,500 reis!'  Oh, my sainted mother!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Eleven bottles of wine, at 1,200 reis, 13,200 reis!'  Be with us all!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'TOTAL, TWENTY-ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED REIS!'  The suffering Moses!\r\nThere ain't money enough in the ship to pay that bill!  Go--leave me to\r\nmy misery, boys, I am a ruined community.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI think it was the blankest-looking party I ever saw.  Nobody could say a\r\nword.  It was as if every soul had been stricken dumb.  Wine glasses\r\ndescended slowly to the table, their contents untasted.  Cigars dropped\r\nunnoticed from nerveless fingers.  Each man sought his neighbor's eye,\r\nbut found in it no ray of hope, no encouragement.  At last the fearful\r\nsilence was broken.  The shadow of a desperate resolve settled upon\r\nBlucher's countenance like a cloud, and he rose up and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLandlord, this is a low, mean swindle, and I'll never, never stand it.\r\nHere's a hundred and fifty dollars, Sir, and it's all you'll get--I'll\r\nswim in blood before I'll pay a cent more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur spirits rose and the landlord's fell--at least we thought so; he was\r\nconfused, at any rate, notwithstanding he had not understood a word that\r\nhad been said.  He glanced from the little pile of gold pieces to Blucher\r\nseveral times and then went out.  He must have visited an American, for\r\nwhen he returned, he brought back his bill translated into a language\r\nthat a Christian could understand--thus:\r\n\r\n10 dinners, 6,000 reis, or .  .  .$6.00\r\n\r\n25 cigars, 2,500 reis, or .  .  .  2.50\r\n\r\n11 bottles wine, 13,200 reis, or  13.20\r\n\r\nTotal 21,700 reis, or .  .  .  . $21.70\r\n\r\nHappiness reigned once more in Blucher's dinner party.  More refreshments\r\nwere ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nI think the Azores must be very little known in America.  Out of our\r\nwhole ship's company there was not a solitary individual who knew\r\nanything whatever about them.  Some of the party, well read concerning\r\nmost other lands, had no other information about the Azores than that\r\nthey were a group of nine or ten small islands far out in the Atlantic,\r\nsomething more than halfway between New York and Gibraltar.  That was\r\nall.  These considerations move me to put in a paragraph of dry facts\r\njust here.\r\n\r\nThe community is eminently Portuguese--that is to say, it is slow, poor,\r\nshiftless, sleepy, and lazy.  There is a civil governor, appointed by the\r\nKing of Portugal, and also a military governor, who can assume supreme\r\ncontrol and suspend the civil government at his pleasure.  The islands\r\ncontain a population of about 200,000, almost entirely Portuguese.\r\nEverything is staid and settled, for the country was one hundred years\r\nold when Columbus discovered America.  The principal crop is corn, and\r\nthey raise it and grind it just as their great-great-great-grandfathers\r\ndid.  They plow with a board slightly shod with iron; their trifling\r\nlittle harrows are drawn by men and women; small windmills grind the\r\ncorn, ten bushels a day, and there is one assistant superintendent to\r\nfeed the mill and a general superintendent to stand by and keep him from\r\ngoing to sleep.  When the wind changes they hitch on some donkeys and\r\nactually turn the whole upper half of the mill around until the sails are\r\nin proper position, instead of fixing the concern so that the sails could\r\nbe moved instead of the mill.  Oxen tread the wheat from the ear, after\r\nthe fashion prevalent in the time of Methuselah.  There is not a\r\nwheelbarrow in the land--they carry everything on their heads, or on\r\ndonkeys, or in a wicker-bodied cart, whose wheels are solid blocks of\r\nwood and whose axles turn with the wheel.  There is not a modern plow in\r\nthe islands or a threshing machine.  All attempts to introduce them have\r\nfailed.  The good Catholic Portuguese crossed himself and prayed God to\r\nshield him from all blasphemous desire to know more than his father did\r\nbefore him.  The climate is mild; they never have snow or ice, and I saw\r\nno chimneys in the town.  The donkeys and the men, women, and children of\r\na family all eat and sleep in the same room, and are unclean, are ravaged\r\nby vermin, and are truly happy.  The people lie, and cheat the stranger,\r\nand are desperately ignorant, and have hardly any reverence for their\r\ndead.  The latter trait shows how little better they are than the donkeys\r\nthey eat and sleep with.  The only well-dressed Portuguese in the camp\r\nare the half a dozen well-to-do families, the Jesuit priests, and the\r\nsoldiers of the little garrison.  The wages of a laborer are twenty to\r\ntwenty-four cents a day, and those of a good mechanic about twice as\r\nmuch.  They count it in reis at a thousand to the dollar, and this makes\r\nthem rich and contented.  Fine grapes used to grow in the islands, and an\r\nexcellent wine was made and exported.  But a disease killed all the vines\r\nfifteen years ago, and since that time no wine has been made.  The\r\nislands being wholly of volcanic origin, the soil is necessarily very\r\nrich.  Nearly every foot of ground is under cultivation, and two or three\r\ncrops a year of each article are produced, but nothing is exported save a\r\nfew oranges--chiefly to England.  Nobody comes here, and nobody goes\r\naway.  News is a thing unknown in Fayal.  A thirst for it is a passion\r\nequally unknown.  A Portuguese of average intelligence inquired if our\r\ncivil war was over.  Because, he said, somebody had told him it was--or\r\nat least it ran in his mind that somebody had told him something like\r\nthat!  And when a passenger gave an officer of the garrison copies of the\r\nTribune, the Herald, and Times, he was surprised to find later news in\r\nthem from Lisbon than he had just received by the little monthly steamer.\r\nHe was told that it came by cable.  He said he knew they had tried to lay\r\na cable ten years ago, but it had been in his mind somehow that they\r\nhadn't succeeded!\r\n\r\nIt is in communities like this that Jesuit humbuggery flourishes.  We\r\nvisited a Jesuit cathedral nearly two hundred years old and found in it a\r\npiece of the veritable cross upon which our Saviour was crucified.  It\r\nwas polished and hard, and in as excellent a state of preservation as if\r\nthe dread tragedy on Calvary had occurred yesterday instead of eighteen\r\ncenturies ago.  But these confiding people believe in that piece of wood\r\nunhesitatingly.\r\n\r\nIn a chapel of the cathedral is an altar with facings of solid silver--at\r\nleast they call it so, and I think myself it would go a couple of hundred\r\nto the ton (to speak after the fashion of the silver miners)--and before\r\nit is kept forever burning a small lamp.  A devout lady who died, left\r\nmoney and contracted for unlimited masses for the repose of her soul, and\r\nalso stipulated that this lamp should be kept lighted always, day and\r\nnight.  She did all this before she died, you understand.  It is a very\r\nsmall lamp and a very dim one, and it could not work her much damage, I\r\nthink, if it went out altogether.\r\n\r\nThe great altar of the cathedral and also three or four minor ones are a\r\nperfect mass of gilt gimcracks and gingerbread.  And they have a swarm of\r\nrusty, dusty, battered apostles standing around the filagree work, some\r\non one leg and some with one eye out but a gamey look in the other, and\r\nsome with two or three fingers gone, and some with not enough nose left\r\nto blow--all of them crippled and discouraged, and fitter subjects for\r\nthe hospital than the cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the chancel are of porcelain, all pictured over with figures\r\nof almost life size, very elegantly wrought and dressed in the fanciful\r\ncostumes of two centuries ago.  The design was a history of something or\r\nsomebody, but none of us were learned enough to read the story.  The old\r\nfather, reposing under a stone close by, dated 1686, might have told us\r\nif he could have risen.  But he didn't.\r\n\r\nAs we came down through the town we encountered a squad of little donkeys\r\nready saddled for use.  The saddles were peculiar, to say the least.\r\nThey consisted of a sort of saw-buck with a small mattress on it, and\r\nthis furniture covered about half the donkey.  There were no stirrups,\r\nbut really such supports were not needed--to use such a saddle was the\r\nnext thing to riding a dinner table--there was ample support clear out to\r\none's knee joints.  A pack of ragged Portuguese muleteers crowded around\r\nus, offering their beasts at half a dollar an hour--more rascality to the\r\nstranger, for the market price is sixteen cents.  Half a dozen of us\r\nmounted the ungainly affairs and submitted to the indignity of making a\r\nridiculous spectacle of ourselves through the principal streets of a town\r\nof 10,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nWe started.  It was not a trot, a gallop, or a canter, but a stampede,\r\nand made up of all possible or conceivable gaits.  No spurs were\r\nnecessary.  There was a muleteer to every donkey and a dozen volunteers\r\nbeside, and they banged the donkeys with their goad sticks, and pricked\r\nthem with their spikes, and shouted something that sounded like\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSekki-yah!\xe2\x80\x9d and kept up a din and a racket that was worse than Bedlam\r\nitself. These rascals were all on foot, but no matter, they were always\r\nup to time--they can outrun and outlast a donkey.  Altogether, ours was\r\na lively and a picturesque procession, and drew crowded audiences to the\r\nbalconies wherever we went.\r\n\r\nBlucher could do nothing at all with his donkey.  The beast scampered\r\nzigzag across the road and the others ran into him; he scraped Blucher\r\nagainst carts and the corners of houses; the road was fenced in with high\r\nstone walls, and the donkey gave him a polishing first on one side and\r\nthen on the other, but never once took the middle; he finally came to the\r\nhouse he was born in and darted into the parlor, scraping Blucher off at\r\nthe doorway.  After remounting, Blucher said to the muleteer, \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\r\nthat's enough, you know; you go slow hereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the fellow knew no English and did not understand, so he simply said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSekki-yah!\xe2\x80\x9d and the donkey was off again like a shot.  He turned a corner\r\nsuddenly, and Blucher went over his head.  And, to speak truly, every\r\nmule stumbled over the two, and the whole cavalcade was piled up in a\r\nheap.  No harm done.  A fall from one of those donkeys is of little more\r\nconsequence than rolling off a sofa.  The donkeys all stood still after\r\nthe catastrophe and waited for their dismembered saddles to be patched up\r\nand put on by the noisy muleteers.  Blucher was pretty angry and wanted\r\nto swear, but every time he opened his mouth his animal did so also and\r\nlet off a series of brays that drowned all other sounds.\r\n\r\nIt was fun, scurrying around the breezy hills and through the beautiful\r\ncanyons.  There was that rare thing, novelty, about it; it was a fresh,\r\nnew, exhilarating sensation, this donkey riding, and worth a hundred worn\r\nand threadbare home pleasures.\r\n\r\nThe roads were a wonder, and well they might be.  Here was an island with\r\nonly a handful of people in it--25,000--and yet such fine roads do not\r\nexist in the United States outside of Central Park.  Everywhere you go,\r\nin any direction, you find either a hard, smooth, level thoroughfare,\r\njust sprinkled with black lava sand, and bordered with little gutters\r\nneatly paved with small smooth pebbles, or compactly paved ones like\r\nBroadway.  They talk much of the Russ pavement in New York, and call it a\r\nnew invention--yet here they have been using it in this remote little\r\nisle of the sea for two hundred years!  Every street in Horta is\r\nhandsomely paved with the heavy Russ blocks, and the surface is neat and\r\ntrue as a floor--not marred by holes like Broadway.  And every road is\r\nfenced in by tall, solid lava walls, which will last a thousand years in\r\nthis land where frost is unknown.  They are very thick, and are often\r\nplastered and whitewashed and capped with projecting slabs of cut stone.\r\nTrees from gardens above hang their swaying tendrils down, and contrast\r\ntheir bright green with the whitewash or the black lava of the walls and\r\nmake them beautiful.  The trees and vines stretch across these narrow\r\nroadways sometimes and so shut out the sun that you seem to be riding\r\nthrough a tunnel.  The pavements, the roads, and the bridges are all\r\ngovernment work.\r\n\r\nThe bridges are of a single span--a single arch--of cut stone, without a\r\nsupport, and paved on top with flags of lava and ornamental pebblework.\r\nEverywhere are walls, walls, walls, and all of them tasteful and\r\nhandsome--and eternally substantial; and everywhere are those marvelous\r\npavements, so neat, so smooth, and so indestructible.  And if ever roads\r\nand streets and the outsides of houses were perfectly free from any sign\r\nor semblance of dirt, or dust, or mud, or uncleanliness of any kind, it\r\nis Horta, it is Fayal.  The lower classes of the people, in their persons\r\nand their domiciles, are not clean--but there it stops--the town and the\r\nisland are miracles of cleanliness.\r\n\r\nWe arrived home again finally, after a ten-mile excursion, and the\r\nirrepressible muleteers scampered at our heels through the main street,\r\ngoading the donkeys, shouting the everlasting \xe2\x80\x9cSekki-yah,\xe2\x80\x9d and singing\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn Brown's Body\xe2\x80\x9d in ruinous English.\r\n\r\nWhen we were dismounted and it came to settling, the shouting and jawing\r\nand swearing and quarreling among the muleteers and with us was nearly\r\ndeafening.  One fellow would demand a dollar an hour for the use of his\r\ndonkey; another claimed half a dollar for pricking him up, another a\r\nquarter for helping in that service, and about fourteen guides presented\r\nbills for showing us the way through the town and its environs; and every\r\nvagrant of them was more vociferous, and more vehement and more frantic\r\nin gesture than his neighbor.  We paid one guide and paid for one\r\nmuleteer to each donkey.\r\n\r\nThe mountains on some of the islands are very high.  We sailed along the\r\nshore of the island of Pico, under a stately green pyramid that rose up\r\nwith one unbroken sweep from our very feet to an altitude of 7,613 feet,\r\nand thrust its summit above the white clouds like an island adrift in a\r\nfog!\r\n\r\nWe got plenty of fresh oranges, lemons, figs, apricots, etc., in these\r\nAzores, of course.  But I will desist.  I am not here to write Patent\r\nOffice reports.\r\n\r\nWe are on our way to Gibraltar, and shall reach there five or six days\r\nout from the Azores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nA week of buffeting a tempestuous and relentless sea; a week of\r\nseasickness and deserted cabins; of lonely quarterdecks drenched with\r\nspray--spray so ambitious that it even coated the smokestacks thick with\r\na white crust of salt to their very tops; a week of shivering in the\r\nshelter of the lifeboats and deckhouses by day and blowing suffocating\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cclouds\xe2\x80\x9d and boisterously performing at dominoes in the smoking room at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAnd the last night of the seven was the stormiest of all.  There was no\r\nthunder, no noise but the pounding bows of the ship, the keen whistling\r\nof the gale through the cordage, and the rush of the seething waters.\r\nBut the vessel climbed aloft as if she would climb to heaven--then paused\r\nan instant that seemed a century and plunged headlong down again, as from\r\na precipice.  The sheeted sprays drenched the decks like rain.  The\r\nblackness of darkness was everywhere.  At long intervals a flash of\r\nlightning clove it with a quivering line of fire that revealed a heaving\r\nworld of water where was nothing before, kindled the dusky cordage to\r\nglittering silver, and lit up the faces of the men with a ghastly luster!\r\n\r\nFear drove many on deck that were used to avoiding the night winds and\r\nthe spray.  Some thought the vessel could not live through the night, and\r\nit seemed less dreadful to stand out in the midst of the wild tempest and\r\nsee the peril that threatened than to be shut up in the sepulchral\r\ncabins, under the dim lamps, and imagine the horrors that were abroad on\r\nthe ocean.  And once out--once where they could see the ship struggling\r\nin the strong grasp of the storm--once where they could hear the shriek\r\nof the winds and face the driving spray and look out upon the majestic\r\npicture the lightnings disclosed, they were prisoners to a fierce\r\nfascination they could not resist, and so remained.  It was a wild night\r\n--and a very, very long one.\r\n\r\nEverybody was sent scampering to the deck at seven o'clock this lovely\r\nmorning of the thirtieth of June with the glad news that land was in\r\nsight!  It was a rare thing and a joyful, to see all the ship's family\r\nabroad once more, albeit the happiness that sat upon every countenance\r\ncould only partly conceal the ravages which that long siege of storms had\r\nwrought there.  But dull eyes soon sparkled with pleasure, pallid cheeks\r\nflushed again, and frames weakened by sickness gathered new life from the\r\nquickening influences of the bright, fresh morning.  Yea, and from a\r\nstill more potent influence: the worn castaways were to see the blessed\r\nland again!--and to see it was to bring back that motherland that was in\r\nall their thoughts.\r\n\r\nWithin the hour we were fairly within the Straits of Gibraltar, the tall\r\nyellow-splotched hills of Africa on our right, with their bases veiled in\r\na blue haze and their summits swathed in clouds--the same being according\r\nto Scripture, which says that \xe2\x80\x9cclouds and darkness are over the land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The words were spoken of this particular portion of Africa, I believe.\r\nOn our left were the granite-ribbed domes of old Spain.  The strait is\r\nonly thirteen miles wide in its narrowest part.\r\n\r\nAt short intervals along the Spanish shore were quaint-looking old stone\r\ntowers--Moorish, we thought--but learned better afterwards.  In former\r\ntimes the Morocco rascals used to coast along the Spanish Main in their\r\nboats till a safe opportunity seemed to present itself, and then dart in\r\nand capture a Spanish village and carry off all the pretty women they\r\ncould find.  It was a pleasant business, and was very popular.  The\r\nSpaniards built these watchtowers on the hills to enable them to keep a\r\nsharper lookout on the Moroccan speculators.\r\n\r\nThe picture on the other hand was very beautiful to eyes weary of the\r\nchangeless sea, and by and by the ship's company grew wonderfully\r\ncheerful.  But while we stood admiring the cloud-capped peaks and the\r\nlowlands robed in misty gloom a finer picture burst upon us and chained\r\nevery eye like a magnet--a stately ship, with canvas piled on canvas till\r\nshe was one towering mass of bellying sail!  She came speeding over the\r\nsea like a great bird.  Africa and Spain were forgotten.  All homage was\r\nfor the beautiful stranger.  While everybody gazed she swept superbly by\r\nand flung the Stars and Stripes to the breeze!  Quicker than thought,\r\nhats and handkerchiefs flashed in the air, and a cheer went up!  She was\r\nbeautiful before--she was radiant now.  Many a one on our decks knew then\r\nfor the first time how tame a sight his country's flag is at home\r\ncompared to what it is in a foreign land.  To see it is to see a vision\r\nof home itself and all its idols, and feel a thrill that would stir a\r\nvery river of sluggish blood!\r\n\r\nWe were approaching the famed Pillars of Hercules, and already the\r\nAfrican one, \xe2\x80\x9cApe's Hill,\xe2\x80\x9d a grand old mountain with summit streaked with\r\ngranite ledges, was in sight.  The other, the great Rock of Gibraltar,\r\nwas yet to come.  The ancients considered the Pillars of Hercules the\r\nhead of navigation and the end of the world.  The information the\r\nancients didn't have was very voluminous.  Even the prophets wrote book\r\nafter book and epistle after epistle, yet never once hinted at the\r\nexistence of a great continent on our side of the water; yet they must\r\nhave known it was there, I should think.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments a lonely and enormous mass of rock, standing seemingly\r\nin the center of the wide strait and apparently washed on all sides by\r\nthe sea, swung magnificently into view, and we needed no tedious traveled\r\nparrot to tell us it was Gibraltar.  There could not be two rocks like\r\nthat in one kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Rock of Gibraltar is about a mile and a half long, I should say, by\r\n1,400 to 1,500 feet high, and a quarter of a mile wide at its base.  One\r\nside and one end of it come about as straight up out of the sea as the\r\nside of a house, the other end is irregular and the other side is a steep\r\nslant which an army would find very difficult to climb.  At the foot of\r\nthis slant is the walled town of Gibraltar--or rather the town occupies\r\npart of the slant.  Everywhere--on hillside, in the precipice, by the\r\nsea, on the heights--everywhere you choose to look, Gibraltar is clad\r\nwith masonry and bristling with guns.  It makes a striking and lively\r\npicture from whatsoever point you contemplate it.  It is pushed out into\r\nthe sea on the end of a flat, narrow strip of land, and is suggestive of\r\na \xe2\x80\x9cgob\xe2\x80\x9d of mud on the end of a shingle.  A few hundred yards of this flat\r\nground at its base belongs to the English, and then, extending across the\r\nstrip from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, a distance of a quarter of\r\na mile, comes the \xe2\x80\x9cNeutral Ground,\xe2\x80\x9d a space two or three hundred yards\r\nwide, which is free to both parties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going through Spain to Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d  That question was bandied about\r\nthe ship day and night from Fayal to Gibraltar, and I thought I never\r\ncould get so tired of hearing any one combination of words again or more\r\ntired of answering, \xe2\x80\x9cI don't know.\xe2\x80\x9d  At the last moment six or seven had\r\nsufficient decision of character to make up their minds to go, and did\r\ngo, and I felt a sense of relief at once--it was forever too late now and\r\nI could make up my mind at my leisure not to go.  I must have a\r\nprodigious quantity of mind; it takes me as much as a week sometimes to\r\nmake it up.\r\n\r\nBut behold how annoyances repeat themselves.  We had no sooner gotten rid\r\nof the Spain distress than the Gibraltar guides started another--a\r\ntiresome repetition of a legend that had nothing very astonishing about\r\nit, even in the first place: \xe2\x80\x9cThat high hill yonder is called the Queen's\r\nChair; it is because one of the queens of Spain placed her chair there\r\nwhen the French and Spanish troops were besieging Gibraltar, and said she\r\nwould never move from the spot till the English flag was lowered from the\r\nfortresses.  If the English hadn't been gallant enough to lower the flag\r\nfor a few hours one day, she'd have had to break her oath or die up\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe rode on asses and mules up the steep, narrow streets and entered the\r\nsubterranean galleries the English have blasted out in the rock.  These\r\ngalleries are like spacious railway tunnels, and at short intervals in\r\nthem great guns frown out upon sea and town through portholes five or six\r\nhundred feet above the ocean.  There is a mile or so of this subterranean\r\nwork, and it must have cost a vast deal of money and labor.  The gallery\r\nguns command the peninsula and the harbors of both oceans, but they might\r\nas well not be there, I should think, for an army could hardly climb the\r\nperpendicular wall of the rock anyhow.  Those lofty portholes afford\r\nsuperb views of the sea, though.  At one place, where a jutting crag was\r\nhollowed out into a great chamber whose furniture was huge cannon and\r\nwhose windows were portholes, a glimpse was caught of a hill not far\r\naway, and a soldier said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat high hill yonder is called the Queen's Chair; it is because a queen\r\nof Spain placed her chair there once when the French and Spanish troops\r\nwere besieging Gibraltar, and said she would never move from the spot\r\ntill the English flag was lowered from the fortresses.  If the English\r\nhadn't been gallant enough to lower the flag for a few hours one day,\r\nshe'd have had to break her oath or die up there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the topmost pinnacle of Gibraltar we halted a good while, and no doubt\r\nthe mules were tired.  They had a right to be.  The military road was\r\ngood, but rather steep, and there was a good deal of it.  The view from\r\nthe narrow ledge was magnificent; from it vessels seeming like the\r\ntiniest little toy boats were turned into noble ships by the telescopes,\r\nand other vessels that were fifty miles away and even sixty, they said,\r\nand invisible to the naked eye, could be clearly distinguished through\r\nthose same telescopes.  Below, on one side, we looked down upon an\r\nendless mass of batteries and on the other straight down to the sea.\r\n\r\nWhile I was resting ever so comfortably on a rampart, and cooling my\r\nbaking head in the delicious breeze, an officious guide belonging to\r\nanother party came up and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSenor, that high hill yonder is called the Queen's Chair--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, I am a helpless orphan in a foreign land.  Have pity on me.  Don't\r\n--now don't inflict that most in-FERNAL old legend on me anymore today!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere--I had used strong language after promising I would never do so\r\nagain; but the provocation was more than human nature could bear.  If you\r\nhad been bored so, when you had the noble panorama of Spain and Africa\r\nand the blue Mediterranean spread abroad at your feet, and wanted to gaze\r\nand enjoy and surfeit yourself in its beauty in silence, you might have\r\neven burst into stronger language than I did.\r\n\r\nGibraltar has stood several protracted sieges, one of them of nearly four\r\nyears' duration (it failed), and the English only captured it by\r\nstratagem.  The wonder is that anybody should ever dream of trying so\r\nimpossible a project as the taking it by assault--and yet it has been\r\ntried more than once.\r\n\r\nThe Moors held the place twelve hundred years ago, and a staunch old\r\ncastle of theirs of that date still frowns from the middle of the town,\r\nwith moss-grown battlements and sides well scarred by shots fired in\r\nbattles and sieges that are forgotten now.  A secret chamber in the rock\r\nbehind it was discovered some time ago, which contained a sword of\r\nexquisite workmanship, and some quaint old armor of a fashion that\r\nantiquaries are not acquainted with, though it is supposed to be Roman.\r\nRoman armor and Roman relics of various kinds have been found in a cave\r\nin the sea extremity of Gibraltar; history says Rome held this part of\r\nthe country about the Christian era, and these things seem to confirm the\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nIn that cave also are found human bones, crusted with a very thick, stony\r\ncoating, and wise men have ventured to say that those men not only lived\r\nbefore the flood, but as much as ten thousand years before it.  It may be\r\ntrue--it looks reasonable enough--but as long as those parties can't vote\r\nanymore, the matter can be of no great public interest.  In this cave\r\nlikewise are found skeletons and fossils of animals that exist in every\r\npart of Africa, yet within memory and tradition have never existed in any\r\nportion of Spain save this lone peak of Gibraltar!  So the theory is that\r\nthe channel between Gibraltar and Africa was once dry land, and that the\r\nlow, neutral neck between Gibraltar and the Spanish hills behind it was\r\nonce ocean, and of course that these African animals, being over at\r\nGibraltar (after rock, perhaps--there is plenty there), got closed out\r\nwhen the great change occurred.  The hills in Africa, across the channel,\r\nare full of apes, and there are now and always have been apes on the rock\r\nof Gibraltar--but not elsewhere in Spain!  The subject is an interesting\r\none.\r\n\r\nThere is an English garrison at Gibraltar of 6,000 or 7,000 men, and so\r\nuniforms of flaming red are plenty; and red and blue, and undress\r\ncostumes of snowy white, and also the queer uniform of the bare-kneed\r\nHighlander; and one sees soft-eyed Spanish girls from San Roque, and\r\nveiled Moorish beauties (I suppose they are beauties) from Tarifa, and\r\nturbaned, sashed, and trousered Moorish merchants from Fez, and\r\nlong-robed, bare-legged, ragged Muhammadan vagabonds from Tetuan and\r\nTangier, some brown, some yellow and some as black as virgin ink--and\r\nJews from all around, in gabardine, skullcap, and slippers, just as they\r\nare in pictures and theaters, and just as they were three thousand years\r\nago, no doubt.  You can easily understand that a tribe (somehow our\r\npilgrims suggest that expression, because they march in a straggling\r\nprocession through these foreign places with such an Indian-like air of\r\ncomplacency and independence about them) like ours, made up from fifteen\r\nor sixteen states of the Union, found enough to stare at in this\r\nshifting panorama of fashion today.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of our pilgrims reminds me that we have one or two people among\r\nus who are sometimes an annoyance.  However, I do not count the Oracle in\r\nthat list.  I will explain that the Oracle is an innocent old ass who\r\neats for four and looks wiser than the whole Academy of France would have\r\nany right to look, and never uses a one-syllable word when he can think\r\nof a longer one, and never by any possible chance knows the meaning of\r\nany long word he uses or ever gets it in the right place; yet he will\r\nserenely venture an opinion on the most abstruse subject and back it up\r\ncomplacently with quotations from authors who never existed, and finally\r\nwhen cornered will slide to the other side of the question, say he has\r\nbeen there all the time, and come back at you with your own spoken\r\narguments, only with the big words all tangled, and play them in your\r\nvery teeth as original with himself.  He reads a chapter in the\r\nguidebooks, mixes the facts all up, with his bad memory, and then goes\r\noff to inflict the whole mess on somebody as wisdom which has been\r\nfestering in his brain for years and which he gathered in college from\r\nerudite authors who are dead now and out of print.  This morning at\r\nbreakfast he pointed out of the window and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see that there hill out there on that African coast?  It's one of\r\nthem Pillows of Herkewls, I should say--and there's the ultimate one\r\nalongside of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ultimate one--that is a good word--but the pillars are not both on\r\nthe same side of the strait.\xe2\x80\x9d  (I saw he had been deceived by a\r\ncarelessly written sentence in the guidebook.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it ain't for you to say, nor for me.  Some authors states it that\r\nway, and some states it different.  Old Gibbons don't say nothing about\r\nit--just shirks it complete--Gibbons always done that when he got stuck\r\n--but there is Rolampton, what does he say?  Why, he says that they was\r\nboth on the same side, and Trinculian, and Sobaster, and Syraccus, and\r\nLangomarganbl----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that will do--that's enough.  If you have got your hand in for\r\ninventing authors and testimony, I have nothing more to say--let them be\r\non the same side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe don't mind the Oracle.  We rather like him.  We can tolerate the\r\nOracle very easily, but we have a poet and a good-natured enterprising\r\nidiot on board, and they do distress the company.  The one gives copies\r\nof his verses to consuls, commanders, hotel keepers, Arabs, Dutch--to\r\nanybody, in fact, who will submit to a grievous infliction most kindly\r\nmeant.  His poetry is all very well on shipboard, notwithstanding when he\r\nwrote an \xe2\x80\x9cOde to the Ocean in a Storm\xe2\x80\x9d in one half hour, and an\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApostrophe to the Rooster in the Waist of the Ship\xe2\x80\x9d in the next, the\r\ntransition was considered to be rather abrupt; but when he sends an\r\ninvoice of rhymes to the Governor of Fayal and another to the commander\r\nin chief and other dignitaries in Gibraltar with the compliments of the\r\nLaureate of the Ship, it is not popular with the passengers.\r\n\r\nThe other personage I have mentioned is young and green, and not bright,\r\nnot learned, and not wise.  He will be, though, someday if he recollects\r\nthe answers to all his questions.  He is known about the ship as the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInterrogation Point,\xe2\x80\x9d and this by constant use has become shortened to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInterrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d  He has distinguished himself twice already.  In Fayal\r\nthey pointed out a hill and told him it was 800 feet high and 1,100 feet\r\nlong.  And they told him there was a tunnel 2,000 feet long and 1,000\r\nfeet high running through the hill, from end to end.  He believed it.  He\r\nrepeated it to everybody, discussed it, and read it from his notes.\r\nFinally, he took a useful hint from this remark, which a thoughtful old\r\npilgrim made:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, it is a little remarkable--singular tunnel altogether--stands\r\nup out of the top of the hill about two hundred feet, and one end of it\r\nsticks out of the hill about nine hundred!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere in Gibraltar he corners these educated British officers and badgers\r\nthem with braggadocio about America and the wonders she can perform!  He\r\ntold one of them a couple of our gunboats could come here and knock\r\nGibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea!\r\n\r\nAt this present moment half a dozen of us are taking a private pleasure\r\nexcursion of our own devising.  We form rather more than half the list of\r\nwhite passengers on board a small steamer bound for the venerable Moorish\r\ntown of Tangier, Africa.  Nothing could be more absolutely certain than\r\nthat we are enjoying ourselves.  One can not do otherwise who speeds over\r\nthese sparkling waters and breathes the soft atmosphere of this sunny\r\nland.  Care cannot assail us here.  We are out of its jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nWe even steamed recklessly by the frowning fortress of Malabat\r\n(a stronghold of the Emperor of Morocco) without a twinge of fear.\r\nThe whole garrison turned out under arms and assumed a threatening\r\nattitude--yet still we did not fear.  The entire garrison marched and\r\ncounter-marched within the rampart, in full view--yet notwithstanding\r\neven this, we never flinched.\r\n\r\nI suppose we really do not know what fear is.  I inquired the name of the\r\ngarrison of the fortress of Malabat, and they said it was Mehemet Ali Ben\r\nSancom.  I said it would be a good idea to get some more garrisons to\r\nhelp him; but they said no, he had nothing to do but hold the place, and\r\nhe was competent to do that, had done it two years already.  That was\r\nevidence which one could not well refute.  There is nothing like\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then my glove purchase in Gibraltar last night intrudes\r\nitself upon me.  Dan and the ship's surgeon and I had been up to the\r\ngreat square, listening to the music of the fine military bands and\r\ncontemplating English and Spanish female loveliness and fashion, and at\r\nnine o'clock were on our way to the theater, when we met the General, the\r\nJudge, the Commodore, the Colonel, and the Commissioner of the United\r\nStates of America to Europe, Asia, and Africa, who had been to the Club\r\nHouse to register their several titles and impoverish the bill of fare;\r\nand they told us to go over to the little variety store near the Hall of\r\nJustice and buy some kid gloves.  They said they were elegant and very\r\nmoderate in price.  It seemed a stylish thing to go to the theater in kid\r\ngloves, and we acted upon the hint.  A very handsome young lady in the\r\nstore offered me a pair of blue gloves.  I did not want blue, but she\r\nsaid they would look very pretty on a hand like mine.  The remark touched\r\nme tenderly.  I glanced furtively at my hand, and somehow it did seem\r\nrather a comely member.  I tried a glove on my left and blushed a little.\r\nManifestly the size was too small for me.  But I felt gratified when she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is just right!\xe2\x80\x9d  Yet I knew it was no such thing.\r\n\r\nI tugged at it diligently, but it was discouraging work.  She said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!  I see you are accustomed to wearing kid gloves--but some gentlemen\r\nare so awkward about putting them on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the last compliment I had expected.  I only understand putting on\r\nthe buckskin article perfectly.  I made another effort and tore the glove\r\nfrom the base of the thumb into the palm of the hand--and tried to hide\r\nthe rent.  She kept up her compliments, and I kept up my determination to\r\ndeserve them or die:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you have had experience!  [A rip down the back of the hand.] They\r\nare just right for you--your hand is very small--if they tear you need\r\nnot pay for them.  [A rent across the middle.]  I can always tell when a\r\ngentleman understands putting on kid gloves.  There is a grace about it\r\nthat only comes with long practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  The whole after-guard of the glove\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfetched away,\xe2\x80\x9d as the sailors say, the fabric parted across the\r\nknuckles, and nothing was left but a melancholy ruin.\r\n\r\nI was too much flattered to make an exposure and throw the merchandise on\r\nthe angel's hands.  I was hot, vexed, confused, but still happy; but I\r\nhated the other boys for taking such an absorbing interest in the\r\nproceedings.  I wished they were in Jericho.  I felt exquisitely mean\r\nwhen I said cheerfully:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis one does very well; it fits elegantly.  I like a glove that fits.\r\nNo, never mind, ma'am, never mind; I'll put the other on in the street.\r\nIt is warm here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was warm.  It was the warmest place I ever was in.  I paid the bill,\r\nand as I passed out with a fascinating bow I thought I detected a light\r\nin the woman's eye that was gently ironical; and when I looked back from\r\nthe street, and she was laughing all to herself about something or other,\r\nI said to myself with withering sarcasm, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly; you know how to\r\nput on kid gloves, don't you?  A self-complacent ass, ready to be\r\nflattered out of your senses by every petticoat that chooses to take the\r\ntrouble to do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe silence of the boys annoyed me.  Finally Dan said musingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome gentlemen don't know how to put on kid gloves at all, but some do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the doctor said (to the moon, I thought):\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is always easy to tell when a gentleman is used to putting on kid\r\ngloves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan soliloquized after a pause:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes; there is a grace about it that only comes with long, very long\r\npractice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, I've noticed that when a man hauls on a kid glove like he\r\nwas dragging a cat out of an ash hole by the tail, he understands putting\r\non kid gloves; he's had ex--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoys, enough of a thing's enough!  You think you are very smart, I\r\nsuppose, but I don't.  And if you go and tell any of those old gossips in\r\nthe ship about this thing, I'll never forgive you for it; that's all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey let me alone then for the time being.  We always let each other\r\nalone in time to prevent ill feeling from spoiling a joke.  But they had\r\nbought gloves, too, as I did.  We threw all the purchases away together\r\nthis morning.  They were coarse, unsubstantial, freckled all over with\r\nbroad yellow splotches, and could neither stand wear nor public\r\nexhibition.  We had entertained an angel unawares, but we did not take\r\nher in.  She did that for us.\r\n\r\nTangier!  A tribe of stalwart Moors are wading into the sea to carry us\r\nashore on their backs from the small boats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nThis is royal!  Let those who went up through Spain make the best of it\r\n--these dominions of the Emperor of Morocco suit our little party well\r\nenough.  We have had enough of Spain at Gibraltar for the present.\r\nTangier is the spot we have been longing for all the time.  Elsewhere we\r\nhave found foreign-looking things and foreign-looking people, but always\r\nwith things and people intermixed that we were familiar with before, and\r\nso the novelty of the situation lost a deal of its force.  We wanted\r\nsomething thoroughly and uncompromisingly foreign--foreign from top to\r\nbottom--foreign from center to circumference--foreign inside and outside\r\nand all around--nothing anywhere about it to dilute its foreignness\r\n--nothing to remind us of any other people or any other land under the sun.\r\nAnd lo!  In Tangier we have found it.  Here is not the slightest thing\r\nthat ever we have seen save in pictures--and we always mistrusted the\r\npictures before.  We cannot anymore.  The pictures used to seem\r\nexaggerations--they seemed too weird and fanciful for reality.  But\r\nbehold, they were not wild enough--they were not fanciful enough--they\r\nhave not told half the story.  Tangier is a foreign land if ever there\r\nwas one, and the true spirit of it can never be found in any book save\r\nThe Arabian Nights.  Here are no white men visible, yet swarms of\r\nhumanity are all about us.  Here is a packed and jammed city enclosed in\r\na massive stone wall which is more than a thousand years old.  All the\r\nhouses nearly are one-and two-story, made of thick walls of stone,\r\nplastered outside, square as a dry-goods box, flat as a floor on top, no\r\ncornices, whitewashed all over--a crowded city of snowy tombs!  And the\r\ndoors are arched with the peculiar arch we see in Moorish pictures; the\r\nfloors are laid in varicolored diamond flags; in tesselated, many-colored\r\nporcelain squares wrought in the furnaces of Fez; in red tiles and broad\r\nbricks that time cannot wear; there is no furniture in the rooms (of\r\nJewish dwellings) save divans--what there is in Moorish ones no man may\r\nknow; within their sacred walls no Christian dog can enter.  And the\r\nstreets are oriental--some of them three feet wide, some six, but only\r\ntwo that are over a dozen; a man can blockade the most of them by\r\nextending his body across them.  Isn't it an oriental picture?\r\n\r\nThere are stalwart Bedouins of the desert here, and stately Moors proud\r\nof a history that goes back to the night of time; and Jews whose fathers\r\nfled hither centuries upon centuries ago; and swarthy Riffians from the\r\nmountains--born cut-throats--and original, genuine Negroes as black as\r\nMoses; and howling dervishes and a hundred breeds of Arabs--all sorts and\r\ndescriptions of people that are foreign and curious to look upon.\r\n\r\nAnd their dresses are strange beyond all description.  Here is a bronzed\r\nMoor in a prodigious white turban, curiously embroidered jacket, gold and\r\ncrimson sash, of many folds, wrapped round and round his waist, trousers\r\nthat only come a little below his knee and yet have twenty yards of stuff\r\nin them, ornamented scimitar, bare shins, stockingless feet, yellow\r\nslippers, and gun of preposterous length--a mere soldier!--I thought he\r\nwas the Emperor at least.  And here are aged Moors with flowing white\r\nbeards and long white robes with vast cowls; and Bedouins with long,\r\ncowled, striped cloaks; and Negroes and Riffians with heads clean-shaven\r\nexcept a kinky scalp lock back of the ear or, rather, upon the after\r\ncorner of the skull; and all sorts of barbarians in all sorts of weird\r\ncostumes, and all more or less ragged.  And here are Moorish women who\r\nare enveloped from head to foot in coarse white robes, and whose sex can\r\nonly be determined by the fact that they only leave one eye visible and\r\nnever look at men of their own race, or are looked at by them in public.\r\nHere are five thousand Jews in blue gabardines, sashes about their\r\nwaists, slippers upon their feet, little skullcaps upon the backs of\r\ntheir heads, hair combed down on the forehead, and cut straight across\r\nthe middle of it from side to side--the selfsame fashion their Tangier\r\nancestors have worn for I don't know how many bewildering centuries.\r\nTheir feet and ankles are bare.  Their noses are all hooked, and hooked\r\nalike.  They all resemble each other so much that one could almost\r\nbelieve they were of one family.  Their women are plump and pretty, and\r\ndo smile upon a Christian in a way which is in the last degree\r\ncomforting.\r\n\r\nWhat a funny old town it is!  It seems like profanation to laugh and jest\r\nand bandy the frivolous chat of our day amid its hoary relics.  Only the\r\nstately phraseology and the measured speech of the sons of the Prophet\r\nare suited to a venerable antiquity like this.  Here is a crumbling wall\r\nthat was old when Columbus discovered America; was old when Peter the\r\nHermit roused the knightly men of the Middle Ages to arm for the first\r\nCrusade; was old when Charlemagne and his paladins beleaguered enchanted\r\ncastles and battled with giants and genii in the fabled days of the olden\r\ntime; was old when Christ and his disciples walked the earth; stood where\r\nit stands today when the lips of Memnon were vocal and men bought and\r\nsold in the streets of ancient Thebes!\r\n\r\nThe Phoenicians, the Carthagenians, the English, Moors, Romans, all have\r\nbattled for Tangier--all have won it and lost it.  Here is a ragged,\r\noriental-looking Negro from some desert place in interior Africa, filling\r\nhis goatskin with water from a stained and battered fountain built by the\r\nRomans twelve hundred years ago.  Yonder is a ruined arch of a bridge\r\nbuilt by Julius Caesar nineteen hundred years ago.  Men who had seen the\r\ninfant Saviour in the Virgin's arms have stood upon it, maybe.\r\n\r\nNear it are the ruins of a dockyard where Caesar repaired his ships and\r\nloaded them with grain when he invaded Britain, fifty years before the\r\nChristian era.\r\n\r\nHere, under the quiet stars, these old streets seem thronged with the\r\nphantoms of forgotten ages.  My eyes are resting upon a spot where stood\r\na monument which was seen and described by Roman historians less than two\r\nthousand years ago, whereon was inscribed:\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cWE ARE THE CANAANITES.  WE ARE THEY THAT\r\n               HAVE BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF THE LAND OF CANAAN\r\n               BY THE JEWISH ROBBER, JOSHUA.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoshua drove them out, and they came here.  Not many leagues from here is\r\na tribe of Jews whose ancestors fled thither after an unsuccessful revolt\r\nagainst King David, and these their descendants are still under a ban and\r\nkeep to themselves.\r\n\r\nTangier has been mentioned in history for three thousand years.  And it\r\nwas a town, though a queer one, when Hercules, clad in his lion skin,\r\nlanded here, four thousand years ago.  In these streets he met Anitus,\r\nthe king of the country, and brained him with his club, which was the\r\nfashion among gentlemen in those days.  The people of Tangier (called\r\nTingis then) lived in the rudest possible huts and dressed in skins and\r\ncarried clubs, and were as savage as the wild beasts they were constantly\r\nobliged to war with.  But they were a gentlemanly race and did no work.\r\nThey lived on the natural products of the land.  Their king's country\r\nresidence was at the famous Garden of Hesperides, seventy miles down the\r\ncoast from here.  The garden, with its golden apples (oranges), is gone\r\nnow--no vestige of it remains.  Antiquarians concede that such a\r\npersonage as Hercules did exist in ancient times and agree that he was an\r\nenterprising and energetic man, but decline to believe him a good,\r\nbona-fide god, because that would be unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nDown here at Cape Spartel is the celebrated cave of Hercules, where that\r\nhero took refuge when he was vanquished and driven out of the Tangier\r\ncountry.  It is full of inscriptions in the dead languages, which fact\r\nmakes me think Hercules could not have traveled much, else he would not\r\nhave kept a journal.\r\n\r\nFive days' journey from here--say two hundred miles--are the ruins of an\r\nancient city, of whose history there is neither record nor tradition.\r\nAnd yet its arches, its columns, and its statues proclaim it to have been\r\nbuilt by an enlightened race.\r\n\r\nThe general size of a store in Tangier is about that of an ordinary\r\nshower bath in a civilized land.  The Muhammadan merchant, tinman,\r\nshoemaker, or vendor of trifles sits cross-legged on the floor and\r\nreaches after any article you may want to buy.  You can rent a whole\r\nblock of these pigeonholes for fifty dollars a month.  The market people\r\ncrowd the marketplace with their baskets of figs, dates, melons,\r\napricots, etc., and among them file trains of laden asses, not much\r\nlarger, if any, than a Newfoundland dog.  The scene is lively, is\r\npicturesque, and smells like a police court.  The Jewish money-changers\r\nhave their dens close at hand, and all day long are counting bronze coins\r\nand transferring them from one bushel basket to another.  They don't coin\r\nmuch money nowadays, I think.  I saw none but what was dated four or five\r\nhundred years back, and was badly worn and battered.  These coins are not\r\nvery valuable.  Jack went out to get a napoleon changed, so as to have\r\nmoney suited to the general cheapness of things, and came back and said\r\nhe had \xe2\x80\x9cswamped the bank, had bought eleven quarts of coin, and the head\r\nof the firm had gone on the street to negotiate for the balance of the\r\nchange.\xe2\x80\x9d  I bought nearly half a pint of their money for a shilling\r\nmyself.  I am not proud on account of having so much money, though.  I\r\ncare nothing for wealth.\r\n\r\nThe Moors have some small silver coins and also some silver slugs worth a\r\ndollar each.  The latter are exceedingly scarce--so much so that when\r\npoor ragged Arabs see one they beg to be allowed to kiss it.\r\n\r\nThey have also a small gold coin worth two dollars.  And that reminds me\r\nof something.  When Morocco is in a state of war, Arab couriers carry\r\nletters through the country and charge a liberal postage.  Every now and\r\nthen they fall into the hands of marauding bands and get robbed.\r\nTherefore, warned by experience, as soon as they have collected two\r\ndollars' worth of money they exchange it for one of those little gold\r\npieces, and when robbers come upon them, swallow it.  The stratagem was\r\ngood while it was unsuspected, but after that the marauders simply gave\r\nthe sagacious United States mail an emetic and sat down to wait.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Morocco is a soulless despot, and the great officers under\r\nhim are despots on a smaller scale.  There is no regular system of\r\ntaxation, but when the Emperor or the Bashaw want money, they levy on\r\nsome rich man, and he has to furnish the cash or go to prison.\r\nTherefore, few men in Morocco dare to be rich.  It is too dangerous a\r\nluxury.  Vanity occasionally leads a man to display wealth, but sooner or\r\nlater the Emperor trumps up a charge against him--any sort of one will\r\ndo--and confiscates his property.  Of course, there are many rich men in\r\nthe empire, but their money is buried, and they dress in rags and\r\ncounterfeit poverty.  Every now and then the Emperor imprisons a man who\r\nis suspected of the crime of being rich, and makes things so\r\nuncomfortable for him that he is forced to discover where he has hidden\r\nhis money.\r\n\r\nMoors and Jews sometimes place themselves under the protection of the\r\nforeign consuls, and then they can flout their riches in the Emperor's\r\nface with impunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nAbout the first adventure we had yesterday afternoon, after landing here,\r\ncame near finishing that heedless Blucher.  We had just mounted some\r\nmules and asses and started out under the guardianship of the stately,\r\nthe princely, the magnificent Hadji Muhammad Lamarty (may his tribe\r\nincrease!) when we came upon a fine Moorish mosque, with tall tower, rich\r\nwith checker-work of many-colored porcelain, and every part and portion\r\nof the edifice adorned with the quaint architecture of the Alhambra, and\r\nBlucher started to ride into the open doorway.  A startling \xe2\x80\x9cHi-hi!\xe2\x80\x9d from\r\nour camp followers and a loud \xe2\x80\x9cHalt!\xe2\x80\x9d from an English gentleman in the\r\nparty checked the adventurer, and then we were informed that so dire a\r\nprofanation is it for a Christian dog to set foot upon the sacred\r\nthreshold of a Moorish mosque that no amount of purification can ever\r\nmake it fit for the faithful to pray in again.  Had Blucher succeeded in\r\nentering the place, he would no doubt have been chased through the town\r\nand stoned; and the time has been, and not many years ago, either, when a\r\nChristian would have been most ruthlessly slaughtered if captured in a\r\nmosque.  We caught a glimpse of the handsome tessellated pavements within\r\nand of the devotees performing their ablutions at the fountains, but even\r\nthat we took that glimpse was a thing not relished by the Moorish\r\nbystanders.\r\n\r\nSome years ago the clock in the tower of the mosque got out of order.\r\nThe Moors of Tangier have so degenerated that it has been long since\r\nthere was an artificer among them capable of curing so delicate a patient\r\nas a debilitated clock.  The great men of the city met in solemn conclave\r\nto consider how the difficulty was to be met.  They discussed the matter\r\nthoroughly but arrived at no solution.  Finally, a patriarch arose and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, children of the Prophet, it is known unto you that a Portuguee dog\r\nof a Christian clock mender pollutes the city of Tangier with his\r\npresence.  Ye know, also, that when mosques are builded, asses bear the\r\nstones and the cement, and cross the sacred threshold.  Now, therefore,\r\nsend the Christian dog on all fours, and barefoot, into the holy place to\r\nmend the clock, and let him go as an ass!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in that way it was done.  Therefore, if Blucher ever sees the inside\r\nof a mosque, he will have to cast aside his humanity and go in his\r\nnatural character.  We visited the jail and found Moorish prisoners\r\nmaking mats and baskets.  (This thing of utilizing crime savors of\r\ncivilization.)  Murder is punished with death.  A short time ago three\r\nmurderers were taken beyond the city walls and shot.  Moorish guns are\r\nnot good, and neither are Moorish marksmen.  In this instance they set up\r\nthe poor criminals at long range, like so many targets, and practiced on\r\nthem--kept them hopping about and dodging bullets for half an hour before\r\nthey managed to drive the center.\r\n\r\nWhen a man steals cattle, they cut off his right hand and left leg and\r\nnail them up in the marketplace as a warning to everybody.  Their surgery\r\nis not artistic.  They slice around the bone a little, then break off the\r\nlimb.  Sometimes the patient gets well; but, as a general thing, he\r\ndon't.  However, the Moorish heart is stout.  The Moors were always\r\nbrave.  These criminals undergo the fearful operation without a wince,\r\nwithout a tremor of any kind, without a groan!  No amount of suffering\r\ncan bring down the pride of a Moor or make him shame his dignity with a\r\ncry.\r\n\r\nHere, marriage is contracted by the parents of the parties to it.  There\r\nare no valentines, no stolen interviews, no riding out, no courting in\r\ndim parlors, no lovers' quarrels and reconciliations--no nothing that is\r\nproper to approaching matrimony.  The young man takes the girl his father\r\nselects for him, marries her, and after that she is unveiled, and he sees\r\nher for the first time.  If after due acquaintance she suits him, he\r\nretains her; but if he suspects her purity, he bundles her back to her\r\nfather; if he finds her diseased, the same; or if, after just and\r\nreasonable time is allowed her, she neglects to bear children, back she\r\ngoes to the home of her childhood.\r\n\r\nMuhammadans here who can afford it keep a good many wives on hand.  They\r\nare called wives, though I believe the Koran only allows four genuine\r\nwives--the rest are concubines.  The Emperor of Morocco don't know how\r\nmany wives he has, but thinks he has five hundred.  However, that is near\r\nenough--a dozen or so, one way or the other, don't matter.\r\n\r\nEven the Jews in the interior have a plurality of wives.\r\n\r\nI have caught a glimpse of the faces of several Moorish women (for they\r\nare only human, and will expose their faces for the admiration of a\r\nChristian dog when no male Moor is by), and I am full of veneration for\r\nthe wisdom that leads them to cover up such atrocious ugliness.\r\n\r\nThey carry their children at their backs, in a sack, like other savages\r\nthe world over.\r\n\r\nMany of the Negroes are held in slavery by the Moors.  But the moment a\r\nfemale slave becomes her master's concubine her bonds are broken, and as\r\nsoon as a male slave can read the first chapter of the Koran (which\r\ncontains the creed) he can no longer be held in bondage.\r\n\r\nThey have three Sundays a week in Tangier.  The Muhammadans' comes on\r\nFriday, the Jews' on Saturday, and that of the Christian Consuls on\r\nSunday.  The Jews are the most radical.  The Moor goes to his mosque\r\nabout noon on his Sabbath, as on any other day, removes his shoes at the\r\ndoor, performs his ablutions, makes his salaams, pressing his forehead to\r\nthe pavement time and again, says his prayers, and goes back to his work.\r\n\r\nBut the Jew shuts up shop; will not touch copper or bronze money at all;\r\nsoils his fingers with nothing meaner than silver and gold; attends the\r\nsynagogue devoutly; will not cook or have anything to do with fire; and\r\nreligiously refrains from embarking in any enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Moor who has made a pilgrimage to Mecca is entitled to high\r\ndistinction.  Men call him Hadji, and he is thenceforward a great\r\npersonage.  Hundreds of Moors come to Tangier every year and embark for\r\nMecca.  They go part of the way in English steamers, and the ten or\r\ntwelve dollars they pay for passage is about all the trip costs.  They\r\ntake with them a quantity of food, and when the commissary department\r\nfails they \xe2\x80\x9cskirmish,\xe2\x80\x9d as Jack terms it in his sinful, slangy way.  From\r\nthe time they leave till they get home again, they never wash, either on\r\nland or sea.  They are usually gone from five to seven months, and as\r\nthey do not change their clothes during all that time, they are totally\r\nunfit for the drawing room when they get back.\r\n\r\nMany of them have to rake and scrape a long time to gather together the\r\nten dollars their steamer passage costs, and when one of them gets back\r\nhe is a bankrupt forever after.  Few Moors can ever build up their\r\nfortunes again in one short lifetime after so reckless an outlay.  In\r\norder to confine the dignity of Hadji to gentlemen of patrician blood and\r\npossessions, the Emperor decreed that no man should make the pilgrimage\r\nsave bloated aristocrats who were worth a hundred dollars in specie.  But\r\nbehold how iniquity can circumvent the law!  For a consideration, the\r\nJewish money-changer lends the pilgrim one hundred dollars long enough\r\nfor him to swear himself through, and then receives it back before the\r\nship sails out of the harbor!\r\n\r\nSpain is the only nation the Moors fear.  The reason is that Spain sends\r\nher heaviest ships of war and her loudest guns to astonish these Muslims,\r\nwhile America and other nations send only a little contemptible tub of a\r\ngunboat occasionally.  The Moors, like other savages, learn by what they\r\nsee, not what they hear or read.  We have great fleets in the\r\nMediterranean, but they seldom touch at African ports.  The Moors have a\r\nsmall opinion of England, France, and America, and put their\r\nrepresentatives to a deal of red-tape circumlocution before they grant\r\nthem their common rights, let alone a favor.  But the moment the Spanish\r\nminister makes a demand, it is acceded to at once, whether it be just or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nSpain chastised the Moors five or six years ago, about a disputed piece\r\nof property opposite Gibraltar, and captured the city of Tetouan.  She\r\ncompromised on an augmentation of her territory, twenty million dollars'\r\nindemnity in money, and peace.  And then she gave up the city.  But she\r\nnever gave it up until the Spanish soldiers had eaten up all the cats.\r\nThey would not compromise as long as the cats held out.  Spaniards are\r\nvery fond of cats.  On the contrary, the Moors reverence cats as\r\nsomething sacred.  So the Spaniards touched them on a tender point that\r\ntime.  Their unfeline conduct in eating up all the Tetouan cats aroused a\r\nhatred toward them in the breasts of the Moors, to which even the driving\r\nthem out of Spain was tame and passionless.  Moors and Spaniards are foes\r\nforever now.  France had a minister here once who embittered the nation\r\nagainst him in the most innocent way.  He killed a couple of battalions\r\nof cats (Tangier is full of them) and made a parlor carpet out of their\r\nhides.  He made his carpet in circles--first a circle of old gray\r\ntomcats, with their tails all pointing toward the center; then a circle\r\nof yellow cats; next a circle of black cats and a circle of white ones;\r\nthen a circle of all sorts of cats; and, finally, a centerpiece of\r\nassorted kittens.  It was very beautiful, but the Moors curse his memory\r\nto this day.\r\n\r\nWhen we went to call on our American Consul General today I noticed that\r\nall possible games for parlor amusement seemed to be represented on his\r\ncenter tables.  I thought that hinted at lonesomeness.  The idea was\r\ncorrect.  His is the only American family in Tangier.  There are many\r\nforeign consuls in this place, but much visiting is not indulged in.\r\nTangier is clear out of the world, and what is the use of visiting when\r\npeople have nothing on earth to talk about?  There is none.  So each\r\nconsul's family stays at home chiefly and amuses itself as best it can.\r\nTangier is full of interest for one day, but after that it is a weary\r\nprison.  The Consul General has been here five years, and has got enough\r\nof it to do him for a century, and is going home shortly.  His family\r\nseize upon their letters and papers when the mail arrives, read them over\r\nand over again for two days or three, talk them over and over again for\r\ntwo or three more till they wear them out, and after that for days\r\ntogether they eat and drink and sleep, and ride out over the same old\r\nroad, and see the same old tiresome things that even decades of centuries\r\nhave scarcely changed, and say never a single word!  They have literally\r\nnothing whatever to talk about.  The arrival of an American man-of-war is\r\na godsend to them.  \xe2\x80\x9cO Solitude, where are the charms which sages have\r\nseen in thy face?\xe2\x80\x9d  It is the completest exile that I can conceive of.\r\nI would seriously recommend to the government of the United States that\r\nwhen a man commits a crime so heinous that the law provides no adequate\r\npunishment for it, they make him Consul General to Tangier.\r\n\r\nI am glad to have seen Tangier--the second-oldest town in the world.  But\r\nI am ready to bid it good-bye, I believe.\r\n\r\nWe shall go hence to Gibraltar this evening or in the morning, and\r\ndoubtless the __Quaker City__ will sail from that port within the next\r\nforty-eight hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nWe passed the Fourth of July on board the __Quaker City__, in mid-ocean.  It\r\nwas in all respects a characteristic Mediterranean day--faultlessly\r\nbeautiful.  A cloudless sky; a refreshing summer wind; a radiant sunshine\r\nthat glinted cheerily from dancing wavelets instead of crested mountains\r\nof water; a sea beneath us that was so wonderfully blue, so richly,\r\nbrilliantly blue, that it overcame the dullest sensibilities with the\r\nspell of its fascination.\r\n\r\nThey even have fine sunsets on the Mediterranean--a thing that is\r\ncertainly rare in most quarters of the globe.  The evening we sailed away\r\nfrom Gibraltar, that hard-featured rock was swimming in a creamy mist so\r\nrich, so soft, so enchantingly vague and dreamy, that even the Oracle,\r\nthat serene, that inspired, that overpowering humbug, scorned the dinner\r\ngong and tarried to worship!\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that's gorgis, ain't it!  They don't have none of them\r\nthings in our parts, do they?  I consider that them effects is on account\r\nof the superior refragability, as you may say, of the sun's diramic\r\ncombination with the lymphatic forces of the perihelion of Jubiter.  What\r\nshould you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, go to bed!\xe2\x80\x9d Dan said that, and went away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, it's all very well to say go to bed when a man makes an\r\nargument which another man can't answer.  Dan don't never stand any\r\nchance in an argument with me.  And he knows it, too.  What should you\r\nsay, Jack?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Doctor, don't you come bothering around me with that dictionary\r\nbosh.  I don't do you any harm, do I?  Then you let me alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's gone, too.  Well, them fellows have all tackled the old Oracle, as\r\nthey say, but the old man's most too many for 'em.  Maybe the Poet Lariat\r\nain't satisfied with them deductions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poet replied with a barbarous rhyme and went below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Pears that he can't qualify, neither.  Well, I didn't expect nothing\r\nout of him.  I never see one of them poets yet that knowed anything.\r\nHe'll go down now and grind out about four reams of the awfullest slush\r\nabout that old rock and give it to a consul, or a pilot, or a nigger, or\r\nanybody he comes across first which he can impose on.  Pity but\r\nsomebody'd take that poor old lunatic and dig all that poetry rubbage out\r\nof him.  Why can't a man put his intellect onto things that's some value?\r\nGibbons, and Hippocratus, and Sarcophagus, and all them old ancient\r\nphilosophers was down on poets--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are going to invent authorities now and I'll leave\r\nyou, too.  I always enjoy your conversation, notwithstanding the\r\nluxuriance of your syllables, when the philosophy you offer rests on your\r\nown responsibility; but when you begin to soar--when you begin to support\r\nit with the evidence of authorities who are the creations of your own\r\nfancy--I lose confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was the way to flatter the doctor.  He considered it a sort of\r\nacknowledgment on my part of a fear to argue with him.  He was always\r\npersecuting the passengers with abstruse propositions framed in language\r\nthat no man could understand, and they endured the exquisite torture a\r\nminute or two and then abandoned the field.  A triumph like this, over\r\nhalf a dozen antagonists was sufficient for one day; from that time\r\nforward he would patrol the decks beaming blandly upon all comers, and so\r\ntranquilly, blissfully happy!\r\n\r\nBut I digress.  The thunder of our two brave cannon announced the Fourth\r\nof July, at daylight, to all who were awake.  But many of us got our\r\ninformation at a later hour, from the almanac.  All the flags were sent\r\naloft except half a dozen that were needed to decorate portions of the\r\nship below, and in a short time the vessel assumed a holiday appearance.\r\nDuring the morning, meetings were held and all manner of committees set\r\nto work on the celebration ceremonies.  In the afternoon the ship's\r\ncompany assembled aft, on deck, under the awnings; the flute, the\r\nasthmatic melodeon, and the consumptive clarinet crippled \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nStar-Spangled Banner,\xe2\x80\x9d the choir chased it to cover, and George came in\r\nwith a peculiarly lacerating screech on the final note and slaughtered\r\nit. Nobody mourned.\r\n\r\nWe carried out the corpse on three cheers (that joke was not intentional\r\nand I do not endorse it), and then the President, throned behind a cable\r\nlocker with a national flag spread over it, announced the \xe2\x80\x9cReader,\xe2\x80\x9d who\r\nrose up and read that same old Declaration of Independence which we have\r\nall listened to so often without paying any attention to what it said;\r\nand after that the President piped the Orator of the Day to quarters and\r\nhe made that same old speech about our national greatness which we so\r\nreligiously believe and so fervently applaud.  Now came the choir into\r\ncourt again, with the complaining instruments, and assaulted \xe2\x80\x9cHail\r\nColumbia\xe2\x80\x9d; and when victory hung wavering in the scale, George returned\r\nwith his dreadful wild-goose stop turned on and the choir won, of course.\r\nA minister pronounced the benediction, and the patriotic little gathering\r\ndisbanded.  The Fourth of July was safe, as far as the Mediterranean was\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nAt dinner in the evening, a well-written original poem was recited with\r\nspirit by one of the ship's captains, and thirteen regular toasts were\r\nwashed down with several baskets of champagne.  The speeches were bad\r\n--execrable almost without exception.  In fact, without any exception but\r\none.  Captain Duncan made a good speech; he made the only good speech of\r\nthe evening.  He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--May we all live to a green old age and be\r\nprosperous and happy.  Steward, bring up another basket of champagne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was regarded as a very able effort.\r\n\r\nThe festivities, so to speak, closed with another of those miraculous\r\nballs on the promenade deck.  We were not used to dancing on an even\r\nkeel, though, and it was only a questionable success.  But take it all\r\ntogether, it was a bright, cheerful, pleasant Fourth.\r\n\r\nToward nightfall the next evening, we steamed into the great artificial\r\nharbor of this noble city of Marseilles, and saw the dying sunlight gild\r\nits clustering spires and ramparts, and flood its leagues of environing\r\nverdure with a mellow radiance that touched with an added charm the white\r\nvillas that flecked the landscape far and near.  [Copyright secured\r\naccording to law.]\r\n\r\nThere were no stages out, and we could not get on the pier from the ship.\r\nIt was annoying.  We were full of enthusiasm--we wanted to see France!\r\nJust at nightfall our party of three contracted with a waterman for the\r\nprivilege of using his boat as a bridge--its stern was at our companion\r\nladder and its bow touched the pier.  We got in and the fellow backed out\r\ninto the harbor.  I told him in French that all we wanted was to walk\r\nover his thwarts and step ashore, and asked him what he went away out\r\nthere for.  He said he could not understand me.  I repeated.  Still he\r\ncould not understand.  He appeared to be very ignorant of French.  The\r\ndoctor tried him, but he could not understand the doctor.  I asked this\r\nboatman to explain his conduct, which he did; and then I couldn't\r\nunderstand him.  Dan said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, go to the pier, you old fool--that's where we want to go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe reasoned calmly with Dan that it was useless to speak to this\r\nforeigner in English--that he had better let us conduct this business in\r\nthe French language and not let the stranger see how uncultivated he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go on, go on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdon't mind me.  I don't wish to\r\ninterfere.  Only, if you go on telling him in your kind of French, he\r\nnever will find out where we want to go to.  That is what I think about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe rebuked him severely for this remark and said we never knew an\r\nignorant person yet but was prejudiced.  The Frenchman spoke again, and\r\nthe doctor said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, Dan, he says he is going to allez to the douain.  Means he is\r\ngoing to the hotel.  Oh, certainly--we don't know the French language.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a crusher, as Jack would say.  It silenced further criticism\r\nfrom the disaffected member.  We coasted past the sharp bows of a navy of\r\ngreat steamships and stopped at last at a government building on a stone\r\npier.  It was easy to remember then that the douain was the customhouse\r\nand not the hotel.  We did not mention it, however.  With winning French\r\npoliteness the officers merely opened and closed our satchels, declined\r\nto examine our passports, and sent us on our way.  We stopped at the\r\nfirst cafe we came to and entered.  An old woman seated us at a table and\r\nwaited for orders.  The doctor said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAvez-vous du vin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dame looked perplexed.  The doctor said again, with elaborate\r\ndistinctness of articulation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAvez-vous du--vin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dame looked more perplexed than before.  I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor, there is a flaw in your pronunciation somewhere.  Let me try\r\nher.  Madame, avez-vous du vin?--It isn't any use, Doctor--take the\r\nwitness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame, avez-vous du vin--du fromage--pain--pickled pigs' feet--beurre\r\n--des oeufs--du boeuf--horseradish, sauerkraut, hog and hominy--anything,\r\nanything in the world that can stay a Christian stomach!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless you, why didn't you speak English before?  I don't know anything\r\nabout your plagued French!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe humiliating taunts of the disaffected member spoiled the supper, and\r\nwe dispatched it in angry silence and got away as soon as we could.  Here\r\nwe were in beautiful France--in a vast stone house of quaint\r\narchitecture--surrounded by all manner of curiously worded French signs\r\n--stared at by strangely habited, bearded French people--everything\r\ngradually and surely forcing upon us the coveted consciousness that at\r\nlast, and beyond all question, we were in beautiful France and absorbing\r\nits nature to the forgetfulness of everything else, and coming to feel\r\nthe happy romance of the thing in all its enchanting delightfulness--and\r\nto think of this skinny veteran intruding with her vile English, at such\r\na moment, to blow the fair vision to the winds!  It was exasperating.\r\n\r\nWe set out to find the centre of the city, inquiring the direction every\r\nnow and then.  We never did succeed in making anybody understand just\r\nexactly what we wanted, and neither did we ever succeed in comprehending\r\njust exactly what they said in reply, but then they always pointed--they\r\nalways did that--and we bowed politely and said, \xe2\x80\x9cMerci, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nso it was a blighting triumph over the disaffected member anyway.  He was\r\nrestive under these victories and often asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did that pirate say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he told us which way to go to find the Grand Casino.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but what did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it don't matter what he said--we understood him.  These are educated\r\npeople--not like that absurd boatman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wish they were educated enough to tell a man a direction that\r\ngoes some where--for we've been going around in a circle for an hour.\r\nI've passed this same old drugstore seven times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe said it was a low, disreputable falsehood (but we knew it was not).\r\nIt was plain that it would not do to pass that drugstore again, though\r\n--we might go on asking directions, but we must cease from following\r\nfinger-pointings if we hoped to check the suspicions of the disaffected\r\nmember.\r\n\r\nA long walk through smooth, asphaltum-paved streets bordered by blocks of\r\nvast new mercantile houses of cream-colored stone every house and every\r\nblock precisely like all the other houses and all the other blocks for a\r\nmile, and all brilliantly lighted--brought us at last to the principal\r\nthoroughfare.  On every hand were bright colors, flashing constellations\r\nof gas burners, gaily dressed men and women thronging the sidewalks\r\n--hurry, life, activity, cheerfulness, conversation, and laughter\r\neverywhere!  We found the Grand Hotel du Louvre et de la Paix, and wrote\r\ndown who we were, where we were born, what our occupations were, the\r\nplace we came from last, whether we were married or single, how we liked\r\nit, how old we were, where we were bound for and when we expected to get\r\nthere, and a great deal of information of similar importance--all for the\r\nbenefit of the landlord and the secret police.  We hired a guide and\r\nbegan the business of sightseeing immediately.  That first night on\r\nFrench soil was a stirring one.  I cannot think of half the places we\r\nwent to or what we particularly saw; we had no disposition to examine\r\ncarefully into anything at all--we only wanted to glance and go--to move,\r\nkeep moving!  The spirit of the country was upon us.  We sat down,\r\nfinally, at a late hour, in the great Casino, and called for unstinted\r\nchampagne.  It is so easy to be bloated aristocrats where it costs\r\nnothing of consequence!  There were about five hundred people in that\r\ndazzling place, I suppose, though the walls being papered entirely with\r\nmirrors, so to speak, one could not really tell but that there were a\r\nhundred thousand.  Young, daintily dressed exquisites and young,\r\nstylishly dressed women, and also old gentlemen and old ladies, sat in\r\ncouples and groups about innumerable marble-topped tables and ate fancy\r\nsuppers, drank wine, and kept up a chattering din of conversation that\r\nwas dazing to the senses.  There was a stage at the far end and a large\r\norchestra; and every now and then actors and actresses in preposterous\r\ncomic dresses came out and sang the most extravagantly funny songs, to\r\njudge by their absurd actions; but that audience merely suspended its\r\nchatter, stared cynically, and never once smiled, never once applauded!\r\nI had always thought that Frenchmen were ready to laugh at any thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nWe are getting foreignized rapidly and with facility.  We are getting\r\nreconciled to halls and bedchambers with unhomelike stone floors and no\r\ncarpets--floors that ring to the tread of one's heels with a sharpness\r\nthat is death to sentimental musing.  We are getting used to tidy,\r\nnoiseless waiters, who glide hither and thither, and hover about your\r\nback and your elbows like butterflies, quick to comprehend orders, quick\r\nto fill them; thankful for a gratuity without regard to the amount; and\r\nalways polite--never otherwise than polite.  That is the strangest\r\ncuriosity yet--a really polite hotel waiter who isn't an idiot.  We are\r\ngetting used to driving right into the central court of the hotel, in the\r\nmidst of a fragrant circle of vines and flowers, and in the midst also of\r\nparties of gentlemen sitting quietly reading the paper and smoking.  We\r\nare getting used to ice frozen by artificial process in ordinary bottles\r\n--the only kind of ice they have here.  We are getting used to all these\r\nthings, but we are not getting used to carrying our own soap.  We are\r\nsufficiently civilized to carry our own combs and toothbrushes, but this\r\nthing of having to ring for soap every time we wash is new to us and not\r\npleasant at all.  We think of it just after we get our heads and faces\r\nthoroughly wet or just when we think we have been in the bathtub long\r\nenough, and then, of course, an annoying delay follows.  These\r\nMarseillaises make Marseillaise hymns and Marseilles vests and Marseilles\r\nsoap for all the world, but they never sing their hymns or wear their\r\nvests or wash with their soap themselves.\r\n\r\nWe have learned to go through the lingering routine of the table d'hote\r\nwith patience, with serenity, with satisfaction.  We take soup, then wait\r\na few minutes for the fish; a few minutes more and the plates are\r\nchanged, and the roast beef comes; another change and we take peas;\r\nchange again and take lentils; change and take snail patties (I prefer\r\ngrasshoppers); change and take roast chicken and salad; then strawberry\r\npie and ice cream; then green figs, pears, oranges, green almonds, etc.;\r\nfinally coffee.  Wine with every course, of course, being in France.\r\nWith such a cargo on board, digestion is a slow process, and we must sit\r\nlong in the cool chambers and smoke--and read French newspapers, which\r\nhave a strange fashion of telling a perfectly straight story till you get\r\nto the \xe2\x80\x9cnub\xe2\x80\x9d of it, and then a word drops in that no man can translate,\r\nand that story is ruined.  An embankment fell on some Frenchmen\r\nyesterday, and the papers are full of it today--but whether those\r\nsufferers were killed, or crippled, or bruised, or only scared is more\r\nthan I can possibly make out, and yet I would just give anything to know.\r\n\r\nWe were troubled a little at dinner today by the conduct of an American,\r\nwho talked very loudly and coarsely and laughed boisterously where all\r\nothers were so quiet and well behaved.  He ordered wine with a royal\r\nflourish and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never dine without wine, sir\xe2\x80\x9d (which was a pitiful falsehood), and\r\nlooked around upon the company to bask in the admiration he expected to\r\nfind in their faces.  All these airs in a land where they would as soon\r\nexpect to leave the soup out of the bill of fare as the wine!--in a land\r\nwhere wine is nearly as common among all ranks as water!  This fellow\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cI am a free-born sovereign, sir, an American, sir, and I want\r\neverybody to know it!\xe2\x80\x9d  He did not mention that he was a lineal\r\ndescendant of Balaam's ass, but everybody knew that without his telling\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe have driven in the Prado--that superb avenue bordered with patrician\r\nmansions and noble shade trees--and have visited the chateau Boarely and\r\nits curious museum.  They showed us a miniature cemetery there--a copy of\r\nthe first graveyard that was ever in Marseilles, no doubt.  The delicate\r\nlittle skeletons were lying in broken vaults and had their household gods\r\nand kitchen utensils with them.  The original of this cemetery was dug up\r\nin the principal street of the city a few years ago.  It had remained\r\nthere, only twelve feet underground, for a matter of twenty-five hundred\r\nyears or thereabouts.  Romulus was here before he built Rome, and thought\r\nsomething of founding a city on this spot, but gave up the idea.  He may\r\nhave been personally acquainted with some of these Phoenicians whose\r\nskeletons we have been examining.\r\n\r\nIn the great Zoological Gardens we found specimens of all the animals the\r\nworld produces, I think, including a dromedary, a monkey ornamented with\r\ntufts of brilliant blue and carmine hair--a very gorgeous monkey he was\r\n--a hippopotamus from the Nile, and a sort of tall, long-legged bird with a\r\nbeak like a powder horn and close-fitting wings like the tails of a dress\r\ncoat.  This fellow stood up with his eyes shut and his shoulders stooped\r\nforward a little, and looked as if he had his hands under his coat\r\ntails. Such tranquil stupidity, such supernatural gravity, such\r\nself-righteousness, and such ineffable self-complacency as were in the\r\ncountenance and attitude of that gray-bodied, dark-winged, bald-headed,\r\nand preposterously uncomely bird!  He was so ungainly, so pimply about\r\nthe head, so scaly about the legs, yet so serene, so unspeakably\r\nsatisfied!  He was the most comical-looking creature that can be\r\nimagined.  It was good to hear Dan and the doctor laugh--such natural and\r\nsuch enjoyable laughter had not been heard among our excursionists since\r\nour ship sailed away from America.  This bird was a godsend to us, and I\r\nshould be an ingrate if I forgot to make honorable mention of him in\r\nthese pages.  Ours was a pleasure excursion; therefore we stayed with\r\nthat bird an hour and made the most of him.  We stirred him up\r\noccasionally, but he only unclosed an eye and slowly closed it again,\r\nabating no jot of his stately piety of demeanor or his tremendous\r\nseriousness.  He only seemed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cDefile not Heaven's anointed with\r\nunsanctified hands.\xe2\x80\x9d  We did not know his name, and so we called him \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nPilgrim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dan said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll he wants now is a Plymouth Collection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boon companion of the colossal elephant was a common cat!  This cat\r\nhad a fashion of climbing up the elephant's hind legs and roosting on his\r\nback.  She would sit up there, with her paws curved under her breast, and\r\nsleep in the sun half the afternoon.  It used to annoy the elephant at\r\nfirst, and he would reach up and take her down, but she would go aft and\r\nclimb up again.  She persisted until she finally conquered the elephant's\r\nprejudices, and now they are inseparable friends.  The cat plays about\r\nher comrade's forefeet or his trunk often, until dogs approach, and then\r\nshe goes aloft out of danger.  The elephant has annihilated several dogs\r\nlately that pressed his companion too closely.\r\n\r\nWe hired a sailboat and a guide and made an excursion to one of the small\r\nislands in the harbor to visit the Castle d'If.  This ancient fortress\r\nhas a melancholy history.  It has been used as a prison for political\r\noffenders for two or three hundred years, and its dungeon walls are\r\nscarred with the rudely carved names of many and many a captive who\r\nfretted his life away here and left no record of himself but these sad\r\nepitaphs wrought with his own hands.  How thick the names were!  And\r\ntheir long-departed owners seemed to throng the gloomy cells and\r\ncorridors with their phantom shapes.  We loitered through dungeon after\r\ndungeon, away down into the living rock below the level of the sea, it\r\nseemed.  Names everywhere!--some plebeian, some noble, some even\r\nprincely.  Plebeian, prince, and noble had one solicitude in common--they\r\nwould not be forgotten!  They could suffer solitude, inactivity, and the\r\nhorrors of a silence that no sound ever disturbed, but they could not\r\nbear the thought of being utterly forgotten by the world.  Hence the\r\ncarved names.  In one cell, where a little light penetrated, a man had\r\nlived twenty-seven years without seeing the face of a human being--lived\r\nin filth and wretchedness, with no companionship but his own thoughts,\r\nand they were sorrowful enough and hopeless enough, no doubt.  Whatever\r\nhis jailers considered that he needed was conveyed to his cell by night\r\nthrough a wicket.\r\n\r\nThis man carved the walls of his prison house from floor to roof with all\r\nmanner of figures of men and animals grouped in intricate designs.  He\r\nhad toiled there year after year, at his self-appointed task, while\r\ninfants grew to boyhood--to vigorous youth--idled through school and\r\ncollege--acquired a profession--claimed man's mature estate--married and\r\nlooked back to infancy as to a thing of some vague, ancient time, almost.\r\nBut who shall tell how many ages it seemed to this prisoner?  With the\r\none, time flew sometimes; with the other, never--it crawled always.  To\r\nthe one, nights spent in dancing had seemed made of minutes instead of\r\nhours; to the other, those selfsame nights had been like all other nights\r\nof dungeon life and seemed made of slow, dragging weeks instead of hours\r\nand minutes.\r\n\r\nOne prisoner of fifteen years had scratched verses upon his walls, and\r\nbrief prose sentences--brief, but full of pathos.  These spoke not of\r\nhimself and his hard estate, but only of the shrine where his spirit fled\r\nthe prison to worship--of home and the idols that were templed there.\r\nHe never lived to see them.\r\n\r\nThe walls of these dungeons are as thick as some bed-chambers at home are\r\nwide--fifteen feet.  We saw the damp, dismal cells in which two of Dumas'\r\nheroes passed their confinement--heroes of \xe2\x80\x9cMonte Cristo.\xe2\x80\x9d  It was here\r\nthat the brave Abbe wrote a book with his own blood, with a pen made of a\r\npiece of iron hoop, and by the light of a lamp made out of shreds of\r\ncloth soaked in grease obtained from his food; and then dug through the\r\nthick wall with some trifling instrument which he wrought himself out of\r\na stray piece of iron or table cutlery and freed Dantes from his chains.\r\nIt was a pity that so many weeks of dreary labor should have come to\r\nnaught at last.\r\n\r\nThey showed us the noisome cell where the celebrated \xe2\x80\x9cIron Mask\xe2\x80\x9d--that\r\nill-starred brother of a hardhearted king of France--was confined for a\r\nseason before he was sent to hide the strange mystery of his life from\r\nthe curious in the dungeons of Ste. Marguerite.  The place had a far\r\ngreater interest for us than it could have had if we had known beyond all\r\nquestion who the Iron Mask was, and what his history had been, and why\r\nthis most unusual punishment had been meted out to him.  Mystery!  That\r\nwas the charm.  That speechless tongue, those prisoned features, that\r\nheart so freighted with unspoken troubles, and that breast so oppressed\r\nwith its piteous secret had been here.  These dank walls had known the\r\nman whose dolorous story is a sealed book forever!  There was fascination\r\nin the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nWe have come five hundred miles by rail through the heart of France.\r\nWhat a bewitching land it is!  What a garden!  Surely the leagues of\r\nbright green lawns are swept and brushed and watered every day and their\r\ngrasses trimmed by the barber.  Surely the hedges are shaped and measured\r\nand their symmetry preserved by the most architectural of gardeners.\r\nSurely the long straight rows of stately poplars that divide the\r\nbeautiful landscape like the squares of a checker-board are set with line\r\nand plummet, and their uniform height determined with a spirit level.\r\nSurely the straight, smooth, pure white turnpikes are jack-planed and\r\nsandpapered every day.  How else are these marvels of symmetry,\r\ncleanliness, and order attained?  It is wonderful.  There are no\r\nunsightly stone walls and never a fence of any kind.  There is no dirt,\r\nno decay, no rubbish anywhere--nothing that even hints at untidiness\r\n--nothing that ever suggests neglect.  All is orderly and beautiful--every\r\nthing is charming to the eye.\r\n\r\nWe had such glimpses of the Rhone gliding along between its grassy banks;\r\nof cosy cottages buried in flowers and shrubbery; of quaint old red-tiled\r\nvillages with mossy medieval cathedrals looming out of their midst; of\r\nwooded hills with ivy-grown towers and turrets of feudal castles\r\nprojecting above the foliage; such glimpses of Paradise, it seemed to us,\r\nsuch visions of fabled fairyland!\r\n\r\nWe knew then what the poet meant when he sang of:  \xe2\x80\x9c--thy cornfields\r\ngreen, and sunny vines,  O pleasant land of France!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd it is a pleasant land.  No word describes it so felicitously as that\r\none.  They say there is no word for \xe2\x80\x9chome\xe2\x80\x9d in the French language.  Well,\r\nconsidering that they have the article itself in such an attractive\r\naspect, they ought to manage to get along without the word.  Let us not\r\nwaste too much pity on \xe2\x80\x9chomeless\xe2\x80\x9d France.  I have observed that Frenchmen\r\nabroad seldom wholly give up the idea of going back to France some time\r\nor other.  I am not surprised at it now.\r\n\r\nWe are not infatuated with these French railway cars, though.  We took\r\nfirst-class passage, not because we wished to attract attention by doing\r\na thing which is uncommon in Europe but because we could make our journey\r\nquicker by so doing.  It is hard to make railroading pleasant in any\r\ncountry.  It is too tedious.  Stagecoaching is infinitely more\r\ndelightful.  Once I crossed the plains and deserts and mountains of the\r\nWest in a stagecoach, from the Missouri line to California, and since\r\nthen all my pleasure trips must be measured to that rare holiday frolic.\r\nTwo thousand miles of ceaseless rush and rattle and clatter, by night and\r\nby day, and never a weary moment, never a lapse of interest!  The first\r\nseven hundred miles a level continent, its grassy carpet greener and\r\nsofter and smoother than any sea and figured with designs fitted to its\r\nmagnitude--the shadows of the clouds.  Here were no scenes but summer\r\nscenes, and no disposition inspired by them but to lie at full length on\r\nthe mail sacks in the grateful breeze and dreamily smoke the pipe of\r\npeace--what other, where all was repose and contentment?  In cool\r\nmornings, before the sun was fairly up, it was worth a lifetime of city\r\ntoiling and moiling to perch in the foretop with the driver and see the\r\nsix mustangs scamper under the sharp snapping of the whip that never\r\ntouched them; to scan the blue distances of a world that knew no lords\r\nbut us; to cleave the wind with uncovered head and feel the sluggish\r\npulses rousing to the spirit of a speed that pretended to the resistless\r\nrush of a typhoon!  Then thirteen hundred miles of desert solitudes; of\r\nlimitless panoramas of bewildering perspective; of mimic cities, of\r\npinnacled cathedrals, of massive fortresses, counterfeited in the eternal\r\nrocks and splendid with the crimson and gold of the setting sun; of dizzy\r\naltitudes among fog-wreathed peaks and never-melting snows, where\r\nthunders and lightnings and tempests warred magnificently at our feet and\r\nthe storm clouds above swung their shredded banners in our very faces!\r\nBut I forgot.  I am in elegant France now, and not scurrying through the\r\ngreat South Pass and the Wind River Mountains, among antelopes and\r\nbuffaloes and painted Indians on the warpath.  It is not meet that I\r\nshould make too disparaging comparisons between humdrum travel on a\r\nrailway and that royal summer flight across a continent in a stagecoach.\r\nI meant in the beginning to say that railway journeying is tedious and\r\ntiresome, and so it is--though at the time I was thinking particularly of\r\na dismal fifty-hour pilgrimage between New York and St. Louis.  Of course\r\nour trip through France was not really tedious because all its scenes and\r\nexperiences were new and strange; but as Dan says, it had its\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdiscrepancies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cars are built in compartments that hold eight persons each.  Each\r\ncompartment is partially subdivided, and so there are two tolerably\r\ndistinct parties of four in it.  Four face the other four.  The seats and\r\nbacks are thickly padded and cushioned and are very comfortable; you can\r\nsmoke if you wish; there are no bothersome peddlers; you are saved the\r\ninfliction of a multitude of disagreeable fellow passengers.  So far, so\r\nwell.  But then the conductor locks you in when the train starts; there\r\nis no water to drink in the car; there is no heating apparatus for night\r\ntravel; if a drunken rowdy should get in, you could not remove a matter\r\nof twenty seats from him or enter another car; but above all, if you are\r\nworn out and must sleep, you must sit up and do it in naps, with cramped\r\nlegs and in a torturing misery that leaves you withered and lifeless the\r\nnext day--for behold they have not that culmination of all charity and\r\nhuman kindness, a sleeping car, in all France.  I prefer the American\r\nsystem.  It has not so many grievous \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrepancies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn France, all is clockwork, all is order.  They make no mistakes.  Every\r\nthird man wears a uniform, and whether he be a marshal of the empire or a\r\nbrakeman, he is ready and perfectly willing to answer all your questions\r\nwith tireless politeness, ready to tell you which car to take, yea, and\r\nready to go and put you into it to make sure that you shall not go\r\nastray.  You cannot pass into the waiting room of the depot till you have\r\nsecured your ticket, and you cannot pass from its only exit till the\r\ntrain is at its threshold to receive you.  Once on board, the train will\r\nnot start till your ticket has been examined--till every passenger's\r\nticket has been inspected.  This is chiefly for your own good.  If by any\r\npossibility you have managed to take the wrong train, you will be handed\r\nover to a polite official who will take you whither you belong and bestow\r\nyou with many an affable bow.  Your ticket will be inspected every now\r\nand then along the route, and when it is time to change cars you will\r\nknow it.  You are in the hands of officials who zealously study your\r\nwelfare and your interest, instead of turning their talents to the\r\ninvention of new methods of discommoding and snubbing you, as is very\r\noften the main employment of that exceedingly self-satisfied monarch, the\r\nrailroad conductor of America.\r\n\r\nBut the happiest regulation in French railway government is--thirty\r\nminutes to dinner!  No five-minute boltings of flabby rolls, muddy\r\ncoffee, questionable eggs, gutta-percha beef, and pies whose conception\r\nand execution are a dark and bloody mystery to all save the cook that\r\ncreated them!  No, we sat calmly down--it was in old Dijon, which is so\r\neasy to spell and so impossible to pronounce except when you civilize it\r\nand call it Demijohn--and poured out rich Burgundian wines and munched\r\ncalmly through a long table d'hote bill of fare, snail patties, delicious\r\nfruits and all, then paid the trifle it cost and stepped happily aboard\r\nthe train again, without once cursing the railroad company.  A rare\r\nexperience and one to be treasured forever.\r\n\r\nThey say they do not have accidents on these French roads, and I think it\r\nmust be true.  If I remember rightly, we passed high above wagon roads or\r\nthrough tunnels under them, but never crossed them on their own level.\r\nAbout every quarter of a mile, it seemed to me, a man came out and held\r\nup a club till the train went by, to signify that everything was safe\r\nahead.  Switches were changed a mile in advance by pulling a wire rope\r\nthat passed along the ground by the rail, from station to station.\r\nSignals for the day and signals for the night gave constant and timely\r\nnotice of the position of switches.\r\n\r\nNo, they have no railroad accidents to speak of in France.  But why?\r\nBecause when one occurs, somebody has to hang for it!  Not hang, maybe,\r\nbut be punished at least with such vigor of emphasis as to make\r\nnegligence a thing to be shuddered at by railroad officials for many a\r\nday thereafter.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo blame attached to the officers\xe2\x80\x9d--that lying and\r\ndisaster-breeding verdict so common to our softhearted juries is seldom\r\nrendered in France.  If the trouble occurred in the conductor's\r\ndepartment, that officer must suffer if his subordinate cannot be proven\r\nguilty; if in the engineer's department and the case be similar, the\r\nengineer must answer.\r\n\r\nThe Old Travelers--those delightful parrots who have \xe2\x80\x9cbeen here before\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and know more about the country than Louis Napoleon knows now or ever\r\nwill know--tell us these things, and we believe them because they are\r\npleasant things to believe and because they are plausible and savor of\r\nthe rigid subjection to law and order which we behold about us\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nBut we love the Old Travelers.  We love to hear them prate and drivel and\r\nlie.  We can tell them the moment we see them.  They always throw out a\r\nfew feelers; they never cast themselves adrift till they have sounded\r\nevery individual and know that he has not traveled.  Then they open their\r\nthrottle valves, and how they do brag, and sneer, and swell, and soar,\r\nand blaspheme the sacred name of Truth!  Their central idea, their grand\r\naim, is to subjugate you, keep you down, make you feel insignificant and\r\nhumble in the blaze of their cosmopolitan glory!  They will not let you\r\nknow anything.  They sneer at your most inoffensive suggestions; they\r\nlaugh unfeelingly at your treasured dreams of foreign lands; they brand\r\nthe statements of your traveled aunts and uncles as the stupidest\r\nabsurdities; they deride your most trusted authors and demolish the fair\r\nimages they have set up for your willing worship with the pitiless\r\nferocity of the fanatic iconoclast!  But still I love the Old Travelers.\r\nI love them for their witless platitudes, for their supernatural ability\r\nto bore, for their delightful asinine vanity, for their luxuriant\r\nfertility of imagination, for their startling, their brilliant, their\r\noverwhelming mendacity!\r\n\r\nBy Lyons and the Saone (where we saw the lady of Lyons and thought little\r\nof her comeliness), by Villa Franca, Tonnere, venerable Sens, Melun,\r\nFontainebleau, and scores of other beautiful cities, we swept, always\r\nnoting the absence of hog-wallows, broken fences, cow lots, unpainted\r\nhouses, and mud, and always noting, as well, the presence of cleanliness,\r\ngrace, taste in adorning and beautifying, even to the disposition of a\r\ntree or the turning of a hedge, the marvel of roads in perfect repair,\r\nvoid of ruts and guiltless of even an inequality of surface--we bowled\r\nalong, hour after hour, that brilliant summer day, and as nightfall\r\napproached we entered a wilderness of odorous flowers and shrubbery, sped\r\nthrough it, and then, excited, delighted, and half persuaded that we were\r\nonly the sport of a beautiful dream, lo, we stood in magnificent Paris!\r\n\r\nWhat excellent order they kept about that vast depot!  There was no\r\nfrantic crowding and jostling, no shouting and swearing, and no\r\nswaggering intrusion of services by rowdy hackmen.  These latter gentry\r\nstood outside--stood quietly by their long line of vehicles and said\r\nnever a word.  A kind of hackman general seemed to have the whole matter\r\nof transportation in his hands.  He politely received the passengers and\r\nushered them to the kind of conveyance they wanted, and told the driver\r\nwhere to deliver them.  There was no \xe2\x80\x9ctalking back,\xe2\x80\x9d no dissatisfaction\r\nabout overcharging, no grumbling about anything.  In a little while we\r\nwere speeding through the streets of Paris and delightfully recognizing\r\ncertain names and places with which books had long ago made us familiar.\r\nIt was like meeting an old friend when we read Rue de Rivoli on the\r\nstreet corner; we knew the genuine vast palace of the Louvre as well as\r\nwe knew its picture; when we passed by the Column of July we needed no\r\none to tell us what it was or to remind us that on its site once stood\r\nthe grim Bastille, that grave of human hopes and happiness, that dismal\r\nprison house within whose dungeons so many young faces put on the\r\nwrinkles of age, so many proud spirits grew humble, so many brave hearts\r\nbroke.\r\n\r\nWe secured rooms at the hotel, or rather, we had three beds put into one\r\nroom, so that we might be together, and then we went out to a restaurant,\r\njust after lamplighting, and ate a comfortable, satisfactory, lingering\r\ndinner.  It was a pleasure to eat where everything was so tidy, the food\r\nso well cooked, the waiters so polite, and the coming and departing\r\ncompany so moustached, so frisky, so affable, so fearfully and\r\nwonderfully Frenchy!  All the surroundings were gay and enlivening.  Two\r\nhundred people sat at little tables on the sidewalk, sipping wine and\r\ncoffee; the streets were thronged with light vehicles and with joyous\r\npleasure-seekers; there was music in the air, life and action all about\r\nus, and a conflagration of gaslight everywhere!\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we felt like seeing such Parisian specialties as we might\r\nsee without distressing exertion, and so we sauntered through the\r\nbrilliant streets and looked at the dainty trifles in variety stores and\r\njewelry shops.  Occasionally, merely for the pleasure of being cruel, we\r\nput unoffending Frenchmen on the rack with questions framed in the\r\nincomprehensible jargon of their native language, and while they writhed\r\nwe impaled them, we peppered them, we scarified them, with their own vile\r\nverbs and participles.\r\n\r\nWe noticed that in the jewelry stores they had some of the articles\r\nmarked \xe2\x80\x9cgold\xe2\x80\x9d and some labeled \xe2\x80\x9cimitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  We wondered at this\r\nextravagance of honesty and inquired into the matter.  We were informed\r\nthat inasmuch as most people are not able to tell false gold from the\r\ngenuine article, the government compels jewelers to have their gold work\r\nassayed and stamped officially according to its fineness and their\r\nimitation work duly labeled with the sign of its falsity.  They told us\r\nthe jewelers would not dare to violate this law, and that whatever a\r\nstranger bought in one of their stores might be depended upon as being\r\nstrictly what it was represented to be.  Verily, a wonderful land is\r\nFrance!\r\n\r\nThen we hunted for a barber-shop.  From earliest infancy it had been\r\na cherished ambition of mine to be shaved some day in a palatial\r\nbarber-shop in Paris.  I wished to recline at full length in a cushioned\r\ninvalid chair, with pictures about me and sumptuous furniture; with\r\nfrescoed walls and gilded arches above me and vistas of Corinthian\r\ncolumns stretching far before me; with perfumes of Araby to intoxicate\r\nmy senses and the slumbrous drone of distant noises to soothe me to\r\nsleep.  At the end of an hour I would wake up regretfully and find my\r\nface as smooth and as soft as an infant's.  Departing, I would lift my\r\nhands above that barber's head and say, \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven bless you, my son!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo we searched high and low, for a matter of two hours, but never a\r\nbarber-shop could we see.  We saw only wig-making establishments, with\r\nshocks of dead and repulsive hair bound upon the heads of painted waxen\r\nbrigands who stared out from glass boxes upon the passer-by with their\r\nstony eyes and scared him with the ghostly white of their countenances.\r\nWe shunned these signs for a time, but finally we concluded that the\r\nwig-makers must of necessity be the barbers as well, since we could find\r\nno single legitimate representative of the fraternity.  We entered and\r\nasked, and found that it was even so.\r\n\r\nI said I wanted to be shaved.  The barber inquired where my room was.  I\r\nsaid never mind where my room was, I wanted to be shaved--there, on the\r\nspot.  The doctor said he would be shaved also.  Then there was an\r\nexcitement among those two barbers!  There was a wild consultation, and\r\nafterwards a hurrying to and fro and a feverish gathering up of razors\r\nfrom obscure places and a ransacking for soap.  Next they took us into a\r\nlittle mean, shabby back room; they got two ordinary sitting-room chairs\r\nand placed us in them with our coats on.  My old, old dream of bliss\r\nvanished into thin air!\r\n\r\nI sat bolt upright, silent, sad, and solemn.  One of the wig-making\r\nvillains lathered my face for ten terrible minutes and finished by\r\nplastering a mass of suds into my mouth.  I expelled the nasty stuff with\r\na strong English expletive and said, \xe2\x80\x9cForeigner, beware!\xe2\x80\x9d  Then this\r\noutlaw strapped his razor on his boot, hovered over me ominously for six\r\nfearful seconds, and then swooped down upon me like the genius of\r\ndestruction.  The first rake of his razor loosened the very hide from my\r\nface and lifted me out of the chair.  I stormed and raved, and the other\r\nboys enjoyed it.  Their beards are not strong and thick.  Let us draw the\r\ncurtain over this harrowing scene.\r\n\r\nSuffice it that I submitted and went through with the cruel infliction of\r\na shave by a French barber; tears of exquisite agony coursed down my\r\ncheeks now and then, but I survived.  Then the incipient assassin held a\r\nbasin of water under my chin and slopped its contents over my face, and\r\ninto my bosom, and down the back of my neck, with a mean pretense of\r\nwashing away the soap and blood.  He dried my features with a towel and\r\nwas going to comb my hair, but I asked to be excused.  I said, with\r\nwithering irony, that it was sufficient to be skinned--I declined to be\r\nscalped.\r\n\r\nI went away from there with my handkerchief about my face, and never,\r\nnever, never desired to dream of palatial Parisian barber-shops anymore.\r\nThe truth is, as I believe I have since found out, that they have no\r\nbarber shops worthy of the name in Paris--and no barbers, either, for\r\nthat matter.  The impostor who does duty as a barber brings his pans and\r\nnapkins and implements of torture to your residence and deliberately\r\nskins you in your private apartments.  Ah, I have suffered, suffered,\r\nsuffered, here in Paris, but never mind--the time is coming when I shall\r\nhave a dark and bloody revenge.  Someday a Parisian barber will come to\r\nmy room to skin me, and from that day forth that barber will never be\r\nheard of more.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock we alighted upon a sign which manifestly referred to\r\nbilliards.  Joy!  We had played billiards in the Azores with balls that\r\nwere not round and on an ancient table that was very little smoother than\r\na brick pavement--one of those wretched old things with dead cushions,\r\nand with patches in the faded cloth and invisible obstructions that made\r\nthe balls describe the most astonishing and unsuspected angles and\r\nperform feats in the way of unlooked-for and almost impossible\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cscratches\xe2\x80\x9d that were perfectly bewildering.  We had played at Gibraltar\r\nwith balls the size of a walnut, on a table like a public square--and in\r\nboth instances we achieved far more aggravation than amusement.  We\r\nexpected to fare better here, but we were mistaken.  The cushions were a\r\ngood deal higher than the balls, and as the balls had a fashion of always\r\nstopping under the cushions, we accomplished very little in the way of\r\ncaroms.  The cushions were hard and unelastic, and the cues were so\r\ncrooked that in making a shot you had to allow for the curve or you would\r\ninfallibly put the \xe2\x80\x9cEnglish\xe2\x80\x9d on the wrong side of the ball.  Dan was to\r\nmark while the doctor and I played.  At the end of an hour neither of us\r\nhad made a count, and so Dan was tired of keeping tally with nothing to\r\ntally, and we were heated and angry and disgusted.  We paid the heavy\r\nbill--about six cents--and said we would call around sometime when we had\r\na week to spend, and finish the game.\r\n\r\nWe adjourned to one of those pretty cafes and took supper and tested the\r\nwines of the country, as we had been instructed to do, and found them\r\nharmless and unexciting.  They might have been exciting, however, if we\r\nhad chosen to drink a sufficiency of them.\r\n\r\nTo close our first day in Paris cheerfully and pleasantly, we now sought\r\nour grand room in the Grand Hotel du Louvre and climbed into our\r\nsumptuous bed to read and smoke--but alas!\r\n\r\n          It was pitiful,\r\n          In a whole city-full,\r\n          Gas we had none.\r\n\r\nNo gas to read by--nothing but dismal candles.  It was a shame.  We tried\r\nto map out excursions for the morrow; we puzzled over French \xe2\x80\x9cguides to\r\nParis\xe2\x80\x9d; we talked disjointedly in a vain endeavor to make head or tail of\r\nthe wild chaos of the day's sights and experiences; we subsided to\r\nindolent smoking; we gaped and yawned and stretched--then feebly wondered\r\nif we were really and truly in renowned Paris, and drifted drowsily away\r\ninto that vast mysterious void which men call sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we were up and dressed at ten o'clock.  We went to the\r\n'commissionaire' of the hotel--I don't know what a 'commissionaire' is,\r\nbut that is the man we went to--and told him we wanted a guide.  He said\r\nthe national Exposition had drawn such multitudes of Englishmen and\r\nAmericans to Paris that it would be next to impossible to find a good\r\nguide unemployed.  He said he usually kept a dozen or two on hand, but he\r\nonly had three now.  He called them.  One looked so like a very pirate\r\nthat we let him go at once.  The next one spoke with a simpering\r\nprecision of pronunciation that was irritating and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf ze zhentlemans will to me make ze grande honneur to me rattain in\r\nhees serveece, I shall show to him every sing zat is magnifique to look\r\nupon in ze beautiful Parree.  I speaky ze Angleesh pairfaitemaw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would have done well to have stopped there, because he had that much\r\nby heart and said it right off without making a mistake.  But his\r\nself-complacency seduced him into attempting a flight into regions of\r\nunexplored English, and the reckless experiment was his ruin.  Within ten\r\nseconds he was so tangled up in a maze of mutilated verbs and torn and\r\nbleeding forms of speech that no human ingenuity could ever have gotten\r\nhim out of it with credit.  It was plain enough that he could not\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cspeaky\xe2\x80\x9d the English quite as \xe2\x80\x9cpairfaitemaw\xe2\x80\x9d as he had pretended he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nThe third man captured us.  He was plainly dressed, but he had a\r\nnoticeable air of neatness about him.  He wore a high silk hat which was\r\na little old, but had been carefully brushed.  He wore second-hand kid\r\ngloves, in good repair, and carried a small rattan cane with a curved\r\nhandle--a female leg--of ivory.  He stepped as gently and as daintily as\r\na cat crossing a muddy street; and oh, he was urbanity; he was quiet,\r\nunobtrusive self-possession; he was deference itself!  He spoke softly\r\nand guardedly; and when he was about to make a statement on his sole\r\nresponsibility or offer a suggestion, he weighed it by drachms and\r\nscruples first, with the crook of his little stick placed meditatively to\r\nhis teeth.  His opening speech was perfect.  It was perfect in\r\nconstruction, in phraseology, in grammar, in emphasis, in pronunciation\r\n--everything.  He spoke little and guardedly after that.  We were charmed.\r\nWe were more than charmed--we were overjoyed.  We hired him at once.  We\r\nnever even asked him his price.  This man--our lackey, our servant, our\r\nunquestioning slave though he was--was still a gentleman--we could see\r\nthat--while of the other two one was coarse and awkward and the other was\r\na born pirate.  We asked our man Friday's name.  He drew from his\r\npocketbook a snowy little card and passed it to us with a profound bow:\r\n\r\n                             A. BILLFINGER,\r\n                    Guide to Paris, France, Germany,\r\n                            Spain, &c., &c.\r\n                       Grande Hotel du Louvre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBillfinger!  Oh, carry me home to die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was an \xe2\x80\x9caside\xe2\x80\x9d from Dan.  The atrocious name grated harshly on my\r\near, too.  The most of us can learn to forgive, and even to like, a\r\ncountenance that strikes us unpleasantly at first, but few of us, I\r\nfancy, become reconciled to a jarring name so easily.  I was almost sorry\r\nwe had hired this man, his name was so unbearable.  However, no matter.\r\nWe were impatient to start.  Billfinger stepped to the door to call a\r\ncarriage, and then the doctor said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the guide goes with the barbershop, with the billiard-table, with\r\nthe gasless room, and may be with many another pretty romance of Paris.\r\nI expected to have a guide named Henri de Montmorency, or Armand de la\r\nChartreuse, or something that would sound grand in letters to the\r\nvillagers at home, but to think of a Frenchman by the name of Billfinger!\r\nOh!  This is absurd, you know.  This will never do.  We can't say\r\nBillfinger; it is nauseating.  Name him over again; what had we better\r\ncall him?  Alexis du Caulaincourt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlphonse Henri Gustave de Hauteville,\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall him Ferguson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan.\r\n\r\nThat was practical, unromantic good sense.  Without debate, we expunged\r\nBillfinger as Billfinger, and called him Ferguson.\r\n\r\nThe carriage--an open barouche--was ready.  Ferguson mounted beside the\r\ndriver, and we whirled away to breakfast.  As was proper, Mr. Ferguson\r\nstood by to transmit our orders and answer questions.  By and by, he\r\nmentioned casually--the artful adventurer--that he would go and get his\r\nbreakfast as soon as we had finished ours.  He knew we could not get\r\nalong without him and that we would not want to loiter about and wait for\r\nhim.  We asked him to sit down and eat with us.  He begged, with many a\r\nbow, to be excused.  It was not proper, he said; he would sit at another\r\ntable.  We ordered him peremptorily to sit down with us.\r\n\r\nHere endeth the first lesson.  It was a mistake.\r\n\r\nAs long as we had that fellow after that, he was always hungry; he was\r\nalways thirsty.  He came early; he stayed late; he could not pass a\r\nrestaurant; he looked with a lecherous eye upon every wine shop.\r\nSuggestions to stop, excuses to eat and to drink, were forever on his\r\nlips.  We tried all we could to fill him so full that he would have no\r\nroom to spare for a fortnight, but it was a failure.  He did not hold\r\nenough to smother the cravings of his superhuman appetite.\r\n\r\nHe had another \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrepancy\xe2\x80\x9d about him.  He was always wanting us to buy\r\nthings.  On the shallowest pretenses he would inveigle us into shirt\r\nstores, boot stores, tailor shops, glove shops--anywhere under the broad\r\nsweep of the heavens that there seemed a chance of our buying anything.\r\nAnyone could have guessed that the shopkeepers paid him a percentage on\r\nthe sales, but in our blessed innocence we didn't until this feature of\r\nhis conduct grew unbearably prominent.  One day Dan happened to mention\r\nthat he thought of buying three or four silk dress patterns for presents.\r\nFerguson's hungry eye was upon him in an instant.  In the course of\r\ntwenty minutes the carriage stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZis is ze finest silk magazin in Paris--ze most celebrate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you come here for?  We told you to take us to the palace of the\r\nLouvre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose ze gentleman say he wish to buy some silk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not required to 'suppose' things for the party, Ferguson.  We do\r\nnot wish to tax your energies too much.  We will bear some of the burden\r\nand heat of the day ourselves.  We will endeavor to do such 'supposing'\r\nas is really necessary to be done.  Drive on.\xe2\x80\x9d  So spake the doctor.\r\n\r\nWithin fifteen minutes the carriage halted again, and before another silk\r\nstore.  The doctor said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the palace of the Louvre--beautiful, beautiful edifice!  Does the\r\nEmperor Napoleon live here now, Ferguson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Doctor!  You do jest; zis is not ze palace; we come there directly.\r\nBut since we pass right by zis store, where is such beautiful silk--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!  I see, I see.  I meant to have told you that we did not wish to\r\npurchase any silks to-day, but in my absent-mindedness I forgot it.  I\r\nalso meant to tell you we wished to go directly to the Louvre, but I\r\nforgot that also.  However, we will go there now.  Pardon my seeming\r\ncarelessness, Ferguson.  Drive on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithin the half hour we stopped again--in front of another silk store.\r\nWe were angry; but the doctor was always serene, always smooth-voiced.\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last!  How imposing the Louvre is, and yet how small!  How\r\nexquisitely fashioned!  How charmingly situated!--Venerable, venerable\r\npile--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPairdon, Doctor, zis is not ze Louvre--it is--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have ze idea--it come to me in a moment--zat ze silk in zis magazin--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFerguson, how heedless I am.  I fully intended to tell you that we did\r\nnot wish to buy any silks to-day, and I also intended to tell you that we\r\nyearned to go immediately to the palace of the Louvre, but enjoying the\r\nhappiness of seeing you devour four breakfasts this morning has so filled\r\nme with pleasurable emotions that I neglect the commonest interests of\r\nthe time.  However, we will proceed now to the Louvre, Ferguson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d (excitedly,) \xe2\x80\x9cit will take not a minute--not but one small\r\nminute!  Ze gentleman need not to buy if he not wish to--but only look at\r\nze silk--look at ze beautiful fabric.  [Then pleadingly.] Sair--just only\r\none leetle moment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan said, \xe2\x80\x9cConfound the idiot!  I don't want to see any silks today, and\r\nI won't look at them.  Drive on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the doctor: \xe2\x80\x9cWe need no silks now, Ferguson.  Our hearts yearn for\r\nthe Louvre.  Let us journey on--let us journey on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut doctor!  It is only one moment--one leetle moment.  And ze time will\r\nbe save--entirely save!  Because zere is nothing to see now--it is too\r\nlate.  It want ten minute to four and ze Louvre close at four--only one\r\nleetle moment, Doctor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe treacherous miscreant!  After four breakfasts and a gallon of\r\nchampagne, to serve us such a scurvy trick.  We got no sight of the\r\ncountless treasures of art in the Louvre galleries that day, and our only\r\npoor little satisfaction was in the reflection that Ferguson sold not a\r\nsolitary silk dress pattern.\r\n\r\nI am writing this chapter partly for the satisfaction of abusing that\r\naccomplished knave Billfinger, and partly to show whosoever shall read\r\nthis how Americans fare at the hands of the Paris guides and what sort of\r\npeople Paris guides are.  It need not be supposed that we were a stupider\r\nor an easier prey than our countrymen generally are, for we were not.\r\nThe guides deceive and defraud every American who goes to Paris for the\r\nfirst time and sees its sights alone or in company with others as little\r\nexperienced as himself.  I shall visit Paris again someday, and then let\r\nthe guides beware!  I shall go in my war paint--I shall carry my tomahawk\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nI think we have lost but little time in Paris.  We have gone to bed every\r\nnight tired out.  Of course we visited the renowned International\r\nExposition.  All the world did that.  We went there on our third day in\r\nParis--and we stayed there nearly two hours.  That was our first and last\r\nvisit.  To tell the truth, we saw at a glance that one would have to\r\nspend weeks--yea, even months--in that monstrous establishment to get an\r\nintelligible idea of it.  It was a wonderful show, but the moving masses\r\nof people of all nations we saw there were a still more wonderful show.\r\nI discovered that if I were to stay there a month, I should still find\r\nmyself looking at the people instead of the inanimate objects on\r\nexhibition.  I got a little interested in some curious old tapestries of\r\nthe thirteenth century, but a party of Arabs came by, and their dusky\r\nfaces and quaint costumes called my attention away at once.  I watched a\r\nsilver swan, which had a living grace about his movements and a living\r\nintelligence in his eyes--watched him swimming about as comfortably and\r\nas unconcernedly as if he had been born in a morass instead of a\r\njeweler's shop--watched him seize a silver fish from under the water and\r\nhold up his head and go through all the customary and elaborate motions\r\nof swallowing it--but the moment it disappeared down his throat some\r\ntattooed South Sea Islanders approached and I yielded to their\r\nattractions.\r\n\r\nPresently I found a revolving pistol several hundred years old which\r\nlooked strangely like a modern Colt, but just then I heard that the\r\nEmpress of the French was in another part of the building, and hastened\r\naway to see what she might look like.  We heard martial music--we saw an\r\nunusual number of soldiers walking hurriedly about--there was a general\r\nmovement among the people.  We inquired what it was all about and learned\r\nthat the Emperor of the French and the Sultan of Turkey were about to\r\nreview twenty-five thousand troops at the Arc de l'Etoile.  We\r\nimmediately departed.  I had a greater anxiety to see these men than I\r\ncould have had to see twenty expositions.\r\n\r\nWe drove away and took up a position in an open space opposite the\r\nAmerican minister's house.  A speculator bridged a couple of barrels with\r\na board and we hired standing places on it.  Presently there was a sound\r\nof distant music; in another minute a pillar of dust came moving slowly\r\ntoward us; a moment more and then, with colors flying and a grand crash\r\nof military music, a gallant array of cavalrymen emerged from the dust\r\nand came down the street on a gentle trot.  After them came a long line\r\nof artillery; then more cavalry, in splendid uniforms; and then their\r\nimperial majesties Napoleon III and Abdul Aziz.  The vast concourse of\r\npeople swung their hats and shouted--the windows and housetops in the\r\nwide vicinity burst into a snowstorm of waving handkerchiefs, and the\r\nwavers of the same mingled their cheers with those of the masses below.\r\nIt was a stirring spectacle.\r\n\r\nBut the two central figures claimed all my attention.  Was ever such a\r\ncontrast set up before a multitude till then?  Napoleon in military\r\nuniform--a long-bodied, short-legged man, fiercely moustached, old,\r\nwrinkled, with eyes half closed, and such a deep, crafty, scheming\r\nexpression about them!--Napoleon, bowing ever so gently to the loud\r\nplaudits, and watching everything and everybody with his cat eyes from\r\nunder his depressed hat brim, as if to discover any sign that those\r\ncheers were not heartfelt and cordial.\r\n\r\nAbdul Aziz, absolute lord of the Ottoman empire--clad in dark green\r\nEuropean clothes, almost without ornament or insignia of rank; a red\r\nTurkish fez on his head; a short, stout, dark man, black-bearded,\r\nblack-eyed, stupid, unprepossessing--a man whose whole appearance\r\nsomehow suggested that if he only had a cleaver in his hand and a white\r\napron on, one would not be at all surprised to hear him say: \xe2\x80\x9cA mutton\r\nroast today, or will you have a nice porterhouse steak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNapoleon III, the representative of the highest modern civilization,\r\nprogress, and refinement; Abdul-Aziz, the representative of a people by\r\nnature and training filthy, brutish, ignorant, unprogressive,\r\nsuperstitious--and a government whose Three Graces are Tyranny, Rapacity,\r\nBlood.  Here in brilliant Paris, under this majestic Arch of Triumph, the\r\nFirst Century greets the Nineteenth!\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON III., Emperor of France!  Surrounded by shouting thousands, by\r\nmilitary pomp, by the splendors of his capital city, and companioned by\r\nkings and princes--this is the man who was sneered at and reviled and\r\ncalled Bastard--yet who was dreaming of a crown and an empire all the\r\nwhile; who was driven into exile--but carried his dreams with him; who\r\nassociated with the common herd in America and ran foot races for a\r\nwager--but still sat upon a throne in fancy; who braved every danger to\r\ngo to his dying mother--and grieved that she could not be spared to see\r\nhim cast aside his plebeian vestments for the purple of royalty; who kept\r\nhis faithful watch and walked his weary beat a common policeman of\r\nLondon--but dreamed the while of a coming night when he should tread the\r\nlong-drawn corridors of the Tuileries; who made the miserable fiasco of\r\nStrasbourg; saw his poor, shabby eagle, forgetful of its lesson, refuse\r\nto perch upon his shoulder; delivered his carefully prepared, sententious\r\nburst of eloquence upon unsympathetic ears; found himself a prisoner, the\r\nbutt of small wits, a mark for the pitiless ridicule of all the world\r\n--yet went on dreaming of coronations and splendid pageants as before; who\r\nlay a forgotten captive in the dungeons of Ham--and still schemed and\r\nplanned and pondered over future glory and future power; President of\r\nFrance at last! a coup d'etat, and surrounded by applauding armies,\r\nwelcomed by the thunders of cannon, he mounts a throne and waves before\r\nan astounded world the sceptre of a mighty empire!  Who talks of the\r\nmarvels of fiction?  Who speaks of the wonders of romance?  Who prates of\r\nthe tame achievements of Aladdin and the Magii of Arabia?\r\n\r\nABDUL-AZIZ, Sultan of Turkey, Lord of the Ottoman Empire!  Born to a\r\nthrone; weak, stupid, ignorant, almost, as his meanest slave; chief of a\r\nvast royalty, yet the puppet of his Premier and the obedient child of a\r\ntyrannical mother; a man who sits upon a throne--the beck of whose finger\r\nmoves navies and armies--who holds in his hands the power of life and\r\ndeath over millions--yet who sleeps, sleeps, eats, eats, idles with his\r\neight hundred concubines, and when he is surfeited with eating and\r\nsleeping and idling, and would rouse up and take the reins of government\r\nand threaten to be a sultan, is charmed from his purpose by wary Fuad\r\nPacha with a pretty plan for a new palace or a new ship--charmed away\r\nwith a new toy, like any other restless child; a man who sees his people\r\nrobbed and oppressed by soulless tax-gatherers, but speaks no word to\r\nsave them; who believes in gnomes and genii and the wild fables of The\r\nArabian Nights, but has small regard for the mighty magicians of to-day,\r\nand is nervous in the presence of their mysterious railroads and\r\nsteamboats and telegraphs; who would see undone in Egypt all that great\r\nMehemet Ali achieved, and would prefer rather to forget than emulate him;\r\na man who found his great empire a blot upon the earth--a degraded,\r\npoverty-stricken, miserable, infamous agglomeration of ignorance, crime,\r\nand brutality--and will idle away the allotted days of his trivial life\r\nand then pass to the dust and the worms and leave it so!\r\n\r\nNapoleon has augmented the commercial prosperity of France in ten years\r\nto such a degree that figures can hardly compute it.  He has rebuilt\r\nParis and has partly rebuilt every city in the state.  He condemns a\r\nwhole street at a time, assesses the damages, pays them, and rebuilds\r\nsuperbly.  Then speculators buy up the ground and sell, but the original\r\nowner is given the first choice by the government at a stated price\r\nbefore the speculator is permitted to purchase.  But above all things, he\r\nhas taken the sole control of the empire of France into his hands and\r\nmade it a tolerably free land--for people who will not attempt to go too\r\nfar in meddling with government affairs.  No country offers greater\r\nsecurity to life and property than France, and one has all the freedom he\r\nwants, but no license--no license to interfere with anybody or make\r\nanyone uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nAs for the Sultan, one could set a trap any where and catch a dozen abler\r\nmen in a night.\r\n\r\nThe bands struck up, and the brilliant adventurer, Napoleon III., the\r\ngenius of Energy, Persistence, Enterprise; and the feeble Abdul-Aziz, the\r\ngenius of Ignorance, Bigotry, and Indolence, prepared for the Forward\r\n--March!\r\n\r\nWe saw the splendid review, we saw the white-moustached old Crimean\r\nsoldier, Canrobert, Marshal of France, we saw--well, we saw every thing,\r\nand then we went home satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nWe went to see the Cathedral of Notre Dame.  We had heard of it before.\r\nIt surprises me sometimes to think how much we do know and how\r\nintelligent we are.  We recognized the brown old Gothic pile in a moment;\r\nit was like the pictures.  We stood at a little distance and changed from\r\none point of observation to another and gazed long at its lofty square\r\ntowers and its rich front, clustered thick with stony, mutilated saints\r\nwho had been looking calmly down from their perches for ages.  The\r\nPatriarch of Jerusalem stood under them in the old days of chivalry and\r\nromance, and preached the third Crusade, more than six hundred years ago;\r\nand since that day they have stood there and looked quietly down upon the\r\nmost thrilling scenes, the grandest pageants, the most extraordinary\r\nspectacles that have grieved or delighted Paris.  These battered and\r\nbroken-nosed old fellows saw many and many a cavalcade of mail-clad\r\nknights come marching home from Holy Land; they heard the bells above\r\nthem toll the signal for the St. Bartholomew's Massacre, and they saw the\r\nslaughter that followed; later they saw the Reign of Terror, the carnage\r\nof the Revolution, the overthrow of a king, the coronation of two\r\nNapoleons, the christening of the young prince that lords it over a\r\nregiment of servants in the Tuileries to-day--and they may possibly\r\ncontinue to stand there until they see the Napoleon dynasty swept away\r\nand the banners of a great republic floating above its ruins.  I wish\r\nthese old parties could speak.  They could tell a tale worth the\r\nlistening to.\r\n\r\nThey say that a pagan temple stood where Notre Dame now stands, in the\r\nold Roman days, eighteen or twenty centuries ago--remains of it are still\r\npreserved in Paris; and that a Christian church took its place about A.D.\r\n300; another took the place of that in A.D. 500; and that the foundations\r\nof the present cathedral were laid about A.D. 1100.  The ground ought to\r\nbe measurably sacred by this time, one would think.  One portion of this\r\nnoble old edifice is suggestive of the quaint fashions of ancient times.\r\nIt was built by Jean Sans-Peur, Duke of Burgundy, to set his conscience\r\nat rest--he had assassinated the Duke of Orleans.  Alas!  Those good old\r\ntimes are gone when a murderer could wipe the stain from his name and\r\nsoothe his troubles to sleep simply by getting out his bricks and mortar\r\nand building an addition to a church.\r\n\r\nThe portals of the great western front are bisected by square pillars.\r\nThey took the central one away in 1852, on the occasion of thanksgivings\r\nfor the reinstitution of the presidential power--but precious soon they\r\nhad occasion to reconsider that motion and put it back again!  And they\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nWe loitered through the grand aisles for an hour or two, staring up at\r\nthe rich stained-glass windows embellished with blue and yellow and\r\ncrimson saints and martyrs, and trying to admire the numberless great\r\npictures in the chapels, and then we were admitted to the sacristy and\r\nshown the magnificent robes which the Pope wore when he crowned Napoleon\r\nI; a wagon-load of solid gold and silver utensils used in the great\r\npublic processions and ceremonies of the church; some nails of the true\r\ncross, a fragment of the cross itself, a part of the crown of thorns.\r\nWe had already seen a large piece of the true cross in a church in the\r\nAzores, but no nails.  They showed us likewise the bloody robe which that\r\narchbishop of Paris wore who exposed his sacred person and braved the\r\nwrath of the insurgents of 1848, to mount the barricades and hold aloft\r\nthe olive branch of peace in the hope of stopping the slaughter.  His\r\nnoble effort cost him his life.  He was shot dead.  They showed us a cast\r\nof his face taken after death, the bullet that killed him, and the two\r\nvertebrae in which it lodged.  These people have a somewhat singular\r\ntaste in the matter of relics.  Ferguson told us that the silver cross\r\nwhich the good archbishop wore at his girdle was seized and thrown into\r\nthe Seine, where it lay embedded in the mud for fifteen years, and then\r\nan angel appeared to a priest and told him where to dive for it; he did\r\ndive for it and got it, and now it is there on exhibition at Notre Dame,\r\nto be inspected by anybody who feels an interest in inanimate objects of\r\nmiraculous intervention.\r\n\r\nNext we went to visit the Morgue, that horrible receptacle for the dead\r\nwho die mysteriously and leave the manner of their taking off a dismal\r\nsecret.  We stood before a grating and looked through into a room which\r\nwas hung all about with the clothing of dead men; coarse blouses,\r\nwater-soaked; the delicate garments of women and children; patrician\r\nvestments, hacked and stabbed and stained with red; a hat that was\r\ncrushed and bloody.  On a slanting stone lay a drowned man, naked,\r\nswollen, purple; clasping the fragment of a broken bush with a grip\r\nwhich death had so petrified that human strength could not unloose it\r\n--mute witness of the last despairing effort to save the life that was\r\ndoomed beyond all help. A stream of water trickled ceaselessly over the\r\nhideous face.  We knew that the body and the clothing were there for\r\nidentification by friends, but still we wondered if anybody could love\r\nthat repulsive object or grieve for its loss.  We grew meditative and\r\nwondered if, some forty years ago, when the mother of that ghastly thing\r\nwas dandling it upon her knee, and kissing it and petting it and\r\ndisplaying it with satisfied pride to the passers-by, a prophetic vision\r\nof this dread ending ever flitted through her brain.  I half feared that\r\nthe mother, or the wife or a brother of the dead man might come while we\r\nstood there, but nothing of the kind occurred.  Men and women came, and\r\nsome looked eagerly in and pressed their faces against the bars; others\r\nglanced carelessly at the body and turned away with a disappointed look\r\n--people, I thought, who live upon strong excitements and who attend the\r\nexhibitions of the Morgue regularly, just as other people go to see\r\ntheatrical spectacles every night.  When one of these looked in and\r\npassed on, I could not help thinking--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow this don't afford you any satisfaction--a party with his head shot\r\noff is what you need.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne night we went to the celebrated Jardin Mabille, but only staid a\r\nlittle while.  We wanted to see some of this kind of Paris life, however,\r\nand therefore the next night we went to a similar place of entertainment\r\nin a great garden in the suburb of Asnieres.  We went to the railroad\r\ndepot, toward evening, and Ferguson got tickets for a second-class\r\ncarriage.  Such a perfect jam of people I have not often seen--but there\r\nwas no noise, no disorder, no rowdyism.  Some of the women and young\r\ngirls that entered the train we knew to be of the demi-monde, but others\r\nwe were not at all sure about.\r\n\r\nThe girls and women in our carriage behaved themselves modestly and\r\nbecomingly all the way out, except that they smoked.  When we arrived at\r\nthe garden in Asnieres, we paid a franc or two admission and entered a\r\nplace which had flower beds in it, and grass plots, and long, curving\r\nrows of ornamental shrubbery, with here and there a secluded bower\r\nconvenient for eating ice cream in.  We moved along the sinuous gravel\r\nwalks, with the great concourse of girls and young men, and suddenly a\r\ndomed and filigreed white temple, starred over and over and over again\r\nwith brilliant gas jets, burst upon us like a fallen sun.  Nearby was a\r\nlarge, handsome house with its ample front illuminated in the same way,\r\nand above its roof floated the Star-Spangled Banner of America.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.  \xe2\x80\x9cHow is this?\xe2\x80\x9d  It nearly took my breath away.\r\n\r\nFerguson said an American--a New Yorker--kept the place, and was carrying\r\non quite a stirring opposition to the Jardin Mabille.\r\n\r\nCrowds composed of both sexes and nearly all ages were frisking about the\r\ngarden or sitting in the open air in front of the flagstaff and the\r\ntemple, drinking wine and coffee or smoking.  The dancing had not begun\r\nyet.  Ferguson said there was to be an exhibition.  The famous Blondin\r\nwas going to perform on a tightrope in another part of the garden.  We\r\nwent thither.  Here the light was dim, and the masses of people were\r\npretty closely packed together.  And now I made a mistake which any\r\ndonkey might make, but a sensible man never.  I committed an error which\r\nI find myself repeating every day of my life.  Standing right before a\r\nyoung lady, I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDan, just look at this girl, how beautiful she is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you more for the evident sincerity of the compliment, sir, than\r\nfor the extraordinary publicity you have given to it!\xe2\x80\x9d  This in good,\r\npure English.\r\n\r\nWe took a walk, but my spirits were very, very sadly dampened.  I did not\r\nfeel right comfortable for some time afterward.  Why will people be so\r\nstupid as to suppose themselves the only foreigners among a crowd of ten\r\nthousand persons?\r\n\r\nBut Blondin came out shortly.  He appeared on a stretched cable, far away\r\nabove the sea of tossing hats and handkerchiefs, and in the glare of the\r\nhundreds of rockets that whizzed heavenward by him he looked like a wee\r\ninsect.  He balanced his pole and walked the length of his rope--two or\r\nthree hundred feet; he came back and got a man and carried him across; he\r\nreturned to the center and danced a jig; next he performed some gymnastic\r\nand balancing feats too perilous to afford a pleasant spectacle; and he\r\nfinished by fastening to his person a thousand Roman candles, Catherine\r\nwheels, serpents and rockets of all manner of brilliant colors, setting\r\nthem on fire all at once and walking and waltzing across his rope again\r\nin a blinding blaze of glory that lit up the garden and the people's\r\nfaces like a great conflagration at midnight.\r\n\r\nThe dance had begun, and we adjourned to the temple.  Within it was a\r\ndrinking saloon, and all around it was a broad circular platform for the\r\ndancers.  I backed up against the wall of the temple, and waited.  Twenty\r\nsets formed, the music struck up, and then--I placed my hands before my\r\nface for very shame.  But I looked through my fingers.  They were dancing\r\nthe renowned \xe2\x80\x9cCan-can.\xe2\x80\x9d  A handsome girl in the set before me tripped\r\nforward lightly to meet the opposite gentleman, tripped back again,\r\ngrasped her dresses vigorously on both sides with her hands, raised them\r\npretty high, danced an extraordinary jig that had more activity and\r\nexposure about it than any jig I ever saw before, and then, drawing her\r\nclothes still higher, she advanced gaily to the center and launched a\r\nvicious kick full at her vis-a-vis that must infallibly have removed his\r\nnose if he had been seven feet high.  It was a mercy he was only six.\r\n\r\nThat is the can-can.  The idea of it is to dance as wildly, as noisily,\r\nas furiously as you can; expose yourself as much as possible if you are a\r\nwoman; and kick as high as you can, no matter which sex you belong to.\r\nThere is no word of exaggeration in this.  Any of the staid, respectable,\r\naged people who were there that night can testify to the truth of that\r\nstatement.  There were a good many such people present.  I suppose French\r\nmorality is not of that straight-laced description which is shocked at\r\ntrifles.\r\n\r\nI moved aside and took a general view of the can-can.  Shouts, laughter,\r\nfurious music, a bewildering chaos of darting and intermingling forms,\r\nstormy jerking and snatching of gay dresses, bobbing beads, flying arms,\r\nlightning flashes of white-stockinged calves and dainty slippers in the\r\nair, and then a grand final rush, riot, a terrific hubbub, and a wild\r\nstampede!  Heavens!  Nothing like it has been seen on earth since\r\ntrembling Tam O'Shanter saw the devil and the witches at their orgies\r\nthat stormy night in \xe2\x80\x9cAlloway's auld haunted kirk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe visited the Louvre, at a time when we had no silk purchases in view,\r\nand looked at its miles of paintings by the old masters.  Some of them\r\nwere beautiful, but at the same time they carried such evidences about\r\nthem of the cringing spirit of those great men that we found small\r\npleasure in examining them.  Their nauseous adulation of princely patrons\r\nwas more prominent to me and chained my attention more surely than the\r\ncharms of color and expression which are claimed to be in the pictures.\r\nGratitude for kindnesses is well, but it seems to me that some of those\r\nartists carried it so far that it ceased to be gratitude and became\r\nworship.  If there is a plausible excuse for the worship of men, then by\r\nall means let us forgive Rubens and his brethren.\r\n\r\nBut I will drop the subject, lest I say something about the old masters\r\nthat might as well be left unsaid.\r\n\r\nOf course we drove in the Bois de Boulogne, that limitless park, with its\r\nforests, its lakes, its cascades, and its broad avenues.  There were\r\nthousands upon thousands of vehicles abroad, and the scene was full of\r\nlife and gaiety.  There were very common hacks, with father and mother\r\nand all the children in them; conspicuous little open carriages with\r\ncelebrated ladies of questionable reputation in them; there were Dukes\r\nand Duchesses abroad, with gorgeous footmen perched behind, and equally\r\ngorgeous outriders perched on each of the six horses; there were blue and\r\nsilver, and green and gold, and pink and black, and all sorts and\r\ndescriptions of stunning and startling liveries out, and I almost yearned\r\nto be a flunkey myself, for the sake of the fine clothes.\r\n\r\nBut presently the Emperor came along and he outshone them all.  He was\r\npreceded by a bodyguard of gentlemen on horseback in showy uniforms, his\r\ncarriage-horses (there appeared to be somewhere in the remote\r\nneighborhood of a thousand of them,) were bestridden by gallant-looking\r\nfellows, also in stylish uniforms, and after the carriage followed\r\nanother detachment of bodyguards.  Everybody got out of the way;\r\neverybody bowed to the Emperor and his friend the Sultan; and they went\r\nby on a swinging trot and disappeared.\r\n\r\nI will not describe the Bois de Boulogne.  I can not do it.  It is simply\r\na beautiful, cultivated, endless, wonderful wilderness.  It is an\r\nenchanting place.  It is in Paris now, one may say, but a crumbling old\r\ncross in one portion of it reminds one that it was not always so.  The\r\ncross marks the spot where a celebrated troubadour was waylaid and\r\nmurdered in the fourteenth century.  It was in this park that that fellow\r\nwith an unpronounceable name made the attempt upon the Russian Czar's\r\nlife last spring with a pistol.  The bullet struck a tree.  Ferguson\r\nshowed us the place.  Now in America that interesting tree would be\r\nchopped down or forgotten within the next five years, but it will be\r\ntreasured here.  The guides will point it out to visitors for the next\r\neight hundred years, and when it decays and falls down they will put up\r\nanother there and go on with the same old story just the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nOne of our pleasantest visits was to Pere la Chaise, the national\r\nburying-ground of France, the honored resting-place of some of her\r\ngreatest and best children, the last home of scores of illustrious men\r\nand women who were born to no titles, but achieved fame by their own\r\nenergy and their own genius.  It is a solemn city of winding streets and\r\nof miniature marble temples and mansions of the dead gleaming white from\r\nout a wilderness of foliage and fresh flowers.  Not every city is so well\r\npeopled as this, or has so ample an area within its walls.  Few palaces\r\nexist in any city that are so exquisite in design, so rich in art, so\r\ncostly in material, so graceful, so beautiful.\r\n\r\nWe had stood in the ancient church of St. Denis, where the marble\r\neffigies of thirty generations of kings and queens lay stretched at\r\nlength upon the tombs, and the sensations invoked were startling and\r\nnovel; the curious armor, the obsolete costumes, the placid faces, the\r\nhands placed palm to palm in eloquent supplication--it was a vision of\r\ngray antiquity.  It seemed curious enough to be standing face to face, as\r\nit were, with old Dagobert I., and Clovis and Charlemagne, those vague,\r\ncolossal heroes, those shadows, those myths of a thousand years ago!  I\r\ntouched their dust-covered faces with my finger, but Dagobert was deader\r\nthan the sixteen centuries that have passed over him, Clovis slept well\r\nafter his labor for Christ, and old Charlemagne went on dreaming of his\r\npaladins, of bloody Roncesvalles, and gave no heed to me.\r\n\r\nThe great names of Pere la Chaise impress one, too, but differently.\r\nThere the suggestion brought constantly to his mind is, that this place\r\nis sacred to a nobler royalty--the royalty of heart and brain.  Every\r\nfaculty of mind, every noble trait of human nature, every high occupation\r\nwhich men engage in, seems represented by a famous name.  The effect is a\r\ncurious medley.  Davoust and Massena, who wrought in many a battle\r\ntragedy, are here, and so also is Rachel, of equal renown in mimic\r\ntragedy on the stage.  The Abbe Sicard sleeps here--the first great\r\nteacher of the deaf and dumb--a man whose heart went out to every\r\nunfortunate, and whose life was given to kindly offices in their service;\r\nand not far off, in repose and peace at last, lies Marshal Ney, whose\r\nstormy spirit knew no music like the bugle call to arms.  The man who\r\noriginated public gas-lighting, and that other benefactor who introduced\r\nthe cultivation of the potato and thus blessed millions of his starving\r\ncountrymen, lie with the Prince of Masserano, and with exiled queens and\r\nprinces of Further India.  Gay-Lussac the chemist, Laplace the\r\nastronomer, Larrey the surgeon, de Suze the advocate, are here, and with\r\nthem are Talma, Bellini, Rubini; de Balzac, Beaumarchais, Beranger;\r\nMoliere and Lafontaine, and scores of other men whose names and whose\r\nworthy labors are as familiar in the remote by-places of civilization as\r\nare the historic deeds of the kings and princes that sleep in the marble\r\nvaults of St. Denis.\r\n\r\nBut among the thousands and thousands of tombs in Pere la Chaise, there\r\nis one that no man, no woman, no youth of either sex, ever passes by\r\nwithout stopping to examine.  Every visitor has a sort of indistinct idea\r\nof the history of its dead and comprehends that homage is due there, but\r\nnot one in twenty thousand clearly remembers the story of that tomb and\r\nits romantic occupants.  This is the grave of Abelard and Heloise--a\r\ngrave which has been more revered, more widely known, more written and\r\nsung about and wept over, for seven hundred years, than any other in\r\nChristendom save only that of the Saviour.  All visitors linger pensively\r\nabout it; all young people capture and carry away keepsakes and mementoes\r\nof it; all Parisian youths and maidens who are disappointed in love come\r\nthere to bail out when they are full of tears; yea, many stricken lovers\r\nmake pilgrimages to this shrine from distant provinces to weep and wail\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cgrit\xe2\x80\x9d their teeth over their heavy sorrows, and to purchase the\r\nsympathies of the chastened spirits of that tomb with offerings of\r\nimmortelles and budding flowers.\r\n\r\nGo when you will, you find somebody snuffling over that tomb.  Go when\r\nyou will, you find it furnished with those bouquets and immortelles.  Go\r\nwhen you will, you find a gravel-train from Marseilles arriving to supply\r\nthe deficiencies caused by memento-cabbaging vandals whose affections\r\nhave miscarried.\r\n\r\nYet who really knows the story of Abelard and Heloise?  Precious few\r\npeople.  The names are perfectly familiar to every body, and that is\r\nabout all.  With infinite pains I have acquired a knowledge of that\r\nhistory, and I propose to narrate it here, partly for the honest\r\ninformation of the public and partly to show that public that they have\r\nbeen wasting a good deal of marketable sentiment very unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       STORY OF ABELARD AND HELOISE\r\n\r\nHeloise was born seven hundred and sixty-six years ago.  She may have had\r\nparents.  There is no telling.  She lived with her uncle Fulbert, a canon\r\nof the cathedral of Paris.  I do not know what a canon of a cathedral is,\r\nbut that is what he was.  He was nothing more than a sort of a mountain\r\nhowitzer, likely, because they had no heavy artillery in those days.\r\nSuffice it, then, that Heloise lived with her uncle the howitzer and was\r\nhappy.  She spent the most of her childhood in the convent of Argenteuil\r\n--never heard of Argenteuil before, but suppose there was really such a\r\nplace.  She then returned to her uncle, the old gun, or son of a gun, as\r\nthe case may be, and he taught her to write and speak Latin, which was\r\nthe language of literature and polite society at that period.\r\n\r\nJust at this time, Pierre Abelard, who had already made himself widely\r\nfamous as a rhetorician, came to found a school of rhetoric in Paris.\r\nThe originality of his principles, his eloquence, and his great physical\r\nstrength and beauty created a profound sensation.  He saw Heloise, and\r\nwas captivated by her blooming youth, her beauty, and her charming\r\ndisposition.  He wrote to her; she answered.  He wrote again; she\r\nanswered again.  He was now in love.  He longed to know her--to speak to\r\nher face to face.\r\n\r\nHis school was near Fulbert's house.  He asked Fulbert to allow him to\r\ncall.  The good old swivel saw here a rare opportunity: his niece, whom\r\nhe so much loved, would absorb knowledge from this man, and it would not\r\ncost him a cent.  Such was Fulbert--penurious.\r\n\r\nFulbert's first name is not mentioned by any author, which is\r\nunfortunate.  However, George W. Fulbert will answer for him as well as\r\nany other.  We will let him go at that.  He asked Abelard to teach her.\r\n\r\nAbelard was glad enough of the opportunity.  He came often and staid\r\nlong.  A letter of his shows in its very first sentence that he came\r\nunder that friendly roof like a cold-hearted villain as he was, with the\r\ndeliberate intention of debauching a confiding, innocent girl.  This is\r\nthe letter:\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot cease to be astonished at the simplicity of Fulbert;\r\n          I was as much surprised as if he had placed a lamb in the power\r\n          of a hungry wolf.  Heloise and I, under pretext of study, gave\r\n          ourselves up wholly to love, and the solitude that love seeks\r\n          our studies procured for us.  Books were open before us, but we\r\n          spoke oftener of love than philosophy, and kisses came more\r\n          readily from our lips than words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so, exulting over an honorable confidence which to his degraded\r\ninstinct was a ludicrous \xe2\x80\x9csimplicity,\xe2\x80\x9d this unmanly Abelard seduced the\r\nniece of the man whose guest he was.  Paris found it out.  Fulbert was\r\ntold of it--told often--but refused to believe it.  He could not\r\ncomprehend how a man could be so depraved as to use the sacred protection\r\nand security of hospitality as a means for the commission of such a crime\r\nas that.  But when he heard the rowdies in the streets singing the\r\nlove-songs of Abelard to Heloise, the case was too plain--love-songs come\r\nnot properly within the teachings of rhetoric and philosophy.\r\n\r\nHe drove Abelard from his house.  Abelard returned secretly and carried\r\nHeloise away to Palais, in Brittany, his native country.  Here, shortly\r\nafterward, she bore a son, who, from his rare beauty, was surnamed\r\nAstrolabe--William G.  The girl's flight enraged Fulbert, and he longed\r\nfor vengeance, but feared to strike lest retaliation visit Heloise--for\r\nhe still loved her tenderly.  At length Abelard offered to marry Heloise\r\n--but on a shameful condition: that the marriage should be kept secret\r\nfrom the world, to the end that (while her good name remained a wreck, as\r\nbefore,) his priestly reputation might be kept untarnished.  It was like\r\nthat miscreant.  Fulbert saw his opportunity and consented.  He would see\r\nthe parties married, and then violate the confidence of the man who had\r\ntaught him that trick; he would divulge the secret and so remove somewhat\r\nof the obloquy that attached to his niece's fame.  But the niece\r\nsuspected his scheme.  She refused the marriage at first; she said\r\nFulbert would betray the secret to save her, and besides, she did not\r\nwish to drag down a lover who was so gifted, so honored by the world,\r\nand who had such a splendid career before him.  It was noble,\r\nself-sacrificing love, and characteristic of the pure-souled Heloise,\r\nbut it was not good sense.\r\n\r\nBut she was overruled, and the private marriage took place.  Now for\r\nFulbert!  The heart so wounded should be healed at last; the proud spirit\r\nso tortured should find rest again; the humbled head should be lifted up\r\nonce more.  He proclaimed the marriage in the high places of the city and\r\nrejoiced that dishonor had departed from his house.  But lo!  Abelard\r\ndenied the marriage!  Heloise denied it!  The people, knowing the former\r\ncircumstances, might have believed Fulbert had only Abelard denied it,\r\nbut when the person chiefly interested--the girl herself--denied it, they\r\nlaughed, despairing Fulbert to scorn.\r\n\r\nThe poor canon of the cathedral of Paris was spiked again.  The last hope\r\nof repairing the wrong that had been done his house was gone.  What next?\r\nHuman nature suggested revenge.  He compassed it.  The historian says:\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cRuffians, hired by Fulbert, fell upon Abelard by night, and\r\n          inflicted upon him a terrible and nameless mutilation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI am seeking the last resting place of those \xe2\x80\x9cruffians.\xe2\x80\x9d  When I find it\r\nI shall shed some tears on it, and stack up some bouquets and\r\nimmortelles, and cart away from it some gravel whereby to remember that\r\nhowsoever blotted by crime their lives may have been, these ruffians did\r\none just deed, at any rate, albeit it was not warranted by the strict\r\nletter of the law.\r\n\r\nHeloise entered a convent and gave good-bye to the world and its\r\npleasures for all time.  For twelve years she never heard of Abelard\r\n--never even heard his name mentioned.  She had become prioress of\r\nArgenteuil and led a life of complete seclusion.  She happened one day to\r\nsee a letter written by him, in which he narrated his own history.  She\r\ncried over it and wrote him.  He answered, addressing her as his \xe2\x80\x9csister\r\nin Christ.\xe2\x80\x9d  They continued to correspond, she in the unweighed language\r\nof unwavering affection, he in the chilly phraseology of the polished\r\nrhetorician.  She poured out her heart in passionate, disjointed\r\nsentences; he replied with finished essays, divided deliberately into\r\nheads and sub-heads, premises and argument.  She showered upon him the\r\ntenderest epithets that love could devise, he addressed her from the\r\nNorth Pole of his frozen heart as the \xe2\x80\x9cSpouse of Christ!\xe2\x80\x9d  The abandoned\r\nvillain!\r\n\r\nOn account of her too easy government of her nuns, some disreputable\r\nirregularities were discovered among them, and the Abbot of St. Denis\r\nbroke up her establishment.  Abelard was the official head of the\r\nmonastery of St. Gildas de Ruys, at that time, and when he heard of her\r\nhomeless condition a sentiment of pity was aroused in his breast (it is a\r\nwonder the unfamiliar emotion did not blow his head off,) and he placed\r\nher and her troop in the little oratory of the Paraclete, a religious\r\nestablishment which he had founded.  She had many privations and\r\nsufferings to undergo at first, but her worth and her gentle disposition\r\nwon influential friends for her, and she built up a wealthy and\r\nflourishing nunnery.  She became a great favorite with the heads of the\r\nchurch, and also the people, though she seldom appeared in public.  She\r\nrapidly advanced in esteem, in good report, and in usefulness, and\r\nAbelard as rapidly lost ground.  The Pope so honored her that he made her\r\nthe head of her order.  Abelard, a man of splendid talents, and ranking\r\nas the first debater of his time, became timid, irresolute, and\r\ndistrustful of his powers.  He only needed a great misfortune to topple\r\nhim from the high position he held in the world of intellectual\r\nexcellence, and it came.  Urged by kings and princes to meet the subtle\r\nSt. Bernard in debate and crush him, he stood up in the presence of a\r\nroyal and illustrious assemblage, and when his antagonist had finished he\r\nlooked about him and stammered a commencement; but his courage failed\r\nhim, the cunning of his tongue was gone: with his speech unspoken, he\r\ntrembled and sat down, a disgraced and vanquished champion.\r\n\r\nHe died a nobody, and was buried at Cluny, A.D., 1144.  They removed his\r\nbody to the Paraclete afterward, and when Heloise died, twenty years\r\nlater, they buried her with him, in accordance with her last wish.  He\r\ndied at the ripe age of 64, and she at 63.  After the bodies had remained\r\nentombed three hundred years, they were removed once more.  They were\r\nremoved again in 1800, and finally, seventeen years afterward, they were\r\ntaken up and transferred to Pere la Chaise, where they will remain in\r\npeace and quiet until it comes time for them to get up and move again.\r\n\r\nHistory is silent concerning the last acts of the mountain howitzer.  Let\r\nthe world say what it will about him, I, at least, shall always respect\r\nthe memory and sorrow for the abused trust and the broken heart and the\r\ntroubled spirit of the old smooth-bore.  Rest and repose be his!\r\n\r\nSuch is the story of Abelard and Heloise.  Such is the history that\r\nLamartine has shed such cataracts of tears over.  But that man never\r\ncould come within the influence of a subject in the least pathetic\r\nwithout overflowing his banks.  He ought to be dammed--or leveed, I\r\nshould more properly say.  Such is the history--not as it is usually\r\ntold, but as it is when stripped of the nauseous sentimentality that\r\nwould enshrine for our loving worship a dastardly seducer like Pierre\r\nAbelard.  I have not a word to say against the misused, faithful girl,\r\nand would not withhold from her grave a single one of those simple\r\ntributes which blighted youths and maidens offer to her memory, but I am\r\nsorry enough that I have not time and opportunity to write four or five\r\nvolumes of my opinion of her friend the founder of the Parachute, or the\r\nParaclete, or whatever it was.\r\n\r\nThe tons of sentiment I have wasted on that unprincipled humbug in my\r\nignorance!  I shall throttle down my emotions hereafter, about this sort\r\nof people, until I have read them up and know whether they are entitled\r\nto any tearful attentions or not.  I wish I had my immortelles back, now,\r\nand that bunch of radishes.\r\n\r\nIn Paris we often saw in shop windows the sign \xe2\x80\x9cEnglish Spoken Here,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n just as one sees in the windows at home the sign \xe2\x80\x9cIci on parle\r\nfrancaise.\xe2\x80\x9d  We always invaded these places at once--and invariably\r\nreceived the information, framed in faultless French, that the clerk who\r\ndid the English for the establishment had just gone to dinner and would\r\nbe back in an hour--would Monsieur buy something?  We wondered why those\r\nparties happened to take their dinners at such erratic and extraordinary\r\nhours, for we never called at a time when an exemplary Christian would be\r\nin the least likely to be abroad on such an errand.  The truth was, it\r\nwas a base fraud--a snare to trap the unwary--chaff to catch fledglings\r\nwith.  They had no English-murdering clerk.  They trusted to the sign to\r\ninveigle foreigners into their lairs, and trusted to their own\r\nblandishments to keep them there till they bought something.\r\n\r\nWe ferreted out another French imposition--a frequent sign to this\r\neffect: \xe2\x80\x9cALL MANNER OF AMERICAN DRINKS ARTISTICALLY PREPARED HERE.\xe2\x80\x9d  We\r\nprocured the services of a gentleman experienced in the nomenclature of\r\nthe American bar, and moved upon the works of one of these impostors.  A\r\nbowing, aproned Frenchman skipped forward and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQue voulez les messieurs?\xe2\x80\x9d  I do not know what \xe2\x80\x9cQue voulez les\r\nmessieurs?\xe2\x80\x9d  means, but such was his remark.\r\n\r\nOur general said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe will take a whiskey straight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[A stare from the Frenchman.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you don't know what that is, give us a champagne cock-tail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[A stare and a shrug.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, give us a sherry cobbler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman was checkmated.  This was all Greek to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive us a brandy smash!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman began to back away, suspicious of the ominous vigor of the\r\nlast order--began to back away, shrugging his shoulders and spreading his\r\nhands apologetically.\r\n\r\nThe General followed him up and gained a complete victory.  The\r\nuneducated foreigner could not even furnish a Santa Cruz Punch, an\r\nEye-Opener, a Stone-Fence, or an Earthquake.  It was plain that he was a\r\nwicked impostor.\r\n\r\nAn acquaintance of mine said the other day that he was doubtless the only\r\nAmerican visitor to the Exposition who had had the high honor of being\r\nescorted by the Emperor's bodyguard.  I said with unobtrusive frankness\r\nthat I was astonished that such a long-legged, lantern-jawed,\r\nunprepossessing-looking specter as he should be singled out for a\r\ndistinction like that, and asked how it came about.  He said he had\r\nattended a great military review in the Champ de Mars some time ago, and\r\nwhile the multitude about him was growing thicker and thicker every\r\nmoment he observed an open space inside the railing.  He left his\r\ncarriage and went into it.  He was the only person there, and so he had\r\nplenty of room, and the situation being central, he could see all the\r\npreparations going on about the field.  By and by there was a sound of\r\nmusic, and soon the Emperor of the French and the Emperor of Austria,\r\nescorted by the famous Cent Gardes, entered the enclosure.  They seemed\r\nnot to observe him, but directly, in response to a sign from the\r\ncommander of the guard, a young lieutenant came toward him with a file of\r\nhis men following, halted, raised his hand, and gave the military salute,\r\nand then said in a low voice that he was sorry to have to disturb a\r\nstranger and a gentleman, but the place was sacred to royalty.  Then this\r\nNew Jersey phantom rose up and bowed and begged pardon, then with the\r\nofficer beside him, the file of men marching behind him, and with every\r\nmark of respect, he was escorted to his carriage by the imperial Cent\r\nGardes!  The officer saluted again and fell back, the New Jersey sprite\r\nbowed in return and had presence of mind enough to pretend that he had\r\nsimply called on a matter of private business with those emperors, and so\r\nwaved them an adieu and drove from the field!\r\n\r\nImagine a poor Frenchman ignorantly intruding upon a public rostrum\r\nsacred to some six-penny dignitary in America.  The police would scare\r\nhim to death first with a storm of their elegant blasphemy, and then pull\r\nhim to pieces getting him away from there.  We are measurably superior to\r\nthe French in some things, but they are immeasurably our betters in\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nEnough of Paris for the present.  We have done our whole duty by it.  We\r\nhave seen the Tuileries, the Napoleon Column, the Madeleine, that wonder\r\nof wonders the tomb of Napoleon, all the great churches and museums,\r\nlibraries, imperial palaces, and sculpture and picture galleries, the\r\nPantheon, Jardin des Plantes, the opera, the circus, the legislative\r\nbody, the billiard rooms, the barbers, the grisettes--\r\n\r\nAh, the grisettes!  I had almost forgotten.  They are another romantic\r\nfraud.  They were (if you let the books of travel tell it) always so\r\nbeautiful--so neat and trim, so graceful--so naive and trusting--so\r\ngentle, so winning--so faithful to their shop duties, so irresistible\r\nto buyers in their prattling importunity--so devoted to their\r\npoverty-stricken students of the Latin Quarter--so lighthearted and\r\nhappy on their Sunday picnics in the suburbs--and oh, so charmingly,\r\nso delightfully immoral!\r\n\r\nStuff!  For three or four days I was constantly saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick, Ferguson!  Is that a grisette?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he always said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe comprehended at last that I wanted to see a grisette.  Then he showed\r\nme dozens of them.  They were like nearly all the Frenchwomen I ever saw\r\n--homely.  They had large hands, large feet, large mouths; they had pug\r\nnoses as a general thing, and moustaches that not even good breeding\r\ncould overlook; they combed their hair straight back without parting;\r\nthey were ill-shaped, they were not winning, they were not graceful; I\r\nknew by their looks that they ate garlic and onions; and lastly and\r\nfinally, to my thinking it would be base flattery to call them immoral.\r\n\r\nAroint thee, wench!  I sorrow for the vagabond student of the Latin\r\nQuarter now, even more than formerly I envied him.  Thus topples to earth\r\nanother idol of my infancy.\r\n\r\nWe have seen every thing, and tomorrow we go to Versailles.  We shall see\r\nParis only for a little while as we come back to take up our line of\r\nmarch for the ship, and so I may as well bid the beautiful city a\r\nregretful farewell.  We shall travel many thousands of miles after we\r\nleave here and visit many great cities, but we shall find none so\r\nenchanting as this.\r\n\r\nSome of our party have gone to England, intending to take a roundabout\r\ncourse and rejoin the vessel at Leghorn or Naples several weeks hence.\r\nWe came near going to Geneva, but have concluded to return to Marseilles\r\nand go up through Italy from Genoa.\r\n\r\nI will conclude this chapter with a remark that I am sincerely proud to\r\nbe able to make--and glad, as well, that my comrades cordially endorse\r\nit, to wit: by far the handsomest women we have seen in France were born\r\nand reared in America.\r\n\r\nI feel now like a man who has redeemed a failing reputation and shed\r\nluster upon a dimmed escutcheon, by a single just deed done at the\r\neleventh hour.\r\n\r\nLet the curtain fall, to slow music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nVERSAILLES!  It is wonderfully beautiful!  You gaze and stare and try to\r\nunderstand that it is real, that it is on the earth, that it is not the\r\nGarden of Eden--but your brain grows giddy, stupefied by the world of\r\nbeauty around you, and you half believe you are the dupe of an exquisite\r\ndream.  The scene thrills one like military music!  A noble palace,\r\nstretching its ornamented front, block upon block away, till it seemed\r\nthat it would never end; a grand promenade before it, whereon the armies\r\nof an empire might parade; all about it rainbows of flowers, and colossal\r\nstatues that were almost numberless and yet seemed only scattered over\r\nthe ample space; broad flights of stone steps leading down from the\r\npromenade to lower grounds of the park--stairways that whole regiments\r\nmight stand to arms upon and have room to spare; vast fountains whose\r\ngreat bronze effigies discharged rivers of sparkling water into the air\r\nand mingled a hundred curving jets together in forms of matchless beauty;\r\nwide grass-carpeted avenues that branched hither and thither in every\r\ndirection and wandered to seemingly interminable distances, walled all\r\nthe way on either side with compact ranks of leafy trees whose branches\r\nmet above and formed arches as faultless and as symmetrical as ever were\r\ncarved in stone; and here and there were glimpses of sylvan lakes with\r\nminiature ships glassed in their surfaces.  And every where--on the\r\npalace steps, and the great promenade, around the fountains, among the\r\ntrees, and far under the arches of the endless avenues--hundreds and\r\nhundreds of people in gay costumes walked or ran or danced, and gave to\r\nthe fairy picture the life and animation which was all of perfection it\r\ncould have lacked.\r\n\r\nIt was worth a pilgrimage to see.  Everything is on so gigantic a scale.\r\nNothing is small--nothing is cheap.  The statues are all large; the\r\npalace is grand; the park covers a fair-sized county; the avenues are\r\ninterminable.  All the distances and all the dimensions about Versailles\r\nare vast.  I used to think the pictures exaggerated these distances and\r\nthese dimensions beyond all reason, and that they made Versailles more\r\nbeautiful than it was possible for any place in the world to be.  I know\r\nnow that the pictures never came up to the subject in any respect, and\r\nthat no painter could represent Versailles on canvas as beautiful as it\r\nis in reality.  I used to abuse Louis XIV for spending two hundred\r\nmillions of dollars in creating this marvelous park, when bread was so\r\nscarce with some of his subjects; but I have forgiven him now.  He took a\r\ntract of land sixty miles in circumference and set to work to make this\r\npark and build this palace and a road to it from Paris.  He kept 36,000\r\nmen employed daily on it, and the labor was so unhealthy that they used\r\nto die and be hauled off by cartloads every night.  The wife of a\r\nnobleman of the time speaks of this as an \xe2\x80\x9cinconvenience,\xe2\x80\x9d but naively\r\nremarks that \xe2\x80\x9cit does not seem worthy of attention in the happy state of\r\ntranquillity we now enjoy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI always thought ill of people at home who trimmed their shrubbery into\r\npyramids and squares and spires and all manner of unnatural shapes, and\r\nwhen I saw the same thing being practiced in this great park I began to\r\nfeel dissatisfied.  But I soon saw the idea of the thing and the wisdom\r\nof it.  They seek the general effect.  We distort a dozen sickly trees\r\ninto unaccustomed shapes in a little yard no bigger than a dining room,\r\nand then surely they look absurd enough.  But here they take two hundred\r\nthousand tall forest trees and set them in a double row; allow no sign of\r\nleaf or branch to grow on the trunk lower down than six feet above the\r\nground; from that point the boughs begin to project, and very gradually\r\nthey extend outward further and further till they meet overhead, and a\r\nfaultless tunnel of foliage is formed.  The arch is mathematically\r\nprecise.  The effect is then very fine.  They make trees take fifty\r\ndifferent shapes, and so these quaint effects are infinitely varied and\r\npicturesque.  The trees in no two avenues are shaped alike, and\r\nconsequently the eye is not fatigued with anything in the nature of\r\nmonotonous uniformity.  I will drop this subject now, leaving it to\r\nothers to determine how these people manage to make endless ranks of\r\nlofty forest trees grow to just a certain thickness of trunk (say a foot\r\nand two-thirds); how they make them spring to precisely the same height\r\nfor miles; how they make them grow so close together; how they compel one\r\nhuge limb to spring from the same identical spot on each tree and form\r\nthe main sweep of the arch; and how all these things are kept exactly in\r\nthe same condition and in the same exquisite shapeliness and symmetry\r\nmonth after month and year after year--for I have tried to reason out the\r\nproblem and have failed.\r\n\r\nWe walked through the great hall of sculpture and the one hundred and\r\nfifty galleries of paintings in the palace of Versailles, and felt that\r\nto be in such a place was useless unless one had a whole year at his\r\ndisposal.  These pictures are all battle scenes, and only one solitary\r\nlittle canvas among them all treats of anything but great French\r\nvictories.  We wandered, also, through the Grand Trianon and the Petit\r\nTrianon, those monuments of royal prodigality, and with histories so\r\nmournful--filled, as it is, with souvenirs of Napoleon the First, and\r\nthree dead kings and as many queens.  In one sumptuous bed they had all\r\nslept in succession, but no one occupies it now.  In a large dining room\r\nstood the table at which Louis XIV and his mistress Madame Maintenon, and\r\nafter them Louis XV, and Pompadour, had sat at their meals naked and\r\nunattended--for the table stood upon a trapdoor, which descended with it\r\nto regions below when it was necessary to replenish its dishes.  In a\r\nroom of the Petit Trianon stood the furniture, just as poor Marie\r\nAntoinette left it when the mob came and dragged her and the King to\r\nParis, never to return.  Near at hand, in the stables, were prodigious\r\ncarriages that showed no color but gold--carriages used by former kings\r\nof France on state occasions, and never used now save when a kingly head\r\nis to be crowned or an imperial infant christened.  And with them were\r\nsome curious sleighs, whose bodies were shaped like lions, swans, tigers,\r\netc.--vehicles that had once been handsome with pictured designs and\r\nfine workmanship, but were dusty and decaying now.  They had their\r\nhistory.  When Louis XIV had finished the Grand Trianon, he told\r\nMaintenon he had created a Paradise for her, and asked if she could think\r\nof anything now to wish for.  He said he wished the Trianon to be\r\nperfection--nothing less.  She said she could think of but one thing--it\r\nwas summer, and it was balmy France--yet she would like well to sleigh\r\nride in the leafy avenues of Versailles!  The next morning found miles\r\nand miles of grassy avenues spread thick with snowy salt and sugar, and a\r\nprocession of those quaint sleighs waiting to receive the chief concubine\r\nof the gaiest and most unprincipled court that France has ever seen!\r\n\r\nFrom sumptuous Versailles, with its palaces, its statues, its gardens,\r\nand its fountains, we journeyed back to Paris and sought its antipodes\r\n--the Faubourg St. Antoine.  Little, narrow streets; dirty children\r\nblockading them; greasy, slovenly women capturing and spanking them;\r\nfilthy dens on first floors, with rag stores in them (the heaviest\r\nbusiness in the Faubourg is the chiffonier's); other filthy dens where\r\nwhole suits of second and third-hand clothing are sold at prices that\r\nwould ruin any proprietor who did not steal his stock; still other filthy\r\ndens where they sold groceries--sold them by the half-pennyworth--five\r\ndollars would buy the man out, goodwill and all.  Up these little crooked\r\nstreets they will murder a man for seven dollars and dump the body in the\r\nSeine.  And up some other of these streets--most of them, I should say\r\n--live lorettes.\r\n\r\nAll through this Faubourg St. Antoine, misery, poverty, vice, and crime\r\ngo hand in hand, and the evidences of it stare one in the face from every\r\nside.  Here the people live who begin the revolutions.  Whenever there is\r\nanything of that kind to be done, they are always ready.  They take as\r\nmuch genuine pleasure in building a barricade as they do in cutting a\r\nthroat or shoving a friend into the Seine.  It is these savage-looking\r\nruffians who storm the splendid halls of the Tuileries occasionally, and\r\nswarm into Versailles when a king is to be called to account.\r\n\r\nBut they will build no more barricades, they will break no more soldiers'\r\nheads with paving-stones.  Louis Napoleon has taken care of all that.  He\r\nis annihilating the crooked streets and building in their stead noble\r\nboulevards as straight as an arrow--avenues which a cannon ball could\r\ntraverse from end to end without meeting an obstruction more irresistible\r\nthan the flesh and bones of men--boulevards whose stately edifices will\r\nnever afford refuges and plotting places for starving, discontented\r\nrevolution breeders.  Five of these great thoroughfares radiate from one\r\nample centre--a centre which is exceedingly well adapted to the\r\naccommodation of heavy artillery.  The mobs used to riot there, but they\r\nmust seek another rallying-place in future.  And this ingenious Napoleon\r\npaves the streets of his great cities with a smooth, compact composition\r\nof asphaltum and sand.  No more barricades of flagstones--no more\r\nassaulting his Majesty's troops with cobbles.  I cannot feel friendly\r\ntoward my quondam fellow-American, Napoleon III., especially at this\r\ntime,--[July, 1867.]--when in fancy I see his credulous victim,\r\nMaximilian, lying stark and stiff in Mexico, and his maniac widow\r\nwatching eagerly from her French asylum for the form that will never\r\ncome--but I do admire his nerve, his calm self-reliance, his shrewd good\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nWe had a pleasant journey of it seaward again.  We found that for the\r\nthree past nights our ship had been in a state of war.  The first night\r\nthe sailors of a British ship, being happy with grog, came down on the\r\npier and challenged our sailors to a free fight.  They accepted with\r\nalacrity, repaired to the pier, and gained--their share of a drawn\r\nbattle.  Several bruised and bloody members of both parties were carried\r\noff by the police and imprisoned until the following morning.  The next\r\nnight the British boys came again to renew the fight, but our men had had\r\nstrict orders to remain on board and out of sight.  They did so, and the\r\nbesieging party grew noisy and more and more abusive as the fact became\r\napparent (to them) that our men were afraid to come out.  They went away\r\nfinally with a closing burst of ridicule and offensive epithets.  The\r\nthird night they came again and were more obstreperous than ever.  They\r\nswaggered up and down the almost deserted pier, and hurled curses,\r\nobscenity, and stinging sarcasms at our crew.  It was more than human\r\nnature could bear.  The executive officer ordered our men ashore--with\r\ninstructions not to fight.  They charged the British and gained a\r\nbrilliant victory.  I probably would not have mentioned this war had it\r\nended differently.  But I travel to learn, and I still remember that they\r\npicture no French defeats in the battle-galleries of Versailles.\r\n\r\nIt was like home to us to step on board the comfortable ship again and\r\nsmoke and lounge about her breezy decks.  And yet it was not altogether\r\nlike home, either, because so many members of the family were away.  We\r\nmissed some pleasant faces which we would rather have found at dinner,\r\nand at night there were gaps in the euchre-parties which could not be\r\nsatisfactorily filled.  \xe2\x80\x9cMoult\xe2\x80\x9d  was in England, Jack in Switzerland,\r\nCharley in Spain.  Blucher was gone, none could tell where.  But we were\r\nat sea again, and we had the stars and the ocean to look at, and plenty\r\nof room to meditate in.\r\n\r\nIn due time the shores of Italy were sighted, and as we stood gazing from\r\nthe decks, early in the bright summer morning, the stately city of Genoa\r\nrose up out of the sea and flung back the sunlight from her hundred\r\npalaces.\r\n\r\nHere we rest for the present--or rather, here we have been trying to\r\nrest, for some little time, but we run about too much to accomplish a\r\ngreat deal in that line.\r\n\r\nI would like to remain here.  I had rather not go any further.  There may\r\nbe prettier women in Europe, but I doubt it.  The population of Genoa is\r\n120,000; two-thirds of these are women, I think, and at least two-thirds\r\nof the women are beautiful.  They are as dressy and as tasteful and as\r\ngraceful as they could possibly be without being angels.  However, angels\r\nare not very dressy, I believe.  At least the angels in pictures are not\r\n--they wear nothing but wings.  But these Genoese women do look so\r\ncharming.  Most of the young demoiselles are robed in a cloud of white\r\nfrom head to foot, though many trick themselves out more elaborately.\r\nNine-tenths of them wear nothing on their heads but a filmy sort of veil,\r\nwhich falls down their backs like a white mist.  They are very fair, and\r\nmany of them have blue eyes, but black and dreamy dark brown ones are met\r\nwith oftenest.\r\n\r\nThe ladies and gentlemen of Genoa have a pleasant fashion of promenading\r\nin a large park on the top of a hill in the center of the city, from six\r\ntill nine in the evening, and then eating ices in a neighboring garden an\r\nhour or two longer.  We went to the park on Sunday evening.  Two thousand\r\npersons were present, chiefly young ladies and gentlemen.  The gentlemen\r\nwere dressed in the very latest Paris fashions, and the robes of the\r\nladies glinted among the trees like so many snowflakes.  The multitude\r\nmoved round and round the park in a great procession.  The bands played,\r\nand so did the fountains; the moon and the gas lamps lit up the scene,\r\nand altogether it was a brilliant and an animated picture.  I scanned\r\nevery female face that passed, and it seemed to me that all were\r\nhandsome.  I never saw such a freshet of loveliness before.  I did not\r\nsee how a man of only ordinary decision of character could marry here,\r\nbecause before he could get his mind made up he would fall in love with\r\nsomebody else.\r\n\r\nNever smoke any Italian tobacco.  Never do it on any account.  It makes\r\nme shudder to think what it must be made of.  You cannot throw an old\r\ncigar \xe2\x80\x9cstub\xe2\x80\x9d down anywhere, but some vagabond will pounce upon it on the\r\ninstant.  I like to smoke a good deal, but it wounds my sensibilities to\r\nsee one of these stub-hunters watching me out of the corners of his\r\nhungry eyes and calculating how long my cigar will be likely to last.\r\nIt reminded me too painfully of that San Francisco undertaker who used to\r\ngo to sick-beds with his watch in his hand and time the corpse.  One of\r\nthese stub-hunters followed us all over the park last night, and we never\r\nhad a smoke that was worth anything.  We were always moved to appease him\r\nwith the stub before the cigar was half gone, because he looked so\r\nviciously anxious.  He regarded us as his own legitimate prey, by right\r\nof discovery, I think, because he drove off several other professionals\r\nwho wanted to take stock in us.\r\n\r\nNow, they surely must chew up those old stubs, and dry and sell them for\r\nsmoking-tobacco.  Therefore, give your custom to other than Italian\r\nbrands of the article.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Superb\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cCity of Palaces\xe2\x80\x9d are names which Genoa has held for\r\ncenturies.  She is full of palaces, certainly, and the palaces are\r\nsumptuous inside, but they are very rusty without and make no pretensions\r\nto architectural magnificence.  \xe2\x80\x9cGenoa the Superb\xe2\x80\x9d would be a felicitous\r\ntitle if it referred to the women.\r\n\r\nWe have visited several of the palaces--immense thick-walled piles, with\r\ngreat stone staircases, tesselated marble pavements on the floors,\r\n(sometimes they make a mosaic work, of intricate designs, wrought in\r\npebbles or little fragments of marble laid in cement,) and grand salons\r\nhung with pictures by Rubens, Guido, Titian, Paul Veronese, and so on,\r\nand portraits of heads of the family, in plumed helmets and gallant coats\r\nof mail, and patrician ladies in stunning costumes of centuries ago.\r\nBut, of course, the folks were all out in the country for the summer, and\r\nmight not have known enough to ask us to dinner if they had been at home,\r\nand so all the grand empty salons, with their resounding pavements, their\r\ngrim pictures of dead ancestors, and tattered banners with the dust of\r\nbygone centuries upon them, seemed to brood solemnly of death and the\r\ngrave, and our spirits ebbed away, and our cheerfulness passed from us.\r\nWe never went up to the eleventh story.  We always began to suspect\r\nghosts.  There was always an undertaker-looking servant along, too, who\r\nhanded us a program, pointed to the picture that began the list of the\r\nsalon he was in, and then stood stiff and stark and unsmiling in his\r\npetrified livery till we were ready to move on to the next chamber,\r\nwhereupon he marched sadly ahead and took up another malignantly\r\nrespectful position as before.  I wasted so much time praying that the\r\nroof would fall in on these dispiriting flunkies that I had but little\r\nleft to bestow upon palace and pictures.\r\n\r\nAnd besides, as in Paris, we had a guide.  Perdition catch all the\r\nguides.  This one said he was the most gifted linguist in Genoa, as far\r\nas English was concerned, and that only two persons in the city beside\r\nhimself could talk the language at all.  He showed us the birthplace of\r\nChristopher Columbus, and after we had reflected in silent awe before it\r\nfor fifteen minutes, he said it was not the birthplace of Columbus, but\r\nof Columbus' grandmother!  When we demanded an explanation of his conduct\r\nhe only shrugged his shoulders and answered in barbarous Italian.  I\r\nshall speak further of this guide in a future chapter.  All the\r\ninformation we got out of him we shall be able to carry along with us, I\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nI have not been to church so often in a long time as I have in the last\r\nfew weeks.  The people in these old lands seem to make churches their\r\nspecialty.  Especially does this seem to be the case with the citizens of\r\nGenoa.  I think there is a church every three or four hundred yards all\r\nover town.  The streets are sprinkled from end to end with shovel-hatted,\r\nlong-robed, well-fed priests, and the church bells by dozens are pealing\r\nall the day long, nearly.  Every now and then one comes across a friar of\r\norders gray, with shaven head, long, coarse robe, rope girdle and beads,\r\nand with feet cased in sandals or entirely bare.  These worthies suffer\r\nin the flesh and do penance all their lives, I suppose, but they look\r\nlike consummate famine-breeders.  They are all fat and serene.\r\n\r\nThe old Cathedral of San Lorenzo is about as notable a building as we\r\nhave found in Genoa.  It is vast, and has colonnades of noble pillars,\r\nand a great organ, and the customary pomp of gilded moldings, pictures,\r\nfrescoed ceilings, and so forth.  I cannot describe it, of course--it\r\nwould require a good many pages to do that.  But it is a curious place.\r\nThey said that half of it--from the front door halfway down to the altar\r\n--was a Jewish synagogue before the Saviour was born, and that no\r\nalteration had been made in it since that time.  We doubted the\r\nstatement, but did it reluctantly.  We would much rather have believed\r\nit.  The place looked in too perfect repair to be so ancient.\r\n\r\nThe main point of interest about the cathedral is the little Chapel of\r\nSt. John the Baptist.  They only allow women to enter it on one day in\r\nthe year, on account of the animosity they still cherish against the sex\r\nbecause of the murder of the Saint to gratify a caprice of Herodias.  In\r\nthis Chapel is a marble chest, in which, they told us, were the ashes of\r\nSt. John; and around it was wound a chain, which, they said, had confined\r\nhim when he was in prison.  We did not desire to disbelieve these\r\nstatements, and yet we could not feel certain that they were correct\r\n--partly because we could have broken that chain, and so could St. John,\r\nand partly because we had seen St. John's ashes before, in another\r\nchurch.  We could not bring ourselves to think St. John had two sets of\r\nashes.\r\n\r\nThey also showed us a portrait of the Madonna which was painted by St.\r\nLuke, and it did not look half as old and smoky as some of the pictures\r\nby Rubens.  We could not help admiring the Apostle's modesty in never\r\nonce mentioning in his writings that he could paint.\r\n\r\nBut isn't this relic matter a little overdone?  We find a piece of the\r\ntrue cross in every old church we go into, and some of the nails that\r\nheld it together.  I would not like to be positive, but I think we have\r\nseen as much as a keg of these nails.  Then there is the crown of thorns;\r\nthey have part of one in Sainte Chapelle, in Paris, and part of one also\r\nin Notre Dame.  And as for bones of St. Denis, I feel certain we have\r\nseen enough of them to duplicate him if necessary.\r\n\r\nI only meant to write about the churches, but I keep wandering from the\r\nsubject.  I could say that the Church of the Annunciation is a wilderness\r\nof beautiful columns, of statues, gilded moldings, and pictures almost\r\ncountless, but that would give no one an entirely perfect idea of the\r\nthing, and so where is the use?  One family built the whole edifice, and\r\nhave got money left.  There is where the mystery lies.  We had an idea at\r\nfirst that only a mint could have survived the expense.\r\n\r\nThese people here live in the heaviest, highest, broadest, darkest,\r\nsolidest houses one can imagine.  Each one might \xe2\x80\x9claugh a siege to\r\nscorn.\xe2\x80\x9d  A hundred feet front and a hundred high is about the style, and\r\nyou go up three flights of stairs before you begin to come upon signs of\r\noccupancy.  Everything is stone, and stone of the heaviest--floors,\r\nstairways, mantels, benches--everything.  The walls are four to five feet\r\nthick.  The streets generally are four or five to eight feet wide and as\r\ncrooked as a corkscrew.  You go along one of these gloomy cracks, and\r\nlook up and behold the sky like a mere ribbon of light, far above your\r\nhead, where the tops of the tall houses on either side of the street bend\r\nalmost together.  You feel as if you were at the bottom of some\r\ntremendous abyss, with all the world far above you.  You wind in and out\r\nand here and there, in the most mysterious way, and have no more idea of\r\nthe points of the compass than if you were a blind man.  You can never\r\npersuade yourself that these are actually streets, and the frowning,\r\ndingy, monstrous houses dwellings, till you see one of these beautiful,\r\nprettily dressed women emerge from them--see her emerge from a dark,\r\ndreary-looking den that looks dungeon all over, from the ground away\r\nhalfway up to heaven.  And then you wonder that such a charming moth\r\ncould come from such a forbidding shell as that.  The streets are wisely\r\nmade narrow and the houses heavy and thick and stony, in order that the\r\npeople may be cool in this roasting climate.  And they are cool, and stay\r\nso.  And while I think of it--the men wear hats and have very dark\r\ncomplexions, but the women wear no headgear but a flimsy veil like a\r\ngossamer's web, and yet are exceedingly fair as a general thing.\r\nSingular, isn't it?\r\n\r\nThe huge palaces of Genoa are each supposed to be occupied by one family,\r\nbut they could accommodate a hundred, I should think.  They are relics of\r\nthe grandeur of Genoa's palmy days--the days when she was a great\r\ncommercial and maritime power several centuries ago.  These houses, solid\r\nmarble palaces though they be, are in many cases of a dull pinkish color,\r\noutside, and from pavement to eaves are pictured with Genoese battle\r\nscenes, with monstrous Jupiters and Cupids, and with familiar\r\nillustrations from Grecian mythology.  Where the paint has yielded to age\r\nand exposure and is peeling off in flakes and patches, the effect is not\r\nhappy.  A noseless Cupid or a Jupiter with an eye out or a Venus with a\r\nfly-blister on her breast, are not attractive features in a picture.\r\nSome of these painted walls reminded me somewhat of the tall van,\r\nplastered with fanciful bills and posters, that follows the bandwagon of\r\na circus about a country village.  I have not read or heard that the\r\noutsides of the houses of any other European city are frescoed in this\r\nway.\r\n\r\nI can not conceive of such a thing as Genoa in ruins.  Such massive\r\narches, such ponderous substructions as support these towering\r\nbroad-winged edifices, we have seldom seen before; and surely the great\r\nblocks of stone of which these edifices are built can never decay; walls\r\nthat are as thick as an ordinary American doorway is high cannot\r\ncrumble.\r\n\r\nThe republics of Genoa and Pisa were very powerful in the Middle Ages.\r\nTheir ships filled the Mediterranean, and they carried on an extensive\r\ncommerce with Constantinople and Syria.  Their warehouses were the great\r\ndistributing depots from whence the costly merchandise of the East was\r\nsent abroad over Europe.  They were warlike little nations and defied, in\r\nthose days, governments that overshadow them now as mountains overshadow\r\nmolehills.  The Saracens captured and pillaged Genoa nine hundred years\r\nago, but during the following century Genoa and Pisa entered into an\r\noffensive and defensive alliance and besieged the Saracen colonies in\r\nSardinia and the Balearic Isles with an obstinacy that maintained its\r\npristine vigor and held to its purpose for forty long years.  They were\r\nvictorious at last and divided their conquests equably among their great\r\npatrician families.  Descendants of some of those proud families still\r\ninhabit the palaces of Genoa, and trace in their own features a\r\nresemblance to the grim knights whose portraits hang in their stately\r\nhalls, and to pictured beauties with pouting lips and merry eyes whose\r\noriginals have been dust and ashes for many a dead and forgotten century.\r\n\r\nThe hotel we live in belonged to one of those great orders of knights of\r\nthe Cross in the times of the Crusades, and its mailed sentinels once\r\nkept watch and ward in its massive turrets and woke the echoes of these\r\nhalls and corridors with their iron heels.\r\n\r\nBut Genoa's greatness has degenerated into an unostentatious commerce in\r\nvelvets and silver filagree-work.  They say that each European town has\r\nits specialty.  These filagree things are Genoa's specialty.  Her smiths\r\ntake silver ingots and work them up into all manner of graceful and\r\nbeautiful forms.  They make bunches of flowers, from flakes and wires of\r\nsilver, that counterfeit the delicate creations the frost weaves upon a\r\nwindowpane; and we were shown a miniature silver temple whose fluted\r\ncolumns, whose Corinthian capitals and rich entablatures, whose spire,\r\nstatues, bells, and ornate lavishness of sculpture were wrought in\r\npolished silver, and with such matchless art that every detail was a\r\nfascinating study and the finished edifice a wonder of beauty.\r\n\r\nWe are ready to move again, though we are not really tired yet of the\r\nnarrow passages of this old marble cave.  Cave is a good word--when\r\nspeaking of Genoa under the stars.  When we have been prowling at\r\nmidnight through the gloomy crevices they call streets, where no\r\nfootfalls but ours were echoing, where only ourselves were abroad, and\r\nlights appeared only at long intervals and at a distance, and\r\nmysteriously disappeared again, and the houses at our elbows seemed to\r\nstretch upward farther than ever toward the heavens, the memory of a cave\r\nI used to know at home was always in my mind, with its lofty passages,\r\nits silence and solitude, its shrouding gloom, its sepulchral echoes, its\r\nflitting lights, and more than all, its sudden revelations of branching\r\ncrevices and corridors where we least expected them.\r\n\r\nWe are not tired of the endless processions of cheerful, chattering\r\ngossipers that throng these courts and streets all day long, either; nor\r\nof the coarse-robed monks; nor of the \xe2\x80\x9cAsti\xe2\x80\x9d wines, which that old doctor\r\n(whom we call the Oracle,) with customary felicity in the matter of\r\ngetting everything wrong, misterms \xe2\x80\x9cnasty.\xe2\x80\x9d  But we must go,\r\nnevertheless.\r\n\r\nOur last sight was the cemetery (a burial place intended to accommodate\r\n60,000 bodies,) and we shall continue to remember it after we shall have\r\nforgotten the palaces.  It is a vast marble collonaded corridor extending\r\naround a great unoccupied square of ground; its broad floor is marble,\r\nand on every slab is an inscription--for every slab covers a corpse.  On\r\neither side, as one walks down the middle of the passage, are monuments,\r\ntombs, and sculptured figures that are exquisitely wrought and are full\r\nof grace and beauty.  They are new and snowy; every outline is perfect,\r\nevery feature guiltless of mutilation, flaw, or blemish; and therefore,\r\nto us these far-reaching ranks of bewitching forms are a hundred fold\r\nmore lovely than the damaged and dingy statuary they have saved from the\r\nwreck of ancient art and set up in the galleries of Paris for the worship\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nWell provided with cigars and other necessaries of life, we are now ready\r\nto take the cars for Milan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nAll day long we sped through a mountainous country whose peaks were\r\nbright with sunshine, whose hillsides were dotted with pretty villas\r\nsitting in the midst of gardens and shrubbery, and whose deep ravines\r\nwere cool and shady and looked ever so inviting from where we and the\r\nbirds were winging our flight through the sultry upper air.\r\n\r\nWe had plenty of chilly tunnels wherein to check our perspiration,\r\nthough.  We timed one of them.  We were twenty minutes passing through\r\nit, going at the rate of thirty to thirty-five miles an hour.\r\n\r\nBeyond Alessandria we passed the battle-field of Marengo.\r\n\r\nToward dusk we drew near Milan and caught glimpses of the city and the\r\nblue mountain peaks beyond.  But we were not caring for these things\r\n--they did not interest us in the least.  We were in a fever of impatience;\r\nwe were dying to see the renowned cathedral!  We watched--in this\r\ndirection and that--all around--everywhere.  We needed no one to point it\r\nout--we did not wish any one to point it out--we would recognize it even\r\nin the desert of the great Sahara.\r\n\r\nAt last, a forest of graceful needles, shimmering in the amber sunlight,\r\nrose slowly above the pygmy housetops, as one sometimes sees, in the far\r\nhorizon, a gilded and pinnacled mass of cloud lift itself above the waste\r\nof waves, at sea,--the Cathedral!  We knew it in a moment.\r\n\r\nHalf of that night, and all of the next day, this architectural autocrat\r\nwas our sole object of interest.\r\n\r\nWhat a wonder it is!  So grand, so solemn, so vast!  And yet so delicate,\r\nso airy, so graceful!  A very world of solid weight, and yet it seems in\r\nthe soft moonlight only a fairy delusion of frost-work that might vanish\r\nwith a breath!  How sharply its pinnacled angles and its wilderness of\r\nspires were cut against the sky, and how richly their shadows fell upon\r\nits snowy roof!  It was a vision!--a miracle!--an anthem sung in stone, a\r\npoem wrought in marble!\r\n\r\nHowsoever you look at the great cathedral, it is noble, it is beautiful!\r\nWherever you stand in Milan or within seven miles of Milan, it is visible\r\nand when it is visible, no other object can chain your whole attention.\r\nLeave your eyes unfettered by your will but a single instant and they\r\nwill surely turn to seek it.  It is the first thing you look for when you\r\nrise in the morning, and the last your lingering gaze rests upon at\r\nnight.  Surely it must be the princeliest creation that ever brain of man\r\nconceived.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock in the morning we went and stood before this marble\r\ncolossus.  The central one of its five great doors is bordered with a\r\nbas-relief of birds and fruits and beasts and insects, which have been so\r\ningeniously carved out of the marble that they seem like living\r\ncreatures--and the figures are so numerous and the design so complex that\r\none might study it a week without exhausting its interest.  On the great\r\nsteeple--surmounting the myriad of spires--inside of the spires--over the\r\ndoors, the windows--in nooks and corners--every where that a niche or a\r\nperch can be found about the enormous building, from summit to base,\r\nthere is a marble statue, and every statue is a study in itself!\r\nRaphael, Angelo, Canova--giants like these gave birth to the designs, and\r\ntheir own pupils carved them.  Every face is eloquent with expression,\r\nand every attitude is full of grace.  Away above, on the lofty roof, rank\r\non rank of carved and fretted spires spring high in the air, and through\r\ntheir rich tracery one sees the sky beyond.  In their midst the central\r\nsteeple towers proudly up like the mainmast of some great Indiaman among\r\na fleet of coasters.\r\n\r\nWe wished to go aloft.  The sacristan showed us a marble stairway (of\r\ncourse it was marble, and of the purest and whitest--there is no other\r\nstone, no brick, no wood, among its building materials) and told us to go\r\nup one hundred and eighty-two steps and stop till he came.  It was not\r\nnecessary to say stop--we should have done that any how.  We were tired\r\nby the time we got there.  This was the roof.  Here, springing from its\r\nbroad marble flagstones, were the long files of spires, looking very tall\r\nclose at hand, but diminishing in the distance like the pipes of an\r\norgan.  We could see now that the statue on the top of each was the size\r\nof a large man, though they all looked like dolls from the street.  We\r\ncould see, also, that from the inside of each and every one of these\r\nhollow spires, from sixteen to thirty-one beautiful marble statues looked\r\nout upon the world below.\r\n\r\nFrom the eaves to the comb of the roof stretched in endless succession\r\ngreat curved marble beams, like the fore-and-aft braces of a steamboat,\r\nand along each beam from end to end stood up a row of richly carved\r\nflowers and fruits--each separate and distinct in kind, and over 15,000\r\nspecies represented.  At a little distance these rows seem to close\r\ntogether like the ties of a railroad track, and then the mingling\r\ntogether of the buds and blossoms of this marble garden forms a picture\r\nthat is very charming to the eye.\r\n\r\nWe descended and entered.  Within the church, long rows of fluted\r\ncolumns, like huge monuments, divided the building into broad aisles, and\r\non the figured pavement fell many a soft blush from the painted windows\r\nabove.  I knew the church was very large, but I could not fully\r\nappreciate its great size until I noticed that the men standing far down\r\nby the altar looked like boys, and seemed to glide, rather than walk.  We\r\nloitered about gazing aloft at the monster windows all aglow with\r\nbrilliantly colored scenes in the lives of the Saviour and his followers.\r\nSome of these pictures are mosaics, and so artistically are their\r\nthousand particles of tinted glass or stone put together that the work\r\nhas all the smoothness and finish of a painting.  We counted sixty panes\r\nof glass in one window, and each pane was adorned with one of these\r\nmaster achievements of genius and patience.\r\n\r\nThe guide showed us a coffee-colored piece of sculpture which he said was\r\nconsidered to have come from the hand of Phidias, since it was not\r\npossible that any other artist, of any epoch, could have copied nature\r\nwith such faultless accuracy.  The figure was that of a man without a\r\nskin; with every vein, artery, muscle, every fiber and tendon and tissue\r\nof the human frame represented in minute detail.  It looked natural,\r\nbecause somehow it looked as if it were in pain.  A skinned man would be\r\nlikely to look that way unless his attention were occupied with some\r\nother matter.  It was a hideous thing, and yet there was a fascination\r\nabout it some where.  I am very sorry I saw it, because I shall always\r\nsee it now.  I shall dream of it sometimes.  I shall dream that it is\r\nresting its corded arms on the bed's head and looking down on me with its\r\ndead eyes; I shall dream that it is stretched between the sheets with me\r\nand touching me with its exposed muscles and its stringy cold legs.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to forget repulsive things.  I remember yet how I ran off from\r\nschool once, when I was a boy, and then, pretty late at night, concluded\r\nto climb into the window of my father's office and sleep on a lounge,\r\nbecause I had a delicacy about going home and getting thrashed.  As I lay\r\non the lounge and my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, I fancied I\r\ncould see a long, dusky, shapeless thing stretched upon the floor.  A\r\ncold shiver went through me.  I turned my face to the wall.  That did not\r\nanswer.  I was afraid that that thing would creep over and seize me in\r\nthe dark.  I turned back and stared at it for minutes and minutes--they\r\nseemed hours.  It appeared to me that the lagging moonlight never, never\r\nwould get to it.  I turned to the wall and counted twenty, to pass the\r\nfeverish time away.  I looked--the pale square was nearer.  I turned\r\nagain and counted fifty--it was almost touching it.  With desperate will\r\nI turned again and counted one hundred, and faced about, all in a\r\ntremble.  A white human hand lay in the moonlight!  Such an awful sinking\r\nat the heart--such a sudden gasp for breath!  I felt--I cannot tell what\r\nI felt.  When I recovered strength enough, I faced the wall again.  But\r\nno boy could have remained so with that mysterious hand behind him.  I\r\ncounted again and looked--the most of a naked arm was exposed.  I put my\r\nhands over my eyes and counted till I could stand it no longer, and then\r\n--the pallid face of a man was there, with the corners of the mouth drawn\r\ndown, and the eyes fixed and glassy in death!  I raised to a sitting\r\nposture and glowered on that corpse till the light crept down the bare\r\nbreastline by line--inch by inch--past the nipple--and then it disclosed\r\na ghastly stab!\r\n\r\nI went away from there.  I do not say that I went away in any sort of a\r\nhurry, but I simply went--that is sufficient.  I went out at the window,\r\nand I carried the sash along with me.  I did not need the sash, but it\r\nwas handier to take it than it was to leave it, and so I took it.--I was\r\nnot scared, but I was considerably agitated.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached home, they whipped me, but I enjoyed it.  It seemed\r\nperfectly delightful.  That man had been stabbed near the office that\r\nafternoon, and they carried him in there to doctor him, but he only lived\r\nan hour.  I have slept in the same room with him often since then--in my\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nNow we will descend into the crypt, under the grand altar of Milan\r\nCathedral, and receive an impressive sermon from lips that have been\r\nsilent and hands that have been gestureless for three hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe priest stopped in a small dungeon and held up his candle.  This was\r\nthe last resting-place of a good man, a warm-hearted, unselfish man; a\r\nman whose whole life was given to succoring the poor, encouraging the\r\nfaint-hearted, visiting the sick; in relieving distress, whenever and\r\nwherever he found it.  His heart, his hand, and his purse were always\r\nopen.  With his story in one's mind he can almost see his benignant\r\ncountenance moving calmly among the haggard faces of Milan in the days\r\nwhen the plague swept the city, brave where all others were cowards, full\r\nof compassion where pity had been crushed out of all other breasts by the\r\ninstinct of self-preservation gone mad with terror, cheering all, praying\r\nwith all, helping all, with hand and brain and purse, at a time when\r\nparents forsook their children, the friend deserted the friend, and the\r\nbrother turned away from the sister while her pleadings were still\r\nwailing in his ears.\r\n\r\nThis was good St. Charles Borromeo, Bishop of Milan.  The people idolized\r\nhim; princes lavished uncounted treasures upon him.  We stood in his\r\ntomb.  Near by was the sarcophagus, lighted by the dripping candles.  The\r\nwalls were faced with bas-reliefs representing scenes in his life done in\r\nmassive silver.  The priest put on a short white lace garment over his\r\nblack robe, crossed himself, bowed reverently, and began to turn a\r\nwindlass slowly.  The sarcophagus separated in two parts, lengthwise, and\r\nthe lower part sank down and disclosed a coffin of rock crystal as clear\r\nas the atmosphere.  Within lay the body, robed in costly habiliments\r\ncovered with gold embroidery and starred with scintillating gems.  The\r\ndecaying head was black with age, the dry skin was drawn tight to the\r\nbones, the eyes were gone, there was a hole in the temple and another in\r\nthe cheek, and the skinny lips were parted as in a ghastly smile!  Over\r\nthis dreadful face, its dust and decay and its mocking grin, hung a crown\r\nsown thick with flashing brilliants; and upon the breast lay crosses and\r\ncroziers of solid gold that were splendid with emeralds and diamonds.\r\n\r\nHow poor, and cheap, and trivial these gew-gaws seemed in presence of the\r\nsolemnity, the grandeur, the awful majesty of Death!  Think of Milton,\r\nShakespeare, Washington, standing before a reverent world tricked out in\r\nthe glass beads, the brass ear-rings and tin trumpery of the savages of\r\nthe plains!\r\n\r\nDead Bartolomeo preached his pregnant sermon, and its burden was: You\r\nthat worship the vanities of earth--you that long for worldly honor,\r\nworldly wealth, worldly fame--behold their worth!\r\n\r\nTo us it seemed that so good a man, so kind a heart, so simple a nature,\r\ndeserved rest and peace in a grave sacred from the intrusion of prying\r\neyes, and believed that he himself would have preferred to have it so,\r\nbut peradventure our wisdom was at fault in this regard.\r\n\r\nAs we came out upon the floor of the church again, another priest\r\nvolunteered to show us the treasures of the church.\r\n\r\nWhat, more?  The furniture of the narrow chamber of death we had just\r\nvisited weighed six millions of francs in ounces and carats alone,\r\nwithout a penny thrown into the account for the costly workmanship\r\nbestowed upon them!  But we followed into a large room filled with tall\r\nwooden presses like wardrobes.  He threw them open, and behold, the\r\ncargoes of \xe2\x80\x9ccrude bullion\xe2\x80\x9d of the assay offices of Nevada faded out of my\r\nmemory.  There were Virgins and bishops there, above their natural size,\r\nmade of solid silver, each worth, by weight, from eight hundred thousand\r\nto two millions of francs, and bearing gemmed books in their hands worth\r\neighty thousand; there were bas-reliefs that weighed six hundred pounds,\r\ncarved in solid silver; croziers and crosses, and candlesticks six and\r\neight feet high, all of virgin gold, and brilliant with precious stones;\r\nand beside these were all manner of cups and vases, and such things, rich\r\nin proportion.  It was an Aladdin's palace.  The treasures here, by\r\nsimple weight, without counting workmanship, were valued at fifty\r\nmillions of francs!  If I could get the custody of them for a while, I\r\nfear me the market price of silver bishops would advance shortly, on\r\naccount of their exceeding scarcity in the Cathedral of Milan.\r\n\r\nThe priests showed us two of St. Paul's fingers, and one of St. Peter's;\r\na bone of Judas Iscariot, (it was black,) and also bones of all the other\r\ndisciples; a handkerchief in which the Saviour had left the impression of\r\nhis face.  Among the most precious of the relics were a stone from the\r\nHoly Sepulchre, part of the crown of thorns, (they have a whole one at\r\nNotre Dame,) a fragment of the purple robe worn by the Saviour, a nail\r\nfrom the Cross, and a picture of the Virgin and Child painted by the\r\nveritable hand of St. Luke.  This is the second of St. Luke's Virgins we\r\nhave seen.  Once a year all these holy relics are carried in procession\r\nthrough the streets of Milan.\r\n\r\nI like to revel in the dryest details of the great cathedral.  The\r\nbuilding is five hundred feet long by one hundred and eighty wide, and\r\nthe principal steeple is in the neighborhood of four hundred feet high.\r\nIt has 7,148 marble statues, and will have upwards of three thousand more\r\nwhen it is finished.  In addition it has one thousand five hundred\r\nbas-reliefs.  It has one hundred and thirty-six spires--twenty-one more\r\nare to be added.  Each spire is surmounted by a statue six and a half\r\nfeet high.  Every thing about the church is marble, and all from the\r\nsame quarry; it was bequeathed to the Archbishopric for this purpose\r\ncenturies ago.  So nothing but the mere workmanship costs; still that is\r\nexpensive--the bill foots up six hundred and eighty-four millions of\r\nfrancs thus far (considerably over a hundred millions of dollars,) and\r\nit is estimated that it will take a hundred and twenty years yet to\r\nfinish the cathedral.  It looks complete, but is far from being so.  We\r\nsaw a new statue put in its niche yesterday, alongside of one which had\r\nbeen standing these four hundred years, they said.  There are four\r\nstaircases leading up to the main steeple, each of which cost a hundred\r\nthousand dollars, with the four hundred and eight statues which adorn\r\nthem.  Marco Compioni was the architect who designed the wonderful\r\nstructure more than five hundred years ago, and it took him forty-six\r\nyears to work out the plan and get it ready to hand over to the\r\nbuilders.  He is dead now.  The building was begun a little less than\r\nfive hundred years ago, and the third generation hence will not see it\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nThe building looks best by moonlight, because the older portions of it,\r\nbeing stained with age, contrast unpleasantly with the newer and whiter\r\nportions.  It seems somewhat too broad for its height, but may be\r\nfamiliarity with it might dissipate this impression.\r\n\r\nThey say that the Cathedral of Milan is second only to St. Peter's at\r\nRome.  I cannot understand how it can be second to anything made by human\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nWe bid it good-bye, now--possibly for all time.  How surely, in some\r\nfuture day, when the memory of it shall have lost its vividness, shall we\r\nhalf believe we have seen it in a wonderful dream, but never with waking\r\neyes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wis zo haut can be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was what the guide asked when we were looking up at the bronze\r\nhorses on the Arch of Peace.  It meant, do you wish to go up there?\r\nI give it as a specimen of guide-English.  These are the people that make\r\nlife a burthen to the tourist.  Their tongues are never still.  They talk\r\nforever and forever, and that is the kind of billingsgate they use.\r\nInspiration itself could hardly comprehend them.  If they would only show\r\nyou a masterpiece of art, or a venerable tomb, or a prison-house, or a\r\nbattle-field, hallowed by touching memories or historical reminiscences,\r\nor grand traditions, and then step aside and hold still for ten minutes\r\nand let you think, it would not be so bad.  But they interrupt every\r\ndream, every pleasant train of thought, with their tiresome cackling.\r\nSometimes when I have been standing before some cherished old idol of\r\nmine that I remembered years and years ago in pictures in the geography\r\nat school, I have thought I would give a whole world if the human parrot\r\nat my side would suddenly perish where he stood and leave me to gaze, and\r\nponder, and worship.\r\n\r\nNo, we did not \xe2\x80\x9cwis zo haut can be.\xe2\x80\x9d  We wished to go to La Scala, the\r\nlargest theater in the world, I think they call it.  We did so.  It was a\r\nlarge place.  Seven separate and distinct masses of humanity--six great\r\ncircles and a monster parquette.\r\n\r\nWe wished to go to the Ambrosian Library, and we did that also.  We saw a\r\nmanuscript of Virgil, with annotations in the handwriting of Petrarch,\r\nthe gentleman who loved another man's Laura, and lavished upon her all\r\nthrough life a love which was a clear waste of the raw material.  It was\r\nsound sentiment, but bad judgment.  It brought both parties fame, and\r\ncreated a fountain of commiseration for them in sentimental breasts that\r\nis running yet.  But who says a word in behalf of poor Mr. Laura?  (I do\r\nnot know his other name.)  Who glorifies him?  Who bedews him with tears?\r\nWho writes poetry about him?  Nobody.  How do you suppose he liked the\r\nstate of things that has given the world so much pleasure?  How did he\r\nenjoy having another man following his wife every where and making her\r\nname a familiar word in every garlic-exterminating mouth in Italy with\r\nhis sonnets to her pre-empted eyebrows?  They got fame and sympathy--he\r\ngot neither.  This is a peculiarly felicitous instance of what is called\r\npoetical justice.  It is all very fine; but it does not chime with my\r\nnotions of right.  It is too one-sided--too ungenerous.\r\n\r\nLet the world go on fretting about Laura and Petrarch if it will; but as\r\nfor me, my tears and my lamentations shall be lavished upon the unsung\r\ndefendant.\r\n\r\nWe saw also an autograph letter of Lucrezia Borgia, a lady for whom I\r\nhave always entertained the highest respect, on account of her rare\r\nhistrionic capabilities, her opulence in solid gold goblets made of\r\ngilded wood, her high distinction as an operatic screamer, and the\r\nfacility with which she could order a sextuple funeral and get the\r\ncorpses ready for it.  We saw one single coarse yellow hair from\r\nLucrezia's head, likewise.  It awoke emotions, but we still live.  In\r\nthis same library we saw some drawings by Michael Angelo (these Italians\r\ncall him Mickel Angelo,) and Leonardo da Vinci.  (They spell it Vinci and\r\npronounce it Vinchy; foreigners always spell better than they pronounce.)\r\nWe reserve our opinion of these sketches.\r\n\r\nIn another building they showed us a fresco representing some lions and\r\nother beasts drawing chariots; and they seemed to project so far from the\r\nwall that we took them to be sculptures.  The artist had shrewdly\r\nheightened the delusion by painting dust on the creatures' backs, as if\r\nit had fallen there naturally and properly.  Smart fellow--if it be smart\r\nto deceive strangers.\r\n\r\nElsewhere we saw a huge Roman amphitheatre, with its stone seats still in\r\ngood preservation.  Modernized, it is now the scene of more peaceful\r\nrecreations than the exhibition of a party of wild beasts with Christians\r\nfor dinner.  Part of the time, the Milanese use it for a race track, and\r\nat other seasons they flood it with water and have spirited yachting\r\nregattas there.  The guide told us these things, and he would hardly try\r\nso hazardous an experiment as the telling of a falsehood, when it is all\r\nhe can do to speak the truth in English without getting the lock-jaw.\r\n\r\nIn another place we were shown a sort of summer arbor, with a fence\r\nbefore it.  We said that was nothing.  We looked again, and saw, through\r\nthe arbor, an endless stretch of garden, and shrubbery, and grassy lawn.\r\nWe were perfectly willing to go in there and rest, but it could not be\r\ndone.  It was only another delusion--a painting by some ingenious artist\r\nwith little charity in his heart for tired folk.  The deception was\r\nperfect.  No one could have imagined the park was not real.  We even\r\nthought we smelled the flowers at first.\r\n\r\nWe got a carriage at twilight and drove in the shaded avenues with the\r\nother nobility, and after dinner we took wine and ices in a fine garden\r\nwith the great public.  The music was excellent, the flowers and\r\nshrubbery were pleasant to the eye, the scene was vivacious, everybody\r\nwas genteel and well-behaved, and the ladies were slightly moustached,\r\nand handsomely dressed, but very homely.\r\n\r\nWe adjourned to a cafe and played billiards an hour, and I made six or\r\nseven points by the doctor pocketing his ball, and he made as many by my\r\npocketing my ball.  We came near making a carom sometimes, but not the\r\none we were trying to make.  The table was of the usual European style\r\n--cushions dead and twice as high as the balls; the cues in bad repair.\r\nThe natives play only a sort of pool on them.  We have never seen any\r\nbody playing the French three-ball game yet, and I doubt if there is any\r\nsuch game known in France, or that there lives any man mad enough to try\r\nto play it on one of these European tables.  We had to stop playing\r\nfinally because Dan got to sleeping fifteen minutes between the counts\r\nand paying no attention to his marking.\r\n\r\nAfterward we walked up and down one of the most popular streets for some\r\ntime, enjoying other people's comfort and wishing we could export some of\r\nit to our restless, driving, vitality-consuming marts at home.  Just in\r\nthis one matter lies the main charm of life in Europe--comfort.  In\r\nAmerica, we hurry--which is well; but when the day's work is done, we go\r\non thinking of losses and gains, we plan for the morrow, we even carry\r\nour business cares to bed with us, and toss and worry over them when we\r\nought to be restoring our racked bodies and brains with sleep.  We burn\r\nup our energies with these excitements, and either die early or drop into\r\na lean and mean old age at a time of life which they call a man's prime\r\nin Europe.  When an acre of ground has produced long and well, we let it\r\nlie fallow and rest for a season; we take no man clear across the\r\ncontinent in the same coach he started in--the coach is stabled somewhere\r\non the plains and its heated machinery allowed to cool for a few days;\r\nwhen a razor has seen long service and refuses to hold an edge, the\r\nbarber lays it away for a few weeks, and the edge comes back of its own\r\naccord.  We bestow thoughtful care upon inanimate objects, but none upon\r\nourselves.  What a robust people, what a nation of thinkers we might be,\r\nif we would only lay ourselves on the shelf occasionally and renew our\r\nedges!\r\n\r\nI do envy these Europeans the comfort they take.  When the work of the\r\nday is done, they forget it.  Some of them go, with wife and children, to\r\na beer hall and sit quietly and genteelly drinking a mug or two of ale\r\nand listening to music; others walk the streets, others drive in the\r\navenues; others assemble in the great ornamental squares in the early\r\nevening to enjoy the sight and the fragrance of flowers and to hear the\r\nmilitary bands play--no European city being without its fine military\r\nmusic at eventide; and yet others of the populace sit in the open air in\r\nfront of the refreshment houses and eat ices and drink mild beverages\r\nthat could not harm a child.  They go to bed moderately early, and sleep\r\nwell.  They are always quiet, always orderly, always cheerful,\r\ncomfortable, and appreciative of life and its manifold blessings.  One\r\nnever sees a drunken man among them.  The change that has come over our\r\nlittle party is surprising.  Day by day we lose some of our restlessness\r\nand absorb some of the spirit of quietude and ease that is in the\r\ntranquil atmosphere about us and in the demeanor of the people.  We grow\r\nwise apace.  We begin to comprehend what life is for.\r\n\r\nWe have had a bath in Milan, in a public bath-house.  They were going to\r\nput all three of us in one bath-tub, but we objected.  Each of us had an\r\nItalian farm on his back.  We could have felt affluent if we had been\r\nofficially surveyed and fenced in.  We chose to have three bathtubs, and\r\nlarge ones--tubs suited to the dignity of aristocrats who had real\r\nestate, and brought it with them.  After we were stripped and had taken\r\nthe first chilly dash, we discovered that haunting atrocity that has\r\nembittered our lives in so many cities and villages of Italy and France\r\n--there was no soap.  I called.  A woman answered, and I barely had time to\r\nthrow myself against the door--she would have been in, in another second.\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeware, woman!  Go away from here--go away, now, or it will be the worse\r\nfor you.  I am an unprotected male, but I will preserve my honor at the\r\nperil of my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words must have frightened her, for she skurried away very fast.\r\n\r\nDan's voice rose on the air:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, bring some soap, why don't you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reply was Italian.  Dan resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoap, you know--soap.  That is what I want--soap.  S-o-a-p, soap;\r\ns-o-p-e, soap; s-o-u-p, soap.  Hurry up!  I don't know how you Irish\r\nspell it, but I want it.  Spell it to suit yourself, but fetch it.\r\nI'm freezing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI heard the doctor say impressively:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDan, how often have we told you that these foreigners cannot understand\r\nEnglish?  Why will you not depend upon us?  Why will you not tell us what\r\nyou want, and let us ask for it in the language of the country?  It would\r\nsave us a great deal of the humiliation your reprehensible ignorance\r\ncauses us.  I will address this person in his mother tongue: 'Here,\r\ncospetto! corpo di Bacco!  Sacramento!  Solferino!--Soap, you son of a\r\ngun!'  Dan, if you would let us talk for you, you would never expose your\r\nignorant vulgarity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven this fluent discharge of Italian did not bring the soap at once, but\r\nthere was a good reason for it.  There was not such an article about the\r\nestablishment.  It is my belief that there never had been.  They had to\r\nsend far up town, and to several different places before they finally got\r\nit, so they said.  We had to wait twenty or thirty minutes.  The same\r\nthing had occurred the evening before, at the hotel.  I think I have\r\ndivined the reason for this state of things at last.  The English know\r\nhow to travel comfortably, and they carry soap with them; other\r\nforeigners do not use the article.\r\n\r\nAt every hotel we stop at we always have to send out for soap, at the\r\nlast moment, when we are grooming ourselves for dinner, and they put it\r\nin the bill along with the candles and other nonsense.  In Marseilles\r\nthey make half the fancy toilet soap we consume in America, but the\r\nMarseillaise only have a vague theoretical idea of its use, which they\r\nhave obtained from books of travel, just as they have acquired an\r\nuncertain notion of clean shirts, and the peculiarities of the gorilla,\r\nand other curious matters.  This reminds me of poor Blucher's note to the\r\nlandlord in Paris:\r\n\r\n     PARIS, le 7 Juillet.  Monsieur le Landlord--Sir: Pourquoi don't you\r\n     mettez some savon in your bed-chambers?  Est-ce que vous pensez I\r\n     will steal it?  La nuit passee you charged me pour deux chandelles\r\n     when I only had one; hier vous avez charged me avec glace when I had\r\n     none at all; tout les jours you are coming some fresh game or other\r\n     on me, mais vous ne pouvez pas play this savon dodge on me twice.\r\n     Savon is a necessary de la vie to any body but a Frenchman, et je\r\n     l'aurai hors de cet hotel or make trouble.  You hear me.  Allons.\r\n     BLUCHER.\r\n\r\nI remonstrated against the sending of this note, because it was so mixed\r\nup that the landlord would never be able to make head or tail of it; but\r\nBlucher said he guessed the old man could read the French of it and\r\naverage the rest.\r\n\r\nBlucher's French is bad enough, but it is not much worse than the English\r\none finds in advertisements all over Italy every day.  For instance,\r\nobserve the printed card of the hotel we shall probably stop at on the\r\nshores of Lake Como:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cNOTISH.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThis hotel which the best it is in Italy and most superb, is\r\n     handsome locate on the best situation of the lake, with the most\r\n     splendid view near the Villas Melzy, to the King of Belgian, and\r\n     Serbelloni.  This hotel have recently enlarge, do offer all\r\n     commodities on moderate price, at the strangers gentlemen who whish\r\n     spend the seasons on the Lake Come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow is that, for a specimen?  In the hotel is a handsome little chapel\r\nwhere an English clergyman is employed to preach to such of the guests of\r\nthe house as hail from England and America, and this fact is also set\r\nforth in barbarous English in the same advertisement.  Wouldn't you have\r\nsupposed that the adventurous linguist who framed the card would have\r\nknown enough to submit it to that clergyman before he sent it to the\r\nprinter?\r\n\r\nHere in Milan, in an ancient tumble-down ruin of a church, is the\r\nmournful wreck of the most celebrated painting in the world--\xe2\x80\x9cThe Last\r\nSupper,\xe2\x80\x9d by Leonardo da Vinci.  We are not infallible judges of pictures,\r\nbut of course we went there to see this wonderful painting, once so\r\nbeautiful, always so worshipped by masters in art, and forever to be\r\nfamous in song and story.  And the first thing that occurred was the\r\ninfliction on us of a placard fairly reeking with wretched English.  Take\r\na morsel of it: \xe2\x80\x9cBartholomew (that is the first figure on the left hand\r\nside at the spectator,) uncertain and doubtful about what he thinks to\r\nhave heard, and upon which he wants to be assured by himself at Christ\r\nand by no others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGood, isn't it?  And then Peter is described as \xe2\x80\x9cargumenting in a\r\nthreatening and angrily condition at Judas Iscariot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis paragraph recalls the picture.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Supper\xe2\x80\x9d is painted on the\r\ndilapidated wall of what was a little chapel attached to the main church\r\nin ancient times, I suppose.  It is battered and scarred in every\r\ndirection, and stained and discolored by time, and Napoleon's horses\r\nkicked the legs off most the disciples when they (the horses, not the\r\ndisciples,) were stabled there more than half a century ago.\r\n\r\nI recognized the old picture in a moment--the Saviour with bowed head\r\nseated at the centre of a long, rough table with scattering fruits and\r\ndishes upon it, and six disciples on either side in their long robes,\r\ntalking to each other--the picture from which all engravings and all\r\ncopies have been made for three centuries.  Perhaps no living man has\r\never known an attempt to paint the Lord's Supper differently.  The world\r\nseems to have become settled in the belief, long ago, that it is not\r\npossible for human genius to outdo this creation of da Vinci's.  I\r\nsuppose painters will go on copying it as long as any of the original is\r\nleft visible to the eye.  There were a dozen easels in the room, and as\r\nmany artists transferring the great picture to their canvases.  Fifty\r\nproofs of steel engravings and lithographs were scattered around, too.\r\nAnd as usual, I could not help noticing how superior the copies were to\r\nthe original, that is, to my inexperienced eye.  Wherever you find a\r\nRaphael, a Rubens, a Michelangelo, a Carracci, or a da Vinci (and we see\r\nthem every day,) you find artists copying them, and the copies are always\r\nthe handsomest.  Maybe the originals were handsome when they were new,\r\nbut they are not now.\r\n\r\nThis picture is about thirty feet long, and ten or twelve high, I should\r\nthink, and the figures are at least life size.  It is one of the largest\r\npaintings in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe colors are dimmed with age; the countenances are scaled and marred,\r\nand nearly all expression is gone from them; the hair is a dead blur upon\r\nthe wall, and there is no life in the eyes.  Only the attitudes are\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nPeople come here from all parts of the world, and glorify this\r\nmasterpiece.  They stand entranced before it with bated breath and parted\r\nlips, and when they speak, it is only in the catchy ejaculations of\r\nrapture:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, wonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch expression!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch grace of attitude!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch dignity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch faultless drawing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch matchless coloring!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch feeling!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat delicacy of touch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sublimity of conception!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA vision!  A vision!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI only envy these people; I envy them their honest admiration, if it be\r\nhonest--their delight, if they feel delight.  I harbor no animosity\r\ntoward any of them.  But at the same time the thought will intrude itself\r\nupon me, How can they see what is not visible?  What would you think of a\r\nman who looked at some decayed, blind, toothless, pock-marked Cleopatra,\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat matchless beauty!  What soul!  What expression!\xe2\x80\x9d  What\r\nwould you think of a man who gazed upon a dingy, foggy sunset, and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sublimity!  What feeling!  What richness of coloring!\xe2\x80\x9d  What would\r\nyou think of a man who stared in ecstasy upon a desert of stumps and\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my soul, my beating heart, what a noble forest is here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou would think that those men had an astonishing talent for seeing\r\nthings that had already passed away.  It was what I thought when I stood\r\nbefore \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Supper\xe2\x80\x9d and heard men apostrophizing wonders, and\r\nbeauties and perfections which had faded out of the picture and gone, a\r\nhundred years before they were born.  We can imagine the beauty that was\r\nonce in an aged face; we can imagine the forest if we see the stumps; but\r\nwe can not absolutely see these things when they are not there.  I am\r\nwilling to believe that the eye of the practiced artist can rest upon the\r\nLast Supper and renew a lustre where only a hint of it is left, supply a\r\ntint that has faded away, restore an expression that is gone; patch, and\r\ncolor, and add, to the dull canvas until at last its figures shall stand\r\nbefore him aglow with the life, the feeling, the freshness, yea, with all\r\nthe noble beauty that was theirs when first they came from the hand of\r\nthe master.  But I can not work this miracle.  Can those other uninspired\r\nvisitors do it, or do they only happily imagine they do?\r\n\r\nAfter reading so much about it, I am satisfied that the Last Supper was a\r\nvery miracle of art once.  But it was three hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nIt vexes me to hear people talk so glibly of \xe2\x80\x9cfeeling,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexpression,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9ctone,\xe2\x80\x9d and those other easily acquired and inexpensive technicalities of\r\nart that make such a fine show in conversations concerning pictures.\r\nThere is not one man in seventy-five hundred that can tell what a\r\npictured face is intended to express.  There is not one man in five\r\nhundred that can go into a court-room and be sure that he will not\r\nmistake some harmless innocent of a juryman for the black-hearted\r\nassassin on trial.  Yet such people talk of \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter\xe2\x80\x9d and presume to\r\ninterpret \xe2\x80\x9cexpression\xe2\x80\x9d in pictures.  There is an old story that Matthews,\r\nthe actor, was once lauding the ability of the human face to express the\r\npassions and emotions hidden in the breast.  He said the countenance\r\ncould disclose what was passing in the heart plainer than the tongue\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cobserve my face--what does it express?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDespair!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah, it expresses peaceful resignation!  What does this express?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff!  It means terror!  This!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImbecility!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool!  It is smothered ferocity!  Now this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, perdition!  Any ass can see it means insanity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nExpression!  People coolly pretend to read it who would think themselves\r\npresumptuous if they pretended to interpret the hieroglyphics on the\r\nobelisks of Luxor--yet they are fully as competent to do the one thing as\r\nthe other.  I have heard two very intelligent critics speak of Murillo's\r\nImmaculate Conception (now in the museum at Seville,) within the past few\r\ndays.  One said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the Virgin's face is full of the ecstasy of a joy that is complete\r\n--that leaves nothing more to be desired on earth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that wonderful face is so humble, so pleading--it says as plainly as\r\nwords could say it: 'I fear; I tremble; I am unworthy.  But Thy will be\r\ndone; sustain Thou Thy servant!'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reader can see the picture in any drawing-room; it can be easily\r\nrecognized: the Virgin (the only young and really beautiful Virgin that\r\nwas ever painted by one of the old masters, some of us think,) stands in\r\nthe crescent of the new moon, with a multitude of cherubs hovering about\r\nher, and more coming; her hands are crossed upon her breast, and upon her\r\nuplifted countenance falls a glory out of the heavens.  The reader may\r\namuse himself, if he chooses, in trying to determine which of these\r\ngentlemen read the Virgin's \xe2\x80\x9cexpression\xe2\x80\x9d aright, or if either of them did\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAny one who is acquainted with the old masters will comprehend how much\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Supper\xe2\x80\x9d is damaged when I say that the spectator can not really\r\ntell, now, whether the disciples are Hebrews or Italians.  These ancient\r\npainters never succeeded in denationalizing themselves.  The Italian\r\nartists painted Italian Virgins, the Dutch painted Dutch Virgins, the\r\nVirgins of the French painters were Frenchwomen--none of them ever put\r\ninto the face of the Madonna that indescribable something which proclaims\r\nthe Jewess, whether you find her in New York, in Constantinople, in\r\nParis, Jerusalem, or in the empire of Morocco.  I saw in the Sandwich\r\nIslands, once, a picture copied by a talented German artist from an\r\nengraving in one of the American illustrated papers.  It was an allegory,\r\nrepresenting Mr. Davis in the act of signing a secession act or some such\r\ndocument.  Over him hovered the ghost of Washington in warning attitude,\r\nand in the background a troop of shadowy soldiers in Continental uniform\r\nwere limping with shoeless, bandaged feet through a driving snow-storm.\r\nValley Forge was suggested, of course.  The copy seemed accurate, and yet\r\nthere was a discrepancy somewhere.  After a long examination I discovered\r\nwhat it was--the shadowy soldiers were all Germans!  Jeff Davis was a\r\nGerman! even the hovering ghost was a German ghost!  The artist had\r\nunconsciously worked his nationality into the picture.  To tell the\r\ntruth, I am getting a little perplexed about John the Baptist and his\r\nportraits.  In France I finally grew reconciled to him as a Frenchman;\r\nhere he is unquestionably an Italian.  What next?  Can it be possible\r\nthat the painters make John the Baptist a Spaniard in Madrid and an\r\nIrishman in Dublin?\r\n\r\nWe took an open barouche and drove two miles out of Milan to \xe2\x80\x9csee ze\r\necho,\xe2\x80\x9d as the guide expressed it.  The road was smooth, it was bordered\r\nby trees, fields, and grassy meadows, and the soft air was filled with\r\nthe odor of flowers.  Troops of picturesque peasant girls, coming from\r\nwork, hooted at us, shouted at us, made all manner of game of us, and\r\nentirely delighted me.  My long-cherished judgment was confirmed.  I\r\nalways did think those frowsy, romantic, unwashed peasant girls I had\r\nread so much about in poetry were a glaring fraud.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed our jaunt.  It was an exhilarating relief from tiresome\r\nsight-seeing.\r\n\r\nWe distressed ourselves very little about the astonishing echo the guide\r\ntalked so much about.  We were growing accustomed to encomiums on wonders\r\nthat too often proved no wonders at all.  And so we were most happily\r\ndisappointed to find in the sequel that the guide had even failed to rise\r\nto the magnitude of his subject.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at a tumble-down old rookery called the Palazzo Simonetti--a\r\nmassive hewn-stone affair occupied by a family of ragged Italians.\r\nA good-looking young girl conducted us to a window on the second floor\r\nwhich looked out on a court walled on three sides by tall buildings.  She\r\nput her head out at the window and shouted.  The echo answered more times\r\nthan we could count.  She took a speaking trumpet and through it she\r\nshouted, sharp and quick, a single \xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d  The echo answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!--ha!----ha!--ha!--ha!-ha! ha! h-a-a-a-a-a!\xe2\x80\x9d and finally went off\r\ninto a rollicking convulsion of the jolliest laughter that could be\r\nimagined.  It was so joyful--so long continued--so perfectly cordial and\r\nhearty, that every body was forced to join in.  There was no resisting\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThen the girl took a gun and fired it.  We stood ready to count the\r\nastonishing clatter of reverberations.  We could not say one, two, three,\r\nfast enough, but we could dot our notebooks with our pencil points almost\r\nrapidly enough to take down a sort of short-hand report of the result.\r\nMy page revealed the following account.  I could not keep up, but I did\r\nas well as I could.\r\n\r\nI set down fifty-two distinct repetitions, and then the echo got the\r\nadvantage of me.  The doctor set down sixty-four, and thenceforth the\r\necho moved too fast for him, also.  After the separate concussions could\r\nno longer be noted, the reverberations dwindled to a wild, long-sustained\r\nclatter of sounds such as a watchman's rattle produces.  It is likely\r\nthat this is the most remarkable echo in the world.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, in jest, offered to kiss the young girl, and was taken a\r\nlittle aback when she said he might for a franc!  The commonest gallantry\r\ncompelled him to stand by his offer, and so he paid the franc and took\r\nthe kiss.  She was a philosopher.  She said a franc was a good thing to\r\nhave, and she did not care any thing for one paltry kiss, because she had\r\na million left.  Then our comrade, always a shrewd businessman, offered\r\nto take the whole cargo at thirty days, but that little financial scheme\r\nwas a failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nWe left Milan by rail.  The Cathedral six or seven miles behind us; vast,\r\ndreamy, bluish, snow-clad mountains twenty miles in front of us,--these\r\nwere the accented points in the scenery.  The more immediate scenery\r\nconsisted of fields and farm-houses outside the car and a monster-headed\r\ndwarf and a moustached woman inside it.  These latter were not\r\nshow-people.  Alas, deformity and female beards are too common in Italy\r\nto attract attention.\r\n\r\nWe passed through a range of wild, picturesque hills, steep, wooded,\r\ncone-shaped, with rugged crags projecting here and there, and with\r\ndwellings and ruinous castles perched away up toward the drifting clouds.\r\nWe lunched at the curious old town of Como, at the foot of the lake, and\r\nthen took the small steamer and had an afternoon's pleasure excursion to\r\nthis place,--Bellaggio.\r\n\r\nWhen we walked ashore, a party of policemen (people whose cocked hats and\r\nshowy uniforms would shame the finest uniform in the military service of\r\nthe United States,) put us into a little stone cell and locked us in.  We\r\nhad the whole passenger list for company, but their room would have been\r\npreferable, for there was no light, there were no windows, no\r\nventilation.  It was close and hot.  We were much crowded.  It was the\r\nBlack Hole of Calcutta on a small scale.  Presently a smoke rose about\r\nour feet--a smoke that smelled of all the dead things of earth, of all\r\nthe putrefaction and corruption imaginable.\r\n\r\nWe were there five minutes, and when we got out it was hard to tell which\r\nof us carried the vilest fragrance.\r\n\r\nThese miserable outcasts called that \xe2\x80\x9cfumigating\xe2\x80\x9d us, and the term was a\r\ntame one indeed.  They fumigated us to guard themselves against the\r\ncholera, though we hailed from no infected port.  We had left the cholera\r\nfar behind us all the time.  However, they must keep epidemics away\r\nsomehow or other, and fumigation is cheaper than soap.  They must either\r\nwash themselves or fumigate other people.  Some of the lower classes had\r\nrather die than wash, but the fumigation of strangers causes them no\r\npangs.  They need no fumigation themselves.  Their habits make it\r\nunnecessary.  They carry their preventive with them; they sweat and\r\nfumigate all the day long.  I trust I am a humble and a consistent\r\nChristian.  I try to do what is right.  I know it is my duty to \xe2\x80\x9cpray for\r\nthem that despitefully use me;\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore, hard as it is, I shall\r\nstill try to pray for these fumigating, maccaroni-stuffing\r\norgan-grinders.\r\n\r\nOur hotel sits at the water's edge--at least its front garden does--and\r\nwe walk among the shrubbery and smoke at twilight; we look afar off at\r\nSwitzerland and the Alps, and feel an indolent willingness to look no\r\ncloser; we go down the steps and swim in the lake; we take a shapely\r\nlittle boat and sail abroad among the reflections of the stars; lie on\r\nthe thwarts and listen to the distant laughter, the singing, the soft\r\nmelody of flutes and guitars that comes floating across the water from\r\npleasuring gondolas; we close the evening with exasperating billiards on\r\none of those same old execrable tables.  A midnight luncheon in our ample\r\nbed-chamber; a final smoke in its contracted veranda facing the water,\r\nthe gardens, and the mountains; a summing up of the day's events.  Then\r\nto bed, with drowsy brains harassed with a mad panorama that mixes up\r\npictures of France, of Italy, of the ship, of the ocean, of home, in\r\ngrotesque and bewildering disorder.  Then a melting away of familiar\r\nfaces, of cities, and of tossing waves, into a great calm of\r\nforgetfulness and peace.\r\n\r\nAfter which, the nightmare.\r\n\r\nBreakfast in the morning, and then the lake.\r\n\r\nI did not like it yesterday.  I thought Lake Tahoe was much finer.\r\nI have to confess now, however, that my judgment erred somewhat, though\r\nnot extravagantly.  I always had an idea that Como was a vast basin of\r\nwater, like Tahoe, shut in by great mountains.  Well, the border of huge\r\nmountains is here, but the lake itself is not a basin.  It is as crooked\r\nas any brook, and only from one-quarter to two-thirds as wide as the\r\nMississippi.  There is not a yard of low ground on either side of it\r\n--nothing but endless chains of mountains that spring abruptly from the\r\nwater's edge and tower to altitudes varying from a thousand to two\r\nthousand feet.  Their craggy sides are clothed with vegetation, and white\r\nspecks of houses peep out from the luxuriant foliage everywhere; they are\r\neven perched upon jutting and picturesque pinnacles a thousand feet above\r\nyour head.\r\n\r\nAgain, for miles along the shores, handsome country seats, surrounded by\r\ngardens and groves, sit fairly in the water, sometimes in nooks carved by\r\nNature out of the vine-hung precipices, and with no ingress or egress\r\nsave by boats.  Some have great broad stone staircases leading down to\r\nthe water, with heavy stone balustrades ornamented with statuary and\r\nfancifully adorned with creeping vines and bright-colored flowers--for\r\nall the world like a drop curtain in a theatre, and lacking nothing but\r\nlong-waisted, high-heeled women and plumed gallants in silken tights\r\ncoming down to go serenading in the splendid gondola in waiting.\r\n\r\nA great feature of Como's attractiveness is the multitude of pretty\r\nhouses and gardens that cluster upon its shores and on its mountain\r\nsides.  They look so snug and so homelike, and at eventide when every\r\nthing seems to slumber, and the music of the vesper bells comes stealing\r\nover the water, one almost believes that nowhere else than on the lake of\r\nComo can there be found such a paradise of tranquil repose.\r\n\r\nFrom my window here in Bellaggio, I have a view of the other side of the\r\nlake now, which is as beautiful as a picture.  A scarred and wrinkled\r\nprecipice rises to a height of eighteen hundred feet; on a tiny bench\r\nhalf way up its vast wall, sits a little snowflake of a church, no bigger\r\nthan a martin-box, apparently; skirting the base of the cliff are a\r\nhundred orange groves and gardens, flecked with glimpses of the white\r\ndwellings that are buried in them; in front, three or four gondolas lie\r\nidle upon the water--and in the burnished mirror of the lake, mountain,\r\nchapel, houses, groves and boats are counterfeited so brightly and so\r\nclearly that one scarce knows where the reality leaves off and the\r\nreflection begins!\r\n\r\nThe surroundings of this picture are fine.  A mile away, a grove-plumed\r\npromontory juts far into the lake and glasses its palace in the blue\r\ndepths; in midstream a boat is cutting the shining surface and leaving a\r\nlong track behind, like a ray of light; the mountains beyond are veiled\r\nin a dreamy purple haze; far in the opposite direction a tumbled mass of\r\ndomes and verdant slopes and valleys bars the lake, and here indeed does\r\ndistance lend enchantment to the view--for on this broad canvas, sun and\r\nclouds and the richest of atmospheres have blended a thousand tints\r\ntogether, and over its surface the filmy lights and shadows drift, hour\r\nafter hour, and glorify it with a beauty that seems reflected out of\r\nHeaven itself.  Beyond all question, this is the most voluptuous scene we\r\nhave yet looked upon.\r\n\r\nLast night the scenery was striking and picturesque.  On the other side\r\ncrags and trees and snowy houses were reflected in the lake with a\r\nwonderful distinctness, and streams of light from many a distant window\r\nshot far abroad over the still waters.  On this side, near at hand, great\r\nmansions, white with moonlight, glared out from the midst of masses of\r\nfoliage that lay black and shapeless in the shadows that fell from the\r\ncliff above--and down in the margin of the lake every feature of the\r\nweird vision was faithfully repeated.\r\n\r\nToday we have idled through a wonder of a garden attached to a ducal\r\nestate--but enough of description is enough, I judge.\r\n\r\nI suspect that this was the same place the gardener's son deceived the\r\nLady of Lyons with, but I do not know.  You may have heard of the passage\r\nsomewhere:\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cA deep vale,\r\n          Shut out by Alpine hills from the rude world,\r\n          Near a clear lake margined by fruits of gold\r\n          And whispering myrtles:\r\n          Glassing softest skies, cloudless,\r\n          Save with rare and roseate shadows;\r\n          A palace, lifting to eternal heaven its marbled walls,\r\n          From out a glossy bower of coolest foliage musical with birds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat is all very well, except the \xe2\x80\x9cclear\xe2\x80\x9d part of the lake.  It certainly\r\nis clearer than a great many lakes, but how dull its waters are compared\r\nwith the wonderful transparence of Lake Tahoe!  I speak of the north\r\nshore of Tahoe, where one can count the scales on a trout at a depth of a\r\nhundred and eighty feet.  I have tried to get this statement off at par\r\nhere, but with no success; so I have been obliged to negotiate it at\r\nfifty percent discount.  At this rate I find some takers; perhaps the\r\nreader will receive it on the same terms--ninety feet instead of one\r\nhundred and eighty.  But let it be remembered that those are forced\r\nterms--Sheriff's sale prices.  As far as I am privately concerned, I\r\nabate not a jot of the original assertion that in those strangely\r\nmagnifying waters one may count the scales on a trout (a trout of the\r\nlarge kind,) at a depth of a hundred and eighty feet--may see every\r\npebble on the bottom--might even count a paper of dray-pins.  People talk\r\nof the transparent waters of the Mexican Bay of Acapulco, but in my own\r\nexperience I know they cannot compare with those I am speaking of.  I\r\nhave fished for trout, in Tahoe, and at a measured depth of eighty-four\r\nfeet I have seen them put their noses to the bait and I could see their\r\ngills open and shut.  I could hardly have seen the trout themselves at\r\nthat distance in the open air.\r\n\r\nAs I go back in spirit and recall that noble sea, reposing among the\r\nsnow-peaks six thousand feet above the ocean, the conviction comes strong\r\nupon me again that Como would only seem a bedizened little courtier in\r\nthat august presence.\r\n\r\nSorrow and misfortune overtake the legislature that still from year to\r\nyear permits Tahoe to retain its unmusical cognomen!  Tahoe!  It suggests\r\nno crystal waters, no picturesque shores, no sublimity.  Tahoe for a sea\r\nin the clouds: a sea that has character and asserts it in solemn calms at\r\ntimes, at times in savage storms; a sea whose royal seclusion is guarded\r\nby a cordon of sentinel peaks that lift their frosty fronts nine thousand\r\nfeet above the level world; a sea whose every aspect is impressive, whose\r\nbelongings are all beautiful, whose lonely majesty types the Deity!\r\n\r\nTahoe means grasshoppers.  It means grasshopper soup.  It is Indian, and\r\nsuggestive of Indians.  They say it is Pi-ute--possibly it is Digger.\r\nI am satisfied it was named by the Diggers--those degraded savages who\r\nroast their dead relatives, then mix the human grease and ashes of bones\r\nwith tar, and \xe2\x80\x9cgaum\xe2\x80\x9d it thick all over their heads and foreheads and\r\nears, and go caterwauling about the hills and call it mourning.  These\r\nare the gentry that named the Lake.\r\n\r\nPeople say that Tahoe means \xe2\x80\x9cSilver Lake\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cLimpid Water\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cFalling\r\nLeaf.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bosh.  It means grasshopper soup, the favorite dish of the Digger\r\ntribe,--and of the Pi-utes as well.  It isn't worth while, in these\r\npractical times, for people to talk about Indian poetry--there never was\r\nany in them--except in the Fenimore Cooper Indians.  But they are an\r\nextinct tribe that never existed.  I know the Noble Red Man.  I have\r\ncamped with the Indians; I have been on the warpath with them, taken part\r\nin the chase with them--for grasshoppers; helped them steal cattle; I\r\nhave roamed with them, scalped them, had them for breakfast.  I would\r\ngladly eat the whole race if I had a chance.\r\n\r\nBut I am growing unreliable.  I will return to my comparison of the\r\nlakes.  Como is a little deeper than Tahoe, if people here tell the\r\ntruth.  They say it is eighteen hundred feet deep at this point, but it\r\ndoes not look a dead enough blue for that.  Tahoe is one thousand five\r\nhundred and twenty-five feet deep in the centre, by the state geologist's\r\nmeasurement.  They say the great peak opposite this town is five thousand\r\nfeet high: but I feel sure that three thousand feet of that statement is\r\na good honest lie.  The lake is a mile wide, here, and maintains about\r\nthat width from this point to its northern extremity--which is distant\r\nsixteen miles: from here to its southern extremity--say fifteen miles--it\r\nis not over half a mile wide in any place, I should think.  Its snow-clad\r\nmountains one hears so much about are only seen occasionally, and then in\r\nthe distance, the Alps.  Tahoe is from ten to eighteen miles wide, and\r\nits mountains shut it in like a wall.  Their summits are never free from\r\nsnow the year round.  One thing about it is very strange: it never has\r\neven a skim of ice upon its surface, although lakes in the same range of\r\nmountains, lying in a lower and warmer temperature, freeze over in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nIt is cheerful to meet a shipmate in these out-of-the-way places and\r\ncompare notes with him.  We have found one of ours here--an old soldier\r\nof the war, who is seeking bloodless adventures and rest from his\r\ncampaigns in these sunny lands.--[Colonel J.  HERON FOSTER, editor of a\r\nPittsburgh journal, and a most estimable gentleman.  As these sheets are\r\nbeing prepared for the press I am pained to learn of his decease shortly\r\nafter his return home--M.T.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nWe voyaged by steamer down the Lago di Lecco, through wild mountain\r\nscenery, and by hamlets and villas, and disembarked at the town of Lecco.\r\nThey said it was two hours, by carriage to the ancient city of Bergamo,\r\nand that we would arrive there in good season for the railway train.  We\r\ngot an open barouche and a wild, boisterous driver, and set out.  It was\r\ndelightful.  We had a fast team and a perfectly smooth road.  There were\r\ntowering cliffs on our left, and the pretty Lago di Lecco on our right,\r\nand every now and then it rained on us.  Just before starting, the driver\r\npicked up, in the street, a stump of a cigar an inch long, and put it in\r\nhis mouth.  When he had carried it thus about an hour, I thought it would\r\nbe only Christian charity to give him a light.  I handed him my cigar,\r\nwhich I had just lit, and he put it in his mouth and returned his stump\r\nto his pocket!  I never saw a more sociable man.  At least I never saw a\r\nman who was more sociable on a short acquaintance.\r\n\r\nWe saw interior Italy, now.  The houses were of solid stone, and not\r\noften in good repair.  The peasants and their children were idle, as a\r\ngeneral thing, and the donkeys and chickens made themselves at home in\r\ndrawing-room and bed-chamber and were not molested.  The drivers of each\r\nand every one of the slow-moving market-carts we met were stretched in\r\nthe sun upon their merchandise, sound a sleep.  Every three or four\r\nhundred yards, it seemed to me, we came upon the shrine of some saint or\r\nother--a rude picture of him built into a huge cross or a stone pillar by\r\nthe road-side.--Some of the pictures of the Saviour were curiosities in\r\ntheir way.  They represented him stretched upon the cross, his\r\ncountenance distorted with agony.  From the wounds of the crown of\r\nthorns; from the pierced side; from the mutilated hands and feet; from\r\nthe scourged body--from every hand-breadth of his person streams of blood\r\nwere flowing!  Such a gory, ghastly spectacle would frighten the children\r\nout of their senses, I should think.  There were some unique auxiliaries\r\nto the painting which added to its spirited effect.  These were genuine\r\nwooden and iron implements, and were prominently disposed round about the\r\nfigure: a bundle of nails; the hammer to drive them; the sponge; the reed\r\nthat supported it; the cup of vinegar; the ladder for the ascent of the\r\ncross; the spear that pierced the Saviour's side.  The crown of thorns\r\nwas made of real thorns, and was nailed to the sacred head.  In some\r\nItalian church-paintings, even by the old masters, the Saviour and the\r\nVirgin wear silver or gilded crowns that are fastened to the pictured\r\nhead with nails.  The effect is as grotesque as it is incongruous.\r\n\r\nHere and there, on the fronts of roadside inns, we found huge, coarse\r\nfrescoes of suffering martyrs like those in the shrines.  It could not\r\nhave diminished their sufferings any to be so uncouthly represented.\r\nWe were in the heart and home of priest craft--of a happy, cheerful,\r\ncontented ignorance, superstition, degradation, poverty, indolence, and\r\neverlasting unaspiring worthlessness.  And we said fervently: it suits\r\nthese people precisely; let them enjoy it, along with the other animals,\r\nand Heaven forbid that they be molested.  We feel no malice toward these\r\nfumigators.\r\n\r\nWe passed through the strangest, funniest, undreampt-of old towns, wedded\r\nto the customs and steeped in the dreams of the elder ages, and perfectly\r\nunaware that the world turns round!  And perfectly indifferent, too, as\r\nto whether it turns around or stands still.  They have nothing to do but\r\neat and sleep and sleep and eat, and toil a little when they can get a\r\nfriend to stand by and keep them awake.  They are not paid for thinking\r\n--they are not paid to fret about the world's concerns.  They were not\r\nrespectable people--they were not worthy people--they were not learned\r\nand wise and brilliant people--but in their breasts, all their stupid\r\nlives long, resteth a peace that passeth understanding!  How can men,\r\ncalling themselves men, consent to be so degraded and happy.\r\n\r\nWe whisked by many a gray old medieval castle, clad thick with ivy that\r\nswung its green banners down from towers and turrets where once some old\r\nCrusader's flag had floated.  The driver pointed to one of these ancient\r\nfortresses, and said, (I translate):\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see that great iron hook that projects from the wall just under\r\nthe highest window in the ruined tower?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe said we could not see it at such a distance, but had no doubt it was\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a legend connected with that iron hook.\r\nNearly seven hundred years ago, that castle was the property of the noble\r\nCount Luigi Gennaro Guido Alphonso di Genova----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was his other name?\xe2\x80\x9d  said Dan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had no other name.  The name I have spoken was all the name he had.\r\nHe was the son of----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor but honest parents--that is all right--never mind the particulars\r\n--go on with the legend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                               THE LEGEND.\r\n\r\nWell, then, all the world, at that time, was in a wild excitement about\r\nthe Holy Sepulchre.  All the great feudal lords in Europe were pledging\r\ntheir lands and pawning their plate to fit out men-at-arms so that they\r\nmight join the grand armies of Christendom and win renown in the Holy\r\nWars.  The Count Luigi raised money, like the rest, and one mild\r\nSeptember morning, armed with battle-ax, portcullis and thundering\r\nculverin, he rode through the greaves and bucklers of his donjon-keep\r\nwith as gallant a troop of Christian bandits as ever stepped in Italy.\r\nHe had his sword, Excalibur, with him.  His beautiful countess and her\r\nyoung daughter waved him a tearful adieu from the battering-rams and\r\nbuttresses of the fortress, and he galloped away with a happy heart.\r\n\r\nHe made a raid on a neighboring baron and completed his outfit with the\r\nbooty secured.  He then razed the castle to the ground, massacred the\r\nfamily and moved on.  They were hardy fellows in the grand old days of\r\nchivalry.  Alas!  Those days will never come again.\r\n\r\nCount Luigi grew high in fame in Holy Land.  He plunged into the carnage\r\nof a hundred battles, but his good Excalibur always brought him out\r\nalive, albeit often sorely wounded.  His face became browned by exposure\r\nto the Syrian sun in long marches; he suffered hunger and thirst; he\r\npined in prisons, he languished in loathsome plague-hospitals.  And many\r\nand many a time he thought of his loved ones at home, and wondered if all\r\nwas well with them.  But his heart said, Peace, is not thy brother\r\nwatching over thy household?\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nForty-two years waxed and waned; the good fight was won; Godfrey reigned\r\nin Jerusalem--the Christian hosts reared the banner of the cross above\r\nthe Holy Sepulchre!\r\n\r\nTwilight was approaching.  Fifty harlequins, in flowing robes, approached\r\nthis castle wearily, for they were on foot, and the dust upon their\r\ngarments betokened that they had traveled far.  They overtook a peasant,\r\nand asked him if it were likely they could get food and a hospitable bed\r\nthere, for love of Christian charity, and if perchance, a moral parlor\r\nentertainment might meet with generous countenance--\xe2\x80\x9cfor,\xe2\x80\x9d said they,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthis exhibition hath no feature that could offend the most fastidious\r\ntaste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth the peasant, \xe2\x80\x9can' it please your worships, ye had better\r\njourney many a good rood hence with your juggling circus than trust your\r\nbones in yonder castle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow now, sirrah!\xe2\x80\x9d  exclaimed the chief monk, \xe2\x80\x9cexplain thy ribald speech,\r\nor by'r Lady it shall go hard with thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, good mountebank, I did but utter the truth that was in my heart.\r\nSan Paolo be my witness that did ye but find the stout Count Leonardo in\r\nhis cups, sheer from the castle's topmost battlements would he hurl ye\r\nall!  Alack-a-day, the good Lord Luigi reigns not here in these sad\r\ntimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe good Lord Luigi?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, none other, please your worship.  In his day, the poor rejoiced in\r\nplenty and the rich he did oppress; taxes were not known, the fathers of\r\nthe church waxed fat upon his bounty; travelers went and came, with none\r\nto interfere; and whosoever would, might tarry in his halls in cordial\r\nwelcome, and eat his bread and drink his wine, withal.  But woe is me!\r\nsome two and forty years agone the good count rode hence to fight for\r\nHoly Cross, and many a year hath flown since word or token have we had of\r\nhim.  Men say his bones lie bleaching in the fields of Palestine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow!  God 'a mercy, the cruel Leonardo lords it in the castle.  He\r\nwrings taxes from the poor; he robs all travelers that journey by his\r\ngates; he spends his days in feuds and murders, and his nights in revel\r\nand debauch; he roasts the fathers of the church upon his kitchen spits,\r\nand enjoyeth the same, calling it pastime.  These thirty years Luigi's\r\ncountess hath not been seen by any in all this land, and many\r\nwhisper that she pines in the dungeons of the castle for that she will\r\nnot wed with Leonardo, saying her dear lord still liveth and that she\r\nwill die ere she prove false to him.  They whisper likewise that her\r\ndaughter is a prisoner as well.  Nay, good jugglers, seek ye refreshment\r\nother wheres.  'Twere better that ye perished in a Christian way than\r\nthat ye plunged from off yon dizzy tower.  Give ye good-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod keep ye, gentle knave--farewell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut heedless of the peasant's warning, the players moved straightway\r\ntoward the castle.\r\n\r\nWord was brought to Count Leonardo that a company of mountebanks besought\r\nhis hospitality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Tis well.  Dispose of them in the customary manner.  Yet stay!  I have\r\nneed of them.  Let them come hither.  Later, cast them from the\r\nbattlements--or--how many priests have ye on hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day's results are meagre, good my lord.  An abbot and a dozen\r\nbeggarly friars is all we have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHell and furies!  Is the estate going to seed?  Send hither the\r\nmountebanks.  Afterward, broil them with the priests.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe robed and close-cowled harlequins entered.  The grim Leonardo sate in\r\nstate at the head of his council board.  Ranged up and down the hall on\r\neither hand stood near a hundred men-at-arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, villains!\xe2\x80\x9d  quoth the count, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can ye do to earn the hospitality\r\nye crave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDread lord and mighty, crowded audiences have greeted our humble efforts\r\nwith rapturous applause.  Among our body count we the versatile and\r\ntalented Ugolino; the justly celebrated Rodolpho; the gifted and\r\naccomplished Roderigo; the management have spared neither pains nor\r\nexpense--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cS'death!  What can ye do?  Curb thy prating tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood my lord, in acrobatic feats, in practice with the dumb-bells, in\r\nbalancing and ground and lofty tumbling are we versed--and sith your\r\nhighness asketh me, I venture here to publish that in the truly marvelous\r\nand entertaining Zampillaerostation--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGag him! throttle him!  Body of Bacchus! am I a dog that I am to be\r\nassailed with polysyllabled blasphemy like to this?  But hold!  Lucretia,\r\nIsabel, stand forth!  Sirrah, behold this dame, this weeping wench.  The\r\nfirst I marry, within the hour; the other shall dry her tears or feed the\r\nvultures.  Thou and thy vagabonds shall crown the wedding with thy\r\nmerry-makings.  Fetch hither the priest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dame sprang toward the chief player.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, save me!\xe2\x80\x9d  she cried; \xe2\x80\x9csave me from a fate far worse than death!\r\nBehold these sad eyes, these sunken cheeks, this withered frame!  See\r\nthou the wreck this fiend hath made, and let thy heart be moved with\r\npity!  Look upon this damosel; note her wasted form, her halting step,\r\nher bloomless cheeks where youth should blush and happiness exult in\r\nsmiles!  Hear us and have compassion.  This monster was my husband's\r\nbrother.  He who should have been our shield against all harm, hath kept\r\nus shut within the noisome caverns of his donjon-keep for lo these thirty\r\nyears.  And for what crime?  None other than that I would not belie my\r\ntroth, root out my strong love for him who marches with the legions of\r\nthe cross in Holy Land, (for O, he is not dead!) and wed with him!  Save\r\nus, O, save thy persecuted suppliants!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flung herself at his feet and clasped his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!-ha!-ha!\xe2\x80\x9d  shouted the brutal Leonardo.  \xe2\x80\x9cPriest, to thy work!\xe2\x80\x9d  and\r\nhe dragged the weeping dame from her refuge.  \xe2\x80\x9cSay, once for all, will\r\nyou be mine?--for by my halidome, that breath that uttereth thy refusal\r\nshall be thy last on earth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNE-VER?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen die!\xe2\x80\x9d and the sword leaped from its scabbard.\r\n\r\nQuicker than thought, quicker than the lightning's flash, fifty monkish\r\nhabits disappeared, and fifty knights in splendid armor stood revealed!\r\nfifty falchions gleamed in air above the men-at-arms, and brighter,\r\nfiercer than them all, flamed Excalibur aloft, and cleaving downward\r\nstruck the brutal Leonardo's weapon from his grasp!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Luigi to the rescue!

The practiced\r\nknights from Palestine made holyday sport of carving the awkward\r\nmen-at-arms into chops and steaks.  The victory was complete.  Happiness\r\nreigned.  The knights all married the daughter.

The place has thirty or forty thousand inhabitants and is\r\nremarkable for being the birthplace of harlequin.  When we discovered\r\nthat, that legend of our driver took to itself a new interest in our\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nRested and refreshed, we took the rail happy and contented.  I shall not\r\ntarry to speak of the handsome Lago di Gardi; its stately castle that\r\nholds in its stony bosom the secrets of an age so remote that even\r\ntradition goeth not back to it; the imposing mountain scenery that\r\nennobles the landscape thereabouts; nor yet of ancient Padua or haughty\r\nVerona; nor of their Montagues and Capulets, their famous balconies and\r\ntombs of Juliet and Romeo et al., but hurry straight to the ancient city\r\nof the sea, the widowed bride of the Adriatic.  It was a long, long ride.\r\nBut toward evening, as we sat silent and hardly conscious of where we\r\nwere--subdued into that meditative calm that comes so surely after a\r\nconversational storm--some one shouted--\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVENICE!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough, afloat on the placid sea a league away, lay a great\r\ncity, with its towers and domes and steeples drowsing in a golden mist of\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nThis Venice, which was a haughty, invincible, magnificent Republic for\r\nnearly fourteen hundred years; whose armies compelled the world's\r\napplause whenever and wherever they battled; whose navies well nigh held\r\ndominion of the seas, and whose merchant fleets whitened the remotest\r\noceans with their sails and loaded these piers with the products of every\r\nclime, is fallen a prey to poverty, neglect and melancholy decay.  Six\r\nhundred years ago, Venice was the Autocrat of Commerce; her mart was the\r\ngreat commercial centre, the distributing-house from whence the enormous\r\ntrade of the Orient was spread abroad over the Western world.  To-day her\r\npiers are deserted, her warehouses are empty, her merchant fleets are\r\nvanished, her armies and her navies are but memories.  Her glory is\r\ndeparted, and with her crumbling grandeur of wharves and palaces about\r\nher she sits among her stagnant lagoons, forlorn and beggared, forgotten\r\nof the world.  She that in her palmy days commanded the commerce of a\r\nhemisphere and made the weal or woe of nations with a beck of her\r\npuissant finger, is become the humblest among the peoples of the earth,\r\n--a peddler of glass beads for women, and trifling toys and trinkets for\r\nschool-girls and children.\r\n\r\nThe venerable Mother of the Republics is scarce a fit subject for\r\nflippant speech or the idle gossipping of tourists.  It seems a sort of\r\nsacrilege to disturb the glamour of old romance that pictures her to us\r\nsoftly from afar off as through a tinted mist, and curtains her ruin and\r\nher desolation from our view.  One ought, indeed, to turn away from her\r\nrags, her poverty and her humiliation, and think of her only as she was\r\nwhen she sunk the fleets of Charlemagne; when she humbled Frederick\r\nBarbarossa or waved her victorious banners above the battlements of\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nWe reached Venice at eight in the evening, and entered a hearse belonging\r\nto the Grand Hotel d'Europe.  At any rate, it was more like a hearse than\r\nany thing else, though to speak by the card, it was a gondola.  And this\r\nwas the storied gondola of Venice!--the fairy boat in which the princely\r\ncavaliers of the olden time were wont to cleave the waters of the moonlit\r\ncanals and look the eloquence of love into the soft eyes of patrician\r\nbeauties, while the gay gondolier in silken doublet touched his guitar\r\nand sang as only gondoliers can sing!  This the famed gondola and this\r\nthe gorgeous gondolier!--the one an inky, rusty old canoe with a sable\r\nhearse-body clapped on to the middle of it, and the other a mangy,\r\nbarefooted guttersnipe with a portion of his raiment on exhibition which\r\nshould have been sacred from public scrutiny.  Presently, as he turned a\r\ncorner and shot his hearse into a dismal ditch between two long rows of\r\ntowering, untenanted buildings, the gay gondolier began to sing, true to\r\nthe traditions of his race.  I stood it a little while.  Then I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, here, Roderigo Gonzales Michael Angelo, I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a\r\nstranger, but I am not going to have my feelings lacerated by any such\r\ncaterwauling as that.  If that goes on, one of us has got to take water.\r\nIt is enough that my cherished dreams of Venice have been blighted\r\nforever as to the romantic gondola and the gorgeous gondolier; this\r\nsystem of destruction shall go no farther; I will accept the hearse,\r\nunder protest, and you may fly your flag of truce in peace, but here I\r\nregister a dark and bloody oath that you shan't sing.  Another yelp, and\r\noverboard you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began to feel that the old Venice of song and story had departed\r\nforever.  But I was too hasty.  In a few minutes we swept gracefully out\r\ninto the Grand Canal, and under the mellow moonlight the Venice of poetry\r\nand romance stood revealed.  Right from the water's edge rose long lines\r\nof stately palaces of marble; gondolas were gliding swiftly hither and\r\nthither and disappearing suddenly through unsuspected gates and alleys;\r\nponderous stone bridges threw their shadows athwart the glittering waves.\r\nThere was life and motion everywhere, and yet everywhere there was a\r\nhush, a stealthy sort of stillness, that was suggestive of secret\r\nenterprises of bravoes and of lovers; and clad half in moonbeams and half\r\nin mysterious shadows, the grim old mansions of the Republic seemed to\r\nhave an expression about them of having an eye out for just such\r\nenterprises as these at that same moment.  Music came floating over the\r\nwaters--Venice was complete.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful picture--very soft and dreamy and beautiful.  But what\r\nwas this Venice to compare with the Venice of midnight?  Nothing.  There\r\nwas a fete--a grand fete in honor of some saint who had been instrumental\r\nin checking the cholera three hundred years ago, and all Venice was\r\nabroad on the water.  It was no common affair, for the Venetians did not\r\nknow how soon they might need the saint's services again, now that the\r\ncholera was spreading every where.  So in one vast space--say a third of\r\na mile wide and two miles long--were collected two thousand gondolas, and\r\nevery one of them had from two to ten, twenty and even thirty colored\r\nlanterns suspended about it, and from four to a dozen occupants.  Just as\r\nfar as the eye could reach, these painted lights were massed together\r\n--like a vast garden of many-colored flowers, except that these blossoms\r\nwere never still; they were ceaselessly gliding in and out, and mingling\r\ntogether, and seducing you into bewildering attempts to follow their mazy\r\nevolutions.  Here and there a strong red, green, or blue glare from a\r\nrocket that was struggling to get away, splendidly illuminated all the\r\nboats around it.  Every gondola that swam by us, with its crescents and\r\npyramids and circles of colored lamps hung aloft, and lighting up the\r\nfaces of the young and the sweet-scented and lovely below, was a picture;\r\nand the reflections of those lights, so long, so slender, so numberless,\r\nso many-colored and so distorted and wrinkled by the waves, was a picture\r\nlikewise, and one that was enchantingly beautiful.  Many and many a party\r\nof young ladies and gentlemen had their state gondolas handsomely\r\ndecorated, and ate supper on board, bringing their swallow-tailed,\r\nwhite-cravatted varlets to wait upon them, and having their tables\r\ntricked out as if for a bridal supper.  They had brought along the\r\ncostly globe lamps from their drawing-rooms, and the lace and silken\r\ncurtains from the same places, I suppose.  And they had also brought\r\npianos and guitars, and they played and sang operas, while the plebeian\r\npaper-lanterned gondolas from the suburbs and the back alleys crowded\r\naround to stare and listen.\r\n\r\nThere was music every where--choruses, string bands, brass bands, flutes,\r\nevery thing.  I was so surrounded, walled in, with music, magnificence\r\nand loveliness, that I became inspired with the spirit of the scene, and\r\nsang one tune myself.  However, when I observed that the other gondolas\r\nhad sailed away, and my gondolier was preparing to go overboard, I\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nThe fete was magnificent.  They kept it up the whole night long, and I\r\nnever enjoyed myself better than I did while it lasted.\r\n\r\nWhat a funny old city this Queen of the Adriatic is!  Narrow streets,\r\nvast, gloomy marble palaces, black with the corroding damps of centuries,\r\nand all partly submerged; no dry land visible any where, and no sidewalks\r\nworth mentioning; if you want to go to church, to the theatre, or to the\r\nrestaurant, you must call a gondola.  It must be a paradise for cripples,\r\nfor verily a man has no use for legs here.\r\n\r\nFor a day or two the place looked so like an overflowed Arkansas town,\r\nbecause of its currentless waters laving the very doorsteps of all the\r\nhouses, and the cluster of boats made fast under the windows, or skimming\r\nin and out of the alleys and by-ways, that I could not get rid of the\r\nimpression that there was nothing the matter here but a spring freshet,\r\nand that the river would fall in a few weeks and leave a dirty high-water\r\nmark on the houses, and the streets full of mud and rubbish.\r\n\r\nIn the glare of day, there is little poetry about Venice, but under the\r\ncharitable moon her stained palaces are white again, their battered\r\nsculptures are hidden in shadows, and the old city seems crowned once\r\nmore with the grandeur that was hers five hundred years ago.  It is easy,\r\nthen, in fancy, to people these silent canals with plumed gallants and\r\nfair ladies--with Shylocks in gaberdine and sandals, venturing loans upon\r\nthe rich argosies of Venetian commerce--with Othellos and Desdemonas,\r\nwith Iagos and Roderigos--with noble fleets and victorious legions\r\nreturning from the wars.  In the treacherous sunlight we see Venice\r\ndecayed, forlorn, poverty-stricken, and commerceless--forgotten and\r\nutterly insignificant.  But in the moonlight, her fourteen centuries of\r\ngreatness fling their glories about her, and once more is she the\r\nprinceliest among the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a glorious city in the sea;\r\n          The sea is in the broad, the narrow streets,\r\n          Ebbing and flowing; and the salt-sea weed\r\n          Clings to the marble of her palaces.\r\n          No track of men, no footsteps to and fro,\r\n          Lead to her gates!  The path lies o'er the sea,\r\n          Invisible: and from the land we went,\r\n          As to a floating city--steering in,\r\n          And gliding up her streets, as in a dream,\r\n          So smoothly, silently--by many a dome,\r\n          Mosque-like, and many a stately portico,\r\n          The statues ranged along an azure sky;\r\n          By many a pile, in more than Eastern pride,\r\n          Of old the residence of merchant kings;\r\n          The fronts of some, tho' time had shatter'd them,\r\n          Still glowing with the richest hues of art,\r\n          As tho' the wealth within them had run o'er.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat would one naturally wish to see first in Venice?  The Bridge of\r\nSighs, of course--and next the Church and the Great Square of St. Mark,\r\nthe Bronze Horses, and the famous Lion of St. Mark.\r\n\r\nWe intended to go to the Bridge of Sighs, but happened into the Ducal\r\nPalace first--a building which necessarily figures largely in Venetian\r\npoetry and tradition.  In the Senate Chamber of the ancient Republic we\r\nwearied our eyes with staring at acres of historical paintings by\r\nTintoretto and Paul Veronese, but nothing struck us forcibly except the\r\none thing that strikes all strangers forcibly--a black square in the\r\nmidst of a gallery of portraits.  In one long row, around the great hall,\r\nwere painted the portraits of the Doges of Venice (venerable fellows,\r\nwith flowing white beards, for of the three hundred Senators eligible to\r\nthe office, the oldest was usually chosen Doge,) and each had its\r\ncomplimentary inscription attached--till you came to the place that\r\nshould have had Marino Faliero's picture in it, and that was blank and\r\nblack--blank, except that it bore a terse inscription, saying that the\r\nconspirator had died for his crime.  It seemed cruel to keep that\r\npitiless inscription still staring from the walls after the unhappy\r\nwretch had been in his grave five hundred years.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the Giant's Staircase, where Marino Faliero was beheaded,\r\nand where the Doges were crowned in ancient times, two small slits in the\r\nstone wall were pointed out--two harmless, insignificant orifices that\r\nwould never attract a stranger's attention--yet these were the terrible\r\nLions' Mouths!  The heads were gone (knocked off by the French during\r\ntheir occupation of Venice,) but these were the throats, down which went\r\nthe anonymous accusation, thrust in secretly at dead of night by an\r\nenemy, that doomed many an innocent man to walk the Bridge of Sighs and\r\ndescend into the dungeon which none entered and hoped to see the sun\r\nagain.  This was in the old days when the Patricians alone governed\r\nVenice--the common herd had no vote and no voice.  There were one\r\nthousand five hundred Patricians; from these, three hundred Senators were\r\nchosen; from the Senators a Doge and a Council of Ten were selected, and\r\nby secret ballot the Ten chose from their own number a Council of Three.\r\nAll these were Government spies, then, and every spy was under\r\nsurveillance himself--men spoke in whispers in Venice, and no man trusted\r\nhis neighbor--not always his own brother.  No man knew who the Council of\r\nThree were--not even the Senate, not even the Doge; the members of that\r\ndread tribunal met at night in a chamber to themselves, masked, and robed\r\nfrom head to foot in scarlet cloaks, and did not even know each other,\r\nunless by voice.  It was their duty to judge heinous political crimes,\r\nand from their sentence there was no appeal.  A nod to the executioner\r\nwas sufficient.  The doomed man was marched down a hall and out at a\r\ndoor-way into the covered Bridge of Sighs, through it and into the\r\ndungeon and unto his death.  At no time in his transit was he visible to\r\nany save his conductor.  If a man had an enemy in those old days, the\r\ncleverest thing he could do was to slip a note for the Council of Three\r\ninto the Lion's mouth, saying \xe2\x80\x9cThis man is plotting against the\r\nGovernment.\xe2\x80\x9d  If the awful Three found no proof, ten to one they would\r\ndrown him anyhow, because he was a deep rascal, since his plots were\r\nunsolvable.  Masked judges and masked executioners, with unlimited power,\r\nand no appeal from their judgements, in that hard, cruel age, were not\r\nlikely to be lenient with men they suspected yet could not convict.\r\n\r\nWe walked through the hall of the Council of Ten, and presently entered\r\nthe infernal den of the Council of Three.\r\n\r\nThe table around which they had sat was there still, and likewise the\r\nstations where the masked inquisitors and executioners formerly stood,\r\nfrozen, upright and silent, till they received a bloody order, and then,\r\nwithout a word, moved off like the inexorable machines they were, to\r\ncarry it out.  The frescoes on the walls were startlingly suited to the\r\nplace.  In all the other saloons, the halls, the great state chambers of\r\nthe palace, the walls and ceilings were bright with gilding, rich with\r\nelaborate carving, and resplendent with gallant pictures of Venetian\r\nvictories in war, and Venetian display in foreign courts, and hallowed\r\nwith portraits of the Virgin, the Saviour of men, and the holy saints\r\nthat preached the Gospel of Peace upon earth--but here, in dismal\r\ncontrast, were none but pictures of death and dreadful suffering!--not a\r\nliving figure but was writhing in torture, not a dead one but was smeared\r\nwith blood, gashed with wounds, and distorted with the agonies that had\r\ntaken away its life!\r\n\r\nFrom the palace to the gloomy prison is but a step--one might almost jump\r\nacross the narrow canal that intervenes.  The ponderous stone Bridge of\r\nSighs crosses it at the second story--a bridge that is a covered tunnel\r\n--you can not be seen when you walk in it.  It is partitioned lengthwise,\r\nand through one compartment walked such as bore light sentences in\r\nancient times, and through the other marched sadly the wretches whom the\r\nThree had doomed to lingering misery and utter oblivion in the dungeons,\r\nor to sudden and mysterious death.  Down below the level of the water, by\r\nthe light of smoking torches, we were shown the damp, thick-walled cells\r\nwhere many a proud patrician's life was eaten away by the long-drawn\r\nmiseries of solitary imprisonment--without light, air, books; naked,\r\nunshaven, uncombed, covered with vermin; his useless tongue forgetting\r\nits office, with none to speak to; the days and nights of his life no\r\nlonger marked, but merged into one eternal eventless night; far away from\r\nall cheerful sounds, buried in the silence of a tomb; forgotten by his\r\nhelpless friends, and his fate a dark mystery to them forever; losing his\r\nown memory at last, and knowing no more who he was or how he came there;\r\ndevouring the loaf of bread and drinking the water that were thrust into\r\nthe cell by unseen hands, and troubling his worn spirit no more with\r\nhopes and fears and doubts and longings to be free; ceasing to scratch\r\nvain prayers and complainings on walls where none, not even himself,\r\ncould see them, and resigning himself to hopeless apathy, driveling\r\nchildishness, lunacy!  Many and many a sorrowful story like this these\r\nstony walls could tell if they could but speak.\r\n\r\nIn a little narrow corridor, near by, they showed us where many a\r\nprisoner, after lying in the dungeons until he was forgotten by all save\r\nhis persecutors, was brought by masked executioners and garroted, or\r\nsewed up in a sack, passed through a little window to a boat, at dead of\r\nnight, and taken to some remote spot and drowned.\r\n\r\nThey used to show to visitors the implements of torture wherewith the\r\nThree were wont to worm secrets out of the accused--villainous machines\r\nfor crushing thumbs; the stocks where a prisoner sat immovable while\r\nwater fell drop by drop upon his head till the torture was more than\r\nhumanity could bear; and a devilish contrivance of steel, which inclosed\r\na prisoner's head like a shell, and crushed it slowly by means of a\r\nscrew.  It bore the stains of blood that had trickled through its joints\r\nlong ago, and on one side it had a projection whereon the torturer rested\r\nhis elbow comfortably and bent down his ear to catch the moanings of the\r\nsufferer perishing within.\r\n\r\nOf course we went to see the venerable relic of the ancient glory of\r\nVenice, with its pavements worn and broken by the passing feet of a\r\nthousand years of plebeians and patricians--The Cathedral of St. Mark.\r\nIt is built entirely of precious marbles, brought from the Orient\r\n--nothing in its composition is domestic.  Its hoary traditions make it an\r\nobject of absorbing interest to even the most careless stranger, and thus\r\nfar it had interest for me; but no further.  I could not go into\r\necstasies over its coarse mosaics, its unlovely Byzantine architecture,\r\nor its five hundred curious interior columns from as many distant\r\nquarries.  Every thing was worn out--every block of stone was smooth and\r\nalmost shapeless with the polishing hands and shoulders of loungers who\r\ndevoutly idled here in by-gone centuries and have died and gone to the\r\ndev--no, simply died, I mean.\r\n\r\nUnder the altar repose the ashes of St. Mark--and Matthew, Luke and John,\r\ntoo, for all I know.  Venice reveres those relics above all things\r\nearthly.  For fourteen hundred years St. Mark has been her patron saint.\r\nEvery thing about the city seems to be named after him or so named as to\r\nrefer to him in some way--so named, or some purchase rigged in some way\r\nto scrape a sort of hurrahing acquaintance with him.  That seems to be\r\nthe idea.  To be on good terms with St. Mark, seems to be the very summit\r\nof Venetian ambition.  They say St. Mark had a tame lion, and used to\r\ntravel with him--and every where that St. Mark went, the lion was sure to\r\ngo.  It was his protector, his friend, his librarian.  And so the Winged\r\nLion of St. Mark, with the open Bible under his paw, is a favorite emblem\r\nin the grand old city.  It casts its shadow from the most ancient pillar\r\nin Venice, in the Grand Square of St. Mark, upon the throngs of free\r\ncitizens below, and has so done for many a long century.  The winged lion\r\nis found every where--and doubtless here, where the winged lion is, no\r\nharm can come.\r\n\r\nSt. Mark died at Alexandria, in Egypt.  He was martyred, I think.\r\nHowever, that has nothing to do with my legend.  About the founding of\r\nthe city of Venice--say four hundred and fifty years after Christ--(for\r\nVenice is much younger than any other Italian city,) a priest dreamed\r\nthat an angel told him that until the remains of St. Mark were brought to\r\nVenice, the city could never rise to high distinction among the nations;\r\nthat the body must be captured, brought to the city, and a magnificent\r\nchurch built over it; and that if ever the Venetians allowed the Saint to\r\nbe removed from his new resting-place, in that day Venice would perish\r\nfrom off the face of the earth.  The priest proclaimed his dream, and\r\nforthwith Venice set about procuring the corpse of St. Mark.  One\r\nexpedition after another tried and failed, but the project was never\r\nabandoned during four hundred years.  At last it was secured by\r\nstratagem, in the year eight hundred and something.  The commander of a\r\nVenetian expedition disguised himself, stole the bones, separated them,\r\nand packed them in vessels filled with lard.  The religion of Mahomet\r\ncauses its devotees to abhor anything that is in the nature of pork, and\r\nso when the Christian was stopped by the officers at the gates of the\r\ncity, they only glanced once into his precious baskets, then turned up\r\ntheir noses at the unholy lard, and let him go.  The bones were buried in\r\nthe vaults of the grand cathedral, which had been waiting long years to\r\nreceive them, and thus the safety and the greatness of Venice were\r\nsecured.  And to this day there be those in Venice who believe that if\r\nthose holy ashes were stolen away, the ancient city would vanish like a\r\ndream, and its foundations be buried forever in the unremembering sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nThe Venetian gondola is as free and graceful, in its gliding movement, as\r\na serpent.  It is twenty or thirty feet long, and is narrow and deep,\r\nlike a canoe; its sharp bow and stern sweep upward from the water like\r\nthe horns of a crescent with the abruptness of the curve slightly\r\nmodified.\r\n\r\nThe bow is ornamented with a steel comb with a battle-ax attachment which\r\nthreatens to cut passing boats in two occasionally, but never does.  The\r\ngondola is painted black because in the zenith of Venetian magnificence\r\nthe gondolas became too gorgeous altogether, and the Senate decreed that\r\nall such display must cease, and a solemn, unembellished black be\r\nsubstituted.  If the truth were known, it would doubtless appear that\r\nrich plebeians grew too prominent in their affectation of patrician show\r\non the Grand Canal, and required a wholesome snubbing.  Reverence for the\r\nhallowed Past and its traditions keeps the dismal fashion in force now\r\nthat the compulsion exists no longer.  So let it remain.  It is the color\r\nof mourning.  Venice mourns.  The stern of the boat is decked over and\r\nthe gondolier stands there.  He uses a single oar--a long blade, of\r\ncourse, for he stands nearly erect.  A wooden peg, a foot and a half\r\nhigh, with two slight crooks or curves in one side of it and one in the\r\nother, projects above the starboard gunwale.  Against that peg the\r\ngondolier takes a purchase with his oar, changing it at intervals to the\r\nother side of the peg or dropping it into another of the crooks, as the\r\nsteering of the craft may demand--and how in the world he can back and\r\nfill, shoot straight ahead, or flirt suddenly around a corner, and make\r\nthe oar stay in those insignificant notches, is a problem to me and a\r\nnever diminishing matter of interest.  I am afraid I study the\r\ngondolier's marvelous skill more than I do the sculptured palaces we\r\nglide among.  He cuts a corner so closely, now and then, or misses\r\nanother gondola by such an imperceptible hair-breadth that I feel myself\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cscrooching,\xe2\x80\x9d as the children say, just as one does when a buggy wheel\r\ngrazes his elbow.  But he makes all his calculations with the nicest\r\nprecision, and goes darting in and out among a Broadway confusion of busy\r\ncraft with the easy confidence of the educated hackman.  He never makes a\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\nSometimes we go flying down the great canals at such a gait that we can\r\nget only the merest glimpses into front doors, and again, in obscure\r\nalleys in the suburbs, we put on a solemnity suited to the silence, the\r\nmildew, the stagnant waters, the clinging weeds, the deserted houses and\r\nthe general lifelessness of the place, and move to the spirit of grave\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\nThe gondolier is a picturesque rascal for all he wears no satin harness,\r\nno plumed bonnet, no silken tights.  His attitude is stately; he is lithe\r\nand supple; all his movements are full of grace.  When his long canoe,\r\nand his fine figure, towering from its high perch on the stern, are cut\r\nagainst the evening sky, they make a picture that is very novel and\r\nstriking to a foreign eye.\r\n\r\nWe sit in the cushioned carriage-body of a cabin, with the curtains\r\ndrawn, and smoke, or read, or look out upon the passing boats, the\r\nhouses, the bridges, the people, and enjoy ourselves much more than we\r\ncould in a buggy jolting over our cobble-stone pavements at home.  This\r\nis the gentlest, pleasantest locomotion we have ever known.\r\n\r\nBut it seems queer--ever so queer--to see a boat doing duty as a private\r\ncarriage.  We see business men come to the front door, step into a\r\ngondola, instead of a street car, and go off down town to the\r\ncounting-room.\r\n\r\nWe see visiting young ladies stand on the stoop, and laugh, and kiss\r\ngood-bye, and flirt their fans and say \xe2\x80\x9cCome soon--now do--you've been\r\njust as mean as ever you can be--mother's dying to see you--and we've\r\nmoved into the new house, O such a love of a place!--so convenient to the\r\npost office and the church, and the Young Men's Christian Association;\r\nand we do have such fishing, and such carrying on, and such\r\nswimming-matches in the back yard--Oh, you must come--no distance at all,\r\nand if you go down through by St. Mark's and the Bridge of Sighs, and cut\r\nthrough the alley and come up by the church of Santa Maria dei Frari, and\r\ninto the Grand Canal, there isn't a bit of current--now do come, Sally\r\nMaria--by-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d and then the little humbug trips down the steps, jumps\r\ninto the gondola, says, under her breath, \xe2\x80\x9cDisagreeable old thing, I hope\r\nshe won't!\xe2\x80\x9d goes skimming away, round the corner; and the other girl\r\nslams the street door and says, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that infliction's over, any way,\r\n--but I suppose I've got to go and see her--tiresome stuck-up thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Human nature appears to be just the same, all over the world.  We see the\r\ndiffident young man, mild of moustache, affluent of hair, indigent of\r\nbrain, elegant of costume, drive up to her father's mansion, tell his\r\nhackman to bail out and wait, start fearfully up the steps and meet \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nold gentleman\xe2\x80\x9d right on the threshold!--hear him ask what street the new\r\nBritish Bank is in--as if that were what he came for--and then bounce\r\ninto his boat and skurry away with his coward heart in his boots!--see\r\nhim come sneaking around the corner again, directly, with a crack of the\r\ncurtain open toward the old gentleman's disappearing gondola, and out\r\nscampers his Susan with a flock of little Italian endearments fluttering\r\nfrom her lips, and goes to drive with him in the watery avenues down\r\ntoward the Rialto.\r\n\r\nWe see the ladies go out shopping, in the most natural way, and flit from\r\nstreet to street and from store to store, just in the good old fashion,\r\nexcept that they leave the gondola, instead of a private carriage,\r\nwaiting at the curbstone a couple of hours for them,--waiting while they\r\nmake the nice young clerks pull down tons and tons of silks and velvets\r\nand moire antiques and those things; and then they buy a paper of pins\r\nand go paddling away to confer the rest of their disastrous patronage on\r\nsome other firm.  And they always have their purchases sent home just in\r\nthe good old way.  Human nature is very much the same all over the world;\r\nand it is so like my dear native home to see a Venetian lady go into a\r\nstore and buy ten cents' worth of blue ribbon and have it sent home in a\r\nscow.  Ah, it is these little touches of nature that move one to tears in\r\nthese far-off foreign lands.\r\n\r\nWe see little girls and boys go out in gondolas with their nurses, for an\r\nairing.  We see staid families, with prayer-book and beads, enter the\r\ngondola dressed in their Sunday best, and float away to church.  And at\r\nmidnight we see the theatre break up and discharge its swarm of hilarious\r\nyouth and beauty; we hear the cries of the hackman-gondoliers, and behold\r\nthe struggling crowd jump aboard, and the black multitude of boats go\r\nskimming down the moonlit avenues; we see them separate here and there,\r\nand disappear up divergent streets; we hear the faint sounds of laughter\r\nand of shouted farewells floating up out of the distance; and then, the\r\nstrange pageant being gone, we have lonely stretches of glittering water\r\n--of stately buildings--of blotting shadows--of weird stone faces\r\ncreeping into the moonlight--of deserted bridges--of motionless boats at\r\nanchor.  And over all broods that mysterious stillness, that stealthy\r\nquiet, that befits so well this old dreaming Venice.\r\n\r\nWe have been pretty much every where in our gondola.  We have bought\r\nbeads and photographs in the stores, and wax matches in the Great Square\r\nof St. Mark.  The last remark suggests a digression.  Every body goes to\r\nthis vast square in the evening.  The military bands play in the centre\r\nof it and countless couples of ladies and gentlemen promenade up and down\r\non either side, and platoons of them are constantly drifting away toward\r\nthe old Cathedral, and by the venerable column with the Winged Lion of\r\nSt. Mark on its top, and out to where the boats lie moored; and other\r\nplatoons are as constantly arriving from the gondolas and joining the\r\ngreat throng.  Between the promenaders and the side-walks are seated\r\nhundreds and hundreds of people at small tables, smoking and taking\r\ngranita, (a first cousin to ice-cream;) on the side-walks are more\r\nemploying themselves in the same way.  The shops in the first floor of\r\nthe tall rows of buildings that wall in three sides of the square are\r\nbrilliantly lighted, the air is filled with music and merry voices, and\r\naltogether the scene is as bright and spirited and full of cheerfulness\r\nas any man could desire.  We enjoy it thoroughly.  Very many of the young\r\nwomen are exceedingly pretty and dress with rare good taste.  We are\r\ngradually and laboriously learning the ill-manners of staring them\r\nunflinchingly in the face--not because such conduct is agreeable to us,\r\nbut because it is the custom of the country and they say the girls like\r\nit.  We wish to learn all the curious, outlandish ways of all the\r\ndifferent countries, so that we can \xe2\x80\x9cshow off\xe2\x80\x9d and astonish people when\r\nwe get home.  We wish to excite the envy of our untraveled friends with\r\nour strange foreign fashions which we can't shake off.  All our\r\npassengers are paying strict attention to this thing, with the end in\r\nview which I have mentioned.  The gentle reader will never, never know\r\nwhat a consummate ass he can become, until he goes abroad.  I speak now,\r\nof course, in the supposition that the gentle reader has not been abroad,\r\nand therefore is not already a consummate ass.  If the case be otherwise,\r\nI beg his pardon and extend to him the cordial hand of fellowship and\r\ncall him brother.  I shall always delight to meet an ass after my own\r\nheart when I shall have finished my travels.\r\n\r\nOn this subject let me remark that there are Americans abroad in Italy\r\nwho have actually forgotten their mother tongue in three months--forgot\r\nit in France.  They can not even write their address in English in a\r\nhotel register.  I append these evidences, which I copied verbatim from\r\nthe register of a hotel in a certain Italian city:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cJohn P. Whitcomb, Etats Unis.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWm. L. Ainsworth, travailleur (he meant traveler, I suppose,)\r\n      Etats Unis.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge P. Morton et fils, d'Amerique.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cLloyd B.  Williams, et trois amis, ville de Boston, Amerique.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cJ. Ellsworth Baker, tout de suite de France, place de\r\n     naissance Amerique, destination la Grand Bretagne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI love this sort of people.  A lady passenger of ours tells of a\r\nfellow-citizen of hers who spent eight weeks in Paris and then returned\r\nhome and addressed his dearest old bosom friend Herbert as Mr.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEr-bare!\xe2\x80\x9d  He apologized, though, and said, \xe2\x80\x9c'Pon my soul it is\r\naggravating, but I cahn't help it--I have got so used to speaking\r\nnothing but French, my dear Erbare--damme there it goes again!--got so\r\nused to French pronunciation that I cahn't get rid of it--it is\r\npositively annoying, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d  This entertaining idiot, whose name\r\nwas Gordon, allowed himself to be hailed three times in the street\r\nbefore he paid any attention, and then begged a thousand pardons and\r\nsaid he had grown so accustomed to hearing himself addressed as \xe2\x80\x9cM'sieu\r\nGor-r-dong,\xe2\x80\x9d with a roll to the r, that he had forgotten the legitimate\r\nsound of his name! He wore a rose in his button-hole; he gave the French\r\nsalutation--two flips of the hand in front of the face; he called Paris\r\nPairree in ordinary English conversation; he carried envelopes bearing\r\nforeign postmarks protruding from his breast-pocket; he cultivated a\r\nmoustache and imperial, and did what else he could to suggest to the\r\nbeholder his pet fancy that he resembled Louis Napoleon--and in a spirit\r\nof thankfulness which is entirely unaccountable, considering the slim\r\nfoundation there was for it, he praised his Maker that he was as he was,\r\nand went on enjoying his little life just the same as if he really had\r\nbeen deliberately designed and erected by the great Architect of the\r\nUniverse.\r\n\r\nThink of our Whitcombs, and our Ainsworths and our Williamses writing\r\nthemselves down in dilapidated French in foreign hotel registers!  We\r\nlaugh at Englishmen, when we are at home, for sticking so sturdily to\r\ntheir national ways and customs, but we look back upon it from abroad\r\nvery forgivingly.  It is not pleasant to see an American thrusting his\r\nnationality forward obtrusively in a foreign land, but Oh, it is pitiable\r\nto see him making of himself a thing that is neither male nor female,\r\nneither fish, flesh, nor fowl--a poor, miserable, hermaphrodite\r\nFrenchman!\r\n\r\nAmong a long list of churches, art galleries, and such things, visited by\r\nus in Venice, I shall mention only one--the church of Santa Maria dei\r\nFrari.  It is about five hundred years old, I believe, and stands on\r\ntwelve hundred thousand piles.  In it lie the body of Canova and the\r\nheart of Titian, under magnificent monuments.  Titian died at the age of\r\nalmost one hundred years.  A plague which swept away fifty thousand lives\r\nwas raging at the time, and there is notable evidence of the reverence in\r\nwhich the great painter was held, in the fact that to him alone the state\r\npermitted a public funeral in all that season of terror and death.\r\n\r\nIn this church, also, is a monument to the doge Foscari, whose name a\r\nonce resident of Venice, Lord Byron, has made permanently famous.\r\n\r\nThe monument to the doge Giovanni Pesaro, in this church, is a curiosity\r\nin the way of mortuary adornment.  It is eighty feet high and is fronted\r\nlike some fantastic pagan temple.  Against it stand four colossal\r\nNubians, as black as night, dressed in white marble garments.  The black\r\nlegs are bare, and through rents in sleeves and breeches, the skin, of\r\nshiny black marble, shows.  The artist was as ingenious as his funeral\r\ndesigns were absurd.  There are two bronze skeletons bearing scrolls, and\r\ntwo great dragons uphold the sarcophagus.  On high, amid all this\r\ngrotesqueness, sits the departed doge.\r\n\r\nIn the conventual buildings attached to this church are the state\r\narchives of Venice.  We did not see them, but they are said to number\r\nmillions of documents.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey are the records of centuries of the most\r\nwatchful, observant and suspicious government that ever existed--in which\r\nevery thing was written down and nothing spoken out.\xe2\x80\x9d  They fill nearly\r\nthree hundred rooms.  Among them are manuscripts from the archives of\r\nnearly two thousand families, monasteries and convents.  The secret\r\nhistory of Venice for a thousand years is here--its plots, its hidden\r\ntrials, its assassinations, its commissions of hireling spies and masked\r\nbravoes--food, ready to hand, for a world of dark and mysterious\r\nromances.\r\n\r\nYes, I think we have seen all of Venice.  We have seen, in these old\r\nchurches, a profusion of costly and elaborate sepulchre ornamentation\r\nsuch as we never dreampt of before.  We have stood in the dim religious\r\nlight of these hoary sanctuaries, in the midst of long ranks of dusty\r\nmonuments and effigies of the great dead of Venice, until we seemed\r\ndrifting back, back, back, into the solemn past, and looking upon the\r\nscenes and mingling with the peoples of a remote antiquity.  We have been\r\nin a half-waking sort of dream all the time.  I do not know how else to\r\ndescribe the feeling.  A part of our being has remained still in the\r\nnineteenth century, while another part of it has seemed in some\r\nunaccountable way walking among the phantoms of the tenth.\r\n\r\nWe have seen famous pictures until our eyes are weary with looking at\r\nthem and refuse to find interest in them any longer.  And what wonder,\r\nwhen there are twelve hundred pictures by Palma the Younger in Venice and\r\nfifteen hundred by Tintoretto?  And behold there are Titians and the\r\nworks of other artists in proportion.  We have seen Titian's celebrated\r\nCain and Abel, his David and Goliah, his Abraham's Sacrifice.  We have\r\nseen Tintoretto's monster picture, which is seventy-four feet long and I\r\ndo not know how many feet high, and thought it a very commodious picture.\r\nWe have seen pictures of martyrs enough, and saints enough, to regenerate\r\nthe world.  I ought not to confess it, but still, since one has no\r\nopportunity in America to acquire a critical judgment in art, and since I\r\ncould not hope to become educated in it in Europe in a few short weeks, I\r\nmay therefore as well acknowledge with such apologies as may be due, that\r\nto me it seemed that when I had seen one of these martyrs I had seen them\r\nall.  They all have a marked family resemblance to each other, they dress\r\nalike, in coarse monkish robes and sandals, they are all bald headed,\r\nthey all stand in about the same attitude, and without exception they are\r\ngazing heavenward with countenances which the Ainsworths, the Mortons and\r\nthe Williamses, et fils, inform me are full of \xe2\x80\x9cexpression.\xe2\x80\x9d  To me there\r\nis nothing tangible about these imaginary portraits, nothing that I can\r\ngrasp and take a living interest in.  If great Titian had only been\r\ngifted with prophecy, and had skipped a martyr, and gone over to England\r\nand painted a portrait of Shakspeare, even as a youth, which we could all\r\nhave confidence in now, the world down to the latest generations would\r\nhave forgiven him the lost martyr in the rescued seer.  I think posterity\r\ncould have spared one more martyr for the sake of a great historical\r\npicture of Titian's time and painted by his brush--such as Columbus\r\nreturning in chains from the discovery of a world, for instance.  The old\r\nmasters did paint some Venetian historical pictures, and these we did not\r\ntire of looking at, notwithstanding representations of the formal\r\nintroduction of defunct doges to the Virgin Mary in regions beyond the\r\nclouds clashed rather harshly with the proprieties, it seemed to us.\r\n\r\nBut humble as we are, and unpretending, in the matter of art, our\r\nresearches among the painted monks and martyrs have not been wholly in\r\nvain.  We have striven hard to learn.  We have had some success.  We have\r\nmastered some things, possibly of trifling import in the eyes of the\r\nlearned, but to us they give pleasure, and we take as much pride in our\r\nlittle acquirements as do others who have learned far more, and we love\r\nto display them full as well.  When we see a monk going about with a lion\r\nand looking tranquilly up to heaven, we know that that is St. Mark.  When\r\nwe see a monk with a book and a pen, looking tranquilly up to heaven,\r\ntrying to think of a word, we know that that is St. Matthew.  When we see\r\na monk sitting on a rock, looking tranquilly up to heaven, with a human\r\nskull beside him, and without other baggage, we know that that is St.\r\nJerome.  Because we know that he always went flying light in the matter\r\nof baggage.  When we see a party looking tranquilly up to heaven,\r\nunconscious that his body is shot through and through with arrows, we\r\nknow that that is St. Sebastian.  When we see other monks looking\r\ntranquilly up to heaven, but having no trade-mark, we always ask who\r\nthose parties are.  We do this because we humbly wish to learn.  We have\r\nseen thirteen thousand St. Jeromes, and twenty-two thousand St. Marks,\r\nand sixteen thousand St. Matthews, and sixty thousand St. Sebastians, and\r\nfour millions of assorted monks, undesignated, and we feel encouraged to\r\nbelieve that when we have seen some more of these various pictures, and\r\nhad a larger experience, we shall begin to take an absorbing interest in\r\nthem like our cultivated countrymen from Amerique.\r\n\r\nNow it does give me real pain to speak in this almost unappreciative way\r\nof the old masters and their martyrs, because good friends of mine in the\r\nship--friends who do thoroughly and conscientiously appreciate them and\r\nare in every way competent to discriminate between good pictures and\r\ninferior ones--have urged me for my own sake not to make public the fact\r\nthat I lack this appreciation and this critical discrimination myself.  I\r\nbelieve that what I have written and may still write about pictures will\r\ngive them pain, and I am honestly sorry for it.  I even promised that I\r\nwould hide my uncouth sentiments in my own breast.  But alas!  I never\r\ncould keep a promise.  I do not blame myself for this weakness, because\r\nthe fault must lie in my physical organization.  It is likely that such a\r\nvery liberal amount of space was given to the organ which enables me to\r\nmake promises, that the organ which should enable me to keep them was\r\ncrowded out.  But I grieve not.  I like no half-way things.  I had rather\r\nhave one faculty nobly developed than two faculties of mere ordinary\r\ncapacity.  I certainly meant to keep that promise, but I find I can not\r\ndo it.  It is impossible to travel through Italy without speaking of\r\npictures, and can I see them through others' eyes?\r\n\r\nIf I did not so delight in the grand pictures that are spread before me\r\nevery day of my life by that monarch of all the old masters, Nature, I\r\nshould come to believe, sometimes, that I had in me no appreciation of\r\nthe beautiful, whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that whenever I glory to think that for once I have\r\ndiscovered an ancient painting that is beautiful and worthy of all\r\npraise, the pleasure it gives me is an infallible proof that it is not a\r\nbeautiful picture and not in any wise worthy of commendation.  This very\r\nthing has occurred more times than I can mention, in Venice.  In every\r\nsingle instance the guide has crushed out my swelling enthusiasm with the\r\nremark:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing--it is of the Renaissance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not know what in the mischief the Renaissance was, and so always I\r\nhad to simply say,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! so it is--I had not observed it before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not bear to be ignorant before a cultivated negro, the offspring\r\nof a South Carolina slave.  But it occurred too often for even my\r\nself-complacency, did that exasperating \xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing--it is of the\r\nRenaissance.\xe2\x80\x9d  I said at last:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this Renaissance?  Where did he come from?  Who gave him\r\npermission to cram the Republic with his execrable daubs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe learned, then, that Renaissance was not a man; that renaissance was a\r\nterm used to signify what was at best but an imperfect rejuvenation of\r\nart.  The guide said that after Titian's time and the time of the other\r\ngreat names we had grown so familiar with, high art declined; then it\r\npartially rose again--an inferior sort of painters sprang up, and these\r\nshabby pictures were the work of their hands.  Then I said, in my heat,\r\nthat I \xe2\x80\x9cwished to goodness high art had declined five hundred years\r\nsooner.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Renaissance pictures suit me very well, though sooth to say\r\nits school were too much given to painting real men and did not indulge\r\nenough in martyrs.\r\n\r\nThe guide I have spoken of is the only one we have had yet who knew any\r\nthing.  He was born in South Carolina, of slave parents.  They came to\r\nVenice while he was an infant.  He has grown up here.  He is well\r\neducated.  He reads, writes, and speaks English, Italian, Spanish, and\r\nFrench, with perfect facility; is a worshipper of art and thoroughly\r\nconversant with it; knows the history of Venice by heart and never tires\r\nof talking of her illustrious career.  He dresses better than any of us,\r\nI think, and is daintily polite.  Negroes are deemed as good as white\r\npeople, in Venice, and so this man feels no desire to go back to his\r\nnative land.  His judgment is correct.\r\n\r\nI have had another shave.  I was writing in our front room this afternoon\r\nand trying hard to keep my attention on my work and refrain from looking\r\nout upon the canal.  I was resisting the soft influences of the climate\r\nas well as I could, and endeavoring to overcome the desire to be indolent\r\nand happy.  The boys sent for a barber.  They asked me if I would be\r\nshaved.  I reminded them of my tortures in Genoa, Milan, Como; of my\r\ndeclaration that I would suffer no more on Italian soil.  I said \xe2\x80\x9cNot any\r\nfor me, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wrote on.  The barber began on the doctor.  I heard him say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDan, this is the easiest shave I have had since we left the ship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said again, presently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy Dan, a man could go to sleep with this man shaving him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan took the chair.  Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy this is Titian.  This is one of the old masters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wrote on.  Directly Dan said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor, it is perfect luxury.  The ship's barber isn't any thing to\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy rough beard wee distressing me beyond measure.  The barber was rolling\r\nup his apparatus.  The temptation was too strong.  I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on, please.  Shave me also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sat down in the chair and closed my eyes.  The barber soaped my face,\r\nand then took his razor and gave me a rake that well nigh threw me into\r\nconvulsions.  I jumped out of the chair: Dan and the doctor were both\r\nwiping blood off their faces and laughing.\r\n\r\nI said it was a mean, disgraceful fraud.\r\n\r\nThey said that the misery of this shave had gone so far beyond any thing\r\nthey had ever experienced before, that they could not bear the idea of\r\nlosing such a chance of hearing a cordial opinion from me on the subject.\r\n\r\nIt was shameful.  But there was no help for it.  The skinning was begun\r\nand had to be finished.  The tears flowed with every rake, and so did the\r\nfervent execrations.  The barber grew confused, and brought blood every\r\ntime.  I think the boys enjoyed it better than any thing they have seen\r\nor heard since they left home.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the Campanile, and Byron's house and Balbi's the geographer,\r\nand the palaces of all the ancient dukes and doges of Venice, and we have\r\nseen their effeminate descendants airing their nobility in fashionable\r\nFrench attire in the Grand Square of St. Mark, and eating ices and\r\ndrinking cheap wines, instead of wearing gallant coats of mail and\r\ndestroying fleets and armies as their great ancestors did in the days of\r\nVenetian glory.  We have seen no bravoes with poisoned stilettos, no\r\nmasks, no wild carnival; but we have seen the ancient pride of Venice,\r\nthe grim Bronze Horses that figure in a thousand legends.  Venice may\r\nwell cherish them, for they are the only horses she ever had.  It is said\r\nthere are hundreds of people in this curious city who never have seen a\r\nliving horse in their lives.  It is entirely true, no doubt.\r\n\r\nAnd so, having satisfied ourselves, we depart to-morrow, and leave the\r\nvenerable Queen of the Republics to summon her vanished ships, and\r\nmarshal her shadowy armies, and know again in dreams the pride of her old\r\nrenown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nSome of the __Quaker City__'s passengers had arrived in Venice from\r\nSwitzerland and other lands before we left there, and others were\r\nexpected every day.  We heard of no casualties among them, and no\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\nWe were a little fatigued with sight seeing, and so we rattled through a\r\ngood deal of country by rail without caring to stop.  I took few notes.\r\nI find no mention of Bologna in my memorandum book, except that we\r\narrived there in good season, but saw none of the sausages for which the\r\nplace is so justly celebrated.\r\n\r\nPistoia awoke but a passing interest.\r\n\r\nFlorence pleased us for a while.  I think we appreciated the great figure\r\nof David in the grand square, and the sculptured group they call the Rape\r\nof the Sabines.  We wandered through the endless collections of paintings\r\nand statues of the Pitti and Ufizzi galleries, of course.  I make that\r\nstatement in self-defense; there let it stop.  I could not rest under the\r\nimputation that I visited Florence and did not traverse its weary miles\r\nof picture galleries.  We tried indolently to recollect something about\r\nthe Guelphs and Ghibelines and the other historical cut-throats whose\r\nquarrels and assassinations make up so large a share of Florentine\r\nhistory, but the subject was not attractive.  We had been robbed of all\r\nthe fine mountain scenery on our little journey by a system of\r\nrailroading that had three miles of tunnel to a hundred yards of\r\ndaylight, and we were not inclined to be sociable with Florence.  We had\r\nseen the spot, outside the city somewhere, where these people had allowed\r\nthe bones of Galileo to rest in unconsecrated ground for an age because\r\nhis great discovery that the world turned around was regarded as a\r\ndamning heresy by the church; and we know that long after the world had\r\naccepted his theory and raised his name high in the list of its great\r\nmen, they had still let him rot there.  That we had lived to see his dust\r\nin honored sepulture in the church of Santa Croce we owed to a society of\r\nliterati, and not to Florence or her rulers.  We saw Dante's tomb in that\r\nchurch, also, but we were glad to know that his body was not in it; that\r\nthe ungrateful city that had exiled him and persecuted him would give\r\nmuch to have it there, but need not hope to ever secure that high honor\r\nto herself.  Medicis are good enough for Florence.  Let her plant Medicis\r\nand build grand monuments over them to testify how gratefully she was\r\nwont to lick the hand that scourged her.\r\n\r\nMagnanimous Florence!  Her jewelry marts are filled with artists in\r\nmosaic.  Florentine mosaics are the choicest in all the world.  Florence\r\nloves to have that said.  Florence is proud of it.  Florence would foster\r\nthis specialty of hers.  She is grateful to the artists that bring to her\r\nthis high credit and fill her coffers with foreign money, and so she\r\nencourages them with pensions.  With pensions!  Think of the lavishness\r\nof it.  She knows that people who piece together the beautiful trifles\r\ndie early, because the labor is so confining, and so exhausting to hand\r\nand brain, and so she has decreed that all these people who reach the age\r\nof sixty shall have a pension after that!  I have not heard that any of\r\nthem have called for their dividends yet.  One man did fight along till\r\nhe was sixty, and started after his pension, but it appeared that there\r\nhad been a mistake of a year in his family record, and so he gave it up\r\nand died.\r\n\r\nThese artists will take particles of stone or glass no larger than a\r\nmustard seed, and piece them together on a sleeve button or a shirt stud,\r\nso smoothly and with such nice adjustment of the delicate shades of color\r\nthe pieces bear, as to form a pigmy rose with stem, thorn, leaves, petals\r\ncomplete, and all as softly and as truthfully tinted as though Nature had\r\nbuilded it herself.  They will counterfeit a fly, or a high-toned bug, or\r\nthe ruined Coliseum, within the cramped circle of a breastpin, and do it\r\nso deftly and so neatly that any man might think a master painted it.\r\n\r\nI saw a little table in the great mosaic school in Florence--a little\r\ntrifle of a centre table--whose top was made of some sort of precious\r\npolished stone, and in the stone was inlaid the figure of a flute, with\r\nbell-mouth and a mazy complication of keys.  No painting in the world\r\ncould have been softer or richer; no shading out of one tint into another\r\ncould have been more perfect; no work of art of any kind could have been\r\nmore faultless than this flute, and yet to count the multitude of little\r\nfragments of stone of which they swore it was formed would bankrupt any\r\nman's arithmetic!  I do not think one could have seen where two particles\r\njoined each other with eyes of ordinary shrewdness.  Certainly we could\r\ndetect no such blemish.  This table-top cost the labor of one man for ten\r\nlong years, so they said, and it was for sale for thirty-five thousand\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nWe went to the Church of Santa Croce, from time to time, in Florence, to\r\nweep over the tombs of Michael Angelo, Raphael and Machiavelli,\r\n(I suppose they are buried there, but it may be that they reside\r\nelsewhere and rent their tombs to other parties--such being the fashion\r\nin Italy,) and between times we used to go and stand on the bridges and\r\nadmire the Arno.  It is popular to admire the Arno.  It is a great\r\nhistorical creek with four feet in the channel and some scows floating\r\naround.  It would be a very plausible river if they would pump some water\r\ninto it.  They all call it a river, and they honestly think it is a\r\nriver, do these dark and bloody Florentines.  They even help out the\r\ndelusion by building bridges over it.  I do not see why they are too good\r\nto wade.\r\n\r\nHow the fatigues and annoyances of travel fill one with bitter prejudices\r\nsometimes!  I might enter Florence under happier auspices a month hence\r\nand find it all beautiful, all attractive.  But I do not care to think of\r\nit now, at all, nor of its roomy shops filled to the ceiling with snowy\r\nmarble and alabaster copies of all the celebrated sculptures in Europe\r\n--copies so enchanting to the eye that I wonder how they can really be\r\nshaped like the dingy petrified nightmares they are the portraits of.  I\r\ngot lost in Florence at nine o'clock, one night, and staid lost in that\r\nlabyrinth of narrow streets and long rows of vast buildings that look all\r\nalike, until toward three o'clock in the morning.  It was a pleasant\r\nnight and at first there were a good many people abroad, and there were\r\ncheerful lights about.  Later, I grew accustomed to prowling about\r\nmysterious drifts and tunnels and astonishing and interesting myself with\r\ncoming around corners expecting to find the hotel staring me in the face,\r\nand not finding it doing any thing of the kind.  Later still, I felt\r\ntired.  I soon felt remarkably tired.  But there was no one abroad, now\r\n--not even a policeman.  I walked till I was out of all patience, and very\r\nhot and thirsty.  At last, somewhere after one o'clock, I came\r\nunexpectedly to one of the city gates.  I knew then that I was very far\r\nfrom the hotel.  The soldiers thought I wanted to leave the city, and\r\nthey sprang up and barred the way with their muskets.  I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHotel d'Europe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was all the Italian I knew, and I was not certain whether that was\r\nItalian or French.  The soldiers looked stupidly at each other and at me,\r\nand shook their heads and took me into custody.  I said I wanted to go\r\nhome.  They did not understand me.  They took me into the guard-house and\r\nsearched me, but they found no sedition on me.  They found a small piece\r\nof soap (we carry soap with us, now,) and I made them a present of it,\r\nseeing that they regarded it as a curiosity.  I continued to say Hotel\r\nd'Europe, and they continued to shake their heads, until at last a young\r\nsoldier nodding in the corner roused up and said something.  He said he\r\nknew where the hotel was, I suppose, for the officer of the guard sent\r\nhim away with me.  We walked a hundred or a hundred and fifty miles, it\r\nappeared to me, and then he got lost.  He turned this way and that, and\r\nfinally gave it up and signified that he was going to spend the remainder\r\nof the morning trying to find the city gate again.  At that moment it\r\nstruck me that there was something familiar about the house over the way.\r\nIt was the hotel!\r\n\r\nIt was a happy thing for me that there happened to be a soldier there\r\nthat knew even as much as he did; for they say that the policy of the\r\ngovernment is to change the soldiery from one place to another constantly\r\nand from country to city, so that they can not become acquainted with the\r\npeople and grow lax in their duties and enter into plots and conspiracies\r\nwith friends.  My experiences of Florence were chiefly unpleasant.  I\r\nwill change the subject.\r\n\r\nAt Pisa we climbed up to the top of the strangest structure the world has\r\nany knowledge of--the Leaning Tower.  As every one knows, it is in the\r\nneighborhood of one hundred and eighty feet high--and I beg to observe\r\nthat one hundred and eighty feet reach to about the hight of four\r\nordinary three-story buildings piled one on top of the other, and is a\r\nvery considerable altitude for a tower of uniform thickness to aspire to,\r\neven when it stands upright--yet this one leans more than thirteen feet\r\nout of the perpendicular.  It is seven hundred years old, but neither\r\nhistory or tradition say whether it was built as it is, purposely, or\r\nwhether one of its sides has settled.  There is no record that it ever\r\nstood straight up.  It is built of marble.  It is an airy and a beautiful\r\nstructure, and each of its eight stories is encircled by fluted columns,\r\nsome of marble and some of granite, with Corinthian capitals that were\r\nhandsome when they were new.  It is a bell tower, and in its top hangs a\r\nchime of ancient bells.  The winding staircase within is dark, but one\r\nalways knows which side of the tower he is on because of his naturally\r\ngravitating from one side to the other of the staircase with the rise or\r\ndip of the tower.  Some of the stone steps are foot-worn only on one end;\r\nothers only on the other end; others only in the middle.  To look down\r\ninto the tower from the top is like looking down into a tilted well.  A\r\nrope that hangs from the centre of the top touches the wall before it\r\nreaches the bottom.  Standing on the summit, one does not feel altogether\r\ncomfortable when he looks down from the high side; but to crawl on your\r\nbreast to the verge on the lower side and try to stretch your neck out\r\nfar enough to see the base of the tower, makes your flesh creep, and\r\nconvinces you for a single moment in spite of all your philosophy, that\r\nthe building is falling.  You handle yourself very carefully, all the\r\ntime, under the silly impression that if it is not falling, your trifling\r\nweight will start it unless you are particular not to \xe2\x80\x9cbear down\xe2\x80\x9d on it.\r\n\r\nThe Duomo, close at hand, is one of the finest cathedrals in Europe.  It\r\nis eight hundred years old.  Its grandeur has outlived the high\r\ncommercial prosperity and the political importance that made it a\r\nnecessity, or rather a possibility.  Surrounded by poverty, decay and\r\nruin, it conveys to us a more tangible impression of the former greatness\r\nof Pisa than books could give us.\r\n\r\nThe Baptistery, which is a few years older than the Leaning Tower, is a\r\nstately rotunda, of huge dimensions, and was a costly structure.  In it\r\nhangs the lamp whose measured swing suggested to Galileo the pendulum.\r\nIt looked an insignificant thing to have conferred upon the world of\r\nscience and mechanics such a mighty extension of their dominions as it\r\nhas.  Pondering, in its suggestive presence, I seemed to see a crazy\r\nuniverse of swinging disks, the toiling children of this sedate parent.\r\nHe appeared to have an intelligent expression about him of knowing that\r\nhe was not a lamp at all; that he was a Pendulum; a pendulum disguised,\r\nfor prodigious and inscrutable purposes of his own deep devising, and not\r\na common pendulum either, but the old original patriarchal Pendulum--the\r\nAbraham Pendulum of the world.\r\n\r\nThis Baptistery is endowed with the most pleasing echo of all the echoes\r\nwe have read of.  The guide sounded two sonorous notes, about half an\r\noctave apart; the echo answered with the most enchanting, the most\r\nmelodious, the richest blending of sweet sounds that one can imagine.  It\r\nwas like a long-drawn chord of a church organ, infinitely softened by\r\ndistance.  I may be extravagant in this matter, but if this be the case\r\nmy ear is to blame--not my pen.  I am describing a memory--and one that\r\nwill remain long with me.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar devotional spirit of the olden time, which placed a higher\r\nconfidence in outward forms of worship than in the watchful guarding of\r\nthe heart against sinful thoughts and the hands against sinful deeds, and\r\nwhich believed in the protecting virtues of inanimate objects made holy\r\nby contact with holy things, is illustrated in a striking manner in one\r\nof the cemeteries of Pisa.  The tombs are set in soil brought in ships\r\nfrom the Holy Land ages ago.  To be buried in such ground was regarded by\r\nthe ancient Pisans as being more potent for salvation than many masses\r\npurchased of the church and the vowing of many candles to the Virgin.\r\n\r\nPisa is believed to be about three thousand years old.  It was one of the\r\ntwelve great cities of ancient Etruria, that commonwealth which has left\r\nso many monuments in testimony of its extraordinary advancement, and so\r\nlittle history of itself that is tangible and comprehensible.  A Pisan\r\nantiquarian gave me an ancient tear-jug which he averred was full four\r\nthousand years old.  It was found among the ruins of one of the oldest of\r\nthe Etruscan cities.  He said it came from a tomb, and was used by some\r\nbereaved family in that remote age when even the Pyramids of Egypt were\r\nyoung, Damascus a village, Abraham a prattling infant and ancient Troy\r\nnot yet [dreampt] of, to receive the tears wept for some lost idol of a\r\nhousehold.  It spoke to us in a language of its own; and with a pathos\r\nmore tender than any words might bring, its mute eloquence swept down the\r\nlong roll of the centuries with its tale of a vacant chair, a familiar\r\nfootstep missed from the threshold, a pleasant voice gone from the\r\nchorus, a vanished form!--a tale which is always so new to us, so\r\nstartling, so terrible, so benumbing to the senses, and behold how\r\nthreadbare and old it is!  No shrewdly-worded history could have brought\r\nthe myths and shadows of that old dreamy age before us clothed with human\r\nflesh and warmed with human sympathies so vividly as did this poor little\r\nunsentient vessel of pottery.\r\n\r\nPisa was a republic in the middle ages, with a government of her own,\r\narmies and navies of her own and a great commerce.  She was a warlike\r\npower, and inscribed upon her banners many a brilliant fight with Genoese\r\nand Turks.  It is said that the city once numbered a population of four\r\nhundred thousand; but her sceptre has passed from her grasp, now, her\r\nships and her armies are gone, her commerce is dead.  Her battle-flags\r\nbear the mold and the dust of centuries, her marts are deserted, she has\r\nshrunken far within her crumbling walls, and her great population has\r\ndiminished to twenty thousand souls.  She has but one thing left to boast\r\nof, and that is not much, viz: she is the second city of Tuscany.\r\n\r\nWe reached Leghorn in time to see all we wished to see of it long before\r\nthe city gates were closed for the evening, and then came on board the\r\nship.\r\n\r\nWe felt as though we had been away from home an age.  We never entirely\r\nappreciated, before, what a very pleasant den our state-room is; nor how\r\njolly it is to sit at dinner in one's own seat in one's own cabin, and\r\nhold familiar conversation with friends in one's own language.  Oh, the\r\nrare happiness of comprehending every single word that is said, and\r\nknowing that every word one says in return will be understood as well!\r\nWe would talk ourselves to death, now, only there are only about ten\r\npassengers out of the sixty-five to talk to.  The others are wandering,\r\nwe hardly know where.  We shall not go ashore in Leghorn.  We are\r\nsurfeited with Italian cities for the present, and much prefer to walk\r\nthe familiar quarterdeck and view this one from a distance.\r\n\r\nThe stupid magnates of this Leghorn government can not understand that so\r\nlarge a steamer as ours could cross the broad Atlantic with no other\r\npurpose than to indulge a party of ladies and gentlemen in a pleasure\r\nexcursion.  It looks too improbable.  It is suspicious, they think.\r\nSomething more important must be hidden behind it all.  They can not\r\nunderstand it, and they scorn the evidence of the ship's papers.  They\r\nhave decided at last that we are a battalion of incendiary, blood-thirsty\r\nGaribaldians in disguise!  And in all seriousness they have set a\r\ngun-boat to watch the vessel night and day, with orders to close down on\r\nany revolutionary movement in a twinkling!  Police boats are on patrol\r\nduty about us all the time, and it is as much as a sailor's liberty is\r\nworth to show himself in a red shirt.  These policemen follow the\r\nexecutive officer's boat from shore to ship and from ship to shore and\r\nwatch his dark maneuvres with a vigilant eye.  They will arrest him yet\r\nunless he assumes an expression of countenance that shall have less of\r\ncarnage, insurrection and sedition in it.  A visit paid in a friendly\r\nway to General Garibaldi yesterday (by cordial invitation,) by some of\r\nour passengers, has gone far to confirm the dread suspicions the\r\ngovernment harbors toward us.  It is thought the friendly visit was only\r\nthe cloak of a bloody conspiracy.  These people draw near and watch us\r\nwhen we bathe in the sea from the ship's side.  Do they think we are\r\ncommuning with a reserve force of rascals at the bottom?\r\n\r\nIt is said that we shall probably be quarantined at Naples.  Two or three\r\nof us prefer not to run this risk.  Therefore, when we are rested, we\r\npropose to go in a French steamer to Civita and from thence to Rome, and\r\nby rail to Naples.  They do not quarantine the cars, no matter where they\r\ngot their passengers from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nThere are a good many things about this Italy which I do not understand\r\n--and more especially I can not understand how a bankrupt Government can\r\nhave such palatial railroad depots and such marvels of turnpikes.  Why,\r\nthese latter are as hard as adamant, as straight as a line, as smooth as\r\na floor, and as white as snow.  When it is too dark to see any other\r\nobject, one can still see the white turnpikes of France and Italy; and\r\nthey are clean enough to eat from, without a table-cloth.  And yet no\r\ntolls are charged.\r\n\r\nAs for the railways--we have none like them.  The cars slide as smoothly\r\nalong as if they were on runners.  The depots are vast palaces of cut\r\nmarble, with stately colonnades of the same royal stone traversing them\r\nfrom end to end, and with ample walls and ceilings richly decorated with\r\nfrescoes.  The lofty gateways are graced with statues, and the broad\r\nfloors are all laid in polished flags of marble.\r\n\r\nThese things win me more than Italy's hundred galleries of priceless art\r\ntreasures, because I can understand the one and am not competent to\r\nappreciate the other.  In the turnpikes, the railways, the depots, and\r\nthe new boulevards of uniform houses in Florence and other cities here, I\r\nsee the genius of Louis Napoleon, or rather, I see the works of that\r\nstatesman imitated.  But Louis has taken care that in France there shall\r\nbe a foundation for these improvements--money.  He has always the\r\nwherewithal to back up his projects; they strengthen France and never\r\nweaken her.  Her material prosperity is genuine.  But here the case is\r\ndifferent.  This country is bankrupt.  There is no real foundation for\r\nthese great works.  The prosperity they would seem to indicate is a\r\npretence.  There is no money in the treasury, and so they enfeeble her\r\ninstead of strengthening.  Italy has achieved the dearest wish of her\r\nheart and become an independent State--and in so doing she has drawn an\r\nelephant in the political lottery.  She has nothing to feed it on.\r\nInexperienced in government, she plunged into all manner of useless\r\nexpenditure, and swamped her treasury almost in a day.  She squandered\r\nmillions of francs on a navy which she did not need, and the first time\r\nshe took her new toy into action she got it knocked higher than\r\nGilderoy's kite--to use the language of the Pilgrims.\r\n\r\nBut it is an ill-wind that blows nobody good.  A year ago, when Italy saw\r\nutter ruin staring her in the face and her greenbacks hardly worth the\r\npaper they were printed on, her Parliament ventured upon a 'coup de main'\r\nthat would have appalled the stoutest of her statesmen under less\r\ndesperate circumstances.  They, in a manner, confiscated the domains of\r\nthe Church!  This in priest-ridden Italy!  This in a land which has\r\ngroped in the midnight of priestly superstition for sixteen hundred\r\nyears!  It was a rare good fortune for Italy, the stress of weather that\r\ndrove her to break from this prison-house.\r\n\r\nThey do not call it confiscating the church property.  That would sound\r\ntoo harshly yet.  But it amounts to that.  There are thousands of\r\nchurches in Italy, each with untold millions of treasures stored away in\r\nits closets, and each with its battalion of priests to be supported.\r\nAnd then there are the estates of the Church--league on league of the\r\nrichest lands and the noblest forests in all Italy--all yielding immense\r\nrevenues to the Church, and none paying a cent in taxes to the State.\r\nIn some great districts the Church owns all the property--lands,\r\nwatercourses, woods, mills and factories.  They buy, they sell, they\r\nmanufacture, and since they pay no taxes, who can hope to compete with\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nWell, the Government has seized all this in effect, and will yet seize it\r\nin rigid and unpoetical reality, no doubt.  Something must be done to\r\nfeed a starving treasury, and there is no other resource in all Italy\r\n--none but the riches of the Church.  So the Government intends to take to\r\nitself a great portion of the revenues arising from priestly farms,\r\nfactories, etc., and also intends to take possession of the churches and\r\ncarry them on, after its own fashion and upon its own responsibility.\r\nIn a few instances it will leave the establishments of great pet churches\r\nundisturbed, but in all others only a handful of priests will be retained\r\nto preach and pray, a few will be pensioned, and the balance turned\r\nadrift.\r\n\r\nPray glance at some of these churches and their embellishments, and see\r\nwhether the Government is doing a righteous thing or not.  In Venice,\r\ntoday, a city of a hundred thousand inhabitants, there are twelve hundred\r\npriests.  Heaven only knows how many there were before the Parliament\r\nreduced their numbers.  There was the great Jesuit Church.  Under the old\r\nregime it required sixty priests to engineer it--the Government does it\r\nwith five, now, and the others are discharged from service.  All about\r\nthat church wretchedness and poverty abound.  At its door a dozen hats\r\nand bonnets were doffed to us, as many heads were humbly bowed, and as\r\nmany hands extended, appealing for pennies--appealing with foreign words\r\nwe could not understand, but appealing mutely, with sad eyes, and sunken\r\ncheeks, and ragged raiment, that no words were needed to translate.  Then\r\nwe passed within the great doors, and it seemed that the riches of the\r\nworld were before us!  Huge columns carved out of single masses of\r\nmarble, and inlaid from top to bottom with a hundred intricate figures\r\nwrought in costly verde antique; pulpits of the same rich materials,\r\nwhose draperies hung down in many a pictured fold, the stony fabric\r\ncounterfeiting the delicate work of the loom; the grand altar brilliant\r\nwith polished facings and balustrades of oriental agate, jasper, verde\r\nantique, and other precious stones, whose names, even, we seldom hear\r\n--and slabs of priceless lapis lazuli lavished every where as recklessly as\r\nif the church had owned a quarry of it.  In the midst of all this\r\nmagnificence, the solid gold and silver furniture of the altar seemed\r\ncheap and trivial.  Even the floors and ceilings cost a princely fortune.\r\n\r\nNow, where is the use of allowing all those riches to lie idle, while\r\nhalf of that community hardly know, from day to day, how they are going\r\nto keep body and soul together?  And, where is the wisdom in permitting\r\nhundreds upon hundreds of millions of francs to be locked up in the\r\nuseless trumpery of churches all over Italy, and the people ground to\r\ndeath with taxation to uphold a perishing Government?\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, Italy, for fifteen hundred years, has turned all her\r\nenergies, all her finances, and all her industry to the building up of a\r\nvast array of wonderful church edifices, and starving half her citizens\r\nto accomplish it.  She is to-day one vast museum of magnificence and\r\nmisery.  All the churches in an ordinary American city put together could\r\nhardly buy the jeweled frippery in one of her hundred cathedrals.  And\r\nfor every beggar in America, Italy can show a hundred--and rags and\r\nvermin to match.  It is the wretchedest, princeliest land on earth.\r\n\r\nLook at the grand Duomo of Florence--a vast pile that has been sapping\r\nthe purses of her citizens for five hundred years, and is not nearly\r\nfinished yet.  Like all other men, I fell down and worshipped it, but\r\nwhen the filthy beggars swarmed around me the contrast was too striking,\r\ntoo suggestive, and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cO, sons of classic Italy, is the spirit of\r\nenterprise, of self-reliance, of noble endeavor, utterly dead within ye?\r\nCurse your indolent worthlessness, why don't you rob your church?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThree hundred happy, comfortable priests are employed in that Cathedral.\r\n\r\nAnd now that my temper is up, I may as well go on and abuse every body I\r\ncan think of.  They have a grand mausoleum in Florence, which they built\r\nto bury our Lord and Saviour and the Medici family in.  It sounds\r\nblasphemous, but it is true, and here they act blasphemy.  The dead and\r\ndamned Medicis who cruelly tyrannized over Florence and were her curse\r\nfor over two hundred years, are salted away in a circle of costly vaults,\r\nand in their midst the Holy Sepulchre was to have been set up.  The\r\nexpedition sent to Jerusalem to seize it got into trouble and could not\r\naccomplish the burglary, and so the centre of the mausoleum is vacant\r\nnow.  They say the entire mausoleum was intended for the Holy Sepulchre,\r\nand was only turned into a family burying place after the Jerusalem\r\nexpedition failed--but you will excuse me.  Some of those Medicis would\r\nhave smuggled themselves in sure.--What they had not the effrontery to\r\ndo, was not worth doing.  Why, they had their trivial, forgotten exploits\r\non land and sea pictured out in grand frescoes (as did also the ancient\r\nDoges of Venice) with the Saviour and the Virgin throwing bouquets to\r\nthem out of the clouds, and the Deity himself applauding from his throne\r\nin Heaven!  And who painted these things?  Why, Titian, Tintoretto, Paul\r\nVeronese, Raphael--none other than the world's idols, the \xe2\x80\x9cold masters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAndrea del Sarto glorified his princes in pictures that must save them\r\nfor ever from the oblivion they merited, and they let him starve.  Served\r\nhim right.  Raphael pictured such infernal villains as Catherine and\r\nMarie de Medicis seated in heaven and conversing familiarly with the\r\nVirgin Mary and the angels, (to say nothing of higher personages,) and\r\nyet my friends abuse me because I am a little prejudiced against the old\r\nmasters--because I fail sometimes to see the beauty that is in their\r\nproductions.  I can not help but see it, now and then, but I keep on\r\nprotesting against the groveling spirit that could persuade those masters\r\nto prostitute their noble talents to the adulation of such monsters as\r\nthe French, Venetian and Florentine Princes of two and three hundred\r\nyears ago, all the same.\r\n\r\nI am told that the old masters had to do these shameful things for bread,\r\nthe princes and potentates being the only patrons of art.  If a grandly\r\ngifted man may drag his pride and his manhood in the dirt for bread\r\nrather than starve with the nobility that is in him untainted, the excuse\r\nis a valid one.  It would excuse theft in Washingtons and Wellingtons,\r\nand unchastity in women as well.\r\n\r\nBut somehow, I can not keep that Medici mausoleum out of my memory.  It\r\nis as large as a church; its pavement is rich enough for the pavement of\r\na King's palace; its great dome is gorgeous with frescoes; its walls are\r\nmade of--what?  Marble?--plaster?--wood?--paper?  No.  Red porphyry\r\n--verde antique--jasper--oriental agate--alabaster--mother-of-pearl\r\n--chalcedony--red coral--lapis lazuli!  All the vast walls are made wholly\r\nof these precious stones, worked in, and in and in together in elaborate\r\npattern s and figures, and polished till they glow like great mirrors\r\nwith the pictured splendors reflected from the dome overhead.  And before\r\na statue of one of those dead Medicis reposes a crown that blazes with\r\ndiamonds and emeralds enough to buy a ship-of-the-line, almost.  These\r\nare the things the Government has its evil eye upon, and a happy thing it\r\nwill be for Italy when they melt away in the public treasury.\r\n\r\nAnd now----.  However, another beggar approaches.  I will go out and\r\ndestroy him, and then come back and write another chapter of\r\nvituperation.\r\n\r\nHaving eaten the friendless orphan--having driven away his comrades\r\n--having grown calm and reflective at length--I now feel in a kindlier\r\nmood.  I feel that after talking so freely about the priests and the\r\nchurches, justice demands that if I know any thing good about either I\r\nought to say it.  I have heard of many things that redound to the credit\r\nof the priesthood, but the most notable matter that occurs to me now is\r\nthe devotion one of the mendicant orders showed during the prevalence of\r\nthe cholera last year.  I speak of the Dominican friars--men who wear a\r\ncoarse, heavy brown robe and a cowl, in this hot climate, and go\r\nbarefoot.  They live on alms altogether, I believe.  They must\r\nunquestionably love their religion, to suffer so much for it.  When the\r\ncholera was raging in Naples; when the people were dying by hundreds and\r\nhundreds every day; when every concern for the public welfare was\r\nswallowed up in selfish private interest, and every citizen made the\r\ntaking care of himself his sole object, these men banded themselves\r\ntogether and went about nursing the sick and burying the dead.  Their\r\nnoble efforts cost many of them their lives.  They laid them down\r\ncheerfully, and well they might.  Creeds mathematically precise, and\r\nhair-splitting niceties of doctrine, are absolutely necessary for the\r\nsalvation of some kinds of souls, but surely the charity, the purity, the\r\nunselfishness that are in the hearts of men like these would save their\r\nsouls though they were bankrupt in the true religion--which is ours.\r\n\r\nOne of these fat bare-footed rascals came here to Civita Vecchia with us\r\nin the little French steamer.  There were only half a dozen of us in the\r\ncabin.  He belonged in the steerage.  He was the life of the ship, the\r\nbloody-minded son of the Inquisition!  He and the leader of the marine\r\nband of a French man-of-war played on the piano and sang opera turn\r\nabout; they sang duets together; they rigged impromptu theatrical\r\ncostumes and gave us extravagant farces and pantomimes.  We got along\r\nfirst-rate with the friar, and were excessively conversational, albeit he\r\ncould not understand what we said, and certainly he never uttered a word\r\nthat we could guess the meaning of.\r\n\r\nThis Civita Vecchia is the finest nest of dirt, vermin and ignorance we\r\nhave found yet, except that African perdition they call Tangier, which is\r\njust like it.  The people here live in alleys two yards wide, which have\r\na smell about them which is peculiar but not entertaining.  It is well\r\nthe alleys are not wider, because they hold as much smell now as a person\r\ncan stand, and of course, if they were wider they would hold more, and\r\nthen the people would die.  These alleys are paved with stone, and\r\ncarpeted with deceased cats, and decayed rags, and decomposed\r\nvegetable-tops, and remnants of old boots, all soaked with dish-water,\r\nand the people sit around on stools and enjoy it.  They are indolent, as\r\na general thing, and yet have few pastimes.  They work two or three\r\nhours at a time, but not hard, and then they knock off and catch flies.\r\nThis does not require any talent, because they only have to grab--if\r\nthey do not get the one they are after, they get another.  It is all the\r\nsame to them.  They have no partialities.  Whichever one they get is the\r\none they want.\r\n\r\nThey have other kinds of insects, but it does not make them arrogant.\r\nThey are very quiet, unpretending people.  They have more of these kind\r\nof things than other communities, but they do not boast.\r\n\r\nThey are very uncleanly--these people--in face, in person and dress.\r\nWhen they see any body with a clean shirt on, it arouses their scorn.\r\nThe women wash clothes, half the day, at the public tanks in the streets,\r\nbut they are probably somebody else's.  Or may be they keep one set to\r\nwear and another to wash; because they never put on any that have ever\r\nbeen washed.  When they get done washing, they sit in the alleys and\r\nnurse their cubs.  They nurse one ash-cat at a time, and the others\r\nscratch their backs against the door-post and are happy.\r\n\r\nAll this country belongs to the Papal States.  They do not appear to have\r\nany schools here, and only one billiard table.  Their education is at a\r\nvery low stage.  One portion of the men go into the military, another\r\ninto the priesthood, and the rest into the shoe-making business.\r\n\r\nThey keep up the passport system here, but so they do in Turkey.  This\r\nshows that the Papal States are as far advanced as Turkey.  This fact\r\nwill be alone sufficient to silence the tongues of malignant\r\ncalumniators.  I had to get my passport vised for Rome in Florence, and\r\nthen they would not let me come ashore here until a policeman had\r\nexamined it on the wharf and sent me a permit.  They did not even dare to\r\nlet me take my passport in my hands for twelve hours, I looked so\r\nformidable.  They judged it best to let me cool down.  They thought I\r\nwanted to take the town, likely.  Little did they know me.  I wouldn't\r\nhave it.  They examined my baggage at the depot.  They took one of my\r\nablest jokes and read it over carefully twice and then read it backwards.\r\nBut it was too deep for them.  They passed it around, and every body\r\nspeculated on it awhile, but it mastered them all.\r\n\r\nIt was no common joke.  At length a veteran officer spelled it over\r\ndeliberately and shook his head three or four times and said that in his\r\nopinion it was seditious.  That was the first time I felt alarmed.  I\r\nimmediately said I would explain the document, and they crowded around.\r\nAnd so I explained and explained and explained, and they took notes of\r\nall I said, but the more I explained the more they could not understand\r\nit, and when they desisted at last, I could not even understand it\r\nmyself.  They said they believed it was an incendiary document, leveled\r\nat the government.  I declared solemnly that it was not, but they only\r\nshook their heads and would not be satisfied.  Then they consulted a good\r\nwhile; and finally they confiscated it.  I was very sorry for this,\r\nbecause I had worked a long time on that joke, and took a good deal of\r\npride in it, and now I suppose I shall never see it any more.  I suppose\r\nit will be sent up and filed away among the criminal archives of Rome,\r\nand will always be regarded as a mysterious infernal machine which would\r\nhave blown up like a mine and scattered the good Pope all around, but for\r\na miraculous providential interference.  And I suppose that all the time\r\nI am in Rome the police will dog me about from place to place because\r\nthey think I am a dangerous character.\r\n\r\nIt is fearfully hot in Civita Vecchia.  The streets are made very narrow\r\nand the houses built very solid and heavy and high, as a protection\r\nagainst the heat.  This is the first Italian town I have seen which does\r\nnot appear to have a patron saint.  I suppose no saint but the one that\r\nwent up in the chariot of fire could stand the climate.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing here to see.  They have not even a cathedral, with\r\neleven tons of solid silver archbishops in the back room; and they do not\r\nshow you any moldy buildings that are seven thousand years old; nor any\r\nsmoke-dried old fire-screens which are chef d'oeuvres of Reubens or\r\nSimpson, or Titian or Ferguson, or any of those parties; and they haven't\r\nany bottled fragments of saints, and not even a nail from the true cross.\r\nWe are going to Rome.  There is nothing to see here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nWhat is it that confers the noblest delight?  What is that which swells a\r\nman's breast with pride above that which any other experience can bring\r\nto him?  Discovery!  To know that you are walking where none others have\r\nwalked; that you are beholding what human eye has not seen before; that\r\nyou are breathing a virgin atmosphere.  To give birth to an idea--to\r\ndiscover a great thought--an intellectual nugget, right under the dust of\r\na field that many a brain--plow had gone over before.  To find a new\r\nplanet, to invent a new hinge, to find the way to make the lightnings\r\ncarry your messages.  To be the first--that is the idea.  To do\r\nsomething, say something, see something, before any body else--these are\r\nthe things that confer a pleasure compared with which other pleasures are\r\ntame and commonplace, other ecstasies cheap and trivial.  Morse, with his\r\nfirst message, brought by his servant, the lightning; Fulton, in that\r\nlong-drawn century of suspense, when he placed his hand upon the\r\nthrottle-valve and lo, the steamboat moved; Jenner, when his patient with\r\nthe cow's virus in his blood, walked through the smallpox hospitals\r\nunscathed; Howe, when the idea shot through his brain that for a hundred\r\nand twenty generations the eye had been bored through the wrong end of\r\nthe needle; the nameless lord of art who laid down his chisel in some old\r\nage that is forgotten, now, and gloated upon the finished Laocoon;\r\nDaguerre, when he commanded the sun, riding in the zenith, to print the\r\nlandscape upon his insignificant silvered plate, and he obeyed; Columbus,\r\nin the Pinta's shrouds, when he swung his hat above a fabled sea and\r\ngazed abroad upon an unknown world!  These are the men who have really\r\nlived--who have actually comprehended what pleasure is--who have crowded\r\nlong lifetimes of ecstasy into a single moment.\r\n\r\nWhat is there in Rome for me to see that others have not seen before me?\r\nWhat is there for me to touch that others have not touched?  What is\r\nthere for me to feel, to learn, to hear, to know, that shall thrill me\r\nbefore it pass to others?  What can I discover?--Nothing.  Nothing\r\nwhatsoever.  One charm of travel dies here.  But if I were only a Roman!\r\n--If, added to my own I could be gifted with modern Roman sloth, modern\r\nRoman superstition, and modern Roman boundlessness of ignorance, what\r\nbewildering worlds of unsuspected wonders I would discover!  Ah, if I\r\nwere only a habitant of the Campagna five and twenty miles from Rome!\r\nThen I would travel.\r\n\r\nI would go to America, and see, and learn, and return to the Campagna and\r\nstand before my countrymen an illustrious discoverer.  I would say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw there a country which has no overshadowing Mother Church, and yet\r\nthe people survive.  I saw a government which never was protected by\r\nforeign soldiers at a cost greater than that required to carry on the\r\ngovernment itself.  I saw common men and common women who could read;\r\nI even saw small children of common country people reading from books;\r\nif I dared think you would believe it, I would say they could write,\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the cities I saw people drinking a delicious beverage made of chalk\r\nand water, but never once saw goats driven through their Broadway or\r\ntheir Pennsylvania Avenue or their Montgomery street and milked at the\r\ndoors of the houses.  I saw real glass windows in the houses of even the\r\ncommonest people.  Some of the houses are not of stone, nor yet of\r\nbricks; I solemnly swear they are made of wood.  Houses there will take\r\nfire and burn, sometimes--actually burn entirely down, and not leave a\r\nsingle vestige behind.  I could state that for a truth, upon my\r\ndeath-bed.  And as a proof that the circumstance is not rare, I aver\r\nthat they have a thing which they call a fire-engine, which vomits forth\r\ngreat streams of water, and is kept always in readiness, by night and by\r\nday, to rush to houses that are burning.  You would think one engine\r\nwould be sufficient, but some great cities have a hundred; they keep men\r\nhired, and pay them by the month to do nothing but put out fires.  For a\r\ncertain sum of money other men will insure that your house shall not\r\nburn down; and if it burns they will pay you for it.  There are hundreds\r\nand thousands of schools, and any body may go and learn to be wise, like\r\na priest.  In that singular country if a rich man dies a sinner, he is\r\ndamned; he can not buy salvation with money for masses.  There is really\r\nnot much use in being rich, there.  Not much use as far as the other\r\nworld is concerned, but much, very much use, as concerns this; because\r\nthere, if a man be rich, he is very greatly honored, and can become a\r\nlegislator, a governor, a general, a senator, no matter how ignorant an\r\nass he is--just as in our beloved Italy the nobles hold all the great\r\nplaces, even though sometimes they are born noble idiots.  There, if a\r\nman be rich, they give him costly presents, they ask him to feasts, they\r\ninvite him to drink complicated beverages; but if he be poor and in\r\ndebt, they require him to do that which they term to 'settle.'  The\r\nwomen put on a different dress almost every day; the dress is usually\r\nfine, but absurd in shape; the very shape and fashion of it changes\r\ntwice in a hundred years; and did I but covet to be called an\r\nextravagant falsifier, I would say it changed even oftener.  Hair does\r\nnot grow upon the American women's heads; it is made for them by cunning\r\nworkmen in the shops, and is curled and frizzled into scandalous and\r\nungodly forms. Some persons wear eyes of glass which they see through\r\nwith facility perhaps, else they would not use them; and in the mouths\r\nof some are teeth made by the sacrilegious hand of man.  The dress of\r\nthe men is laughably grotesque.  They carry no musket in ordinary life,\r\nnor no long-pointed pole; they wear no wide green-lined cloak; they wear\r\nno peaked black felt hat, no leathern gaiters reaching to the knee, no\r\ngoat-skin breeches with the hair side out, no hob-nailed shoes, no\r\nprodigious spurs.  They wear a conical hat termed a 'nail-keg;' a coat\r\nof saddest black; a shirt which shows dirt so easily that it has to be\r\nchanged every month, and is very troublesome; things called pantaloons,\r\nwhich are held up by shoulder straps, and on their feet they wear boots\r\nwhich are ridiculous in pattern and can stand no wear.  Yet dressed in\r\nthis fantastic garb, these people laughed at my costume.  In that\r\ncountry, books are so common that it is really no curiosity to see one.\r\nNewspapers also.  They have a great machine which prints such things by\r\nthousands every hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw common men, there--men who were neither priests nor princes--who\r\nyet absolutely owned the land they tilled.  It was not rented from the\r\nchurch, nor from the nobles.  I am ready to take my oath of this.  In\r\nthat country you might fall from a third story window three several\r\ntimes, and not mash either a soldier or a priest.--The scarcity of such\r\npeople is astonishing.  In the cities you will see a dozen civilians for\r\nevery soldier, and as many for every priest or preacher.  Jews, there,\r\nare treated just like human beings, instead of dogs.  They can work at\r\nany business they please; they can sell brand new goods if they want to;\r\nthey can keep drug-stores; they can practice medicine among Christians;\r\nthey can even shake hands with Christians if they choose; they can\r\nassociate with them, just the same as one human being does with another\r\nhuman being; they don't have to stay shut up in one corner of the towns;\r\nthey can live in any part of a town they like best; it is said they even\r\nhave the privilege of buying land and houses, and owning them themselves,\r\nthough I doubt that, myself; they never have had to run races naked\r\nthrough the public streets, against jackasses, to please the people in\r\ncarnival time; there they never have been driven by the soldiers into a\r\nchurch every Sunday for hundreds of years to hear themselves and their\r\nreligion especially and particularly cursed; at this very day, in that\r\ncurious country, a Jew is allowed to vote, hold office, yea, get up on a\r\nrostrum in the public street and express his opinion of the government if\r\nthe government don't suit him!  Ah, it is wonderful.  The common people\r\nthere know a great deal; they even have the effrontery to complain if\r\nthey are not properly governed, and to take hold and help conduct the\r\ngovernment themselves; if they had laws like ours, which give one dollar\r\nof every three a crop produces to the government for taxes, they would\r\nhave that law altered: instead of paying thirty-three dollars in taxes,\r\nout of every one hundred they receive, they complain if they have to pay\r\nseven.  They are curious people.  They do not know when they are well\r\noff.  Mendicant priests do not prowl among them with baskets begging for\r\nthe church and eating up their substance.  One hardly ever sees a\r\nminister of the gospel going around there in his bare feet, with a\r\nbasket, begging for subsistence.  In that country the preachers are not\r\nlike our mendicant orders of friars--they have two or three suits of\r\nclothing, and they wash sometimes.  In that land are mountains far higher\r\nthan the Alban mountains; the vast Roman Campagna, a hundred miles long\r\nand full forty broad, is really small compared to the United States of\r\nAmerica; the Tiber, that celebrated river of ours, which stretches its\r\nmighty course almost two hundred miles, and which a lad can scarcely\r\nthrow a stone across at Rome, is not so long, nor yet so wide, as the\r\nAmerican Mississippi--nor yet the Ohio, nor even the Hudson.  In America\r\nthe people are absolutely wiser and know much more than their\r\ngrandfathers did.  They do not plow with a sharpened stick, nor yet with\r\na three-cornered block of wood that merely scratches the top of the\r\nground.  We do that because our fathers did, three thousand years ago, I\r\nsuppose.  But those people have no holy reverence for their ancestors.\r\nThey plow with a plow that is a sharp, curved blade of iron, and it cuts\r\ninto the earth full five inches.  And this is not all.  They cut their\r\ngrain with a horrid machine that mows down whole fields in a day.  If I\r\ndared, I would say that sometimes they use a blasphemous plow that works\r\nby fire and vapor and tears up an acre of ground in a single hour--but\r\n--but--I see by your looks that you do not believe the things I am telling\r\nyou.  Alas, my character is ruined, and I am a branded speaker of\r\nuntruths!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course we have been to the monster Church of St. Peter, frequently.\r\nI knew its dimensions.  I knew it was a prodigious structure.  I knew it\r\nwas just about the length of the capitol at Washington--say seven hundred\r\nand thirty feet.  I knew it was three hundred and sixty-four feet wide,\r\nand consequently wider than the capitol.  I knew that the cross on the\r\ntop of the dome of the church was four hundred and thirty-eight feet\r\nabove the ground, and therefore about a hundred or may be a hundred and\r\ntwenty-five feet higher than the dome of the capitol.--Thus I had one\r\ngauge.  I wished to come as near forming a correct idea of how it was\r\ngoing to look, as possible; I had a curiosity to see how much I would\r\nerr.  I erred considerably.  St. Peter's did not look nearly so large as\r\nthe capitol, and certainly not a twentieth part as beautiful, from the\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the door, and stood fairly within the church, it was\r\nimpossible to comprehend that it was a very large building.  I had to\r\ncipher a comprehension of it.  I had to ransack my memory for some more\r\nsimiles.  St. Peter's is bulky.  Its height and size would represent two\r\nof the Washington capitol set one on top of the other--if the capitol\r\nwere wider; or two blocks or two blocks and a half of ordinary buildings\r\nset one on top of the other.  St. Peter's was that large, but it could\r\nand would not look so.  The trouble was that every thing in it and about\r\nit was on such a scale of uniform vastness that there were no contrasts\r\nto judge by--none but the people, and I had not noticed them.  They were\r\ninsects.  The statues of children holding vases of holy water were\r\nimmense, according to the tables of figures, but so was every thing else\r\naround them.  The mosaic pictures in the dome were huge, and were made of\r\nthousands and thousands of cubes of glass as large as the end of my\r\nlittle finger, but those pictures looked smooth, and gaudy of color, and\r\nin good proportion to the dome.  Evidently they would not answer to\r\nmeasure by.  Away down toward the far end of the church (I thought it was\r\nreally clear at the far end, but discovered afterward that it was in the\r\ncentre, under the dome,) stood the thing they call the baldacchino--a\r\ngreat bronze pyramidal frame-work like that which upholds a mosquito bar.\r\nIt only looked like a considerably magnified bedstead--nothing more.  Yet\r\nI knew it was a good deal more than half as high as Niagara Falls.  It\r\nwas overshadowed by a dome so mighty that its own height was snubbed.\r\nThe four great square piers or pillars that stand equidistant from each\r\nother in the church, and support the roof, I could not work up to their\r\nreal dimensions by any method of comparison.  I knew that the faces of\r\neach were about the width of a very large dwelling-house front, (fifty or\r\nsixty feet,) and that they were twice as high as an ordinary three-story\r\ndwelling, but still they looked small.  I tried all the different ways I\r\ncould think of to compel myself to understand how large St. Peter's was,\r\nbut with small success.  The mosaic portrait of an Apostle who was\r\nwriting with a pen six feet long seemed only an ordinary Apostle.\r\n\r\nBut the people attracted my attention after a while.  To stand in the\r\ndoor of St. Peter's and look at men down toward its further extremity,\r\ntwo blocks away, has a diminishing effect on them; surrounded by the\r\nprodigious pictures and statues, and lost in the vast spaces, they look\r\nvery much smaller than they would if they stood two blocks away in the\r\nopen air.  I \xe2\x80\x9caveraged\xe2\x80\x9d a man as he passed me and watched him as he\r\ndrifted far down by the baldacchino and beyond--watched him dwindle to an\r\ninsignificant school-boy, and then, in the midst of the silent throng of\r\nhuman pigmies gliding about him, I lost him.  The church had lately been\r\ndecorated, on the occasion of a great ceremony in honor of St. Peter, and\r\nmen were engaged, now, in removing the flowers and gilt paper from the\r\nwalls and pillars.  As no ladders could reach the great heights, the men\r\nswung themselves down from balustrades and the capitals of pilasters by\r\nropes, to do this work.  The upper gallery which encircles the inner\r\nsweep of the dome is two hundred and forty feet above the floor of the\r\nchurch--very few steeples in America could reach up to it.  Visitors\r\nalways go up there to look down into the church because one gets the best\r\nidea of some of the heights and distances from that point.  While we\r\nstood on the floor one of the workmen swung loose from that gallery at\r\nthe end of a long rope.  I had not supposed, before, that a man could\r\nlook so much like a spider.  He was insignificant in size, and his rope\r\nseemed only a thread.  Seeing that he took up so little space, I could\r\nbelieve the story, then, that ten thousand troops went to St. Peter's,\r\nonce, to hear mass, and their commanding officer came afterward, and not\r\nfinding them, supposed they had not yet arrived.  But they were in the\r\nchurch, nevertheless--they were in one of the transepts.  Nearly fifty\r\nthousand persons assembled in St. Peter's to hear the publishing of the\r\ndogma of the Immaculate Conception.  It is estimated that the floor of\r\nthe church affords standing room for--for a large number of people; I\r\nhave forgotten the exact figures.  But it is no matter--it is near\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nThey have twelve small pillars, in St. Peter's, which came from Solomon's\r\nTemple.  They have, also--which was far more interesting to me--a piece\r\nof the true cross, and some nails, and a part of the crown of thorns.\r\n\r\nOf course we ascended to the summit of the dome, and of course we also\r\nwent up into the gilt copper ball which is above it.--There was room\r\nthere for a dozen persons, with a little crowding, and it was as close\r\nand hot as an oven.  Some of those people who are so fond of writing\r\ntheir names in prominent places had been there before us--a million or\r\ntwo, I should think.  From the dome of St. Peter's one can see every\r\nnotable object in Rome, from the Castle of St. Angelo to the Coliseum.\r\nHe can discern the seven hills upon which Rome is built.  He can see the\r\nTiber, and the locality of the bridge which Horatius kept \xe2\x80\x9cin the brave\r\ndays of old\xe2\x80\x9d when Lars Porsena attempted to cross it with his invading\r\nhost.  He can see the spot where the Horatii and the Curatii fought their\r\nfamous battle.  He can see the broad green Campagna, stretching away\r\ntoward the mountains, with its scattered arches and broken aqueducts of\r\nthe olden time, so picturesque in their gray ruin, and so daintily\r\nfestooned with vines.  He can see the Alban Mountains, the Appenines, the\r\nSabine Hills, and the blue Mediterranean.  He can see a panorama that is\r\nvaried, extensive, beautiful to the eye, and more illustrious in history\r\nthan any other in Europe.--About his feet is spread the remnant of a\r\ncity that once had a population of four million souls; and among its\r\nmassed edifices stand the ruins of temples, columns, and triumphal arches\r\nthat knew the Caesars, and the noonday of Roman splendor; and close by\r\nthem, in unimpaired strength, is a drain of arched and heavy masonry that\r\nbelonged to that older city which stood here before Romulus and Remus\r\nwere born or Rome thought of.  The Appian Way is here yet, and looking\r\nmuch as it did, perhaps, when the triumphal processions of the Emperors\r\nmoved over it in other days bringing fettered princes from the confines\r\nof the earth.  We can not see the long array of chariots and mail-clad\r\nmen laden with the spoils of conquest, but we can imagine the pageant,\r\nafter a fashion.  We look out upon many objects of interest from the dome\r\nof St. Peter's; and last of all, almost at our feet, our eyes rest upon\r\nthe building which was once the Inquisition.  How times changed, between\r\nthe older ages and the new!  Some seventeen or eighteen centuries ago,\r\nthe ignorant men of Rome were wont to put Christians in the arena of the\r\nColiseum yonder, and turn the wild beasts in upon them for a show.  It\r\nwas for a lesson as well.  It was to teach the people to abhor and fear\r\nthe new doctrine the followers of Christ were teaching.  The beasts tore\r\nthe victims limb from limb and made poor mangled corpses of them in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye.  But when the Christians came into power, when the\r\nholy Mother Church became mistress of the barbarians, she taught them the\r\nerror of their ways by no such means.  No, she put them in this pleasant\r\nInquisition and pointed to the Blessed Redeemer, who was so gentle and so\r\nmerciful toward all men, and they urged the barbarians to love him; and\r\nthey did all they could to persuade them to love and honor him--first by\r\ntwisting their thumbs out of joint with a screw; then by nipping their\r\nflesh with pincers--red-hot ones, because they are the most comfortable\r\nin cold weather; then by skinning them alive a little, and finally by\r\nroasting them in public.  They always convinced those barbarians.  The\r\ntrue religion, properly administered, as the good Mother Church used to\r\nadminister it, is very, very soothing.  It is wonderfully persuasive,\r\nalso.  There is a great difference between feeding parties to wild beasts\r\nand stirring up their finer feelings in an Inquisition.  One is the\r\nsystem of degraded barbarians, the other of enlightened, civilized\r\npeople.  It is a great pity the playful Inquisition is no more.\r\n\r\nI prefer not to describe St. Peter's.  It has been done before.  The\r\nashes of Peter, the disciple of the Saviour, repose in a crypt under the\r\nbaldacchino.  We stood reverently in that place; so did we also in the\r\nMamertine Prison, where he was confined, where he converted the soldiers,\r\nand where tradition says he caused a spring of water to flow in order\r\nthat he might baptize them.  But when they showed us the print of Peter's\r\nface in the hard stone of the prison wall and said he made that by\r\nfalling up against it, we doubted.  And when, also, the monk at the\r\nchurch of San Sebastian showed us a paving-stone with two great\r\nfootprints in it and said that Peter's feet made those, we lacked\r\nconfidence again.  Such things do not impress one.  The monk said that\r\nangels came and liberated Peter from prison by night, and he started away\r\nfrom Rome by the Appian Way.  The Saviour met him and told him to go\r\nback, which he did.  Peter left those footprints in the stone upon which\r\nhe stood at the time.  It was not stated how it was ever discovered whose\r\nfootprints they were, seeing the interview occurred secretly and at\r\nnight.  The print of the face in the prison was that of a man of common\r\nsize; the footprints were those of a man ten or twelve feet high.  The\r\ndiscrepancy confirmed our unbelief.\r\n\r\nWe necessarily visited the Forum, where Caesar was assassinated, and also\r\nthe Tarpeian Rock.  We saw the Dying Gladiator at the Capitol, and I\r\nthink that even we appreciated that wonder of art; as much, perhaps, as\r\nwe did that fearful story wrought in marble, in the Vatican--the Laocoon.\r\nAnd then the Coliseum.\r\n\r\nEvery body knows the picture of the Coliseum; every body recognizes at\r\nonce that \xe2\x80\x9clooped and windowed\xe2\x80\x9d band-box with a side bitten out.  Being\r\nrather isolated, it shows to better advantage than any other of the\r\nmonuments of ancient Rome.  Even the beautiful Pantheon, whose pagan\r\naltars uphold the cross, now, and whose Venus, tricked out in consecrated\r\ngimcracks, does reluctant duty as a Virgin Mary to-day, is built about\r\nwith shabby houses and its stateliness sadly marred.  But the monarch of\r\nall European ruins, the Coliseum, maintains that reserve and that royal\r\nseclusion which is proper to majesty.  Weeds and flowers spring from its\r\nmassy arches and its circling seats, and vines hang their fringes from\r\nits lofty walls.  An impressive silence broods over the monstrous\r\nstructure where such multitudes of men and women were wont to assemble in\r\nother days.  The butterflies have taken the places of the queens of\r\nfashion and beauty of eighteen centuries ago, and the lizards sun\r\nthemselves in the sacred seat of the Emperor.  More vividly than all the\r\nwritten histories, the Coliseum tells the story of Rome's grandeur and\r\nRome's decay.  It is the worthiest type of both that exists.  Moving\r\nabout the Rome of to-day, we might find it hard to believe in her old\r\nmagnificence and her millions of population; but with this stubborn\r\nevidence before us that she was obliged to have a theatre with sitting\r\nroom for eighty thousand persons and standing room for twenty thousand\r\nmore, to accommodate such of her citizens as required amusement, we find\r\nbelief less difficult.  The Coliseum is over one thousand six hundred\r\nfeet long, seven hundred and fifty wide, and one hundred and sixty-five\r\nhigh.  Its shape is oval.\r\n\r\nIn America we make convicts useful at the same time that we punish them\r\nfor their crimes.  We farm them out and compel them to earn money for the\r\nState by making barrels and building roads.  Thus we combine business\r\nwith retribution, and all things are lovely.  But in ancient Rome they\r\ncombined religious duty with pleasure.  Since it was necessary that the\r\nnew sect called Christians should be exterminated, the people judged it\r\nwise to make this work profitable to the State at the same time, and\r\nentertaining to the public.  In addition to the gladiatorial combats and\r\nother shows, they sometimes threw members of the hated sect into the\r\narena of the Coliseum and turned wild beasts in upon them.  It is\r\nestimated that seventy thousand Christians suffered martyrdom in this\r\nplace.  This has made the Coliseum holy ground, in the eyes of the\r\nfollowers of the Saviour.  And well it might; for if the chain that bound\r\na saint, and the footprints a saint has left upon a stone he chanced to\r\nstand upon, be holy, surely the spot where a man gave up his life for his\r\nfaith is holy.\r\n\r\nSeventeen or eighteen centuries ago this Coliseum was the theatre of\r\nRome, and Rome was mistress of the world.  Splendid pageants were\r\nexhibited here, in presence of the Emperor, the great ministers of State,\r\nthe nobles, and vast audiences of citizens of smaller consequence.\r\nGladiators fought with gladiators and at times with warrior prisoners\r\nfrom many a distant land.  It was the theatre of Rome--of the world--and\r\nthe man of fashion who could not let fall in a casual and unintentional\r\nmanner something about \xe2\x80\x9cmy private box at the Coliseum\xe2\x80\x9d could not move in\r\nthe first circles.  When the clothing-store merchant wished to consume\r\nthe corner grocery man with envy, he bought secured seats in the front\r\nrow and let the thing be known.  When the irresistible dry goods clerk\r\nwished to blight and destroy, according to his native instinct, he got\r\nhimself up regardless of expense and took some other fellow's young lady\r\nto the Coliseum, and then accented the affront by cramming her with ice\r\ncream between the acts, or by approaching the cage and stirring up the\r\nmartyrs with his whalebone cane for her edification.  The Roman swell was\r\nin his true element only when he stood up against a pillar and fingered\r\nhis moustache unconscious of the ladies; when he viewed the bloody\r\ncombats through an opera-glass two inches long; when he excited the envy\r\nof provincials by criticisms which showed that he had been to the\r\nColiseum many and many a time and was long ago over the novelty of it;\r\nwhen he turned away with a yawn at last and said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe a star! handles his sword like an apprentice brigand! he'll do for\r\nthe country, may be, but he don't answer for the metropolis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGlad was the contraband that had a seat in the pit at the Saturday\r\nmatinee, and happy the Roman street-boy who ate his peanuts and guyed the\r\ngladiators from the dizzy gallery.\r\n\r\nFor me was reserved the high honor of discovering among the rubbish of\r\nthe ruined Coliseum the only playbill of that establishment now extant.\r\nThere was a suggestive smell of mint-drops about it still, a corner of it\r\nhad evidently been chewed, and on the margin, in choice Latin, these\r\nwords were written in a delicate female hand:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cMeet me on the Tarpeian Rock tomorrow evening, dear, at sharp\r\n     seven.  Mother will be absent on a visit to her friends in the\r\n     Sabine Hills.

The management beg leave to state that\r\nthey have succeeded in securing the services of a\r\n\r\n                            GALAXY OF TALENT!\r\nsuch as has not been beheld in Rome before.\r\n\r\nThe performance will commence this evening with a\r\n\r\n                         GRAND BROADSWORD COMBAT!\r\nbetween two young and promising amateurs and a celebrated Parthian\r\ngladiator who has just arrived a prisoner from the Camp of Verus.\r\n\r\nThis will be followed by a grand moral\r\n\r\n                          BATTLE-AX ENGAGEMENT!\r\nbetween the renowned Valerian (with one hand tied behind him,) and two\r\ngigantic savages from Britain.\r\n\r\nAfter which the renowned Valerian (if he survive,) will fight with the\r\nbroad-sword,\r\n\r\n                               LEFT HANDED!\r\nagainst six Sophomores and a Freshman from the Gladiatorial College!\r\n\r\nA long series of brilliant engagements will follow, in which the finest\r\ntalent of the Empire will take part\r\n\r\nAfter which the celebrated Infant Prodigy known as\r\n\r\n                          \xe2\x80\x9cTHE YOUNG ACHILLES,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n will engage four tiger whelps in combat, armed with no other weapon than\r\nhis little spear!\r\n\r\nThe whole to conclude with a chaste and elegant\r\n\r\n                            GENERAL SLAUGHTER!\r\nIn which thirteen African Lions and twenty-two Barbarian Prisoners will\r\nwar with each other until all are exterminated.\r\n\r\n                           BOX OFFICE NOW OPEN.\r\n\r\nDress Circle One Dollar; Children and Servants half price.\r\n\r\nAn efficient police force will be on hand to preserve order and keep the\r\nwild beasts from leaping the railings and discommoding the audience.\r\n\r\nDoors open at 7; performance begins at 8.\r\n\r\nPOSITIVELY NO FREE LIST.\r\n\r\n                          Diodorus Job Press.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was as singular as it was gratifying that I was also so fortunate as\r\nto find among the rubbish of the arena, a stained and mutilated copy of\r\nthe Roman Daily Battle-Ax, containing a critique upon this very\r\nperformance.  It comes to hand too late by many centuries to rank as\r\nnews, and therefore I translate and publish it simply to show how very\r\nlittle the general style and phraseology of dramatic criticism has\r\naltered in the ages that have dragged their slow length along since the\r\ncarriers laid this one damp and fresh before their Roman patrons:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cTHE OPENING SEASON.--COLISEUM.--Notwithstanding the inclemency of\r\n     the weather, quite a respectable number of the rank and fashion of\r\n     the city assembled last night to witness the debut upon metropolitan\r\n     boards of the young tragedian who has of late been winning such\r\n     golden opinions in the amphitheatres of the provinces.  Some sixty\r\n     thousand persons were present, and but for the fact that the streets\r\n     were almost impassable, it is fair to presume that the house would\r\n     have been full.  His august Majesty, the Emperor Aurelius, occupied\r\n     the imperial box, and was the cynosure of all eyes.  Many\r\n     illustrious nobles and generals of the Empire graced the occasion\r\n     with their presence, and not the least among them was the young\r\n     patrician lieutenant whose laurels, won in the ranks of the\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThundering Legion,\xe2\x80\x9d are still so green upon his brow.  The cheer\r\n     which greeted his entrance was heard beyond the Tiber!\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe late repairs and decorations add both to the comeliness and the\r\n     comfort of the Coliseum.  The new cushions are a great improvement\r\n     upon the hard marble seats we have been so long accustomed to.  The\r\n     present management deserve well of the public.  They have restored\r\n     to the Coliseum the gilding, the rich upholstery and the uniform\r\n     magnificence which old Coliseum frequenters tell us Rome was so\r\n     proud of fifty years ago.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe opening scene last night--the broadsword combat between two\r\n     young amateurs and a famous Parthian gladiator who was sent here a\r\n     prisoner--was very fine.  The elder of the two young gentlemen\r\n     handled his weapon with a grace that marked the possession of\r\n     extraordinary talent.  His feint of thrusting, followed instantly by\r\n     a happily delivered blow which unhelmeted the Parthian, was received\r\n     with hearty applause.  He was not thoroughly up in the backhanded\r\n     stroke, but it was very gratifying to his numerous friends to know\r\n     that, in time, practice would have overcome this defect.  However,\r\n     he was killed.  His sisters, who were present, expressed\r\n     considerable regret.  His mother left the Coliseum.  The other youth\r\n     maintained the contest with such spirit as to call forth\r\n     enthusiastic bursts of applause.  When at last he fell a corpse, his\r\n     aged mother ran screaming, with hair disheveled and tears streaming\r\n     from her eyes, and swooned away just as her hands were clutching at\r\n     the railings of the arena.  She was promptly removed by the police.\r\n     Under the circumstances the woman's conduct was pardonable, perhaps,\r\n     but we suggest that such exhibitions interfere with the decorum\r\n     which should be preserved during the performances, and are highly\r\n     improper in the presence of the Emperor.  The Parthian prisoner\r\n     fought bravely and well; and well he might, for he was fighting for\r\n     both life and liberty.  His wife and children were there to nerve\r\n     his arm with their love, and to remind him of the old home he should\r\n     see again if he conquered.  When his second assailant fell, the\r\n     woman clasped her children to her breast and wept for joy.  But it\r\n     was only a transient happiness.  The captive staggered toward her\r\n     and she saw that the liberty he had earned was earned too late.  He\r\n     was wounded unto death.  Thus the first act closed in a manner which\r\n     was entirely satisfactory.  The manager was called before the\r\n     curtain and returned his thanks for the honor done him, in a speech\r\n     which was replete with wit and humor, and closed by hoping that his\r\n     humble efforts to afford cheerful and instructive entertainment\r\n     would continue to meet with the approbation of the Roman public\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe star now appeared, and was received with vociferous applause\r\n     and the simultaneous waving of sixty thousand handkerchiefs.  Marcus\r\n     Marcellus Valerian (stage name--his real name is Smith,) is a\r\n     splendid specimen of physical development, and an artist of rare\r\n     merit.  His management of the battle-ax is wonderful.  His gayety\r\n     and his playfulness are irresistible, in his comic parts, and yet\r\n     they are inferior to his sublime conceptions in the grave realm of\r\n     tragedy.  When his ax was describing fiery circles about the heads\r\n     of the bewildered barbarians, in exact time with his springing body\r\n     and his prancing legs, the audience gave way to uncontrollable\r\n     bursts of laughter; but when the back of his weapon broke the skull\r\n     of one and almost in the same instant its edge clove the other's\r\n     body in twain, the howl of enthusiastic applause that shook the\r\n     building, was the acknowledgment of a critical assemblage that he\r\n     was a master of the noblest department of his profession.  If he has\r\n     a fault, (and we are sorry to even intimate that he has,) it is that\r\n     of glancing at the audience, in the midst of the most exciting\r\n     moments of the performance, as if seeking admiration.  The pausing\r\n     in a fight to bow when bouquets are thrown to him is also in bad\r\n     taste.  In the great left-handed combat he appeared to be looking at\r\n     the audience half the time, instead of carving his adversaries; and\r\n     when he had slain all the sophomores and was dallying with the\r\n     freshman, he stooped and snatched a bouquet as it fell, and offered\r\n     it to his adversary at a time when a blow was descending which\r\n     promised favorably to be his death-warrant.  Such levity is proper\r\n     enough in the provinces, we make no doubt, but it ill suits the\r\n     dignity of the metropolis.  We trust our young friend will take\r\n     these remarks in good part, for we mean them solely for his benefit.\r\n     All who know us are aware that although we are at times justly\r\n     severe upon tigers and martyrs, we never intentionally offend\r\n     gladiators.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe Infant Prodigy performed wonders.  He overcame his four tiger\r\n     whelps with ease, and with no other hurt than the loss of a portion\r\n     of his scalp.  The General Slaughter was rendered with a\r\n     faithfulness to details which reflects the highest credit upon the\r\n     late participants in it.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cUpon the whole, last night's performances shed honor not only upon\r\n     the management but upon the city that encourages and sustains such\r\n     wholesome and instructive entertainments.  We would simply suggest\r\n     that the practice of vulgar young boys in the gallery of shying\r\n     peanuts and paper pellets at the tigers, and saying \xe2\x80\x9cHi-yi!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n     manifesting approbation or dissatisfaction by such observations as\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cBully for the lion!\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cGo it, Gladdy!\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cBoots!\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cSpeech!\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cTake\r\n     a walk round the block!\xe2\x80\x9d  and so on, are extremely reprehensible,\r\n     when the Emperor is present, and ought to be stopped by the police.\r\n     Several times last night, when the supernumeraries entered the arena\r\n     to drag out the bodies, the young ruffians in the gallery shouted,\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cSupe! supe!\xe2\x80\x9d  and also, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a coat!\xe2\x80\x9d  and \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don't you pad\r\n     them shanks?\xe2\x80\x9d  and made use of various other remarks expressive of\r\n     derision.  These things are very annoying to the audience.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cA matinee for the little folks is promised for this afternoon, on\r\n     which occasion several martyrs will be eaten by the tigers.  The\r\n     regular performance will continue every night till further notice.\r\n     Material change of programme every evening.  Benefit of Valerian,\r\n     Tuesday, 29th, if he lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been a dramatic critic myself, in my time, and I was often\r\nsurprised to notice how much more I knew about Hamlet than Forrest did;\r\nand it gratifies me to observe, now, how much better my brethren of\r\nancient times knew how a broad sword battle ought to be fought than the\r\ngladiators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nSo far, good.  If any man has a right to feel proud of himself, and\r\nsatisfied, surely it is I.  For I have written about the Coliseum, and\r\nthe gladiators, the martyrs, and the lions, and yet have never once used\r\nthe phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbutchered to make a Roman holiday.\xe2\x80\x9d  I am the only free white\r\nman of mature age, who has accomplished this since Byron originated the\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nButchered to make a Roman holiday sounds well for the first seventeen or\r\neighteen hundred thousand times one sees it in print, but after that it\r\nbegins to grow tiresome.  I find it in all the books concerning Rome--and\r\nhere latterly it reminds me of Judge Oliver.  Oliver was a young lawyer,\r\nfresh from the schools, who had gone out to the deserts of Nevada to\r\nbegin life.  He found that country, and our ways of life, there, in those\r\nearly days, different from life in New England or Paris.  But he put on a\r\nwoollen shirt and strapped a navy revolver to his person, took to the\r\nbacon and beans of the country, and determined to do in Nevada as Nevada\r\ndid.  Oliver accepted the situation so completely that although he must\r\nhave sorrowed over many of his trials, he never complained--that is, he\r\nnever complained but once.  He, two others, and myself, started to the\r\nnew silver mines in the Humboldt mountains--he to be Probate Judge of\r\nHumboldt county, and we to mine.  The distance was two hundred miles.  It\r\nwas dead of winter.  We bought a two-horse wagon and put eighteen hundred\r\npounds of bacon, flour, beans, blasting-powder, picks and shovels in it;\r\nwe bought two sorry-looking Mexican \xe2\x80\x9cplugs,\xe2\x80\x9d with the hair turned the\r\nwrong way and more corners on their bodies than there are on the mosque\r\nof Omar; we hitched up and started.  It was a dreadful trip.  But Oliver\r\ndid not complain.  The horses dragged the wagon two miles from town and\r\nthen gave out.  Then we three pushed the wagon seven miles, and Oliver\r\nmoved ahead and pulled the horses after him by the bits.  We complained,\r\nbut Oliver did not.  The ground was frozen, and it froze our backs while\r\nwe slept; the wind swept across our faces and froze our noses.  Oliver\r\ndid not complain.  Five days of pushing the wagon by day and freezing by\r\nnight brought us to the bad part of the journey--the Forty Mile Desert,\r\nor the Great American Desert, if you please.  Still, this\r\nmildest-mannered man that ever was, had not complained.  We started across\r\nat eight in the morning, pushing through sand that had no bottom; toiling\r\nall day long by the wrecks of a thousand wagons, the skeletons of ten\r\nthousand oxen; by wagon-tires enough to hoop the Washington Monument to\r\nthe top, and ox-chains enough to girdle Long Island; by human graves;\r\nwith our throats parched always, with thirst; lips bleeding from the\r\nalkali dust; hungry, perspiring, and very, very weary--so weary that when\r\nwe dropped in the sand every fifty yards to rest the horses, we could\r\nhardly keep from going to sleep--no complaints from Oliver: none the next\r\nmorning at three o'clock, when we got across, tired to death.\r\n\r\nAwakened two or three nights afterward at midnight, in a narrow canon, by\r\nthe snow falling on our faces, and appalled at the imminent danger of\r\nbeing \xe2\x80\x9csnowed in,\xe2\x80\x9d we harnessed up and pushed on till eight in the\r\nmorning, passed the \xe2\x80\x9cDivide\xe2\x80\x9d and knew we were saved.  No complaints.\r\nFifteen days of hardship and fatigue brought us to the end of the two\r\nhundred miles, and the Judge had not complained.  We wondered if any\r\nthing could exasperate him.  We built a Humboldt house.  It is done in\r\nthis way.  You dig a square in the steep base of the mountain, and set up\r\ntwo uprights and top them with two joists.  Then you stretch a great\r\nsheet of \xe2\x80\x9ccotton domestic\xe2\x80\x9d from the point where the joists join the\r\nhill-side down over the joists to the ground; this makes the roof and the\r\nfront of the mansion; the sides and back are the dirt walls your digging\r\nhas left.  A chimney is easily made by turning up one corner of the roof.\r\nOliver was sitting alone in this dismal den, one night, by a sage-brush\r\nfire, writing poetry; he was very fond of digging poetry out of himself\r\n--or blasting it out when it came hard.  He heard an animal's footsteps\r\nclose to the roof; a stone or two and some dirt came through and fell by\r\nhim.  He grew uneasy and said \xe2\x80\x9cHi!--clear out from there, can't you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n --from time to time.  But by and by he fell asleep where he sat, and pretty\r\nsoon a mule fell down the chimney!  The fire flew in every direction, and\r\nOliver went over backwards.  About ten nights after that, he recovered\r\nconfidence enough to go to writing poetry again.  Again he dozed off to\r\nsleep, and again a mule fell down the chimney.  This time, about half of\r\nthat side of the house came in with the mule.  Struggling to get up, the\r\nmule kicked the candle out and smashed most of the kitchen furniture, and\r\nraised considerable dust.  These violent awakenings must have been\r\nannoying to Oliver, but he never complained.  He moved to a mansion on\r\nthe opposite side of the canon, because he had noticed the mules did not\r\ngo there.  One night about eight o'clock he was endeavoring to finish his\r\npoem, when a stone rolled in--then a hoof appeared below the canvas--then\r\npart of a cow--the after part.  He leaned back in dread, and shouted\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooy! hooy! get out of this!\xe2\x80\x9d  and the cow struggled manfully--lost\r\nground steadily--dirt and dust streamed down, and before Oliver could get\r\nwell away, the entire cow crashed through on to the table and made a\r\nshapeless wreck of every thing!\r\n\r\nThen, for the first time in his life, I think, Oliver complained.  He\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis thing is growing monotonous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he resigned his judgeship and left Humboldt county.  \xe2\x80\x9cButchered to\r\nmake a Roman holyday\xe2\x80\x9d has grown monotonous to me.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I wish to say one word about Michael Angelo\r\nBuonarotti.  I used to worship the mighty genius of Michael Angelo--that\r\nman who was great in poetry, painting, sculpture, architecture--great in\r\nevery thing he undertook.  But I do not want Michael Angelo for\r\nbreakfast--for luncheon--for dinner--for tea--for supper--for between\r\nmeals.  I like a change, occasionally.  In Genoa, he designed every\r\nthing; in Milan he or his pupils designed every thing; he designed the\r\nLake of Como; in Padua, Verona, Venice, Bologna, who did we ever hear of,\r\nfrom guides, but Michael Angelo?  In Florence, he painted every thing,\r\ndesigned every thing, nearly, and what he did not design he used to sit\r\non a favorite stone and look at, and they showed us the stone.  In Pisa\r\nhe designed every thing but the old shot-tower, and they would have\r\nattributed that to him if it had not been so awfully out of the\r\nperpendicular.  He designed the piers of Leghorn and the custom house\r\nregulations of Civita Vecchia.  But, here--here it is frightful.  He\r\ndesigned St. Peter's; he designed the Pope; he designed the Pantheon, the\r\nuniform of the Pope's soldiers, the Tiber, the Vatican, the Coliseum, the\r\nCapitol, the Tarpeian Rock, the Barberini Palace, St. John Lateran, the\r\nCampagna, the Appian Way, the Seven Hills, the Baths of Caracalla, the\r\nClaudian Aqueduct, the Cloaca Maxima--the eternal bore designed the\r\nEternal City, and unless all men and books do lie, he painted every thing\r\nin it!  Dan said the other day to the guide, \xe2\x80\x9cEnough, enough, enough!\r\nSay no more!  Lump the whole thing! say that the Creator made Italy from\r\ndesigns by Michael Angelo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI never felt so fervently thankful, so soothed, so tranquil, so filled\r\nwith a blessed peace, as I did yesterday when I learned that Michael\r\nAngelo was dead.\r\n\r\nBut we have taken it out of this guide.  He has marched us through miles\r\nof pictures and sculpture in the vast corridors of the Vatican; and\r\nthrough miles of pictures and sculpture in twenty other palaces; he has\r\nshown us the great picture in the Sistine Chapel, and frescoes enough to\r\nfrescoe the heavens--pretty much all done by Michael Angelo.  So with him\r\nwe have played that game which has vanquished so many guides for us\r\n--imbecility and idiotic questions.  These creatures never suspect--they\r\nhave no idea of a sarcasm.\r\n\r\nHe shows us a figure and says: \xe2\x80\x9cStatoo brunzo.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Bronze statue.)\r\n\r\nWe look at it indifferently and the doctor asks: \xe2\x80\x9cBy Michael Angelo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--not know who.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he shows us the ancient Roman Forum.  The doctor asks: \xe2\x80\x9cMichael\r\nAngelo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA stare from the guide.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo--thousan' year before he is born.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen an Egyptian obelisk.  Again: \xe2\x80\x9cMichael Angelo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mon dieu, genteelmen!  Zis is two thousan' year before he is born!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe grows so tired of that unceasing question sometimes, that he dreads to\r\nshow us any thing at all.  The wretch has tried all the ways he can think\r\nof to make us comprehend that Michael Angelo is only responsible for the\r\ncreation of a part of the world, but somehow he has not succeeded yet.\r\nRelief for overtasked eyes and brain from study and sightseeing is\r\nnecessary, or we shall become idiotic sure enough.  Therefore this guide\r\nmust continue to suffer.  If he does not enjoy it, so much the worse for\r\nhim.  We do.\r\n\r\nIn this place I may as well jot down a chapter concerning those necessary\r\nnuisances, European guides.  Many a man has wished in his heart he could\r\ndo without his guide; but knowing he could not, has wished he could get\r\nsome amusement out of him as a remuneration for the affliction of his\r\nsociety.  We accomplished this latter matter, and if our experience can\r\nbe made useful to others they are welcome to it.\r\n\r\nGuides know about enough English to tangle every thing up so that a man\r\ncan make neither head or tail of it.  They know their story by heart--the\r\nhistory of every statue, painting, cathedral or other wonder they show\r\nyou.  They know it and tell it as a parrot would--and if you interrupt,\r\nand throw them off the track, they have to go back and begin over again.\r\nAll their lives long, they are employed in showing strange things to\r\nforeigners and listening to their bursts of admiration.  It is human\r\nnature to take delight in exciting admiration.  It is what prompts\r\nchildren to say \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d things, and do absurd ones, and in other ways\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshow off\xe2\x80\x9d when company is present.  It is what makes gossips turn out in\r\nrain and storm to go and be the first to tell a startling bit of news.\r\nThink, then, what a passion it becomes with a guide, whose privilege it\r\nis, every day, to show to strangers wonders that throw them into perfect\r\necstasies of admiration!  He gets so that he could not by any possibility\r\nlive in a soberer atmosphere.  After we discovered this, we never went\r\ninto ecstasies any more--we never admired any thing--we never showed any\r\nbut impassible faces and stupid indifference in the presence of the\r\nsublimest wonders a guide had to display.  We had found their weak point.\r\nWe have made good use of it ever since.  We have made some of those\r\npeople savage, at times, but we have never lost our own serenity.\r\n\r\nThe doctor asks the questions, generally, because he can keep his\r\ncountenance, and look more like an inspired idiot, and throw more\r\nimbecility into the tone of his voice than any man that lives.  It comes\r\nnatural to him.\r\n\r\nThe guides in Genoa are delighted to secure an American party, because\r\nAmericans so much wonder, and deal so much in sentiment and emotion\r\nbefore any relic of Columbus.  Our guide there fidgeted about as if he\r\nhad swallowed a spring mattress.  He was full of animation--full of\r\nimpatience.  He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome wis me, genteelmen!--come!  I show you ze letter writing by\r\nChristopher Colombo!--write it himself!--write it wis his own hand!\r\n--come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took us to the municipal palace.  After much impressive fumbling of\r\nkeys and opening of locks, the stained and aged document was spread\r\nbefore us.  The guide's eyes sparkled.  He danced about us and tapped the\r\nparchment with his finger:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I tell you, genteelmen!  Is it not so?  See! handwriting\r\nChristopher Colombo!--write it himself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe looked indifferent--unconcerned.  The doctor examined the document\r\nvery deliberately, during a painful pause.--Then he said, without any\r\nshow of interest:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh--Ferguson--what--what did you say was the name of the party who wrote\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristopher Colombo! ze great Christopher Colombo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother deliberate examination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh--did he write it himself; or--or how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe write it himself!--Christopher Colombo!  He's own hand-writing, write\r\nby himself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the doctor laid the document down and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I have seen boys in America only fourteen years old that could\r\nwrite better than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut zis is ze great Christo--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't care who it is!  It's the worst writing I ever saw.  Now you\r\nmusn't think you can impose on us because we are strangers.  We are not\r\nfools, by a good deal.  If you have got any specimens of penmanship of\r\nreal merit, trot them out!--and if you haven't, drive on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe drove on.  The guide was considerably shaken up, but he made one more\r\nventure.  He had something which he thought would overcome us.  He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, genteelmen, you come wis me!  I show you beautiful, O, magnificent\r\nbust Christopher Colombo!--splendid, grand, magnificent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe brought us before the beautiful bust--for it was beautiful--and sprang\r\nback and struck an attitude:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, look, genteelmen!--beautiful, grand,--bust Christopher Colombo!\r\n--beautiful bust, beautiful pedestal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor put up his eye-glass--procured for such occasions:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh--what did you say this gentleman's name was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristopher Colombo!--ze great Christopher Colombo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristopher Colombo--the great Christopher Colombo.  Well, what did he\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiscover America!--discover America, Oh, ze devil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiscover America.  No--that statement will hardly wash.  We are just\r\nfrom America ourselves.  We heard nothing about it.  Christopher Colombo\r\n--pleasant name--is--is he dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, corpo di Baccho!--three hundred year!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he die of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know!--I can not tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmall-pox, think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know, genteelmen!--I do not know what he die of!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeasles, likely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay be--may be--I do not know--I think he die of somethings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParents living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIm-poseeeble!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh--which is the bust and which is the pedestal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSanta Maria!--zis ze bust!--zis ze pedestal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I see, I see--happy combination--very happy combination, indeed.\r\nIs--is this the first time this gentleman was ever on a bust?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat joke was lost on the foreigner--guides can not master the subtleties\r\nof the American joke.\r\n\r\nWe have made it interesting for this Roman guide.  Yesterday we spent\r\nthree or four hours in the Vatican, again, that wonderful world of\r\ncuriosities.  We came very near expressing interest, sometimes--even\r\nadmiration--it was very hard to keep from it.  We succeeded though.\r\nNobody else ever did, in the Vatican museums.  The guide was bewildered\r\n--non-plussed.  He walked his legs off, nearly, hunting up extraordinary\r\nthings, and exhausted all his ingenuity on us, but it was a failure; we\r\nnever showed any interest in any thing.  He had reserved what he\r\nconsidered to be his greatest wonder till the last--a royal Egyptian\r\nmummy, the best preserved in the world, perhaps.  He took us there.  He\r\nfelt so sure, this time, that some of his old enthusiasm came back to\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, genteelmen!--Mummy!  Mummy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eye-glass came up as calmly, as deliberately as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,--Ferguson--what did I understand you to say the gentleman's name\r\nwas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cName?--he got no name!--Mummy!--'Gyptian mummy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes.  Born here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! 'Gyptian mummy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, just so.  Frenchman, I presume?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!--not Frenchman, not Roman!--born in Egypta!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBorn in Egypta.  Never heard of Egypta before.  Foreign locality,\r\nlikely.  Mummy--mummy.  How calm he is--how self-possessed.  Is, ah--is\r\nhe dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, sacre bleu, been dead three thousan' year!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor turned on him savagely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, now, what do you mean by such conduct as this!  Playing us for\r\nChinamen because we are strangers and trying to learn!  Trying to impose\r\nyour vile second-hand carcasses on us!--thunder and lightning, I've a\r\nnotion to--to--if you've got a nice fresh corpse, fetch him out!--or by\r\nGeorge we'll brain you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe make it exceedingly interesting for this Frenchman.  However, he has\r\npaid us back, partly, without knowing it.  He came to the hotel this\r\nmorning to ask if we were up, and he endeavored as well as he could to\r\ndescribe us, so that the landlord would know which persons he meant.  He\r\nfinished with the casual remark that we were lunatics.  The observation\r\nwas so innocent and so honest that it amounted to a very good thing for a\r\nguide to say.\r\n\r\nThere is one remark (already mentioned,) which never yet has failed to\r\ndisgust these guides.  We use it always, when we can think of nothing\r\nelse to say.  After they have exhausted their enthusiasm pointing out\r\nto us and praising the beauties of some ancient bronze image or\r\nbroken-legged statue, we look at it stupidly and in silence for five,\r\nten, fifteen minutes--as long as we can hold out, in fact--and then ask:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs--is he dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat conquers the serenest of them.  It is not what they are looking for\r\n--especially a new guide.  Our Roman Ferguson is the most patient,\r\nunsuspecting, long-suffering subject we have had yet.  We shall be sorry\r\nto part with him.  We have enjoyed his society very much.  We trust he\r\nhas enjoyed ours, but we are harassed with doubts.\r\n\r\nWe have been in the catacombs.  It was like going down into a very deep\r\ncellar, only it was a cellar which had no end to it.  The narrow passages\r\nare roughly hewn in the rock, and on each hand as you pass along, the\r\nhollowed shelves are carved out, from three to fourteen deep; each held a\r\ncorpse once.  There are names, and Christian symbols, and prayers, or\r\nsentences expressive of Christian hopes, carved upon nearly every\r\nsarcophagus.  The dates belong away back in the dawn of the Christian\r\nera, of course.  Here, in these holes in the ground, the first Christians\r\nsometimes burrowed to escape persecution.  They crawled out at night to\r\nget food, but remained under cover in the day time.  The priest told us\r\nthat St. Sebastian lived under ground for some time while he was being\r\nhunted; he went out one day, and the soldiery discovered and shot him to\r\ndeath with arrows.  Five or six of the early Popes--those who reigned\r\nabout sixteen hundred years ago--held their papal courts and advised with\r\ntheir clergy in the bowels of the earth.  During seventeen years--from\r\nA.D. 235 to A.D. 252--the Popes did not appear above ground.  Four were\r\nraised to the great office during that period.  Four years apiece, or\r\nthereabouts.  It is very suggestive of the unhealthiness of underground\r\ngraveyards as places of residence.  One Pope afterward spent his entire\r\npontificate in the catacombs--eight years.  Another was discovered in\r\nthem and murdered in the episcopal chair.  There was no satisfaction in\r\nbeing a Pope in those days.  There were too many annoyances.  There are\r\none hundred and sixty catacombs under Rome, each with its maze of narrow\r\npassages crossing and recrossing each other and each passage walled to\r\nthe top with scooped graves its entire length.  A careful estimate makes\r\nthe length of the passages of all the catacombs combined foot up nine\r\nhundred miles, and their graves number seven millions.  We did not go\r\nthrough all the passages of all the catacombs.  We were very anxious to\r\ndo it, and made the necessary arrangements, but our too limited time\r\nobliged us to give up the idea.  So we only groped through the dismal\r\nlabyrinth of St. Callixtus, under the Church of St. Sebastian.  In the\r\nvarious catacombs are small chapels rudely hewn in the stones, and here\r\nthe early Christians often held their religious services by dim, ghostly\r\nlights.  Think of mass and a sermon away down in those tangled caverns\r\nunder ground!\r\n\r\nIn the catacombs were buried St. Cecilia, St. Agnes, and several other of\r\nthe most celebrated of the saints.  In the catacomb of St. Callixtus, St.\r\nBridget used to remain long hours in holy contemplation, and St. Charles\r\nBorromeo was wont to spend whole nights in prayer there.  It was also the\r\nscene of a very marvelous thing.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cHere the heart of St. Philip Neri was so inflamed with divine love\r\n     as to burst his ribs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI find that grave statement in a book published in New York in 1808, and\r\nwritten by \xe2\x80\x9cRev. William H. Neligan, LL.D., M. A., Trinity College,\r\nDublin; Member of the Archaeological Society of Great Britain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Therefore, I believe it.  Otherwise, I could not.  Under other\r\ncircumstances I should have felt a curiosity to know what Philip had for\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nThis author puts my credulity on its mettle every now and then.  He tells\r\nof one St. Joseph Calasanctius whose house in Rome he visited; he visited\r\nonly the house--the priest has been dead two hundred years.  He says the\r\nVirgin Mary appeared to this saint.  Then he continues:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cHis tongue and his heart, which were found after nearly a century\r\n     to be whole, when the body was disinterred before his canonization,\r\n     are still preserved in a glass case, and after two centuries the\r\n     heart is still whole.  When the French troops came to Rome, and when\r\n     Pius VII. was carried away prisoner, blood dropped from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo read that in a book written by a monk far back in the Middle Ages,\r\nwould surprise no one; it would sound natural and proper; but when it is\r\nseriously stated in the middle of the nineteenth century, by a man of\r\nfinished education, an LL.D., M. A., and an Archaeological magnate, it\r\nsounds strangely enough.  Still, I would gladly change my unbelief for\r\nNeligan's faith, and let him make the conditions as hard as he pleased.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman's undoubting, unquestioning simplicity has a rare\r\nfreshness about it in these matter-of-fact railroading and telegraphing\r\ndays.  Hear him, concerning the church of Ara Coeli:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIn the roof of the church, directly above the high altar, is\r\n     engraved, 'Regina Coeli laetare Alleluia.'  In the sixth century\r\n     Rome was visited by a fearful pestilence.  Gregory the Great urged\r\n     the people to do penance, and a general procession was formed.  It\r\n     was to proceed from Ara Coeli to St. Peter's.  As it passed before\r\n     the mole of Adrian, now the Castle of St. Angelo, the sound of\r\n     heavenly voices was heard singing (it was Easter morn,) 'Regina\r\n     Coeli, laetare! alleluia! quia quem meruisti portare, alleluia!\r\n     resurrexit sicut dixit; alleluia!'  The Pontiff, carrying in his\r\n     hands the portrait of the Virgin, (which is over the high altar and\r\n     is said to have been painted by St. Luke,) answered, with the\r\n     astonished people, 'Ora pro nobis Deum, alleluia!'  At the same time\r\n     an angel was seen to put up a sword in a scabbard, and the\r\n     pestilence ceased on the same day.  There are four circumstances\r\n     which 'CONFIRM'--[The italics are mine--M. T.]--this miracle: the\r\n     annual procession which takes place in the western church on the\r\n     feast of St Mark; the statue of St. Michael, placed on the mole of\r\n     Adrian, which has since that time been called the Castle of St.\r\n     Angelo; the antiphon Regina Coeli which the Catholic church sings\r\n     during paschal time; and the inscription in the church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nFrom the sanguinary sports of the Holy Inquisition; the slaughter of the\r\nColiseum; and the dismal tombs of the Catacombs, I naturally pass to the\r\npicturesque horrors of the Capuchin Convent.  We stopped a moment in a\r\nsmall chapel in the church to admire a picture of St. Michael vanquishing\r\nSatan--a picture which is so beautiful that I can not but think it\r\nbelongs to the reviled \xe2\x80\x9cRenaissance,\xe2\x80\x9d notwithstanding I believe they told\r\nus one of the ancient old masters painted it--and then we descended into\r\nthe vast vault underneath.\r\n\r\nHere was a spectacle for sensitive nerves!  Evidently the old masters had\r\nbeen at work in this place.  There were six divisions in the apartment,\r\nand each division was ornamented with a style of decoration peculiar to\r\nitself--and these decorations were in every instance formed of human\r\nbones!  There were shapely arches, built wholly of thigh bones; there\r\nwere startling pyramids, built wholly of grinning skulls; there were\r\nquaint architectural structures of various kinds, built of shin bones and\r\nthe bones of the arm; on the wall were elaborate frescoes, whose curving\r\nvines were made of knotted human vertebrae; whose delicate tendrils were\r\nmade of sinews and tendons; whose flowers were formed of knee-caps and\r\ntoe-nails.  Every lasting portion of the human frame was represented in\r\nthese intricate designs (they were by Michael Angelo, I think,) and there\r\nwas a careful finish about the work, and an attention to details that\r\nbetrayed the artist's love of his labors as well as his schooled ability.\r\nI asked the good-natured monk who accompanied us, who did this?  And he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cWe did it\xe2\x80\x9d--meaning himself and his brethren up stairs.  I could\r\nsee that the old friar took a high pride in his curious show.  We made\r\nhim talkative by exhibiting an interest we never betrayed to guides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho were these people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe--up stairs--Monks of the Capuchin order--my brethren.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many departed monks were required to upholster these six parlors?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are the bones of four thousand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt took a long time to get enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany, many centuries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir different parts are well separated--skulls in one room, legs in\r\nanother, ribs in another--there would be stirring times here for a while\r\nif the last trump should blow.  Some of the brethren might get hold of\r\nthe wrong leg, in the confusion, and the wrong skull, and find themselves\r\nlimping, and looking through eyes that were wider apart or closer\r\ntogether than they were used to.  You can not tell any of these parties\r\napart, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I know many of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his finger on a skull.  \xe2\x80\x9cThis was Brother Anselmo--dead three\r\nhundred years--a good man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe touched another.  \xe2\x80\x9cThis was Brother Alexander--dead two hundred and\r\neighty years.  This was Brother Carlo--dead about as long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he took a skull and held it in his hand, and looked reflectively\r\nupon it, after the manner of the grave-digger when he discourses of\r\nYorick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwas Brother Thomas.  He was a young prince, the scion\r\nof a proud house that traced its lineage back to the grand old days of\r\nRome well nigh two thousand years ago.  He loved beneath his estate.  His\r\nfamily persecuted him; persecuted the girl, as well.  They drove her from\r\nRome; he followed; he sought her far and wide; he found no trace of her.\r\nHe came back and offered his broken heart at our altar and his weary life\r\nto the service of God.  But look you.  Shortly his father died, and\r\nlikewise his mother.  The girl returned, rejoicing.  She sought every\r\nwhere for him whose eyes had used to look tenderly into hers out of this\r\npoor skull, but she could not find him.  At last, in this coarse garb we\r\nwear, she recognized him in the street.  He knew her.  It was too late.\r\nHe fell where he stood.  They took him up and brought him here.  He never\r\nspoke afterward.  Within the week he died.  You can see the color of his\r\nhair--faded, somewhat--by this thin shred that clings still to the\r\ntemple.  This, [taking up a thigh bone,] was his.  The veins of this\r\nleaf in the decorations over your head, were his finger-joints, a hundred\r\nand fifty years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis business-like way of illustrating a touching story of the heart by\r\nlaying the several fragments of the lover before us and naming them, was\r\nas grotesque a performance, and as ghastly, as any I ever witnessed.  I\r\nhardly knew whether to smile or shudder.  There are nerves and muscles in\r\nour frames whose functions and whose methods of working it seems a sort\r\nof sacrilege to describe by cold physiological names and surgical\r\ntechnicalities, and the monk's talk suggested to me something of this\r\nkind.  Fancy a surgeon, with his nippers lifting tendons, muscles and\r\nsuch things into view, out of the complex machinery of a corpse, and\r\nobserving, \xe2\x80\x9cNow this little nerve quivers--the vibration is imparted to\r\nthis muscle--from here it is passed to this fibrous substance; here its\r\ningredients are separated by the chemical action of the blood--one part\r\ngoes to the heart and thrills it with what is popularly termed emotion,\r\nanother part follows this nerve to the brain and communicates\r\nintelligence of a startling character--the third part glides along this\r\npassage and touches the spring connected with the fluid receptacles that\r\nlie in the rear of the eye.  Thus, by this simple and beautiful process,\r\nthe party is informed that his mother is dead, and he weeps.\xe2\x80\x9d  Horrible!\r\n\r\nI asked the monk if all the brethren up stairs expected to be put in this\r\nplace when they died.  He answered quietly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must all lie here at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSee what one can accustom himself to.--The reflection that he must some\r\nday be taken apart like an engine or a clock, or like a house whose owner\r\nis gone, and worked up into arches and pyramids and hideous frescoes, did\r\nnot distress this monk in the least.  I thought he even looked as if he\r\nwere thinking, with complacent vanity, that his own skull would look well\r\non top of the heap and his own ribs add a charm to the frescoes which\r\npossibly they lacked at present.\r\n\r\nHere and there, in ornamental alcoves, stretched upon beds of bones, lay\r\ndead and dried-up monks, with lank frames dressed in the black robes one\r\nsees ordinarily upon priests.  We examined one closely.  The skinny hands\r\nwere clasped upon the breast; two lustreless tufts of hair stuck to the\r\nskull; the skin was brown and sunken; it stretched tightly over the cheek\r\nbones and made them stand out sharply; the crisp dead eyes were deep in\r\nthe sockets; the nostrils were painfully prominent, the end of the nose\r\nbeing gone; the lips had shriveled away from the yellow teeth: and\r\nbrought down to us through the circling years, and petrified there, was a\r\nweird laugh a full century old!\r\n\r\nIt was the jolliest laugh, but yet the most dreadful, that one can\r\nimagine.  Surely, I thought, it must have been a most extraordinary joke\r\nthis veteran produced with his latest breath, that he has not got done\r\nlaughing at it yet.  At this moment I saw that the old instinct was\r\nstrong upon the boys, and I said we had better hurry to St. Peter's.\r\nThey were trying to keep from asking, \xe2\x80\x9cIs--is he dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt makes me dizzy, to think of the Vatican--of its wilderness of statues,\r\npaintings, and curiosities of every description and every age.  The \xe2\x80\x9cold\r\nmasters\xe2\x80\x9d (especially in sculpture,) fairly swarm, there.  I can not write\r\nabout the Vatican.  I think I shall never remember any thing I saw there\r\ndistinctly but the mummies, and the Transfiguration, by Raphael, and some\r\nother things it is not necessary to mention now.  I shall remember the\r\nTransfiguration partly because it was placed in a room almost by itself;\r\npartly because it is acknowledged by all to be the first oil painting in\r\nthe world; and partly because it was wonderfully beautiful.  The colors\r\nare fresh and rich, the \xe2\x80\x9cexpression,\xe2\x80\x9d I am told, is fine, the \xe2\x80\x9cfeeling\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n is lively, the \xe2\x80\x9ctone\xe2\x80\x9d is good, the \xe2\x80\x9cdepth\xe2\x80\x9d is profound, and the width is\r\nabout four and a half feet, I should judge.  It is a picture that really\r\nholds one's attention; its beauty is fascinating.  It is fine enough to\r\nbe a Renaissance.  A remark I made a while ago suggests a thought--and a\r\nhope.  Is it not possible that the reason I find such charms in this\r\npicture is because it is out of the crazy chaos of the galleries?  If\r\nsome of the others were set apart, might not they be beautiful?  If this\r\nwere set in the midst of the tempest of pictures one finds in the vast\r\ngalleries of the Roman palaces, would I think it so handsome?  If, up to\r\nthis time, I had seen only one \xe2\x80\x9cold master\xe2\x80\x9d in each palace, instead of\r\nacres and acres of walls and ceilings fairly papered with them, might I\r\nnot have a more civilized opinion of the old masters than I have now?  I\r\nthink so.  When I was a school-boy and was to have a new knife, I could\r\nnot make up my mind as to which was the prettiest in the show-case, and I\r\ndid not think any of them were particularly pretty; and so I chose with a\r\nheavy heart.  But when I looked at my purchase, at home, where no\r\nglittering blades came into competition with it, I was astonished to see\r\nhow handsome it was.  To this day my new hats look better out of the shop\r\nthan they did in it with other new hats.  It begins to dawn upon me, now,\r\nthat possibly, what I have been taking for uniform ugliness in the\r\ngalleries may be uniform beauty after all.  I honestly hope it is, to\r\nothers, but certainly it is not to me.  Perhaps the reason I used to\r\nenjoy going to the Academy of Fine Arts in New York was because there\r\nwere but a few hundred paintings in it, and it did not surfeit me to go\r\nthrough the list.  I suppose the Academy was bacon and beans in the\r\nForty-Mile Desert, and a European gallery is a state dinner of thirteen\r\ncourses.  One leaves no sign after him of the one dish, but the thirteen\r\nfrighten away his appetite and give him no satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing I am certain of, though.  With all the Michael\r\nAngelos, the Raphaels, the Guidos and the other old masters, the sublime\r\nhistory of Rome remains unpainted!  They painted Virgins enough, and\r\npopes enough and saintly scarecrows enough, to people Paradise, almost,\r\nand these things are all they did paint.  \xe2\x80\x9cNero fiddling o'er burning\r\nRome,\xe2\x80\x9d the assassination of Caesar, the stirring spectacle of a hundred\r\nthousand people bending forward with rapt interest, in the coliseum, to\r\nsee two skillful gladiators hacking away each others' lives, a tiger\r\nspringing upon a kneeling martyr--these and a thousand other matters\r\nwhich we read of with a living interest, must be sought for only in\r\nbooks--not among the rubbish left by the old masters--who are no more, I\r\nhave the satisfaction of informing the public.\r\n\r\nThey did paint, and they did carve in marble, one historical scene, and\r\none only, (of any great historical consequence.) And what was it and why\r\ndid they choose it, particularly?  It was the Rape of the Sabines, and\r\nthey chose it for the legs and busts.\r\n\r\nI like to look at statues, however, and I like to look at pictures, also\r\n--even of monks looking up in sacred ecstacy, and monks looking down in\r\nmeditation, and monks skirmishing for something to eat--and therefore I\r\ndrop ill nature to thank the papal government for so jealously guarding\r\nand so industriously gathering up these things; and for permitting me, a\r\nstranger and not an entirely friendly one, to roam at will and unmolested\r\namong them, charging me nothing, and only requiring that I shall behave\r\nmyself simply as well as I ought to behave in any other man's house.  I\r\nthank the Holy Father right heartily, and I wish him long life and plenty\r\nof happiness.\r\n\r\nThe Popes have long been the patrons and preservers of art, just as our\r\nnew, practical Republic is the encourager and upholder of mechanics.  In\r\ntheir Vatican is stored up all that is curious and beautiful in art; in\r\nour Patent Office is hoarded all that is curious or useful in mechanics.\r\nWhen a man invents a new style of horse-collar or discovers a new and\r\nsuperior method of telegraphing, our government issues a patent to him\r\nthat is worth a fortune; when a man digs up an ancient statue in the\r\nCampagna, the Pope gives him a fortune in gold coin.  We can make\r\nsomething of a guess at a man's character by the style of nose he carries\r\non his face.  The Vatican and the Patent Office are governmental noses,\r\nand they bear a deal of character about them.\r\n\r\nThe guide showed us a colossal statue of Jupiter, in the Vatican, which\r\nhe said looked so damaged and rusty--so like the God of the Vagabonds\r\n--because it had but recently been dug up in the Campagna.  He asked how\r\nmuch we supposed this Jupiter was worth?  I replied, with intelligent\r\npromptness, that he was probably worth about four dollars--may be four\r\nand a half.  \xe2\x80\x9cA hundred thousand dollars!\xe2\x80\x9d  Ferguson said.  Ferguson\r\nsaid, further, that the Pope permits no ancient work of this kind to\r\nleave his dominions.  He appoints a commission to examine discoveries\r\nlike this and report upon the value; then the Pope pays the discoverer\r\none-half of that assessed value and takes the statue.  He said this\r\nJupiter was dug from a field which had just been bought for thirty-six\r\nthousand dollars, so the first crop was a good one for the new farmer.\r\nI do not know whether Ferguson always tells the truth or not, but I\r\nsuppose he does.  I know that an exorbitant export duty is exacted upon\r\nall pictures painted by the old masters, in order to discourage the sale\r\nof those in the private collections.  I am satisfied, also, that genuine\r\nold masters hardly exist at all, in America, because the cheapest and\r\nmost insignificant of them are valued at the price of a fine farm.  I\r\nproposed to buy a small trifle of a Raphael, myself, but the price of it\r\nwas eighty thousand dollars, the export duty would have made it\r\nconsiderably over a hundred, and so I studied on it awhile and concluded\r\nnot to take it.\r\n\r\nI wish here to mention an inscription I have seen, before I forget it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlory to God in the highest, peace on earth TO MEN OF GOOD WILL!\xe2\x80\x9d  It is\r\nnot good scripture, but it is sound Catholic and human nature.\r\n\r\nThis is in letters of gold around the apsis of a mosaic group at the side\r\nof the 'scala santa', church of St. John Lateran, the Mother and Mistress\r\nof all the Catholic churches of the world.  The group represents the\r\nSaviour, St. Peter, Pope Leo, St. Silvester, Constantine and Charlemagne.\r\nPeter is giving the pallium to the Pope, and a standard to Charlemagne.\r\nThe Saviour is giving the keys to St. Silvester, and a standard to\r\nConstantine.  No prayer is offered to the Saviour, who seems to be of\r\nlittle importance any where in Rome; but an inscription below says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlessed Peter, give life to Pope Leo and victory to king Charles.\xe2\x80\x9d  It\r\ndoes not say, \xe2\x80\x9cIntercede for us, through the Saviour, with the Father,\r\nfor this boon,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cBlessed Peter, give it us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn all seriousness--without meaning to be frivolous--without meaning to\r\nbe irreverent, and more than all, without meaning to be blasphemous,--I\r\nstate as my simple deduction from the things I have seen and the things I\r\nhave heard, that the Holy Personages rank thus in Rome:\r\n\r\nFirst--\xe2\x80\x9cThe Mother of God\xe2\x80\x9d--otherwise the Virgin Mary.\r\n\r\nSecond--The Deity.\r\n\r\nThird--Peter.\r\n\r\nFourth--Some twelve or fifteen canonized Popes and martyrs.\r\n\r\nFifth--Jesus Christ the Saviour--(but always as an infant in arms.)\r\n\r\nI may be wrong in this--my judgment errs often, just as is the case with\r\nother men's--but it is my judgment, be it good or bad.\r\n\r\nJust here I will mention something that seems curious to me.  There are\r\nno \xe2\x80\x9cChrist's Churches\xe2\x80\x9d in Rome, and no \xe2\x80\x9cChurches of the Holy Ghost,\xe2\x80\x9d that\r\nI can discover.  There are some four hundred churches, but about a fourth\r\nof them seem to be named for the Madonna and St. Peter.  There are so\r\nmany named for Mary that they have to be distinguished by all sorts of\r\naffixes, if I understand the matter rightly.  Then we have churches of\r\nSt. Louis; St. Augustine; St. Agnes; St. Calixtus; St. Lorenzo in Lucina;\r\nSt. Lorenzo in Damaso; St. Cecilia; St. Athanasius; St. Philip Neri; St.\r\nCatherine, St. Dominico, and a multitude of lesser saints whose names are\r\nnot familiar in the world--and away down, clear out of the list of the\r\nchurches, comes a couple of hospitals: one of them is named for the\r\nSaviour and the other for the Holy Ghost!\r\n\r\nDay after day and night after night we have wandered among the crumbling\r\nwonders of Rome; day after day and night after night we have fed upon the\r\ndust and decay of five-and-twenty centuries--have brooded over them by\r\nday and dreampt of them by night till sometimes we seemed moldering away\r\nourselves, and growing defaced and cornerless, and liable at any moment\r\nto fall a prey to some antiquary and be patched in the legs, and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crestored\xe2\x80\x9d with an unseemly nose, and labeled wrong and dated wrong, and\r\nset up in the Vatican for poets to drivel about and vandals to scribble\r\ntheir names on forever and forevermore.\r\n\r\nBut the surest way to stop writing about Rome is to stop.  I wished to\r\nwrite a real \xe2\x80\x9cguide-book\xe2\x80\x9d chapter on this fascinating city, but I could\r\nnot do it, because I have felt all the time like a boy in a candy-shop\r\n--there was every thing to choose from, and yet no choice.  I have drifted\r\nalong hopelessly for a hundred pages of manuscript without knowing where\r\nto commence.  I will not commence at all.  Our passports have been\r\nexamined.  We will go to Naples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nThe ship is lying here in the harbor of Naples--quarantined.  She has\r\nbeen here several days and will remain several more.  We that came by\r\nrail from Rome have escaped this misfortune.  Of course no one is allowed\r\nto go on board the ship, or come ashore from her.  She is a prison, now.\r\nThe passengers probably spend the long, blazing days looking out from\r\nunder the awnings at Vesuvius and the beautiful city--and in swearing.\r\nThink of ten days of this sort of pastime!--We go out every day in a boat\r\nand request them to come ashore.  It soothes them.  We lie ten steps from\r\nthe ship and tell them how splendid the city is; and how much better the\r\nhotel fare is here than any where else in Europe; and how cool it is; and\r\nwhat frozen continents of ice cream there are; and what a time we are\r\nhaving cavorting about the country and sailing to the islands in the Bay.\r\nThis tranquilizes them.\r\n\r\n                           ASCENT OF VESUVIUS.\r\n\r\nI shall remember our trip to Vesuvius for many a day--partly because of\r\nits sight-seeing experiences, but chiefly on account of the fatigue of\r\nthe journey.  Two or three of us had been resting ourselves among the\r\ntranquil and beautiful scenery of the island of Ischia, eighteen miles\r\nout in the harbor, for two days; we called it \xe2\x80\x9cresting,\xe2\x80\x9d but I do not\r\nremember now what the resting consisted of, for when we got back to\r\nNaples we had not slept for forty-eight hours.  We were just about to go\r\nto bed early in the evening, and catch up on some of the sleep we had\r\nlost, when we heard of this Vesuvius expedition.  There was to be eight\r\nof us in the party, and we were to leave Naples at midnight.  We laid in\r\nsome provisions for the trip, engaged carriages to take us to\r\nAnnunciation, and then moved about the city, to keep awake, till twelve.\r\nWe got away punctually, and in the course of an hour and a half arrived\r\nat the town of Annunciation.  Annunciation is the very last place under\r\nthe sun.  In other towns in Italy the people lie around quietly and wait\r\nfor you to ask them a question or do some overt act that can be charged\r\nfor--but in Annunciation they have lost even that fragment of delicacy;\r\nthey seize a lady's shawl from a chair and hand it to her and charge a\r\npenny; they open a carriage door, and charge for it--shut it when you get\r\nout, and charge for it; they help you to take off a duster--two cents;\r\nbrush your clothes and make them worse than they were before--two cents;\r\nsmile upon you--two cents; bow, with a lick-spittle smirk, hat in hand\r\n--two cents; they volunteer all information, such as that the mules will\r\narrive presently--two cents--warm day, sir--two cents--take you four\r\nhours to make the ascent--two cents.  And so they go.  They crowd you\r\n--infest you--swarm about you, and sweat and smell offensively, and look\r\nsneaking and mean, and obsequious.  There is no office too degrading for\r\nthem to perform, for money.  I have had no opportunity to find out any\r\nthing about the upper classes by my own observation, but from what I hear\r\nsaid about them I judge that what they lack in one or two of the bad\r\ntraits the canaille have, they make up in one or two others that are\r\nworse.  How the people beg!--many of them very well dressed, too.\r\n\r\nI said I knew nothing against the upper classes by personal observation.\r\nI must recall it!  I had forgotten.  What I saw their bravest and their\r\nfairest do last night, the lowest multitude that could be scraped up out\r\nof the purlieus of Christendom would blush to do, I think.  They\r\nassembled by hundreds, and even thousands, in the great Theatre of San\r\nCarlo, to do--what?  Why, simply, to make fun of an old woman--to deride,\r\nto hiss, to jeer at an actress they once worshipped, but whose beauty is\r\nfaded now and whose voice has lost its former richness.  Every body spoke\r\nof the rare sport there was to be.  They said the theatre would be\r\ncrammed, because Frezzolini was going to sing.  It was said she could not\r\nsing well, now, but then the people liked to see her, anyhow.  And so we\r\nwent.  And every time the woman sang they hissed and laughed--the whole\r\nmagnificent house--and as soon as she left the stage they called her on\r\nagain with applause.  Once or twice she was encored five and six times in\r\nsuccession, and received with hisses when she appeared, and discharged\r\nwith hisses and laughter when she had finished--then instantly encored\r\nand insulted again!  And how the high-born knaves enjoyed it!\r\nWhite-kidded gentlemen and ladies laughed till the tears came, and\r\nclapped their hands in very ecstacy when that unhappy old woman would\r\ncome meekly out for the sixth time, with uncomplaining patience, to meet\r\na storm of hisses!  It was the cruelest exhibition--the most wanton, the\r\nmost unfeeling.  The singer would have conquered an audience of American\r\nrowdies by her brave, unflinching tranquillity (for she answered encore\r\nafter encore, and smiled and bowed pleasantly, and sang the best she\r\npossibly could, and went bowing off, through all the jeers and hisses,\r\nwithout ever losing countenance or temper:) and surely in any other land\r\nthan Italy her sex and her helplessness must have been an ample\r\nprotection to her--she could have needed no other.  Think what a\r\nmultitude of small souls were crowded into that theatre last night.  If\r\nthe manager could have filled his theatre with Neapolitan souls alone,\r\nwithout the bodies, he could not have cleared less than ninety millions\r\nof dollars.  What traits of character must a man have to enable him to\r\nhelp three thousand miscreants to hiss, and jeer, and laugh at one\r\nfriendless old woman, and shamefully humiliate her?  He must have all\r\nthe vile, mean traits there are.  My observation persuades me (I do not\r\nlike to venture beyond my own personal observation,) that the upper\r\nclasses of Naples possess those traits of character.  Otherwise they may\r\nbe very good people; I can not say.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.\r\n\r\nIn this city of Naples, they believe in and support one of the\r\nwretchedest of all the religious impostures one can find in Italy--the\r\nmiraculous liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius.  Twice a year the\r\npriests assemble all the people at the Cathedral, and get out this vial\r\nof clotted blood and let them see it slowly dissolve and become liquid\r\n--and every day for eight days, this dismal farce is repeated, while the\r\npriests go among the crowd and collect money for the exhibition.  The\r\nfirst day, the blood liquefies in forty-seven minutes--the church is\r\ncrammed, then, and time must be allowed the collectors to get around:\r\nafter that it liquefies a little quicker and a little quicker, every day,\r\nas the houses grow smaller, till on the eighth day, with only a few\r\ndozens present to see the miracle, it liquefies in four minutes.\r\n\r\nAnd here, also, they used to have a grand procession, of priests,\r\ncitizens, soldiers, sailors, and the high dignitaries of the City\r\nGovernment, once a year, to shave the head of a made-up Madonna--a\r\nstuffed and painted image, like a milliner's dummy--whose hair\r\nmiraculously grew and restored itself every twelve months.  They still\r\nkept up this shaving procession as late as four or five years ago.  It\r\nwas a source of great profit to the church that possessed the remarkable\r\neffigy, and the ceremony of the public barbering of her was always\r\ncarried out with the greatest possible eclat and display--the more the\r\nbetter, because the more excitement there was about it the larger the\r\ncrowds it drew and the heavier the revenues it produced--but at last a\r\nday came when the Pope and his servants were unpopular in Naples, and the\r\nCity Government stopped the Madonna's annual show.\r\n\r\nThere we have two specimens of these Neapolitans--two of the silliest\r\npossible frauds, which half the population religiously and faithfully\r\nbelieved, and the other half either believed also or else said nothing\r\nabout, and thus lent themselves to the support of the imposture.  I am\r\nvery well satisfied to think the whole population believed in those poor,\r\ncheap miracles--a people who want two cents every time they bow to you,\r\nand who abuse a woman, are capable of it, I think.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.\r\n\r\nThese Neapolitans always ask four times as much money as they intend to\r\ntake, but if you give them what they first demand, they feel ashamed of\r\nthemselves for aiming so low, and immediately ask more.  When money is to\r\nbe paid and received, there is always some vehement jawing and\r\ngesticulating about it.  One can not buy and pay for two cents' worth of\r\nclams without trouble and a quarrel.  One \xe2\x80\x9ccourse,\xe2\x80\x9d in a two-horse\r\ncarriage, costs a franc--that is law--but the hackman always demands\r\nmore, on some pretence or other, and if he gets it he makes a new demand.\r\nIt is said that a stranger took a one-horse carriage for a course\r\n--tariff, half a franc.  He gave the man five francs, by way of experiment.\r\nHe demanded more, and received another franc.  Again he demanded more,\r\nand got a franc--demanded more, and it was refused.  He grew vehement\r\n--was again refused, and became noisy.  The stranger said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, give me\r\nthe seven francs again, and I will see what I can do\xe2\x80\x9d--and when he got\r\nthem, he handed the hackman half a franc, and he immediately asked for\r\ntwo cents to buy a drink with.  It may be thought that I am prejudiced.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am.  I would be ashamed of myself if I were not.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.\r\n\r\nWell, as I was saying, we got our mules and horses, after an hour and a\r\nhalf of bargaining with the population of Annunciation, and started\r\nsleepily up the mountain, with a vagrant at each mule's tail who\r\npretended to be driving the brute along, but was really holding on and\r\ngetting himself dragged up instead.  I made slow headway at first, but I\r\nbegan to get dissatisfied at the idea of paying my minion five francs to\r\nhold my mule back by the tail and keep him from going up the hill, and so\r\nI discharged him.  I got along faster then.\r\n\r\nWe had one magnificent picture of Naples from a high point on the\r\nmountain side.  We saw nothing but the gas lamps, of course--two-thirds\r\nof a circle, skirting the great Bay--a necklace of diamonds glinting up\r\nthrough the darkness from the remote distance--less brilliant than the\r\nstars overhead, but more softly, richly beautiful--and over all the great\r\ncity the lights crossed and recrossed each other in many and many a\r\nsparkling line and curve.  And back of the town, far around and abroad\r\nover the miles of level campagna, were scattered rows, and circles, and\r\nclusters of lights, all glowing like so many gems, and marking where a\r\nscore of villages were sleeping.  About this time, the fellow who was\r\nhanging on to the tail of the horse in front of me and practicing all\r\nsorts of unnecessary cruelty upon the animal, got kicked some fourteen\r\nrods, and this incident, together with the fairy spectacle of the lights\r\nfar in the distance, made me serenely happy, and I was glad I started to\r\nVesuvius.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ASCENT OF MOUNT VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.\r\n\r\nThis subject will be excellent matter for a chapter, and tomorrow or next\r\nday I will write it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n                     ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee Naples and die.\xe2\x80\x9d  Well, I do not know that one would necessarily die\r\nafter merely seeing it, but to attempt to live there might turn out a\r\nlittle differently.  To see Naples as we saw it in the early dawn from\r\nfar up on the side of Vesuvius, is to see a picture of wonderful beauty.\r\nAt that distance its dingy buildings looked white--and so, rank on rank\r\nof balconies, windows and roofs, they piled themselves up from the blue\r\nocean till the colossal castle of St. Elmo topped the grand white pyramid\r\nand gave the picture symmetry, emphasis and completeness.  And when its\r\nlilies turned to roses--when it blushed under the sun's first kiss--it\r\nwas beautiful beyond all description.  One might well say, then, \xe2\x80\x9cSee\r\nNaples and die.\xe2\x80\x9d  The frame of the picture was charming, itself.  In\r\nfront, the smooth sea--a vast mosaic of many colors; the lofty islands\r\nswimming in a dreamy haze in the distance; at our end of the city the\r\nstately double peak of Vesuvius, and its strong black ribs and seams of\r\nlava stretching down to the limitless level campagna--a green carpet that\r\nenchants the eye and leads it on and on, past clusters of trees, and\r\nisolated houses, and snowy villages, until it shreds out in a fringe of\r\nmist and general vagueness far away.  It is from the Hermitage, there on\r\nthe side of Vesuvius, that one should \xe2\x80\x9csee Naples and die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut do not go within the walls and look at it in detail.  That takes away\r\nsome of the romance of the thing.  The people are filthy in their habits,\r\nand this makes filthy streets and breeds disagreeable sights and smells.\r\nThere never was a community so prejudiced against the cholera as these\r\nNeapolitans are.  But they have good reason to be.  The cholera generally\r\nvanquishes a Neapolitan when it seizes him, because, you understand,\r\nbefore the doctor can dig through the dirt and get at the disease the man\r\ndies.  The upper classes take a sea-bath every day, and are pretty\r\ndecent.\r\n\r\nThe streets are generally about wide enough for one wagon, and how they\r\ndo swarm with people!  It is Broadway repeated in every street, in every\r\ncourt, in every alley!  Such masses, such throngs, such multitudes of\r\nhurrying, bustling, struggling humanity!  We never saw the like of it,\r\nhardly even in New York, I think.  There are seldom any sidewalks, and\r\nwhen there are, they are not often wide enough to pass a man on without\r\ncaroming on him.  So everybody walks in the street--and where the street\r\nis wide enough, carriages are forever dashing along.  Why a thousand\r\npeople are not run over and crippled every day is a mystery that no man\r\ncan solve.  But if there is an eighth wonder in the world, it must be the\r\ndwelling-houses of Naples.  I honestly believe a good majority of them\r\nare a hundred feet high!  And the solid brick walls are seven feet\r\nthrough.  You go up nine flights of stairs before you get to the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n floor.  No, not nine, but there or thereabouts.  There is a little\r\nbird-cage of an iron railing in front of every window clear away up, up,\r\nup, among the eternal clouds, where the roof is, and there is always\r\nsomebody looking out of every window--people of ordinary size looking\r\nout from the first floor, people a shade smaller from the second, people\r\nthat look a little smaller yet from the third--and from thence upward\r\nthey grow smaller and smaller by a regularly graduated diminution, till\r\nthe folks in the topmost windows seem more like birds in an uncommonly\r\ntall martin-box than any thing else.  The perspective of one of these\r\nnarrow cracks of streets, with its rows of tall houses stretching away\r\ntill they come together in the distance like railway tracks; its\r\nclothes-lines crossing over at all altitudes and waving their bannered\r\nraggedness over the swarms of people below; and the white-dressed women\r\nperched in balcony railings all the way from the pavement up to the\r\nheavens--a perspective like that is really worth going into Neapolitan\r\ndetails to see.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.\r\n\r\nNaples, with its immediate suburbs, contains six hundred and twenty-five\r\nthousand inhabitants, but I am satisfied it covers no more ground than an\r\nAmerican city of one hundred and fifty thousand.  It reaches up into the\r\nair infinitely higher than three American cities, though, and there is\r\nwhere the secret of it lies.  I will observe here, in passing, that the\r\ncontrasts between opulence and poverty, and magnificence and misery, are\r\nmore frequent and more striking in Naples than in Paris even.  One must\r\ngo to the Bois de Boulogne to see fashionable dressing, splendid\r\nequipages and stunning liveries, and to the Faubourg St. Antoine to see\r\nvice, misery, hunger, rags, dirt--but in the thoroughfares of Naples\r\nthese things are all mixed together.  Naked boys of nine years and the\r\nfancy-dressed children of luxury; shreds and tatters, and brilliant\r\nuniforms; jackass-carts and state-carriages; beggars, Princes and\r\nBishops, jostle each other in every street.  At six o'clock every\r\nevening, all Naples turns out to drive on the 'Riviere di Chiaja',\r\n(whatever that may mean;) and for two hours one may stand there and see\r\nthe motliest and the worst mixed procession go by that ever eyes beheld.\r\nPrinces (there are more Princes than policemen in Naples--the city is\r\ninfested with them)--Princes who live up seven flights of stairs and\r\ndon't own any principalities, will keep a carriage and go hungry; and\r\nclerks, mechanics, milliners and strumpets will go without their dinners\r\nand squander the money on a hack-ride in the Chiaja; the rag-tag and\r\nrubbish of the city stack themselves up, to the number of twenty or\r\nthirty, on a rickety little go-cart hauled by a donkey not much bigger\r\nthan a cat, and they drive in the Chiaja; Dukes and bankers, in sumptuous\r\ncarriages and with gorgeous drivers and footmen, turn out, also, and so\r\nthe furious procession goes.  For two hours rank and wealth, and\r\nobscurity and poverty clatter along side by side in the wild procession,\r\nand then go home serene, happy, covered with glory!\r\n\r\nI was looking at a magnificent marble staircase in the King's palace, the\r\nother day, which, it was said, cost five million francs, and I suppose it\r\ndid cost half a million, may be.  I felt as if it must be a fine thing to\r\nlive in a country where there was such comfort and such luxury as this.\r\nAnd then I stepped out musing, and almost walked over a vagabond who was\r\neating his dinner on the curbstone--a piece of bread and a bunch of\r\ngrapes.  When I found that this mustang was clerking in a fruit\r\nestablishment (he had the establishment along with him in a basket,) at\r\ntwo cents a day, and that he had no palace at home where he lived, I lost\r\nsome of my enthusiasm concerning the happiness of living in Italy.\r\n\r\nThis naturally suggests to me a thought about wages here.  Lieutenants in\r\nthe army get about a dollar a day, and common soldiers a couple of cents.\r\nI only know one clerk--he gets four dollars a month.  Printers get six\r\ndollars and a half a month, but I have heard of a foreman who gets\r\nthirteen.\r\n\r\nTo be growing suddenly and violently rich, as this man is, naturally\r\nmakes him a bloated aristocrat.  The airs he puts on are insufferable.\r\n\r\nAnd, speaking of wages, reminds me of prices of merchandise.  In Paris\r\nyou pay twelve dollars a dozen for Jouvin's best kid gloves; gloves of\r\nabout as good quality sell here at three or four dollars a dozen.  You\r\npay five and six dollars apiece for fine linen shirts in Paris; here and\r\nin Leghorn you pay two and a half.  In Marseilles you pay forty dollars\r\nfor a first-class dress coat made by a good tailor, but in Leghorn you\r\ncan get a full dress suit for the same money.  Here you get handsome\r\nbusiness suits at from ten to twenty dollars, and in Leghorn you can get\r\nan overcoat for fifteen dollars that would cost you seventy in New York.\r\nFine kid boots are worth eight dollars in Marseilles and four dollars\r\nhere.  Lyons velvets rank higher in America than those of Genoa.  Yet the\r\nbulk of Lyons velvets you buy in the States are made in Genoa and\r\nimported into Lyons, where they receive the Lyons stamp and are then\r\nexported to America.  You can buy enough velvet in Genoa for twenty-five\r\ndollars to make a five hundred dollar cloak in New York--so the ladies\r\ntell me.  Of course these things bring me back, by a natural and easy\r\ntransition, to the\r\n\r\n                     ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the wonderful Blue Grotto is suggested to me.  It is situated on\r\nthe Island of Capri, twenty-two miles from Naples.  We chartered a little\r\nsteamer and went out there.  Of course, the police boarded us and put us\r\nthrough a health examination, and inquired into our politics, before they\r\nwould let us land.  The airs these little insect Governments put on are\r\nin the last degree ridiculous.  They even put a policeman on board of our\r\nboat to keep an eye on us as long as we were in the Capri dominions.\r\nThey thought we wanted to steal the grotto, I suppose.  It was worth\r\nstealing.  The entrance to the cave is four feet high and four feet wide,\r\nand is in the face of a lofty perpendicular cliff--the sea-wall.  You\r\nenter in small boats--and a tight squeeze it is, too.  You can not go in\r\nat all when the tide is up.  Once within, you find yourself in an arched\r\ncavern about one hundred and sixty feet long, one hundred and twenty\r\nwide, and about seventy high.  How deep it is no man knows.  It goes down\r\nto the bottom of the ocean.  The waters of this placid subterranean lake\r\nare the brightest, loveliest blue that can be imagined.  They are as\r\ntransparent as plate glass, and their coloring would shame the richest\r\nsky that ever bent over Italy.  No tint could be more ravishing, no\r\nlustre more superb.  Throw a stone into the water, and the myriad of tiny\r\nbubbles that are created flash out a brilliant glare like blue theatrical\r\nfires.  Dip an oar, and its blade turns to splendid frosted silver,\r\ntinted with blue.  Let a man jump in, and instantly he is cased in an\r\narmor more gorgeous than ever kingly Crusader wore.\r\n\r\nThen we went to Ischia, but I had already been to that island and tired\r\nmyself to death \xe2\x80\x9cresting\xe2\x80\x9d a couple of days and studying human villainy,\r\nwith the landlord of the Grande Sentinelle for a model.  So we went to\r\nProcida, and from thence to Pozzuoli, where St. Paul landed after he\r\nsailed from Samos.  I landed at precisely the same spot where St. Paul\r\nlanded, and so did Dan and the others.  It was a remarkable coincidence.\r\nSt. Paul preached to these people seven days before he started to Rome.\r\n\r\nNero's Baths, the ruins of Baiae, the Temple of Serapis; Cumae, where the\r\nCumaen Sybil interpreted the oracles, the Lake Agnano, with its ancient\r\nsubmerged city still visible far down in its depths--these and a hundred\r\nother points of interest we examined with critical imbecility, but the\r\nGrotto of the Dog claimed our chief attention, because we had heard and\r\nread so much about it.  Every body has written about the Grotto del Cane\r\nand its poisonous vapors, from Pliny down to Smith, and every tourist has\r\nheld a dog over its floor by the legs to test the capabilities of the\r\nplace.  The dog dies in a minute and a half--a chicken instantly.  As a\r\ngeneral thing, strangers who crawl in there to sleep do not get up until\r\nthey are called.  And then they don't either.  The stranger that ventures\r\nto sleep there takes a permanent contract.  I longed to see this grotto.\r\nI resolved to take a dog and hold him myself; suffocate him a little, and\r\ntime him; suffocate him some more and then finish him.  We reached the\r\ngrotto at about three in the afternoon, and proceeded at once to make the\r\nexperiments.  But now, an important difficulty presented itself.  We had\r\nno dog.\r\n\r\n                     ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.\r\n\r\nAt the Hermitage we were about fifteen or eighteen hundred feet above the\r\nsea, and thus far a portion of the ascent had been pretty abrupt.  For\r\nthe next two miles the road was a mixture--sometimes the ascent was\r\nabrupt and sometimes it was not: but one characteristic it possessed all\r\nthe time, without failure--without modification--it was all\r\nuncompromisingly and unspeakably infamous.  It was a rough, narrow trail,\r\nand led over an old lava flow--a black ocean which was tumbled into a\r\nthousand fantastic shapes--a wild chaos of ruin, desolation, and\r\nbarrenness--a wilderness of billowy upheavals, of furious whirlpools, of\r\nminiature mountains rent asunder--of gnarled and knotted, wrinkled and\r\ntwisted masses of blackness that mimicked branching roots, great vines,\r\ntrunks of trees, all interlaced and mingled together: and all these weird\r\nshapes, all this turbulent panorama, all this stormy, far-stretching\r\nwaste of blackness, with its thrilling suggestiveness of life, of action,\r\nof boiling, surging, furious motion, was petrified!--all stricken dead\r\nand cold in the instant of its maddest rioting!--fettered, paralyzed, and\r\nleft to glower at heaven in impotent rage for evermore!\r\n\r\nFinally we stood in a level, narrow valley (a valley that had been\r\ncreated by the terrific march of some old time irruption) and on either\r\nhand towered the two steep peaks of Vesuvius.  The one we had to climb\r\n--the one that contains the active volcano--seemed about eight hundred or\r\none thousand feet high, and looked almost too straight-up-and-down for\r\nany man to climb, and certainly no mule could climb it with a man on his\r\nback.  Four of these native pirates will carry you to the top in a sedan\r\nchair, if you wish it, but suppose they were to slip and let you fall,\r\n--is it likely that you would ever stop rolling?  Not this side of\r\neternity, perhaps.  We left the mules, sharpened our finger-nails, and\r\nbegan the ascent I have been writing about so long, at twenty minutes to\r\nsix in the morning.  The path led straight up a rugged sweep of loose\r\nchunks of pumice-stone, and for about every two steps forward we took, we\r\nslid back one.  It was so excessively steep that we had to stop, every\r\nfifty or sixty steps, and rest a moment.  To see our comrades, we had to\r\nlook very nearly straight up at those above us, and very nearly straight\r\ndown at those below.  We stood on the summit at last--it had taken an\r\nhour and fifteen minutes to make the trip.\r\n\r\nWhat we saw there was simply a circular crater--a circular ditch, if you\r\nplease--about two hundred feet deep, and four or five hundred feet wide,\r\nwhose inner wall was about half a mile in circumference.  In the centre\r\nof the great circus ring thus formed, was a torn and ragged upheaval a\r\nhundred feet high, all snowed over with a sulphur crust of many and many\r\na brilliant and beautiful color, and the ditch inclosed this like the\r\nmoat of a castle, or surrounded it as a little river does a little\r\nisland, if the simile is better.  The sulphur coating of that island was\r\ngaudy in the extreme--all mingled together in the richest confusion were\r\nred, blue, brown, black, yellow, white--I do not know that there was a\r\ncolor, or shade of a color, or combination of colors, unrepresented--and\r\nwhen the sun burst through the morning mists and fired this tinted\r\nmagnificence, it topped imperial Vesuvius like a jeweled crown!\r\n\r\nThe crater itself--the ditch--was not so variegated in coloring, but yet,\r\nin its softness, richness, and unpretentious elegance, it was more\r\ncharming, more fascinating to the eye.  There was nothing \xe2\x80\x9cloud\xe2\x80\x9d about\r\nits well-bred and well-creased look.  Beautiful?  One could stand and\r\nlook down upon it for a week without getting tired of it.  It had the\r\nsemblance of a pleasant meadow, whose slender grasses and whose velvety\r\nmosses were frosted with a shining dust, and tinted with palest green\r\nthat deepened gradually to the darkest hue of the orange leaf, and\r\ndeepened yet again into gravest brown, then faded into orange, then into\r\nbrightest gold, and culminated in the delicate pink of a new-blown rose.\r\nWhere portions of the meadow had sunk, and where other portions had been\r\nbroken up like an ice-floe, the cavernous openings of the one, and the\r\nragged upturned edges exposed by the other, were hung with a lace-work of\r\nsoft-tinted crystals of sulphur that changed their deformities into\r\nquaint shapes and figures that were full of grace and beauty.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the ditch were brilliant with yellow banks of sulphur and\r\nwith lava and pumice-stone of many colors.  No fire was visible any\r\nwhere, but gusts of sulphurous steam issued silently and invisibly from a\r\nthousand little cracks and fissures in the crater, and were wafted to our\r\nnoses with every breeze.  But so long as we kept our nostrils buried in\r\nour handkerchiefs, there was small danger of suffocation.\r\n\r\nSome of the boys thrust long slips of paper down into holes and set them\r\non fire, and so achieved the glory of lighting their cigars by the flames\r\nof Vesuvius, and others cooked eggs over fissures in the rocks and were\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nThe view from the summit would have been superb but for the fact that the\r\nsun could only pierce the mists at long intervals.  Thus the glimpses we\r\nhad of the grand panorama below were only fitful and unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n                               THE DESCENT.\r\n\r\nThe descent of the mountain was a labor of only four minutes.  Instead of\r\nstalking down the rugged path we ascended, we chose one which was bedded\r\nknee-deep in loose ashes, and ploughed our way with prodigious strides\r\nthat would almost have shamed the performance of him of the seven-league\r\nboots.\r\n\r\nThe Vesuvius of today is a very poor affair compared to the mighty\r\nvolcano of Kilauea, in the Sandwich Islands, but I am glad I visited it.\r\nIt was well worth it.\r\n\r\nIt is said that during one of the grand eruptions of Vesuvius it\r\ndischarged massy rocks weighing many tons a thousand feet into the air,\r\nits vast jets of smoke and steam ascended thirty miles toward the\r\nfirmament, and clouds of its ashes were wafted abroad and fell upon the\r\ndecks of ships seven hundred and fifty miles at sea!  I will take the\r\nashes at a moderate discount, if any one will take the thirty miles of\r\nsmoke, but I do not feel able to take a commanding interest in the whole\r\nstory by myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n                        THE BURIED CITY OF POMPEII\r\n\r\nThey pronounce it Pom-pay-e.  I always had an idea that you went down\r\ninto Pompeii with torches, by the way of damp, dark stairways, just as\r\nyou do in silver mines, and traversed gloomy tunnels with lava overhead\r\nand something on either hand like dilapidated prisons gouged out of the\r\nsolid earth, that faintly resembled houses.  But you do nothing the kind.\r\nFully one-half of the buried city, perhaps, is completely exhumed and\r\nthrown open freely to the light of day; and there stand the long rows of\r\nsolidly-built brick houses (roofless) just as they stood eighteen hundred\r\nyears ago, hot with the flaming sun; and there lie their floors,\r\nclean-swept, and not a bright fragment tarnished or waiting of the\r\nlabored mosaics that pictured them with the beasts, and birds, and\r\nflowers which we copy in perishable carpets to-day; and here are the\r\nVenuses, and Bacchuses, and Adonises, making love and getting drunk in\r\nmany-hued frescoes on the walls of saloon and bed-chamber; and there are\r\nthe narrow streets and narrower sidewalks, paved with flags of good hard\r\nlava, the one deeply rutted with the chariot-wheels, and the other with\r\nthe passing feet of the Pompeiians of by-gone centuries; and there are\r\nthe bake-shops, the temples, the halls of justice, the baths, the\r\ntheatres--all clean-scraped and neat, and suggesting nothing of the\r\nnature of a silver mine away down in the bowels of the earth.  The\r\nbroken pillars lying about, the doorless doorways and the crumbled tops\r\nof the wilderness of walls, were wonderfully suggestive of the \xe2\x80\x9cburnt\r\ndistrict\xe2\x80\x9d in one of our cities, and if there had been any charred\r\ntimbers, shattered windows, heaps of debris, and general blackness and\r\nsmokiness about the place, the resemblance would have been perfect.  But\r\nno--the sun shines as brightly down on old Pompeii to-day as it did when\r\nChrist was born in Bethlehem, and its streets are cleaner a hundred\r\ntimes than ever Pompeiian saw them in her prime.  I know whereof I\r\nspeak--for in the great, chief thoroughfares (Merchant street and the\r\nStreet of Fortune) have I not seen with my own eyes how for two hundred\r\nyears at least the pavements were not repaired!--how ruts five and even\r\nten inches deep were worn into the thick flagstones by the\r\nchariot-wheels of generations of swindled tax-payers?  And do I not know\r\nby these signs that Street Commissioners of Pompeii never attended to\r\ntheir business, and that if they never mended the pavements they never\r\ncleaned them?  And, besides, is it not the inborn nature of Street\r\nCommissioners to avoid their duty whenever they get a chance?  I wish I\r\nknew the name of the last one that held office in Pompeii so that I\r\ncould give him a blast.  I speak with feeling on this subject, because I\r\ncaught my foot in one of those ruts, and the sadness that came over me\r\nwhen I saw the first poor skeleton, with ashes and lava sticking to it,\r\nwas tempered by the reflection that may be that party was the Street\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\nNo--Pompeii is no longer a buried city.  It is a city of hundreds and\r\nhundreds of roofless houses, and a tangled maze of streets where one\r\ncould easily get lost, without a guide, and have to sleep in some ghostly\r\npalace that had known no living tenant since that awful November night of\r\neighteen centuries ago.\r\n\r\nWe passed through the gate which faces the Mediterranean, (called the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarine Gate,\xe2\x80\x9d) and by the rusty, broken image of Minerva, still keeping\r\ntireless watch and ward over the possessions it was powerless to save,\r\nand went up a long street and stood in the broad court of the Forum of\r\nJustice.  The floor was level and clean, and up and down either side was\r\na noble colonnade of broken pillars, with their beautiful Ionic and\r\nCorinthian columns scattered about them.  At the upper end were the\r\nvacant seats of the Judges, and behind them we descended into a dungeon\r\nwhere the ashes and cinders had found two prisoners chained on that\r\nmemorable November night, and tortured them to death.  How they must have\r\ntugged at the pitiless fetters as the fierce fires surged around them!\r\n\r\nThen we lounged through many and many a sumptuous private mansion which\r\nwe could not have entered without a formal invitation in incomprehensible\r\nLatin, in the olden time, when the owners lived there--and we probably\r\nwouldn't have got it.  These people built their houses a good deal alike.\r\nThe floors were laid in fanciful figures wrought in mosaics of\r\nmany-colored marbles.  At the threshold your eyes fall upon a Latin\r\nsentence of welcome, sometimes, or a picture of a dog, with the legend\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeware of the Dog,\xe2\x80\x9d and sometimes a picture of a bear or a faun with no\r\ninscription at all.  Then you enter a sort of vestibule, where they used\r\nto keep the hat-rack, I suppose; next a room with a large marble basin\r\nin the midst and the pipes of a fountain; on either side are bedrooms;\r\nbeyond the fountain is a reception-room, then a little garden,\r\ndining-room, and so forth and so on.  The floors were all mosaic, the\r\nwalls were stuccoed, or frescoed, or ornamented with bas-reliefs, and\r\nhere and there were statues, large and small, and little fish-pools, and\r\ncascades of sparkling water that sprang from secret places in the\r\ncolonnade of handsome pillars that surrounded the court, and kept the\r\nflower-beds fresh and the air cool.  Those Pompeiians were very\r\nluxurious in their tastes and habits.  The most exquisite bronzes we\r\nhave seen in Europe, came from the exhumed cities of Herculaneum and\r\nPompeii, and also the finest cameos and the most delicate engravings on\r\nprecious stones; their pictures, eighteen or nineteen centuries old, are\r\noften much more pleasing than the celebrated rubbish of the old masters\r\nof three centuries ago.  They were well up in art.  From the creation of\r\nthese works of the first, clear up to the eleventh century, art seems\r\nhardly to have existed at all--at least no remnants of it are left--and\r\nit was curious to see how far (in some things, at any rate,) these old\r\ntime pagans excelled the remote generations of masters that came after\r\nthem. The pride of the world in sculptures seem to be the Laocoon and\r\nthe Dying Gladiator, in Rome.  They are as old as Pompeii, were dug from\r\nthe earth like Pompeii; but their exact age or who made them can only be\r\nconjectured.  But worn, and cracked, without a history, and with the\r\nblemishing stains of numberless centuries upon them, they still mutely\r\nmock at all efforts to rival their perfections.\r\n\r\nIt was a quaint and curious pastime, wandering through this old silent\r\ncity of the dead--lounging through utterly deserted streets where\r\nthousands and thousands of human beings once bought and sold, and walked\r\nand rode, and made the place resound with the noise and confusion of\r\ntraffic and pleasure.  They were not lazy.  They hurried in those days.\r\nWe had evidence of that.  There was a temple on one corner, and it was a\r\nshorter cut to go between the columns of that temple from one street to\r\nthe other than to go around--and behold that pathway had been worn deep\r\ninto the heavy flagstone floor of the building by generations of\r\ntime-saving feet!  They would not go around when it was quicker to go\r\nthrough.  We do that way in our cities.\r\n\r\nEvery where, you see things that make you wonder how old these old houses\r\nwere before the night of destruction came--things, too, which bring back\r\nthose long dead inhabitants and place the living before your eyes.  For\r\ninstance: The steps (two feet thick--lava blocks) that lead up out of the\r\nschool, and the same kind of steps that lead up into the dress circle of\r\nthe principal theatre, are almost worn through!  For ages the boys\r\nhurried out of that school, and for ages their parents hurried into that\r\ntheatre, and the nervous feet that have been dust and ashes for eighteen\r\ncenturies have left their record for us to read to-day.  I imagined I\r\ncould see crowds of gentlemen and ladies thronging into the theatre, with\r\ntickets for secured seats in their hands, and on the wall, I read the\r\nimaginary placard, in infamous grammar, \xe2\x80\x9cPOSITIVELY NO FREE LIST, EXCEPT\r\nMEMBERS OF THE PRESS!\xe2\x80\x9d  Hanging about the doorway (I fancied,) were\r\nslouchy Pompeiian street-boys uttering slang and profanity, and keeping a\r\nwary eye out for checks.  I entered the theatre, and sat down in one of\r\nthe long rows of stone benches in the dress circle, and looked at the\r\nplace for the orchestra, and the ruined stage, and around at the wide\r\nsweep of empty boxes, and thought to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cThis house won't pay.\xe2\x80\x9d  I\r\ntried to imagine the music in full blast, the leader of the orchestra\r\nbeating time, and the \xe2\x80\x9cversatile\xe2\x80\x9d So-and-So (who had \xe2\x80\x9cjust returned from\r\na most successful tour in the provinces to play his last and farewell\r\nengagement of positively six nights only, in Pompeii, previous to his\r\ndeparture for Herculaneum,\xe2\x80\x9d) charging around the stage and piling the\r\nagony mountains high--but I could not do it with such a \xe2\x80\x9chouse\xe2\x80\x9d as that;\r\nthose empty benches tied my fancy down to dull reality.  I said, these\r\npeople that ought to be here have been dead, and still, and moldering to\r\ndust for ages and ages, and will never care for the trifles and follies\r\nof life any more for ever--\xe2\x80\x9cOwing to circumstances, etc., etc., there\r\nwill not be any performance to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d  Close down the curtain.  Put out\r\nthe lights.\r\n\r\nAnd so I turned away and went through shop after shop and store after\r\nstore, far down the long street of the merchants, and called for the\r\nwares of Rome and the East, but the tradesmen were gone, the marts were\r\nsilent, and nothing was left but the broken jars all set in cement of\r\ncinders and ashes: the wine and the oil that once had filled them were\r\ngone with their owners.\r\n\r\nIn a bake-shop was a mill for grinding the grain, and the furnaces for\r\nbaking the bread: and they say that here, in the same furnaces, the\r\nexhumers of Pompeii found nice, well baked loaves which the baker had not\r\nfound time to remove from the ovens the last time he left his shop,\r\nbecause circumstances compelled him to leave in such a hurry.\r\n\r\nIn one house (the only building in Pompeii which no woman is now allowed\r\nto enter,) were the small rooms and short beds of solid masonry, just as\r\nthey were in the old times, and on the walls were pictures which looked\r\nalmost as fresh as if they were painted yesterday, but which no pen could\r\nhave the hardihood to describe; and here and there were Latin\r\ninscriptions--obscene scintillations of wit, scratched by hands that\r\npossibly were uplifted to Heaven for succor in the midst of a driving\r\nstorm of fire before the night was done.\r\n\r\nIn one of the principal streets was a ponderous stone tank, and a\r\nwater-spout that supplied it, and where the tired, heated toilers from the\r\nCampagna used to rest their right hands when they bent over to put their\r\nlips to the spout, the thick stone was worn down to a broad groove an\r\ninch or two deep.  Think of the countless thousands of hands that had\r\npressed that spot in the ages that are gone, to so reduce a stone that\r\nis as hard as iron!\r\n\r\nThey had a great public bulletin board in Pompeii--a place where\r\nannouncements for gladiatorial combats, elections, and such things, were\r\nposted--not on perishable paper, but carved in enduring stone.  One lady,\r\nwho, I take it, was rich and well brought up, advertised a dwelling or so\r\nto rent, with baths and all the modern improvements, and several hundred\r\nshops, stipulating that the dwellings should not be put to immoral\r\npurposes.  You can find out who lived in many a house in Pompeii by the\r\ncarved stone door-plates affixed to them: and in the same way you can\r\ntell who they were that occupy the tombs.  Every where around are things\r\nthat reveal to you something of the customs and history of this forgotten\r\npeople.  But what would a volcano leave of an American city, if it once\r\nrained its cinders on it?  Hardly a sign or a symbol to tell its story.\r\n\r\nIn one of these long Pompeiian halls the skeleton of a man was found,\r\nwith ten pieces of gold in one hand and a large key in the other.  He had\r\nseized his money and started toward the door, but the fiery tempest\r\ncaught him at the very threshold, and he sank down and died.  One more\r\nminute of precious time would have saved him.  I saw the skeletons of a\r\nman, a woman, and two young girls.  The woman had her hands spread wide\r\napart, as if in mortal terror, and I imagined I could still trace upon\r\nher shapeless face something of the expression of wild despair that\r\ndistorted it when the heavens rained fire in these streets, so many ages\r\nago.  The girls and the man lay with their faces upon their arms, as if\r\nthey had tried to shield them from the enveloping cinders.  In one\r\napartment eighteen skeletons were found, all in sitting postures, and\r\nblackened places on the walls still mark their shapes and show their\r\nattitudes, like shadows.  One of them, a woman, still wore upon her\r\nskeleton throat a necklace, with her name engraved upon it--JULIE DI\r\nDIOMEDE.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most poetical thing Pompeii has yielded to modern\r\nresearch, was that grand figure of a Roman soldier, clad in complete\r\narmor; who, true to his duty, true to his proud name of a soldier of\r\nRome, and full of the stern courage which had given to that name its\r\nglory, stood to his post by the city gate, erect and unflinching, till\r\nthe hell that raged around him burned out the dauntless spirit it could\r\nnot conquer.\r\n\r\nWe never read of Pompeii but we think of that soldier; we can not write\r\nof Pompeii without the natural impulse to grant to him the mention he so\r\nwell deserves.  Let us remember that he was a soldier--not a policeman\r\n--and so, praise him.  Being a soldier, he staid,--because the warrior\r\ninstinct forbade him to fly.  Had he been a policeman he would have\r\nstaid, also--because he would have been asleep.\r\n\r\nThere are not half a dozen flights of stairs in Pompeii, and no other\r\nevidences that the houses were more than one story high.  The people did\r\nnot live in the clouds, as do the Venetians, the Genoese and Neapolitans\r\nof to-day.\r\n\r\nWe came out from under the solemn mysteries of this city of the Venerable\r\nPast--this city which perished, with all its old ways and its quaint old\r\nfashions about it, remote centuries ago, when the Disciples were\r\npreaching the new religion, which is as old as the hills to us now--and\r\nwent dreaming among the trees that grow over acres and acres of its still\r\nburied streets and squares, till a shrill whistle and the cry of \xe2\x80\x9cAll\r\naboard--last train for Naples!\xe2\x80\x9d  woke me up and reminded me that I\r\nbelonged in the nineteenth century, and was not a dusty mummy, caked with\r\nashes and cinders, eighteen hundred years old.  The transition was\r\nstartling.  The idea of a railroad train actually running to old dead\r\nPompeii, and whistling irreverently, and calling for passengers in the\r\nmost bustling and business-like way, was as strange a thing as one could\r\nimagine, and as unpoetical and disagreeable as it was strange.\r\n\r\nCompare the cheerful life and the sunshine of this day with the horrors\r\nthe younger Pliny saw here, the 9th of November, A.D. 79, when he was so\r\nbravely striving to remove his mother out of reach of harm, while she\r\nbegged him, with all a mother's unselfishness, to leave her to perish and\r\nsave himself.\r\n\r\n     'By this time the murky darkness had so increased that one might\r\n     have believed himself abroad in a black and moonless night, or in a\r\n     chamber where all the lights had been extinguished.  On every hand\r\n     was heard the complaints of women, the wailing of children, and the\r\n     cries of men.  One called his father, another his son, and another\r\n     his wife, and only by their voices could they know each other.  Many\r\n     in their despair begged that death would come and end their\r\n     distress.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cSome implored the gods to succor them, and some believed that this\r\n     night was the last, the eternal night which should engulf the\r\n     universe!\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cEven so it seemed to me--and I consoled myself for the coming death\r\n     with the reflection: BEHOLD, THE WORLD IS PASSING AWAY!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nAfter browsing among the stately ruins of Rome, of Baiae, of Pompeii, and\r\nafter glancing down the long marble ranks of battered and nameless\r\nimperial heads that stretch down the corridors of the Vatican, one thing\r\nstrikes me with a force it never had before: the unsubstantial, unlasting\r\ncharacter of fame.  Men lived long lives, in the olden time, and\r\nstruggled feverishly through them, toiling like slaves, in oratory, in\r\ngeneralship, or in literature, and then laid them down and died, happy in\r\nthe possession of an enduring history and a deathless name.  Well, twenty\r\nlittle centuries flutter away, and what is left of these things?  A crazy\r\ninscription on a block of stone, which snuffy antiquaries bother over and\r\ntangle up and make nothing out of but a bare name (which they spell\r\nwrong)--no history, no tradition, no poetry--nothing that can give it\r\neven a passing interest.  What may be left of General Grant's great name\r\nforty centuries hence?  This--in the Encyclopedia for A. D. 5868,\r\npossibly:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cURIAH S. (or Z.) GRAUNT--popular poet of ancient times in the Aztec\r\n     provinces of the United States of British America.  Some authors say\r\n     flourished about A. D. 742; but the learned Ah-ah Foo-foo states\r\n     that he was a cotemporary of Scharkspyre, the English poet, and\r\n     flourished about A. D. 1328, some three centuries after the Trojan\r\n     war instead of before it.  He wrote 'Rock me to Sleep, Mother.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese thoughts sadden me.  I will to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nHome, again!  For the first time, in many weeks, the ship's entire family\r\nmet and shook hands on the quarter-deck.  They had gathered from many\r\npoints of the compass and from many lands, but not one was missing; there\r\nwas no tale of sickness or death among the flock to dampen the pleasure\r\nof the reunion.  Once more there was a full audience on deck to listen to\r\nthe sailors' chorus as they got the anchor up, and to wave an adieu to\r\nthe land as we sped away from Naples.  The seats were full at dinner\r\nagain, the domino parties were complete, and the life and bustle on the\r\nupper deck in the fine moonlight at night was like old times--old times\r\nthat had been gone weeks only, but yet they were weeks so crowded with\r\nincident, adventure and excitement, that they seemed almost like years.\r\nThere was no lack of cheerfulness on board the __Quaker City__.  For once,\r\nher title was a misnomer.\r\n\r\nAt seven in the evening, with the western horizon all golden from the\r\nsunken sun, and specked with distant ships, the full moon sailing high\r\nover head, the dark blue of the sea under foot, and a strange sort of\r\ntwilight affected by all these different lights and colors around us and\r\nabout us, we sighted superb Stromboli.  With what majesty the monarch\r\nheld his lonely state above the level sea!  Distance clothed him in a\r\npurple gloom, and added a veil of shimmering mist that so softened his\r\nrugged features that we seemed to see him through a web of silver gauze.\r\nHis torch was out; his fires were smoldering; a tall column of smoke that\r\nrose up and lost itself in the growing moonlight was all the sign he gave\r\nthat he was a living Autocrat of the Sea and not the spectre of a dead\r\none.\r\n\r\nAt two in the morning we swept through the Straits of Messina, and so\r\nbright was the moonlight that Italy on the one hand and Sicily on the\r\nother seemed almost as distinctly visible as though we looked at them\r\nfrom the middle of a street we were traversing.  The city of Messina,\r\nmilk-white, and starred and spangled all over with gaslights, was a fairy\r\nspectacle.  A great party of us were on deck smoking and making a noise,\r\nand waiting to see famous Scylla and Charybdis.  And presently the Oracle\r\nstepped out with his eternal spy-glass and squared himself on the deck\r\nlike another Colossus of Rhodes.  It was a surprise to see him abroad at\r\nsuch an hour.  Nobody supposed he cared anything about an old fable like\r\nthat of Scylla and Charybdis.  One of the boys said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, doctor, what are you doing up here at this time of night?--What\r\ndo you want to see this place for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I want to see this place for?  Young man, little do you know me,\r\nor you wouldn't ask such a question.  I wish to see all the places that's\r\nmentioned in the Bible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff--this place isn't mentioned in the Bible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain't mentioned in the Bible!--this place ain't--well now, what place\r\nis this, since you know so much about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy it's Scylla and Charybdis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScylla and Cha--confound it, I thought it was Sodom and Gomorrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he closed up his glass and went below.  The above is the ship story.\r\nIts plausibility is marred a little by the fact that the Oracle was not a\r\nbiblical student, and did not spend much of his time instructing himself\r\nabout Scriptural localities.--They say the Oracle complains, in this hot\r\nweather, lately, that the only beverage in the ship that is passable, is\r\nthe butter.  He did not mean butter, of course, but inasmuch as that\r\narticle remains in a melted state now since we are out of ice, it is fair\r\nto give him the credit of getting one long word in the right place,\r\nanyhow, for once in his life.  He said, in Rome, that the Pope was a\r\nnoble-looking old man, but he never did think much of his Iliad.\r\n\r\nWe spent one pleasant day skirting along the Isles of Greece.  They are\r\nvery mountainous.  Their prevailing tints are gray and brown, approaching\r\nto red.  Little white villages surrounded by trees, nestle in the valleys\r\nor roost upon the lofty perpendicular sea-walls.\r\n\r\nWe had one fine sunset--a rich carmine flush that suffused the western\r\nsky and cast a ruddy glow far over the sea.--Fine sunsets seem to be\r\nrare in this part of the world--or at least, striking ones.  They are\r\nsoft, sensuous, lovely--they are exquisite refined, effeminate, but we\r\nhave seen no sunsets here yet like the gorgeous conflagrations that flame\r\nin the track of the sinking sun in our high northern latitudes.\r\n\r\nBut what were sunsets to us, with the wild excitement upon us of\r\napproaching the most renowned of cities!  What cared we for outward\r\nvisions, when Agamemnon, Achilles, and a thousand other heroes of the\r\ngreat Past were marching in ghostly procession through our fancies?  What\r\nwere sunsets to us, who were about to live and breathe and walk in actual\r\nAthens; yea, and go far down into the dead centuries and bid in person\r\nfor the slaves, Diogenes and Plato, in the public market-place, or gossip\r\nwith the neighbors about the siege of Troy or the splendid deeds of\r\nMarathon?  We scorned to consider sunsets.\r\n\r\nWe arrived, and entered the ancient harbor of the Piraeus at last.  We\r\ndropped anchor within half a mile of the village.  Away off, across the\r\nundulating Plain of Attica, could be seen a little square-topped hill\r\nwith a something on it, which our glasses soon discovered to be the\r\nruined edifices of the citadel of the Athenians, and most prominent among\r\nthem loomed the venerable Parthenon.  So exquisitely clear and pure is\r\nthis wonderful atmosphere that every column of the noble structure was\r\ndiscernible through the telescope, and even the smaller ruins about it\r\nassumed some semblance of shape.  This at a distance of five or six\r\nmiles.  In the valley, near the Acropolis, (the square-topped hill before\r\nspoken of,) Athens itself could be vaguely made out with an ordinary\r\nlorgnette.  Every body was anxious to get ashore and visit these classic\r\nlocalities as quickly as possible.  No land we had yet seen had aroused\r\nsuch universal interest among the passengers.\r\n\r\nBut bad news came.  The commandant of the Piraeus came in his boat, and\r\nsaid we must either depart or else get outside the harbor and remain\r\nimprisoned in our ship, under rigid quarantine, for eleven days!  So we\r\ntook up the anchor and moved outside, to lie a dozen hours or so, taking\r\nin supplies, and then sail for Constantinople.  It was the bitterest\r\ndisappointment we had yet experienced.  To lie a whole day in sight of\r\nthe Acropolis, and yet be obliged to go away without visiting Athens!\r\nDisappointment was hardly a strong enough word to describe the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nAll hands were on deck, all the afternoon, with books and maps and\r\nglasses, trying to determine which \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow rocky ridge\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\nAreopagus, which sloping hill the Pnyx, which elevation the Museum Hill,\r\nand so on.  And we got things confused.  Discussion became heated, and\r\nparty spirit ran high.  Church members were gazing with emotion upon a\r\nhill which they said was the one St. Paul preached from, and another\r\nfaction claimed that that hill was Hymettus, and another that it was\r\nPentelicon!  After all the trouble, we could be certain of only one\r\nthing--the square-topped hill was the Acropolis, and the grand ruin that\r\ncrowned it was the Parthenon, whose picture we knew in infancy in the\r\nschool books.\r\n\r\nWe inquired of every body who came near the ship, whether there were\r\nguards in the Piraeus, whether they were strict, what the chances were of\r\ncapture should any of us slip ashore, and in case any of us made the\r\nventure and were caught, what would be probably done to us?  The answers\r\nwere discouraging: There was a strong guard or police force; the Piraeus\r\nwas a small town, and any stranger seen in it would surely attract\r\nattention--capture would be certain.  The commandant said the punishment\r\nwould be \xe2\x80\x9cheavy;\xe2\x80\x9d when asked \xe2\x80\x9chow heavy?\xe2\x80\x9d he said it would be \xe2\x80\x9cvery\r\nsevere\xe2\x80\x9d--that was all we could get out of him.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock at night, when most of the ship's company were abed,\r\nfour of us stole softly ashore in a small boat, a clouded moon favoring\r\nthe enterprise, and started two and two, and far apart, over a low hill,\r\nintending to go clear around the Piraeus, out of the range of its police.\r\nPicking our way so stealthily over that rocky, nettle-grown eminence,\r\nmade me feel a good deal as if I were on my way somewhere to steal\r\nsomething.  My immediate comrade and I talked in an undertone about\r\nquarantine laws and their penalties, but we found nothing cheering in the\r\nsubject.  I was posted.  Only a few days before, I was talking with our\r\ncaptain, and he mentioned the case of a man who swam ashore from a\r\nquarantined ship somewhere, and got imprisoned six months for it; and\r\nwhen he was in Genoa a few years ago, a captain of a quarantined ship\r\nwent in his boat to a departing ship, which was already outside of the\r\nharbor, and put a letter on board to be taken to his family, and the\r\nauthorities imprisoned him three months for it, and then conducted him\r\nand his ship fairly to sea, and warned him never to show himself in that\r\nport again while he lived.  This kind of conversation did no good,\r\nfurther than to give a sort of dismal interest to our quarantine-breaking\r\nexpedition, and so we dropped it.  We made the entire circuit of the town\r\nwithout seeing any body but one man, who stared at us curiously, but said\r\nnothing, and a dozen persons asleep on the ground before their doors,\r\nwhom we walked among and never woke--but we woke up dogs enough, in all\r\nconscience--we always had one or two barking at our heels, and several\r\ntimes we had as many as ten and twelve at once.  They made such a\r\npreposterous din that persons aboard our ship said they could tell how we\r\nwere progressing for a long time, and where we were, by the barking of\r\nthe dogs.  The clouded moon still favored us.  When we had made the whole\r\ncircuit, and were passing among the houses on the further side of the\r\ntown, the moon came out splendidly, but we no longer feared the light.\r\nAs we approached a well, near a house, to get a drink, the owner merely\r\nglanced at us and went within.  He left the quiet, slumbering town at our\r\nmercy.  I record it here proudly, that we didn't do any thing to it.\r\n\r\nSeeing no road, we took a tall hill to the left of the distant Acropolis\r\nfor a mark, and steered straight for it over all obstructions, and over a\r\nlittle rougher piece of country than exists any where else outside of the\r\nState of Nevada, perhaps.  Part of the way it was covered with small,\r\nloose stones--we trod on six at a time, and they all rolled.  Another\r\npart of it was dry, loose, newly-ploughed ground.  Still another part of\r\nit was a long stretch of low grape-vines, which were tanglesome and\r\ntroublesome, and which we took to be brambles.  The Attic Plain, barring\r\nthe grape-vines, was a barren, desolate, unpoetical waste--I wonder what\r\nit was in Greece's Age of Glory, five hundred years before Christ?\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of one o'clock in the morning, when we were heated\r\nwith fast walking and parched with thirst, Denny exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, these\r\nweeds are grape-vines!\xe2\x80\x9d  and in five minutes we had a score of bunches of\r\nlarge, white, delicious grapes, and were reaching down for more when a\r\ndark shape rose mysteriously up out of the shadows beside us and said\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo!\xe2\x80\x9d  And so we left.\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes more we struck into a beautiful road, and unlike some\r\nothers we had stumbled upon at intervals, it led in the right direction.\r\nWe followed it.  It was broad, and smooth, and white--handsome and in\r\nperfect repair, and shaded on both sides for a mile or so with single\r\nranks of trees, and also with luxuriant vineyards.  Twice we entered and\r\nstole grapes, and the second time somebody shouted at us from some\r\ninvisible place.  Whereupon we left again.  We speculated in grapes no\r\nmore on that side of Athens.\r\n\r\nShortly we came upon an ancient stone aqueduct, built upon arches, and\r\nfrom that time forth we had ruins all about us--we were approaching our\r\njourney's end.  We could not see the Acropolis now or the high hill,\r\neither, and I wanted to follow the road till we were abreast of them, but\r\nthe others overruled me, and we toiled laboriously up the stony hill\r\nimmediately in our front--and from its summit saw another--climbed it and\r\nsaw another!  It was an hour of exhausting work.  Soon we came upon a row\r\nof open graves, cut in the solid rock--(for a while one of them served\r\nSocrates for a prison)--we passed around the shoulder of the hill, and\r\nthe citadel, in all its ruined magnificence, burst upon us!  We hurried\r\nacross the ravine and up a winding road, and stood on the old Acropolis,\r\nwith the prodigious walls of the citadel towering above our heads.  We\r\ndid not stop to inspect their massive blocks of marble, or measure their\r\nheight, or guess at their extraordinary thickness, but passed at once\r\nthrough a great arched passage like a railway tunnel, and went straight\r\nto the gate that leads to the ancient temples.  It was locked!  So, after\r\nall, it seemed that we were not to see the great Parthenon face to face.\r\nWe sat down and held a council of war.  Result: the gate was only a\r\nflimsy structure of wood--we would break it down.  It seemed like\r\ndesecration, but then we had traveled far, and our necessities were\r\nurgent.  We could not hunt up guides and keepers--we must be on the ship\r\nbefore daylight.  So we argued.  This was all very fine, but when we came\r\nto break the gate, we could not do it.  We moved around an angle of the\r\nwall and found a low bastion--eight feet high without--ten or twelve\r\nwithin.  Denny prepared to scale it, and we got ready to follow.  By dint\r\nof hard scrambling he finally straddled the top, but some loose stones\r\ncrumbled away and fell with a crash into the court within.  There was\r\ninstantly a banging of doors and a shout.  Denny dropped from the wall in\r\na twinkling, and we retreated in disorder to the gate.  Xerxes took that\r\nmighty citadel four hundred and eighty years before Christ, when his five\r\nmillions of soldiers and camp-followers followed him to Greece, and if we\r\nfour Americans could have remained unmolested five minutes longer, we\r\nwould have taken it too.\r\n\r\nThe garrison had turned out--four Greeks.  We clamored at the gate, and\r\nthey admitted us.  [Bribery and corruption.]\r\n\r\nWe crossed a large court, entered a great door, and stood upon a pavement\r\nof purest white marble, deeply worn by footprints.  Before us, in the\r\nflooding moonlight, rose the noblest ruins we had ever looked upon--the\r\nPropylae; a small Temple of Minerva; the Temple of Hercules, and the\r\ngrand Parthenon.  [We got these names from the Greek guide, who didn't\r\nseem to know more than seven men ought to know.] These edifices were all\r\nbuilt of the whitest Pentelic marble, but have a pinkish stain upon them\r\nnow.  Where any part is broken, however, the fracture looks like fine\r\nloaf sugar.  Six caryatides, or marble women, clad in flowing robes,\r\nsupport the portico of the Temple of Hercules, but the porticos and\r\ncolonnades of the other structures are formed of massive Doric and Ionic\r\npillars, whose flutings and capitals are still measurably perfect,\r\nnotwithstanding the centuries that have gone over them and the sieges\r\nthey have suffered.  The Parthenon, originally, was two hundred and\r\ntwenty-six feet long, one hundred wide, and seventy high, and had two\r\nrows of great columns, eight in each, at either end, and single rows of\r\nseventeen each down the sides, and was one of the most graceful and\r\nbeautiful edifices ever erected.\r\n\r\nMost of the Parthenon's imposing columns are still standing, but the roof\r\nis gone.  It was a perfect building two hundred and fifty years ago, when\r\na shell dropped into the Venetian magazine stored here, and the explosion\r\nwhich followed wrecked and unroofed it.  I remember but little about the\r\nParthenon, and I have put in one or two facts and figures for the use of\r\nother people with short memories.  Got them from the guide-book.\r\n\r\nAs we wandered thoughtfully down the marble-paved length of this stately\r\ntemple, the scene about us was strangely impressive.  Here and there, in\r\nlavish profusion, were gleaming white statues of men and women, propped\r\nagainst blocks of marble, some of them armless, some without legs, others\r\nheadless--but all looking mournful in the moonlight, and startlingly\r\nhuman!  They rose up and confronted the midnight intruder on every side\r\n--they stared at him with stony eyes from unlooked-for nooks and recesses;\r\nthey peered at him over fragmentary heaps far down the desolate\r\ncorridors; they barred his way in the midst of the broad forum, and\r\nsolemnly pointed with handless arms the way from the sacred fane; and\r\nthrough the roofless temple the moon looked down, and banded the floor\r\nand darkened the scattered fragments and broken statues with the slanting\r\nshadows of the columns.\r\n\r\nWhat a world of ruined sculpture was about us!  Set up in rows--stacked\r\nup in piles--scattered broadcast over the wide area of the Acropolis\r\n--were hundreds of crippled statues of all sizes and of the most exquisite\r\nworkmanship; and vast fragments of marble that once belonged to the\r\nentablatures, covered with bas-reliefs representing battles and sieges,\r\nships of war with three and four tiers of oars, pageants and processions\r\n--every thing one could think of.  History says that the temples of the\r\nAcropolis were filled with the noblest works of Praxiteles and Phidias,\r\nand of many a great master in sculpture besides--and surely these elegant\r\nfragments attest it.\r\n\r\nWe walked out into the grass-grown, fragment-strewn court beyond the\r\nParthenon.  It startled us, every now and then, to see a stony white face\r\nstare suddenly up at us out of the grass with its dead eyes.  The place\r\nseemed alive with ghosts.  I half expected to see the Athenian heroes of\r\ntwenty centuries ago glide out of the shadows and steal into the old\r\ntemple they knew so well and regarded with such boundless pride.\r\n\r\nThe full moon was riding high in the cloudless heavens, now.  We\r\nsauntered carelessly and unthinkingly to the edge of the lofty\r\nbattlements of the citadel, and looked down--a vision!  And such a\r\nvision!  Athens by moonlight!  The prophet that thought the splendors of\r\nthe New Jerusalem were revealed to him, surely saw this instead!  It lay\r\nin the level plain right under our feet--all spread abroad like a\r\npicture--and we looked down upon it as we might have looked from a\r\nballoon.  We saw no semblance of a street, but every house, every window,\r\nevery clinging vine, every projection was as distinct and sharply marked\r\nas if the time were noon-day; and yet there was no glare, no glitter,\r\nnothing harsh or repulsive--the noiseless city was flooded with the\r\nmellowest light that ever streamed from the moon, and seemed like some\r\nliving creature wrapped in peaceful slumber.  On its further side was a\r\nlittle temple, whose delicate pillars and ornate front glowed with a rich\r\nlustre that chained the eye like a spell; and nearer by, the palace of\r\nthe king reared its creamy walls out of the midst of a great garden of\r\nshrubbery that was flecked all over with a random shower of amber lights\r\n--a spray of golden sparks that lost their brightness in the glory of the\r\nmoon, and glinted softly upon the sea of dark foliage like the pallid\r\nstars of the milky-way.  Overhead the stately columns, majestic still in\r\ntheir ruin--under foot the dreaming city--in the distance the silver sea\r\n--not on the broad earth is there an other picture half so beautiful!\r\n\r\nAs we turned and moved again through the temple, I wished that the\r\nillustrious men who had sat in it in the remote ages could visit it again\r\nand reveal themselves to our curious eyes--Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes,\r\nSocrates, Phocion, Pythagoras, Euclid, Pindar, Xenophon, Herodotus,\r\nPraxiteles and Phidias, Zeuxis the painter.  What a constellation of\r\ncelebrated names!  But more than all, I wished that old Diogenes, groping\r\nso patiently with his lantern, searching so zealously for one solitary\r\nhonest man in all the world, might meander along and stumble on our\r\nparty.  I ought not to say it, may be, but still I suppose he would have\r\nput out his light.\r\n\r\nWe left the Parthenon to keep its watch over old Athens, as it had kept\r\nit for twenty-three hundred years, and went and stood outside the walls\r\nof the citadel.  In the distance was the ancient, but still almost\r\nperfect Temple of Theseus, and close by, looking to the west, was the\r\nBema, from whence Demosthenes thundered his philippics and fired the\r\nwavering patriotism of his countrymen.  To the right was Mars Hill, where\r\nthe Areopagus sat in ancient times and where St. Paul defined his\r\nposition, and below was the market-place where he \xe2\x80\x9cdisputed daily\xe2\x80\x9d with\r\nthe gossip-loving Athenians.  We climbed the stone steps St. Paul\r\nascended, and stood in the square-cut place he stood in, and tried to\r\nrecollect the Bible account of the matter--but for certain reasons, I\r\ncould not recall the words.  I have found them since:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cNow while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in\r\n     him, when he saw the city wholly given up to idolatry.  Therefore\r\n     disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout\r\n     persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.\r\n                         * * * * * * * * *\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they took him and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we\r\n     know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is?\r\n                         * * * * * * * * *\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThen Paul stood in the midst of Mars hill, and said, Ye men of\r\n     Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious; For\r\n     as I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this\r\n     inscription: To THE UNKNOWN GOD.  Whom, therefore, ye ignorantly\r\n     worship, him declare I unto you.\xe2\x80\x9d--Acts, ch. xvii.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt occurred to us, after a while, that if we wanted to get home before\r\ndaylight betrayed us, we had better be moving.  So we hurried away.  When\r\nfar on our road, we had a parting view of the Parthenon, with the\r\nmoonlight streaming through its open colonnades and touching its capitals\r\nwith silver.  As it looked then, solemn, grand, and beautiful it will\r\nalways remain in our memories.\r\n\r\nAs we marched along, we began to get over our fears, and ceased to care\r\nmuch about quarantine scouts or any body else.  We grew bold and\r\nreckless; and once, in a sudden burst of courage, I even threw a stone at\r\na dog.  It was a pleasant reflection, though, that I did not hit him,\r\nbecause his master might just possibly have been a policeman.  Inspired\r\nby this happy failure, my valor became utterly uncontrollable, and at\r\nintervals I absolutely whistled, though on a moderate key.  But boldness\r\nbreeds boldness, and shortly I plunged into a Vineyard, in the full light\r\nof the moon, and captured a gallon of superb grapes, not even minding the\r\npresence of a peasant who rode by on a mule.  Denny and Birch followed my\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nNow I had grapes enough for a dozen, but then Jackson was all swollen up\r\nwith courage, too, and he was obliged to enter a vineyard presently.  The\r\nfirst bunch he seized brought trouble.  A frowsy, bearded brigand sprang\r\ninto the road with a shout, and flourished a musket in the light of the\r\nmoon!  We sidled toward the Piraeus--not running you understand, but only\r\nadvancing with celerity.  The brigand shouted again, but still we\r\nadvanced.  It was getting late, and we had no time to fool away on every\r\nass that wanted to drivel Greek platitudes to us.  We would just as soon\r\nhave talked with him as not if we had not been in a hurry.  Presently\r\nDenny said, \xe2\x80\x9cThose fellows are following us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe turned, and, sure enough, there they were--three fantastic pirates\r\narmed with guns.  We slackened our pace to let them come up, and in the\r\nmeantime I got out my cargo of grapes and dropped them firmly but\r\nreluctantly into the shadows by the wayside.  But I was not afraid.  I\r\nonly felt that it was not right to steal grapes.  And all the more so\r\nwhen the owner was around--and not only around, but with his friends\r\naround also.  The villains came up and searched a bundle Dr. Birch had in\r\nhis hand, and scowled upon him when they found it had nothing in it but\r\nsome holy rocks from Mars Hill, and these were not contraband.  They\r\nevidently suspected him of playing some wretched fraud upon them, and\r\nseemed half inclined to scalp the party.  But finally they dismissed us\r\nwith a warning, couched in excellent Greek, I suppose, and dropped\r\ntranquilly in our wake.  When they had gone three hundred yards they\r\nstopped, and we went on rejoiced.  But behold, another armed rascal came\r\nout of the shadows and took their place, and followed us two hundred\r\nyards.  Then he delivered us over to another miscreant, who emerged from\r\nsome mysterious place, and he in turn to another!  For a mile and a half\r\nour rear was guarded all the while by armed men.  I never traveled in so\r\nmuch state before in all my life.\r\n\r\nIt was a good while after that before we ventured to steal any more\r\ngrapes, and when we did we stirred up another troublesome brigand, and\r\nthen we ceased all further speculation in that line.  I suppose that\r\nfellow that rode by on the mule posted all the sentinels, from Athens to\r\nthe Piraeus, about us.\r\n\r\nEvery field on that long route was watched by an armed sentinel, some of\r\nwhom had fallen asleep, no doubt, but were on hand, nevertheless.  This\r\nshows what sort of a country modern Attica is--a community of\r\nquestionable characters.  These men were not there to guard their\r\npossessions against strangers, but against each other; for strangers\r\nseldom visit Athens and the Piraeus, and when they do, they go in\r\ndaylight, and can buy all the grapes they want for a trifle.  The modern\r\ninhabitants are confiscators and falsifiers of high repute, if gossip\r\nspeaks truly concerning them, and I freely believe it does.\r\n\r\nJust as the earliest tinges of the dawn flushed the eastern sky and\r\nturned the pillared Parthenon to a broken harp hung in the pearly\r\nhorizon, we closed our thirteenth mile of weary, round-about marching,\r\nand emerged upon the sea-shore abreast the ships, with our usual escort\r\nof fifteen hundred Piraean dogs howling at our heels.  We hailed a boat\r\nthat was two or three hundred yards from shore, and discovered\r\nin a moment that it was a police-boat on the lookout for any\r\nquarantine-breakers that might chance to be abroad.  So we dodged--we\r\nwere used to that by this time--and when the scouts reached the spot we\r\nhad so lately occupied, we were absent.  They cruised along the shore,\r\nbut in the wrong direction, and shortly our own boat issued from the\r\ngloom and took us aboard.  They had heard our signal on the ship.  We\r\nrowed noiselessly away, and before the police-boat came in sight again,\r\nwe were safe at home once more.\r\n\r\nFour more of our passengers were anxious to visit Athens, and started\r\nhalf an hour after we returned; but they had not been ashore five minutes\r\ntill the police discovered and chased them so hotly that they barely\r\nescaped to their boat again, and that was all.  They pursued the\r\nenterprise no further.\r\n\r\nWe set sail for Constantinople to-day, but some of us little care for\r\nthat.  We have seen all there was to see in the old city that had its\r\nbirth sixteen hundred years before Christ was born, and was an old town\r\nbefore the foundations of Troy were laid--and saw it in its most\r\nattractive aspect.  Wherefore, why should we worry?\r\n\r\nTwo other passengers ran the blockade successfully last night.  So we\r\nlearned this morning.  They slipped away so quietly that they were not\r\nmissed from the ship for several hours.  They had the hardihood to march\r\ninto the Piraeus in the early dusk and hire a carriage.  They ran some\r\ndanger of adding two or three months' imprisonment to the other novelties\r\nof their Holy Land Pleasure Excursion.  I admire \xe2\x80\x9ccheek.\xe2\x80\x9d--[Quotation\r\nfrom the Pilgrims.]--But they went and came safely, and never walked a\r\nstep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nFrom Athens all through the islands of the Grecian Archipelago, we saw\r\nlittle but forbidding sea-walls and barren hills, sometimes surmounted by\r\nthree or four graceful columns of some ancient temple, lonely and\r\ndeserted--a fitting symbol of the desolation that has come upon all\r\nGreece in these latter ages.  We saw no ploughed fields, very few\r\nvillages, no trees or grass or vegetation of any kind, scarcely, and\r\nhardly ever an isolated house.  Greece is a bleak, unsmiling desert,\r\nwithout agriculture, manufactures or commerce, apparently.  What supports\r\nits poverty-stricken people or its Government, is a mystery.\r\n\r\nI suppose that ancient Greece and modern Greece compared, furnish the\r\nmost extravagant contrast to be found in history.  George I., an infant\r\nof eighteen, and a scraggy nest of foreign office holders, sit in the\r\nplaces of Themistocles, Pericles, and the illustrious scholars and\r\ngenerals of the Golden Age of Greece.  The fleets that were the wonder of\r\nthe world when the Parthenon was new, are a beggarly handful of\r\nfishing-smacks now, and the manly people that performed such miracles of\r\nvalor at Marathon are only a tribe of unconsidered slaves to-day.  The\r\nclassic Illyssus has gone dry, and so have all the sources of Grecian\r\nwealth and greatness.  The nation numbers only eight hundred thousand\r\nsouls, and there is poverty and misery and mendacity enough among them\r\nto furnish forty millions and be liberal about it.  Under King Otho the\r\nrevenues of the State were five millions of dollars--raised from a tax\r\nof one-tenth of all the agricultural products of the land (which tenth\r\nthe farmer had to bring to the royal granaries on pack-mules any\r\ndistance not exceeding six leagues) and from extravagant taxes on trade\r\nand commerce.  Out of that five millions the small tyrant tried to keep\r\nan army of ten thousand men, pay all the hundreds of useless Grand\r\nEquerries in Waiting, First Grooms of the Bedchamber, Lord High\r\nChancellors of the Exploded Exchequer, and all the other absurdities\r\nwhich these puppy-kingdoms indulge in, in imitation of the great\r\nmonarchies; and in addition he set about building a white marble palace\r\nto cost about five millions itself. The result was, simply: ten into\r\nfive goes no times and none over.  All these things could not be done\r\nwith five millions, and Otho fell into trouble.\r\n\r\nThe Greek throne, with its unpromising adjuncts of a ragged population of\r\ningenious rascals who were out of employment eight months in the year\r\nbecause there was little for them to borrow and less to confiscate, and a\r\nwaste of barren hills and weed-grown deserts, went begging for a good\r\nwhile.  It was offered to one of Victoria's sons, and afterwards to\r\nvarious other younger sons of royalty who had no thrones and were out of\r\nbusiness, but they all had the charity to decline the dreary honor, and\r\nveneration enough for Greece's ancient greatness to refuse to mock her\r\nsorrowful rags and dirt with a tinsel throne in this day of her\r\nhumiliation--till they came to this young Danish George, and he took it.\r\nHe has finished the splendid palace I saw in the radiant moonlight the\r\nother night, and is doing many other things for the salvation of Greece,\r\nthey say.\r\n\r\nWe sailed through the barren Archipelago, and into the narrow channel\r\nthey sometimes call the Dardanelles and sometimes the Hellespont.  This\r\npart of the country is rich in historic reminiscences, and poor as Sahara\r\nin every thing else.  For instance, as we approached the Dardanelles, we\r\ncoasted along the Plains of Troy and past the mouth of the Scamander; we\r\nsaw where Troy had stood (in the distance,) and where it does not stand\r\nnow--a city that perished when the world was young.  The poor Trojans are\r\nall dead, now.  They were born too late to see Noah's ark, and died too\r\nsoon to see our menagerie.  We saw where Agamemnon's fleets rendezvoused,\r\nand away inland a mountain which the map said was Mount Ida.  Within the\r\nHellespont we saw where the original first shoddy contract mentioned in\r\nhistory was carried out, and the \xe2\x80\x9cparties of the second part\xe2\x80\x9d gently\r\nrebuked by Xerxes.  I speak of the famous bridge of boats which Xerxes\r\nordered to be built over the narrowest part of the Hellespont (where it\r\nis only two or three miles wide.) A moderate gale destroyed the flimsy\r\nstructure, and the King, thinking that to publicly rebuke the contractors\r\nmight have a good effect on the next set, called them out before the army\r\nand had them beheaded.  In the next ten minutes he let a new contract for\r\nthe bridge.  It has been observed by ancient writers that the second\r\nbridge was a very good bridge.  Xerxes crossed his host of five millions\r\nof men on it, and if it had not been purposely destroyed, it would\r\nprobably have been there yet.  If our Government would rebuke some of our\r\nshoddy contractors occasionally, it might work much good.  In the\r\nHellespont we saw where Leander and Lord Byron swam across, the one to\r\nsee her upon whom his soul's affections were fixed with a devotion that\r\nonly death could impair, and the other merely for a flyer, as Jack says.\r\nWe had two noted tombs near us, too.  On one shore slept Ajax, and on the\r\nother Hecuba.\r\n\r\nWe had water batteries and forts on both sides of the Hellespont, flying\r\nthe crimson flag of Turkey, with its white crescent, and occasionally a\r\nvillage, and sometimes a train of camels; we had all these to look at\r\ntill we entered the broad sea of Marmora, and then the land soon fading\r\nfrom view, we resumed euchre and whist once more.\r\n\r\nWe dropped anchor in the mouth of the Golden Horn at daylight in the\r\nmorning.  Only three or four of us were up to see the great Ottoman\r\ncapital.  The passengers do not turn out at unseasonable hours, as they\r\nused to, to get the earliest possible glimpse of strange foreign cities.\r\nThey are well over that.  If we were lying in sight of the Pyramids of\r\nEgypt, they would not come on deck until after breakfast, now-a-days.\r\n\r\nThe Golden Horn is a narrow arm of the sea, which branches from the\r\nBosporus (a sort of broad river which connects the Marmora and Black\r\nSeas,) and, curving around, divides the city in the middle.  Galata and\r\nPera are on one side of the Bosporus, and the Golden Horn; Stamboul\r\n(ancient Byzantium) is upon the other.  On the other bank of the Bosporus\r\nis Scutari and other suburbs of Constantinople.  This great city contains\r\na million inhabitants, but so narrow are its streets, and so crowded\r\ntogether are its houses, that it does not cover much more than half as\r\nmuch ground as New York City.  Seen from the anchorage or from a mile or\r\nso up the Bosporus, it is by far the handsomest city we have seen.  Its\r\ndense array of houses swells upward from the water's edge, and spreads\r\nover the domes of many hills; and the gardens that peep out here and\r\nthere, the great globes of the mosques, and the countless minarets that\r\nmeet the eye every where, invest the metropolis with the quaint Oriental\r\naspect one dreams of when he reads books of eastern travel.\r\nConstantinople makes a noble picture.\r\n\r\nBut its attractiveness begins and ends with its picturesqueness.  From\r\nthe time one starts ashore till he gets back again, he execrates it.  The\r\nboat he goes in is admirably miscalculated for the service it is built\r\nfor.  It is handsomely and neatly fitted up, but no man could handle it\r\nwell in the turbulent currents that sweep down the Bosporus from the\r\nBlack Sea, and few men could row it satisfactorily even in still water.\r\nIt is a long, light canoe (caique,) large at one end and tapering to a\r\nknife blade at the other.  They make that long sharp end the bow, and you\r\ncan imagine how these boiling currents spin it about.  It has two oars,\r\nand sometimes four, and no rudder.  You start to go to a given point and\r\nyou run in fifty different directions before you get there.  First one\r\noar is backing water, and then the other; it is seldom that both are\r\ngoing ahead at once.  This kind of boating is calculated to drive an\r\nimpatient man mad in a week.  The boatmen are the awkwardest, the\r\nstupidest, and the most unscientific on earth, without question.\r\n\r\nAshore, it was--well, it was an eternal circus.  People were thicker than\r\nbees, in those narrow streets, and the men were dressed in all the\r\noutrageous, outlandish, idolatrous, extravagant, thunder-and-lightning\r\ncostumes that ever a tailor with the delirium tremens and seven devils\r\ncould conceive of.  There was no freak in dress too crazy to be indulged\r\nin; no absurdity too absurd to be tolerated; no frenzy in ragged\r\ndiabolism too fantastic to be attempted.  No two men were dressed alike.\r\nIt was a wild masquerade of all imaginable costumes--every struggling\r\nthrong in every street was a dissolving view of stunning contrasts.  Some\r\npatriarchs wore awful turbans, but the grand mass of the infidel horde\r\nwore the fiery red skull-cap they call a fez.  All the remainder of the\r\nraiment they indulged in was utterly indescribable.\r\n\r\nThe shops here are mere coops, mere boxes, bath-rooms, closets--any thing\r\nyou please to call them--on the first floor.  The Turks sit cross-legged\r\nin them, and work and trade and smoke long pipes, and smell like--like\r\nTurks.  That covers the ground.  Crowding the narrow streets in front of\r\nthem are beggars, who beg forever, yet never collect any thing; and\r\nwonderful cripples, distorted out of all semblance of humanity, almost;\r\nvagabonds driving laden asses; porters carrying dry-goods boxes as large\r\nas cottages on their backs; peddlers of grapes, hot corn, pumpkin seeds,\r\nand a hundred other things, yelling like fiends; and sleeping happily,\r\ncomfortably, serenely, among the hurrying feet, are the famed dogs of\r\nConstantinople; drifting noiselessly about are squads of Turkish women,\r\ndraped from chin to feet in flowing robes, and with snowy veils bound\r\nabout their heads, that disclose only the eyes and a vague, shadowy\r\nnotion of their features.  Seen moving about, far away in the dim, arched\r\naisles of the Great Bazaar, they look as the shrouded dead must have\r\nlooked when they walked forth from their graves amid the storms and\r\nthunders and earthquakes that burst upon Calvary that awful night of the\r\nCrucifixion.  A street in Constantinople is a picture which one ought to\r\nsee once--not oftener.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was the goose-rancher--a fellow who drove a hundred geese\r\nbefore him about the city, and tried to sell them.  He had a pole ten\r\nfeet long, with a crook in the end of it, and occasionally a goose would\r\nbranch out from the flock and make a lively break around the corner, with\r\nwings half lifted and neck stretched to its utmost.  Did the\r\ngoose-merchant get excited?  No.  He took his pole and reached after\r\nthat goose with unspeakable sang froid--took a hitch round his neck, and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyanked\xe2\x80\x9d him back to his place in the flock without an effort.  He\r\nsteered his geese with that stick as easily as another man would steer a\r\nyawl.  A few hours afterward we saw him sitting on a stone at a corner,\r\nin the midst of the turmoil, sound asleep in the sun, with his geese\r\nsquatting around him, or dodging out of the way of asses and men.  We\r\ncame by again, within the hour, and he was taking account of stock, to\r\nsee whether any of his flock had strayed or been stolen.  The way he did\r\nit was unique. He put the end of his stick within six or eight inches of\r\na stone wall, and made the geese march in single file between it and the\r\nwall.  He counted them as they went by.  There was no dodging that\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nIf you want dwarfs--I mean just a few dwarfs for a curiosity--go to\r\nGenoa.  If you wish to buy them by the gross, for retail, go to Milan.\r\nThere are plenty of dwarfs all over Italy, but it did seem to me that in\r\nMilan the crop was luxuriant.  If you would see a fair average style of\r\nassorted cripples, go to Naples, or travel through the Roman States.\r\nBut if you would see the very heart and home of cripples and human\r\nmonsters, both, go straight to Constantinople.  A beggar in Naples who\r\ncan show a foot which has all run into one horrible toe, with one\r\nshapeless nail on it, has a fortune--but such an exhibition as that would\r\nnot provoke any notice in Constantinople.  The man would starve.  Who\r\nwould pay any attention to attractions like his among the rare monsters\r\nthat throng the bridges of the Golden Horn and display their deformities\r\nin the gutters of Stamboul?  O, wretched impostor!  How could he stand\r\nagainst the three-legged woman, and the man with his eye in his cheek?\r\nHow would he blush in presence of the man with fingers on his elbow?\r\nWhere would he hide himself when the dwarf with seven fingers on each\r\nhand, no upper lip, and his under-jaw gone, came down in his majesty?\r\nBismillah!  The cripples of Europe are a delusion and a fraud.  The truly\r\ngifted flourish only in the by-ways of Pera and Stamboul.\r\n\r\nThat three-legged woman lay on the bridge, with her stock in trade so\r\ndisposed as to command the most striking effect--one natural leg, and two\r\nlong, slender, twisted ones with feet on them like somebody else's\r\nfore-arm.  Then there was a man further along who had no eyes, and whose\r\nface was the color of a fly-blown beefsteak, and wrinkled and twisted\r\nlike a lava-flow--and verily so tumbled and distorted were his features\r\nthat no man could tell the wart that served him for a nose from his\r\ncheek-bones. In Stamboul was a man with a prodigious head, an uncommonly\r\nlong body, legs eight inches long and feet like snow-shoes.  He traveled\r\non those feet and his hands, and was as sway-backed as if the Colossus\r\nof Rhodes had been riding him.  Ah, a beggar has to have exceedingly\r\ngood points to make a living in Constantinople.  A blue-faced man, who\r\nhad nothing to offer except that he had been blown up in a mine, would\r\nbe regarded as a rank impostor, and a mere damaged soldier on crutches\r\nwould never make a cent.  It would pay him to get apiece of his head\r\ntaken off, and cultivate a wen like a carpet sack.\r\n\r\nThe Mosque of St. Sophia is the chief lion of Constantinople.  You must\r\nget a firman and hurry there the first thing.  We did that.  We did not\r\nget a firman, but we took along four or five francs apiece, which is much\r\nthe same thing.\r\n\r\nI do not think much of the Mosque of St. Sophia.  I suppose I lack\r\nappreciation.  We will let it go at that.  It is the rustiest old barn in\r\nheathendom.  I believe all the interest that attaches to it comes from\r\nthe fact that it was built for a Christian church and then turned into a\r\nmosque, without much alteration, by the Mohammedan conquerors of the\r\nland.  They made me take off my boots and walk into the place in my\r\nstocking-feet.  I caught cold, and got myself so stuck up with a\r\ncomplication of gums, slime and general corruption, that I wore out more\r\nthan two thousand pair of boot-jacks getting my boots off that night, and\r\neven then some Christian hide peeled off with them.  I abate not a single\r\nboot-jack.\r\n\r\nSt. Sophia is a colossal church, thirteen or fourteen hundred years old,\r\nand unsightly enough to be very, very much older.  Its immense dome is\r\nsaid to be more wonderful than St. Peter's, but its dirt is much more\r\nwonderful than its dome, though they never mention it.  The church has a\r\nhundred and seventy pillars in it, each a single piece, and all of costly\r\nmarbles of various kinds, but they came from ancient temples at Baalbec,\r\nHeliopolis, Athens and Ephesus, and are battered, ugly and repulsive.\r\nThey were a thousand years old when this church was new, and then the\r\ncontrast must have been ghastly--if Justinian's architects did not trim\r\nthem any.  The inside of the dome is figured all over with a monstrous\r\ninscription in Turkish characters, wrought in gold mosaic, that looks as\r\nglaring as a circus bill; the pavements and the marble balustrades are\r\nall battered and dirty; the perspective is marred every where by a web of\r\nropes that depend from the dizzy height of the dome, and suspend\r\ncountless dingy, coarse oil lamps, and ostrich-eggs, six or seven feet\r\nabove the floor.  Squatting and sitting in groups, here and there and far\r\nand near, were ragged Turks reading books, hearing sermons, or receiving\r\nlessons like children.  And in fifty places were more of the same sort\r\nbowing and straightening up, bowing again and getting down to kiss the\r\nearth, muttering prayers the while, and keeping up their gymnastics till\r\nthey ought to have been tired, if they were not.\r\n\r\nEvery where was dirt, and dust, and dinginess, and gloom; every where\r\nwere signs of a hoary antiquity, but with nothing touching or beautiful\r\nabout it; every where were those groups of fantastic pagans; overhead the\r\ngaudy mosaics and the web of lamp-ropes--nowhere was there any thing to\r\nwin one's love or challenge his admiration.\r\n\r\nThe people who go into ecstasies over St. Sophia must surely get them out\r\nof the guide-book (where every church is spoken of as being \xe2\x80\x9cconsidered\r\nby good judges to be the most marvelous structure, in many respects, that\r\nthe world has ever seen.\xe2\x80\x9d)  Or else they are those old connoisseurs from\r\nthe wilds of New Jersey who laboriously learn the difference between a\r\nfresco and a fire-plug and from that day forward feel privileged to void\r\ntheir critical bathos on painting, sculpture and architecture forever\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nWe visited the Dancing Dervishes.  There were twenty-one of them.  They\r\nwore a long, light-colored loose robe that hung to their heels.  Each in\r\nhis turn went up to the priest (they were all within a large circular\r\nrailing) and bowed profoundly and then went spinning away deliriously and\r\ntook his appointed place in the circle, and continued to spin.  When all\r\nhad spun themselves to their places, they were about five or six feet\r\napart--and so situated, the entire circle of spinning pagans spun itself\r\nthree separate times around the room.  It took twenty-five minutes to do\r\nit.  They spun on the left foot, and kept themselves going by passing the\r\nright rapidly before it and digging it against the waxed floor.  Some of\r\nthem made incredible \xe2\x80\x9ctime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Most of them spun around forty times in a\r\nminute, and one artist averaged about sixty-one times a minute, and kept\r\nit up during the whole twenty-five.  His robe filled with air and stood\r\nout all around him like a balloon.\r\n\r\nThey made no noise of any kind, and most of them tilted their heads back\r\nand closed their eyes, entranced with a sort of devotional ecstacy.\r\nThere was a rude kind of music, part of the time, but the musicians were\r\nnot visible.  None but spinners were allowed within the circle.  A man\r\nhad to either spin or stay outside.  It was about as barbarous an\r\nexhibition as we have witnessed yet.  Then sick persons came and lay\r\ndown, and beside them women laid their sick children (one a babe at the\r\nbreast,) and the patriarch of the Dervishes walked upon their bodies.  He\r\nwas supposed to cure their diseases by trampling upon their breasts or\r\nbacks or standing on the back of their necks.  This is well enough for a\r\npeople who think all their affairs are made or marred by viewless spirits\r\nof the air--by giants, gnomes, and genii--and who still believe, to this\r\nday, all the wild tales in the Arabian Nights.  Even so an intelligent\r\nmissionary tells me.\r\n\r\nWe visited the Thousand and One Columns.  I do not know what it was\r\noriginally intended for, but they said it was built for a reservoir.  It\r\nis situated in the centre of Constantinople.  You go down a flight of\r\nstone steps in the middle of a barren place, and there you are.  You are\r\nforty feet under ground, and in the midst of a perfect wilderness of\r\ntall, slender, granite columns, of Byzantine architecture.  Stand where\r\nyou would, or change your position as often as you pleased, you were\r\nalways a centre from which radiated a dozen long archways and colonnades\r\nthat lost themselves in distance and the sombre twilight of the place.\r\nThis old dried-up reservoir is occupied by a few ghostly silk-spinners\r\nnow, and one of them showed me a cross cut high up in one of the pillars.\r\nI suppose he meant me to understand that the institution was there before\r\nthe Turkish occupation, and I thought he made a remark to that effect;\r\nbut he must have had an impediment in his speech, for I did not\r\nunderstand him.\r\n\r\nWe took off our shoes and went into the marble mausoleum of the Sultan\r\nMahmoud, the neatest piece of architecture, inside, that I have seen\r\nlately.  Mahmoud's tomb was covered with a black velvet pall, which was\r\nelaborately embroidered with silver; it stood within a fancy silver\r\nrailing; at the sides and corners were silver candlesticks that would\r\nweigh more than a hundred pounds, and they supported candles as large as\r\na man's leg; on the top of the sarcophagus was a fez, with a handsome\r\ndiamond ornament upon it, which an attendant said cost a hundred thousand\r\npounds, and lied like a Turk when he said it.  Mahmoud's whole family\r\nwere comfortably planted around him.\r\n\r\nWe went to the great Bazaar in Stamboul, of course, and I shall not\r\ndescribe it further than to say it is a monstrous hive of little shops\r\n--thousands, I should say--all under one roof, and cut up into innumerable\r\nlittle blocks by narrow streets which are arched overhead.  One street is\r\ndevoted to a particular kind of merchandise, another to another, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nWhen you wish to buy a pair of shoes you have the swing of the whole\r\nstreet--you do not have to walk yourself down hunting stores in different\r\nlocalities.  It is the same with silks, antiquities, shawls, etc.  The\r\nplace is crowded with people all the time, and as the gay-colored Eastern\r\nfabrics are lavishly displayed before every shop, the great Bazaar of\r\nStamboul is one of the sights that are worth seeing.  It is full of life,\r\nand stir, and business, dirt, beggars, asses, yelling peddlers, porters,\r\ndervishes, high-born Turkish female shoppers, Greeks, and weird-looking\r\nand weirdly dressed Mohammedans from the mountains and the far provinces\r\n--and the only solitary thing one does not smell when he is in the Great\r\nBazaar, is something which smells good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nMosques are plenty, churches are plenty, graveyards are plenty, but\r\nmorals and whiskey are scarce.  The Koran does not permit Mohammedans to\r\ndrink.  Their natural instincts do not permit them to be moral.  They say\r\nthe Sultan has eight hundred wives.  This almost amounts to bigamy.  It\r\nmakes our cheeks burn with shame to see such a thing permitted here in\r\nTurkey.  We do not mind it so much in Salt Lake, however.\r\n\r\nCircassian and Georgian girls are still sold in Constantinople by their\r\nparents, but not publicly.  The great slave marts we have all read so\r\nmuch about--where tender young girls were stripped for inspection, and\r\ncriticised and discussed just as if they were horses at an agricultural\r\nfair--no longer exist.  The exhibition and the sales are private now.\r\nStocks are up, just at present, partly because of a brisk demand created\r\nby the recent return of the Sultan's suite from the courts of Europe;\r\npartly on account of an unusual abundance of bread-stuffs, which leaves\r\nholders untortured by hunger and enables them to hold back for high\r\nprices; and partly because buyers are too weak to bear the market, while\r\nsellers are amply prepared to bull it.  Under these circumstances, if the\r\nAmerican metropolitan newspapers were published here in Constantinople,\r\ntheir next commercial report would read about as follows, I suppose:\r\n\r\n                        SLAVE GIRL MARKET REPORT.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cBest brands Circassians, crop of 1850, L200; 1852, L250; 1854,\r\n     L300.  Best brands Georgian, none in market; second quality, 1851,\r\n     L180.  Nineteen fair to middling Wallachian girls offered at L130 @\r\n     150, but no takers; sixteen prime A 1 sold in small lots to close\r\n     out--terms private.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cSales of one lot Circassians, prime to good, 1852 to 1854, at L240\r\n     @ 242, buyer 30; one forty-niner--damaged--at L23, seller ten, no\r\n     deposit.  Several Georgians, fancy brands, 1852, changed hands to\r\n     fill orders.  The Georgians now on hand are mostly last year's crop,\r\n     which was unusually poor.  The new crop is a little backward, but\r\n     will be coming in shortly.  As regards its quantity and quality, the\r\n     accounts are most encouraging.  In this connection we can safely\r\n     say, also, that the new crop of Circassians is looking extremely\r\n     well.  His Majesty the Sultan has already sent in large orders for\r\n     his new harem, which will be finished within a fortnight, and this\r\n     has naturally strengthened the market and given Circassian stock a\r\n     strong upward tendency.  Taking advantage of the inflated market,\r\n     many of our shrewdest operators are selling short.  There are hints\r\n     of a 'corner' on Wallachians.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing new in Nubians.  Slow sale.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cEunuchs--None offering; however, large cargoes are expected from\r\n     Egypt today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nI think the above would be about the style of the commercial report.\r\nPrices are pretty high now, and holders firm; but, two or three years\r\nago, parents in a starving condition brought their young daughters down\r\nhere and sold them for even twenty and thirty dollars, when they could do\r\nno better, simply to save themselves and the girls from dying of want.\r\nIt is sad to think of so distressing a thing as this, and I for one am\r\nsincerely glad the prices are up again.\r\n\r\nCommercial morals, especially, are bad.  There is no gainsaying that.\r\nGreek, Turkish and Armenian morals consist only in attending church\r\nregularly on the appointed Sabbaths, and in breaking the ten commandments\r\nall the balance of the week.  It comes natural to them to lie and cheat\r\nin the first place, and then they go on and improve on nature until they\r\narrive at perfection.  In recommending his son to a merchant as a\r\nvaluable salesman, a father does not say he is a nice, moral, upright\r\nboy, and goes to Sunday School and is honest, but he says, \xe2\x80\x9cThis boy is\r\nworth his weight in broad pieces of a hundred--for behold, he will cheat\r\nwhomsoever hath dealings with him, and from the Euxine to the waters of\r\nMarmora there abideth not so gifted a liar!\xe2\x80\x9d  How is that for a\r\nrecommendation?  The Missionaries tell me that they hear encomiums like\r\nthat passed upon people every day.  They say of a person they admire,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, he is a charming swindler, and a most exquisite liar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery body lies and cheats--every body who is in business, at any rate.\r\nEven foreigners soon have to come down to the custom of the country, and\r\nthey do not buy and sell long in Constantinople till they lie and cheat\r\nlike a Greek.  I say like a Greek, because the Greeks are called the\r\nworst transgressors in this line.  Several Americans long resident in\r\nConstantinople contend that most Turks are pretty trustworthy, but few\r\nclaim that the Greeks have any virtues that a man can discover--at least\r\nwithout a fire assay.\r\n\r\nI am half willing to believe that the celebrated dogs of Constantinople\r\nhave been misrepresented--slandered.  I have always been led to suppose\r\nthat they were so thick in the streets that they blocked the way; that\r\nthey moved about in organized companies, platoons and regiments, and took\r\nwhat they wanted by determined and ferocious assault; and that at night\r\nthey drowned all other sounds with their terrible howlings.  The dogs I\r\nsee here can not be those I have read of.\r\n\r\nI find them every where, but not in strong force.  The most I have found\r\ntogether has been about ten or twenty.  And night or day a fair\r\nproportion of them were sound asleep.  Those that were not asleep always\r\nlooked as if they wanted to be.  I never saw such utterly wretched,\r\nstarving, sad-visaged, broken-hearted looking curs in my life.  It seemed\r\na grim satire to accuse such brutes as these of taking things by force of\r\narms.  They hardly seemed to have strength enough or ambition enough to\r\nwalk across the street--I do not know that I have seen one walk that far\r\nyet.  They are mangy and bruised and mutilated, and often you see one\r\nwith the hair singed off him in such wide and well defined tracts that he\r\nlooks like a map of the new Territories.  They are the sorriest beasts\r\nthat breathe--the most abject--the most pitiful.  In their faces is a\r\nsettled expression of melancholy, an air of hopeless despondency.  The\r\nhairless patches on a scalded dog are preferred by the fleas of\r\nConstantinople to a wider range on a healthier dog; and the exposed\r\nplaces suit the fleas exactly.  I saw a dog of this kind start to nibble\r\nat a flea--a fly attracted his attention, and he made a snatch at him;\r\nthe flea called for him once more, and that forever unsettled him; he\r\nlooked sadly at his flea-pasture, then sadly looked at his bald spot.\r\nThen he heaved a sigh and dropped his head resignedly upon his paws.  He\r\nwas not equal to the situation.\r\n\r\nThe dogs sleep in the streets, all over the city.  From one end of the\r\nstreet to the other, I suppose they will average about eight or ten to a\r\nblock.  Sometimes, of course, there are fifteen or twenty to a block.\r\nThey do not belong to any body, and they seem to have no close personal\r\nfriendships among each other.  But they district the city themselves, and\r\nthe dogs of each district, whether it be half a block in extent, or ten\r\nblocks, have to remain within its bounds.  Woe to a dog if he crosses the\r\nline!  His neighbors would snatch the balance of his hair off in a\r\nsecond.  So it is said.  But they don't look it.\r\n\r\nThey sleep in the streets these days.  They are my compass--my guide.\r\nWhen I see the dogs sleep placidly on, while men, sheep, geese, and all\r\nmoving things turn out and go around them, I know I am not in the great\r\nstreet where the hotel is, and must go further.  In the Grand Rue the\r\ndogs have a sort of air of being on the lookout--an air born of being\r\nobliged to get out of the way of many carriages every day--and that\r\nexpression one recognizes in a moment.  It does not exist upon the face\r\nof any dog without the confines of that street.  All others sleep\r\nplacidly and keep no watch.  They would not move, though the Sultan\r\nhimself passed by.\r\n\r\nIn one narrow street (but none of them are wide) I saw three dogs lying\r\ncoiled up, about a foot or two apart.  End to end they lay, and so they\r\njust bridged the street neatly, from gutter to gutter.  A drove of a\r\nhundred sheep came along.  They stepped right over the dogs, the rear\r\ncrowding the front, impatient to get on.  The dogs looked lazily up,\r\nflinched a little when the impatient feet of the sheep touched their raw\r\nbacks--sighed, and lay peacefully down again.  No talk could be plainer\r\nthan that.  So some of the sheep jumped over them and others scrambled\r\nbetween, occasionally chipping a leg with their sharp hoofs, and when the\r\nwhole flock had made the trip, the dogs sneezed a little, in the cloud of\r\ndust, but never budged their bodies an inch.  I thought I was lazy, but I\r\nam a steam-engine compared to a Constantinople dog.  But was not that a\r\nsingular scene for a city of a million inhabitants?\r\n\r\nThese dogs are the scavengers of the city.  That is their official\r\nposition, and a hard one it is.  However, it is their protection.  But\r\nfor their usefulness in partially cleansing these terrible streets, they\r\nwould not be tolerated long.  They eat any thing and every thing that\r\ncomes in their way, from melon rinds and spoiled grapes up through all\r\nthe grades and species of dirt and refuse to their own dead friends and\r\nrelatives--and yet they are always lean, always hungry, always\r\ndespondent.  The people are loath to kill them--do not kill them, in\r\nfact.  The Turks have an innate antipathy to taking the life of any dumb\r\nanimal, it is said.  But they do worse.  They hang and kick and stone and\r\nscald these wretched creatures to the very verge of death, and then leave\r\nthem to live and suffer.\r\n\r\nOnce a Sultan proposed to kill off all the dogs here, and did begin the\r\nwork--but the populace raised such a howl of horror about it that the\r\nmassacre was stayed.  After a while, he proposed to remove them all to an\r\nisland in the Sea of Marmora.  No objection was offered, and a ship-load\r\nor so was taken away.  But when it came to be known that somehow or other\r\nthe dogs never got to the island, but always fell overboard in the night\r\nand perished, another howl was raised and the transportation scheme was\r\ndropped.\r\n\r\nSo the dogs remain in peaceable possession of the streets.  I do not say\r\nthat they do not howl at night, nor that they do not attack people who\r\nhave not a red fez on their heads.  I only say that it would be mean for\r\nme to accuse them of these unseemly things who have not seen them do them\r\nwith my own eyes or heard them with my own ears.\r\n\r\nI was a little surprised to see Turks and Greeks playing newsboy right\r\nhere in the mysterious land where the giants and genii of the Arabian\r\nNights once dwelt--where winged horses and hydra-headed dragons guarded\r\nenchanted castles--where Princes and Princesses flew through the air on\r\ncarpets that obeyed a mystic talisman--where cities whose houses were\r\nmade of precious stones sprang up in a night under the hand of the\r\nmagician, and where busy marts were suddenly stricken with a spell and\r\neach citizen lay or sat, or stood with weapon raised or foot advanced,\r\njust as he was, speechless and motionless, till time had told a hundred\r\nyears!\r\n\r\nIt was curious to see newsboys selling papers in so dreamy a land as\r\nthat.  And, to say truly, it is comparatively a new thing here.  The\r\nselling of newspapers had its birth in Constantinople about a year ago,\r\nand was a child of the Prussian and Austrian war.\r\n\r\nThere is one paper published here in the English language--The Levant\r\nHerald--and there are generally a number of Greek and a few French papers\r\nrising and falling, struggling up and falling again.  Newspapers are not\r\npopular with the Sultan's Government.  They do not understand journalism.\r\nThe proverb says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe unknown is always great.\xe2\x80\x9d  To the court, the\r\nnewspaper is a mysterious and rascally institution.  They know what a\r\npestilence is, because they have one occasionally that thins the people\r\nout at the rate of two thousand a day, and they regard a newspaper as a\r\nmild form of pestilence.  When it goes astray, they suppress it--pounce\r\nupon it without warning, and throttle it.  When it don't go astray for a\r\nlong time, they get suspicious and throttle it anyhow, because they think\r\nit is hatching deviltry.  Imagine the Grand Vizier in solemn council with\r\nthe magnates of the realm, spelling his way through the hated newspaper,\r\nand finally delivering his profound decision: \xe2\x80\x9cThis thing means mischief\r\n--it is too darkly, too suspiciously inoffensive--suppress it!  Warn the\r\npublisher that we can not have this sort of thing: put the editor in\r\nprison!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe newspaper business has its inconveniences in Constantinople.  Two\r\nGreek papers and one French one were suppressed here within a few days of\r\neach other.  No victories of the Cretans are allowed to be printed.  From\r\ntime to time the Grand Vizier sends a notice to the various editors that\r\nthe Cretan insurrection is entirely suppressed, and although that editor\r\nknows better, he still has to print the notice.  The Levant Herald is too\r\nfond of speaking praisefully of Americans to be popular with the Sultan,\r\nwho does not relish our sympathy with the Cretans, and therefore that\r\npaper has to be particularly circumspect in order to keep out of trouble.\r\nOnce the editor, forgetting the official notice in his paper that the\r\nCretans were crushed out, printed a letter of a very different tenor,\r\nfrom the American Consul in Crete, and was fined two hundred and fifty\r\ndollars for it.  Shortly he printed another from the same source and was\r\nimprisoned three months for his pains.  I think I could get the assistant\r\neditorship of the Levant Herald, but I am going to try to worry along\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\nTo suppress a paper here involves the ruin of the publisher, almost.  But\r\nin Naples I think they speculate on misfortunes of that kind.  Papers are\r\nsuppressed there every day, and spring up the next day under a new name.\r\nDuring the ten days or a fortnight we staid there one paper was murdered\r\nand resurrected twice.  The newsboys are smart there, just as they are\r\nelsewhere.  They take advantage of popular weaknesses.  When they find\r\nthey are not likely to sell out, they approach a citizen mysteriously,\r\nand say in a low voice--\xe2\x80\x9cLast copy, sir: double price; paper just been\r\nsuppressed!\xe2\x80\x9d  The man buys it, of course, and finds nothing in it.  They\r\ndo say--I do not vouch for it--but they do say that men sometimes print a\r\nvast edition of a paper, with a ferociously seditious article in it,\r\ndistribute it quickly among the newsboys, and clear out till the\r\nGovernment's indignation cools.  It pays well.  Confiscation don't amount\r\nto any thing.  The type and presses are not worth taking care of.\r\n\r\nThere is only one English newspaper in Naples.  It has seventy\r\nsubscribers.  The publisher is getting rich very deliberately--very\r\ndeliberately indeed.\r\n\r\nI never shall want another Turkish lunch.  The cooking apparatus was in\r\nthe little lunch room, near the bazaar, and it was all open to the\r\nstreet.  The cook was slovenly, and so was the table, and it had no cloth\r\non it.  The fellow took a mass of sausage meat and coated it round a wire\r\nand laid it on a charcoal fire to cook.  When it was done, he laid it\r\naside and a dog walked sadly in and nipped it.  He smelt it first, and\r\nprobably recognized the remains of a friend.  The cook took it away from\r\nhim and laid it before us.  Jack said, \xe2\x80\x9cI pass\xe2\x80\x9d--he plays euchre\r\nsometimes--and we all passed in turn.  Then the cook baked a broad, flat,\r\nwheaten cake, greased it well with the sausage, and started towards us\r\nwith it.  It dropped in the dirt, and he picked it up and polished it on\r\nhis breeches, and laid it before us.  Jack said, \xe2\x80\x9cI pass.\xe2\x80\x9d  We all\r\npassed.  He put some eggs in a frying pan, and stood pensively prying\r\nslabs of meat from between his teeth with a fork.  Then he used the fork\r\nto turn the eggs with--and brought them along.  Jack said \xe2\x80\x9cPass again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n All followed suit.  We did not know what to do, and so we ordered a new\r\nration of sausage.  The cook got out his wire, apportioned a proper\r\namount of sausage-meat, spat it on his hands and fell to work!  This\r\ntime, with one accord, we all passed out.  We paid and left.  That is\r\nall I learned about Turkish lunches.  A Turkish lunch is good, no doubt,\r\nbut it has its little drawbacks.\r\n\r\nWhen I think how I have been swindled by books of Oriental travel, I want\r\na tourist for breakfast.  For years and years I have dreamed of the\r\nwonders of the Turkish bath; for years and years I have promised myself\r\nthat I would yet enjoy one.  Many and many a time, in fancy, I have lain\r\nin the marble bath, and breathed the slumbrous fragrance of Eastern\r\nspices that filled the air; then passed through a weird and complicated\r\nsystem of pulling and hauling, and drenching and scrubbing, by a gang of\r\nnaked savages who loomed vast and vaguely through the steaming mists,\r\nlike demons; then rested for a while on a divan fit for a king; then\r\npassed through another complex ordeal, and one more fearful than the\r\nfirst; and, finally, swathed in soft fabrics, been conveyed to a princely\r\nsaloon and laid on a bed of eider down, where eunuchs, gorgeous of\r\ncostume, fanned me while I drowsed and dreamed, or contentedly gazed at\r\nthe rich hangings of the apartment, the soft carpets, the sumptuous\r\nfurniture, the pictures, and drank delicious coffee, smoked the soothing\r\nnarghili, and dropped, at the last, into tranquil repose, lulled by\r\nsensuous odors from unseen censers, by the gentle influence of the\r\nnarghili's Persian tobacco, and by the music of fountains that\r\ncounterfeited the pattering of summer rain.\r\n\r\nThat was the picture, just as I got it from incendiary books of travel.\r\nIt was a poor, miserable imposture.  The reality is no more like it than\r\nthe Five Points are like the Garden of Eden.  They received me in a great\r\ncourt, paved with marble slabs; around it were broad galleries, one above\r\nanother, carpeted with seedy matting, railed with unpainted balustrades,\r\nand furnished with huge rickety chairs, cushioned with rusty old\r\nmattresses, indented with impressions left by the forms of nine\r\nsuccessive generations of men who had reposed upon them.  The place was\r\nvast, naked, dreary; its court a barn, its galleries stalls for human\r\nhorses.  The cadaverous, half nude varlets that served in the\r\nestablishment had nothing of poetry in their appearance, nothing of\r\nromance, nothing of Oriental splendor.  They shed no entrancing odors\r\n--just the contrary.  Their hungry eyes and their lank forms continually\r\nsuggested one glaring, unsentimental fact--they wanted what they term in\r\nCalifornia \xe2\x80\x9ca square meal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went into one of the racks and undressed.  An unclean starveling\r\nwrapped a gaudy table-cloth about his loins, and hung a white rag over my\r\nshoulders.  If I had had a tub then, it would have come natural to me to\r\ntake in washing.  I was then conducted down stairs into the wet, slippery\r\ncourt, and the first things that attracted my attention were my heels.\r\nMy fall excited no comment.  They expected it, no doubt.  It belonged in\r\nthe list of softening, sensuous influences peculiar to this home of\r\nEastern luxury.  It was softening enough, certainly, but its application\r\nwas not happy.  They now gave me a pair of wooden clogs--benches in\r\nminiature, with leather straps over them to confine my feet (which they\r\nwould have done, only I do not wear No. 13s.) These things dangled\r\nuncomfortably by the straps when I lifted up my feet, and came down in\r\nawkward and unexpected places when I put them on the floor again, and\r\nsometimes turned sideways and wrenched my ankles out of joint.  However,\r\nit was all Oriental luxury, and I did what I could to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThey put me in another part of the barn and laid me on a stuffy sort of\r\npallet, which was not made of cloth of gold, or Persian shawls, but was\r\nmerely the unpretending sort of thing I have seen in the negro quarters\r\nof Arkansas.  There was nothing whatever in this dim marble prison but\r\nfive more of these biers.  It was a very solemn place.  I expected that\r\nthe spiced odors of Araby were going to steal over my senses now, but\r\nthey did not.  A copper-colored skeleton, with a rag around him, brought\r\nme a glass decanter of water, with a lighted tobacco pipe in the top of\r\nit, and a pliant stem a yard long, with a brass mouth-piece to it.\r\n\r\nIt was the famous \xe2\x80\x9cnarghili\xe2\x80\x9d of the East--the thing the Grand Turk smokes\r\nin the pictures.  This began to look like luxury.  I took one blast at\r\nit, and it was sufficient; the smoke went in a great volume down into my\r\nstomach, my lungs, even into the uttermost parts of my frame.  I exploded\r\none mighty cough, and it was as if Vesuvius had let go.  For the next\r\nfive minutes I smoked at every pore, like a frame house that is on fire\r\non the inside.  Not any more narghili for me.  The smoke had a vile\r\ntaste, and the taste of a thousand infidel tongues that remained on that\r\nbrass mouthpiece was viler still.  I was getting discouraged.  Whenever,\r\nhereafter, I see the cross-legged Grand Turk smoking his narghili, in\r\npretended bliss, on the outside of a paper of Connecticut tobacco, I\r\nshall know him for the shameless humbug he is.\r\n\r\nThis prison was filled with hot air.  When I had got warmed up\r\nsufficiently to prepare me for a still warmer temperature, they took me\r\nwhere it was--into a marble room, wet, slippery and steamy, and laid me\r\nout on a raised platform in the centre.  It was very warm.  Presently my\r\nman sat me down by a tank of hot water, drenched me well, gloved his hand\r\nwith a coarse mitten, and began to polish me all over with it.  I began\r\nto smell disagreeably.  The more he polished the worse I smelt.  It was\r\nalarming.  I said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI perceive that I am pretty far gone.  It is plain that I ought to be\r\nburied without any unnecessary delay.  Perhaps you had better go after my\r\nfriends at once, because the weather is warm, and I can not 'keep' long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went on scrubbing, and paid no attention.  I soon saw that he was\r\nreducing my size.  He bore hard on his mitten, and from under it rolled\r\nlittle cylinders, like maccaroni.  It could not be dirt, for it was too\r\nwhite.  He pared me down in this way for a long time.  Finally I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a tedious process.  It will take hours to trim me to the size you\r\nwant me; I will wait; go and borrow a jack-plane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paid no attention at all.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he brought a basin, some soap, and something that seemed to\r\nbe the tail of a horse.  He made up a prodigious quantity of soap-suds,\r\ndeluged me with them from head to foot, without warning me to shut my\r\neyes, and then swabbed me viciously with the horse-tail.  Then he left me\r\nthere, a snowy statue of lather, and went away.  When I got tired of\r\nwaiting I went and hunted him up.  He was propped against the wall, in\r\nanother room, asleep.  I woke him.  He was not disconcerted.  He took me\r\nback and flooded me with hot water, then turbaned my head, swathed me\r\nwith dry table-cloths, and conducted me to a latticed chicken-coop in one\r\nof the galleries, and pointed to one of those Arkansas beds.  I mounted\r\nit, and vaguely expected the odors of Araby a gain.  They did not come.\r\n\r\nThe blank, unornamented coop had nothing about it of that oriental\r\nvoluptuousness one reads of so much.  It was more suggestive of the\r\ncounty hospital than any thing else.  The skinny servitor brought a\r\nnarghili, and I got him to take it out again without wasting any time\r\nabout it.  Then he brought the world-renowned Turkish coffee that poets\r\nhave sung so rapturously for many generations, and I seized upon it as\r\nthe last hope that was left of my old dreams of Eastern luxury.  It was\r\nanother fraud.  Of all the unchristian beverages that ever passed my\r\nlips, Turkish coffee is the worst.  The cup is small, it is smeared with\r\ngrounds; the coffee is black, thick, unsavory of smell, and execrable in\r\ntaste.  The bottom of the cup has a muddy sediment in it half an inch\r\ndeep.  This goes down your throat, and portions of it lodge by the way,\r\nand produce a tickling aggravation that keeps you barking and coughing\r\nfor an hour.\r\n\r\nHere endeth my experience of the celebrated Turkish bath, and here also\r\nendeth my dream of the bliss the mortal revels in who passes through it.\r\nIt is a malignant swindle.  The man who enjoys it is qualified to enjoy\r\nany thing that is repulsive to sight or sense, and he that can invest it\r\nwith a charm of poetry is able to do the same with any thing else in the\r\nworld that is tedious, and wretched, and dismal, and nasty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nWe left a dozen passengers in Constantinople, and sailed through the\r\nbeautiful Bosporus and far up into the Black Sea.  We left them in the\r\nclutches of the celebrated Turkish guide, \xe2\x80\x9cFAR-AWAY MOSES,\xe2\x80\x9d who will\r\nseduce them into buying a ship-load of ottar of roses, splendid Turkish\r\nvestments, and all manner of curious things they can never have any use\r\nfor.  Murray's invaluable guide-books have mentioned 'Far-away Moses'\r\nname, and he is a made man.  He rejoices daily in the fact that he is a\r\nrecognized celebrity.  However, we can not alter our established customs\r\nto please the whims of guides; we can not show partialities this late in\r\nthe day.  Therefore, ignoring this fellow's brilliant fame, and ignoring\r\nthe fanciful name he takes such pride in, we called him Ferguson, just as\r\nwe had done with all other guides.  It has kept him in a state of\r\nsmothered exasperation all the time.  Yet we meant him no harm.  After he\r\nhas gotten himself up regardless of expense, in showy, baggy trowsers,\r\nyellow, pointed slippers, fiery fez, silken jacket of blue, voluminous\r\nwaist-sash of fancy Persian stuff filled with a battery of silver-mounted\r\nhorse-pistols, and has strapped on his terrible scimitar, he considers it\r\nan unspeakable humiliation to be called Ferguson.  It can not be helped.\r\nAll guides are Fergusons to us.  We can not master their dreadful foreign\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nSebastopol is probably the worst battered town in Russia or any where\r\nelse.  But we ought to be pleased with it, nevertheless, for we have been\r\nin no country yet where we have been so kindly received, and where we\r\nfelt that to be Americans was a sufficient visa for our passports.  The\r\nmoment the anchor was down, the Governor of the town immediately\r\ndispatched an officer on board to inquire if he could be of any\r\nassistance to us, and to invite us to make ourselves at home in\r\nSebastopol!  If you know Russia, you know that this was a wild stretch of\r\nhospitality.  They are usually so suspicious of strangers that they worry\r\nthem excessively with the delays and aggravations incident to a\r\ncomplicated passport system.  Had we come from any other country we could\r\nnot have had permission to enter Sebastopol and leave again under three\r\ndays--but as it was, we were at liberty to go and come when and where we\r\npleased.  Every body in Constantinople warned us to be very careful about\r\nour passports, see that they were strictly 'en regle', and never to\r\nmislay them for a moment: and they told us of numerous instances of\r\nEnglishmen and others who were delayed days, weeks, and even months, in\r\nSebastopol, on account of trifling informalities in their passports, and\r\nfor which they were not to blame.  I had lost my passport, and was\r\ntraveling under my room-mate's, who stayed behind in Constantinople to\r\nawait our return.  To read the description of him in that passport and\r\nthen look at me, any man could see that I was no more like him than I am\r\nlike Hercules.  So I went into the harbor of Sebastopol with fear and\r\ntrembling--full of a vague, horrible apprehension that I was going to be\r\nfound out and hanged.  But all that time my true passport had been\r\nfloating gallantly overhead--and behold it was only our flag.  They never\r\nasked us for any other.\r\n\r\nWe have had a great many Russian and English gentlemen and ladies on\r\nboard to-day, and the time has passed cheerfully away.  They were all\r\nhappy-spirited people, and I never heard our mother tongue sound so\r\npleasantly as it did when it fell from those English lips in this far-off\r\nland.  I talked to the Russians a good deal, just to be friendly, and\r\nthey talked to me from the same motive; I am sure that both enjoyed the\r\nconversation, but never a word of it either of us understood.  I did most\r\nof my talking to those English people though, and I am sorry we can not\r\ncarry some of them along with us.\r\n\r\nWe have gone whithersoever we chose, to-day, and have met with nothing\r\nbut the kindest attentions.  Nobody inquired whether we had any passports\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the officers of the Government have suggested that we take the\r\nship to a little watering-place thirty miles from here, and pay the\r\nEmperor of Russia a visit.  He is rusticating there.  These officers said\r\nthey would take it upon themselves to insure us a cordial reception.\r\nThey said if we would go, they would not only telegraph the Emperor, but\r\nsend a special courier overland to announce our coming.  Our time is so\r\nshort, though, and more especially our coal is so nearly out, that we\r\njudged it best to forego the rare pleasure of holding social intercourse\r\nwith an Emperor.\r\n\r\nRuined Pompeii is in good condition compared to Sebastopol.  Here, you\r\nmay look in whatsoever direction you please, and your eye encounters\r\nscarcely any thing but ruin, ruin, ruin!--fragments of houses, crumbled\r\nwalls, torn and ragged hills, devastation every where!  It is as if a\r\nmighty earthquake had spent all its terrible forces upon this one little\r\nspot.  For eighteen long months the storms of war beat upon the helpless\r\ntown, and left it at last the saddest wreck that ever the sun has looked\r\nupon.  Not one solitary house escaped unscathed--not one remained\r\nhabitable, even.  Such utter and complete ruin one could hardly conceive\r\nof.  The houses had all been solid, dressed stone structures; most of\r\nthem were ploughed through and through by cannon balls--unroofed and\r\nsliced down from eaves to foundation--and now a row of them, half a mile\r\nlong, looks merely like an endless procession of battered chimneys.  No\r\nsemblance of a house remains in such as these.  Some of the larger\r\nbuildings had corners knocked off; pillars cut in two; cornices smashed;\r\nholes driven straight through the walls.  Many of these holes are as\r\nround and as cleanly cut as if they had been made with an auger.  Others\r\nare half pierced through, and the clean impression is there in the rock,\r\nas smooth and as shapely as if it were done in putty.  Here and there a\r\nball still sticks in a wall, and from it iron tears trickle down and\r\ndiscolor the stone.\r\n\r\nThe battle-fields were pretty close together.  The Malakoff tower is on\r\na hill which is right in the edge of the town.  The Redan was within\r\nrifle-shot of the Malakoff; Inkerman was a mile away; and Balaklava\r\nremoved but an hour's ride.  The French trenches, by which they\r\napproached and invested the Malakoff were carried so close under its\r\nsloping sides that one might have stood by the Russian guns and tossed a\r\nstone into them. Repeatedly, during three terrible days, they swarmed up\r\nthe little Malakoff hill, and were beaten back with terrible slaughter.\r\nFinally, they captured the place, and drove the Russians out, who then\r\ntried to retreat into the town, but the English had taken the Redan, and\r\nshut them off with a wall of flame; there was nothing for them to do but\r\ngo back and retake the Malakoff or die under its guns.  They did go\r\nback; they took the Malakoff and retook it two or three times, but their\r\ndesperate valor could not avail, and they had to give up at last.\r\n\r\nThese fearful fields, where such tempests of death used to rage, are\r\npeaceful enough now; no sound is heard, hardly a living thing moves about\r\nthem, they are lonely and silent--their desolation is complete.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing else to do, and so every body went to hunting relics.\r\nThey have stocked the ship with them.  They brought them from the\r\nMalakoff, from the Redan, Inkerman, Balaklava--every where.  They have\r\nbrought cannon balls, broken ramrods, fragments of shell--iron enough to\r\nfreight a sloop.  Some have even brought bones--brought them laboriously\r\nfrom great distances, and were grieved to hear the surgeon pronounce them\r\nonly bones of mules and oxen.  I knew Blucher would not lose an\r\nopportunity like this.  He brought a sack full on board and was going for\r\nanother.  I prevailed upon him not to go.  He has already turned his\r\nstate-room into a museum of worthless trumpery, which he has gathered up\r\nin his travels.  He is labeling his trophies, now.  I picked up one a\r\nwhile ago, and found it marked \xe2\x80\x9cFragment of a Russian General.\xe2\x80\x9d  I\r\ncarried it out to get a better light upon it--it was nothing but a couple\r\nof teeth and part of the jaw-bone of a horse.  I said with some asperity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFragment of a Russian General!  This is absurd.  Are you never going to\r\nlearn any sense?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe only said: \xe2\x80\x9cGo slow--the old woman won't know any different.\xe2\x80\x9d  [His\r\naunt.]\r\n\r\nThis person gathers mementoes with a perfect recklessness, now-a-days;\r\nmixes them all up together, and then serenely labels them without any\r\nregard to truth, propriety, or even plausibility.  I have found him\r\nbreaking a stone in two, and labeling half of it \xe2\x80\x9cChunk busted from the\r\npulpit of Demosthenes,\xe2\x80\x9d and the other half \xe2\x80\x9cDarnick from the Tomb of\r\nAbelard and Heloise.\xe2\x80\x9d  I have known him to gather up a handful of pebbles\r\nby the roadside, and bring them on board ship and label them as coming\r\nfrom twenty celebrated localities five hundred miles apart.  I\r\nremonstrate against these outrages upon reason and truth, of course, but\r\nit does no good.  I get the same tranquil, unanswerable reply every time:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt don't signify--the old woman won't know any different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEver since we three or four fortunate ones made the midnight trip to\r\nAthens, it has afforded him genuine satisfaction to give every body in\r\nthe ship a pebble from the Mars-hill where St. Paul preached.  He got all\r\nthose pebbles on the sea shore, abreast the ship, but professes to have\r\ngathered them from one of our party.  However, it is not of any use for\r\nme to expose the deception--it affords him pleasure, and does no harm to\r\nany body.  He says he never expects to run out of mementoes of St. Paul\r\nas long as he is in reach of a sand-bank.  Well, he is no worse than\r\nothers.  I notice that all travelers supply deficiencies in their\r\ncollections in the same way.  I shall never have any confidence in such\r\nthings again while I live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nWe have got so far east, now--a hundred and fifty-five degrees of\r\nlongitude from San Francisco--that my watch can not \xe2\x80\x9ckeep the hang\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nthe time any more.  It has grown discouraged, and stopped.  I think it\r\ndid a wise thing.  The difference in time between Sebastopol and the\r\nPacific coast is enormous.  When it is six o'clock in the morning here,\r\nit is somewhere about week before last in California.  We are excusable\r\nfor getting a little tangled as to time.  These distractions and\r\ndistresses about the time have worried me so much that I was afraid my\r\nmind was so much affected that I never would have any appreciation of\r\ntime again; but when I noticed how handy I was yet about comprehending\r\nwhen it was dinner-time, a blessed tranquillity settled down upon me, and\r\nI am tortured with doubts and fears no more.\r\n\r\nOdessa is about twenty hours' run from Sebastopol, and is the most\r\nnortherly port in the Black Sea.  We came here to get coal, principally.\r\nThe city has a population of one hundred and thirty-three thousand, and\r\nis growing faster than any other small city out of America.  It is a free\r\nport, and is the great grain mart of this particular part of the world.\r\nIts roadstead is full of ships.  Engineers are at work, now, turning the\r\nopen roadstead into a spacious artificial harbor.  It is to be almost\r\ninclosed by massive stone piers, one of which will extend into the sea\r\nover three thousand feet in a straight line.\r\n\r\nI have not felt so much at home for a long time as I did when I \xe2\x80\x9craised\r\nthe hill\xe2\x80\x9d and stood in Odessa for the first time.  It looked just like an\r\nAmerican city; fine, broad streets, and straight as well; low houses,\r\n(two or three stories,) wide, neat, and free from any quaintness of\r\narchitectural ornamentation; locust trees bordering the sidewalks (they\r\ncall them acacias;) a stirring, business-look about the streets and the\r\nstores; fast walkers; a familiar new look about the houses and every\r\nthing; yea, and a driving and smothering cloud of dust that was so like a\r\nmessage from our own dear native land that we could hardly refrain from\r\nshedding a few grateful tears and execrations in the old time-honored\r\nAmerican way.  Look up the street or down the street, this way or that\r\nway, we saw only America!  There was not one thing to remind us that we\r\nwere in Russia.  We walked for some little distance, reveling in this\r\nhome vision, and then we came upon a church and a hack-driver, and\r\npresto! the illusion vanished!  The church had a slender-spired dome that\r\nrounded inward at its base, and looked like a turnip turned upside down,\r\nand the hackman seemed to be dressed in a long petticoat with out any\r\nhoops.  These things were essentially foreign, and so were the carriages\r\n--but every body knows about these things, and there is no occasion for\r\nmy describing them.\r\n\r\nWe were only to stay here a day and a night and take in coal; we\r\nconsulted the guide-books and were rejoiced to know that there were no\r\nsights in Odessa to see; and so we had one good, untrammeled holyday on\r\nour hands, with nothing to do but idle about the city and enjoy\r\nourselves.  We sauntered through the markets and criticised the fearful\r\nand wonderful costumes from the back country; examined the populace as\r\nfar as eyes could do it; and closed the entertainment with an ice-cream\r\ndebauch.  We do not get ice-cream every where, and so, when we do, we are\r\napt to dissipate to excess.  We never cared any thing about ice-cream at\r\nhome, but we look upon it with a sort of idolatry now that it is so\r\nscarce in these red-hot climates of the East.\r\n\r\nWe only found two pieces of statuary, and this was another blessing.  One\r\nwas a bronze image of the Duc de Richelieu, grand-nephew of the splendid\r\nCardinal.  It stood in a spacious, handsome promenade, overlooking the\r\nsea, and from its base a vast flight of stone steps led down to the\r\nharbor--two hundred of them, fifty feet long, and a wide landing at the\r\nbottom of every twenty.  It is a noble staircase, and from a distance the\r\npeople toiling up it looked like insects.  I mention this statue and this\r\nstairway because they have their story.  Richelieu founded Odessa\r\n--watched over it with paternal care--labored with a fertile brain and a\r\nwise understanding for its best interests--spent his fortune freely to\r\nthe same end--endowed it with a sound prosperity, and one which will yet\r\nmake it one of the great cities of the Old World--built this noble\r\nstairway with money from his own private purse--and--.  Well, the people\r\nfor whom he had done so much, let him walk down these same steps, one\r\nday, unattended, old, poor, without a second coat to his back; and when,\r\nyears afterwards, he died in Sebastopol in poverty and neglect, they\r\ncalled a meeting, subscribed liberally, and immediately erected this\r\ntasteful monument to his memory, and named a great street after him.\r\nIt reminds me of what Robert Burns' mother said when they erected a\r\nstately monument to his memory: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Robbie, ye asked them for bread and\r\nthey hae gi'en ye a stane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe people of Odessa have warmly recommended us to go and call on the\r\nEmperor, as did the Sebastopolians.  They have telegraphed his Majesty,\r\nand he has signified his willingness to grant us an audience.  So we are\r\ngetting up the anchors and preparing to sail to his watering-place.  What\r\na scratching around there will be, now! what a holding of important\r\nmeetings and appointing of solemn committees!--and what a furbishing up\r\nof claw-hammer coats and white silk neck-ties!  As this fearful ordeal we\r\nare about to pass through pictures itself to my fancy in all its dread\r\nsublimity, I begin to feel my fierce desire to converse with a genuine\r\nEmperor cooling down and passing away.  What am I to do with my hands?\r\nWhat am I to do with my feet?  What in the world am I to do with myself?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nWe anchored here at Yalta, Russia, two or three days ago.  To me the\r\nplace was a vision of the Sierras.  The tall, gray mountains that back\r\nit, their sides bristling with pines--cloven with ravines--here and there\r\na hoary rock towering into view--long, straight streaks sweeping down\r\nfrom the summit to the sea, marking the passage of some avalanche of\r\nformer times--all these were as like what one sees in the Sierras as if\r\nthe one were a portrait of the other.  The little village of Yalta\r\nnestles at the foot of an amphitheatre which slopes backward and upward\r\nto the wall of hills, and looks as if it might have sunk quietly down to\r\nits present position from a higher elevation.  This depression is covered\r\nwith the great parks and gardens of noblemen, and through the mass of\r\ngreen foliage the bright colors of their palaces bud out here and there\r\nlike flowers.  It is a beautiful spot.\r\n\r\nWe had the United States Consul on board--the Odessa Consul.  We\r\nassembled in the cabin and commanded him to tell us what we must do to be\r\nsaved, and tell us quickly.  He made a speech.  The first thing he said\r\nfell like a blight on every hopeful spirit: he had never seen a court\r\nreception.  (Three groans for the Consul.)  But he said he had seen\r\nreceptions at the Governor General's in Odessa, and had often listened to\r\npeople's experiences of receptions at the Russian and other courts, and\r\nbelieved he knew very well what sort of ordeal we were about to essay.\r\n(Hope budded again.)  He said we were many; the summer palace was small\r\n--a mere mansion; doubtless we should be received in summer fashion--in the\r\ngarden; we would stand in a row, all the gentlemen in swallow-tail coats,\r\nwhite kids, and white neck-ties, and the ladies in light-colored silks,\r\nor something of that kind; at the proper moment--12 meridian--the\r\nEmperor, attended by his suite arrayed in splendid uniforms, would appear\r\nand walk slowly along the line, bowing to some, and saying two or three\r\nwords to others.  At the moment his Majesty appeared, a universal,\r\ndelighted, enthusiastic smile ought to break out like a rash among the\r\npassengers--a smile of love, of gratification, of admiration--and with\r\none accord, the party must begin to bow--not obsequiously, but\r\nrespectfully, and with dignity; at the end of fifteen minutes the Emperor\r\nwould go in the house, and we could run along home again.  We felt\r\nimmensely relieved.  It seemed, in a manner, easy.  There was not a man\r\nin the party but believed that with a little practice he could stand in a\r\nrow, especially if there were others along; there was not a man but\r\nbelieved he could bow without tripping on his coat tail and breaking his\r\nneck; in a word, we came to believe we were equal to any item in the\r\nperformance except that complicated smile.  The Consul also said we ought\r\nto draft a little address to the Emperor, and present it to one of his\r\naides-de-camp, who would forward it to him at the proper time.\r\nTherefore, five gentlemen were appointed to prepare the document, and the\r\nfifty others went sadly smiling about the ship--practicing.  During the\r\nnext twelve hours we had the general appearance, somehow, of being at a\r\nfuneral, where every body was sorry the death had occurred, but glad it\r\nwas over--where every body was smiling, and yet broken-hearted.\r\n\r\nA committee went ashore to wait on his Excellency the Governor-General,\r\nand learn our fate.  At the end of three hours of boding suspense, they\r\ncame back and said the Emperor would receive us at noon the next day\r\n--would send carriages for us--would hear the address in person.  The Grand\r\nDuke Michael had sent to invite us to his palace also.  Any man could see\r\nthat there was an intention here to show that Russia's friendship for\r\nAmerica was so genuine as to render even her private citizens objects\r\nworthy of kindly attentions.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed hour we drove out three miles, and assembled in the\r\nhandsome garden in front of the Emperor's palace.\r\n\r\nWe formed a circle under the trees before the door, for there was no one\r\nroom in the house able to accommodate our three-score persons\r\ncomfortably, and in a few minutes the imperial family came out bowing and\r\nsmiling, and stood in our midst.  A number of great dignitaries of the\r\nEmpire, in undress unit forms, came with them.  With every bow, his\r\nMajesty said a word of welcome.  I copy these speeches.  There is\r\ncharacter in them--Russian character--which is politeness itself, and the\r\ngenuine article.  The French are polite, but it is often mere ceremonious\r\npoliteness.  A Russian imbues his polite things with a heartiness, both\r\nof phrase and expression, that compels belief in their sincerity.  As I\r\nwas saying, the Czar punctuated his speeches with bows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning--I am glad to see you--I am gratified--I am delighted--I am\r\nhappy to receive you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll took off their hats, and the Consul inflicted the address on him.  He\r\nbore it with unflinching fortitude; then took the rusty-looking document\r\nand handed it to some great officer or other, to be filed away among the\r\narchives of Russia--in the stove.  He thanked us for the address, and\r\nsaid he was very much pleased to see us, especially as such friendly\r\nrelations existed between Russia and the United States.  The Empress said\r\nthe Americans were favorites in Russia, and she hoped the Russians were\r\nsimilarly regarded in America.  These were all the speeches that were\r\nmade, and I recommend them to parties who present policemen with gold\r\nwatches, as models of brevity and point.  After this the Empress went and\r\ntalked sociably (for an Empress) with various ladies around the circle;\r\nseveral gentlemen entered into a disjointed general conversation with the\r\nEmperor; the Dukes and Princes, Admirals and Maids of Honor dropped into\r\nfree-and-easy chat with first one and then another of our party, and\r\nwhoever chose stepped forward and spoke with the modest little Grand\r\nDuchess Marie, the Czar's daughter.  She is fourteen years old,\r\nlight-haired, blue-eyed, unassuming and pretty.  Every body talks\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor wore a cap, frock coat and pantaloons, all of some kind of\r\nplain white drilling--cotton or linen and sported no jewelry or any\r\ninsignia whatever of rank.  No costume could be less ostentatious.  He is\r\nvery tall and spare, and a determined-looking man, though a very\r\npleasant-looking one nevertheless.  It is easy to see that he is kind and\r\naffectionate There is something very noble in his expression when his cap\r\nis off.  There is none of that cunning in his eye that all of us noticed\r\nin Louis Napoleon's.\r\n\r\nThe Empress and the little Grand Duchess wore simple suits of foulard\r\n(or foulard silk, I don't know which is proper,) with a small blue spot\r\nin it; the dresses were trimmed with blue; both ladies wore broad blue\r\nsashes about their waists; linen collars and clerical ties of muslin;\r\nlow-crowned straw-hats trimmed with blue velvet; parasols and\r\nflesh-colored gloves.  The Grand Duchess had no heels on her shoes.  I\r\ndo not know this of my own knowledge, but one of our ladies told me so.\r\nI was not looking at her shoes.  I was glad to observe that she wore her\r\nown hair, plaited in thick braids against the back of her head, instead\r\nof the uncomely thing they call a waterfall, which is about as much like\r\na waterfall as a canvas-covered ham is like a cataract.  Taking the kind\r\nexpression that is in the Emperor's face and the gentleness that is in\r\nhis young daughter's into consideration, I wondered if it would not tax\r\nthe Czar's firmness to the utmost to condemn a supplicating wretch to\r\nmisery in the wastes of Siberia if she pleaded for him.  Every time\r\ntheir eyes met, I saw more and more what a tremendous power that weak,\r\ndiffident school-girl could wield if she chose to do it.  Many and many\r\na time she might rule the Autocrat of Russia, whose lightest word is law\r\nto seventy millions of human beings!  She was only a girl, and she\r\nlooked like a thousand others I have seen, but never a girl provoked\r\nsuch a novel and peculiar interest in me before.  A strange, new\r\nsensation is a rare thing in this hum-drum life, and I had it here.\r\nThere was nothing stale or worn out about the thoughts and feelings the\r\nsituation and the circumstances created.  It seemed strange--stranger\r\nthan I can tell--to think that the central figure in the cluster of men\r\nand women, chatting here under the trees like the most ordinary\r\nindividual in the land, was a man who could open his lips and ships\r\nwould fly through the waves, locomotives would speed over the plains,\r\ncouriers would hurry from village to village, a hundred telegraphs would\r\nflash the word to the four corners of an Empire that stretches its vast\r\nproportions over a seventh part of the habitable globe, and a countless\r\nmultitude of men would spring to do his bidding.  I had a sort of vague\r\ndesire to examine his hands and see if they were of flesh and blood,\r\nlike other men's.  Here was a man who could do this wonderful thing, and\r\nyet if I chose I could knock him down.  The case was plain, but it\r\nseemed preposterous, nevertheless--as preposterous as trying to knock\r\ndown a mountain or wipe out a continent.  If this man sprained his\r\nankle, a million miles of telegraph would carry the news over mountains\r\n--valleys--uninhabited deserts--under the trackless sea--and ten thousand\r\nnewspapers would prate of it; if he were grievously ill, all the nations\r\nwould know it before the sun rose again; if he dropped lifeless where he\r\nstood, his fall might shake the thrones of half a world!  If I could\r\nhave stolen his coat, I would have done it.  When I meet a man like\r\nthat, I want something to remember him by.\r\n\r\nAs a general thing, we have been shown through palaces by some\r\nplush-legged filagreed flunkey or other, who charged a franc for it; but\r\nafter talking with the company half an hour, the Emperor of Russia and\r\nhis family conducted us all through their mansion themselves.  They made\r\nno charge.  They seemed to take a real pleasure in it.\r\n\r\nWe spent half an hour idling through the palace, admiring the cosy\r\napartments and the rich but eminently home-like appointments of the\r\nplace, and then the Imperial family bade our party a kind good-bye, and\r\nproceeded to count the spoons.\r\n\r\nAn invitation was extended to us to visit the palace of the eldest son,\r\nthe Crown Prince of Russia, which was near at hand.  The young man was\r\nabsent, but the Dukes and Countesses and Princes went over the premises\r\nwith us as leisurely as was the case at the Emperor's, and conversation\r\ncontinued as lively as ever.\r\n\r\nIt was a little after one o'clock, now.  We drove to the Grand Duke\r\nMichael's, a mile away, in response to his invitation, previously given.\r\n\r\nWe arrived in twenty minutes from the Emperor's.  It is a lovely place.\r\nThe beautiful palace nestles among the grand old groves of the park, the\r\npark sits in the lap of the picturesque crags and hills, and both look\r\nout upon the breezy ocean.  In the park are rustic seats, here and there,\r\nin secluded nooks that are dark with shade; there are rivulets of crystal\r\nwater; there are lakelets, with inviting, grassy banks; there are\r\nglimpses of sparkling cascades through openings in the wilderness of\r\nfoliage; there are streams of clear water gushing from mimic knots on the\r\ntrunks of forest trees; there are miniature marble temples perched upon\r\ngray old crags; there are airy lookouts whence one may gaze upon a broad\r\nexpanse of landscape and ocean.  The palace is modeled after the choicest\r\nforms of Grecian architecture, and its wide colonnades surround a central\r\ncourt that is banked with rare flowers that fill the place with their\r\nfragrance, and in their midst springs a fountain that cools the summer\r\nair, and may possibly breed mosquitoes, but I do not think it does.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke and his Duchess came out, and the presentation ceremonies\r\nwere as simple as they had been at the Emperor's.  In a few minutes,\r\nconversation was under way, as before.  The Empress appeared in the\r\nverandah, and the little Grand Duchess came out into the crowd.  They had\r\nbeaten us there.  In a few minutes, the Emperor came himself on\r\nhorseback.  It was very pleasant.  You can appreciate it if you have ever\r\nvisited royalty and felt occasionally that possibly you might be wearing\r\nout your welcome--though as a general thing, I believe, royalty is not\r\nscrupulous about discharging you when it is done with you.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke is the third brother of the Emperor, is about thirty-seven\r\nyears old, perhaps, and is the princeliest figure in Russia.  He is even\r\ntaller than the Czar, as straight as an Indian, and bears himself like\r\none of those gorgeous knights we read about in romances of the Crusades.\r\nHe looks like a great-hearted fellow who would pitch an enemy into the\r\nriver in a moment, and then jump in and risk his life fishing him out\r\nagain.  The stories they tell of him show him to be of a brave and\r\ngenerous nature.  He must have been desirous of proving that Americans\r\nwere welcome guests in the imperial palaces of Russia, because he rode\r\nall the way to Yalta and escorted our procession to the Emperor's\r\nhimself, and kept his aids scurrying about, clearing the road and\r\noffering assistance wherever it could be needed.  We were rather familiar\r\nwith him then, because we did not know who he was.  We recognized him\r\nnow, and appreciated the friendly spirit that prompted him to do us a\r\nfavor that any other Grand Duke in the world would have doubtless\r\ndeclined to do.  He had plenty of servitors whom he could have sent, but\r\nhe chose to attend to the matter himself.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke was dressed in the handsome and showy uniform of a Cossack\r\nofficer.  The Grand Duchess had on a white alpaca robe, with the seams\r\nand gores trimmed with black barb lace, and a little gray hat with a\r\nfeather of the same color.  She is young, rather pretty modest and\r\nunpretending, and full of winning politeness.\r\n\r\nOur party walked all through the house, and then the nobility escorted\r\nthem all over the grounds, and finally brought them back to the palace\r\nabout half-past two o'clock to breakfast.  They called it breakfast, but\r\nwe would have called it luncheon.  It consisted of two kinds of wine;\r\ntea, bread, cheese, and cold meats, and was served on the centre-tables\r\nin the reception room and the verandahs--anywhere that was convenient;\r\nthere was no ceremony.  It was a sort of picnic.  I had heard before that\r\nwe were to breakfast there, but Blucher said he believed Baker's boy had\r\nsuggested it to his Imperial Highness.  I think not--though it would be\r\nlike him.  Baker's boy is the famine-breeder of the ship.  He is always\r\nhungry.  They say he goes about the state-rooms when the passengers are\r\nout, and eats up all the soap.  And they say he eats oakum.  They say he\r\nwill eat any thing he can get between meals, but he prefers oakum.  He\r\ndoes not like oakum for dinner, but he likes it for a lunch, at odd\r\nhours, or any thing that way.  It makes him very disagreeable, because it\r\nmakes his breath bad, and keeps his teeth all stuck up with tar.  Baker's\r\nboy may have suggested the breakfast, but I hope he did not.  It went off\r\nwell, anyhow.  The illustrious host moved about from place to place, and\r\nhelped to destroy the provisions and keep the conversation lively, and\r\nthe Grand Duchess talked with the verandah parties and such as had\r\nsatisfied their appetites and straggled out from the reception room.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke's tea was delicious.  They give one a lemon to squeeze\r\ninto it, or iced milk, if he prefers it.  The former is best.  This tea\r\nis brought overland from China.  It injures the article to transport it\r\nby sea.\r\n\r\nWhen it was time to go, we bade our distinguished hosts good-bye, and\r\nthey retired happy and contented to their apartments to count their\r\nspoons.\r\n\r\nWe had spent the best part of half a day in the home of royalty, and had\r\nbeen as cheerful and comfortable all the time as we could have been in\r\nthe ship.  I would as soon have thought of being cheerful in Abraham's\r\nbosom as in the palace of an Emperor.  I supposed that Emperors were\r\nterrible people.  I thought they never did any thing but wear magnificent\r\ncrowns and red velvet dressing-gowns with dabs of wool sewed on them in\r\nspots, and sit on thrones and scowl at the flunkies and the people in the\r\nparquette, and order Dukes and Duchesses off to execution.  I find,\r\nhowever, that when one is so fortunate as to get behind the scenes and\r\nsee them at home and in the privacy of their firesides, they are\r\nstrangely like common mortals.  They are pleasanter to look upon then\r\nthan they are in their theatrical aspect.  It seems to come as natural to\r\nthem to dress and act like other people as it is to put a friend's cedar\r\npencil in your pocket when you are done using it.  But I can never have\r\nany confidence in the tinsel kings of the theatre after this.  It will be\r\na great loss.  I used to take such a thrilling pleasure in them.  But,\r\nhereafter, I will turn me sadly away and say;\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis does not answer--this isn't the style of king that I am acquainted\r\nwith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they swagger around the stage in jeweled crowns and splendid robes,\r\nI shall feel bound to observe that all the Emperors that ever I was\r\npersonally acquainted with wore the commonest sort of clothes, and did\r\nnot swagger.  And when they come on the stage attended by a vast\r\nbody-guard of supes in helmets and tin breastplates, it will be my duty\r\nas well as my pleasure to inform the ignorant that no crowned head of my\r\nacquaintance has a soldier any where about his house or his person.\r\n\r\nPossibly it may be thought that our party tarried too long, or did other\r\nimproper things, but such was not the case.  The company felt that they\r\nwere occupying an unusually responsible position--they were representing\r\nthe people of America, not the Government--and therefore they were\r\ncareful to do their best to perform their high mission with credit.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Imperial families, no doubt, considered that in\r\nentertaining us they were more especially entertaining the people of\r\nAmerica than they could by showering attentions on a whole platoon of\r\nministers plenipotentiary and therefore they gave to the event its\r\nfullest significance, as an expression of good will and friendly feeling\r\ntoward the entire country.  We took the kindnesses we received as\r\nattentions thus directed, of course, and not to ourselves as a party.\r\nThat we felt a personal pride in being received as the representatives of\r\na nation, we do not deny; that we felt a national pride in the warm\r\ncordiality of that reception, can not be doubted.\r\n\r\nOur poet has been rigidly suppressed, from the time we let go the anchor.\r\nWhen it was announced that we were going to visit the Emperor of Russia,\r\nthe fountains of his great deep were broken up, and he rained ineffable\r\nbosh for four-and-twenty hours.  Our original anxiety as to what we were\r\ngoing to do with ourselves, was suddenly transformed into anxiety about\r\nwhat we were going to do with our poet.  The problem was solved at last.\r\nTwo alternatives were offered him--he must either swear a dreadful oath\r\nthat he would not issue a line of his poetry while he was in the Czar's\r\ndominions, or else remain under guard on board the ship until we were\r\nsafe at Constantinople again.  He fought the dilemma long, but yielded at\r\nlast.  It was a great deliverance.  Perhaps the savage reader would like\r\na specimen of his style.  I do not mean this term to be offensive.  I\r\nonly use it because \xe2\x80\x9cthe gentle reader\xe2\x80\x9d has been used so often that any\r\nchange from it can not but be refreshing:\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cSave us and sanctify us, and finally, then,\r\n          See good provisions we enjoy while we journey to Jerusalem.\r\n          For so man proposes, which it is most true\r\n          And time will wait for none, nor for us too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sea has been unusually rough all day.  However, we have had a\r\nlively time of it, anyhow.  We have had quite a run of visitors.  The\r\nGovernor-General came, and we received him with a salute of nine guns.\r\nHe brought his family with him.  I observed that carpets were spread\r\nfrom the pier-head to his carriage for him to walk on, though I have\r\nseen him walk there without any carpet when he was not on business.  I\r\nthought may be he had what the accidental insurance people might call an\r\nextra-hazardous polish (\xe2\x80\x9cpolicy\xe2\x80\x9d joke, but not above mediocrity,) on his\r\nboots, and wished to protect them, but I examined and could not see that\r\nthey were blacked any better than usual.  It may have been that he had\r\nforgotten his carpet, before, but he did not have it with him, anyhow.\r\nHe was an exceedingly pleasant old gentleman; we all liked him,\r\nespecially Blucher. When he went away, Blucher invited him to come\r\nagain and fetch his carpet along.\r\n\r\nPrince Dolgorouki and a Grand Admiral or two, whom we had seen yesterday\r\nat the reception, came on board also.  I was a little distant with these\r\nparties, at first, because when I have been visiting Emperors I do not\r\nlike to be too familiar with people I only know by reputation, and whose\r\nmoral characters and standing in society I can not be thoroughly\r\nacquainted with.  I judged it best to be a little offish, at first.  I\r\nsaid to myself, Princes and Counts and Grand Admirals are very well, but\r\nthey are not Emperors, and one can not be too particular about who he\r\nassociates with.\r\n\r\nBaron Wrangel came, also.  He used to be Russian Ambassador at\r\nWashington.  I told him I had an uncle who fell down a shaft and broke\r\nhimself in two, as much as a year before that.  That was a falsehood, but\r\nthen I was not going to let any man eclipse me on surprising adventures,\r\nmerely for the want of a little invention.  The Baron is a fine man, and\r\nis said to stand high in the Emperor's confidence and esteem.\r\n\r\nBaron Ungern-Sternberg, a boisterous, whole-souled old nobleman, came\r\nwith the rest.  He is a man of progress and enterprise--a representative\r\nman of the age.  He is the Chief Director of the railway system of\r\nRussia--a sort of railroad king.  In his line he is making things move\r\nalong in this country He has traveled extensively in America.  He says he\r\nhas tried convict labor on his railroads, and with perfect success.  He\r\nsays the convicts work well, and are quiet and peaceable.  He observed\r\nthat he employs nearly ten thousand of them now.\r\n\r\nThis appeared to be another call on my resources.  I was equal to the\r\nemergency.  I said we had eighty thousand convicts employed on the\r\nrailways in America--all of them under sentence of death for murder in\r\nthe first degree.  That closed him out.\r\n\r\nWe had General Todtleben (the famous defender of Sebastopol, during the\r\nsiege,) and many inferior army and also navy officers, and a number of\r\nunofficial Russian ladies and gentlemen.  Naturally, a champagne luncheon\r\nwas in order, and was accomplished without loss of life.  Toasts and\r\njokes were discharged freely, but no speeches were made save one thanking\r\nthe Emperor and the Grand Duke, through the Governor-General, for our\r\nhospitable reception, and one by the Governor-General in reply, in which\r\nhe returned the Emperor's thanks for the speech, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Constantinople, and after a day or two spent in exhausting\r\nmarches about the city and voyages up the Golden Horn in caiques, we\r\nsteamed away again.  We passed through the Sea of Marmora and the\r\nDardanelles, and steered for a new land--a new one to us, at least--Asia.\r\nWe had as yet only acquired a bowing acquaintance with it, through\r\npleasure excursions to Scutari and the regions round about.\r\n\r\nWe passed between Lemnos and Mytilene, and saw them as we had seen Elba\r\nand the Balearic Isles--mere bulky shapes, with the softening mists of\r\ndistance upon them--whales in a fog, as it were.  Then we held our course\r\nsouthward, and began to \xe2\x80\x9cread up\xe2\x80\x9d celebrated Smyrna.\r\n\r\nAt all hours of the day and night the sailors in the forecastle amused\r\nthemselves and aggravated us by burlesquing our visit to royalty.  The\r\nopening paragraph of our Address to the Emperor was framed as follows:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWe are a handful of private citizens of America, traveling simply\r\n     for recreation--and unostentatiously, as becomes our unofficial\r\n     state--and, therefore, we have no excuse to tender for presenting\r\n     ourselves before your Majesty, save the desire of offering our\r\n     grateful acknowledgments to the lord of a realm, which, through good\r\n     and through evil report, has been the steadfast friend of the land\r\n     we love so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe third cook, crowned with a resplendent tin basin and wrapped royally\r\nin a table-cloth mottled with grease-spots and coffee stains, and bearing\r\na sceptre that looked strangely like a belaying-pin, walked upon a\r\ndilapidated carpet and perched himself on the capstan, careless of the\r\nflying spray; his tarred and weather-beaten Chamberlains, Dukes and Lord\r\nHigh Admirals surrounded him, arrayed in all the pomp that spare\r\ntarpaulins and remnants of old sails could furnish.  Then the visiting\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwatch below,\xe2\x80\x9d transformed into graceless ladies and uncouth pilgrims, by\r\nrude travesties upon waterfalls, hoopskirts, white kid gloves and\r\nswallow-tail coats, moved solemnly up the companion way, and bowing low,\r\nbegan a system of complicated and extraordinary smiling which few\r\nmonarchs could look upon and live.  Then the mock consul, a\r\nslush-plastered deck-sweep, drew out a soiled fragment of paper and\r\nproceeded to read, laboriously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo His Imperial Majesty, Alexander II., Emperor of Russia:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are a handful of private citizens of America, traveling simply for\r\nrecreation,--and unostentatiously, as becomes our unofficial state--and\r\ntherefore, we have no excuse to tender for presenting ourselves before\r\nyour Majesty--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Emperor--\xe2\x80\x9cThen what the devil did you come for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n--\xe2\x80\x9cSave the desire of offering our grateful acknowledgments to the lord\r\nof a realm which--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Emperor--\xe2\x80\x9cOh, d--n the Address!--read it to the police.\r\nChamberlain, take these people over to my brother, the Grand Duke's, and\r\ngive them a square meal.  Adieu!  I am happy--I am gratified--I am\r\ndelighted--I am bored.  Adieu, adieu--vamos the ranch!  The First Groom\r\nof the Palace will proceed to count the portable articles of value\r\nbelonging to the premises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe farce then closed, to be repeated again with every change of the\r\nwatches, and embellished with new and still more extravagant inventions\r\nof pomp and conversation.\r\n\r\nAt all times of the day and night the phraseology of that tiresome\r\naddress fell upon our ears.  Grimy sailors came down out of the foretop\r\nplacidly announcing themselves as \xe2\x80\x9ca handful of private citizens of\r\nAmerica, traveling simply for recreation and unostentatiously,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.; the\r\ncoal passers moved to their duties in the profound depths of the ship,\r\nexplaining the blackness of their faces and their uncouthness of dress,\r\nwith the reminder that they were \xe2\x80\x9ca handful of private citizens,\r\ntraveling simply for recreation,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., and when the cry rang through the\r\nvessel at midnight: \xe2\x80\x9cEIGHT BELLS!--LARBOARD WATCH, TURN OUT!\xe2\x80\x9d  the\r\nlarboard watch came gaping and stretching out of their den, with the\r\neverlasting formula: \xe2\x80\x9cAye-aye, sir!  We are a handful of private citizens\r\nof America, traveling simply for recreation, and unostentatiously, as\r\nbecomes our unofficial state!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I was a member of the committee, and helped to frame the Address,\r\nthese sarcasms came home to me.  I never heard a sailor proclaiming\r\nhimself as a handful of American citizens traveling for recreation, but I\r\nwished he might trip and fall overboard, and so reduce his handful by one\r\nindividual, at least.  I never was so tired of any one phrase as the\r\nsailors made me of the opening sentence of the Address to the Emperor of\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nThis seaport of Smyrna, our first notable acquaintance in Asia, is a\r\nclosely packed city of one hundred and thirty thousand inhabitants, and,\r\nlike Constantinople, it has no outskirts.  It is as closely packed at its\r\nouter edges as it is in the centre, and then the habitations leave\r\nsuddenly off and the plain beyond seems houseless.  It is just like any\r\nother Oriental city.  That is to say, its Moslem houses are heavy and\r\ndark, and as comfortless as so many tombs; its streets are crooked,\r\nrudely and roughly paved, and as narrow as an ordinary staircase; the\r\nstreets uniformly carry a man to any other place than the one he wants to\r\ngo to, and surprise him by landing him in the most unexpected localities;\r\nbusiness is chiefly carried on in great covered bazaars, celled like a\r\nhoneycomb with innumerable shops no larger than a common closet, and the\r\nwhole hive cut up into a maze of alleys about wide enough to accommodate\r\na laden camel, and well calculated to confuse a stranger and eventually\r\nlose him; every where there is dirt, every where there are fleas, every\r\nwhere there are lean, broken-hearted dogs; every alley is thronged with\r\npeople; wherever you look, your eye rests upon a wild masquerade of\r\nextravagant costumes; the workshops are all open to the streets, and the\r\nworkmen visible; all manner of sounds assail the ear, and over them all\r\nrings out the muezzin's cry from some tall minaret, calling the faithful\r\nvagabonds to prayer; and superior to the call to prayer, the noises in\r\nthe streets, the interest of the costumes--superior to every thing, and\r\nclaiming the bulk of attention first, last, and all the time--is a\r\ncombination of Mohammedan stenches, to which the smell of even a Chinese\r\nquarter would be as pleasant as the roasting odors of the fatted calf to\r\nthe nostrils of the returning Prodigal.  Such is Oriental luxury--such is\r\nOriental splendor!  We read about it all our days, but we comprehend it\r\nnot until we see it.  Smyrna is a very old city.  Its name occurs several\r\ntimes in the Bible, one or two of the disciples of Christ visited it, and\r\nhere was located one of the original seven apocalyptic churches spoken of\r\nin Revelations.  These churches were symbolized in the Scriptures as\r\ncandlesticks, and on certain conditions there was a sort of implied\r\npromise that Smyrna should be endowed with a \xe2\x80\x9ccrown of life.\xe2\x80\x9d  She was to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbe faithful unto death\xe2\x80\x9d--those were the terms.  She has not kept up her\r\nfaith straight along, but the pilgrims that wander hither consider that\r\nshe has come near enough to it to save her, and so they point to the fact\r\nthat Smyrna to-day wears her crown of life, and is a great city, with a\r\ngreat commerce and full of energy, while the cities wherein were located\r\nthe other six churches, and to which no crown of life was promised, have\r\nvanished from the earth.  So Smyrna really still possesses her crown of\r\nlife, in a business point of view.  Her career, for eighteen centuries,\r\nhas been a chequered one, and she has been under the rule of princes of\r\nmany creeds, yet there has been no season during all that time, as far as\r\nwe know, (and during such seasons as she was inhabited at all,) that she\r\nhas been without her little community of Christians \xe2\x80\x9cfaithful unto\r\ndeath.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hers was the only church against which no threats were implied\r\nin the Revelations, and the only one which survived.\r\n\r\nWith Ephesus, forty miles from here, where was located another of the\r\nseven churches, the case was different.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccandlestick\xe2\x80\x9d has been\r\nremoved from Ephesus.  Her light has been put out.  Pilgrims, always\r\nprone to find prophecies in the Bible, and often where none exist, speak\r\ncheerfully and complacently of poor, ruined Ephesus as the victim of\r\nprophecy.  And yet there is no sentence that promises, without due\r\nqualification, the destruction of the city.  The words are:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cRemember, therefore, from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and\r\n     do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will\r\n     remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat is all; the other verses are singularly complimentary to Ephesus.\r\nThe threat is qualified.  There is no history to show that she did not\r\nrepent.  But the cruelest habit the modern prophecy-savans have, is that\r\none of coolly and arbitrarily fitting the prophetic shirt on to the wrong\r\nman.  They do it without regard to rhyme or reason.  Both the cases I\r\nhave just mentioned are instances in point.  Those \xe2\x80\x9cprophecies\xe2\x80\x9d are\r\ndistinctly leveled at the \xe2\x80\x9cchurches of Ephesus, Smyrna,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., and yet\r\nthe pilgrims invariably make them refer to the cities instead.  No crown\r\nof life is promised to the town of Smyrna and its commerce, but to the\r\nhandful of Christians who formed its \xe2\x80\x9cchurch.\xe2\x80\x9d  If they were \xe2\x80\x9cfaithful\r\nunto death,\xe2\x80\x9d they have their crown now--but no amount of faithfulness and\r\nlegal shrewdness combined could legitimately drag the city into a\r\nparticipation in the promises of the prophecy.  The stately language of\r\nthe Bible refers to a crown of life whose lustre will reflect the\r\nday-beams of the endless ages of eternity, not the butterfly existence\r\nof a city built by men's hands, which must pass to dust with the\r\nbuilders and be forgotten even in the mere handful of centuries\r\nvouchsafed to the solid world itself between its cradle and its grave.\r\n\r\nThe fashion of delving out fulfillments of prophecy where that prophecy\r\nconsists of mere \xe2\x80\x9cifs,\xe2\x80\x9d trenches upon the absurd.  Suppose, a thousand\r\nyears from now, a malarious swamp builds itself up in the shallow harbor\r\nof Smyrna, or something else kills the town; and suppose, also, that\r\nwithin that time the swamp that has filled the renowned harbor of Ephesus\r\nand rendered her ancient site deadly and uninhabitable to-day, becomes\r\nhard and healthy ground; suppose the natural consequence ensues, to wit:\r\nthat Smyrna becomes a melancholy ruin, and Ephesus is rebuilt.  What\r\nwould the prophecy-savans say?  They would coolly skip over our age of\r\nthe world, and say: \xe2\x80\x9cSmyrna was not faithful unto death, and so her crown\r\nof life was denied her; Ephesus repented, and lo! her candle-stick was\r\nnot removed.  Behold these evidences!  How wonderful is prophecy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSmyrna has been utterly destroyed six times.  If her crown of life had\r\nbeen an insurance policy, she would have had an opportunity to collect on\r\nit the first time she fell.  But she holds it on sufferance and by a\r\ncomplimentary construction of language which does not refer to\r\nher.  Six different times, however, I suppose some infatuated\r\nprophecy-enthusiast blundered along and said, to the infinite disgust of\r\nSmyrna and the Smyrniotes: \xe2\x80\x9cIn sooth, here is astounding fulfillment of\r\nprophecy!  Smyrna hath not been faithful unto death, and behold her\r\ncrown of life is vanished from her head.  Verily, these things be\r\nastonishing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch things have a bad influence.  They provoke worldly men into using\r\nlight conversation concerning sacred subjects.  Thick-headed commentators\r\nupon the Bible, and stupid preachers and teachers, work more damage to\r\nreligion than sensible, cool-brained clergymen can fight away again, toil\r\nas they may.  It is not good judgment to fit a crown of life upon a city\r\nwhich has been destroyed six times.  That other class of wiseacres who\r\ntwist prophecy in such a manner as to make it promise the destruction and\r\ndesolation of the same city, use judgment just as bad, since the city is\r\nin a very flourishing condition now, unhappily for them.  These things\r\nput arguments into the mouth of infidelity.\r\n\r\nA portion of the city is pretty exclusively Turkish; the Jews have a\r\nquarter to themselves; the Franks another quarter; so, also, with the\r\nArmenians.  The Armenians, of course, are Christians.  Their houses are\r\nlarge, clean, airy, handsomely paved with black and white squares of\r\nmarble, and in the centre of many of them is a square court, which has in\r\nit a luxuriant flower-garden and a sparkling fountain; the doors of all\r\nthe rooms open on this.  A very wide hall leads to the street door, and\r\nin this the women sit, the most of the day.  In the cool of the evening\r\nthey dress up in their best raiment and show themselves at the door.\r\nThey are all comely of countenance, and exceedingly neat and cleanly;\r\nthey look as if they were just out of a band-box.  Some of the young\r\nladies--many of them, I may say--are even very beautiful; they average a\r\nshade better than American girls--which treasonable words I pray may be\r\nforgiven me.  They are very sociable, and will smile back when a stranger\r\nsmiles at them, bow back when he bows, and talk back if he speaks to\r\nthem.  No introduction is required.  An hour's chat at the door with a\r\npretty girl one never saw before, is easily obtained, and is very\r\npleasant.  I have tried it.  I could not talk anything but English, and\r\nthe girl knew nothing but Greek, or Armenian, or some such barbarous\r\ntongue, but we got along very well.  I find that in cases like these, the\r\nfact that you can not comprehend each other isn't much of a drawback.\r\nIn that Russia n town of Yalta I danced an astonishing sort of dance an\r\nhour long, and one I had not heard of before, with a very pretty girl,\r\nand we talked incessantly, and laughed exhaustingly, and neither one ever\r\nknew what the other was driving at.  But it was splendid.  There were\r\ntwenty people in the set, and the dance was very lively and complicated.\r\nIt was complicated enough without me--with me it was more so.  I threw in\r\na figure now and then that surprised those Russians.  But I have never\r\nceased to think of that girl.  I have written to her, but I can not\r\ndirect the epistle because her name is one of those nine-jointed Russian\r\naffairs, and there are not letters enough in our alphabet to hold out.\r\nI am not reckless enough to try to pronounce it when I am awake, but I\r\nmake a stagger at it in my dreams, and get up with the lockjaw in the\r\nmorning.  I am fading.  I do not take my meals now, with any sort of\r\nregularity.  Her dear name haunts me still in my dreams.  It is awful on\r\nteeth.  It never comes out of my mouth but it fetches an old snag along\r\nwith it.  And then the lockjaw closes down and nips off a couple of the\r\nlast syllables--but they taste good.\r\n\r\nComing through the Dardanelles, we saw camel trains on shore with the\r\nglasses, but we were never close to one till we got to Smyrna.  These\r\ncamels are very much larger than the scrawny specimens one sees in the\r\nmenagerie.  They stride along these streets, in single file, a dozen in a\r\ntrain, with heavy loads on their backs, and a fancy-looking negro in\r\nTurkish costume, or an Arab, preceding them on a little donkey and\r\ncompletely overshadowed and rendered insignificant by the huge beasts.\r\nTo see a camel train laden with the spices of Arabia and the rare fabrics\r\nof Persia come marching through the narrow alleys of the bazaar, among\r\nporters with their burdens, money-changers, lamp-merchants, Al-naschars\r\nin the glassware business, portly cross-legged Turks smoking the famous\r\nnarghili; and the crowds drifting to and fro in the fanciful costumes of\r\nthe East, is a genuine revelation of the Orient.  The picture lacks\r\nnothing.  It casts you back at once into your forgotten boyhood, and\r\nagain you dream over the wonders of the Arabian Nights; again your\r\ncompanions are princes, your lord is the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid, and\r\nyour servants are terrific giants and genii that come with smoke and\r\nlightning and thunder, and go as a storm goes when they depart!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nWe inquired, and learned that the lions of Smyrna consisted of the ruins\r\nof the ancient citadel, whose broken and prodigious battlements frown\r\nupon the city from a lofty hill just in the edge of the town--the Mount\r\nPagus of Scripture, they call it; the site of that one of the Seven\r\nApocalyptic Churches of Asia which was located here in the first century\r\nof the Christian era; and the grave and the place of martyrdom of the\r\nvenerable Polycarp, who suffered in Smyrna for his religion some eighteen\r\nhundred years ago.\r\n\r\nWe took little donkeys and started.  We saw Polycarp's tomb, and then\r\nhurried on.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cSeven Churches\xe2\x80\x9d--thus they abbreviate it--came next on the list.  We\r\nrode there--about a mile and a half in the sweltering sun--and visited a\r\nlittle Greek church which they said was built upon the ancient site; and\r\nwe paid a small fee, and the holy attendant gave each of us a little wax\r\ncandle as a remembrancer of the place, and I put mine in my hat and the\r\nsun melted it and the grease all ran down the back of my neck; and so now\r\nI have not any thing left but the wick, and it is a sorry and a\r\nwilted-looking wick at that.\r\n\r\nSeveral of us argued as well as we could that the \xe2\x80\x9cchurch\xe2\x80\x9d mentioned in\r\nthe Bible meant a party of Christians, and not a building; that the Bible\r\nspoke of them as being very poor--so poor, I thought, and so subject to\r\npersecution (as per Polycarp's martyrdom) that in the first place they\r\nprobably could not have afforded a church edifice, and in the second\r\nwould not have dared to build it in the open light of day if they could;\r\nand finally, that if they had had the privilege of building it, common\r\njudgment would have suggested that they build it somewhere near the town.\r\nBut the elders of the ship's family ruled us down and scouted our\r\nevidences.  However, retribution came to them afterward.  They found that\r\nthey had been led astray and had gone to the wrong place; they discovered\r\nthat the accepted site is in the city.\r\n\r\nRiding through the town, we could see marks of the six Smyrnas that have\r\nexisted here and been burned up by fire or knocked down by earthquakes.\r\nThe hills and the rocks are rent asunder in places, excavations expose\r\ngreat blocks of building-stone that have lain buried for ages, and all\r\nthe mean houses and walls of modern Smyrna along the way are spotted\r\nwhite with broken pillars, capitals and fragments of sculptured marble\r\nthat once adorned the lordly palaces that were the glory of the city in\r\nthe olden time.\r\n\r\nThe ascent of the hill of the citadel is very steep, and we proceeded\r\nrather slowly.  But there were matters of interest about us.  In one\r\nplace, five hundred feet above the sea, the perpendicular bank on the\r\nupper side of the road was ten or fifteen feet high, and the cut exposed\r\nthree veins of oyster shells, just as we have seen quartz veins exposed\r\nin the cutting of a road in Nevada or Montana.  The veins were about\r\neighteen inches thick and two or three feet apart, and they slanted along\r\ndownward for a distance of thirty feet or more, and then disappeared\r\nwhere the cut joined the road.  Heaven only knows how far a man might\r\ntrace them by \xe2\x80\x9cstripping.\xe2\x80\x9d  They were clean, nice oyster shells, large,\r\nand just like any other oyster shells.  They were thickly massed\r\ntogether, and none were scattered above or below the veins.  Each one was\r\na well-defined lead by itself, and without a spur.  My first instinct was\r\nto set up the usual--\r\n                                 NOTICE:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWe, the undersigned, claim five claims of two hundred feet each,\r\n     (and one for discovery,) on this ledge or lode of oyster-shells,\r\n     with all its dips, spurs, angles, variations and sinuosities, and\r\n     fifty feet on each side of the same, to work it, etc., etc.,\r\n     according to the mining laws of Smyrna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were such perfectly natural-looking leads that I could hardly keep\r\nfrom \xe2\x80\x9ctaking them up.\xe2\x80\x9d  Among the oyster-shells were mixed many fragments\r\nof ancient, broken crockery ware.  Now how did those masses of\r\noyster-shells get there?  I can not determine.  Broken crockery and\r\noyster-shells are suggestive of restaurants--but then they could have\r\nhad no such places away up there on that mountain side in our time,\r\nbecause nobody has lived up there.  A restaurant would not pay in such a\r\nstony, forbidding, desolate place.  And besides, there were no champagne\r\ncorks among the shells.  If there ever was a restaurant there, it must\r\nhave been in Smyrna's palmy days, when the hills were covered with\r\npalaces. I could believe in one restaurant, on those terms; but then how\r\nabout the three?  Did they have restaurants there at three different\r\nperiods of the world?--because there are two or three feet of solid\r\nearth between the oyster leads.  Evidently, the restaurant solution will\r\nnot answer.\r\n\r\nThe hill might have been the bottom of the sea, once, and been lifted up,\r\nwith its oyster-beds, by an earthquake--but, then, how about the\r\ncrockery?  And moreover, how about three oyster beds, one above another,\r\nand thick strata of good honest earth between?\r\n\r\nThat theory will not do.  It is just possible that this hill is Mount\r\nArarat, and that Noah's Ark rested here, and he ate oysters and threw the\r\nshells overboard.  But that will not do, either.  There are the three\r\nlayers again and the solid earth between--and, besides, there were only\r\neight in Noah's family, and they could not have eaten all these oysters\r\nin the two or three months they staid on top of that mountain.  The\r\nbeasts--however, it is simply absurd to suppose he did not know any more\r\nthan to feed the beasts on oyster suppers.\r\n\r\nIt is painful--it is even humiliating--but I am reduced at last to one\r\nslender theory: that the oysters climbed up there of their own accord.\r\nBut what object could they have had in view?--what did they want up\r\nthere?  What could any oyster want to climb a hill for?  To climb a hill\r\nmust necessarily be fatiguing and annoying exercise for an oyster.  The\r\nmost natural conclusion would be that the oysters climbed up there to\r\nlook at the scenery.  Yet when one comes to reflect upon the nature of an\r\noyster, it seems plain that he does not care for scenery.  An oyster has\r\nno taste for such things; he cares nothing for the beautiful.  An oyster\r\nis of a retiring disposition, and not lively--not even cheerful above the\r\naverage, and never enterprising.  But above all, an oyster does not take\r\nany interest in scenery--he scorns it.  What have I arrived at now?\r\nSimply at the point I started from, namely, those oyster shells are\r\nthere, in regular layers, five hundred feet above the sea, and no man\r\nknows how they got there.  I have hunted up the guide-books, and the gist\r\nof what they say is this: \xe2\x80\x9cThey are there, but how they got there is a\r\nmystery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years ago, a multitude of people in America put on their\r\nascension robes, took a tearful leave of their friends, and made ready to\r\nfly up into heaven at the first blast of the trumpet.  But the angel did\r\nnot blow it.  Miller's resurrection day was a failure.  The Millerites\r\nwere disgusted.  I did not suspect that there were Millers in Asia Minor,\r\nbut a gentleman tells me that they had it all set for the world to come\r\nto an end in Smyrna one day about three years ago.  There was much\r\nbuzzing and preparation for a long time previously, and it culminated in\r\na wild excitement at the appointed time.  A vast number of the populace\r\nascended the citadel hill early in the morning, to get out of the way of\r\nthe general destruction, and many of the infatuated closed up their shops\r\nand retired from all earthly business.  But the strange part of it was\r\nthat about three in the afternoon, while this gentleman and his friends\r\nwere at dinner in the hotel, a terrific storm of rain, accompanied by\r\nthunder and lightning, broke forth and continued with dire fury for two\r\nor three hours.  It was a thing unprecedented in Smyrna at that time of\r\nthe year, and scared some of the most skeptical.  The streets ran rivers\r\nand the hotel floor was flooded with water.  The dinner had to be\r\nsuspended.  When the storm finished and left every body drenched through\r\nand through, and melancholy and half-drowned, the ascensionists came down\r\nfrom the mountain as dry as so many charity-sermons!  They had been\r\nlooking down upon the fearful storm going on below, and really believed\r\nthat their proposed destruction of the world was proving a grand success.\r\n\r\nA railway here in Asia--in the dreamy realm of the Orient--in the fabled\r\nland of the Arabian Nights--is a strange thing to think of.  And yet they\r\nhave one already, and are building another.  The present one is well\r\nbuilt and well conducted, by an English Company, but is not doing an\r\nimmense amount of business.  The first year it carried a good many\r\npassengers, but its freight list only comprised eight hundred pounds of\r\nfigs!\r\n\r\nIt runs almost to the very gates of Ephesus--a town great in all ages of\r\nthe world--a city familiar to readers of the Bible, and one which was as\r\nold as the very hills when the disciples of Christ preached in its\r\nstreets.  It dates back to the shadowy ages of tradition, and was the\r\nbirthplace of gods renowned in Grecian mythology.  The idea of a\r\nlocomotive tearing through such a place as this, and waking the phantoms\r\nof its old days of romance out of their dreams of dead and gone\r\ncenturies, is curious enough.\r\n\r\nWe journey thither tomorrow to see the celebrated ruins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nThis has been a stirring day.  The Superintendent of the railway put a\r\ntrain at our disposal, and did us the further kindness of accompanying us\r\nto Ephesus and giving to us his watchful care.  We brought sixty scarcely\r\nperceptible donkeys in the freight cars, for we had much ground to go\r\nover.  We have seen some of the most grotesque costumes, along the line\r\nof the railroad, that can be imagined.  I am glad that no possible\r\ncombination of words could describe them, for I might then be foolish\r\nenough to attempt it.\r\n\r\nAt ancient Ayassalook, in the midst of a forbidding desert, we came upon\r\nlong lines of ruined aqueducts, and other remnants of architectural\r\ngrandeur, that told us plainly enough we were nearing what had been a\r\nmetropolis, once.  We left the train and mounted the donkeys, along with\r\nour invited guests--pleasant young gentlemen from the officers' list of\r\nan American man-of-war.\r\n\r\nThe little donkeys had saddles upon them which were made very high in\r\norder that the rider's feet might not drag the ground.  The preventative\r\ndid not work well in the cases of our tallest pilgrims, however.  There\r\nwere no bridles--nothing but a single rope, tied to the bit.  It was\r\npurely ornamental, for the donkey cared nothing for it.  If he were\r\ndrifting to starboard, you might put your helm down hard the other way,\r\nif it were any satisfaction to you to do it, but he would continue to\r\ndrift to starboard all the same.  There was only one process which could\r\nbe depended on, and it was to get down and lift his rear around until his\r\nhead pointed in the right direction, or take him under your arm and carry\r\nhim to a part of the road which he could not get out of without climbing.\r\nThe sun flamed down as hot as a furnace, and neck-scarfs, veils and\r\numbrellas seemed hardly any protection; they served only to make the long\r\nprocession look more than ever fantastic--for be it known the ladies were\r\nall riding astride because they could not stay on the shapeless saddles\r\nsidewise, the men were perspiring and out of temper, their feet were\r\nbanging against the rocks, the donkeys were capering in every direction\r\nbut the right one and being belabored with clubs for it, and every now\r\nand then a broad umbrella would suddenly go down out of the cavalcade,\r\nannouncing to all that one more pilgrim had bitten the dust.  It was a\r\nwilder picture than those solitudes had seen for many a day.  No donkeys\r\never existed that were as hard to navigate as these, I think, or that had\r\nso many vile, exasperating instincts.  Occasionally we grew so tired and\r\nbreathless with fighting them that we had to desist,--and immediately the\r\ndonkey would come down to a deliberate walk.  This, with the fatigue, and\r\nthe sun, would put a man asleep; and soon as the man was asleep, the\r\ndonkey would lie down.  My donkey shall never see his boyhood's home\r\nagain.  He has lain down once too often. He must die.\r\n\r\nWe all stood in the vast theatre of ancient Ephesus,--the stone-benched\r\namphitheatre I mean--and had our picture taken.  We looked as proper\r\nthere as we would look any where, I suppose.  We do not embellish the\r\ngeneral desolation of a desert much.  We add what dignity we can to a\r\nstately ruin with our green umbrellas and jackasses, but it is little.\r\nHowever, we mean well.\r\n\r\nI wish to say a brief word of the aspect of Ephesus.\r\n\r\nOn a high, steep hill, toward the sea, is a gray ruin of ponderous blocks\r\nof marble, wherein, tradition says, St. Paul was imprisoned eighteen\r\ncenturies ago.  From these old walls you have the finest view of the\r\ndesolate scene where once stood Ephesus, the proudest city of ancient\r\ntimes, and whose Temple of Diana was so noble in design, and so exquisite\r\nof workmanship, that it ranked high in the list of the Seven Wonders of\r\nthe World.\r\n\r\nBehind you is the sea; in front is a level green valley, (a marsh, in\r\nfact,) extending far away among the mountains; to the right of the front\r\nview is the old citadel of Ayassalook, on a high hill; the ruined Mosque\r\nof the Sultan Selim stands near it in the plain, (this is built over the\r\ngrave of St. John, and was formerly Christian Church); further toward\r\nyou is the hill of Pion, around whose front is clustered all that remains\r\nof the ruins of Ephesus that still stand; divided from it by a narrow\r\nvalley is the long, rocky, rugged mountain of Coressus.  The scene is a\r\npretty one, and yet desolate--for in that wide plain no man can live, and\r\nin it is no human habitation.  But for the crumbling arches and monstrous\r\npiers and broken walls that rise from the foot of the hill of Pion, one\r\ncould not believe that in this place once stood a city whose renown is\r\nolder than tradition itself.  It is incredible to reflect that things as\r\nfamiliar all over the world to-day as household words, belong in the\r\nhistory and in the shadowy legends of this silent, mournful solitude.\r\nWe speak of Apollo and of Diana--they were born here; of the\r\nmetamorphosis of Syrinx into a reed--it was done here; of the great god\r\nPan--he dwelt in the caves of this hill of Coressus; of the Amazons--this\r\nwas their best prized home; of Bacchus and Hercules both fought the\r\nwarlike women here; of the Cyclops--they laid the ponderous marble blocks\r\nof some of the ruins yonder; of Homer--this was one of his many\r\nbirthplaces; of Cirmon of Athens; of Alcibiades, Lysander, Agesilaus\r\n--they visited here; so did Alexander the Great; so did Hannibal and\r\nAntiochus, Scipio, Lucullus and Sylla; Brutus, Cassius, Pompey, Cicero,\r\nand Augustus; Antony was a judge in this place, and left his seat in the\r\nopen court, while the advocates were speaking, to run after Cleopatra,\r\nwho passed the door; from this city these two sailed on pleasure\r\nexcursions, in galleys with silver oars and perfumed sails, and with\r\ncompanies of beautiful girls to serve them, and actors and musicians to\r\namuse them; in days that seem almost modern, so remote are they from the\r\nearly history of this city, Paul the Apostle preached the new religion\r\nhere, and so did John, and here it is supposed the former was pitted\r\nagainst wild beasts, for in 1 Corinthians, xv. 32 he says:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIf after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      &c.,\r\n\r\nwhen many men still lived who had seen the Christ; here Mary Magdalen\r\ndied, and here the Virgin Mary ended her days with John, albeit Rome has\r\nsince judged it best to locate her grave elsewhere; six or seven hundred\r\nyears ago--almost yesterday, as it were--troops of mail-clad Crusaders\r\nthronged the streets; and to come down to trifles, we speak of meandering\r\nstreams, and find a new interest in a common word when we discover that\r\nthe crooked river Meander, in yonder valley, gave it to our dictionary.\r\nIt makes me feel as old as these dreary hills to look down upon these\r\nmoss-hung ruins, this historic desolation.  One may read the Scriptures\r\nand believe, but he can not go and stand yonder in the ruined theatre and\r\nin imagination people it again with the vanished multitudes who mobbed\r\nPaul's comrades there and shouted, with one voice, \xe2\x80\x9cGreat is Diana of the\r\nEphesians!\xe2\x80\x9d  The idea of a shout in such a solitude as this almost makes\r\none shudder.\r\n\r\nIt was a wonderful city, this Ephesus.  Go where you will about these\r\nbroad plains, you find the most exquisitely sculptured marble fragments\r\nscattered thick among the dust and weeds; and protruding from the ground,\r\nor lying prone upon it, are beautiful fluted columns of porphyry and all\r\nprecious marbles; and at every step you find elegantly carved capitals\r\nand massive bases, and polished tablets engraved with Greek inscriptions.\r\nIt is a world of precious relics, a wilderness of marred and mutilated\r\ngems.  And yet what are these things to the wonders that lie buried here\r\nunder the ground?  At Constantinople, at Pisa, in the cities of Spain,\r\nare great mosques and cathedrals, whose grandest columns came from the\r\ntemples and palaces of Ephesus, and yet one has only to scratch the\r\nground here to match them.  We shall never know what magnificence is,\r\nuntil this imperial city is laid bare to the sun.\r\n\r\nThe finest piece of sculpture we have yet seen and the one that impressed\r\nus most, (for we do not know much about art and can not easily work up\r\nourselves into ecstasies over it,) is one that lies in this old theatre\r\nof Ephesus which St. Paul's riot has made so celebrated.  It is only the\r\nheadless body of a man, clad in a coat of mail, with a Medusa head upon\r\nthe breast-plate, but we feel persuaded that such dignity and such\r\nmajesty were never thrown into a form of stone before.\r\n\r\nWhat builders they were, these men of antiquity!  The massive arches of\r\nsome of these ruins rest upon piers that are fifteen feet square and\r\nbuilt entirely of solid blocks of marble, some of which are as large as a\r\nSaratoga trunk, and some the size of a boarding-house sofa.  They are not\r\nshells or shafts of stone filled inside with rubbish, but the whole pier\r\nis a mass of solid masonry.  Vast arches, that may have been the gates of\r\nthe city, are built in the same way.  They have braved the storms and\r\nsieges of three thousand years, and have been shaken by many an\r\nearthquake, but still they stand.  When they dig alongside of them, they\r\nfind ranges of ponderous masonry that are as perfect in every detail as\r\nthey were the day those old Cyclopian giants finished them.  An English\r\nCompany is going to excavate Ephesus--and then!\r\n\r\nAnd now am I reminded of--\r\n\r\n                    THE LEGEND OF THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.\r\n\r\nIn the Mount of Pion, yonder, is the Cave of the Seven Sleepers.  Once\r\nupon a time, about fifteen hundred years ago, seven young men lived near\r\neach other in Ephesus, who belonged to the despised sect of the\r\nChristians.  It came to pass that the good King Maximilianus, (I am\r\ntelling this story for nice little boys and girls,) it came to pass, I\r\nsay, that the good King Maximilianus fell to persecuting the Christians,\r\nand as time rolled on he made it very warm for them.  So the seven young\r\nmen said one to the other, let us get up and travel.  And they got up and\r\ntraveled.  They tarried not to bid their fathers and mothers good-bye, or\r\nany friend they knew.  They only took certain moneys which their parents\r\nhad, and garments that belonged unto their friends, whereby they might\r\nremember them when far away; and they took also the dog Ketmehr, which\r\nwas the property of their neighbor Malchus, because the beast did run his\r\nhead into a noose which one of the young men was carrying carelessly, and\r\nthey had not time to release him; and they took also certain chickens\r\nthat seemed lonely in the neighboring coops, and likewise some bottles of\r\ncurious liquors that stood near the grocer's window; and then they\r\ndeparted from the city.  By-and-by they came to a marvelous cave in the\r\nHill of Pion and entered into it and feasted, and presently they hurried\r\non again.  But they forgot the bottles of curious liquors, and left them\r\nbehind.  They traveled in many lands, and had many strange adventures.\r\nThey were virtuous young men, and lost no opportunity that fell in their\r\nway to make their livelihood.  Their motto was in these words, namely,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProcrastination is the thief of time.\xe2\x80\x9d  And so, whenever they did come\r\nupon a man who was alone, they said, Behold, this person hath the\r\nwherewithal--let us go through him.  And they went through him.  At the\r\nend of five years they had waxed tired of travel and adventure, and\r\nlonged to revisit their old home again and hear the voices and see the\r\nfaces that were dear unto their youth.  Therefore they went through such\r\nparties as fell in their way where they sojourned at that time, and\r\njourneyed back toward Ephesus again.  For the good King Maximilianus was\r\nbecome converted unto the new faith, and the Christians rejoiced because\r\nthey were no longer persecuted.  One day as the sun went down, they came\r\nto the cave in the Mount of Pion, and they said, each to his fellow, Let\r\nus sleep here, and go and feast and make merry with our friends when the\r\nmorning cometh.  And each of the seven lifted up his voice and said, It\r\nis a whiz.  So they went in, and lo, where they had put them, there lay\r\nthe bottles of strange liquors, and they judged that age had not impaired\r\ntheir excellence.  Wherein the wanderers were right, and the heads of the\r\nsame were level.  So each of the young men drank six bottles, and behold\r\nthey felt very tired, then, and lay down and slept soundly.\r\n\r\nWhen they awoke, one of them, Johannes--surnamed Smithianus--said, We are\r\nnaked.  And it was so.  Their raiment was all gone, and the money which\r\nthey had gotten from a stranger whom they had proceeded through as they\r\napproached the city, was lying upon the ground, corroded and rusted and\r\ndefaced.  Likewise the dog Ketmehr was gone, and nothing save the brass\r\nthat was upon his collar remained.  They wondered much at these things.\r\nBut they took the money, and they wrapped about their bodies some leaves,\r\nand came up to the top of the hill.  Then were they perplexed.  The\r\nwonderful temple of Diana was gone; many grand edifices they had never\r\nseen before stood in the city; men in strange garbs moved about the\r\nstreets, and every thing was changed.\r\n\r\nJohannes said, It hardly seems like Ephesus.  Yet here is the great\r\ngymnasium; here is the mighty theatre, wherein I have seen seventy\r\nthousand men assembled; here is the Agora; there is the font where the\r\nsainted John the Baptist immersed the converts; yonder is the prison of\r\nthe good St. Paul, where we all did use to go to touch the ancient chains\r\nthat bound him and be cured of our distempers; I see the tomb of the\r\ndisciple Luke, and afar off is the church wherein repose the ashes of the\r\nholy John, where the Christians of Ephesus go twice a year to gather the\r\ndust from the tomb, which is able to make bodies whole again that are\r\ncorrupted by disease, and cleanse the soul from sin; but see how the\r\nwharves encroach upon the sea, and what multitudes of ships are anchored\r\nin the bay; see, also, how the city hath stretched abroad, far over the\r\nvalley behind Pion, and even unto the walls of Ayassalook; and lo, all\r\nthe hills are white with palaces and ribbed with colonnades of marble.\r\nHow mighty is Ephesus become!\r\n\r\nAnd wondering at what their eyes had seen, they went down into the city\r\nand purchased garments and clothed themselves.  And when they would have\r\npassed on, the merchant bit the coins which they had given him, with his\r\nteeth, and turned them about and looked curiously upon them, and cast\r\nthem upon his counter, and listened if they rang; and then he said, These\r\nbe bogus.  And they said, Depart thou to Hades, and went their way.  When\r\nthey were come to their houses, they recognized them, albeit they seemed\r\nold and mean; and they rejoiced, and were glad.  They ran to the doors,\r\nand knocked, and strangers opened, and looked inquiringly upon them.  And\r\nthey said, with great excitement, while their hearts beat high, and the\r\ncolor in their faces came and went, Where is my father?  Where is my\r\nmother?  Where are Dionysius and Serapion, and Pericles, and Decius?  And\r\nthe strangers that opened said, We know not these.  The Seven said, How,\r\nyou know them not?  How long have ye dwelt here, and whither are they\r\ngone that dwelt here before ye?  And the strangers said, Ye play upon us\r\nwith a jest, young men; we and our fathers have sojourned under these\r\nroofs these six generations; the names ye utter rot upon the tombs, and\r\nthey that bore them have run their brief race, have laughed and sung,\r\nhave borne the sorrows and the weariness that were allotted them, and are\r\nat rest; for nine-score years the summers have come and gone, and the\r\nautumn leaves have fallen, since the roses faded out of their cheeks and\r\nthey laid them to sleep with the dead.\r\n\r\nThen the seven young men turned them away from their homes, and the\r\nstrangers shut the doors upon them.  The wanderers marveled greatly, and\r\nlooked into the faces of all they met, as hoping to find one that they\r\nknew; but all were strange, and passed them by and spake no friendly\r\nword.  They were sore distressed and sad.  Presently they spake unto a\r\ncitizen and said, Who is King in Ephesus?  And the citizen answered and\r\nsaid, Whence come ye that ye know not that great Laertius reigns in\r\nEphesus?  They looked one at the other, greatly perplexed, and presently\r\nasked again, Where, then, is the good King Maximilianus?  The citizen\r\nmoved him apart, as one who is afraid, and said, Verily these men be mad,\r\nand dream dreams, else would they know that the King whereof they speak\r\nis dead above two hundred years agone.\r\n\r\nThen the scales fell from the eyes of the Seven, and one said, Alas, that\r\nwe drank of the curious liquors.  They have made us weary, and in\r\ndreamless sleep these two long centuries have we lain.  Our homes are\r\ndesolate, our friends are dead.  Behold, the jig is up--let us die.  And\r\nthat same day went they forth and laid them down and died.  And in that\r\nself-same day, likewise, the Seven-up did cease in Ephesus, for that the\r\nSeven that were up were down again, and departed and dead withal.  And\r\nthe names that be upon their tombs, even unto this time, are Johannes\r\nSmithianus, Trumps, Gift, High, and Low, Jack, and The Game.  And with\r\nthe sleepers lie also the bottles wherein were once the curious liquors:\r\nand upon them is writ, in ancient letters, such words as these--Dames of\r\nheathen gods of olden time, perchance: Rumpunch, Jinsling, Egnog.\r\n\r\nSuch is the story of the Seven Sleepers, (with slight variations,) and I\r\nknow it is true, because I have seen the cave myself.\r\n\r\nReally, so firm a faith had the ancients this legend, that as late as\r\neight or nine hundred years ago, learned travelers held it in\r\nsuperstitious fear.  Two of them record that they ventured into it, but\r\nran quickly out again, not daring to tarry lest they should fall asleep\r\nand outlive their great grand-children a century or so.  Even at this day\r\nthe ignorant denizens of the neighboring country prefer not to sleep in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nWhen I last made a memorandum, we were at Ephesus.  We are in Syria, now,\r\nencamped in the mountains of Lebanon.  The interregnum has been long,\r\nboth as to time and distance.  We brought not a relic from Ephesus!\r\nAfter gathering up fragments of sculptured marbles and breaking ornaments\r\nfrom the interior work of the Mosques; and after bringing them at a cost\r\nof infinite trouble and fatigue, five miles on muleback to the railway\r\ndepot, a government officer compelled all who had such things to\r\ndisgorge!  He had an order from Constantinople to look out for our party,\r\nand see that we carried nothing off.  It was a wise, a just, and a\r\nwell-deserved rebuke, but it created a sensation.  I never resist a\r\ntemptation to plunder a stranger's premises without feeling insufferably\r\nvain about it.  This time I felt proud beyond expression.  I was serene\r\nin the midst of the scoldings that were heaped upon the Ottoman\r\ngovernment for its affront offered to a pleasuring party of entirely\r\nrespectable gentlemen and ladies I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe that have free souls, it\r\ntouches us not.\xe2\x80\x9d  The shoe not only pinched our party, but it pinched\r\nhard; a principal sufferer discovered that the imperial order was\r\ninclosed in an envelop bearing the seal of the British Embassy at\r\nConstantinople, and therefore must have been inspired by the\r\nrepresentative of the Queen.  This was bad--very bad.  Coming solely\r\nfrom the Ottomans, it might have signified only Ottoman hatred of\r\nChristians, and a vulgar ignorance as to genteel methods of expressing\r\nit; but coming from the Christianized, educated, politic British\r\nlegation, it simply intimated that we were a sort of gentlemen and\r\nladies who would bear watching!  So the party regarded it, and were\r\nincensed accordingly.  The truth doubtless was, that the same\r\nprecautions would have been taken against any travelers, because the\r\nEnglish Company who have acquired the right to excavate Ephesus, and\r\nhave paid a great sum for that right, need to be protected, and deserve\r\nto be. They can not afford to run the risk of having their hospitality\r\nabused by travelers, especially since travelers are such notorious\r\nscorners of honest behavior.\r\n\r\nWe sailed from Smyrna, in the wildest spirit of expectancy, for the chief\r\nfeature, the grand goal of the expedition, was near at hand--we were\r\napproaching the Holy Land!  Such a burrowing into the hold for trunks\r\nthat had lain buried for weeks, yes for months; such a hurrying to and\r\nfro above decks and below; such a riotous system of packing and\r\nunpacking; such a littering up of the cabins with shirts and skirts, and\r\nindescribable and unclassable odds and ends; such a making up of bundles,\r\nand setting apart of umbrellas, green spectacles and thick veils; such a\r\ncritical inspection of saddles and bridles that had never yet touched\r\nhorses; such a cleaning and loading of revolvers and examining of\r\nbowie-knives; such a half-soling of the seats of pantaloons with\r\nserviceable buckskin; then such a poring over ancient maps; such a\r\nreading up of Bibles and Palestine travels; such a marking out of\r\nroutes; such exasperating efforts to divide up the company into little\r\nbands of congenial spirits who might make the long and arduous Journey\r\nwithout quarreling; and morning, noon and night, such mass-meetings in\r\nthe cabins, such speech-making, such sage suggesting, such worrying and\r\nquarreling, and such a general raising of the very mischief, was never\r\nseen in the ship before!\r\n\r\nBut it is all over now.  We are cut up into parties of six or eight, and\r\nby this time are scattered far and wide.  Ours is the only one, however,\r\nthat is venturing on what is called \xe2\x80\x9cthe long trip\xe2\x80\x9d--that is, out into\r\nSyria, by Baalbec to Damascus, and thence down through the full length of\r\nPalestine.  It would be a tedious, and also a too risky journey, at this\r\nhot season of the year, for any but strong, healthy men, accustomed\r\nsomewhat to fatigue and rough life in the open air.  The other parties\r\nwill take shorter journeys.\r\n\r\nFor the last two months we have been in a worry about one portion of this\r\nHoly Land pilgrimage.  I refer to transportation service.  We knew very\r\nwell that Palestine was a country which did not do a large passenger\r\nbusiness, and every man we came across who knew any thing about it gave\r\nus to understand that not half of our party would be able to get dragomen\r\nand animals.  At Constantinople every body fell to telegraphing the\r\nAmerican Consuls at Alexandria and Beirout to give notice that we wanted\r\ndragomen and transportation.  We were desperate--would take horses,\r\njackasses, cameleopards, kangaroos--any thing.  At Smyrna, more\r\ntelegraphing was done, to the same end.  Also fearing for the worst, we\r\ntelegraphed for a large number of seats in the diligence for Damascus,\r\nand horses for the ruins of Baalbec.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, a notion got abroad in Syria and Egypt that\r\nthe whole population of the Province of America (the Turks consider us a\r\ntrifling little province in some unvisited corner of the world,) were\r\ncoming to the Holy Land--and so, when we got to Beirout yesterday, we\r\nfound the place full of dragomen and their outfits.  We had all intended\r\nto go by diligence to Damascus, and switch off to Baalbec as we went\r\nalong--because we expected to rejoin the ship, go to Mount Carmel, and\r\ntake to the woods from there.  However, when our own private party of\r\neight found that it was possible, and proper enough, to make the \xe2\x80\x9clong\r\ntrip,\xe2\x80\x9d we adopted that programme.  We have never been much trouble to a\r\nConsul before, but we have been a fearful nuisance to our Consul at\r\nBeirout.  I mention this because I can not help admiring his patience,\r\nhis industry, and his accommodating spirit.  I mention it also, because I\r\nthink some of our ship's company did not give him as full credit for his\r\nexcellent services as he deserved.\r\n\r\nWell, out of our eight, three were selected to attend to all business\r\nconnected with the expedition.  The rest of us had nothing to do but look\r\nat the beautiful city of Beirout, with its bright, new houses nestled\r\namong a wilderness of green shrubbery spread abroad over an upland that\r\nsloped gently down to the sea; and also at the mountains of Lebanon that\r\nenviron it; and likewise to bathe in the transparent blue water that\r\nrolled its billows about the ship (we did not know there were sharks\r\nthere.) We had also to range up and down through the town and look at the\r\ncostumes.  These are picturesque and fanciful, but not so varied as at\r\nConstantinople and Smyrna; the women of Beirout add an agony--in the two\r\nformer cities the sex wear a thin veil which one can see through (and\r\nthey often expose their ancles,) but at Beirout they cover their entire\r\nfaces with dark-colored or black veils, so that they look like mummies,\r\nand then expose their breasts to the public.  A young gentleman (I\r\nbelieve he was a Greek,) volunteered to show us around the city, and said\r\nit would afford him great pleasure, because he was studying English and\r\nwanted practice in that language.  When we had finished the rounds,\r\nhowever, he called for remuneration--said he hoped the gentlemen would\r\ngive him a trifle in the way of a few piastres (equivalent to a few five\r\ncent pieces.)  We did so.  The Consul was surprised when he heard it, and\r\nsaid he knew the young fellow's family very well, and that they were an\r\nold and highly respectable family and worth a hundred and fifty thousand\r\ndollars!  Some people, so situated, would have been ashamed of the berth\r\nhe had with us and his manner of crawling into it.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time our business committee reported, and said all\r\nthings were in readdress--that we were to start to-day, with horses, pack\r\nanimals, and tents, and go to Baalbec, Damascus, the Sea of Tiberias, and\r\nthence southward by the way of the scene of Jacob's Dream and other\r\nnotable Bible localities to Jerusalem--from thence probably to the Dead\r\nSea, but possibly not--and then strike for the ocean and rejoin the ship\r\nthree or four weeks hence at Joppa; terms, five dollars a day apiece, in\r\ngold, and every thing to be furnished by the dragoman.  They said we\r\nwould lie as well as at a hotel.  I had read something like that before,\r\nand did not shame my judgment by believing a word of it.  I said nothing,\r\nhowever, but packed up a blanket and a shawl to sleep in, pipes and\r\ntobacco, two or three woollen shirts, a portfolio, a guide-book, and a\r\nBible.  I also took along a towel and a cake of soap, to inspire respect\r\nin the Arabs, who would take me for a king in disguise.\r\n\r\nWe were to select our horses at 3 P.M.  At that hour Abraham, the\r\ndragoman, marshaled them before us.  With all solemnity I set it down\r\nhere, that those horses were the hardest lot I ever did come across, and\r\ntheir accoutrements were in exquisite keeping with their style.  One\r\nbrute had an eye out; another had his tail sawed off close, like a\r\nrabbit, and was proud of it; another had a bony ridge running from his\r\nneck to his tail, like one of those ruined aqueducts one sees about Rome,\r\nand had a neck on him like a bowsprit; they all limped, and had sore\r\nbacks, and likewise raw places and old scales scattered about their\r\npersons like brass nails in a hair trunk; their gaits were marvelous to\r\ncontemplate, and replete with variety under way the procession looked\r\nlike a fleet in a storm.  It was fearful.  Blucher shook his head and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat dragon is going to get himself into trouble fetching these old\r\ncrates out of the hospital the way they are, unless he has got a permit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said nothing.  The display was exactly according to the guide-book, and\r\nwere we not traveling by the guide-book?  I selected a certain horse\r\nbecause I thought I saw him shy, and I thought that a horse that had\r\nspirit enough to shy was not to be despised.\r\n\r\nAt 6 o'clock P.M., we came to a halt here on the breezy summit of a\r\nshapely mountain overlooking the sea, and the handsome valley where dwelt\r\nsome of those enterprising Phoenicians of ancient times we read so much\r\nabout; all around us are what were once the dominions of Hiram, King of\r\nTyre, who furnished timber from the cedars of these Lebanon hills to\r\nbuild portions of King Solomon's Temple with.\r\n\r\nShortly after six, our pack train arrived.  I had not seen it before, and\r\na good right I had to be astonished.  We had nineteen serving men and\r\ntwenty-six pack mules!  It was a perfect caravan.  It looked like one,\r\ntoo, as it wound among the rocks.  I wondered what in the very mischief\r\nwe wanted with such a vast turn-out as that, for eight men.  I wondered\r\nawhile, but soon I began to long for a tin plate, and some bacon and\r\nbeans.  I had camped out many and many a time before, and knew just what\r\nwas coming.  I went off, without waiting for serving men, and unsaddled\r\nmy horse, and washed such portions of his ribs and his spine as projected\r\nthrough his hide, and when I came back, behold five stately circus tents\r\nwere up--tents that were brilliant, within, with blue, and gold, and\r\ncrimson, and all manner of splendid adornment!  I was speechless.  Then\r\nthey brought eight little iron bedsteads, and set them up in the tents;\r\nthey put a soft mattress and pillows and good blankets and two snow-white\r\nsheets on each bed.  Next, they rigged a table about the centre-pole, and\r\non it placed pewter pitchers, basins, soap, and the whitest of towels\r\n--one set for each man; they pointed to pockets in the tent, and said we\r\ncould put our small trifles in them for convenience, and if we needed\r\npins or such things, they were sticking every where.  Then came the\r\nfinishing touch--they spread carpets on the floor!  I simply said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nyou call this camping out, all right--but it isn't the style I am used\r\nto; my little baggage that I brought along is at a discount.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt grew dark, and they put candles on the tables--candles set in bright,\r\nnew, brazen candlesticks.  And soon the bell--a genuine, simon-pure bell\r\n--rang, and we were invited to \xe2\x80\x9cthe saloon.\xe2\x80\x9d  I had thought before that\r\nwe had a tent or so too many, but now here was one, at least, provided\r\nfor; it was to be used for nothing but an eating-saloon.  Like the\r\nothers, it was high enough for a family of giraffes to live in, and was\r\nvery handsome and clean and bright-colored within.  It was a gem of a\r\nplace.  A table for eight, and eight canvas chairs; a table-cloth and\r\nnapkins whose whiteness and whose fineness laughed to scorn the things we\r\nwere used to in the great excursion steamer; knives and forks,\r\nsoup-plates, dinner-plates--every thing, in the handsomest kind of\r\nstyle.  It was wonderful!  And they call this camping out.  Those\r\nstately fellows in baggy trowsers and turbaned fezzes brought in a\r\ndinner which consisted of roast mutton, roast chicken, roast goose,\r\npotatoes, bread, tea, pudding, apples, and delicious grapes; the viands\r\nwere better cooked than any we had eaten for weeks, and the table made a\r\nfiner appearance, with its large German silver candlesticks and other\r\nfinery, than any table we had sat down to for a good while, and yet that\r\npolite dragoman, Abraham, came bowing in and apologizing for the whole\r\naffair, on account of the unavoidable confusion of getting under way for\r\na very long trip, and promising to do a great deal better in future!\r\n\r\nIt is midnight, now, and we break camp at six in the morning.\r\n\r\nThey call this camping out.  At this rate it is a glorious privilege to\r\nbe a pilgrim to the Holy Land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nWe are camped near Temnin-el-Foka--a name which the boys have simplified\r\na good deal, for the sake of convenience in spelling.  They call it\r\nJacksonville.  It sounds a little strangely, here in the Valley of\r\nLebanon, but it has the merit of being easier to remember than the Arabic\r\nname.\r\n\r\n                     \xe2\x80\x9cCOME LIKE SPIRITS, SO DEPART.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x9cThe night shall be filled with music,\r\n                   And the cares that infest the day\r\n                 Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,\r\n                      And as silently steal away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI slept very soundly last night, yet when the dragoman's bell rang at\r\nhalf-past five this morning and the cry went abroad of \xe2\x80\x9cTen minutes to\r\ndress for breakfast!\xe2\x80\x9d  I heard both.  It surprised me, because I have not\r\nheard the breakfast gong in the ship for a month, and whenever we have\r\nhad occasion to fire a salute at daylight, I have only found it out in\r\nthe course of conversation afterward.  However, camping out, even though\r\nit be in a gorgeous tent, makes one fresh and lively in the morning\r\n--especially if the air you are breathing is the cool, fresh air of the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nI was dressed within the ten minutes, and came out.  The saloon tent had\r\nbeen stripped of its sides, and had nothing left but its roof; so when we\r\nsat down to table we could look out over a noble panorama of mountain,\r\nsea and hazy valley.  And sitting thus, the sun rose slowly up and\r\nsuffused the picture with a world of rich coloring.\r\n\r\nHot mutton chops, fried chicken, omelettes, fried potatoes and coffee\r\n--all excellent.  This was the bill of fare.  It was sauced with a savage\r\nappetite purchased by hard riding the day before, and refreshing sleep in\r\na pure atmosphere.  As I called for a second cup of coffee, I glanced\r\nover my shoulder, and behold our white village was gone--the splendid\r\ntents had vanished like magic!  It was wonderful how quickly those Arabs\r\nhad \xe2\x80\x9cfolded their tents;\xe2\x80\x9d and it was wonderful, also, how quickly they\r\nhad gathered the thousand odds and ends of the camp together and\r\ndisappeared with them.\r\n\r\nBy half-past six we were under way, and all the Syrian world seemed to be\r\nunder way also.  The road was filled with mule trains and long\r\nprocessions of camels.  This reminds me that we have been trying for some\r\ntime to think what a camel looks like, and now we have made it out.  When\r\nhe is down on all his knees, flat on his breast to receive his load, he\r\nlooks something like a goose swimming; and when he is upright he looks\r\nlike an ostrich with an extra set of legs.  Camels are not beautiful, and\r\ntheir long under lip gives them an exceedingly \xe2\x80\x9cgallus\xe2\x80\x9d--[Excuse the\r\nslang, no other word will describe it]--expression.  They have immense,\r\nflat, forked cushions of feet, that make a track in the dust like a pie\r\nwith a slice cut out of it.  They are not particular about their diet.\r\nThey would eat a tombstone if they could bite it.  A thistle grows about\r\nhere which has needles on it that would pierce through leather, I think;\r\nif one touches you, you can find relief in nothing but profanity.  The\r\ncamels eat these.  They show by their actions that they enjoy them.  I\r\nsuppose it would be a real treat to a camel to have a keg of nails for\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\nWhile I am speaking of animals, I will mention that I have a horse now by\r\nthe name of \xe2\x80\x9cJericho.\xe2\x80\x9d  He is a mare.  I have seen remarkable horses\r\nbefore, but none so remarkable as this.  I wanted a horse that could shy,\r\nand this one fills the bill.  I had an idea that shying indicated spirit.\r\nIf I was correct, I have got the most spirited horse on earth.  He shies\r\nat every thing he comes across, with the utmost impartiality.  He appears\r\nto have a mortal dread of telegraph poles, especially; and it is\r\nfortunate that these are on both sides of the road, because as it is now,\r\nI never fall off twice in succession on the same side.  If I fell on the\r\nsame side always, it would get to be monotonous after a while.  This\r\ncreature has scared at every thing he has seen to-day, except a haystack.\r\nHe walked up to that with an intrepidity and a recklessness that were\r\nastonishing.  And it would fill any one with admiration to see how he\r\npreserves his self-possession in the presence of a barley sack.  This\r\ndare-devil bravery will be the death of this horse some day.\r\n\r\nHe is not particularly fast, but I think he will get me through the Holy\r\nLand.  He has only one fault.  His tail has been chopped off or else he\r\nhas sat down on it too hard, some time or other, and he has to fight the\r\nflies with his heels.  This is all very well, but when he tries to kick a\r\nfly off the top of his head with his hind foot, it is too much variety.\r\nHe is going to get himself into trouble that way some day.  He reaches\r\naround and bites my legs too.  I do not care particularly about that,\r\nonly I do not like to see a horse too sociable.\r\n\r\nI think the owner of this prize had a wrong opinion about him.  He had an\r\nidea that he was one of those fiery, untamed steeds, but he is not of\r\nthat character.  I know the Arab had this idea, because when he brought\r\nthe horse out for inspection in Beirout, he kept jerking at the bridle\r\nand shouting in Arabic, \xe2\x80\x9cHo! will you?  Do you want to run away, you\r\nferocious beast, and break your neck?\xe2\x80\x9d when all the time the horse was\r\nnot doing anything in the world, and only looked like he wanted to lean\r\nup against something and think.  Whenever he is not shying at things, or\r\nreaching after a fly, he wants to do that yet.  How it would surprise his\r\nowner to know this.\r\n\r\nWe have been in a historical section of country all day.  At noon we\r\ncamped three hours and took luncheon at Mekseh, near the junction of the\r\nLebanon Mountains and the Jebel el Kuneiyiseh, and looked down into the\r\nimmense, level, garden-like Valley of Lebanon.  To-night we are camping\r\nnear the same valley, and have a very wide sweep of it in view.  We can\r\nsee the long, whale-backed ridge of Mount Hermon projecting above the\r\neastern hills.  The \xe2\x80\x9cdews of Hermon\xe2\x80\x9d are falling upon us now, and the\r\ntents are almost soaked with them.\r\n\r\nOver the way from us, and higher up the valley, we can discern, through\r\nthe glasses, the faint outlines of the wonderful ruins of Baalbec, the\r\nsupposed Baal-Gad of Scripture.  Joshua, and another person, were the two\r\nspies who were sent into this land of Canaan by the children of Israel to\r\nreport upon its character--I mean they were the spies who reported\r\nfavorably.  They took back with them some specimens of the grapes of this\r\ncountry, and in the children's picture-books they are always represented\r\nas bearing one monstrous bunch swung to a pole between them, a\r\nrespectable load for a pack-train.  The Sunday-school books exaggerated\r\nit a little.  The grapes are most excellent to this day, but the bunches\r\nare not as large as those in the pictures.  I was surprised and hurt when\r\nI saw them, because those colossal bunches of grapes were one of my most\r\ncherished juvenile traditions.\r\n\r\nJoshua reported favorably, and the children of Israel journeyed on, with\r\nMoses at the head of the general government, and Joshua in command of the\r\narmy of six hundred thousand fighting men.  Of women and children and\r\ncivilians there was a countless swarm.  Of all that mighty host, none but\r\nthe two faithful spies ever lived to set their feet in the Promised Land.\r\nThey and their descendants wandered forty years in the desert, and then\r\nMoses, the gifted warrior, poet, statesman and philosopher, went up into\r\nPisgah and met his mysterious fate.  Where he was buried no man knows\r\n--for\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9c* * * no man dug that sepulchre,\r\n          And no man saw it e'er\r\n          --For the Sons of God upturned the sod\r\n          And laid the dead man there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Joshua began his terrible raid, and from Jericho clear to this\r\nBaal-Gad, he swept the land like the Genius of Destruction.  He\r\nslaughtered the people, laid waste their soil, and razed their cities to\r\nthe ground. He wasted thirty-one kings also.  One may call it that,\r\nthough really it can hardly be called wasting them, because there were\r\nalways plenty of kings in those days, and to spare.  At any rate, he\r\ndestroyed thirty-one kings, and divided up their realms among his\r\nIsraelites.  He divided up this valley stretched out here before us, and\r\nso it was once Jewish territory.  The Jews have long since disappeared\r\nfrom it, however.\r\n\r\nBack yonder, an hour's journey from here, we passed through an Arab\r\nvillage of stone dry-goods boxes (they look like that,) where Noah's tomb\r\nlies under lock and key.  [Noah built the ark.]  Over these old hills and\r\nvalleys the ark that contained all that was left of a vanished world once\r\nfloated.\r\n\r\nI make no apology for detailing the above information.  It will be news\r\nto some of my readers, at any rate.\r\n\r\nNoah's tomb is built of stone, and is covered with a long stone building.\r\nBucksheesh let us in.  The building had to be long, because the grave of\r\nthe honored old navigator is two hundred and ten feet long itself!  It is\r\nonly about four feet high, though.  He must have cast a shadow like a\r\nlightning-rod.  The proof that this is the genuine spot where Noah was\r\nburied can only be doubted by uncommonly incredulous people.  The\r\nevidence is pretty straight.  Shem, the son of Noah, was present at the\r\nburial, and showed the place to his descendants, who transmitted the\r\nknowledge to their descendants, and the lineal descendants of these\r\nintroduced themselves to us to-day.  It was pleasant to make the\r\nacquaintance of members of so respectable a family.  It was a thing to be\r\nproud of.  It was the next thing to being acquainted with Noah himself.\r\n\r\nNoah's memorable voyage will always possess a living interest for me,\r\nhenceforward.\r\n\r\nIf ever an oppressed race existed, it is this one we see fettered around\r\nus under the inhuman tyranny of the Ottoman Empire.  I wish Europe would\r\nlet Russia annihilate Turkey a little--not much, but enough to make it\r\ndifficult to find the place again without a divining-rod or a\r\ndiving-bell.  The Syrians are very poor, and yet they are ground down by\r\na system of taxation that would drive any other nation frantic.  Last\r\nyear their taxes were heavy enough, in all conscience--but this year\r\nthey have been increased by the addition of taxes that were forgiven\r\nthem in times of famine in former years.  On top of this the Government\r\nhas levied a tax of one-tenth of the whole proceeds of the land.  This\r\nis only half the story.  The Pacha of a Pachalic does not trouble\r\nhimself with appointing tax-collectors.  He figures up what all these\r\ntaxes ought to amount to in a certain district.  Then he farms the\r\ncollection out.  He calls the rich men together, the highest bidder gets\r\nthe speculation, pays the Pacha on the spot, and then sells out to\r\nsmaller fry, who sell in turn to a piratical horde of still smaller fry.\r\nThese latter compel the peasant to bring his little trifle of grain to\r\nthe village, at his own cost.  It must be weighed, the various taxes set\r\napart, and the remainder returned to the producer.  But the collector\r\ndelays this duty day after day, while the producer's family are\r\nperishing for bread; at last the poor wretch, who can not but understand\r\nthe game, says, \xe2\x80\x9cTake a quarter--take half--take two-thirds if you will,\r\nand let me go!\xe2\x80\x9d  It is a most outrageous state of things.\r\n\r\nThese people are naturally good-hearted and intelligent, and with\r\neducation and liberty, would be a happy and contented race.  They often\r\nappeal to the stranger to know if the great world will not some day come\r\nto their relief and save them.  The Sultan has been lavishing money like\r\nwater in England and Paris, but his subjects are suffering for it now.\r\n\r\nThis fashion of camping out bewilders me.  We have boot-jacks and a\r\nbath-tub, now, and yet all the mysteries the pack-mules carry are not\r\nrevealed.  What next?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nWe had a tedious ride of about five hours, in the sun, across the Valley\r\nof Lebanon.  It proved to be not quite so much of a garden as it had\r\nseemed from the hill-sides.  It was a desert, weed-grown waste, littered\r\nthickly with stones the size of a man's fist.  Here and there the natives\r\nhad scratched the ground and reared a sickly crop of grain, but for the\r\nmost part the valley was given up to a handful of shepherds, whose flocks\r\nwere doing what they honestly could to get a living, but the chances were\r\nagainst them.  We saw rude piles of stones standing near the roadside, at\r\nintervals, and recognized the custom of marking boundaries which obtained\r\nin Jacob's time.  There were no walls, no fences, no hedges--nothing to\r\nsecure a man's possessions but these random heaps of stones.  The\r\nIsraelites held them sacred in the old patriarchal times, and these other\r\nArabs, their lineal descendants, do so likewise.  An American, of\r\nordinary intelligence, would soon widely extend his property, at an\r\noutlay of mere manual labor, performed at night, under so loose a system\r\nof fencing as this.\r\n\r\nThe plows these people use are simply a sharpened stick, such as Abraham\r\nplowed with, and they still winnow their wheat as he did--they pile it on\r\nthe house-top, and then toss it by shovel-fulls into the air until the\r\nwind has blown all the chaff away.  They never invent any thing, never\r\nlearn any thing.\r\n\r\nWe had a fine race, of a mile, with an Arab perched on a camel.  Some of\r\nthe horses were fast, and made very good time, but the camel scampered by\r\nthem without any very great effort.  The yelling and shouting, and\r\nwhipping and galloping, of all parties interested, made it an\r\nexhilarating, exciting, and particularly boisterous race.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock, our eyes fell upon the walls and columns of Baalbec, a\r\nnoble ruin whose history is a sealed book.  It has stood there for\r\nthousands of years, the wonder and admiration of travelers; but who built\r\nit, or when it was built, are questions that may never be answered.  One\r\nthing is very sure, though.  Such grandeur of design, and such grace of\r\nexecution, as one sees in the temples of Baalbec, have not been equaled\r\nor even approached in any work of men's hands that has been built within\r\ntwenty centuries past.\r\n\r\nThe great Temple of the Sun, the Temple of Jupiter, and several smaller\r\ntemples, are clustered together in the midst of one of these miserable\r\nSyrian villages, and look strangely enough in such plebeian company.\r\nThese temples are built upon massive substructions that might support a\r\nworld, almost; the materials used are blocks of stone as large as an\r\nomnibus--very few, if any of them, are smaller than a carpenter's tool\r\nchest--and these substructions are traversed by tunnels of masonry\r\nthrough which a train of cars might pass.  With such foundations as\r\nthese, it is little wonder that Baalbec has lasted so long.  The Temple\r\nof the Sun is nearly three hundred feet long and one hundred and sixty\r\nfeet wide.  It had fifty-four columns around it, but only six are\r\nstanding now--the others lie broken at its base, a confused and\r\npicturesque heap.  The six columns are their bases, Corinthian capitals\r\nand entablature--and six more shapely columns do not exist.  The columns\r\nand the entablature together are ninety feet high--a prodigious altitude\r\nfor shafts of stone to reach, truly--and yet one only thinks of their\r\nbeauty and symmetry when looking at them; the pillars look slender and\r\ndelicate, the entablature, with its elaborate sculpture, looks like rich\r\nstucco-work.  But when you have gazed aloft till your eyes are weary, you\r\nglance at the great fragments of pillars among which you are standing,\r\nand find that they are eight feet through; and with them lie beautiful\r\ncapitals apparently as large as a small cottage; and also single slabs of\r\nstone, superbly sculptured, that are four or five feet thick, and would\r\ncompletely cover the floor of any ordinary parlor.  You wonder where\r\nthese monstrous things came from, and it takes some little time to\r\nsatisfy yourself that the airy and graceful fabric that towers above your\r\nhead is made up of their mates.  It seems too preposterous.\r\n\r\nThe Temple of Jupiter is a smaller ruin than the one I have been speaking\r\nof, and yet is immense.  It is in a tolerable state of preservation.  One\r\nrow of nine columns stands almost uninjured.  They are sixty-five feet\r\nhigh and support a sort of porch or roof, which connects them with the\r\nroof of the building.  This porch-roof is composed of tremendous slabs of\r\nstone, which are so finely sculptured on the under side that the work\r\nlooks like a fresco from below.  One or two of these slabs had fallen,\r\nand again I wondered if the gigantic masses of carved stone that lay\r\nabout me were no larger than those above my head.  Within the temple, the\r\nornamentation was elaborate and colossal.  What a wonder of architectural\r\nbeauty and grandeur this edifice must have been when it was new!  And\r\nwhat a noble picture it and its statelier companion, with the chaos of\r\nmighty fragments scattered about them, yet makes in the moonlight!\r\n\r\nI can not conceive how those immense blocks of stone were ever hauled\r\nfrom the quarries, or how they were ever raised to the dizzy heights they\r\noccupy in the temples.  And yet these sculptured blocks are trifles in\r\nsize compared with the rough-hewn blocks that form the wide verandah or\r\nplatform which surrounds the Great Temple.  One stretch of that platform,\r\ntwo hundred feet long, is composed of blocks of stone as large, and some\r\nof them larger, than a street-car.  They surmount a wall about ten or\r\ntwelve feet high.  I thought those were large rocks, but they sank into\r\ninsignificance compared with those which formed another section of the\r\nplatform.  These were three in number, and I thought that each of them\r\nwas about as long as three street cars placed end to end, though of\r\ncourse they are a third wider and a third higher than a street car.\r\nPerhaps two railway freight cars of the largest pattern, placed end to\r\nend, might better represent their size.  In combined length these three\r\nstones stretch nearly two hundred feet; they are thirteen feet square;\r\ntwo of them are sixty-four feet long each, and the third is sixty-nine.\r\nThey are built into the massive wall some twenty feet above the ground.\r\nThey are there, but how they got there is the question.  I have seen the\r\nhull of a steamboat that was smaller than one of those stones.  All these\r\ngreat walls are as exact and shapely as the flimsy things we build of\r\nbricks in these days.  A race of gods or of giants must have inhabited\r\nBaalbec many a century ago.  Men like the men of our day could hardly\r\nrear such temples as these.\r\n\r\nWe went to the quarry from whence the stones of Baalbec were taken.  It\r\nwas about a quarter of a mile off, and down hill.  In a great pit lay the\r\nmate of the largest stone in the ruins.  It lay there just as the giants\r\nof that old forgotten time had left it when they were called hence--just\r\nas they had left it, to remain for thousands of years, an eloquent rebuke\r\nunto such as are prone to think slightingly of the men who lived before\r\nthem.  This enormous block lies there, squared and ready for the\r\nbuilders' hands--a solid mass fourteen feet by seventeen, and but a few\r\ninches less than seventy feet long!  Two buggies could be driven abreast\r\nof each other, on its surface, from one end of it to the other, and leave\r\nroom enough for a man or two to walk on either side.\r\n\r\nOne might swear that all the John Smiths and George Wilkinsons, and all\r\nthe other pitiful nobodies between Kingdom Come and Baalbec would\r\ninscribe their poor little names upon the walls of Baalbec's magnificent\r\nruins, and would add the town, the county and the State they came from\r\n--and swearing thus, be infallibly correct.  It is a pity some great ruin\r\ndoes not fall in and flatten out some of these reptiles, and scare their\r\nkind out of ever giving their names to fame upon any walls or monuments\r\nagain, forever.\r\n\r\nProperly, with the sorry relics we bestrode, it was a three days' journey\r\nto Damascus.  It was necessary that we should do it in less than two.\r\nIt was necessary because our three pilgrims would not travel on the\r\nSabbath day.  We were all perfectly willing to keep the Sabbath day, but\r\nthere are times when to keep the letter of a sacred law whose spirit is\r\nrighteous, becomes a sin, and this was a case in point.  We pleaded for\r\nthe tired, ill-treated horses, and tried to show that their faithful\r\nservice deserved kindness in return, and their hard lot compassion.  But\r\nwhen did ever self-righteousness know the sentiment of pity?  What were a\r\nfew long hours added to the hardships of some over-taxed brutes when\r\nweighed against the peril of those human souls?  It was not the most\r\npromising party to travel with and hope to gain a higher veneration for\r\nreligion through the example of its devotees.  We said the Saviour who\r\npitied dumb beasts and taught that the ox must be rescued from the mire\r\neven on the Sabbath day, would not have counseled a forced march like\r\nthis.  We said the \xe2\x80\x9clong trip\xe2\x80\x9d was exhausting and therefore dangerous in\r\nthe blistering heats of summer, even when the ordinary days' stages were\r\ntraversed, and if we persisted in this hard march, some of us might be\r\nstricken down with the fevers of the country in consequence of it.\r\nNothing could move the pilgrims.  They must press on.  Men might die,\r\nhorses might die, but they must enter upon holy soil next week, with no\r\nSabbath-breaking stain upon them.  Thus they were willing to commit a sin\r\nagainst the spirit of religious law, in order that they might preserve\r\nthe letter of it.  It was not worth while to tell them \xe2\x80\x9cthe letter\r\nkills.\xe2\x80\x9d  I am talking now about personal friends; men whom I like; men\r\nwho are good citizens; who are honorable, upright, conscientious; but\r\nwhose idea of the Saviour's religion seems to me distorted.  They lecture\r\nour shortcomings unsparingly, and every night they call us together and\r\nread to us chapters from the Testament that are full of gentleness, of\r\ncharity, and of tender mercy; and then all the next day they stick to\r\ntheir saddles clear up to the summits of these rugged mountains, and\r\nclear down again.  Apply the Testament's gentleness, and charity, and\r\ntender mercy to a toiling, worn and weary horse?--Nonsense--these are for\r\nGod's human creatures, not His dumb ones.  What the pilgrims choose to\r\ndo, respect for their almost sacred character demands that I should allow\r\nto pass--but I would so like to catch any other member of the party\r\nriding his horse up one of these exhausting hills once!\r\n\r\nWe have given the pilgrims a good many examples that might benefit them,\r\nbut it is virtue thrown away.  They have never heard a cross word out of\r\nour lips toward each other--but they have quarreled once or twice.  We\r\nlove to hear them at it, after they have been lecturing us.  The very\r\nfirst thing they did, coming ashore at Beirout, was to quarrel in the\r\nboat.  I have said I like them, and I do like them--but every time they\r\nread me a scorcher of a lecture I mean to talk back in print.\r\n\r\nNot content with doubling the legitimate stages, they switched off the\r\nmain road and went away out of the way to visit an absurd fountain called\r\nFigia, because Baalam's ass had drank there once.  So we journeyed on,\r\nthrough the terrible hills and deserts and the roasting sun, and then far\r\ninto the night, seeking the honored pool of Baalam's ass, the patron\r\nsaint of all pilgrims like us.  I find no entry but this in my note-book:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cRode to-day, altogether, thirteen hours, through deserts, partly,\r\n     and partly over barren, unsightly hills, and latterly through wild,\r\n     rocky scenery, and camped at about eleven o'clock at night on the\r\n     banks of a limpid stream, near a Syrian village.  Do not know its\r\n     name--do not wish to know it--want to go to bed.  Two horses lame\r\n     (mine and Jack's) and the others worn out.  Jack and I walked three\r\n     or four miles, over the hills, and led the horses.  Fun--but of a\r\n     mild type.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwelve or thirteen hours in the saddle, even in a Christian land and a\r\nChristian climate, and on a good horse, is a tiresome journey; but in an\r\noven like Syria, in a ragged spoon of a saddle that slips fore-and-aft,\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cthort-ships,\xe2\x80\x9d and every way, and on a horse that is tired and lame,\r\nand yet must be whipped and spurred with hardly a moment's cessation all\r\nday long, till the blood comes from his side, and your conscience hurts\r\nyou every time you strike if you are half a man,--it is a journey to be\r\nremembered in bitterness of spirit and execrated with emphasis for a\r\nliberal division of a man's lifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nThe next day was an outrage upon men and horses both.  It was another\r\nthirteen-hour stretch (including an hour's \xe2\x80\x9cnooning.\xe2\x80\x9d) It was over the\r\nbarrenest chalk-hills and through the baldest canons that even Syria can\r\nshow.  The heat quivered in the air every where.  In the canons we almost\r\nsmothered in the baking atmosphere.  On high ground, the reflection from\r\nthe chalk-hills was blinding.  It was cruel to urge the crippled horses,\r\nbut it had to be done in order to make Damascus Saturday night.  We saw\r\nancient tombs and temples of fanciful architecture carved out of the\r\nsolid rock high up in the face of precipices above our heads, but we had\r\nneither time nor strength to climb up there and examine them.  The terse\r\nlanguage of my note-book will answer for the rest of this day's\r\nexperiences:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cBroke camp at 7 A.M., and made a ghastly trip through the Zeb Dana\r\n     valley and the rough mountains--horses limping and that Arab\r\n     screech-owl that does most of the singing and carries the\r\n     water-skins, always a thousand miles ahead, of course, and no water\r\n     to drink--will he never die?  Beautiful stream in a chasm, lined\r\n     thick with pomegranate, fig, olive and quince orchards, and nooned\r\n     an hour at the celebrated Baalam's Ass Fountain of Figia, second in\r\n     size in Syria, and the coldest water out of Siberia--guide-books do\r\n     not say Baalam's ass ever drank there--somebody been imposing on\r\n     the pilgrims, may be.  Bathed in it--Jack and I.  Only a\r\n     second--ice-water.  It is the principal source of the Abana river\r\n     --only one-half mile down to where it joins.  Beautiful\r\n     place--giant trees all around--so shady and cool, if one could keep\r\n     awake--vast stream gushes straight out from under the mountain in a\r\n     torrent.  Over it is a very ancient ruin, with no known history\r\n     --supposed to have been for the worship of the deity of the fountain\r\n     or Baalam's ass or somebody.  Wretched nest of human vermin about\r\n     the fountain--rags, dirt, sunken cheeks, pallor of sickness, sores,\r\n     projecting bones, dull, aching misery in their eyes and ravenous\r\n     hunger speaking from every eloquent fibre and muscle from head to\r\n     foot. How they sprang upon a bone, how they crunched the bread we\r\n     gave them!  Such as these to swarm about one and watch every bite\r\n     he takes, with greedy looks, and swallow unconsciously every time\r\n     he swallows, as if they half fancied the precious morsel went down\r\n     their own throats--hurry up the caravan!--I never shall enjoy a\r\n     meal in this distressful country.  To think of eating three times\r\n     every day under such circumstances for three weeks yet--it is worse\r\n     punishment than riding all day in the sun.  There are sixteen\r\n     starving babies from one to six years old in the party, and their\r\n     legs are no larger than broom handles.  Left the fountain at 1 P.M.\r\n     (the fountain took us at least two hours out of our way,) and\r\n     reached Mahomet's lookout perch, over Damascus, in time to get a\r\n     good long look before it was necessary to move on.  Tired?  Ask of\r\n     the winds that far away with fragments strewed the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the glare of day mellowed into twilight, we looked down upon a picture\r\nwhich is celebrated all over the world.  I think I have read about four\r\nhundred times that when Mahomet was a simple camel-driver he reached this\r\npoint and looked down upon Damascus for the first time, and then made a\r\ncertain renowned remark.  He said man could enter only one paradise; he\r\npreferred to go to the one above.  So he sat down there and feasted his\r\neyes upon the earthly paradise of Damascus, and then went away without\r\nentering its gates.  They have erected a tower on the hill to mark the\r\nspot where he stood.\r\n\r\nDamascus is beautiful from the mountain.  It is beautiful even to\r\nforeigners accustomed to luxuriant vegetation, and I can easily\r\nunderstand how unspeakably beautiful it must be to eyes that are only\r\nused to the God-forsaken barrenness and desolation of Syria.  I should\r\nthink a Syrian would go wild with ecstacy when such a picture bursts upon\r\nhim for the first time.\r\n\r\nFrom his high perch, one sees before him and below him, a wall of dreary\r\nmountains, shorn of vegetation, glaring fiercely in the sun; it fences in\r\na level desert of yellow sand, smooth as velvet and threaded far away\r\nwith fine lines that stand for roads, and dotted with creeping mites we\r\nknow are camel-trains and journeying men; right in the midst of the\r\ndesert is spread a billowy expanse of green foliage; and nestling in its\r\nheart sits the great white city, like an island of pearls and opals\r\ngleaming out of a sea of emeralds.  This is the picture you see spread\r\nfar below you, with distance to soften it, the sun to glorify it, strong\r\ncontrasts to heighten the effects, and over it and about it a drowsing\r\nair of repose to spiritualize it and make it seem rather a beautiful\r\nestray from the mysterious worlds we visit in dreams than a substantial\r\ntenant of our coarse, dull globe.  And when you think of the leagues of\r\nblighted, blasted, sandy, rocky, sun-burnt, ugly, dreary, infamous\r\ncountry you have ridden over to get here, you think it is the most\r\nbeautiful, beautiful picture that ever human eyes rested upon in all the\r\nbroad universe!  If I were to go to Damascus again, I would camp on\r\nMahomet's hill about a week, and then go away.  There is no need to go\r\ninside the walls.  The Prophet was wise without knowing it when he\r\ndecided not to go down into the paradise of Damascus.\r\n\r\nThere is an honored old tradition that the immense garden which Damascus\r\nstands in was the Garden of Eden, and modern writers have gathered up\r\nmany chapters of evidence tending to show that it really was the Garden\r\nof Eden, and that the rivers Pharpar and Abana are the \xe2\x80\x9ctwo rivers\xe2\x80\x9d that\r\nwatered Adam's Paradise.  It may be so, but it is not paradise now, and\r\none would be as happy outside of it as he would be likely to be within.\r\nIt is so crooked and cramped and dirty that one can not realize that he\r\nis in the splendid city he saw from the hill-top.  The gardens are hidden\r\nby high mud-walls, and the paradise is become a very sink of pollution\r\nand uncomeliness.  Damascus has plenty of clear, pure water in it,\r\nthough, and this is enough, of itself, to make an Arab think it beautiful\r\nand blessed.  Water is scarce in blistered Syria.  We run railways by our\r\nlarge cities in America; in Syria they curve the roads so as to make them\r\nrun by the meagre little puddles they call \xe2\x80\x9cfountains,\xe2\x80\x9d and which are not\r\nfound oftener on a journey than every four hours.  But the \xe2\x80\x9crivers\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nPharpar and Abana of Scripture (mere creeks,) run through Damascus, and\r\nso every house and every garden have their sparkling fountains and\r\nrivulets of water.  With her forest of foliage and her abundance of\r\nwater, Damascus must be a wonder of wonders to the Bedouin from the\r\ndeserts.  Damascus is simply an oasis--that is what it is.  For four\r\nthousand years its waters have not gone dry or its fertility failed.\r\nNow we can understand why the city has existed so long.  It could not\r\ndie.  So long as its waters remain to it away out there in the midst of\r\nthat howling desert, so long will Damascus live to bless the sight of the\r\ntired and thirsty wayfarer.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThough old as history itself, thou art fresh as the breath of\r\n     spring, blooming as thine own rose-bud, and fragrant as thine own\r\n     orange flower, O Damascus, pearl of the East!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDamascus dates back anterior to the days of Abraham, and is the oldest\r\ncity in the world.  It was founded by Uz, the grandson of Noah.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nearly history of Damascus is shrouded in the mists of a hoary antiquity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Leave the matters written of in the first eleven chapters of the Old\r\nTestament out, and no recorded event has occurred in the world but\r\nDamascus was in existence to receive the news of it.  Go back as far as\r\nyou will into the vague past, there was always a Damascus.  In the\r\nwritings of every century for more than four thousand years, its name has\r\nbeen mentioned and its praises sung.  To Damascus, years are only\r\nmoments, decades are only flitting trifles of time.  She measures time,\r\nnot by days and months and years, but by the empires she has seen rise,\r\nand prosper and crumble to ruin.  She is a type of immortality.  She saw\r\nthe foundations of Baalbec, and Thebes, and Ephesus laid; she saw these\r\nvillages grow into mighty cities, and amaze the world with their\r\ngrandeur--and she has lived to see them desolate, deserted, and given\r\nover to the owls and the bats.  She saw the Israelitish empire exalted,\r\nand she saw it annihilated.  She saw Greece rise, and flourish two\r\nthousand years, and die.  In her old age she saw Rome built; she saw it\r\novershadow the world with its power; she saw it perish.  The few hundreds\r\nof years of Genoese and Venetian might and splendor were, to grave old\r\nDamascus, only a trifling scintillation hardly worth remembering.\r\nDamascus has seen all that has ever occurred on earth, and still she\r\nlives.  She has looked upon the dry bones of a thousand empires, and will\r\nsee the tombs of a thousand more before she dies.  Though another claims\r\nthe name, old Damascus is by right the Eternal City.\r\n\r\nWe reached the city gates just at sundown.  They do say that one can get\r\ninto any walled city of Syria, after night, for bucksheesh, except\r\nDamascus.  But Damascus, with its four thousand years of respectability\r\nin the world, has many old fogy notions.  There are no street lamps\r\nthere, and the law compels all who go abroad at night to carry lanterns,\r\njust as was the case in old days, when heroes and heroines of the Arabian\r\nNights walked the streets of Damascus, or flew away toward Bagdad on\r\nenchanted carpets.\r\n\r\nIt was fairly dark a few minutes after we got within the wall, and we\r\nrode long distances through wonderfully crooked streets, eight to ten\r\nfeet wide, and shut in on either side by the high mud-walls of the\r\ngardens.  At last we got to where lanterns could be seen flitting about\r\nhere and there, and knew we were in the midst of the curious old city.\r\nIn a little narrow street, crowded with our pack-mules and with a swarm\r\nof uncouth Arabs, we alighted, and through a kind of a hole in the wall\r\nentered the hotel.  We stood in a great flagged court, with flowers and\r\ncitron trees about us, and a huge tank in the centre that was receiving\r\nthe waters of many pipes.  We crossed the court and entered the rooms\r\nprepared to receive four of us.  In a large marble-paved recess between\r\nthe two rooms was a tank of clear, cool water, which was kept running\r\nover all the time by the streams that were pouring into it from half a\r\ndozen pipes.  Nothing, in this scorching, desolate land could look so\r\nrefreshing as this pure water flashing in the lamp-light; nothing could\r\nlook so beautiful, nothing could sound so delicious as this mimic rain to\r\nears long unaccustomed to sounds of such a nature.  Our rooms were large,\r\ncomfortably furnished, and even had their floors clothed with soft,\r\ncheerful-tinted carpets.  It was a pleasant thing to see a carpet again,\r\nfor if there is any thing drearier than the tomb-like, stone-paved\r\nparlors and bed-rooms of Europe and Asia, I do not know what it is.\r\nThey make one think of the grave all the time.  A very broad, gaily\r\ncaparisoned divan, some twelve or fourteen feet long, extended across one\r\nside of each room, and opposite were single beds with spring mattresses.\r\nThere were great looking-glasses and marble-top tables.  All this luxury\r\nwas as grateful to systems and senses worn out with an exhausting day's\r\ntravel, as it was unexpected--for one can not tell what to expect in a\r\nTurkish city of even a quarter of a million inhabitants.\r\n\r\nI do not know, but I think they used that tank between the rooms to draw\r\ndrinking water from; that did not occur to me, however, until I had\r\ndipped my baking head far down into its cool depths.  I thought of it\r\nthen, and superb as the bath was, I was sorry I had taken it, and was\r\nabout to go and explain to the landlord.  But a finely curled and scented\r\npoodle dog frisked up and nipped the calf of my leg just then, and before\r\nI had time to think, I had soused him to the bottom of the tank, and when\r\nI saw a servant coming with a pitcher I went off and left the pup trying\r\nto climb out and not succeeding very well.  Satisfied revenge was all I\r\nneeded to make me perfectly happy, and when I walked in to supper that\r\nfirst night in Damascus I was in that condition.  We lay on those divans\r\na long time, after supper, smoking narghilies and long-stemmed chibouks,\r\nand talking about the dreadful ride of the day, and I knew then what I\r\nhad sometimes known before--that it is worth while to get tired out,\r\nbecause one so enjoys resting afterward.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we sent for donkeys.  It is worthy of note that we had to\r\nsend for these things.  I said Damascus was an old fossil, and she is.\r\nAny where else we would have been assailed by a clamorous army of\r\ndonkey-drivers, guides, peddlers and beggars--but in Damascus they so\r\nhate the very sight of a foreign Christian that they want no intercourse\r\nwhatever with him; only a year or two ago, his person was not always\r\nsafe in Damascus streets.  It is the most fanatical Mohammedan purgatory\r\nout of Arabia.  Where you see one green turban of a Hadji elsewhere (the\r\nhonored sign that my lord has made the pilgrimage to Mecca,) I think you\r\nwill see a dozen in Damascus.  The Damascenes are the ugliest, wickedest\r\nlooking villains we have seen.  All the veiled women we had seen yet,\r\nnearly, left their eyes exposed, but numbers of these in Damascus\r\ncompletely hid the face under a close-drawn black veil that made the\r\nwoman look like a mummy.  If ever we caught an eye exposed it was\r\nquickly hidden from our contaminating Christian vision; the beggars\r\nactually passed us by without demanding bucksheesh; the merchants in the\r\nbazaars did not hold up their goods and cry out eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cHey, John!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n or \xe2\x80\x9cLook this, Howajji!\xe2\x80\x9d  On the contrary, they only scowled at us and\r\nsaid never a word.\r\n\r\nThe narrow streets swarmed like a hive with men and women in strange\r\nOriental costumes, and our small donkeys knocked them right and left as\r\nwe plowed through them, urged on by the merciless donkey-boys.  These\r\npersecutors run after the animals, shouting and goading them for hours\r\ntogether; they keep the donkey in a gallop always, yet never get tired\r\nthemselves or fall behind.  The donkeys fell down and spilt us over their\r\nheads occasionally, but there was nothing for it but to mount and hurry\r\non again.  We were banged against sharp corners, loaded porters, camels,\r\nand citizens generally; and we were so taken up with looking out for\r\ncollisions and casualties that we had no chance to look about us at all.\r\nWe rode half through the city and through the famous \xe2\x80\x9cstreet which is\r\ncalled Straight\xe2\x80\x9d without seeing any thing, hardly.  Our bones were nearly\r\nknocked out of joint, we were wild with excitement, and our sides ached\r\nwith the jolting we had suffered.  I do not like riding in the Damascus\r\nstreet-cars.\r\n\r\nWe were on our way to the reputed houses of Judas and Ananias.  About\r\neighteen or nineteen hundred years ago, Saul, a native of Tarsus, was\r\nparticularly bitter against the new sect called Christians, and he left\r\nJerusalem and started across the country on a furious crusade against\r\nthem.  He went forth \xe2\x80\x9cbreathing threatenings and slaughter against the\r\ndisciples of the Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAnd as he journeyed, he came near Damascus, and suddenly there\r\n     shined round about him a light from heaven:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him, 'Saul,\r\n     Saul, why persecutest thou me?'\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when he knew that it was Jesus that spoke to him he trembled,\r\n     and was astonished, and said, 'Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was told to arise and go into the ancient city and one would tell\r\nhim what to do.  In the meantime his soldiers stood speechless and\r\nawe-stricken, for they heard the mysterious voice but saw no man.  Saul\r\nrose up and found that that fierce supernatural light had destroyed his\r\nsight, and he was blind, so \xe2\x80\x9cthey led him by the hand and brought him to\r\nDamascus.\xe2\x80\x9d  He was converted.\r\n\r\nPaul lay three days, blind, in the house of Judas, and during that time\r\nhe neither ate nor drank.\r\n\r\nThere came a voice to a citizen of Damascus, named Ananias, saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire at\r\nthe house of Judas, for one called Saul, of Tarsus; for behold, he\r\nprayeth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnanias did not wish to go at first, for he had heard of Saul before, and\r\nhe had his doubts about that style of a \xe2\x80\x9cchosen vessel\xe2\x80\x9d to preach the\r\ngospel of peace.  However, in obedience to orders, he went into the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstreet called Straight\xe2\x80\x9d (how he found his way into it, and after he did,\r\nhow he ever found his way out of it again, are mysteries only to be\r\naccounted for by the fact that he was acting under Divine inspiration.)\r\nHe found Paul and restored him, and ordained him a preacher; and from\r\nthis old house we had hunted up in the street which is miscalled\r\nStraight, he had started out on that bold missionary career which he\r\nprosecuted till his death.  It was not the house of the disciple who sold\r\nthe Master for thirty pieces of silver.  I make this explanation in\r\njustice to Judas, who was a far different sort of man from the person\r\njust referred to.  A very different style of man, and lived in a very\r\ngood house.  It is a pity we do not know more about him.\r\n\r\nI have given, in the above paragraphs, some more information for people\r\nwho will not read Bible history until they are defrauded into it by some\r\nsuch method as this.  I hope that no friend of progress and education\r\nwill obstruct or interfere with my peculiar mission.\r\n\r\nThe street called Straight is straighter than a corkscrew, but not as\r\nstraight as a rainbow.  St. Luke is careful not to commit himself; he\r\ndoes not say it is the street which is straight, but the \xe2\x80\x9cstreet which is\r\ncalled Straight.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is a fine piece of irony; it is the only facetious\r\nremark in the Bible, I believe.  We traversed the street called Straight\r\na good way, and then turned off and called at the reputed house of\r\nAnanias.  There is small question that a part of the original house is\r\nthere still; it is an old room twelve or fifteen feet under ground, and\r\nits masonry is evidently ancient.  If Ananias did not live there in St.\r\nPaul's time, somebody else did, which is just as well.  I took a drink\r\nout of Ananias' well, and singularly enough, the water was just as fresh\r\nas if the well had been dug yesterday.\r\n\r\nWe went out toward the north end of the city to see the place where the\r\ndisciples let Paul down over the Damascus wall at dead of night--for he\r\npreached Christ so fearlessly in Damascus that the people sought to kill\r\nhim, just as they would to-day for the same offense, and he had to escape\r\nand flee to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThen we called at the tomb of Mahomet's children and at a tomb which\r\npurported to be that of St. George who killed the dragon, and so on out\r\nto the hollow place under a rock where Paul hid during his flight till\r\nhis pursuers gave him up; and to the mausoleum of the five thousand\r\nChristians who were massacred in Damascus in 1861 by the Turks.  They say\r\nthose narrow streets ran blood for several days, and that men, women and\r\nchildren were butchered indiscriminately and left to rot by hundreds all\r\nthrough the Christian quarter; they say, further, that the stench was\r\ndreadful.  All the Christians who could get away fled from the city, and\r\nthe Mohammedans would not defile their hands by burying the \xe2\x80\x9cinfidel\r\ndogs.\xe2\x80\x9d  The thirst for blood extended to the high lands of Hermon and\r\nAnti-Lebanon, and in a short time twenty-five thousand more Christians\r\nwere massacred and their possessions laid waste.  How they hate a\r\nChristian in Damascus!--and pretty much all over Turkeydom as well.  And\r\nhow they will pay for it when Russia turns her guns upon them again!\r\n\r\nIt is soothing to the heart to abuse England and France for interposing\r\nto save the Ottoman Empire from the destruction it has so richly deserved\r\nfor a thousand years.  It hurts my vanity to see these pagans refuse to\r\neat of food that has been cooked for us; or to eat from a dish we have\r\neaten from; or to drink from a goatskin which we have polluted with our\r\nChristian lips, except by filtering the water through a rag which they\r\nput over the mouth of it or through a sponge!  I never disliked a\r\nChinaman as I do these degraded Turks and Arabs, and when Russia is ready\r\nto war with them again, I hope England and France will not find it good\r\nbreeding or good judgment to interfere.\r\n\r\nIn Damascus they think there are no such rivers in all the world as their\r\nlittle Abana and Pharpar.  The Damascenes have always thought that way.\r\nIn 2 Kings, chapter v., Naaman boasts extravagantly about them.  That was\r\nthree thousand years ago.  He says: \xe2\x80\x9cAre not Abana and Pharpar rivers of\r\nDamascus, better than all the waters of Israel?  May I not wash in them\r\nand be clean?\xe2\x80\x9d  But some of my readers have forgotten who Naaman was,\r\nlong ago.  Naaman was the commander of the Syrian armies.  He was the\r\nfavorite of the king and lived in great state.  \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a mighty man of\r\nvalor, but he was a leper.\xe2\x80\x9d  Strangely enough, the house they point out\r\nto you now as his, has been turned into a leper hospital, and the inmates\r\nexpose their horrid deformities and hold up their hands and beg for\r\nbucksheesh when a stranger enters.\r\n\r\nOne can not appreciate the horror of this disease until he looks upon it\r\nin all its ghastliness, in Naaman's ancient dwelling in Damascus.  Bones\r\nall twisted out of shape, great knots protruding from face and body,\r\njoints decaying and dropping away--horrible!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nThe last twenty-four hours we staid in Damascus I lay prostrate with a\r\nviolent attack of cholera, or cholera morbus, and therefore had a good\r\nchance and a good excuse to lie there on that wide divan and take an\r\nhonest rest.  I had nothing to do but listen to the pattering of the\r\nfountains and take medicine and throw it up again.  It was dangerous\r\nrecreation, but it was pleasanter than traveling in Syria.  I had plenty\r\nof snow from Mount Hermon, and as it would not stay on my stomach, there\r\nwas nothing to interfere with my eating it--there was always room for\r\nmore.  I enjoyed myself very well.  Syrian travel has its interesting\r\nfeatures, like travel in any other part of the world, and yet to break\r\nyour leg or have the cholera adds a welcome variety to it.\r\n\r\nWe left Damascus at noon and rode across the plain a couple of hours, and\r\nthen the party stopped a while in the shade of some fig-trees to give me\r\na chance to rest.  It was the hottest day we had seen yet--the sun-flames\r\nshot down like the shafts of fire that stream out before a blow-pipe--the\r\nrays seemed to fall in a steady deluge on the head and pass downward like\r\nrain from a roof.  I imagined I could distinguish between the floods of\r\nrays--I thought I could tell when each flood struck my head, when it\r\nreached my shoulders, and when the next one came.  It was terrible.  All\r\nthe desert glared so fiercely that my eyes were swimming in tears all the\r\ntime.  The boys had white umbrellas heavily lined with dark green.  They\r\nwere a priceless blessing.  I thanked fortune that I had one, too,\r\nnotwithstanding it was packed up with the baggage and was ten miles\r\nahead.  It is madness to travel in Syria without an umbrella.  They told\r\nme in Beirout (these people who always gorge you with advice) that it was\r\nmadness to travel in Syria without an umbrella.  It was on this account\r\nthat I got one.\r\n\r\nBut, honestly, I think an umbrella is a nuisance any where when its\r\nbusiness is to keep the sun off.  No Arab wears a brim to his fez, or\r\nuses an umbrella, or any thing to shade his eyes or his face, and he\r\nalways looks comfortable and proper in the sun.  But of all the\r\nridiculous sights I ever have seen, our party of eight is the most so\r\n--they do cut such an outlandish figure.  They travel single file; they all\r\nwear the endless white rag of Constantinople wrapped round and round\r\ntheir hats and dangling down their backs; they all wear thick green\r\nspectacles, with side-glasses to them; they all hold white umbrellas,\r\nlined with green, over their heads; without exception their stirrups are\r\ntoo short--they are the very worst gang of horsemen on earth, their\r\nanimals to a horse trot fearfully hard--and when they get strung out one\r\nafter the other; glaring straight ahead and breathless; bouncing high and\r\nout of turn, all along the line; knees well up and stiff, elbows flapping\r\nlike a rooster's that is going to crow, and the long file of umbrellas\r\npopping convulsively up and down--when one sees this outrageous picture\r\nexposed to the light of day, he is amazed that the gods don't get out\r\ntheir thunderbolts and destroy them off the face of the earth!  I do--I\r\nwonder at it.  I wouldn't let any such caravan go through a country of\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nAnd when the sun drops below the horizon and the boys close their\r\numbrellas and put them under their arms, it is only a variation of the\r\npicture, not a modification of its absurdity.\r\n\r\nBut may be you can not see the wild extravagance of my panorama.  You\r\ncould if you were here.  Here, you feel all the time just as if you were\r\nliving about the year 1200 before Christ--or back to the patriarchs--or\r\nforward to the New Era.  The scenery of the Bible is about you--the\r\ncustoms of the patriarchs are around you--the same people, in the same\r\nflowing robes, and in sandals, cross your path--the same long trains of\r\nstately camels go and come--the same impressive religious solemnity and\r\nsilence rest upon the desert and the mountains that were upon them in the\r\nremote ages of antiquity, and behold, intruding upon a scene like this,\r\ncomes this fantastic mob of green-spectacled Yanks, with their flapping\r\nelbows and bobbing umbrellas!  It is Daniel in the lion's den with a\r\ngreen cotton umbrella under his arm, all over again.\r\n\r\nMy umbrella is with the baggage, and so are my green spectacles--and\r\nthere they shall stay.  I will not use them.  I will show some respect\r\nfor the eternal fitness of things.  It will be bad enough to get\r\nsun-struck, without looking ridiculous into the bargain.  If I fall,\r\nlet me fall bearing about me the semblance of a Christian, at least.\r\n\r\nThree or four hours out from Damascus we passed the spot where Saul was\r\nso abruptly converted, and from this place we looked back over the\r\nscorching desert, and had our last glimpse of beautiful Damascus, decked\r\nin its robes of shining green.  After nightfall we reached our tents,\r\njust outside of the nasty Arab village of Jonesborough.  Of course the\r\nreal name of the place is El something or other, but the boys still\r\nrefuse to recognize the Arab names or try to pronounce them.  When I say\r\nthat that village is of the usual style, I mean to insinuate that all\r\nSyrian villages within fifty miles of Damascus are alike--so much alike\r\nthat it would require more than human intelligence to tell wherein one\r\ndiffered from another.  A Syrian village is a hive of huts one story high\r\n(the height of a man,) and as square as a dry-goods box; it is\r\nmud-plastered all over, flat roof and all, and generally whitewashed\r\nafter a fashion.  The same roof often extends over half the town,\r\ncovering many of the streets, which are generally about a yard wide.\r\nWhen you ride through one of these villages at noon-day, you first meet\r\na melancholy dog, that looks up at you and silently begs that you won't\r\nrun over him, but he does not offer to get out of the way; next you meet\r\na young boy without any clothes on, and he holds out his hand and says\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBucksheesh!\xe2\x80\x9d--he don't really expect a cent, but then he learned to\r\nsay that before he learned to say mother, and now he can not break\r\nhimself of it; next you meet a woman with a black veil drawn closely\r\nover her face, and her bust exposed; finally, you come to several\r\nsore-eyed children and children in all stages of mutilation and decay;\r\nand sitting humbly in the dust, and all fringed with filthy rags, is a\r\npoor devil whose arms and legs are gnarled and twisted like grape-vines.\r\nThese are all the people you are likely to see.  The balance of the\r\npopulation are asleep within doors, or abroad tending goats in the\r\nplains and on the hill-sides.  The village is built on some consumptive\r\nlittle water-course, and about it is a little fresh-looking vegetation.\r\nBeyond this charmed circle, for miles on every side, stretches a weary\r\ndesert of sand and gravel, which produces a gray bunchy shrub like\r\nsage-brush.  A Syrian village is the sorriest sight in the world, and\r\nits surroundings are eminently in keeping with it.\r\n\r\nI would not have gone into this dissertation upon Syrian villages but for\r\nthe fact that Nimrod, the Mighty Hunter of Scriptural notoriety, is\r\nburied in Jonesborough, and I wished the public to know about how he is\r\nlocated.  Like Homer, he is said to be buried in many other places, but\r\nthis is the only true and genuine place his ashes inhabit.\r\n\r\nWhen the original tribes were dispersed, more than four thousand years\r\nago, Nimrod and a large party traveled three or four hundred miles, and\r\nsettled where the great city of Babylon afterwards stood.  Nimrod built\r\nthat city.  He also began to build the famous Tower of Babel, but\r\ncircumstances over which he had no control put it out of his power to\r\nfinish it.  He ran it up eight stories high, however, and two of them\r\nstill stand, at this day--a colossal mass of brickwork, rent down the\r\ncentre by earthquakes, and seared and vitrified by the lightnings of an\r\nangry God.  But the vast ruin will still stand for ages, to shame the\r\npuny labors of these modern generations of men.  Its huge compartments\r\nare tenanted by owls and lions, and old Nimrod lies neglected in this\r\nwretched village, far from the scene of his grand enterprise.\r\n\r\nWe left Jonesborough very early in the morning, and rode forever and\r\nforever and forever, it seemed to me, over parched deserts and rocky\r\nhills, hungry, and with no water to drink.  We had drained the goat-skins\r\ndry in a little while.  At noon we halted before the wretched Arab town\r\nof El Yuba Dam, perched on the side of a mountain, but the dragoman said\r\nif we applied there for water we would be attacked by the whole tribe,\r\nfor they did not love Christians.  We had to journey on.  Two hours later\r\nwe reached the foot of a tall isolated mountain, which is crowned by the\r\ncrumbling castle of Banias, the stateliest ruin of that kind on earth, no\r\ndoubt.  It is a thousand feet long and two hundred wide, all of the most\r\nsymmetrical, and at the same time the most ponderous masonry.  The\r\nmassive towers and bastions are more than thirty feet high, and have been\r\nsixty.  From the mountain's peak its broken turrets rise above the groves\r\nof ancient oaks and olives, and look wonderfully picturesque.  It is of\r\nsuch high antiquity that no man knows who built it or when it was built.\r\nIt is utterly inaccessible, except in one place, where a bridle-path\r\nwinds upward among the solid rocks to the old portcullis.  The horses'\r\nhoofs have bored holes in these rocks to the depth of six inches during\r\nthe hundreds and hundreds of years that the castle was garrisoned.  We\r\nwandered for three hours among the chambers and crypts and dungeons of\r\nthe fortress, and trod where the mailed heels of many a knightly Crusader\r\nhad rang, and where Phenician heroes had walked ages before them.\r\n\r\nWe wondered how such a solid mass of masonry could be affected even by an\r\nearthquake, and could not understand what agency had made Banias a ruin;\r\nbut we found the destroyer, after a while, and then our wonder was\r\nincreased tenfold.  Seeds had fallen in crevices in the vast walls; the\r\nseeds had sprouted; the tender, insignificant sprouts had hardened; they\r\ngrew larger and larger, and by a steady, imperceptible pressure forced\r\nthe great stones apart, and now are bringing sure destruction upon a\r\ngiant work that has even mocked the earthquakes to scorn!  Gnarled and\r\ntwisted trees spring from the old walls every where, and beautify and\r\novershadow the gray battlements with a wild luxuriance of foliage.\r\n\r\nFrom these old towers we looked down upon a broad, far-reaching green\r\nplain, glittering with the pools and rivulets which are the sources of\r\nthe sacred river Jordan.  It was a grateful vision, after so much desert.\r\n\r\nAnd as the evening drew near, we clambered down the mountain, through\r\ngroves of the Biblical oaks of Bashan, (for we were just stepping over\r\nthe border and entering the long-sought Holy Land,) and at its extreme\r\nfoot, toward the wide valley, we entered this little execrable village of\r\nBanias and camped in a great grove of olive trees near a torrent of\r\nsparkling water whose banks are arrayed in fig-trees, pomegranates and\r\noleanders in full leaf.  Barring the proximity of the village, it is a\r\nsort of paradise.\r\n\r\nThe very first thing one feels like doing when he gets into camp, all\r\nburning up and dusty, is to hunt up a bath.  We followed the stream up to\r\nwhere it gushes out of the mountain side, three hundred yards from the\r\ntents, and took a bath that was so icy that if I did not know this was\r\nthe main source of the sacred river, I would expect harm to come of it.\r\nIt was bathing at noonday in the chilly source of the Abana, \xe2\x80\x9cRiver of\r\nDamascus,\xe2\x80\x9d that gave me the cholera, so Dr. B.  said.  However, it\r\ngenerally does give me the cholera to take a bath.\r\n\r\nThe incorrigible pilgrims have come in with their pockets full of\r\nspecimens broken from the ruins.  I wish this vandalism could be stopped.\r\nThey broke off fragments from Noah's tomb; from the exquisite sculptures\r\nof the temples of Baalbec; from the houses of Judas and Ananias, in\r\nDamascus; from the tomb of Nimrod the Mighty Hunter in Jonesborough; from\r\nthe worn Greek and Roman inscriptions set in the hoary walls of the\r\nCastle of Banias; and now they have been hacking and chipping these old\r\narches here that Jesus looked upon in the flesh.  Heaven protect the\r\nSepulchre when this tribe invades Jerusalem!\r\n\r\nThe ruins here are not very interesting.  There are the massive walls of\r\na great square building that was once the citadel; there are many\r\nponderous old arches that are so smothered with debris that they barely\r\nproject above the ground; there are heavy-walled sewers through which the\r\ncrystal brook of which Jordan is born still runs; in the hill-side are\r\nthe substructions of a costly marble temple that Herod the Great built\r\nhere--patches of its handsome mosaic floors still remain; there is a\r\nquaint old stone bridge that was here before Herod's time, may be;\r\nscattered every where, in the paths and in the woods, are Corinthian\r\ncapitals, broken porphyry pillars, and little fragments of sculpture; and\r\nup yonder in the precipice where the fountain gushes out, are well-worn\r\nGreek inscriptions over niches in the rock where in ancient times the\r\nGreeks, and after them the Romans, worshipped the sylvan god Pan.  But\r\ntrees and bushes grow above many of these ruins now; the miserable huts\r\nof a little crew of filthy Arabs are perched upon the broken masonry of\r\nantiquity, the whole place has a sleepy, stupid, rural look about it, and\r\none can hardly bring himself to believe that a busy, substantially built\r\ncity once existed here, even two thousand years ago.  The place was\r\nnevertheless the scene of an event whose effects have added page after\r\npage and volume after volume to the world's history.  For in this place\r\nChrist stood when he said to Peter:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThou art Peter; and upon this rock will I build my church, and the\r\n     gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  And I will give unto\r\n     thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt\r\n     bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt\r\n     loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn those little sentences have been built up the mighty edifice of the\r\nChurch of Rome; in them lie the authority for the imperial power of the\r\nPopes over temporal affairs, and their godlike power to curse a soul or\r\nwash it white from sin.  To sustain the position of \xe2\x80\x9cthe only true\r\nChurch,\xe2\x80\x9d which Rome claims was thus conferred upon her, she has fought\r\nand labored and struggled for many a century, and will continue to keep\r\nherself busy in the same work to the end of time.  The memorable words I\r\nhave quoted give to this ruined city about all the interest it possesses\r\nto people of the present day.\r\n\r\nIt seems curious enough to us to be standing on ground that was once\r\nactually pressed by the feet of the Saviour.  The situation is suggestive\r\nof a reality and a tangibility that seem at variance with the vagueness\r\nand mystery and ghostliness that one naturally attaches to the character\r\nof a god.  I can not comprehend yet that I am sitting where a god has\r\nstood, and looking upon the brook and the mountains which that god looked\r\nupon, and am surrounded by dusky men and women whose ancestors saw him,\r\nand even talked with him, face to face, and carelessly, just as they\r\nwould have done with any other stranger.  I can not comprehend this; the\r\ngods of my understanding have been always hidden in clouds and very far\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThis morning, during breakfast, the usual assemblage of squalid humanity\r\nsat patiently without the charmed circle of the camp and waited for such\r\ncrumbs as pity might bestow upon their misery.  There were old and young,\r\nbrown-skinned and yellow.  Some of the men were tall and stalwart, (for\r\none hardly sees any where such splendid-looking men as here in the East,)\r\nbut all the women and children looked worn and sad, and distressed with\r\nhunger.  They reminded me much of Indians, did these people.  They had\r\nbut little clothing, but such as they had was fanciful in character and\r\nfantastic in its arrangement.  Any little absurd gewgaw or gimcrack they\r\nhad they disposed in such a way as to make it attract attention most\r\nreadily.  They sat in silence, and with tireless patience watched our\r\nevery motion with that vile, uncomplaining impoliteness which is so truly\r\nIndian, and which makes a white man so nervous and uncomfortable and\r\nsavage that he wants to exterminate the whole tribe.\r\n\r\nThese people about us had other peculiarities, which I have noticed in\r\nthe noble red man, too: they were infested with vermin, and the dirt had\r\ncaked on them till it amounted to bark.\r\n\r\nThe little children were in a pitiable condition--they all had sore eyes,\r\nand were otherwise afflicted in various ways.  They say that hardly a\r\nnative child in all the East is free from sore eyes, and that thousands\r\nof them go blind of one eye or both every year.  I think this must be so,\r\nfor I see plenty of blind people every day, and I do not remember seeing\r\nany children that hadn't sore eyes.  And, would you suppose that an\r\nAmerican mother could sit for an hour, with her child in her arms, and\r\nlet a hundred flies roost upon its eyes all that time undisturbed?  I see\r\nthat every day.  It makes my flesh creep.  Yesterday we met a woman\r\nriding on a little jackass, and she had a little child in her arms\r\n--honestly, I thought the child had goggles on as we approached, and I\r\nwondered how its mother could afford so much style.  But when we drew\r\nnear, we saw that the goggles were nothing but a camp meeting of flies\r\nassembled around each of the child's eyes, and at the same time there was\r\na detachment prospecting its nose.  The flies were happy, the child was\r\ncontented, and so the mother did not interfere.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the tribe found out that we had a doctor in our party, they\r\nbegan to flock in from all quarters.  Dr. B., in the charity of his\r\nnature, had taken a child from a woman who sat near by, and put some sort\r\nof a wash upon its diseased eyes.  That woman went off and started the\r\nwhole nation, and it was a sight to see them swarm!  The lame, the halt,\r\nthe blind, the leprous--all the distempers that are bred of indolence,\r\ndirt, and iniquity--were represented in the Congress in ten minutes, and\r\nstill they came!  Every woman that had a sick baby brought it along, and\r\nevery woman that hadn't, borrowed one.  What reverent and what worshiping\r\nlooks they bent upon that dread, mysterious power, the Doctor!  They\r\nwatched him take his phials out; they watched him measure the particles\r\nof white powder; they watched him add drops of one precious liquid, and\r\ndrops of another; they lost not the slightest movement; their eyes were\r\nriveted upon him with a fascination that nothing could distract.\r\nI believe they thought he was gifted like a god.  When each individual\r\ngot his portion of medicine, his eyes were radiant with joy\r\n--notwithstanding by nature they are a thankless and impassive race--and\r\nupon his face was written the unquestioning faith that nothing on earth\r\ncould prevent the patient from getting well now.\r\n\r\nChrist knew how to preach to these simple, superstitious,\r\ndisease-tortured creatures: He healed the sick.  They flocked to our\r\npoor human doctor this morning when the fame of what he had done to the\r\nsick child went abroad in the land, and they worshiped him with their\r\neyes while they did not know as yet whether there was virtue in his\r\nsimples or not. The ancestors of these--people precisely like them in\r\ncolor, dress, manners, customs, simplicity--flocked in vast multitudes\r\nafter Christ, and when they saw Him make the afflicted whole with a\r\nword, it is no wonder they worshiped Him.  No wonder His deeds were the\r\ntalk of the nation.  No wonder the multitude that followed Him was so\r\ngreat that at one time--thirty miles from here--they had to let a sick\r\nman down through the roof because no approach could be made to the door;\r\nno wonder His audiences were so great at Galilee that He had to preach\r\nfrom a ship removed a little distance from the shore; no wonder that\r\neven in the desert places about Bethsaida, five thousand invaded His\r\nsolitude, and He had to feed them by a miracle or else see them suffer\r\nfor their confiding faith and devotion; no wonder when there was a great\r\ncommotion in a city in those days, one neighbor explained it to another\r\nin words to this effect: \xe2\x80\x9cThey say that Jesus of Nazareth is come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, as I was saying, the doctor distributed medicine as long as he had\r\nany to distribute, and his reputation is mighty in Galilee this day.\r\nAmong his patients was the child of the Shiek's daughter--for even this\r\npoor, ragged handful of sores and sin has its royal Shiek--a poor old\r\nmummy that looked as if he would be more at home in a poor-house than in\r\nthe Chief Magistracy of this tribe of hopeless, shirtless savages.  The\r\nprincess--I mean the Shiek's daughter--was only thirteen or fourteen\r\nyears old, and had a very sweet face and a pretty one.  She was the only\r\nSyrian female we have seen yet who was not so sinfully ugly that she\r\ncouldn't smile after ten o'clock Saturday night without breaking the\r\nSabbath.  Her child was a hard specimen, though--there wasn't enough of\r\nit to make a pie, and the poor little thing looked so pleadingly up at\r\nall who came near it (as if it had an idea that now was its chance or\r\nnever,) that we were filled with compassion which was genuine and not put\r\non.\r\n\r\nBut this last new horse I have got is trying to break his neck over the\r\ntent-ropes, and I shall have to go out and anchor him.  Jericho and I\r\nhave parted company.  The new horse is not much to boast of, I think.\r\nOne of his hind legs bends the wrong way, and the other one is as\r\nstraight and stiff as a tent-pole.  Most of his teeth are gone, and he is\r\nas blind as bat.  His nose has been broken at some time or other, and is\r\narched like a culvert now.  His under lip hangs down like a camel's, and\r\nhis ears are chopped off close to his head.  I had some trouble at first\r\nto find a name for him, but I finally concluded to call him Baalbec,\r\nbecause he is such a magnificent ruin.  I can not keep from talking about\r\nmy horses, because I have a very long and tedious journey before me, and\r\nthey naturally occupy my thoughts about as much as matters of apparently\r\nmuch greater importance.\r\n\r\nWe satisfied our pilgrims by making those hard rides from Baalbec to\r\nDamascus, but Dan's horse and Jack's were so crippled we had to leave\r\nthem behind and get fresh animals for them.  The dragoman says Jack's\r\nhorse died.  I swapped horses with Mohammed, the kingly-looking Egyptian\r\nwho is our Ferguson's lieutenant.  By Ferguson I mean our dragoman\r\nAbraham, of course.  I did not take this horse on account of his personal\r\nappearance, but because I have not seen his back.  I do not wish to see\r\nit.  I have seen the backs of all the other horses, and found most of\r\nthem covered with dreadful saddle-boils which I know have not been washed\r\nor doctored for years.  The idea of riding all day long over such ghastly\r\ninquisitions of torture is sickening.  My horse must be like the others,\r\nbut I have at least the consolation of not knowing it to be so.\r\n\r\nI hope that in future I may be spared any more sentimental praises of the\r\nArab's idolatry of his horse.  In boyhood I longed to be an Arab of the\r\ndesert and have a beautiful mare, and call her Selim or Benjamin or\r\nMohammed, and feed her with my own hands, and let her come into the tent,\r\nand teach her to caress me and look fondly upon me with her great tender\r\neyes; and I wished that a stranger might come at such a time and offer me\r\na hundred thousand dollars for her, so that I could do like the other\r\nArabs--hesitate, yearn for the money, but overcome by my love for my\r\nmare, at last say, \xe2\x80\x9cPart with thee, my beautiful one!  Never with my\r\nlife!  Away, tempter, I scorn thy gold!\xe2\x80\x9d  and then bound into the saddle\r\nand speed over the desert like the wind!\r\n\r\nBut I recall those aspirations.  If these Arabs be like the other Arabs,\r\ntheir love for their beautiful mares is a fraud.  These of my\r\nacquaintance have no love for their horses, no sentiment of pity for\r\nthem, and no knowledge of how to treat them or care for them.  The Syrian\r\nsaddle-blanket is a quilted mattress two or three inches thick.  It is\r\nnever removed from the horse, day or night.  It gets full of dirt and\r\nhair, and becomes soaked with sweat.  It is bound to breed sores.  These\r\npirates never think of washing a horse's back.  They do not shelter the\r\nhorses in the tents, either--they must stay out and take the weather as\r\nit comes.  Look at poor cropped and dilapidated \xe2\x80\x9cBaalbec,\xe2\x80\x9d and weep for\r\nthe sentiment that has been wasted upon the Selims of romance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour's ride over a rough, rocky road, half flooded with water,\r\nand through a forest of oaks of Bashan, brought us to Dan.\r\n\r\nFrom a little mound here in the plain issues a broad stream of limpid\r\nwater and forms a large shallow pool, and then rushes furiously onward,\r\naugmented in volume.  This puddle is an important source of the Jordan.\r\nIts banks, and those of the brook are respectably adorned with blooming\r\noleanders, but the unutterable beauty of the spot will not throw a\r\nwell-balanced man into convulsions, as the Syrian books of travel would\r\nlead one to suppose.\r\n\r\nFrom the spot I am speaking of, a cannon-ball would carry beyond the\r\nconfines of Holy Land and light upon profane ground three miles away.\r\nWe were only one little hour's travel within the borders of Holy Land--we\r\nhad hardly begun to appreciate yet that we were standing upon any\r\ndifferent sort of earth than that we had always been used to, and see how\r\nthe historic names began already to cluster!  Dan--Bashan--Lake Huleh\r\n--the Sources of Jordan--the Sea of Galilee.  They were all in sight but\r\nthe last, and it was not far away.  The little township of Bashan was\r\nonce the kingdom so famous in Scripture for its bulls and its oaks.\r\nLake Huleh is the Biblical \xe2\x80\x9cWaters of Merom.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dan was the northern and\r\nBeersheba the southern limit of Palestine--hence the expression \xe2\x80\x9cfrom Dan\r\nto Beersheba.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is equivalent to our phrases \xe2\x80\x9cfrom Maine to Texas\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n --\xe2\x80\x9cfrom Baltimore to San Francisco.\xe2\x80\x9d  Our expression and that of the\r\nIsraelites both mean the same--great distance.  With their slow camels\r\nand asses, it was about a seven days' journey from Dan to Beersheba---say\r\na hundred and fifty or sixty miles--it was the entire length of their\r\ncountry, and was not to be undertaken without great preparation and much\r\nceremony.  When the Prodigal traveled to \xe2\x80\x9ca far country,\xe2\x80\x9d it is not\r\nlikely that he went more than eighty or ninety miles.  Palestine is only\r\nfrom forty to sixty miles wide.  The State of Missouri could be split\r\ninto three Palestines, and there would then be enough material left for\r\npart of another--possibly a whole one.  From Baltimore to San Francisco\r\nis several thousand miles, but it will be only a seven days' journey in\r\nthe cars when I am two or three years older.--[The railroad has been\r\ncompleted since the above was written.]--If I live I shall necessarily\r\nhave to go across the continent every now and then in those cars, but one\r\njourney from Dan to Beersheba will be sufficient, no doubt.  It must be\r\nthe most trying of the two.  Therefore, if we chance to discover that\r\nfrom Dan to Beersheba seemed a mighty stretch of country to the\r\nIsraelites, let us not be airy with them, but reflect that it was and is\r\na mighty stretch when one can not traverse it by rail.\r\n\r\nThe small mound I have mentioned a while ago was once occupied by the\r\nPhenician city of Laish.  A party of filibusters from Zorah and Eschol\r\ncaptured the place, and lived there in a free and easy way, worshiping\r\ngods of their own manufacture and stealing idols from their neighbors\r\nwhenever they wore their own out.  Jeroboam set up a golden calf here to\r\nfascinate his people and keep them from making dangerous trips to\r\nJerusalem to worship, which might result in a return to their rightful\r\nallegiance.  With all respect for those ancient Israelites, I can not\r\noverlook the fact that they were not always virtuous enough to withstand\r\nthe seductions of a golden calf.  Human nature has not changed much since\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nSome forty centuries ago the city of Sodom was pillaged by the Arab\r\nprinces of Mesopotamia, and among other prisoners they seized upon the\r\npatriarch Lot and brought him here on their way to their own possessions.\r\nThey brought him to Dan, and father Abraham, who was pursuing them, crept\r\nsoftly in at dead of night, among the whispering oleanders and under the\r\nshadows of the stately oaks, and fell upon the slumbering victors and\r\nstartled them from their dreams with the clash of steel.  He recaptured\r\nLot and all the other plunder.\r\n\r\nWe moved on.  We were now in a green valley, five or six miles wide and\r\nfifteen long.  The streams which are called the sources of the Jordan\r\nflow through it to Lake Huleh, a shallow pond three miles in diameter,\r\nand from the southern extremity of the Lake the concentrated Jordan flows\r\nout.  The Lake is surrounded by a broad marsh, grown with reeds.  Between\r\nthe marsh and the mountains which wall the valley is a respectable strip\r\nof fertile land; at the end of the valley, toward Dan, as much as half\r\nthe land is solid and fertile, and watered by Jordan's sources.  There is\r\nenough of it to make a farm.  It almost warrants the enthusiasm of the\r\nspies of that rabble of adventurers who captured Dan.  They said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nhave seen the land, and behold it is very good.  * * *  A place where\r\nthere is no want of any thing that is in the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir enthusiasm was at least warranted by the fact that they had never\r\nseen a country as good as this.  There was enough of it for the ample\r\nsupport of their six hundred men and their families, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we got fairly down on the level part of the Danite farm, we came to\r\nplaces where we could actually run our horses.  It was a notable\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nWe had been painfully clambering over interminable hills and rocks for\r\ndays together, and when we suddenly came upon this astonishing piece of\r\nrockless plain, every man drove the spurs into his horse and sped away\r\nwith a velocity he could surely enjoy to the utmost, but could never hope\r\nto comprehend in Syria.\r\n\r\nHere were evidences of cultivation--a rare sight in this country--an acre\r\nor two of rich soil studded with last season's dead corn-stalks of the\r\nthickness of your thumb and very wide apart.  But in such a land it was a\r\nthrilling spectacle.  Close to it was a stream, and on its banks a great\r\nherd of curious-looking Syrian goats and sheep were gratefully eating\r\ngravel.  I do not state this as a petrified fact--I only suppose they\r\nwere eating gravel, because there did not appear to be any thing else for\r\nthem to eat.  The shepherds that tended them were the very pictures of\r\nJoseph and his brethren I have no doubt in the world.  They were tall,\r\nmuscular, and very dark-skinned Bedouins, with inky black beards.  They\r\nhad firm lips, unquailing eyes, and a kingly stateliness of bearing.\r\nThey wore the parti-colored half bonnet, half hood, with fringed ends\r\nfalling upon their shoulders, and the full, flowing robe barred with\r\nbroad black stripes--the dress one sees in all pictures of the swarthy\r\nsons of the desert.  These chaps would sell their younger brothers if\r\nthey had a chance, I think.  They have the manners, the customs, the\r\ndress, the occupation and the loose principles of the ancient stock.\r\n[They attacked our camp last night, and I bear them no good will.]\r\nThey had with them the pigmy jackasses one sees all over Syria and\r\nremembers in all pictures of the \xe2\x80\x9cFlight into Egypt,\xe2\x80\x9d where Mary and the\r\nYoung Child are riding and Joseph is walking alongside, towering high\r\nabove the little donkey's shoulders.\r\n\r\nBut really, here the man rides and carries the child, as a general thing,\r\nand the woman walks.  The customs have not changed since Joseph's time.\r\nWe would not have in our houses a picture representing Joseph riding and\r\nMary walking; we would see profanation in it, but a Syrian Christian\r\nwould not.  I know that hereafter the picture I first spoke of will look\r\nodd to me.\r\n\r\nWe could not stop to rest two or three hours out from our camp, of\r\ncourse, albeit the brook was beside us.  So we went on an hour longer.\r\nWe saw water, then, but nowhere in all the waste around was there a foot\r\nof shade, and we were scorching to death.  \xe2\x80\x9cLike unto the shadow of a\r\ngreat rock in a weary land.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nothing in the Bible is more beautiful than\r\nthat, and surely there is no place we have wandered to that is able to\r\ngive it such touching expression as this blistering, naked, treeless\r\nland.\r\n\r\nHere you do not stop just when you please, but when you can.  We found\r\nwater, but no shade.  We traveled on and found a tree at last, but no\r\nwater.  We rested and lunched, and came on to this place, Ain Mellahah\r\n(the boys call it Baldwinsville.) It was a very short day's run, but the\r\ndragoman does not want to go further, and has invented a plausible lie\r\nabout the country beyond this being infested by ferocious Arabs, who\r\nwould make sleeping in their midst a dangerous pastime.  Well, they ought\r\nto be dangerous.  They carry a rusty old weather-beaten flint-lock gun,\r\nwith a barrel that is longer than themselves; it has no sights on it, it\r\nwill not carry farther than a brickbat, and is not half so certain.  And\r\nthe great sash they wear in many a fold around their waists has two or\r\nthree absurd old horse-pistols in it that are rusty from eternal disuse\r\n--weapons that would hang fire just about long enough for you to walk out\r\nof range, and then burst and blow the Arab's head off.  Exceedingly\r\ndangerous these sons of the desert are.\r\n\r\nIt used to make my blood run cold to read Wm. C. Grimes' hairbreadth\r\nescapes from Bedouins, but I think I could read them now without a\r\ntremor.  He never said he was attacked by Bedouins, I believe, or was\r\never treated uncivilly, but then in about every other chapter he\r\ndiscovered them approaching, any how, and he had a blood-curdling fashion\r\nof working up the peril; and of wondering how his relations far away\r\nwould feel could they see their poor wandering boy, with his weary feet\r\nand his dim eyes, in such fearful danger; and of thinking for the last\r\ntime of the old homestead, and the dear old church, and the cow, and\r\nthose things; and of finally straightening his form to its utmost height\r\nin the saddle, drawing his trusty revolver, and then dashing the spurs\r\ninto \xe2\x80\x9cMohammed\xe2\x80\x9d and sweeping down upon the ferocious enemy determined to\r\nsell his life as dearly as possible.  True the Bedouins never did any\r\nthing to him when he arrived, and never had any intention of doing any\r\nthing to him in the first place, and wondered what in the mischief he was\r\nmaking all that to-do about; but still I could not divest myself of the\r\nidea, somehow, that a frightful peril had been escaped through that man's\r\ndare-devil bravery, and so I never could read about Wm. C. Grimes'\r\nBedouins and sleep comfortably afterward.  But I believe the Bedouins to\r\nbe a fraud, now.  I have seen the monster, and I can outrun him.  I shall\r\nnever be afraid of his daring to stand behind his own gun and discharge\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAbout fifteen hundred years before Christ, this camp-ground of ours by\r\nthe Waters of Merom was the scene of one of Joshua's exterminating\r\nbattles.  Jabin, King of Hazor, (up yonder above Dan,) called all the\r\nsheiks about him together, with their hosts, to make ready for Israel's\r\nterrible General who was approaching.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when all these Kings were met together, they came and pitched\r\n     together by the Waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.  And they\r\n     went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as\r\n     the sand that is upon the sea-shore for multitude,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\r\n\r\nBut Joshua fell upon them and utterly destroyed them, root and branch.\r\nThat was his usual policy in war.  He never left any chance for newspaper\r\ncontroversies about who won the battle.  He made this valley, so quiet\r\nnow, a reeking slaughter-pen.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in this part of the country--I do not know exactly where\r\n--Israel fought another bloody battle a hundred years later.  Deborah, the\r\nprophetess, told Barak to take ten thousand men and sally forth against\r\nanother King Jabin who had been doing something.  Barak came down from\r\nMount Tabor, twenty or twenty-five miles from here, and gave battle to\r\nJabin's forces, who were in command of Sisera.  Barak won the fight, and\r\nwhile he was making the victory complete by the usual method of\r\nexterminating the remnant of the defeated host, Sisera fled away on foot,\r\nand when he was nearly exhausted by fatigue and thirst, one Jael, a woman\r\nhe seems to have been acquainted with, invited him to come into her tent\r\nand rest himself.  The weary soldier acceded readily enough, and Jael put\r\nhim to bed.  He said he was very thirsty, and asked his generous\r\npreserver to get him a cup of water.  She brought him some milk, and he\r\ndrank of it gratefully and lay down again, to forget in pleasant dreams\r\nhis lost battle and his humbled pride.  Presently when he was asleep she\r\ncame softly in with a hammer and drove a hideous tent-pen down through\r\nhis brain!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor he was fast asleep and weary.  So he died.\xe2\x80\x9d  Such is the touching\r\nlanguage of the Bible.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Song of Deborah and Barak\xe2\x80\x9d praises Jael for\r\nthe memorable service she had rendered, in an exultant strain:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cBlessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be,\r\n     blessed shall she be above women in the tent.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cHe asked for water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter\r\n     in a lordly dish.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cShe put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workman's\r\n     hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head\r\n     when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAt her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed,\r\n     he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStirring scenes like these occur in this valley no more.  There is not a\r\nsolitary village throughout its whole extent--not for thirty miles in\r\neither direction.  There are two or three small clusters of Bedouin\r\ntents, but not a single permanent habitation.  One may ride ten miles,\r\nhereabouts, and not see ten human beings.\r\n\r\nTo this region one of the prophecies is applied:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies which dwell\r\n     therein shall be astonished at it.  And I will scatter you among the\r\n     heathen, and I will draw out a sword after you; and your land shall\r\n     be desolate and your cities waste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo man can stand here by deserted Ain Mellahah and say the prophecy has\r\nnot been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIn a verse from the Bible which I have quoted above, occurs the phrase\r\n\xe2\x80\x9call these kings.\xe2\x80\x9d  It attracted my attention in a moment, because it\r\ncarries to my mind such a vastly different significance from what it\r\nalways did at home.  I can see easily enough that if I wish to profit by\r\nthis tour and come to a correct understanding of the matters of interest\r\nconnected with it, I must studiously and faithfully unlearn a great many\r\nthings I have somehow absorbed concerning Palestine.  I must begin a\r\nsystem of reduction.  Like my grapes which the spies bore out of the\r\nPromised Land, I have got every thing in Palestine on too large a scale.\r\nSome of my ideas were wild enough.  The word Palestine always brought to\r\nmy mind a vague suggestion of a country as large as the United States.\r\nI do not know why, but such was the case.  I suppose it was because I\r\ncould not conceive of a small country having so large a history.  I think\r\nI was a little surprised to find that the grand Sultan of Turkey was a\r\nman of only ordinary size.  I must try to reduce my ideas of Palestine to\r\na more reasonable shape.  One gets large impressions in boyhood,\r\nsometimes, which he has to fight against all his life.  \xe2\x80\x9cAll these\r\nkings.\xe2\x80\x9d  When I used to read that in Sunday School, it suggested to me\r\nthe several kings of such countries as England, France, Spain, Germany,\r\nRussia, etc., arrayed in splendid robes ablaze with jewels, marching in\r\ngrave procession, with sceptres of gold in their hands and flashing\r\ncrowns upon their heads.  But here in Ain Mellahah, after coming through\r\nSyria, and after giving serious study to the character and customs of the\r\ncountry, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9call these kings\xe2\x80\x9d loses its grandeur.  It suggests\r\nonly a parcel of petty chiefs--ill-clad and ill-conditioned savages much\r\nlike our Indians, who lived in full sight of each other and whose\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ckingdoms\xe2\x80\x9d were large when they were five miles square and contained two\r\nthousand souls.  The combined monarchies of the thirty \xe2\x80\x9ckings\xe2\x80\x9d destroyed\r\nby Joshua on one of his famous campaigns, only covered an area about\r\nequal to four of our counties of ordinary size.  The poor old sheik we\r\nsaw at Cesarea Philippi with his ragged band of a hundred followers,\r\nwould have been called a \xe2\x80\x9cking\xe2\x80\x9d in those ancient times.\r\n\r\nIt is seven in the morning, and as we are in the country, the grass ought\r\nto be sparkling with dew, the flowers enriching the air with their\r\nfragrance, and the birds singing in the trees.  But alas, there is no dew\r\nhere, nor flowers, nor birds, nor trees.  There is a plain and an\r\nunshaded lake, and beyond them some barren mountains.  The tents are\r\ntumbling, the Arabs are quarreling like dogs and cats, as usual, the\r\ncampground is strewn with packages and bundles, the labor of packing them\r\nupon the backs of the mules is progressing with great activity, the\r\nhorses are saddled, the umbrellas are out, and in ten minutes we shall\r\nmount and the long procession will move again.  The white city of the\r\nMellahah, resurrected for a moment out of the dead centuries, will have\r\ndisappeared again and left no sign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nWe traversed some miles of desolate country whose soil is rich enough,\r\nbut is given over wholly to weeds--a silent, mournful expanse, wherein we\r\nsaw only three persons--Arabs, with nothing on but a long coarse shirt\r\nlike the \xe2\x80\x9ctow-linen\xe2\x80\x9d shirts which used to form the only summer garment of\r\nlittle negro boys on Southern plantations.  Shepherds they were, and they\r\ncharmed their flocks with the traditional shepherd's pipe--a reed\r\ninstrument that made music as exquisitely infernal as these same Arabs\r\ncreate when they sing.\r\n\r\nIn their pipes lingered no echo of the wonderful music the shepherd\r\nforefathers heard in the Plains of Bethlehem what time the angels sang\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace on earth, good will to men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPart of the ground we came over was not ground at all, but\r\nrocks--cream-colored rocks, worn smooth, as if by water; with seldom an\r\nedge or a corner on them, but scooped out, honey-combed, bored out with\r\neye-holes, and thus wrought into all manner of quaint shapes, among\r\nwhich the uncouth imitation of skulls was frequent.  Over this part of\r\nthe route were occasional remains of an old Roman road like the Appian\r\nWay, whose paving-stones still clung to their places with Roman\r\ntenacity.\r\n\r\nGray lizards, those heirs of ruin, of sepulchres and desolation, glided\r\nin and out among the rocks or lay still and sunned themselves.  Where\r\nprosperity has reigned, and fallen; where glory has flamed, and gone out;\r\nwhere beauty has dwelt, and passed away; where gladness was, and sorrow\r\nis; where the pomp of life has been, and silence and death brood in its\r\nhigh places, there this reptile makes his home, and mocks at human\r\nvanity.  His coat is the color of ashes: and ashes are the symbol of\r\nhopes that have perished, of aspirations that came to nought, of loves\r\nthat are buried.  If he could speak, he would say, Build temples: I will\r\nlord it in their ruins; build palaces: I will inhabit them; erect\r\nempires: I will inherit them; bury your beautiful: I will watch the worms\r\nat their work; and you, who stand here and moralize over me: I will crawl\r\nover your corpse at the last.\r\n\r\nA few ants were in this desert place, but merely to spend the summer.\r\nThey brought their provisions from Ain Mellahah--eleven miles.\r\n\r\nJack is not very well to-day, it is easy to see; but boy as he is, he is\r\ntoo much of a man to speak of it.  He exposed himself to the sun too much\r\nyesterday, but since it came of his earnest desire to learn, and to make\r\nthis journey as useful as the opportunities will allow, no one seeks to\r\ndiscourage him by fault-finding.  We missed him an hour from the camp,\r\nand then found him some distance away, by the edge of a brook, and with\r\nno umbrella to protect him from the fierce sun.  If he had been used to\r\ngoing without his umbrella, it would have been well enough, of course;\r\nbut he was not.  He was just in the act of throwing a clod at a\r\nmud-turtle which was sunning itself on a small log in the brook.\r\nWe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't do that, Jack.  What do you want to harm him for?  What has he\r\ndone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I won't kill him, but I ought to, because he is a fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe asked him why, but he said it was no matter.  We asked him why, once\r\nor twice, as we walked back to the camp but he still said it was no\r\nmatter.  But late at night, when he was sitting in a thoughtful mood on\r\nthe bed, we asked him again and he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it don't matter; I don't mind it now, but I did not like it today,\r\nyou know, because I don't tell any thing that isn't so, and I don't think\r\nthe Colonel ought to, either.  But he did; he told us at prayers in the\r\nPilgrims' tent, last night, and he seemed as if he was reading it out of\r\nthe Bible, too, about this country flowing with milk and honey, and about\r\nthe voice of the turtle being heard in the land.  I thought that was\r\ndrawing it a little strong, about the turtles, any how, but I asked Mr.\r\nChurch if it was so, and he said it was, and what Mr. Church tells me, I\r\nbelieve.  But I sat there and watched that turtle nearly an hour today,\r\nand I almost burned up in the sun; but I never heard him sing.  I believe\r\nI sweated a double handful of sweat---I know I did--because it got in my\r\neyes, and it was running down over my nose all the time; and you know my\r\npants are tighter than any body else's--Paris foolishness--and the\r\nbuckskin seat of them got wet with sweat, and then got dry again and\r\nbegan to draw up and pinch and tear loose--it was awful--but I never\r\nheard him sing.  Finally I said, This is a fraud--that is what it is, it\r\nis a fraud--and if I had had any sense I might have known a cursed\r\nmud-turtle couldn't sing.  And then I said, I don't wish to be hard on\r\nthis fellow, and I will just give him ten minutes to commence; ten\r\nminutes--and then if he don't, down goes his building.  But he didn't\r\ncommence, you know.  I had staid there all that time, thinking may be he\r\nmight, pretty soon, because he kept on raising his head up and letting\r\nit down, and drawing the skin over his eyes for a minute and then\r\nopening them out again, as if he was trying to study up something to\r\nsing, but just as the ten minutes were up and I was all beat out and\r\nblistered, he laid his blamed head down on a knot and went fast asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a little hard, after you had waited so long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so.  I said, Well, if you won't sing, you shan't sleep,\r\nany way; and if you fellows had let me alone I would have made him shin\r\nout of Galilee quicker than any turtle ever did yet.  But it isn't any\r\nmatter now--let it go.  The skin is all off the back of my neck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbout ten in the morning we halted at Joseph's Pit.  This is a ruined\r\nKhan of the Middle Ages, in one of whose side courts is a great walled\r\nand arched pit with water in it, and this pit, one tradition says, is the\r\none Joseph's brethren cast him into.  A more authentic tradition, aided\r\nby the geography of the country, places the pit in Dothan, some two days'\r\njourney from here.  However, since there are many who believe in this\r\npresent pit as the true one, it has its interest.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to make a choice of the most beautiful passage in a book which\r\nis so gemmed with beautiful passages as the Bible; but it is certain that\r\nnot many things within its lids may take rank above the exquisite story\r\nof Joseph.  Who taught those ancient writers their simplicity of\r\nlanguage, their felicity of expression, their pathos, and above all,\r\ntheir faculty of sinking themselves entirely out of sight of the reader\r\nand making the narrative stand out alone and seem to tell itself?\r\nShakspeare is always present when one reads his book; Macaulay is present\r\nwhen we follow the march of his stately sentences; but the Old Testament\r\nwriters are hidden from view.\r\n\r\nIf the pit I have been speaking of is the right one, a scene transpired\r\nthere, long ages ago, which is familiar to us all in pictures.  The sons\r\nof Jacob had been pasturing their flocks near there.  Their father grew\r\nuneasy at their long absence, and sent Joseph, his favorite, to see if\r\nany thing had gone wrong with them.  He traveled six or seven days'\r\njourney; he was only seventeen years old, and, boy like, he toiled\r\nthrough that long stretch of the vilest, rockiest, dustiest country in\r\nAsia, arrayed in the pride of his heart, his beautiful claw-hammer coat\r\nof many colors.  Joseph was the favorite, and that was one crime in the\r\neyes of his brethren; he had dreamed dreams, and interpreted them to\r\nforeshadow his elevation far above all his family in the far future, and\r\nthat was another; he was dressed well and had doubtless displayed the\r\nharmless vanity of youth in keeping the fact prominently before his\r\nbrothers.  These were crimes his elders fretted over among themselves and\r\nproposed to punish when the opportunity should offer.  When they saw him\r\ncoming up from the Sea of Galilee, they recognized him and were glad.\r\nThey said, \xe2\x80\x9cLo, here is this dreamer--let us kill him.\xe2\x80\x9d  But Reuben\r\npleaded for his life, and they spared it.  But they seized the boy, and\r\nstripped the hated coat from his back and pushed him into the pit.  They\r\nintended to let him die there, but Reuben intended to liberate him\r\nsecretly.  However, while Reuben was away for a little while, the\r\nbrethren sold Joseph to some Ishmaelitish merchants who were journeying\r\ntowards Egypt.  Such is the history of the pit.  And the self-same pit is\r\nthere in that place, even to this day; and there it will remain until the\r\nnext detachment of image-breakers and tomb desecraters arrives from the\r\n__Quaker City__ excursion, and they will infallibly dig it up and carry it\r\naway with them.  For behold in them is no reverence for the solemn\r\nmonuments of the past, and whithersoever they go they destroy and spare\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nJoseph became rich, distinguished, powerful--as the Bible expresses it,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clord over all the land of Egypt.\xe2\x80\x9d  Joseph was the real king, the\r\nstrength, the brain of the monarchy, though Pharaoh held the title.\r\nJoseph is one of the truly great men of the Old Testament.  And he was\r\nthe noblest and the manliest, save Esau.  Why shall we not say a good\r\nword for the princely Bedouin?  The only crime that can be brought\r\nagainst him is that he was unfortunate.  Why must every body praise\r\nJoseph's great-hearted generosity to his cruel brethren, without stint of\r\nfervent language, and fling only a reluctant bone of praise to Esau for\r\nhis still sublimer generosity to the brother who had wronged him?  Jacob\r\ntook advantage of Esau's consuming hunger to rob him of his birthright\r\nand the great honor and consideration that belonged to the position; by\r\ntreachery and falsehood he robbed him of his father's blessing; he made\r\nof him a stranger in his home, and a wanderer.  Yet after twenty years\r\nhad passed away and Jacob met Esau and fell at his feet quaking with fear\r\nand begging piteously to be spared the punishment he knew he deserved,\r\nwhat did that magnificent savage do?  He fell upon his neck and embraced\r\nhim!  When Jacob--who was incapable of comprehending nobility of\r\ncharacter--still doubting, still fearing, insisted upon \xe2\x80\x9cfinding grace\r\nwith my lord\xe2\x80\x9d by the bribe of a present of cattle, what did the gorgeous\r\nson of the desert say?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEsau found Jacob rich, beloved by wives and children, and traveling in\r\nstate, with servants, herds of cattle and trains of camels--but he\r\nhimself was still the uncourted outcast this brother had made him.  After\r\nthirteen years of romantic mystery, the brethren who had wronged Joseph,\r\ncame, strangers in a strange land, hungry and humble, to buy \xe2\x80\x9ca little\r\nfood\xe2\x80\x9d; and being summoned to a palace, charged with crime, they beheld in\r\nits owner their wronged brother; they were trembling beggars--he, the\r\nlord of a mighty empire!  What Joseph that ever lived would have thrown\r\naway such a chance to \xe2\x80\x9cshow off?\xe2\x80\x9d  Who stands first--outcast Esau\r\nforgiving Jacob in prosperity, or Joseph on a king's throne forgiving the\r\nragged tremblers whose happy rascality placed him there?\r\n\r\nJust before we came to Joseph's Pit, we had \xe2\x80\x9craised\xe2\x80\x9d a hill, and there, a\r\nfew miles before us, with not a tree or a shrub to interrupt the view,\r\nlay a vision which millions of worshipers in the far lands of the earth\r\nwould give half their possessions to see--the sacred Sea of Galilee!\r\n\r\nTherefore we tarried only a short time at the pit.  We rested the horses\r\nand ourselves, and felt for a few minutes the blessed shade of the\r\nancient buildings.  We were out of water, but the two or three scowling\r\nArabs, with their long guns, who were idling about the place, said they\r\nhad none and that there was none in the vicinity.  They knew there was a\r\nlittle brackish water in the pit, but they venerated a place made sacred\r\nby their ancestor's imprisonment too much to be willing to see Christian\r\ndogs drink from it.  But Ferguson tied rags and handkerchiefs together\r\ntill he made a rope long enough to lower a vessel to the bottom, and we\r\ndrank and then rode on; and in a short time we dismounted on those shores\r\nwhich the feet of the Saviour have made holy ground.\r\n\r\nAt noon we took a swim in the Sea of Galilee--a blessed privilege in this\r\nroasting climate--and then lunched under a neglected old fig-tree at the\r\nfountain they call Ain-et-Tin, a hundred yards from ruined Capernaum.\r\nEvery rivulet that gurgles out of the rocks and sands of this part of the\r\nworld is dubbed with the title of \xe2\x80\x9cfountain,\xe2\x80\x9d and people familiar with\r\nthe Hudson, the great lakes and the Mississippi fall into transports of\r\nadmiration over them, and exhaust their powers of composition in writing\r\ntheir praises.  If all the poetry and nonsense that have been discharged\r\nupon the fountains and the bland scenery of this region were collected in\r\na book, it would make a most valuable volume to burn.\r\n\r\nDuring luncheon, the pilgrim enthusiasts of our party, who had been so\r\nlight-hearted and so happy ever since they touched holy ground that they\r\ndid little but mutter incoherent rhapsodies, could scarcely eat, so\r\nanxious were they to \xe2\x80\x9ctake shipping\xe2\x80\x9d and sail in very person upon the\r\nwaters that had borne the vessels of the Apostles.  Their anxiety grew\r\nand their excitement augmented with every fleeting moment, until my fears\r\nwere aroused and I began to have misgivings that in their present\r\ncondition they might break recklessly loose from all considerations of\r\nprudence and buy a whole fleet of ships to sail in instead of hiring a\r\nsingle one for an hour, as quiet folk are wont to do.  I trembled to\r\nthink of the ruined purses this day's performances might result in.\r\nI could not help reflecting bodingly upon the intemperate zeal with which\r\nmiddle-aged men are apt to surfeit themselves upon a seductive folly\r\nwhich they have tasted for the first time.  And yet I did not feel that\r\nI had a right to be surprised at the state of things which was giving me\r\nso much concern.  These men had been taught from infancy to revere,\r\nalmost to worship, the holy places whereon their happy eyes were resting\r\nnow.  For many and many a year this very picture had visited their\r\nthoughts by day and floated through their dreams by night.  To stand\r\nbefore it in the flesh--to see it as they saw it now--to sail upon the\r\nhallowed sea, and kiss the holy soil that compassed it about: these were\r\naspirations they had cherished while a generation dragged its lagging\r\nseasons by and left its furrows in their faces and its frosts upon their\r\nhair.  To look upon this picture, and sail upon this sea, they had\r\nforsaken home and its idols and journeyed thousands and thousands of\r\nmiles, in weariness and tribulation.  What wonder that the sordid lights\r\nof work-day prudence should pale before the glory of a hope like theirs\r\nin the full splendor of its fruition?  Let them squander millions!\r\nI said--who speaks of money at a time like this?\r\n\r\nIn this frame of mind I followed, as fast as I could, the eager footsteps\r\nof the pilgrims, and stood upon the shore of the lake, and swelled, with\r\nhat and voice, the frantic hail they sent after the \xe2\x80\x9cship\xe2\x80\x9d that was\r\nspeeding by.  It was a success.  The toilers of the sea ran in and\r\nbeached their barque.  Joy sat upon every countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much?--ask him how much, Ferguson!--how much to take us all--eight\r\nof us, and you--to Bethsaida, yonder, and to the mouth of Jordan, and to\r\nthe place where the swine ran down into the sea--quick!--and we want to\r\ncoast around every where--every where!--all day long!--I could sail a\r\nyear in these waters!--and tell him we'll stop at Magdala and finish at\r\nTiberias!--ask him how much?--any thing--any thing whatever!--tell him we\r\ndon't care what the expense is!\xe2\x80\x9d  [I said to myself, I knew how it would\r\nbe.]\r\n\r\nFerguson--(interpreting)--\xe2\x80\x9cHe says two Napoleons--eight dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne or two countenances fell.  Then a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo much!--we'll give him one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI never shall know how it was--I shudder yet when I think how the place\r\nis given to miracles--but in a single instant of time, as it seemed to\r\nme, that ship was twenty paces from the shore, and speeding away like a\r\nfrightened thing!  Eight crestfallen creatures stood upon the shore, and\r\nO, to think of it! this--this--after all that overmastering ecstacy!\r\nOh, shameful, shameful ending, after such unseemly boasting!  It was too\r\nmuch like \xe2\x80\x9cHo! let me at him!\xe2\x80\x9d  followed by a prudent \xe2\x80\x9cTwo of you hold\r\nhim--one can hold me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstantly there was wailing and gnashing of teeth in the camp.  The two\r\nNapoleons were offered--more if necessary--and pilgrims and dragoman\r\nshouted themselves hoarse with pleadings to the retreating boatmen to\r\ncome back.  But they sailed serenely away and paid no further heed to\r\npilgrims who had dreamed all their lives of some day skimming over the\r\nsacred waters of Galilee and listening to its hallowed story in the\r\nwhisperings of its waves, and had journeyed countless leagues to do it,\r\nand--and then concluded that the fare was too high.  Impertinent\r\nMohammedan Arabs, to think such things of gentlemen of another faith!\r\n\r\nWell, there was nothing to do but just submit and forego the privilege of\r\nvoyaging on Genessaret, after coming half around the globe to taste that\r\npleasure.  There was a time, when the Saviour taught here, that boats\r\nwere plenty among the fishermen of the coasts--but boats and fishermen\r\nboth are gone, now; and old Josephus had a fleet of men-of-war in these\r\nwaters eighteen centuries ago--a hundred and thirty bold canoes--but\r\nthey, also, have passed away and left no sign.  They battle here no more\r\nby sea, and the commercial marine of Galilee numbers only two small\r\nships, just of a pattern with the little skiffs the disciples knew.  One\r\nwas lost to us for good--the other was miles away and far out of hail.\r\nSo we mounted the horses and rode grimly on toward Magdala, cantering\r\nalong in the edge of the water for want of the means of passing over it.\r\n\r\nHow the pilgrims abused each other!  Each said it was the other's fault,\r\nand each in turn denied it.  No word was spoken by the sinners--even the\r\nmildest sarcasm might have been dangerous at such a time.  Sinners that\r\nhave been kept down and had examples held up to them, and suffered\r\nfrequent lectures, and been so put upon in a moral way and in the matter\r\nof going slow and being serious and bottling up slang, and so crowded in\r\nregard to the matter of being proper and always and forever behaving,\r\nthat their lives have become a burden to them, would not lag behind\r\npilgrims at such a time as this, and wink furtively, and be joyful, and\r\ncommit other such crimes--because it would not occur to them to do it.\r\nOtherwise they would.  But they did do it, though--and it did them a\r\nworld of good to hear the pilgrims abuse each other, too.  We took an\r\nunworthy satisfaction in seeing them fall out, now and then, because it\r\nshowed that they were only poor human people like us, after all.\r\n\r\nSo we all rode down to Magdala, while the gnashing of teeth waxed and\r\nwaned by turns, and harsh words troubled the holy calm of Galilee.\r\n\r\nLest any man think I mean to be ill-natured when I talk about our\r\npilgrims as I have been talking, I wish to say in all sincerity that I do\r\nnot.  I would not listen to lectures from men I did not like and could\r\nnot respect; and none of these can say I ever took their lectures\r\nunkindly, or was restive under the infliction, or failed to try to profit\r\nby what they said to me.  They are better men than I am; I can say that\r\nhonestly; they are good friends of mine, too--and besides, if they did\r\nnot wish to be stirred up occasionally in print, why in the mischief did\r\nthey travel with me?  They knew me.  They knew my liberal way--that I\r\nlike to give and take--when it is for me to give and other people to\r\ntake.  When one of them threatened to leave me in Damascus when I had the\r\ncholera, he had no real idea of doing it--I know his passionate nature\r\nand the good impulses that underlie it.  And did I not overhear Church,\r\nanother pilgrim, say he did not care who went or who staid, he would\r\nstand by me till I walked out of Damascus on my own feet or was carried\r\nout in a coffin, if it was a year?  And do I not include Church every\r\ntime I abuse the pilgrims--and would I be likely to speak ill-naturedly\r\nof him?  I wish to stir them up and make them healthy; that is all.\r\n\r\nWe had left Capernaum behind us.  It was only a shapeless ruin.  It bore\r\nno semblance to a town, and had nothing about it to suggest that it had\r\never been a town.  But all desolate and unpeopled as it was, it was\r\nillustrious ground.  From it sprang that tree of Christianity whose broad\r\narms overshadow so many distant lands to-day.  After Christ was tempted\r\nof the devil in the desert, he came here and began his teachings; and\r\nduring the three or four years he lived afterward, this place was his\r\nhome almost altogether.  He began to heal the sick, and his fame soon\r\nspread so widely that sufferers came from Syria and beyond Jordan, and\r\neven from Jerusalem, several days' journey away, to be cured of their\r\ndiseases.  Here he healed the centurion's servant and Peter's\r\nmother-in-law, and multitudes of the lame and the blind and persons\r\npossessed of devils; and here, also, he raised Jairus's daughter from\r\nthe dead.  He went into a ship with his disciples, and when they roused\r\nhim from sleep in the midst of a storm, he quieted the winds and lulled\r\nthe troubled sea to rest with his voice.  He passed over to the other\r\nside, a few miles away and relieved two men of devils, which passed into\r\nsome swine.  After his return he called Matthew from the receipt of\r\ncustoms, performed some cures, and created scandal by eating with\r\npublicans and sinners.  Then he went healing and teaching through\r\nGalilee, and even journeyed to Tyre and Sidon.  He chose the twelve\r\ndisciples, and sent them abroad to preach the new gospel.  He worked\r\nmiracles in Bethsaida and Chorazin--villages two or three miles from\r\nCapernaum.  It was near one of them that the miraculous draft of fishes\r\nis supposed to have been taken, and it was in the desert places near the\r\nother that he fed the thousands by the miracles of the loaves and\r\nfishes.  He cursed them both, and Capernaum also, for not repenting,\r\nafter all the great works he had done in their midst, and prophesied\r\nagainst them.  They are all in ruins, now--which is gratifying to the\r\npilgrims, for, as usual, they fit the eternal words of gods to the\r\nevanescent things of this earth; Christ, it is more probable, referred\r\nto the people, not their shabby villages of wigwams: he said it would be\r\nsad for them at \xe2\x80\x9cthe day of judgment\xe2\x80\x9d--and what business have mud-hovels\r\nat the Day of Judgment?  It would not affect the prophecy in the least\r\n--it would neither prove it or disprove it--if these towns were splendid\r\ncities now instead of the almost vanished ruins they are. Christ visited\r\nMagdala, which is near by Capernaum, and he also visited Cesarea\r\nPhilippi.  He went up to his old home at Nazareth, and saw his brothers\r\nJoses, and Judas, and James, and Simon--those persons who, being own\r\nbrothers to Jesus Christ, one would expect to hear mentioned sometimes,\r\nyet who ever saw their names in a newspaper or heard them from a pulpit?\r\nWho ever inquires what manner of youths they were; and whether they\r\nslept with Jesus, played with him and romped about him; quarreled with\r\nhim concerning toys and trifles; struck him in anger, not suspecting\r\nwhat he was?  Who ever wonders what they thought when they saw him come\r\nback to Nazareth a celebrity, and looked long at his unfamiliar face to\r\nmake sure, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is Jesus?\xe2\x80\x9d  Who wonders what passed in\r\ntheir minds when they saw this brother, (who was only a brother to them,\r\nhowever much he might be to others a mysterious stranger who was a god\r\nand had stood face to face with God above the clouds,) doing strange\r\nmiracles with crowds of astonished people for witnesses?  Who wonders if\r\nthe brothers of Jesus asked him to come home with them, and said his\r\nmother and his sisters were grieved at his long absence, and would be\r\nwild with delight to see his face again?  Who ever gives a thought to\r\nthe sisters of Jesus at all?--yet he had sisters; and memories of them\r\nmust have stolen into his mind often when he was ill-treated among\r\nstrangers; when he was homeless and said he had not where to lay his\r\nhead; when all deserted him, even Peter, and he stood alone among his\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nChrist did few miracles in Nazareth, and staid but a little while.  The\r\npeople said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis the Son of God!  Why, his father is nothing but a\r\ncarpenter.  We know the family.  We see them every day.  Are not his\r\nbrothers named so and so, and his sisters so and so, and is not his\r\nmother the person they call Mary?  This is absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d  He did not curse his\r\nhome, but he shook its dust from his feet and went away.\r\n\r\nCapernaum lies close to the edge of the little sea, in a small plain some\r\nfive miles long and a mile or two wide, which is mildly adorned with\r\noleanders which look all the better contrasted with the bald hills and\r\nthe howling deserts which surround them, but they are not as deliriously\r\nbeautiful as the books paint them.  If one be calm and resolute he can\r\nlook upon their comeliness and live.\r\n\r\nOne of the most astonishing things that have yet fallen under our\r\nobservation is the exceedingly small portion of the earth from which\r\nsprang the now flourishing plant of Christianity.  The longest journey\r\nour Saviour ever performed was from here to Jerusalem--about one hundred\r\nto one hundred and twenty miles.  The next longest was from here to\r\nSidon--say about sixty or seventy miles.  Instead of being wide apart--as\r\nAmerican appreciation of distances would naturally suggest--the places\r\nmade most particularly celebrated by the presence of Christ are nearly\r\nall right here in full view, and within cannon-shot of Capernaum.\r\nLeaving out two or three short journeys of the Saviour, he spent his\r\nlife, preached his gospel, and performed his miracles within a compass no\r\nlarger than an ordinary county in the United States.  It is as much as I\r\ncan do to comprehend this stupefying fact.  How it wears a man out to\r\nhave to read up a hundred pages of history every two or three miles--for\r\nverily the celebrated localities of Palestine occur that close together.\r\nHow wearily, how bewilderingly they swarm about your path!\r\n\r\nIn due time we reached the ancient village of Magdala.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nMagdala is not a beautiful place.  It is thoroughly Syrian, and that is\r\nto say that it is thoroughly ugly, and cramped, squalid, uncomfortable,\r\nand filthy--just the style of cities that have adorned the country since\r\nAdam's time, as all writers have labored hard to prove, and have\r\nsucceeded.  The streets of Magdala are any where from three to six feet\r\nwide, and reeking with uncleanliness.  The houses are from five to seven\r\nfeet high, and all built upon one arbitrary plan--the ungraceful form of\r\na dry-goods box.  The sides are daubed with a smooth white plaster, and\r\ntastefully frescoed aloft and alow with disks of camel-dung placed there\r\nto dry.  This gives the edifice the romantic appearance of having been\r\nriddled with cannon-balls, and imparts to it a very warlike aspect.  When\r\nthe artist has arranged his materials with an eye to just proportion\r\n--the small and the large flakes in alternate rows, and separated by\r\ncarefully-considered intervals--I know of nothing more cheerful to look\r\nupon than a spirited Syrian fresco.  The flat, plastered roof is\r\ngarnished by picturesque stacks of fresco materials, which, having\r\nbecome thoroughly dried and cured, are placed there where it will be\r\nconvenient.  It is used for fuel.  There is no timber of any consequence\r\nin Palestine--none at all to waste upon fires--and neither are there any\r\nmines of coal. If my description has been intelligible, you will\r\nperceive, now, that a square, flat-roofed hovel, neatly frescoed, with\r\nits wall-tops gallantly bastioned and turreted with dried camel-refuse,\r\ngives to a landscape a feature that is exceedingly festive and\r\npicturesque, especially if one is careful to remember to stick in a cat\r\nwherever, about the premises, there is room for a cat to sit.  There are\r\nno windows to a Syrian hut, and no chimneys.  When I used to read that\r\nthey let a bed-ridden man down through the roof of a house in Capernaum\r\nto get him into the presence of the Saviour, I generally had a\r\nthree-story brick in my mind, and marveled that they did not break his\r\nneck with the strange experiment.  I perceive now, however, that they\r\nmight have taken him by the heels and thrown him clear over the house\r\nwithout discommoding him very much.  Palestine is not changed any since\r\nthose days, in manners, customs, architecture, or people.\r\n\r\nAs we rode into Magdala not a soul was visible.  But the ring of the\r\nhorses' hoofs roused the stupid population, and they all came trooping\r\nout--old men and old women, boys and girls, the blind, the crazy, and the\r\ncrippled, all in ragged, soiled and scanty raiment, and all abject\r\nbeggars by nature, instinct and education.  How the vermin-tortured\r\nvagabonds did swarm!  How they showed their scars and sores, and\r\npiteously pointed to their maimed and crooked limbs, and begged with\r\ntheir pleading eyes for charity!  We had invoked a spirit we could not\r\nlay.  They hung to the horses's tails, clung to their manes and the\r\nstirrups, closed in on every aide in scorn of dangerous hoofs--and out of\r\ntheir infidel throats, with one accord, burst an agonizing and most\r\ninfernal chorus: \xe2\x80\x9cHowajji, bucksheesh! howajji, bucksheesh! howajji,\r\nbucksheesh! bucksheesh! bucksheesh!\xe2\x80\x9d  I never was in a storm like that\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nAs we paid the bucksheesh out to sore-eyed children and brown, buxom\r\ngirls with repulsively tattooed lips and chins, we filed through the town\r\nand by many an exquisite fresco, till we came to a bramble-infested\r\ninclosure and a Roman-looking ruin which had been the veritable dwelling\r\nof St. Mary Magdalene, the friend and follower of Jesus.  The guide\r\nbelieved it, and so did I.  I could not well do otherwise, with the house\r\nright there before my eyes as plain as day.  The pilgrims took down\r\nportions of the front wall for specimens, as is their honored custom, and\r\nthen we departed.\r\n\r\nWe are camped in this place, now, just within the city walls of Tiberias.\r\nWe went into the town before nightfall and looked at its people--we cared\r\nnothing about its houses.  Its people are best examined at a distance.\r\nThey are particularly uncomely Jews, Arabs, and negroes.  Squalor and\r\npoverty are the pride of Tiberias.  The young women wear their dower\r\nstrung upon a strong wire that curves downward from the top of the head\r\nto the jaw--Turkish silver coins which they have raked together or\r\ninherited.  Most of these maidens were not wealthy, but some few had been\r\nvery kindly dealt with by fortune.  I saw heiresses there worth, in their\r\nown right--worth, well, I suppose I might venture to say, as much as nine\r\ndollars and a half.  But such cases are rare.  When you come across one\r\nof these, she naturally puts on airs.  She will not ask for bucksheesh.\r\nShe will not even permit of undue familiarity.  She assumes a crushing\r\ndignity and goes on serenely practicing with her fine-tooth comb and\r\nquoting poetry just the same as if you were not present at all.  Some\r\npeople can not stand prosperity.\r\n\r\nThey say that the long-nosed, lanky, dyspeptic-looking body-snatchers,\r\nwith the indescribable hats on, and a long curl dangling down in front of\r\neach ear, are the old, familiar, self-righteous Pharisees we read of in\r\nthe Scriptures.  Verily, they look it.  Judging merely by their general\r\nstyle, and without other evidence, one might easily suspect that\r\nself-righteousness was their specialty.\r\n\r\nFrom various authorities I have culled information concerning Tiberias.\r\nIt was built by Herod Antipas, the murderer of John the Baptist, and\r\nnamed after the Emperor Tiberius.  It is believed that it stands upon the\r\nsite of what must have been, ages ago, a city of considerable\r\narchitectural pretensions, judging by the fine porphyry pillars that are\r\nscattered through Tiberias and down the lake shore southward.  These were\r\nfluted, once, and yet, although the stone is about as hard as iron, the\r\nflutings are almost worn away.  These pillars are small, and doubtless\r\nthe edifices they adorned were distinguished more for elegance than\r\ngrandeur.  This modern town--Tiberias--is only mentioned in the New\r\nTestament; never in the Old.\r\n\r\nThe Sanhedrim met here last, and for three hundred years Tiberias was the\r\nmetropolis of the Jews in Palestine.  It is one of the four holy cities\r\nof the Israelites, and is to them what Mecca is to the Mohammedan and\r\nJerusalem to the Christian.  It has been the abiding place of many\r\nlearned and famous Jewish rabbins.  They lie buried here, and near them\r\nlie also twenty-five thousand of their faith who traveled far to be near\r\nthem while they lived and lie with them when they died.  The great Rabbi\r\nBen Israel spent three years here in the early part of the third century.\r\nHe is dead, now.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Sea of Galilee is not so large a sea as Lake Tahoe\r\n--[I measure all lakes by Tahoe, partly because I am far more familiar with\r\nit than with any other, and partly because I have such a high admiration\r\nfor it and such a world of pleasant recollections of it, that it is very\r\nnearly impossible for me to speak of lakes and not mention it.]--by a\r\ngood deal--it is just about two-thirds as large.  And when we come to\r\nspeak of beauty, this sea is no more to be compared to Tahoe than a\r\nmeridian of longitude is to a rainbow.  The dim waters of this pool can\r\nnot suggest the limpid brilliancy of Tahoe; these low, shaven, yellow\r\nhillocks of rocks and sand, so devoid of perspective, can not suggest the\r\ngrand peaks that compass Tahoe like a wall, and whose ribbed and chasmed\r\nfronts are clad with stately pines that seem to grow small and smaller as\r\nthey climb, till one might fancy them reduced to weeds and shrubs far\r\nupward, where they join the everlasting snows.  Silence and solitude\r\nbrood over Tahoe; and silence and solitude brood also over this lake of\r\nGenessaret.  But the solitude of the one is as cheerful and fascinating\r\nas the solitude of the other is dismal and repellant.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning one watches the silent battle of dawn and darkness\r\nupon the waters of Tahoe with a placid interest; but when the shadows\r\nsulk away and one by one the hidden beauties of the shore unfold\r\nthemselves in the full splendor of noon; when the still surface is belted\r\nlike a rainbow with broad bars of blue and green and white, half the\r\ndistance from circumference to centre; when, in the lazy summer\r\nafternoon, he lies in a boat, far out to where the dead blue of the deep\r\nwater begins, and smokes the pipe of peace and idly winks at the\r\ndistant crags and patches of snow from under his cap-brim; when the boat\r\ndrifts shoreward to the white water, and he lolls over the gunwale and\r\ngazes by the hour down through the crystal depths and notes the colors of\r\nthe pebbles and reviews the finny armies gliding in procession a hundred\r\nfeet below; when at night he sees moon and stars, mountain ridges\r\nfeathered with pines, jutting white capes, bold promontories, grand\r\nsweeps of rugged scenery topped with bald, glimmering peaks, all\r\nmagnificently pictured in the polished mirror of the lake, in richest,\r\nsoftest detail, the tranquil interest that was born with the morning\r\ndeepens and deepens, by sure degrees, till it culminates at last in\r\nresistless fascination!\r\n\r\nIt is solitude, for birds and squirrels on the shore and fishes in the\r\nwater are all the creatures that are near to make it otherwise, but it is\r\nnot the sort of solitude to make one dreary.  Come to Galilee for that.\r\nIf these unpeopled deserts, these rusty mounds of barrenness, that never,\r\nnever, never do shake the glare from their harsh outlines, and fade and\r\nfaint into vague perspective; that melancholy ruin of Capernaum; this\r\nstupid village of Tiberias, slumbering under its six funereal plumes of\r\npalms; yonder desolate declivity where the swine of the miracle ran down\r\ninto the sea, and doubtless thought it was better to swallow a devil or\r\ntwo and get drowned into the bargain than have to live longer in such a\r\nplace; this cloudless, blistering sky; this solemn, sailless, tintless\r\nlake, reposing within its rim of yellow hills and low, steep banks, and\r\nlooking just as expressionless and unpoetical (when we leave its sublime\r\nhistory out of the question,) as any metropolitan reservoir in\r\nChristendom--if these things are not food for rock me to sleep, mother,\r\nnone exist, I think.\r\n\r\nBut I should not offer the evidence for the prosecution and leave the\r\ndefense unheard.  Wm. C. Grimes deposes as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWe had taken ship to go over to the other side.  The sea was not\r\n     more than six miles wide.  Of the beauty of the scene, however, I\r\n     can not say enough, nor can I imagine where those travelers carried\r\n     their eyes who have described the scenery of the lake as tame or\r\n     uninteresting.  The first great characteristic of it is the deep\r\n     basin in which it lies.  This is from three to four hundred feet\r\n     deep on all sides except at the lower end, and the sharp slope of\r\n     the banks, which are all of the richest green, is broken and\r\n     diversified by the wadys and water-courses which work their way down\r\n     through the sides of the basin, forming dark chasms or light sunny\r\n     valleys.  Near Tiberias these banks are rocky, and ancient\r\n     sepulchres open in them, with their doors toward the water.  They\r\n     selected grand spots, as did the Egyptians of old, for burial\r\n     places, as if they designed that when the voice of God should reach\r\n     the sleepers, they should walk forth and open their eyes on scenes\r\n     of glorious beauty.  On the east, the wild and desolate mountains\r\n     contrast finely with the deep blue lake; and toward the north,\r\n     sublime and majestic, Hermon looks down on the sea, lifting his\r\n     white crown to heaven with the pride of a hill that has seen the\r\n     departing footsteps of a hundred generations.  On the north-east\r\n     shore of the sea was a single tree, and this is the only tree of any\r\n     size visible from the water of the lake, except a few lonely palms\r\n     in the city of Tiberias, and by its solitary position attracts more\r\n     attention than would a forest.  The whole appearance of the scene is\r\n     precisely what we would expect and desire the scenery of Genessaret\r\n     to be, grand beauty, but quiet calm.  The very mountains are calm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is an ingeniously written description, and well calculated to deceive.\r\nBut if the paint and the ribbons and the flowers be stripped from it, a\r\nskeleton will be found beneath.\r\n\r\nSo stripped, there remains a lake six miles wide and neutral in color;\r\nwith steep green banks, unrelieved by shrubbery; at one end bare,\r\nunsightly rocks, with (almost invisible) holes in them of no consequence\r\nto the picture; eastward, \xe2\x80\x9cwild and desolate mountains;\xe2\x80\x9d (low, desolate\r\nhills, he should have said;) in the north, a mountain called Hermon, with\r\nsnow on it; peculiarity of the picture, \xe2\x80\x9ccalmness;\xe2\x80\x9d its prominent\r\nfeature, one tree.\r\n\r\nNo ingenuity could make such a picture beautiful--to one's actual vision.\r\n\r\nI claim the right to correct misstatements, and have so corrected the\r\ncolor of the water in the above recapitulation.  The waters of Genessaret\r\nare of an exceedingly mild blue, even from a high elevation and a\r\ndistance of five miles.  Close at hand (the witness was sailing on the\r\nlake,) it is hardly proper to call them blue at all, much less \xe2\x80\x9cdeep\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n blue.  I wish to state, also, not as a correction, but as matter of\r\nopinion, that Mount Hermon is not a striking or picturesque mountain by\r\nany means, being too near the height of its immediate neighbors to be so.\r\nThat is all.  I do not object to the witness dragging a mountain\r\nforty-five miles to help the scenery under consideration, because it is\r\nentirely proper to do it, and besides, the picture needs it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cC. W. E.,\xe2\x80\x9d (of \xe2\x80\x9cLife in the Holy Land,\xe2\x80\x9d) deposes as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cA beautiful sea lies unbosomed among the Galilean hills, in the\r\n     midst of that land once possessed by Zebulon and Naphtali, Asher and\r\n     Dan.  The azure of the sky penetrates the depths of the lake, and\r\n     the waters are sweet and cool.  On the west, stretch broad fertile\r\n     plains; on the north the rocky shores rise step by step until in the\r\n     far distance tower the snowy heights of Hermon; on the east through\r\n     a misty veil are seen the high plains of Perea, which stretch away\r\n     in rugged mountains leading the mind by varied paths toward\r\n     Jerusalem the Holy.  Flowers bloom in this terrestrial paradise,\r\n     once beautiful and verdant with waving trees; singing birds enchant\r\n     the ear; the turtle-dove soothes with its soft note; the crested\r\n     lark sends up its song toward heaven, and the grave and stately\r\n     stork inspires the mind with thought, and leads it on to meditation\r\n     and repose.  Life here was once idyllic, charming; here were once no\r\n     rich, no poor, no high, no low.  It was a world of ease, simplicity,\r\n     and beauty; now it is a scene of desolation and misery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis is not an ingenious picture.  It is the worst I ever saw.  It\r\ndescribes in elaborate detail what it terms a \xe2\x80\x9cterrestrial paradise,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\ncloses with the startling information that this paradise is \xe2\x80\x9ca scene of\r\ndesolation and misery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI have given two fair, average specimens of the character of the\r\ntestimony offered by the majority of the writers who visit this region.\r\nOne says, \xe2\x80\x9cOf the beauty of the scene I can not say enough,\xe2\x80\x9d and then\r\nproceeds to cover up with a woof of glittering sentences a thing which,\r\nwhen stripped for inspection, proves to be only an unobtrusive basin of\r\nwater, some mountainous desolation, and one tree.  The other, after a\r\nconscientious effort to build a terrestrial paradise out of the same\r\nmaterials, with the addition of a \xe2\x80\x9cgrave and stately stork,\xe2\x80\x9d spoils it\r\nall by blundering upon the ghastly truth at the last.\r\n\r\nNearly every book concerning Galilee and its lake describes the scenery\r\nas beautiful.  No--not always so straightforward as that.  Sometimes the\r\nimpression intentionally conveyed is that it is beautiful, at the same\r\ntime that the author is careful not to say that it is, in plain Saxon.\r\nBut a careful analysis of these descriptions will show that the materials\r\nof which they are formed are not individually beautiful and can not be\r\nwrought into combinations that are beautiful.  The veneration and the\r\naffection which some of these men felt for the scenes they were speaking\r\nof, heated their fancies and biased their judgment; but the pleasant\r\nfalsities they wrote were full of honest sincerity, at any rate.  Others\r\nwrote as they did, because they feared it would be unpopular to write\r\notherwise.  Others were hypocrites and deliberately meant to deceive.\r\nAny of them would say in a moment, if asked, that it was always right and\r\nalways best to tell the truth.  They would say that, at any rate, if they\r\ndid not perceive the drift of the question.\r\n\r\nBut why should not the truth be spoken of this region?  Is the truth\r\nharmful?  Has it ever needed to hide its face?  God made the Sea of\r\nGalilee and its surroundings as they are.  Is it the province of Mr.\r\nGrimes to improve upon the work?\r\n\r\nI am sure, from the tenor of books I have read, that many who have\r\nvisited this land in years gone by, were Presbyterians, and came seeking\r\nevidences in support of their particular creed; they found a Presbyterian\r\nPalestine, and they had already made up their minds to find no other,\r\nthough possibly they did not know it, being blinded by their zeal.\r\nOthers were Baptists, seeking Baptist evidences and a Baptist Palestine.\r\nOthers were Catholics, Methodists, Episcopalians, seeking evidences\r\nindorsing their several creeds, and a Catholic, a Methodist, an\r\nEpiscopalian Palestine.  Honest as these men's intentions may have been,\r\nthey were full of partialities and prejudices, they entered the country\r\nwith their verdicts already prepared, and they could no more write\r\ndispassionately and impartially about it than they could about their own\r\nwives and children.  Our pilgrims have brought their verdicts with them.\r\nThey have shown it in their conversation ever since we left Beirout.\r\nI can almost tell, in set phrase, what they will say when they see Tabor,\r\nNazareth, Jericho and Jerusalem--because I have the books they will\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csmouch\xe2\x80\x9d their ideas from.  These authors write pictures and frame\r\nrhapsodies, and lesser men follow and see with the author's eyes instead\r\nof their own, and speak with his tongue.  What the pilgrims said at\r\nCesarea Philippi surprised me with its wisdom.  I found it afterwards in\r\nRobinson.  What they said when Genessaret burst upon their vision,\r\ncharmed me with its grace.  I find it in Mr. Thompson's \xe2\x80\x9cLand and the\r\nBook.\xe2\x80\x9d  They have spoken often, in happily worded language which never\r\nvaried, of how they mean to lay their weary heads upon a stone at Bethel,\r\nas Jacob did, and close their dim eyes, and dream, perchance, of angels\r\ndescending out of heaven on a ladder.  It was very pretty.  But I have\r\nrecognized the weary head and the dim eyes, finally.  They borrowed the\r\nidea--and the words--and the construction--and the punctuation--from\r\nGrimes.  The pilgrims will tell of Palestine, when they get home, not as\r\nit appeared to them, but as it appeared to Thompson and Robinson and\r\nGrimes--with the tints varied to suit each pilgrim's creed.\r\n\r\nPilgrims, sinners and Arabs are all abed, now, and the camp is still.\r\nLabor in loneliness is irksome.  Since I made my last few notes, I have\r\nbeen sitting outside the tent for half an hour.  Night is the time to see\r\nGalilee.  Genessaret under these lustrous stars has nothing repulsive\r\nabout it.  Genessaret with the glittering reflections of the\r\nconstellations flecking its surface, almost makes me regret that I ever\r\nsaw the rude glare of the day upon it.  Its history and its associations\r\nare its chiefest charm, in any eyes, and the spells they weave are feeble\r\nin the searching light of the sun.  Then, we scarcely feel the fetters.\r\nOur thoughts wander constantly to the practical concerns of life, and\r\nrefuse to dwell upon things that seem vague and unreal.  But when the day\r\nis done, even the most unimpressible must yield to the dreamy influences\r\nof this tranquil starlight.  The old traditions of the place steal upon\r\nhis memory and haunt his reveries, and then his fancy clothes all sights\r\nand sounds with the supernatural.  In the lapping of the waves upon the\r\nbeach, he hears the dip of ghostly oars; in the secret noises of the\r\nnight he hears spirit voices; in the soft sweep of the breeze, the rush\r\nof invisible wings.  Phantom ships are on the sea, the dead of twenty\r\ncenturies come forth from the tombs, and in the dirges of the night wind\r\nthe songs of old forgotten ages find utterance again.\r\n\r\nIn the starlight, Galilee has no boundaries but the broad compass of the\r\nheavens, and is a theatre meet for great events; meet for the birth of a\r\nreligion able to save a world; and meet for the stately Figure appointed\r\nto stand upon its stage and proclaim its high decrees.  But in the\r\nsunlight, one says: Is it for the deeds which were done and the words\r\nwhich were spoken in this little acre of rocks and sand eighteen\r\ncenturies gone, that the bells are ringing to-day in the remote islands\r\nof the sea and far and wide over continents that clasp the circumference\r\nof the huge globe?\r\n\r\nOne can comprehend it only when night has hidden all incongruities and\r\ncreated a theatre proper for so grand a drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nWe took another swim in the Sea of Galilee at twilight yesterday, and\r\nanother at sunrise this morning.  We have not sailed, but three swims are\r\nequal to a sail, are they not?  There were plenty of fish visible in the\r\nwater, but we have no outside aids in this pilgrimage but \xe2\x80\x9cTent Life in\r\nthe Holy Land,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Land and the Book,\xe2\x80\x9d and other literature of like\r\ndescription--no fishing-tackle.  There were no fish to be had in the\r\nvillage of Tiberias.  True, we saw two or three vagabonds mending their\r\nnets, but never trying to catch any thing with them.\r\n\r\nWe did not go to the ancient warm baths two miles below Tiberias.  I had\r\nno desire in the world to go there.  This seemed a little strange, and\r\nprompted me to try to discover what the cause of this unreasonable\r\nindifference was.  It turned out to be simply because Pliny mentions\r\nthem.  I have conceived a sort of unwarrantable unfriendliness toward\r\nPliny and St. Paul, because it seems as if I can never ferret out a place\r\nthat I can have to myself.  It always and eternally transpires that St.\r\nPaul has been to that place, and Pliny has \xe2\x80\x9cmentioned\xe2\x80\x9d it.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning we mounted and started.  And then a weird apparition\r\nmarched forth at the head of the procession--a pirate, I thought, if ever\r\na pirate dwelt upon land.  It was a tall Arab, as swarthy as an Indian;\r\nyoung-say thirty years of age.  On his head he had closely bound a\r\ngorgeous yellow and red striped silk scarf, whose ends, lavishly fringed\r\nwith tassels, hung down between his shoulders and dallied with the wind.\r\nFrom his neck to his knees, in ample folds, a robe swept down that was a\r\nvery star-spangled banner of curved and sinuous bars of black and white.\r\nOut of his back, somewhere, apparently, the long stem of a chibouk\r\nprojected, and reached far above his right shoulder.  Athwart his back,\r\ndiagonally, and extending high above his left shoulder, was an Arab gun\r\nof Saladin's time, that was splendid with silver plating from stock clear\r\nup to the end of its measureless stretch of barrel.  About his waist was\r\nbound many and many a yard of elaborately figured but sadly tarnished\r\nstuff that came from sumptuous Persia, and among the baggy folds in front\r\nthe sunbeams glinted from a formidable battery of old brass-mounted\r\nhorse-pistols and the gilded hilts of blood-thirsty knives.  There were\r\nholsters for more pistols appended to the wonderful stack of long-haired\r\ngoat-skins and Persian carpets, which the man had been taught to regard\r\nin the light of a saddle; and down among the pendulous rank of vast\r\ntassels that swung from that saddle, and clanging against the iron shovel\r\nof a stirrup that propped the warrior's knees up toward his chin, was a\r\ncrooked, silver-clad scimitar of such awful dimensions and such\r\nimplacable expression that no man might hope to look upon it and not\r\nshudder.  The fringed and bedizened prince whose privilege it is to ride\r\nthe pony and lead the elephant into a country village is poor and naked\r\ncompared to this chaos of paraphernalia, and the happy vanity of the one\r\nis the very poverty of satisfaction compared to the majestic serenity,\r\nthe overwhelming complacency of the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this?  What is this?\xe2\x80\x9d  That was the trembling inquiry all down\r\nthe line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur guard!  From Galilee to the birthplace of the Savior, the country is\r\ninfested with fierce Bedouins, whose sole happiness it is, in this life,\r\nto cut and stab and mangle and murder unoffending Christians.  Allah be\r\nwith us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen hire a regiment!  Would you send us out among these desperate\r\nhordes, with no salvation in our utmost need but this old turret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dragoman laughed--not at the facetiousness of the simile, for verily,\r\nthat guide or that courier or that dragoman never yet lived upon earth\r\nwho had in him the faintest appreciation of a joke, even though that joke\r\nwere so broad and so ponderous that if it fell on him it would flatten\r\nhim out like a postage stamp--the dragoman laughed, and then, emboldened\r\nby some thought that was in his brain, no doubt, proceeded to extremities\r\nand winked.\r\n\r\nIn straits like these, when a man laughs, it is encouraging when he\r\nwinks, it is positively reassuring.  He finally intimated that one guard\r\nwould be sufficient to protect us, but that that one was an absolute\r\nnecessity.  It was because of the moral weight his awful panoply would\r\nhave with the Bedouins.  Then I said we didn't want any guard at all.\r\nIf one fantastic vagabond could protect eight armed Christians and a pack\r\nof Arab servants from all harm, surely that detachment could protect\r\nthemselves.  He shook his head doubtfully.  Then I said, just think of\r\nhow it looks--think of how it would read, to self-reliant Americans, that\r\nwe went sneaking through this deserted wilderness under the protection of\r\nthis masquerading Arab, who would break his neck getting out of the\r\ncountry if a man that was a man ever started after him.  It was a mean,\r\nlow, degrading position.  Why were we ever told to bring navy revolvers\r\nwith us if we had to be protected at last by this infamous star-spangled\r\nscum of the desert?  These appeals were vain--the dragoman only smiled\r\nand shook his head.\r\n\r\nI rode to the front and struck up an acquaintance with King\r\nSolomon-in-all-his-glory, and got him to show me his lingering eternity\r\nof a gun. It had a rusty flint lock; it was ringed and barred and plated\r\nwith silver from end to end, but it was as desperately out of the\r\nperpendicular as are the billiard cues of '49 that one finds yet in\r\nservice in the ancient mining camps of California.  The muzzle was eaten\r\nby the rust of centuries into a ragged filigree-work, like the end of a\r\nburnt-out stove-pipe.  I shut one eye and peered within--it was flaked\r\nwith iron rust like an old steamboat boiler.  I borrowed the ponderous\r\npistols and snapped them.  They were rusty inside, too--had not been\r\nloaded for a generation.  I went back, full of encouragement, and\r\nreported to the guide, and asked him to discharge this dismantled\r\nfortress.  It came out, then.  This fellow was a retainer of the Sheik\r\nof Tiberias.  He was a source of Government revenue.  He was to the\r\nEmpire of Tiberias what the customs are to America.  The Sheik imposed\r\nguards upon travelers and charged them for it.  It is a lucrative source\r\nof emolument, and sometimes brings into the national treasury as much as\r\nthirty-five or forty dollars a year.\r\n\r\nI knew the warrior's secret now; I knew the hollow vanity of his rusty\r\ntrumpery, and despised his asinine complacency.  I told on him, and with\r\nreckless daring the cavalcade rode straight ahead into the perilous\r\nsolitudes of the desert, and scorned his frantic warnings of the\r\nmutilation and death that hovered about them on every side.\r\n\r\nArrived at an elevation of twelve hundred feet above the lake, (I ought\r\nto mention that the lake lies six hundred feet below the level of the\r\nMediterranean--no traveler ever neglects to flourish that fragment of\r\nnews in his letters,) as bald and unthrilling a panorama as any land can\r\nafford, perhaps, was spread out before us.  Yet it was so crowded with\r\nhistorical interest, that if all the pages that have been written about\r\nit were spread upon its surface, they would flag it from horizon to\r\nhorizon like a pavement.  Among the localities comprised in this view,\r\nwere Mount Hermon; the hills that border Cesarea Philippi, Dan, the\r\nSources of the Jordan and the Waters of Merom; Tiberias; the Sea of\r\nGalilee; Joseph's Pit; Capernaum; Bethsaida; the supposed scenes of the\r\nSermon on the Mount, the feeding of the multitudes and the miraculous\r\ndraught of fishes; the declivity down which the swine ran to the sea; the\r\nentrance and the exit of the Jordan; Safed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe city set upon a hill,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n one of the four holy cities of the Jews, and the place where they believe\r\nthe real Messiah will appear when he comes to redeem the world; part of\r\nthe battle-field of Hattin, where the knightly Crusaders fought their\r\nlast fight, and in a blaze of glory passed from the stage and ended their\r\nsplendid career forever; Mount Tabor, the traditional scene of the Lord's\r\nTransfiguration.  And down toward the southeast lay a landscape that\r\nsuggested to my mind a quotation (imperfectly remembered, no doubt:)\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ephraimites, not being called upon to share in the rich spoils\r\n     of the Ammonitish war, assembled a mighty host to fight against\r\n     Jeptha, Judge of Israel; who, being apprised of their approach,\r\n     gathered together the men of Israel and gave them battle and put\r\n     them to flight.  To make his victory the more secure, he stationed\r\n     guards at the different fords and passages of the Jordan, with\r\n     instructions to let none pass who could not say Shibboleth.  The\r\n     Ephraimites, being of a different tribe, could not frame to\r\n     pronounce the word right, but called it Sibboleth, which proved them\r\n     enemies and cost them their lives; wherefore, forty and two thousand\r\n     fell at the different fords and passages of the Jordan that day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe jogged along peacefully over the great caravan route from Damascus to\r\nJerusalem and Egypt, past Lubia and other Syrian hamlets, perched, in the\r\nunvarying style, upon the summit of steep mounds and hills, and fenced\r\nround about with giant cactuses, (the sign of worthless land,) with\r\nprickly pears upon them like hams, and came at last to the battle-field\r\nof Hattin.\r\n\r\nIt is a grand, irregular plateau, and looks as if it might have been\r\ncreated for a battle-field.  Here the peerless Saladin met the Christian\r\nhost some seven hundred years ago, and broke their power in Palestine for\r\nall time to come.  There had long been a truce between the opposing\r\nforces, but according to the Guide-Book, Raynauld of Chatillon, Lord of\r\nKerak, broke it by plundering a Damascus caravan, and refusing to give up\r\neither the merchants or their goods when Saladin demanded them.  This\r\nconduct of an insolent petty chieftain stung the Sultan to the quick, and\r\nhe swore that he would slaughter Raynauld with his own hand, no matter\r\nhow, or when, or where he found him.  Both armies prepared for war.\r\nUnder the weak King of Jerusalem was the very flower of the Christian\r\nchivalry.  He foolishly compelled them to undergo a long, exhausting\r\nmarch, in the scorching sun, and then, without water or other\r\nrefreshment, ordered them to encamp in this open plain.  The splendidly\r\nmounted masses of Moslem soldiers swept round the north end of\r\nGenessaret, burning and destroying as they came, and pitched their camp\r\nin front of the opposing lines.  At dawn the terrific fight began.\r\nSurrounded on all sides by the Sultan's swarming battalions, the\r\nChristian Knights fought on without a hope for their lives.  They fought\r\nwith desperate valor, but to no purpose; the odds of heat and numbers,\r\nand consuming thirst, were too great against them.  Towards the middle of\r\nthe day the bravest of their band cut their way through the Moslem ranks\r\nand gained the summit of a little hill, and there, hour after hour, they\r\nclosed around the banner of the Cross, and beat back the charging\r\nsquadrons of the enemy.\r\n\r\nBut the doom of the Christian power was sealed.  Sunset found Saladin\r\nLord of Palestine, the Christian chivalry strewn in heaps upon the field,\r\nand the King of Jerusalem, the Grand Master of the Templars, and Raynauld\r\nof Chatillon, captives in the Sultan's tent.  Saladin treated two of the\r\nprisoners with princely courtesy, and ordered refreshments to be set\r\nbefore them.  When the King handed an iced Sherbet to Chatillon, the\r\nSultan said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is thou that givest it to him, not I.\xe2\x80\x9d  He remembered\r\nhis oath, and slaughtered the hapless Knight of Chatillon with his own\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to realize that this silent plain had once resounded with\r\nmartial music and trembled to the tramp of armed men.  It was hard to\r\npeople this solitude with rushing columns of cavalry, and stir its torpid\r\npulses with the shouts of victors, the shrieks of the wounded, and the\r\nflash of banner and steel above the surging billows of war.  A desolation\r\nis here that not even imagination can grace with the pomp of life and\r\naction.\r\n\r\nWe reached Tabor safely, and considerably in advance of that old\r\niron-clad swindle of a guard.  We never saw a human being on the whole\r\nroute, much less lawless hordes of Bedouins.  Tabor stands solitary and\r\nalone, a giant sentinel above the Plain of Esdraelon.  It rises some\r\nfourteen hundred feet above the surrounding level, a green, wooden cone,\r\nsymmetrical and full of grace--a prominent landmark, and one that is\r\nexceedingly pleasant to eyes surfeited with the repulsive monotony of\r\ndesert Syria.  We climbed the steep path to its summit, through breezy\r\nglades of thorn and oak.  The view presented from its highest peak was\r\nalmost beautiful.  Below, was the broad, level plain of Esdraelon,\r\ncheckered with fields like a chess-board, and full as smooth and level,\r\nseemingly; dotted about its borders with white, compact villages, and\r\nfaintly penciled, far and near, with the curving lines of roads and\r\ntrails.  When it is robed in the fresh verdure of spring, it must form a\r\ncharming picture, even by itself.  Skirting its southern border rises\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle Hermon,\xe2\x80\x9d over whose summit a glimpse of Gilboa is caught.  Nain,\r\nfamous for the raising of the widow's son, and Endor, as famous for the\r\nperformances of her witch are in view.  To the eastward lies the Valley\r\nof the Jordan and beyond it the mountains of Gilead.  Westward is Mount\r\nCarmel.  Hermon in the north--the table-lands of Bashan--Safed, the holy\r\ncity, gleaming white upon a tall spur of the mountains of Lebanon\r\n--a steel-blue corner of the Sea of Galilee--saddle-peaked Hattin,\r\ntraditional \xe2\x80\x9cMount of Beatitudes\xe2\x80\x9d and mute witness to brave fights of the\r\nCrusading host for Holy Cross--these fill up the picture.\r\n\r\nTo glance at the salient features of this landscape through the\r\npicturesque framework of a ragged and ruined stone window--arch of the\r\ntime of Christ, thus hiding from sight all that is unattractive, is to\r\nsecure to yourself a pleasure worth climbing the mountain to enjoy.  One\r\nmust stand on his head to get the best effect in a fine sunset, and set a\r\nlandscape in a bold, strong framework that is very close at hand, to\r\nbring out all its beauty.  One learns this latter truth never more to\r\nforget it, in that mimic land of enchantment, the wonderful garden of my\r\nlord the Count Pallavicini, near Genoa.  You go wandering for hours among\r\nhills and wooded glens, artfully contrived to leave the impression that\r\nNature shaped them and not man; following winding paths and coming\r\nsuddenly upon leaping cascades and rustic bridges; finding sylvan lakes\r\nwhere you expected them not; loitering through battered mediaeval castles\r\nin miniature that seem hoary with age and yet were built a dozen years\r\nago; meditating over ancient crumbling tombs, whose marble columns were\r\nmarred and broken purposely by the modern artist that made them;\r\nstumbling unawares upon toy palaces, wrought of rare and costly\r\nmaterials, and again upon a peasant's hut, whose dilapidated furniture\r\nwould never suggest that it was made so to order; sweeping round and\r\nround in the midst of a forest on an enchanted wooden horse that is moved\r\nby some invisible agency; traversing Roman roads and passing under\r\nmajestic triumphal arches; resting in quaint bowers where unseen spirits\r\ndischarge jets of water on you from every possible direction, and where\r\neven the flowers you touch assail you with a shower; boating on a\r\nsubterranean lake among caverns and arches royally draped with clustering\r\nstalactites, and passing out into open day upon another lake, which is\r\nbordered with sloping banks of grass and gay with patrician barges that\r\nswim at anchor in the shadow of a miniature marble temple that rises out\r\nof the clear water and glasses its white statues, its rich capitals and\r\nfluted columns in the tranquil depths.  So, from marvel to marvel you\r\nhave drifted on, thinking all the time that the one last seen must be the\r\nchiefest.  And, verily, the chiefest wonder is reserved until the last,\r\nbut you do not see it until you step ashore, and passing through a\r\nwilderness of rare flowers, collected from every corner of the earth, you\r\nstand at the door of one more mimic temple.  Right in this place the\r\nartist taxed his genius to the utmost, and fairly opened the gates of\r\nfairy land.  You look through an unpretending pane of glass, stained\r\nyellow--the first thing you see is a mass of quivering foliage, ten short\r\nsteps before you, in the midst of which is a ragged opening like a\r\ngateway-a thing that is common enough in nature, and not apt to excite\r\nsuspicions of a deep human design--and above the bottom of the gateway,\r\nproject, in the most careless way! a few broad tropic leaves and\r\nbrilliant flowers.  All of a sudden, through this bright, bold gateway,\r\nyou catch a glimpse of the faintest, softest, richest picture that ever\r\ngraced the dream of a dying Saint, since John saw the New Jerusalem\r\nglimmering above the clouds of Heaven.  A broad sweep of sea, flecked\r\nwith careening sails; a sharp, jutting cape, and a lofty lighthouse on\r\nit; a sloping lawn behind it; beyond, a portion of the old \xe2\x80\x9ccity of\r\npalaces,\xe2\x80\x9d with its parks and hills and stately mansions; beyond these, a\r\nprodigious mountain, with its strong outlines sharply cut against ocean\r\nand sky; and over all, vagrant shreds and flakes of cloud, floating in a\r\nsea of gold.  The ocean is gold, the city is gold, the meadow, the\r\nmountain, the sky--every thing is golden-rich, and mellow, and dreamy as\r\na vision of Paradise.  No artist could put upon canvas, its entrancing\r\nbeauty, and yet, without the yellow glass, and the carefully contrived\r\naccident of a framework that cast it into enchanted distance and shut out\r\nfrom it all unattractive features, it was not a picture to fall into\r\necstasies over.  Such is life, and the trail of the serpent is over us\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing for it now but to come back to old Tabor, though the\r\nsubject is tiresome enough, and I can not stick to it for wandering off\r\nto scenes that are pleasanter to remember.  I think I will skip, any how.\r\nThere is nothing about Tabor (except we concede that it was the scene of\r\nthe Transfiguration,) but some gray old ruins, stacked up there in all\r\nages of the world from the days of stout Gideon and parties that\r\nflourished thirty centuries ago to the fresh yesterday of Crusading\r\ntimes.  It has its Greek Convent, and the coffee there is good, but never\r\na splinter of the true cross or bone of a hallowed saint to arrest the\r\nidle thoughts of worldlings and turn them into graver channels.\r\nA Catholic church is nothing to me that has no relics.\r\n\r\nThe plain of Esdraelon--\xe2\x80\x9cthe battle-field of the nations\xe2\x80\x9d--only sets one\r\nto dreaming of Joshua, and Benhadad, and Saul, and Gideon; Tamerlane,\r\nTancred, Coeur de Lion, and Saladin; the warrior Kings of Persia, Egypt's\r\nheroes, and Napoleon--for they all fought here.  If the magic of the\r\nmoonlight could summon from the graves of forgotten centuries and many\r\nlands the countless myriads that have battled on this wide, far-reaching\r\nfloor, and array them in the thousand strange Costumes of their hundred\r\nnationalities, and send the vast host sweeping down the plain, splendid\r\nwith plumes and banners and glittering lances, I could stay here an age\r\nto see the phantom pageant.  But the magic of the moonlight is a vanity\r\nand a fraud; and whoso putteth his trust in it shall suffer sorrow and\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nDown at the foot of Tabor, and just at the edge of the storied Plain of\r\nEsdraelon, is the insignificant village of Deburieh, where Deborah,\r\nprophetess of Israel, lived.  It is just like Magdala.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nWe descended from Mount Tabor, crossed a deep ravine, followed a hilly,\r\nrocky road to Nazareth--distant two hours.  All distances in the East are\r\nmeasured by hours, not miles.  A good horse will walk three miles an hour\r\nover nearly any kind of a road; therefore, an hour, here, always stands\r\nfor three miles.  This method of computation is bothersome and annoying;\r\nand until one gets thoroughly accustomed to it, it carries no\r\nintelligence to his mind until he has stopped and translated the pagan\r\nhours into Christian miles, just as people do with the spoken words of a\r\nforeign language they are acquainted with, but not familiarly enough to\r\ncatch the meaning in a moment.  Distances traveled by human feet are also\r\nestimated by hours and minutes, though I do not know what the base of the\r\ncalculation is.  In Constantinople you ask, \xe2\x80\x9cHow far is it to the\r\nConsulate?\xe2\x80\x9d and they answer, \xe2\x80\x9cAbout ten minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cHow far is it to the\r\nLloyds' Agency?\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cQuarter of an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cHow far is it to the lower\r\nbridge?\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cFour minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  I can not be positive about it, but I think\r\nthat there, when a man orders a pair of pantaloons, he says he wants them\r\na quarter of a minute in the legs and nine seconds around the waist.\r\n\r\nTwo hours from Tabor to Nazareth--and as it was an uncommonly narrow,\r\ncrooked trail, we necessarily met all the camel trains and jackass\r\ncaravans between Jericho and Jacksonville in that particular place and\r\nnowhere else.  The donkeys do not matter so much, because they are so\r\nsmall that you can jump your horse over them if he is an animal of\r\nspirit, but a camel is not jumpable.  A camel is as tall as any ordinary\r\ndwelling-house in Syria--which is to say a camel is from one to two, and\r\nsometimes nearly three feet taller than a good-sized man.  In this part\r\nof the country his load is oftenest in the shape of colossal sacks--one\r\non each side.  He and his cargo take up as much room as a carriage.\r\nThink of meeting this style of obstruction in a narrow trail.  The camel\r\nwould not turn out for a king.  He stalks serenely along, bringing his\r\ncushioned stilts forward with the long, regular swing of a pendulum, and\r\nwhatever is in the way must get out of the way peaceably, or be wiped out\r\nforcibly by the bulky sacks.  It was a tiresome ride to us, and perfectly\r\nexhausting to the horses.  We were compelled to jump over upwards of\r\neighteen hundred donkeys, and only one person in the party was unseated\r\nless than sixty times by the camels.  This seems like a powerful\r\nstatement, but the poet has said, \xe2\x80\x9cThings are not what they seem.\xe2\x80\x9d  I can\r\nnot think of any thing, now, more certain to make one shudder, than to\r\nhave a soft-footed camel sneak up behind him and touch him on the ear\r\nwith its cold, flabby under-lip.  A camel did this for one of the boys,\r\nwho was drooping over his saddle in a brown study.  He glanced up and saw\r\nthe majestic apparition hovering above him, and made frantic efforts to\r\nget out of the way, but the camel reached out and bit him on the shoulder\r\nbefore he accomplished it.  This was the only pleasant incident of the\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nAt Nazareth we camped in an olive grove near the Virgin Mary's fountain,\r\nand that wonderful Arab \xe2\x80\x9cguard\xe2\x80\x9d came to collect some bucksheesh for his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cservices\xe2\x80\x9d in following us from Tiberias and warding off invisible\r\ndangers with the terrors of his armament.  The dragoman had paid his\r\nmaster, but that counted as nothing--if you hire a man to sneeze for you,\r\nhere, and another man chooses to help him, you have got to pay both.\r\nThey do nothing whatever without pay.  How it must have surprised these\r\npeople to hear the way of salvation offered to them \xe2\x80\x9cwithout money and\r\nwithout price.\xe2\x80\x9d  If the manners, the people or the customs of this\r\ncountry have changed since the Saviour's time, the figures and metaphors\r\nof the Bible are not the evidences to prove it by.\r\n\r\nWe entered the great Latin Convent which is built over the traditional\r\ndwelling-place of the Holy Family.  We went down a flight of fifteen\r\nsteps below the ground level, and stood in a small chapel tricked out\r\nwith tapestry hangings, silver lamps, and oil paintings.  A spot marked\r\nby a cross, in the marble floor, under the altar, was exhibited as the\r\nplace made forever holy by the feet of the Virgin when she stood up to\r\nreceive the message of the angel.  So simple, so unpretending a locality,\r\nto be the scene of so mighty an event!  The very scene of the\r\nAnnunciation--an event which has been commemorated by splendid shrines\r\nand august temples all over the civilized world, and one which the\r\nprinces of art have made it their loftiest ambition to picture worthily\r\non their canvas; a spot whose history is familiar to the very children of\r\nevery house, and city, and obscure hamlet of the furthest lands of\r\nChristendom; a spot which myriads of men would toil across the breadth of\r\na world to see, would consider it a priceless privilege to look upon.\r\nIt was easy to think these thoughts.  But it was not easy to bring myself\r\nup to the magnitude of the situation.  I could sit off several thousand\r\nmiles and imagine the angel appearing, with shadowy wings and lustrous\r\ncountenance, and note the glory that streamed downward upon the Virgin's\r\nhead while the message from the Throne of God fell upon her ears--any one\r\ncan do that, beyond the ocean, but few can do it here.  I saw the little\r\nrecess from which the angel stepped, but could not fill its void.  The\r\nangels that I know are creatures of unstable fancy--they will not fit in\r\nniches of substantial stone.  Imagination labors best in distant fields.\r\nI doubt if any man can stand in the Grotto of the Annunciation and people\r\nwith the phantom images of his mind its too tangible walls of stone.\r\n\r\nThey showed us a broken granite pillar, depending from the roof, which\r\nthey said was hacked in two by the Moslem conquerors of Nazareth, in the\r\nvain hope of pulling down the sanctuary.  But the pillar remained\r\nmiraculously suspended in the air, and, unsupported itself, supported\r\nthen and still supports the roof.  By dividing this statement up among\r\neight, it was found not difficult to believe it.\r\n\r\nThese gifted Latin monks never do any thing by halves.  If they were to\r\nshow you the Brazen Serpent that was elevated in the wilderness, you\r\ncould depend upon it that they had on hand the pole it was elevated on\r\nalso, and even the hole it stood in.  They have got the \xe2\x80\x9cGrotto\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\nAnnunciation here; and just as convenient to it as one's throat is to his\r\nmouth, they have also the Virgin's Kitchen, and even her sitting-room,\r\nwhere she and Joseph watched the infant Saviour play with Hebrew toys\r\neighteen hundred years ago.  All under one roof, and all clean, spacious,\r\ncomfortable \xe2\x80\x9cgrottoes.\xe2\x80\x9d  It seems curious that personages intimately\r\nconnected with the Holy Family always lived in grottoes--in Nazareth, in\r\nBethlehem, in imperial Ephesus--and yet nobody else in their day and\r\ngeneration thought of doing any thing of the kind.  If they ever did,\r\ntheir grottoes are all gone, and I suppose we ought to wonder at the\r\npeculiar marvel of the preservation of these I speak of.  When the Virgin\r\nfled from Herod's wrath, she hid in a grotto in Bethlehem, and the same\r\nis there to this day.  The slaughter of the innocents in Bethlehem was\r\ndone in a grotto; the Saviour was born in a grotto--both are shown to\r\npilgrims yet.  It is exceedingly strange that these tremendous events all\r\nhappened in grottoes--and exceedingly fortunate, likewise, because the\r\nstrongest houses must crumble to ruin in time, but a grotto in the living\r\nrock will last forever.  It is an imposture--this grotto stuff--but it is\r\none that all men ought to thank the Catholics for.  Wherever they ferret\r\nout a lost locality made holy by some Scriptural event, they straightway\r\nbuild a massive--almost imperishable--church there, and preserve the\r\nmemory of that locality for the gratification of future generations.  If\r\nit had been left to Protestants to do this most worthy work, we would not\r\neven know where Jerusalem is to-day, and the man who could go and put his\r\nfinger on Nazareth would be too wise for this world.  The world owes the\r\nCatholics its good will even for the happy rascality of hewing out these\r\nbogus grottoes in the rock; for it is infinitely more satisfactory to\r\nlook at a grotto, where people have faithfully believed for centuries\r\nthat the Virgin once lived, than to have to imagine a dwelling-place for\r\nher somewhere, any where, nowhere, loose and at large all over this town\r\nof Nazareth.  There is too large a scope of country.  The imagination can\r\nnot work.  There is no one particular spot to chain your eye, rivet your\r\ninterest, and make you think.  The memory of the Pilgrims can not perish\r\nwhile Plymouth Rock remains to us.  The old monks are wise.  They know\r\nhow to drive a stake through a pleasant tradition that will hold it to\r\nits place forever.\r\n\r\nWe visited the places where Jesus worked for fifteen years as a\r\ncarpenter, and where he attempted to teach in the synagogue and was\r\ndriven out by a mob.  Catholic chapels stand upon these sites and protect\r\nthe little fragments of the ancient walls which remain.  Our pilgrims\r\nbroke off specimens.  We visited, also, a new chapel, in the midst of the\r\ntown, which is built around a boulder some twelve feet long by four feet\r\nthick; the priests discovered, a few years ago, that the disciples had\r\nsat upon this rock to rest, once, when they had walked up from Capernaum.\r\nThey hastened to preserve the relic.  Relics are very good property.\r\nTravelers are expected to pay for seeing them, and they do it cheerfully.\r\nWe like the idea.  One's conscience can never be the worse for the\r\nknowledge that he has paid his way like a man.  Our pilgrims would have\r\nliked very well to get out their lampblack and stencil-plates and paint\r\ntheir names on that rock, together with the names of the villages they\r\nhail from in America, but the priests permit nothing of that kind.\r\nTo speak the strict truth, however, our party seldom offend in that way,\r\nthough we have men in the ship who never lose an opportunity to do it.\r\nOur pilgrims' chief sin is their lust for \xe2\x80\x9cspecimens.\xe2\x80\x9d  I suppose that by\r\nthis time they know the dimensions of that rock to an inch, and its\r\nweight to a ton; and I do not hesitate to charge that they will go back\r\nthere to-night and try to carry it off.\r\n\r\nThis \xe2\x80\x9cFountain of the Virgin\xe2\x80\x9d is the one which tradition says Mary used\r\nto get water from, twenty times a day, when she was a girl, and bear it\r\naway in a jar upon her head.  The water streams through faucets in the\r\nface of a wall of ancient masonry which stands removed from the houses of\r\nthe village.  The young girls of Nazareth still collect about it by the\r\ndozen and keep up a riotous laughter and sky-larking.  The Nazarene girls\r\nare homely.  Some of them have large, lustrous eyes, but none of them\r\nhave pretty faces.  These girls wear a single garment, usually, and it is\r\nloose, shapeless, of undecided color; it is generally out of repair, too.\r\nThey wear, from crown to jaw, curious strings of old coins, after the\r\nmanner of the belles of Tiberias, and brass jewelry upon their wrists and\r\nin their ears.  They wear no shoes and stockings.  They are the most\r\nhuman girls we have found in the country yet, and the best natured.\r\nBut there is no question that these picturesque maidens sadly lack\r\ncomeliness.\r\n\r\nA pilgrim--the \xe2\x80\x9cEnthusiast\xe2\x80\x9d--said: \xe2\x80\x9cSee that tall, graceful girl! look at\r\nthe Madonna-like beauty of her countenance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother pilgrim came along presently and said: \xe2\x80\x9cObserve that tall,\r\ngraceful girl; what queenly Madonna-like gracefulness of beauty is in her\r\ncountenance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said: \xe2\x80\x9cShe is not tall, she is short; she is not beautiful, she is\r\nhomely; she is graceful enough, I grant, but she is rather boisterous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe third and last pilgrim moved by, before long, and he said: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, what\r\na tall, graceful girl! what Madonna-like gracefulness of queenly beauty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe verdicts were all in.  It was time, now, to look up the authorities\r\nfor all these opinions.  I found this paragraph, which follows.  Written\r\nby whom?  Wm. C. Grimes:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAfter we were in the saddle, we rode down to the spring to have a\r\n     last look at the women of Nazareth, who were, as a class, much the\r\n     prettiest that we had seen in the East.  As we approached the crowd\r\n     a tall girl of nineteen advanced toward Miriam and offered her a cup\r\n     of water.  Her movement was graceful and queenly.  We exclaimed on\r\n     the spot at the Madonna-like beauty of her countenance.  Whitely was\r\n     suddenly thirsty, and begged for water, and drank it slowly, with\r\n     his eyes over the top of the cup, fixed on her large black eyes,\r\n     which gazed on him quite as curiously as he on her.  Then Moreright\r\n     wanted water.  She gave it to him and he managed to spill it so as\r\n     to ask for another cup, and by the time she came to me she saw\r\n     through the operation; her eyes were full of fun as she looked at\r\n     me.  I laughed outright, and she joined me in as gay a shout as ever\r\n     country maiden in old Orange county.  I wished for a picture of her.\r\n     A Madonna, whose face was a portrait of that beautiful Nazareth\r\n     girl, would be a 'thing of beauty' and 'a joy forever.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat is the kind of gruel which has been served out from Palestine for\r\nages.  Commend me to Fennimore Cooper to find beauty in the Indians, and\r\nto Grimes to find it in the Arabs.  Arab men are often fine looking, but\r\nArab women are not.  We can all believe that the Virgin Mary was\r\nbeautiful; it is not natural to think otherwise; but does it follow that\r\nit is our duty to find beauty in these present women of Nazareth?\r\n\r\nI love to quote from Grimes, because he is so dramatic.  And because he\r\nis so romantic.  And because he seems to care but little whether he tells\r\nthe truth or not, so he scares the reader or excites his envy or his\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nHe went through this peaceful land with one hand forever on his revolver,\r\nand the other on his pocket-handkerchief.  Always, when he was not on the\r\npoint of crying over a holy place, he was on the point of killing an\r\nArab.  More surprising things happened to him in Palestine than ever\r\nhappened to any traveler here or elsewhere since Munchausen died.\r\n\r\nAt Beit Jin, where nobody had interfered with him, he crept out of his\r\ntent at dead of night and shot at what he took to be an Arab lying on a\r\nrock, some distance away, planning evil.  The ball killed a wolf.  Just\r\nbefore he fired, he makes a dramatic picture of himself--as usual, to\r\nscare the reader:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWas it imagination, or did I see a moving object on the surface of\r\n     the rock?  If it were a man, why did he not now drop me?  He had a\r\n     beautiful shot as I stood out in my black boornoose against the\r\n     white tent.  I had the sensation of an entering bullet in my throat,\r\n     breast, brain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReckless creature!\r\n\r\nRiding toward Genessaret, they saw two Bedouins, and \xe2\x80\x9cwe looked to our\r\npistols and loosened them quietly in our shawls,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.  Always cool.\r\n\r\nIn Samaria, he charged up a hill, in the face of a volley of stones; he\r\nfired into the crowd of men who threw them.  He says:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI never lost an opportunity of impressing the Arabs with the\r\n     perfection of American and English weapons, and the danger of\r\n     attacking any one of the armed Franks.  I think the lesson of that\r\n     ball not lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt Beit Jin he gave his whole band of Arab muleteers a piece of his mind,\r\nand then--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI contented myself with a solemn assurance that if there occurred\r\n     another instance of disobedience to orders I would thrash the\r\n     responsible party as he never dreamed of being thrashed, and if I\r\n     could not find who was responsible, I would whip them all, from\r\n     first to last, whether there was a governor at hand to do it or I\r\n     had to do it myself\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerfectly fearless, this man.\r\n\r\nHe rode down the perpendicular path in the rocks, from the Castle of\r\nBanias to the oak grove, at a flying gallop, his horse striding \xe2\x80\x9cthirty\r\nfeet\xe2\x80\x9d at every bound.  I stand prepared to bring thirty reliable\r\nwitnesses to prove that Putnam's famous feat at Horseneck was\r\ninsignificant compared to this.\r\n\r\nBehold him--always theatrical--looking at Jerusalem--this time, by an\r\noversight, with his hand off his pistol for once.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI stood in the road, my hand on my horse's neck, and with my dim\r\n     eyes sought to trace the outlines of the holy places which I had\r\n     long before fixed in my mind, but the fast-flowing tears forbade my\r\n     succeeding.  There were our Mohammedan servants, a Latin monk, two\r\n     Armenians and a Jew in our cortege, and all alike gazed with\r\n     overflowing eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Latin monks and Arabs cried, I know to a moral certainty that the\r\nhorses cried also, and so the picture is complete.\r\n\r\nBut when necessity demanded, he could be firm as adamant.  In the Lebanon\r\nValley an Arab youth--a Christian; he is particular to explain that\r\nMohammedans do not steal--robbed him of a paltry ten dollars' worth of\r\npowder and shot.  He convicted him before a sheik and looked on while he\r\nwas punished by the terrible bastinado.  Hear him:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cHe (Mousa) was on his back in a twinkling, howling, shouting,\r\n     screaming, but he was carried out to the piazza before the door,\r\n     where we could see the operation, and laid face down.  One man sat\r\n     on his back and one on his legs, the latter holding up his feet,\r\n     while a third laid on the bare soles a rhinoceros-hide koorbash\r\n     --[\xe2\x80\x9cA Koorbash is Arabic for cowhide, the cow being a rhinoceros.\r\n     It is the most cruel whip known to fame.  Heavy as lead, and\r\n     flexible as India-rubber, usually about forty inches long and\r\n     tapering gradually from an inch in diameter to a point, it\r\n     administers a blow which leaves its mark for time.\xe2\x80\x9d--Scow Life in\r\n     Egypt, by the same author.]--that whizzed through the air at every\r\n     stroke.  Poor Moreright was in agony, and Nama and Nama the Second\r\n     (mother and sister of Mousa,) were on their faces begging and\r\n     wailing, now embracing my knees and now Whitely's, while the\r\n     brother, outside, made the air ring with cries louder than Mousa's.\r\n     Even Yusef came and asked me on his knees to relent, and last of\r\n     all, Betuni--the rascal had lost a feed-bag in their house and had\r\n     been loudest in his denunciations that morning--besought the Howajji\r\n     to have mercy on the fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut not he!  The punishment was \xe2\x80\x9csuspended,\xe2\x80\x9d at the fifteenth blow to\r\nhear the confession.  Then Grimes and his party rode away, and left the\r\nentire Christian family to be fined and as severely punished as the\r\nMohammedan sheik should deem proper.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAs I mounted, Yusef once more begged me to interfere and have mercy\r\n     on them, but I looked around at the dark faces of the crowd, and I\r\n     couldn't find one drop of pity in my heart for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe closes his picture with a rollicking burst of humor which contrasts\r\nfinely with the grief of the mother and her children.\r\n\r\nOne more paragraph:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThen once more I bowed my head.  It is no shame to have wept in\r\n     Palestine.  I wept, when I saw Jerusalem, I wept when I lay in the\r\n     starlight at Bethlehem.  I wept on the blessed shores of Galilee.\r\n     My hand was no less firm on the rein, my anger did not tremble on\r\n     the trigger of my pistol when I rode with it in my right hand along\r\n     the shore of the blue sea\xe2\x80\x9d (weeping.) \xe2\x80\x9cMy eye was not dimmed by\r\n     those tears nor my heart in aught weakened.  Let him who would sneer\r\n     at my emotion close this volume here, for he will find little to his\r\n     taste in my journeyings through Holy Land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe never bored but he struck water.\r\n\r\nI am aware that this is a pretty voluminous notice of Mr. Grimes' book.\r\nHowever, it is proper and legitimate to speak of it, for \xe2\x80\x9cNomadic Life in\r\nPalestine\xe2\x80\x9d is a representative book--the representative of a class of\r\nPalestine books--and a criticism upon it will serve for a criticism upon\r\nthem all.  And since I am treating it in the comprehensive capacity of a\r\nrepresentative book, I have taken the liberty of giving to both book and\r\nauthor fictitious names.  Perhaps it is in better taste, any how, to do\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nNazareth is wonderfully interesting because the town has an air about it\r\nof being precisely as Jesus left it, and one finds himself saying, all\r\nthe time, \xe2\x80\x9cThe boy Jesus has stood in this doorway--has played in that\r\nstreet--has touched these stones with his hands--has rambled over these\r\nchalky hills.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whoever shall write the boyhood of Jesus ingeniously will\r\nmake a book which will possess a vivid interest for young and old alike.\r\nI judge so from the greater interest we found in Nazareth than any of our\r\nspeculations upon Capernaum and the Sea of Galilee gave rise to.  It was\r\nnot possible, standing by the Sea of Galilee, to frame more than a vague,\r\nfar-away idea of the majestic Personage who walked upon the crested waves\r\nas if they had been solid earth, and who touched the dead and they rose\r\nup and spoke.  I read among my notes, now, with a new interest, some\r\nsentences from an edition of 1621 of the Apocryphal New Testament.\r\n[Extract.]\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cChrist, kissed by a bride made dumb by sorcerers, cures her.  A\r\n     leprous girl cured by the water in which the infant Christ was\r\n     washed, and becomes the servant of Joseph and Mary.  The leprous son\r\n     of a Prince cured in like manner.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cA young man who had been bewitched and turned into a mule,\r\n     miraculously cured by the infant Savior being put on his back, and\r\n     is married to the girl who had been cured of leprosy.  Whereupon the\r\n     bystanders praise God.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cChapter 16.  Christ miraculously widens or contracts gates,\r\n     milk-pails, sieves or boxes, not properly made by Joseph, he not\r\n     being skillful at his carpenter's trade.  The King of Jerusalem\r\n     gives Joseph an order for a throne.  Joseph works on it for two\r\n     years and makes it two spans too short.  The King being angry with\r\n     him, Jesus comforts him--commands him to pull one side of the\r\n     throne while he pulls the other, and brings it to its proper\r\n     dimensions.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cChapter 19.  Jesus, charged with throwing a boy from the roof of a\r\n     house, miraculously causes the dead boy to speak and acquit him;\r\n     fetches water for his mother, breaks the pitcher and miraculously\r\n     gathers the water in his mantle and brings it home.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cSent to a schoolmaster, refuses to tell his letters, and the\r\n     schoolmaster going to whip him, his hand withers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFurther on in this quaint volume of rejected gospels is an epistle of St.\r\nClement to the Corinthians, which was used in the churches and considered\r\ngenuine fourteen or fifteen hundred years ago.  In it this account of the\r\nfabled phoenix occurs:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c1.  Let us consider that wonderful type of the resurrection, which\r\n     is seen in the Eastern countries, that is to say, in Arabia.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c2.  There is a certain bird called a phoenix.  Of this there is\r\n     never but one at a time, and that lives five hundred years.  And\r\n     when the time of its dissolution draws near, that it must die, it\r\n     makes itself a nest of frankincense, and myrrh, and other spices,\r\n     into which, when its time is fulfilled, it enters and dies.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c3.  But its flesh, putrefying, breeds a certain worm, which, being\r\n     nourished by the juice of the dead bird, brings forth feathers; and\r\n     when it is grown to a perfect state, it takes up the nest in which\r\n     the bones of its parent lie, and carries it from Arabia into Egypt,\r\n     to a city called Heliopolis:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c4.  And flying in open day in the sight of all men, lays it upon\r\n     the altar of the sun, and so returns from whence it came.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c5.  The priests then search into the records of the time, and find\r\n     that it returned precisely at the end of five hundred years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBusiness is business, and there is nothing like punctuality, especially\r\nin a phoenix.\r\n\r\nThe few chapters relating to the infancy of the Saviour contain many\r\nthings which seem frivolous and not worth preserving.  A large part of\r\nthe remaining portions of the book read like good Scripture, however.\r\nThere is one verse that ought not to have been rejected, because it so\r\nevidently prophetically refers to the general run of Congresses of the\r\nUnited States:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c199.  They carry themselves high, and as prudent men; and though\r\n     they are fools, yet would seem to be teachers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI have set these extracts down, as I found them.  Everywhere among the\r\ncathedrals of France and Italy, one finds traditions of personages that\r\ndo not figure in the Bible, and of miracles that are not mentioned in its\r\npages.  But they are all in this Apocryphal New Testament, and though\r\nthey have been ruled out of our modern Bible, it is claimed that they\r\nwere accepted gospel twelve or fifteen centuries ago, and ranked as high\r\nin credit as any.  One needs to read this book before he visits those\r\nvenerable cathedrals, with their treasures of tabooed and forgotten\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\nThey imposed another pirate upon us at Nazareth--another invincible Arab\r\nguard.  We took our last look at the city, clinging like a whitewashed\r\nwasp's nest to the hill-side, and at eight o'clock in the morning\r\ndeparted.  We dismounted and drove the horses down a bridle-path which I\r\nthink was fully as crooked as a corkscrew, which I know to be as steep as\r\nthe downward sweep of a rainbow, and which I believe to be the worst\r\npiece of road in the geography, except one in the Sandwich Islands, which\r\nI remember painfully, and possibly one or two mountain trails in the\r\nSierra Nevadas.  Often, in this narrow path the horse had to poise\r\nhimself nicely on a rude stone step and then drop his fore-feet over the\r\nedge and down something more than half his own height.  This brought his\r\nnose near the ground, while his tail pointed up toward the sky somewhere,\r\nand gave him the appearance of preparing to stand on his head.  A horse\r\ncannot look dignified in this position.  We accomplished the long descent\r\nat last, and trotted across the great Plain of Esdraelon.\r\n\r\nSome of us will be shot before we finish this pilgrimage.  The pilgrims\r\nread \xe2\x80\x9cNomadic Life\xe2\x80\x9d and keep themselves in a constant state of Quixotic\r\nheroism.  They have their hands on their pistols all the time, and every\r\nnow and then, when you least expect it, they snatch them out and take aim\r\nat Bedouins who are not visible, and draw their knives and make savage\r\npasses at other Bedouins who do not exist.  I am in deadly peril always,\r\nfor these spasms are sudden and irregular, and of course I cannot tell\r\nwhen to be getting out of the way.  If I am accidentally murdered, some\r\ntime, during one of these romantic frenzies of the pilgrims, Mr. Grimes\r\nmust be rigidly held to answer as an accessory before the fact.  If the\r\npilgrims would take deliberate aim and shoot at a man, it would be all\r\nright and proper--because that man would not be in any danger; but these\r\nrandom assaults are what I object to.  I do not wish to see any more\r\nplaces like Esdraelon, where the ground is level and people can gallop.\r\nIt puts melodramatic nonsense into the pilgrims' heads.  All at once,\r\nwhen one is jogging along stupidly in the sun, and thinking about\r\nsomething ever so far away, here they come, at a stormy gallop, spurring\r\nand whooping at those ridgy old sore-backed plugs till their heels fly\r\nhigher than their heads, and as they whiz by, out comes a little\r\npotato-gun of a revolver, there is a startling little pop, and a small\r\npellet goes singing through the air.  Now that I have begun this\r\npilgrimage, I intend to go through with it, though sooth to say, nothing\r\nbut the most desperate valor has kept me to my purpose up to the present\r\ntime.  I do not mind Bedouins,--I am not afraid of them; because neither\r\nBedouins nor ordinary Arabs have shown any disposition to harm us, but I\r\ndo feel afraid of my own comrades.\r\n\r\nArriving at the furthest verge of the Plain, we rode a little way up a\r\nhill and found ourselves at Endor, famous for its witch.  Her descendants\r\nare there yet.  They were the wildest horde of half-naked savages we have\r\nfound thus far.  They swarmed out of mud bee-hives; out of hovels of the\r\ndry-goods box pattern; out of gaping caves under shelving rocks; out of\r\ncrevices in the earth.  In five minutes the dead solitude and silence of\r\nthe place were no more, and a begging, screeching, shouting mob were\r\nstruggling about the horses' feet and blocking the way.  \xe2\x80\x9cBucksheesh!\r\nbucksheesh! bucksheesh! howajji, bucksheesh!\xe2\x80\x9d  It was Magdala over\r\nagain, only here the glare from the infidel eyes was fierce and full of\r\nhate.  The population numbers two hundred and fifty, and more than half\r\nthe citizens live in caves in the rock.  Dirt, degradation and savagery\r\nare Endor's specialty.  We say no more about Magdala and Deburieh now.\r\nEndor heads the list.  It is worse than any Indian 'campoodie'.  The hill\r\nis barren, rocky, and forbidding.  No sprig of grass is visible, and only\r\none tree.  This is a fig-tree, which maintains a precarious footing among\r\nthe rocks at the mouth of the dismal cavern once occupied by the\r\nveritable Witch of Endor.  In this cavern, tradition says, Saul, the\r\nking, sat at midnight, and stared and trembled, while the earth shook,\r\nthe thunders crashed among the hills, and out of the midst of fire and\r\nsmoke the spirit of the dead prophet rose up and confronted him.  Saul\r\nhad crept to this place in the darkness, while his army slept, to learn\r\nwhat fate awaited him in the morrow's battle.  He went away a sad man, to\r\nmeet disgrace and death.\r\n\r\nA spring trickles out of the rock in the gloomy recesses of the cavern,\r\nand we were thirsty.  The citizens of Endor objected to our going in\r\nthere.  They do not mind dirt; they do not mind rags; they do not mind\r\nvermin; they do not mind barbarous ignorance and savagery; they do not\r\nmind a reasonable degree of starvation, but they do like to be pure and\r\nholy before their god, whoever he may be, and therefore they shudder and\r\ngrow almost pale at the idea of Christian lips polluting a spring whose\r\nwaters must descend into their sanctified gullets.  We had no wanton\r\ndesire to wound even their feelings or trample upon their prejudices, but\r\nwe were out of water, thus early in the day, and were burning up with\r\nthirst.  It was at this time, and under these circumstances, that I\r\nframed an aphorism which has already become celebrated.  I said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNecessity knows no law.\xe2\x80\x9d  We went in and drank.\r\n\r\nWe got away from the noisy wretches, finally, dropping them in squads and\r\ncouples as we filed over the hills--the aged first, the infants next, the\r\nyoung girls further on; the strong men ran beside us a mile, and only\r\nleft when they had secured the last possible piastre in the way of\r\nbucksheesh.\r\n\r\nIn an hour, we reached Nain, where Christ raised the widow's son to life.\r\nNain is Magdala on a small scale.  It has no population of any\r\nconsequence.  Within a hundred yards of it is the original graveyard, for\r\naught I know; the tombstones lie flat on the ground, which is Jewish\r\nfashion in Syria.  I believe the Moslems do not allow them to have\r\nupright tombstones.  A Moslem grave is usually roughly plastered over and\r\nwhitewashed, and has at one end an upright projection which is shaped\r\ninto exceedingly rude attempts at ornamentation.  In the cities, there is\r\noften no appearance of a grave at all; a tall, slender marble tombstone,\r\nelaborately lettred, gilded and painted, marks the burial place, and this\r\nis surmounted by a turban, so carved and shaped as to signify the dead\r\nman's rank in life.\r\n\r\nThey showed a fragment of ancient wall which they said was one side of\r\nthe gate out of which the widow's dead son was being brought so many\r\ncenturies ago when Jesus met the procession:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cNow when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold there was a\r\n     dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a\r\n     widow: and much people of the city was with her.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said, Weep\r\n     not.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood\r\n     still.  And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, arise.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he that was dead sat up, and began to speak.  And he delivered\r\n     him to his mother.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there came a fear on all.  And they glorified God, saying, That\r\n     a great prophet is risen up among us; and That God hath visited his\r\n     people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little mosque stands upon the spot which tradition says was occupied by\r\nthe widow's dwelling.  Two or three aged Arabs sat about its door.  We\r\nentered, and the pilgrims broke specimens from the foundation walls,\r\nthough they had to touch, and even step, upon the \xe2\x80\x9cpraying carpets\xe2\x80\x9d to do\r\nit.  It was almost the same as breaking pieces from the hearts of those\r\nold Arabs.  To step rudely upon the sacred praying mats, with booted\r\nfeet--a thing not done by any Arab--was to inflict pain upon men who had\r\nnot offended us in any way.  Suppose a party of armed foreigners were to\r\nenter a village church in America and break ornaments from the altar\r\nrailings for curiosities, and climb up and walk upon the Bible and the\r\npulpit cushions?  However, the cases are different.  One is the\r\nprofanation of a temple of our faith--the other only the profanation of a\r\npagan one.\r\n\r\nWe descended to the Plain again, and halted a moment at a well--of\r\nAbraham's time, no doubt.  It was in a desert place.  It was walled three\r\nfeet above ground with squared and heavy blocks of stone, after the\r\nmanner of Bible pictures.  Around it some camels stood, and others knelt.\r\nThere was a group of sober little donkeys with naked, dusky children\r\nclambering about them, or sitting astride their rumps, or pulling their\r\ntails.  Tawny, black-eyed, barefooted maids, arrayed in rags and adorned\r\nwith brazen armlets and pinchbeck ear-rings, were poising water-jars upon\r\ntheir heads, or drawing water from the well.  A flock of sheep stood by,\r\nwaiting for the shepherds to fill the hollowed stones with water, so that\r\nthey might drink--stones which, like those that walled the well, were\r\nworn smooth and deeply creased by the chafing chins of a hundred\r\ngenerations of thirsty animals.  Picturesque Arabs sat upon the ground,\r\nin groups, and solemnly smoked their long-stemmed chibouks.  Other Arabs\r\nwere filling black hog-skins with water--skins which, well filled, and\r\ndistended with water till the short legs projected painfully out of the\r\nproper line, looked like the corpses of hogs bloated by drowning.  Here\r\nwas a grand Oriental picture which I had worshiped a thousand times in\r\nsoft, rich steel engravings!  But in the engraving there was no\r\ndesolation; no dirt; no rags; no fleas; no ugly features; no sore eyes;\r\nno feasting flies; no besotted ignorance in the countenances; no raw\r\nplaces on the donkeys' backs; no disagreeable jabbering in unknown\r\ntongues; no stench of camels; no suggestion that a couple of tons of\r\npowder placed under the party and touched off would heighten the effect\r\nand give to the scene a genuine interest and a charm which it would\r\nalways be pleasant to recall, even though a man lived a thousand years.\r\nOriental scenes look best in steel engravings.  I cannot be imposed upon\r\nany more by that picture of the Queen of Sheba visiting Solomon.  I shall\r\nsay to myself, You look fine, Madam but your feet are not clean and you\r\nsmell like a camel.\r\n\r\nPresently a wild Arab in charge of a camel train recognized an old friend\r\nin Ferguson, and they ran and fell upon each other's necks and kissed\r\neach other's grimy, bearded faces upon both cheeks.  It explained\r\ninstantly a something which had always seemed to me only a farfetched\r\nOriental figure of speech.  I refer to the circumstance of Christ's\r\nrebuking a Pharisee, or some such character, and reminding him that from\r\nhim he had received no \xe2\x80\x9ckiss of welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d  It did not seem reasonable to\r\nme that men should kiss each other, but I am aware, now, that they did.\r\nThere was reason in it, too.  The custom was natural and proper; because\r\npeople must kiss, and a man would not be likely to kiss one of the women\r\nof this country of his own free will and accord.  One must travel, to\r\nlearn.  Every day, now, old Scriptural phrases that never possessed any\r\nsignificance for me before, take to themselves a meaning.\r\n\r\nWe journeyed around the base of the mountain--\xe2\x80\x9cLittle Hermon,\xe2\x80\x9d--past the\r\nold Crusaders' castle of El Fuleh, and arrived at Shunem.  This was\r\nanother Magdala, to a fraction, frescoes and all.  Here, tradition says,\r\nthe prophet Samuel was born, and here the Shunamite woman built a little\r\nhouse upon the city wall for the accommodation of the prophet Elisha.\r\nElisha asked her what she expected in return.  It was a perfectly natural\r\nquestion, for these people are and were in the habit of proffering favors\r\nand services and then expecting and begging for pay.  Elisha knew them\r\nwell.  He could not comprehend that any body should build for him that\r\nhumble little chamber for the mere sake of old friendship, and with no\r\nselfish motive whatever.  It used to seem a very impolite, not to say a\r\nrude, question, for Elisha to ask the woman, but it does not seem so to\r\nme now.  The woman said she expected nothing.  Then for her goodness and\r\nher unselfishness, he rejoiced her heart with the news that she should\r\nbear a son.  It was a high reward--but she would not have thanked him for\r\na daughter--daughters have always been unpopular here.  The son was born,\r\ngrew, waxed strong, died.  Elisha restored him to life in Shunem.\r\n\r\nWe found here a grove of lemon trees--cool, shady, hung with fruit.  One\r\nis apt to overestimate beauty when it is rare, but to me this grove\r\nseemed very beautiful.  It was beautiful.  I do not overestimate it.  I\r\nmust always remember Shunem gratefully, as a place which gave to us this\r\nleafy shelter after our long, hot ride.  We lunched, rested, chatted,\r\nsmoked our pipes an hour, and then mounted and moved on.\r\n\r\nAs we trotted across the Plain of Jezreel, we met half a dozen Digger\r\nIndians (Bedouins) with very long spears in their hands, cavorting around\r\non old crowbait horses, and spearing imaginary enemies; whooping, and\r\nfluttering their rags in the wind, and carrying on in every respect like\r\na pack of hopeless lunatics.  At last, here were the \xe2\x80\x9cwild, free sons of\r\nthe desert, speeding over the plain like the wind, on their beautiful\r\nArabian mares\xe2\x80\x9d we had read so much about and longed so much to see!  Here\r\nwere the \xe2\x80\x9cpicturesque costumes!\xe2\x80\x9d  This was the \xe2\x80\x9cgallant spectacle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Tatterdemalion vagrants--cheap braggadocio--\xe2\x80\x9cArabian mares\xe2\x80\x9d spined and\r\nnecked like the ichthyosaurus in the museum, and humped and cornered like\r\na dromedary!  To glance at the genuine son of the desert is to take the\r\nromance out of him forever--to behold his steed is to long in charity to\r\nstrip his harness off and let him fall to pieces.\r\n\r\nPresently we came to a ruinous old town on a hill, the same being the\r\nancient Jezreel.\r\n\r\nAhab, King of Samaria, (this was a very vast kingdom, for those days, and\r\nwas very nearly half as large as Rhode Island) dwelt in the city of\r\nJezreel, which was his capital.  Near him lived a man by the name of\r\nNaboth, who had a vineyard.  The King asked him for it, and when he would\r\nnot give it, offered to buy it.  But Naboth refused to sell it.  In those\r\ndays it was considered a sort of crime to part with one's inheritance at\r\nany price--and even if a man did part with it, it reverted to himself or\r\nhis heirs again at the next jubilee year.  So this spoiled child of a\r\nKing went and lay down on the bed with his face to the wall, and grieved\r\nsorely.  The Queen, a notorious character in those days, and whose name\r\nis a by-word and a reproach even in these, came in and asked him\r\nwherefore he sorrowed, and he told her.  Jezebel said she could secure\r\nthe vineyard; and she went forth and forged letters to the nobles and\r\nwise men, in the King's name, and ordered them to proclaim a fast and set\r\nNaboth on high before the people, and suborn two witnesses to swear that\r\nhe had blasphemed.  They did it, and the people stoned the accused by the\r\ncity wall, and he died.  Then Jezebel came and told the King, and said,\r\nBehold, Naboth is no more--rise up and seize the vineyard.  So Ahab\r\nseized the vineyard, and went into it to possess it.  But the Prophet\r\nElijah came to him there and read his fate to him, and the fate of\r\nJezebel; and said that in the place where dogs licked the blood of\r\nNaboth, dogs should also lick his blood--and he said, likewise, the dogs\r\nshould eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.  In the course of time, the\r\nKing was killed in battle, and when his chariot wheels were washed in the\r\npool of Samaria, the dogs licked the blood.  In after years, Jehu, who\r\nwas King of Israel, marched down against Jezreel, by order of one of the\r\nProphets, and administered one of those convincing rebukes so common\r\namong the people of those days: he killed many kings and their subjects,\r\nand as he came along he saw Jezebel, painted and finely dressed, looking\r\nout of a window, and ordered that she be thrown down to him.  A servant\r\ndid it, and Jehu's horse trampled her under foot.  Then Jehu went in and\r\nsat down to dinner; and presently he said, Go and bury this cursed woman,\r\nfor she is a King's daughter.  The spirit of charity came upon him too\r\nlate, however, for the prophecy had already been fulfilled--the dogs had\r\neaten her, and they \xe2\x80\x9cfound no more of her than the skull, and the feet,\r\nand the palms of her hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAhab, the late King, had left a helpless family behind him, and Jehu\r\nkilled seventy of the orphan sons.  Then he killed all the relatives, and\r\nteachers, and servants and friends of the family, and rested from his\r\nlabors, until he was come near to Samaria, where he met forty-two persons\r\nand asked them who they were; they said they were brothers of the King of\r\nJudah.  He killed them.  When he got to Samaria, he said he would show\r\nhis zeal for the Lord; so he gathered all the priests and people together\r\nthat worshiped Baal, pretending that he was going to adopt that worship\r\nand offer up a great sacrifice; and when they were all shut up where they\r\ncould not defend themselves, he caused every person of them to be killed.\r\nThen Jehu, the good missionary, rested from his labors once more.\r\n\r\nWe went back to the valley, and rode to the Fountain of Ain Jelud.  They\r\ncall it the Fountain of Jezreel, usually.  It is a pond about one hundred\r\nfeet square and four feet deep, with a stream of water trickling into it\r\nfrom under an overhanging ledge of rocks.  It is in the midst of a great\r\nsolitude.  Here Gideon pitched his camp in the old times; behind Shunem\r\nlay the \xe2\x80\x9cMidianites, the Amalekites, and the Children of the East,\xe2\x80\x9d who\r\nwere \xe2\x80\x9cas grasshoppers for multitude; both they and their camels were\r\nwithout number, as the sand by the sea-side for multitude.\xe2\x80\x9d  Which means\r\nthat there were one hundred and thirty-five thousand men, and that they\r\nhad transportation service accordingly.\r\n\r\nGideon, with only three hundred men, surprised them in the night, and\r\nstood by and looked on while they butchered each other until a hundred\r\nand twenty thousand lay dead on the field.\r\n\r\nWe camped at Jenin before night, and got up and started again at one\r\no'clock in the morning.  Somewhere towards daylight we passed the\r\nlocality where the best authenticated tradition locates the pit into\r\nwhich Joseph's brethren threw him, and about noon, after passing over a\r\nsuccession of mountain tops, clad with groves of fig and olive trees,\r\nwith the Mediterranean in sight some forty miles away, and going by many\r\nancient Biblical cities whose inhabitants glowered savagely upon our\r\nChristian procession, and were seemingly inclined to practice on it with\r\nstones, we came to the singularly terraced and unlovely hills that\r\nbetrayed that we were out of Galilee and into Samaria at last.\r\n\r\nWe climbed a high hill to visit the city of Samaria, where the woman may\r\nhave hailed from who conversed with Christ at Jacob's Well, and from\r\nwhence, no doubt, came also the celebrated Good Samaritan.  Herod the\r\nGreat is said to have made a magnificent city of this place, and a great\r\nnumber of coarse limestone columns, twenty feet high and two feet\r\nthrough, that are almost guiltless of architectural grace of shape and\r\nornament, are pointed out by many authors as evidence of the fact.  They\r\nwould not have been considered handsome in ancient Greece, however.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this camp are particularly vicious, and stoned two\r\nparties of our pilgrims a day or two ago who brought about the difficulty\r\nby showing their revolvers when they did not intend to use them--a thing\r\nwhich is deemed bad judgment in the Far West, and ought certainly to be\r\nso considered any where.  In the new Territories, when a man puts his\r\nhand on a weapon, he knows that he must use it; he must use it instantly\r\nor expect to be shot down where he stands.  Those pilgrims had been\r\nreading Grimes.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for us to do in Samaria but buy handfuls of old Roman\r\ncoins at a franc a dozen, and look at a dilapidated church of the\r\nCrusaders and a vault in it which once contained the body of John the\r\nBaptist.  This relic was long ago carried away to Genoa.\r\n\r\nSamaria stood a disastrous siege, once, in the days of Elisha, at the\r\nhands of the King of Syria.  Provisions reached such a figure that \xe2\x80\x9can\r\nass' head was sold for eighty pieces of silver and the fourth part of a\r\ncab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn incident recorded of that heavy time will give one a very good idea of\r\nthe distress that prevailed within these crumbling walls.  As the King\r\nwas walking upon the battlements one day, \xe2\x80\x9ca woman cried out, saying,\r\nHelp, my lord, O King!  And the King said, What aileth thee?  and she\r\nanswered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him\r\nto-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow.  So we boiled my son, and did\r\neat him; and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son that we may\r\neat him; and she hath hid her son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prophet Elisha declared that within four and twenty hours the prices\r\nof food should go down to nothing, almost, and it was so.  The Syrian\r\narmy broke camp and fled, for some cause or other, the famine was\r\nrelieved from without, and many a shoddy speculator in dove's dung and\r\nass's meat was ruined.\r\n\r\nWe were glad to leave this hot and dusty old village and hurry on.  At\r\ntwo o'clock we stopped to lunch and rest at ancient Shechem, between the\r\nhistoric Mounts of Gerizim and Ebal, where in the old times the books of\r\nthe law, the curses and the blessings, were read from the heights to the\r\nJewish multitudes below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nThe narrow canon in which Nablous, or Shechem, is situated, is under high\r\ncultivation, and the soil is exceedingly black and fertile.  It is well\r\nwatered, and its affluent vegetation gains effect by contrast with the\r\nbarren hills that tower on either side.  One of these hills is the\r\nancient Mount of Blessings and the other the Mount of Curses and wise men\r\nwho seek for fulfillments of prophecy think they find here a wonder of\r\nthis kind--to wit, that the Mount of Blessings is strangely fertile and\r\nits mate as strangely unproductive.  We could not see that there was\r\nreally much difference between them in this respect, however.\r\n\r\nShechem is distinguished as one of the residences of the patriarch Jacob,\r\nand as the seat of those tribes that cut themselves loose from their\r\nbrethren of Israel and propagated doctrines not in conformity with those\r\nof the original Jewish creed.  For thousands of years this clan have\r\ndwelt in Shechem under strict tabu, and having little commerce or\r\nfellowship with their fellow men of any religion or nationality.  For\r\ngenerations they have not numbered more than one or two hundred, but they\r\nstill adhere to their ancient faith and maintain their ancient rites and\r\nceremonies.  Talk of family and old descent!  Princes and nobles pride\r\nthemselves upon lineages they can trace back some hundreds of years.\r\nWhat is this trifle to this handful of old first families of Shechem who\r\ncan name their fathers straight back without a flaw for thousands\r\n--straight back to a period so remote that men reared in a country where\r\nthe days of two hundred years ago are called \xe2\x80\x9cancient\xe2\x80\x9d times grow dazed\r\nand bewildered when they try to comprehend it!  Here is respectability\r\nfor you--here is \xe2\x80\x9cfamily\xe2\x80\x9d--here is high descent worth talking about.\r\nThis sad, proud remnant of a once mighty community still hold themselves\r\naloof from all the world; they still live as their fathers lived, labor\r\nas their fathers labored, think as they did, feel as they did, worship in\r\nthe same place, in sight of the same landmarks, and in the same quaint,\r\npatriarchal way their ancestors did more than thirty centuries ago.  I\r\nfound myself gazing at any straggling scion of this strange race with a\r\nriveted fascination, just as one would stare at a living mastodon, or a\r\nmegatherium that had moved in the grey dawn of creation and seen the\r\nwonders of that mysterious world that was before the flood.\r\n\r\nCarefully preserved among the sacred archives of this curious community\r\nis a MSS.  copy of the ancient Jewish law, which is said to be the oldest\r\ndocument on earth.  It is written on vellum, and is some four or five\r\nthousand years old.  Nothing but bucksheesh can purchase a sight.  Its\r\nfame is somewhat dimmed in these latter days, because of the doubts so\r\nmany authors of Palestine travels have felt themselves privileged to cast\r\nupon it.  Speaking of this MSS. reminds me that I procured from the\r\nhigh-priest of this ancient Samaritan community, at great expense, a\r\nsecret document of still higher antiquity and far more extraordinary\r\ninterest, which I propose to publish as soon as I have finished\r\ntranslating it.\r\n\r\nJoshua gave his dying injunction to the children of Israel at Shechem,\r\nand buried a valuable treasure secretly under an oak tree there about the\r\nsame time.  The superstitious Samaritans have always been afraid to hunt\r\nfor it.  They believe it is guarded by fierce spirits invisible to men.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile and a half from Shechem we halted at the base of Mount Ebal\r\nbefore a little square area, inclosed by a high stone wall, neatly\r\nwhitewashed.  Across one end of this inclosure is a tomb built after the\r\nmanner of the Moslems.  It is the tomb of Joseph.  No truth is better\r\nauthenticated than this.\r\n\r\nWhen Joseph was dying he prophesied that exodus of the Israelites from\r\nEgypt which occurred four hundred years afterwards.  At the same time he\r\nexacted of his people an oath that when they journeyed to the land of\r\nCanaan they would bear his bones with them and bury them in the ancient\r\ninheritance of his fathers.  The oath was kept. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the bones of Joseph,\r\nwhich the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in\r\nShechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor\r\nthe father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFew tombs on earth command the veneration of so many races and men of\r\ndivers creeds as this of Joseph.  \xe2\x80\x9cSamaritan and Jew, Moslem and\r\nChristian alike, revere it, and honor it with their visits.  The tomb of\r\nJoseph, the dutiful son, the affectionate, forgiving brother, the\r\nvirtuous man, the wise Prince and ruler.  Egypt felt his influence--the\r\nworld knows his history.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this same \xe2\x80\x9cparcel of ground\xe2\x80\x9d which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor\r\nfor a hundred pieces of silver, is Jacob's celebrated well.  It is cut in\r\nthe solid rock, and is nine feet square and ninety feet deep.  The name\r\nof this unpretending hole in the ground, which one might pass by and take\r\nno notice of, is as familiar as household words to even the children and\r\nthe peasants of many a far-off country.  It is more famous than the\r\nParthenon; it is older than the Pyramids.\r\n\r\nIt was by this well that Jesus sat and talked with a woman of that\r\nstrange, antiquated Samaritan community I have been speaking of, and told\r\nher of the mysterious water of life.  As descendants of old English\r\nnobles still cherish in the traditions of their houses how that this king\r\nor that king tarried a day with some favored ancestor three hundred years\r\nago, no doubt the descendants of the woman of Samaria, living there in\r\nShechem, still refer with pardonable vanity to this conversation of their\r\nancestor, held some little time gone by, with the Messiah of the\r\nChristians.  It is not likely that they undervalue a distinction such as\r\nthis.  Samaritan nature is human nature, and human nature remembers\r\ncontact with the illustrious, always.\r\n\r\nFor an offense done to the family honor, the sons of Jacob exterminated\r\nall Shechem once.\r\n\r\nWe left Jacob's Well and traveled till eight in the evening, but rather\r\nslowly, for we had been in the saddle nineteen hours, and the horses were\r\ncruelly tired.  We got so far ahead of the tents that we had to camp in\r\nan Arab village, and sleep on the ground.  We could have slept in the\r\nlargest of the houses; but there were some little drawbacks: it was\r\npopulous with vermin, it had a dirt floor, it was in no respect cleanly,\r\nand there was a family of goats in the only bedroom, and two donkeys in\r\nthe parlor.  Outside there were no inconveniences, except that the dusky,\r\nragged, earnest-eyed villagers of both sexes and all ages grouped\r\nthemselves on their haunches all around us, and discussed us and\r\ncriticised us with noisy tongues till midnight.  We did not mind the\r\nnoise, being tired, but, doubtless, the reader is aware that it is almost\r\nan impossible thing to go to sleep when you know that people are looking\r\nat you.  We went to bed at ten, and got up again at two and started once\r\nmore.  Thus are people persecuted by dragomen, whose sole ambition in\r\nlife is to get ahead of each other.\r\n\r\nAbout daylight we passed Shiloh, where the Ark of the Covenant rested\r\nthree hundred years, and at whose gates good old Eli fell down and \xe2\x80\x9cbrake\r\nhis neck\xe2\x80\x9d when the messenger, riding hard from the battle, told him of\r\nthe defeat of his people, the death of his sons, and, more than all, the\r\ncapture of Israel's pride, her hope, her refuge, the ancient Ark her\r\nforefathers brought with them out of Egypt.  It is little wonder that\r\nunder circumstances like these he fell down and brake his neck.  But\r\nShiloh had no charms for us.  We were so cold that there was no comfort\r\nbut in motion, and so drowsy we could hardly sit upon the horses.\r\n\r\nAfter a while we came to a shapeless mass of ruins, which still bears the\r\nname of Bethel.  It was here that Jacob lay down and had that superb\r\nvision of angels flitting up and down a ladder that reached from the\r\nclouds to earth, and caught glimpses of their blessed home through the\r\nopen gates of Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe pilgrims took what was left of the hallowed ruin, and we pressed on\r\ntoward the goal of our crusade, renowned Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThe further we went the hotter the sun got, and the more rocky and bare,\r\nrepulsive and dreary the landscape became.  There could not have been\r\nmore fragments of stone strewn broadcast over this part of the world, if\r\nevery ten square feet of the land had been occupied by a separate and\r\ndistinct stonecutter's establishment for an age.  There was hardly a tree\r\nor a shrub any where.  Even the olive and the cactus, those fast friends\r\nof a worthless soil, had almost deserted the country.  No landscape\r\nexists that is more tiresome to the eye than that which bounds the\r\napproaches to Jerusalem.  The only difference between the roads and the\r\nsurrounding country, perhaps, is that there are rather more rocks in the\r\nroads than in the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nWe passed Ramah, and Beroth, and on the right saw the tomb of the prophet\r\nSamuel, perched high upon a commanding eminence.  Still no Jerusalem came\r\nin sight.  We hurried on impatiently.  We halted a moment at the ancient\r\nFountain of Beira, but its stones, worn deeply by the chins of thirsty\r\nanimals that are dead and gone centuries ago, had no interest for us--we\r\nlonged to see Jerusalem.  We spurred up hill after hill, and usually\r\nbegan to stretch our necks minutes before we got to the top--but\r\ndisappointment always followed:--more stupid hills beyond--more unsightly\r\nlandscape--no Holy City.\r\n\r\nAt last, away in the middle of the day, ancient bite of wall and\r\ncrumbling arches began to line the way--we toiled up one more hill, and\r\nevery pilgrim and every sinner swung his hat on high!  Jerusalem!\r\n\r\nPerched on its eternal hills, white and domed and solid, massed together\r\nand hooped with high gray walls, the venerable city gleamed in the sun.\r\nSo small!  Why, it was no larger than an American village of four\r\nthousand inhabitants, and no larger than an ordinary Syrian city of\r\nthirty thousand.  Jerusalem numbers only fourteen thousand people.\r\n\r\nWe dismounted and looked, without speaking a dozen sentences, across the\r\nwide intervening valley for an hour or more; and noted those prominent\r\nfeatures of the city that pictures make familiar to all men from their\r\nschool days till their death.  We could recognize the Tower of Hippicus,\r\nthe Mosque of Omar, the Damascus Gate, the Mount of Olives, the Valley of\r\nJehoshaphat, the Tower of David, and the Garden of Gethsemane--and dating\r\nfrom these landmarks could tell very nearly the localities of many others\r\nwe were not able to distinguish.\r\n\r\nI record it here as a notable but not discreditable fact that not even\r\nour pilgrims wept.  I think there was no individual in the party whose\r\nbrain was not teeming with thoughts and images and memories invoked by\r\nthe grand history of the venerable city that lay before us, but still\r\namong them all was no \xe2\x80\x9cvoice of them that wept.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no call for tears.  Tears would have been out of place.  The\r\nthoughts Jerusalem suggests are full of poetry, sublimity, and more than\r\nall, dignity.  Such thoughts do not find their appropriate expression in\r\nthe emotions of the nursery.\r\n\r\nJust after noon we entered these narrow, crooked streets, by the ancient\r\nand the famed Damascus Gate, and now for several hours I have been trying\r\nto comprehend that I am actually in the illustrious old city where\r\nSolomon dwelt, where Abraham held converse with the Deity, and where\r\nwalls still stand that witnessed the spectacle of the Crucifixion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nA fast walker could go outside the walls of Jerusalem and walk entirely\r\naround the city in an hour.  I do not know how else to make one\r\nunderstand how small it is.  The appearance of the city is peculiar.  It\r\nis as knobby with countless little domes as a prison door is with\r\nbolt-heads.  Every house has from one to half a dozen of these white\r\nplastered domes of stone, broad and low, sitting in the centre of, or in\r\na cluster upon, the flat roof.  Wherefore, when one looks down from an\r\neminence, upon the compact mass of houses (so closely crowded together,\r\nin fact, that there is no appearance of streets at all, and so the city\r\nlooks solid,) he sees the knobbiest town in the world, except\r\nConstantinople. It looks as if it might be roofed, from centre to\r\ncircumference, with inverted saucers.  The monotony of the view is\r\ninterrupted only by the great Mosque of Omar, the Tower of Hippicus, and\r\none or two other buildings that rise into commanding prominence.\r\n\r\nThe houses are generally two stories high, built strongly of masonry,\r\nwhitewashed or plastered outside, and have a cage of wooden lattice-work\r\nprojecting in front of every window.  To reproduce a Jerusalem street, it\r\nwould only be necessary to up-end a chicken-coop and hang it before each\r\nwindow in an alley of American houses.\r\n\r\nThe streets are roughly and badly paved with stone, and are tolerably\r\ncrooked--enough so to make each street appear to close together\r\nconstantly and come to an end about a hundred yards ahead of a pilgrim as\r\nlong as he chooses to walk in it.  Projecting from the top of the lower\r\nstory of many of the houses is a very narrow porch-roof or shed, without\r\nsupports from below; and I have several times seen cats jump across the\r\nstreet from one shed to the other when they were out calling.  The cats\r\ncould have jumped double the distance without extraordinary exertion.  I\r\nmention these things to give an idea of how narrow the streets are.\r\nSince a cat can jump across them without the least inconvenience, it is\r\nhardly necessary to state that such streets are too narrow for carriages.\r\nThese vehicles cannot navigate the Holy City.\r\n\r\nThe population of Jerusalem is composed of Moslems, Jews, Greeks, Latins,\r\nArmenians, Syrians, Copts, Abyssinians, Greek Catholics, and a handful of\r\nProtestants.  One hundred of the latter sect are all that dwell now in\r\nthis birthplace of Christianity.  The nice shades of nationality\r\ncomprised in the above list, and the languages spoken by them, are\r\naltogether too numerous to mention.  It seems to me that all the races\r\nand colors and tongues of the earth must be represented among the\r\nfourteen thousand souls that dwell in Jerusalem.  Rags, wretchedness,\r\npoverty and dirt, those signs and symbols that indicate the presence of\r\nMoslem rule more surely than the crescent-flag itself, abound.  Lepers,\r\ncripples, the blind, and the idiotic, assail you on every hand, and they\r\nknow but one word of but one language apparently--the eternal\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbucksheesh.\xe2\x80\x9d  To see the numbers of maimed, malformed and diseased\r\nhumanity that throng the holy places and obstruct the gates, one might\r\nsuppose that the ancient days had come again, and that the angel of the\r\nLord was expected to descend at any moment to stir the waters of\r\nBethesda.  Jerusalem is mournful, and dreary, and lifeless.  I would not\r\ndesire to live here.\r\n\r\nOne naturally goes first to the Holy Sepulchre.  It is right in the city,\r\nnear the western gate; it and the place of the Crucifixion, and, in fact,\r\nevery other place intimately connected with that tremendous event, are\r\ningeniously massed together and covered by one roof--the dome of the\r\nChurch of the Holy Sepulchre.\r\n\r\nEntering the building, through the midst of the usual assemblage of\r\nbeggars, one sees on his left a few Turkish guards--for Christians of\r\ndifferent sects will not only quarrel, but fight, also, in this sacred\r\nplace, if allowed to do it.  Before you is a marble slab, which covers\r\nthe Stone of Unction, whereon the Saviour's body was laid to prepare it\r\nfor burial.  It was found necessary to conceal the real stone in this way\r\nin order to save it from destruction.  Pilgrims were too much given to\r\nchipping off pieces of it to carry home.  Near by is a circular railing\r\nwhich marks the spot where the Virgin stood when the Lord's body was\r\nanointed.\r\n\r\nEntering the great Rotunda, we stand before the most sacred locality in\r\nChristendom--the grave of Jesus.  It is in the centre of the church, and\r\nimmediately under the great dome.  It is inclosed in a sort of little\r\ntemple of yellow and white stone, of fanciful design.  Within the little\r\ntemple is a portion of the very stone which was rolled away from the door\r\nof the Sepulchre, and on which the angel was sitting when Mary came\r\nthither \xe2\x80\x9cat early dawn.\xe2\x80\x9d  Stooping low, we enter the vault--the Sepulchre\r\nitself.  It is only about six feet by seven, and the stone couch on which\r\nthe dead Saviour lay extends from end to end of the apartment and\r\noccupies half its width.  It is covered with a marble slab which has been\r\nmuch worn by the lips of pilgrims.  This slab serves as an altar, now.\r\nOver it hang some fifty gold and silver lamps, which are kept always\r\nburning, and the place is otherwise scandalized by trumpery, gewgaws, and\r\ntawdry ornamentation.\r\n\r\nAll sects of Christians (except Protestants,) have chapels under the roof\r\nof the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and each must keep to itself and not\r\nventure upon another's ground.  It has been proven conclusively that they\r\ncan not worship together around the grave of the Saviour of the World in\r\npeace.  The chapel of the Syrians is not handsome; that of the Copts is\r\nthe humblest of them all.  It is nothing but a dismal cavern, roughly\r\nhewn in the living rock of the Hill of Calvary.  In one side of it two\r\nancient tombs are hewn, which are claimed to be those in which Nicodemus\r\nand Joseph of Aramathea were buried.\r\n\r\nAs we moved among the great piers and pillars of another part of the\r\nchurch, we came upon a party of black-robed, animal-looking Italian\r\nmonks, with candles in their hands, who were chanting something in Latin,\r\nand going through some kind of religious performance around a disk of\r\nwhite marble let into the floor.  It was there that the risen Saviour\r\nappeared to Mary Magdalen in the likeness of a gardener.  Near by was a\r\nsimilar stone, shaped like a star--here the Magdalen herself stood, at\r\nthe same time.  Monks were performing in this place also.  They perform\r\neverywhere--all over the vast building, and at all hours.  Their candles\r\nare always flitting about in the gloom, and making the dim old church\r\nmore dismal than there is any necessity that it should be, even though it\r\nis a tomb.\r\n\r\nWe were shown the place where our Lord appeared to His mother after the\r\nResurrection.  Here, also, a marble slab marks the place where St.\r\nHelena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine, found the crosses about\r\nthree hundred years after the Crucifixion.  According to the legend, this\r\ngreat discovery elicited extravagant demonstrations of joy.  But they\r\nwere of short duration.  The question intruded itself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhich bore the\r\nblessed Saviour, and which the thieves?\xe2\x80\x9d  To be in doubt, in so mighty a\r\nmatter as this--to be uncertain which one to adore--was a grievous\r\nmisfortune.  It turned the public joy to sorrow.  But when lived there a\r\nholy priest who could not set so simple a trouble as this at rest?  One\r\nof these soon hit upon a plan that would be a certain test.  A noble lady\r\nlay very ill in Jerusalem.  The wise priests ordered that the three\r\ncrosses be taken to her bedside one at a time.  It was done.  When her\r\neyes fell upon the first one, she uttered a scream that was heard beyond\r\nthe Damascus Gate, and even upon the Mount of Olives, it was said, and\r\nthen fell back in a deadly swoon.  They recovered her and brought the\r\nsecond cross.  Instantly she went into fearful convulsions, and it was\r\nwith the greatest difficulty that six strong men could hold her.  They\r\nwere afraid, now, to bring in the third cross.  They began to fear that\r\npossibly they had fallen upon the wrong crosses, and that the true cross\r\nwas not with this number at all.  However, as the woman seemed likely to\r\ndie with the convulsions that were tearing her, they concluded that the\r\nthird could do no more than put her out of her misery with a happy\r\ndispatch.  So they brought it, and behold, a miracle!  The woman sprang\r\nfrom her bed, smiling and joyful, and perfectly restored to health.  When\r\nwe listen to evidence like this, we cannot but believe.  We would be\r\nashamed to doubt, and properly, too.  Even the very part of Jerusalem\r\nwhere this all occurred is there yet.  So there is really no room for\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nThe priests tried to show us, through a small screen, a fragment of the\r\ngenuine Pillar of Flagellation, to which Christ was bound when they\r\nscourged him.  But we could not see it, because it was dark inside the\r\nscreen.  However, a baton is kept here, which the pilgrim thrusts through\r\na hole in the screen, and then he no longer doubts that the true Pillar\r\nof Flagellation is in there.  He can not have any excuse to doubt it, for\r\nhe can feel it with the stick.  He can feel it as distinctly as he could\r\nfeel any thing.\r\n\r\nNot far from here was a niche where they used to preserve a piece of the\r\nTrue Cross, but it is gone, now.  This piece of the cross was discovered\r\nin the sixteenth century.  The Latin priests say it was stolen away, long\r\nago, by priests of another sect.  That seems like a hard statement to\r\nmake, but we know very well that it was stolen, because we have seen it\r\nourselves in several of the cathedrals of Italy and France.\r\n\r\nBut the relic that touched us most was the plain old sword of that stout\r\nCrusader, Godfrey of Bulloigne--King Godfrey of Jerusalem.  No blade in\r\nChristendom wields such enchantment as this--no blade of all that rust in\r\nthe ancestral halls of Europe is able to invoke such visions of romance\r\nin the brain of him who looks upon it--none that can prate of such\r\nchivalric deeds or tell such brave tales of the warrior days of old.  It\r\nstirs within a man every memory of the Holy Wars that has been sleeping\r\nin his brain for years, and peoples his thoughts with mail-clad images,\r\nwith marching armies, with battles and with sieges.  It speaks to him of\r\nBaldwin, and Tancred, the princely Saladin, and great Richard of the Lion\r\nHeart.  It was with just such blades as these that these splendid heroes\r\nof romance used to segregate a man, so to speak, and leave the half of\r\nhim to fall one way and the other half the other.  This very sword has\r\ncloven hundreds of Saracen Knights from crown to chin in those old times\r\nwhen Godfrey wielded it.  It was enchanted, then, by a genius that was\r\nunder the command of King Solomon.  When danger approached its master's\r\ntent it always struck the shield and clanged out a fierce alarm upon the\r\nstartled ear of night.  In times of doubt, or in fog or darkness, if it\r\nwere drawn from its sheath it would point instantly toward the foe, and\r\nthus reveal the way--and it would also attempt to start after them of its\r\nown accord.  A Christian could not be so disguised that it would not know\r\nhim and refuse to hurt him--nor a Moslem so disguised that it would not\r\nleap from its scabbard and take his life.  These statements are all well\r\nauthenticated in many legends that are among the most trustworthy legends\r\nthe good old Catholic monks preserve.  I can never forget old Godfrey's\r\nsword, now.  I tried it on a Moslem, and clove him in twain like a\r\ndoughnut.  The spirit of Grimes was upon me, and if I had had a graveyard\r\nI would have destroyed all the infidels in Jerusalem.  I wiped the blood\r\noff the old sword and handed it back to the priest--I did not want the\r\nfresh gore to obliterate those sacred spots that crimsoned its brightness\r\none day six hundred years ago and thus gave Godfrey warning that before\r\nthe sun went down his journey of life would end.\r\n\r\nStill moving through the gloom of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre we\r\ncame to a small chapel, hewn out of the rock--a place which has been\r\nknown as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Prison of Our Lord\xe2\x80\x9d for many centuries.  Tradition says\r\nthat here the Saviour was confined just previously to the crucifixion.\r\nUnder an altar by the door was a pair of stone stocks for human legs.\r\nThese things are called the \xe2\x80\x9cBonds of Christ,\xe2\x80\x9d and the use they were once\r\nput to has given them the name they now bear.\r\n\r\nThe Greek Chapel is the most roomy, the richest and the showiest chapel\r\nin the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.  Its altar, like that of all the\r\nGreek churches, is a lofty screen that extends clear across the chapel,\r\nand is gorgeous with gilding and pictures.  The numerous lamps that hang\r\nbefore it are of gold and silver, and cost great sums.\r\n\r\nBut the feature of the place is a short column that rises from the middle\r\nof the marble pavement of the chapel, and marks the exact centre of the\r\nearth.  The most reliable traditions tell us that this was known to be\r\nthe earth's centre, ages ago, and that when Christ was upon earth he set\r\nall doubts upon the subject at rest forever, by stating with his own lips\r\nthat the tradition was correct.  Remember, He said that that particular\r\ncolumn stood upon the centre of the world.  If the centre of the world\r\nchanges, the column changes its position accordingly.  This column has\r\nmoved three different times of its own accord.  This is because, in great\r\nconvulsions of nature, at three different times, masses of the earth\r\n--whole ranges of mountains, probably--have flown off into space, thus\r\nlessening the diameter of the earth, and changing the exact locality of\r\nits centre by a point or two.  This is a very curious and interesting\r\ncircumstance, and is a withering rebuke to those philosophers who would\r\nmake us believe that it is not possible for any portion of the earth to\r\nfly off into space.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy himself that this spot was really the centre of the earth, a\r\nsceptic once paid well for the privilege of ascending to the dome of the\r\nchurch to see if the sun gave him a shadow at noon.  He came down\r\nperfectly convinced.  The day was very cloudy and the sun threw no\r\nshadows at all; but the man was satisfied that if the sun had come out\r\nand made shadows it could not have made any for him.  Proofs like these\r\nare not to be set aside by the idle tongues of cavilers.  To such as are\r\nnot bigoted, and are willing to be convinced, they carry a conviction\r\nthat nothing can ever shake.\r\n\r\nIf even greater proofs than those I have mentioned are wanted, to satisfy\r\nthe headstrong and the foolish that this is the genuine centre of the\r\nearth, they are here.  The greatest of them lies in the fact that from\r\nunder this very column was taken the dust from which Adam was made.  This\r\ncan surely be regarded in the light of a settler.  It is not likely that\r\nthe original first man would have been made from an inferior quality of\r\nearth when it was entirely convenient to get first quality from the\r\nworld's centre.  This will strike any reflecting mind forcibly.  That\r\nAdam was formed of dirt procured in this very spot is amply proven by the\r\nfact that in six thousand years no man has ever been able to prove that\r\nthe dirt was not procured here whereof he was made.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular circumstance that right under the roof of this same\r\ngreat church, and not far away from that illustrious column, Adam\r\nhimself, the father of the human race, lies buried.  There is no question\r\nthat he is actually buried in the grave which is pointed out as his\r\n--there can be none--because it has never yet been proven that that grave\r\nis not the grave in which he is buried.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of Adam!  How touching it was, here in a land of strangers, far\r\naway from home, and friends, and all who cared for me, thus to discover\r\nthe grave of a blood relation.  True, a distant one, but still a\r\nrelation.  The unerring instinct of nature thrilled its recognition.  The\r\nfountain of my filial affection was stirred to its profoundest depths,\r\nand I gave way to tumultuous emotion.  I leaned upon a pillar and burst\r\ninto tears.  I deem it no shame to have wept over the grave of my poor\r\ndead relative.  Let him who would sneer at my emotion close this volume\r\nhere, for he will find little to his taste in my journeyings through Holy\r\nLand.  Noble old man--he did not live to see me--he did not live to see\r\nhis child.  And I--I--alas, I did not live to see him.  Weighed down by\r\nsorrow and disappointment, he died before I was born--six thousand brief\r\nsummers before I was born.  But let us try to bear it with fortitude.\r\nLet us trust that he is better off where he is.  Let us take comfort in\r\nthe thought that his loss is our eternal gain.\r\n\r\nThe next place the guide took us to in the holy church was an altar\r\ndedicated to the Roman soldier who was of the military guard that\r\nattended at the Crucifixion to keep order, and who--when the vail of the\r\nTemple was rent in the awful darkness that followed; when the rock of\r\nGolgotha was split asunder by an earthquake; when the artillery of heaven\r\nthundered, and in the baleful glare of the lightnings the shrouded dead\r\nflitted about the streets of Jerusalem--shook with fear and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSurely\r\nthis was the Son of God!\xe2\x80\x9d  Where this altar stands now, that Roman\r\nsoldier stood then, in full view of the crucified Saviour--in full sight\r\nand hearing of all the marvels that were transpiring far and wide about\r\nthe circumference of the Hill of Calvary.  And in this self-same spot the\r\npriests of the Temple beheaded him for those blasphemous words he had\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\nIn this altar they used to keep one of the most curious relics that human\r\neyes ever looked upon--a thing that had power to fascinate the beholder\r\nin some mysterious way and keep him gazing for hours together.  It was\r\nnothing less than the copper plate Pilate put upon the Saviour's cross,\r\nand upon which he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cTHIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.\xe2\x80\x9d  I think St.\r\nHelena, the mother of Constantine, found this wonderful memento when she\r\nwas here in the third century.  She traveled all over Palestine, and was\r\nalways fortunate.  Whenever the good old enthusiast found a thing\r\nmentioned in her Bible, Old or New, she would go and search for that\r\nthing, and never stop until she found it.  If it was Adam, she would find\r\nAdam; if it was the Ark, she would find the Ark; if it was Goliath, or\r\nJoshua, she would find them.  She found the inscription here that I was\r\nspeaking of, I think.  She found it in this very spot, close to where the\r\nmartyred Roman soldier stood.  That copper plate is in one of the\r\nchurches in Rome, now.  Any one can see it there.  The inscription is\r\nvery distinct.\r\n\r\nWe passed along a few steps and saw the altar built over the very spot\r\nwhere the good Catholic priests say the soldiers divided the raiment of\r\nthe Saviour.\r\n\r\nThen we went down into a cavern which cavilers say was once a cistern.\r\nIt is a chapel, now, however--the Chapel of St. Helena.  It is fifty-one\r\nfeet long by forty-three wide.  In it is a marble chair which Helena used\r\nto sit in while she superintended her workmen when they were digging and\r\ndelving for the True Cross.  In this place is an altar dedicated to St.\r\nDimas, the penitent thief.  A new bronze statue is here--a statue of St.\r\nHelena.  It reminded us of poor Maximilian, so lately shot.  He presented\r\nit to this chapel when he was about to leave for his throne in Mexico.\r\n\r\nFrom the cistern we descended twelve steps into a large roughly-shaped\r\ngrotto, carved wholly out of the living rock.  Helena blasted it out when\r\nshe was searching for the true Cross.  She had a laborious piece of work,\r\nhere, but it was richly rewarded.  Out of this place she got the crown of\r\nthorns, the nails of the cross, the true Cross itself, and the cross of\r\nthe penitent thief.  When she thought she had found every thing and was\r\nabout to stop, she was told in a dream to continue a day longer.  It was\r\nvery fortunate.  She did so, and found the cross of the other thief.\r\n\r\nThe walls and roof of this grotto still weep bitter tears in memory of\r\nthe event that transpired on Calvary, and devout pilgrims groan and sob\r\nwhen these sad tears fall upon them from the dripping rock.  The monks\r\ncall this apartment the \xe2\x80\x9cChapel of the Invention of the Cross\xe2\x80\x9d--a name\r\nwhich is unfortunate, because it leads the ignorant to imagine that a\r\ntacit acknowledgment is thus made that the tradition that Helena found\r\nthe true Cross here is a fiction--an invention.  It is a happiness to\r\nknow, however, that intelligent people do not doubt the story in any of\r\nits particulars.\r\n\r\nPriests of any of the chapels and denominations in the Church of the Holy\r\nSepulchre can visit this sacred grotto to weep and pray and worship the\r\ngentle Redeemer.  Two different congregations are not allowed to enter at\r\nthe same time, however, because they always fight.\r\n\r\nStill marching through the venerable Church of the Holy Sepulchre, among\r\nchanting priests in coarse long robes and sandals; pilgrims of all colors\r\nand many nationalities, in all sorts of strange costumes; under dusky\r\narches and by dingy piers and columns; through a sombre cathedral gloom\r\nfreighted with smoke and incense, and faintly starred with scores of\r\ncandles that appeared suddenly and as suddenly disappeared, or drifted\r\nmysteriously hither and thither about the distant aisles like ghostly\r\njack-o'-lanterns--we came at last to a small chapel which is called the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChapel of the Mocking.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under the altar was a fragment of a marble\r\ncolumn; this was the seat Christ sat on when he was reviled, and\r\nmockingly made King, crowned with a crown of thorns and sceptred with a\r\nreed.  It was here that they blindfolded him and struck him, and said in\r\nderision, \xe2\x80\x9cProphesy who it is that smote thee.\xe2\x80\x9d  The tradition that this\r\nis the identical spot of the mocking is a very ancient one.  The guide\r\nsaid that Saewulf was the first to mention it.  I do not know Saewulf,\r\nbut still, I cannot well refuse to receive his evidence--none of us can.\r\n\r\nThey showed us where the great Godfrey and his brother Baldwin, the first\r\nChristian Kings of Jerusalem, once lay buried by that sacred sepulchre\r\nthey had fought so long and so valiantly to wrest from the hands of the\r\ninfidel.  But the niches that had contained the ashes of these renowned\r\ncrusaders were empty.  Even the coverings of their tombs were gone\r\n--destroyed by devout members of the Greek Church, because Godfrey and\r\nBaldwin were Latin princes, and had been reared in a Christian faith\r\nwhose creed differed in some unimportant respects from theirs.\r\n\r\nWe passed on, and halted before the tomb of Melchisedek!  You will\r\nremember Melchisedek, no doubt; he was the King who came out and levied a\r\ntribute on Abraham the time that he pursued Lot's captors to Dan, and\r\ntook all their property from them.  That was about four thousand years\r\nago, and Melchisedek died shortly afterward.  However, his tomb is in a\r\ngood state of preservation.\r\n\r\nWhen one enters the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Sepulchre itself is\r\nthe first thing he desires to see, and really is almost the first thing\r\nhe does see.  The next thing he has a strong yearning to see is the spot\r\nwhere the Saviour was crucified.  But this they exhibit last.  It is the\r\ncrowning glory of the place.  One is grave and thoughtful when he stands\r\nin the little Tomb of the Saviour--he could not well be otherwise in such\r\na place--but he has not the slightest possible belief that ever the Lord\r\nlay there, and so the interest he feels in the spot is very, very greatly\r\nmarred by that reflection.  He looks at the place where Mary stood, in\r\nanother part of the church, and where John stood, and Mary Magdalen;\r\nwhere the mob derided the Lord; where the angel sat; where the crown of\r\nthorns was found, and the true Cross; where the risen Saviour appeared\r\n--he looks at all these places with interest, but with the same conviction\r\nhe felt in the case of the Sepulchre, that there is nothing genuine about\r\nthem, and that they are imaginary holy places created by the monks.  But\r\nthe place of the Crucifixion affects him differently.  He fully believes\r\nthat he is looking upon the very spot where the Savior gave up his\r\nlife.  He remembers that Christ was very celebrated, long before he came\r\nto Jerusalem; he knows that his fame was so great that crowds followed\r\nhim all the time; he is aware that his entry into the city produced a\r\nstirring sensation, and that his reception was a kind of ovation; he can\r\nnot overlook the fact that when he was crucified there were very many in\r\nJerusalem who believed that he was the true Son of God.  To publicly\r\nexecute such a personage was sufficient in itself to make the locality of\r\nthe execution a memorable place for ages; added to this, the storm, the\r\ndarkness, the earthquake, the rending of the vail of the Temple, and the\r\nuntimely waking of the dead, were events calculated to fix the execution\r\nand the scene of it in the memory of even the most thoughtless witness.\r\nFathers would tell their sons about the strange affair, and point out the\r\nspot; the sons would transmit the story to their children, and thus a\r\nperiod of three hundred years would easily be spanned--[The thought is\r\nMr. Prime's, not mine, and is full of good sense.  I borrowed it from his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTent Life.\xe2\x80\x9d--M.  T.]--at which time Helena came and built a church upon\r\nCalvary to commemorate the death and burial of the Lord and preserve the\r\nsacred place in the memories of men; since that time there has always\r\nbeen a church there.  It is not possible that there can be any mistake\r\nabout the locality of the Crucifixion.  Not half a dozen persons knew\r\nwhere they buried the Saviour, perhaps, and a burial is not a startling\r\nevent, any how; therefore, we can be pardoned for unbelief in the\r\nSepulchre, but not in the place of the Crucifixion.  Five hundred years\r\nhence there will be no vestige of Bunker Hill Monument left, but America\r\nwill still know where the battle was fought and where Warren fell.  The\r\ncrucifixion of Christ was too notable an event in Jerusalem, and the Hill\r\nof Calvary made too celebrated by it, to be forgotten in the short space\r\nof three hundred years.  I climbed the stairway in the church which\r\nbrings one to the top of the small inclosed pinnacle of rock, and looked\r\nupon the place where the true cross once stood, with a far more absorbing\r\ninterest than I had ever felt in any thing earthly before.  I could not\r\nbelieve that the three holes in the top of the rock were the actual ones\r\nthe crosses stood in, but I felt satisfied that those crosses had stood\r\nso near the place now occupied by them, that the few feet of possible\r\ndifference were a matter of no consequence.\r\n\r\nWhen one stands where the Saviour was crucified, he finds it all he can\r\ndo to keep it strictly before his mind that Christ was not crucified in a\r\nCatholic Church.  He must remind himself every now and then that the\r\ngreat event transpired in the open air, and not in a gloomy,\r\ncandle-lighted cell in a little corner of a vast church, up-stairs\r\n--a small cell all bejeweled and bespangled with flashy ornamentation,\r\nin execrable taste.\r\n\r\nUnder a marble altar like a table, is a circular hole in the marble\r\nfloor, corresponding with the one just under it in which the true Cross\r\nstood.  The first thing every one does is to kneel down and take a candle\r\nand examine this hole.  He does this strange prospecting with an amount\r\nof gravity that can never be estimated or appreciated by a man who has\r\nnot seen the operation.  Then he holds his candle before a richly\r\nengraved picture of the Saviour, done on a messy slab of gold, and\r\nwonderfully rayed and starred with diamonds, which hangs above the hole\r\nwithin the altar, and his solemnity changes to lively admiration.  He\r\nrises and faces the finely wrought figures of the Saviour and the\r\nmalefactors uplifted upon their crosses behind the altar, and bright with\r\na metallic lustre of many colors.  He turns next to the figures close to\r\nthem of the Virgin and Mary Magdalen; next to the rift in the living rock\r\nmade by the earthquake at the time of the Crucifixion, and an extension\r\nof which he had seen before in the wall of one of the grottoes below; he\r\nlooks next at the show-case with a figure of the Virgin in it, and is\r\namazed at the princely fortune in precious gems and jewelry that hangs so\r\nthickly about the form as to hide it like a garment almost.  All about\r\nthe apartment the gaudy trappings of the Greek Church offend the eye and\r\nkeep the mind on the rack to remember that this is the Place of the\r\nCrucifixion--Golgotha--the Mount of Calvary.  And the last thing he looks\r\nat is that which was also the first--the place where the true Cross\r\nstood.  That will chain him to the spot and compel him to look once more,\r\nand once again, after he has satisfied all curiosity and lost all\r\ninterest concerning the other matters pertaining to the locality.\r\n\r\nAnd so I close my chapter on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre--the most\r\nsacred locality on earth to millions and millions of men, and women, and\r\nchildren, the noble and the humble, bond and free.  In its history from\r\nthe first, and in its tremendous associations, it is the most illustrious\r\nedifice in Christendom.  With all its clap-trap side-shows and unseemly\r\nimpostures of every kind, it is still grand, revered, venerable--for a\r\ngod died there; for fifteen hundred years its shrines have been wet with\r\nthe tears of pilgrims from the earth's remotest confines; for more than\r\ntwo hundred, the most gallant knights that ever wielded sword wasted\r\ntheir lives away in a struggle to seize it and hold it sacred from\r\ninfidel pollution.  Even in our own day a war, that cost millions of\r\ntreasure and rivers of blood, was fought because two rival nations\r\nclaimed the sole right to put a new dome upon it.  History is full of\r\nthis old Church of the Holy Sepulchre--full of blood that was shed\r\nbecause of the respect and the veneration in which men held the last\r\nresting-place of the meek and lowly, the mild and gentle, Prince of\r\nPeace!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nWe were standing in a narrow street, by the Tower of Antonio.  \xe2\x80\x9cOn these\r\nstones that are crumbling away,\xe2\x80\x9d the guide said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Saviour sat and\r\nrested before taking up the cross.  This is the beginning of the\r\nSorrowful Way, or the Way of Grief.\xe2\x80\x9d  The party took note of the sacred\r\nspot, and moved on.  We passed under the \xe2\x80\x9cEcce Homo Arch,\xe2\x80\x9d and saw the\r\nvery window from which Pilate's wife warned her husband to have nothing\r\nto do with the persecution of the Just Man.  This window is in an\r\nexcellent state of preservation, considering its great age.  They showed\r\nus where Jesus rested the second time, and where the mob refused to give\r\nhim up, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet his blood be upon our heads, and upon our\r\nchildren's children forever.\xe2\x80\x9d  The French Catholics are building a church\r\non this spot, and with their usual veneration for historical relics, are\r\nincorporating into the new such scraps of ancient walls as they have\r\nfound there.  Further on, we saw the spot where the fainting Saviour fell\r\nunder the weight of his cross.  A great granite column of some ancient\r\ntemple lay there at the time, and the heavy cross struck it such a blow\r\nthat it broke in two in the middle.  Such was the guide's story when he\r\nhalted us before the broken column.\r\n\r\nWe crossed a street, and came presently to the former residence of St.\r\nVeronica.  When the Saviour passed there, she came out, full of womanly\r\ncompassion, and spoke pitying words to him, undaunted by the hootings and\r\nthe threatenings of the mob, and wiped the perspiration from his face\r\nwith her handkerchief.  We had heard so much of St. Veronica, and seen\r\nher picture by so many masters, that it was like meeting an old friend\r\nunexpectedly to come upon her ancient home in Jerusalem.  The strangest\r\nthing about the incident that has made her name so famous, is, that when\r\nshe wiped the perspiration away, the print of the Saviour's face remained\r\nupon the handkerchief, a perfect portrait, and so remains unto this day.\r\nWe knew this, because we saw this handkerchief in a cathedral in Paris,\r\nin another in Spain, and in two others in Italy.  In the Milan cathedral\r\nit costs five francs to see it, and at St. Peter's, at Rome, it is almost\r\nimpossible to see it at any price.  No tradition is so amply verified as\r\nthis of St. Veronica and her handkerchief.\r\n\r\nAt the next corner we saw a deep indention in the hard stone masonry of\r\nthe corner of a house, but might have gone heedlessly by it but that the\r\nguide said it was made by the elbow of the Saviour, who stumbled here and\r\nfell.  Presently we came to just such another indention in a stone wall.\r\nThe guide said the Saviour fell here, also, and made this depression with\r\nhis elbow.\r\n\r\nThere were other places where the Lord fell, and others where he rested;\r\nbut one of the most curious landmarks of ancient history we found on this\r\nmorning walk through the crooked lanes that lead toward Calvary, was a\r\ncertain stone built into a house--a stone that was so seamed and scarred\r\nthat it bore a sort of grotesque resemblance to the human face.  The\r\nprojections that answered for cheeks were worn smooth by the passionate\r\nkisses of generations of pilgrims from distant lands.  We asked \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The guide said it was because this was one of \xe2\x80\x9cthe very stones of\r\nJerusalem\xe2\x80\x9d that Christ mentioned when he was reproved for permitting the\r\npeople to cry \xe2\x80\x9cHosannah!\xe2\x80\x9d  when he made his memorable entry into the\r\ncity upon an ass.  One of the pilgrims said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut there is no evidence\r\nthat the stones did cry out--Christ said that if the people stopped from\r\nshouting Hosannah, the very stones would do it.\xe2\x80\x9d  The guide was perfectly\r\nserene.  He said, calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is one of the stones that would have\r\ncried out.\xe2\x80\x9d It was of little use to try to shake this fellow's simple\r\nfaith--it was easy to see that.\r\n\r\nAnd so we came at last to another wonder, of deep and abiding interest\r\n--the veritable house where the unhappy wretch once lived who has been\r\ncelebrated in song and story for more than eighteen hundred years as the\r\nWandering Jew.  On the memorable day of the Crucifixion he stood in this\r\nold doorway with his arms akimbo, looking out upon the struggling mob\r\nthat was approaching, and when the weary Saviour would have sat down and\r\nrested him a moment, pushed him rudely away and said, \xe2\x80\x9cMove on!\xe2\x80\x9d  The\r\nLord said, \xe2\x80\x9cMove on, thou, likewise,\xe2\x80\x9d and the command has never been\r\nrevoked from that day to this.  All men know how that the miscreant upon\r\nwhose head that just curse fell has roamed up and down the wide world,\r\nfor ages and ages, seeking rest and never finding it--courting death but\r\nalways in vain--longing to stop, in city, in wilderness, in desert\r\nsolitudes, yet hearing always that relentless warning to march--march on!\r\nThey say--do these hoary traditions--that when Titus sacked Jerusalem and\r\nslaughtered eleven hundred thousand Jews in her streets and by-ways, the\r\nWandering Jew was seen always in the thickest of the fight, and that when\r\nbattle-axes gleamed in the air, he bowed his head beneath them; when\r\nswords flashed their deadly lightnings, he sprang in their way; he bared\r\nhis breast to whizzing javelins, to hissing arrows, to any and to every\r\nweapon that promised death and forgetfulness, and rest.  But it was\r\nuseless--he walked forth out of the carnage without a wound.  And it is\r\nsaid that five hundred years afterward he followed Mahomet when he\r\ncarried destruction to the cities of Arabia, and then turned against him,\r\nhoping in this way to win the death of a traitor.  His calculations were\r\nwrong again.  No quarter was given to any living creature but one, and\r\nthat was the only one of all the host that did not want it.  He sought\r\ndeath five hundred years later, in the wars of the Crusades, and offered\r\nhimself to famine and pestilence at Ascalon.  He escaped again--he could\r\nnot die.  These repeated annoyances could have at last but one effect\r\n--they shook his confidence.  Since then the Wandering Jew has carried on a\r\nkind of desultory toying with the most promising of the aids and\r\nimplements of destruction, but with small hope, as a general thing.  He\r\nhas speculated some in cholera and railroads, and has taken almost a\r\nlively interest in infernal machines and patent medicines.  He is old,\r\nnow, and grave, as becomes an age like his; he indulges in no light\r\namusements save that he goes sometimes to executions, and is fond of\r\nfunerals.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing he can not avoid; go where he will about the world, he\r\nmust never fail to report in Jerusalem every fiftieth year.  Only a year\r\nor two ago he was here for the thirty-seventh time since Jesus was\r\ncrucified on Calvary.  They say that many old people, who are here now,\r\nsaw him then, and had seen him before.  He looks always the same--old,\r\nand withered, and hollow-eyed, and listless, save that there is about him\r\nsomething which seems to suggest that he is looking for some one,\r\nexpecting some one--the friends of his youth, perhaps.  But the most of\r\nthem are dead, now.  He always pokes about the old streets looking\r\nlonesome, making his mark on a wall here and there, and eyeing the oldest\r\nbuildings with a sort of friendly half interest; and he sheds a few tears\r\nat the threshold of his ancient dwelling, and bitter, bitter tears they\r\nare.  Then he collects his rent and leaves again.  He has been seen\r\nstanding near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on many a starlight night,\r\nfor he has cherished an idea for many centuries that if he could only\r\nenter there, he could rest.  But when he approaches, the doors slam to\r\nwith a crash, the earth trembles, and all the lights in Jerusalem burn a\r\nghastly blue!  He does this every fifty years, just the same.  It is\r\nhopeless, but then it is hard to break habits one has been eighteen\r\nhundred years accustomed to.  The old tourist is far away on his\r\nwanderings, now.  How he must smile to see a pack of blockheads like us,\r\ngalloping about the world, and looking wise, and imagining we are finding\r\nout a good deal about it!  He must have a consuming contempt for the\r\nignorant, complacent asses that go skurrying about the world in these\r\nrailroading days and call it traveling.\r\n\r\nWhen the guide pointed out where the Wandering Jew had left his familiar\r\nmark upon a wall, I was filled with astonishment.  It read:\r\n\r\n                         \xe2\x80\x9cS. T.--1860--X.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll I have revealed about the Wandering Jew can be amply proven by\r\nreference to our guide.\r\n\r\nThe mighty Mosque of Omar, and the paved court around it, occupy a fourth\r\npart of Jerusalem.  They are upon Mount Moriah, where King Solomon's\r\nTemple stood.  This Mosque is the holiest place the Mohammedan knows,\r\noutside of Mecca.  Up to within a year or two past, no Christian could\r\ngain admission to it or its court for love or money.  But the prohibition\r\nhas been removed, and we entered freely for bucksheesh.\r\n\r\nI need not speak of the wonderful beauty and the exquisite grace and\r\nsymmetry that have made this Mosque so celebrated--because I did not see\r\nthem.  One can not see such things at an instant glance--one frequently\r\nonly finds out how really beautiful a really beautiful woman is after\r\nconsiderable acquaintance with her; and the rule applies to Niagara\r\nFalls, to majestic mountains and to mosques--especially to mosques.\r\n\r\nThe great feature of the Mosque of Omar is the prodigious rock in the\r\ncentre of its rotunda.  It was upon this rock that Abraham came so near\r\noffering up his son Isaac--this, at least, is authentic--it is very much\r\nmore to be relied on than most of the traditions, at any rate.  On this\r\nrock, also, the angel stood and threatened Jerusalem, and David persuaded\r\nhim to spare the city.  Mahomet was well acquainted with this stone.\r\nFrom it he ascended to heaven.  The stone tried to follow him, and if the\r\nangel Gabriel had not happened by the merest good luck to be there to\r\nseize it, it would have done it.  Very few people have a grip like\r\nGabriel--the prints of his monstrous fingers, two inches deep, are to be\r\nseen in that rock to-day.\r\n\r\nThis rock, large as it is, is suspended in the air.  It does not touch\r\nany thing at all.  The guide said so.  This is very wonderful.  In the\r\nplace on it where Mahomet stood, he left his foot-prints in the solid\r\nstone.  I should judge that he wore about eighteens.  But what I was\r\ngoing to say, when I spoke of the rock being suspended, was, that in the\r\nfloor of the cavern under it they showed us a slab which they said\r\ncovered a hole which was a thing of extraordinary interest to all\r\nMohammedans, because that hole leads down to perdition, and every soul\r\nthat is transferred from thence to Heaven must pass up through this\r\norifice.  Mahomet stands there and lifts them out by the hair.  All\r\nMohammedans shave their heads, but they are careful to leave a lock of\r\nhair for the Prophet to take hold of.  Our guide observed that a good\r\nMohammedan would consider himself doomed to stay with the damned forever\r\nif he were to lose his scalp-lock and die before it grew again.  The most\r\nof them that I have seen ought to stay with the damned, any how, without\r\nreference to how they were barbered.\r\n\r\nFor several ages no woman has been allowed to enter the cavern where that\r\nimportant hole is.  The reason is that one of the sex was once caught\r\nthere blabbing every thing she knew about what was going on above ground,\r\nto the rapscallions in the infernal regions down below.  She carried her\r\ngossiping to such an extreme that nothing could be kept private--nothing\r\ncould be done or said on earth but every body in perdition knew all about\r\nit before the sun went down.  It was about time to suppress this woman's\r\ntelegraph, and it was promptly done.  Her breath subsided about the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the great mosque is very showy with variegated marble walls\r\nand with windows and inscriptions of elaborate mosaic.  The Turks have\r\ntheir sacred relics, like the Catholics.  The guide showed us the\r\nveritable armor worn by the great son-in-law and successor of Mahomet,\r\nand also the buckler of Mahomet's uncle.  The great iron railing which\r\nsurrounds the rock was ornamented in one place with a thousand rags tied\r\nto its open work.  These are to remind Mahomet not to forget the\r\nworshipers who placed them there.  It is considered the next best thing\r\nto tying threads around his finger by way of reminders.\r\n\r\nJust outside the mosque is a miniature temple, which marks the spot where\r\nDavid and Goliah used to sit and judge the people.--[A pilgrim informs\r\nme that it was not David and Goliah, but David and Saul.  I stick to my\r\nown statement--the guide told me, and he ought to know.]\r\n\r\nEvery where about the Mosque of Omar are portions of pillars, curiously\r\nwrought altars, and fragments of elegantly carved marble--precious\r\nremains of Solomon's Temple.  These have been dug from all depths in the\r\nsoil and rubbish of Mount Moriah, and the Moslems have always shown a\r\ndisposition to preserve them with the utmost care.  At that portion of\r\nthe ancient wall of Solomon's Temple which is called the Jew's Place of\r\nWailing, and where the Hebrews assemble every Friday to kiss the\r\nvenerated stones and weep over the fallen greatness of Zion, any one can\r\nsee a part of the unquestioned and undisputed Temple of Solomon, the same\r\nconsisting of three or four stones lying one upon the other, each of\r\nwhich is about twice as long as a seven-octave piano, and about as thick\r\nas such a piano is high.  But, as I have remarked before, it is only a\r\nyear or two ago that the ancient edict prohibiting Christian rubbish like\r\nourselves to enter the Mosque of Omar and see the costly marbles that\r\nonce adorned the inner Temple was annulled.  The designs wrought upon\r\nthese fragments are all quaint and peculiar, and so the charm of novelty\r\nis added to the deep interest they naturally inspire.  One meets with\r\nthese venerable scraps at every turn, especially in the neighboring\r\nMosque el Aksa, into whose inner walls a very large number of them are\r\ncarefully built for preservation.  These pieces of stone, stained and\r\ndusty with age, dimly hint at a grandeur we have all been taught to\r\nregard as the princeliest ever seen on earth; and they call up pictures\r\nof a pageant that is familiar to all imaginations--camels laden with\r\nspices and treasure--beautiful slaves, presents for Solomon's harem--a\r\nlong cavalcade of richly caparisoned beasts and warriors--and Sheba's\r\nQueen in the van of this vision of \xe2\x80\x9cOriental magnificence.\xe2\x80\x9d  These\r\nelegant fragments bear a richer interest than the solemn vastness of the\r\nstones the Jews kiss in the Place of Wailing can ever have for the\r\nheedless sinner.\r\n\r\nDown in the hollow ground, underneath the olives and the orange-trees\r\nthat flourish in the court of the great Mosque, is a wilderness of\r\npillars--remains of the ancient Temple; they supported it.  There are\r\nponderous archways down there, also, over which the destroying \xe2\x80\x9cplough\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n of prophecy passed harmless.  It is pleasant to know we are disappointed,\r\nin that we never dreamed we might see portions of the actual Temple of\r\nSolomon, and yet experience no shadow of suspicion that they were a\r\nmonkish humbug and a fraud.\r\n\r\nWe are surfeited with sights.  Nothing has any fascination for us, now,\r\nbut the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.  We have been there every day, and\r\nhave not grown tired of it; but we are weary of every thing else.  The\r\nsights are too many.  They swarm about you at every step; no single foot\r\nof ground in all Jerusalem or within its neighborhood seems to be without\r\na stirring and important history of its own.  It is a very relief to\r\nsteal a walk of a hundred yards without a guide along to talk unceasingly\r\nabout every stone you step upon and drag you back ages and ages to the\r\nday when it achieved celebrity.\r\n\r\nIt seems hardly real when I find myself leaning for a moment on a ruined\r\nwall and looking listlessly down into the historic pool of Bethesda.  I\r\ndid not think such things could be so crowded together as to diminish\r\ntheir interest.  But in serious truth, we have been drifting about, for\r\nseveral days, using our eyes and our ears more from a sense of duty than\r\nany higher and worthier reason.  And too often we have been glad when it\r\nwas time to go home and be distressed no more about illustrious\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nOur pilgrims compress too much into one day.  One can gorge sights to\r\nrepletion as well as sweetmeats.  Since we breakfasted, this morning, we\r\nhave seen enough to have furnished us food for a year's reflection if we\r\ncould have seen the various objects in comfort and looked upon them\r\ndeliberately.  We visited the pool of Hezekiah, where David saw Uriah's\r\nwife coming from the bath and fell in love with her.\r\n\r\nWe went out of the city by the Jaffa gate, and of course were told many\r\nthings about its Tower of Hippicus.\r\n\r\nWe rode across the Valley of Hinnom, between two of the Pools of Gihon,\r\nand by an aqueduct built by Solomon, which still conveys water to the\r\ncity.  We ascended the Hill of Evil Counsel, where Judas received his\r\nthirty pieces of silver, and we also lingered a moment under the tree a\r\nvenerable tradition says he hanged himself on.\r\n\r\nWe descended to the canon again, and then the guide began to give name\r\nand history to every bank and boulder we came to: \xe2\x80\x9cThis was the Field of\r\nBlood; these cuttings in the rocks were shrines and temples of Moloch;\r\nhere they sacrificed children; yonder is the Zion Gate; the Tyropean\r\nValley, the Hill of Ophel; here is the junction of the Valley of\r\nJehoshaphat--on your right is the Well of Job.\xe2\x80\x9d  We turned up\r\nJehoshaphat.  The recital went on.  \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the Mount of Olives; this is\r\nthe Hill of Offense; the nest of huts is the Village of Siloam; here,\r\nyonder, every where, is the King's Garden; under this great tree\r\nZacharias, the high priest, was murdered; yonder is Mount Moriah and the\r\nTemple wall; the tomb of Absalom; the tomb of St. James; the tomb of\r\nZacharias; beyond, are the Garden of Gethsemane and the tomb of the\r\nVirgin Mary; here is the Pool of Siloam, and----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe said we would dismount, and quench our thirst, and rest.  We were\r\nburning up with the heat.  We were failing under the accumulated fatigue\r\nof days and days of ceaseless marching.  All were willing.\r\n\r\nThe Pool is a deep, walled ditch, through which a clear stream of water\r\nruns, that comes from under Jerusalem somewhere, and passing through the\r\nFountain of the Virgin, or being supplied from it, reaches this place by\r\nway of a tunnel of heavy masonry.  The famous pool looked exactly as it\r\nlooked in Solomon's time, no doubt, and the same dusky, Oriental women,\r\ncame down in their old Oriental way, and carried off jars of the water on\r\ntheir heads, just as they did three thousand years ago, and just as they\r\nwill do fifty thousand years hence if any of them are still left on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nWe went away from there and stopped at the Fountain of the Virgin.  But\r\nthe water was not good, and there was no comfort or peace any where, on\r\naccount of the regiment of boys and girls and beggars that persecuted us\r\nall the time for bucksheesh.  The guide wanted us to give them some\r\nmoney, and we did it; but when he went on to say that they were starving\r\nto death we could not but feel that we had done a great sin in throwing\r\nobstacles in the way of such a desirable consummation, and so we tried to\r\ncollect it back, but it could not be done.\r\n\r\nWe entered the Garden of Gethsemane, and we visited the Tomb of the\r\nVirgin, both of which we had seen before.  It is not meet that I should\r\nspeak of them now.  A more fitting time will come.\r\n\r\nI can not speak now of the Mount of Olives or its view of Jerusalem, the\r\nDead Sea and the mountains of Moab; nor of the Damascus Gate or the tree\r\nthat was planted by King Godfrey of Jerusalem.  One ought to feel\r\npleasantly when he talks of these things.  I can not say any thing about\r\nthe stone column that projects over Jehoshaphat from the Temple wall like\r\na cannon, except that the Moslems believe Mahomet will sit astride of it\r\nwhen he comes to judge the world.  It is a pity he could not judge it\r\nfrom some roost of his own in Mecca, without trespassing on our holy\r\nground.  Close by is the Golden Gate, in the Temple wall--a gate that was\r\nan elegant piece of sculpture in the time of the Temple, and is even so\r\nyet.  From it, in ancient times, the Jewish High Priest turned loose the\r\nscapegoat and let him flee to the wilderness and bear away his\r\ntwelve-month load of the sins of the people.  If they were to turn one\r\nloose now, he would not get as far as the Garden of Gethsemane, till\r\nthese miserable vagabonds here would gobble him up,--[Favorite pilgrim\r\nexpression.]--sins and all.  They wouldn't care.  Mutton-chops and sin\r\nis good enough living for them.  The Moslems watch the Golden Gate with\r\na jealous eye, and an anxious one, for they have an honored tradition\r\nthat when it falls, Islamism will fall and with it the Ottoman Empire.\r\nIt did not grieve me any to notice that the old gate was getting a\r\nlittle shaky.\r\n\r\nWe are at home again.  We are exhausted.  The sun has roasted us, almost.\r\nWe have full comfort in one reflection, however.  Our experiences in\r\nEurope have taught us that in time this fatigue will be forgotten; the\r\nheat will be forgotten; the thirst, the tiresome volubility of the guide,\r\nthe persecutions of the beggars--and then, all that will be left will be\r\npleasant memories of Jerusalem, memories we shall call up with always\r\nincreasing interest as the years go by, memories which some day will\r\nbecome all beautiful when the last annoyance that incumbers them shall\r\nhave faded out of our minds never again to return.  School-boy days are\r\nno happier than the days of after life, but we look back upon them\r\nregretfully because we have forgotten our punishments at school, and how\r\nwe grieved when our marbles were lost and our kites destroyed--because we\r\nhave forgotten all the sorrows and privations of that canonized epoch and\r\nremember only its orchard robberies, its wooden sword pageants and its\r\nfishing holydays.  We are satisfied.  We can wait.  Our reward will come.\r\nTo us, Jerusalem and to-day's experiences will be an enchanted memory a\r\nyear hence--memory which money could not buy from us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nWe cast up the account.  It footed up pretty fairly.  There was nothing\r\nmore at Jerusalem to be seen, except the traditional houses of Dives and\r\nLazarus of the parable, the Tombs of the Kings, and those of the Judges;\r\nthe spot where they stoned one of the disciples to death, and beheaded\r\nanother; the room and the table made celebrated by the Last Supper; the\r\nfig-tree that Jesus withered; a number of historical places about\r\nGethsemane and the Mount of Olives, and fifteen or twenty others in\r\ndifferent portions of the city itself.\r\n\r\nWe were approaching the end.  Human nature asserted itself, now.\r\nOverwork and consequent exhaustion began to have their natural effect.\r\nThey began to master the energies and dull the ardor of the party.\r\nPerfectly secure now, against failing to accomplish any detail of the\r\npilgrimage, they felt like drawing in advance upon the holiday soon to be\r\nplaced to their credit.  They grew a little lazy.  They were late to\r\nbreakfast and sat long at dinner.  Thirty or forty pilgrims had arrived\r\nfrom the ship, by the short routes, and much swapping of gossip had to be\r\nindulged in.  And in hot afternoons, they showed a strong disposition to\r\nlie on the cool divans in the hotel and smoke and talk about pleasant\r\nexperiences of a month or so gone by--for even thus early do episodes of\r\ntravel which were sometimes annoying, sometimes exasperating and full as\r\noften of no consequence at all when they transpired, begin to rise above\r\nthe dead level of monotonous reminiscences and become shapely landmarks\r\nin one's memory.  The fog-whistle, smothered among a million of trifling\r\nsounds, is not noticed a block away, in the city, but the sailor hears it\r\nfar at sea, whither none of those thousands of trifling sounds can reach.\r\nWhen one is in Rome, all the domes are alike; but when he has gone away\r\ntwelve miles, the city fades utterly from sight and leaves St. Peter's\r\nswelling above the level plain like an anchored balloon.  When one is\r\ntraveling in Europe, the daily incidents seem all alike; but when he has\r\nplaced them all two months and two thousand miles behind him, those that\r\nwere worthy of being remembered are prominent, and those that were really\r\ninsignificant have vanished.  This disposition to smoke, and idle and\r\ntalk, was not well.  It was plain that it must not be allowed to gain\r\nground.  A diversion must be tried, or demoralization would ensue.  The\r\nJordan, Jericho and the Dead Sea were suggested.  The remainder of\r\nJerusalem must be left unvisited, for a little while.  The journey was\r\napproved at once.  New life stirred in every pulse.  In the saddle\r\n--abroad on the plains--sleeping in beds bounded only by the horizon: fancy\r\nwas at work with these things in a moment.--It was painful to note how\r\nreadily these town-bred men had taken to the free life of the camp and\r\nthe desert The nomadic instinct is a human instinct; it was born with\r\nAdam and transmitted through the patriarchs, and after thirty centuries\r\nof steady effort, civilization has not educated it entirely out of us\r\nyet.  It has a charm which, once tasted, a man will yearn to taste again.\r\nThe nomadic instinct can not be educated out of an Indian at all.\r\n\r\nThe Jordan journey being approved, our dragoman was notified.\r\n\r\nAt nine in the morning the caravan was before the hotel door and we were\r\nat breakfast.  There was a commotion about the place.  Rumors of war and\r\nbloodshed were flying every where.  The lawless Bedouins in the Valley of\r\nthe Jordan and the deserts down by the Dead Sea were up in arms, and were\r\ngoing to destroy all comers.  They had had a battle with a troop of\r\nTurkish cavalry and defeated them; several men killed.  They had shut up\r\nthe inhabitants of a village and a Turkish garrison in an old fort near\r\nJericho, and were besieging them.  They had marched upon a camp of our\r\nexcursionists by the Jordan, and the pilgrims only saved their lives by\r\nstealing away and flying to Jerusalem under whip and spur in the darkness\r\nof the night.  Another of our parties had been fired on from an ambush\r\nand then attacked in the open day.  Shots were fired on both sides.\r\nFortunately there was no bloodshed.  We spoke with the very pilgrim who\r\nhad fired one of the shots, and learned from his own lips how, in this\r\nimminent deadly peril, only the cool courage of the pilgrims, their\r\nstrength of numbers and imposing display of war material, had saved them\r\nfrom utter destruction.  It was reported that the Consul had requested\r\nthat no more of our pilgrims should go to the Jordan while this state of\r\nthings lasted; and further, that he was unwilling that any more should\r\ngo, at least without an unusually strong military guard.  Here was\r\ntrouble.  But with the horses at the door and every body aware of what\r\nthey were there for, what would you have done?  Acknowledged that you\r\nwere afraid, and backed shamefully out?  Hardly.  It would not be human\r\nnature, where there were so many women.  You would have done as we did:\r\nsaid you were not afraid of a million Bedouins--and made your will and\r\nproposed quietly to yourself to take up an unostentatious position in the\r\nrear of the procession.\r\n\r\nI think we must all have determined upon the same line of tactics, for it\r\ndid seem as if we never would get to Jericho.  I had a notoriously slow\r\nhorse, but somehow I could not keep him in the rear, to save my neck.\r\nHe was forever turning up in the lead.  In such cases I trembled a\r\nlittle, and got down to fix my saddle.  But it was not of any use.  The\r\nothers all got down to fix their saddles, too.  I never saw such a time\r\nwith saddles.  It was the first time any of them had got out of order in\r\nthree weeks, and now they had all broken down at once.  I tried walking,\r\nfor exercise--I had not had enough in Jerusalem searching for holy\r\nplaces.  But it was a failure.  The whole mob were suffering for\r\nexercise, and it was not fifteen minutes till they were all on foot and I\r\nhad the lead again.  It was very discouraging.\r\n\r\nThis was all after we got beyond Bethany.  We stopped at the village of\r\nBethany, an hour out from Jerusalem.  They showed us the tomb of Lazarus.\r\nI had rather live in it than in any house in the town.  And they showed\r\nus also a large \xe2\x80\x9cFountain of Lazarus,\xe2\x80\x9d and in the centre of the village\r\nthe ancient dwelling of Lazarus.  Lazarus appears to have been a man of\r\nproperty.  The legends of the Sunday Schools do him great injustice; they\r\ngive one the impression that he was poor.  It is because they get him\r\nconfused with that Lazarus who had no merit but his virtue, and virtue\r\nnever has been as respectable as money.  The house of Lazarus is a\r\nthree-story edifice, of stone masonry, but the accumulated rubbish of\r\nages has buried all of it but the upper story.  We took candles and\r\ndescended to the dismal cell-like chambers where Jesus sat at meat with\r\nMartha and Mary, and conversed with them about their brother.  We could\r\nnot but look upon these old dingy apartments with a more than common\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nWe had had a glimpse, from a mountain top, of the Dead Sea, lying like a\r\nblue shield in the plain of the Jordan, and now we were marching down a\r\nclose, flaming, rugged, desolate defile, where no living creature could\r\nenjoy life, except, perhaps, a salamander.  It was such a dreary,\r\nrepulsive, horrible solitude!  It was the \xe2\x80\x9cwilderness\xe2\x80\x9d where John\r\npreached, with camel's hair about his loins--raiment enough--but he never\r\ncould have got his locusts and wild honey here.  We were moping along\r\ndown through this dreadful place, every man in the rear.  Our guards--two\r\ngorgeous young Arab sheiks, with cargoes of swords, guns, pistols and\r\ndaggers on board--were loafing ahead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBedouins!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery man shrunk up and disappeared in his clothes like a mud-turtle.\r\nMy first impulse was to dash forward and destroy the Bedouins.  My second\r\nwas to dash to the rear to see if there were any coming in that\r\ndirection.  I acted on the latter impulse.  So did all the others.  If\r\nany Bedouins had approached us, then, from that point of the compass,\r\nthey would have paid dearly for their rashness.  We all remarked that,\r\nafterwards.  There would have been scenes of riot and bloodshed there\r\nthat no pen could describe.  I know that, because each man told what he\r\nwould have done, individually; and such a medley of strange and\r\nunheard-of inventions of cruelty you could not conceive of.  One man\r\nsaid he had calmly made up his mind to perish where he stood, if need\r\nbe, but never yield an inch; he was going to wait, with deadly patience,\r\ntill he could count the stripes upon the first Bedouin's jacket, and\r\nthen count them and let him have it.  Another was going to sit still\r\ntill the first lance reached within an inch of his breast, and then\r\ndodge it and seize it.  I forbear to tell what he was going to do to\r\nthat Bedouin that owned it. It makes my blood run cold to think of it.\r\nAnother was going to scalp such Bedouins as fell to his share, and take\r\nhis bald-headed sons of the desert home with him alive for trophies.\r\nBut the wild-eyed pilgrim rhapsodist was silent.  His orbs gleamed with\r\na deadly light, but his lips moved not.  Anxiety grew, and he was\r\nquestioned.  If he had got a Bedouin, what would he have done with him\r\n--shot him?  He smiled a smile of grim contempt and shook his head.\r\nWould he have stabbed him?  Another shake.  Would he have quartered him\r\n--flayed him?  More shakes.  Oh! horror what would he have done?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEat him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was the awful sentence that thundered from his lips.  What was\r\ngrammar to a desperado like that?  I was glad in my heart that I had been\r\nspared these scenes of malignant carnage.  No Bedouins attacked our\r\nterrible rear.  And none attacked the front.  The new-comers were only a\r\nreinforcement of cadaverous Arabs, in shirts and bare legs, sent far\r\nahead of us to brandish rusty guns, and shout and brag, and carry on like\r\nlunatics, and thus scare away all bands of marauding Bedouins that might\r\nlurk about our path.  What a shame it is that armed white Christians must\r\ntravel under guard of vermin like this as a protection against the\r\nprowling vagabonds of the desert--those sanguinary outlaws who are always\r\ngoing to do something desperate, but never do it.  I may as well mention\r\nhere that on our whole trip we saw no Bedouins, and had no more use for\r\nan Arab guard than we could have had for patent leather boots and white\r\nkid gloves.  The Bedouins that attacked the other parties of pilgrims so\r\nfiercely were provided for the occasion by the Arab guards of those\r\nparties, and shipped from Jerusalem for temporary service as Bedouins.\r\nThey met together in full view of the pilgrims, after the battle, and\r\ntook lunch, divided the bucksheesh extorted in the season of danger, and\r\nthen accompanied the cavalcade home to the city!  The nuisance of an Arab\r\nguard is one which is created by the Sheiks and the Bedouins together,\r\nfor mutual profit, it is said, and no doubt there is a good deal of truth\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nWe visited the fountain the prophet Elisha sweetened (it is sweet yet,)\r\nwhere he remained some time and was fed by the ravens.\r\n\r\nAncient Jericho is not very picturesque as a ruin.  When Joshua marched\r\naround it seven times, some three thousand years ago, and blew it down\r\nwith his trumpet, he did the work so well and so completely that he\r\nhardly left enough of the city to cast a shadow.  The curse pronounced\r\nagainst the rebuilding of it, has never been removed.  One King, holding\r\nthe curse in light estimation, made the attempt, but was stricken sorely\r\nfor his presumption.  Its site will always remain unoccupied; and yet it\r\nis one of the very best locations for a town we have seen in all\r\nPalestine.\r\n\r\nAt two in the morning they routed us out of bed--another piece of\r\nunwarranted cruelty--another stupid effort of our dragoman to get ahead\r\nof a rival.  It was not two hours to the Jordan.  However, we were\r\ndressed and under way before any one thought of looking to see what time\r\nit was, and so we drowsed on through the chill night air and dreamed of\r\ncamp fires, warm beds, and other comfortable things.\r\n\r\nThere was no conversation.  People do not talk when they are cold, and\r\nwretched, and sleepy.  We nodded in the saddle, at times, and woke up\r\nwith a start to find that the procession had disappeared in the gloom.\r\nThen there was energy and attention to business until its dusky outlines\r\ncame in sight again.  Occasionally the order was passed in a low voice\r\ndown the line: \xe2\x80\x9cClose up--close up!  Bedouins lurk here, every where!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n What an exquisite shudder it sent shivering along one's spine!\r\n\r\nWe reached the famous river before four o'clock, and the night was so\r\nblack that we could have ridden into it without seeing it.  Some of us\r\nwere in an unhappy frame of mind.  We waited and waited for daylight, but\r\nit did not come.  Finally we went away in the dark and slept an hour on\r\nthe ground, in the bushes, and caught cold.  It was a costly nap, on that\r\naccount, but otherwise it was a paying investment because it brought\r\nunconsciousness of the dreary minutes and put us in a somewhat fitter\r\nmood for a first glimpse of the sacred river.\r\n\r\nWith the first suspicion of dawn, every pilgrim took off his clothes and\r\nwaded into the dark torrent, singing:\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cOn Jordan's stormy banks I stand,\r\n               And cast a wistful eye\r\n               To Canaan's fair and happy land,\r\n               Where my possessions lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut they did not sing long.  The water was so fearfully cold that they\r\nwere obliged to stop singing and scamper out again.  Then they stood on\r\nthe bank shivering, and so chagrined and so grieved, that they merited\r\nholiest compassion.  Because another dream, another cherished hope, had\r\nfailed.  They had promised themselves all along that they would cross the\r\nJordan where the Israelites crossed it when they entered Canaan from\r\ntheir long pilgrimage in the desert.  They would cross where the twelve\r\nstones were placed in memory of that great event.  While they did it they\r\nwould picture to themselves that vast army of pilgrims marching through\r\nthe cloven waters, bearing the hallowed ark of the covenant and shouting\r\nhosannahs, and singing songs of thanksgiving and praise.  Each had\r\npromised himself that he would be the first to cross.  They were at the\r\ngoal of their hopes at last, but the current was too swift, the water was\r\ntoo cold!\r\n\r\nIt was then that Jack did them a service.  With that engaging\r\nrecklessness of consequences which is natural to youth, and so proper and\r\nso seemly, as well, he went and led the way across the Jordan, and all\r\nwas happiness again.  Every individual waded over, then, and stood upon\r\nthe further bank.  The water was not quite breast deep, any where.  If it\r\nhad been more, we could hardly have accomplished the feat, for the strong\r\ncurrent would have swept us down the stream, and we would have been\r\nexhausted and drowned before reaching a place where we could make a\r\nlanding.  The main object compassed, the drooping, miserable party sat\r\ndown to wait for the sun again, for all wanted to see the water as well\r\nas feel it.  But it was too cold a pastime.  Some cans were filled from\r\nthe holy river, some canes cut from its banks, and then we mounted and\r\nrode reluctantly away to keep from freezing to death.  So we saw the\r\nJordan very dimly.  The thickets of bushes that bordered its banks threw\r\ntheir shadows across its shallow, turbulent waters (\xe2\x80\x9cstormy,\xe2\x80\x9d the hymn\r\nmakes them, which is rather a complimentary stretch of fancy,) and we\r\ncould not judge of the width of the stream by the eye.  We knew by our\r\nwading experience, however, that many streets in America are double as\r\nwide as the Jordan.\r\n\r\nDaylight came, soon after we got under way, and in the course of an hour\r\nor two we reached the Dead Sea.  Nothing grows in the flat, burning\r\ndesert around it but weeds and the Dead Sea apple the poets say is\r\nbeautiful to the eye, but crumbles to ashes and dust when you break it.\r\nSuch as we found were not handsome, but they were bitter to the taste.\r\nThey yielded no dust.  It was because they were not ripe, perhaps.\r\n\r\nThe desert and the barren hills gleam painfully in the sun, around the\r\nDead Sea, and there is no pleasant thing or living creature upon it or\r\nabout its borders to cheer the eye.  It is a scorching, arid, repulsive\r\nsolitude.  A silence broods over the scene that is depressing to the\r\nspirits.  It makes one think of funerals and death.\r\n\r\nThe Dead Sea is small.  Its waters are very clear, and it has a pebbly\r\nbottom and is shallow for some distance out from the shores.  It yields\r\nquantities of asphaltum; fragments of it lie all about its banks; this\r\nstuff gives the place something of an unpleasant smell.\r\n\r\nAll our reading had taught us to expect that the first plunge into the\r\nDead Sea would be attended with distressing results--our bodies would\r\nfeel as if they were suddenly pierced by millions of red-hot needles; the\r\ndreadful smarting would continue for hours; we might even look to be\r\nblistered from head to foot, and suffer miserably for many days.  We were\r\ndisappointed.  Our eight sprang in at the same time that another party of\r\npilgrims did, and nobody screamed once.  None of them ever did complain\r\nof any thing more than a slight pricking sensation in places where their\r\nskin was abraded, and then only for a short time.  My face smarted for a\r\ncouple of hours, but it was partly because I got it badly sun-burned\r\nwhile I was bathing, and staid in so long that it became plastered over\r\nwith salt.\r\n\r\nNo, the water did not blister us; it did not cover us with a slimy ooze\r\nand confer upon us an atrocious fragrance; it was not very slimy; and I\r\ncould not discover that we smelt really any worse than we have always\r\nsmelt since we have been in Palestine.  It was only a different kind of\r\nsmell, but not conspicuous on that account, because we have a great deal\r\nof variety in that respect.  We didn't smell, there on the Jordan, the\r\nsame as we do in Jerusalem; and we don't smell in Jerusalem just as we\r\ndid in Nazareth, or Tiberias, or Cesarea Philippi, or any of those other\r\nruinous ancient towns in Galilee.  No, we change all the time, and\r\ngenerally for the worse.  We do our own washing.\r\n\r\nIt was a funny bath.  We could not sink.  One could stretch himself at\r\nfull length on his back, with his arms on his breast, and all of his body\r\nabove a line drawn from the corner of his jaw past the middle of his\r\nside, the middle of his leg and through his ancle bone, would remain out\r\nof water.  He could lift his head clear out, if he chose.  No position\r\ncan be retained long; you lose your balance and whirl over, first on your\r\nback and then on your face, and so on.  You can lie comfortably, on your\r\nback, with your head out, and your legs out from your knees down, by\r\nsteadying yourself with your hands.  You can sit, with your knees drawn\r\nup to your chin and your arms clasped around them, but you are bound to\r\nturn over presently, because you are top-heavy in that position.  You can\r\nstand up straight in water that is over your head, and from the middle of\r\nyour breast upward you will not be wet.  But you can not remain so.  The\r\nwater will soon float your feet to the surface.  You can not swim on your\r\nback and make any progress of any consequence, because your feet stick\r\naway above the surface, and there is nothing to propel yourself with but\r\nyour heels.  If you swim on your face, you kick up the water like a\r\nstern-wheel boat.  You make no headway.  A horse is so top-heavy that he\r\ncan neither swim nor stand up in the Dead Sea.  He turns over on his side\r\nat once.  Some of us bathed for more than an hour, and then came out\r\ncoated with salt till we shone like icicles.  We scrubbed it off with a\r\ncoarse towel and rode off with a splendid brand-new smell, though it was\r\none which was not any more disagreeable than those we have been for\r\nseveral weeks enjoying.  It was the variegated villainy and novelty of it\r\nthat charmed us.  Salt crystals glitter in the sun about the shores of\r\nthe lake.  In places they coat the ground like a brilliant crust of ice.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy I somehow got the impression that the river Jordan was\r\nfour thousand miles long and thirty-five miles wide.  It is only ninety\r\nmiles long, and so crooked that a man does not know which side of it he\r\nis on half the time.  In going ninety miles it does not get over more\r\nthan fifty miles of ground.  It is not any wider than Broadway in New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nThere is the Sea of Galilee and this Dead Sea--neither of them twenty\r\nmiles long or thirteen wide.  And yet when I was in Sunday School I\r\nthought they were sixty thousand miles in diameter.\r\n\r\nTravel and experience mar the grandest pictures and rob us of the most\r\ncherished traditions of our boyhood.  Well, let them go.  I have already\r\nseen the Empire of King Solomon diminish to the size of the State of\r\nPennsylvania; I suppose I can bear the reduction of the seas and the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nWe looked every where, as we passed along, but never saw grain or crystal\r\nof Lot's wife.  It was a great disappointment.  For many and many a year\r\nwe had known her sad story, and taken that interest in her which\r\nmisfortune always inspires.  But she was gone.  Her picturesque form no\r\nlonger looms above the desert of the Dead Sea to remind the tourist of\r\nthe doom that fell upon the lost cities.\r\n\r\nI can not describe the hideous afternoon's ride from the Dead Sea to Mars\r\nSaba.  It oppresses me yet, to think of it.  The sun so pelted us that\r\nthe tears ran down our cheeks once or twice.  The ghastly, treeless,\r\ngrassless, breathless canons smothered us as if we had been in an oven.\r\nThe sun had positive weight to it, I think.  Not a man could sit erect\r\nunder it.  All drooped low in the saddles.  John preached in this\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilderness!\xe2\x80\x9d  It must have been exhausting work.  What a very heaven the\r\nmessy towers and ramparts of vast Mars Saba looked to us when we caught a\r\nfirst glimpse of them!\r\n\r\nWe staid at this great convent all night, guests of the hospitable\r\npriests.  Mars Saba, perched upon a crag, a human nest stuck high up\r\nagainst a perpendicular mountain wall, is a world of grand masonry that\r\nrises, terrace upon terrace away above your head, like the terraced and\r\nretreating colonnades one sees in fanciful pictures of Belshazzar's Feast\r\nand the palaces of the ancient Pharaohs.  No other human dwelling is\r\nnear.  It was founded many ages ago by a holy recluse who lived at first\r\nin a cave in the rock--a cave which is inclosed in the convent walls,\r\nnow, and was reverently shown to us by the priests.  This recluse, by his\r\nrigorous torturing of his flesh, his diet of bread and water, his utter\r\nwithdrawal from all society and from the vanities of the world, and his\r\nconstant prayer and saintly contemplation of a skull, inspired an\r\nemulation that brought about him many disciples.  The precipice on the\r\nopposite side of the canyon is well perforated with the small holes they\r\ndug in the rock to live in.  The present occupants of Mars Saba, about\r\nseventy in number, are all hermits.  They wear a coarse robe, an ugly,\r\nbrimless stove-pipe of a hat, and go without shoes.  They eat nothing\r\nwhatever but bread and salt; they drink nothing but water.  As long as\r\nthey live they can never go outside the walls, or look upon a woman--for\r\nno woman is permitted to enter Mars Saba, upon any pretext whatsoever.\r\n\r\nSome of those men have been shut up there for thirty years.  In all that\r\ndreary time they have not heard the laughter of a child or the blessed\r\nvoice of a woman; they have seen no human tears, no human smiles; they\r\nhave known no human joys, no wholesome human sorrows.  In their hearts\r\nare no memories of the past, in their brains no dreams of the future.\r\nAll that is lovable, beautiful, worthy, they have put far away from them;\r\nagainst all things that are pleasant to look upon, and all sounds that\r\nare music to the ear, they have barred their massive doors and reared\r\ntheir relentless walls of stone forever.  They have banished the tender\r\ngrace of life and left only the sapped and skinny mockery.  Their lips\r\nare lips that never kiss and never sing; their hearts are hearts that\r\nnever hate and never love; their breasts are breasts that never swell\r\nwith the sentiment, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a country and a flag.\xe2\x80\x9d  They are dead men who\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\nI set down these first thoughts because they are natural--not because\r\nthey are just or because it is right to set them down.  It is easy for\r\nbook-makers to say \xe2\x80\x9cI thought so and so as I looked upon such and such a\r\nscene\xe2\x80\x9d--when the truth is, they thought all those fine things afterwards.\r\nOne's first thought is not likely to be strictly accurate, yet it is no\r\ncrime to think it and none to write it down, subject to modification by\r\nlater experience.  These hermits are dead men, in several respects, but\r\nnot in all; and it is not proper, that, thinking ill of them at first, I\r\nshould go on doing so, or, speaking ill of them I should reiterate the\r\nwords and stick to them.  No, they treated us too kindly for that.  There\r\nis something human about them somewhere.  They knew we were foreigners\r\nand Protestants, and not likely to feel admiration or much friendliness\r\ntoward them.  But their large charity was above considering such things.\r\nThey simply saw in us men who were hungry, and thirsty, and tired, and\r\nthat was sufficient.  They opened their doors and gave us welcome.  They\r\nasked no questions, and they made no self-righteous display of their\r\nhospitality.  They fished for no compliments.  They moved quietly about,\r\nsetting the table for us, making the beds, and bringing water to wash in,\r\nand paid no heed when we said it was wrong for them to do that when we\r\nhad men whose business it was to perform such offices.  We fared most\r\ncomfortably, and sat late at dinner.  We walked all over the building\r\nwith the hermits afterward, and then sat on the lofty battlements and\r\nsmoked while we enjoyed the cool air, the wild scenery and the sunset.\r\nOne or two chose cosy bed-rooms to sleep in, but the nomadic instinct\r\nprompted the rest to sleep on the broad divan that extended around the\r\ngreat hall, because it seemed like sleeping out of doors, and so was more\r\ncheery and inviting.  It was a royal rest we had.\r\n\r\nWhen we got up to breakfast in the morning, we were new men.  For all\r\nthis hospitality no strict charge was made.  We could give something if\r\nwe chose; we need give nothing, if we were poor or if we were stingy.\r\nThe pauper and the miser are as free as any in the Catholic Convents of\r\nPalestine.  I have been educated to enmity toward every thing that is\r\nCatholic, and sometimes, in consequence of this, I find it much easier to\r\ndiscover Catholic faults than Catholic merits.  But there is one thing I\r\nfeel no disposition to overlook, and no disposition to forget: and that\r\nis, the honest gratitude I and all pilgrims owe, to the Convent Fathers\r\nin Palestine.  Their doors are always open, and there is always a welcome\r\nfor any worthy man who comes, whether he comes in rags or clad in purple.\r\nThe Catholic Convents are a priceless blessing to the poor.  A pilgrim\r\nwithout money, whether he be a Protestant or a Catholic, can travel the\r\nlength and breadth of Palestine, and in the midst of her desert wastes\r\nfind wholesome food and a clean bed every night, in these buildings.\r\nPilgrims in better circumstances are often stricken down by the sun and\r\nthe fevers of the country, and then their saving refuge is the Convent.\r\nWithout these hospitable retreats, travel in Palestine would be a\r\npleasure which none but the strongest men could dare to undertake.  Our\r\nparty, pilgrims and all, will always be ready and always willing, to\r\ntouch glasses and drink health, prosperity and long life to the Convent\r\nFathers of Palestine.\r\n\r\nSo, rested and refreshed, we fell into line and filed away over the\r\nbarren mountains of Judea, and along rocky ridges and through sterile\r\ngorges, where eternal silence and solitude reigned.  Even the scattering\r\ngroups of armed shepherds we met the afternoon before, tending their\r\nflocks of long-haired goats, were wanting here.  We saw but two living\r\ncreatures.  They were gazelles, of \xe2\x80\x9csoft-eyed\xe2\x80\x9d notoriety.  They looked\r\nlike very young kids, but they annihilated distance like an express\r\ntrain.  I have not seen animals that moved faster, unless I might say it\r\nof the antelopes of our own great plains.\r\n\r\nAt nine or ten in the morning we reached the Plain of the Shepherds, and\r\nstood in a walled garden of olives where the shepherds were watching\r\ntheir flocks by night, eighteen centuries ago, when the multitude of\r\nangels brought them the tidings that the Saviour was born.  A quarter of\r\na mile away was Bethlehem of Judea, and the pilgrims took some of the\r\nstone wall and hurried on.\r\n\r\nThe Plain of the Shepherds is a desert, paved with loose stones, void of\r\nvegetation, glaring in the fierce sun.  Only the music of the angels it\r\nknew once could charm its shrubs and flowers to life again and restore\r\nits vanished beauty.  No less potent enchantment could avail to work this\r\nmiracle.\r\n\r\nIn the huge Church of the Nativity, in Bethlehem, built fifteen hundred\r\nyears ago by the inveterate St. Helena, they took us below ground, and\r\ninto a grotto cut in the living rock.  This was the \xe2\x80\x9cmanger\xe2\x80\x9d where Christ\r\nwas born.  A silver star set in the floor bears a Latin inscription to\r\nthat effect.  It is polished with the kisses of many generations of\r\nworshiping pilgrims.  The grotto was tricked out in the usual tasteless\r\nstyle observable in all the holy places of Palestine.  As in the Church\r\nof the Holy Sepulchre, envy and uncharitableness were apparent here.  The\r\npriests and the members of the Greek and Latin churches can not come by\r\nthe same corridor to kneel in the sacred birthplace of the Redeemer, but\r\nare compelled to approach and retire by different avenues, lest they\r\nquarrel and fight on this holiest ground on earth.\r\n\r\nI have no \xe2\x80\x9cmeditations,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested by this spot where the very first\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerry Christmas!\xe2\x80\x9d was uttered in all the world, and from whence the\r\nfriend of my childhood, Santa Claus, departed on his first journey, to\r\ngladden and continue to gladden roaring firesides on wintry mornings in\r\nmany a distant land forever and forever.  I touch, with reverent finger,\r\nthe actual spot where the infant Jesus lay, but I think--nothing.\r\n\r\nYou can not think in this place any more than you can in any other in\r\nPalestine that would be likely to inspire reflection.  Beggars, cripples\r\nand monks compass you about, and make you think only of bucksheesh when\r\nyou would rather think of something more in keeping with the character of\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\nI was glad to get away, and glad when we had walked through the grottoes\r\nwhere Eusebius wrote, and Jerome fasted, and Joseph prepared for the\r\nflight into Egypt, and the dozen other distinguished grottoes, and knew\r\nwe were done.  The Church of the Nativity is almost as well packed with\r\nexceeding holy places as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre itself.  They\r\neven have in it a grotto wherein twenty thousand children were\r\nslaughtered by Herod when he was seeking the life of the infant Saviour.\r\n\r\nWe went to the Milk Grotto, of course--a cavern where Mary hid herself\r\nfor a while before the flight into Egypt.  Its walls were black before\r\nshe entered, but in suckling the Child, a drop of her milk fell upon the\r\nfloor and instantly changed the darkness of the walls to its own snowy\r\nhue.  We took many little fragments of stone from here, because it is\r\nwell known in all the East that a barren woman hath need only to touch\r\nher lips to one of these and her failing will depart from her.  We took\r\nmany specimens, to the end that we might confer happiness upon certain\r\nhouseholds that we wot of.\r\n\r\nWe got away from Bethlehem and its troops of beggars and relic-peddlers\r\nin the afternoon, and after spending some little time at Rachel's tomb,\r\nhurried to Jerusalem as fast as possible.  I never was so glad to get\r\nhome again before.  I never have enjoyed rest as I have enjoyed it during\r\nthese last few hours.  The journey to the Dead Sea, the Jordan and\r\nBethlehem was short, but it was an exhausting one.  Such roasting heat,\r\nsuch oppressive solitude, and such dismal desolation can not surely exist\r\nelsewhere on earth.  And such fatigue!\r\n\r\nThe commonest sagacity warns me that I ought to tell the customary\r\npleasant lie, and say I tore myself reluctantly away from every noted\r\nplace in Palestine.  Every body tells that, but with as little\r\nostentation as I may, I doubt the word of every he who tells it.  I could\r\ntake a dreadful oath that I have never heard any one of our forty\r\npilgrims say any thing of the sort, and they are as worthy and as\r\nsincerely devout as any that come here.  They will say it when they get\r\nhome, fast enough, but why should they not?  They do not wish to array\r\nthemselves against all the Lamartines and Grimeses in the world.  It does\r\nnot stand to reason that men are reluctant to leave places where the very\r\nlife is almost badgered out of them by importunate swarms of beggars and\r\npeddlers who hang in strings to one's sleeves and coat-tails and shriek\r\nand shout in his ears and horrify his vision with the ghastly sores and\r\nmalformations they exhibit.  One is glad to get away.  I have heard\r\nshameless people say they were glad to get away from Ladies' Festivals\r\nwhere they were importuned to buy by bevies of lovely young ladies.\r\nTransform those houris into dusky hags and ragged savages, and replace\r\ntheir rounded forms with shrunken and knotted distortions, their soft\r\nhands with scarred and hideous deformities, and the persuasive music of\r\ntheir voices with the discordant din of a hated language, and then see\r\nhow much lingering reluctance to leave could be mustered.  No, it is the\r\nneat thing to say you were reluctant, and then append the profound\r\nthoughts that \xe2\x80\x9cstruggled for utterance,\xe2\x80\x9d in your brain; but it is the\r\ntrue thing to say you were not reluctant, and found it impossible to\r\nthink at all--though in good sooth it is not respectable to say it, and\r\nnot poetical, either.\r\n\r\nWe do not think, in the holy places; we think in bed, afterwards, when\r\nthe glare, and the noise, and the confusion are gone, and in fancy we\r\nrevisit alone, the solemn monuments of the past, and summon the phantom\r\npageants of an age that has passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nWe visited all the holy places about Jerusalem which we had left\r\nunvisited when we journeyed to the Jordan and then, about three o'clock\r\none afternoon, we fell into procession and marched out at the stately\r\nDamascus gate, and the walls of Jerusalem shut us out forever.  We paused\r\non the summit of a distant hill and took a final look and made a final\r\nfarewell to the venerable city which had been such a good home to us.\r\n\r\nFor about four hours we traveled down hill constantly.  We followed a\r\nnarrow bridle-path which traversed the beds of the mountain gorges, and\r\nwhen we could we got out of the way of the long trains of laden camels\r\nand asses, and when we could not we suffered the misery of being mashed\r\nup against perpendicular walls of rock and having our legs bruised by the\r\npassing freight.  Jack was caught two or three times, and Dan and Moult\r\nas often.  One horse had a heavy fall on the slippery rocks, and the\r\nothers had narrow escapes.  However, this was as good a road as we had\r\nfound in Palestine, and possibly even the best, and so there was not much\r\ngrumbling.\r\n\r\nSometimes, in the glens, we came upon luxuriant orchards of figs,\r\napricots, pomegranates, and such things, but oftener the scenery was\r\nrugged, mountainous, verdureless and forbidding.  Here and there, towers\r\nwere perched high up on acclivities which seemed almost inaccessible.\r\nThis fashion is as old as Palestine itself and was adopted in ancient\r\ntimes for security against enemies.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the brook which furnished David the stone that killed Goliah,\r\nand no doubt we looked upon the very ground whereon that noted battle was\r\nfought.  We passed by a picturesque old gothic ruin whose stone pavements\r\nhad rung to the armed heels of many a valorous Crusader, and we rode\r\nthrough a piece of country which we were told once knew Samson as a\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nWe staid all night with the good monks at the convent of Ramleh, and in\r\nthe morning got up and galloped the horses a good part of the distance\r\nfrom there to Jaffa, or Joppa, for the plain was as level as a floor and\r\nfree from stones, and besides this was our last march in Holy Land.\r\nThese two or three hours finished, we and the tired horses could have\r\nrest and sleep as long as we wanted it.  This was the plain of which\r\nJoshua spoke when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cSun, stand thou still on Gibeon, and thou\r\nmoon in the valley of Ajalon.\xe2\x80\x9d  As we drew near to Jaffa, the boys\r\nspurred up the horses and indulged in the excitement of an actual race\r\n--an experience we had hardly had since we raced on donkeys in the Azores\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nWe came finally to the noble grove of orange-trees in which the Oriental\r\ncity of Jaffa lies buried; we passed through the walls, and rode again\r\ndown narrow streets and among swarms of animated rags, and saw other\r\nsights and had other experiences we had long been familiar with.  We\r\ndismounted, for the last time, and out in the offing, riding at anchor,\r\nwe saw the ship!  I put an exclamation point there because we felt one\r\nwhen we saw the vessel.  The long pilgrimage was ended, and somehow we\r\nseemed to feel glad of it.\r\n\r\n[For description of Jaffa, see Universal Gazetteer.] Simon the Tanner\r\nformerly lived here.  We went to his house.  All the pilgrims visit Simon\r\nthe Tanner's house.  Peter saw the vision of the beasts let down in a\r\nsheet when he lay upon the roof of Simon the Tanner's house.  It was from\r\nJaffa that Jonah sailed when he was told to go and prophesy against\r\nNineveh, and no doubt it was not far from the town that the whale threw\r\nhim up when he discovered that he had no ticket.  Jonah was disobedient,\r\nand of a fault-finding, complaining disposition, and deserves to be\r\nlightly spoken of, almost.  The timbers used in the construction of\r\nSolomon's Temple were floated to Jaffa in rafts, and the narrow opening\r\nin the reef through which they passed to the shore is not an inch wider\r\nor a shade less dangerous to navigate than it was then.  Such is the\r\nsleepy nature of the population Palestine's only good seaport has now and\r\nalways had.  Jaffa has a history and a stirring one.  It will not be\r\ndiscovered any where in this book.  If the reader will call at the\r\ncirculating library and mention my name, he will be furnished with books\r\nwhich will afford him the fullest information concerning Jaffa.\r\n\r\nSo ends the pilgrimage.  We ought to be glad that we did not make it for\r\nthe purpose of feasting our eyes upon fascinating aspects of nature, for\r\nwe should have been disappointed--at least at this season of the year.  A\r\nwriter in \xe2\x80\x9cLife in the Holy Land\xe2\x80\x9d observes:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cMonotonous and uninviting as much of the Holy Land will appear to\r\n     persons accustomed to the almost constant verdure of flowers, ample\r\n     streams and varied surface of our own country, we must remember that\r\n     its aspect to the Israelites after the weary march of forty years\r\n     through the desert must have been very different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhich all of us will freely grant.  But it truly is \xe2\x80\x9cmonotonous and\r\nuninviting,\xe2\x80\x9d and there is no sufficient reason for describing it as being\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nOf all the lands there are for dismal scenery, I think Palestine must be\r\nthe prince.  The hills are barren, they are dull of color, they are\r\nunpicturesque in shape.  The valleys are unsightly deserts fringed with a\r\nfeeble vegetation that has an expression about it of being sorrowful and\r\ndespondent.  The Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee sleep in the midst of a\r\nvast stretch of hill and plain wherein the eye rests upon no pleasant\r\ntint, no striking object, no soft picture dreaming in a purple haze or\r\nmottled with the shadows of the clouds.  Every outline is harsh, every\r\nfeature is distinct, there is no perspective--distance works no\r\nenchantment here.  It is a hopeless, dreary, heart-broken land.\r\n\r\nSmall shreds and patches of it must be very beautiful in the full flush\r\nof spring, however, and all the more beautiful by contrast with the\r\nfar-reaching desolation that surrounds them on every side.  I would like\r\nmuch to see the fringes of the Jordan in spring-time, and Shechem,\r\nEsdraelon, Ajalon and the borders of Galilee--but even then these spots\r\nwould seem mere toy gardens set at wide intervals in the waste of a\r\nlimitless desolation.\r\n\r\nPalestine sits in sackcloth and ashes.  Over it broods the spell of a\r\ncurse that has withered its fields and fettered its energies.  Where\r\nSodom and Gomorrah reared their domes and towers, that solemn sea now\r\nfloods the plain, in whose bitter waters no living thing exists--over\r\nwhose waveless surface the blistering air hangs motionless and dead\r\n--about whose borders nothing grows but weeds, and scattering tufts of\r\ncane, and that treacherous fruit that promises refreshment to parching\r\nlips, but turns to ashes at the touch.  Nazareth is forlorn; about that\r\nford of Jordan where the hosts of Israel entered the Promised Land with\r\nsongs of rejoicing, one finds only a squalid camp of fantastic Bedouins\r\nof the desert; Jericho the accursed, lies a moldering ruin, to-day, even\r\nas Joshua's miracle left it more than three thousand years ago; Bethlehem\r\nand Bethany, in their poverty and their humiliation, have nothing about\r\nthem now to remind one that they once knew the high honor of the\r\nSaviour's presence; the hallowed spot where the shepherds watched their\r\nflocks by night, and where the angels sang Peace on earth, good will to\r\nmen, is untenanted by any living creature, and unblessed by any feature\r\nthat is pleasant to the eye.  Renowned Jerusalem itself, the stateliest\r\nname in history, has lost all its ancient grandeur, and is become a\r\npauper village; the riches of Solomon are no longer there to compel the\r\nadmiration of visiting Oriental queens; the wonderful temple which was\r\nthe pride and the glory of Israel, is gone, and the Ottoman crescent is\r\nlifted above the spot where, on that most memorable day in the annals of\r\nthe world, they reared the Holy Cross.  The noted Sea of Galilee, where\r\nRoman fleets once rode at anchor and the disciples of the Saviour sailed\r\nin their ships, was long ago deserted by the devotees of war and\r\ncommerce, and its borders are a silent wilderness; Capernaum is a\r\nshapeless ruin; Magdala is the home of beggared Arabs; Bethsaida and\r\nChorazin have vanished from the earth, and the \xe2\x80\x9cdesert places\xe2\x80\x9d round\r\nabout them where thousands of men once listened to the Saviour's voice\r\nand ate the miraculous bread, sleep in the hush of a solitude that is\r\ninhabited only by birds of prey and skulking foxes.\r\n\r\nPalestine is desolate and unlovely.  And why should it be otherwise?  Can\r\nthe curse of the Deity beautify a land?\r\n\r\nPalestine is no more of this work-day world.  It is sacred to poetry and\r\ntradition--it is dream-land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nIt was worth a kingdom to be at sea again.  It was a relief to drop all\r\nanxiety whatsoever--all questions as to where we should go; how long we\r\nshould stay; whether it were worth while to go or not; all anxieties\r\nabout the condition of the horses; all such questions as \xe2\x80\x9cShall we ever\r\nget to water?\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cShall we ever lunch?\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cFerguson, how many more million\r\nmiles have we got to creep under this awful sun before we camp?\xe2\x80\x9d  It was\r\na relief to cast all these torturing little anxieties far away--ropes of\r\nsteel they were, and every one with a separate and distinct strain on it\r\n--and feel the temporary contentment that is born of the banishment of\r\nall care and responsibility.  We did not look at the compass: we did not\r\ncare, now, where the ship went to, so that she went out of sight of land\r\nas quickly as possible.  When I travel again, I wish to go in a pleasure\r\nship.  No amount of money could have purchased for us, in a strange\r\nvessel and among unfamiliar faces, the perfect satisfaction and the sense\r\nof being at home again which we experienced when we stepped on board the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c__Quaker City__,\xe2\x80\x9d--our own ship--after this wearisome pilgrimage.  It is a\r\nsomething we have felt always when we returned to her, and a something we\r\nhad no desire to sell.\r\n\r\nWe took off our blue woollen shirts, our spurs, and heavy boots, our\r\nsanguinary revolvers and our buckskin-seated pantaloons, and got shaved\r\nand came out in Christian costume once more.  All but Jack, who changed\r\nall other articles of his dress, but clung to his traveling pantaloons.\r\nThey still preserved their ample buckskin seat intact; and so his short\r\npea jacket and his long, thin legs assisted to make him a picturesque\r\nobject whenever he stood on the forecastle looking abroad upon the ocean\r\nover the bows.  At such times his father's last injunction suggested\r\nitself to me.  He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJack, my boy, you are about to go among a brilliant company of gentlemen\r\nand ladies, who are refined and cultivated, and thoroughly accomplished\r\nin the manners and customs of good society.  Listen to their\r\nconversation, study their habits of life, and learn.  Be polite and\r\nobliging to all, and considerate towards every one's opinions, failings\r\nand prejudices.  Command the just respect of all your fellow-voyagers,\r\neven though you fail to win their friendly regard.  And Jack--don't you\r\never dare, while you live, appear in public on those decks in fair\r\nweather, in a costume unbecoming your mother's drawing-room!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt would have been worth any price if the father of this hopeful youth\r\ncould have stepped on board some time, and seen him standing high on the\r\nfore-castle, pea jacket, tasseled red fez, buckskin patch and all,\r\nplacidly contemplating the ocean--a rare spectacle for any body's\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\nAfter a pleasant voyage and a good rest, we drew near to Egypt and out of\r\nthe mellowest of sunsets we saw the domes and minarets of Alexandria rise\r\ninto view.  As soon as the anchor was down, Jack and I got a boat and\r\nwent ashore.  It was night by this time, and the other passengers were\r\ncontent to remain at home and visit ancient Egypt after breakfast.  It\r\nwas the way they did at Constantinople.  They took a lively interest in\r\nnew countries, but their school-boy impatience had worn off, and they had\r\nlearned that it was wisdom to take things easy and go along comfortably\r\n--these old countries do not go away in the night; they stay till after\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the pier we found an army of Egyptian boys with donkeys\r\nno larger than themselves, waiting for passengers--for donkeys are the\r\nomnibuses of Egypt.  We preferred to walk, but we could not have our own\r\nway.  The boys crowded about us, clamored around us, and slewed their\r\ndonkeys exactly across our path, no matter which way we turned.  They\r\nwere good-natured rascals, and so were the donkeys.  We mounted, and the\r\nboys ran behind us and kept the donkeys in a furious gallop, as is the\r\nfashion at Damascus.  I believe I would rather ride a donkey than any\r\nbeast in the world.  He goes briskly, he puts on no airs, he is docile,\r\nthough opinionated.  Satan himself could not scare him, and he is\r\nconvenient--very convenient.  When you are tired riding you can rest your\r\nfeet on the ground and let him gallop from under you.\r\n\r\nWe found the hotel and secured rooms, and were happy to know that the\r\nPrince of Wales had stopped there once.  They had it every where on\r\nsigns.  No other princes had stopped there since, till Jack and I came.\r\nWe went abroad through the town, then, and found it a city of huge\r\ncommercial buildings, and broad, handsome streets brilliant with\r\ngas-light.  By night it was a sort of reminiscence of Paris.  But finally\r\nJack found an ice-cream saloon, and that closed investigations for that\r\nevening.  The weather was very hot, it had been many a day since Jack had\r\nseen ice-cream, and so it was useless to talk of leaving the saloon till\r\nit shut up.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the lost tribes of America came ashore and infested the\r\nhotels and took possession of all the donkeys and other open barouches\r\nthat offered.  They went in picturesque procession to the American\r\nConsul's; to the great gardens; to Cleopatra's Needles; to Pompey's\r\nPillar; to the palace of the Viceroy of Egypt; to the Nile; to the superb\r\ngroves of date-palms.  One of our most inveterate relic-hunters had his\r\nhammer with him, and tried to break a fragment off the upright Needle and\r\ncould not do it; he tried the prostrate one and failed; he borrowed a\r\nheavy sledge hammer from a mason and tried again.  He tried Pompey's\r\nPillar, and this baffled him.  Scattered all about the mighty monolith\r\nwere sphinxes of noble countenance, carved out of Egyptian granite as\r\nhard as blue steel, and whose shapely features the wear of five thousand\r\nyears had failed to mark or mar.  The relic-hunter battered at these\r\npersistently, and sweated profusely over his work.  He might as well have\r\nattempted to deface the moon.  They regarded him serenely with the\r\nstately smile they had worn so long, and which seemed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cPeck away,\r\npoor insect; we were not made to fear such as you; in ten-score dragging\r\nages we have seen more of your kind than there are sands at your feet:\r\nhave they left a blemish upon us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I am forgetting the Jaffa Colonists.  At Jaffa we had taken on board\r\nsome forty members of a very celebrated community.  They were male and\r\nfemale; babies, young boys and young girls; young married people, and\r\nsome who had passed a shade beyond the prime of life.  I refer to the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdams Jaffa Colony.\xe2\x80\x9d  Others had deserted before.  We left in Jaffa Mr.\r\nAdams, his wife, and fifteen unfortunates who not only had no money but\r\ndid not know where to turn or whither to go.  Such was the statement made\r\nto us.  Our forty were miserable enough in the first place, and they lay\r\nabout the decks seasick all the voyage, which about completed their\r\nmisery, I take it.  However, one or two young men remained upright, and\r\nby constant persecution we wormed out of them some little information.\r\nThey gave it reluctantly and in a very fragmentary condition, for, having\r\nbeen shamefully humbugged by their prophet, they felt humiliated and\r\nunhappy.  In such circumstances people do not like to talk.\r\n\r\nThe colony was a complete fiasco.  I have already said that such as could\r\nget away did so, from time to time.  The prophet Adams--once an actor,\r\nthen several other things, afterward a Mormon and a missionary, always an\r\nadventurer--remains at Jaffa with his handful of sorrowful subjects.  The\r\nforty we brought away with us were chiefly destitute, though not all of\r\nthem.  They wished to get to Egypt.  What might become of them then they\r\ndid not know and probably did not care--any thing to get away from hated\r\nJaffa.  They had little to hope for.  Because after many appeals to the\r\nsympathies of New England, made by strangers of Boston, through the\r\nnewspapers, and after the establishment of an office there for the\r\nreception of moneyed contributions for the Jaffa colonists, One Dollar\r\nwas subscribed.  The consul-general for Egypt showed me the newspaper\r\nparagraph which mentioned the circumstance and mentioned also the\r\ndiscontinuance of the effort and the closing of the office.  It was\r\nevident that practical New England was not sorry to be rid of such\r\nvisionaries and was not in the least inclined to hire any body to bring\r\nthem back to her.  Still, to get to Egypt, was something, in the eyes of\r\nthe unfortunate colonists, hopeless as the prospect seemed of ever\r\ngetting further.\r\n\r\nThus circumstanced, they landed at Alexandria from our ship.  One of our\r\npassengers, Mr. Moses S. Beach, of the New York Sun, inquired of the\r\nconsul-general what it would cost to send these people to their home in\r\nMaine by the way of Liverpool, and he said fifteen hundred dollars in\r\ngold would do it.  Mr. Beach gave his check for the money and so the\r\ntroubles of the Jaffa colonists were at an end.--[It was an unselfish\r\nact of benevolence; it was done without any ostentation, and has never\r\nbeen mentioned in any newspaper, I think.  Therefore it is refreshing to\r\nlearn now, several months after the above narrative was written, that\r\nanother man received all the credit of this rescue of the colonists.\r\nSuch is life.]\r\n\r\nAlexandria was too much like a European city to be novel, and we soon\r\ntired of it.  We took the cars and came up here to ancient Cairo, which\r\nis an Oriental city and of the completest pattern.  There is little about\r\nit to disabuse one's mind of the error if he should take it into his head\r\nthat he was in the heart of Arabia.  Stately camels and dromedaries,\r\nswarthy Egyptians, and likewise Turks and black Ethiopians, turbaned,\r\nsashed, and blazing in a rich variety of Oriental costumes of all shades\r\nof flashy colors, are what one sees on every hand crowding the narrow\r\nstreets and the honeycombed bazaars.  We are stopping at Shepherd's\r\nHotel, which is the worst on earth except the one I stopped at once in a\r\nsmall town in the United States.  It is pleasant to read this sketch in\r\nmy note-book, now, and know that I can stand Shepherd's Hotel, sure,\r\nbecause I have been in one just like it in America and survived:\r\n\r\n     I stopped at the Benton House.  It used to be a good hotel, but that\r\n     proves nothing--I used to be a good boy, for that matter.  Both of\r\n     us have lost character of late years.  The Benton is not a good\r\n     hotel.  The Benton lacks a very great deal of being a good hotel.\r\n     Perdition is full of better hotels than the Benton.\r\n\r\n     It was late at night when I got there, and I told the clerk I would\r\n     like plenty of lights, because I wanted to read an hour or two.\r\n     When I reached No. 15 with the porter (we came along a dim hall that\r\n     was clad in ancient carpeting, faded, worn out in many places, and\r\n     patched with old scraps of oil cloth--a hall that sank under one's\r\n     feet, and creaked dismally to every footstep,) he struck a light\r\n     --two inches of sallow, sorrowful, consumptive tallow candle, that\r\n     burned blue, and sputtered, and got discouraged and went out.  The\r\n     porter lit it again, and I asked if that was all the light the clerk\r\n     sent.  He said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh no, I've got another one here,\xe2\x80\x9d and he produced\r\n     another couple of inches of tallow candle.  I said, \xe2\x80\x9cLight them both\r\n     --I'll have to have one to see the other by.\xe2\x80\x9d  He did it, but the\r\n     result was drearier than darkness itself.  He was a cheery,\r\n     accommodating rascal.  He said he would go \xe2\x80\x9csomewheres\xe2\x80\x9d and steal a\r\n     lamp.  I abetted and encouraged him in his criminal design.  I heard\r\n     the landlord get after him in the hall ten minutes afterward.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going with that lamp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cFifteen wants it, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cFifteen! why he's got a double lot of candles--does the man want\r\n     to illuminate the house?--does he want to get up a torch-light\r\n     procession?--what is he up to, any how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cHe don't like them candles--says he wants a lamp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWhy what in the nation does----why I never heard of such a thing?\r\n     What on earth can he want with that lamp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWell, he only wants to read--that's what he says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWants to read, does he?--ain't satisfied with a thousand candles,\r\n     but has to have a lamp!--I do wonder what the devil that fellow\r\n     wants that lamp for?  Take him another candle, and then if----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cBut he wants the lamp--says he'll burn the d--d old house down if\r\n     he don't get a lamp!\xe2\x80\x9d (a remark which I never made.)\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI'd like to see him at it once.  Well, you take it along--but I\r\n     swear it beats my time, though--and see if you can't find out what\r\n     in the very nation he wants with that lamp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     And he went off growling to himself and still wondering and\r\n     wondering over the unaccountable conduct of No. 15.  The lamp was a\r\n     good one, but it revealed some disagreeable things--a bed in the\r\n     suburbs of a desert of room--a bed that had hills and valleys in it,\r\n     and you'd have to accommodate your body to the impression left in it\r\n     by the man that slept there last, before you could lie comfortably;\r\n     a carpet that had seen better days; a melancholy washstand in a\r\n     remote corner, and a dejected pitcher on it sorrowing over a broken\r\n     nose; a looking-glass split across the centre, which chopped your\r\n     head off at the chin and made you look like some dreadful unfinished\r\n     monster or other; the paper peeling in shreds from the walls.\r\n\r\n     I sighed and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is charming; and now don't you think you\r\n     could get me something to read?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     The porter said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly; the old man's got dead loads of\r\n     books;\xe2\x80\x9d and he was gone before I could tell him what sort of\r\n     literature I would rather have.  And yet his countenance expressed\r\n     the utmost confidence in his ability to execute the commission with\r\n     credit to himself.  The old man made a descent on him.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do with that pile of books?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cFifteen wants 'em, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cFifteen, is it?  He'll want a warming-pan, next--he'll want a\r\n     nurse!  Take him every thing there is in the house--take him the\r\n     bar-keeper--take him the baggage-wagon--take him a chamber-maid!\r\n     Confound me, I never saw any thing like it.  What did he say he\r\n     wants with those books?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWants to read 'em, like enough; it ain't likely he wants to eat\r\n     'em, I don't reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWants to read 'em--wants to read 'em this time of night, the\r\n     infernal lunatic!  Well, he can't have them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cBut he says he's mor'ly bound to have 'em; he says he'll just go\r\n     a-rairin' and a-chargin' through this house and raise more--well,\r\n     there's no tellin' what he won't do if he don't get 'em; because\r\n     he's drunk and crazy and desperate, and nothing'll soothe him down\r\n     but them cussed books.\xe2\x80\x9d  [I had not made any threats, and was not in\r\n     the condition ascribed to me by the porter.]\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWell, go on; but I will be around when he goes to rairing and\r\n     charging, and the first rair he makes I'll make him rair out of the\r\n     window.\xe2\x80\x9d  And then the old gentleman went off, growling as before.\r\n\r\n     The genius of that porter was something wonderful.  He put an armful\r\n     of books on the bed and said \xe2\x80\x9cGood night\xe2\x80\x9d as confidently as if he\r\n     knew perfectly well that those books were exactly my style of\r\n     reading matter.  And well he might.  His selection covered the whole\r\n     range of legitimate literature.  It comprised \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great\r\n     Consummation,\xe2\x80\x9d by Rev. Dr. Cummings--theology; \xe2\x80\x9cRevised Statutes of\r\n     the State of Missouri\xe2\x80\x9d--law; \xe2\x80\x9cThe Complete Horse-Doctor\xe2\x80\x9d--medicine;\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe Toilers of the Sea,\xe2\x80\x9d by Victor Hugo--romance; \xe2\x80\x9cThe works of\r\n     William Shakspeare\xe2\x80\x9d--poetry.  I shall never cease to admire the tact\r\n     and the intelligence of that gifted porter.\r\n\r\nBut all the donkeys in Christendom, and most of the Egyptian boys, I\r\nthink, are at the door, and there is some noise going on, not to put it\r\nin stronger language.--We are about starting to the illustrious Pyramids\r\nof Egypt, and the donkeys for the voyage are under inspection.  I will go\r\nand select one before the choice animals are all taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nThe donkeys were all good, all handsome, all strong and in good\r\ncondition, all fast and all willing to prove it.  They were the best we\r\nhad found any where, and the most 'recherche'.  I do not know what\r\n'recherche' is, but that is what these donkeys were, anyhow.  Some\r\nwere of a soft mouse-color, and the others were white, black, and\r\nvari-colored.  Some were close-shaven, all over, except that a tuft like\r\na paint-brush was left on the end of the tail.  Others were so shaven in\r\nfanciful landscape garden patterns, as to mark their bodies with curving\r\nlines, which were bounded on one side by hair and on the other by the\r\nclose plush left by the shears.  They had all been newly barbered, and\r\nwere exceedingly stylish.  Several of the white ones were barred like\r\nzebras with rainbow stripes of blue and red and yellow paint.  These\r\nwere indescribably gorgeous.  Dan and Jack selected from this lot\r\nbecause they brought back Italian reminiscences of the \xe2\x80\x9cold masters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The saddles were the high, stuffy, frog-shaped things we had known in\r\nEphesus and Smyrna.  The donkey-boys were lively young Egyptian rascals\r\nwho could follow a donkey and keep him in a canter half a day without\r\ntiring.  We had plenty of spectators when we mounted, for the hotel was\r\nfull of English people bound overland to India and officers getting\r\nready for the African campaign against the Abyssinian King Theodorus.\r\nWe were not a very large party, but as we charged through the streets of\r\nthe great metropolis, we made noise for five hundred, and displayed\r\nactivity and created excitement in proportion.  Nobody can steer a\r\ndonkey, and some collided with camels, dervishes, effendis, asses,\r\nbeggars and every thing else that offered to the donkeys a reasonable\r\nchance for a collision. When we turned into the broad avenue that leads\r\nout of the city toward Old Cairo, there was plenty of room.  The walls\r\nof stately date-palms that fenced the gardens and bordered the way,\r\nthrew their shadows down and made the air cool and bracing.  We rose to\r\nthe spirit of the time and the race became a wild rout, a stampede, a\r\nterrific panic.  I wish to live to enjoy it again.\r\n\r\nSomewhere along this route we had a few startling exhibitions of Oriental\r\nsimplicity.  A girl apparently thirteen years of age came along the great\r\nthoroughfare dressed like Eve before the fall.  We would have called her\r\nthirteen at home; but here girls who look thirteen are often not more\r\nthan nine, in reality.  Occasionally we saw stark-naked men of superb\r\nbuild, bathing, and making no attempt at concealment.  However, an hour's\r\nacquaintance with this cheerful custom reconciled the pilgrims to it, and\r\nthen it ceased to occasion remark.  Thus easily do even the most\r\nstartling novelties grow tame and spiritless to these sight-surfeited\r\nwanderers.\r\n\r\nArrived at Old Cairo, the camp-followers took up the donkeys and tumbled\r\nthem bodily aboard a small boat with a lateen sail, and we followed and\r\ngot under way.  The deck was closely packed with donkeys and men; the two\r\nsailors had to climb over and under and through the wedged mass to work\r\nthe sails, and the steersman had to crowd four or five donkeys out of the\r\nway when he wished to swing his tiller and put his helm hard-down.  But\r\nwhat were their troubles to us?  We had nothing to do; nothing to do but\r\nenjoy the trip; nothing to do but shove the donkeys off our corns and\r\nlook at the charming scenery of the Nile.\r\n\r\nOn the island at our right was the machine they call the Nilometer, a\r\nstone-column whose business it is to mark the rise of the river and\r\nprophecy whether it will reach only thirty-two feet and produce a famine,\r\nor whether it will properly flood the land at forty and produce plenty,\r\nor whether it will rise to forty-three and bring death and destruction to\r\nflocks and crops--but how it does all this they could not explain to us\r\nso that we could understand.  On the same island is still shown the spot\r\nwhere Pharaoh's daughter found Moses in the bulrushes.  Near the spot we\r\nsailed from, the Holy Family dwelt when they sojourned in Egypt till\r\nHerod should complete his slaughter of the innocents.  The same tree they\r\nrested under when they first arrived, was there a short time ago, but the\r\nViceroy of Egypt sent it to the Empress Eugenie lately.  He was just in\r\ntime, otherwise our pilgrims would have had it.\r\n\r\nThe Nile at this point is muddy, swift and turbid, and does not lack a\r\ngreat deal of being as wide as the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nWe scrambled up the steep bank at the shabby town of Ghizeh, mounted the\r\ndonkeys again, and scampered away.  For four or five miles the route lay\r\nalong a high embankment which they say is to be the bed of a railway the\r\nSultan means to build for no other reason than that when the Empress of\r\nthe French comes to visit him she can go to the Pyramids in comfort.\r\nThis is true Oriental hospitality.  I am very glad it is our privilege to\r\nhave donkeys instead of cars.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of a few miles the Pyramids rising above the palms,\r\nlooked very clean-cut, very grand and imposing, and very soft and filmy,\r\nas well.  They swam in a rich haze that took from them all suggestions of\r\nunfeeling stone, and made them seem only the airy nothings of a dream\r\n--structures which might blossom into tiers of vague arches, or ornate\r\ncolonnades, may be, and change and change again, into all graceful forms\r\nof architecture, while we looked, and then melt deliciously away and\r\nblend with the tremulous atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the levee we left the mules and went in a sailboat across\r\nan arm of the Nile or an overflow, and landed where the sands of the\r\nGreat Sahara left their embankment, as straight as a wall, along the\r\nverge of the alluvial plain of the river.  A laborious walk in the\r\nflaming sun brought us to the foot of the great Pyramid of Cheops.  It\r\nwas a fairy vision no longer.  It was a corrugated, unsightly mountain of\r\nstone.  Each of its monstrous sides was a wide stairway which rose\r\nupward, step above step, narrowing as it went, till it tapered to a point\r\nfar aloft in the air.  Insect men and women--pilgrims from the Quaker\r\nCity--were creeping about its dizzy perches, and one little black swarm\r\nwere waving postage stamps from the airy summit--handkerchiefs will be\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nOf course we were besieged by a rabble of muscular Egyptians and Arabs\r\nwho wanted the contract of dragging us to the top--all tourists are.  Of\r\ncourse you could not hear your own voice for the din that was around you.\r\nOf course the Sheiks said they were the only responsible parties; that\r\nall contracts must be made with them, all moneys paid over to them, and\r\nnone exacted from us by any but themselves alone.  Of course they\r\ncontracted that the varlets who dragged us up should not mention\r\nbucksheesh once.  For such is the usual routine.  Of course we contracted\r\nwith them, paid them, were delivered into the hands of the draggers,\r\ndragged up the Pyramids, and harried and be-deviled for bucksheesh from\r\nthe foundation clear to the summit.  We paid it, too, for we were\r\npurposely spread very far apart over the vast side of the Pyramid.  There\r\nwas no help near if we called, and the Herculeses who dragged us had a\r\nway of asking sweetly and flatteringly for bucksheesh, which was\r\nseductive, and of looking fierce and threatening to throw us down the\r\nprecipice, which was persuasive and convincing.\r\n\r\nEach step being full as high as a dinner-table; there being very, very\r\nmany of the steps; an Arab having hold of each of our arms and springing\r\nupward from step to step and snatching us with them, forcing us to lift\r\nour feet as high as our breasts every time, and do it rapidly and keep it\r\nup till we were ready to faint, who shall say it is not lively,\r\nexhilarating, lacerating, muscle-straining, bone-wrenching and perfectly\r\nexcruciating and exhausting pastime, climbing the Pyramids?  I beseeched\r\nthe varlets not to twist all my joints asunder; I iterated, reiterated,\r\neven swore to them that I did not wish to beat any body to the top; did\r\nall I could to convince them that if I got there the last of all I would\r\nfeel blessed above men and grateful to them forever; I begged them,\r\nprayed them, pleaded with them to let me stop and rest a moment--only one\r\nlittle moment: and they only answered with some more frightful springs,\r\nand an unenlisted volunteer behind opened a bombardment of determined\r\nboosts with his head which threatened to batter my whole political\r\neconomy to wreck and ruin.\r\n\r\nTwice, for one minute, they let me rest while they extorted bucksheesh,\r\nand then continued their maniac flight up the Pyramid.  They wished to\r\nbeat the other parties.  It was nothing to them that I, a stranger, must\r\nbe sacrificed upon the altar of their unholy ambition.  But in the midst\r\nof sorrow, joy blooms.  Even in this dark hour I had a sweet consolation.\r\nFor I knew that except these Mohammedans repented they would go straight\r\nto perdition some day.  And they never repent--they never forsake their\r\npaganism.  This thought calmed me, cheered me, and I sank down, limp and\r\nexhausted, upon the summit, but happy, so happy and serene within.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, a mighty sea of yellow sand stretched away toward the\r\nends of the earth, solemn, silent, shorn of vegetation, its solitude\r\nuncheered by any forms of creature life; on the other, the Eden of Egypt\r\nwas spread below us--a broad green floor, cloven by the sinuous river,\r\ndotted with villages, its vast distances measured and marked by the\r\ndiminishing stature of receding clusters of palms.  It lay asleep in an\r\nenchanted atmosphere.  There was no sound, no motion.  Above the\r\ndate-plumes in the middle distance, swelled a domed and pinnacled mass,\r\nglimmering through a tinted, exquisite mist; away toward the horizon a\r\ndozen shapely pyramids watched over ruined Memphis: and at our feet the\r\nbland impassible Sphynx looked out upon the picture from her throne in\r\nthe sands as placidly and pensively as she had looked upon its like full\r\nfifty lagging centuries ago.\r\n\r\nWe suffered torture no pen can describe from the hungry appeals for\r\nbucksheesh that gleamed from Arab eyes and poured incessantly from Arab\r\nlips.  Why try to call up the traditions of vanished Egyptian grandeur;\r\nwhy try to fancy Egypt following dead Rameses to his tomb in the Pyramid,\r\nor the long multitude of Israel departing over the desert yonder?  Why\r\ntry to think at all?  The thing was impossible.  One must bring his\r\nmeditations cut and dried, or else cut and dry them afterward.\r\n\r\nThe traditional Arab proposed, in the traditional way, to run down\r\nCheops, cross the eighth of a mile of sand intervening between it and the\r\ntall pyramid of Cephron, ascend to Cephron's summit and return to us on\r\nthe top of Cheops--all in nine minutes by the watch, and the whole\r\nservice to be rendered for a single dollar.  In the first flush of\r\nirritation, I said let the Arab and his exploits go to the mischief.\r\nBut stay.  The upper third of Cephron was coated with dressed marble,\r\nsmooth as glass.  A blessed thought entered my brain.  He must infallibly\r\nbreak his neck.  Close the contract with dispatch, I said, and let him\r\ngo.  He started.  We watched.  He went bounding down the vast broadside,\r\nspring after spring, like an ibex.  He grew small and smaller till he\r\nbecame a bobbing pigmy, away down toward the bottom--then disappeared.\r\nWe turned and peered over the other side--forty seconds--eighty seconds\r\n--a hundred--happiness, he is dead already!--two minutes--and a quarter\r\n--\xe2\x80\x9cThere he goes!\xe2\x80\x9d  Too true--it was too true.  He was very small, now.\r\nGradually, but surely, he overcame the level ground.  He began to spring\r\nand climb again.  Up, up, up--at last he reached the smooth coating--now\r\nfor it.  But he clung to it with toes and fingers, like a fly.  He\r\ncrawled this way and that--away to the right, slanting upward--away to\r\nthe left, still slanting upward--and stood at last, a black peg on the\r\nsummit, and waved his pigmy scarf!  Then he crept downward to the raw\r\nsteps again, then picked up his agile heels and flew.  We lost him\r\npresently.  But presently again we saw him under us, mounting with\r\nundiminished energy.  Shortly he bounded into our midst with a gallant\r\nwar-whoop.  Time, eight minutes, forty-one seconds.  He had won.  His\r\nbones were intact.  It was a failure.  I reflected.  I said to myself, he\r\nis tired, and must grow dizzy.  I will risk another dollar on him.\r\n\r\nHe started again.  Made the trip again.  Slipped on the smooth coating\r\n--I almost had him.  But an infamous crevice saved him.  He was with us\r\nonce more--perfectly sound.  Time, eight minutes, forty-six seconds.\r\n\r\nI said to Dan, \xe2\x80\x9cLend me a dollar--I can beat this game, yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWorse and worse.  He won again.  Time, eight minutes, forty-eight\r\nseconds.  I was out of all patience, now.  I was desperate.--Money was\r\nno longer of any consequence.  I said, \xe2\x80\x9cSirrah, I will give you a hundred\r\ndollars to jump off this pyramid head first.  If you do not like the\r\nterms, name your bet.  I scorn to stand on expenses now.  I will stay\r\nright here and risk money on you as long as Dan has got a cent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was in a fair way to win, now, for it was a dazzling opportunity for an\r\nArab.  He pondered a moment, and would have done it, I think, but his\r\nmother arrived, then, and interfered.  Her tears moved me--I never can\r\nlook upon the tears of woman with indifference--and I said I would give\r\nher a hundred to jump off, too.\r\n\r\nBut it was a failure.  The Arabs are too high-priced in Egypt.  They put\r\non airs unbecoming to such savages.\r\n\r\nWe descended, hot and out of humor.  The dragoman lit candles, and we all\r\nentered a hole near the base of the pyramid, attended by a crazy rabble\r\nof Arabs who thrust their services upon us uninvited.  They dragged us up\r\na long inclined chute, and dripped candle-grease all over us.  This chute\r\nwas not more than twice as wide and high as a Saratoga trunk, and was\r\nwalled, roofed and floored with solid blocks of Egyptian granite as wide\r\nas a wardrobe, twice as thick and three times as long.  We kept on\r\nclimbing, through the oppressive gloom, till I thought we ought to be\r\nnearing the top of the pyramid again, and then came to the \xe2\x80\x9cQueen's\r\nChamber,\xe2\x80\x9d and shortly to the Chamber of the King.  These large apartments\r\nwere tombs.  The walls were built of monstrous masses of smoothed\r\ngranite, neatly joined together.  Some of them were nearly as large\r\nsquare as an ordinary parlor.  A great stone sarcophagus like a bath-tub\r\nstood in the centre of the King's Chamber.  Around it were gathered a\r\npicturesque group of Arab savages and soiled and tattered pilgrims, who\r\nheld their candles aloft in the gloom while they chattered, and the\r\nwinking blurs of light shed a dim glory down upon one of the\r\nirrepressible memento-seekers who was pecking at the venerable\r\nsarcophagus with his sacrilegious hammer.\r\n\r\nWe struggled out to the open air and the bright sunshine, and for the\r\nspace of thirty minutes received ragged Arabs by couples, dozens and\r\nplatoons, and paid them bucksheesh for services they swore and proved by\r\neach other that they had rendered, but which we had not been aware of\r\nbefore--and as each party was paid, they dropped into the rear of the\r\nprocession and in due time arrived again with a newly-invented delinquent\r\nlist for liquidation.\r\n\r\nWe lunched in the shade of the pyramid, and in the midst of this\r\nencroaching and unwelcome company, and then Dan and Jack and I started\r\naway for a walk.  A howling swarm of beggars followed us--surrounded us\r\n--almost headed us off.  A sheik, in flowing white bournous and gaudy\r\nhead-gear, was with them.  He wanted more bucksheesh.  But we had\r\nadopted a new code--it was millions for defense, but not a cent for\r\nbucksheesh.  I asked him if he could persuade the others to depart if we\r\npaid him.  He said yes--for ten francs.  We accepted the contract, and\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow persuade your vassals to fall back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe swung his long staff round his head and three Arabs bit the dust.  He\r\ncapered among the mob like a very maniac.  His blows fell like hail, and\r\nwherever one fell a subject went down.  We had to hurry to the rescue and\r\ntell him it was only necessary to damage them a little, he need not kill\r\nthem.--In two minutes we were alone with the sheik, and remained so.\r\nThe persuasive powers of this illiterate savage were remarkable.\r\n\r\nEach side of the Pyramid of Cheops is about as long as the Capitol at\r\nWashington, or the Sultan's new palace on the Bosporus, and is longer\r\nthan the greatest depth of St. Peter's at Rome--which is to say that each\r\nside of Cheops extends seven hundred and some odd feet.  It is about\r\nseventy-five feet higher than the cross on St. Peter's.  The first time I\r\never went down the Mississippi, I thought the highest bluff on the river\r\nbetween St. Louis and New Orleans--it was near Selma, Missouri--was\r\nprobably the highest mountain in the world.  It is four hundred and\r\nthirteen feet high.  It still looms in my memory with undiminished\r\ngrandeur.  I can still see the trees and bushes growing smaller and\r\nsmaller as I followed them up its huge slant with my eye, till they\r\nbecame a feathery fringe on the distant summit.  This symmetrical Pyramid\r\nof Cheops--this solid mountain of stone reared by the patient hands of\r\nmen--this mighty tomb of a forgotten monarch--dwarfs my cherished\r\nmountain.  For it is four hundred and eighty feet high.  In still earlier\r\nyears than those I have been recalling, Holliday's Hill, in our town, was\r\nto me the noblest work of God.  It appeared to pierce the skies.  It was\r\nnearly three hundred feet high.  In those days I pondered the subject\r\nmuch, but I never could understand why it did not swathe its summit with\r\nnever-failing clouds, and crown its majestic brow with everlasting snows.\r\nI had heard that such was the custom of great mountains in other parts of\r\nthe world.  I remembered how I worked with another boy, at odd afternoons\r\nstolen from study and paid for with stripes, to undermine and start from\r\nits bed an immense boulder that rested upon the edge of that hilltop; I\r\nremembered how, one Saturday afternoon, we gave three hours of honest\r\neffort to the task, and saw at last that our reward was at hand; I\r\nremembered how we sat down, then, and wiped the perspiration away, and\r\nwaited to let a picnic party get out of the way in the road below--and\r\nthen we started the boulder.  It was splendid.  It went crashing down the\r\nhillside, tearing up saplings, mowing bushes down like grass, ripping and\r\ncrushing and smashing every thing in its path--eternally splintered and\r\nscattered a wood pile at the foot of the hill, and then sprang from the\r\nhigh bank clear over a dray in the road--the negro glanced up once and\r\ndodged--and the next second it made infinitesimal mince-meat of a frame\r\ncooper-shop, and the coopers swarmed out like bees.  Then we said it was\r\nperfectly magnificent, and left.  Because the coopers were starting up\r\nthe hill to inquire.\r\n\r\nStill, that mountain, prodigious as it was, was nothing to the Pyramid of\r\nCheops.  I could conjure up no comparison that would convey to my mind a\r\nsatisfactory comprehension of the magnitude of a pile of monstrous stones\r\nthat covered thirteen acres of ground and stretched upward four hundred\r\nand eighty tiresome feet, and so I gave it up and walked down to the\r\nSphynx.\r\n\r\nAfter years of waiting, it was before me at last.  The great face was so\r\nsad, so earnest, so longing, so patient.  There was a dignity not of\r\nearth in its mien, and in its countenance a benignity such as never any\r\nthing human wore.  It was stone, but it seemed sentient.  If ever image\r\nof stone thought, it was thinking.  It was looking toward the verge of\r\nthe landscape, yet looking at nothing--nothing but distance and vacancy.\r\nIt was looking over and beyond every thing of the present, and far into\r\nthe past.  It was gazing out over the ocean of Time--over lines of\r\ncentury-waves which, further and further receding, closed nearer and\r\nnearer together, and blended at last into one unbroken tide, away toward\r\nthe horizon of remote antiquity.  It was thinking of the wars of departed\r\nages; of the empires it had seen created and destroyed; of the nations\r\nwhose birth it had witnessed, whose progress it had watched, whose\r\nannihilation it had noted; of the joy and sorrow, the life and death, the\r\ngrandeur and decay, of five thousand slow revolving years.  It was the\r\ntype of an attribute of man--of a faculty of his heart and brain.  It was\r\nMEMORY--RETROSPECTION--wrought into visible, tangible form.  All who know\r\nwhat pathos there is in memories of days that are accomplished and faces\r\nthat have vanished--albeit only a trifling score of years gone by--will\r\nhave some appreciation of the pathos that dwells in these grave eyes that\r\nlook so steadfastly back upon the things they knew before History was\r\nborn--before Tradition had being--things that were, and forms that moved,\r\nin a vague era which even Poetry and Romance scarce know of--and passed\r\none by one away and left the stony dreamer solitary in the midst of a\r\nstrange new age, and uncomprehended scenes.\r\n\r\nThe Sphynx is grand in its loneliness; it is imposing in its magnitude;\r\nit is impressive in the mystery that hangs over its story.  And there is\r\nthat in the overshadowing majesty of this eternal figure of stone, with\r\nits accusing memory of the deeds of all ages, which reveals to one\r\nsomething of what he shall feel when he shall stand at last in the awful\r\npresence of God.\r\n\r\nThere are some things which, for the credit of America, should be left\r\nunsaid, perhaps; but these very things happen sometimes to be the very\r\nthings which, for the real benefit of Americans, ought to have prominent\r\nnotice.  While we stood looking, a wart, or an excrescence of some kind,\r\nappeared on the jaw of the Sphynx.  We heard the familiar clink of a\r\nhammer, and understood the case at once.  One of our well meaning\r\nreptiles--I mean relic-hunters--had crawled up there and was trying to\r\nbreak a \xe2\x80\x9cspecimen\xe2\x80\x9d from the face of this the most majestic creation the\r\nhand of man has wrought.  But the great image contemplated the dead ages\r\nas calmly as ever, unconscious of the small insect that was fretting at\r\nits jaw.  Egyptian granite that has defied the storms and earthquakes of\r\nall time has nothing to fear from the tack-hammers of ignorant\r\nexcursionists--highwaymen like this specimen.  He failed in his\r\nenterprise.  We sent a sheik to arrest him if he had the authority, or to\r\nwarn him, if he had not, that by the laws of Egypt the crime he was\r\nattempting to commit was punishable with imprisonment or the bastinado.\r\nThen he desisted and went away.\r\n\r\nThe Sphynx: a hundred and twenty-five feet long, sixty feet high, and a\r\nhundred and two feet around the head, if I remember rightly--carved out\r\nof one solid block of stone harder than any iron.  The block must have\r\nbeen as large as the Fifth Avenue Hotel before the usual waste (by the\r\nnecessities of sculpture) of a fourth or a half of the original mass was\r\nbegun.  I only set down these figures and these remarks to suggest the\r\nprodigious labor the carving of it so elegantly, so symmetrically, so\r\nfaultlessly, must have cost.  This species of stone is so hard that\r\nfigures cut in it remain sharp and unmarred after exposure to the weather\r\nfor two or three thousand years.  Now did it take a hundred years of\r\npatient toil to carve the Sphynx?  It seems probable.\r\n\r\nSomething interfered, and we did not visit the Red Sea and walk upon the\r\nsands of Arabia.  I shall not describe the great mosque of Mehemet Ali,\r\nwhose entire inner walls are built of polished and glistening alabaster;\r\nI shall not tell how the little birds have built their nests in the\r\nglobes of the great chandeliers that hang in the mosque, and how they\r\nfill the whole place with their music and are not afraid of any body\r\nbecause their audacity is pardoned, their rights are respected, and\r\nnobody is allowed to interfere with them, even though the mosque be thus\r\ndoomed to go unlighted; I certainly shall not tell the hackneyed story of\r\nthe massacre of the Mamelukes, because I am glad the lawless rascals were\r\nmassacred, and I do not wish to get up any sympathy in their behalf; I\r\nshall not tell how that one solitary Mameluke jumped his horse a hundred\r\nfeet down from the battlements of the citadel and escaped, because I do\r\nnot think much of that--I could have done it myself; I shall not tell of\r\nJoseph's well which he dug in the solid rock of the citadel hill and\r\nwhich is still as good as new, nor how the same mules he bought to draw\r\nup the water (with an endless chain) are still at it yet and are getting\r\ntired of it, too; I shall not tell about Joseph's granaries which he\r\nbuilt to store the grain in, what time the Egyptian brokers were \xe2\x80\x9cselling\r\nshort,\xe2\x80\x9d unwitting that there would be no corn in all the land when it\r\nshould be time for them to deliver; I shall not tell any thing about the\r\nstrange, strange city of Cairo, because it is only a repetition, a good\r\ndeal intensified and exaggerated, of the Oriental cities I have already\r\nspoken of; I shall not tell of the Great Caravan which leaves for Mecca\r\nevery year, for I did not see it; nor of the fashion the people have of\r\nprostrating themselves and so forming a long human pavement to be ridden\r\nover by the chief of the expedition on its return, to the end that their\r\nsalvation may be thus secured, for I did not see that either; I shall not\r\nspeak of the railway, for it is like any other railway--I shall only say\r\nthat the fuel they use for the locomotive is composed of mummies three\r\nthousand years old, purchased by the ton or by the graveyard for that\r\npurpose, and that sometimes one hears the profane engineer call out\r\npettishly, \xe2\x80\x9cD--n these plebeians, they don't burn worth a cent--pass out\r\na King;\xe2\x80\x9d--[Stated to me for a fact.  I only tell it as I got it.  I am\r\nwilling to believe it.  I can believe any thing.]--I shall not tell of\r\nthe groups of mud cones stuck like wasps' nests upon a thousand mounds\r\nabove high water-mark the length and breadth of Egypt--villages of the\r\nlower classes; I shall not speak of the boundless sweep of level plain,\r\ngreen with luxuriant grain, that gladdens the eye as far as it can pierce\r\nthrough the soft, rich atmosphere of Egypt; I shall not speak of the\r\nvision of the Pyramids seen at a distance of five and twenty miles, for\r\nthe picture is too ethereal to be limned by an uninspired pen; I shall\r\nnot tell of the crowds of dusky women who flocked to the cars when they\r\nstopped a moment at a station, to sell us a drink of water or a ruddy,\r\njuicy pomegranate; I shall not tell of the motley multitudes and wild\r\ncostumes that graced a fair we found in full blast at another barbarous\r\nstation; I shall not tell how we feasted on fresh dates and enjoyed the\r\npleasant landscape all through the flying journey; nor how we thundered\r\ninto Alexandria, at last, swarmed out of the cars, rowed aboard the ship,\r\nleft a comrade behind, (who was to return to Europe, thence home,) raised\r\nthe anchor, and turned our bows homeward finally and forever from the\r\nlong voyage; nor how, as the mellow sun went down upon the oldest land on\r\nearth, Jack and Moult assembled in solemn state in the smoking-room and\r\nmourned over the lost comrade the whole night long, and would not be\r\ncomforted.  I shall not speak a word of any of these things, or write a\r\nline.  They shall be as a sealed book.  I do not know what a sealed book\r\nis, because I never saw one, but a sealed book is the expression to use\r\nin this connection, because it is popular.\r\n\r\nWe were glad to have seen the land which was the mother of civilization\r\n--which taught Greece her letters, and through Greece Rome, and through\r\nRome the world; the land which could have humanized and civilized the\r\nhapless children of Israel, but allowed them to depart out of her borders\r\nlittle better than savages.  We were glad to have seen that land which\r\nhad an enlightened religion with future eternal rewards and punishment in\r\nit, while even Israel's religion contained no promise of a hereafter.\r\nWe were glad to have seen that land which had glass three thousand years\r\nbefore England had it, and could paint upon it as none of us can paint\r\nnow; that land which knew, three thousand years ago, well nigh all of\r\nmedicine and surgery which science has discovered lately; which had all\r\nthose curious surgical instruments which science has invented recently;\r\nwhich had in high excellence a thousand luxuries and necessities of an\r\nadvanced civilization which we have gradually contrived and accumulated\r\nin modern times and claimed as things that were new under the sun; that\r\nhad paper untold centuries before we dreampt of it--and waterfalls before\r\nour women thought of them; that had a perfect system of common schools so\r\nlong before we boasted of our achievements in that direction that it\r\nseems forever and forever ago; that so embalmed the dead that flesh was\r\nmade almost immortal--which we can not do; that built temples which mock\r\nat destroying time and smile grimly upon our lauded little prodigies of\r\narchitecture; that old land that knew all which we know now, perchance,\r\nand more; that walked in the broad highway of civilization in the gray\r\ndawn of creation, ages and ages before we were born; that left the\r\nimpress of exalted, cultivated Mind upon the eternal front of the Sphynx\r\nto confound all scoffers who, when all her other proofs had passed away,\r\nmight seek to persuade the world that imperial Egypt, in the days of her\r\nhigh renown, had groped in darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nWe were at sea now, for a very long voyage--we were to pass through the\r\nentire length of the Levant; through the entire length of the\r\nMediterranean proper, also, and then cross the full width of the\r\nAtlantic--a voyage of several weeks.  We naturally settled down into a\r\nvery slow, stay-at-home manner of life, and resolved to be quiet,\r\nexemplary people, and roam no more for twenty or thirty days.  No more,\r\nat least, than from stem to stern of the ship.  It was a very comfortable\r\nprospect, though, for we were tired and needed a long rest.\r\n\r\nWe were all lazy and satisfied, now, as the meager entries in my\r\nnote-book (that sure index, to me, of my condition), prove.  What a\r\nstupid thing a note-book gets to be at sea, any way.  Please observe the\r\nstyle:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cSunday--Services, as usual, at four bells.  Services at night,\r\n     also.  No cards.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cMonday--Beautiful day, but rained hard.  The cattle purchased at\r\n     Alexandria for beef ought to be shingled.  Or else fattened.  The\r\n     water stands in deep puddles in the depressions forward of their\r\n     after shoulders.  Also here and there all over their backs.  It is\r\n     well they are not cows--it would soak in and ruin the milk.  The\r\n     poor devil eagle--[Afterwards presented to the Central Park.]--from\r\n     Syria looks miserable and droopy in the rain, perched on the forward\r\n     capstan.  He appears to have his own opinion of a sea voyage, and if\r\n     it were put into language and the language solidified, it would\r\n     probably essentially dam the widest river in the world.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cTuesday--Somewhere in the neighborhood of the island of Malta.  Can\r\n     not stop there.  Cholera.  Weather very stormy.  Many passengers\r\n     seasick and invisible.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWednesday--Weather still very savage.  Storm blew two land birds to\r\n     sea, and they came on board.  A hawk was blown off, also.  He\r\n     circled round and round the ship, wanting to light, but afraid of\r\n     the people.  He was so tired, though, that he had to light, at last,\r\n     or perish.  He stopped in the foretop, repeatedly, and was as often\r\n     blown away by the wind.  At last Harry caught him.  Sea full of\r\n     flying-fish.  They rise in flocks of three hundred and flash along\r\n     above the tops of the waves a distance of two or three hundred feet,\r\n     then fall and disappear.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThursday--Anchored off Algiers, Africa.  Beautiful city, beautiful\r\n     green hilly landscape behind it.  Staid half a day and left.  Not\r\n     permitted to land, though we showed a clean bill of health.  They\r\n     were afraid of Egyptian plague and cholera.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cFriday--Morning, dominoes.  Afternoon, dominoes.  Evening,\r\n     promenading the deck.  Afterwards, charades.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday--Morning, dominoes.  Afternoon, dominoes.  Evening,\r\n     promenading the decks.  Afterwards, dominoes.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cSunday--Morning service, four bells.  Evening service, eight bells.\r\n     Monotony till midnight.--Whereupon, dominoes.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cMonday--Morning, dominoes.  Afternoon, dominoes.  Evening,\r\n     promenading the decks.  Afterward, charades and a lecture from Dr.\r\n     C. Dominoes.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cNo date--Anchored off the picturesque city of Cagliari, Sardinia.\r\n     Staid till midnight, but not permitted to land by these infamous\r\n     foreigners.  They smell inodorously--they do not wash--they dare not\r\n     risk cholera.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThursday--Anchored off the beautiful cathedral city of Malaga,\r\n     Spain.--Went ashore in the captain's boat--not ashore, either, for\r\n     they would not let us land.  Quarantine.  Shipped my newspaper\r\n     correspondence, which they took with tongs, dipped it in sea water,\r\n     clipped it full of holes, and then fumigated it with villainous\r\n     vapors till it smelt like a Spaniard.  Inquired about chances to run\r\n     to blockade and visit the Alhambra at Granada.  Too risky--they\r\n     might hang a body.  Set sail--middle of afternoon.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so on, and so on, and so forth, for several days.  Finally,\r\n     anchored off Gibraltar, which looks familiar and home-like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt reminds me of the journal I opened with the New Year, once, when I was\r\na boy and a confiding and a willing prey to those impossible schemes of\r\nreform which well-meaning old maids and grandmothers set for the feet of\r\nunwary youths at that season of the year--setting oversized tasks for\r\nthem, which, necessarily failing, as infallibly weaken the boy's strength\r\nof will, diminish his confidence in himself and injure his chances of\r\nsuccess in life.  Please accept of an extract:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cMonday--Got up, washed, went to bed.\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cTuesday--Got up, washed, went to bed.\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWednesday--Got up, washed, went to bed.\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThursday--Got up, washed, went to bed.\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cFriday--Got up, washed, went to bed.\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cNext Friday--Got up, washed, went to bed.\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cFriday fortnight--Got up, washed, went to bed.\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cFollowing month--Got up, washed, went to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI stopped, then, discouraged.  Startling events appeared to be too rare,\r\nin my career, to render a diary necessary.  I still reflect with pride,\r\nhowever, that even at that early age I washed when I got up.  That\r\njournal finished me.  I never have had the nerve to keep one since.  My\r\nloss of confidence in myself in that line was permanent.\r\n\r\nThe ship had to stay a week or more at Gibraltar to take in coal for the\r\nhome voyage.\r\n\r\nIt would be very tiresome staying here, and so four of us ran the\r\nquarantine blockade and spent seven delightful days in Seville, Cordova,\r\nCadiz, and wandering through the pleasant rural scenery of Andalusia, the\r\ngarden of Old Spain.  The experiences of that cheery week were too varied\r\nand numerous for a short chapter and I have not room for a long one.\r\nTherefore I shall leave them all out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nTen or eleven o'clock found us coming down to breakfast one morning in\r\nCadiz.  They told us the ship had been lying at anchor in the harbor two\r\nor three hours.  It was time for us to bestir ourselves.  The ship could\r\nwait only a little while because of the quarantine.  We were soon on\r\nboard, and within the hour the white city and the pleasant shores of\r\nSpain sank down behind the waves and passed out of sight.  We had seen no\r\nland fade from view so regretfully.\r\n\r\nIt had long ago been decided in a noisy public meeting in the main cabin\r\nthat we could not go to Lisbon, because we must surely be quarantined\r\nthere.  We did every thing by mass-meeting, in the good old national way,\r\nfrom swapping off one empire for another on the programme of the voyage\r\ndown to complaining of the cookery and the scarcity of napkins.  I am\r\nreminded, now, of one of these complaints of the cookery made by a\r\npassenger.  The coffee had been steadily growing more and more execrable\r\nfor the space of three weeks, till at last it had ceased to be coffee\r\naltogether and had assumed the nature of mere discolored water--so this\r\nperson said.  He said it was so weak that it was transparent an inch in\r\ndepth around the edge of the cup.  As he approached the table one morning\r\nhe saw the transparent edge--by means of his extraordinary vision long\r\nbefore he got to his seat.  He went back and complained in a high-handed\r\nway to Capt.  Duncan.  He said the coffee was disgraceful.  The Captain\r\nshowed his.  It seemed tolerably good.  The incipient mutineer was more\r\noutraged than ever, then, at what he denounced as the partiality shown\r\nthe captain's table over the other tables in the ship.  He flourished\r\nback and got his cup and set it down triumphantly, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust try that mixture once, Captain Duncan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smelt it--tasted it--smiled benignantly--then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is inferior--for coffee--but it is pretty fair tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe humbled mutineer smelt it, tasted it, and returned to his seat.  He\r\nhad made an egregious ass of himself before the whole ship.  He did it no\r\nmore.  After that he took things as they came.  That was me.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned ship-life had returned, now that we were no longer in\r\nsight of land.  For days and days it continued just the same, one day\r\nbeing exactly like another, and, to me, every one of them pleasant.  At\r\nlast we anchored in the open roadstead of Funchal, in the beautiful\r\nislands we call the Madeiras.\r\n\r\nThe mountains looked surpassingly lovely, clad as they were in living,\r\ngreen; ribbed with lava ridges; flecked with white cottages; riven by\r\ndeep chasms purple with shade; the great slopes dashed with sunshine and\r\nmottled with shadows flung from the drifting squadrons of the sky, and\r\nthe superb picture fitly crowned by towering peaks whose fronts were\r\nswept by the trailing fringes of the clouds.\r\n\r\nBut we could not land.  We staid all day and looked, we abused the man\r\nwho invented quarantine, we held half a dozen mass-meetings and crammed\r\nthem full of interrupted speeches, motions that fell still-born,\r\namendments that came to nought and resolutions that died from sheer\r\nexhaustion in trying to get before the house.  At night we set sail.\r\n\r\nWe averaged four mass-meetings a week for the voyage--we seemed always in\r\nlabor in this way, and yet so often fallaciously that whenever at long\r\nintervals we were safely delivered of a resolution, it was cause for\r\npublic rejoicing, and we hoisted the flag and fired a salute.\r\n\r\nDays passed--and nights; and then the beautiful Bermudas rose out of the\r\nsea, we entered the tortuous channel, steamed hither and thither among\r\nthe bright summer islands, and rested at last under the flag of England\r\nand were welcome.  We were not a nightmare here, where were civilization\r\nand intelligence in place of Spanish and Italian superstition, dirt and\r\ndread of cholera.  A few days among the breezy groves, the flower\r\ngardens, the coral caves, and the lovely vistas of blue water that went\r\ncurving in and out, disappearing and anon again appearing through jungle\r\nwalls of brilliant foliage, restored the energies dulled by long drowsing\r\non the ocean, and fitted us for our final cruise--our little run of a\r\nthousand miles to New York--America--HOME.\r\n\r\nWe bade good-bye to \xe2\x80\x9cour friends the Bermudians,\xe2\x80\x9d as our programme hath\r\nit--the majority of those we were most intimate with were negroes--and\r\ncourted the great deep again.  I said the majority.  We knew more negroes\r\nthan white people, because we had a deal of washing to be done, but we\r\nmade some most excellent friends among the whites, whom it will be a\r\npleasant duty to hold long in grateful remembrance.\r\n\r\nWe sailed, and from that hour all idling ceased.  Such another system of\r\noverhauling, general littering of cabins and packing of trunks we had not\r\nseen since we let go the anchor in the harbor of Beirout.  Every body was\r\nbusy.  Lists of all purchases had to be made out, and values attached, to\r\nfacilitate matters at the custom-house.  Purchases bought by bulk in\r\npartnership had to be equitably divided, outstanding debts canceled,\r\naccounts compared, and trunks, boxes and packages labeled.  All day long\r\nthe bustle and confusion continued.\r\n\r\nAnd now came our first accident.  A passenger was running through a\r\ngangway, between decks, one stormy night, when he caught his foot in the\r\niron staple of a door that had been heedlessly left off a hatchway, and\r\nthe bones of his leg broke at the ancle.  It was our first serious\r\nmisfortune.  We had traveled much more than twenty thousand miles, by\r\nland and sea, in many trying climates, without a single hurt, without a\r\nserious case of sickness and without a death among five and sixty\r\npassengers.  Our good fortune had been wonderful.  A sailor had jumped\r\noverboard at Constantinople one night, and was seen no more, but it was\r\nsuspected that his object was to desert, and there was a slim chance, at\r\nleast, that he reached the shore.  But the passenger list was complete.\r\nThere was no name missing from the register.\r\n\r\nAt last, one pleasant morning, we steamed up the harbor of New York, all\r\non deck, all dressed in Christian garb--by special order, for there was a\r\nlatent disposition in some quarters to come out as Turks--and amid a\r\nwaving of handkerchiefs from welcoming friends, the glad pilgrims noted\r\nthe shiver of the decks that told that ship and pier had joined hands\r\nagain and the long, strange cruise was over.  Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\nIn this place I will print an article which I wrote for the New York\r\nHerald the night we arrived.  I do it partly because my contract with my\r\npublishers makes it compulsory; partly because it is a proper, tolerably\r\naccurate, and exhaustive summing up of the cruise of the ship and the\r\nperformances of the pilgrims in foreign lands; and partly because some of\r\nthe passengers have abused me for writing it, and I wish the public to\r\nsee how thankless a task it is to put one's self to trouble to glorify\r\nunappreciative people.  I was charged with \xe2\x80\x9crushing into print\xe2\x80\x9d with\r\nthese compliments.  I did not rush.  I had written news letters to the\r\nHerald sometimes, but yet when I visited the office that day I did not\r\nsay any thing about writing a valedictory.  I did go to the Tribune\r\noffice to see if such an article was wanted, because I belonged on the\r\nregular staff of that paper and it was simply a duty to do it.  The\r\nmanaging editor was absent, and so I thought no more about it.  At night\r\nwhen the Herald's request came for an article, I did not \xe2\x80\x9crush.\xe2\x80\x9d  In\r\nfact, I demurred for a while, because I did not feel like writing\r\ncompliments then, and therefore was afraid to speak of the cruise lest I\r\nmight be betrayed into using other than complimentary language.  However,\r\nI reflected that it would be a just and righteous thing to go down and\r\nwrite a kind word for the Hadjis--Hadjis are people who have made the\r\npilgrimage--because parties not interested could not do it so feelingly\r\nas I, a fellow-Hadji, and so I penned the valedictory.  I have read it,\r\nand read it again; and if there is a sentence in it that is not fulsomely\r\ncomplimentary to captain, ship and passengers, I can not find it.  If it\r\nis not a chapter that any company might be proud to have a body write\r\nabout them, my judgment is fit for nothing.  With these remarks I\r\nconfidently submit it to the unprejudiced judgment of the reader:\r\n\r\n     RETURN OF THE HOLY LAND EXCURSIONISTS--THE STORY OF THE CRUISE.\r\n\r\n     TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD:\r\n\r\n     The steamer __Quaker City__ has accomplished at last her extraordinary\r\n     voyage and returned to her old pier at the foot of Wall street.\r\n     The expedition was a success in some respects, in some it was not.\r\n     Originally it was advertised as a \xe2\x80\x9cpleasure excursion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Well,\r\n     perhaps, it was a pleasure excursion, but certainly it did not look\r\n     like one; certainly it did not act like one.  Any body's and every\r\n     body's notion of a pleasure excursion is that the parties to it will\r\n     of a necessity be young and giddy and somewhat boisterous.  They\r\n     will dance a good deal, sing a good deal, make love, but sermonize\r\n     very little.  Any body's and every body's notion of a well conducted\r\n     funeral is that there must be a hearse and a corpse, and chief\r\n     mourners and mourners by courtesy, many old people, much solemnity,\r\n     no levity, and a prayer and a sermon withal.  Three-fourths of the\r\n     __Quaker City__'s passengers were between forty and seventy years of\r\n     age!  There was a picnic crowd for you!  It may be supposed that the\r\n     other fourth was composed of young girls.  But it was not.  It was\r\n     chiefly composed of rusty old bachelors and a child of six years.\r\n     Let us average the ages of the __Quaker City__'s pilgrims and set the\r\n     figure down as fifty years.  Is any man insane enough to imagine\r\n     that this picnic of patriarchs sang, made love, danced, laughed,\r\n     told anecdotes, dealt in ungodly levity?  In my experience they\r\n     sinned little in these matters.  No doubt it was presumed here at\r\n     home that these frolicsome veterans laughed and sang and romped all\r\n     day, and day after day, and kept up a noisy excitement from one end\r\n     of the ship to the other; and that they played blind-man's buff or\r\n     danced quadrilles and waltzes on moonlight evenings on the\r\n     quarter-deck; and that at odd moments of unoccupied time they jotted\r\n     a laconic item or two in the journals they opened on such an\r\n     elaborate plan when they left home, and then skurried off to their\r\n     whist and euchre labors under the cabin lamps.  If these things were\r\n     presumed, the presumption was at fault.  The venerable excursionists\r\n     were not gay and frisky.  They played no blind-man's buff; they\r\n     dealt not in whist; they shirked not the irksome journal, for alas!\r\n     most of them were even writing books.  They never romped, they\r\n     talked but little, they never sang, save in the nightly\r\n     prayer-meeting.  The pleasure ship was a synagogue, and the pleasure\r\n     trip was a funeral excursion without a corpse.  (There is nothing\r\n     exhilarating about a funeral excursion without a corpse.) A free,\r\n     hearty laugh was a sound that was not heard oftener than once in\r\n     seven days about those decks or in those cabins, and when it was\r\n     heard it met with precious little sympathy.  The excursionists\r\n     danced, on three separate evenings, long, long ago, (it seems an\r\n     age.) quadrilles, of a single set, made up of three ladies and five\r\n     gentlemen, (the latter with handkerchiefs around their arms to\r\n     signify their sex.) who timed their feet to the solemn wheezing of a\r\n     melodeon; but even this melancholy orgie was voted to be sinful, and\r\n     dancing was discontinued.\r\n\r\n     The pilgrims played dominoes when too much Josephus or Robinson's\r\n     Holy Land Researches, or book-writing, made recreation necessary\r\n     --for dominoes is about as mild and sinless a game as any in the\r\n     world, perhaps, excepting always the ineffably insipid diversion\r\n     they call croquet, which is a game where you don't pocket any balls\r\n     and don't carom on any thing of any consequence, and when you are\r\n     done nobody has to pay, and there are no refreshments to saw off,\r\n     and, consequently, there isn't any satisfaction whatever about it\r\n     --they played dominoes till they were rested, and then they\r\n     blackguarded each other privately till prayer-time.  When they were\r\n     not seasick they were uncommonly prompt when the dinner-gong\r\n     sounded.  Such was our daily life on board the ship--solemnity,\r\n     decorum, dinner, dominoes, devotions, slander.  It was not lively\r\n     enough for a pleasure trip; but if we had only had a corpse it would\r\n     have made a noble funeral excursion.  It is all over now; but when I\r\n     look back, the idea of these venerable fossils skipping forth on a\r\n     six months' picnic, seems exquisitely refreshing.  The advertised\r\n     title of the expedition--\xe2\x80\x9cThe Grand Holy Land Pleasure Excursion\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n      --was a misnomer.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Grand Holy Land Funeral Procession\xe2\x80\x9d would have\r\n     been better--much better.\r\n\r\n     Wherever we went, in Europe, Asia, or Africa, we made a sensation,\r\n     and, I suppose I may add, created a famine.  None of us had ever\r\n     been any where before; we all hailed from the interior; travel was a\r\n     wild novelty to us, and we conducted ourselves in accordance with\r\n     the natural instincts that were in us, and trammeled ourselves with\r\n     no ceremonies, no conventionalities.  We always took care to make it\r\n     understood that we were Americans--Americans!  When we found that a\r\n     good many foreigners had hardly ever heard of America, and that a\r\n     good many more knew it only as a barbarous province away off\r\n     somewhere, that had lately been at war with somebody, we pitied the\r\n     ignorance of the Old World, but abated no jot of our importance.\r\n     Many and many a simple community in the Eastern hemisphere will\r\n     remember for years the incursion of the strange horde in the year of\r\n     our Lord 1867, that called themselves Americans, and seemed to\r\n     imagine in some unaccountable way that they had a right to be proud\r\n     of it.  We generally created a famine, partly because the coffee on\r\n     the __Quaker City__ was unendurable, and sometimes the more substantial\r\n     fare was not strictly first class; and partly because one naturally\r\n     tires of sitting long at the same board and eating from the same\r\n     dishes.\r\n\r\n     The people of those foreign countries are very, very ignorant.  They\r\n     looked curiously at the costumes we had brought from the wilds of\r\n     America.  They observed that we talked loudly at table sometimes.\r\n     They noticed that we looked out for expenses, and got what we\r\n     conveniently could out of a franc, and wondered where in the\r\n     mischief we came from.  In Paris they just simply opened their eyes\r\n     and stared when we spoke to them in French!  We never did succeed in\r\n     making those idiots understand their own language.  One of our\r\n     passengers said to a shopkeeper, in reference to a proposed return\r\n     to buy a pair of gloves, \xe2\x80\x9cAllong restay trankeel--may be ve coom\r\n     Moonday;\xe2\x80\x9d and would you believe it, that shopkeeper, a born\r\n     Frenchman, had to ask what it was that had been said.  Sometimes it\r\n     seems to me, somehow, that there must be a difference between\r\n     Parisian French and __Quaker City__ French.\r\n\r\n     The people stared at us every where, and we stared at them.  We\r\n     generally made them feel rather small, too, before we got done with\r\n     them, because we bore down on them with America's greatness until we\r\n     crushed them.  And yet we took kindly to the manners and customs,\r\n     and especially to the fashions of the various people we visited.\r\n     When we left the Azores, we wore awful capotes and used fine tooth\r\n     combs--successfully.  When we came back from Tangier, in Africa, we\r\n     were topped with fezzes of the bloodiest hue, hung with tassels like\r\n     an Indian's scalp-lock.  In France and Spain we attracted some\r\n     attention in these costumes.  In Italy they naturally took us for\r\n     distempered Garibaldians, and set a gunboat to look for any thing\r\n     significant in our changes of uniform.  We made Rome howl.  We could\r\n     have made any place howl when we had all our clothes on.  We got no\r\n     fresh raiment in Greece--they had but little there of any kind.  But\r\n     at Constantinople, how we turned out!  Turbans, scimetars, fezzes,\r\n     horse-pistols, tunics, sashes, baggy trowsers, yellow slippers--Oh,\r\n     we were gorgeous!  The illustrious dogs of Constantinople barked\r\n     their under jaws off, and even then failed to do us justice.  They\r\n     are all dead by this time.  They could not go through such a run of\r\n     business as we gave them and survive.\r\n\r\n     And then we went to see the Emperor of Russia.  We just called on\r\n     him as comfortably as if we had known him a century or so, and when\r\n     we had finished our visit we variegated ourselves with selections\r\n     from Russian costumes and sailed away again more picturesque than\r\n     ever.  In Smyrna we picked up camel's hair shawls and other dressy\r\n     things from Persia; but in Palestine--ah, in Palestine--our splendid\r\n     career ended.  They didn't wear any clothes there to speak of.  We\r\n     were satisfied, and stopped.  We made no experiments.  We did not\r\n     try their costume.  But we astonished the natives of that country.\r\n     We astonished them with such eccentricities of dress as we could\r\n     muster.  We prowled through the Holy Land, from Cesarea Philippi to\r\n     Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, a weird procession of pilgrims, gotten\r\n     up regardless of expense, solemn, gorgeous, green-spectacled,\r\n     drowsing under blue umbrellas, and astride of a sorrier lot of\r\n     horses, camels and asses than those that came out of Noah's ark,\r\n     after eleven months of seasickness and short rations.  If ever those\r\n     children of Israel in Palestine forget when Gideon's Band went\r\n     through there from America, they ought to be cursed once more and\r\n     finished.  It was the rarest spectacle that ever astounded mortal\r\n     eyes, perhaps.\r\n\r\n     Well, we were at home in Palestine.  It was easy to see that that\r\n     was the grand feature of the expedition.  We had cared nothing much\r\n     about Europe.  We galloped through the Louvre, the Pitti, the\r\n     Ufizzi, the Vatican--all the galleries--and through the pictured and\r\n     frescoed churches of Venice, Naples, and the cathedrals of Spain;\r\n     some of us said that certain of the great works of the old masters\r\n     were glorious creations of genius, (we found it out in the\r\n     guide-book, though we got hold of the wrong picture sometimes,) and\r\n     the others said they were disgraceful old daubs.  We examined modern\r\n     and ancient statuary with a critical eye in Florence, Rome, or any\r\n     where we found it, and praised it if we saw fit, and if we didn't we\r\n     said we preferred the wooden Indians in front of the cigar stores of\r\n     America.  But the Holy Land brought out all our enthusiasm.  We fell\r\n     into raptures by the barren shores of Galilee; we pondered at Tabor\r\n     and at Nazareth; we exploded into poetry over the questionable\r\n     loveliness of Esdraelon; we meditated at Jezreel and Samaria over\r\n     the missionary zeal of Jehu; we rioted--fairly rioted among the holy\r\n     places of Jerusalem; we bathed in Jordan and the Dead Sea, reckless\r\n     whether our accident-insurance policies were extra-hazardous or not,\r\n     and brought away so many jugs of precious water from both places\r\n     that all the country from Jericho to the mountains of Moab will\r\n     suffer from drouth this year, I think.  Yet, the pilgrimage part of\r\n     the excursion was its pet feature--there is no question about that.\r\n     After dismal, smileless Palestine, beautiful Egypt had few charms\r\n     for us.  We merely glanced at it and were ready for home.\r\n\r\n     They wouldn't let us land at Malta--quarantine; they would not let\r\n     us land in Sardinia; nor at Algiers, Africa; nor at Malaga, Spain,\r\n     nor Cadiz, nor at the Madeira islands.  So we got offended at all\r\n     foreigners and turned our backs upon them and came home.  I suppose\r\n     we only stopped at the Bermudas because they were in the programme.\r\n     We did not care any thing about any place at all.  We wanted to go\r\n     home.  Homesickness was abroad in the ship--it was epidemic.  If the\r\n     authorities of New York had known how badly we had it, they would\r\n     have quarantined us here.\r\n\r\n     The grand pilgrimage is over.  Good-bye to it, and a pleasant memory\r\n     to it, I am able to say in all kindness.  I bear no malice, no\r\n     ill-will toward any individual that was connected with it, either as\r\n     passenger or officer.  Things I did not like at all yesterday I like\r\n     very well to-day, now that I am at home, and always hereafter I\r\n     shall be able to poke fun at the whole gang if the spirit so moves\r\n     me to do, without ever saying a malicious word.  The expedition\r\n     accomplished all that its programme promised that it should\r\n     accomplish, and we ought all to be satisfied with the management of\r\n     the matter, certainly.  Bye-bye!\r\n\r\n                                             MARK TWAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI call that complimentary.  It is complimentary; and yet I never have\r\nreceived a word of thanks for it from the Hadjis; on the contrary I speak\r\nnothing but the serious truth when I say that many of them even took\r\nexceptions to the article.  In endeavoring to please them I slaved over\r\nthat sketch for two hours, and had my labor for my pains.  I never will\r\ndo a generous deed again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nNearly one year has flown since this notable pilgrimage was ended; and as\r\nI sit here at home in San Francisco thinking, I am moved to confess that\r\nday by day the mass of my memories of the excursion have grown more and\r\nmore pleasant as the disagreeable incidents of travel which encumbered\r\nthem flitted one by one out of my mind--and now, if the __Quaker City__ were\r\nweighing her anchor to sail away on the very same cruise again, nothing\r\ncould gratify me more than to be a passenger.  With the same captain and\r\neven the same pilgrims, the same sinners.  I was on excellent terms with\r\neight or nine of the excursionists (they are my staunch friends yet,) and\r\nwas even on speaking terms with the rest of the sixty-five.  I have been\r\nat sea quite enough to know that that was a very good average.  Because a\r\nlong sea-voyage not only brings out all the mean traits one has, and\r\nexaggerates them, but raises up others which he never suspected he\r\npossessed, and even creates new ones.  A twelve months' voyage at sea\r\nwould make of an ordinary man a very miracle of meanness.  On the other\r\nhand, if a man has good qualities, the spirit seldom moves him to exhibit\r\nthem on shipboard, at least with any sort of emphasis.  Now I am\r\nsatisfied that our pilgrims are pleasant old people on shore; I am also\r\nsatisfied that at sea on a second voyage they would be pleasanter,\r\nsomewhat, than they were on our grand excursion, and so I say without\r\nhesitation that I would be glad enough to sail with them again.  I could\r\nat least enjoy life with my handful of old friends.  They could enjoy\r\nlife with their cliques as well--passengers invariably divide up into\r\ncliques, on all ships.\r\n\r\nAnd I will say, here, that I would rather travel with an excursion party\r\nof Methuselahs than have to be changing ships and comrades constantly, as\r\npeople do who travel in the ordinary way.  Those latter are always\r\ngrieving over some other ship they have known and lost, and over other\r\ncomrades whom diverging routes have separated from them.  They learn to\r\nlove a ship just in time to change it for another, and they become\r\nattached to a pleasant traveling companion only to lose him.  They have\r\nthat most dismal experience of being in a strange vessel, among strange\r\npeople who care nothing about them, and of undergoing the customary\r\nbullying by strange officers and the insolence of strange servants,\r\nrepeated over and over again within the compass of every month.  They\r\nhave also that other misery of packing and unpacking trunks--of running\r\nthe distressing gauntlet of custom-houses--of the anxieties attendant\r\nupon getting a mass of baggage from point to point on land in safety.\r\nI had rasher sail with a whole brigade of patriarchs than suffer so.\r\nWe never packed our trunks but twice--when we sailed from New York, and\r\nwhen we returned to it.  Whenever we made a land journey, we estimated\r\nhow many days we should be gone and what amount of clothing we should\r\nneed, figured it down to a mathematical nicety, packed a valise or two\r\naccordingly, and left the trunks on board.  We chose our comrades from\r\namong our old, tried friends, and started.  We were never dependent upon\r\nstrangers for companionship.  We often had occasion to pity Americans\r\nwhom we found traveling drearily among strangers with no friends to\r\nexchange pains and pleasures with.  Whenever we were coming back from a\r\nland journey, our eyes sought one thing in the distance first--the ship\r\n--and when we saw it riding at anchor with the flag apeak, we felt as a\r\nreturning wanderer feels when he sees his home.  When we stepped on\r\nboard, our cares vanished, our troubles were at an end--for the ship was\r\nhome to us.  We always had the same familiar old state-room to go to, and\r\nfeel safe and at peace and comfortable again.\r\n\r\nI have no fault to find with the manner in which our excursion was\r\nconducted.  Its programme was faithfully carried out--a thing which\r\nsurprised me, for great enterprises usually promise vastly more than they\r\nperform.  It would be well if such an excursion could be gotten up every\r\nyear and the system regularly inaugurated.  Travel is fatal to prejudice,\r\nbigotry and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on\r\nthese accounts.  Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things can\r\nnot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's\r\nlifetime.\r\n\r\nThe Excursion is ended, and has passed to its place among the things that\r\nwere.  But its varied scenes and its manifold incidents will linger\r\npleasantly in our memories for many a year to come.  Always on the wing,\r\nas we were, and merely pausing a moment to catch fitful glimpses of the\r\nwonders of half a world, we could not hope to receive or retain vivid\r\nimpressions of all it was our fortune to see.  Yet our holyday flight has\r\nnot been in vain--for above the confusion of vague recollections, certain\r\nof its best prized pictures lift themselves and will still continue\r\nperfect in tint and outline after their surroundings shall have faded\r\naway.\r\n\r\nWe shall remember something of pleasant France; and something also of\r\nParis, though it flashed upon us a splendid meteor, and was gone again,\r\nwe hardly knew how or where.  We shall remember, always, how we saw\r\nmajestic Gibraltar glorified with the rich coloring of a Spanish sunset\r\nand swimming in a sea of rainbows.  In fancy we shall see Milan again,\r\nand her stately Cathedral with its marble wilderness of graceful spires.\r\nAnd Padua--Verona--Como, jeweled with stars; and patrician Venice, afloat\r\non her stagnant flood--silent, desolate, haughty--scornful of her humbled\r\nstate--wrapping herself in memories of her lost fleets, of battle and\r\ntriumph, and all the pageantry of a glory that is departed.\r\n\r\nWe can not forget Florence--Naples--nor the foretaste of heaven that is\r\nin the delicious atmosphere of Greece--and surely not Athens and the\r\nbroken temples of the Acropolis.  Surely not venerable Rome--nor the\r\ngreen plain that compasses her round about, contrasting its brightness\r\nwith her gray decay--nor the ruined arches that stand apart in the plain\r\nand clothe their looped and windowed raggedness with vines.  We shall\r\nremember St. Peter's: not as one sees it when he walks the streets of\r\nRome and fancies all her domes are just alike, but as he sees it leagues\r\naway, when every meaner edifice has faded out of sight and that one dome\r\nlooms superbly up in the flush of sunset, full of dignity and grace,\r\nstrongly outlined as a mountain.\r\n\r\nWe shall remember Constantinople and the Bosporus--the colossal\r\nmagnificence of Baalbec--the Pyramids of Egypt--the prodigious form, the\r\nbenignant countenance of the Sphynx--Oriental Smyrna--sacred Jerusalem\r\n--Damascus, the \xe2\x80\x9cPearl of the East,\xe2\x80\x9d the pride of Syria, the fabled Garden\r\nof Eden, the home of princes and genii of the Arabian Nights, the oldest\r\nmetropolis on earth, the one city in all the world that has kept its name\r\nand held its place and looked serenely on while the Kingdoms and Empires\r\nof four thousand years have risen to life, enjoyed their little season of\r\npride and pomp, and then vanished and been forgotten!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Innocents Abroad\r\nby Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE INNOCENTS ABROAD ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 3176-0.txt or 3176-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/3/1/7/3176/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n"
