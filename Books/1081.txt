Obtained government post at St. Petersburg and later an\r\nappointment at the university. Lived in Rome from 1836 to 1848. Died on\r\n21st February 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARER\'S NOTE\r\n\r\nThe book this was typed from contains a complete Part I, and a partial\r\nPart II, as it seems only part of Part II survived the adventures\r\ndescribed in the introduction. Where the text notes that pages are\r\nmissing from the "original", this refers to the Russian original, not\r\nthe translation.\r\n\r\nAll the foreign words were italicised in the original, a style not\r\npreserved here. Accents and diphthongs have also been left out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nDead Souls, first published in 1842, is the great prose classic of\r\nRussia. That amazing institution, "the Russian novel," not only began\r\nits career with this unfinished masterpiece by Nikolai Vasil\'evich\r\nGogol, but practically all the Russian masterpieces that have come since\r\nhave grown out of it, like the limbs of a single tree. Dostoieffsky\r\ngoes so far as to bestow this tribute upon an earlier work by the same\r\nauthor, a short story entitled The Cloak; this idea has been wittily\r\nexpressed by another compatriot, who says: "We have all issued out of\r\nGogol\'s Cloak."\r\n\r\nDead Souls, which bears the word "Poem" upon the title page of the\r\noriginal, has been generally compared to Don Quixote and to the Pickwick\r\nPapers, while E. M. Vogue places its author somewhere between Cervantes\r\nand Le Sage. However considerable the influences of Cervantes and\r\nDickens may have been--the first in the matter of structure, the other\r\nin background, humour, and detail of characterisation--the predominating\r\nand distinguishing quality of the work is undeniably something foreign\r\nto both and quite peculiar to itself; something which, for want of\r\na better term, might be called the quality of the Russian soul. The\r\nEnglish reader familiar with the works of Dostoieffsky, Turgenev, and\r\nTolstoi, need hardly be told what this implies; it might be defined in\r\nthe words of the French critic just named as "a tendency to pity." One\r\nmight indeed go further and say that it implies a certain tolerance of\r\none\'s characters even though they be, in the conventional sense, knaves,\r\nproducts, as the case might be, of conditions or circumstance, which\r\nafter all is the thing to be criticised and not the man. But pity and\r\ntolerance are rare in satire, even in clash with it, producing in the\r\nresult a deep sense of tragic humour. It is this that makes of Dead\r\nSouls a unique work, peculiarly Gogolian, peculiarly Russian, and\r\ndistinct from its author\'s Spanish and English masters.\r\n\r\nStill more profound are the contradictions to be seen in the author\'s\r\npersonal character; and unfortunately they prevented him from completing\r\nhis work. The trouble is that he made his art out of life, and when in\r\nhis final years he carried his struggle, as Tolstoi did later, back into\r\nlife, he repented of all he had written, and in the frenzy of a wakeful\r\nnight burned all his manuscripts, including the second part of Dead\r\nSouls, only fragments of which were saved. There was yet a third part to\r\nbe written. Indeed, the second part had been written and burned twice.\r\nAccounts differ as to why he had burned it finally. Religious remorse,\r\nfury at adverse criticism, and despair at not reaching ideal perfection\r\nare among the reasons given. Again it is said that he had destroyed the\r\nmanuscript with the others inadvertently.\r\n\r\nThe poet Pushkin, who said of Gogol that "behind his laughter you feel\r\nthe unseen tears," was his chief friend and inspirer. It was he who\r\nsuggested the plot of Dead Souls as well as the plot of the earlier work\r\nThe Revisor, which is almost the only comedy in Russian. The importance\r\nof both is their introduction of the social element in Russian\r\nliterature, as Prince Kropotkin points out. Both hold up the mirror\r\nto Russian officialdom and the effects it has produced on the national\r\ncharacter. The plot of Dead Souls is simple enough, and is said to have\r\nbeen suggested by an actual episode.\r\n\r\nIt was the day of serfdom in Russia, and a man\'s standing was often\r\njudged by the numbers of "souls" he possessed. There was a periodical\r\ncensus of serfs, say once every ten or twenty years. This being the\r\ncase, an owner had to pay a tax on every "soul" registered at the\r\nlast census, though some of the serfs might have died in the meantime.\r\nNevertheless, the system had its material advantages, inasmuch as an\r\nowner might borrow money from a bank on the "dead souls" no less than\r\non the living ones. The plan of Chichikov, Gogol\'s hero-villain, was\r\ntherefore to make a journey through Russia and buy up the "dead souls,"\r\nat reduced rates of course, saving their owners the government tax,\r\nand acquiring for himself a list of fictitious serfs, which he meant to\r\nmortgage to a bank for a considerable sum. With this money he would buy\r\nan estate and some real life serfs, and make the beginning of a fortune.\r\n\r\nObviously, this plot, which is really no plot at all but merely a ruse\r\nto enable Chichikov to go across Russia in a troika, with Selifan the\r\ncoachman as a sort of Russian Sancho Panza, gives Gogol a magnificent\r\nopportunity to reveal his genius as a painter of Russian panorama,\r\npeopled with characteristic native types commonplace enough but drawn in\r\ncomic relief. "The comic," explained the author yet at the beginning of\r\nhis career, "is hidden everywhere, only living in the midst of it we are\r\nnot conscious of it; but if the artist brings it into his art, on the\r\nstage say, we shall roll about with laughter and only wonder we did not\r\nnotice it before." But the comic in Dead Souls is merely external. Let\r\nus see how Pushkin, who loved to laugh, regarded the work. As Gogol read\r\nit aloud to him from the manuscript the poet grew more and more gloomy\r\nand at last cried out: "God! What a sad country Russia is!" And later he\r\nsaid of it: "Gogol invents nothing; it is the simple truth, the terrible\r\ntruth."\r\n\r\nThe work on one hand was received as nothing less than an exposure of\r\nall Russia--what would foreigners think of it? The liberal elements,\r\nhowever, the critical Belinsky among them, welcomed it as a revelation,\r\nas an omen of a freer future. Gogol, who had meant to do a service to\r\nRussia and not to heap ridicule upon her, took the criticisms of the\r\nSlavophiles to heart; and he palliated his critics by promising to bring\r\nabout in the succeeding parts of his novel the redemption of Chichikov\r\nand the other "knaves and blockheads." But the "Westerner" Belinsky\r\nand others of the liberal camp were mistrustful. It was about this time\r\n(1847) that Gogol published his Correspondence with Friends, and aroused\r\na literary controversy that is alive to this day. Tolstoi is to be found\r\namong his apologists.\r\n\r\nOpinions as to the actual significance of Gogol\'s masterpiece differ.\r\nSome consider the author a realist who has drawn with meticulous detail\r\na picture of Russia; others, Merejkovsky among them, see in him a great\r\nsymbolist; the very title Dead Souls is taken to describe the living of\r\nRussia as well as its dead. Chichikov himself is now generally regarded\r\nas a universal character. We find an American professor, William Lyon\r\nPhelps [1], of Yale, holding the opinion that "no one can travel far in\r\nAmerica without meeting scores of Chichikovs; indeed, he is an accurate\r\nportrait of the American promoter, of the successful commercial\r\ntraveller whose success depends entirely not on the real value and\r\nusefulness of his stock-in-trade, but on his knowledge of human nature\r\nand of the persuasive power of his tongue." This is also the opinion\r\nheld by Prince Kropotkin [2], who says: "Chichikov may buy dead\r\nsouls, or railway shares, or he may collect funds for some charitable\r\ninstitution, or look for a position in a bank, but he is an immortal\r\ninternational type; we meet him everywhere; he is of all lands and of\r\nall times; he but takes different forms to suit the requirements of\r\nnationality and time."\r\n\r\nAgain, the work bears an interesting relation to Gogol himself. A\r\nromantic, writing of realities, he was appalled at the commonplaces\r\nof life, at finding no outlet for his love of colour derived from his\r\nCossack ancestry. He realised that he had drawn a host of "heroes," "one\r\nmore commonplace than another, that there was not a single palliating\r\ncircumstance, that there was not a single place where the reader might\r\nfind pause to rest and to console himself, and that when he had finished\r\nthe book it was as though he had walked out of an oppressive cellar\r\ninto the open air." He felt perhaps inward need to redeem Chichikov;\r\nin Merejkovsky\'s opinion he really wanted to save his own soul, but\r\nhad succeeded only in losing it. His last years were spent morbidly;\r\nhe suffered torments and ran from place to place like one hunted; but\r\nreally always running from himself. Rome was his favourite refuge, and\r\nhe returned to it again and again. In 1848, he made a pilgrimage to the\r\nHoly Land, but he could find no peace for his soul. Something of this\r\nmood had reflected itself even much earlier in the Memoirs of a Madman:\r\n"Oh, little mother, save your poor son! Look how they are tormenting\r\nhim.... There\'s no place for him on earth! He\'s being driven!... Oh,\r\nlittle mother, take pity on thy poor child."\r\n\r\nAll the contradictions of Gogol\'s character are not to be disposed of\r\nin a brief essay. Such a strange combination of the tragic and the comic\r\nwas truly seldom seen in one man. He, for one, realised that "it is\r\ndangerous to jest with laughter." "Everything that I laughed at became\r\nsad." "And terrible," adds Merejkovsky. But earlier his humour was\r\nlighter, less tinged with the tragic; in those days Pushkin never failed\r\nto be amused by what Gogol had brought to read to him. Even Revizor\r\n(1835), with its tragic undercurrent, was a trifle compared to Dead\r\nSouls, so that one is not astonished to hear that not only did the Tsar,\r\nNicholas I, give permission to have it acted, in spite of its being a\r\ncriticism of official rottenness, but laughed uproariously, and led the\r\napplause. Moreover, he gave Gogol a grant of money, and asked that its\r\nsource should not be revealed to the author lest "he might feel obliged\r\nto write from the official point of view."\r\n\r\nGogol was born at Sorotchinetz, Little Russia, in March 1809. He left\r\ncollege at nineteen and went to St. Petersburg, where he secured a\r\nposition as copying clerk in a government department. He did not keep\r\nhis position long, yet long enough to store away in his mind a number of\r\nbureaucratic types which proved useful later. He quite suddenly started\r\nfor America with money given to him by his mother for another purpose,\r\nbut when he got as far as Lubeck he turned back. He then wanted to\r\nbecome an actor, but his voice proved not strong enough. Later he wrote\r\na poem which was unkindly received. As the copies remained unsold, he\r\ngathered them all up at the various shops and burned them in his room.\r\n\r\nHis next effort, Evenings at the Farm of Dikanka (1831) was more\r\nsuccessful. It was a series of gay and colourful pictures of Ukraine,\r\nthe land he knew and loved, and if he is occasionally a little over\r\nromantic here and there, he also achieves some beautifully lyrical\r\npassages. Then came another even finer series called Mirgorod, which won\r\nthe admiration of Pushkin. Next he planned a "History of Little Russia"\r\nand a "History of the Middle Ages," this last work to be in eight or\r\nnine volumes. The result of all this study was a beautiful and short\r\nHomeric epic in prose, called Taras Bulba. His appointment to a\r\nprofessorship in history was a ridiculous episode in his life. After a\r\nbrilliant first lecture, in which he had evidently said all he had to\r\nsay, he settled to a life of boredom for himself and his pupils. When he\r\nresigned he said joyously: "I am once more a free Cossack." Between\r\n1834 and 1835 he produced a new series of stories, including his famous\r\nCloak, which may be regarded as the legitimate beginning of the Russian\r\nnovel.\r\n\r\nGogol knew little about women, who played an equally minor role in\r\nhis life and in his books. This may be partly because his personal\r\nappearance was not prepossessing. He is described by a contemporary as\r\n"a little man with legs too short for his body. He walked crookedly; he\r\nwas clumsy, ill-dressed, and rather ridiculous-looking, with his long\r\nlock of hair flapping on his forehead, and his large prominent nose."\r\n\r\nFrom 1835 Gogol spent almost his entire time abroad; some strange\r\nunrest--possibly his Cossack blood--possessed him like a demon, and\r\nhe never stopped anywhere very long. After his pilgrimage in 1848 to\r\nJerusalem, he returned to Moscow, his entire possessions in a little\r\nbag; these consisted of pamphlets, critiques, and newspaper articles\r\nmostly inimical to himself. He wandered about with these from house to\r\nhouse. Everything he had of value he gave away to the poor. He ceased\r\nwork entirely. According to all accounts he spent his last days in\r\npraying and fasting. Visions came to him. His death, which came in 1852,\r\nwas extremely fantastic. His last words, uttered in a loud frenzy,\r\nwere: "A ladder! Quick, a ladder!" This call for a ladder--"a spiritual\r\nladder," in the words of Merejkovsky--had been made on an earlier\r\noccasion by a certain Russian saint, who used almost the same language.\r\n"I shall laugh my bitter laugh" [3] was the inscription placed on\r\nGogol\'s grave.\r\n\r\n                                                          JOHN COURNOS\r\n\r\n\r\nEvenings on the Farm near the Dikanka, 1829-31; Mirgorod, 1831-33; Taras\r\nBulba, 1834; Arabesques (includes tales, The Portrait and A Madman\'s\r\nDiary), 1831-35; The Cloak, 1835; The Revizor (The Inspector-General),\r\n1836; Dead Souls, 1842; Correspondence with Friends, 1847.\r\n\r\nENGLISH TRANSLATIONS: Cossack Tales (The Night of Christmas Eve, Tarass\r\nBoolba), trans. by G.

This man travels about the Russian land and\r\nmeets with folk of every condition--from the nobly-born to the humble\r\ntoiler. Him I have taken as a type to show forth the vices and the\r\nfailings, rather than the merits and the virtues, of the commonplace\r\nRussian individual; and the characters which revolve around him have\r\nalso been selected for the purpose of demonstrating our national\r\nweaknesses and shortcomings. As for men and women of the better sort, I\r\npropose to portray them in subsequent volumes. Probably much of what I\r\nhave described is improbable and does not happen as things customarily\r\nhappen in Russia; and the reason for that is that for me to learn all\r\nthat I have wished to do has been impossible, in that human life is not\r\nsufficiently long to become acquainted with even a hundredth part\r\nof what takes place within the borders of the Russian Empire. Also,\r\ncarelessness, inexperience, and lack of time have led to my perpetrating\r\nnumerous errors and inaccuracies of detail; with the result that in\r\nevery line of the book there is something which calls for correction.\r\nFor these reasons I beg of you, my reader, to act also as my corrector.\r\nDo not despise the task, for, however superior be your education, and\r\nhowever lofty your station, and however insignificant, in your eyes,\r\nmy book, and however trifling the apparent labour of correcting and\r\ncommenting upon that book, I implore you to do as I have said. And you\r\ntoo, O reader of lowly education and simple status, I beseech you not to\r\nlook upon yourself as too ignorant to be able in some fashion, however\r\nsmall, to help me. Every man who has lived in the world and mixed with\r\nhis fellow men will have remarked something which has remained hidden\r\nfrom the eyes of others; and therefore I beg of you not to deprive me\r\nof your comments, seeing that it cannot be that, should you read my book\r\nwith attention, you will have NOTHING to say at some point therein.\r\n\r\nFor example, how excellent it would be if some reader who is\r\nsufficiently rich in experience and the knowledge of life to be\r\nacquainted with the sort of characters which I have described herein\r\nwould annotate in detail the book, without missing a single page, and\r\nundertake to read it precisely as though, laying pen and paper before\r\nhim, he were first to peruse a few pages of the work, and then to recall\r\nhis own life, and the lives of folk with whom he has come in contact,\r\nand everything which he has seen with his own eyes or has heard of from\r\nothers, and to proceed to annotate, in so far as may tally with his own\r\nexperience or otherwise, what is set forth in the book, and to jot down\r\nthe whole exactly as it stands pictured to his memory, and, lastly, to\r\nsend me the jottings as they may issue from his pen, and to continue\r\ndoing so until he has covered the entire work! Yes, he would indeed do\r\nme a vital service! Of style or beauty of expression he would need\r\nto take no account, for the value of a book lies in its truth and its\r\nactuality rather than in its wording. Nor would he need to consider my\r\nfeelings if at any point he should feel minded to blame or to upbraid\r\nme, or to demonstrate the harm rather than the good which has been\r\ndone through any lack of thought or verisimilitude of which I have\r\nbeen guilty. In short, for anything and for everything in the way of\r\ncriticism I should be thankful.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be an excellent thing if some reader in the higher walks\r\nof life, some person who stands remote, both by life and by education,\r\nfrom the circle of folk which I have pictured in my book, but who knows\r\nthe life of the circle in which he himself revolves, would undertake to\r\nread my work in similar fashion, and methodically to recall to his mind\r\nany members of superior social classes whom he has met, and carefully to\r\nobserve whether there exists any resemblance between one such class and\r\nanother, and whether, at times, there may not be repeated in a higher\r\nsphere what is done in a lower, and likewise to note any additional fact\r\nin the same connection which may occur to him (that is to say, any fact\r\npertaining to the higher ranks of society which would seem to confirm or\r\nto disprove his conclusions), and, lastly, to record that fact as it may\r\nhave occurred within his own experience, while giving full details of\r\npersons (of individual manners, tendencies, and customs) and also of\r\ninanimate surroundings (of dress, furniture, fittings of houses, and so\r\nforth). For I need knowledge of the classes in question, which are the\r\nflower of our people. In fact, this very reason--the reason that I do\r\nnot yet know Russian life in all its aspects, and in the degree to\r\nwhich it is necessary for me to know it in order to become a successful\r\nauthor--is what has, until now, prevented me from publishing any\r\nsubsequent volumes of this story.\r\n\r\nAgain, it would be an excellent thing if some one who is endowed with\r\nthe faculty of imagining and vividly picturing to himself the various\r\nsituations wherein a character may be placed, and of mentally following\r\nup a character\'s career in one field and another--by this I mean some\r\none who possesses the power of entering into and developing the ideas\r\nof the author whose work he may be reading--would scan each character\r\nherein portrayed, and tell me how each character ought to have acted\r\nat a given juncture, and what, to judge from the beginnings of each\r\ncharacter, ought to have become of that character later, and what new\r\ncircumstances might be devised in connection therewith, and what new\r\ndetails might advantageously be added to those already described.\r\nHonestly can I say that to consider these points against the time when a\r\nnew edition of my book may be published in a different and a better form\r\nwould give me the greatest possible pleasure.\r\n\r\nOne thing in particular would I ask of any reader who may be willing to\r\ngive me the benefit of his advice. That is to say, I would beg of him\r\nto suppose, while recording his remarks, that it is for the benefit of\r\na man in no way his equal in education, or similar to him in tastes and\r\nideas, or capable of apprehending criticisms without full explanation\r\nappended, that he is doing so. Rather would I ask such a reader to\r\nsuppose that before him there stands a man of incomparably inferior\r\nenlightenment and schooling--a rude country bumpkin whose life,\r\nthroughout, has been passed in retirement--a bumpkin to whom it is\r\nnecessary to explain each circumstance in detail, while never forgetting\r\nto be as simple of speech as though he were a child, and at every step\r\nthere were a danger of employing terms beyond his understanding. Should\r\nthese precautions be kept constantly in view by any reader undertaking\r\nto annotate my book, that reader\'s remarks will exceed in weight\r\nand interest even his own expectations, and will bring me very real\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThus, provided that my earnest request be heeded by my readers, and\r\nthat among them there be found a few kind spirits to do as I desire, the\r\nfollowing is the manner in which I would request them to transmit their\r\nnotes for my consideration. Inscribing the package with my name, let\r\nthem then enclose that package in a second one addressed either to the\r\nRector of the University of St. Petersburg or to Professor Shevirev of\r\nthe University of Moscow, according as the one or the other of those two\r\ncities may be the nearer to the sender.\r\n\r\nLastly, while thanking all journalists and litterateurs for their\r\npreviously published criticisms of my book--criticisms which, in spite\r\nof a spice of that intemperance and prejudice which is common to all\r\nhumanity, have proved of the greatest use both to my head and to my\r\nheart--I beg of such writers again to favour me with their reviews. For\r\nin all sincerity I can assure them that whatsoever they may be pleased\r\nto say for my improvement and my instruction will be received by me with\r\nnaught but gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAD SOULS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTo the door of an inn in the provincial town of N. there drew up a smart\r\nbritchka--a light spring-carriage of the sort affected by bachelors,\r\nretired lieutenant-colonels, staff-captains, land-owners possessed of\r\nabout a hundred souls, and, in short, all persons who rank as gentlemen\r\nof the intermediate category. In the britchka was seated such a\r\ngentleman--a man who, though not handsome, was not ill-favoured, not\r\nover-fat, and not over-thin. Also, though not over-elderly, he was\r\nnot over-young. His arrival produced no stir in the town, and was\r\naccompanied by no particular incident, beyond that a couple of peasants\r\nwho happened to be standing at the door of a dramshop exchanged a few\r\ncomments with reference to the equipage rather than to the individual\r\nwho was seated in it. "Look at that carriage," one of them said to the\r\nother. "Think you it will be going as far as Moscow?" "I think it will,"\r\nreplied his companion. "But not as far as Kazan, eh?" "No, not as far as\r\nKazan." With that the conversation ended. Presently, as the britchka was\r\napproaching the inn, it was met by a young man in a pair of very short,\r\nvery tight breeches of white dimity, a quasi-fashionable frockcoat, and\r\na dickey fastened with a pistol-shaped bronze tie-pin. The young man\r\nturned his head as he passed the britchka and eyed it attentively;\r\nafter which he clapped his hand to his cap (which was in danger of being\r\nremoved by the wind) and resumed his way. On the vehicle reaching the\r\ninn door, its occupant found standing there to welcome him the polevoi,\r\nor waiter, of the establishment--an individual of such nimble and\r\nbrisk movement that even to distinguish the character of his face was\r\nimpossible. Running out with a napkin in one hand and his lanky form\r\nclad in a tailcoat, reaching almost to the nape of his neck, he tossed\r\nback his locks, and escorted the gentleman upstairs, along a wooden\r\ngallery, and so to the bedchamber which God had prepared for the\r\ngentleman\'s reception. The said bedchamber was of quite ordinary\r\nappearance, since the inn belonged to the species to be found in all\r\nprovincial towns--the species wherein, for two roubles a day, travellers\r\nmay obtain a room swarming with black-beetles, and communicating by a\r\ndoorway with the apartment adjoining. True, the doorway may be blocked\r\nup with a wardrobe; yet behind it, in all probability, there will be\r\nstanding a silent, motionless neighbour whose ears are burning to learn\r\nevery possible detail concerning the latest arrival. The inn\'s exterior\r\ncorresponded with its interior. Long, and consisting only of two\r\nstoreys, the building had its lower half destitute of stucco; with the\r\nresult that the dark-red bricks, originally more or less dingy, had\r\ngrown yet dingier under the influence of atmospheric changes. As for the\r\nupper half of the building, it was, of course, painted the usual tint\r\nof unfading yellow. Within, on the ground floor, there stood a number\r\nof benches heaped with horse-collars, rope, and sheepskins; while the\r\nwindow-seat accommodated a sbitentshik [4], cheek by jowl with a samovar\r\n[5]--the latter so closely resembling the former in appearance that, but\r\nfor the fact of the samovar possessing a pitch-black lip, the samovar\r\nand the sbitentshik might have been two of a pair.\r\n\r\nDuring the traveller\'s inspection of his room his luggage was brought\r\ninto the apartment. First came a portmanteau of white leather whose\r\nraggedness indicated that the receptacle had made several previous\r\njourneys. The bearers of the same were the gentleman\'s coachman,\r\nSelifan (a little man in a large overcoat), and the gentleman\'s\r\nvalet, Petrushka--the latter a fellow of about thirty, clad in a worn,\r\nover-ample jacket which formerly had graced his master\'s shoulders, and\r\npossessed of a nose and a pair of lips whose coarseness communicated to\r\nhis face rather a sullen expression. Behind the portmanteau came a\r\nsmall dispatch-box of redwood, lined with birch bark, a boot-case,\r\nand (wrapped in blue paper) a roast fowl; all of which having been\r\ndeposited, the coachman departed to look after his horses, and the valet\r\nto establish himself in the little dark anteroom or kennel where already\r\nhe had stored a cloak, a bagful of livery, and his own peculiar smell.\r\nPressing the narrow bedstead back against the wall, he covered it with\r\nthe tiny remnant of mattress--a remnant as thin and flat (perhaps also\r\nas greasy) as a pancake--which he had managed to beg of the landlord of\r\nthe establishment.\r\n\r\nWhile the attendants had been thus setting things straight the gentleman\r\nhad repaired to the common parlour. The appearance of common parlours of\r\nthe kind is known to every one who travels. Always they have varnished\r\nwalls which, grown black in their upper portions with tobacco smoke,\r\nare, in their lower, grown shiny with the friction of customers\'\r\nbacks--more especially with that of the backs of such local tradesmen\r\nas, on market-days, make it their regular practice to resort to\r\nthe local hostelry for a glass of tea. Also, parlours of this kind\r\ninvariably contain smutty ceilings, an equally smutty chandelier, a\r\nnumber of pendent shades which jump and rattle whenever the waiter\r\nscurries across the shabby oilcloth with a trayful of glasses (the\r\nglasses looking like a flock of birds roosting by the seashore), and a\r\nselection of oil paintings. In short, there are certain objects which\r\none sees in every inn. In the present case the only outstanding feature\r\nof the room was the fact that in one of the paintings a nymph was\r\nportrayed as possessing breasts of a size such as the reader can never\r\nin his life have beheld. A similar caricaturing of nature is to be noted\r\nin the historical pictures (of unknown origin, period, and creation)\r\nwhich reach us--sometimes through the instrumentality of Russian\r\nmagnates who profess to be connoisseurs of art--from Italy; owing to\r\nthe said magnates having made such purchases solely on the advice of the\r\ncouriers who have escorted them.\r\n\r\nTo resume, however--our traveller removed his cap, and divested his neck\r\nof a parti-coloured woollen scarf of the kind which a wife makes for\r\nher husband with her own hands, while accompanying the gift with\r\ninterminable injunctions as to how best such a garment ought to be\r\nfolded. True, bachelors also wear similar gauds, but, in their case,\r\nGod alone knows who may have manufactured the articles! For my part,\r\nI cannot endure them. Having unfolded the scarf, the gentleman ordered\r\ndinner, and whilst the various dishes were being got ready--cabbage\r\nsoup, a pie several weeks old, a dish of marrow and peas, a dish of\r\nsausages and cabbage, a roast fowl, some salted cucumber, and the sweet\r\ntart which stands perpetually ready for use in such establishments;\r\nwhilst, I say, these things were either being warmed up or brought in\r\ncold, the gentleman induced the waiter to retail certain fragments of\r\ntittle-tattle concerning the late landlord of the hostelry, the amount\r\nof income which the hostelry produced, and the character of its present\r\nproprietor. To the last-mentioned inquiry the waiter returned the answer\r\ninvariably given in such cases--namely, "My master is a terribly hard\r\nman, sir." Curious that in enlightened Russia so many people cannot even\r\ntake a meal at an inn without chattering to the attendant and making\r\nfree with him! Nevertheless not ALL the questions which the gentleman\r\nasked were aimless ones, for he inquired who was Governor of the town,\r\nwho President of the Local Council, and who Public Prosecutor. In short,\r\nhe omitted no single official of note, while asking also (though with an\r\nair of detachment) the most exact particulars concerning the landowners\r\nof the neighbourhood. Which of them, he inquired, possessed serfs, and\r\nhow many of them? How far from the town did those landowners reside?\r\nWhat was the character of each landowner, and was he in the habit of\r\npaying frequent visits to the town? The gentleman also made searching\r\ninquiries concerning the hygienic condition of the countryside. Was\r\nthere, he asked, much sickness about--whether sporadic fever, fatal\r\nforms of ague, smallpox, or what not? Yet, though his solicitude\r\nconcerning these matters showed more than ordinary curiosity, his\r\nbearing retained its gravity unimpaired, and from time to time he\r\nblew his nose with portentous fervour. Indeed, the manner in which he\r\naccomplished this latter feat was marvellous in the extreme, for, though\r\nthat member emitted sounds equal to those of a trumpet in intensity,\r\nhe could yet, with his accompanying air of guileless dignity, evoke the\r\nwaiter\'s undivided respect--so much so that, whenever the sounds of\r\nthe nose reached that menial\'s ears, he would shake back his locks,\r\nstraighten himself into a posture of marked solicitude, and inquire\r\nafresh, with head slightly inclined, whether the gentleman happened\r\nto require anything further. After dinner the guest consumed a cup of\r\ncoffee, and then, seating himself upon the sofa, with, behind him,\r\none of those wool-covered cushions which, in Russian taverns,\r\nresemble nothing so much as a cobblestone or a brick, fell to snoring;\r\nwhereafter, returning with a start to consciousness, he ordered himself\r\nto be conducted to his room, flung himself at full length upon the bed,\r\nand once more slept soundly for a couple of hours. Aroused, eventually,\r\nby the waiter, he, at the latter\'s request, inscribed a fragment of\r\npaper with his name, his surname, and his rank (for communication, in\r\naccordance with the law, to the police): and on that paper the waiter,\r\nleaning forward from the corridor, read, syllable by syllable: "Paul\r\nIvanovitch Chichikov, Collegiate Councillor--Landowner--Travelling\r\non Private Affairs." The waiter had just time to accomplish this\r\nfeat before Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov set forth to inspect the town.\r\nApparently the place succeeded in satisfying him, and, to tell the\r\ntruth, it was at least up to the usual standard of our provincial\r\ncapitals. Where the staring yellow of stone edifices did not greet his\r\neye he found himself confronted with the more modest grey of wooden\r\nones; which, consisting, for the most part, of one or two storeys (added\r\nto the range of attics which provincial architects love so well), looked\r\nalmost lost amid the expanses of street and intervening medleys of\r\nbroken or half-finished partition-walls. At other points evidence of\r\nmore life and movement was to be seen, and here the houses stood crowded\r\ntogether and displayed dilapidated, rain-blurred signboards whereon\r\nboots or cakes or pairs of blue breeches inscribed "Arshavski, Tailor,"\r\nand so forth, were depicted. Over a shop containing hats and caps\r\nwas written "Vassili Thedorov, Foreigner"; while, at another spot, a\r\nsignboard portrayed a billiard table and two players--the latter clad\r\nin frockcoats of the kind usually affected by actors whose part it is\r\nto enter the stage during the closing act of a piece, even though, with\r\narms sharply crooked and legs slightly bent, the said billiard players\r\nwere taking the most careful aim, but succeeding only in making abortive\r\nstrokes in the air. Each emporium of the sort had written over it: "This\r\nis the best establishment of its kind in the town." Also, al fresco in\r\nthe streets there stood tables heaped with nuts, soap, and gingerbread\r\n(the latter but little distinguishable from the soap), and at an\r\neating-house there was displayed the sign of a plump fish transfixed\r\nwith a gaff. But the sign most frequently to be discerned was the\r\ninsignia of the State, the double-headed eagle (now replaced, in this\r\nconnection, with the laconic inscription "Dramshop"). As for the paving\r\nof the town, it was uniformly bad.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman peered also into the municipal gardens, which contained\r\nonly a few sorry trees that were poorly selected, requiring to be\r\npropped with oil-painted, triangular green supports, and able to boast\r\nof a height no greater than that of an ordinary walking-stick. Yet\r\nrecently the local paper had said (apropos of a gala) that, "Thanks to\r\nthe efforts of our Civil Governor, the town has become enriched with a\r\npleasaunce full of umbrageous, spaciously-branching trees. Even on the\r\nmost sultry day they afford agreeable shade, and indeed gratifying\r\nwas it to see the hearts of our citizens panting with an impulse of\r\ngratitude as their eyes shed tears in recognition of all that their\r\nGovernor has done for them!"\r\n\r\nNext, after inquiring of a gendarme as to the best ways and means of\r\nfinding the local council, the local law-courts, and the local Governor,\r\nshould he (Chichikov) have need of them, the gentleman went on to\r\ninspect the river which ran through the town. En route he tore off a\r\nnotice affixed to a post, in order that he might the more conveniently\r\nread it after his return to the inn. Also, he bestowed upon a lady\r\nof pleasant exterior who, escorted by a footman laden with a bundle,\r\nhappened to be passing along a wooden sidewalk a prolonged stare.\r\nLastly, he threw around him a comprehensive glance (as though to fix in\r\nhis mind the general topography of the place) and betook himself\r\nhome. There, gently aided by the waiter, he ascended the stairs to his\r\nbedroom, drank a glass of tea, and, seating himself at the table, called\r\nfor a candle; which having been brought him, he produced from his pocket\r\nthe notice, held it close to the flame, and conned its tenour--slightly\r\ncontracting his right eye as he did so. Yet there was little in the\r\nnotice to call for remark. All that it said was that shortly one of\r\nKotzebue\'s [6] plays would be given, and that one of the parts in the\r\nplay was to be taken by a certain Monsieur Poplevin, and another by\r\na certain Mademoiselle Ziablova, while the remaining parts were to\r\nbe filled by a number of less important personages. Nevertheless the\r\ngentleman perused the notice with careful attention, and even jotted\r\ndown the prices to be asked for seats for the performance. Also, he\r\nremarked that the bill had been printed in the press of the Provincial\r\nGovernment. Next, he turned over the paper, in order to see if anything\r\nfurther was to be read on the reverse side; but, finding nothing there,\r\nhe refolded the document, placed it in the box which served him as a\r\nreceptacle for odds and ends, and brought the day to a close with a\r\nportion of cold veal, a bottle of pickles, and a sound sleep.\r\n\r\nThe following day he devoted to paying calls upon the various municipal\r\nofficials--a first, and a very respectful, visit being paid to the\r\nGovernor. This personage turned out to resemble Chichikov himself in\r\nthat he was neither fat nor thin. Also, he wore the riband of the order\r\nof Saint Anna about his neck, and was reported to have been recommended\r\nalso for the star. For the rest, he was large and good-natured, and had\r\na habit of amusing himself with occasional spells of knitting. Next,\r\nChichikov repaired to the Vice-Governor\'s, and thence to the house of\r\nthe Public Prosecutor, to that of the President of the Local Council, to\r\nthat of the Chief of Police, to that of the Commissioner of Taxes, and\r\nto that of the local Director of State Factories. True, the task of\r\nremembering every big-wig in this world of ours is not a very easy one;\r\nbut at least our visitor displayed the greatest activity in his work of\r\npaying calls, seeing that he went so far as to pay his respects also to\r\nthe Inspector of the Municipal Department of Medicine and to the City\r\nArchitect. Thereafter he sat thoughtfully in his britchka--plunged\r\nin meditation on the subject of whom else it might be well to visit.\r\nHowever, not a single magnate had been neglected, and in conversation\r\nwith his hosts he had contrived to flatter each separate one. For\r\ninstance to the Governor he had hinted that a stranger, on arriving\r\nin his, the Governor\'s province, would conceive that he had reached\r\nParadise, so velvety were the roads. "Governors who appoint capable\r\nsubordinates," had said Chichikov, "are deserving of the most ample meed\r\nof praise." Again, to the Chief of Police our hero had passed a most\r\ngratifying remark on the subject of the local gendarmery; while in\r\nhis conversation with the Vice-Governor and the President of the Local\r\nCouncil (neither of whom had, as yet, risen above the rank of State\r\nCouncillor) he had twice been guilty of the gaucherie of addressing his\r\ninterlocutors with the title of "Your Excellency"--a blunder which had\r\nnot failed to delight them. In the result the Governor had invited\r\nhim to a reception the same evening, and certain other officials had\r\nfollowed suit by inviting him, one of them to dinner, a second to a\r\ntea-party, and so forth, and so forth.\r\n\r\nOf himself, however, the traveller had spoken little; or, if he had\r\nspoken at any length, he had done so in a general sort of way and with\r\nmarked modesty. Indeed, at moments of the kind his discourse had assumed\r\nsomething of a literary vein, in that invariably he had stated that,\r\nbeing a worm of no account in the world, he was deserving of no\r\nconsideration at the hands of his fellows; that in his time he had\r\nundergone many strange experiences; that subsequently he had suffered\r\nmuch in the cause of Truth; that he had many enemies seeking his life;\r\nand that, being desirous of rest, he was now engaged in searching for a\r\nspot wherein to dwell--wherefore, having stumbled upon the town in which\r\nhe now found himself, he had considered it his bounden duty to evince\r\nhis respect for the chief authorities of the place. This, and no more,\r\nwas all that, for the moment, the town succeeded in learning about the\r\nnew arrival. Naturally he lost no time in presenting himself at the\r\nGovernor\'s evening party. First, however, his preparations for that\r\nfunction occupied a space of over two hours, and necessitated an\r\nattention to his toilet of a kind not commonly seen. That is to say,\r\nafter a brief post-prandial nap he called for soap and water, and spent\r\na considerable period in the task of scrubbing his cheeks (which, for\r\nthe purpose, he supported from within with his tongue) and then of\r\ndrying his full, round face, from the ears downwards, with a towel which\r\nhe took from the waiter\'s shoulder. Twice he snorted into the waiter\'s\r\ncountenance as he did this, and then he posted himself in front of the\r\nmirror, donned a false shirt-front, plucked out a couple of hairs which\r\nwere protruding from his nose, and appeared vested in a frockcoat\r\nof bilberry-coloured check. Thereafter driving through broad streets\r\nsparsely lighted with lanterns, he arrived at the Governor\'s residence\r\nto find it illuminated as for a ball. Barouches with gleaming lamps,\r\na couple of gendarmes posted before the doors, a babel of postillions\'\r\ncries--nothing of a kind likely to be impressive was wanting; and, on\r\nreaching the salon, the visitor actually found himself obliged to\r\nclose his eyes for a moment, so strong was the mingled sheen of lamps,\r\ncandles, and feminine apparel. Everything seemed suffused with light,\r\nand everywhere, flitting and flashing, were to be seen black coats--even\r\nas on a hot summer\'s day flies revolve around a sugar loaf while the\r\nold housekeeper is cutting it into cubes before the open window, and\r\nthe children of the house crowd around her to watch the movements of her\r\nrugged hands as those members ply the smoking pestle; and airy squadrons\r\nof flies, borne on the breeze, enter boldly, as though free of the\r\nhouse, and, taking advantage of the fact that the glare of the sunshine\r\nis troubling the old lady\'s sight, disperse themselves over broken\r\nand unbroken fragments alike, even though the lethargy induced by the\r\nopulence of summer and the rich shower of dainties to be encountered at\r\nevery step has induced them to enter less for the purpose of eating than\r\nfor that of showing themselves in public, of parading up and down the\r\nsugar loaf, of rubbing both their hindquarters and their fore against\r\none another, of cleaning their bodies under the wings, of extending\r\ntheir forelegs over their heads and grooming themselves, and of flying\r\nout of the window again to return with other predatory squadrons.\r\nIndeed, so dazed was Chichikov that scarcely did he realise that the\r\nGovernor was taking him by the arm and presenting him to his (the\r\nGovernor\'s) lady. Yet the newly-arrived guest kept his head sufficiently\r\nto contrive to murmur some such compliment as might fittingly come\r\nfrom a middle-aged individual of a rank neither excessively high nor\r\nexcessively low. Next, when couples had been formed for dancing and the\r\nremainder of the company found itself pressed back against the walls,\r\nChichikov folded his arms, and carefully scrutinised the dancers. Some\r\nof the ladies were dressed well and in the fashion, while the remainder\r\nwere clad in such garments as God usually bestows upon a provincial\r\ntown. Also here, as elsewhere, the men belonged to two separate and\r\ndistinct categories; one of which comprised slender individuals who,\r\nflitting around the ladies, were scarcely to be distinguished from\r\ndenizens of the metropolis, so carefully, so artistically, groomed were\r\ntheir whiskers, so presentable their oval, clean-shaven faces, so easy\r\nthe manner of their dancing attendance upon their womenfolk, so glib\r\ntheir French conversation as they quizzed their female companions. As\r\nfor the other category, it comprised individuals who, stout, or of the\r\nsame build as Chichikov (that is to say, neither very portly nor very\r\nlean), backed and sidled away from the ladies, and kept peering hither\r\nand thither to see whether the Governor\'s footmen had set out green\r\ntables for whist. Their features were full and plump, some of them had\r\nbeards, and in no case was their hair curled or waved or arranged in\r\nwhat the French call "the devil-may-care" style. On the contrary, their\r\nheads were either close-cropped or brushed very smooth, and their faces\r\nwere round and firm. This category represented the more respectable\r\nofficials of the town. In passing, I may say that in business matters\r\nfat men always prove superior to their leaner brethren; which is\r\nprobably the reason why the latter are mostly to be found in the\r\nPolitical Police, or acting as mere ciphers whose existence is a purely\r\nhopeless, airy, trivial one. Again, stout individuals never take a back\r\nseat, but always a front one, and, wheresoever it be, they sit firmly,\r\nand with confidence, and decline to budge even though the seat crack and\r\nbend with their weight. For comeliness of exterior they care not a rap,\r\nand therefore a dress coat sits less easily on their figures than is the\r\ncase with figures of leaner individuals. Yet invariably fat men amass\r\nthe greater wealth. In three years\' time a thin man will not have a\r\nsingle serf whom he has left unpledged; whereas--well, pray look at\r\na fat man\'s fortunes, and what will you see? First of all a suburban\r\nvilla, and then a larger suburban villa, and then a villa close to a\r\ntown, and lastly a country estate which comprises every amenity! That is\r\nto say, having served both God and the State, the stout individual\r\nhas won universal respect, and will end by retiring from business,\r\nreordering his mode of life, and becoming a Russian landowner--in other\r\nwords, a fine gentleman who dispenses hospitality, lives in comfort and\r\nluxury, and is destined to leave his property to heirs who are purposing\r\nto squander the same on foreign travel.\r\n\r\nThat the foregoing represents pretty much the gist of Chichikov\'s\r\nreflections as he stood watching the company I will not attempt to deny.\r\nAnd of those reflections the upshot was that he decided to join\r\nhimself to the stouter section of the guests, among whom he had\r\nalready recognised several familiar faces--namely, those of the Public\r\nProsecutor (a man with beetling brows over eyes which seemed to be\r\nsaying with a wink, "Come into the next room, my friend, for I have\r\nsomething to say to you"--though, in the main, their owner was a man of\r\ngrave and taciturn habit), of the Postmaster (an insignificant-looking\r\nindividual, yet a would-be wit and a philosopher), and of the President\r\nof the Local Council (a man of much amiability and good sense). These\r\nthree personages greeted Chichikov as an old acquaintance, and to their\r\nsalutations he responded with a sidelong, yet a sufficiently civil, bow.\r\nAlso, he became acquainted with an extremely unctuous and approachable\r\nlandowner named Manilov, and with a landowner of more uncouth exterior\r\nnamed Sobakevitch--the latter of whom began the acquaintance by treading\r\nheavily upon Chichikov\'s toes, and then begging his pardon. Next,\r\nChichikov received an offer of a "cut in" at whist, and accepted\r\nthe same with his usual courteous inclination of the head. Seating\r\nthemselves at a green table, the party did not rise therefrom till\r\nsupper time; and during that period all conversation between the players\r\nbecame hushed, as is the custom when men have given themselves up to\r\na really serious pursuit. Even the Postmaster--a talkative man by\r\nnature--had no sooner taken the cards into his hands than he assumed\r\nan expression of profound thought, pursed his lips, and retained this\r\nattitude unchanged throughout the game. Only when playing a court card\r\nwas it his custom to strike the table with his fist, and to exclaim (if\r\nthe card happened to be a queen), "Now, old popadia [7]!" and (if\r\nthe card happened to be a king), "Now, peasant of Tambov!" To which\r\nejaculations invariably the President of the Local Council retorted,\r\n"Ah, I have him by the ears, I have him by the ears!" And from the\r\nneighbourhood of the table other strong ejaculations relative to the\r\nplay would arise, interposed with one or another of those nicknames\r\nwhich participants in a game are apt to apply to members of the various\r\nsuits. I need hardly add that, the game over, the players fell to\r\nquarrelling, and that in the dispute our friend joined, though so\r\nartfully as to let every one see that, in spite of the fact that he was\r\nwrangling, he was doing so only in the most amicable fashion possible.\r\nNever did he say outright, "You played the wrong card at such and such\r\na point." No, he always employed some such phrase as, "You permitted\r\nyourself to make a slip, and thus afforded me the honour of covering\r\nyour deuce." Indeed, the better to keep in accord with his antagonists,\r\nhe kept offering them his silver-enamelled snuff-box (at the bottom\r\nof which lay a couple of violets, placed there for the sake of their\r\nscent). In particular did the newcomer pay attention to landowners\r\nManilov and Sobakevitch; so much so that his haste to arrive on good\r\nterms with them led to his leaving the President and the Postmaster\r\nrather in the shade. At the same time, certain questions which he put\r\nto those two landowners evinced not only curiosity, but also a certain\r\namount of sound intelligence; for he began by asking how many peasant\r\nsouls each of them possessed, and how their affairs happened at present\r\nto be situated, and then proceeded to enlighten himself also as their\r\nstanding and their families. Indeed, it was not long before he had\r\nsucceeded in fairly enchanting his new friends. In particular did\r\nManilov--a man still in his prime, and possessed of a pair of eyes\r\nwhich, sweet as sugar, blinked whenever he laughed--find himself unable\r\nto make enough of his enchanter. Clasping Chichikov long and fervently\r\nby the hand, he besought him to do him, Manilov, the honour of visiting\r\nhis country house (which he declared to lie at a distance of not more\r\nthan fifteen versts from the boundaries of the town); and in return\r\nChichikov averred (with an exceedingly affable bow and a most sincere\r\nhandshake) that he was prepared not only to fulfil his friend\'s behest,\r\nbut also to look upon the fulfilling of it as a sacred duty. In the same\r\nway Sobakevitch said to him laconically: "And do you pay ME a visit,"\r\nand then proceeded to shuffle a pair of boots of such dimensions that\r\nto find a pair to correspond with them would have been indeed\r\ndifficult--more especially at the present day, when the race of epic\r\nheroes is beginning to die out in Russia.\r\n\r\nNext day Chichikov dined and spent the evening at the house of the Chief\r\nof Police--a residence where, three hours after dinner, every one sat\r\ndown to whist, and remained so seated until two o\'clock in the morning.\r\nOn this occasion Chichikov made the acquaintance of, among others, a\r\nlandowner named Nozdrev--a dissipated little fellow of thirty who had no\r\nsooner exchanged three or four words with his new acquaintance than he\r\nbegan to address him in the second person singular. Yet although he did\r\nthe same to the Chief of Police and the Public Prosecutor, the company\r\nhad no sooner seated themselves at the card-table than both the one\r\nand the other of these functionaries started to keep a careful eye upon\r\nNozdrev\'s tricks, and to watch practically every card which he played.\r\nThe following evening Chichikov spent with the President of the Local\r\nCouncil, who received his guests--even though the latter included two\r\nladies--in a greasy dressing-gown. Upon that followed an evening at the\r\nVice-Governor\'s, a large dinner party at the house of the Commissioner\r\nof Taxes, a smaller dinner-party at the house of the Public Prosecutor\r\n(a very wealthy man), and a subsequent reception given by the Mayor. In\r\nshort, not an hour of the day did Chichikov find himself forced to\r\nspend at home, and his return to the inn became necessary only for the\r\npurposes of sleeping. Somehow or other he had landed on his feet, and\r\neverywhere he figured as an experienced man of the world. No matter what\r\nthe conversation chanced to be about, he always contrived to maintain\r\nhis part in the same. Did the discourse turn upon horse-breeding, upon\r\nhorse-breeding he happened to be peculiarly well-qualified to speak. Did\r\nthe company fall to discussing well-bred dogs, at once he had remarks of\r\nthe most pertinent kind possible to offer. Did the company touch upon\r\na prosecution which had recently been carried out by the Excise\r\nDepartment, instantly he showed that he too was not wholly unacquainted\r\nwith legal affairs. Did an opinion chance to be expressed concerning\r\nbilliards, on that subject too he was at least able to avoid committing\r\na blunder. Did a reference occur to virtue, concerning virtue he\r\nhastened to deliver himself in a way which brought tears to every eye.\r\nDid the subject in hand happen to be the distilling of brandy--well,\r\nthat was a matter concerning which he had the soundest of knowledge. Did\r\nany one happen to mention Customs officials and inspectors, from that\r\nmoment he expatiated as though he too had been both a minor functionary\r\nand a major. Yet a remarkable fact was the circumstance that he always\r\ncontrived to temper his omniscience with a certain readiness to give\r\nway, a certain ability so to keep a rein upon himself that never did his\r\nutterances become too loud or too soft, or transcend what was perfectly\r\nbefitting. In a word, he was always a gentleman of excellent manners,\r\nand every official in the place felt pleased when he saw him enter the\r\ndoor. Thus the Governor gave it as his opinion that Chichikov was a man\r\nof excellent intentions; the Public Prosecutor, that he was a good man\r\nof business; the Chief of Gendarmery, that he was a man of education;\r\nthe President of the Local Council, that he was a man of breeding and\r\nrefinement; and the wife of the Chief of Gendarmery, that his politeness\r\nof behaviour was equalled only by his affability of bearing. Nay, even\r\nSobakevitch--who as a rule never spoke well of ANY ONE--said to his\r\nlanky wife when, on returning late from the town, he undressed and\r\nbetook himself to bed by her side: "My dear, this evening, after dining\r\nwith the Chief of Police, I went on to the Governor\'s, and met there,\r\namong others, a certain Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov, who is a Collegiate\r\nCouncillor and a very pleasant fellow." To this his spouse replied "Hm!"\r\nand then dealt him a hearty kick in the ribs.\r\n\r\nSuch were the flattering opinions earned by the newcomer to the town;\r\nand these opinions he retained until the time when a certain speciality\r\nof his, a certain scheme of his (the reader will learn presently what it\r\nwas), plunged the majority of the townsfolk into a sea of perplexity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nFor more than two weeks the visitor lived amid a round of evening\r\nparties and dinners; wherefore he spent (as the saying goes) a very\r\npleasant time. Finally he decided to extend his visits beyond the urban\r\nboundaries by going and calling upon landowners Manilov and Sobakevitch,\r\nseeing that he had promised on his honour to do so. Yet what really\r\nincited him to this may have been a more essential cause, a matter of\r\ngreater gravity, a purpose which stood nearer to his heart, than the\r\nmotive which I have just given; and of that purpose the reader will\r\nlearn if only he will have the patience to read this prefatory narrative\r\n(which, lengthy though it be, may yet develop and expand in proportion\r\nas we approach the denouement with which the present work is destined to\r\nbe crowned).\r\n\r\nOne evening, therefore, Selifan the coachman received orders to have\r\nthe horses harnessed in good time next morning; while Petrushka\r\nreceived orders to remain behind, for the purpose of looking after the\r\nportmanteau and the room. In passing, the reader may care to become\r\nmore fully acquainted with the two serving-men of whom I have spoken.\r\nNaturally, they were not persons of much note, but merely what folk call\r\ncharacters of secondary, or even of tertiary, importance. Yet, despite\r\nthe fact that the springs and the thread of this romance will not DEPEND\r\nupon them, but only touch upon them, and occasionally include them,\r\nthe author has a passion for circumstantiality, and, like the average\r\nRussian, such a desire for accuracy as even a German could not rival.\r\nTo what the reader already knows concerning the personages in hand it is\r\ntherefore necessary to add that Petrushka usually wore a cast-off brown\r\njacket of a size too large for him, as also that he had (according to\r\nthe custom of individuals of his calling) a pair of thick lips and\r\na very prominent nose. In temperament he was taciturn rather than\r\nloquacious, and he cherished a yearning for self-education. That is to\r\nsay, he loved to read books, even though their contents came alike to\r\nhim whether they were books of heroic adventure or mere grammars or\r\nliturgical compendia. As I say, he perused every book with an equal\r\namount of attention, and, had he been offered a work on chemistry,\r\nwould have accepted that also. Not the words which he read, but the mere\r\nsolace derived from the act of reading, was what especially pleased his\r\nmind; even though at any moment there might launch itself from the page\r\nsome devil-sent word whereof he could make neither head nor tail. For\r\nthe most part, his task of reading was performed in a recumbent position\r\nin the anteroom; which circumstance ended by causing his mattress to\r\nbecome as ragged and as thin as a wafer. In addition to his love of\r\nporing over books, he could boast of two habits which constituted two\r\nother essential features of his character--namely, a habit of\r\nretiring to rest in his clothes (that is to say, in the brown jacket\r\nabove-mentioned) and a habit of everywhere bearing with him his own\r\npeculiar atmosphere, his own peculiar smell--a smell which filled\r\nany lodging with such subtlety that he needed but to make up his bed\r\nanywhere, even in a room hitherto untenanted, and to drag thither his\r\ngreatcoat and other impedimenta, for that room at once to assume an air\r\nof having been lived in during the past ten years. Nevertheless, though\r\na fastidious, and even an irritable, man, Chichikov would merely frown\r\nwhen his nose caught this smell amid the freshness of the morning, and\r\nexclaim with a toss of his head: "The devil only knows what is up with\r\nyou! Surely you sweat a good deal, do you not? The best thing you can do\r\nis to go and take a bath." To this Petrushka would make no reply, but,\r\napproaching, brush in hand, the spot where his master\'s coat would be\r\npendent, or starting to arrange one and another article in order, would\r\nstrive to seem wholly immersed in his work. Yet of what was he thinking\r\nas he remained thus silent? Perhaps he was saying to himself: "My master\r\nis a good fellow, but for him to keep on saying the same thing forty\r\ntimes over is a little wearisome." Only God knows and sees all things;\r\nwherefore for a mere human being to know what is in the mind of a\r\nservant while his master is scolding him is wholly impossible. However,\r\nno more need be said about Petrushka. On the other hand, Coachman\r\nSelifan--\r\n\r\nBut here let me remark that I do not like engaging the reader\'s\r\nattention in connection with persons of a lower class than himself; for\r\nexperience has taught me that we do not willingly familiarise ourselves\r\nwith the lower orders--that it is the custom of the average Russian to\r\nyearn exclusively for information concerning persons on the higher rungs\r\nof the social ladder. In fact, even a bowing acquaintance with a prince\r\nor a lord counts, in his eyes, for more than do the most intimate of\r\nrelations with ordinary folk. For the same reason the author feels\r\napprehensive on his hero\'s account, seeing that he has made that hero\r\na mere Collegiate Councillor--a mere person with whom Aulic Councillors\r\nmight consort, but upon whom persons of the grade of full General\r\n[8] would probably bestow one of those glances proper to a man who is\r\ncringing at their august feet. Worse still, such persons of the grade of\r\nGeneral are likely to treat Chichikov with studied negligence--and to an\r\nauthor studied negligence spells death.\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of the distressfulness of the foregoing possibilities,\r\nit is time that I returned to my hero. After issuing, overnight, the\r\nnecessary orders, he awoke early, washed himself, rubbed himself\r\nfrom head to foot with a wet sponge (a performance executed only on\r\nSundays--and the day in question happened to be a Sunday), shaved his\r\nface with such care that his cheeks issued of absolutely satin-like\r\nsmoothness and polish, donned first his bilberry-coloured, spotted\r\nfrockcoat, and then his bearskin overcoat, descended the staircase\r\n(attended, throughout, by the waiter) and entered his britchka. With a\r\nloud rattle the vehicle left the inn-yard, and issued into the street.\r\nA passing priest doffed his cap, and a few urchins in grimy shirts\r\nshouted, "Gentleman, please give a poor orphan a trifle!" Presently the\r\ndriver noticed that a sturdy young rascal was on the point of climbing\r\nonto the splashboard; wherefore he cracked his whip and the britchka\r\nleapt forward with increased speed over the cobblestones. At last, with\r\na feeling of relief, the travellers caught sight of macadam ahead, which\r\npromised an end both to the cobblestones and to sundry other annoyances.\r\nAnd, sure enough, after his head had been bumped a few more times\r\nagainst the boot of the conveyance, Chichikov found himself bowling over\r\nsofter ground. On the town receding into the distance, the sides of the\r\nroad began to be varied with the usual hillocks, fir trees, clumps of\r\nyoung pine, trees with old, scarred trunks, bushes of wild juniper, and\r\nso forth. Presently there came into view also strings of country villas\r\nwhich, with their carved supports and grey roofs (the latter looking\r\nlike pendent, embroidered tablecloths), resembled, rather, bundles\r\nof old faggots. Likewise the customary peasants, dressed in sheepskin\r\njackets, could be seen yawning on benches before their huts, while\r\ntheir womenfolk, fat of feature and swathed of bosom, gazed out of upper\r\nwindows, and the windows below displayed, here a peering calf, and there\r\nthe unsightly jaws of a pig. In short, the view was one of the familiar\r\ntype. After passing the fifteenth verst-stone Chichikov suddenly\r\nrecollected that, according to Manilov, fifteen versts was the exact\r\ndistance between his country house and the town; but the sixteenth verst\r\nstone flew by, and the said country house was still nowhere to be\r\nseen. In fact, but for the circumstance that the travellers happened to\r\nencounter a couple of peasants, they would have come on their errand in\r\nvain. To a query as to whether the country house known as Zamanilovka\r\nwas anywhere in the neighbourhood the peasants replied by doffing their\r\ncaps; after which one of them who seemed to boast of a little more\r\nintelligence than his companion, and who wore a wedge-shaped beard, made\r\nanswer:\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you mean Manilovka--not ZAmanilovka?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes--Manilovka."\r\n\r\n"Manilovka, eh? Well, you must continue for another verst, and then you\r\nwill see it straight before you, on the right."\r\n\r\n"On the right?" re-echoed the coachman.\r\n\r\n"Yes, on the right," affirmed the peasant. "You are on the proper road\r\nfor Manilovka, but ZAmanilovka--well, there is no such place. The house\r\nyou mean is called Manilovka because Manilovka is its name; but no house\r\nat all is called ZAmanilovka. The house you mean stands there, on that\r\nhill, and is a stone house in which a gentleman lives, and its name\r\nis Manilovka; but ZAmanilovka does not stand hereabouts, nor ever has\r\nstood."\r\n\r\nSo the travellers proceeded in search of Manilovka, and, after driving\r\nan additional two versts, arrived at a spot whence there branched off a\r\nby-road. Yet two, three, or four versts of the by-road had been covered\r\nbefore they saw the least sign of a two-storied stone mansion. Then it\r\nwas that Chichikov suddenly recollected that, when a friend has invited\r\none to visit his country house, and has said that the distance thereto\r\nis fifteen versts, the distance is sure to turn out to be at least\r\nthirty.\r\n\r\nNot many people would have admired the situation of Manilov\'s abode, for\r\nit stood on an isolated rise and was open to every wind that blew. On\r\nthe slope of the rise lay closely-mown turf, while, disposed here and\r\nthere, after the English fashion, were flower-beds containing clumps of\r\nlilac and yellow acacia. Also, there were a few insignificant groups\r\nof slender-leaved, pointed-tipped birch trees, with, under two of the\r\nlatter, an arbour having a shabby green cupola, some blue-painted wooden\r\nsupports, and the inscription "This is the Temple of Solitary Thought."\r\nLower down the slope lay a green-coated pond--green-coated ponds\r\nconstitute a frequent spectacle in the gardens of Russian landowners;\r\nand, lastly, from the foot of the declivity there stretched a line of\r\nmouldy, log-built huts which, for some obscure reason or another, our\r\nhero set himself to count. Up to two hundred or more did he count, but\r\nnowhere could he perceive a single leaf of vegetation or a single stick\r\nof timber. The only thing to greet the eye was the logs of which the\r\nhuts were constructed. Nevertheless the scene was to a certain extent\r\nenlivened by the spectacle of two peasant women who, with clothes\r\npicturesquely tucked up, were wading knee-deep in the pond and dragging\r\nbehind them, with wooden handles, a ragged fishing-net, in the meshes\r\nof which two crawfish and a roach with glistening scales were entangled.\r\nThe women appeared to have cause of dispute between themselves--to be\r\nrating one another about something. In the background, and to one side\r\nof the house, showed a faint, dusky blur of pinewood, and even the\r\nweather was in keeping with the surroundings, since the day was neither\r\nclear nor dull, but of the grey tint which may be noted in uniforms of\r\ngarrison soldiers which have seen long service. To complete the picture,\r\na cock, the recognised harbinger of atmospheric mutations, was present;\r\nand, in spite of the fact that a certain connection with affairs of\r\ngallantry had led to his having had his head pecked bare by other\r\ncocks, he flapped a pair of wings--appendages as bare as two pieces of\r\nbast--and crowed loudly.\r\n\r\nAs Chichikov approached the courtyard of the mansion he caught sight\r\nof his host (clad in a green frock coat) standing on the verandah and\r\npressing one hand to his eyes to shield them from the sun and so get a\r\nbetter view of the approaching carriage. In proportion as the britchka\r\ndrew nearer and nearer to the verandah, the host\'s eyes assumed a more\r\nand more delighted expression, and his smile a broader and broader\r\nsweep.\r\n\r\n"Paul Ivanovitch!" he exclaimed when at length Chichikov leapt from the\r\nvehicle. "Never should I have believed that you would have remembered\r\nus!"\r\n\r\nThe two friends exchanged hearty embraces, and Manilov then conducted\r\nhis guest to the drawing-room. During the brief time that they are\r\ntraversing the hall, the anteroom, and the dining-room, let me try\r\nto say something concerning the master of the house. But such an\r\nundertaking bristles with difficulties--it promises to be a far less\r\neasy task than the depicting of some outstanding personality which calls\r\nbut for a wholesale dashing of colours upon the canvas--the colours of\r\na pair of dark, burning eyes, a pair of dark, beetling brows, a forehead\r\nseamed with wrinkles, a black, or a fiery-red, cloak thrown backwards\r\nover the shoulder, and so forth, and so forth. Yet, so numerous are\r\nRussian serf owners that, though careful scrutiny reveals to one\'s sight\r\na quantity of outre peculiarities, they are, as a class, exceedingly\r\ndifficult to portray, and one needs to strain one\'s faculties to the\r\nutmost before it becomes possible to pick out their variously subtle,\r\ntheir almost invisible, features. In short, one needs, before doing\r\nthis, to carry out a prolonged probing with the aid of an insight\r\nsharpened in the acute school of research.\r\n\r\nOnly God can say what Manilov\'s real character was. A class of men\r\nexists whom the proverb has described as "men unto themselves, neither\r\nthis nor that--neither Bogdan of the city nor Selifan of the village."\r\nAnd to that class we had better assign also Manilov. Outwardly he was\r\npresentable enough, for his features were not wanting in amiability, but\r\nthat amiability was a quality into which there entered too much of the\r\nsugary element, so that his every gesture, his every attitude, seemed\r\nto connote an excess of eagerness to curry favour and cultivate a closer\r\nacquaintance. On first speaking to the man, his ingratiating smile, his\r\nflaxen hair, and his blue eyes would lead one to say, "What a pleasant,\r\ngood-tempered fellow he seems!" yet during the next moment or two one\r\nwould feel inclined to say nothing at all, and, during the third moment,\r\nonly to say, "The devil alone knows what he is!" And should, thereafter,\r\none not hasten to depart, one would inevitably become overpowered with\r\nthe deadly sense of ennui which comes of the intuition that nothing\r\nin the least interesting is to be looked for, but only a series of\r\nwearisome utterances of the kind which are apt to fall from the lips\r\nof a man whose hobby has once been touched upon. For every man HAS his\r\nhobby. One man\'s may be sporting dogs; another man\'s may be that of\r\nbelieving himself to be a lover of music, and able to sound the art to\r\nits inmost depths; another\'s may be that of posing as a connoisseur of\r\nrecherche cookery; another\'s may be that of aspiring to play roles of\r\na kind higher than nature has assigned him; another\'s (though this is\r\na more limited ambition) may be that of getting drunk, and of dreaming\r\nthat he is edifying both his friends, his acquaintances, and people with\r\nwhom he has no connection at all by walking arm-in-arm with an Imperial\r\naide-de-camp; another\'s may be that of possessing a hand able to chip\r\ncorners off aces and deuces of diamonds; another\'s may be that of\r\nyearning to set things straight--in other words, to approximate his\r\npersonality to that of a stationmaster or a director of posts. In short,\r\nalmost every man has his hobby or his leaning; yet Manilov had none\r\nsuch, for at home he spoke little, and spent the greater part of\r\nhis time in meditation--though God only knows what that meditation\r\ncomprised! Nor can it be said that he took much interest in the\r\nmanagement of his estate, for he never rode into the country, and the\r\nestate practically managed itself. Whenever the bailiff said to him, "It\r\nmight be well to have such-and-such a thing done," he would reply, "Yes,\r\nthat is not a bad idea," and then go on smoking his pipe--a habit which\r\nhe had acquired during his service in the army, where he had been looked\r\nupon as an officer of modesty, delicacy, and refinement. "Yes, it is NOT\r\na bad idea," he would repeat. Again, whenever a peasant approached him\r\nand, rubbing the back of his neck, said "Barin, may I have leave to go\r\nand work for myself, in order that I may earn my obrok [9]?" he would\r\nsnap out, with pipe in mouth as usual, "Yes, go!" and never trouble his\r\nhead as to whether the peasant\'s real object might not be to go and get\r\ndrunk. True, at intervals he would say, while gazing from the verandah\r\nto the courtyard, and from the courtyard to the pond, that it would be\r\nindeed splendid if a carriage drive could suddenly materialise, and the\r\npond as suddenly become spanned with a stone bridge, and little shops\r\nas suddenly arise whence pedlars could dispense the petty merchandise of\r\nthe kind which peasantry most need. And at such moments his eyes\r\nwould grow winning, and his features assume an expression of intense\r\nsatisfaction. Yet never did these projects pass beyond the stage of\r\ndebate. Likewise there lay in his study a book with the fourteenth page\r\npermanently turned down. It was a book which he had been reading for\r\nthe past two years! In general, something seemed to be wanting in the\r\nestablishment. For instance, although the drawing-room was filled with\r\nbeautiful furniture, and upholstered in some fine silken material which\r\nclearly had cost no inconsiderable sum, two of the chairs lacked\r\nany covering but bast, and for some years past the master had been\r\naccustomed to warn his guests with the words, "Do not sit upon these\r\nchairs; they are not yet ready for use." Another room contained no\r\nfurniture at all, although, a few days after the marriage, it had been\r\nsaid: "My dear, to-morrow let us set about procuring at least some\r\nTEMPORARY furniture for this room." Also, every evening would see placed\r\nupon the drawing-room table a fine bronze candelabrum, a statuette\r\nrepresentative of the Three Graces, a tray inlaid with mother-of-pearl,\r\nand a rickety, lop-sided copper invalide. Yet of the fact that all four\r\narticles were thickly coated with grease neither the master of the\r\nhouse nor the mistress nor the servants seemed to entertain the least\r\nsuspicion. At the same time, Manilov and his wife were quite satisfied\r\nwith each other. More than eight years had elapsed since their marriage,\r\nyet one of them was for ever offering his or her partner a piece of\r\napple or a bonbon or a nut, while murmuring some tender something which\r\nvoiced a whole-hearted affection. "Open your mouth, dearest"--thus ran\r\nthe formula--"and let me pop into it this titbit." You may be sure that\r\non such occasions the "dearest mouth" parted its lips most graciously!\r\nFor their mutual birthdays the pair always contrived some "surprise\r\npresent" in the shape of a glass receptacle for tooth-powder, or what\r\nnot; and as they sat together on the sofa he would suddenly, and for\r\nsome unknown reason, lay aside his pipe, and she her work (if at the\r\nmoment she happened to be holding it in her hands) and husband and wife\r\nwould imprint upon one another\'s cheeks such a prolonged and languishing\r\nkiss that during its continuance you could have smoked a small cigar. In\r\nshort, they were what is known as "a very happy couple." Yet it may be\r\nremarked that a household requires other pursuits to be engaged in than\r\nlengthy embracings and the preparing of cunning "surprises." Yes, many\r\na function calls for fulfilment. For instance, why should it be thought\r\nfoolish or low to superintend the kitchen? Why should care not be taken\r\nthat the storeroom never lacks supplies? Why should a housekeeper be\r\nallowed to thieve? Why should slovenly and drunken servants exist?\r\nWhy should a domestic staff be suffered in indulge in bouts of\r\nunconscionable debauchery during its leisure time? Yet none of these\r\nthings were thought worthy of consideration by Manilov\'s wife, for she\r\nhad been gently brought up, and gentle nurture, as we all know, is to\r\nbe acquired only in boarding schools, and boarding schools, as we know,\r\nhold the three principal subjects which constitute the basis of human\r\nvirtue to be the French language (a thing indispensable to the happiness\r\nof married life), piano-playing (a thing wherewith to beguile\r\na husband\'s leisure moments), and that particular department of\r\nhousewifery which is comprised in the knitting of purses and other\r\n"surprises." Nevertheless changes and improvements have begun to take\r\nplace, since things now are governed more by the personal inclinations\r\nand idiosyncracies of the keepers of such establishments. For instance,\r\nin some seminaries the regimen places piano-playing first, and the\r\nFrench language second, and then the above department of housewifery;\r\nwhile in other seminaries the knitting of "surprises" heads the list,\r\nand then the French language, and then the playing of pianos--so diverse\r\nare the systems in force! None the less, I may remark that Madame\r\nManilov--\r\n\r\nBut let me confess that I always shrink from saying too much about\r\nladies. Moreover, it is time that we returned to our heroes, who, during\r\nthe past few minutes, have been standing in front of the drawing-room\r\ndoor, and engaged in urging one another to enter first.\r\n\r\n"Pray be so good as not to inconvenience yourself on my account," said\r\nChichikov. "_I_ will follow YOU."\r\n\r\n"No, Paul Ivanovitch--no! You are my guest." And Manilov pointed towards\r\nthe doorway.\r\n\r\n"Make no difficulty about it, I pray," urged Chichikov. "I beg of you to\r\nmake no difficulty about it, but to pass into the room."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, I will not. Never could I allow so distinguished and so\r\nwelcome a guest as yourself to take second place."\r\n\r\n"Why call me \'distinguished,\' my dear sir? I beg of you to proceed."\r\n\r\n"Nay; be YOU pleased to do so."\r\n\r\n"And why?"\r\n\r\n"For the reason which I have stated." And Manilov smiled his very\r\npleasantest smile.\r\n\r\nFinally the pair entered simultaneously and sideways; with the result\r\nthat they jostled one another not a little in the process.\r\n\r\n"Allow me to present to you my wife," continued Manilov. "My dear--Paul\r\nIvanovitch."\r\n\r\nUpon that Chichikov caught sight of a lady whom hitherto he had\r\noverlooked, but who, with Manilov, was now bowing to him in the doorway.\r\nNot wholly of unpleasing exterior, she was dressed in a well-fitting,\r\nhigh-necked morning dress of pale-coloured silk; and as the visitor\r\nentered the room her small white hands threw something upon the table\r\nand clutched her embroidered skirt before rising from the sofa where she\r\nhad been seated. Not without a sense of pleasure did Chichikov take her\r\nhand as, lisping a little, she declared that she and her husband were\r\nequally gratified by his coming, and that, of late, not a day had passed\r\nwithout her husband recalling him to mind.\r\n\r\n"Yes," affirmed Manilov; "and every day SHE has said to ME: \'Why does\r\nnot your friend put in an appearance?\' \'Wait a little dearest,\' I have\r\nalways replied. \'\'Twill not be long now before he comes.\' And you HAVE\r\ncome, you HAVE honoured us with a visit, you HAVE bestowed upon us a\r\ntreat--a treat destined to convert this day into a gala day, a true\r\nbirthday of the heart."\r\n\r\nThe intimation that matters had reached the point of the occasion being\r\ndestined to constitute a "true birthday of the heart" caused Chichikov\r\nto become a little confused; wherefore he made modest reply that, as a\r\nmatter of fact, he was neither of distinguished origin nor distinguished\r\nrank.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you ARE so," interrupted Manilov with his fixed and engaging smile.\r\n"You are all that, and more."\r\n\r\n"How like you our town?" queried Madame. "Have you spent an agreeable\r\ntime in it?"\r\n\r\n"Very," replied Chichikov. "The town is an exceedingly nice one, and I\r\nhave greatly enjoyed its hospitable society."\r\n\r\n"And what do you think of our Governor?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; IS he not a most engaging and dignified personage?" added Manilov.\r\n\r\n"He is all that," assented Chichikov. "Indeed, he is a man worthy of the\r\ngreatest respect. And how thoroughly he performs his duty according to\r\nhis lights! Would that we had more like him!"\r\n\r\n"And the tactfulness with which he greets every one!" added Manilov,\r\nsmiling, and half-closing his eyes, like a cat which is being tickled\r\nbehind the ears.\r\n\r\n"Quite so," assented Chichikov. "He is a man of the most eminent\r\ncivility and approachableness. And what an artist! Never should I have\r\nthought he could have worked the marvellous household samplers which he\r\nhas done! Some specimens of his needlework which he showed me could not\r\nwell have been surpassed by any lady in the land!"\r\n\r\n"And the Vice-Governor, too--he is a nice man, is he not?" inquired\r\nManilov with renewed blinkings of the eyes.\r\n\r\n"Who? The Vice-Governor? Yes, a most worthy fellow!" replied Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"And what of the Chief of Police? Is it not a fact that he too is in the\r\nhighest degree agreeable?"\r\n\r\n"Very agreeable indeed. And what a clever, well-read individual! With\r\nhim and the Public Prosecutor and the President of the Local Council I\r\nplayed whist until the cocks uttered their last morning crow. He is a\r\nmost excellent fellow."\r\n\r\n"And what of his wife?" queried Madame Manilov. "Is she not a most\r\ngracious personality?"\r\n\r\n"One of the best among my limited acquaintance," agreed Chichikov.\r\n\r\nNor were the President of the Local Council and the Postmaster\r\noverlooked; until the company had run through the whole list of urban\r\nofficials. And in every case those officials appeared to be persons of\r\nthe highest possible merit.\r\n\r\n"Do you devote your time entirely to your estate?" asked Chichikov, in\r\nhis turn.\r\n\r\n"Well, most of it," replied Manilov; "though also we pay occasional\r\nvisits to the town, in order that we may mingle with a little well-bred\r\nsociety. One grows a trifle rusty if one lives for ever in retirement."\r\n\r\n"Quite so," agreed Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Yes, quite so," capped Manilov. "At the same time, it would be a\r\ndifferent matter if the neighbourhood were a GOOD one--if, for example,\r\none had a friend with whom one could discuss manners and polite\r\ndeportment, or engage in some branch of science, and so stimulate one\'s\r\nwits. For that sort of thing gives one\'s intellect an airing. It, it--"\r\nAt a loss for further words, he ended by remarking that his feelings\r\nwere apt to carry him away; after which he continued with a gesture:\r\n"What I mean is that, were that sort of thing possible, I, for\r\none, could find the country and an isolated life possessed of great\r\nattractions. But, as matters stand, such a thing is NOT possible. All\r\nthat I can manage to do is, occasionally, to read a little of A Son of\r\nthe Fatherland."\r\n\r\nWith these sentiments Chichikov expressed entire agreement: adding that\r\nnothing could be more delightful than to lead a solitary life in which\r\nthere should be comprised only the sweet contemplation of nature and the\r\nintermittent perusal of a book.\r\n\r\n"Nay, but even THAT were worth nothing had not one a friend with whom to\r\nshare one\'s life," remarked Manilov.\r\n\r\n"True, true," agreed Chichikov. "Without a friend, what are all the\r\ntreasures in the world? \'Possess not money,\' a wise man has said, \'but\r\nrather good friends to whom to turn in case of need.\'"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Paul Ivanovitch," said Manilov with a glance not merely sweet,\r\nbut positively luscious--a glance akin to the mixture which even clever\r\nphysicians have to render palatable before they can induce a hesitant\r\npatient to take it. "Consequently you may imagine what happiness--what\r\nPERFECT happiness, so to speak--the present occasion has brought me,\r\nseeing that I am permitted to converse with you and to enjoy your\r\nconversation."\r\n\r\n"But WHAT of my conversation?" replied Chichikov. "I am an insignificant\r\nindividual, and, beyond that, nothing."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Paul Ivanovitch!" cried the other. "Permit me to be frank, and to\r\nsay that I would give half my property to possess even a PORTION of the\r\ntalents which you possess."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, I should consider it the highest honour in the world\r\nif--"\r\n\r\nThe lengths to which this mutual outpouring of soul would have proceeded\r\nhad not a servant entered to announce luncheon must remain a mystery.\r\n\r\n"I humbly invite you to join us at table," said Manilov. "Also, you will\r\npardon us for the fact that we cannot provide a banquet such as is to\r\nbe obtained in our metropolitan cities? We partake of simple fare,\r\naccording to Russian custom--we confine ourselves to shtchi [10], but we\r\ndo so with a single heart. Come, I humbly beg of you."\r\n\r\nAfter another contest for the honour of yielding precedence, Chichikov\r\nsucceeded in making his way (in zigzag fashion) to the dining-room,\r\nwhere they found awaiting them a couple of youngsters. These were\r\nManilov\'s sons, and boys of the age which admits of their presence at\r\ntable, but necessitates the continued use of high chairs. Beside them\r\nwas their tutor, who bowed politely and smiled; after which the hostess\r\ntook her seat before her soup plate, and the guest of honour found\r\nhimself esconsed between her and the master of the house, while the\r\nservant tied up the boys\' necks in bibs.\r\n\r\n"What charming children!" said Chichikov as he gazed at the pair. "And\r\nhow old are they?"\r\n\r\n"The eldest is eight," replied Manilov, "and the younger one attained\r\nthe age of six yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Themistocleus," went on the father, turning to his first-born, who was\r\nengaged in striving to free his chin from the bib with which the footman\r\nhad encircled it. On hearing this distinctly Greek name (to which, for\r\nsome unknown reason, Manilov always appended the termination "eus"),\r\nChichikov raised his eyebrows a little, but hastened, the next moment,\r\nto restore his face to a more befitting expression.\r\n\r\n"Themistocleus," repeated the father, "tell me which is the finest city\r\nin France."\r\n\r\nUpon this the tutor concentrated his attention upon Themistocleus, and\r\nappeared to be trying hard to catch his eye. Only when Themistocleus had\r\nmuttered "Paris" did the preceptor grow calmer, and nod his head.\r\n\r\n"And which is the finest city in Russia?" continued Manilov.\r\n\r\nAgain the tutor\'s attitude became wholly one of concentration.\r\n\r\n"St. Petersburg," replied Themistocleus.\r\n\r\n"And what other city?"\r\n\r\n"Moscow," responded the boy.\r\n\r\n"Clever little dear!" burst out Chichikov, turning with an air of\r\nsurprise to the father. "Indeed, I feel bound to say that the child\r\nevinces the greatest possible potentialities."\r\n\r\n"You do not know him fully," replied the delighted Manilov. "The amount\r\nof sharpness which he possesses is extraordinary. Our younger one,\r\nAlkid, is not so quick; whereas his brother--well, no matter what he\r\nmay happen upon (whether upon a cowbug or upon a water-beetle or upon\r\nanything else), his little eyes begin jumping out of his head, and he\r\nruns to catch the thing, and to inspect it. For HIM I am reserving a\r\ndiplomatic post. Themistocleus," added the father, again turning to his\r\nson, "do you wish to become an ambassador?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do," replied Themistocleus, chewing a piece of bread and wagging\r\nhis head from side to side.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the lacquey who had been standing behind the future\r\nambassador wiped the latter\'s nose; and well it was that he did so,\r\nsince otherwise an inelegant and superfluous drop would have been added\r\nto the soup. After that the conversation turned upon the joys of a quiet\r\nlife--though occasionally it was interrupted by remarks from the hostess\r\non the subject of acting and actors. Meanwhile the tutor kept his eyes\r\nfixed upon the speakers\' faces; and whenever he noticed that they were\r\non the point of laughing he at once opened his mouth, and laughed with\r\nenthusiasm. Probably he was a man of grateful heart who wished to\r\nrepay his employers for the good treatment which he had received. Once,\r\nhowever, his features assumed a look of grimness as, fixing his eyes\r\nupon his vis-a-vis, the boys, he tapped sternly upon the table. This\r\nhappened at a juncture when Themistocleus had bitten Alkid on the ear,\r\nand the said Alkid, with frowning eyes and open mouth, was preparing\r\nhimself to sob in piteous fashion; until, recognising that for such a\r\nproceeding he might possibly be deprived of his plate, he hastened to\r\nrestore his mouth to its original expression, and fell tearfully to\r\ngnawing a mutton bone--the grease from which had soon covered his\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\nEvery now and again the hostess would turn to Chichikov with the words,\r\n"You are eating nothing--you have indeed taken little;" but invariably\r\nher guest replied: "Thank you, I have had more than enough. A pleasant\r\nconversation is worth all the dishes in the world."\r\n\r\nAt length the company rose from table. Manilov was in high spirits,\r\nand, laying his hand upon his guest\'s shoulder, was on the point of\r\nconducting him to the drawing-room, when suddenly Chichikov intimated\r\nto him, with a meaning look, that he wished to speak to him on a very\r\nimportant matter.\r\n\r\n"That being so," said Manilov, "allow me to invite you into my study."\r\nAnd he led the way to a small room which faced the blue of the forest.\r\n"This is my sanctum," he added.\r\n\r\n"What a pleasant apartment!" remarked Chichikov as he eyed it carefully.\r\nAnd, indeed, the room did not lack a certain attractiveness. The walls\r\nwere painted a sort of blueish-grey colour, and the furniture consisted\r\nof four chairs, a settee, and a table--the latter of which bore a few\r\nsheets of writing-paper and the book of which I have before had occasion\r\nto speak. But the most prominent feature of the room was tobacco, which\r\nappeared in many different guises--in packets, in a tobacco jar, and in\r\na loose heap strewn about the table. Likewise, both window sills were\r\nstudded with little heaps of ash, arranged, not without artifice, in\r\nrows of more or less tidiness. Clearly smoking afforded the master of\r\nthe house a frequent means of passing the time.\r\n\r\n"Permit me to offer you a seat on this settee," said Manilov. "Here you\r\nwill be quieter than you would be in the drawing-room."\r\n\r\n"But I should prefer to sit upon this chair."\r\n\r\n"I cannot allow that," objected the smiling Manilov. "The settee is\r\nspecially reserved for my guests. Whether you choose or no, upon it you\r\nMUST sit."\r\n\r\nAccordingly Chichikov obeyed.\r\n\r\n"And also let me hand you a pipe."\r\n\r\n"No, I never smoke," answered Chichikov civilly, and with an assumed air\r\nof regret.\r\n\r\n"And why?" inquired Manilov--equally civilly, but with a regret that was\r\nwholly genuine.\r\n\r\n"Because I fear that I have never quite formed the habit, owing to\r\nmy having heard that a pipe exercises a desiccating effect upon the\r\nsystem."\r\n\r\n"Then allow me to tell you that that is mere prejudice. Nay, I would\r\neven go so far as to say that to smoke a pipe is a healthier practice\r\nthan to take snuff. Among its members our regiment numbered a\r\nlieutenant--a most excellent, well-educated fellow--who was simply\r\nINCAPABLE of removing his pipe from his mouth, whether at table or\r\n(pardon me) in other places. He is now forty, yet no man could enjoy\r\nbetter health than he has always done."\r\n\r\nChichikov replied that such cases were common, since nature comprised\r\nmany things which even the finest intellect could not compass.\r\n\r\n"But allow me to put to you a question," he went on in a tone in which\r\nthere was a strange--or, at all events, RATHER a strange--note. For some\r\nunknown reason, also, he glanced over his shoulder. For some equally\r\nunknown reason, Manilov glanced over HIS.\r\n\r\n"How long is it," inquired the guest, "since you last rendered a census\r\nreturn?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, a long, long time. In fact, I cannot remember when it was."\r\n\r\n"And since then have many of your serfs died?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know. To ascertain that I should need to ask my bailiff.\r\nFootman, go and call the bailiff. I think he will be at home to-day."\r\n\r\nBefore long the bailiff made his appearance. He was a man of under\r\nforty, clean-shaven, clad in a smock, and evidently used to a quiet\r\nlife, seeing that his face was of that puffy fullness, and the skin\r\nencircling his slit-like eyes was of that sallow tint, which shows that\r\nthe owner of those features is well acquainted with a feather bed. In a\r\ntrice it could be seen that he had played his part in life as all such\r\nbailiffs do--that, originally a young serf of elementary education, he\r\nhad married some Agashka of a housekeeper or a mistress\'s favourite, and\r\nthen himself become housekeeper, and, subsequently, bailiff; after which\r\nhe had proceeded according to the rules of his tribe--that is to say,\r\nhe had consorted with and stood in with the more well-to-do serfs on the\r\nestate, and added the poorer ones to the list of forced payers of obrok,\r\nwhile himself leaving his bed at nine o\'clock in the morning, and, when\r\nthe samovar had been brought, drinking his tea at leisure.\r\n\r\n"Look here, my good man," said Manilov. "How many of our serfs have died\r\nsince the last census revision?"\r\n\r\n"How many of them have died? Why, a great many." The bailiff hiccoughed,\r\nand slapped his mouth lightly after doing so.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I imagined that to be the case," corroborated Manilov. "In fact,\r\na VERY great many serfs have died." He turned to Chichikov and repeated\r\nthe words.\r\n\r\n"How many, for instance?" asked Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Yes; how many?" re-echoed Manilov.\r\n\r\n"HOW many?" re-echoed the bailiff. "Well, no one knows the exact number,\r\nfor no one has kept any account."\r\n\r\n"Quite so," remarked Manilov. "I supposed the death-rate to have been\r\nhigh, but was ignorant of its precise extent."\r\n\r\n"Then would you be so good as to have it computed for me?" said\r\nChichikov. "And also to have a detailed list of the deaths made out?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will--a detailed list," agreed Manilov.\r\n\r\n"Very well."\r\n\r\nThe bailiff departed.\r\n\r\n"For what purpose do you want it?" inquired Manilov when the bailiff had\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nThe question seemed to embarrass the guest, for in Chichikov\'s face\r\nthere dawned a sort of tense expression, and it reddened as though its\r\nowner were striving to express something not easy to put into words.\r\nTrue enough, Manilov was now destined to hear such strange and\r\nunexpected things as never before had greeted human ears.\r\n\r\n"You ask me," said Chichikov, "for what purpose I want the list. Well,\r\nmy purpose in wanting it is this--that I desire to purchase a few\r\npeasants." And he broke off in a gulp.\r\n\r\n"But may I ask HOW you desire to purchase those peasants?" asked\r\nManilov. "With land, or merely as souls for transferment--that is to\r\nsay, by themselves, and without any land?"\r\n\r\n"I want the peasants themselves only," replied Chichikov. "And I want\r\ndead ones at that."\r\n\r\n"What?--Excuse me, but I am a trifle deaf. Really, your words sound most\r\nstrange!"\r\n\r\n"All that I am proposing to do," replied Chichikov, "is to purchase the\r\ndead peasants who, at the last census, were returned by you as alive."\r\n\r\nManilov dropped his pipe on the floor, and sat gaping. Yes, the two\r\nfriends who had just been discussing the joys of camaraderie sat\r\nstaring at one another like the portraits which, of old, used to hang on\r\nopposite sides of a mirror. At length Manilov picked up his pipe, and,\r\nwhile doing so, glanced covertly at Chichikov to see whether there was\r\nany trace of a smile to be detected on his lips--whether, in short, he\r\nwas joking. But nothing of the sort could be discerned. On the contrary,\r\nChichikov\'s face looked graver than usual. Next, Manilov wondered\r\nwhether, for some unknown reason, his guest had lost his wits; wherefore\r\nhe spent some time in gazing at him with anxious intentness. But the\r\nguest\'s eyes seemed clear--they contained no spark of the wild, restless\r\nfire which is apt to wander in the eyes of madmen. All was as it should\r\nbe. Consequently, in spite of Manilov\'s cogitations, he could think\r\nof nothing better to do than to sit letting a stream of tobacco smoke\r\nescape from his mouth.\r\n\r\n"So," continued Chichikov, "what I desire to know is whether you are\r\nwilling to hand over to me--to resign--these actually non-living, but\r\nlegally living, peasants; or whether you have any better proposal to\r\nmake?"\r\n\r\nManilov felt too confused and confounded to do aught but continue\r\nstaring at his interlocutor.\r\n\r\n"I think that you are disturbing yourself unnecessarily," was\r\nChichikov\'s next remark.\r\n\r\n"I? Oh no! Not at all!" stammered Manilov. "Only--pardon me--I do not\r\nquite comprehend you. You see, never has it fallen to my lot to acquire\r\nthe brilliant polish which is, so to speak, manifest in your every\r\nmovement. Nor have I ever been able to attain the art of expressing\r\nmyself well. Consequently, although there is a possibility that in\r\nthe--er--utterances which have just fallen from your lips there may\r\nlie something else concealed, it may equally be that--er--you have been\r\npleased so to express yourself for the sake of the beauty of the terms\r\nwherein that expression found shape?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," asserted Chichikov. "I mean what I say and no more. My\r\nreference to such of your pleasant souls as are dead was intended to be\r\ntaken literally."\r\n\r\nManilov still felt at a loss--though he was conscious that he MUST do\r\nsomething, he MUST propound some question. But what question? The devil\r\nalone knew! In the end he merely expelled some more tobacco smoke--this\r\ntime from his nostrils as well as from his mouth.\r\n\r\n"So," went on Chichikov, "if no obstacle stands in the way, we might as\r\nwell proceed to the completion of the purchase."\r\n\r\n"What? Of the purchase of the dead souls?"\r\n\r\n"Of the \'dead\' souls? Oh dear no! Let us write them down as LIVING ones,\r\nseeing that that is how they figure in the census returns. Never do I\r\npermit myself to step outside the civil law, great though has been\r\nthe harm which that rule has wrought me in my career. In my eyes an\r\nobligation is a sacred thing. In the presence of the law I am dumb."\r\n\r\nThese last words reassured Manilov not a little: yet still the meaning\r\nof the affair remained to him a mystery. By way of answer, he fell to\r\nsucking at his pipe with such vehemence that at length the pipe began\r\nto gurgle like a bassoon. It was as though he had been seeking of\r\nit inspiration in the present unheard-of juncture. But the pipe only\r\ngurgled, et praeterea nihil.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you feel doubtful about the proposal?" said Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," replied Manilov. "But you will, I know, excuse me if I\r\nsay (and I say it out of no spirit of prejudice, nor yet as criticising\r\nyourself in any way)--you will, I know, excuse me if I say that possibly\r\nthis--er--this, er, SCHEME of yours, this--er--TRANSACTION of yours, may\r\nfail altogether to accord with the Civil Statutes and Provisions of the\r\nRealm?"\r\n\r\nAnd Manilov, with a slight gesture of the head, looked meaningly into\r\nChichikov\'s face, while displaying in his every feature, including\r\nhis closely-compressed lips, such an expression of profundity as\r\nnever before was seen on any human countenance--unless on that of some\r\nparticularly sapient Minister of State who is debating some particularly\r\nabstruse problem.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Chichikov rejoined that the kind of scheme or transaction\r\nwhich he had adumbrated in no way clashed with the Civil Statutes and\r\nProvisions of Russia; to which he added that the Treasury would even\r\nBENEFIT by the enterprise, seeing it would draw therefrom the usual\r\nlegal percentage.\r\n\r\n"What, then, do you propose?" asked Manilov.\r\n\r\n"I propose only what is above-board, and nothing else."\r\n\r\n"Then, that being so, it is another matter, and I have nothing to urge\r\nagainst it," said Manilov, apparently reassured to the full.\r\n\r\n"Very well," remarked Chichikov. "Then we need only to agree as to the\r\nprice."\r\n\r\n"As to the price?" began Manilov, and then stopped. Presently he went\r\non: "Surely you cannot suppose me capable of taking money for souls\r\nwhich, in one sense at least, have completed their existence? Seeing\r\nthat this fantastic whim of yours (if I may so call it?) has seized\r\nupon you to the extent that it has, I, on my side, shall be ready to\r\nsurrender to you those souls UNCONDITIONALLY, and to charge myself with\r\nthe whole expenses of the sale."\r\n\r\nI should be greatly to blame if I were to omit that, as soon as Manilov\r\nhad pronounced these words, the face of his guest became replete with\r\nsatisfaction. Indeed, grave and prudent a man though Chichikov was,\r\nhe had much ado to refrain from executing a leap that would have done\r\ncredit to a goat (an animal which, as we all know, finds itself moved\r\nto such exertions only during moments of the most ecstatic joy).\r\nNevertheless the guest did at least execute such a convulsive shuffle\r\nthat the material with which the cushions of the chair were covered came\r\napart, and Manilov gazed at him with some misgiving. Finally Chichikov\'s\r\ngratitude led him to plunge into a stream of acknowledgement of a\r\nvehemence which caused his host to grow confused, to blush, to shake\r\nhis head in deprecation, and to end by declaring that the concession was\r\nnothing, and that, his one desire being to manifest the dictates of\r\nhis heart and the psychic magnetism which his friend exercised, he, in\r\nshort, looked upon the dead souls as so much worthless rubbish.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," replied Chichikov, pressing his hand; after which\r\nhe heaved a profound sigh. Indeed, he seemed in the right mood for\r\noutpourings of the heart, for he continued--not without a ring of\r\nemotion in his tone: "If you but knew the service which you have\r\nrendered to an apparently insignificant individual who is devoid both\r\nof family and kindred! For what have I not suffered in my time--I, a\r\ndrifting barque amid the tempestuous billows of life? What harryings,\r\nwhat persecutions, have I not known? Of what grief have I not tasted?\r\nAnd why? Simply because I have ever kept the truth in view, because ever\r\nI have preserved inviolate an unsullied conscience, because ever I have\r\nstretched out a helping hand to the defenceless widow and the hapless\r\norphan!" After which outpouring Chichikov pulled out his handkerchief,\r\nand wiped away a brimming tear.\r\n\r\nManilov\'s heart was moved to the core. Again and again did the two\r\nfriends press one another\'s hands in silence as they gazed into one\r\nanother\'s tear-filled eyes. Indeed, Manilov COULD not let go our hero\'s\r\nhand, but clasped it with such warmth that the hero in question began\r\nto feel himself at a loss how best to wrench it free: until, quietly\r\nwithdrawing it, he observed that to have the purchase completed as\r\nspeedily as possible would not be a bad thing; wherefore he himself\r\nwould at once return to the town to arrange matters. Taking up his hat,\r\ntherefore, he rose to make his adieus.\r\n\r\n"What? Are you departing already?" said Manilov, suddenly recovering\r\nhimself, and experiencing a sense of misgiving. At that moment his wife\r\nsailed into the room.\r\n\r\n"Is Paul Ivanovitch leaving us so soon, dearest Lizanka?" she said with\r\nan air of regret.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Surely it must be that we have wearied him?" her spouse replied.\r\n\r\n"By no means," asserted Chichikov, pressing his hand to his heart. "In\r\nthis breast, madam, will abide for ever the pleasant memory of the time\r\nwhich I have spent with you. Believe me, I could conceive of no greater\r\nblessing than to reside, if not under the same roof as yourselves, at\r\nall events in your immediate neighbourhood."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" exclaimed Manilov, greatly pleased with the idea. "How\r\nsplendid it would be if you DID come to reside under our roof, so that\r\nwe could recline under an elm tree together, and talk philosophy, and\r\ndelve to the very root of things!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it WOULD be a paradisaical existence!" agreed Chichikov with a\r\nsigh. Nevertheless he shook hands with Madame. "Farewell, sudarina," he\r\nsaid. "And farewell to YOU, my esteemed host. Do not forget what I have\r\nrequested you to do."\r\n\r\n"Rest assured that I will not," responded Manilov. "Only for a couple of\r\ndays will you and I be parted from one another."\r\n\r\nWith that the party moved into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"Farewell, dearest children," Chichikov went on as he caught sight of\r\nAlkid and Themistocleus, who were playing with a wooden hussar which\r\nlacked both a nose and one arm. "Farewell, dearest pets. Pardon me for\r\nhaving brought you no presents, but, to tell you the truth, I was not,\r\nuntil my visit, aware of your existence. However, now that I shall be\r\ncoming again, I will not fail to bring you gifts. Themistocleus, to you\r\nI will bring a sword. You would like that, would you not?"\r\n\r\n"I should," replied Themistocleus.\r\n\r\n"And to you, Alkid, I will bring a drum. That would suit you, would it\r\nnot?" And he bowed in Alkid\'s direction.\r\n\r\n"Zeth--a drum," lisped the boy, hanging his head.\r\n\r\n"Good! Then a drum it shall be--SUCH a beautiful drum! What a\r\ntur-r-r-ru-ing and a tra-ta-ta-ta-ing you will be able to kick up!\r\nFarewell, my darling." And, kissing the boy\'s head, he turned to Manilov\r\nand Madame with the slight smile which one assumes before assuring\r\nparents of the guileless merits of their offspring.\r\n\r\n"But you had better stay, Paul Ivanovitch," said the father as the trio\r\nstepped out on to the verandah. "See how the clouds are gathering!"\r\n\r\n"They are only small ones," replied Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"And you know your way to Sobakevitch\'s?"\r\n\r\n"No, I do not, and should be glad if you would direct me."\r\n\r\n"If you like I will tell your coachman." And in very civil fashion\r\nManilov did so, even going so far as to address the man in the second\r\nperson plural. On hearing that he was to pass two turnings, and then to\r\ntake a third, Selifan remarked, "We shall get there all right, sir," and\r\nChichikov departed amid a profound salvo of salutations and wavings of\r\nhandkerchiefs on the part of his host and hostess, who raised themselves\r\non tiptoe in their enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nFor a long while Manilov stood following the departing britchka with his\r\neyes. In fact, he continued to smoke his pipe and gaze after the\r\nvehicle even when it had become lost to view. Then he re-entered the\r\ndrawing-room, seated himself upon a chair, and surrendered his mind to\r\nthe thought that he had shown his guest most excellent entertainment.\r\nNext, his mind passed imperceptibly to other matters, until at last it\r\nlost itself God only knows where. He thought of the amenities of a life,\r\nof friendship, and of how nice it would be to live with a comrade on,\r\nsay, the bank of some river, and to span the river with a bridge of his\r\nown, and to build an enormous mansion with a facade lofty enough even to\r\nafford a view to Moscow. On that facade he and his wife and friend would\r\ndrink afternoon tea in the open air, and discuss interesting subjects;\r\nafter which, in a fine carriage, they would drive to some reunion or\r\nother, where with their pleasant manners they would so charm the company\r\nthat the Imperial Government, on learning of their merits, would raise\r\nthe pair to the grade of General or God knows what--that is to say, to\r\nheights whereof even Manilov himself could form no idea. Then suddenly\r\nChichikov\'s extraordinary request interrupted the dreamer\'s reflections,\r\nand he found his brain powerless to digest it, seeing that, turn and\r\nturn the matter about as he might, he could not properly explain its\r\nbearing. Smoking his pipe, he sat where he was until supper time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Chichikov, seated in his britchka and bowling along the\r\nturnpike, was feeling greatly pleased with himself. From the preceding\r\nchapter the reader will have gathered the principal subject of his bent\r\nand inclinations: wherefore it is no matter for wonder that his body\r\nand his soul had ended by becoming wholly immersed therein. To all\r\nappearances the thoughts, the calculations, and the projects which\r\nwere now reflected in his face partook of a pleasant nature, since\r\nmomentarily they kept leaving behind them a satisfied smile. Indeed, so\r\nengrossed was he that he never noticed that his coachman, elated with\r\nthe hospitality of Manilov\'s domestics, was making remarks of a didactic\r\nnature to the off horse of the troika [11], a skewbald. This skewbald\r\nwas a knowing animal, and made only a show of pulling; whereas its\r\ncomrades, the middle horse (a bay, and known as the Assessor, owing to\r\nhis having been acquired from a gentleman of that rank) and the near\r\nhorse (a roan), would do their work gallantly, and even evince in their\r\neyes the pleasure which they derived from their exertions.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you rascal, you rascal! I\'ll get the better of you!" ejaculated\r\nSelifan as he sat up and gave the lazy one a cut with his whip. "YOU\r\nknow your business all right, you German pantaloon! The bay is a good\r\nfellow, and does his duty, and I will give him a bit over his feed, for\r\nhe is a horse to be respected; and the Assessor too is a good horse. But\r\nwhat are YOU shaking your ears for? You are a fool, so just mind when\r\nyou\'re spoken to. \'Tis good advice I\'m giving you, you blockhead. Ah!\r\nYou CAN travel when you like." And he gave the animal another cut,\r\nand then shouted to the trio, "Gee up, my beauties!" and drew his whip\r\ngently across the backs of the skewbald\'s comrades--not as a punishment,\r\nbut as a sign of his approval. That done, he addressed himself to the\r\nskewbald again.\r\n\r\n"Do you think," he cried, "that I don\'t see what you are doing? You can\r\nbehave quite decently when you like, and make a man respect you."\r\n\r\nWith that he fell to recalling certain reminiscences.\r\n\r\n"They were NICE folk, those folk at the gentleman\'s yonder," he mused.\r\n"I DO love a chat with a man when he is a good sort. With a man of that\r\nkind I am always hail-fellow-well-met, and glad to drink a glass of\r\ntea with him, or to eat a biscuit. One CAN\'T help respecting a decent\r\nfellow. For instance, this gentleman of mine--why, every one looks up\r\nto him, for he has been in the Government\'s service, and is a Collegiate\r\nCouncillor."\r\n\r\nThus soliloquising, he passed to more remote abstractions; until, had\r\nChichikov been listening, he would have learnt a number of interesting\r\ndetails concerning himself. However, his thoughts were wholly occupied\r\nwith his own subject, so much so that not until a loud clap of thunder\r\nawoke him from his reverie did he glance around him. The sky was\r\ncompletely covered with clouds, and the dusty turnpike beginning to\r\nbe sprinkled with drops of rain. At length a second and a nearer and a\r\nlouder peal resounded, and the rain descended as from a bucket. Falling\r\nslantwise, it beat upon one side of the basketwork of the tilt until the\r\nsplashings began to spurt into his face, and he found himself forced to\r\ndraw the curtains (fitted with circular openings through which to obtain\r\na glimpse of the wayside view), and to shout to Selifan to quicken his\r\npace. Upon that the coachman, interrupted in the middle of his harangue,\r\nbethought him that no time was to be lost; wherefore, extracting from\r\nunder the box-seat a piece of old blanket, he covered over his sleeves,\r\nresumed the reins, and cheered on his threefold team (which, it may\r\nbe said, had so completely succumbed to the influence of the pleasant\r\nlassitude induced by Selifan\'s discourse that it had taken to scarcely\r\nplacing one leg before the other). Unfortunately, Selifan could not\r\nclearly remember whether two turnings had been passed or three. Indeed,\r\non collecting his faculties, and dimly recalling the lie of the road,\r\nhe became filled with a shrewd suspicion that A VERY LARGE NUMBER of\r\nturnings had been passed. But since, at moments which call for a hasty\r\ndecision, a Russian is quick to discover what may conceivably be\r\nthe best course to take, our coachman put away from him all ulterior\r\nreasoning, and, turning to the right at the next cross-road, shouted,\r\n"Hi, my beauties!" and set off at a gallop. Never for a moment did he\r\nstop to think whither the road might lead him!\r\n\r\nIt was long before the clouds had discharged their burden, and,\r\nmeanwhile, the dust on the road became kneaded into mire, and the\r\nhorses\' task of pulling the britchka heavier and heavier. Also,\r\nChichikov had taken alarm at his continued failure to catch sight of\r\nSobakevitch\'s country house. According to his calculations, it ought to\r\nhave been reached long ago. He gazed about him on every side, but the\r\ndarkness was too dense for the eye to pierce.\r\n\r\n"Selifan!" he exclaimed, leaning forward in the britchka.\r\n\r\n"What is it, barin?" replied the coachman.\r\n\r\n"Can you see the country house anywhere?"\r\n\r\n"No, barin." After which, with a flourish of the whip, the man broke\r\ninto a sort of endless, drawling song. In that song everything had\r\na place. By "everything" I mean both the various encouraging and\r\nstimulating cries with which Russian folk urge on their horses, and a\r\nrandom, unpremeditated selection of adjectives.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Chichikov began to notice that the britchka was swaying\r\nviolently, and dealing him occasional bumps. Consequently he suspected\r\nthat it had left the road and was being dragged over a ploughed field.\r\nUpon Selifan\'s mind there appeared to have dawned a similar inkling, for\r\nhe had ceased to hold forth.\r\n\r\n"You rascal, what road are you following?" inquired Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," retorted the coachman. "What can a man do at a time of\r\nnight when the darkness won\'t let him even see his whip?" And as Selifan\r\nspoke the vehicle tilted to an angle which left Chichikov no choice but\r\nto hang on with hands and teeth. At length he realised the fact that\r\nSelifan was drunk.\r\n\r\n"Stop, stop, or you will upset us!" he shouted to the fellow.\r\n\r\n"No, no, barin," replied Selifan. "HOW could I upset you? To upset\r\npeople is wrong. I know that very well, and should never dream of such\r\nconduct."\r\n\r\nHere he started to turn the vehicle round a little--and kept on doing so\r\nuntil the britchka capsized on to its side, and Chichikov landed in the\r\nmud on his hands and knees. Fortunately Selifan succeeded in stopping\r\nthe horses, although they would have stopped of themselves, seeing\r\nthat they were utterly worn out. This unforeseen catastrophe evidently\r\nastonished their driver. Slipping from the box, he stood resting his\r\nhands against the side of the britchka, while Chichikov tumbled and\r\nfloundered about in the mud, in a vain endeavour to wriggle clear of the\r\nstuff.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you!" said Selifan meditatively to the britchka. "To think of\r\nupsetting us like this!"\r\n\r\n"You are as drunk as a lord!" exclaimed Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"No, no, barin. Drunk, indeed? Why, I know my manners too well. A word\r\nor two with a friend--that is all that I have taken. Any one may talk\r\nwith a decent man when he meets him. There is nothing wrong in\r\nthat. Also, we had a snack together. There is nothing wrong in a\r\nsnack--especially a snack with a decent man."\r\n\r\n"What did I say to you when last you got drunk?" asked Chichikov. "Have\r\nyou forgotten what I said then?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, barin. HOW could I forget it? I know what is what, and know\r\nthat it is not right to get drunk. All that I have been having is a word\r\nor two with a decent man, for the reason that--"\r\n\r\n"Well, if I lay the whip about you, you\'ll know then how to talk to a\r\ndecent fellow, I\'ll warrant!"\r\n\r\n"As you please, barin," replied the complacent Selifan. "Should you\r\nwhip me, you will whip me, and I shall have nothing to complain of. Why\r\nshould you not whip me if I deserve it? \'Tis for you to do as you like.\r\nWhippings are necessary sometimes, for a peasant often plays the fool,\r\nand discipline ought to be maintained. If I have deserved it, beat me.\r\nWhy should you not?"\r\n\r\nThis reasoning seemed, at the moment, irrefutable, and Chichikov said\r\nnothing more. Fortunately fate had decided to take pity on the pair, for\r\nfrom afar their ears caught the barking of a dog. Plucking up courage,\r\nChichikov gave orders for the britchka to be righted, and the horses to\r\nbe urged forward; and since a Russian driver has at least this merit,\r\nthat, owing to a keen sense of smell being able to take the place\r\nof eyesight, he can, if necessary, drive at random and yet reach a\r\ndestination of some sort, Selifan succeeded, though powerless to discern\r\na single object, in directing his steeds to a country house near by, and\r\nthat with such a certainty of instinct that it was not until the shafts\r\nhad collided with a garden wall, and thereby made it clear that to\r\nproceed another pace was impossible, that he stopped. All that Chichikov\r\ncould discern through the thick veil of pouring rain was something\r\nwhich resembled a verandah. So he dispatched Selifan to search for the\r\nentrance gates, and that process would have lasted indefinitely had it\r\nnot been shortened by the circumstance that, in Russia, the place of\r\na Swiss footman is frequently taken by watchdogs; of which animals a\r\nnumber now proclaimed the travellers\' presence so loudly that Chichikov\r\nfound himself forced to stop his ears. Next, a light gleamed in one\r\nof the windows, and filtered in a thin stream to the garden wall--thus\r\nrevealing the whereabouts of the entrance gates; whereupon Selifan\r\nfell to knocking at the gates until the bolts of the house door were\r\nwithdrawn and there issued therefrom a figure clad in a rough cloak.\r\n\r\n"Who is that knocking? What have you come for?" shouted the hoarse voice\r\nof an elderly woman.\r\n\r\n"We are travellers, good mother," said Chichikov. "Pray allow us to\r\nspend the night here."\r\n\r\n"Out upon you for a pair of gadabouts!" retorted the old woman. "A fine\r\ntime of night to be arriving! We don\'t keep an hotel, mind you. This is\r\na lady\'s residence."\r\n\r\n"But what are we to do, mother? We have lost our way, and cannot spend\r\nthe night out of doors in such weather."\r\n\r\n"No, we cannot. The night is dark and cold," added Selifan.\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, you fool!" exclaimed Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Who ARE you, then?" inquired the old woman.\r\n\r\n"A dvorianin [12], good mother."\r\n\r\nSomehow the word dvorianin seemed to give the old woman food for\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n"Wait a moment," she said, "and I will tell the mistress."\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later she returned with a lantern in her hand, the gates\r\nwere opened, and a light glimmered in a second window. Entering the\r\ncourtyard, the britchka halted before a moderate-sized mansion. The\r\ndarkness did not permit of very accurate observation being made,\r\nbut, apparently, the windows only of one-half of the building were\r\nilluminated, while a quagmire in front of the door reflected the beams\r\nfrom the same. Meanwhile the rain continued to beat sonorously down upon\r\nthe wooden roof, and could be heard trickling into a water butt; nor\r\nfor a single moment did the dogs cease to bark with all the strength of\r\ntheir lungs. One of them, throwing up its head, kept venting a howl\r\nof such energy and duration that the animal seemed to be howling for a\r\nhandsome wager; while another, cutting in between the yelpings of the\r\nfirst animal, kept restlessly reiterating, like a postman\'s bell, the\r\nnotes of a very young puppy. Finally, an old hound which appeared to be\r\ngifted with a peculiarly robust temperament kept supplying the part of\r\ncontrabasso, so that his growls resembled the rumbling of a bass singer\r\nwhen a chorus is in full cry, and the tenors are rising on tiptoe in\r\ntheir efforts to compass a particularly high note, and the whole body of\r\nchoristers are wagging their heads before approaching a climax, and\r\nthis contrabasso alone is tucking his bearded chin into his collar, and\r\nsinking almost to a squatting posture on the floor, in order to produce\r\na note which shall cause the windows to shiver and their panes to crack.\r\nNaturally, from a canine chorus of such executants it might reasonably\r\nbe inferred that the establishment was one of the utmost respectability.\r\nTo that, however, our damp, cold hero gave not a thought, for all his\r\nmind was fixed upon bed. Indeed, the britchka had hardly come to a\r\nstandstill before he leapt out upon the doorstep, missed his footing,\r\nand came within an ace of falling. To meet him there issued a female\r\nyounger than the first, but very closely resembling her; and on his\r\nbeing conducted to the parlour, a couple of glances showed him that the\r\nroom was hung with old striped curtains, and ornamented with pictures\r\nof birds and small, antique mirrors--the latter set in dark frames which\r\nwere carved to resemble scrolls of foliage. Behind each mirror was stuck\r\neither a letter or an old pack of cards or a stocking, while on the wall\r\nhung a clock with a flowered dial. More, however, Chichikov could not\r\ndiscern, for his eyelids were as heavy as though smeared with treacle.\r\nPresently the lady of the house herself entered--an elderly woman in a\r\nsort of nightcap (hastily put on) and a flannel neck wrap. She belonged\r\nto that class of lady landowners who are for ever lamenting failures of\r\nthe harvest and their losses thereby; to the class who, drooping their\r\nheads despondently, are all the while stuffing money into striped\r\npurses, which they keep hoarded in the drawers of cupboards. Into one\r\npurse they will stuff rouble pieces, into another half roubles, and into\r\na third tchetvertachki [13], although from their mien you would suppose\r\nthat the cupboard contained only linen and nightshirts and skeins of\r\nwool and the piece of shabby material which is destined--should the\r\nold gown become scorched during the baking of holiday cakes and other\r\ndainties, or should it fall into pieces of itself--to become converted\r\ninto a new dress. But the gown never does get burnt or wear out, for\r\nthe reason that the lady is too careful; wherefore the piece of shabby\r\nmaterial reposes in its unmade-up condition until the priest advises\r\nthat it be given to the niece of some widowed sister, together with a\r\nquantity of other such rubbish.\r\n\r\nChichikov apologised for having disturbed the household with his\r\nunexpected arrival.\r\n\r\n"Not at all, not at all," replied the lady. "But in what dreadful\r\nweather God has brought you hither! What wind and what rain! You could\r\nnot help losing your way. Pray excuse us for being unable to make better\r\npreparations for you at this time of night."\r\n\r\nSuddenly there broke in upon the hostess\' words the sound of a strange\r\nhissing, a sound so loud that the guest started in alarm, and the more\r\nso seeing that it increased until the room seemed filled with adders. On\r\nglancing upwards, however, he recovered his composure, for he perceived\r\nthe sound to be emanating from the clock, which appeared to be in a mind\r\nto strike. To the hissing sound there succeeded a wheezing one, until,\r\nputting forth its best efforts, the thing struck two with as much\r\nclatter as though some one had been hitting an iron pot with a\r\ncudgel. That done, the pendulum returned to its right-left, right-left\r\noscillation.\r\n\r\nChichikov thanked his hostess kindly, and said that he needed nothing,\r\nand she must not put herself about: only for rest was he longing--though\r\nalso he should like to know whither he had arrived, and whether the\r\ndistance to the country house of land-owner Sobakevitch was anything\r\nvery great. To this the lady replied that she had never so much as heard\r\nthe name, since no gentleman of the name resided in the locality.\r\n\r\n"But at least you are acquainted with landowner Manilov?" continued\r\nChichikov.\r\n\r\n"No. Who is he?"\r\n\r\n"Another landed proprietor, madam."\r\n\r\n"Well, neither have I heard of him. No such landowner lives hereabouts."\r\n\r\n"Then who ARE your local landowners?"\r\n\r\n"Bobrov, Svinin, Kanapatiev, Khapakin, Trepakin, and Plieshakov."\r\n\r\n"Are they rich men?"\r\n\r\n"No, none of them. One of them may own twenty souls, and another thirty,\r\nbut of gentry who own a hundred there are none."\r\n\r\nChichikov reflected that he had indeed fallen into an aristocratic\r\nwilderness!\r\n\r\n"At all events, is the town far away?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"About sixty versts. How sorry I am that I have nothing for you to eat!\r\nShould you care to drink some tea?"\r\n\r\n"I thank you, good mother, but I require nothing beyond a bed."\r\n\r\n"Well, after such a journey you must indeed be needing rest, so you\r\nshall lie upon this sofa. Fetinia, bring a quilt and some pillows and\r\nsheets. What weather God has sent us! And what dreadful thunder! Ever\r\nsince sunset I have had a candle burning before the ikon in my bedroom.\r\nMy God! Why, your back and sides are as muddy as a boar\'s! However have\r\nyou managed to get into such a state?"\r\n\r\n"That I am nothing worse than muddy is indeed fortunate, since, but for\r\nthe Almighty, I should have had my ribs broken."\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear! To think of all that you must have been through. Had I not\r\nbetter wipe your back?"\r\n\r\n"I thank you, I thank you, but you need not trouble. Merely be so good\r\nas to tell your maid to dry my clothes."\r\n\r\n"Do you hear that, Fetinia?" said the hostess, turning to a woman who\r\nwas engaged in dragging in a feather bed and deluging the room with\r\nfeathers. "Take this coat and this vest, and, after drying them before\r\nthe fire--just as we used to do for your late master--give them a good\r\nrub, and fold them up neatly."\r\n\r\n"Very well, mistress," said Fetinia, spreading some sheets over the bed,\r\nand arranging the pillows.\r\n\r\n"Now your bed is ready for you," said the hostess to Chichikov.\r\n"Good-night, dear sir. I wish you good-night. Is there anything else\r\nthat you require? Perhaps you would like to have your heels tickled\r\nbefore retiring to rest? Never could my late husband get to sleep\r\nwithout that having been done."\r\n\r\nBut the guest declined the proffered heel-tickling, and, on his hostess\r\ntaking her departure, hastened to divest himself of his clothing, both\r\nupper and under, and to hand the garments to Fetinia. She wished him\r\ngood-night, and removed the wet trappings; after which he found himself\r\nalone. Not without satisfaction did he eye his bed, which reached\r\nalmost to the ceiling. Clearly Fetinia was a past mistress in the art of\r\nbeating up such a couch, and, as the result, he had no sooner mounted\r\nit with the aid of a chair than it sank well-nigh to the floor, and the\r\nfeathers, squeezed out of their proper confines, flew hither and thither\r\ninto every corner of the apartment. Nevertheless he extinguished the\r\ncandle, covered himself over with the chintz quilt, snuggled down\r\nbeneath it, and instantly fell asleep. Next day it was late in the\r\nmorning before he awoke. Through the window the sun was shining into his\r\neyes, and the flies which, overnight, had been roosting quietly on the\r\nwalls and ceiling now turned their attention to the visitor. One settled\r\non his lip, another on his ear, a third hovered as though intending\r\nto lodge in his very eye, and a fourth had the temerity to alight\r\njust under his nostrils. In his drowsy condition he inhaled the latter\r\ninsect, sneezed violently, and so returned to consciousness. He\r\nglanced around the room, and perceived that not all the pictures were\r\nrepresentative of birds, since among them hung also a portrait of\r\nKutuzov [14] and an oil painting of an old man in a uniform with red\r\nfacings such as were worn in the days of the Emperor Paul [15]. At this\r\nmoment the clock uttered its usual hissing sound, and struck ten, while\r\na woman\'s face peered in at the door, but at once withdrew, for the\r\nreason that, with the object of sleeping as well as possible, Chichikov\r\nhad removed every stitch of his clothing. Somehow the face seemed to him\r\nfamiliar, and he set himself to recall whose it could be. At length he\r\nrecollected that it was the face of his hostess. His clothes he found\r\nlying, clean and dry, beside him; so he dressed and approached the\r\nmirror, meanwhile sneezing again with such vehemence that a cock which\r\nhappened at the moment to be near the window (which was situated at no\r\ngreat distance from the ground) chuckled a short, sharp phrase. Probably\r\nit meant, in the bird\'s alien tongue, "Good morning to you!" Chichikov\r\nretorted by calling the bird a fool, and then himself approached the\r\nwindow to look at the view. It appeared to comprise a poulterer\'s\r\npremises. At all events, the narrow yard in front of the window was full\r\nof poultry and other domestic creatures--of game fowls and barn door\r\nfowls, with, among them, a cock which strutted with measured gait, and\r\nkept shaking its comb, and tilting its head as though it were trying to\r\nlisten to something. Also, a sow and her family were helping to grace\r\nthe scene. First, she rooted among a heap of litter; then, in passing,\r\nshe ate up a young pullet; lastly, she proceeded carelessly to munch\r\nsome pieces of melon rind. To this small yard or poultry-run a length\r\nof planking served as a fence, while beyond it lay a kitchen garden\r\ncontaining cabbages, onions, potatoes, beetroots, and other household\r\nvegetables. Also, the garden contained a few stray fruit trees that\r\nwere covered with netting to protect them from the magpies and sparrows;\r\nflocks of which were even then wheeling and darting from one spot to\r\nanother. For the same reason a number of scarecrows with outstretched\r\narms stood reared on long poles, with, surmounting one of the figures,\r\na cast-off cap of the hostess\'s. Beyond the garden again there stood a\r\nnumber of peasants\' huts. Though scattered, instead of being arranged in\r\nregular rows, these appeared to Chichikov\'s eye to comprise well-to-do\r\ninhabitants, since all rotten planks in their roofing had been replaced\r\nwith new ones, and none of their doors were askew, and such of their\r\ntiltsheds as faced him evinced evidence of a presence of a spare\r\nwaggon--in some cases almost a new one.\r\n\r\n"This lady owns by no means a poor village," said Chichikov to himself;\r\nwherefore he decided then and there to have a talk with his hostess, and\r\nto cultivate her closer acquaintance. Accordingly he peeped through the\r\nchink of the door whence her head had recently protruded, and, on seeing\r\nher seated at a tea table, entered and greeted her with a cheerful,\r\nkindly smile.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, dear sir," she responded as she rose. "How have you\r\nslept?" She was dressed in better style than she had been on the\r\nprevious evening. That is to say, she was now wearing a gown of some\r\ndark colour, and lacked her nightcap, and had swathed her neck in\r\nsomething stiff.\r\n\r\n"I have slept exceedingly well," replied Chichikov, seating himself upon\r\na chair. "And how are YOU, good madam?"\r\n\r\n"But poorly, my dear sir."\r\n\r\n"And why so?"\r\n\r\n"Because I cannot sleep. A pain has taken me in my middle, and my legs,\r\nfrom the ankles upwards, are aching as though they were broken."\r\n\r\n"That will pass, that will pass, good mother. You must pay no attention\r\nto it."\r\n\r\n"God grant that it MAY pass. However, I have been rubbing myself with\r\nlard and turpentine. What sort of tea will you take? In this jar I have\r\nsome of the scented kind."\r\n\r\n"Excellent, good mother! Then I will take that."\r\n\r\nProbably the reader will have noticed that, for all his expressions of\r\nsolicitude, Chichikov\'s tone towards his hostess partook of a freer, a\r\nmore unceremonious, nature than that which he had adopted towards Madam\r\nManilov. And here I should like to assert that, howsoever much, in\r\ncertain respects, we Russians may be surpassed by foreigners, at least\r\nwe surpass them in adroitness of manner. In fact the various shades and\r\nsubtleties of our social intercourse defy enumeration. A Frenchman or\r\na German would be incapable of envisaging and understanding all its\r\npeculiarities and differences, for his tone in speaking to a millionaire\r\ndiffers but little from that which he employs towards a small\r\ntobacconist--and that in spite of the circumstance that he is accustomed\r\nto cringe before the former. With us, however, things are different. In\r\nRussian society there exist clever folk who can speak in one manner to\r\na landowner possessed of two hundred peasant souls, and in another to\r\na landowner possessed of three hundred, and in another to a landowner\r\npossessed of five hundred. In short, up to the number of a million\r\nsouls the Russian will have ready for each landowner a suitable mode of\r\naddress. For example, suppose that somewhere there exists a government\r\noffice, and that in that office there exists a director. I would beg of\r\nyou to contemplate him as he sits among his myrmidons. Sheer nervousness\r\nwill prevent you from uttering a word in his presence, so great are the\r\npride and superiority depicted on his countenance. Also, were you to\r\nsketch him, you would be sketching a veritable Prometheus, for his\r\nglance is as that of an eagle, and he walks with measured, stately\r\nstride. Yet no sooner will the eagle have left the room to seek the\r\nstudy of his superior officer than he will go scurrying along (papers\r\nheld close to his nose) like any partridge. But in society, and at the\r\nevening party (should the rest of those present be of lesser rank than\r\nhimself) the Prometheus will once more become Prometheus, and the man\r\nwho stands a step below him will treat him in a way never dreamt of by\r\nOvid, seeing that each fly is of lesser account than its superior fly,\r\nand becomes, in the presence of the latter, even as a grain of sand.\r\n"Surely that is not Ivan Petrovitch?" you will say of such and such a\r\nman as you regard him. "Ivan Petrovitch is tall, whereas this man is\r\nsmall and spare. Ivan Petrovitch has a loud, deep voice, and never\r\nsmiles, whereas this man (whoever he may be) is twittering like a\r\nsparrow, and smiling all the time." Yet approach and take a good look at\r\nthe fellow and you will see that is IS Ivan Petrovitch. "Alack, alack!"\r\nwill be the only remark you can make.\r\n\r\nLet us return to our characters in real life. We have seen that, on this\r\noccasion, Chichikov decided to dispense with ceremony; wherefore, taking\r\nup the teapot, he went on as follows:\r\n\r\n"You have a nice little village here, madam. How many souls does it\r\ncontain?"\r\n\r\n"A little less than eighty, dear sir. But the times are hard, and I have\r\nlost a great deal through last year\'s harvest having proved a failure."\r\n\r\n"But your peasants look fine, strong fellows. May I enquire your name?\r\nThrough arriving so late at night I have quite lost my wits."\r\n\r\n"Korobotchka, the widow of a Collegiate Secretary."\r\n\r\n"I humbly thank you. And your Christian name and patronymic?"\r\n\r\n"Nastasia Petrovna."\r\n\r\n"Nastasia Petrovna! Those are excellent names. I have a maternal aunt\r\nnamed like yourself."\r\n\r\n"And YOUR name?" queried the lady. "May I take it that you are a\r\nGovernment Assessor?"\r\n\r\n"No, madam," replied Chichikov with a smile. "I am not an Assessor, but\r\na traveller on private business."\r\n\r\n"Then you must be a buyer of produce? How I regret that I have sold my\r\nhoney so cheaply to other buyers! Otherwise YOU might have bought it,\r\ndear sir."\r\n\r\n"I never buy honey."\r\n\r\n"Then WHAT do you buy, pray? Hemp? I have a little of that by me, but\r\nnot more than half a pood [16] or so."\r\n\r\n"No, madam. It is in other wares that I deal. Tell me, have you, of late\r\nyears, lost many of your peasants by death?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; no fewer than eighteen," responded the old lady with a sigh. "Such\r\na fine lot, too--all good workers! True, others have since grown up,\r\nbut of what use are THEY? Mere striplings. When the Assessor last called\r\nupon me I could have wept; for, though those workmen of mine are dead,\r\nI have to keep on paying for them as though they were still alive! And\r\nonly last week my blacksmith got burnt to death! Such a clever hand at\r\nhis trade he was!"\r\n\r\n"What? A fire occurred at your place?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, God preserve us all! It was not so bad as that. You must\r\nunderstand that the blacksmith SET HIMSELF on fire--he got set on fire\r\nin his bowels through overdrinking. Yes, all of a sudden there burst\r\nfrom him a blue flame, and he smouldered and smouldered until he had\r\nturned as black as a piece of charcoal! Yet what a clever blacksmith he\r\nwas! And now I have no horses to drive out with, for there is no one to\r\nshoe them."\r\n\r\n"In everything the will of God, madam," said Chichikov with a sigh.\r\n"Against the divine wisdom it is not for us to rebel. Pray hand them\r\nover to me, Nastasia Petrovna."\r\n\r\n"Hand over whom?"\r\n\r\n"The dead peasants."\r\n\r\n"But how could I do that?"\r\n\r\n"Quite simply. Sell them to me, and I will give you some money in\r\nexchange."\r\n\r\n"But how am I to sell them to you? I scarcely understand what you mean.\r\nAm I to dig them up again from the ground?"\r\n\r\nChichikov perceived that the old lady was altogether at sea, and that he\r\nmust explain the matter; wherefore in a few words he informed her that\r\nthe transfer or purchase of the souls in question would take place\r\nmerely on paper--that the said souls would be listed as still alive.\r\n\r\n"And what good would they be to you?" asked his hostess, staring at him\r\nwith her eyes distended.\r\n\r\n"That is MY affair."\r\n\r\n"But they are DEAD souls."\r\n\r\n"Who said they were not? The mere fact of their being dead entails upon\r\nyou a loss as dead as the souls, for you have to continue paying tax\r\nupon them, whereas MY plan is to relieve you both of the tax and of the\r\nresultant trouble. NOW do you understand? And I will not only do as\r\nI say, but also hand you over fifteen roubles per soul. Is that clear\r\nenough?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--but I do not know," said his hostess diffidently. "You see, never\r\nbefore have I sold dead souls."\r\n\r\n"Quite so. It would be a surprising thing if you had. But surely you do\r\nnot think that these dead souls are in the least worth keeping?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, indeed! Why should they be worth keeping? I am sure they are\r\nnot so. The only thing which troubles me is the fact that they are\r\nDEAD."\r\n\r\n"She seems a truly obstinate old woman!" was Chichikov\'s inward comment.\r\n"Look here, madam," he added aloud. "You reason well, but you are simply\r\nruining yourself by continuing to pay the tax upon dead souls as though\r\nthey were still alive."\r\n\r\n"Oh, good sir, do not speak of it!" the lady exclaimed. "Three weeks ago\r\nI took a hundred and fifty roubles to that Assessor, and buttered him\r\nup, and--"\r\n\r\n"Then you see how it is, do you not? Remember that, according to my\r\nplan, you will never again have to butter up the Assessor, seeing that\r\nit will be I who will be paying for those peasants--_I_, not YOU, for I\r\nshall have taken over the dues upon them, and have transferred them to\r\nmyself as so many bona fide serfs. Do you understand AT LAST?"\r\n\r\nHowever, the old lady still communed with herself. She could see that\r\nthe transaction would be to her advantage, yet it was one of such a\r\nnovel and unprecedented nature that she was beginning to fear lest this\r\npurchaser of souls intended to cheat her. Certainly he had come from God\r\nonly knew where, and at the dead of night, too!\r\n\r\n"But, sir, I have never in my life sold dead folk--only living ones.\r\nThree years ago I transferred two wenches to Protopopov for a hundred\r\nroubles apiece, and he thanked me kindly, for they turned out splendid\r\nworkers--able to make napkins or anything else.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but with the living we have nothing to do, damn it! I am asking\r\nyou only about DEAD folk."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, of course. But at first sight I felt afraid lest I should be\r\nincurring a loss--lest you should be wishing to outwit me, good sir.\r\nYou see, the dead souls are worth rather more than you have offered for\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"See here, madam. (What a woman it is!) HOW could they be worth more?\r\nThink for yourself. They are so much loss to you--so much loss, do you\r\nunderstand? Take any worthless, rubbishy article you like--a piece of\r\nold rag, for example. That rag will yet fetch its price, for it can be\r\nbought for paper-making. But these dead souls are good for NOTHING AT\r\nALL. Can you name anything that they ARE good for?"\r\n\r\n"True, true--they ARE good for nothing. But what troubles me is the fact\r\nthat they are dead."\r\n\r\n"What a blockhead of a creature!" said Chichikov to himself, for he was\r\nbeginning to lose patience. "Bless her heart, I may as well be going.\r\nShe has thrown me into a perfect sweat, the cursed old shrew!"\r\n\r\nHe took a handkerchief from his pocket, and wiped the perspiration from\r\nhis brow. Yet he need not have flown into such a passion. More than one\r\nrespected statesman reveals himself, when confronted with a business\r\nmatter, to be just such another as Madam Korobotchka, in that, once he\r\nhas got an idea into his head, there is no getting it out of him--you\r\nmay ply him with daylight-clear arguments, yet they will rebound\r\nfrom his brain as an india-rubber ball rebounds from a flagstone.\r\nNevertheless, wiping away the perspiration, Chichikov resolved to try\r\nwhether he could not bring her back to the road by another path.\r\n\r\n"Madam," he said, "either you are declining to understand what I say or\r\nyou are talking for the mere sake of talking. If I hand you over some\r\nmoney--fifteen roubles for each soul, do you understand?--it is MONEY,\r\nnot something which can be picked up haphazard on the street. For\r\ninstance, tell me how much you sold your honey for?"\r\n\r\n"For twelve roubles per pood."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Then by those words, madam, you have laid a trifling sin upon your\r\nsoul; for you did NOT sell the honey for twelve roubles."\r\n\r\n"By the Lord God I did!"\r\n\r\n"Well, well! Never mind. Honey is only honey. Now, you had collected\r\nthat stuff, it may be, for a year, and with infinite care and labour.\r\nYou had fussed after it, you had trotted to and fro, you had duly frozen\r\nout the bees, and you had fed them in the cellar throughout the winter.\r\nBut these dead souls of which I speak are quite another matter, for in\r\nthis case you have put forth no exertions--it was merely God\'s will that\r\nthey should leave the world, and thus decrease the personnel of your\r\nestablishment. In the former case you received (so you allege) twelve\r\nroubles per pood for your labour; but in this case you will receive\r\nmoney for having done nothing at all. Nor will you receive twelve\r\nroubles per item, but FIFTEEN--and roubles not in silver, but roubles in\r\ngood paper currency."\r\n\r\nThat these powerful inducements would certainly cause the old woman to\r\nyield Chichikov had not a doubt.\r\n\r\n"True," his hostess replied. "But how strangely business comes to me as\r\na widow! Perhaps I had better wait a little longer, seeing that other\r\nbuyers might come along, and I might be able to compare prices."\r\n\r\n"For shame, madam! For shame! Think what you are saying. Who else, I\r\nwould ask, would care to buy those souls? What use could they be to any\r\none?"\r\n\r\n"If that is so, they might come in useful to ME," mused the old woman\r\naloud; after which she sat staring at Chichikov with her mouth open and\r\na face of nervous expectancy as to his possible rejoinder.\r\n\r\n"Dead folk useful in a household!" he exclaimed. "Why, what could you do\r\nwith them? Set them up on poles to frighten away the sparrows from your\r\ngarden?"\r\n\r\n"The Lord save us, but what things you say!" she ejaculated, crossing\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n"Well, WHAT could you do with them? By this time they are so much bones\r\nand earth. That is all there is left of them. Their transfer to myself\r\nwould be ON PAPER only. Come, come! At least give me an answer."\r\n\r\nAgain the old woman communed with herself.\r\n\r\n"What are you thinking of, Nastasia Petrovna?" inquired Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"I am thinking that I scarcely know what to do. Perhaps I had better\r\nsell you some hemp?"\r\n\r\n"What do I want with hemp? Pardon me, but just when I have made to you\r\na different proposal altogether you begin fussing about hemp! Hemp is\r\nhemp, and though I may want some when I NEXT visit you, I should like to\r\nknow what you have to say to the suggestion under discussion."\r\n\r\n"Well, I think it a very queer bargain. Never have I heard of such a\r\nthing."\r\n\r\nUpon this Chichikov lost all patience, upset his chair, and bid her go\r\nto the devil; of which personage even the mere mention terrified her\r\nextremely.\r\n\r\n"Do not speak of him, I beg of you!" she cried, turning pale. "May God,\r\nrather, bless him! Last night was the third night that he has appeared\r\nto me in a dream. You see, after saying my prayers, I bethought me\r\nof telling my fortune by the cards; and God must have sent him as a\r\npunishment. He looked so horrible, and had horns longer than a bull\'s!"\r\n\r\n"I wonder you don\'t see SCORES of devils in your dreams! Merely out of\r\nChristian charity he had come to you to say, \'I perceive a poor widow\r\ngoing to rack and ruin, and likely soon to stand in danger of want.\'\r\nWell, go to rack and ruin--yes, you and all your village together!"\r\n\r\n"The insults!" exclaimed the old woman, glancing at her visitor in\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n"I should think so!" continued Chichikov. "Indeed, I cannot find words\r\nto describe you. To say no more about it, you are like a dog in a\r\nmanger. You don\'t want to eat the hay yourself, yet you won\'t let\r\nanyone else touch it. All that I am seeking to do is to purchase\r\ncertain domestic products of yours, for the reason that I have certain\r\nGovernment contracts to fulfil." This last he added in passing, and\r\nwithout any ulterior motive, save that it came to him as a happy\r\nthought. Nevertheless the mention of Government contracts exercised a\r\npowerful influence upon Nastasia Petrovna, and she hastened to say in a\r\ntone that was almost supplicatory:\r\n\r\n"Why should you be so angry with me? Had I known that you were going to\r\nlose your temper in this way, I should never have discussed the matter."\r\n\r\n"No wonder that I lose my temper! An egg too many is no great matter,\r\nyet it may prove exceedingly annoying."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, I will let you have the souls for fifteen roubles each.\r\nAlso, with regard to those contracts, do not forget me if at any time\r\nyou should find yourself in need of rye-meal or buckwheat or groats or\r\ndead meat."\r\n\r\n"No, I shall NEVER forget you, madam!" he said, wiping his forehead,\r\nwhere three separate streams of perspiration were trickling down his\r\nface. Then he asked her whether in the town she had any acquaintance or\r\nagent whom she could empower to complete the transference of the serfs,\r\nand to carry out whatsoever else might be necessary.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," replied Madame Korobotchka. "The son of our archpriest,\r\nFather Cyril, himself is a lawyer."\r\n\r\nUpon that Chichikov begged her to accord the gentleman in question a\r\npower of attorney, while, to save extra trouble, he himself would then\r\nand there compose the requisite letter.\r\n\r\n"It would be a fine thing if he were to buy up all my meal and stock\r\nfor the Government," thought Madame to herself. "I must encourage him a\r\nlittle. There has been some dough standing ready since last night, so I\r\nwill go and tell Fetinia to try a few pancakes. Also, it might be well\r\nto try him with an egg pie. We make then nicely here, and they do not\r\ntake long in the making."\r\n\r\nSo she departed to translate her thoughts into action, as well as to\r\nsupplement the pie with other products of the domestic cuisine; while,\r\nfor his part, Chichikov returned to the drawing-room where he had spent\r\nthe night, in order to procure from his dispatch-box the necessary\r\nwriting-paper. The room had now been set in order, the sumptuous\r\nfeather bed removed, and a table set before the sofa. Depositing his\r\ndispatch-box upon the table, he heaved a gentle sigh on becoming aware\r\nthat he was so soaked with perspiration that he might almost have\r\nbeen dipped in a river. Everything, from his shirt to his socks,\r\nwas dripping. "May she starve to death, the cursed old harridan!" he\r\nejaculated after a moment\'s rest. Then he opened his dispatch-box. In\r\npassing, I may say that I feel certain that at least SOME of my readers\r\nwill be curious to know the contents and the internal arrangements of\r\nthat receptacle. Why should I not gratify their curiosity? To begin\r\nwith, the centre of the box contained a soap-dish, with, disposed around\r\nit, six or seven compartments for razors. Next came square partitions\r\nfor a sand-box [17] and an inkstand, as well as (scooped out in their\r\nmidst) a hollow of pens, sealing-wax, and anything else that required\r\nmore room. Lastly there were all sorts of little divisions, both with\r\nand without lids, for articles of a smaller nature, such as visiting\r\ncards, memorial cards, theatre tickets, and things which Chichikov had\r\nlaid by as souvenirs. This portion of the box could be taken out, and\r\nbelow it were both a space for manuscripts and a secret money-box--the\r\nlatter made to draw out from the side of the receptacle.\r\n\r\nChichikov set to work to clean a pen, and then to write. Presently his\r\nhostess entered the room.\r\n\r\n"What a beautiful box you have got, my dear sir!" she exclaimed as she\r\ntook a seat beside him. "Probably you bought it in Moscow?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--in Moscow," replied Chichikov without interrupting his writing.\r\n\r\n"I thought so. One CAN get good things there. Three years ago my sister\r\nbrought me a few pairs of warm shoes for my sons, and they were such\r\nexcellent articles! To this day my boys wear them. And what nice stamped\r\npaper you have!" (she had peered into the dispatch-box, where, sure\r\nenough, there lay a further store of the paper in question). "Would you\r\nmind letting me have a sheet of it? I am without any at all, although I\r\nshall soon have to be presenting a plea to the land court, and possess\r\nnot a morsel of paper to write it on."\r\n\r\nUpon this Chichikov explained that the paper was not the sort proper\r\nfor the purpose--that it was meant for serf-indenturing, and not for\r\nthe framing of pleas. Nevertheless, to quiet her, he gave her a sheet\r\nstamped to the value of a rouble. Next, he handed her the letter to\r\nsign, and requested, in return, a list of her peasants. Unfortunately,\r\nsuch a list had never been compiled, let alone any copies of it, and the\r\nonly way in which she knew the peasants\' names was by heart. However, he\r\ntold her to dictate them. Some of the names greatly astonished our hero,\r\nso, still more, did the surnames. Indeed, frequently, on hearing the\r\nlatter, he had to pause before writing them down. Especially did he halt\r\nbefore a certain "Peter Saveliev Neuvazhai Korito." "What a string of\r\ntitles!" involuntarily he ejaculated. To the Christian name of another\r\nserf was appended "Korovi Kirpitch," and to that of a third "Koleso\r\nIvan." However, at length the list was compiled, and he caught a deep\r\nbreath; which latter proceeding caused him to catch also the attractive\r\nodour of something fried in fat.\r\n\r\n"I beseech you to have a morsel," murmured his hostess. Chichikov looked\r\nup, and saw that the table was spread with mushrooms, pies, and other\r\nviands.\r\n\r\n"Try this freshly-made pie and an egg," continued Madame.\r\n\r\nChichikov did so, and having eaten more than half of what she offered\r\nhim, praised the pie highly. Indeed, it was a toothsome dish, and, after\r\nhis difficulties and exertions with his hostess, it tasted even better\r\nthan it might otherwise have done.\r\n\r\n"And also a few pancakes?" suggested Madame.\r\n\r\nFor answer Chichikov folded three together, and, having dipped them in\r\nmelted butter, consigned the lot to his mouth, and then wiped his\r\nmouth with a napkin. Twice more was the process repeated, and then\r\nhe requested his hostess to order the britchka to be got ready. In\r\ndispatching Fetinia with the necessary instructions, she ordered her to\r\nreturn with a second batch of hot pancakes.\r\n\r\n"Your pancakes are indeed splendid," said Chichikov, applying himself to\r\nthe second consignment of fried dainties when they had arrived.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we make them well here," replied Madame. "Yet how unfortunate it\r\nis that the harvest should have proved so poor as to have prevented me\r\nfrom earning anything on my--But why should you be in such a hurry to\r\ndepart, good sir?" She broke off on seeing Chichikov reach for his cap.\r\n"The britchka is not yet ready."\r\n\r\n"Then it is being got so, madam, it is being got so, and I shall need a\r\nmoment or two to pack my things."\r\n\r\n"As you please, dear sir; but do not forget me in connection with those\r\nGovernment contracts."\r\n\r\n"No, I have said that NEVER shall I forget you," replied Chichikov as he\r\nhurried into the hall.\r\n\r\n"And would you like to buy some lard?" continued his hostess, pursuing\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Lard? Oh certainly. Why not? Only, only--I will do so ANOTHER time."\r\n\r\n"I shall have some ready at about Christmas."\r\n\r\n"Quite so, madam. THEN I will buy anything and everything--the lard\r\nincluded."\r\n\r\n"And perhaps you will be wanting also some feathers? I shall be having\r\nsome for sale about St. Philip\'s Day."\r\n\r\n"Very well, very well, madam."\r\n\r\n"There you see!" she remarked as they stepped out on to the verandah.\r\n"The britchka is NOT yet ready."\r\n\r\n"But it soon will be, it soon will be. Only direct me to the main road."\r\n\r\n"How am I to do that?" said Madame. "\'Twould puzzle a wise man to do so,\r\nfor in these parts there are so many turnings. However, I will send a\r\ngirl to guide you. You could find room for her on the box-seat, could\r\nyou not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course."\r\n\r\n"Then I will send her. She knows the way thoroughly. Only do not carry\r\nher off for good. Already some traders have deprived me of one of my\r\ngirls."\r\n\r\nChichikov reassured his hostess on the point, and Madame plucked up\r\ncourage enough to scan, first of all, the housekeeper, who happened to\r\nbe issuing from the storehouse with a bowl of honey, and, next, a\r\nyoung peasant who happened to be standing at the gates; and, while thus\r\nengaged, she became wholly absorbed in her domestic pursuits. But\r\nwhy pay her so much attention? The Widow Korobotchka, Madame Manilov,\r\ndomestic life, non-domestic life--away with them all! How strangely are\r\nthings compounded! In a trice may joy turn to sorrow, should one halt\r\nlong enough over it: in a trice only God can say what ideas may strike\r\none. You may fall even to thinking: "After all, did Madame Korobotchka\r\nstand so very low in the scale of human perfection? Was there really\r\nsuch a very great gulf between her and Madame Manilov--between her and\r\nthe Madame Manilov whom we have seen entrenched behind the walls of a\r\ngenteel mansion in which there were a fine staircase of wrought metal\r\nand a number of rich carpets; the Madame Manilov who spent most of her\r\ntime in yawning behind half-read books, and in hoping for a visit from\r\nsome socially distinguished person in order that she might display her\r\nwit and carefully rehearsed thoughts--thoughts which had been de rigeur\r\nin town for a week past, yet which referred, not to what was going on\r\nin her household or on her estate--both of which properties were at odds\r\nand ends, owing to her ignorance of the art of managing them--but to\r\nthe coming political revolution in France and the direction in which\r\nfashionable Catholicism was supposed to be moving? But away with such\r\nthings! Why need we speak of them? Yet how comes it that suddenly into\r\nthe midst of our careless, frivolous, unthinking moments there may enter\r\nanother, and a very different, tendency?--that the smile may not have\r\nleft a human face before its owner will have radically changed his or\r\nher nature (though not his or her environment) with the result that\r\nthe face will suddenly become lit with a radiance never before seen\r\nthere?...\r\n\r\n"Here is the britchka, here is the britchka!" exclaimed Chichikov on\r\nperceiving that vehicle slowly advancing. "Ah, you blockhead!" he\r\nwent on to Selifan. "Why have you been loitering about? I suppose last\r\nnight\'s fumes have not yet left your brain?"\r\n\r\nTo this Selifan returned no reply.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, madam," added the speaker. "But where is the girl whom you\r\npromised me?"\r\n\r\n"Here, Pelagea!" called the hostess to a wench of about eleven who was\r\ndressed in home-dyed garments and could boast of a pair of bare feet\r\nwhich, from a distance, might almost have been mistaken for boots, so\r\nencrusted were they with fresh mire. "Here, Pelagea! Come and show this\r\ngentleman the way."\r\n\r\nSelifan helped the girl to ascend to the box-seat. Placing one foot upon\r\nthe step by which the gentry mounted, she covered the said step with\r\nmud, and then, ascending higher, attained the desired position beside\r\nthe coachman. Chichikov followed in her wake (causing the britchka to\r\nheel over with his weight as he did so), and then settled himself back\r\ninto his place with an "All right! Good-bye, madam!" as the horses moved\r\naway at a trot.\r\n\r\nSelifan looked gloomy as he drove, but also very attentive to his\r\nbusiness. This was invariably his custom when he had committed the fault\r\nof getting drunk. Also, the horses looked unusually well-groomed. In\r\nparticular, the collar on one of them had been neatly mended, although\r\nhitherto its state of dilapidation had been such as perennially to allow\r\nthe stuffing to protrude through the leather. The silence preserved was\r\nwell-nigh complete. Merely flourishing his whip, Selifan spoke to the\r\nteam no word of instruction, although the skewbald was as ready as usual\r\nto listen to conversation of a didactic nature, seeing that at such\r\ntimes the reins hung loosely in the hands of the loquacious driver,\r\nand the whip wandered merely as a matter of form over the backs of the\r\ntroika. This time, however, there could be heard issuing from Selifan\'s\r\nsullen lips only the uniformly unpleasant exclamation, "Now then, you\r\nbrutes! Get on with you, get on with you!" The bay and the Assessor too\r\nfelt put out at not hearing themselves called "my pets" or "good lads";\r\nwhile, in addition, the skewbald came in for some nasty cuts across his\r\nsleek and ample quarters. "What has put master out like this?" thought\r\nthe animal as it shook its head. "Heaven knows where he does not keep\r\nbeating me--across the back, and even where I am tenderer still. Yes, he\r\nkeeps catching the whip in my ears, and lashing me under the belly."\r\n\r\n"To the right, eh?" snapped Selifan to the girl beside him as he pointed\r\nto a rain-soaked road which trended away through fresh green fields.\r\n\r\n"No, no," she replied. "I will show you the road when the time comes."\r\n\r\n"Which way, then?" he asked again when they had proceeded a little\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n"This way." And she pointed to the road just mentioned.\r\n\r\n"Get along with you!" retorted the coachman. "That DOES go to the right.\r\nYou don\'t know your right hand from your left."\r\n\r\nThe weather was fine, but the ground so excessively sodden that the\r\nwheels of the britchka collected mire until they had become caked as\r\nwith a layer of felt, a circumstance which greatly increased the weight\r\nof the vehicle, and prevented it from clearing the neighbouring parishes\r\nbefore the afternoon was arrived. Also, without the girl\'s help the\r\nfinding of the way would have been impossible, since roads wiggled away\r\nin every direction, like crabs released from a net, and, but for the\r\nassistance mentioned, Selifan would have found himself left to his own\r\ndevices. Presently she pointed to a building ahead, with the words,\r\n"THERE is the main road."\r\n\r\n"And what is the building?" asked Selifan.\r\n\r\n"A tavern," she said.\r\n\r\n"Then we can get along by ourselves," he observed. "Do you get down, and\r\nbe off home."\r\n\r\nWith that he stopped, and helped her to alight--muttering as he did so:\r\n"Ah, you blackfooted creature!"\r\n\r\nChichikov added a copper groat, and she departed well pleased with her\r\nride in the gentleman\'s carriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nOn reaching the tavern, Chichikov called a halt. His reasons for this\r\nwere twofold--namely, that he wanted to rest the horses, and that he\r\nhimself desired some refreshment. In this connection the author feels\r\nbound to confess that the appetite and the capacity of such men are\r\ngreatly to be envied. Of those well-to-do folk of St. Petersburg and\r\nMoscow who spend their time in considering what they shall eat on the\r\nmorrow, and in composing a dinner for the day following, and who never\r\nsit down to a meal without first of all injecting a pill and then\r\nswallowing oysters and crabs and a quantity of other monsters, while\r\neternally departing for Karlsbad or the Caucasus, the author has but a\r\nsmall opinion. Yes, THEY are not the persons to inspire envy. Rather,\r\nit is the folk of the middle classes--folk who at one posthouse call for\r\nbacon, and at another for a sucking pig, and at a third for a steak of\r\nsturgeon or a baked pudding with onions, and who can sit down to table\r\nat any hour, as though they had never had a meal in their lives, and\r\ncan devour fish of all sorts, and guzzle and chew it with a view\r\nto provoking further appetite--these, I say, are the folk who enjoy\r\nheaven\'s most favoured gift. To attain such a celestial condition the\r\ngreat folk of whom I have spoken would sacrifice half their serfs and\r\nhalf their mortgaged and non-mortgaged property, with the foreign and\r\ndomestic improvements thereon, if thereby they could compass such\r\na stomach as is possessed by the folk of the middle class. But,\r\nunfortunately, neither money nor real estate, whether improved or\r\nnon-improved, can purchase such a stomach.\r\n\r\nThe little wooden tavern, with its narrow, but hospitable, curtain\r\nsuspended from a pair of rough-hewn doorposts like old church\r\ncandlesticks, seemed to invite Chichikov to enter. True, the\r\nestablishment was only a Russian hut of the ordinary type, but it was\r\na hut of larger dimensions than usual, and had around its windows and\r\ngables carved and patterned cornices of bright-coloured wood which threw\r\ninto relief the darker hue of the walls, and consorted well with the\r\nflowered pitchers painted on the shutters.\r\n\r\nAscending the narrow wooden staircase to the upper floor, and arriving\r\nupon a broad landing, Chichikov found himself confronted with a creaking\r\ndoor and a stout old woman in a striped print gown. "This way, if you\r\nplease," she said. Within the apartment designated Chichikov\r\nencountered the old friends which one invariably finds in such roadside\r\nhostelries--to wit, a heavy samovar, four smooth, bescratched walls of\r\nwhite pine, a three-cornered press with cups and teapots, egg-cups\r\nof gilded china standing in front of ikons suspended by blue and red\r\nribands, a cat lately delivered of a family, a mirror which gives one\r\nfour eyes instead of two and a pancake for a face, and, beside the\r\nikons, some bunches of herbs and carnations of such faded dustiness\r\nthat, should one attempt to smell them, one is bound to burst out\r\nsneezing.\r\n\r\n"Have you a sucking-pig?" Chichikov inquired of the landlady as she\r\nstood expectantly before him.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And some horse-radish and sour cream?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Then serve them."\r\n\r\nThe landlady departed for the purpose, and returned with a plate, a\r\nnapkin (the latter starched to the consistency of dried bark), a knife\r\nwith a bone handle beginning to turn yellow, a two-pronged fork as thin\r\nas a wafer, and a salt-cellar incapable of being made to stand upright.\r\n\r\nFollowing the accepted custom, our hero entered into conversation with\r\nthe woman, and inquired whether she herself or a landlord kept the\r\ntavern; how much income the tavern brought in; whether her sons lived\r\nwith her; whether the oldest was a bachelor or married; whom the\r\neldest had taken to wife; whether the dowry had been large; whether the\r\nfather-in-law had been satisfied, and whether the said father-in-law\r\nhad not complained of receiving too small a present at the wedding.\r\nIn short, Chichikov touched on every conceivable point. Likewise\r\n(of course) he displayed some curiosity as to the landowners of the\r\nneighbourhood. Their names, he ascertained, were Blochin, Potchitaev,\r\nMinoi, Cheprakov, and Sobakevitch.\r\n\r\n"Then you are acquainted with Sobakevitch?" he said; whereupon the old\r\nwoman informed him that she knew not only Sobakevitch, but also Manilov,\r\nand that the latter was the more delicate eater of the two, since,\r\nwhereas Manilov always ordered a roast fowl and some veal and mutton,\r\nand then tasted merely a morsel of each, Sobakevitch would order one\r\ndish only, but consume the whole of it, and then demand more at the same\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nWhilst Chichikov was thus conversing and partaking of the sucking pig\r\nuntil only a fragment of it seemed likely to remain, the sound of an\r\napproaching vehicle made itself heard. Peering through the window, he\r\nsaw draw up to the tavern door a light britchka drawn by three fine\r\nhorses. From it there descended two men--one flaxen-haired and tall, and\r\nthe other dark-haired and of slighter build. While the flaxen-haired\r\nman was clad in a dark-blue coat, the other one was wrapped in a coat\r\nof striped pattern. Behind the britchka stood a second, but an empty,\r\nturn-out, drawn by four long-coated steeds in ragged collars and\r\nrope harnesses. The flaxen-haired man lost no time in ascending the\r\nstaircase, while his darker friend remained below to fumble at something\r\nin the britchka, talking, as he did so, to the driver of the vehicle\r\nwhich stood hitched behind. Somehow, the dark-haired man\'s voice struck\r\nChichikov as familiar; and as he was taking another look at him the\r\nflaxen-haired gentleman entered the room. The newcomer was a man of\r\nlofty stature, with a small red moustache and a lean, hard-bitten face\r\nwhose redness made it evident that its acquaintance, if not with the\r\nsmoke of gunpowder, at all events with that of tobacco, was intimate\r\nand extensive. Nevertheless he greeted Chichikov civilly, and the latter\r\nreturned his bow. Indeed, the pair would have entered into conversation,\r\nand have made one another\'s acquaintance (since a beginning was made\r\nwith their simultaneously expressing satisfaction at the circumstance\r\nthat the previous night\'s rain had laid the dust on the roads,\r\nand thereby made driving cool and pleasant) when the gentleman\'s\r\ndarker-favoured friend also entered the room, and, throwing his cap upon\r\nthe table, pushed back a mass of dishevelled black locks from his brow.\r\nThe latest arrival was a man of medium height, but well put together,\r\nand possessed of a pair of full red cheeks, a set of teeth as white as\r\nsnow, and coal-black whiskers. Indeed, so fresh was his complexion that\r\nit seemed to have been compounded of blood and milk, while health danced\r\nin his every feature.\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, ha!" he cried with a gesture of astonishment at the sight of\r\nChichikov. "What chance brings YOU here?"\r\n\r\nUpon that Chichikov recognised Nozdrev--the man whom he had met at\r\ndinner at the Public Prosecutor\'s, and who, within a minute or two of\r\nthe introduction, had become so intimate with his fellow guest as to\r\naddress him in the second person singular, in spite of the fact that\r\nChichikov had given him no opportunity for doing so.\r\n\r\n"Where have you been to-day?" Nozdrev inquired, and, without waiting for\r\nan answer, went on: "For myself, I am just from the fair, and completely\r\ncleaned out. Actually, I have had to do the journey back with stage\r\nhorses! Look out of the window, and see them for yourself." And he\r\nturned Chichikov\'s head so sharply in the desired direction that he came\r\nvery near to bumping it against the window frame. "Did you ever see such\r\na bag of tricks? The cursed things have only just managed to get here.\r\nIn fact, on the way I had to transfer myself to this fellow\'s britchka."\r\nHe indicated his companion with a finger. "By the way, don\'t you know\r\none another? He is Mizhuev, my brother-in-law. He and I were talking of\r\nyou only this morning. \'Just you see,\' said I to him, \'if we do not fall\r\nin with Chichikov before we have done.\' Heavens, how completely cleaned\r\nout I am! Not only have I lost four good horses, but also my watch and\r\nchain." Chichikov perceived that in very truth his interlocutor was\r\nminus the articles named, as well as that one of Nozdrev\'s whiskers was\r\nless bushy in appearance than the other one. "Had I had another twenty\r\nroubles in my pocket," went on Nozdrev, "I should have won back all that\r\nI have lost, as well as have pouched a further thirty thousand. Yes, I\r\ngive you my word of honour on that."\r\n\r\n"But you were saying the same thing when last I met you," put in the\r\nflaxen-haired man. "Yet, even though I lent you fifty roubles, you lost\r\nthem all."\r\n\r\n"But I should not have lost them THIS time. Don\'t try to make me out\r\na fool. I should NOT have lost them, I tell you. Had I only played the\r\nright card, I should have broken the bank."\r\n\r\n"But you did NOT break the bank," remarked the flaxen-haired man.\r\n\r\n"No. That was because I did not play my cards right. But what about your\r\nprecious major\'s play? Is THAT good?"\r\n\r\n"Good or not, at least he beat you."\r\n\r\n"Splendid of him! Nevertheless I will get my own back. Let him play me\r\nat doubles, and we shall soon see what sort of a player he is!\r\nFriend Chichikov, at first we had a glorious time, for the fair was a\r\ntremendous success. Indeed, the tradesmen said that never yet had there\r\nbeen such a gathering. I myself managed to sell everything from my\r\nestate at a good price. In fact, we had a magnificent time. I can\'t help\r\nthinking of it, devil take me! But what a pity YOU were not there! Three\r\nversts from the town there is quartered a regiment of dragoons, and you\r\nwould scarcely believe what a lot of officers it has. Forty at least\r\nthere are, and they do a fine lot of knocking about the town and\r\ndrinking. In particular, Staff-Captain Potsieluev is a SPLENDID fellow!\r\nYou should just see his moustache! Why, he calls good claret \'trash\'!\r\n\'Bring me some of the usual trash,\' is his way of ordering it. And\r\nLieutenant Kuvshinnikov, too! He is as delightful as the other man. In\r\nfact, I may say that every one of the lot is a rake. I spent my whole\r\ntime with them, and you can imagine that Ponomarev, the wine merchant,\r\ndid a fine trade indeed! All the same, he is a rascal, you know, and\r\nought not to be dealt with, for he puts all sorts of rubbish into his\r\nliquor--Indian wood and burnt cork and elderberry juice, the villain!\r\nNevertheless, get him to produce a bottle from what he calls his\r\n\'special cellar,\' and you will fancy yourself in the seventh heaven of\r\ndelight. And what quantities of champagne we drank! Compared with it,\r\nprovincial stuff is kvass [18]. Try to imagine not merely Clicquot, but\r\na sort of blend of Clicquot and Matradura--Clicquot of double strength.\r\nAlso Ponomarev produced a bottle of French stuff which he calls\r\n\'Bonbon.\' Had it a bouquet, ask you? Why, it had the bouquet of a rose\r\ngarden, of anything else you like. What times we had, to be sure! Just\r\nafter we had left Pnomarev\'s place, some prince or another arrived in\r\nthe town, and sent out for some champagne; but not a bottle was there\r\nleft, for the officers had drunk every one! Why, I myself got through\r\nseventeen bottles at a sitting."\r\n\r\n"Come, come! You CAN\'T have got through seventeen," remarked the\r\nflaxen-haired man.\r\n\r\n"But I did, I give my word of honour," retorted Nozdrev.\r\n\r\n"Imagine what you like, but you didn\'t drink even TEN bottles at a\r\nsitting."\r\n\r\n"Will you bet that I did not?"\r\n\r\n"No; for what would be the use of betting about it?"\r\n\r\n"Then at least wager the gun which you have bought."\r\n\r\n"No, I am not going to do anything of the kind."\r\n\r\n"Just as an experiment?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"It is as well for you that you don\'t, since, otherwise, you would have\r\nfound yourself minus both gun and cap. However, friend Chichikov, it\r\nis a pity you were not there. Had you been there, I feel sure you would\r\nhave found yourself unable to part with Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov. You and\r\nhe would have hit it off splendidly. You know, he is quite a\r\ndifferent sort from the Public Prosecutor and our other provincial\r\nskinflints--fellows who shiver in their shoes before they will spend a\r\nsingle kopeck. HE will play faro, or anything else, and at any time.\r\nWhy did you not come with us, instead of wasting your time on cattle\r\nbreeding or something of the sort? But never mind. Embrace me. I like\r\nyou immensely. Mizhuev, see how curiously things have turned out.\r\nChichikov has nothing to do with me, or I with him, yet here is he come\r\nfrom God knows where, and landed in the very spot where I happen to be\r\nliving! I may tell you that, no matter how many carriages I possessed, I\r\nshould gamble the lot away. Recently I went in for a turn at billiards,\r\nand lost two jars of pomade, a china teapot, and a guitar. Then I staked\r\nsome more things, and, like a fool, lost them all, and six roubles in\r\naddition. What a dog is that Kuvshinnikov! He and I attended nearly\r\nevery ball in the place. In particular, there was a woman--decolletee,\r\nand such a swell! I merely thought to myself, \'The devil take her!\' but\r\nKuvshinnikov is such a wag that he sat down beside her, and began paying\r\nher strings of compliments in French. However, I did not neglect the\r\ndamsels altogether--although HE calls that sort of thing \'going in for\r\nstrawberries.\' By the way, I have a splendid piece of fish and some\r\ncaviare with me. \'Tis all I HAVE brought back! In fact it is a lucky\r\nchance that I happened to buy the stuff before my money was gone. Where\r\nare you for?"\r\n\r\n"I am about to call on a friend."\r\n\r\n"On what friend? Let him go to the devil, and come to my place instead."\r\n\r\n"I cannot, I cannot. I have business to do."\r\n\r\n"Oh, business again! I thought so!"\r\n\r\n"But I HAVE business to do--and pressing business at that."\r\n\r\n"I wager that you\'re lying. If not, tell me whom you\'re going to call\r\nupon."\r\n\r\n"Upon Sobakevitch."\r\n\r\nInstantly Nozdrev burst into a laugh compassable only by a healthy man\r\nin whose head every tooth still remains as white as sugar. By this I\r\nmean the laugh of quivering cheeks, the laugh which causes a neighbour\r\nwho is sleeping behind double doors three rooms away to leap from his\r\nbed and exclaim with distended eyes, "Hullo! Something HAS upset him!"\r\n\r\n"What is there to laugh at?" asked Chichikov, a trifle nettled; but\r\nNozdrev laughed more unrestrainedly than ever, ejaculating: "Oh, spare\r\nus all! The thing is so amusing that I shall die of it!"\r\n\r\n"I say that there is nothing to laugh at," repeated Chichikov. "It is in\r\nfulfilment of a promise that I am on my way to Sobakevitch\'s."\r\n\r\n"Then you will scarcely be glad to be alive when you\'ve got there, for\r\nhe is the veriest miser in the countryside. Oh, _I_ know you. However,\r\nif you think to find there either faro or a bottle of \'Bonbon\' you are\r\nmistaken. Look here, my good friend. Let Sobakevitch go to the devil,\r\nand come to MY place, where at least I shall have a piece of sturgeon\r\nto offer you for dinner. Ponomarev said to me on parting: \'This piece is\r\njust the thing for you. Even if you were to search the whole market, you\r\nwould never find a better one.\' But of course he is a terrible rogue.\r\nI said to him outright: \'You and the Collector of Taxes are the two\r\ngreatest skinflints in the town.\' But he only stroked his beard\r\nand smiled. Every day I used to breakfast with Kuvshinnikov in his\r\nrestaurant. Well, what I was nearly forgetting is this: that, though I\r\nam aware that you can\'t forgo your engagement, I am not going to give\r\nyou up--no, not for ten thousand roubles of money. I tell you that in\r\nadvance."\r\n\r\nHere he broke off to run to the window and shout to his servant (who was\r\nholding a knife in one hand and a crust of bread and a piece of sturgeon\r\nin the other--he had contrived to filch the latter while fumbling in the\r\nbritchka for something else):\r\n\r\n"Hi, Porphyri! Bring here that puppy, you rascal! What a puppy it is!\r\nUnfortunately that thief of a landlord has given it nothing to eat, even\r\nthough I have promised him the roan filly which, as you may remember, I\r\nswopped from Khvostirev." As a matter of act, Chichikov had never in his\r\nlife seen either Khvostirev or the roan filly.\r\n\r\n"Barin, do you wish for anything to eat?" inquired the landlady as she\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n"No, nothing at all. Ah, friend Chichikov, what times we had! Yes, give\r\nme a glass of vodka, old woman. What sort do you keep?"\r\n\r\n"Aniseed."\r\n\r\n"Then bring me a glass of it," repeated Nozdrev.\r\n\r\n"And one for me as well," added the flaxen-haired man.\r\n\r\n"At the theatre," went on Nozdrev, "there was an actress who sang like a\r\ncanary. Kuvshinnikov, who happened to be sitting with me, said: \'My boy,\r\nyou had better go and gather that strawberry.\' As for the booths at the\r\nfair, they numbered, I should say, fifty." At this point he broke off\r\nto take the glass of vodka from the landlady, who bowed low in\r\nacknowledgement of his doing so. At the same moment Porphyri--a\r\nfellow dressed like his master (that is to say, in a greasy, wadded\r\novercoat)--entered with the puppy.\r\n\r\n"Put the brute down here," commanded Nozdrev, "and then fasten it up."\r\n\r\nPorphyri deposited the animal upon the floor; whereupon it proceeded to\r\nact after the manner of dogs.\r\n\r\n"THERE\'S a puppy for you!" cried Nozdrev, catching hold of it by the\r\nback, and lifting it up. The puppy uttered a piteous yelp.\r\n\r\n"I can see that you haven\'t done what I told you to do," he continued\r\nto Porphyri after an inspection of the animal\'s belly. "You have quite\r\nforgotten to brush him."\r\n\r\n"I DID brush him," protested Porphyri.\r\n\r\n"Then where did these fleas come from?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot think. Perhaps they have leapt into his coat out of the\r\nbritchka."\r\n\r\n"You liar! As a matter of fact, you have forgotten to brush him.\r\nNevertheless, look at these ears, Chichikov. Just feel them."\r\n\r\n"Why should I? Without doing that, I can see that he is well-bred."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, catch hold of his ears and feel them."\r\n\r\nTo humour the fellow Chichikov did as he had requested, remarking: "Yes,\r\nhe seems likely to turn out well."\r\n\r\n"And feel the coldness of his nose! Just take it in your hand."\r\n\r\nNot wishing to offend his interlocutor, Chichikov felt the puppy\'s nose,\r\nsaying: "Some day he will have an excellent scent."\r\n\r\n"Yes, will he not? \'Tis the right sort of muzzle for that. I must say\r\nthat I have long been wanting such a puppy. Porphyri, take him away\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nPorphyri lifted up the puppy, and bore it downstairs.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Chichikov," resumed Nozdrev. "You MUST come to my place. It\r\nlies only five versts away, and we can go there like the wind, and you\r\ncan visit Sobakevitch afterwards."\r\n\r\n"Shall I, or shall I not, go to Nozdrev\'s?" reflected Chichikov. "Is he\r\nlikely to prove any more useful than the rest? Well, at least he is as\r\npromising, even though he has lost so much at play. But he has a head on\r\nhis shoulders, and therefore I must go carefully if I am to tackle him\r\nconcerning my scheme."\r\n\r\nWith that he added aloud: "Very well, I WILL come with you, but do not\r\nlet us be long, for my time is very precious."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, that\'s right!" cried Nozdrev. "Splendid, splendid! Let me\r\nembrace you!" And he fell upon Chichikov\'s neck. "All three of us will\r\ngo."\r\n\r\n"No, no," put in the flaxen-haired man. "You must excuse me, for I must\r\nbe off home."\r\n\r\n"Rubbish, rubbish! I am NOT going to excuse you."\r\n\r\n"But my wife will be furious with me. You and Monsieur Chichikov must\r\nchange into the other britchka."\r\n\r\n"Come, come! The thing is not to be thought of."\r\n\r\nThe flaxen-haired man was one of those people in whose character, at\r\nfirst sight, there seems to lurk a certain grain of stubbornness--so\r\nmuch so that, almost before one has begun to speak, they are ready to\r\ndispute one\'s words, and to disagree with anything that may be opposed\r\nto their peculiar form of opinion. For instance, they will decline to\r\nhave folly called wisdom, or any tune danced to but their own. Always,\r\nhowever, will there become manifest in their character a soft spot, and\r\nin the end they will accept what hitherto they have denied, and call\r\nwhat is foolish sensible, and even dance--yes, better than any one else\r\nwill do--to a tune set by some one else. In short, they generally begin\r\nwell, but always end badly.\r\n\r\n"Rubbish!" said Nozdrev in answer to a further objection on his\r\nbrother-in-law\'s part. And, sure enough, no sooner had Nozdrev clapped\r\nhis cap upon his head than the flaxen-haired man started to follow him\r\nand his companion.\r\n\r\n"But the gentleman has not paid for the vodka?" put in the old woman.\r\n\r\n"All right, all right, good mother. Look here, brother-in-law. Pay her,\r\nwill you, for I have not a kopeck left."\r\n\r\n"How much?" inquired the brother-in-law.\r\n\r\n"What, sir? Eighty kopecks, if you please," replied the old woman.\r\n\r\n"A lie! Give her half a rouble. That will be quite enough."\r\n\r\n"No, it will NOT, barin," protested the old woman. However, she took the\r\nmoney gratefully, and even ran to the door to open it for the gentlemen.\r\nAs a matter of fact, she had lost nothing by the transaction, since she\r\nhad demanded fully a quarter more than the vodka was worth.\r\n\r\nThe travellers then took their seats, and since Chichikov\'s britchka\r\nkept alongside the britchka wherein Nozdrev and his brother-in-law were\r\nseated, it was possible for all three men to converse together as they\r\nproceeded. Behind them came Nozdrev\'s smaller buggy, with its team\r\nof lean stage horses and Porphyri and the puppy. But inasmuch as the\r\nconversation which the travellers maintained was not of a kind likely\r\nto interest the reader, I might do worse than say something concerning\r\nNozdrev himself, seeing that he is destined to play no small role in our\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nNozdrev\'s face will be familiar to the reader, seeing that every one\r\nmust have encountered many such. Fellows of the kind are known as\r\n"gay young sparks," and, even in their boyhood and school days, earn a\r\nreputation for being bons camarades (though with it all they come in for\r\nsome hard knocks) for the reason that their faces evince an element of\r\nfrankness, directness, and enterprise which enables them soon to make\r\nfriends, and, almost before you have had time to look around, to start\r\naddressing you in the second person singular. Yet, while cementing such\r\nfriendships for all eternity, almost always they begin quarrelling the\r\nsame evening, since, throughout, they are a loquacious, dissipated,\r\nhigh-spirited, over-showy tribe. Indeed, at thirty-five Nozdrev was just\r\nwhat he had been an eighteen and twenty--he was just such a lover of\r\nfast living. Nor had his marriage in any way changed him, and the less\r\nso since his wife had soon departed to another world, and left behind\r\nher two children, whom he did not want, and who were therefore placed\r\nin the charge of a good-looking nursemaid. Never at any time could he\r\nremain at home for more than a single day, for his keen scent could\r\nrange over scores and scores of versts, and detect any fair which\r\npromised balls and crowds. Consequently in a trice he would be\r\nthere--quarrelling, and creating disturbances over the gaming-table\r\n(like all men of his type, he had a perfect passion for cards) yet\r\nplaying neither a faultless nor an over-clean game, since he was both\r\na blunderer and able to indulge in a large number of illicit cuts and\r\nother devices. The result was that the game often ended in another kind\r\nof sport altogether. That is to say, either he received a good kicking,\r\nor he had his thick and very handsome whiskers pulled; with the result\r\nthat on certain occasions he returned home with one of those appendages\r\nlooking decidedly ragged. Yet his plump, healthy-looking cheeks were\r\nso robustly constituted, and contained such an abundance of recreative\r\nvigour, that a new whisker soon sprouted in place of the old one, and\r\neven surpassed its predecessor. Again (and the following is a phenomenon\r\npeculiar to Russia) a very short time would have elapsed before once\r\nmore he would be consorting with the very cronies who had recently\r\ncuffed him--and consorting with them as though nothing whatsoever had\r\nhappened--no reference to the subject being made by him, and they too\r\nholding their tongues.\r\n\r\nIn short, Nozdrev was, as it were, a man of incident. Never was he\r\npresent at any gathering without some sort of a fracas occurring\r\nthereat. Either he would require to be expelled from the room by\r\ngendarmes, or his friends would have to kick him out into the street. At\r\nall events, should neither of those occurrences take place, at least he\r\ndid something of a nature which would not otherwise have been witnessed.\r\nThat is to say, should he not play the fool in a buffet to such an\r\nextent as to make every one smile, you may be sure that he was engaged in\r\nlying to a degree which at times abashed even himself. Moreover, the man\r\nlied without reason. For instance, he would begin telling a story to the\r\neffect that he possessed a blue-coated or a red-coated horse; until,\r\nin the end, his listeners would be forced to leave him with the remark,\r\n"You are giving us some fine stuff, old fellow!" Also, men like Nozdrev\r\nhave a passion for insulting their neighbours without the least\r\nexcuse afforded. (For that matter, even a man of good standing and of\r\nrespectable exterior--a man with a star on his breast--may unexpectedly\r\npress your hand one day, and begin talking to you on subjects of a\r\nnature to give food for serious thought. Yet just as unexpectedly may\r\nthat man start abusing you to your face--and do so in a manner worthy\r\nof a collegiate registrar rather than of a man who wears a star on his\r\nbreast and aspires to converse on subjects which merit reflection. All\r\nthat one can do in such a case is to stand shrugging one\'s shoulders in\r\namazement.) Well, Nozdrev had just such a weakness. The more he became\r\nfriendly with a man, the sooner would he insult him, and be ready\r\nto spread calumnies as to his reputation. Yet all the while he would\r\nconsider himself the insulted one\'s friend, and, should he meet him\r\nagain, would greet him in the most amicable style possible, and say,\r\n"You rascal, why have you given up coming to see me." Thus, taken all\r\nround, Nozdrev was a person of many aspects and numerous potentialities.\r\nIn one and the same breath would he propose to go with you whithersoever\r\nyou might choose (even to the very ends of the world should you so\r\nrequire) or to enter upon any sort of an enterprise with you, or to\r\nexchange any commodity for any other commodity which you might care to\r\nname. Guns, horses, dogs, all were subjects for barter--though not for\r\nprofit so far as YOU were concerned. Such traits are mostly the outcome\r\nof a boisterous temperament, as is additionally exemplified by the fact\r\nthat if at a fair he chanced to fall in with a simpleton and to fleece\r\nhim, he would then proceed to buy a quantity of the very first articles\r\nwhich came to hand--horse-collars, cigar-lighters, dresses for his\r\nnursemaid, foals, raisins, silver ewers, lengths of holland, wheatmeal,\r\ntobacco, revolvers, dried herrings, pictures, whetstones, crockery,\r\nboots, and so forth, until every atom of his money was exhausted. Yet\r\nseldom were these articles conveyed home, since, as a rule, the same day\r\nsaw them lost to some more skilful gambler, in addition to his pipe,\r\nhis tobacco-pouch, his mouthpiece, his four-horsed turn-out, and his\r\ncoachman: with the result that, stripped to his very shirt, he would be\r\nforced to beg the loan of a vehicle from a friend.\r\n\r\nSuch was Nozdrev. Some may say that characters of his type have become\r\nextinct, that Nozdrevs no longer exist. Alas! such as say this will\r\nbe wrong; for many a day must pass before the Nozdrevs will have\r\ndisappeared from our ken. Everywhere they are to be seen in our\r\nmidst--the only difference between the new and the old being a\r\ndifference of garments. Persons of superficial observation are apt to\r\nconsider that a man clad in a different coat is quite a different person\r\nfrom what he used to be.\r\n\r\nTo continue. The three vehicles bowled up to the steps of Nozdrev\'s\r\nhouse, and their occupants alighted. But no preparations whatsoever had\r\nbeen made for the guest\'s reception, for on some wooden trestles in\r\nthe centre of the dining-room a couple of peasants were engaged in\r\nwhitewashing the ceiling and drawling out an endless song as they\r\nsplashed their stuff about the floor. Hastily bidding peasants and\r\ntrestles to be gone, Nozdrev departed to another room with further\r\ninstructions. Indeed, so audible was the sound of his voice as he\r\nordered dinner that Chichikov--who was beginning to feel hungry once\r\nmore--was enabled to gather that it would be at least five o\'clock\r\nbefore a meal of any kind would be available. On his return, Nozdrev\r\ninvited his companions to inspect his establishment--even though as\r\nearly as two o\'clock he had to announce that nothing more was to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThe tour began with a view of the stables, where the party saw two mares\r\n(the one a grey, and the other a roan) and a colt; which latter animal,\r\nthough far from showy, Nozdrev declared to have cost him ten thousand\r\nroubles.\r\n\r\n"You NEVER paid ten thousand roubles for the brute!" exclaimed the\r\nbrother-in-law. "He isn\'t worth even a thousand."\r\n\r\n"By God, I DID pay ten thousand!" asserted Nozdrev.\r\n\r\n"You can swear that as much as you like," retorted the other.\r\n\r\n"Will you bet that I did not?" asked Nozdrev, but the brother-in-law\r\ndeclined the offer.\r\n\r\nNext, Nozdrev showed his guests some empty stalls where a number of\r\nequally fine animals (so he alleged) had lately stood. Also there was on\r\nview the goat which an old belief still considers to be an indispensable\r\nadjunct to such places, even though its apparent use is to pace up and\r\ndown beneath the noses of the horses as though the place belonged to it.\r\nThereafter the host took his guests to look at a young wolf which he had\r\ngot tied to a chain. "He is fed on nothing but raw meat," he explained,\r\n"for I want him to grow up as fierce as possible." Then the party\r\ninspected a pond in which there were "fish of such a size that it would\r\ntake two men all their time to lift one of them out."\r\n\r\nThis piece of information was received with renewed incredulity on the\r\npart of the brother-in-law.\r\n\r\n"Now, Chichikov," went on Nozdrev, "let me show you a truly magnificent\r\nbrace of dogs. The hardness of their muscles will surprise you, and they\r\nhave jowls as sharp as needles."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he led the way to a small, but neatly-built, shed surrounded\r\non every side with a fenced-in run. Entering this run, the visitors\r\nbeheld a number of dogs of all sorts and sizes and colours. In their\r\nmidst Nozdrev looked like a father lording it over his family circle.\r\nErecting their tails--their "stems," as dog fanciers call those\r\nmembers--the animals came bounding to greet the party, and fully a score\r\nof them laid their paws upon Chichikov\'s shoulders. Indeed, one dog was\r\nmoved with such friendliness that, standing on its hind legs, it licked\r\nhim on the lips, and so forced him to spit. That done, the visitors duly\r\ninspected the couple already mentioned, and expressed astonishment at\r\ntheir muscles. True enough, they were fine animals. Next, the party\r\nlooked at a Crimean bitch which, though blind and fast nearing her end,\r\nhad, two years ago, been a truly magnificent dog. At all events, so said\r\nNozdrev. Next came another bitch--also blind; then an inspection of\r\nthe water-mill, which lacked the spindle-socket wherein the upper stone\r\nought to have been revolving--"fluttering," to use the Russian peasant\'s\r\nquaint expression. "But never mind," said Nozdrev. "Let us proceed to\r\nthe blacksmith\'s shop." So to the blacksmith\'s shop the party proceeded,\r\nand when the said shop had been viewed, Nozdrev said as he pointed to a\r\nfield:\r\n\r\n"In this field I have seen such numbers of hares as to render the ground\r\nquite invisible. Indeed, on one occasion I, with my own hands, caught a\r\nhare by the hind legs."\r\n\r\n"You never caught a hare by the hind legs with your hands!" remarked the\r\nbrother-in-law.\r\n\r\n"But I DID" reiterated Nozdrev. "However, let me show you the boundary\r\nwhere my lands come to an end."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he started to conduct his guests across a field which\r\nconsisted mostly of moleheaps, and in which the party had to pick their\r\nway between strips of ploughed land and of harrowed. Soon Chichikov\r\nbegan to feel weary, for the terrain was so low-lying that in many spots\r\nwater could be heard squelching underfoot, and though for a while the\r\nvisitors watched their feet, and stepped carefully, they soon perceived\r\nthat such a course availed them nothing, and took to following their\r\nnoses, without either selecting or avoiding the spots where the mire\r\nhappened to be deeper or the reverse. At length, when a considerable\r\ndistance had been covered, they caught sight of a boundary-post and a\r\nnarrow ditch.\r\n\r\n"That is the boundary," said Nozdrev. "Everything that you see on this\r\nside of the post is mine, as well as the forest on the other side of it,\r\nand what lies beyond the forest."\r\n\r\n"WHEN did that forest become yours?" asked the brother-in-law. "It\r\ncannot be long since you purchased it, for it never USED to be yours."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it isn\'t long since I purchased it," said Nozdrev.\r\n\r\n"How long?"\r\n\r\n"How long? Why, I purchased it three days ago, and gave a pretty sum for\r\nit, as the devil knows!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed! Why, three days ago you were at the fair?"\r\n\r\n"Wiseacre! Cannot one be at a fair and buy land at the same time? Yes, I\r\nWAS at the fair, and my steward bought the land in my absence."\r\n\r\n"Oh, your STEWARD bought it." The brother-in-law seemed doubtful, and\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\nThe guests returned by the same route as that by which they had come;\r\nwhereafter, on reaching the house, Nozdrev conducted them to his study,\r\nwhich contained not a trace of the things usually to be found in such\r\napartments--such things as books and papers. On the contrary, the only\r\narticles to be seen were a sword and a brace of guns--the one "of them\r\nworth three hundred roubles," and the other "about eight hundred." The\r\nbrother-in-law inspected the articles in question, and then shook\r\nhis head as before. Next, the visitors were shown some "real Turkish"\r\ndaggers, of which one bore the inadvertent inscription, "Saveli\r\nSibiriakov [19], Master Cutler." Then came a barrel-organ, on which\r\nNozdrev started to play some tune or another. For a while the sounds\r\nwere not wholly unpleasing, but suddenly something seemed to go wrong,\r\nfor a mazurka started, to be followed by "Marlborough has gone to the\r\nwar," and to this, again, there succeeded an antiquated waltz. Also,\r\nlong after Nozdrev had ceased to turn the handle, one particularly\r\nshrill-pitched pipe which had, throughout, refused to harmonise with the\r\nrest kept up a protracted whistling on its own account. Then followed\r\nan exhibition of tobacco pipes--pipes of clay, of wood, of meerschaum,\r\npipes smoked and non-smoked; pipes wrapped in chamois leather and not\r\nso wrapped; an amber-mounted hookah (a stake won at cards) and a tobacco\r\npouch (worked, it was alleged, by some countess who had fallen in love\r\nwith Nozdrev at a posthouse, and whose handiwork Nozdrev averred\r\nto constitute the "sublimity of superfluity"--a term which, in the\r\nNozdrevian vocabulary, purported to signify the acme of perfection).\r\n\r\nFinally, after some hors-d\'oeuvres of sturgeon\'s back, they sat down\r\nto table--the time being then nearly five o\'clock. But the meal did not\r\nconstitute by any means the best of which Chichikov had ever partaken,\r\nseeing that some of the dishes were overcooked, and others were scarcely\r\ncooked at all. Evidently their compounder had trusted chiefly to\r\ninspiration--she had laid hold of the first thing which had happened to\r\ncome to hand. For instance, had pepper represented the nearest article\r\nwithin reach, she had added pepper wholesale. Had a cabbage chanced to\r\nbe so encountered, she had pressed it also into the service. And the\r\nsame with milk, bacon, and peas. In short, her rule seemed to have been\r\n"Make a hot dish of some sort, and some sort of taste will result." For\r\nthe rest, Nozdrev drew heavily upon the wine. Even before the soup\r\nhad been served, he had poured out for each guest a bumper of port and\r\nanother of "haut" sauterne. (Never in provincial towns is ordinary,\r\nvulgar sauterne even procurable.) Next, he called for a bottle of\r\nmadeira--"as fine a tipple as ever a field-marshall drank"; but the\r\nmadeira only burnt the mouth, since the dealers, familiar with the taste\r\nof our landed gentry (who love "good" madeira) invariably doctor the\r\nstuff with copious dashes of rum and Imperial vodka, in the hope that\r\nRussian stomachs will thus be enabled to carry off the lot. After this\r\nbottle Nozdrev called for another and "a very special" brand--a brand\r\nwhich he declared to consist of a blend of burgundy and champagne, and\r\nof which he poured generous measures into the glasses of Chichikov\r\nand the brother-in-law as they sat to right and left of him. But since\r\nChichikov noticed that, after doing so, he added only a scanty modicum\r\nof the mixture to his own tumbler, our hero determined to be cautious,\r\nand therefore took advantage of a moment when Nozdrev had again plunged\r\ninto conversation and was yet a third time engaged in refilling his\r\nbrother-in-law\'s glass, to contrive to upset his (Chichikov\'s)\r\nglass over his plate. In time there came also to table a tart of\r\nmountain-ashberries--berries which the host declared to equal, in taste,\r\nripe plums, but which, curiously enough, smacked more of corn brandy.\r\nNext, the company consumed a sort of pasty of which the precise name has\r\nescaped me, but which the host rendered differently even on the second\r\noccasion of its being mentioned. The meal over, and the whole tale of\r\nwines tried, the guests still retained their seats--a circumstance which\r\nembarrassed Chichikov, seeing that he had no mind to propound his pet\r\nscheme in the presence of Nozdrev\'s brother-in-law, who was a complete\r\nstranger to him. No, that subject called for amicable and PRIVATE\r\nconversation. Nevertheless, the brother-in-law appeared to bode little\r\ndanger, seeing that he had taken on board a full cargo, and was now\r\nengaged in doing nothing of a more menacing nature than picking his\r\nnose. At length he himself noticed that he was not altogether in a\r\nresponsible condition; wherefore he rose and began to make excuses for\r\ndeparting homewards, though in a tone so drowsy and lethargic that, to\r\nquote the Russian proverb, he might almost have been "pulling a collar\r\non to a horse by the clasps."\r\n\r\n"No, no!" cried Nozdrev. "I am NOT going to let you go."\r\n\r\n"But I MUST go," replied the brother-in-law. "Don\'t try to hinder me.\r\nYou are annoying me greatly."\r\n\r\n"Rubbish! We are going to play a game of banker."\r\n\r\n"No, no. You must play it without me, my friend. My wife is expecting me\r\nat home, and I must go and tell her all about the fair. Yes, I MUST go\r\nif I am to please her. Do not try to detain me."\r\n\r\n"Your wife be--! But have you REALLY an important piece of business with\r\nher?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, my friend. The real reason is that she is a good and trustful\r\nwoman, and that she does a great deal for me. The tears spring to my\r\neyes as I think of it. Do not detain me. As an honourable man I say that\r\nI must go. Of that I do assure you in all sincerity."\r\n\r\n"Oh, let him go," put in Chichikov under his breath. "What use will he\r\nbe here?"\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Nozdrev, "though, damn it, I do not like fellows who\r\nlose their heads." Then he added to his brother-in-law: "All right,\r\nThetuk [20]. Off you go to your wife and your woman\'s talk and may the\r\ndevil go with you!"\r\n\r\n"Do not insult me with the term Thetuk," retorted the brother-in-law.\r\n"To her I owe my life, and she is a dear, good woman, and has shown me\r\nmuch affection. At the very thought of it I could weep. You see, she\r\nwill be asking me what I have seen at the fair, and tell her about it I\r\nmust, for she is such a dear, good woman."\r\n\r\n"Then off you go to her with your pack of lies. Here is your cap."\r\n\r\n"No, good friend, you are not to speak of her like that. By so doing you\r\noffend me greatly--I say that she is a dear, good woman."\r\n\r\n"Then run along home to her."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am just going. Excuse me for having been unable to stay. Gladly\r\nwould I have stayed, but really I cannot."\r\n\r\nThe brother-in-law repeated his excuses again and again without noticing\r\nthat he had entered the britchka, that it had passed through the gates,\r\nand that he was now in the open country. Permissibly we may suppose that\r\nhis wife succeeded in gleaning from him few details of the fair.\r\n\r\n"What a fool!" said Nozdrev as, standing by the window, he watched the\r\ndeparting vehicle. "Yet his off-horse is not such a bad one. For a long\r\ntime past I have been wanting to get hold of it. A man like that is\r\nsimply impossible. Yes, he is a Thetuk, a regular Thetuk."\r\n\r\nWith that they repaired to the parlour, where, on Porphyri bringing\r\ncandles, Chichikov perceived that his host had produced a pack of cards.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what," said Nozdrev, pressing the sides of the pack\r\ntogether, and then slightly bending them, so that the pack cracked and\r\na card flew out. "How would it be if, to pass the time, I were to make a\r\nbank of three hundred?"\r\n\r\nChichikov pretended not to have heard him, but remarked with an air of\r\nhaving just recollected a forgotten point:\r\n\r\n"By the way, I had omitted to say that I have a request to make of you."\r\n\r\n"What request?"\r\n\r\n"First give me your word that you will grant it."\r\n\r\n"What is the request, I say?"\r\n\r\n"Then you give me your word, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"Your word of honour?"\r\n\r\n"My word of honour."\r\n\r\n"This, then, is my request. I presume that you have a large number\r\nof dead serfs whose names have not yet been removed from the revision\r\nlist?"\r\n\r\n"I have. But why do you ask?"\r\n\r\n"Because I want you to make them over to me."\r\n\r\n"Of what use would they be to you?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind. I have a purpose in wanting them."\r\n\r\n"What purpose?"\r\n\r\n"A purpose which is strictly my own affair. In short, I need them."\r\n\r\n"You seem to have hatched a very fine scheme. Out with it, now! What is\r\nin the wind?"\r\n\r\n"How could I have hatched such a scheme as you say? One could not very\r\nwell hatch a scheme out of such a trifle as this."\r\n\r\n"Then for what purpose do you want the serfs?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, the curiosity of the man! He wants to poke his fingers into and\r\nsmell over every detail!"\r\n\r\n"Why do you decline to say what is in your mind? At all events, until\r\nyou DO say I shall not move in the matter."\r\n\r\n"But how would it benefit you to know what my plans are? A whim has\r\nseized me. That is all. Nor are you playing fair. You have given me your\r\nword of honour, yet now you are trying to back out of it."\r\n\r\n"No matter what you desire me to do, I decline to do it until you have\r\ntold me your purpose."\r\n\r\n"What am I to say to the fellow?" thought Chichikov. He reflected for\r\na moment, and then explained that he wanted the dead souls in order\r\nto acquire a better standing in society, since at present he possessed\r\nlittle landed property, and only a handful of serfs.\r\n\r\n"You are lying," said Nozdrev without even letting him finish. "Yes, you\r\nare lying my good friend."\r\n\r\nChichikov himself perceived that his device had been a clumsy one, and\r\nhis pretext weak. "I must tell him straight out," he said to himself as\r\nhe pulled his wits together.\r\n\r\n"Should I tell you the truth," he added aloud, "I must beg of you not\r\nto repeat it. The truth is that I am thinking of getting married. But,\r\nunfortunately, my betrothed\'s father and mother are very ambitious\r\npeople, and do not want me to marry her, since they desire the\r\nbridegroom to own not less than three hundred souls, whereas I own but a\r\nhundred and fifty, and that number is not sufficient."\r\n\r\n"Again you are lying," said Nozdrev.\r\n\r\n"Then look here; I have been lying only to this extent." And Chichikov\r\nmarked off upon his little finger a minute portion.\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless I will bet my head that you have been lying throughout."\r\n\r\n"Come, come! That is not very civil of you. Why should I have been\r\nlying?"\r\n\r\n"Because I know you, and know that you are a regular skinflint. I say\r\nthat in all friendship. If I possessed any power over you I should hang\r\nyou to the nearest tree."\r\n\r\nThis remark hurt Chichikov, for at any time he disliked expressions\r\ngross or offensive to decency, and never allowed any one--no, not even\r\npersons of the highest rank--to behave towards him with an undue\r\nmeasure of familiarity. Consequently his sense of umbrage on the present\r\noccasion was unbounded.\r\n\r\n"By God, I WOULD hang you!" repeated Nozdrev. "I say this frankly, and\r\nnot for the purpose of offending you, but simply to communicate to you\r\nmy friendly opinion."\r\n\r\n"To everything there are limits," retorted Chichikov stiffly. "If you\r\nwant to indulge in speeches of that sort you had better return to the\r\nbarracks."\r\n\r\nHowever, after a pause he added:\r\n\r\n"If you do not care to give me the serfs, why not SELL them?"\r\n\r\n"SELL them? _I_ know you, you rascal! You wouldn\'t give me very much for\r\nthem, WOULD you?"\r\n\r\n"A nice fellow! Look here. What are they to you? So many diamonds, eh?"\r\n\r\n"I thought so! _I_ know you!"\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, but I could wish that you were a member of the Jewish\r\npersuasion. You would give them to me fast enough then."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, to show you that I am not a usurer, I will decline to\r\nask of you a single kopeck for the serfs. All that you need do is to buy\r\nthat colt of mine, and then I will throw in the serfs in addition."\r\n\r\n"But what should _I_ want with your colt?" said Chichikov, genuinely\r\nastonished at the proposal.\r\n\r\n"What should YOU want with him? Why, I have bought him for ten thousand\r\nroubles, and am ready to let you have him for four."\r\n\r\n"I ask you again: of what use could the colt possibly be to me? I am not\r\nthe keeper of a breeding establishment."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I see that you fail to understand me. Let me suggest that you pay\r\ndown at once three thousand roubles of the purchase money, and leave the\r\nother thousand until later."\r\n\r\n"But I do not mean to buy the colt, damn him!"\r\n\r\n"Then buy the roan mare."\r\n\r\n"No, nor the roan mare."\r\n\r\n"Then you shall have both the mare and the grey horse which you have\r\nseen in my stables for two thousand roubles."\r\n\r\n"I require no horses at all."\r\n\r\n"But you would be able to sell them again. You would be able to get\r\nthrice their purchase price at the very first fair that was held."\r\n\r\n"Then sell them at that fair yourself, seeing that you are so certain of\r\nmaking a triple profit."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I should make it fast enough, only I want YOU to benefit by the\r\ntransaction."\r\n\r\nChichikov duly thanked his interlocutor, but continued to decline either\r\nthe grey horse or the roan mare.\r\n\r\n"Then buy a few dogs," said Nozdrev. "I can sell you a couple of hides\r\na-quiver, ears well pricked, coats like quills, ribs barrel-shaped, and\r\npaws so tucked up as scarcely to graze the ground when they run."\r\n\r\n"Of what use would those dogs be to me? I am not a sportsman."\r\n\r\n"But I WANT you to have the dogs. Listen. If you won\'t have the dogs,\r\nthen buy my barrel-organ. \'Tis a splendid instrument. As a man of honour\r\nI can tell you that, when new, it cost me fifteen hundred roubles. Well,\r\nyou shall have it for nine hundred."\r\n\r\n"Come, come! What should I want with a barrel-organ? I am not a German,\r\nto go hauling it about the roads and begging for coppers."\r\n\r\n"But this is quite a different kind of organ from the one which Germans\r\ntake about with them. You see, it is a REAL organ. Look at it for\r\nyourself. It is made of the best wood. I will take you to have another\r\nview of it."\r\n\r\nAnd seizing Chichikov by the hand, Nozdrev drew him towards the other\r\nroom, where, in spite of the fact that Chichikov, with his feet planted\r\nfirmly on the floor, assured his host, again and again, that he knew\r\nexactly what the organ was like, he was forced once more to hear how\r\nMarlborough went to the war.\r\n\r\n"Then, since you don\'t care to give me any money for it," persisted\r\nNozdrev, "listen to the following proposal. I will give you the\r\nbarrel-organ and all the dead souls which I possess, and in return you\r\nshall give me your britchka, and another three hundred roubles into the\r\nbargain."\r\n\r\n"Listen to the man! In that case, what should I have left to drive in?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I would stand you another britchka. Come to the coach-house, and\r\nI will show you the one I mean. It only needs repainting to look a\r\nperfectly splendid britchka."\r\n\r\n"The ramping, incorrigible devil!" thought Chichikov to himself as at\r\nall hazards he resolved to escape from britchkas, organs, and every\r\nspecies of dog, however marvellously barrel-ribbed and tucked up of paw.\r\n\r\n"And in exchange, you shall have the britchka, the barrel-organ, and the\r\ndead souls," repeated Nozdrev.\r\n\r\n"I must decline the offer," said Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"And why?"\r\n\r\n"Because I don\'t WANT the things--I am full up already."\r\n\r\n"I can see that you don\'t know how things should be done between good\r\nfriends and comrades. Plainly you are a man of two faces."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, you fool? Think for yourself. Why should I acquire\r\narticles which I don\'t want?"\r\n\r\n"Say no more about it, if you please. I have quite taken your measure.\r\nBut see here. Should you care to play a game of banker? I am ready to\r\nstake both the dead souls and the barrel-organ at cards."\r\n\r\n"No; to leave an issue to cards means to submit oneself to the unknown,"\r\nsaid Chichikov, covertly glancing at the pack which Nozdrev had got\r\nin his hands. Somehow the way in which his companion had cut that pack\r\nseemed to him suspicious.\r\n\r\n"Why \'to the unknown\'?" asked Nozdrev. "There is no such thing as \'the\r\nunknown.\' Should luck be on your side, you may win the devil knows what\r\na haul. Oh, luck, luck!" he went on, beginning to deal, in the hope of\r\nraising a quarrel. "Here is the cursed nine upon which, the other night,\r\nI lost everything. All along I knew that I should lose my money. Said I\r\nto myself: \'The devil take you, you false, accursed card!\'"\r\n\r\nJust as Nozdrev uttered the words Porphyri entered with a fresh bottle\r\nof liquor; but Chichikov declined either to play or to drink.\r\n\r\n"Why do you refuse to play?" asked Nozdrev.\r\n\r\n"Because I feel indisposed to do so. Moreover, I must confess that I am\r\nno great hand at cards."\r\n\r\n"WHY are you no great hand at them?"\r\n\r\nChichikov shrugged his shoulders. "Because I am not," he replied.\r\n\r\n"You are no great hand at ANYTHING, I think."\r\n\r\n"What does that matter? God has made me so."\r\n\r\n"The truth is that you are a Thetuk, and nothing else. Once upon a\r\ntime I believed you to be a good fellow, but now I see that you\r\ndon\'t understand civility. One cannot speak to you as one would to an\r\nintimate, for there is no frankness or sincerity about you. You are a\r\nregular Sobakevitch--just such another as he."\r\n\r\n"For what reason are you abusing me? Am I in any way at fault for\r\ndeclining to play cards? Sell me those souls if you are the man to\r\nhesitate over such rubbish."\r\n\r\n"The foul fiend take you! I was about to have given them to you for\r\nnothing, but now you shan\'t have them at all--not if you offer me three\r\nkingdoms in exchange. Henceforth I will have nothing to do with you, you\r\ncobbler, you dirty blacksmith! Porphyri, go and tell the ostler to give\r\nthe gentleman\'s horses no oats, but only hay."\r\n\r\nThis development Chichikov had hardly expected.\r\n\r\n"And do you," added Nozdrev to his guest, "get out of my sight."\r\n\r\nYet in spite of this, host and guest took supper together--even though\r\non this occasion the table was adorned with no wines of fictitious\r\nnomenclature, but only with a bottle which reared its solitary head\r\nbeside a jug of what is usually known as vin ordinaire. When supper was\r\nover Nozdrev said to Chichikov as he conducted him to a side room where\r\na bed had been made up:\r\n\r\n"This is where you are to sleep. I cannot very well wish you\r\ngood-night."\r\n\r\nLeft to himself on Nozdrev\'s departure, Chichikov felt in a most\r\nunenviable frame of mind. Full of inward vexation, he blamed himself\r\nbitterly for having come to see this man and so wasted valuable\r\ntime; but even more did he blame himself for having told him of his\r\nscheme--for having acted as carelessly as a child or a madman. Of a\r\nsurety the scheme was not one which ought to have been confided to a man\r\nlike Nozdrev, for he was a worthless fellow who might lie about it, and\r\nappend additions to it, and spread such stories as would give rise\r\nto God knows what scandals. "This is indeed bad!" Chichikov said to\r\nhimself. "I have been an absolute fool." Consequently he spent an uneasy\r\nnight--this uneasiness being increased by the fact that a number of\r\nsmall, but vigorous, insects so feasted upon him that he could do\r\nnothing but scratch the spots and exclaim, "The devil take you and\r\nNozdrev alike!" Only when morning was approaching did he fall asleep. On\r\nrising, he made it his first business (after donning dressing-gown\r\nand slippers) to cross the courtyard to the stable, for the purpose of\r\nordering Selifan to harness the britchka. Just as he was returning from\r\nhis errand he encountered Nozdrev, clad in a dressing-gown, and holding\r\na pipe between his teeth.\r\n\r\nHost and guest greeted one another in friendly fashion, and Nozdrev\r\ninquired how Chichikov had slept.\r\n\r\n"Fairly well," replied Chichikov, but with a touch of dryness in his\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n"The same with myself," said Nozdrev. "The truth is that such a lot of\r\nnasty brutes kept crawling over me that even to speak of it gives me\r\nthe shudders. Likewise, as the effect of last night\'s doings, a whole\r\nsquadron of soldiers seemed to be camping on my chest, and giving me a\r\nflogging. Ugh! And whom also do you think I saw in a dream? You would\r\nnever guess. Why, it was Staff-Captain Potsieluev and Lieutenant\r\nKuvshinnikov!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," though Chichikov to himself, "and I wish that they too would give\r\nyou a public thrashing!"\r\n\r\n"I felt so ill!" went on Nozdrev. "And just after I had fallen asleep\r\nsomething DID come and sting me. Probably it was a party of hag fleas.\r\nNow, dress yourself, and I will be with you presently. First of all I\r\nmust give that scoundrel of a bailiff a wigging."\r\n\r\nChichikov departed to his own room to wash and dress; which process\r\ncompleted, he entered the dining-room to find the table laid with\r\ntea-things and a bottle of rum. Clearly no broom had yet touched the\r\nplace, for there remained traces of the previous night\'s dinner and\r\nsupper in the shape of crumbs thrown over the floor and tobacco ash on\r\nthe tablecloth. The host himself, when he entered, was still clad in a\r\ndressing-gown exposing a hairy chest; and as he sat holding his pipe in\r\nhis hand, and drinking tea from a cup, he would have made a model for\r\nthe sort of painter who prefers to portray gentlemen of the less curled\r\nand scented order.\r\n\r\n"What think you?" he asked of Chichikov after a short silence. "Are you\r\nwilling NOW to play me for those souls?"\r\n\r\n"I have told you that I never play cards. If the souls are for sale, I\r\nwill buy them."\r\n\r\n"I decline to sell them. Such would not be the course proper between\r\nfriends. But a game of banker would be quite another matter. Let us deal\r\nthe cards."\r\n\r\n"I have told you that I decline to play."\r\n\r\n"And you will not agree to an exchange?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Then look here. Suppose we play a game of chess. If you win, the souls\r\nshall be yours. There are lots which I should like to see crossed off the\r\nrevision list. Hi, Porphyri! Bring me the chessboard."\r\n\r\n"You are wasting your time. I will play neither chess nor cards."\r\n\r\n"But chess is different from playing with a bank. In chess there can be\r\nneither luck nor cheating, for everything depends upon skill. In fact, I\r\nwarn you that I cannot possibly play with you unless you allow me a move\r\nor two in advance."\r\n\r\n"The same with me," thought Chichikov. "Shall I, or shall I not, play\r\nthis fellow? I used not to be a bad chess-player, and it is a sport in\r\nwhich he would find it more difficult to be up to his tricks."\r\n\r\n"Very well," he added aloud. "I WILL play you at chess."\r\n\r\n"And stake the souls for a hundred roubles?" asked Nozdrev.\r\n\r\n"No. Why for a hundred? Would it not be sufficient to stake them for\r\nfifty?"\r\n\r\n"No. What would be the use of fifty? Nevertheless, for the hundred\r\nroubles I will throw in a moderately old puppy, or else a gold seal and\r\nwatch-chain."\r\n\r\n"Very well," assented Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Then how many moves are you going to allow me?"\r\n\r\n"Is THAT to be part of the bargain? Why, none, of course."\r\n\r\n"At least allow me two."\r\n\r\n"No, none. I myself am only a poor player."\r\n\r\n"_I_ know you and your poor play," said Nozdrev, moving a chessman.\r\n\r\n"In fact, it is a long time since last I had a chessman in my hand,"\r\nreplied Chichikov, also moving a piece.\r\n\r\n"Ah! _I_ know you and your poor play," repeated Nozdrev, moving a second\r\nchessman.\r\n\r\n"I say again that it is a long time since last I had a chessman in my\r\nhand." And Chichikov, in his turn, moved.\r\n\r\n"Ah! _I_ know you and your poor play," repeated Nozdrev, for the third\r\ntime as he made a third move. At the same moment the cuff of one of his\r\nsleeves happened to dislodge another chessman from its position.\r\n\r\n"Again, I say," said Chichikov, "that \'tis a long time since last--But\r\nhi! look here! Put that piece back in its place!"\r\n\r\n"What piece?"\r\n\r\n"This one." And almost as Chichikov spoke he saw a third chessman coming\r\ninto view between the queens. God only knows whence that chessman had\r\nmaterialised.\r\n\r\n"No, no!" shouted Chichikov as he rose from the table. "It is impossible\r\nto play with a man like you. People don\'t move three pieces at once."\r\n\r\n"How \'three pieces\'? All that I have done is to make a mistake--to move\r\none of my pieces by accident. If you like, I will forfeit it to you."\r\n\r\n"And whence has the third piece come?"\r\n\r\n"What third piece?"\r\n\r\n"The one now standing between the queens?"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis one of your own pieces. Surely you are forgetting?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, my friend. I have counted every move, and can remember each\r\none. That piece has only just become added to the board. Put it back in\r\nits place, I say."\r\n\r\n"Its place? Which IS its place?" But Nozdrev had reddened a good deal.\r\n"I perceive you to be a strategist at the game."\r\n\r\n"No, no, good friend. YOU are the strategist--though an unsuccessful\r\none, as it happens."\r\n\r\n"Then of what are you supposing me capable? Of cheating you?"\r\n\r\n"I am not supposing you capable of anything. All that I say is that I\r\nwill not play with you any more."\r\n\r\n"But you can\'t refuse to," said Nozdrev, growing heated. "You see, the\r\ngame has begun."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, I have a right not to continue it, seeing that you are\r\nnot playing as an honest man should do."\r\n\r\n"You are lying--you cannot truthfully say that."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis you who are lying."\r\n\r\n"But I have NOT cheated. Consequently you cannot refuse to play, but\r\nmust continue the game to a finish."\r\n\r\n"You cannot force me to play," retorted Chichikov coldly as, turning to\r\nthe chessboard, he swept the pieces into confusion.\r\n\r\nNozdrev approached Chichikov with a manner so threatening that the other\r\nfell back a couple of paces.\r\n\r\n"I WILL force you to play," said Nozdrev. "It is no use you making a\r\nmess of the chessboard, for I can remember every move. We will replace\r\nthe chessmen exactly as they were."\r\n\r\n"No, no, my friend. The game is over, and I play you no more."\r\n\r\n"You say that you will not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Surely you can see for yourself that such a thing is impossible?"\r\n\r\n"That cock won\'t fight. Say at once that you refuse to play with me."\r\nAnd Nozdrev approached a step nearer.\r\n\r\n"Very well; I DO say that," replied Chichikov, and at the same moment\r\nraised his hands towards his face, for the dispute was growing heated.\r\nNor was the act of caution altogether unwarranted, for Nozdrev\r\nalso raised his fist, and it may be that one of our hero\'s plump,\r\npleasant-looking cheeks would have sustained an indelible insult had\r\nnot he (Chichikov) parried the blow and, seizing Nozdrev by his whirling\r\narms, held them fast.\r\n\r\n"Porphyri! Pavlushka!" shouted Nozdrev as madly he strove to free\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nOn hearing the words, Chichikov, both because he wished to avoid\r\nrendering the servants witnesses of the unedifying scene and because he\r\nfelt that it would be of no avail to hold Nozdrev any longer, let go of\r\nthe latter\'s arms; but at the same moment Porphyri and Pavlushka entered\r\nthe room--a pair of stout rascals with whom it would be unwise to\r\nmeddle.\r\n\r\n"Do you, or do you not, intend to finish the game?" said Nozdrev. "Give\r\nme a direct answer."\r\n\r\n"No; it will not be possible to finish the game," replied Chichikov,\r\nglancing out of the window. He could see his britchka standing ready for\r\nhim, and Selifan evidently awaiting orders to draw up to the entrance\r\nsteps. But from the room there was no escape, since in the doorway was\r\nposted the couple of well-built serving-men.\r\n\r\n"Then it is as I say? You refuse to finish the game?" repeated Nozdrev,\r\nhis face as red as fire.\r\n\r\n"I would have finished it had you played like a man of honour. But, as\r\nit is, I cannot."\r\n\r\n"You cannot, eh, you villain? You find that you cannot as soon as you\r\nfind that you are not winning? Thrash him, you fellows!" And as he spoke\r\nNozdrev grasped the cherrywood shank of his pipe. Chichikov turned as\r\nwhite as a sheet. He tried to say something, but his quivering lips\r\nemitted no sound. "Thrash him!" again shouted Nozdrev as he rushed\r\nforward in a state of heat and perspiration more proper to a warrior who\r\nis attacking an impregnable fortress. "Thrash him!" again he shouted\r\nin a voice like that of some half-demented lieutenant whose desperate\r\nbravery has acquired such a reputation that orders have had to be issued\r\nthat his hands shall be held lest he attempt deeds of over-presumptuous\r\ndaring. Seized with the military spirit, however, the lieutenant\'s head\r\nbegins to whirl, and before his eye there flits the image of Suvorov\r\n[21]. He advances to the great encounter, and impulsively cries,\r\n"Forward, my sons!"--cries it without reflecting that he may be\r\nspoiling the plan of the general attack, that millions of rifles may\r\nbe protruding their muzzles through the embrasures of the impregnable,\r\ntowering walls of the fortress, that his own impotent assault may be\r\ndestined to be dissipated like dust before the wind, and that already\r\nthere may have been launched on its whistling career the bullet which is\r\nto close for ever his vociferous throat. However, if Nozdrev resembled\r\nthe headstrong, desperate lieutenant whom we have just pictured as\r\nadvancing upon a fortress, at least the fortress itself in no way\r\nresembled the impregnable stronghold which I have described. As a matter\r\nof fact, the fortress became seized with a panic which drove its spirit\r\ninto its boots. First of all, the chair with which Chichikov (the\r\nfortress in question) sought to defend himself was wrested from his\r\ngrasp by the serfs, and then--blinking and neither alive nor dead--he\r\nturned to parry the Circassian pipe-stem of his host. In fact, God\r\nonly knows what would have happened had not the fates been pleased by\r\na miracle to deliver Chichikov\'s elegant back and shoulders from the\r\nonslaught. Suddenly, and as unexpectedly as though the sound had\r\ncome from the clouds, there made itself heard the tinkling notes of\r\na collar-bell, and then the rumble of wheels approaching the entrance\r\nsteps, and, lastly, the snorting and hard breathing of a team of horses\r\nas a vehicle came to a standstill. Involuntarily all present glanced\r\nthrough the window, and saw a man clad in a semi-military greatcoat leap\r\nfrom a buggy. After making an inquiry or two in the hall, he entered the\r\ndining-room just at the juncture when Chichikov, almost swooning with\r\nterror, had found himself placed in about as awkward a situation as\r\ncould well befall a mortal man.\r\n\r\n"Kindly tell me which of you is Monsieur Nozdrev?" said the unknown with\r\na glance of perplexity both at the person named (who was still standing\r\nwith pipe-shank upraised) and at Chichikov (who was just beginning to\r\nrecover from his unpleasant predicament).\r\n\r\n"Kindly tell ME whom I have the honour of addressing?" retorted Nozdrev\r\nas he approached the official.\r\n\r\n"I am the Superintendent of Rural Police."\r\n\r\n"And what do you want?"\r\n\r\n"I have come to fulfil a commission imposed upon me. That is to say,\r\nI have come to place you under arrest until your case shall have been\r\ndecided."\r\n\r\n"Rubbish! What case, pray?"\r\n\r\n"The case in which you involved yourself when, in a drunken condition,\r\nand through the instrumentality of a walking-stick, you offered grave\r\noffence to the person of Landowner Maksimov."\r\n\r\n"You lie! To your face I tell you that never in my life have I set eyes\r\nupon Landowner Maksimov."\r\n\r\n"Good sir, allow me to represent to you that I am a Government officer.\r\nSpeeches like that you may address to your servants, but not to me."\r\n\r\nAt this point Chichikov, without waiting for Nozdrev\'s reply, seized\r\nhis cap, slipped behind the Superintendent\'s back, rushed out on to the\r\nverandah, sprang into his britchka, and ordered Selifan to drive like\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCertainly Chichikov was a thorough coward, for, although the britchka\r\npursued its headlong course until Nozdrev\'s establishment had\r\ndisappeared behind hillocks and hedgerows, our hero continued to glance\r\nnervously behind him, as though every moment expecting to see a stern\r\nchase begin. His breath came with difficulty, and when he tried his\r\nheart with his hands he could feel it fluttering like a quail caught in\r\na net.\r\n\r\n"What a sweat the fellow has thrown me into!" he thought to himself,\r\nwhile many a dire and forceful aspiration passed through his mind.\r\nIndeed, the expressions to which he gave vent were most inelegant\r\nin their nature. But what was to be done next? He was a Russian\r\nand thoroughly aroused. The affair had been no joke. "But for the\r\nSuperintendent," he reflected, "I might never again have looked upon\r\nGod\'s daylight--I might have vanished like a bubble on a pool, and left\r\nneither trace nor posterity nor property nor an honourable name for my\r\nfuture offspring to inherit!" (it seemed that our hero was particularly\r\nanxious with regard to his possible issue).\r\n\r\n"What a scurvy barin!" mused Selifan as he drove along. "Never have I\r\nseen such a barin. I should like to spit in his face. \'Tis better to\r\nallow a man nothing to eat than to refuse to feed a horse properly. A\r\nhorse needs his oats--they are his proper fare. Even if you make a man\r\nprocure a meal at his own expense, don\'t deny a horse his oats, for he\r\nought always to have them."\r\n\r\nAn equally poor opinion of Nozdrev seemed to be cherished also by\r\nthe steeds, for not only were the bay and the Assessor clearly out of\r\nspirits, but even the skewbald was wearing a dejected air. True, at home\r\nthe skewbald got none but the poorer sorts of oats to eat, and Selifan\r\nnever filled his trough without having first called him a villain; but\r\nat least they WERE oats, and not hay--they were stuff which could be\r\nchewed with a certain amount of relish. Also, there was the fact that\r\nat intervals he could intrude his long nose into his companions\' troughs\r\n(especially when Selifan happened to be absent from the stable) and\r\nascertain what THEIR provender was like. But at Nozdrev\'s there had\r\nbeen nothing but hay! That was not right. All three horses felt greatly\r\ndiscontented.\r\n\r\nBut presently the malcontents had their reflections cut short in a very\r\nrude and unexpected manner. That is to say, they were brought back\r\nto practicalities by coming into violent collision with a six-horsed\r\nvehicle, while upon their heads descended both a babel of cries from the\r\nladies inside and a storm of curses and abuse from the coachman. "Ah,\r\nyou damned fool!" he vociferated. "I shouted to you loud enough! Draw\r\nout, you old raven, and keep to the right! Are you drunk?" Selifan\r\nhimself felt conscious that he had been careless, but since a Russian\r\ndoes not care to admit a fault in the presence of strangers, he retorted\r\nwith dignity: "Why have you run into US? Did you leave your eyes behind\r\nyou at the last tavern that you stopped at?" With that he started to\r\nback the britchka, in the hope that it might get clear of the other\'s\r\nharness; but this would not do, for the pair were too hopelessly\r\nintertwined. Meanwhile the skewbald snuffed curiously at his new\r\nacquaintances as they stood planted on either side of him; while the\r\nladies in the vehicle regarded the scene with an expression of terror.\r\nOne of them was an old woman, and the other a damsel of about sixteen. A\r\nmass of golden hair fell daintily from a small head, and the oval of\r\nher comely face was as shapely as an egg, and white with the transparent\r\nwhiteness seen when the hands of a housewife hold a new-laid egg to\r\nthe light to let the sun\'s rays filter through its shell. The same tint\r\nmarked the maiden\'s ears where they glowed in the sunshine, and,\r\nin short, what with the tears in her wide-open, arresting eyes, she\r\npresented so attractive a picture that our hero bestowed upon it more\r\nthan a passing glance before he turned his attention to the hubbub which\r\nwas being raised among the horses and the coachmen.\r\n\r\n"Back out, you rook of Nizhni Novgorod!" the strangers\' coachman\r\nshouted. Selifan tightened his reins, and the other driver did the same.\r\nThe horses stepped back a little, and then came together again--this\r\ntime getting a leg or two over the traces. In fact, so pleased did the\r\nskewbald seem with his new friends that he refused to stir from the\r\nmelee into which an unforeseen chance had plunged him. Laying his muzzle\r\nlovingly upon the neck of one of his recently-acquired acquaintances,\r\nhe seemed to be whispering something in that acquaintance\'s ear--and\r\nwhispering pretty nonsense, too, to judge from the way in which that\r\nconfidant kept shaking his ears.\r\n\r\nAt length peasants from a village which happened to be near the scene of\r\nthe accident tackled the mess; and since a spectacle of that kind is to\r\nthe Russian muzhik what a newspaper or a club-meeting is to the German,\r\nthe vehicles soon became the centre of a crowd, and the village denuded\r\neven of its old women and children. The traces were disentangled, and a\r\nfew slaps on the nose forced the skewbald to draw back a little; after\r\nwhich the teams were straightened out and separated. Nevertheless,\r\neither sheer obstinacy or vexation at being parted from their new\r\nfriends caused the strange team absolutely to refuse to move a leg.\r\nTheir driver laid the whip about them, but still they stood as though\r\nrooted to the spot. At length the participatory efforts of the peasants\r\nrose to an unprecedented degree of enthusiasm, and they shouted in an\r\nintermittent chorus the advice, "Do you, Andrusha, take the head of the\r\ntrace horse on the right, while Uncle Mitai mounts the shaft horse. Get\r\nup, Uncle Mitai." Upon that the lean, long, and red-bearded Uncle Mitai\r\nmounted the shaft horse; in which position he looked like a village\r\nsteeple or the winder which is used to raise water from wells. The\r\ncoachman whipped up his steeds afresh, but nothing came of it, and\r\nUncle Mitai had proved useless. "Hold on, hold on!" shouted the peasants\r\nagain. "Do you, Uncle Mitai, mount the trace horse, while Uncle Minai\r\nmounts the shaft horse." Whereupon Uncle Minai--a peasant with a pair of\r\nbroad shoulders, a beard as black as charcoal, and a belly like the\r\nhuge samovar in which sbiten is brewed for all attending a local\r\nmarket--hastened to seat himself upon the shaft horse, which almost\r\nsank to the ground beneath his weight. "NOW they will go all right!" the\r\nmuzhiks exclaimed. "Lay it on hot, lay it on hot! Give that sorrel horse\r\nthe whip, and make him squirm like a koramora [22]." Nevertheless, the\r\naffair in no way progressed; wherefore, seeing that flogging was of\r\nno use, Uncles Mitai and Minai BOTH mounted the sorrel, while Andrusha\r\nseated himself upon the trace horse. Then the coachman himself lost\r\npatience, and sent the two Uncles about their business--and not before\r\nit was time, seeing that the horses were steaming in a way that made it\r\nclear that, unless they were first winded, they would never reach the\r\nnext posthouse. So they were given a moment\'s rest. That done, they\r\nmoved off of their own accord!\r\n\r\nThroughout, Chichikov had been gazing at the young unknown with\r\ngreat attention, and had even made one or two attempts to enter into\r\nconversation with her: but without success. Indeed, when the ladies\r\ndeparted, it was as in a dream that he saw the girl\'s comely presence,\r\nthe delicate features of her face, and the slender outline of her form\r\nvanish from his sight; it was as in a dream that once more he saw only\r\nthe road, the britchka, the three horses, Selifan, and the bare, empty\r\nfields. Everywhere in life--yes, even in the plainest, the dingiest\r\nranks of society, as much as in those which are uniformly bright and\r\npresentable--a man may happen upon some phenomenon which is so entirely\r\ndifferent from those which have hitherto fallen to his lot. Everywhere\r\nthrough the web of sorrow of which our lives are woven there may\r\nsuddenly break a clear, radiant thread of joy; even as suddenly along\r\nthe street of some poor, poverty-stricken village which, ordinarily,\r\nsees nought but a farm waggon there may came bowling a gorgeous coach\r\nwith plated harness, picturesque horses, and a glitter of glass, so that\r\nthe peasants stand gaping, and do not resume their caps until long after\r\nthe strange equipage has become lost to sight. Thus the golden-haired\r\nmaiden makes a sudden, unexpected appearance in our story, and as\r\nsuddenly, as unexpectedly, disappears. Indeed, had it not been that the\r\nperson concerned was Chichikov, and not some youth of twenty summers--a\r\nhussar or a student or, in general, a man standing on the threshold\r\nof life--what thoughts would not have sprung to birth, and stirred and\r\nspoken, within him; for what a length of time would he not have stood\r\nentranced as he stared into the distance and forgot alike his journey,\r\nthe business still to be done, the possibility of incurring loss through\r\nlingering--himself, his vocation, the world, and everything else that\r\nthe world contains!\r\n\r\nBut in the present case the hero was a man of middle-age, and of\r\ncautious and frigid temperament. True, he pondered over the incident,\r\nbut in more deliberate fashion than a younger man would have done. That\r\nis to say, his reflections were not so irresponsible and unsteady. "She\r\nwas a comely damsel," he said to himself as he opened his snuff-box and\r\ntook a pinch. "But the important point is: Is she also a NICE DAMSEL?\r\nOne thing she has in her favour--and that is that she appears only just\r\nto have left school, and not to have had time to become womanly in the\r\nworser sense. At present, therefore, she is like a child. Everything in\r\nher is simple, and she says just what she thinks, and laughs merely when\r\nshe feels inclined. Such a damsel might be made into anything--or she\r\nmight be turned into worthless rubbish. The latter, I surmise, for\r\ntrudging after her she will have a fond mother and a bevy of aunts,\r\nand so forth--persons who, within a year, will have filled her with\r\nwomanishness to the point where her own father wouldn\'t know her. And\r\nto that there will be added pride and affectation, and she will begin\r\nto observe established rules, and to rack her brains as to how, and how\r\nmuch, she ought to talk, and to whom, and where, and so forth. Every\r\nmoment will see her growing timorous and confused lest she be saying too\r\nmuch. Finally, she will develop into a confirmed prevaricator, and end\r\nby marrying the devil knows whom!" Chichikov paused awhile. Then he went\r\non: "Yet I should like to know who she is, and who her father is, and\r\nwhether he is a rich landowner of good standing, or merely a respectable\r\nman who has acquired a fortune in the service of the Government.\r\nShould he allow her, on marriage, a dowry of, say, two hundred thousand\r\nroubles, she will be a very nice catch indeed. She might even, so to\r\nspeak, make a man of good breeding happy."\r\n\r\nIndeed, so attractively did the idea of the two hundred thousand\r\nroubles begin to dance before his imagination that he felt a twinge of\r\nself-reproach because, during the hubbub, he had not inquired of the\r\npostillion or the coachman who the travellers might be. But soon the\r\nsight of Sobakevitch\'s country house dissipated his thoughts, and forced\r\nhim to return to his stock subject of reflection.\r\n\r\nSobakevitch\'s country house and estate were of very fair size, and on\r\neach side of the mansion were expanses of birch and pine forest in two\r\nshades of green. The wooden edifice itself had dark-grey walls and a\r\nred-gabled roof, for it was a mansion of the kind which Russia builds\r\nfor her military settlers and for German colonists. A noticeable\r\ncircumstance was the fact that the taste of the architect had differed\r\nfrom that of the proprietor--the former having manifestly been a pedant\r\nand desirous of symmetry, and the latter having wished only for comfort.\r\nConsequently he (the proprietor) had dispensed with all windows on one\r\nside of the mansion, and had caused to be inserted, in their place, only\r\na small aperture which, doubtless, was intended to light an otherwise\r\ndark lumber-room. Likewise, the architect\'s best efforts had failed to\r\ncause the pediment to stand in the centre of the building, since the\r\nproprietor had had one of its four original columns removed. Evidently\r\ndurability had been considered throughout, for the courtyard was\r\nenclosed by a strong and very high wooden fence, and both the stables,\r\nthe coach-house, and the culinary premises were partially constructed of\r\nbeams warranted to last for centuries. Nay, even the wooden huts of the\r\npeasantry were wonderful in the solidity of their construction, and\r\nnot a clay wall or a carved pattern or other device was to be seen.\r\nEverything fitted exactly into its right place, and even the draw-well\r\nof the mansion was fashioned of the oakwood usually thought suitable\r\nonly for mills or ships. In short, wherever Chichikov\'s eye turned he\r\nsaw nothing that was not free from shoddy make and well and skilfully\r\narranged. As he approached the entrance steps he caught sight of two\r\nfaces peering from a window. One of them was that of a woman in a mobcap\r\nwith features as long and as narrow as a cucumber, and the other that\r\nof a man with features as broad and as short as the Moldavian pumpkins\r\n(known as gorlianki) whereof balallaiki--the species of light,\r\ntwo-stringed instrument which constitutes the pride and the joy of\r\nthe gay young fellow of twenty as he sits winking and smiling at the\r\nwhite-necked, white-bosomed maidens who have gathered to listen to his\r\nlow-pitched tinkling--are fashioned. This scrutiny made, both faces\r\nwithdrew, and there came out on to the entrance steps a lacquey clad\r\nin a grey jacket and a stiff blue collar. This functionary conducted\r\nChichikov into the hall, where he was met by the master of the house\r\nhimself, who requested his guest to enter, and then led him into the\r\ninner part of the mansion.\r\n\r\nA covert glance at Sobakevitch showed our hero that his host exactly\r\nresembled a moderate-sized bear. To complete the resemblance,\r\nSobakevitch\'s long frockcoat and baggy trousers were of the precise\r\ncolour of a bear\'s hide, while, when shuffling across the floor, he made\r\na criss-cross motion of the legs, and had, in addition, a constant habit\r\nof treading upon his companion\'s toes. As for his face, it was of the\r\nwarm, ardent tint of a piatok [23]. Persons of this kind--persons\r\nto whose designing nature has devoted not much thought, and in the\r\nfashioning of whose frames she has used no instruments so delicate as a\r\nfile or a gimlet and so forth--are not uncommon. Such persons she merely\r\nroughhews. One cut with a hatchet, and there results a nose; another\r\nsuch cut with a hatchet, and there materialises a pair of lips; two\r\nthrusts with a drill, and there issues a pair of eyes. Lastly, scorning\r\nto plane down the roughness, she sends out that person into the world,\r\nsaying: "There is another live creature." Sobakevitch was just such a\r\nragged, curiously put together figure--though the above model would seem\r\nto have been followed more in his upper portion than in his lower. One\r\nresult was that he seldom turned his head to look at the person with\r\nwhom he was speaking, but, rather, directed his eyes towards, say, the\r\nstove corner or the doorway. As host and guest crossed the dining-room\r\nChichikov directed a second glance at his companion. "He is a bear, and\r\nnothing but a bear," he thought to himself. And, indeed, the strange\r\ncomparison was inevitable. Incidentally, Sobakevitch\'s Christian name\r\nand patronymic were Michael Semenovitch. Of his habit of treading upon\r\nother people\'s toes Chichikov had become fully aware; wherefore he\r\nstepped cautiously, and, throughout, allowed his host to take the\r\nlead. As a matter of fact, Sobakevitch himself seemed conscious of his\r\nfailing, for at intervals he would inquire: "I hope I have not hurt\r\nyou?" and Chichikov, with a word of thanks, would reply that as yet he\r\nhad sustained no injury.\r\n\r\nAt length they reached the drawing-room, where Sobakevitch pointed to\r\nan armchair, and invited his guest to be seated. Chichikov gazed with\r\ninterest at the walls and the pictures. In every such picture there were\r\nportrayed either young men or Greek generals of the type of Movrogordato\r\n(clad in a red uniform and breaches), Kanaris, and others; and all these\r\nheroes were depicted with a solidity of thigh and a wealth of moustache\r\nwhich made the beholder simply shudder with awe. Among them there were\r\nplaced also, according to some unknown system, and for some unknown\r\nreason, firstly, Bagration [24]--tall and thin, and with a cluster of\r\nsmall flags and cannon beneath him, and the whole set in the narrowest\r\nof frames--and, secondly, the Greek heroine, Bobelina, whose legs looked\r\nlarger than do the whole bodies of the drawing-room dandies of the\r\npresent day. Apparently the master of the house was himself a man of\r\nhealth and strength, and therefore liked to have his apartments adorned\r\nwith none but folk of equal vigour and robustness. Lastly, in the\r\nwindow, and suspended cheek by jowl with Bobelina, there hung a cage\r\nwhence at intervals there peered forth a white-spotted blackbird.\r\nLike everything else in the apartment, it bore a strong resemblance to\r\nSobakevitch. When host and guest had been conversing for two minutes or\r\nso the door opened, and there entered the hostess--a tall lady in a cap\r\nadorned with ribands of domestic colouring and manufacture. She entered\r\ndeliberately, and held her head as erect as a palm.\r\n\r\n"This is my wife, Theodulia Ivanovna," said Sobakevitch.\r\n\r\nChichikov approached and took her hand. The fact that she raised it\r\nnearly to the level of his lips apprised him of the circumstance that it\r\nhad just been rinsed in cucumber oil.\r\n\r\n"My dear, allow me to introduce Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov," added\r\nSobakevitch. "He has the honour of being acquainted both with our\r\nGovernor and with our Postmaster."\r\n\r\nUpon this Theodulia Ivanovna requested her guest to be seated, and\r\naccompanied the invitation with the kind of bow usually employed only by\r\nactresses who are playing the role of queens. Next, she took a seat upon\r\nthe sofa, drew around her her merino gown, and sat thereafter without\r\nmoving an eyelid or an eyebrow. As for Chichikov, he glanced upwards,\r\nand once more caught sight of Kanaris with his fat thighs and\r\ninterminable moustache, and of Bobelina and the blackbird. For fully\r\nfive minutes all present preserved a complete silence--the only sound\r\naudible being that of the blackbird\'s beak against the wooden floor of\r\nthe cage as the creature fished for grains of corn. Meanwhile Chichikov\r\nagain surveyed the room, and saw that everything in it was massive and\r\nclumsy in the highest degree; as also that everything was curiously in\r\nkeeping with the master of the house. For example, in one corner of the\r\napartment there stood a hazelwood bureau with a bulging body on four\r\ngrotesque legs--the perfect image of a bear. Also, the tables and the\r\nchairs were of the same ponderous, unrestful order, and every single\r\narticle in the room appeared to be saying either, "I, too, am a\r\nSobakevitch," or "I am exactly like Sobakevitch."\r\n\r\n"I heard speak of you one day when I was visiting the President of the\r\nCouncil," said Chichikov, on perceiving that no one else had a mind to\r\nbegin a conversation. "That was on Thursday last. We had a very pleasant\r\nevening."\r\n\r\n"Yes, on that occasion I was not there," replied Sobakevitch.\r\n\r\n"What a nice man he is!"\r\n\r\n"Who is?" inquired Sobakevitch, gazing into the corner by the stove.\r\n\r\n"The President of the Local Council."\r\n\r\n"Did he seem so to you? True, he is a mason, but he is also the greatest\r\nfool that the world ever saw."\r\n\r\nChichikov started a little at this mordant criticism, but soon pulled\r\nhimself together again, and continued:\r\n\r\n"Of course, every man has his weakness. Yet the President seems to be an\r\nexcellent fellow."\r\n\r\n"And do you think the same of the Governor?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Because there exists no greater rogue than he."\r\n\r\n"What? The Governor a rogue?" ejaculated Chichikov, at a loss to\r\nunderstand how the official in question could come to be numbered with\r\nthieves. "Let me say that I should never have guessed it. Permit me\r\nalso to remark that his conduct would hardly seem to bear out your\r\nopinion--he seems so gentle a man." And in proof of this Chichikov\r\ncited the purses which the Governor knitted, and also expatiated on the\r\nmildness of his features.\r\n\r\n"He has the face of a robber," said Sobakevitch. "Were you to give him a\r\nknife, and to turn him loose on a turnpike, he would cut your throat for\r\ntwo kopecks. And the same with the Vice-Governor. The pair are just Gog\r\nand Magog."\r\n\r\n"Evidently he is not on good terms with them," thought Chichikov to\r\nhimself. "I had better pass to the Chief of Police, which whom he DOES\r\nseem to be friendly." Accordingly he added aloud: "For my own part, I\r\nshould give the preference to the Head of the Gendarmery. What a frank,\r\noutspoken nature he has! And what an element of simplicity does his\r\nexpression contain!"\r\n\r\n"He is mean to the core," remarked Sobakevitch coldly. "He will sell you\r\nand cheat you, and then dine at your table. Yes, I know them all, and\r\nevery one of them is a swindler, and the town a nest of rascals engaged\r\nin robbing one another. Not a man of the lot is there but would sell\r\nChrist. Yet stay: ONE decent fellow there is--the Public Prosecutor;\r\nthough even HE, if the truth be told, is little better than a pig."\r\n\r\nAfter these eulogia Chichikov saw that it would be useless to continue\r\nrunning through the list of officials--more especially since suddenly he\r\nhad remembered that Sobakevitch was not at any time given to commending\r\nhis fellow man.\r\n\r\n"Let us go to luncheon, my dear," put in Theodulia Ivanovna to her\r\nspouse.\r\n\r\n"Yes; pray come to table," said Sobakevitch to his guest; whereupon they\r\nconsumed the customary glass of vodka (accompanied by sundry snacks of\r\nsalted cucumber and other dainties) with which Russians, both in town\r\nand country, preface a meal. Then they filed into the dining-room in the\r\nwake of the hostess, who sailed on ahead like a goose swimming across a\r\npond. The small dining-table was found to be laid for four persons--the\r\nfourth place being occupied by a lady or a young girl (it would have\r\nbeen difficult to say which exactly) who might have been either a\r\nrelative, the housekeeper, or a casual visitor. Certain persons in the\r\nworld exist, not as personalities in themselves, but as spots or specks\r\non the personalities of others. Always they are to be seen sitting in\r\nthe same place, and holding their heads at exactly the same angle, so\r\nthat one comes within an ace of mistaking them for furniture, and thinks\r\nto oneself that never since the day of their birth can they have spoken\r\na single word.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Sobakevitch, "the cabbage soup is excellent." With that\r\nhe finished his portion, and helped himself to a generous measure of\r\nniania [25]--the dish which follows shtchi and consists of a sheep\'s\r\nstomach stuffed with black porridge, brains, and other things. "What\r\nniania this is!" he added to Chichikov. "Never would you get such stuff\r\nin a town, where one is given the devil knows what."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless the Governor keeps a fair table," said Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but do you know what all the stuff is MADE OF?" retorted\r\nSobakevitch. "If you DID know you would never touch it."\r\n\r\n"Of course I am not in a position to say how it is prepared, but at\r\nleast the pork cutlets and the boiled fish seemed excellent."\r\n\r\n"Ah, it might have been thought so; yet I know the way in which such\r\nthings are bought in the market-place. They are bought by some rascal of\r\na cook whom a Frenchman has taught how to skin a tomcat and then serve\r\nit up as hare."\r\n\r\n"Ugh! What horrible things you say!" put in Madame.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear, that is how things are done, and it is no fault of mine\r\nthat it is so. Moreover, everything that is left over--everything that\r\nWE (pardon me for mentioning it) cast into the slop-pail--is used by\r\nsuch folk for making soup."\r\n\r\n"Always at table you begin talking like this!" objected his helpmeet.\r\n\r\n"And why not?" said Sobakevitch. "I tell you straight that I would not\r\neat such nastiness, even had I made it myself. Sugar a frog as much\r\nas you like, but never shall it pass MY lips. Nor would I swallow an\r\noyster, for I know only too well what an oyster may resemble. But\r\nhave some mutton, friend Chichikov. It is shoulder of mutton, and\r\nvery different stuff from the mutton which they cook in noble\r\nkitchens--mutton which has been kicking about the market-place four days\r\nor more. All that sort of cookery has been invented by French and German\r\ndoctors, and I should like to hang them for having done so. They go and\r\nprescribe diets and a hunger cure as though what suits their flaccid\r\nGerman systems will agree with a Russian stomach! Such devices are no\r\ngood at all." Sobakevitch shook his head wrathfully. "Fellows like\r\nthose are for ever talking of civilisation. As if THAT sort of thing was\r\ncivilisation! Phew!" (Perhaps the speaker\'s concluding exclamation would\r\nhave been even stronger had he not been seated at table.) "For myself, I\r\nwill have none of it. When I eat pork at a meal, give me the WHOLE pig;\r\nwhen mutton, the WHOLE sheep; when goose, the WHOLE of the bird. Two\r\ndishes are better than a thousand, provided that one can eat of them as\r\nmuch as one wants."\r\n\r\nAnd he proceeded to put precept into practice by taking half the\r\nshoulder of mutton on to his plate, and then devouring it down to the\r\nlast morsel of gristle and bone.\r\n\r\n"My word!" reflected Chichikov. "The fellow has a pretty good holding\r\ncapacity!"\r\n\r\n"None of it for me," repeated Sobakevitch as he wiped his hands on his\r\nnapkin. "I don\'t intend to be like a fellow named Plushkin, who owns\r\neight hundred souls, yet dines worse than does my shepherd."\r\n\r\n"Who is Plushkin?" asked Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"A miser," replied Sobakevitch. "Such a miser as never you could\r\nimagine. Even convicts in prison live better than he does. And he\r\nstarves his servants as well."\r\n\r\n"Really?" ejaculated Chichikov, greatly interested. "Should you, then,\r\nsay that he has lost many peasants by death?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. They keep dying like flies."\r\n\r\n"Then how far from here does he reside?"\r\n\r\n"About five versts."\r\n\r\n"Only five versts?" exclaimed Chichikov, feeling his heart beating\r\njoyously. "Ought one, when leaving your gates, to turn to the right or\r\nto the left?"\r\n\r\n"I should be sorry to tell you the way to the house of such a cur," said\r\nSobakevitch. "A man had far better go to hell than to Plushkin\'s."\r\n\r\n"Quite so," responded Chichikov. "My only reason for asking you is\r\nthat it interests me to become acquainted with any and every sort of\r\nlocality."\r\n\r\nTo the shoulder of mutton there succeeded, in turn, cutlets (each one\r\nlarger than a plate), a turkey of about the size of a calf, eggs, rice,\r\npastry, and every conceivable thing which could possibly be put into a\r\nstomach. There the meal ended. When he rose from table Chichikov felt as\r\nthough a pood\'s weight were inside him. In the drawing-room the company\r\nfound dessert awaiting them in the shape of pears, plums, and apples;\r\nbut since neither host nor guest could tackle these particular dainties\r\nthe hostess removed them to another room. Taking advantage of her\r\nabsence, Chichikov turned to Sobakevitch (who, prone in an armchair,\r\nseemed, after his ponderous meal, to be capable of doing little\r\nbeyond belching and grunting--each such grunt or belch necessitating a\r\nsubsequent signing of the cross over the mouth), and intimated to him\r\na desire to have a little private conversation concerning a certain\r\nmatter. At this moment the hostess returned.\r\n\r\n"Here is more dessert," she said. "Pray have a few radishes stewed in\r\nhoney."\r\n\r\n"Later, later," replied Sobakevitch. "Do you go to your room, and Paul\r\nIvanovitch and I will take off our coats and have a nap."\r\n\r\nUpon this the good lady expressed her readiness to send for feather beds\r\nand cushions, but her husband expressed a preference for slumbering in\r\nan armchair, and she therefore departed. When she had gone Sobakevitch\r\ninclined his head in an attitude of willingness to listen to Chichikov\'s\r\nbusiness. Our hero began in a sort of detached manner--touching lightly\r\nupon the subject of the Russian Empire, and expatiating upon the\r\nimmensity of the same, and saying that even the Empire of Ancient Rome\r\nhad been of considerably smaller dimensions. Meanwhile Sobakevitch sat\r\nwith his head drooping.\r\n\r\nFrom that Chichikov went on to remark that, according to the statutes of\r\nthe said Russian Empire (which yielded to none in glory--so much so that\r\nforeigners marvelled at it), peasants on the census lists who had ended\r\ntheir earthly careers were nevertheless, on the rendering of new lists,\r\nreturned equally with the living, to the end that the courts might be\r\nrelieved of a multitude of trifling, useless emendations which might\r\ncomplicate the already sufficiently complex mechanism of the State.\r\nNevertheless, said Chichikov, the general equity of this measure did\r\nnot obviate a certain amount of annoyance to landowners, since it forced\r\nthem to pay upon a non-living article the tax due upon a living. Hence\r\n(our hero concluded) he (Chichikov) was prepared, owing to the personal\r\nrespect which he felt for Sobakevitch, to relieve him, in part, of\r\nthe irksome obligation referred to (in passing, it may be said that\r\nChichikov referred to his principal point only guardedly, for he called\r\nthe souls which he was seeking not "dead," but "non-existent").\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sobakevitch listened with bent head; though something like a\r\ntrace of expression dawned in his face as he did so. Ordinarily his\r\nbody lacked a soul--or, if he did possess a soul, he seemed to keep it\r\nelsewhere than where it ought to have been; so that, buried beneath\r\nmountains (as it were) or enclosed within a massive shell, its movements\r\nproduced no sort of agitation on the surface.\r\n\r\n"Well?" said Chichikov--though not without a certain tremor of\r\ndiffidence as to the possible response.\r\n\r\n"You are after dead souls?" were Sobakevitch\'s perfectly simple words.\r\nHe spoke without the least surprise in his tone, and much as though the\r\nconversation had been turning on grain.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Chichikov, and then, as before, softened down the\r\nexpression "dead souls."\r\n\r\n"They are to be found," said Sobakevitch. "Why should they not be?"\r\n\r\n"Then of course you will be glad to get rid of any that you may chance\r\nto have?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I shall have no objection to SELLING them." At this point the\r\nspeaker raised his head a little, for it had struck him that surely the\r\nwould-be buyer must have some advantage in view.\r\n\r\n"The devil!" thought Chichikov to himself. "Here is he selling the goods\r\nbefore I have even had time to utter a word!"\r\n\r\n"And what about the price?" he added aloud. "Of course, the articles are\r\nnot of a kind very easy to appraise."\r\n\r\n"I should be sorry to ask too much," said Sobakevitch. "How would a\r\nhundred roubles per head suit you?"\r\n\r\n"What, a hundred roubles per head?" Chichikov stared open-mouthed at\r\nhis host--doubting whether he had heard aright, or whether his host\'s\r\nslow-moving tongue might not have inadvertently substituted one word for\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Is that too much for you?" said Sobakevitch. Then he added: "What\r\nis your own price?"\r\n\r\n"My own price? I think that we cannot properly have understood one\r\nanother--that you must have forgotten of what the goods consist. With\r\nmy hand on my heart do I submit that eight grivni per soul would be a\r\nhandsome, a VERY handsome, offer."\r\n\r\n"What? Eight grivni?"\r\n\r\n"In my opinion, a higher offer would be impossible."\r\n\r\n"But I am not a seller of boots."\r\n\r\n"No; yet you, for your part, will agree that these souls are not live\r\nhuman beings?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose you hope to find fools ready to sell you souls on the census\r\nlist for a couple of groats apiece?"\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, but why do you use the term \'on the census list\'? The souls\r\nthemselves have long since passed away, and have left behind them only\r\ntheir names. Not to trouble you with any further discussion of the\r\nsubject, I can offer you a rouble and a half per head, but no more."\r\n\r\n"You should be ashamed even to mention such a sum! Since you deal in\r\narticles of this kind, quote me a genuine price."\r\n\r\n"I cannot, Michael Semenovitch. Believe me, I cannot. What a man\r\ncannot do, that he cannot do." The speaker ended by advancing another\r\nhalf-rouble per head.\r\n\r\n"But why hang back with your money?" said Sobakevitch. "Of a truth I am\r\nnot asking much of you. Any other rascal than myself would have cheated\r\nyou by selling you old rubbish instead of good, genuine souls, whereas\r\nI should be ready to give you of my best, even were you buying only\r\nnut-kernels. For instance, look at wheelwright Michiev. Never was there\r\nsuch a one to build spring carts! And his handiwork was not like your\r\nMoscow handiwork--good only for an hour. No, he did it all himself, even\r\ndown to the varnishing."\r\n\r\nChichikov opened his mouth to remark that, nevertheless, the said\r\nMichiev had long since departed this world; but Sobakevitch\'s eloquence\r\nhad got too thoroughly into its stride to admit of any interruption.\r\n\r\n"And look, too, at Probka Stepan, the carpenter," his host went on. "I\r\nwill wager my head that nowhere else would you find such a workman. What\r\na strong fellow he was! He had served in the Guards, and the Lord only\r\nknows what they had given for him, seeing that he was over three arshins\r\nin height."\r\n\r\nAgain Chichikov tried to remark that Probka was dead, but Sobakevitch\'s\r\ntongue was borne on the torrent of its own verbiage, and the only thing\r\nto be done was to listen.\r\n\r\n"And Milushkin, the bricklayer! He could build a stove in any house you\r\nliked! And Maksim Teliatnikov, the bootmaker! Anything that he drove\r\nhis awl into became a pair of boots--and boots for which you would\r\nbe thankful, although he WAS a bit foul of the mouth. And Eremi\r\nSorokoplechin, too! He was the best of the lot, and used to work at\r\nhis trade in Moscow, where he paid a tax of five hundred roubles. Well,\r\nTHERE\'S an assortment of serfs for you!--a very different assortment\r\nfrom what Plushkin would sell you!"\r\n\r\n"But permit me," at length put in Chichikov, astounded at this flood of\r\neloquence to which there appeared to be no end. "Permit me, I say, to\r\ninquire why you enumerate the talents of the deceased, seeing that they\r\nare all of them dead, and that therefore there can be no sense in doing\r\nso. \'A dead body is only good to prop a fence with,\' says the proverb."\r\n\r\n"Of course they are dead," replied Sobakevitch, but rather as though the\r\nidea had only just occurred to him, and was giving him food for thought.\r\n"But tell me, now: what is the use of listing them as still alive? And\r\nwhat is the use of them themselves? They are flies, not human beings."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Chichikov, "they exist, though only in idea."\r\n\r\n"But no--NOT only in idea. I tell you that nowhere else would you\r\nfind such a fellow for working heavy tools as was Michiev. He had the\r\nstrength of a horse in his shoulders." And, with the words, Sobakevitch\r\nturned, as though for corroboration, to the portrait of Bagration, as is\r\nfrequently done by one of the parties in a dispute when he purports to\r\nappeal to an extraneous individual who is not only unknown to him, but\r\nwholly unconnected with the subject in hand; with the result that the\r\nindividual is left in doubt whether to make a reply, or whether to\r\nbetake himself elsewhere.\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, I CANNOT give you more than two roubles per head," said\r\nChichikov.\r\n\r\n"Well, as I don\'t want you to swear that I have asked too much of you\r\nand won\'t meet you halfway, suppose, for friendship\'s sake, that you pay\r\nme seventy-five roubles in assignats?"\r\n\r\n"Good heavens!" thought Chichikov to himself. "Does the man take me for\r\na fool?" Then he added aloud: "The situation seems to me a strange\r\none, for it is as though we were performing a stage comedy. No other\r\nexplanation would meet the case. Yet you appear to be a man of sense,\r\nand possessed of some education. The matter is a very simple one. The\r\nquestion is: what is a dead soul worth, and is it of any use to any\r\none?"\r\n\r\n"It is of use to YOU, or you would not be buying such articles."\r\n\r\nChichikov bit his lip, and stood at a loss for a retort. He tried\r\nto saying something about "family and domestic circumstances," but\r\nSobakevitch cut him short with:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to know your private affairs, for I never poke my nose\r\ninto such things. You need the souls, and I am ready to sell them.\r\nShould you not buy them, I think you will repent it."\r\n\r\n"Two roubles is my price," repeated Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Come, come! As you have named that sum, I can understand your not\r\nliking to go back upon it; but quote me a bona fide figure."\r\n\r\n"The devil fly away with him!" mused Chichikov. "However, I will add\r\nanother half-rouble." And he did so.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said Sobakevitch. "Well, my last word upon it is--fifty\r\nroubles in assignats. That will mean a sheer loss to me, for nowhere\r\nelse in the world could you buy better souls than mine."\r\n\r\n"The old skinflint!" muttered Chichikov. Then he added aloud, with\r\nirritation in his tone: "See here. This is a serious matter. Any one but\r\nyou would be thankful to get rid of the souls. Only a fool would stick\r\nto them, and continue to pay the tax."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but remember (and I say it wholly in a friendly way) that\r\ntransactions of this kind are not generally allowed, and that any one\r\nwould say that a man who engages in them must have some rather doubtful\r\nadvantage in view."\r\n\r\n"Have it your own away," said Chichikov, with assumed indifference. "As\r\na matter of fact, I am not purchasing for profit, as you suppose, but to\r\nhumour a certain whim of mine. Two and a half roubles is the most that I\r\ncan offer."\r\n\r\n"Bless your heart!" retorted the host. "At least give me thirty roubles\r\nin assignats, and take the lot."\r\n\r\n"No, for I see that you are unwilling to sell. I must say good-day to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Hold on, hold on!" exclaimed Sobakevitch, retaining his guest\'s hand,\r\nand at the same moment treading heavily upon his toes--so heavily,\r\nindeed, that Chichikov gasped and danced with the pain.\r\n\r\n"I BEG your pardon!" said Sobakevitch hastily. "Evidently I have hurt\r\nyou. Pray sit down again."\r\n\r\n"No," retorted Chichikov. "I am merely wasting my time, and must be\r\noff."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sit down just for a moment. I have something more agreeable to\r\nsay." And, drawing closer to his guest, Sobakevitch whispered in his\r\near, as though communicating to him a secret: "How about twenty-five\r\nroubles?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, no!" exclaimed Chichikov. "I won\'t give you even a QUARTER of\r\nthat. I won\'t advance another kopeck."\r\n\r\nFor a while Sobakevitch remained silent, and Chichikov did the same.\r\nThis lasted for a couple of minutes, and, meanwhile, the aquiline-nosed\r\nBagration gazed from the wall as though much interested in the\r\nbargaining.\r\n\r\n"What is your outside price?" at length said Sobakevitch.\r\n\r\n"Two and a half roubles."\r\n\r\n"Then you seem to rate a human soul at about the same value as a boiled\r\nturnip. At least give me THREE roubles."\r\n\r\n"No, I cannot."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, but you are an impossible man to deal with. However, even\r\nthough it will mean a dead loss to me, and you have not shown a very\r\nnice spirit about it, I cannot well refuse to please a friend. I suppose\r\na purchase deed had better be made out in order to have everything in\r\norder?"\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\n"Then for that purpose let us repair to the town."\r\n\r\nThe affair ended in their deciding to do this on the morrow, and to\r\narrange for the signing of a deed of purchase. Next, Chichikov requested\r\na list of the peasants; to which Sobakevitch readily agreed. Indeed, he\r\nwent to his writing-desk then and there, and started to indite a\r\nlist which gave not only the peasants\' names, but also their late\r\nqualifications.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Chichikov, having nothing else to do, stood looking at the\r\nspacious form of his host; and as he gazed at his back as broad as that\r\nof a cart horse, and at the legs as massive as the iron standards which\r\nadorn a street, he could not help inwardly ejaculating:\r\n\r\n"Truly God has endowed you with much! Though not adjusted with nicety,\r\nat least you are strongly built. I wonder whether you were born a\r\nbear or whether you have come to it through your rustic life, with its\r\ntilling of crops and its trading with peasants? Yet no; I believe that,\r\neven if you had received a fashionable education, and had mixed with\r\nsociety, and had lived in St. Petersburg, you would still have been just\r\nthe kulak [26] that you are. The only difference is that circumstances,\r\nas they stand, permit of your polishing off a stuffed shoulder of mutton\r\nat a meal; whereas in St. Petersburg you would have been unable to\r\ndo so. Also, as circumstances stand, you have under you a number\r\nof peasants, whom you treat well for the reason that they are your\r\nproperty; whereas, otherwise, you would have had under you tchinovniks\r\n[27]: whom you would have bullied because they were NOT your property.\r\nAlso, you would have robbed the Treasury, since a kulak always remains a\r\nmoney-grubber."\r\n\r\n"The list is ready," said Sobakevitch, turning round.\r\n\r\n"Indeed! Then please let me look at it." Chichikov ran his eye over the\r\ndocument, and could not but marvel at its neatness and accuracy. Not\r\nonly were there set forth in it the trade, the age, and the pedigree\r\nof every serf, but on the margin of the sheet were jotted remarks\r\nconcerning each serf\'s conduct and sobriety. Truly it was a pleasure to\r\nlook at it.\r\n\r\n"And do you mind handing me the earnest money?" said Sobakevitch.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do. Why need that be done? You can receive the money in a lump\r\nsum as soon as we visit the town."\r\n\r\n"But it is always the custom, you know," asserted Sobakevitch.\r\n\r\n"Then I cannot follow it, for I have no money with me. However, here are\r\nten roubles."\r\n\r\n"Ten roubles, indeed? You might as well hand me fifty while you are\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\nOnce more Chichikov started to deny that he had any money upon him, but\r\nSobakevitch insisted so strongly that this was not so that at length\r\nthe guest pulled out another fifteen roubles, and added them to the ten\r\nalready produced.\r\n\r\n"Kindly give me a receipt for the money," he added.\r\n\r\n"A receipt? Why should I give you a receipt?"\r\n\r\n"Because it is better to do so, in order to guard against mistakes."\r\n\r\n"Very well; but first hand me over the money."\r\n\r\n"The money? I have it here. Do you write out the receipt, and then the\r\nmoney shall be yours."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, but how am I to write out the receipt before I have seen the\r\ncash?"\r\n\r\nChichikov placed the notes in Sobakevitch\'s hand; whereupon the host\r\nmoved nearer to the table, and added to the list of serfs a note that\r\nhe had received for the peasants, therewith sold, the sum of twenty-five\r\nroubles, as earnest money. This done, he counted the notes once more.\r\n\r\n"This is a very OLD note," he remarked, holding one up to the light.\r\n"Also, it is a trifle torn. However, in a friendly transaction one must\r\nnot be too particular."\r\n\r\n"What a kulak!" thought Chichikov to himself. "And what a brute beast!"\r\n\r\n"Then you do not want any WOMEN souls?" queried Sobakevitch.\r\n\r\n"I thank you, no."\r\n\r\n"I could let you have some cheap--say, as between friends, at a rouble a\r\nhead?"\r\n\r\n"No, I should have no use for them."\r\n\r\n"Then, that being so, there is no more to be said. There is no\r\naccounting for tastes. \'One man loves the priest, and another the\r\npriest\'s wife,\' says the proverb."\r\n\r\nChichikov rose to take his leave. "Once more I would request of you," he\r\nsaid, "that the bargain be left as it is."\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course. What is done between friends holds good because\r\nof their mutual friendship. Good-bye, and thank you for your visit. In\r\nadvance I would beg that, whenever you should have an hour or two to\r\nspare, you will come and lunch with us again. Perhaps we might be able\r\nto do one another further service?"\r\n\r\n"Not if I know it!" reflected Chichikov as he mounted his britchka. "Not\r\nI, seeing that I have had two and a half roubles per soul squeezed out\r\nof me by a brute of a kulak!"\r\n\r\nAltogether he felt dissatisfied with Sobakevitch\'s behaviour. In spite\r\nof the man being a friend of the Governor and the Chief of Police,\r\nhe had acted like an outsider in taking money for what was worthless\r\nrubbish. As the britchka left the courtyard Chichikov glanced back\r\nand saw Sobakevitch still standing on the verandah--apparently for the\r\npurpose of watching to see which way the guest\'s carriage would turn.\r\n\r\n"The old villain, to be still standing there!" muttered Chichikov\r\nthrough his teeth; after which he ordered Selifan to proceed so that the\r\nvehicle\'s progress should be invisible from the mansion--the truth\r\nbeing that he had a mind next to visit Plushkin (whose serfs, to quote\r\nSobakevitch, had a habit of dying like flies), but not to let his late\r\nhost learn of his intention. Accordingly, on reaching the further end of\r\nthe village, he hailed the first peasant whom he saw--a man who was in\r\nthe act of hoisting a ponderous beam on to his shoulder before setting\r\noff with it, ant-like, to his hut.\r\n\r\n"Hi!" shouted Chichikov. "How can I reach landowner Plushkin\'s place\r\nwithout first going past the mansion here?"\r\n\r\nThe peasant seemed nonplussed by the question.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know?" queried Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"No, barin," replied the peasant.\r\n\r\n"What? You don\'t know skinflint Plushkin who feeds his people so badly?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do!" exclaimed the fellow, and added thereto an\r\nuncomplimentary expression of a species not ordinarily employed in\r\npolite society. We may guess that it was a pretty apt expression, since\r\nlong after the man had become lost to view Chichikov was still laughing\r\nin his britchka. And, indeed, the language of the Russian populace is\r\nalways forcible in its phraseology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nChichikov\'s amusement at the peasant\'s outburst prevented him from\r\nnoticing that he had reached the centre of a large and populous village;\r\nbut, presently, a violent jolt aroused him to the fact that he was\r\ndriving over wooden pavements of a kind compared with which the\r\ncobblestones of the town had been as nothing. Like the keys of a piano,\r\nthe planks kept rising and falling, and unguarded passage over them\r\nentailed either a bump on the back of the neck or a bruise on the\r\nforehead or a bite on the tip of one\'s tongue. At the same time\r\nChichikov noticed a look of decay about the buildings of the village.\r\nThe beams of the huts had grown dark with age, many of their roofs were\r\nriddled with holes, others had but a tile of the roof remaining, and yet\r\nothers were reduced to the rib-like framework of the same. It would\r\nseem as though the inhabitants themselves had removed the laths and\r\ntraverses, on the very natural plea that the huts were no protection\r\nagainst the rain, and therefore, since the latter entered in bucketfuls,\r\nthere was no particular object to be gained by sitting in such huts when\r\nall the time there was the tavern and the highroad and other places to\r\nresort to.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a woman appeared from an outbuilding--apparently the\r\nhousekeeper of the mansion, but so roughly and dirtily dressed as almost\r\nto seem indistinguishable from a man. Chichikov inquired for the master\r\nof the place.\r\n\r\n"He is not at home," she replied, almost before her interlocutor had had\r\ntime to finish. Then she added: "What do you want with him?"\r\n\r\n"I have some business to do," said Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Then pray walk into the house," the woman advised. Then she turned upon\r\nhim a back that was smeared with flour and had a long slit in the lower\r\nportion of its covering. Entering a large, dark hall which reeked like\r\na tomb, he passed into an equally dark parlour that was lighted only by\r\nsuch rays as contrived to filter through a crack under the door. When\r\nChichikov opened the door in question, the spectacle of the untidiness\r\nwithin struck him almost with amazement. It would seem that the floor\r\nwas never washed, and that the room was used as a receptacle for every\r\nconceivable kind of furniture. On a table stood a ragged chair, with,\r\nbeside it, a clock minus a pendulum and covered all over with cobwebs.\r\nAgainst a wall leant a cupboard, full of old silver, glassware, and\r\nchina. On a writing table, inlaid with mother-of-pearl which, in places,\r\nhad broken away and left behind it a number of yellow grooves (stuffed\r\nwith putty), lay a pile of finely written manuscript, an overturned\r\nmarble press (turning green), an ancient book in a leather cover with\r\nred edges, a lemon dried and shrunken to the dimensions of a hazelnut,\r\nthe broken arm of a chair, a tumbler containing the dregs of some liquid\r\nand three flies (the whole covered over with a sheet of notepaper), a\r\npile of rags, two ink-encrusted pens, and a yellow toothpick with which\r\nthe master of the house had picked his teeth (apparently) at least\r\nbefore the coming of the French to Moscow. As for the walls, they were\r\nhung with a medley of pictures. Among the latter was a long engraving of\r\na battle scene, wherein soldiers in three-cornered hats were brandishing\r\nhuge drums and slender lances. It lacked a glass, and was set in a frame\r\nornamented with bronze fretwork and bronze corner rings. Beside it hung\r\na huge, grimy oil painting representative of some flowers and fruit,\r\nhalf a water melon, a boar\'s head, and the pendent form of a dead\r\nwild duck. Attached to the ceiling there was a chandelier in a holland\r\ncovering--the covering so dusty as closely to resemble a huge cocoon\r\nenclosing a caterpillar. Lastly, in one corner of the room lay a pile\r\nof articles which had evidently been adjudged unworthy of a place on the\r\ntable. Yet what the pile consisted of it would have been difficult to\r\nsay, seeing that the dust on the same was so thick that any hand which\r\ntouched it would have at once resembled a glove. Prominently protruding\r\nfrom the pile was the shaft of a wooden spade and the antiquated sole\r\nof a shoe. Never would one have supposed that a living creature had\r\ntenanted the room, were it not that the presence of such a creature was\r\nbetrayed by the spectacle of an old nightcap resting on the table.\r\n\r\nWhilst Chichikov was gazing at this extraordinary mess, a side door\r\nopened and there entered the housekeeper who had met him near the\r\noutbuildings. But now Chichikov perceived this person to be a man rather\r\nthan a woman, since a female housekeeper would have had no beard to\r\nshave, whereas the chin of the newcomer, with the lower portion of his\r\ncheeks, strongly resembled the curry-comb which is used for grooming\r\nhorses. Chichikov assumed a questioning air, and waited to hear what the\r\nhousekeeper might have to say. The housekeeper did the same. At length,\r\nsurprised at the misunderstanding, Chichikov decided to ask the first\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n"Is the master at home?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied the person addressed.\r\n\r\n"Then where is he?" continued Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Are you blind, my good sir?" retorted the other. "_I_ am the master."\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily our hero started and stared. During his travels it had\r\nbefallen him to meet various types of men--some of them, it may be,\r\ntypes which you and I have never encountered; but even to Chichikov this\r\nparticular species was new. In the old man\'s face there was nothing very\r\nspecial--it was much like the wizened face of many another dotard, save\r\nthat the chin was so greatly projected that whenever he spoke he was\r\nforced to wipe it with a handkerchief to avoid dribbling, and that his\r\nsmall eyes were not yet grown dull, but twinkled under their overhanging\r\nbrows like the eyes of mice when, with attentive ears and sensitive\r\nwhiskers, they snuff the air and peer forth from their holes to\r\nsee whether a cat or a boy may not be in the vicinity. No, the most\r\nnoticeable feature about the man was his clothes. In no way could it\r\nhave been guessed of what his coat was made, for both its sleeves and\r\nits skirts were so ragged and filthy as to defy description, while\r\ninstead of two posterior tails, there dangled four of those appendages,\r\nwith, projecting from them, a torn newspaper. Also, around his neck\r\nthere was wrapped something which might have been a stocking, a garter,\r\nor a stomacher, but was certainly not a tie. In short, had Chichikov\r\nchanced to encounter him at a church door, he would have bestowed upon\r\nhim a copper or two (for, to do our hero justice, he had a sympathetic\r\nheart and never refrained from presenting a beggar with alms), but in\r\nthe present case there was standing before him, not a mendicant, but\r\na landowner--and a landowner possessed of fully a thousand serfs, the\r\nsuperior of all his neighbours in wealth of flour and grain, and the\r\nowner of storehouses, and so forth, that were crammed with homespun\r\ncloth and linen, tanned and undressed sheepskins, dried fish, and every\r\nconceivable species of produce. Nevertheless, such a phenomenon is\r\nrare in Russia, where the tendency is rather to prodigality than to\r\nparsimony.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes Plushkin stood mute, while Chichikov remained so\r\ndazed with the appearance of the host and everything else in the room,\r\nthat he too, could not begin a conversation, but stood wondering how\r\nbest to find words in which to explain the object of his visit. For a\r\nwhile he thought of expressing himself to the effect that, having heard\r\nso much of his host\'s benevolence and other rare qualities of spirit,\r\nhe had considered it his duty to come and pay a tribute of respect; but\r\npresently even HE came to the conclusion that this would be overdoing\r\nthe thing, and, after another glance round the room, decided that\r\nthe phrase "benevolence and other rare qualities of spirit" might to\r\nadvantage give place to "economy and genius for method." Accordingly,\r\nthe speech mentally composed, he said aloud that, having heard of\r\nPlushkin\'s talents for thrifty and systematic management, he had\r\nconsidered himself bound to make the acquaintance of his host, and\r\nto present him with his personal compliments (I need hardly say that\r\nChichikov could easily have alleged a better reason, had any better one\r\nhappened, at the moment, to have come into his head).\r\n\r\nWith toothless gums Plushkin murmured something in reply, but nothing is\r\nknown as to its precise terms beyond that it included a statement\r\nthat the devil was at liberty to fly away with Chichikov\'s sentiments.\r\nHowever, the laws of Russian hospitality do not permit even of a miser\r\ninfringing their rules; wherefore Plushkin added to the foregoing a more\r\ncivil invitation to be seated.\r\n\r\n"It is long since I last received a visitor," he went on. "Also, I feel\r\nbound to say that I can see little good in their coming. Once introduce\r\nthe abominable custom of folk paying calls, and forthwith there will\r\nensue such ruin to the management of estates that landowners will be\r\nforced to feed their horses on hay. Not for a long, long time have I\r\neaten a meal away from home--although my own kitchen is a poor one, and\r\nhas its chimney in such a state that, were it to become overheated, it\r\nwould instantly catch fire."\r\n\r\n"What a brute!" thought Chichikov. "I am lucky to have got through so\r\nmuch pastry and stuffed shoulder of mutton at Sobakevitch\'s!"\r\n\r\n"Also," went on Plushkin, "I am ashamed to say that hardly a wisp of\r\nfodder does the place contain. But how can I get fodder? My lands are\r\nsmall, and the peasantry lazy fellows who hate work and think of nothing\r\nbut the tavern. In the end, therefore, I shall be forced to go and spend\r\nmy old age in roaming about the world."\r\n\r\n"But I have been told that you possess over a thousand serfs?" said\r\nChichikov.\r\n\r\n"Who told you that? No matter who it was, you would have been justified\r\nin giving him the lie. He must have been a jester who wanted to make\r\na fool of you. A thousand souls, indeed! Why, just reckon the taxes\r\non them, and see what there would be left! For these three years that\r\naccursed fever has been killing off my serfs wholesale."\r\n\r\n"Wholesale, you say?" echoed Chichikov, greatly interested.\r\n\r\n"Yes, wholesale," replied the old man.\r\n\r\n"Then might I ask you the exact number?"\r\n\r\n"Fully eighty."\r\n\r\n"Surely not?"\r\n\r\n"But it is so."\r\n\r\n"Then might I also ask whether it is from the date of the last census\r\nrevision that you are reckoning these souls?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, damn it! And since that date I have been bled for taxes upon a\r\nhundred and twenty souls in all."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! Upon a hundred and twenty souls in all!" And Chichikov\'s\r\nsurprise and elation were such that, this said, he remained sitting\r\nopen-mouthed.\r\n\r\n"Yes, good sir," replied Plushkin. "I am too old to tell you lies, for I\r\nhave passed my seventieth year."\r\n\r\nSomehow he seemed to have taken offence at Chichikov\'s almost joyous\r\nexclamation; wherefore the guest hastened to heave a profound sigh, and\r\nto observe that he sympathised to the full with his host\'s misfortunes.\r\n\r\n"But sympathy does not put anything into one\'s pocket," retorted\r\nPlushkin. "For instance, I have a kinsman who is constantly plaguing me.\r\nHe is a captain in the army, damn him, and all day he does nothing but\r\ncall me \'dear uncle,\' and kiss my hand, and express sympathy until I am\r\nforced to stop my ears. You see, he has squandered all his money upon\r\nhis brother-officers, as well as made a fool of himself with an actress;\r\nso now he spends his time in telling me that he has a sympathetic\r\nheart!"\r\n\r\nChichikov hastened to explain that HIS sympathy had nothing in common\r\nwith the captain\'s, since he dealt, not in empty words alone, but in\r\nactual deeds; in proof of which he was ready then and there (for\r\nthe purpose of cutting the matter short, and of dispensing with\r\ncircumlocution) to transfer to himself the obligation of paying the\r\ntaxes due upon such serfs as Plushkin\'s as had, in the unfortunate\r\nmanner just described, departed this world. The proposal seemed to\r\nastonish Plushkin, for he sat staring open-eyed. At length he inquired:\r\n\r\n"My dear sir, have you seen military service?"\r\n\r\n"No," replied the other warily, "but I have been a member of the CIVIL\r\nService."\r\n\r\n"Oh! Of the CIVIL Service?" And Plushkin sat moving his lips as though\r\nhe were chewing something. "Well, what of your proposal?" he added\r\npresently. "Are you prepared to lose by it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, certainly, if thereby I can please you."\r\n\r\n"My dear sir! My good benefactor!" In his delight Plushkin lost sight of\r\nthe fact that his nose was caked with snuff of the consistency of thick\r\ncoffee, and that his coat had parted in front and was disclosing some\r\nvery unseemly underclothing. "What comfort you have brought to an old\r\nman! Yes, as God is my witness!"\r\n\r\nFor the moment he could say no more. Yet barely a minute had elapsed\r\nbefore this instantaneously aroused emotion had, as instantaneously,\r\ndisappeared from his wooden features. Once more they assumed a careworn\r\nexpression, and he even wiped his face with his handkerchief, then\r\nrolled it into a ball, and rubbed it to and fro against his upper lip.\r\n\r\n"If it will not annoy you again to state the proposal," he went on,\r\n"what you undertake to do is to pay the annual tax upon these souls, and\r\nto remit the money either to me or to the Treasury?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is how it shall be done. We will draw up a deed of purchase\r\nas though the souls were still alive and you had sold them to myself."\r\n\r\n"Quite so--a deed of purchase," echoed Plushkin, once more relapsing\r\ninto thought and the chewing motion of the lips. "But a deed of such\r\na kind will entail certain expenses, and lawyers are so devoid of\r\nconscience! In fact, so extortionate is their avarice that they will\r\ncharge one half a rouble, and then a sack of flour, and then a whole\r\nwaggon-load of meal. I wonder that no one has yet called attention to\r\nthe system."\r\n\r\nUpon that Chichikov intimated that, out of respect for his host, he\r\nhimself would bear the cost of the transfer of souls. This led Plushkin\r\nto conclude that his guest must be the kind of unconscionable fool who,\r\nwhile pretending to have been a member of the Civil Service, has in\r\nreality served in the army and run after actresses; wherefore the old\r\nman no longer disguised his delight, but called down blessings alike\r\nupon Chichikov\'s head and upon those of his children (he had never even\r\ninquired whether Chichikov possessed a family). Next, he shuffled to the\r\nwindow, and, tapping one of its panes, shouted the name of "Proshka."\r\nImmediately some one ran quickly into the hall, and, after much stamping\r\nof feet, burst into the room. This was Proshka--a thirteen-year-old\r\nyoungster who was shod with boots of such dimensions as almost to engulf\r\nhis legs as he walked. The reason why he had entered thus shod was\r\nthat Plushkin only kept one pair of boots for the whole of his domestic\r\nstaff. This universal pair was stationed in the hall of the mansion, so\r\nthat any servant who was summoned to the house might don the said boots\r\nafter wading barefooted through the mud of the courtyard, and enter\r\nthe parlour dry-shod--subsequently leaving the boots where he had found\r\nthem, and departing in his former barefooted condition. Indeed, had any\r\none, on a slushy winter\'s morning, glanced from a window into the said\r\ncourtyard, he would have seen Plushkin\'s servitors performing saltatory\r\nfeats worthy of the most vigorous of stage-dancers.\r\n\r\n"Look at that boy\'s face!" said Plushkin to Chichikov as he pointed to\r\nProshka. "It is stupid enough, yet, lay anything aside, and in a trice\r\nhe will have stolen it. Well, my lad, what do you want?"\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment or two, but Proshka made no reply.\r\n\r\n"Come, come!" went on the old man. "Set out the samovar, and then give\r\nMavra the key of the store-room--here it is--and tell her to get out\r\nsome loaf sugar for tea. Here! Wait another moment, fool! Is the devil\r\nin your legs that they itch so to be off? Listen to what more I have to\r\ntell you. Tell Mavra that the sugar on the outside of the loaf has gone\r\nbad, so that she must scrape it off with a knife, and NOT throw away\r\nthe scrapings, but give them to the poultry. Also, see that you yourself\r\ndon\'t go into the storeroom, or I will give you a birching that you\r\nwon\'t care for. Your appetite is good enough already, but a better one\r\nwon\'t hurt you. Don\'t even TRY to go into the storeroom, for I shall be\r\nwatching you from this window."\r\n\r\n"You see," the old man added to Chichikov, "one can never trust these\r\nfellows." Presently, when Proshka and the boots had departed, he fell\r\nto gazing at his guest with an equally distrustful air, since certain\r\nfeatures in Chichikov\'s benevolence now struck him as a little open to\r\nquestion, and he had begin to think to himself: "After all, the\r\ndevil only knows who he is--whether a braggart, like most of these\r\nspendthrifts, or a fellow who is lying merely in order to get some tea\r\nout of me." Finally, his circumspection, combined with a desire to\r\ntest his guest, led him to remark that it might be well to complete\r\nthe transaction IMMEDIATELY, since he had not overmuch confidence in\r\nhumanity, seeing that a man might be alive to-day and dead to-morrow.\r\n\r\nTo this Chichikov assented readily enough--merely adding that he should\r\nlike first of all to be furnished with a list of the dead souls. This\r\nreassured Plushkin as to his guest\'s intention of doing business, so\r\nhe got out his keys, approached a cupboard, and, having pulled back the\r\ndoor, rummaged among the cups and glasses with which it was filled. At\r\nlength he said:\r\n\r\n"I cannot find it now, but I used to possess a splendid bottle of\r\nliquor. Probably the servants have drunk it all, for they are such\r\nthieves. Oh no: perhaps this is it!"\r\n\r\nLooking up, Chichikov saw that Plushkin had extracted a decanter coated\r\nwith dust.\r\n\r\n"My late wife made the stuff," went on the old man, "but that rascal of\r\na housekeeper went and threw away a lot of it, and never even replaced\r\nthe stopper. Consequently bugs and other nasty creatures got into the\r\ndecanter, but I cleaned it out, and now beg to offer you a glassful."\r\n\r\nThe idea of a drink from such a receptacle was too much for Chichikov,\r\nso he excused himself on the ground that he had just had luncheon.\r\n\r\n"You have just had luncheon?" re-echoed Plushkin. "Now, THAT shows how\r\ninvariably one can tell a man of good society, wheresoever one may be.\r\nA man of that kind never eats anything--he always says that he has had\r\nenough. Very different that from the ways of a rogue, whom one can never\r\nsatisfy, however much one may give him. For instance, that captain of\r\nmine is constantly begging me to let him have a meal--though he is about\r\nas much my nephew as I am his grandfather. As it happens, there is never\r\na bite of anything in the house, so he has to go away empty. But about\r\nthe list of those good-for-nothing souls--I happen to possess such a\r\nlist, since I have drawn one up in readiness for the next revision."\r\n\r\nWith that Plushkin donned his spectacles, and once more started to\r\nrummage in the cupboard, and to smother his guest with dust as he untied\r\nsuccessive packages of papers--so much so that his victim burst out\r\nsneezing. Finally he extracted a much-scribbled document in which the\r\nnames of the deceased peasants lay as close-packed as a cloud of midges,\r\nfor there were a hundred and twenty of them in all. Chichikov grinned\r\nwith joy at the sight of the multitude. Stuffing the list into his\r\npocket, he remarked that, to complete the transaction, it would be\r\nnecessary to return to the town.\r\n\r\n"To the town?" repeated Plushkin. "But why? Moreover, how could I leave\r\nthe house, seeing that every one of my servants is either a thief or\r\na rogue? Day by day they pilfer things, until soon I shall have not a\r\nsingle coat to hang on my back."\r\n\r\n"Then you possess acquaintances in the town?"\r\n\r\n"Acquaintances? No. Every acquaintance whom I ever possessed has either\r\nleft me or is dead. But stop a moment. I DO know the President of the\r\nCouncil. Even in my old age he has once or twice come to visit me, for\r\nhe and I used to be schoolfellows, and to go climbing walls together.\r\nYes, him I do know. Shall I write him a letter?"\r\n\r\n"By all means."\r\n\r\n"Yes, him I know well, for we were friends together at school."\r\n\r\nOver Plushkin\'s wooden features there had gleamed a ray of warmth--a\r\nray which expressed, if not feeling, at all events feeling\'s pale\r\nreflection. Just such a phenomenon may be witnessed when, for a brief\r\nmoment, a drowning man makes a last re-appearance on the surface of a\r\nriver, and there rises from the crowd lining the banks a cry of hope\r\nthat even yet the exhausted hands may clutch the rope which has been\r\nthrown him--may clutch it before the surface of the unstable element\r\nshall have resumed for ever its calm, dread vacuity. But the hope is\r\nshort-lived, and the hands disappear. Even so did Plushkin\'s face,\r\nafter its momentary manifestation of feeling, become meaner and more\r\ninsensible than ever.\r\n\r\n"There used to be a sheet of clean writing paper lying on the table," he\r\nwent on. "But where it is now I cannot think. That comes of my servants\r\nbeing such rascals."\r\n\r\nWith that he fell to looking also under the table, as well as to\r\nhurrying about with cries of "Mavra, Mavra!" At length the call was\r\nanswered by a woman with a plateful of the sugar of which mention has\r\nbeen made; whereupon there ensued the following conversation.\r\n\r\n"What have you done with my piece of writing paper, you pilferer?"\r\n\r\n"I swear that I have seen no paper except the bit with which you covered\r\nthe glass."\r\n\r\n"Your very face tells me that you have made off with it."\r\n\r\n"Why should I make off with it? \'Twould be of no use to me, for I can\r\nneither read nor write."\r\n\r\n"You lie! You have taken it away for the sexton to scribble upon."\r\n\r\n"Well, if the sexton wanted paper he could get some for himself. Neither\r\nhe nor I have set eyes upon your piece."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Wait a bit, for on the Judgment Day you will be roasted by devils\r\non iron spits. Just see if you are not!"\r\n\r\n"But why should I be roasted when I have never even TOUCHED the paper?\r\nYou might accuse me of any other fault than theft."\r\n\r\n"Nay, devils shall roast you, sure enough. They will say to you, \'Bad\r\nwoman, we are doing this because you robbed your master,\' and then stoke\r\nup the fire still hotter."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless _I_ shall continue to say, \'You are roasting me for\r\nnothing, for I never stole anything at all.\' Why, THERE it is, lying on\r\nthe table! You have been accusing me for no reason whatever!"\r\n\r\nAnd, sure enough, the sheet of paper was lying before Plushkin\'s very\r\neyes. For a moment or two he chewed silently. Then he went on:\r\n\r\n"Well, and what are you making such a noise about? If one says a single\r\nword to you, you answer back with ten. Go and fetch me a candle to seal\r\na letter with. And mind you bring a TALLOW candle, for it will not cost\r\nso much as the other sort. And bring me a match too."\r\n\r\nMavra departed, and Plushkin, seating himself, and taking up a pen, sat\r\nturning the sheet of paper over and over, as though in doubt whether\r\nto tear from it yet another morsel. At length he came to the conclusion\r\nthat it was impossible to do so, and therefore, dipping the pen into the\r\nmixture of mouldy fluid and dead flies which the ink bottle contained,\r\nstarted to indite the letter in characters as bold as the notes of a\r\nmusic score, while momentarily checking the speed of his hand, lest it\r\nshould meander too much over the paper, and crawling from line to line\r\nas though he regretted that there was so little vacant space left on the\r\nsheet.\r\n\r\n"And do you happen to know any one to whom a few runaway serfs would be\r\nof use?" he asked as subsequently he folded the letter.\r\n\r\n"What? You have some runaways as well?" exclaimed Chichikov, again\r\ngreatly interested.\r\n\r\n"Certainly I have. My son-in-law has laid the necessary information\r\nagainst them, but says that their tracks have grown cold. However, he is\r\nonly a military man--that is to say, good at clinking a pair of spurs,\r\nbut of no use for laying a plea before a court."\r\n\r\n"And how many runaways have you?"\r\n\r\n"About seventy."\r\n\r\n"Surely not?"\r\n\r\n"Alas, yes. Never does a year pass without a certain number of them\r\nmaking off. Yet so gluttonous and idle are my serfs that they are simply\r\nbursting with food, whereas I scarcely get enough to eat. I will take\r\nany price for them that you may care to offer. Tell your friends about\r\nit, and, should they find even a score of the runaways, it will repay\r\nthem handsomely, seeing that a living serf on the census list is at\r\npresent worth five hundred roubles."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so, but I am not going to let any one but myself have a finger\r\nin this," thought Chichikov to himself; after which he explained to\r\nPlushkin that a friend of the kind mentioned would be impossible to\r\ndiscover, since the legal expenses of the enterprise would lead to the\r\nsaid friend having to cut the very tail from his coat before he would\r\nget clear of the lawyers.\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless," added Chichikov, "seeing that you are so hard pressed\r\nfor money, and that I am so interested in the matter, I feel moved to\r\nadvance you--well, to advance you such a trifle as would scarcely be\r\nworth mentioning."\r\n\r\n"But how much is it?" asked Plushkin eagerly, and with his hands\r\ntrembling like quicksilver.\r\n\r\n"Twenty-five kopecks per soul."\r\n\r\n"What? In ready money?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--in money down."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, consider my poverty, dear friend, and make it FORTY\r\nkopecks per soul."\r\n\r\n"Venerable sir, would that I could pay you not merely forty kopecks,\r\nbut five hundred roubles. I should be only too delighted if that were\r\npossible, since I perceive that you, an aged and respected gentleman,\r\nare suffering for your own goodness of heart."\r\n\r\n"By God, that is true, that is true." Plushkin hung his head, and wagged\r\nit feebly from side to side. "Yes, all that I have done I have done\r\npurely out of kindness."\r\n\r\n"See how instantaneously I have divined your nature! By now it will have\r\nbecome clear to you why it is impossible for me to pay you five hundred\r\nroubles per runaway soul: for by now you will have gathered the fact\r\nthat I am not sufficiently rich. Nevertheless, I am ready to add another\r\nfive kopecks, and so to make it that each runaway serf shall cost me, in\r\nall, thirty kopecks."\r\n\r\n"As you please, dear sir. Yet stretch another point, and throw in\r\nanother two kopecks."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, but I cannot. How many runaway serfs did you say that you\r\npossess? Seventy?"\r\n\r\n"No; seventy-eight."\r\n\r\n"Seventy-eight souls at thirty kopecks each will amount to--to--" only\r\nfor a moment did our hero halt, since he was strong in his arithmetic,\r\n"--will amount to twenty-four roubles, ninety-six kopecks." [28]\r\n\r\nWith that he requested Plushkin to make out the receipt, and then handed\r\nhim the money. Plushkin took it in both hands, bore it to a bureau with\r\nas much caution as though he were carrying a liquid which might at any\r\nmoment splash him in the face, and, arrived at the bureau, and glancing\r\nround once more, carefully packed the cash in one of his money bags,\r\nwhere, doubtless, it was destined to lie buried until, to the intense\r\njoy of his daughters and his son-in-law (and, perhaps, of the captain\r\nwho claimed kinship with him), he should himself receive burial at the\r\nhands of Fathers Carp and Polycarp, the two priests attached to his\r\nvillage. Lastly, the money concealed, Plushkin re-seated himself in the\r\narmchair, and seemed at a loss for further material for conversation.\r\n\r\n"Are you thinking of starting?" at length he inquired, on seeing\r\nChichikov making a trifling movement, though the movement was only\r\nto extract from his pocket a handkerchief. Nevertheless the question\r\nreminded Chichikov that there was no further excuse for lingering.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I must be going," he said as he took his hat.\r\n\r\n"Then what about the tea?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, I will have some on my next visit."\r\n\r\n"What? Even though I have just ordered the samovar to be got ready?\r\nWell, well! I myself do not greatly care for tea, for I think it an\r\nexpensive beverage. Moreover, the price of sugar has risen terribly."\r\n\r\n"Proshka!" he then shouted. "The samovar will not be needed. Return the\r\nsugar to Mavra, and tell her to put it back again. But no. Bring the\r\nsugar here, and _I_ will put it back."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, dear sir," finally he added to Chichikov. "May the Lord bless\r\nyou! Hand that letter to the President of the Council, and let him\r\nread it. Yes, he is an old friend of mine. We knew one another as\r\nschoolfellows."\r\n\r\nWith that this strange phenomenon, this withered old man, escorted his\r\nguest to the gates of the courtyard, and, after the guest had departed,\r\nordered the gates to be closed, made the round of the outbuildings for\r\nthe purpose of ascertaining whether the numerous watchmen were at their\r\nposts, peered into the kitchen (where, under the pretence of seeing\r\nwhether his servants were being properly fed, he made a light meal\r\nof cabbage soup and gruel), rated the said servants soundly for their\r\nthievishness and general bad behaviour, and then returned to his room.\r\nMeditating in solitude, he fell to thinking how best he could contrive\r\nto recompense his guest for the latter\'s measureless benevolence. "I\r\nwill present him," he thought to himself, "with a watch. It is a good\r\nsilver article--not one of those cheap metal affairs; and though it\r\nhas suffered some damage, he can easily get that put right. A young man\r\nalways needs to give a watch to his betrothed."\r\n\r\n"No," he added after further thought. "I will leave him the watch in my\r\nwill, as a keepsake."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile our hero was bowling along in high spirit. Such an unexpected\r\nacquisition both of dead souls and of runaway serfs had come as\r\na windfall. Even before reaching Plushkin\'s village he had had a\r\npresentiment that he would do successful business there, but not\r\nbusiness of such pre-eminent profitableness as had actually resulted.\r\nAs he proceeded he whistled, hummed with hand placed trumpetwise to his\r\nmouth, and ended by bursting into a burst of melody so striking that\r\nSelifan, after listening for a while, nodded his head and exclaimed, "My\r\nword, but the master CAN sing!"\r\n\r\nBy the time they reached the town darkness had fallen, and changed the\r\ncharacter of the scene. The britchka bounded over the cobblestones, and\r\nat length turned into the hostelry\'s courtyard, where the travellers\r\nwere met by Petrushka. With one hand holding back the tails of his coat\r\n(which he never liked to see fly apart), the valet assisted his\r\nmaster to alight. The waiter ran out with candle in hand and napkin on\r\nshoulder. Whether or not Petrushka was glad to see the barin return\r\nit is impossible to say, but at all events he exchanged a wink with\r\nSelifan, and his ordinarily morose exterior seemed momentarily to\r\nbrighten.\r\n\r\n"Then you have been travelling far, sir?" said the waiter, as he lit the\r\nway upstarts.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Chichikov. "What has happened here in the meanwhile?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, sir," replied the waiter, bowing, "except that last night\r\nthere arrived a military lieutenant. He has got room number sixteen."\r\n\r\n"A lieutenant?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He came from Riazan, driving three grey horses."\r\n\r\nOn entering his room, Chichikov clapped his hand to his nose, and asked\r\nhis valet why he had never had the windows opened.\r\n\r\n"But I did have them opened," replied Petrushka. Nevertheless this was\r\na lie, as Chichikov well knew, though he was too tired to contest the\r\npoint. After ordering and consuming a light supper of sucking pig, he\r\nundressed, plunged beneath the bedclothes, and sank into the profound\r\nslumber which comes only to such fortunate folk as are troubled neither\r\nwith mosquitoes nor fleas nor excessive activity of brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nWhen Chichikov awoke he stretched himself and realised that he had slept\r\nwell. For a moment or two he lay on his back, and then suddenly clapped\r\nhis hands at the recollection that he was now owner of nearly four\r\nhundred souls. At once he leapt out of bed without so much as glancing\r\nat his face in the mirror, though, as a rule, he had much solicitude for\r\nhis features, and especially for his chin, of which he would make the\r\nmost when in company with friends, and more particularly should any one\r\nhappen to enter while he was engaged in the process of shaving. "Look\r\nhow round my chin is!" was his usual formula. On the present occasion,\r\nhowever, he looked neither at chin nor at any other feature, but at once\r\ndonned his flower-embroidered slippers of morroco leather (the kind\r\nof slippers in which, thanks to the Russian love for a dressing-gowned\r\nexistence, the town of Torzhok does such a huge trade), and, clad only\r\nin a meagre shirt, so far forgot his elderliness and dignity as to cut\r\na couple of capers after the fashion of a Scottish highlander--alighting\r\nneatly, each time, on the flat of his heels. Only when he had done that\r\ndid he proceed to business. Planting himself before his dispatch-box,\r\nhe rubbed his hands with a satisfaction worthy of an incorruptible rural\r\nmagistrate when adjourning for luncheon; after which he extracted from\r\nthe receptacle a bundle of papers. These he had decided not to deposit\r\nwith a lawyer, for the reason that he would hasten matters, as well as\r\nsave expense, by himself framing and fair-copying the necessary deeds\r\nof indenture; and since he was thoroughly acquainted with the necessary\r\nterminology, he proceeded to inscribe in large characters the date, and\r\nthen in smaller ones, his name and rank. By two o\'clock the whole was\r\nfinished, and as he looked at the sheets of names representing bygone\r\npeasants who had ploughed, worked at handicrafts, cheated their masters,\r\nfetched, carried, and got drunk (though SOME of them may have behaved\r\nwell), there came over him a strange, unaccountable sensation. To his\r\neye each list of names seemed to possess a character of its own;\r\nand even individual peasants therein seemed to have taken on certain\r\nqualities peculiar to themselves. For instance, to the majority of\r\nMadame Korobotchka\'s serfs there were appended nicknames and other\r\nadditions; Plushkin\'s list was distinguished by a conciseness of\r\nexposition which had led to certain of the items being represented\r\nmerely by Christian name, patronymic, and a couple of dots;\r\nand Sobakevitch\'s list was remarkable for its amplitude and\r\ncircumstantiality, in that not a single peasant had such of his peculiar\r\ncharacteristics omitted as that the deceased had been "excellent at\r\njoinery," or "sober and ready to pay attention to his work." Also, in\r\nSobakevitch\'s list there was recorded who had been the father and\r\nthe mother of each of the deceased, and how those parents had behaved\r\nthemselves. Only against the name of a certain Thedotov was there\r\ninscribed: "Father unknown, Mother the maidservant Kapitolina, Morals\r\nand Honesty good." These details communicated to the document a certain\r\nair of freshness, they seemed to connote that the peasants in question\r\nhad lived but yesterday. As Chichikov scanned the list he felt softened\r\nin spirit, and said with a sigh:\r\n\r\n"My friends, what a concourse of you is here! How did you all pass your\r\nlives, my brethren? And how did you all come to depart hence?"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke his eyes halted at one name in particular--that of the same\r\nPeter Saveliev Neuvazhai Korito who had once been the property of the\r\nwindow Korobotchka. Once more he could not help exclaiming:\r\n\r\n"What a series of titles! They occupy a whole line! Peter Saveliev, I\r\nwonder whether you were an artisan or a plain muzhik. Also, I wonder how\r\nyou came to meet your end; whether in a tavern, or whether through going\r\nto sleep in the middle of the road and being run over by a train of\r\nwaggons. Again, I see the name, \'Probka Stepan, carpenter, very sober.\'\r\nThat must be the hero of whom the Guards would have been so glad to get\r\nhold. How well I can imagine him tramping the country with an axe in his\r\nbelt and his boots on his shoulder, and living on a few groats\'-worth\r\nof bread and dried fish per day, and taking home a couple of half-rouble\r\npieces in his purse, and sewing the notes into his breeches, or stuffing\r\nthem into his boots! In what manner came you by your end, Probka Stepan?\r\nDid you, for good wages, mount a scaffold around the cupola of the\r\nvillage church, and, climbing thence to the cross above, miss your\r\nfooting on a beam, and fall headlong with none at hand but Uncle\r\nMichai--the good uncle who, scratching the back of his neck, and\r\nmuttering, \'Ah, Vania, for once you have been too clever!\' straightway\r\nlashed himself to a rope, and took your place? \'Maksim Teliatnikov,\r\nshoemaker.\' A shoemaker, indeed? \'As drunk as a shoemaker,\' says the\r\nproverb. _I_ know what you were like, my friend. If you wish, I will\r\ntell you your whole history. You were apprenticed to a German, who fed\r\nyou and your fellows at a common table, thrashed you with a strap,\r\nkept you indoors whenever you had made a mistake, and spoke of you in\r\nuncomplimentary terms to his wife and friends. At length, when your\r\napprenticeship was over, you said to yourself, \'I am going to set up\r\non my own account, and not just to scrape together a kopeck here and a\r\nkopeck there, as the Germans do, but to grow rich quick.\' Hence you took\r\na shop at a high rent, bespoke a few orders, and set to work to buy up\r\nsome rotten leather out of which you could make, on each pair of boots,\r\na double profit. But those boots split within a fortnight, and brought\r\ndown upon your head dire showers of maledictions; with the result that\r\ngradually your shop grew empty of customers, and you fell to roaming\r\nthe streets and exclaiming, \'The world is a very poor place indeed!\r\nA Russian cannot make a living for German competition.\' Well, well!\r\n\'Elizabeta Vorobei!\' But that is a WOMAN\'S name! How comes SHE to be on\r\nthe list? That villain Sobakevitch must have sneaked her in without my\r\nknowing it."\r\n\r\n"\'Grigori Goiezhai-ne-Doiedesh,\'" he went on. "What sort of a man were\r\nYOU, I wonder? Were you a carrier who, having set up a team of three\r\nhorses and a tilt waggon, left your home, your native hovel, for ever,\r\nand departed to cart merchandise to market? Was it on the highway that\r\nyou surrendered your soul to God, or did your friends first marry you\r\nto some fat, red-faced soldier\'s daughter; after which your harness and\r\nteam of rough, but sturdy, horses caught a highwayman\'s fancy, and you,\r\nlying on your pallet, thought things over until, willy-nilly, you felt\r\nthat you must get up and make for the tavern, thereafter blundering into\r\nan icehole? Ah, our peasant of Russia! Never do you welcome death when\r\nit comes!"\r\n\r\n"And you, my friends?" continued Chichikov, turning to the sheet whereon\r\nwere inscribed the names of Plushkin\'s absconded serfs. "Although you\r\nare still alive, what is the good of you? You are practically dead.\r\nWhither, I wonder, have your fugitive feet carried you? Did you fare\r\nhardly at Plushkin\'s, or was it that your natural inclinations led you\r\nto prefer roaming the wilds and plundering travellers? Are you, by this\r\ntime, in gaol, or have you taken service with other masters for the\r\ntillage of their lands? \'Eremei Kariakin, Nikita Volokita and Anton\r\nVolokita (son of the foregoing).\' To judge from your surnames, you would\r\nseem to have been born gadabouts [29]. \'Popov, household serf.\' Probably\r\nyou are an educated man, good Popov, and go in for polite thieving, as\r\ndistinguished from the more vulgar cut-throat sort. In my mind\'s eye I\r\nseem to see a Captain of Rural Police challenging you for being without\r\na passport; whereupon you stake your all upon a single throw. \'To whom\r\ndo you belong?\' asks the Captain, probably adding to his question a\r\nforcible expletive. \'To such and such a landowner,\' stoutly you reply.\r\n\'And what are you doing here?\' continues the Captain. \'I have\r\njust received permission to go and earn my obrok,\' is your fluent\r\nexplanation. \'Then where is your passport?\' \'At Miestchanin [30]\r\nPimenov\'s.\' \'Pimenov\'s? Then are you Pimenov himself?\' \'Yes, I am\r\nPimenov himself.\' \'He has given you his passport?\' \'No, he has not given\r\nme his passport.\' \'Come, come!\' shouts the Captain with another forcible\r\nexpletive. \'You are lying!\' \'No, I am not,\' is your dogged reply. \'It is\r\nonly that last night I could not return him his passport, because I came\r\nhome late; so I handed it to Antip Prochorov, the bell-ringer, for him\r\nto take care of.\' \'Bell-ringer, indeed! Then HE gave you a passport?\'\r\n\'No; I did not receive a passport from him either.\' \'What?\'--and here\r\nthe Captain shouts another expletive--\'How dare you keep on lying? Where\r\nis YOUR OWN passport?\' \'I had one all right,\' you reply cunningly, \'but\r\nmust have dropped it somewhere on the road as I came along.\' \'And what\r\nabout that soldier\'s coat?\' asks the Captain with an impolite addition.\r\n\'Whence did you get it? And what of the priest\'s cashbox and copper\r\nmoney?\'\' \'About them I know nothing,\' you reply doggedly. \'Never at any\r\ntime have I committed a theft.\' \'Then how is it that the coat was found\r\nat your place?\' \'I do not know. Probably some one else put it there.\'\r\n\'You rascal, you rascal!\' shouts the Captain, shaking his head, and\r\nclosing in upon you. \'Put the leg-irons upon him, and off with him to\r\nprison!\' \'With pleasure,\' you reply as, taking a snuff-box from your\r\npocket, you offer a pinch to each of the two gendarmes who are manacling\r\nyou, while also inquiring how long they have been discharged from the\r\narmy, and in what wars they may have served. And in prison you remain\r\nuntil your case comes on, when the justice orders you to be removed from\r\nTsarev-Kokshaika to such and such another prison, and a second justice\r\norders you to be transferred thence to Vesiegonsk or somewhere else, and\r\nyou go flitting from gaol to gaol, and saying each time, as you eye your\r\nnew habitation, \'The last place was a good deal cleaner than this one\r\nis, and one could play babki [31] there, and stretch one\'s legs, and see\r\na little society.\'"\r\n\r\n"\'Abakum Thirov,\'" Chichikov went on after a pause. "What of YOU,\r\nbrother? Where, and in what capacity, are YOU disporting yourself?\r\nHave you gone to the Volga country, and become bitten with the life of\r\nfreedom, and joined the fishermen of the river?"\r\n\r\nHere, breaking off, Chichikov relapsed into silent meditation. Of what\r\nwas he thinking as he sat there? Was he thinking of the fortunes of\r\nAbakum Thirov, or was he meditating as meditates every Russian when his\r\nthoughts once turn to the joys of an emancipated existence?\r\n\r\n"Ah, well!" he sighed, looking at his watch. "It has now gone twelve\r\no\'clock. Why have I so forgotten myself? There is still much to be done,\r\nyet I go shutting myself up and letting my thoughts wander! What a fool\r\nI am!"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he exchanged his Scottish costume (of a shirt and nothing\r\nelse) for attire of a more European nature; after which he pulled\r\ntight the waistcoat over his ample stomach, sprinkled himself with\r\neau-de-Cologne, tucked his papers under his arm, took his fur cap, and\r\nset out for the municipal offices, for the purpose of completing the\r\ntransfer of souls. The fact that he hurried along was not due to a fear\r\nof being late (seeing that the President of the Local Council was an\r\nintimate acquaintance of his, as well as a functionary who could shorten\r\nor prolong an interview at will, even as Homer\'s Zeus was able to\r\nshorten or to prolong a night or a day, whenever it became necessary to\r\nput an end to the fighting of his favourite heroes, or to enable them\r\nto join battle), but rather to a feeling that he would like to have the\r\naffair concluded as quickly as possible, seeing that, throughout, it had\r\nbeen an anxious and difficult business. Also, he could not get rid of\r\nthe idea that his souls were unsubstantial things, and that therefore,\r\nunder the circumstances, his shoulders had better be relieved of their\r\nload with the least possible delay. Pulling on his cinnamon-coloured,\r\nbear-lined overcoat as he went, he had just stepped thoughtfully into\r\nthe street when he collided with a gentleman dressed in a similar\r\ncoat and an ear-lappeted fur cap. Upon that the gentleman uttered an\r\nexclamation. Behold, it was Manilov! At once the friends became folded\r\nin a strenuous embrace, and remained so locked for fully five minutes.\r\nIndeed, the kisses exchanged were so vigorous that both suffered from\r\ntoothache for the greater portion of the day. Also, Manilov\'s delight\r\nwas such that only his nose and lips remained visible--the eyes\r\ncompletely disappeared. Afterwards he spent about a quarter of an hour\r\nin holding Chichikov\'s hand and chafing it vigorously. Lastly, he, in\r\nthe most pleasant and exquisite terms possible, intimated to his friend\r\nthat he had just been on his way to embrace Paul Ivanovitch; and upon\r\nthis followed a compliment of the kind which would more fittingly have\r\nbeen addressed to a lady who was being asked to accord a partner the\r\nfavour of a dance. Chichikov had opened his mouth to reply--though\r\neven HE felt at a loss how to acknowledge what had just been said--when\r\nManilov cut him short by producing from under his coat a roll of paper\r\ntied with red riband.\r\n\r\n"What have you there?" asked Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"The list of my souls."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" And as Chichikov unrolled the document and ran his eye over it\r\nhe could not but marvel at the elegant neatness with which it had been\r\ninscribed.\r\n\r\n"It is a beautiful piece of writing," he said. "In fact, there will be\r\nno need to make a copy of it. Also, it has a border around its edge! Who\r\nworked that exquisite border?"\r\n\r\n"Do not ask me," said Manilov.\r\n\r\n"Did YOU do it?"\r\n\r\n"No; my wife."\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear!" Chichikov cried. "To think that I should have put her to\r\nso much trouble!"\r\n\r\n"NOTHING could be too much trouble where Paul Ivanovitch is concerned."\r\n\r\nChichikov bowed his acknowledgements. Next, on learning that he was\r\non his way to the municipal offices for the purpose of completing the\r\ntransfer, Manilov expressed his readiness to accompany him; wherefore\r\nthe pair linked arm in arm and proceeded together. Whenever they\r\nencountered a slight rise in the ground--even the smallest unevenness\r\nor difference of level--Manilov supported Chichikov with such energy as\r\nalmost to lift him off his feet, while accompanying the service with a\r\nsmiling implication that not if HE could help it should Paul Ivanovitch\r\nslip or fall. Nevertheless this conduct appeared to embarrass Chichikov,\r\neither because he could not find any fitting words of gratitude or\r\nbecause he considered the proceeding tiresome; and it was with a\r\nsense of relief that he debouched upon the square where the municipal\r\noffices--a large, three-storied building of a chalky whiteness which\r\nprobably symbolised the purity of the souls engaged within--were\r\nsituated. No other building in the square could vie with them in size,\r\nseeing that the remaining edifices consisted only of a sentry-box, a\r\nshelter for two or three cabmen, and a long hoarding--the latter adorned\r\nwith the usual bills, posters, and scrawls in chalk and charcoal. At\r\nintervals, from the windows of the second and third stories of the\r\nmunicipal offices, the incorruptible heads of certain of the attendant\r\npriests of Themis would peer quickly forth, and as quickly disappear\r\nagain--probably for the reason that a superior official had just entered\r\nthe room. Meanwhile the two friends ascended the staircase--nay, almost\r\nflew up it, since, longing to get rid of Manilov\'s ever-supporting\r\narm, Chichikov hastened his steps, and Manilov kept darting forward to\r\nanticipate any possible failure on the part of his companion\'s legs.\r\nConsequently the pair were breathless when they reached the first\r\ncorridor. In passing it may be remarked that neither corridors nor rooms\r\nevinced any of that cleanliness and purity which marked the exterior of\r\nthe building, for such attributes were not troubled about within, and\r\nanything that was dirty remained so, and donned no meritricious, purely\r\nexternal, disguise. It was as though Themis received her visitors in\r\nneglige and a dressing-gown. The author would also give a description of\r\nthe various offices through which our hero passed, were it not that he\r\n(the author) stands in awe of such legal haunts.\r\n\r\nApproaching the first desk which he happened to encounter, Chichikov\r\ninquired of the two young officials who were seated at it whether they\r\nwould kindly tell him where business relating to serf-indenture was\r\ntransacted.\r\n\r\n"Of what nature, precisely, IS your business?" countered one of the\r\nyouthful officials as he turned himself round.\r\n\r\n"I desire to make an application."\r\n\r\n"In connection with a purchase?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. But, as I say, I should like first to know where I can find the\r\ndesk devoted to such business. Is it here or elsewhere?"\r\n\r\n"You must state what it is you have bought, and for how much. THEN we\r\nshall be happy to give you the information."\r\n\r\nChichikov perceived that the officials\' motive was merely one of\r\ncuriosity, as often happens when young tchinovniks desire to cut a more\r\nimportant and imposing figure than is rightfully theirs.\r\n\r\n"Look here, young sirs," he said. "I know for a fact that all serf\r\nbusiness, no matter to what value, is transacted at one desk alone.\r\nConsequently I again request you to direct me to that desk. Of course,\r\nif you do not know your business I can easily ask some one else."\r\n\r\nTo this the tchinovniks made no reply beyond pointing towards a corner\r\nof the room where an elderly man appeared to be engaged in sorting some\r\npapers. Accordingly Chichikov and Manilov threaded their way in his\r\ndirection through the desks; whereupon the elderly man became violently\r\nbusy.\r\n\r\n"Would you mind telling me," said Chichikov, bowing, "whether this is\r\nthe desk for serf affairs?"\r\n\r\nThe elderly man raised his eyes, and said stiffly:\r\n\r\n"This is NOT the desk for serf affairs."\r\n\r\n"Where is it, then?"\r\n\r\n"In the Serf Department."\r\n\r\n"And where might the Serf Department be?"\r\n\r\n"In charge of Ivan Antonovitch."\r\n\r\n"And where is Ivan Antonovitch?"\r\n\r\nThe elderly man pointed to another corner of the room; whither\r\nChichikov and Manilov next directed their steps. As they advanced, Ivan\r\nAntonovitch cast an eye backwards and viewed them askance. Then, with\r\nrenewed ardour, he resumed his work of writing.\r\n\r\n"Would you mind telling me," said Chichikov, bowing, "whether this is\r\nthe desk for serf affairs?"\r\n\r\nIt appeared as though Ivan Antonovitch had not heard, so completely did\r\nhe bury himself in his papers and return no reply. Instantly it became\r\nplain that HE at least was of an age of discretion, and not one of your\r\njejune chatterboxes and harum-scarums; for, although his hair was still\r\nthick and black, he had long ago passed his fortieth year. His whole\r\nface tended towards the nose--it was what, in common parlance, is known\r\nas a "pitcher-mug."\r\n\r\n"Would you mind telling me," repeated Chichikov, "whether this is the\r\ndesk for serf affairs?"\r\n\r\n"It is that," said Ivan Antonovitch, again lowering his jug-shaped jowl,\r\nand resuming his writing.\r\n\r\n"Then I should like to transact the following business. From various\r\nlandowners in this canton I have purchased a number of peasants for\r\ntransfer. Here is the purchase list, and it needs but to be registered."\r\n\r\n"Have you also the vendors here?"\r\n\r\n"Some of them, and from the rest I have obtained powers of attorney."\r\n\r\n"And have you your statement of application?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I desire--indeed, it is necessary for me so to do--to hasten\r\nmatters a little. Could the affair, therefore, be carried through\r\nto-day?"\r\n\r\n"To-day? Oh, dear no!" said Ivan Antonovitch. "Before that can be done\r\nyou must furnish me with further proofs that no impediments exist."\r\n\r\n"Then, to expedite matters, let me say that Ivan Grigorievitch, the\r\nPresident of the Council, is a very intimate friend of mine."\r\n\r\n"Possibly," said Ivan Antonovitch without enthusiasm. "But Ivan\r\nGrigorievitch alone will not do--it is customary to have others as\r\nwell."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but the absence of others will not altogether invalidate the\r\ntransaction. I too have been in the service, and know how things can be\r\ndone."\r\n\r\n"You had better go and see Ivan Grigorievitch," said Ivan Antonovitch\r\nmore mildly. "Should he give you an order addressed to whom it may\r\nconcern, we shall soon be able to settle the matter."\r\n\r\nUpon that Chichikov pulled from his pocket a paper, and laid it before\r\nIvan Antonovitch. At once the latter covered it with a book. Chichikov\r\nagain attempted to show it to him, but, with a movement of his head,\r\nIvan Antonovitch signified that that was unnecessary.\r\n\r\n"A clerk," he added, "will now conduct you to Ivan Grigorievitch\'s\r\nroom."\r\n\r\nUpon that one of the toilers in the service of Themis--a zealot who\r\nhad offered her such heartfelt sacrifice that his coat had burst at the\r\nelbows and lacked a lining--escorted our friends (even as Virgil had\r\nonce escorted Dante) to the apartment of the Presence. In this sanctum\r\nwere some massive armchairs, a table laden with two or three fat books,\r\nand a large looking-glass. Lastly, in (apparently) sunlike isolation,\r\nthere was seated at the table the President. On arriving at the door of\r\nthe apartment, our modern Virgil seemed to have become so overwhelmed\r\nwith awe that, without daring even to intrude a foot, he turned back,\r\nand, in so doing, once more exhibited a back as shiny as a mat, and\r\nhaving adhering to it, in one spot, a chicken\'s feather. As soon as the\r\ntwo friends had entered the hall of the Presence they perceived that the\r\nPresident was NOT alone, but, on the contrary, had seated by his side\r\nSobakevitch, whose form had hitherto been concealed by the intervening\r\nmirror. The newcomers\' entry evoked sundry exclamations and the\r\npushing back of a pair of Government chairs as the voluminous-sleeved\r\nSobakevitch rose into view from behind the looking-glass. Chichikov\r\nthe President received with an embrace, and for a while the hall of\r\nthe Presence resounded with osculatory salutations as mutually the pair\r\ninquired after one another\'s health. It seemed that both had lately\r\nhad a touch of that pain under the waistband which comes of a sedentary\r\nlife. Also, it seemed that the President had just been conversing with\r\nSobakevitch on the subject of sales of souls, since he now proceeded\r\nto congratulate Chichikov on the same--a proceeding which rather\r\nembarrassed our hero, seeing that Manilov and Sobakevitch, two of\r\nthe vendors, and persons with whom he had bargained in the strictest\r\nprivacy, were now confronting one another direct. However, Chichikov\r\nduly thanked the President, and then, turning to Sobakevitch, inquired\r\nafter HIS health.\r\n\r\n"Thank God, I have nothing to complain of," replied Sobakevitch: which\r\nwas true enough, seeing that a piece of iron would have caught cold and\r\ntaken to sneezing sooner than would that uncouthly fashioned landowner.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; you have always had good health, have you not?" put in the\r\nPresident. "Your late father was equally strong."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he even went out bear hunting alone," replied Sobakevitch.\r\n\r\n"I should think that you too could worst a bear if you were to try a\r\ntussle with him," rejoined the President.\r\n\r\n"Oh no," said Sobakevitch. "My father was a stronger man than I am."\r\nThen with a sigh the speaker added: "But nowadays there are no such men\r\nas he. What is even a life like mine worth?"\r\n\r\n"Then you do not have a comfortable time of it?" exclaimed the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n"No; far from it," rejoined Sobakevitch, shaking his head. "Judge for\r\nyourself, Ivan Grigorievitch. I am fifty years old, yet never in my life\r\nhad been ill, except for an occasional carbuncle or boil. That is not a\r\ngood sign. Sooner or later I shall have to pay for it." And he relapsed\r\ninto melancholy.\r\n\r\n"Just listen to the fellow!" was Chichikov\'s and the President\'s joint\r\ninward comment. "What on earth has HE to complain of?"\r\n\r\n"I have a letter for you, Ivan Grigorievitch," went on Chichikov aloud\r\nas he produced from his pocket Plushkin\'s epistle.\r\n\r\n"From whom?" inquired the President. Having broken the seal, he\r\nexclaimed: "Why, it is from Plushkin! To think that HE is still alive!\r\nWhat a strange world it is! He used to be such a nice fellow, and now--"\r\n\r\n"And now he is a cur," concluded Sobakevitch, "as well as a miser who\r\nstarves his serfs to death."\r\n\r\n"Allow me a moment," said the President. Then he read the letter\r\nthrough. When he had finished he added: "Yes, I am quite ready to act\r\nas Plushkin\'s attorney. When do you wish the purchase deeds to be\r\nregistered, Monsieur Chichikov--now or later?"\r\n\r\n"Now, if you please," replied Chichikov. "Indeed, I beg that, if\r\npossible, the affair may be concluded to-day, since to-morrow I wish to\r\nleave the town. I have brought with me both the forms of indenture and\r\nmy statement of application."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Nevertheless we cannot let you depart so soon. The\r\nindentures shall be completed to-day, but you must continue your sojourn\r\nin our midst. I will issue the necessary orders at once."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he opened the door into the general office, where the clerks\r\nlooked like a swarm of bees around a honeycomb (if I may liken affairs\r\nof Government to such an article?).\r\n\r\n"Is Ivan Antonovitch here?" asked the President.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied a voice from within.\r\n\r\n"Then send him here."\r\n\r\nUpon that the pitcher-faced Ivan Antonovitch made his appearance in the\r\ndoorway, and bowed.\r\n\r\n"Take these indentures, Ivan Antonovitch," said the President, "and see\r\nthat they--"\r\n\r\n"But first I would ask you to remember," put in Sobakevitch, "that\r\nwitnesses ought to be in attendance--not less than two on behalf of\r\neither party. Let us, therefore, send for the Public Prosecutor, who has\r\nlittle to do, and has even that little done for him by his chief clerk,\r\nZolotucha. The Inspector of the Medical Department is also a man of\r\nleisure, and likely to be at home--if he has not gone out to a card\r\nparty. Others also there are--all men who cumber the ground for\r\nnothing."\r\n\r\n"Quite so, quite so," agreed the President, and at once dispatched a\r\nclerk to fetch the persons named.\r\n\r\n"Also," requested Chichikov, "I should be glad if you would send for the\r\naccredited representative of a certain lady landowner with whom I have\r\ndone business. He is the son of a Father Cyril, and a clerk in your\r\noffices."\r\n\r\n"Certainly we shall call him here," replied the President. "Everything\r\nshall be done to meet your convenience, and I forbid you to present any\r\nof our officials with a gratuity. That is a special request on my part.\r\nNo friend of mine ever pays a copper."\r\n\r\nWith that he gave Ivan Antonovitch the necessary instructions; and\r\nthough they scarcely seemed to meet with that functionary\'s approval,\r\nupon the President the purchase deeds had evidently produced an\r\nexcellent impression, more especially since the moment when he had\r\nperceived the sum total to amount to nearly a hundred thousand roubles.\r\nFor a moment or two he gazed into Chichikov\'s eyes with an expression of\r\nprofound satisfaction. Then he said:\r\n\r\n"Well done, Paul Ivanovitch! You have indeed made a nice haul!"\r\n\r\n"That is so," replied Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Excellent business! Yes, excellent business!"\r\n\r\n"I, too, conceive that I could not well have done better. The truth is\r\nthat never until a man has driven home the piles of his life\'s structure\r\nupon a lasting bottom, instead of upon the wayward chimeras of youth,\r\nwill his aims in life assume a definite end." And, that said, Chichikov\r\nwent on to deliver himself of a very telling indictment of Liberalism\r\nand our modern young men. Yet in his words there seemed to lurk a\r\ncertain lack of conviction. Somehow he seemed secretly to be saying to\r\nhimself, "My good sir, you are talking the most absolute rubbish, and\r\nnothing but rubbish." Nor did he even throw a glance at Sobakevitch and\r\nManilov. It was as though he were uncertain what he might not encounter\r\nin their expression. Yet he need not have been afraid. Never once did\r\nSobakevitch\'s face move a muscle, and, as for Manilov, he was too much\r\nunder the spell of Chichikov\'s eloquence to do aught beyond nod his\r\napproval at intervals, and strike the kind of attitude which is assumed\r\nby lovers of music when a lady singer has, in rivalry of an accompanying\r\nviolin, produced a note whereof the shrillness would exceed even the\r\ncapacity of a bird\'s throstle.\r\n\r\n"But why not tell Ivan Grigorievitch precisely what you have bought?"\r\ninquired Sobakevitch of Chichikov. "And why, Ivan Grigorievitch, do YOU\r\nnot ask Monsieur Chichikov precisely what his purchases have consisted\r\nof? What a splendid lot of serfs, to be sure! I myself have sold him my\r\nwheelwright, Michiev."\r\n\r\n"What? You have sold him Michiev?" exclaimed the President. "I know the\r\nman well. He is a splendid craftsman, and, on one occasion, made me a\r\ndrozhki [32]. Only, only--well, lately didn\'t you tell me that he is\r\ndead?"\r\n\r\n"That Michiev is dead?" re-echoed Sobakevitch, coming perilously near\r\nto laughing. "Oh dear no! That was his brother. Michiev himself is very\r\nmuch alive, and in even better health than he used to be. Any day he\r\ncould knock you up a britchka such as you could not procure even in\r\nMoscow. However, he is now bound to work for only one master."\r\n\r\n"Indeed a splendid craftsman!" repeated the President. "My only wonder\r\nis that you can have brought yourself to part with him."\r\n\r\n"Then think you that Michiev is the ONLY serf with whom I have parted?\r\nNay, for I have parted also with Probka Stepan, my carpenter, with\r\nMilushkin, my bricklayer, and with Teliatnikov, my bootmaker. Yes, the\r\nwhole lot I have sold."\r\n\r\nAnd to the President\'s inquiry why he had so acted, seeing that the\r\nserfs named were all skilled workers and indispensable to a household,\r\nSobakevitch replied that a mere whim had led him to do so, and thus the\r\nsale had owed its origin to a piece of folly. Then he hung his head as\r\nthough already repenting of his rash act, and added:\r\n\r\n"Although a man of grey hairs, I have not yet learned wisdom."\r\n\r\n"But," inquired the President further, "how comes it about, Paul\r\nIvanovitch, that you have purchased peasants apart from land? Is it for\r\ntransferment elsewhere that you need them?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then. That is quite another matter. To what province of the\r\ncountry?"\r\n\r\n"To the province of Kherson."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! That region contains some splendid land," said the President;\r\nwhereupon he proceeded to expatiate on the fertility of the Kherson\r\npastures.\r\n\r\n"And have you MUCH land there?" he continued.\r\n\r\n"Yes; quite sufficient to accommodate the serfs whom I have purchased."\r\n\r\n"And is there a river on the estate or a lake?"\r\n\r\n"Both."\r\n\r\nAfter this reply Chichikov involuntarily threw a glance at Sobakevitch;\r\nand though that landowner\'s face was as motionless as every other, the\r\nother seemed to detect in it: "You liar! Don\'t tell ME that you own both\r\na river and a lake, as well as the land which you say you do."\r\n\r\nWhilst the foregoing conversation had been in progress, various\r\nwitnesses had been arriving on the scene. They consisted of the\r\nconstantly blinking Public Prosecutor, the Inspector of the Medical\r\nDepartment, and others--all, to quote Sobakevitch, "men who cumbered\r\nthe ground for nothing." With some of them, however, Chichikov was\r\naltogether unacquainted, since certain substitutes and supernumeraries\r\nhad to be pressed into the service from among the ranks of the\r\nsubordinate staff. There also arrived, in answer to the summons, not\r\nonly the son of Father Cyril before mentioned, but also Father Cyril\r\nhimself. Each such witness appended to his signature a full list of his\r\ndignities and qualifications: one man in printed characters, another in\r\na flowing hand, a third in topsy-turvy characters of a kind never before\r\nseen in the Russian alphabet, and so forth. Meanwhile our friend Ivan\r\nAntonovitch comported himself with not a little address; and after the\r\nindentures had been signed, docketed, and registered, Chichikov\r\nfound himself called upon to pay only the merest trifle in the way of\r\nGovernment percentage and fees for publishing the transaction in the\r\nOfficial Gazette. The reason of this was that the President had given\r\norders that only half the usual charges were to be exacted from the\r\npresent purchaser--the remaining half being somehow debited to the\r\naccount of another applicant for serf registration.\r\n\r\n"And now," said Ivan Grigorievitch when all was completed, "we need only\r\nto wet the bargain."\r\n\r\n"For that too I am ready," said Chichikov. "Do you but name the hour.\r\nIf, in return for your most agreeable company, I were not to set a few\r\nchampagne corks flying, I should be indeed in default."\r\n\r\n"But we are not going to let you charge yourself with anything\r\nwhatsoever. WE must provide the champagne, for you are our guest, and\r\nit is for us--it is our duty, it is our bounden obligation--to entertain\r\nyou. Look here, gentlemen. Let us adjourn to the house of the Chief\r\nof Police. He is the magician who needs but to wink when passing a\r\nfishmonger\'s or a wine merchant\'s. Not only shall we fare well at his\r\nplace, but also we shall get a game of whist."\r\n\r\nTo this proposal no one had any objection to offer, for the mere mention\r\nof the fish shop aroused the witnesses\' appetite. Consequently, the\r\nceremony being over, there was a general reaching for hats and caps.\r\nAs the party were passing through the general office, Ivan Antonovitch\r\nwhispered in Chichikov\'s ear, with a courteous inclination of his\r\njug-shaped physiognomy:\r\n\r\n"You have given a hundred thousand roubles for the serfs, but have paid\r\nME only a trifle for my trouble."\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Chichikov with a similar whisper, "but what sort of serfs\r\ndo you suppose them to be? They are a poor, useless lot, and not worth\r\neven half the purchase money."\r\n\r\nThis gave Ivan Antonovitch to understand that the visitor was a man of\r\nstrong character--a man from whom nothing more was to be expected.\r\n\r\n"Why have you gone and purchased souls from Plushkin?" whispered\r\nSobakevitch in Chichikov\'s other ear.\r\n\r\n"Why did YOU go and add the woman Vorobei to your list?" retorted\r\nChichikov.\r\n\r\n"Vorobei? Who is Vorobei?"\r\n\r\n"The woman \'Elizabet\' Vorobei--\'Elizabet,\' not \'Elizabeta?\'"\r\n\r\n"I added no such name," replied Sobakevitch, and straightway joined the\r\nother guests.\r\n\r\nAt length the party arrived at the residence of the Chief of Police. The\r\nlatter proved indeed a man of spells, for no sooner had he learnt what\r\nwas afoot than he summoned a brisk young constable, whispered in his\r\near, adding laconically, "You understand, do you not?" and brought it\r\nabout that, during the time that the guests were cutting for partners at\r\nwhist in an adjoining room, the dining-table became laden with sturgeon,\r\ncaviare, salmon, herrings, cheese, smoked tongue, fresh roe, and a\r\npotted variety of the same--all procured from the local fish market, and\r\nreinforced with additions from the host\'s own kitchen. The fact was that\r\nthe worthy Chief of Police filled the office of a sort of father and\r\ngeneral benefactor to the town, and that he moved among the citizens as\r\nthough they constituted part and parcel of his own family, and watched\r\nover their shops and markets as though those establishments were\r\nmerely his own private larder. Indeed, it would be difficult to say--so\r\nthoroughly did he perform his duties in this respect--whether the post\r\nmost fitted him, or he the post. Matters were also so arranged that\r\nthough his income more than doubled that of his predecessors, he had\r\nnever lost the affection of his fellow townsmen. In particular did the\r\ntradesmen love him, since he was never above standing godfather to their\r\nchildren or dining at their tables. True, he had differences of opinion\r\nwith them, and serious differences at that; but always these were\r\nskilfully adjusted by his slapping the offended ones jovially on the\r\nshoulder, drinking a glass of tea with them, promising to call at their\r\nhouses and play a game of chess, asking after their belongings, and,\r\nshould he learn that a child of theirs was ill, prescribing the proper\r\nmedicine. In short, he bore the reputation of being a very good fellow.\r\n\r\nOn perceiving the feast to be ready, the host proposed that his guests\r\nshould finish their whist after luncheon; whereupon all proceeded to the\r\nroom whence for some time past an agreeable odour had been tickling the\r\nnostrils of those present, and towards the door of which Sobakevitch in\r\nparticular had been glancing since the moment when he had caught sight\r\nof a huge sturgeon reposing on the sideboard. After a glassful of warm,\r\nolive-coloured vodka apiece--vodka of the tint to be seen only in the\r\nspecies of Siberian stone whereof seals are cut--the company applied\r\nthemselves to knife-and-fork work, and, in so doing, evinced their\r\nseveral characteristics and tastes. For instance, Sobakevitch,\r\ndisdaining lesser trifles, tackled the large sturgeon, and, during the\r\ntime that his fellow guests were eating minor comestibles, and drinking\r\nand talking, contrived to consume more than a quarter of the whole fish;\r\nso that, on the host remembering the creature, and, with fork in hand,\r\nleading the way in its direction and saying, "What, gentlemen, think you\r\nof this striking product of nature?" there ensued the discovery that of\r\nthe said product of nature there remained little beyond the tail, while\r\nSobakevitch, with an air as though at least HE had not eaten it, was\r\nengaged in plunging his fork into a much more diminutive piece of fish\r\nwhich happened to be resting on an adjacent platter. After his divorce\r\nfrom the sturgeon, Sobakevitch ate and drank no more, but sat frowning\r\nand blinking in an armchair.\r\n\r\nApparently the host was not a man who believed in sparing the wine, for\r\nthe toasts drunk were innumerable. The first toast (as the reader may\r\nguess) was quaffed to the health of the new landowner of Kherson; the\r\nsecond to the prosperity of his peasants and their safe transferment;\r\nand the third to the beauty of his future wife--a compliment which\r\nbrought to our hero\'s lips a flickering smile. Lastly, he received from\r\nthe company a pressing, as well as an unanimous, invitation to extend\r\nhis stay in town for at least another fortnight, and, in the meanwhile,\r\nto allow a wife to be found for him.\r\n\r\n"Quite so," agreed the President. "Fight us tooth and nail though you\r\nmay, we intend to have you married. You have happened upon us by chance,\r\nand you shall have no reason to repent of it. We are in earnest on this\r\nsubject."\r\n\r\n"But why should I fight you tooth and nail?" said Chichikov, smiling.\r\n"Marriage would not come amiss to me, were I but provided with a\r\nbetrothed."\r\n\r\n"Then a betrothed you shall have. Why not? We will do as you wish."\r\n\r\n"Very well," assented Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Bravo, bravo!" the company shouted. "Long live Paul Ivanovitch! Hurrah!\r\nHurrah!" And with that every one approached to clink glasses with him,\r\nand he readily accepted the compliment, and accepted it many times in\r\nsuccession. Indeed, as the hours passed on, the hilarity of the company\r\nincreased yet further, and more than once the President (a man of great\r\nurbanity when thoroughly in his cups) embraced the chief guest of the\r\nday with the heartfelt words, "My dearest fellow! My own most precious\r\nof friends!" Nay, he even started to crack his fingers, to dance around\r\nChichikov\'s chair, and to sing snatches of a popular song. To the\r\nchampagne succeeded Hungarian wine, which had the effect of still\r\nfurther heartening and enlivening the company. By this time every\r\none had forgotten about whist, and given himself up to shouting and\r\ndisputing. Every conceivable subject was discussed, including politics\r\nand military affairs; and in this connection guests voiced jejune\r\nopinions for the expression of which they would, at any other time, have\r\nsoundly spanked their offspring. Chichikov, like the rest, had never\r\nbefore felt so gay, and, imagining himself really and truly to be a\r\nlandowner of Kherson, spoke of various improvements in agriculture, of\r\nthe three-field system of tillage [33], and of the beatific felicity of\r\na union between two kindred souls. Also, he started to recite poetry to\r\nSobakevitch, who blinked as he listened, for he greatly desired to go to\r\nsleep. At length the guest of the evening realised that matters had gone\r\nfar enough, so begged to be given a lift home, and was accommodated with\r\nthe Public Prosecutor\'s drozhki. Luckily the driver of the vehicle was\r\na practised man at his work, for, while driving with one hand, he\r\nsucceeded in leaning backwards and, with the other, holding Chichikov\r\nsecurely in his place. Arrived at the inn, our hero continued babbling\r\nawhile about a flaxen-haired damsel with rosy lips and a dimple in her\r\nright cheek, about villages of his in Kherson, and about the amount of\r\nhis capital. Nay, he even issued seignorial instructions that Selifan\r\nshould go and muster the peasants about to be transferred, and make a\r\ncomplete and detailed inventory of them. For a while Selifan listened\r\nin silence; then he left the room, and instructed Petrushka to help the\r\nbarin to undress. As it happened, Chichikov\'s boots had no sooner\r\nbeen removed than he managed to perform the rest of his toilet without\r\nassistance, to roll on to the bed (which creaked terribly as he did so),\r\nand to sink into a sleep in every way worthy of a landowner of Kherson.\r\nMeanwhile Petrushka had taken his master\'s coat and trousers of\r\nbilberry-coloured check into the corridor; where, spreading them over a\r\nclothes\' horse, he started to flick and to brush them, and to fill the\r\nwhole corridor with dust. Just as he was about to replace them in his\r\nmaster\'s room he happened to glance over the railing of the gallery, and\r\nsaw Selifan returning from the stable. Glances were exchanged, and in\r\nan instant the pair had arrived at an instinctive understanding--an\r\nunderstanding to the effect that the barin was sound asleep, and that\r\ntherefore one might consider one\'s own pleasure a little. Accordingly\r\nPetrushka proceeded to restore the coat and trousers to their appointed\r\nplaces, and then descended the stairs; whereafter he and Selifan left\r\nthe house together. Not a word passed between them as to the object\r\nof their expedition. On the contrary, they talked solely of extraneous\r\nsubjects. Yet their walk did not take them far; it took them only to\r\nthe other side of the street, and thence into an establishment which\r\nimmediately confronted the inn. Entering a mean, dirty courtyard covered\r\nwith glass, they passed thence into a cellar where a number of customers\r\nwere seated around small wooden tables. What thereafter was done by\r\nSelifan and Petrushka God alone knows. At all events, within an hour\'s\r\ntime they issued, arm in arm, and in profound silence, yet remaining\r\nmarkedly assiduous to one another, and ever ready to help one another\r\naround an awkward corner. Still linked together--never once releasing\r\ntheir mutual hold--they spent the next quarter of an hour in attempting\r\nto negotiate the stairs of the inn; but at length even that ascent had\r\nbeen mastered, and they proceeded further on their way. Halting\r\nbefore his mean little pallet, Petrushka stood awhile in thought. His\r\ndifficulty was how best to assume a recumbent position. Eventually he\r\nlay down on his face, with his legs trailing over the floor; after which\r\nSelifan also stretched himself upon the pallet, with his head resting\r\nupon Petrushka\'s stomach, and his mind wholly oblivious of the fact that\r\nhe ought not to have been sleeping there at all, but in the servant\'s\r\nquarters, or in the stable beside his horses. Scarcely a moment had\r\npassed before the pair were plunged in slumber and emitting the most\r\nraucous snores; to which their master (next door) responded with snores\r\nof a whistling and nasal order. Indeed, before long every one in the\r\ninn had followed their soothing example, and the hostelry lay plunged\r\nin complete restfulness. Only in the window of the room of the\r\nnewly-arrived lieutenant from Riazan did a light remain burning.\r\nEvidently he was a devotee of boots, for he had purchased four pairs,\r\nand was now trying on a fifth. Several times he approached the bed with\r\na view to taking off the boots and retiring to rest; but each time he\r\nfailed, for the reason that the boots were so alluring in their make\r\nthat he had no choice but to lift up first one foot, and then the other,\r\nfor the purpose of scanning their elegant welts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Chichikov\'s purchases had become the talk of the\r\ntown; and various were the opinions expressed as to whether or not it\r\nwas expedient to procure peasants for transferment. Indeed such was the\r\ninterest taken by certain citizens in the matter that they advised the\r\npurchaser to provide himself and his convoy with an escort, in order\r\nto ensure their safe arrival at the appointed destination; but though\r\nChichikov thanked the donors of this advice for the same, and declared\r\nthat he should be very glad, in case of need, to avail himself of it, he\r\ndeclared also that there was no real need for an escort, seeing that the\r\npeasants whom he had purchased were exceptionally peace-loving folk,\r\nand that, being themselves consenting parties to the transferment, they\r\nwould undoubtedly prove in every way tractable.\r\n\r\nOne particularly good result of this advertisement of his scheme was\r\nthat he came to rank as neither more nor less than a millionaire.\r\nConsequently, much as the inhabitants had liked our hero in the first\r\ninstance (as seen in Chapter I.), they now liked him more than ever.\r\nAs a matter of fact, they were citizens of an exceptionally quiet,\r\ngood-natured, easy-going disposition; and some of them were even\r\nwell-educated. For instance, the President of the Local Council could\r\nrecite the whole of Zhukovski\'s LUDMILLA by heart, and give such an\r\nimpressive rendering of the passage "The pine forest was asleep and the\r\nvalley at rest" (as well as of the exclamation "Phew!") that one felt,\r\nas he did so, that the pine forest and the valley really WERE as he\r\ndescribed them. The effect was also further heightened by the manner in\r\nwhich, at such moments, he assumed the most portentous frown. For his\r\npart, the Postmaster went in more for philosophy, and diligently perused\r\nsuch works as Young\'s Night Thoughts, and Eckharthausen\'s A Key to\r\nthe Mysteries of Nature; of which latter work he would make copious\r\nextracts, though no one had the slightest notion what they referred\r\nto. For the rest, he was a witty, florid little individual, and much\r\naddicted to a practice of what he called "embellishing" whatsoever he\r\nhad to say--a feat which he performed with the aid of such by-the-way\r\nphrases as "my dear sir," "my good So-and-So," "you know," "you\r\nunderstand," "you may imagine," "relatively speaking," "for instance,"\r\nand "et cetera"; of which phrases he would add sackfuls to his\r\nspeech. He could also "embellish" his words by the simple expedient of\r\nhalf-closing, half-winking one eye; which trick communicated to some of\r\nhis satirical utterances quite a mordant effect. Nor were his colleagues\r\na wit inferior to him in enlightenment. For instance, one of them made\r\na regular practice of reading Karamzin, another of conning the Moscow\r\nGazette, and a third of never looking at a book at all. Likewise,\r\nalthough they were the sort of men to whom, in their more intimate\r\nmovements, their wives would very naturally address such nicknames\r\nas "Toby Jug," "Marmot," "Fatty," "Pot Belly," "Smutty," "Kiki," and\r\n"Buzz-Buzz," they were men also of good heart, and very ready to extend\r\ntheir hospitality and their friendship when once a guest had eaten\r\nof their bread and salt, or spent an evening in their company.\r\nParticularly, therefore, did Chichikov earn these good folk\'s approval\r\nwith his taking methods and qualities--so much so that the expression\r\nof that approval bid fair to make it difficult for him to quit the town,\r\nseeing that, wherever he went, the one phrase dinned into his ears was\r\n"Stay another week with us, Paul Ivanovitch." In short, he ceased to\r\nbe a free agent. But incomparably more striking was the impression\r\n(a matter for unbounded surprise!) which he produced upon the ladies.\r\nProperly to explain this phenomenon I should need to say a great deal\r\nabout the ladies themselves, and to describe in the most vivid of\r\ncolours their social intercourse and spiritual qualities. Yet this would\r\nbe a difficult thing for me to do, since, on the one hand, I should be\r\nhampered by my boundless respect for the womenfolk of all Civil\r\nService officials, and, on the other hand--well, simply by the innate\r\narduousness of the task. The ladies of N. were--But no, I cannot do\r\nit; my heart has already failed me. Come, come! The ladies of N. were\r\ndistinguished for--But it is of no use; somehow my pen seems to refuse\r\nto move over the paper--it seems to be weighted as with a plummet\r\nof lead. Very well. That being so, I will merely say a word or\r\ntwo concerning the most prominent tints on the feminine palette of\r\nN.--merely a word or two concerning the outward appearance of\r\nits ladies, and a word or two concerning their more superficial\r\ncharacteristics. The ladies of N. were pre-eminently what is known as\r\n"presentable." Indeed, in that respect they might have served as a\r\nmodel to the ladies of many another town. That is to say, in whatever\r\npertained to "tone," etiquette, the intricacies of decorum, and strict\r\nobservance of the prevailing mode, they surpassed even the ladies of\r\nMoscow and St. Petersburg, seeing that they dressed with taste, drove\r\nabout in carriages in the latest fashions, and never went out without\r\nthe escort of a footman in gold-laced livery. Again, they looked upon\r\na visiting card--even upon a make-shift affair consisting of an ace of\r\ndiamonds or a two of clubs--as a sacred thing; so sacred that on one\r\noccasion two closely related ladies who had also been closely attached\r\nfriends were known to fall out with one another over the mere fact of an\r\nomission to return a social call! Yes, in spite of the best efforts\r\nof husbands and kinsfolk to reconcile the antagonists, it became clear\r\nthat, though all else in the world might conceivably be possible, never\r\ncould the hatchet be buried between ladies who had quarrelled over\r\na neglected visit. Likewise strenuous scenes used to take place over\r\nquestions of precedence--scenes of a kind which had the effect of\r\ninspiring husbands to great and knightly ideas on the subject of\r\nprotecting the fair. True, never did a duel actually take place, since\r\nall the husbands were officials belonging to the Civil Service; but at\r\nleast a given combatant would strive to heap contumely upon his rival,\r\nand, as we all know, that is a resource which may prove even more\r\neffectual than a duel. As regards morality, the ladies of N. were\r\nnothing if not censorious, and would at once be fired with virtuous\r\nindignation when they heard of a case of vice or seduction. Nay, even to\r\nmere frailty they would award the lash without mercy. On the other hand,\r\nshould any instance of what they called "third personism" occur among\r\nTHEIR OWN circle, it was always kept dark--not a hint of what was going\r\non being allowed to transpire, and even the wronged husband holding\r\nhimself ready, should he meet with, or hear of, the "third person," to\r\nquote, in a mild and rational manner, the proverb, "Whom concerns it\r\nthat a friend should consort with friend?" In addition, I may say that,\r\nlike most of the female world of St. Petersburg, the ladies of N. were\r\npre-eminently careful and refined in their choice of words and phrases.\r\nNever did a lady say, "I blew my nose," or "I perspired," or "I spat."\r\nNo, it had to be, "I relieved my nose through the expedient of wiping it\r\nwith my handkerchief," and so forth. Again, to say, "This glass, or\r\nthis plate, smells badly," was forbidden. No, not even a hint to such an\r\neffect was to be dropped. Rather, the proper phrase, in such a case, was\r\n"This glass, or this plate, is not behaving very well,"--or some such\r\nformula.\r\n\r\nIn fact, to refine the Russian tongue the more thoroughly, something\r\nlike half the words in it were cut out: which circumstance necessitated\r\nvery frequent recourse to the tongue of France, since the same words, if\r\nspoken in French, were another matter altogether, and one could use even\r\nblunter ones than the ones originally objected to.\r\n\r\nSo much for the ladies of N., provided that one confines one\'s\r\nobservations to the surface; yet hardly need it be said that, should one\r\npenetrate deeper than that, a great deal more would come to light. At\r\nthe same time, it is never a very safe proceeding to peer deeply into\r\nthe hearts of ladies; wherefore, restricting ourselves to the foregoing\r\nsuperficialities, let us proceed further on our way.\r\n\r\nHitherto the ladies had paid Chichikov no particular attention, though\r\ngiving him full credit for his gentlemanly and urbane demeanour; but\r\nfrom the moment that there arose rumours of his being a millionaire\r\nother qualities of his began to be canvassed. Nevertheless, not ALL the\r\nladies were governed by interested motives, since it is due to the term\r\n"millionaire" rather than to the character of the person who bears it,\r\nthat the mere sound of the word exercises upon rascals, upon decent\r\nfolk, and upon folk who are neither the one nor the other, an undeniable\r\ninfluence. A millionaire suffers from the disadvantage of everywhere\r\nhaving to behold meanness, including the sort of meanness which, though\r\nnot actually based upon calculations of self-interest, yet runs after\r\nthe wealthy man with smiles, and doffs his hat, and begs for invitations\r\nto houses where the millionaire is known to be going to dine. That\r\na similar inclination to meanness seized upon the ladies of N. goes\r\nwithout saying; with the result that many a drawing-room heard it\r\nwhispered that, if Chichikov was not exactly a beauty, at least he was\r\nsufficiently good-looking to serve for a husband, though he could have\r\nborne to have been a little more rotund and stout. To that there would\r\nbe added scornful references to lean husbands, and hints that they\r\nresembled tooth-brushes rather than men--with many other feminine\r\nadditions. Also, such crowds of feminine shoppers began to repair to the\r\nBazaar as almost to constitute a crush, and something like a procession\r\nof carriages ensued, so long grew the rank of vehicles. For their part,\r\nthe tradesmen had the joy of seeing highly priced dress materials which\r\nthey had bought at fairs, and then been unable to dispose of, now\r\nsuddenly become tradeable, and go off with a rush. For instance, on one\r\noccasion a lady appeared at Mass in a bustle which filled the church to\r\nan extent which led the verger on duty to bid the commoner folk withdraw\r\nto the porch, lest the lady\'s toilet should be soiled in the crush.\r\nEven Chichikov could not help privately remarking the attention which he\r\naroused. On one occasion, when he returned to the inn, he found on\r\nhis table a note addressed to himself. Whence it had come, and who had\r\ndelivered it, he failed to discover, for the waiter declared that the\r\nperson who had brought it had omitted to leave the name of the writer.\r\nBeginning abruptly with the words "I MUST write to you," the letter went\r\non to say that between a certain pair of souls there existed a bond of\r\nsympathy; and this verity the epistle further confirmed with rows of\r\nfull stops to the extent of nearly half a page. Next there followed a\r\nfew reflections of a correctitude so remarkable that I have no choice\r\nbut to quote them. "What, I would ask, is this life of ours?" inquired\r\nthe writer. "\'Tis nought but a vale of woe. And what, I would ask, is\r\nthe world? \'Tis nought but a mob of unthinking humanity." Thereafter,\r\nincidentally remarking that she had just dropped a tear to the memory of\r\nher dear mother, who had departed this life twenty-five years ago, the\r\n(presumably) lady writer invited Chichikov to come forth into the wilds,\r\nand to leave for ever the city where, penned in noisome haunts, folk\r\ncould not even draw their breath. In conclusion, the writer gave way to\r\nunconcealed despair, and wound up with the following verses:\r\n\r\n    "Two turtle doves to thee, one day,\r\n    My dust will show, congealed in death;\r\n    And, cooing wearily, they\'ll say:\r\n    \'In grief and loneliness she drew her closing breath.\'"\r\n\r\nTrue, the last line did not scan, but that was a trifle, since the\r\nquatrain at least conformed to the mode then prevalent. Neither\r\nsignature nor date were appended to the document, but only a postscript\r\nexpressing a conjecture that Chichikov\'s own heart would tell him who\r\nthe writer was, and stating, in addition, that the said writer would be\r\npresent at the Governor\'s ball on the following night.\r\n\r\nThis greatly interested Chichikov. Indeed, there was so much that was\r\nalluring and provocative of curiosity in the anonymous missive that he\r\nread it through a second time, and then a third, and finally said to\r\nhimself: "I SHOULD like to know who sent it!" In short, he took the\r\nthing seriously, and spent over an hour in considering the same. At\r\nlength, muttering a comment upon the epistle\'s efflorescent style, he\r\nrefolded the document, and committed it to his dispatch-box in company\r\nwith a play-bill and an invitation to a wedding--the latter of which had\r\nfor the last seven years reposed in the self-same receptacle and in\r\nthe self-same position. Shortly afterwards there arrived a card of\r\ninvitation to the Governor\'s ball already referred to. In passing, it\r\nmay be said that such festivities are not infrequent phenomena in county\r\ntowns, for the reason that where Governors exist there must take place\r\nballs if from the local gentry there is to be evoked that respectful\r\naffection which is every Governor\'s due.\r\n\r\nThenceforth all extraneous thoughts and considerations were laid aside\r\nin favour of preparing for the coming function. Indeed, this conjunction\r\nof exciting and provocative motives led to Chichikov devoting to his\r\ntoilet an amount of time never witnessed since the creation of the\r\nworld. Merely in the contemplation of his features in the mirror, as he\r\ntried to communicate to them a succession of varying expressions, was an\r\nhour spent. First of all he strove to make his features assume an air\r\nof dignity and importance, and then an air of humble, but faintly\r\nsatirical, respect, and then an air of respect guiltless of any alloy\r\nwhatsoever. Next, he practised performing a series of bows to his\r\nreflection, accompanied with certain murmurs intended to bear a\r\nresemblance to a French phrase (though Chichikov knew not a single word\r\nof the Gallic tongue). Lastly came the performing of a series of what I\r\nmight call "agreeable surprises," in the shape of twitchings of the brow\r\nand lips and certain motions of the tongue. In short, he did all that a\r\nman is apt to do when he is not only alone, but also certain that he is\r\nhandsome and that no one is regarding him through a chink. Finally he\r\ntapped himself lightly on the chin, and said, "Ah, good old face!" In\r\nthe same way, when he started to dress himself for the ceremony, the\r\nlevel of his high spirits remained unimpaired throughout the process.\r\nThat is to say, while adjusting his braces and tying his tie, he\r\nshuffled his feet in what was not exactly a dance, but might be called\r\nthe entr\'acte of a dance: which performance had the not very serious\r\nresult of setting a wardrobe a-rattle, and causing a brush to slide from\r\nthe table to the floor.\r\n\r\nLater, his entry into the ballroom produced an extraordinary effect.\r\nEvery one present came forward to meet him, some with cards in their\r\nhands, and one man even breaking off a conversation at the most\r\ninteresting point--namely, the point that "the Inferior Land Court must\r\nbe made responsible for everything." Yes, in spite of the responsibility\r\nof the Inferior Land Court, the speaker cast all thoughts of it to\r\nthe winds as he hurried to greet our hero. From every side resounded\r\nacclamations of welcome, and Chichikov felt himself engulfed in a sea of\r\nembraces. Thus, scarcely had he extricated himself from the arms of\r\nthe President of the Local Council when he found himself just as firmly\r\nclasped in the arms of the Chief of Police, who, in turn, surrendered\r\nhim to the Inspector of the Medical Department, who, in turn, handed\r\nhim over to the Commissioner of Taxes, who, again, committed him to the\r\ncharge of the Town Architect. Even the Governor, who hitherto had been\r\nstanding among his womenfolk with a box of sweets in one hand and\r\na lap-dog in the other, now threw down both sweets and lap-dog (the\r\nlap-dog giving vent to a yelp as he did so) and added his greeting to\r\nthose of the rest of the company. Indeed, not a face was there to be\r\nseen on which ecstatic delight--or, at all events, the reflection of\r\nother people\'s ecstatic delight--was not painted. The same expression\r\nmay be discerned on the faces of subordinate officials when, the newly\r\narrived Director having made his inspection, the said officials are\r\nbeginning to get over their first sense of awe on perceiving that he\r\nhas found much to commend, and that he can even go so far as to jest\r\nand utter a few words of smiling approval. Thereupon every tchinovnik\r\nresponds with a smile of double strength, and those who (it may be) have\r\nnot heard a single word of the Director\'s speech smile out of sympathy\r\nwith the rest, and even the gendarme who is posted at the distant\r\ndoor--a man, perhaps, who has never before compassed a smile, but is\r\nmore accustomed to dealing out blows to the populace--summons up a kind\r\nof grin, even though the grin resembles the grimace of a man who is\r\nabout to sneeze after inadvertently taking an over-large pinch of\r\nsnuff. To all and sundry Chichikov responded with a bow, and felt\r\nextraordinarily at his ease as he did so. To right and left did he\r\nincline his head in the sidelong, yet unconstrained, manner that was\r\nhis wont and never failed to charm the beholder. As for the ladies,\r\nthey clustered around him in a shining bevy that was redolent of every\r\nspecies of perfume--of roses, of spring violets, and of mignonette; so\r\nmuch so that instinctively Chichikov raised his nose to snuff the air.\r\nLikewise the ladies\' dresses displayed an endless profusion of taste and\r\nvariety; and though the majority of their wearers evinced a tendency to\r\nembonpoint, those wearers knew how to call upon art for the concealment\r\nof the fact. Confronting them, Chichikov thought to himself: "Which of\r\nthese beauties is the writer of the letter?" Then again he snuffed the\r\nair. When the ladies had, to a certain extent, returned to their seats,\r\nhe resumed his attempts to discern (from glances and expressions) which\r\nof them could possibly be the unknown authoress. Yet, though those\r\nglances and expressions were too subtle, too insufficiently open, the\r\ndifficulty in no way diminished his high spirits. Easily and gracefully\r\ndid he exchange agreeable bandinage with one lady, and then approach\r\nanother one with the short, mincing steps usually affected by young-old\r\ndandies who are fluttering around the fair. As he turned, not without\r\ndexterity, to right and left, he kept one leg slightly dragging\r\nbehind the other, like a short tail or comma. This trick the ladies\r\nparticularly admired. In short, they not only discovered in him a host\r\nof recommendations and attractions, but also began to see in his face\r\na sort of grand, Mars-like, military expression--a thing which, as we\r\nknow, never fails to please the feminine eye. Certain of the ladies even\r\ntook to bickering over him, and, on perceiving that he spent most of\r\nhis time standing near the door, some of their number hastened to occupy\r\nchairs nearer to his post of vantage. In fact, when a certain dame\r\nchanced to have the good fortune to anticipate a hated rival in the\r\nrace there very nearly ensued a most lamentable scene--which, to many\r\nof those who had been desirous of doing exactly the same thing, seemed a\r\npeculiarly horrible instance of brazen-faced audacity.\r\n\r\nSo deeply did Chichikov become plunged in conversation with his fair\r\npursuers--or rather, so deeply did those fair pursuers enmesh him in the\r\ntoils of small talk (which they accomplished through the expedient of\r\nasking him endless subtle riddles which brought the sweat to his brow in\r\nhis attempts to guess them)--that he forgot the claims of courtesy which\r\nrequired him first of all to greet his hostess. In fact, he remembered\r\nthose claims only on hearing the Governor\'s wife herself addressing him.\r\nShe had been standing before him for several minutes, and now greeted\r\nhim with suave expressement and the words, "So HERE you are, Paul\r\nIvanovitch!" But what she said next I am not in a position to report,\r\nfor she spoke in the ultra-refined tone and vein wherein ladies and\r\ngentlemen customarily express themselves in high-class novels which have\r\nbeen written by experts more qualified than I am to describe salons, and\r\nable to boast of some acquaintance with good society. In effect, what\r\nthe Governor\'s wife said was that she hoped--she greatly hoped--that\r\nMonsieur Chichikov\'s heart still contained a corner--even the smallest\r\npossible corner--for those whom he had so cruelly forgotten. Upon that\r\nChichikov turned to her, and was on the point of returning a reply at\r\nleast no worse than that which would have been returned, under similar\r\ncircumstances, by the hero of a fashionable novelette, when he stopped\r\nshort, as though thunderstruck.\r\n\r\nBefore him there was standing not only Madame, but also a young girl\r\nwhom she was holding by the hand. The golden hair, the fine-drawn,\r\ndelicate contours, the face with its bewitching oval--a face which might\r\nhave served as a model for the countenance of the Madonna, since it was\r\nof a type rarely to be met with in Russia, where nearly everything, from\r\nplains to human feet, is, rather, on the gigantic scale; these features,\r\nI say, were those of the identical maiden whom Chichikov had encountered\r\non the road when he had been fleeing from Nozdrev\'s. His emotion was\r\nsuch that he could not formulate a single intelligible syllable; he\r\ncould merely murmur the devil only knows what, though certainly\r\nnothing of the kind which would have risen to the lips of the hero of a\r\nfashionable novel.\r\n\r\n"I think that you have not met my daughter before?" said Madame. "She is\r\njust fresh from school."\r\n\r\nHe replied that he HAD had the happiness of meeting Mademoiselle before,\r\nand under rather unexpected circumstances; but on his trying to say\r\nsomething further his tongue completely failed him. The Governor\'s wife\r\nadded a word or two, and then carried off her daughter to speak to some\r\nof the other guests.\r\n\r\nChichikov stood rooted to the spot, like a man who, after issuing\r\ninto the street for a pleasant walk, has suddenly come to a halt on\r\nremembering that something has been left behind him. In a moment, as\r\nhe struggles to recall what that something is, the mien of careless\r\nexpectancy disappears from his face, and he no longer sees a single\r\nperson or a single object in his vicinity. In the same way did Chichikov\r\nsuddenly become oblivious to the scene around him. Yet all the while the\r\nmelodious tongues of ladies were plying him with multitudinous hints\r\nand questions--hints and questions inspired with a desire to captivate.\r\n"Might we poor cumberers of the ground make so bold as to ask you what\r\nyou are thinking of?" "Pray tell us where lie the happy regions in which\r\nyour thoughts are wandering?" "Might we be informed of the name of her\r\nwho has plunged you into this sweet abandonment of meditation?"--such\r\nwere the phrases thrown at him. But to everything he turned a dead ear,\r\nand the phrases in question might as well have been stones dropped into\r\na pool. Indeed, his rudeness soon reached the pitch of his walking\r\naway altogether, in order that he might go and reconnoitre wither the\r\nGovernor\'s wife and daughter had retreated. But the ladies were not\r\ngoing to let him off so easily. Every one of them had made up her mind\r\nto use upon him her every weapon, and to exhibit whatsoever might chance\r\nto constitute her best point. Yet the ladies\' wiles proved useless, for\r\nChichikov paid not the smallest attention to them, even when the dancing\r\nhad begun, but kept raising himself on tiptoe to peer over people\'s\r\nheads and ascertain in which direction the bewitching maiden with the\r\ngolden hair had gone. Also, when seated, he continued to peep between\r\nhis neighbours\' backs and shoulders, until at last he discovered her\r\nsitting beside her mother, who was wearing a sort of Oriental turban and\r\nfeather. Upon that one would have thought that his purpose was to carry\r\nthe position by storm; for, whether moved by the influence of spring,\r\nor whether moved by a push from behind, he pressed forward with such\r\ndesperate resolution that his elbow caused the Commissioner of Taxes\r\nto stagger on his feet, and would have caused him to lose his balance\r\naltogether but for the supporting row of guests in the rear. Likewise\r\nthe Postmaster was made to give ground; whereupon he turned and eyed\r\nChichikov with mingled astonishment and subtle irony. But Chichikov\r\nnever even noticed him; he saw in the distance only the golden-haired\r\nbeauty. At that moment she was drawing on a long glove and, doubtless,\r\npining to be flying over the dancing-floor, where, with clicking heels,\r\nfour couples had now begun to thread the mazes of the mazurka. In\r\nparticular was a military staff-captain working body and soul and\r\narms and legs to compass such a series of steps as were never before\r\nperformed, even in a dream. However, Chichikov slipped past the mazurka\r\ndancers, and, almost treading on their heels, made his way towards the\r\nspot where Madame and her daughter were seated. Yet he approached them\r\nwith great diffidence and none of his late mincing and prancing. Nay,\r\nhe even faltered as he walked; his every movement had about it an air of\r\nawkwardness.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say whether or not the feeling which had awakened\r\nin our hero\'s breast was the feeling of love; for it is problematical\r\nwhether or not men who are neither stout nor thin are capable of any\r\nsuch sentiment. Nevertheless, something strange, something which he\r\ncould not altogether explain, had come upon him. It seemed as though\r\nthe ball, with its talk and its clatter, had suddenly become a thing\r\nremote--that the orchestra had withdrawn behind a hill, and the scene\r\ngrown misty, like the carelessly painted-in background of a picture. And\r\nfrom that misty void there could be seen glimmering only the delicate\r\noutlines of the bewitching maiden. Somehow her exquisite shape reminded\r\nhim of an ivory toy, in such fair, white, transparent relief did it\r\nstand out against the dull blur of the surrounding throng.\r\n\r\nHerein we see a phenomenon not infrequently observed--the phenomenon of\r\nthe Chichikovs of this world becoming temporarily poets. At all events,\r\nfor a moment or two our Chichikov felt that he was a young man again, if\r\nnot exactly a military officer. On perceiving an empty chair beside the\r\nmother and daughter, he hastened to occupy it, and though conversation\r\nat first hung fire, things gradually improved, and he acquired more\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nAt this point I must reluctantly deviate to say that men of weight and\r\nhigh office are always a trifle ponderous when conversing with ladies.\r\nYoung lieutenants--or, at all events, officers not above the rank of\r\ncaptain--are far more successful at the game. How they contrive to be so\r\nGod only knows. Let them but make the most inane of remarks, and at once\r\nthe maiden by their side will be rocking with laughter; whereas, should\r\na State Councillor enter into conversation with a damsel, and remark\r\nthat the Russian Empire is one of vast extent, or utter a compliment\r\nwhich he has elaborated not without a certain measure of intelligence\r\n(however strongly the said compliment may smack of a book), of a surety\r\nthe thing will fall flat. Even a witticism from him will be laughed at\r\nfar more by him himself than it will by the lady who may happen to be\r\nlistening to his remarks.\r\n\r\nThese comments I have interposed for the purpose of explaining to the\r\nreader why, as our hero conversed, the maiden began to yawn. Blind to\r\nthis, however, he continued to relate to her sundry adventures which had\r\nbefallen him in different parts of the world. Meanwhile (as need hardly\r\nbe said) the rest of the ladies had taken umbrage at his behaviour. One\r\nof them purposely stalked past him to intimate to him the fact, as well\r\nas to jostle the Governor\'s daughter, and let the flying end of a scarf\r\nflick her face; while from a lady seated behind the pair came both a\r\nwhiff of violets and a very venomous and sarcastic remark. Nevertheless,\r\neither he did not hear the remark or he PRETENDED not to hear it. This\r\nwas unwise of him, since it never does to disregard ladies\' opinions.\r\nLater--but too late--he was destined to learn this to his cost.\r\n\r\nIn short, dissatisfaction began to display itself on every feminine\r\nface. No matter how high Chichikov might stand in society, and no matter\r\nhow much he might be a millionaire and include in his expression of\r\ncountenance an indefinable element of grandness and martial ardour,\r\nthere are certain things which no lady will pardon, whosoever be the\r\nperson concerned. We know that at Governor\'s balls it is customary for\r\nthe onlookers to compose verses at the expense of the dancers; and in\r\nthis case the verses were directed to Chichikov\'s address. Briefly, the\r\nprevailing dissatisfaction grew until a tacit edict of proscription had\r\nbeen issued against both him and the poor young maiden.\r\n\r\nBut an even more unpleasant surprise was in store for our hero; for\r\nwhilst the young lady was still yawning as Chichikov recounted to her\r\ncertain of his past adventures and also touched lightly upon the subject\r\nof Greek philosophy, there appeared from an adjoining room the figure of\r\nNozdrev. Whether he had come from the buffet, or whether he had issued\r\nfrom a little green retreat where a game more strenuous than whist had\r\nbeen in progress, or whether he had left the latter resort unaided, or\r\nwhether he had been expelled therefrom, is unknown; but at all events\r\nwhen he entered the ballroom, he was in an elevated condition, and\r\nleading by the arm the Public Prosecutor, whom he seemed to have been\r\ndragging about for a long while past, seeing that the poor man was\r\nglancing from side to side as though seeking a means of putting an end\r\nto this personally conducted tour. Certainly he must have found the\r\nsituation almost unbearable, in view of the fact that, after deriving\r\ninspiration from two glasses of tea not wholly undiluted with rum,\r\nNozdrev was engaged in lying unmercifully. On sighting him in the\r\ndistance, Chichikov at once decided to sacrifice himself. That is to\r\nsay, he decided to vacate his present enviable position and make off\r\nwith all possible speed, since he could see that an encounter with the\r\nnewcomer would do him no good. Unfortunately at that moment the Governor\r\nbuttonholed him with a request that he would come and act as arbiter\r\nbetween him (the Governor) and two ladies--the subject of dispute\r\nbeing the question as to whether or not woman\'s love is lasting.\r\nSimultaneously Nozdrev descried our hero and bore down upon him.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my fine landowner of Kherson!" he cried with a smile which set his\r\nfresh, spring-rose-pink cheeks a-quiver. "Have you been doing much\r\ntrade in departed souls lately?" With that he turned to the Governor. "I\r\nsuppose your Excellency knows that this man traffics in dead peasants?"\r\nhe bawled. "Look here, Chichikov. I tell you in the most friendly\r\nway possible that every one here likes you--yes, including even the\r\nGovernor. Nevertheless, had I my way, I would hang you! Yes, by God I\r\nwould!"\r\n\r\nChichikov\'s discomfiture was complete.\r\n\r\n"And, would you believe it, your Excellency," went on Nozdrev, "but this\r\nfellow actually said to me, \'Sell me your dead souls!\' Why, I laughed\r\ntill I nearly became as dead as the souls. And, behold, no sooner do\r\nI arrive here than I am told that he has bought three million roubles\'\r\nworth of peasants for transferment! For transferment, indeed! And he\r\nwanted to bargain with me for my DEAD ones! Look here, Chichikov. You\r\nare a swine! Yes, by God, you are an utter swine! Is not that so, your\r\nExcellency? Is not that so, friend Prokurator [34]?"\r\n\r\nBut both his Excellency, the Public Prosecutor, and Chichikov were too\r\ntaken aback to reply. The half-tipsy Nozdrev, without noticing them,\r\ncontinued his harangue as before.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my fine sir!" he cried. "THIS time I don\'t mean to let you go. No,\r\nnot until I have learnt what all this purchasing of dead peasants means.\r\nLook here. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Yes, _I_ say that--_I_\r\nwho am one of your best friends." Here he turned to the Governor\r\nagain. "Your Excellency," he continued, "you would never believe what\r\ninseperables this man and I have been. Indeed, if you had stood there\r\nand said to me, \'Nozdrev, tell me on your honour which of the two you\r\nlove best--your father or Chichikov?\' I should have replied, \'Chichikov,\r\nby God!\'" With that he tackled our hero again, "Come, come, my friend!"\r\nhe urged. "Let me imprint upon your cheeks a baiser or two. You will\r\nexcuse me if I kiss him, will you not, your Excellency? No, do not\r\nresist me, Chichikov, but allow me to imprint at least one baiser upon\r\nyour lily-white cheek." And in his efforts to force upon Chichikov what\r\nhe termed his "baisers" he came near to measuring his length upon the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nEvery one now edged away, and turned a deaf ear to his further\r\nbabblings; but his words on the subject of the purchase of dead souls\r\nhad none the less been uttered at the top of his voice, and been\r\naccompanied with such uproarious laughter that the curiosity even of\r\nthose who had happened to be sitting or standing in the remoter corners\r\nof the room had been aroused. So strange and novel seemed the idea that\r\nthe company stood with faces expressive of nothing but a dumb, dull\r\nwonder. Only some of the ladies (as Chichikov did not fail to remark)\r\nexchanged meaning, ill-natured winks and a series of sarcastic smiles:\r\nwhich circumstance still further increased his confusion. That Nozdrev\r\nwas a notorious liar every one, of course, knew, and that he should have\r\ngiven vent to an idiotic outburst of this sort had surprised no one; but\r\na dead soul--well, what was one to make of Nozdrev\'s reference to such a\r\ncommodity?\r\n\r\nNaturally this unseemly contretemps had greatly upset our hero; for,\r\nhowever foolish be a madman\'s words, they may yet prove sufficient to\r\nsow doubt in the minds of saner individuals. He felt much as does a\r\nman who, shod with well-polished boots, has just stepped into a dirty,\r\nstinking puddle. He tried to put away from him the occurrence, and to\r\nexpand, and to enjoy himself once more. Nay, he even took a hand\r\nat whist. But all was of no avail--matters kept going as awry as a\r\nbadly-bent hoop. Twice he blundered in his play, and the President of\r\nthe Council was at a loss to understand how his friend, Paul Ivanovitch,\r\nlately so good and so circumspect a player, could perpetrate such a\r\nmauvais pas as to throw away a particular king of spades which the\r\nPresident has been "trusting" as (to quote his own expression) "he would\r\nhave trusted God." At supper, too, matters felt uncomfortable, even\r\nthough the society at Chichikov\'s table was exceedingly agreeable and\r\nNozdrev had been removed, owing to the fact that the ladies had found\r\nhis conduct too scandalous to be borne, now that the delinquent had\r\ntaken to seating himself on the floor and plucking at the skirts of\r\npassing lady dancers. As I say, therefore, Chichikov found the situation\r\nnot a little awkward, and eventually put an end to it by leaving the\r\nsupper room before the meal was over, and long before the hour when\r\nusually he returned to the inn.\r\n\r\nIn his little room, with its door of communication blocked with a\r\nwardrobe, his frame of mind remained as uncomfortable as the chair in\r\nwhich he was seated. His heart ached with a dull, unpleasant sensation,\r\nwith a sort of oppressive emptiness.\r\n\r\n"The devil take those who first invented balls!" was his reflection.\r\n"Who derives any real pleasure from them? In this province there exist\r\nwant and scarcity everywhere: yet folk go in for balls! How absurd,\r\ntoo, were those overdressed women! One of them must have had a thousand\r\nroubles on her back, and all acquired at the expense of the overtaxed\r\npeasant, or, worse still, at that of the conscience of her neighbour.\r\nYes, we all know why bribes are accepted, and why men become crooked\r\nin soul. It is all done to provide wives--yes, may the pit swallow them\r\nup!--with fal-lals. And for what purpose? That some woman may not have\r\nto reproach her husband with the fact that, say, the Postmaster\'s wife\r\nis wearing a better dress than she is--a dress which has cost a thousand\r\nroubles! \'Balls and gaiety, balls and gaiety\' is the constant cry. Yet\r\nwhat folly balls are! They do not consort with the Russian spirit and\r\ngenius, and the devil only knows why we have them. A grown, middle-aged\r\nman--a man dressed in black, and looking as stiff as a poker--suddenly\r\ntakes the floor and begins shuffling his feet about, while another man,\r\neven though conversing with a companion on important business, will, the\r\nwhile, keep capering to right and left like a billy-goat! Mimicry, sheer\r\nmimicry! The fact that the Frenchman is at forty precisely what he was\r\nat fifteen leads us to imagine that we too, forsooth, ought to be the\r\nsame. No; a ball leaves one feeling that one has done a wrong thing--so\r\nmuch so that one does not care even to think of it. It also leaves one\'s\r\nhead perfectly empty, even as does the exertion of talking to a man of\r\nthe world. A man of that kind chatters away, and touches lightly upon\r\nevery conceivable subject, and talks in smooth, fluent phrases which he\r\nhas culled from books without grazing their substance; whereas go and\r\nhave a chat with a tradesman who knows at least ONE thing thoroughly,\r\nand through the medium of experience, and see whether his conversation\r\nwill not be worth more than the prattle of a thousand chatterboxes. For\r\nwhat good does one get out of balls? Suppose that a competent writer\r\nwere to describe such a scene exactly as it stands? Why, even in a\r\nbook it would seem senseless, even as it certainly is in life. Are,\r\ntherefore, such functions right or wrong? One would answer that the\r\ndevil alone knows, and then spit and close the book."\r\n\r\nSuch were the unfavourable comments which Chichikov passed upon balls\r\nin general. With it all, however, there went a second source of\r\ndissatisfaction. That is to say, his principal grudge was not so much\r\nagainst balls as against the fact that at this particular one he had\r\nbeen exposed, he had been made to disclose the circumstance that he had\r\nbeen playing a strange, an ambiguous part. Of course, when he reviewed\r\nthe contretemps in the light of pure reason, he could not but see that\r\nit mattered nothing, and that a few rude words were of no account now\r\nthat the chief point had been attained; yet man is an odd creature, and\r\nChichikov actually felt pained by the cold-shouldering administered to\r\nhim by persons for whom he had not an atom of respect, and whose vanity\r\nand love of display he had only that moment been censuring. Still more,\r\non viewing the matter clearly, he felt vexed to think that he himself\r\nhad been so largely the cause of the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nYet he was not angry with HIMSELF--of that you may be sure, seeing that\r\nall of us have a slight weakness for sparing our own faults, and\r\nalways do our best to find some fellow-creature upon whom to vent our\r\ndispleasure--whether that fellow-creature be a servant, a subordinate\r\nofficial, or a wife. In the same way Chichikov sought a scapegoat upon\r\nwhose shoulders he could lay the blame for all that had annoyed him. He\r\nfound one in Nozdrev, and you may be sure that the scapegoat in question\r\nreceived a good drubbing from every side, even as an experienced captain\r\nor chief of police will give a knavish starosta or postboy a rating not\r\nonly in the terms become classical, but also in such terms as the said\r\ncaptain or chief of police may invent for himself. In short, Nozdrev\'s\r\nwhole lineage was passed in review; and many of its members in the\r\nascending line fared badly in the process.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at the other end of the town there was in progress an event\r\nwhich was destined to augment still further the unpleasantness of our\r\nhero\'s position. That is to say, through the outlying streets and\r\nalleys of the town there was clattering a vehicle to which it would be\r\ndifficult precisely to assign a name, seeing that, though it was of a\r\nspecies peculiar to itself, it most nearly resembled a large, rickety\r\nwater melon on wheels. Eventually this monstrosity drew up at the gates\r\nof a house where the archpriest of one of the churches resided, and from\r\nits doors there leapt a damsel clad in a jerkin and wearing a scarf over\r\nher head. For a while she thumped the gates so vigorously as to set\r\nall the dogs barking; then the gates stiffly opened, and admitted this\r\nunwieldy phenomenon of the road. Lastly, the barinia herself alighted,\r\nand stood revealed as Madame Korobotchka, widow of a Collegiate\r\nSecretary! The reason of her sudden arrival was that she had felt so\r\nuneasy about the possible outcome of Chichikov\'s whim, that during the\r\nthree nights following his departure she had been unable to sleep a\r\nwink; whereafter, in spite of the fact that her horses were not shod,\r\nshe had set off for the town, in order to learn at first hand how the\r\ndead souls were faring, and whether (which might God forfend!) she\r\nhad not sold them at something like a third of their true value. The\r\nconsequences of her venture the reader will learn from a conversation\r\nbetween two ladies. We will reserve it for the ensuing chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nNext morning, before the usual hour for paying calls, there tripped from\r\nthe portals of an orange-coloured wooden house with an attic storey and\r\na row of blue pillars a lady in an elegant plaid cloak. With her came\r\na footman in a many-caped greatcoat and a polished top hat with a gold\r\nband. Hastily, but gracefully, the lady ascended the steps let down from\r\na koliaska which was standing before the entrance, and as soon as\r\nshe had done so the footman shut her in, put up the steps again, and,\r\ncatching hold of the strap behind the vehicle, shouted to the coachman,\r\n"Right away!" The reason of all this was that the lady was the possessor\r\nof a piece of intelligence that she was burning to communicate to a\r\nfellow-creature. Every moment she kept looking out of the carriage\r\nwindow, and perceiving, with almost speechless vexation, that, as yet,\r\nshe was but half-way on her journey. The fronts of the houses appeared\r\nto her longer than usual, and in particular did the front of the white\r\nstone hospital, with its rows of narrow windows, seem interminable to\r\na degree which at length forced her to ejaculate: "Oh, the cursed\r\nbuilding! Positively there is no end to it!" Also, she twice adjured the\r\ncoachman with the words, "Go quicker, Andrusha! You are a horribly long\r\ntime over the journey this morning." But at length the goal was reached,\r\nand the koliaska stopped before a one-storied wooden mansion, dark grey\r\nin colour, and having white carvings over the windows, a tall wooden\r\nfence and narrow garden in front of the latter, and a few meagre trees\r\nlooming white with an incongruous coating of road dust. In the windows\r\nof the building were also a few flower pots and a parrot that kept\r\nalternately dancing on the floor of its cage and hanging on to the ring\r\nof the same with its beak. Also, in the sunshine before the door two pet\r\ndogs were sleeping. Here there lived the lady\'s bosom friend. As soon as\r\nthe bosom friend in question learnt of the newcomer\'s arrival, she ran\r\ndown into the hall, and the two ladies kissed and embraced one another.\r\nThen they adjourned to the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"How glad I am to see you!" said the bosom friend. "When I heard some\r\none arriving I wondered who could possibly be calling so early. Parasha\r\ndeclared that it must be the Vice-Governor\'s wife, so, as I did not want\r\nto be bored with her, I gave orders that I was to be reported \'not at\r\nhome.\'"\r\n\r\nFor her part, the guest would have liked to have proceeded to business\r\nby communicating her tidings, but a sudden exclamation from the hostess\r\nimparted (temporarily) a new direction to the conversation.\r\n\r\n"What a pretty chintz!" she cried, gazing at the other\'s gown.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it IS pretty," agreed the visitor. "On the other hand, Praskovia\r\nThedorovna thinks that--"\r\n\r\nIn other words, the ladies proceeded to indulge in a conversation on\r\nthe subject of dress; and only after this had lasted for a considerable\r\nwhile did the visitor let fall a remark which led her entertainer to\r\ninquire:\r\n\r\n"And how is the universal charmer?"\r\n\r\n"My God!" replied the other. "There has been SUCH a business! In fact,\r\ndo you know why I am here at all?" And the visitor\'s breathing became\r\nmore hurried, and further words seemed to be hovering between her lips\r\nlike hawks preparing to stoop upon their prey. Only a person of the\r\nunhumanity of a "true friend" would have had the heart to interrupt her;\r\nbut the hostess was just such a friend, and at once interposed with:\r\n\r\n"I wonder how any one can see anything in the man to praise or to\r\nadmire. For my own part, I think--and I would say the same thing\r\nstraight to his face--that he is a perfect rascal."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but do listen to what I have got to tell you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know that some people think him handsome," continued the\r\nhostess, unmoved; "but _I_ say that he is nothing of the kind--that, in\r\nparticular, his nose is perfectly odious."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but let me finish what I was saying." The guest\'s tone was almost\r\npiteous in its appeal.\r\n\r\n"What is it, then?"\r\n\r\n"You cannot imagine my state of mind! You see, this morning I received\r\na visit from Father Cyril\'s wife--the Archpriest\'s wife--you know her,\r\ndon\'t you? Well, whom do you suppose that fine gentleman visitor of ours\r\nhas turned out to be?"\r\n\r\n"The man who has built the Archpriest a poultry-run?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear no! Had that been all, it would have been nothing. No. Listen\r\nto what Father Cyril\'s wife had to tell me. She said that, last night,\r\na lady landowner named Madame Korobotchka arrived at the Archpriest\'s\r\nhouse--arrived all pale and trembling--and told her, oh, such things!\r\nThey sound like a piece out of a book. That is to say, at dead of night,\r\njust when every one had retired to rest, there came the most dreadful\r\nknocking imaginable, and some one screamed out, \'Open the gates, or we\r\nwill break them down!\' Just think! After this, how any one can say that\r\nthe man is charming I cannot imagine."\r\n\r\n"Well, what of Madame Korobotchka? Is she a young woman or good\r\nlooking?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear no! Quite an old woman."\r\n\r\n"Splendid indeed! So he is actually engaged to a person like that? One\r\nmay heartily commend the taste of our ladies for having fallen in love\r\nwith him!"\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, it is not as you suppose. Think, now! Armed with weapons\r\nfrom head to foot, he called upon this old woman, and said: \'Sell me any\r\nsouls of yours which have lately died.\' Of course, Madame Korobotchka\r\nanswered, reasonably enough: \'I cannot sell you those souls, seeing that\r\nthey have departed this world;\' but he replied: \'No, no! They are NOT\r\ndead. \'Tis I who tell you that--I who ought to know the truth of the\r\nmatter. I swear that they are still alive.\' In short, he made such a\r\nscene that the whole village came running to the house, and children\r\nscreamed, and men shouted, and no one could tell what it was all\r\nabout. The affair seemed to me so horrible, so utterly horrible, that I\r\ntrembled beyond belief as I listened to the story. \'My dearest madam,\'\r\nsaid my maid, Mashka, \'pray look at yourself in the mirror, and see how\r\nwhite you are.\' \'But I have no time for that,\' I replied, \'as I must\r\nbe off to tell my friend, Anna Grigorievna, the news.\' Nor did I lose a\r\nmoment in ordering the koliaska. Yet when my coachman, Andrusha, asked\r\nme for directions I could not get a word out--I just stood staring\r\nat him like a fool, until I thought he must think me mad. Oh, Anna\r\nGrigorievna, if you but knew how upset I am!"\r\n\r\n"What a strange affair!" commented the hostess. "What on earth can\r\nthe man have meant by \'dead souls\'? I confess that the words pass my\r\nunderstanding. Curiously enough, this is the second time I have heard\r\nspeak of those souls. True, my husband avers that Nozdrev was lying; yet\r\nin his lies there seems to have been a grain of truth."\r\n\r\n"Well, just think of my state when I heard all this! \'And now,\'\r\napparently said Korobotchka to the Archpriest\'s wife, \'I am altogether\r\nat a loss what to do, for, throwing me fifteen roubles, the man forced\r\nme to sign a worthless paper--yes, me, an inexperienced, defenceless\r\nwidow who knows nothing of business.\' That such things should happen!\r\nTRY and imagine my feelings!"\r\n\r\n"In my opinion, there is in this more than the dead souls which meet the\r\neye."\r\n\r\n"I think so too," agreed the other. As a matter of fact, her friend\'s\r\nremark had struck her with complete surprise, as well as filled her with\r\ncuriosity to know what the word "more" might possibly signify. In fact,\r\nshe felt driven to inquire: "What do YOU suppose to be hidden beneath it\r\nall?"\r\n\r\n"No; tell me what YOU suppose?"\r\n\r\n"What _I_ suppose? I am at a loss to conjecture."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but tell me what is in your mind?"\r\n\r\nUpon this the visitor had to confess herself nonplussed; for, though\r\ncapable of growing hysterical, she was incapable of propounding any\r\nrational theory. Consequently she felt the more that she needed tender\r\ncomfort and advice.\r\n\r\n"Then THIS is what I think about the dead souls," said the hostess.\r\nInstantly the guest pricked up her ears (or, rather, they pricked\r\nthemselves up) and straightened herself and became, somehow, more\r\nmodish, and, despite her not inconsiderable weight, posed herself to\r\nlook like a piece of thistledown floating on the breeze.\r\n\r\n"The dead souls," began the hostess.\r\n\r\n"Are what, are what?" inquired the guest in great excitement.\r\n\r\n"Are, are--"\r\n\r\n"Tell me, tell me, for heaven\'s sake!"\r\n\r\n"They are an invention to conceal something else. The man\'s real object\r\nis, is--TO ABDUCT THE GOVERNOR\'S DAUGHTER."\r\n\r\nSo startling and unexpected was this conclusion that the guest sat\r\nreduced to a state of pale, petrified, genuine amazement.\r\n\r\n"My God!" she cried, clapping her hands, "I should NEVER have guessed\r\nit!"\r\n\r\n"Well, to tell you the truth, I guessed it as soon as ever you opened\r\nyour mouth."\r\n\r\n"So much, then, for educating girls like the Governor\'s daughter at\r\nschool! Just see what comes of it!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed! And they tell me that she says things which I hesitate\r\neven to repeat."\r\n\r\n"Truly it wrings one\'s heart to see to what lengths immorality has\r\ncome."\r\n\r\n"Some of the men have quite lost their heads about her, but for my part\r\nI think her not worth noticing."\r\n\r\n"Of course. And her manners are unbearable. But what puzzles me most is\r\nhow a travelled man like Chichikov could come to let himself in for such\r\nan affair. Surely he must have accomplices?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and I should say that one of those accomplices is Nozdrev."\r\n\r\n"Surely not?"\r\n\r\n"CERTAINLY I should say so. Why, I have known him even try to sell his\r\nown father! At all events he staked him at cards."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! You interest me. I should never had thought him capable of such\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"I always guessed him to be so."\r\n\r\nThe two ladies were still discussing the matter with acumen and success\r\nwhen there walked into the room the Public Prosecutor--bushy eyebrows,\r\nmotionless features, blinking eyes, and all. At once the ladies hastened\r\nto inform him of the events related, adducing therewith full details\r\nboth as to the purchase of dead souls and as to the scheme to abduct the\r\nGovernor\'s daughter; after which they departed in different directions,\r\nfor the purpose of raising the rest of the town. For the execution of\r\nthis undertaking not more than half an hour was required. So thoroughly\r\ndid they succeed in throwing dust in the public\'s eyes that for a while\r\nevery one--more especially the army of public officials--was placed in\r\nthe position of a schoolboy who, while still asleep, has had a bag of\r\npepper thrown in his face by a party of more early-rising comrades. The\r\nquestions now to be debated resolved themselves into two--namely, the\r\nquestion of the dead souls and the question of the Governor\'s daughter.\r\nTo this end two parties were formed--the men\'s party and the feminine\r\nsection. The men\'s party--the more absolutely senseless of the\r\ntwo--devoted its attention to the dead souls: the women\'s party\r\noccupied itself exclusively with the alleged abduction of the Governor\'s\r\ndaughter. And here it may be said (to the ladies\' credit) that the\r\nwomen\'s party displayed far more method and caution than did its rival\r\nfaction, probably because the function in life of its members had always\r\nbeen that of managing and administering a household. With the ladies,\r\ntherefore, matters soon assumed vivid and definite shape; they became\r\nclearly and irrefutably materialised; they stood stripped of all doubt\r\nand other impedimenta. Said some of the ladies in question, Chichikov\r\nhad long been in love with the maiden, and the pair had kept tryst by\r\nthe light of the moon, while the Governor would have given his consent\r\n(seeing that Chichikov was as rich as a Jew) but for the obstacle that\r\nChichikov had deserted a wife already (how the worthy dames came to\r\nknow that he was married remains a mystery), and the said deserted wife,\r\npining with love for her faithless husband, had sent the Governor a\r\nletter of the most touching kind, so that Chichikov, on perceiving that\r\nthe father and mother would never give their consent, had decided to\r\nabduct the girl. In other circles the matter was stated in a different\r\nway. That is to say, this section averred that Chichikov did NOT possess\r\na wife, but that, as a man of subtlety and experience, he had bethought\r\nhim of obtaining the daughter\'s hand through the expedient of first\r\ntackling the mother and carrying on with her an ardent liaison, and\r\nthat, thereafter, he had made an application for the desired hand, but\r\nthat the mother, fearing to commit a sin against religion, and feeling\r\nin her heart certain gnawings of conscience, had returned a blank\r\nrefusal to Chichikov\'s request; whereupon Chichikov had decided to carry\r\nout the abduction alleged. To the foregoing, of course, there became\r\nappended various additional proofs and items of evidence, in proportion\r\nas the sensation spread to more remote corners of the town. At length,\r\nwith these perfectings, the affair reached the ears of the Governor\'s\r\nwife herself. Naturally, as the mother of a family, and as the first\r\nlady in the town, and as a matron who had never before been suspected of\r\nthings of the kind, she was highly offended when she heard the stories,\r\nand very justly so: with the result that her poor young daughter, though\r\ninnocent, had to endure about as unpleasant a tete-a-tete as ever befell\r\na maiden of sixteen, while, for his part, the Swiss footman received\r\norders never at any time to admit Chichikov to the house.\r\n\r\nHaving done their business with the Governor\'s wife, the ladies\' party\r\ndescended upon the male section, with a view to influencing it to their\r\nown side by asserting that the dead souls were an invention used solely\r\nfor the purpose of diverting suspicion and successfully affecting the\r\nabduction. And, indeed, more than one man was converted, and joined the\r\nfeminine camp, in spite of the fact that thereby such seceders incurred\r\nstrong names from their late comrades--names such as "old women,"\r\n"petticoats," and others of a nature peculiarly offensive to the male\r\nsex.\r\n\r\nAlso, however much they might arm themselves and take the field, the\r\nmen could not compass such orderliness within their ranks as could the\r\nwomen. With the former everything was of the antiquated and rough-hewn\r\nand ill-fitting and unsuitable and badly-adapted and inferior kind;\r\ntheir heads were full of nothing but discord and triviality and\r\nconfusion and slovenliness of thought. In brief, they displayed\r\neverywhere the male bent, the rude, ponderous nature which is incapable\r\neither of managing a household or of jumping to a conclusion, as well\r\nas remains always distrustful and lazy and full of constant doubt and\r\neverlasting timidity. For instance, the men\'s party declared that the\r\nwhole story was rubbish--that the alleged abduction of the Governor\'s\r\ndaughter was the work rather of a military than of a civilian culprit;\r\nthat the ladies were lying when they accused Chichikov of the deed;\r\nthat a woman was like a money-bag--whatsoever you put into her she\r\nthenceforth retained; that the subject which really demanded attention\r\nwas the dead souls, of which the devil only knew the meaning, but in\r\nwhich there certainly lurked something that was contrary to good order\r\nand discipline. One reason why the men\'s party was so certain that the\r\ndead souls connoted something contrary to good order and discipline,\r\nwas that there had just been appointed to the province a new\r\nGovernor-General--an event which, of course, had thrown the whole army\r\nof provincial tchinovniks into a state of great excitement, seeing that\r\nthey knew that before long there would ensue transferments and sentences\r\nof censure, as well as the series of official dinners with which a\r\nGovernor-General is accustomed to entertain his subordinates. "Alas,"\r\nthought the army of tchinovniks, "it is probable that, should he learn\r\nof the gross reports at present afloat in our town, he will make such a\r\nfuss that we shall never hear the last of them." In particular did\r\nthe Director of the Medical Department turn pale at the thought that\r\npossibly the new Governor-General would surmise the term "dead folk"\r\nto connote patients in the local hospitals who, for want of proper\r\npreventative measures, had died of sporadic fever. Indeed, might it not\r\nbe that Chichikov was neither more nor less than an emissary of the said\r\nGovernor-General, sent to conduct a secret inquiry? Accordingly he (the\r\nDirector of the Medical Department) communicated this last supposition\r\nto the President of the Council, who, though at first inclined to\r\nejaculate "Rubbish!" suddenly turned pale on propounding to himself the\r\ntheory. "What if the souls purchased by Chichikov should REALLY be\r\ndead ones?"--a terrible thought considering that he, the President, had\r\npermitted their transferment to be registered, and had himself acted\r\nas Plushkin\'s representative! What if these things should reach the\r\nGovernor-General\'s ears? He mentioned the matter to one friend and\r\nanother, and they, in their turn, went white to the lips, for panic\r\nspreads faster and is even more destructive, than the dreaded black\r\ndeath. Also, to add to the tchinovniks\' troubles, it so befell that\r\njust at this juncture there came into the local Governor\'s hands two\r\ndocuments of great importance. The first of them contained advices that,\r\naccording to received evidence and reports, there was operating in the\r\nprovince a forger of rouble-notes who had been passing under various\r\naliases and must therefore be sought for with the utmost diligence;\r\nwhile the second document was a letter from the Governor of a\r\nneighbouring province with regard to a malefactor who had there evaded\r\napprehension--a letter conveying also a warning that, if in the province\r\nof the town of N. there should appear any suspicious individual who\r\ncould produce neither references nor passports, he was to be arrested\r\nforthwith. These two documents left every one thunderstruck, for they\r\nknocked on the head all previous conceptions and theories. Not for\r\na moment could it be supposed that the former document referred to\r\nChichikov; yet, as each man pondered the position from his own point of\r\nview, he remembered that no one REALLY knew who Chichikov was; as also\r\nthat his vague references to himself had--yes!--included statements that\r\nhis career in the service had suffered much to the cause of Truth, and\r\nthat he possessed a number of enemies who were seeking his life. This\r\ngave the tchinovniks further food for thought. Perhaps his life really\r\nDID stand in danger? Perhaps he really WAS being sought for by some one?\r\nPerhaps he really HAD done something of the kind above referred to? As a\r\nmatter of fact, who was he?--not that it could actually be supposed that\r\nhe was a forger of notes, still less a brigand, seeing that his exterior\r\nwas respectable in the highest degree. Yet who was he? At length\r\nthe tchinovniks decided to make enquiries among those of whom he had\r\npurchased souls, in order that at least it might be learnt what the\r\npurchases had consisted of, and what exactly underlay them, and whether,\r\nin passing, he had explained to any one his real intentions, or revealed\r\nto any one his identity. In the first instance, therefore, resort was\r\nhad to Korobotchka. Yet little was gleaned from that source--merely\r\na statement that he had bought of her some souls for fifteen roubles\r\napiece, and also a quantity of feathers, while promising also to buy\r\nsome other commodities in the future, seeing that, in particular, he had\r\nentered into a contract with the Treasury for lard, a fact constituting\r\nfairly presumptive proof that the man was a rogue, seeing that just such\r\nanother fellow had bought a quantity of feathers, yet had cheated folk\r\nall round, and, in particular, had done the Archpriest out of over a\r\nhundred roubles. Thus the net result of Madame\'s cross-examination was\r\nto convince the tchinovniks that she was a garrulous, silly old woman.\r\nWith regard to Manilov, he replied that he would answer for Chichikov as\r\nhe would for himself, and that he would gladly sacrifice his property in\r\ntoto if thereby he could attain even a tithe of the qualities which\r\nPaul Ivanovitch possessed. Finally, he delivered on Chichikov, with\r\nacutely-knitted brows, a eulogy couched in the most charming of terms,\r\nand coupled with sundry sentiments on the subject of friendship and\r\naffection in general. True, these remarks sufficed to indicate the\r\ntender impulses of the speaker\'s heart, but also they did nothing to\r\nenlighten his examiners concerning the business that was actually at\r\nhand. As for Sobakevitch, that landowner replied that he considered\r\nChichikov an excellent fellow, as well as that the souls whom he had\r\nsold to his visitor had been in the truest sense of the word alive, but\r\nthat he could not answer for anything which might occur in the future,\r\nseeing that any difficulties which might arise in the course of the\r\nactual transferment of souls would not be HIS fault, in view of the fact\r\nthat God was lord of all, and that fevers and other mortal complaints\r\nwere so numerous in the world, and that instances of whole villages\r\nperishing through the same could be found on record.\r\n\r\nFinally, our friends the tchinovniks found themselves compelled to\r\nresort to an expedient which, though not particularly savoury, is not\r\ninfrequently employed--namely, the expedient of getting lacqueys quietly\r\nto approach the servants of the person concerning whom information is\r\ndesired, and to ascertain from them (the servants) certain details with\r\nregard to their master\'s life and antecedents. Yet even from this source\r\nvery little was obtained, since Petrushka provided his interrogators\r\nmerely with a taste of the smell of his living-room, and Selifan\r\nconfined his replies to a statement that the barin had "been in the\r\nemployment of the State, and also had served in the Customs."\r\n\r\nIn short, the sum total of the results gathered by the tchinovniks was\r\nthat they still stood in ignorance of Chichikov\'s identity, but that he\r\nMUST be some one; wherefore it was decided to hold a final debate on the\r\nsubject on what ought to be done, and who Chichikov could possibly be,\r\nand whether or not he was a man who ought to be apprehended and detained\r\nas not respectable, or whether he was a man who might himself be able\r\nto apprehend and detain THEM as persons lacking in respectability. The\r\ndebate in question, it was proposed, should be held at the residence of\r\nthe Chief of Police, who is known to our readers as the father and the\r\ngeneral benefactor of the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nOn assembling at the residence indicated, the tchinovniks had occasion\r\nto remark that, owing to all these cares and excitements, every one\r\nof their number had grown thinner. Yes, the appointment of a new\r\nGovernor-General, coupled with the rumours described and the reception\r\nof the two serious documents above-mentioned, had left manifest traces\r\nupon the features of every one present. More than one frockcoat had come\r\nto look too large for its wearer, and more than one frame had fallen\r\naway, including the frames of the President of the Council, the Director\r\nof the Medical Department, and the Public Prosecutor. Even a certain\r\nSemen Ivanovitch, who, for some reason or another, was never alluded to\r\nby his family name, but who wore on his index finger a ring with which\r\nhe was accustomed to dazzle his lady friends, had diminished in bulk.\r\nYet, as always happens at such junctures, there were also present\r\na score of brazen individuals who had succeeded in NOT losing their\r\npresence of mind, even though they constituted a mere sprinkling.\r\nOf them the Postmaster formed one, since he was a man of equable\r\ntemperament who could always say: "WE know you, Governor-Generals! We\r\nhave seen three or four of you come and go, whereas WE have been sitting\r\non the same stools these thirty years." Nevertheless a prominent feature\r\nof the gathering was the total absence of what is vulgarly known as\r\n"common sense." In general, we Russians do not make a good show at\r\nrepresentative assemblies, for the reason that, unless there be in\r\nauthority a leading spirit to control the rest, the affair always\r\ndevelops into confusion. Why this should be so one could hardly say, but\r\nat all events a success is scored only by such gatherings as have for\r\ntheir object dining and festivity--to wit, gatherings at clubs or in\r\nGerman-run restaurants. However, on the present occasion, the meeting\r\nwas NOT one of this kind; it was a meeting convoked of necessity, and\r\nlikely in view of the threatened calamity to affect every tchinovnik in\r\nthe place. Also, in addition to the great divergency of views expressed\r\nthereat, there was visible in all the speakers an invincible tendency to\r\nindecision which led them at one moment to make assertions, and at the\r\nnext to contradict the same. But on at least one point all seemed to\r\nagree--namely, that Chichikov\'s appearance and conversation were too\r\nrespectable for him to be a forger or a disguised brigand. That is to\r\nsay, all SEEMED to agree on the point; until a sudden shout arose from\r\nthe direction of the Postmaster, who for some time past had been sitting\r\nplunged in thought.\r\n\r\n"_I_ can tell you," he cried, "who Chichikov is!"\r\n\r\n"Who, then?" replied the crowd in great excitement.\r\n\r\n"He is none other than Captain Kopeikin."\r\n\r\n"And who may Captain Kopeikin be?"\r\n\r\nTaking a pinch of snuff (which he did with the lid of his snuff-box\r\nhalf-open, lest some extraneous person should contrive to insert a not\r\nover-clean finger into the stuff), the Postmaster related the following\r\nstory [35].\r\n\r\n"After fighting in the campaign of 1812, there was sent home, wounded,\r\na certain Captain Kopeikin--a headstrong, lively blade who, whether on\r\nduty or under arrest, made things lively for everybody. Now, since at\r\nKrasni or at Leipzig (it matters not which) he had lost an arm and a\r\nleg, and in those days no provision was made for wounded soldiers, and\r\nhe could not work with his left arm alone, he set out to see his father.\r\nUnfortunately his father could only just support himself, and was forced\r\nto tell his son so; wherefore the Captain decided to go and apply for\r\nhelp in St. Petersburg, seeing that he had risked his life for his\r\ncountry, and had lost much blood in its service. You can imagine him\r\narriving in the capital on a baggage waggon--in the capital which is\r\nlike no other city in the world! Before him there lay spread out the\r\nwhole field of life, like a sort of Arabian Nights--a picture made up of\r\nthe Nevski Prospect, Gorokhovaia Street, countless tapering spires, and\r\na number of bridges apparently supported on nothing--in fact, a regular\r\nsecond Nineveh. Well, he made shift to hire a lodging, but found\r\neverything so wonderfully furnished with blinds and Persian carpets and\r\nso forth that he saw it would mean throwing away a lot of money. True,\r\nas one walks the streets of St. Petersburg one seems to smell money by\r\nthe thousand roubles, but our friend Kopeikin\'s bank was limited to a\r\nfew score coppers and a little silver--not enough to buy a village with!\r\nAt length, at the price of a rouble a day, he obtained a lodging in the\r\nsort of tavern where the daily ration is a bowl of cabbage soup and a\r\ncrust of bread; and as he felt that he could not manage to live very\r\nlong on fare of that kind he asked folk what he had better do. \'What you\r\nhad better do?\' they said. \'Well the Government is not here--it is in\r\nParis, and the troops have not yet returned from the war; but there is a\r\nTEMPORARY Commission sitting, and you had better go and see what IT can\r\ndo for you.\' \'All right!\' he said. \'I will go and tell the Commission\r\nthat I have shed my blood, and sacrificed my life, for my country.\'\r\nAnd he got up early one morning, and shaved himself with his left hand\r\n(since the expense of a barber was not worth while), and set out, wooden\r\nleg and all, to see the President of the Commission. But first he\r\nasked where the President lived, and was told that his house was in\r\nNaberezhnaia Street. And you may be sure that it was no peasant\'s hut,\r\nwith its glazed windows and great mirrors and statues and lacqueys and\r\nbrass door handles! Rather, it was the sort of place which you would\r\nenter only after you had bought a cheap cake of soap and indulged in a\r\ntwo hours\' wash. Also, at the entrance there was posted a grand Swiss\r\nfootman with a baton and an embroidered collar--a fellow looking like a\r\nfat, over-fed pug dog. However, friend Kopeikin managed to get himself\r\nand his wooden leg into the reception room, and there squeezed himself\r\naway into a corner, for fear lest he should knock down the gilded china\r\nwith his elbow. And he stood waiting in great satisfaction at having\r\narrived before the President had so much as left his bed and been served\r\nwith his silver wash-basin. Nevertheless, it was only when Kopeikin had\r\nbeen waiting four hours that a breakfast waiter entered to say, \'The\r\nPresident will soon be here.\' By now the room was as full of people as\r\na plate is of beans, and when the President left the breakfast-room he\r\nbrought with him, oh, such dignity and refinement, and such an air\r\nof the metropolis! First he walked up to one person, and then up to\r\nanother, saying: \'What do YOU want? And what do YOU want? What can I\r\ndo for YOU? What is YOUR business?\' And at length he stopped before\r\nKopeikin, and Kopeikin said to him: \'I have shed my blood, and lost\r\nboth an arm and a leg, for my country, and am unable to work. Might I\r\ntherefore dare to ask you for a little help, if the regulations should\r\npermit of it, or for a gratuity, or for a pension, or something of the\r\nkind?\' Then the President looked at him, and saw that one of his legs\r\nwas indeed a wooden one, and that an empty right sleeve was pinned to\r\nhis uniform. \'Very well,\' he said. \'Come to me again in a few days\'\r\ntime.\' Upon this friend Kopeikin felt delighted. \'NOW I have done my\r\njob!\' he thought to himself; and you may imagine how gaily he trotted\r\nalong the pavement, and how he dropped into a tavern for a glass of\r\nvodka, and how he ordered a cutlet and some caper sauce and some other\r\nthings for luncheon, and how he called for a bottle of wine, and how he\r\nwent to the theatre in the evening! In short, he did himself thoroughly\r\nwell. Next, he saw in the street a young English lady, as graceful as a\r\nswan, and set off after her on his wooden leg. \'But no,\' he thought to\r\nhimself. \'To the devil with that sort of thing just now! I will wait\r\nuntil I have drawn my pension. For the present I have spent enough.\'\r\n(And I may tell you that by now he had got through fully half his\r\nmoney.) Two or three days later he went to see the President of the\r\nCommission again. \'I should be glad to know,\' he said, \'whether by now\r\nyou can do anything for me in return for my having shed my blood and\r\nsuffered sickness and wounds on military service.\' \'First of all,\' said\r\nthe President, \'I must tell you that nothing can be decided in your case\r\nwithout the authority of the Supreme Government. Without that sanction\r\nwe cannot move in the matter. Surely you see how things stand until the\r\narmy shall have returned from the war? All that I can advise you to\r\ndo is wait for the Minister to return, and, in the meanwhile, to have\r\npatience. Rest assured that then you will not be overlooked. And if for\r\nthe moment you have nothing to live upon, this is the best that I can\r\ndo for you.\' With that he handed Kopeikin a trifle until his case should\r\nhave been decided. However, that was not what Kopeikin wanted. He\r\nhad supposed that he would be given a gratuity of a thousand roubles\r\nstraight away; whereas, instead of \'Drink and be merry,\' it was \'Wait,\r\nfor the time is not yet.\' Thus, though his head had been full of soup\r\nplates and cutlets and English girls, he now descended the steps with\r\nhis ears and his tail down--looking, in fact, like a poodle over which\r\nthe cook has poured a bucketful of water. You see, St. Petersburg life\r\nhad changed him not a little since first he had got a taste of it, and,\r\nnow that the devil only knew how he was going to live, it came all the\r\nharder to him that he should have no more sweets to look forward to.\r\nRemember that a man in the prime of years has an appetite like a\r\nwolf; and as he passed a restaurant he could see a round-faced,\r\nholland-shirted, snow-white aproned fellow of a French chef preparing a\r\ndish delicious enough to make it turn to and eat itself; while, again,\r\nas he passed a fruit shop he could see delicacies looking out of a\r\nwindow for fools to come and buy them at a hundred roubles apiece.\r\nImagine, therefore, his position! On the one hand, so to speak, were\r\nsalmon and water-melons, while on the other hand was the bitter fare\r\nwhich passed at a tavern for luncheon. \'Well,\' he thought to himself,\r\n\'let them do what they like with me at the Commission, but I intend\r\nto go and raise the whole place, and to tell every blessed functionary\r\nthere that I have a mind to do as I choose.\' And in truth this\r\nbold impertinence of a man did have the hardihood to return to the\r\nCommission. \'What do you want?\' said the President. \'Why are you here\r\nfor the third time? You have had your orders given you.\' \'I daresay I\r\nhave,\' he retorted, \'but I am not going to be put off with THEM. I want\r\nsome cutlets to eat, and a bottle of French wine, and a chance to go and\r\namuse myself at the theatre.\' \'Pardon me,\' said the President. \'What you\r\nreally need (if I may venture to mention it) is a little patience. You\r\nhave been given something for food until the Military Committee shall\r\nhave met, and then, doubtless, you will receive your proper reward,\r\nseeing that it would not be seemly that a man who has served his country\r\nshould be left destitute. On the other hand, if, in the meanwhile, you\r\ndesire to indulge in cutlets and theatre-going, please understand that\r\nwe cannot help you, but you must make your own resources, and try as\r\nbest you can to help yourself.\' You can imagine that this went in at one\r\nof Kopeikin\'s ears, and out at the other; that it was like shooting peas\r\nat a stone wall. Accordingly he raised a turmoil which sent the staff\r\nflying. One by one, he gave the mob of secretaries and clerks a real\r\ngood hammering. \'You, and you, and you,\' he said, \'do not even know\r\nyour duties. You are law-breakers.\' Yes, he trod every man of them under\r\nfoot. At length the General himself arrived from another office, and\r\nsounded the alarm. What was to be done with a fellow like Kopeikin?\r\nThe President saw that strong measures were imperative. \'Very well,\' he\r\nsaid. \'Since you decline to rest satisfied with what has been given you,\r\nand quietly to await the decision of your case in St. Petersburg, I must\r\nfind you a lodging. Here, constable, remove the man to gaol.\' Then a\r\nconstable who had been called to the door--a constable three ells\r\nin height, and armed with a carbine--a man well fitted to guard a\r\nbank--placed our friend in a police waggon. \'Well,\' reflected Kopeikin,\r\n\'at least I shan\'t have to pay my fare for THIS ride. That\'s one\r\ncomfort.\' Again, after he had ridden a little way, he said to himself:\r\n\'they told me at the Commission to go and make my own means of enjoying\r\nmyself. Very good. I\'ll do so.\' However, what became of Kopeikin,\r\nand whither he went, is known to no one. He sank, to use the poet\'s\r\nexpression, into the waters of Lethe, and his doings now lie buried in\r\noblivion. But allow me, gentlemen, to piece together the further threads\r\nof the story. Not two months later there appeared in the forests of\r\nRiazan a band of robbers: and of that band the chieftain was none other\r\nthan--"\r\n\r\n"Allow me," put in the Head of the Police Department. "You have said\r\nthat Kopeikin had lost an arm and a leg; whereas Chichikov--"\r\n\r\nTo say anything more was unnecessary. The Postmaster clapped his hand\r\nto his forehead, and publicly called himself a fool, though, later, he\r\ntried to excuse his mistake by saying that in England the science of\r\nmechanics had reached such a pitch that wooden legs were manufactured\r\nwhich would enable the wearer, on touching a spring, to vanish\r\ninstantaneously from sight.\r\n\r\nVarious other theories were then propounded, among them a theory that\r\nChichikov was Napoleon, escaped from St. Helena and travelling about\r\nthe world in disguise. And if it should be supposed that no such notion\r\ncould possibly have been broached, let the reader remember that these\r\nevents took place not many years after the French had been driven out of\r\nRussia, and that various prophets had since declared that Napoleon was\r\nAntichrist, and would one day escape from his island prison to exercise\r\nuniversal sway on earth. Nay, some good folk had even declared the\r\nletters of Napoleon\'s name to constitute the Apocalyptic cipher!\r\n\r\nAs a last resort, the tchinovniks decided to question Nozdrev, since not\r\nonly had the latter been the first to mention the dead souls, but\r\nalso he was supposed to stand on terms of intimacy with Chichikov.\r\nAccordingly the Chief of Police dispatched a note by the hand of a\r\ncommissionaire. At the time Nozdrev was engaged on some very important\r\nbusiness--so much so that he had not left his room for four days, and\r\nwas receiving his meals through the window, and no visitors at all. The\r\nbusiness referred to consisted of the marking of several dozen selected\r\ncards in such a way as to permit of his relying upon them as upon his\r\nbosom friend. Naturally he did not like having his retirement invaded,\r\nand at first consigned the commissionaire to the devil; but as soon\r\nas he learnt from the note that, since a novice at cards was to be the\r\nguest of the Chief of Police that evening, a call at the latter\'s house\r\nmight prove not wholly unprofitable he relented, unlocked the door of\r\nhis room, threw on the first garments that came to hand, and set forth.\r\nTo every question put to him by the tchinovniks he answered firmly and\r\nwith assurance. Chichikov, he averred, had indeed purchased dead souls,\r\nand to the tune of several thousand roubles. In fact, he (Nozdrev) had\r\nhimself sold him some, and still saw no reason why he should not have\r\ndone so. Next, to the question of whether or not he considered Chichikov\r\nto be a spy, he replied in the affirmative, and added that, as long ago\r\nas his and Chichikov\'s joint schooldays, the said Chichikov had been\r\nknown as "The Informer," and repeatedly been thrashed by his companions\r\non that account. Again, to the question of whether or not Chichikov was\r\na forger of currency notes the deponent, as before, responded in\r\nthe affirmative, and appended thereto an anecdote illustrative of\r\nChichikov\'s extraordinary dexterity of hand--namely, an anecdote to\r\nthat effect that, once upon a time, on learning that two million\r\nroubles worth of counterfeit notes were lying in Chichikov\'s house, the\r\nauthorities had placed seals upon the building, and had surrounded it\r\non every side with an armed guard; whereupon Chichikov had, during the\r\nnight, changed each of these seals for a new one, and also so arranged\r\nmatters that, when the house was searched, the forged notes were found\r\nto be genuine ones!\r\n\r\nAgain, to the question of whether or not Chichikov had schemed to abduct\r\nthe Governor\'s daughter, and also whether it was true that he, Nozdrev,\r\nhad undertaken to aid and abet him in the act, the witness replied that,\r\nhad he not undertaken to do so, the affair would never have come off. At\r\nthis point the witness pulled himself up, on realising that he had told\r\na lie which might get him into trouble; but his tongue was not to be\r\ndenied--the details trembling on its tip were too alluring, and he\r\neven went on to cite the name of the village church where the pair\r\nhad arranged to be married, that of the priest who had performed\r\nthe ceremony, the amount of the fees paid for the same (seventy-five\r\nroubles), and statements (1) that the priest had refused to solemnise\r\nthe wedding until Chichikov had frightened him by threatening to expose\r\nthe fact that he (the priest) had married Mikhail, a local corn dealer,\r\nto his paramour, and (2) that Chichikov had ordered both a koliaska for\r\nthe couple\'s conveyance and relays of horses from the post-houses on the\r\nroad. Nay, the narrative, as detailed by Nozdrev, even reached the\r\npoint of his mentioning certain of the postillions by name! Next, the\r\ntchinovniks sounded him on the question of Chichikov\'s possible identity\r\nwith Napoleon; but before long they had reason to regret the step, for\r\nNozdrev responded with a rambling rigmarole such as bore no resemblance\r\nto anything possibly conceivable. Finally, the majority of the audience\r\nleft the room, and only the Chief of Police remained to listen (in the\r\nhope of gathering something more); but at last even he found himself\r\nforced to disclaim the speaker with a gesture which said: "The devil\r\nonly knows what the fellow is talking about!" and so voiced the general\r\nopinion that it was no use trying to gather figs of thistles.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Chichikov knew nothing of these events; for, having contracted\r\na slight chill, coupled with a sore throat, he had decided to keep his\r\nroom for three days; during which time he gargled his throat with\r\nmilk and fig juice, consumed the fruit from which the juice had been\r\nextracted, and wore around his neck a poultice of camomile and camphor.\r\nAlso, to while away the hours, he made new and more detailed lists of\r\nthe souls which he had bought, perused a work by the Duchesse de la\r\nValliere [36], rummaged in his portmanteau, looked through various\r\narticles and papers which he discovered in his dispatch-box, and found\r\nevery one of these occupations tedious. Nor could he understand why\r\nnone of his official friends had come to see him and inquire after his\r\nhealth, seeing that, not long since, there had been standing in front of\r\nthe inn the drozhkis both of the Postmaster, the Public Prosecutor, and\r\nthe President of the Council. He wondered and wondered, and then, with\r\na shrug of his shoulders, fell to pacing the room. At length he felt\r\nbetter, and his spirits rose at the prospect of once more going out into\r\nthe fresh air; wherefore, having shaved a plentiful growth of hair from\r\nhis face, he dressed with such alacrity as almost to cause a split\r\nin his trousers, sprinkled himself with eau-de-Cologne, and wrapping\r\nhimself in warm clothes, and turning up the collar of his coat, sallied\r\nforth into the street. His first destination was intended to be the\r\nGovernor\'s mansion, and, as he walked along, certain thoughts concerning\r\nthe Governor\'s daughter would keep whirling through his head, so that\r\nalmost he forgot where he was, and took to smiling and cracking jokes to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nArrived at the Governor\'s entrance, he was about to divest himself\r\nof his scarf when a Swiss footman greeted him with the words, "I am\r\nforbidden to admit you."\r\n\r\n"What?" he exclaimed. "You do not know me? Look at me again, and see if\r\nyou do not recognise me."\r\n\r\n"Of course I recognise you," the footman replied. "I have seen you\r\nbefore, but have been ordered to admit any one else rather than Monsieur\r\nChichikov."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! And why so?"\r\n\r\n"Those are my orders, and they must be obeyed," said the footman,\r\nconfronting Chichikov with none of that politeness with which, on\r\nformer occasions, he had hastened to divest our hero of his wrappings.\r\nEvidently he was of opinion that, since the gentry declined to receive\r\nthe visitor, the latter must certainly be a rogue.\r\n\r\n"I cannot understand it," said Chichikov to himself. Then he departed,\r\nand made his way to the house of the President of the Council. But so\r\nput about was that official by Chichikov\'s entry that he could not utter\r\ntwo consecutive words--he could only murmur some rubbish which left both\r\nhis visitor and himself out of countenance. Chichikov wondered, as he\r\nleft the house, what the President\'s muttered words could have meant,\r\nbut failed to make head or tail of them. Next, he visited, in turn, the\r\nChief of Police, the Vice-Governor, the Postmaster, and others; but in\r\neach case he either failed to be accorded admittance or was received\r\nso strangely, and with such a measure of constraint and conversational\r\nawkwardness and absence of mind and embarrassment, that he began to fear\r\nfor the sanity of his hosts. Again and again did he strive to divine\r\nthe cause, but could not do so; so he went wandering aimlessly about\r\nthe town, without succeeding in making up his mind whether he or\r\nthe officials had gone crazy. At length, in a state bordering upon\r\nbewilderment, he returned to the inn--to the establishment whence, that\r\nevery afternoon, he had set forth in such exuberance of spirits. Feeling\r\nthe need of something to do, he ordered tea, and, still marvelling at\r\nthe strangeness of his position, was about to pour out the beverage when\r\nthe door opened and Nozdrev made his appearance.\r\n\r\n"What says the proverb?" he began. "\'To see a friend, seven versts is\r\nnot too long a round to make.\' I happened to be passing the house, saw a\r\nlight in your window, and thought to myself: \'Now, suppose I were to run\r\nup and pay him a visit? It is unlikely that he will be asleep.\' Ah, ha!\r\nI see tea on your table! Good! Then I will drink a cup with you, for I\r\nhad wretched stuff for dinner, and it is beginning to lie heavy on my\r\nstomach. Also, tell your man to fill me a pipe. Where is your own pipe?"\r\n\r\n"I never smoke," rejoined Chichikov drily.\r\n\r\n"Rubbish! As if I did not know what a chimney-pot you are! What is your\r\nman\'s name? Hi, Vakhramei! Come here!"\r\n\r\n"Petrushka is his name, not Vakhramei."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! But you USED to have a man called Vakhramei, didn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"No, never."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well. Then it must be Derebin\'s man I am thinking of. What a lucky\r\nfellow that Derebin is! An aunt of his has gone and quarrelled with her\r\nson for marrying a serf woman, and has left all her property to HIM,\r\nto Derebin. Would that _I_ had an aunt of that kind to provide against\r\nfuture contingencies! But why have you been hiding yourself away? I\r\nsuppose the reason has been that you go in for abstruse subjects and are\r\nfond of reading" (why Nozdrev should have drawn these conclusions no one\r\ncould possibly have said--least of all Chichikov himself). "By the way,\r\nI can tell you of something that would have found you scope for your\r\nsatirical vein" (the conclusion as to Chichikov\'s "satirical vein" was,\r\nas before, altogether unwarranted on Nozdrev\'s part). "That is to say,\r\nyou would have seen merchant Likhachev losing a pile of money at play.\r\nMy word, you would have laughed! A fellow with me named Perependev said:\r\n\'Would that Chichikov had been here! It would have been the very thing\r\nfor him!\'" (As a matter of fact, never since the day of his birth had\r\nNozdrev met any one of the name of Perependev.) "However, my friend, you\r\nmust admit that you treated me rather badly the day that we played that\r\ngame of chess; but, as I won the game, I bear you no malice. A propos,\r\nI am just from the President\'s, and ought to tell you that the feeling\r\nagainst you in the town is very strong, for every one believes you to be\r\na forger of currency notes. I myself was sent for and questioned\r\nabout you, but I stuck up for you through thick and thin, and told\r\nthe tchinovniks that I had been at school with you, and had known your\r\nfather. In fact, I gave the fellows a knock or two for themselves."\r\n\r\n"You say that I am believed to be a forger?" said Chichikov, starting\r\nfrom his seat.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Nozdrev. "Why have you gone and frightened everybody as you\r\nhave done? Some of our folk are almost out of their minds about it, and\r\ndeclare you to be either a brigand in disguise or a spy. Yesterday the\r\nPublic Prosecutor even died of it, and is to be buried to-morrow"\r\n(this was true in so far as that, on the previous day, the official in\r\nquestion had had a fatal stroke--probably induced by the excitement of\r\nthe public meeting). "Of course, _I_ don\'t suppose you to be anything of\r\nthe kind, but, you see, these fellows are in a blue funk about the new\r\nGovernor-General, for they think he will make trouble for them over your\r\naffair. A propos, he is believed to be a man who puts on airs, and turns\r\nup his nose at everything; and if so, he will get on badly with the\r\ndvoriane, seeing that fellows of that sort need to be humoured a bit.\r\nYes, my word! Should the new Governor-General shut himself up in his\r\nstudy, and give no balls, there will be the very devil to pay! By the\r\nway, Chichikov, that is a risky scheme of yours."\r\n\r\n"What scheme to you mean?" Chichikov asked uneasily.\r\n\r\n"Why, that scheme of carrying off the Governor\'s daughter. However, to\r\ntell the truth, I was expecting something of the kind. No sooner did\r\nI see you and her together at the ball than I said to myself: \'Ah, ha!\r\nChichikov is not here for nothing!\' For my own part, I think you have\r\nmade a poor choice, for I can see nothing in her at all. On the other\r\nhand, the niece of a friend of mine named Bikusov--she IS a girl, and no\r\nmistake! A regular what you might call \'miracle in muslin!\'"\r\n\r\n"What on earth are you talking about?" asked Chichikov with his eyes\r\ndistended. "HOW could I carry off the Governor\'s daughter? What on earth\r\ndo you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Come, come! What a secretive fellow you are! My only object in having\r\ncome to see you is to lend you a helping hand in the matter. Look here.\r\nOn condition that you will lend me three thousand roubles, I will stand\r\nyou the cost of the wedding, the koliaska, and the relays of horses. I\r\nmust have the money even if I die for it."\r\n\r\nThroughout Nozdrev\'s maunderings Chichikov had been rubbing his eyes to\r\nascertain whether or not he was dreaming. What with the charge of being\r\na forger, the accusation of having schemed an abduction, the death of\r\nthe Public Prosecutor (whatever might have been its cause), and the\r\nadvent of a new Governor-General, he felt utterly dismayed.\r\n\r\n"Things having come to their present pass," he reflected, "I had better\r\nnot linger here--I had better be off at once."\r\n\r\nGetting rid of Nozdrev as soon as he could, he sent for Selifan, and\r\nordered him to be up at daybreak, in order to clean the britchka and to\r\nhave everything ready for a start at six o\'clock. Yet, though Selifan\r\nreplied, "Very well, Paul Ivanovitch," he hesitated awhile by the door.\r\nNext, Chichikov bid Petrushka get out the dusty portmanteau from under\r\nthe bed, and then set to work to cram into it, pell-mell, socks, shirts,\r\ncollars (both clean and dirty), boot trees, a calendar, and a variety of\r\nother articles. Everything went into the receptacle just as it came\r\nto hand, since his one object was to obviate any possible delay in\r\nthe morning\'s departure. Meanwhile the reluctant Selifan slowly, very\r\nslowly, left the room, as slowly descended the staircase (on each\r\nseparate step of which he left a muddy foot-print), and, finally, halted\r\nto scratch his head. What that scratching may have meant no one could\r\nsay; for, with the Russian populace, such a scratching may mean any one\r\nof a hundred things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nNevertheless events did not turn out as Chichikov had intended they\r\nshould. In the first place, he overslept himself. That was check number\r\none. In the second place, on his rising and inquiring whether the\r\nbritchka had been harnessed and everything got ready, he was informed\r\nthat neither of those two things had been done. That was check number\r\ntwo. Beside himself with rage, he prepared to give Selifan the wigging\r\nof his life, and, meanwhile, waited impatiently to hear what the\r\ndelinquent had got to say in his defence. It goes without saying that\r\nwhen Selifan made his appearance in the doorway he had only the usual\r\nexcuses to offer--the sort of excuses usually offered by servants when a\r\nhasty departure has become imperatively necessary.\r\n\r\n"Paul Ivanovitch," he said, "the horses require shoeing."\r\n\r\n"Blockhead!" exclaimed Chichikov. "Why did you not tell me of that\r\nbefore, you damned fool? Was there not time enough for them to be shod?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose there was," agreed Selifan. "Also one of the wheels is\r\nin want of a new tyre, for the roads are so rough that the old tyre is\r\nworn through. Also, the body of the britchka is so rickety that probably\r\nit will not last more than a couple of stages."\r\n\r\n"Rascal!" shouted Chichikov, clenching his fists and approaching Selifan\r\nin such a manner that, fearing to receive a blow, the man backed and\r\ndodged aside. "Do you mean to ruin me, and to break all our bones on the\r\nroad, you cursed idiot? For these three weeks past you have been doing\r\nnothing at all; yet now, at the last moment, you come here stammering\r\nand playing the fool! Do you think I keep you just to eat and to drive\r\nyourself about? You must have known of this before? Did you, or did you\r\nnot, know it? Answer me at once."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did know it," replied Selifan, hanging his head.\r\n\r\n"Then why didn\'t you tell me about it?"\r\n\r\nSelifan had no reply immediately ready, so continued to hang his head\r\nwhile quietly saying to himself: "See how well I have managed things! I\r\nknew what was the matter, yet I did not say."\r\n\r\n"And now," continued Chichikov, "go you at once and fetch a blacksmith.\r\nTell him that everything must be put right within two hours at the most.\r\nDo you hear? If that should not be done, I, I--I will give you the best\r\nflogging that ever you had in your life." Truly Chichikov was almost\r\nbeside himself with fury.\r\n\r\nTurning towards the door, as though for the purpose of going and\r\ncarrying out his orders, Selifan halted and added:\r\n\r\n"That skewbald, barin--you might think it well to sell him, seeing that\r\nhe is nothing but a rascal? A horse like that is more of a hindrance\r\nthan a help."\r\n\r\n"What? Do you expect me to go NOW to the market-place and sell him?"\r\n\r\n"Well, Paul Ivanovitch, he is good for nothing but show, since by nature\r\nhe is a most cunning beast. Never in my life have I seen such a horse."\r\n\r\n"Fool! Whenever I may wish to sell him I SHALL sell him. Meanwhile,\r\ndon\'t you trouble your head about what doesn\'t concern you, but go and\r\nfetch a blacksmith, and see that everything is put right within two\r\nhours. Otherwise I will take the very hair off your head, and beat you\r\ntill you haven\'t a face left. Be off! Hurry!"\r\n\r\nSelifan departed, and Chichikov, his ill-humour vented, threw down\r\nupon the floor the poignard which he always took with him as a means of\r\ninstilling respect into whomsoever it might concern, and spent the next\r\nquarter of an hour in disputing with a couple of blacksmiths--men who,\r\nas usual, were rascals of the type which, on perceiving that something\r\nis wanted in a hurry, at once multiplies its terms for providing the\r\nsame. Indeed, for all Chichikov\'s storming and raging as he dubbed\r\nthe fellows robbers and extortioners and thieves, he could make no\r\nimpression upon the pair, since, true to their character, they declined\r\nto abate their prices, and, even when they had begun their work, spent\r\nupon it, not two hours, but five and a half. Meanwhile he had the\r\nsatisfaction of experiencing that delightful time with which all\r\ntravellers are familiar--namely, the time during which one sits in a\r\nroom where, except for a litter of string, waste paper, and so forth,\r\neverything else has been packed. But to all things there comes an end,\r\nand there arrived also the long-awaited moment when the britchka had\r\nreceived the luggage, the faulty wheel had been fitted with a new tyre,\r\nthe horses had been re-shod, and the predatory blacksmiths had departed\r\nwith their gains. "Thank God!" thought Chichikov as the britchka rolled\r\nout of the gates of the inn, and the vehicle began to jolt over the\r\ncobblestones. Yet a feeling which he could not altogether have defined\r\nfilled his breast as he gazed upon the houses and the streets and the\r\ngarden walls which he might never see again. Presently, on turning a\r\ncorner, the britchka was brought to a halt through the fact that along\r\nthe street there was filing a seemingly endless funeral procession.\r\nLeaning forward in his britchka, Chichikov asked Petrushka whose\r\nobsequies the procession represented, and was told that they represented\r\nthose of the Public Prosecutor. Disagreeably shocked, our hero hastened\r\nto raise the hood of the vehicle, to draw the curtains across the\r\nwindows, and to lean back into a corner. While the britchka remained\r\nthus halted Selifan and Petrushka, their caps doffed, sat watching the\r\nprogress of the cortege, after they had received strict instructions not\r\nto greet any fellow-servant whom they might recognise. Behind the hearse\r\nwalked the whole body of tchinovniks, bare-headed; and though, for a\r\nmoment or two, Chichikov feared that some of their number might discern\r\nhim in his britchka, he need not have disturbed himself, since their\r\nattention was otherwise engaged. In fact, they were not even exchanging\r\nthe small talk customary among members of such processions, but\r\nthinking exclusively of their own affairs, of the advent of the new\r\nGovernor-General, and of the probable manner in which he would take up\r\nthe reins of administration. Next came a number of carriages, from\r\nthe windows of which peered the ladies in mourning toilets. Yet the\r\nmovements of their hands and lips made it evident that they were\r\nindulging in animated conversation--probably about the Governor-General,\r\nthe balls which he might be expected to give, and their own eternal\r\nfripperies and gewgaws. Lastly came a few empty drozhkis. As soon as the\r\nlatter had passed, our hero was able to continue on his way. Throwing\r\nback the hood of the britchka, he said to himself:\r\n\r\n"Ah, good friend, you have lived your life, and now it is over! In the\r\nnewspapers they will say of you that you died regretted not only by\r\nyour subordinates, but also by humanity at large, as well as that, a\r\nrespected citizen, a kind father, and a husband beyond reproach, you\r\nwent to your grave amid the tears of your widow and orphans. Yet, should\r\nthose journals be put to it to name any particular circumstance which\r\njustified this eulogy of you, they would be forced to fall back upon the\r\nfact that you grew a pair of exceptionally thick eyebrows!"\r\n\r\nWith that Chichikov bid Selifan quicken his pace, and concluded: "After\r\nall, it is as well that I encountered the procession, for they say that\r\nto meet a funeral is lucky."\r\n\r\nPresently the britchka turned into some less frequented streets, lines\r\nof wooden fencing of the kind which mark the outskirts of a town began\r\nto file by, the cobblestones came to an end, the macadam of the highroad\r\nsucceeded to them, and once more there began on either side of the\r\nturnpike a procession of verst stones, road menders, and grey villages;\r\ninns with samovars and peasant women and landlords who came running out\r\nof yards with seivefuls of oats; pedestrians in worn shoes which, it\r\nmight be, had covered eight hundred versts; little towns, bright with\r\nbooths for the sale of flour in barrels, boots, small loaves, and other\r\ntrifles; heaps of slag; much repaired bridges; expanses of field to\r\nright and to left; stout landowners; a mounted soldier bearing a green,\r\niron-clamped box inscribed: "The --th Battery of Artillery"; long strips\r\nof freshly-tilled earth which gleamed green, yellow, and black on the\r\nface of the countryside. With it mingled long-drawn singing, glimpses of\r\nelm-tops amid mist, the far-off notes of bells, endless clouds of rocks,\r\nand the illimitable line of the horizon.\r\n\r\nAh, Russia, Russia, from my beautiful home in a strange land I can still\r\nsee you! In you everything is poor and disordered and unhomely; in you\r\nthe eye is neither cheered nor dismayed by temerities of nature which\r\na yet more temerarious art has conquered; in you one beholds no cities\r\nwith lofty, many-windowed mansions, lofty as crags, no picturesque\r\ntrees, no ivy-clad ruins, no waterfalls with their everlasting spray and\r\nroar, no beetling precipices which confuse the brain with their stony\r\nimmensity, no vistas of vines and ivy and millions of wild roses and\r\nageless lines of blue hills which look almost unreal against the clear,\r\nsilvery background of the sky. In you everything is flat and open; your\r\ntowns project like points or signals from smooth levels of plain, and\r\nnothing whatsoever enchants or deludes the eye. Yet what secret, what\r\ninvincible force draws me to you? Why does there ceaselessly echo and\r\nre-echo in my ears the sad song which hovers throughout the length and\r\nthe breadth of your borders? What is the burden of that song? Why does\r\nit wail and sob and catch at my heart? What say the notes which\r\nthus painfully caress and embrace my soul, and flit, uttering their\r\nlamentations, around me? What is it you seek of me, O Russia? What is\r\nthe hidden bond which subsists between us? Why do you regard me as you\r\ndo? Why does everything within you turn upon me eyes full of\r\nyearning? Even at this moment, as I stand dumbly, fixedly, perplexedly\r\ncontemplating your vastness, a menacing cloud, charged with gathering\r\nrain, seems to overshadow my head. What is it that your boundless\r\nexpanses presage? Do they not presage that one day there will arise in\r\nyou ideas as boundless as yourself? Do they not presage that one day you\r\ntoo will know no limits? Do they not presage that one day, when again\r\nyou shall have room for their exploits, there will spring to life\r\nthe heroes of old? How the power of your immensity enfolds me, and\r\nreverberates through all my being with a wild, strange spell, and\r\nflashes in my eyes with an almost supernatural radiance! Yes, a strange,\r\nbrilliant, unearthly vista indeed do you disclose, O Russia, country of\r\nmine!\r\n\r\n"Stop, stop, you fool!" shouted Chichikov to Selifan; and even as he\r\nspoke a troika, bound on Government business, came chattering by, and\r\ndisappeared in a cloud of dust. To Chichikov\'s curses at Selifan for not\r\nhaving drawn out of the way with more alacrity a rural constable with\r\nmoustaches of the length of an arshin added his quota.\r\n\r\nWhat a curious and attractive, yet also what an unreal, fascination\r\nthe term "highway" connotes! And how interesting for its own sake is\r\na highway! Should the day be a fine one (though chilly) in mellowing\r\nautumn, press closer your travelling cloak, and draw down your cap over\r\nyour ears, and snuggle cosily, comfortably into a corner of the britchka\r\nbefore a last shiver shall course through your limbs, and the ensuing\r\nwarmth shall put to flight the autumnal cold and damp. As the horses\r\ngallop on their way, how delightfully will drowsiness come stealing upon\r\nyou, and make your eyelids droop! For a while, through your somnolence,\r\nyou will continue to hear the hard breathing of the team and the\r\nrumbling of the wheels; but at length, sinking back into your corner,\r\nyou will relapse into the stage of snoring. And when you awake--behold!\r\nyou will find that five stages have slipped away, and that the moon is\r\nshining, and that you have reached a strange town of churches and old\r\nwooden cupolas and blackened spires and white, half-timbered houses! And\r\nas the moonlight glints hither and thither, almost you will believe that\r\nthe walls and the streets and the pavements of the place are spread with\r\nsheets--sheets shot with coal-black shadows which make the wooden roofs\r\nlook all the brighter under the slanting beams of the pale luminary.\r\nNowhere is a soul to be seen, for every one is plunged in slumber. Yet\r\nno. In a solitary window a light is flickering where some good burgher\r\nis mending his boots, or a baker drawing a batch of dough. O night\r\nand powers of heaven, how perfect is the blackness of your infinite\r\nvault--how lofty, how remote its inaccessible depths where it lies\r\nspread in an intangible, yet audible, silence! Freshly does the lulling\r\nbreath of night blow in your face, until once more you relapse into\r\nsnoring oblivion, and your poor neighbour turns angrily in his corner as\r\nhe begins to be conscious of your weight. Then again you awake, but\r\nthis time to find yourself confronted with only fields and steppes.\r\nEverywhere in the ascendant is the desolation of space. But suddenly the\r\nciphers on a verst stone leap to the eye! Morning is rising, and on the\r\nchill, gradually paling line of the horizon you can see gleaming a faint\r\ngold streak. The wind freshens and grows keener, and you snuggle closer\r\nin your cloak; yet how glorious is that freshness, and how marvellous\r\nthe sleep in which once again you become enfolded! A jolt!--and for the\r\nlast time you return to consciousness. By now the sun is high in the\r\nheavens, and you hear a voice cry "gently, gently!" as a farm waggon\r\nissues from a by-road. Below, enclosed within an ample dike, stretches\r\na sheet of water which glistens like copper in the sunlight. Beyond, on\r\nthe side of a slope, lie some scattered peasants\' huts, a manor house,\r\nand, flanking the latter, a village church with its cross flashing\r\nlike a star. There also comes wafted to your ear the sound of peasants\'\r\nlaughter, while in your inner man you are becoming conscious of an\r\nappetite which is not to be withstood.\r\n\r\nOh long-drawn highway, how excellent you are! How often have I in\r\nweariness and despondency set forth upon your length, and found in you\r\nsalvation and rest! How often, as I followed your leading, have I been\r\nvisited with wonderful thoughts and poetic dreams and curious, wild\r\nimpressions!\r\n\r\nAt this moment our friend Chichikov also was experiencing visions of a\r\nnot wholly prosaic nature. Let us peep into his soul and share them.\r\nAt first he remained unconscious of anything whatsoever, for he was too\r\nmuch engaged in making sure that he was really clear of the town; but\r\nas soon as he saw that it had completely disappeared, with its mills and\r\nfactories and other urban appurtenances, and that even the steeples\r\nof the white stone churches had sunk below the horizon, he turned his\r\nattention to the road, and the town of N. vanished from his thoughts as\r\ncompletely as though he had not seen it since childhood. Again, in its\r\nturn, the road ceased to interest him, and he began to close his eyes\r\nand to loll his head against the cushions. Of this let the author\r\ntake advantage, in order to speak at length concerning his hero; since\r\nhitherto he (the author) has been prevented from so doing by Nozdrev and\r\nballs and ladies and local intrigues--by those thousand trifles which\r\nseem trifles only when they are introduced into a book, but which, in\r\nlife, figure as affairs of importance. Let us lay them aside, and betake\r\nourselves to business.\r\n\r\nWhether the character whom I have selected for my hero has pleased my\r\nreaders is, of course, exceedingly doubtful. At all events the ladies\r\nwill have failed to approve him for the fair sex demands in a hero\r\nperfection, and, should there be the least mental or physical stain\r\non him--well, woe betide! Yes, no matter how profoundly the author may\r\nprobe that hero\'s soul, no matter how clearly he may portray his figure\r\nas in a mirror, he will be given no credit for the achievement. Indeed,\r\nChichikov\'s very stoutness and plenitude of years may have militated\r\nagainst him, for never is a hero pardoned for the former, and the\r\nmajority of ladies will, in such case, turn away, and mutter to\r\nthemselves: "Phew! What a beast!" Yes, the author is well aware of this.\r\nYet, though he could not, to save his life, take a person of virtue for\r\nhis principal character, it may be that this story contains themes\r\nnever before selected, and that in it there projects the whole boundless\r\nwealth of Russian psychology; that it portrays, as well as Chichikov,\r\nthe peasant who is gifted with the virtues which God has sent him, and\r\nthe marvellous maiden of Russia who has not her like in all the world\r\nfor her beautiful feminine spirituality, the roots of which lie buried\r\nin noble aspirations and boundless self-denial. In fact, compared with\r\nthese types, the virtuous of other races seem lifeless, as does an\r\ninanimate volume when compared with the living word. Yes, each time that\r\nthere arises in Russia a movement of thought, it becomes clear that the\r\nmovement sinks deep into the Slavonic nature where it would but have\r\nskimmed the surface of other nations.--But why am I talking like this?\r\nWhither am I tending? It is indeed shameful that an author who long\r\nago reached man\'s estate, and was brought up to a course of severe\r\nintrospection and sober, solitary self-enlightenment, should give way to\r\nsuch jejune wandering from the point. To everything its proper time\r\nand place and turn. As I was saying, it does not lie in me to take a\r\nvirtuous character for my hero: and I will tell you why. It is because\r\nit is high time that a rest were given to the "poor, but virtuous"\r\nindividual; it is because the phrase "a man of worth" has grown into a\r\nby-word; it is because the "man of worth" has become converted into a\r\nhorse, and there is not a writer but rides him and flogs him, in and out\r\nof season; it is because the "man of worth" has been starved until he\r\nhas not a shred of his virtue left, and all that remains of his body is\r\nbut the ribs and the hide; it is because the "man of worth" is for ever\r\nbeing smuggled upon the scene; it is because the "man of worth" has at\r\nlength forfeited every one\'s respect. For these reasons do I reaffirm\r\nthat it is high time to yoke a rascal to the shafts. Let us yoke that\r\nrascal.\r\n\r\nOur hero\'s beginnings were both modest and obscure. True, his parents\r\nwere dvoriane, but he in no way resembled them. At all events, a short,\r\nsquab female relative who was present at his birth exclaimed as she\r\nlifted up the baby: "He is altogether different from what I had expected\r\nhim to be. He ought to have taken after his maternal grandmother,\r\nwhereas he has been born, as the proverb has it, \'like not father nor\r\nmother, but like a chance passer-by.\'" Thus from the first life\r\nregarded the little Chichikov with sour distaste, and as through a dim,\r\nfrost-encrusted window. A tiny room with diminutive casements which were\r\nnever opened, summer or winter; an invalid father in a dressing-gown\r\nlined with lambskin, and with an ailing foot swathed in bandages--a man\r\nwho was continually drawing deep breaths, and walking up and down the\r\nroom, and spitting into a sandbox; a period of perpetually sitting on\r\na bench with pen in hand and ink on lips and fingers; a period of being\r\neternally confronted with the copy-book maxim, "Never tell a lie, but\r\nobey your superiors, and cherish virtue in your heart;" an everlasting\r\nscraping and shuffling of slippers up and down the room; a period of\r\ncontinually hearing a well-known, strident voice exclaim: "So you have\r\nbeen playing the fool again!" at times when the child, weary of the\r\nmortal monotony of his task, had added a superfluous embellishment\r\nto his copy; a period of experiencing the ever-familiar, but\r\never-unpleasant, sensation which ensued upon those words as the boy\'s\r\near was painfully twisted between two long fingers bent backwards at\r\nthe tips--such is the miserable picture of that youth of which, in later\r\nlife, Chichikov preserved but the faintest of memories! But in this\r\nworld everything is liable to swift and sudden change; and, one day in\r\nearly spring, when the rivers had melted, the father set forth with\r\nhis little son in a teliezshka [37] drawn by a sorrel steed of the kind\r\nknown to horsy folk as a soroka, and having as coachman the diminutive\r\nhunchback who, father of the only serf family belonging to the elder\r\nChichikov, served as general factotum in the Chichikov establishment.\r\nFor a day and a half the soroka conveyed them on their way; during which\r\ntime they spent the night at a roadside inn, crossed a river, dined off\r\ncold pie and roast mutton, and eventually arrived at the county town. To\r\nthe lad the streets presented a spectacle of unwonted brilliancy, and\r\nhe gaped with amazement. Turning into a side alley wherein the mire\r\nnecessitated both the most strenuous exertions on the soroka\'s part and\r\nthe most vigorous castigation on the part of the driver and the barin,\r\nthe conveyance eventually reached the gates of a courtyard which,\r\ncombined with a small fruit garden containing various bushes, a couple\r\nof apple-trees in blossom, and a mean, dirty little shed, constituted\r\nthe premises attached to an antiquated-looking villa. Here there lived\r\na relative of the Chichikovs, a wizened old lady who went to market in\r\nperson and dried her stockings at the samovar. On seeing the boy, she\r\npatted his cheek and expressed satisfaction at his physique; whereupon\r\nthe fact became disclosed that here he was to abide for a while, for\r\nthe purpose of attending a local school. After a night\'s rest his father\r\nprepared to betake himself homeward again; but no tears marked the\r\nparting between him and his son, he merely gave the lad a copper or two\r\nand (a far more important thing) the following injunctions. "See here,\r\nmy boy. Do your lessons well, do not idle or play the fool, and above\r\nall things, see that you please your teachers. So long as you observe\r\nthese rules you will make progress, and surpass your fellows, even if\r\nGod shall have denied you brains, and you should fail in your studies.\r\nAlso, do not consort overmuch with your comrades, for they will do you\r\nno good; but, should you do so, then make friends with the richer of\r\nthem, since one day they may be useful to you. Also, never entertain or\r\ntreat any one, but see that every one entertains and treats YOU. Lastly,\r\nand above all else, keep and save your every kopeck. To save money is\r\nthe most important thing in life. Always a friend or a comrade may fail\r\nyou, and be the first to desert you in a time of adversity; but never\r\nwill a KOPECK fail you, whatever may be your plight. Nothing in the\r\nworld cannot be done, cannot be attained, with the aid of money." These\r\ninjunctions given, the father embraced his son, and set forth on his\r\nreturn; and though the son never again beheld his parent, the latter\'s\r\nwords and precepts sank deep into the little Chichikov\'s soul.\r\n\r\nThe next day young Pavlushka made his first attendance at school. But no\r\nspecial aptitude in any branch of learning did he display. Rather, his\r\ndistinguishing characteristics were diligence and neatness. On the other\r\nhand, he developed great intelligence as regards the PRACTICAL aspect\r\nof life. In a trice he divined and comprehended how things ought to\r\nbe worked, and, from that time forth, bore himself towards his\r\nschool-fellows in such a way that, though they frequently gave him\r\npresents, he not only never returned the compliment, but even on\r\noccasions pocketed the gifts for the mere purpose of selling them again.\r\nAlso, boy though he was, he acquired the art of self-denial. Of the\r\ntrifle which his father had given him on parting he spent not a kopeck,\r\nbut, the same year, actually added to his little store by fashioning\r\na bullfinch of wax, painting it, and selling the same at a handsome\r\nprofit. Next, as time went on, he engaged in other speculations--in\r\nparticular, in the scheme of buying up eatables, taking his seat in\r\nclass beside boys who had plenty of pocket-money, and, as soon as such\r\nopulent individuals showed signs of failing attention (and, therefore,\r\nof growing appetite), tendering them, from beneath the desk, a roll of\r\npudding or a piece of gingerbread, and charging according to degree\r\nof appetite and size of portion. He also spent a couple of months in\r\ntraining a mouse, which he kept confined in a little wooden cage in his\r\nbedroom. At length, when the training had reached the point that, at the\r\nseveral words of command, the mouse would stand upon its hind legs,\r\nlie down, and get up again, he sold the creature for a respectable sum.\r\nThus, in time, his gains attained the amount of five roubles; whereupon\r\nhe made himself a purse and then started to fill a second receptacle of\r\nthe kind. Still more studied was his attitude towards the authorities.\r\nNo one could sit more quietly in his place on the bench than he. In the\r\nsame connection it may be remarked that his teacher was a man who, above\r\nall things, loved peace and good behaviour, and simply could not\r\nabide clever, witty boys, since he suspected them of laughing at him.\r\nConsequently any lad who had once attracted the master\'s attention with\r\na manifestation of intelligence needed but to shuffle in his place, or\r\nunintentionally to twitch an eyebrow, for the said master at once to\r\nburst into a rage, to turn the supposed offender out of the room, and\r\nto visit him with unmerciful punishment. "Ah, my fine fellow," he would\r\nsay, "I\'LL cure you of your impudence and want of respect! I know you\r\nthrough and through far better than you know yourself, and will take\r\ngood care that you have to go down upon your knees and curb your\r\nappetite." Whereupon the wretched lad would, for no cause of which he\r\nwas aware, be forced to wear out his breeches on the floor and go hungry\r\nfor days. "Talents and gifts," the schoolmaster would declare, "are so\r\nmuch rubbish. I respect only good behaviour, and shall award full marks\r\nto those who conduct themselves properly, even if they fail to learn a\r\nsingle letter of their alphabet: whereas to those in whom I may perceive\r\na tendency to jocularity I shall award nothing, even though they should\r\noutdo Solon himself." For the same reason he had no great love of the\r\nauthor Krylov, in that the latter says in one of his Fables: "In my\r\nopinion, the more one sings, the better one works;" and often the\r\npedagogue would relate how, in a former school of his, the silence had\r\nbeen such that a fly could be heard buzzing on the wing, and for the\r\nspace of a whole year not a single pupil sneezed or coughed in class,\r\nand so complete was the absence of all sound that no one could have\r\ntold that there was a soul in the place. Of this mentor young Chichikov\r\nspeedily appraised the mentality; wherefore he fashioned his behaviour\r\nto correspond with it. Not an eyelid, not an eyebrow, would he stir\r\nduring school hours, howsoever many pinches he might receive from\r\nbehind; and only when the bell rang would he run to anticipate his\r\nfellows in handing the master the three-cornered cap which that\r\ndignitary customarily sported, and then to be the first to leave the\r\nclass-room, and contrive to meet the master not less than two or three\r\ntimes as the latter walked homeward, in order that, on each occasion,\r\nhe might doff his cap. And the scheme proved entirely successful.\r\nThroughout the period of his attendance at school he was held in high\r\nfavour, and, on leaving the establishment, received full marks for every\r\nsubject, as well as a diploma and a book inscribed (in gilt letters)\r\n"For Exemplary Diligence and the Perfection of Good Conduct." By this\r\ntime he had grown into a fairly good-looking youth of the age when the\r\nchin first calls for a razor; and at about the same period his father\r\ndied, leaving behind him, as his estate, four waistcoats completely worn\r\nout, two ancient frockcoats, and a small sum of money. Apparently he had\r\nbeen skilled only in RECOMMENDING the saving of kopecks--not in ACTUALLY\r\nPRACTISING the art. Upon that Chichikov sold the old house and its\r\nlittle parcel of land for a thousand roubles, and removed, with his\r\none serf and the serf\'s family, to the capital, where he set about\r\norganising a new establishment and entering the Civil Service.\r\nSimultaneously with his doing so, his old schoolmaster lost (through\r\nstupidity or otherwise) the establishment over which he had hitherto\r\npresided, and in which he had set so much store by silence and good\r\nbehaviour. Grief drove him to drink, and when nothing was left, even\r\nfor that purpose, he retired--ill, helpless, and starving--into a\r\nbroken-down, cheerless hovel. But certain of his former pupils--the same\r\nclever, witty lads whom he had once been wont to accuse of impertinence\r\nand evil conduct generally--heard of his pitiable plight, and collected\r\nfor him what money they could, even to the point of selling their own\r\nnecessaries. Only Chichikov, when appealed to, pleaded inability, and\r\ncompromised with a contribution of a single piatak [38]: which his\r\nold schoolfellows straightway returned him--full in the face, and\r\naccompanied with a shout of "Oh, you skinflint!" As for the poor\r\nschoolmaster, when he heard what his former pupils had done, he buried\r\nhis face in his hands, and the tears gushed from his failing eyes as\r\nfrom those of a helpless infant. "God has brought you but to weep over\r\nmy death-bed," he murmured feebly; and added with a profound sigh, on\r\nhearing of Chichikov\'s conduct: "Ah, Pavlushka, how a human being may\r\nbecome changed! Once you were a good lad, and gave me no trouble; but\r\nnow you are become proud indeed!"\r\n\r\nYet let it not be inferred from this that our hero\'s character had grown\r\nso blase and hard, or his conscience so blunted, as to preclude his\r\nexperiencing a particle of sympathy or compassion. As a matter of fact,\r\nhe was capable both of the one and the other, and would have been glad\r\nto assist his old teacher had no great sum been required, or had he not\r\nbeen called upon to touch the fund which he had decided should remain\r\nintact. In other words, the father\'s injunction, "Guard and save every\r\nkopeck," had become a hard and fast rule of the son\'s. Yet the youth had\r\nno particular attachment to money for money\'s sake; he was not possessed\r\nwith the true instinct for hoarding and niggardliness. Rather, before\r\nhis eyes there floated ever a vision of life and its amenities and\r\nadvantages--a vision of carriages and an elegantly furnished house and\r\nrecherche dinners; and it was in the hope that some day he might attain\r\nthese things that he saved every kopeck and, meanwhile, stinted both\r\nhimself and others. Whenever a rich man passed him by in a splendid\r\ndrozhki drawn by swift and handsomely-caparisoned horses, he would halt\r\nas though deep in thought, and say to himself, like a man awakening\r\nfrom a long sleep: "That gentleman must have been a financier, he has so\r\nlittle hair on his brow." In short, everything connected with wealth and\r\nplenty produced upon him an ineffaceable impression. Even when he left\r\nschool he took no holiday, so strong in him was the desire to get to\r\nwork and enter the Civil Service. Yet, for all the encomiums contained\r\nin his diploma, he had much ado to procure a nomination to a Government\r\nDepartment; and only after a long time was a minor post found for him,\r\nat a salary of thirty or forty roubles a year. Nevertheless, wretched\r\nthough this appointment was, he determined, by strict attention to\r\nbusiness, to overcome all obstacles, and to win success. And, indeed,\r\nthe self-denial, the patience, and the economy which he displayed\r\nwere remarkable. From early morn until late at night he would, with\r\nindefatigable zeal of body and mind, remain immersed in his sordid task\r\nof copying official documents--never going home, snatching what sleep he\r\ncould on tables in the building, and dining with the watchman on duty.\r\nYet all the while he contrived to remain clean and neat, to preserve\r\na cheerful expression of countenance, and even to cultivate a certain\r\nelegance of movement. In passing, it may be remarked that his fellow\r\ntchinovniks were a peculiarly plain, unsightly lot, some of them having\r\nfaces like badly baked bread, swollen cheeks, receding chins, and\r\ncracked and blistered upper lips. Indeed, not a man of them was\r\nhandsome. Also, their tone of voice always contained a note of\r\nsullenness, as though they had a mind to knock some one on the head; and\r\nby their frequent sacrifices to Bacchus they showed that even yet there\r\nremains in the Slavonic nature a certain element of paganism. Nay, the\r\nDirector\'s room itself they would invade while still licking their lips,\r\nand since their breath was not over-aromatic, the atmosphere of the room\r\ngrew not over-pleasant. Naturally, among such an official staff a man\r\nlike Chichikov could not fail to attract attention and remark, since in\r\neverything--in cheerfulness of demeanour, in suavity of voice, and\r\nin complete neglect of the use of strong potions--he was the absolute\r\nantithesis of his companions. Yet his path was not an easy one to tread,\r\nfor over him he had the misfortune to have placed in authority a Chief\r\nClerk who was a graven image of elderly insensibility and inertia.\r\nAlways the same, always unapproachable, this functionary could never in\r\nhis life have smiled or asked civilly after an acquaintance\'s health.\r\nNor had any one ever seen him a whit different in the street or at his\r\nown home from what he was in the office, or showing the least interest\r\nin anything whatever, or getting drunk and relapsing into jollity in\r\nhis cups, or indulging in that species of wild gaiety which, when\r\nintoxicated, even a burglar affects. No, not a particle of this was\r\nthere in him. Nor, for that matter, was there in him a particle of\r\nanything at all, whether good or bad: which complete negativeness\r\nof character produced rather a strange effect. In the same way, his\r\nwizened, marble-like features reminded one of nothing in particular, so\r\nprimly proportioned were they. Only the numerous pockmarks and dimples\r\nwith which they were pitted placed him among the number of those over\r\nwhose faces, to quote the popular saying, "The Devil has walked by night\r\nto grind peas." In short, it would seem that no human agency could have\r\napproached such a man and gained his goodwill. Yet Chichikov made the\r\neffort. As a first step, he took to consulting the other\'s convenience\r\nin all manner of insignificant trifles--to cleaning his pens carefully,\r\nand, when they had been prepared exactly to the Chief Clerk\'s liking,\r\nlaying them ready at his elbow; to dusting and sweeping from his table\r\nall superfluous sand and tobacco ash; to procuring a new mat for his\r\ninkstand; to looking for his hat--the meanest-looking hat that ever\r\nthe world beheld--and having it ready for him at the exact moment when\r\nbusiness came to an end; to brushing his back if it happened to become\r\nsmeared with whitewash from a wall. Yet all this passed as unnoticed\r\nas though it had never been done. Finally, Chichikov sniffed into his\r\nsuperior\'s family and domestic life, and learnt that he possessed a\r\ngrown-up daughter on whose face also there had taken place a nocturnal,\r\ndiabolical grinding of peas. HERE was a quarter whence a fresh attack\r\nmight be delivered! After ascertaining what church the daughter attended\r\non Sundays, our hero took to contriving to meet her in a neat suit and a\r\nwell-starched dickey: and soon the scheme began to work. The surly Chief\r\nClerk wavered for a while; then ended by inviting Chichikov to tea. Nor\r\ncould any man in the office have told you how it came about that before\r\nlong Chichikov had removed to the Chief Clerk\'s house, and become a\r\nperson necessary--indeed indispensable--to the household, seeing that he\r\nbought the flour and the sugar, treated the daughter as his betrothed,\r\ncalled the Chief Clerk "Papenka," and occasionally kissed "Papenka\'s"\r\nhand. In fact, every one at the office supposed that, at the end of\r\nFebruary (i.e. before the beginning of Lent) there would take place\r\na wedding. Nay, the surly father even began to agitate with the\r\nauthorities on Chichikov\'s behalf, and so enabled our hero, on a vacancy\r\noccurring, to attain the stool of a Chief Clerk. Apparently this marked\r\nthe consummation of Chichikov\'s relations with his host, for he hastened\r\nstealthily to pack his trunk and, the next day, figured in a fresh\r\nlodging. Also, he ceased to call the Chief Clerk "Papenka," or to kiss\r\nhis hand; and the matter of the wedding came to as abrupt a termination\r\nas though it had never been mooted. Yet also he never failed to press\r\nhis late host\'s hand, whenever he met him, and to invite him to tea;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, for all his immobility and dry indifference,\r\nthe Chief Clerk never failed to shake his head with a muttered, "Ah, my\r\nfine fellow, you have grown too proud, you have grown too proud."\r\n\r\nThe foregoing constituted the most difficult step that our hero had to\r\nnegotiate. Thereafter things came with greater ease and swifter\r\nsuccess. Everywhere he attracted notice, for he developed within\r\nhimself everything necessary for this world--namely, charm of manner\r\nand bearing, and great diligence in business matters. Armed with these\r\nresources, he next obtained promotion to what is known as "a fat post,"\r\nand used it to the best advantage; and even though, at that period,\r\nstrict inquiry had begun to be made into the whole subject of bribes,\r\nsuch inquiry failed to alarm him--nay, he actually turned it to account\r\nand thereby manifested the Russian resourcefulness which never fails to\r\nattain its zenith where extortion is concerned. His method of working\r\nwas the following. As soon as a petitioner or a suitor put his hand into\r\nhis pocket, to extract thence the necessary letters of recommendation\r\nfor signature, Chichikov would smilingly exclaim as he detained his\r\ninterlocutor\'s hand: "No, no! Surely you do not think that I--? But no,\r\nno! It is our duty, it is our obligation, and we do not require rewards\r\nfor doing our work properly. So far as YOUR matter is concerned, you may\r\nrest easy. Everything shall be carried through to-morrow. But may I\r\nhave your address? There is no need to trouble yourself, seeing that the\r\ndocuments can easily be brought to you at your residence." Upon which\r\nthe delighted suitor would return home in raptures, thinking: "Here, at\r\nlong last, is the sort of man so badly needed. A man of that kind is\r\na jewel beyond price." Yet for a day, for two days--nay, even for\r\nthree--the suitor would wait in vain so far as any messengers with\r\ndocuments were concerned. Then he would repair to the office--to find\r\nthat his business had not so much as been entered upon! Lastly, he would\r\nconfront the "jewel beyond price." "Oh, pardon me, pardon me!" Chichikov\r\nwould exclaim in the politest of tones as he seized and grasped the\r\nvisitor\'s hands. "The truth is that we have SUCH a quantity of business\r\non hand! But the matter shall be put through to-morrow, and in the\r\nmeanwhile I am most sorry about it." And with this would go the most\r\nfascinating of gestures. Yet neither on the morrow, nor on the day\r\nfollowing, nor on the third would documents arrive at the suitor\'s\r\nabode. Upon that he would take thought as to whether something more\r\nought not to have been done; and, sure enough, on his making inquiry,\r\nhe would be informed that "something will have to be given to the\r\ncopyists." "Well, there can be no harm in that," he would reply. "As a\r\nmatter of fact, I have ready a tchetvertak [39] or two." "Oh, no, no,"\r\nthe answer would come. "Not a tchetvertak per copyist, but a rouble,\r\nis the fee." "What? A rouble per copyist?" "Certainly. What is there to\r\ngrumble at in that? Of the money the copyists will receive a tchetvertak\r\napiece, and the rest will go to the Government." Upon that the\r\ndisillusioned suitor would fly out upon the new order of things brought\r\nabout by the inquiry into illicit fees, and curse both the tchinovniks\r\nand their uppish, insolent behaviour. "Once upon a time," would the\r\nsuitor lament, "one DID know what to do. Once one had tipped the\r\nDirector a bank-note, one\'s affair was, so to speak, in the hat. But\r\nnow one has to pay a rouble per copyist after waiting a week because\r\notherwise it was impossible to guess how the wind might set! The devil\r\nfly away with all \'disinterested\' and \'trustworthy\' tchinovniks!" And\r\ncertainly the aggrieved suitor had reason to grumble, seeing that,\r\nnow that bribe-takers had ceased to exist, and Directors had uniformly\r\nbecome men of honour and integrity, secretaries and clerks ought not\r\nwith impunity to have continued their thievish ways. In time there\r\nopened out to Chichikov a still wider field, for a Commission was\r\nappointed to supervise the erection of a Government building, and, on\r\nhis being nominated to that body, he proved himself one of its most\r\nactive members. The Commission got to work without delay, but for a\r\nspace of six years had some trouble with the building in question.\r\nEither the climate hindered operations or the materials used were of the\r\nkind which prevents official edifices from ever rising higher than the\r\nbasement. But, meanwhile, OTHER quarters of the town saw arise, for each\r\nmember of the Commission, a handsome house of the NON-official style of\r\narchitecture. Clearly the foundation afforded by the soil of those parts\r\nwas better than that where the Government building was still engaged\r\nin hanging fire! Likewise the members of the Commission began to look\r\nexceedingly prosperous, and to blossom out into family life; and, for\r\nthe first time in his existence, even Chichikov also departed from the\r\niron laws of his self-imposed restraint and inexorable self-denial, and\r\nso far mitigated his heretofore asceticism as to show himself a man not\r\naverse to those amenities which, during his youth, he had been capable\r\nof renouncing. That is to say, certain superfluities began to make their\r\nappearance in his establishment. He engaged a good cook, took to wearing\r\nlinen shirts, bought for himself cloth of a pattern worn by no one else\r\nin the province, figured in checks shot with the brightest of reds and\r\nbrowns, fitted himself out with two splendid horses (which he drove with\r\na single pair of reins, added to a ring attachment for the trace horse),\r\ndeveloped a habit of washing with a sponge dipped in eau-de-Cologne, and\r\ninvested in soaps of the most expensive quality, in order to communicate\r\nto his skin a more elegant polish.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly there appeared upon the scene a new Director--a military\r\nman, and a martinet as regarded his hostility to bribe-takers and\r\nanything which might be called irregular. On the very day after his\r\narrival he struck fear into every breast by calling for accounts,\r\ndiscovering hosts of deficits and missing sums, and directing his\r\nattention to the aforesaid fine houses of civilian architecture. Upon\r\nthat there ensued a complete reshuffling. Tchinovniks were retired\r\nwholesale, and the houses were sequestrated to the Government, or else\r\nconverted into various pious institutions and schools for soldiers\'\r\nchildren. Thus the whole fabric, and especially Chichikov, came crashing\r\nto the ground. Particularly did our hero\'s agreeable face displease the\r\nnew Director. Why that was so it is impossible to say, but frequently,\r\nin cases of the kind, no reason exists. However, the Director conceived\r\na mortal dislike to him, and also extended that enmity to the whole of\r\nChichikov\'s colleagues. But inasmuch as the said Director was a military\r\nman, he was not fully acquainted with the myriad subtleties of the\r\ncivilian mind; wherefore it was not long before, by dint of maintaining\r\na discreet exterior, added to a faculty for humouring all and sundry,\r\na fresh gang of tchinovniks succeeded in restoring him to mildness, and\r\nthe General found himself in the hands of greater thieves than before,\r\nbut thieves whom he did not even suspect, seeing that he believed\r\nhimself to have selected men fit and proper, and even ventured to\r\nboast of possessing a keen eye for talent. In a trice the tchinovniks\r\nconcerned appraised his spirit and character; with the result that the\r\nentire sphere over which he ruled became an agency for the detection of\r\nirregularities. Everywhere, and in every case, were those irregularities\r\npursued as a fisherman pursues a fat sturgeon with a gaff; and to such\r\nan extent did the sport prove successful that almost in no time each\r\nparticipator in the hunt was seen to be in possession of several\r\nthousand roubles of capital. Upon that a large number of the former band\r\nof tchinovniks also became converted to paths of rectitude, and were\r\nallowed to re-enter the Service; but not by hook or by crook could\r\nChichikov worm his way back, even though, incited thereto by sundry\r\nitems of paper currency, the General\'s first secretary and principal\r\nbear leader did all he could on our hero\'s behalf. It seemed that the\r\nGeneral was the kind of man who, though easily led by the nose (provided\r\nit was done without his knowledge) no sooner got an idea into his head\r\nthan it stuck there like a nail, and could not possibly be extracted;\r\nand all that the wily secretary succeeded in procuring was the tearing\r\nup of a certain dirty fragment of paper--even that being effected only\r\nby an appeal to the General\'s compassion, on the score of the unhappy\r\nfate which, otherwise, would befall Chichikov\'s wife and children (who,\r\nluckily, had no existence in fact).\r\n\r\n"Well," said Chichikov to himself, "I have done my best, and now\r\neverything has failed. Lamenting my misfortune won\'t help me, but only\r\naction." And with that he decided to begin his career anew, and once\r\nmore to arm himself with the weapons of patience and self-denial. The\r\nbetter to effect this, he had, of course to remove to another town. Yet\r\nsomehow, for a while, things miscarried. More than once he found himself\r\nforced to exchange one post for another, and at the briefest of notice;\r\nand all of them were posts of the meanest, the most wretched, order.\r\nYet, being a man of the utmost nicety of feeling, the fact that he found\r\nhimself rubbing shoulders with anything but nice companions did not\r\nprevent him from preserving intact his innate love of what was decent\r\nand seemly, or from cherishing the instinct which led him to hanker\r\nafter office fittings of lacquered wood, with neatness and orderliness\r\neverywhere. Nor did he at any time permit a foul word to creep into\r\nhis speech, and would feel hurt even if in the speech of others there\r\noccurred a scornful reference to anything which pertained to rank and\r\ndignity. Also, the reader will be pleased to know that our hero changed\r\nhis linen every other day, and in summer, when the weather was very\r\nhot, EVERY day, seeing that the very faintest suspicion of an unpleasant\r\nodour offended his fastidiousness. For the same reason it was his\r\ncustom, before being valeted by Petrushka, always to plug his nostrils\r\nwith a couple of cloves. In short, there were many occasions when his\r\nnerves suffered rackings as cruel as a young girl\'s, and so helped to\r\nincrease his disgust at having once more to associate with men who set\r\nno store by the decencies of life. Yet, though he braced himself to the\r\ntask, this period of adversity told upon his health, and he even grew a\r\ntrifle shabby. More than once, on happening to catch sight of himself\r\nin the mirror, he could not forbear exclaiming: "Holy Mother of God,\r\nbut what a nasty-looking brute I have become!" and for a long while\r\nafterwards could not with anything like sang-froid contemplate his\r\nreflection. Yet throughout he bore up stoutly and patiently--and ended\r\nby being transferred to the Customs Department. It may be said that the\r\ndepartment had long constituted the secret goal of his ambition, for\r\nhe had noted the foreign elegancies with which its officials always\r\ncontrived to provide themselves, and had also observed that invariably\r\nthey were able to send presents of china and cambric to their sisters\r\nand aunts--well, to their lady friends generally. Yes, more than once\r\nhe had said to himself with a sigh: "THAT is the department to which I\r\nought to belong, for, given a town near the frontier, and a sensible set\r\nof colleagues, I might be able to fit myself out with excellent linen\r\nshirts." Also, it may be said that most frequently of all had his\r\nthoughts turned towards a certain quality of French soap which imparted\r\na peculiar whiteness to the skin and a peerless freshness to the cheeks.\r\nIts name is known to God alone, but at least it was to be procured only\r\nin the immediate neighbourhood of the frontier. So, as I say, Chichikov\r\nhad long felt a leaning towards the Customs, but for a time had been\r\nrestrained from applying for the same by the various current advantages\r\nof the Building Commission; since rightly he had adjudged the latter to\r\nconstitute a bird in the hand, and the former to constitute only a bird\r\nin the bush. But now he decided that, come what might, into the Customs\r\nhe must make his way. And that way he made, and then applied himself\r\nto his new duties with a zeal born of the fact that he realised that\r\nfortune had specially marked him out for a Customs officer. Indeed,\r\nsuch activity, perspicuity, and ubiquity as his had never been seen or\r\nthought of. Within four weeks at the most he had so thoroughly got his\r\nhand in that he was conversant with Customs procedure in every detail.\r\nNot only could he weigh and measure, but also he could divine from\r\nan invoice how many arshins of cloth or other material a given piece\r\ncontained, and then, taking a roll of the latter in his hand, could\r\nspecify at once the number of pounds at which it would tip the scale. As\r\nfor searchings, well, even his colleagues had to admit that he possessed\r\nthe nose of a veritable bloodhound, and that it was impossible not\r\nto marvel at the patience wherewith he would try every button of the\r\nsuspected person, yet preserve, throughout, a deadly politeness and an\r\nicy sang-froid which surpass belief. And while the searched were raging,\r\nand foaming at the mouth, and feeling that they would give worlds to\r\nalter his smiling exterior with a good, resounding slap, he would\r\nmove not a muscle of his face, nor abate by a jot the urbanity of his\r\ndemeanour, as he murmured, "Do you mind so far incommoding yourself as\r\nto stand up?" or "Pray step into the next room, madam, where the wife\r\nof one of our staff will attend you," or "Pray allow me to slip this\r\npenknife of mine into the lining of your coat" (after which he would\r\nextract thence shawls and towels with as much nonchalance as he\r\nwould have done from his own travelling-trunk). Even his superiors\r\nacknowledged him to be a devil at the job, rather than a human being, so\r\nperfect was his instinct for looking into cart-wheels, carriage-poles,\r\nhorses\' ears, and places whither an author ought not to penetrate even\r\nin thought--places whither only a Customs official is permitted to go.\r\nThe result was that the wretched traveller who had just crossed the\r\nfrontier would, within a few minutes, become wholly at sea, and, wiping\r\naway the perspiration, and breaking out into body flushes, would be\r\nreduced to crossing himself and muttering, "Well, well, well!" In fact,\r\nsuch a traveller would feel in the position of a schoolboy who, having\r\nbeen summoned to the presence of the headmaster for the ostensible\r\npurpose of being given an order, has found that he receives, instead, a\r\nsound flogging. In short, for some time Chichikov made it impossible\r\nfor smugglers to earn a living. In particular, he reduced Polish\r\nJewry almost to despair, so invincible, so almost unnatural, was the\r\nrectitude, the incorruptibility which led him to refrain from converting\r\nhimself into a small capitalist with the aid of confiscated goods and\r\narticles which, "to save excessive clerical labour," had failed to be\r\nhanded over to the Government. Also, without saying it goes that\r\nsuch phenomenally zealous and disinterested service attracted general\r\nastonishment, and, eventually, the notice of the authorities; whereupon\r\nhe received promotion, and followed that up by mooting a scheme for\r\nthe infallible detection of contrabandists, provided that he could be\r\nfurnished with the necessary authority for carrying out the same. At\r\nonce such authority was accorded him, as also unlimited power to conduct\r\nevery species of search and investigation. And that was all he\r\nwanted. It happened that previously there had been formed a well-found\r\nassociation for smuggling on regular, carefully prepared lines, and\r\nthat this daring scheme seemed to promise profit to the extent of\r\nsome millions of money: yet, though he had long had knowledge of it,\r\nChichikov had said to the association\'s emissaries, when sent to buy him\r\nover, "The time is not yet." But now that he had got all the reins into\r\nhis hands, he sent word of the fact to the gang, and with it the remark,\r\n"The time is NOW." Nor was he wrong in his calculations, for, within\r\nthe space of a year, he had acquired what he could not have made during\r\ntwenty years of non-fraudulent service. With similar sagacity he had,\r\nduring his early days in the department, declined altogether to enter\r\ninto relations with the association, for the reason that he had then\r\nbeen a mere cipher, and would have come in for nothing large in the way\r\nof takings; but now--well, now it was another matter altogether, and\r\nhe could dictate what terms he liked. Moreover, that the affair might\r\nprogress the more smoothly, he suborned a fellow tchinovnik of the type\r\nwhich, in spite of grey hairs, stands powerless against temptation;\r\nand, the contract concluded, the association duly proceeded to business.\r\nCertainly business began brilliantly. But probably most of my readers\r\nare familiar with the oft-repeated story of the passage of Spanish sheep\r\nacross the frontier in double fleeces which carried between their outer\r\nlayers and their inner enough lace of Brabant to sell to the tune of\r\nmillions of roubles; wherefore I will not recount the story again beyond\r\nsaying that those journeys took place just when Chichikov had become\r\nhead of the Customs, and that, had he not a hand in the enterprise, not\r\nall the Jews in the world could have brought it to success. By the time\r\nthat three or four of these ovine invasions had taken place, Chichikov\r\nand his accomplice had come to be the possessors of four hundred\r\nthousand roubles apiece; while some even aver that the former\'s gains\r\ntotalled half a million, owing to the greater industry which he had\r\ndisplayed in the matter. Nor can any one but God say to what a figure\r\nthe fortunes of the pair might not eventually have attained, had not an\r\nawkward contretemps cut right across their arrangements. That is to\r\nsay, for some reason or another the devil so far deprived these\r\ntchinovnik-conspirators of sense as to make them come to words with\r\none another, and then to engage in a quarrel. Beginning with a heated\r\nargument, this quarrel reached the point of Chichikov--who was,\r\npossibly, a trifle tipsy--calling his colleague a priest\'s son; and\r\nthough that description of the person so addressed was perfectly\r\naccurate, he chose to take offence, and to answer Chichikov with the\r\nwords (loudly and incisively uttered), "It is YOU who have a priest for\r\nyour father," and to add to that (the more to incense his companion),\r\n"Yes, mark you! THAT is how it is." Yet, though he had thus turned the\r\ntables upon Chichikov with a tu quoque, and then capped that exploit\r\nwith the words last quoted, the offended tchinovnik could not remain\r\nsatisfied, but went on to send in an anonymous document to the\r\nauthorities. On the other hand, some aver that it was over a woman that\r\nthe pair fell out--over a woman who, to quote the phrase then current\r\namong the staff of the Customs Department, was "as fresh and as strong\r\nas the pulp of a turnip," and that night-birds were hired to assault our\r\nhero in a dark alley, and that the scheme miscarried, and that in any\r\ncase both Chichikov and his friend had been deceived, seeing that the\r\nperson to whom the lady had really accorded her favours was a certain\r\nstaff-captain named Shamsharev. However, only God knows the truth of the\r\nmatter. Let the inquisitive reader ferret it out for himself. The fact\r\nremains that a complete exposure of the dealings with the contrabandists\r\nfollowed, and that the two tchinovniks were put to the question,\r\ndeprived of their property, and made to formulate in writing all that\r\nthey had done. Against this thunderbolt of fortune the State Councillor\r\ncould make no headway, and in some retired spot or another sank into\r\noblivion; but Chichikov put a brave face upon the matter, for, in\r\nspite of the authorities\' best efforts to smell out his gains, he had\r\ncontrived to conceal a portion of them, and also resorted to every\r\nsubtle trick of intellect which could possibly be employed by an\r\nexperienced man of the world who has a wide knowledge of his fellows.\r\nNothing which could be effected by pleasantness of demeanour, by moving\r\noratory, by clouds of flattery, and by the occasional insertion of\r\na coin into a palm did he leave undone; with the result that he was\r\nretired with less ignominy than was his companion, and escaped actual\r\ntrial on a criminal charge. Yet he issued stripped of all his capital,\r\nstripped of his imported effects, stripped of everything. That is to\r\nsay, all that remained to him consisted of ten thousand roubles which he\r\nhad stored against a rainy day, two dozen linen shirts, a small britchka\r\nof the type used by bachelors, and two serving-men named Selifan and\r\nPetrushka. Yes, and an impulse of kindness moved the tchinovniks of the\r\nCustoms also to set aside for him a few cakes of the soap which he had\r\nfound so excellent for the freshness of the cheeks. Thus once more our\r\nhero found himself stranded. And what an accumulation of misfortunes had\r\ndescended upon his head!--though, true, he termed them "suffering in the\r\nService in the cause of Truth." Certainly one would have thought that,\r\nafter these buffetings and trials and changes of fortune--after this\r\ntaste of the sorrows of life--he and his precious ten thousand roubles\r\nwould have withdrawn to some peaceful corner in a provincial town,\r\nwhere, clad in a stuff dressing-gown, he could have sat and listened to\r\nthe peasants quarrelling on festival days, or (for the sake of a breath\r\nof fresh air) have gone in person to the poulterer\'s to finger chickens\r\nfor soup, and so have spent a quiet, but not wholly useless, existence;\r\nbut nothing of the kind took place, and therein we must do justice to\r\nthe strength of his character. In other words, although he had undergone\r\nwhat, to the majority of men, would have meant ruin and discouragement\r\nand a shattering of ideals, he still preserved his energy. True,\r\ndowncast and angry, and full of resentment against the world in general,\r\nhe felt furious with the injustice of fate, and dissatisfied with\r\nthe dealings of men; yet he could not forbear courting additional\r\nexperiences. In short, the patience which he displayed was such as to\r\nmake the wooden persistency of the German--a persistency merely due to\r\nthe slow, lethargic circulation of the Teuton\'s blood--seem nothing at\r\nall, seeing that by nature Chichikov\'s blood flowed strongly, and\r\nthat he had to employ much force of will to curb within himself those\r\nelements which longed to burst forth and revel in freedom. He thought\r\nthings over, and, as he did so, a certain spice of reason appeared in\r\nhis reflections.\r\n\r\n"How have I come to be what I am?" he said to himself. "Why has\r\nmisfortune overtaken me in this way? Never have I wronged a poor person,\r\nor robbed a widow, or turned any one out of doors: I have always been\r\ncareful only to take advantage of those who possess more than their\r\nshare. Moreover, I have never gleaned anywhere but where every one else\r\nwas gleaning; and, had I not done so, others would have gleaned in my\r\nplace. Why, then, should those others be prospering, and I be sunk as\r\nlow as a worm? What am I? What am I good for? How can I, in future, hope\r\nto look any honest father of a family in the face? How shall I escape\r\nbeing tortured with the thought that I am cumbering the ground? What,\r\nin the years to come, will my children say, save that \'our father was a\r\nbrute, for he left us nothing to live upon?\'"\r\n\r\nHere I may remark that we have seen how much thought Chichikov devoted\r\nto his future descendants. Indeed, had not there been constantly\r\nrecurring to his mind the insistent question, "What will my children\r\nsay?" he might not have plunged into the affair so deeply. Nevertheless,\r\nlike a wary cat which glances hither and thither to see whether its\r\nmistress be not coming before it can make off with whatsoever first\r\nfalls to its paw (butter, fat, lard, a duck, or anything else), so our\r\nfuture founder of a family continued, though weeping and bewailing\r\nhis lot, to let not a single detail escape his eye. That is to say,\r\nhe retained his wits ever in a state of activity, and kept his brain\r\nconstantly working. All that he required was a plan. Once more he pulled\r\nhimself together, once more he embarked upon a life of toil, once more\r\nhe stinted himself in everything, once more he left clean and decent\r\nsurroundings for a dirty, mean existence. In other words, until\r\nsomething better should turn up, he embraced the calling of an ordinary\r\nattorney--a calling which, not then possessed of a civic status, was\r\njostled on very side, enjoyed little respect at the hands of the minor\r\nlegal fry (or, indeed, at its own), and perforce met with universal\r\nslights and rudeness. But sheer necessity compelled Chichikov to face\r\nthese things. Among commissions entrusted to him was that of placing in\r\nthe hands of the Public Trustee several hundred peasants who belonged\r\nto a ruined estate. The estate had reached its parlous condition through\r\ncattle disease, through rascally bailiffs, through failures of the\r\nharvest, through such epidemic diseases that had killed off the best\r\nworkmen, and, last, but not least, through the senseless conduct of the\r\nowner himself, who had furnished a house in Moscow in the latest style,\r\nand then squandered his every kopeck, so that nothing was left for\r\nhis further maintenance, and it became necessary to mortgage the\r\nremains--including the peasants--of the estate. In those days mortgage\r\nto the Treasury was an innovation looked upon with reserve, and, as\r\nattorney in the matter, Chichikov had first of all to "entertain" every\r\nofficial concerned (we know that, unless that be previously done, unless\r\na whole bottle of madeira first be emptied down each clerical throat,\r\nnot the smallest legal affair can be carried through), and to explain,\r\nfor the barring of future attachments, that half of the peasants were\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n"And are they entered on the revision lists?" asked the secretary.\r\n"Yes," replied Chichikov. "Then what are you boggling at?" continued the\r\nSecretary. "Should one soul die, another will be born, and in time grow\r\nup to take the first one\'s place." Upon that there dawned on our hero\r\none of the most inspired ideas which ever entered the human brain. "What\r\na simpleton I am!" he thought to himself. "Here am I looking about for\r\nmy mittens when all the time I have got them tucked into my belt. Why,\r\nwere I myself to buy up a few souls which are dead--to buy them before\r\na new revision list shall have been made, the Council of Public Trust\r\nmight pay me two hundred roubles apiece for them, and I might find\r\nmyself with, say, a capital of two hundred thousand roubles! The present\r\nmoment is particularly propitious, since in various parts of the country\r\nthere has been an epidemic, and, glory be to God, a large number of\r\nsouls have died of it. Nowadays landowners have taken to card-playing\r\nand junketting and wasting their money, or to joining the Civil Service\r\nin St. Petersburg; consequently their estates are going to rack and\r\nruin, and being managed in any sort of fashion, and succeeding in paying\r\ntheir dues with greater difficulty each year. That being so, not a man\r\nof the lot but would gladly surrender to me his dead souls rather than\r\ncontinue paying the poll-tax; and in this fashion I might make--well,\r\nnot a few kopecks. Of course there are difficulties, and, to avoid\r\ncreating a scandal, I should need to employ plenty of finesse; but man\r\nwas given his brain to USE, not to neglect. One good point about the\r\nscheme is that it will seem so improbable that in case of an accident,\r\nno one in the world will believe in it. True, it is illegal to buy or\r\nmortgage peasants without land, but I can easily pretend to be buying\r\nthem only for transferment elsewhere. Land is to be acquired in the\r\nprovinces of Taurida and Kherson almost for nothing, provided that one\r\nundertakes subsequently to colonise it; so to Kherson I will \'transfer\'\r\nthem, and long may they live there! And the removal of my dead souls\r\nshall be carried out in the strictest legal form; and if the authorities\r\nshould want confirmation by testimony, I shall produce a letter signed\r\nby my own superintendent of the Khersonian rural police--that is to\r\nsay, by myself. Lastly, the supposed village in Kherson shall be called\r\nChichikovoe--better still Pavlovskoe, according to my Christian name."\r\n\r\nIn this fashion there germinated in our hero\'s brain that strange scheme\r\nfor which the reader may or may not be grateful, but for which the\r\nauthor certainly is so, seeing that, had it never occurred to Chichikov,\r\nthis story would never have seen the light.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing himself, according to the Russian custom, Chichikov set\r\nabout carrying out his enterprise. On pretence of selecting a place\r\nwherein to settle, he started forth to inspect various corners of the\r\nRussian Empire, but more especially those which had suffered from\r\nsuch unfortunate accidents as failures of the harvest, a high rate of\r\nmortality, or whatsoever else might enable him to purchase souls at the\r\nlowest possible rate. But he did not tackle his landowners haphazard: he\r\nrather selected such of them as seemed more particularly suited to his\r\ntaste, or with whom he might with the least possible trouble conclude\r\nidentical agreements; though, in the first instance, he always tried, by\r\ngetting on terms of acquaintanceship--better still, of friendship--with\r\nthem, to acquire the souls for nothing, and so to avoid purchase at all.\r\nIn passing, my readers must not blame me if the characters whom they\r\nhave encountered in these pages have not been altogether to their\r\nliking. The fault is Chichikov\'s rather than mine, for he is the master,\r\nand where he leads we must follow. Also, should my readers gird at me\r\nfor a certain dimness and want of clarity in my principal characters\r\nand actors, that will be tantamount to saying that never do the broad\r\ntendency and the general scope of a work become immediately apparent.\r\nSimilarly does the entry to every town--the entry even to the Capital\r\nitself--convey to the traveller such an impression of vagueness that\r\nat first everything looks grey and monotonous, and the lines of smoky\r\nfactories and workshops seem never to be coming to an end; but in time\r\nthere will begin also to stand out the outlines of six-storied mansions,\r\nand of shops and balconies, and wide perspectives of streets, and a\r\nmedley of steeples, columns, statues, and turrets--the whole framed in\r\nrattle and roar and the infinite wonders which the hand and the brain of\r\nmen have conceived. Of the manner in which Chichikov\'s first purchases\r\nwere made the reader is aware. Subsequently he will see also how the\r\naffair progressed, and with what success or failure our hero met,\r\nand how Chichikov was called upon to decide and to overcome even more\r\ndifficult problems than the foregoing, and by what colossal forces the\r\nlevers of his far-flung tale are moved, and how eventually the horizon\r\nwill become extended until everything assumes a grandiose and a lyrical\r\ntendency. Yes, many a verst of road remains to be travelled by a party\r\nmade up of an elderly gentleman, a britchka of the kind affected by\r\nbachelors, a valet named Petrushka, a coachman named Selifan, and\r\nthree horses which, from the Assessor to the skewbald, are known to us\r\nindividually by name. Again, although I have given a full description of\r\nour hero\'s exterior (such as it is), I may yet be asked for an inclusive\r\ndefinition also of his moral personality. That he is no hero compounded\r\nof virtues and perfections must be already clear. Then WHAT is he? A\r\nvillain? Why should we call him a villain? Why should we be so hard upon\r\na fellow man? In these days our villains have ceased to exist. Rather\r\nit would be fairer to call him an ACQUIRER. The love of acquisition, the\r\nlove of gain, is a fault common to many, and gives rise to many and many\r\na transaction of the kind generally known as "not strictly honourable."\r\nTrue, such a character contains an element of ugliness, and the same\r\nreader who, on his journey through life, would sit at the board of a\r\ncharacter of this kind, and spend a most agreeable time with him, would\r\nbe the first to look at him askance if he should appear in the guise of\r\nthe hero of a novel or a play. But wise is the reader who, on meeting\r\nsuch a character, scans him carefully, and, instead of shrinking from\r\nhim with distaste, probes him to the springs of his being. The human\r\npersonality contains nothing which may not, in the twinkling of an eye,\r\nbecome altogether changed--nothing in which, before you can look round,\r\nthere may not spring to birth some cankerous worm which is destined to\r\nsuck thence the essential juice. Yes, it is a common thing to see not\r\nonly an overmastering passion, but also a passion of the most petty\r\norder, arise in a man who was born to better things, and lead him both\r\nto forget his greatest and most sacred obligations, and to see only in\r\nthe veriest trifles the Great and the Holy. For human passions are as\r\nnumberless as is the sand of the seashore, and go on to become his most\r\ninsistent of masters. Happy, therefore, the man who may choose from\r\namong the gamut of human passions one which is noble! Hour by hour will\r\nthat instinct grow and multiply in its measureless beneficence; hour by\r\nhour will it sink deeper and deeper into the infinite paradise of his\r\nsoul. But there are passions of which a man cannot rid himself, seeing\r\nthat they are born with him at his birth, and he has no power to abjure\r\nthem. Higher powers govern those passions, and in them is something\r\nwhich will call to him, and refuse to be silenced, to the end of his\r\nlife. Yes, whether in a guise of darkness, or whether in a guise which\r\nwill become converted into a light to lighten the world, they will and\r\nmust attain their consummation on life\'s field: and in either case they\r\nhave been evoked for man\'s good. In the same way may the passion\r\nwhich drew our Chichikov onwards have been one that was independent of\r\nhimself; in the same way may there have lurked even in his cold essence\r\nsomething which will one day cause men to humble themselves in the dust\r\nbefore the infinite wisdom of God.\r\n\r\nYet that folk should be dissatisfied with my hero matters nothing. What\r\nmatters is the fact that, under different circumstances, their approval\r\ncould have been taken as a foregone conclusion. That is to say, had not\r\nthe author pried over-deeply into Chichikov\'s soul, nor stirred up in\r\nits depths what shunned and lay hidden from the light, nor disclosed\r\nthose of his hero\'s thoughts which that hero would have not have\r\ndisclosed even to his most intimate friend; had the author, indeed,\r\nexhibited Chichikov just as he exhibited himself to the townsmen of\r\nN. and Manilov and the rest; well, then we may rest assured that every\r\nreader would have been delighted with him, and have voted him a most\r\ninteresting person. For it is not nearly so necessary that Chichikov\r\nshould figure before the reader as though his form and person were\r\nactually present to the eye as that, on concluding a perusal of this\r\nwork, the reader should be able to return, unharrowed in soul, to that\r\ncult of the card-table which is the solace and delight of all good\r\nRussians. Yes, readers of this book, none of you really care to see\r\nhumanity revealed in its nakedness. "Why should we do so?" you say.\r\n"What would be the use of it? Do we not know for ourselves that human\r\nlife contains much that is gross and contemptible? Do we not with our\r\nown eyes have to look upon much that is anything but comforting?\r\nFar better would it be if you would put before us what is comely and\r\nattractive, so that we might forget ourselves a little." In the same\r\nfashion does a landowner say to his bailiff: "Why do you come and tell\r\nme that the affairs of my estate are in a bad way? I know that without\r\nYOUR help. Have you nothing else to tell me? Kindly allow me to forget\r\nthe fact, or else to remain in ignorance of it, and I shall be much\r\nobliged to you." Whereafter the said landowner probably proceeds to\r\nspend on his diversion the money which ought to have gone towards the\r\nrehabilitation of his affairs.\r\n\r\nPossibly the author may also incur censure at the hands of those\r\nso-called "patriots" who sit quietly in corners, and become capitalists\r\nthrough making fortunes at the expense of others. Yes, let but something\r\nwhich they conceive to be derogatory to their country occur--for\r\ninstance, let there be published some book which voices the bitter\r\ntruth--and out they will come from their hiding-places like a spider\r\nwhich perceives a fly to be caught in its web. "Is it well to proclaim\r\nthis to the world, and to set folk talking about it?" they will cry.\r\n"What you have described touches US, is OUR affair. Is conduct of that\r\nkind right? What will foreigners say? Does any one care calmly to sit\r\nby and hear himself traduced? Why should you lead foreigners to suppose\r\nthat all is not well with us, and that we are not patriotic?" Well, to\r\nthese sage remarks no answer can really be returned, especially to such\r\nof the above as refer to foreign opinion. But see here. There once lived\r\nin a remote corner of Russia two natives of the region indicated. One of\r\nthose natives was a good man named Kifa Mokievitch, and a man of kindly\r\ndisposition; a man who went through life in a dressing-gown, and paid no\r\nheed to his household, for the reason that his whole being was centred\r\nupon the province of speculation, and that, in particular, he was\r\npreoccupied with a philosophical problem usually stated by him thus:\r\n"A beast," he would say, "is born naked. Now, why should that be? Why\r\nshould not a beast be born as a bird is born--that is to say, through\r\nthe process of being hatched from an egg? Nature is beyond the\r\nunderstanding, however much one may probe her." This was the substance\r\nof Kifa Mokievitch\'s reflections. But herein is not the chief point.\r\nThe other of the pair was a fellow named Mofi Kifovitch, and son to the\r\nfirst named. He was what we Russians call a "hero," and while his\r\nfather was pondering the parturition of beasts, his, the son\'s, lusty,\r\ntwenty-year-old temperament was violently struggling for development.\r\nYet that son could tackle nothing without some accident occurring. At\r\none moment would he crack some one\'s fingers in half, and at another\r\nwould he raise a bump on somebody\'s nose; so that both at home\r\nand abroad every one and everything--from the serving-maid to the\r\nyard-dog--fled on his approach, and even the bed in his bedroom became\r\nshattered to splinters. Such was Mofi Kifovitch; and with it all he had\r\na kindly soul. But herein is not the chief point. "Good sir, good Kifa\r\nMokievitch," servants and neighbours would come and say to the father,\r\n"what are you going to do about your Moki Kifovitch? We get no rest from\r\nhim, he is so above himself." "That is only his play, that is only his\r\nplay," the father would reply. "What else can you expect? It is too late\r\nnow to start a quarrel with him, and, moreover, every one would accuse\r\nme of harshness. True, he is a little conceited; but, were I to reprove\r\nhim in public, the whole thing would become common talk, and folk would\r\nbegin giving him a dog\'s name. And if they did that, would not their\r\nopinion touch me also, seeing that I am his father? Also, I am busy with\r\nphilosophy, and have no time for such things. Lastly, Moki Kifovitch\r\nis my son, and very dear to my heart." And, beating his breast, Kifa\r\nMokievitch again asserted that, even though his son should elect\r\nto continue his pranks, it would not be for HIM, for the father,\r\nto proclaim the fact, or to fall out with his offspring. And, this\r\nexpression of paternal feeling uttered, Kifa Mokievitch left Moki\r\nKifovitch to his heroic exploits, and himself returned to his beloved\r\nsubject of speculation, which now included also the problem, "Suppose\r\nelephants were to take to being hatched from eggs, would not the\r\nshell of such eggs be of a thickness proof against cannonballs, and\r\nnecessitate the invention of some new type of firearm?" Thus at the end\r\nof this little story we have these two denizens of a peaceful corner of\r\nRussia looking thence, as from a window, in less terror of doing what\r\nwas scandalous than of having it SAID of them that they were acting\r\nscandalously. Yes, the feeling animating our so-called "patriots" is not\r\ntrue patriotism at all. Something else lies beneath it. Who, if not an\r\nauthor, is to speak aloud the truth? Men like you, my pseudo-patriots,\r\nstand in dread of the eye which is able to discern, yet shrink from\r\nusing your own, and prefer, rather, to glance at everything unheedingly.\r\nYes, after laughing heartily over Chichikov\'s misadventures, and perhaps\r\neven commending the author for his dexterity of observation and pretty\r\nturn of wit, you will look at yourselves with redoubled pride and a\r\nself-satisfied smile, and add: "Well, we agree that in certain parts of\r\nthe provinces there exists strange and ridiculous individuals, as well\r\nas unconscionable rascals."\r\n\r\nYet which of you, when quiet, and alone, and engaged in solitary\r\nself-communion, would not do well to probe YOUR OWN souls, and to put\r\nto YOURSELVES the solemn question, "Is there not in ME an element of\r\nChichikov?" For how should there not be? Which of you is not liable at\r\nany moment to be passed in the street by an acquaintance who, nudging\r\nhis neighbour, may say of you, with a barely suppressed sneer: "Look!\r\nthere goes Chichikov! That is Chichikov who has just gone by!"\r\n\r\nBut here are we talking at the top of our voices whilst all the time our\r\nhero lies slumbering in his britchka! Indeed, his name has been repeated\r\nso often during the recital of his life\'s history that he must almost\r\nhave heard us! And at any time he is an irritable, irascible fellow when\r\nspoken of with disrespect. True, to the reader Chichikov\'s displeasure\r\ncannot matter a jot; but for the author it would mean ruin to quarrel\r\nwith his hero, seeing that, arm in arm, Chichikov and he have yet far to\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n"Tut, tut, tut!" came in a shout from Chichikov. "Hi, Selifan!"\r\n\r\n"What is it?" came the reply, uttered with a drawl.\r\n\r\n"What is it? Why, how dare you drive like that? Come! Bestir yourself a\r\nlittle!"\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, Selifan had long been sitting with half-closed eyes, and\r\nhands which bestowed no encouragement upon his somnolent steeds save an\r\noccasional flicking of the reins against their flanks; whilst Petrushka\r\nhad lost his cap, and was leaning backwards until his head had come to\r\nrest against Chichikov\'s knees--a position which necessitated his being\r\nawakened with a cuff. Selifan also roused himself, and apportioned to\r\nthe skewbald a few cuts across the back of a kind which at least had the\r\neffect of inciting that animal to trot; and when, presently, the other\r\ntwo horses followed their companion\'s example, the light britchka moved\r\nforwards like a piece of thistledown. Selifan flourished his whip and\r\nshouted, "Hi, hi!" as the inequalities of the road jerked him vertically\r\non his seat; and meanwhile, reclining against the leather cushions\r\nof the vehicle\'s interior, Chichikov smiled with gratification at the\r\nsensation of driving fast. For what Russian does not love to drive fast?\r\nWhich of us does not at times yearn to give his horses their head, and\r\nto let them go, and to cry, "To the devil with the world!"? At such\r\nmoments a great force seems to uplift one as on wings; and one flies,\r\nand everything else flies, but contrariwise--both the verst stones, and\r\ntraders riding on the shafts of their waggons, and the forest with\r\ndark lines of spruce and fir amid which may be heard the axe of the\r\nwoodcutter and the croaking of the raven. Yes, out of a dim, remote\r\ndistance the road comes towards one, and while nothing save the sky and\r\nthe light clouds through which the moon is cleaving her way seem halted,\r\nthe brief glimpses wherein one can discern nothing clearly have in them\r\na pervading touch of mystery. Ah, troika, troika, swift as a bird, who\r\nwas it first invented you? Only among a hardy race of folk can you have\r\ncome to birth--only in a land which, though poor and rough, lies spread\r\nover half the world, and spans versts the counting whereof would leave\r\none with aching eyes. Nor are you a modishly-fashioned vehicle of the\r\nroad--a thing of clamps and iron. Rather, you are a vehicle but shapen\r\nand fitted with the axe or chisel of some handy peasant of Yaroslav.\r\nNor are you driven by a coachman clothed in German livery, but by a man\r\nbearded and mittened. See him as he mounts, and flourishes his whip, and\r\nbreaks into a long-drawn song! Away like the wind go the horses, and\r\nthe wheels, with their spokes, become transparent circles, and the\r\nroad seems to quiver beneath them, and a pedestrian, with a cry of\r\nastonishment, halts to watch the vehicle as it flies, flies, flies on\r\nits way until it becomes lost on the ultimate horizon--a speck amid a\r\ncloud of dust!\r\n\r\nAnd you, Russia of mine--are not you also speeding like a troika which\r\nnought can overtake? Is not the road smoking beneath your wheels, and\r\nthe bridges thundering as you cross them, and everything being left in\r\nthe rear, and the spectators, struck with the portent, halting to wonder\r\nwhether you be not a thunderbolt launched from heaven? What does that\r\nawe-inspiring progress of yours foretell? What is the unknown force\r\nwhich lies within your mysterious steeds? Surely the winds themselves\r\nmust abide in their manes, and every vein in their bodies be an\r\near stretched to catch the celestial message which bids them, with\r\niron-girded breasts, and hooves which barely touch the earth as\r\nthey gallop, fly forward on a mission of God? Whither, then, are\r\nyou speeding, O Russia of mine? Whither? Answer me! But no answer\r\ncomes--only the weird sound of your collar-bells. Rent into a thousand\r\nshreds, the air roars past you, for you are overtaking the whole world,\r\nand shall one day force all nations, all empires to stand aside, to give\r\nyou way!\r\n\r\n                                                                 1841.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nWhy do I so persistently paint the poverty, the imperfections of Russian\r\nlife, and delve into the remotest depths, the most retired holes and\r\ncorners, of our Empire for my subjects? The answer is that there is\r\nnothing else to be done when an author\'s idiosyncrasy happens to incline\r\nhim that way. So again we find ourselves in a retired spot. But what a\r\nspot!\r\n\r\nImagine, if you can, a mountain range like a gigantic fortress, with\r\nembrasures and bastions which appear to soar a thousand versts towards\r\nthe heights of heaven, and, towering grandly over a boundless expanse\r\nof plain, are broken up into precipitous, overhanging limestone cliffs.\r\nHere and there those cliffs are seamed with water-courses and gullies,\r\nwhile at other points they are rounded off into spurs of green--spurs\r\nnow coated with fleece-like tufts of young undergrowth, now studded with\r\nthe stumps of felled trees, now covered with timber which has, by some\r\nmiracle, escaped the woodman\'s axe. Also, a river winds awhile between\r\nits banks, then leaves the meadow land, divides into runlets (all\r\nflashing in the sun like fire), plunges, re-united, into the midst of a\r\nthicket of elder, birch, and pine, and, lastly, speeds triumphantly past\r\nbridges and mills and weirs which seem to be lying in wait for it at\r\nevery turn.\r\n\r\nAt one particular spot the steep flank of the mountain range is covered\r\nwith billowy verdure of denser growth than the rest; and here the aid of\r\nskilful planting, added to the shelter afforded by a rugged ravine, has\r\nenabled the flora of north and south so to be brought together that,\r\ntwined about with sinuous hop-tendrils, the oak, the spruce fir, the\r\nwild pear, the maple, the cherry, the thorn, and the mountain ash either\r\nassist or check one another\'s growth, and everywhere cover the declivity\r\nwith their straggling profusion. Also, at the edge of the summit there\r\ncan be seen mingling with the green of the trees the red roofs of a\r\nmanorial homestead, while behind the upper stories of the mansion proper\r\nand its carved balcony and a great semi-circular window there gleam the\r\ntiles and gables of some peasants\' huts. Lastly, over this combination\r\nof trees and roofs there rises--overtopping everything with its gilded,\r\nsparkling steeple--an old village church. On each of its pinnacles a\r\ncross of carved gilt is stayed with supports of similar gilding and\r\ndesign; with the result that from a distance the gilded portions\r\nhave the effect of hanging without visible agency in the air. And\r\nthe whole--the three successive tiers of woodland, roofs, and crosses\r\nwhole--lies exquisitely mirrored in the river below, where hollow\r\nwillows, grotesquely shaped (some of them rooted on the river\'s banks,\r\nand some in the water itself, and all drooping their branches until\r\ntheir leaves have formed a tangle with the water lilies which float on\r\nthe surface), seem to be gazing at the marvellous reflection at their\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThus the view from below is beautiful indeed. But the view from above\r\nis even better. No guest, no visitor, could stand on the balcony of the\r\nmansion and remain indifferent. So boundless is the panorama revealed\r\nthat surprise would cause him to catch at his breath, and exclaim: "Lord\r\nof Heaven, but what a prospect!" Beyond meadows studded with spinneys\r\nand water-mills lie forests belted with green; while beyond, again,\r\nthere can be seen showing through the slightly misty air strips of\r\nyellow heath, and, again, wide-rolling forests (as blue as the sea or a\r\ncloud), and more heath, paler than the first, but still yellow. Finally,\r\non the far horizon a range of chalk-topped hills gleams white, even in\r\ndull weather, as though it were lightened with perpetual sunshine;\r\nand here and there on the dazzling whiteness of its lower slopes some\r\nplaster-like, nebulous patches represent far-off villages which lie\r\ntoo remote for the eye to discern their details. Indeed, only when the\r\nsunlight touches a steeple to gold does one realise that each such\r\npatch is a human settlement. Finally, all is wrapped in an immensity of\r\nsilence which even the far, faint echoes of persons singing in the void\r\nof the plain cannot shatter.\r\n\r\nEven after gazing at the spectacle for a couple of hours or so, the\r\nvisitor would still find nothing to say, save: "Lord of Heaven, but\r\nwhat a prospect!" Then who is the dweller in, the proprietor of, this\r\nmanor--a manor to which, as to an impregnable fortress, entrance cannot\r\nbe gained from the side where we have been standing, but only from the\r\nother approach, where a few scattered oaks offer hospitable welcome to\r\nthe visitor, and then, spreading above him their spacious branches (as\r\nin friendly embrace), accompany him to the facade of the mansion whose\r\ntop we have been regarding from the reverse aspect, but which now stands\r\nfrontwise on to us, and has, on one side of it, a row of peasants\' huts\r\nwith red tiles and carved gables, and, on the other, the village church,\r\nwith those glittering golden crosses and gilded open-work charms which\r\nseem to hang suspended in the air? Yes, indeed!--to what fortunate\r\nindividual does this corner of the world belong? It belongs to Andrei\r\nIvanovitch Tientietnikov, landowner of the canton of Tremalakhan, and,\r\nwithal, a bachelor of about thirty.\r\n\r\nShould my lady readers ask of me what manner of man is Tientietnikov,\r\nand what are his attributes and peculiarities, I should refer them\r\nto his neighbours. Of these, a member of the almost extinct tribe\r\nof intelligent staff officers on the retired list once summed up\r\nTientietnikov in the phrase, "He is an absolute blockhead;" while a\r\nGeneral who resided ten versts away was heard to remark that "he is a\r\nyoung man who, though not exactly a fool, has at least too much crowded\r\ninto his head. I myself might have been of use to him, for not only do\r\nI maintain certain connections with St. Petersburg, but also--" And the\r\nGeneral left his sentence unfinished. Thirdly, a captain-superintendent\r\nof rural police happened to remark in the course of conversation:\r\n"To-morrow I must go and see Tientietnikov about his arrears." Lastly,\r\na peasant of Tientietnikov\'s own village, when asked what his barin was\r\nlike, returned no answer at all. All of which would appear to show that\r\nTientietnikov was not exactly looked upon with favour.\r\n\r\nTo speak dispassionately, however, he was not a bad sort of\r\nfellow--merely a star-gazer; and since the world contains many watchers\r\nof the skies, why should Tientietnikov not have been one of them?\r\nHowever, let me describe in detail a specimen day of his existence--one\r\nthat will closely resemble the rest, and then the reader will be enabled\r\nto judge of Tientietnikov\'s character, and how far his life corresponded\r\nto the beauties of nature with which he lived surrounded.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the specimen day in question he awoke very late, and,\r\nraising himself to a sitting posture, rubbed his eyes. And since those\r\neyes were small, the process of rubbing them occupied a very long time,\r\nand throughout its continuance there stood waiting by the door his\r\nvalet, Mikhailo, armed with a towel and basin. For one hour, for two\r\nhours, did poor Mikhailo stand there: then he departed to the kitchen,\r\nand returned to find his master still rubbing his eyes as he sat on the\r\nbed. At length, however, Tientietnikov rose, washed himself, donned a\r\ndressing-gown, and moved into the drawing-room for morning tea, coffee,\r\ncocoa, and warm milk; of all of which he partook but sparingly, while\r\nmunching a piece of bread, and scattering tobacco ash with complete\r\ninsouciance. Two hours did he sit over this meal, then poured himself\r\nout another cup of the rapidly cooling tea, and walked to the window.\r\nThis faced the courtyard, and outside it, as usual, there took place the\r\nfollowing daily altercation between a serf named Grigory (who purported\r\nto act as butler) and the housekeeper, Perfilievna.\r\n\r\nGrigory. Ah, you nuisance, you good-for-nothing, you had better hold\r\nyour stupid tongue.\r\n\r\nPerfilievna. Yes; and don\'t you wish that I would?\r\n\r\nGrigory. What? You so thick with that bailiff of yours, you housekeeping\r\njade!\r\n\r\nPerfilievna. Nay, he is as big a thief as you are. Do you think the\r\nbarin doesn\'t know you? And there he is! He must have heard everything!\r\n\r\nGrigory. Where?\r\n\r\nPerfilievna. There--sitting by the window, and looking at us!\r\n\r\nNext, to complete the hubbub, a serf child which had been clouted by its\r\nmother broke out into a bawl, while a borzoi puppy which had happened\r\nto get splashed with boiling water by the cook fell to yelping\r\nvociferously. In short, the place soon became a babel of shouts and\r\nsqueals, and, after watching and listening for a time, the barin found\r\nit so impossible to concentrate his mind upon anything that he sent out\r\nword that the noise would have to be abated.\r\n\r\nThe next item was that, a couple of hours before luncheon time, he\r\nwithdrew to his study, to set about employing himself upon a weighty\r\nwork which was to consider Russia from every point of view: from the\r\npolitical, from the philosophical, and from the religious, as well as to\r\nresolve various problems which had arisen to confront the Empire, and to\r\ndefine clearly the great future to which the country stood ordained. In\r\nshort, it was to be the species of compilation in which the man of the\r\nday so much delights. Yet the colossal undertaking had progressed but\r\nlittle beyond the sphere of projection, since, after a pen had been\r\ngnawed awhile, and a few strokes had been committed to paper, the whole\r\nwould be laid aside in favour of the reading of some book; and that\r\nreading would continue also during luncheon and be followed by the\r\nlighting of a pipe, the playing of a solitary game of chess, and the\r\ndoing of more or less nothing for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing will give the reader a pretty clear idea of the manner in\r\nwhich it was possible for this man of thirty-three to waste his time.\r\nClad constantly in slippers and a dressing-gown, Tientietnikov never\r\nwent out, never indulged in any form of dissipation, and never walked\r\nupstairs. Nothing did he care for fresh air, and would bestow not a\r\npassing glance upon all those beauties of the countryside which moved\r\nvisitors to such ecstatic admiration. From this the reader will see that\r\nAndrei Ivanovitch Tientietnikov belonged to that band of sluggards whom\r\nwe always have with us, and who, whatever be their present appellation,\r\nused to be known by the nicknames of "lollopers," "bed pressers," and\r\n"marmots." Whether the type is a type originating at birth, or a type\r\nresulting from untoward circumstances in later life, it is impossible to\r\nsay. A better course than to attempt to answer that question would be to\r\nrecount the story of Tientietnikov\'s boyhood and upbringing.\r\n\r\nEverything connected with the latter seemed to promise success, for at\r\ntwelve years of age the boy--keen-witted, but dreamy of temperament, and\r\ninclined to delicacy--was sent to an educational establishment presided\r\nover by an exceptional type of master. The idol of his pupils, and the\r\nadmiration of his assistants, Alexander Petrovitch was gifted with\r\nan extraordinary measure of good sense. How thoroughly he knew the\r\npeculiarities of the Russian of his day! How well he understood boys!\r\nHow capable he was of drawing them out! Not a practical joker in the\r\nschool but, after perpetrating a prank, would voluntarily approach his\r\npreceptor and make to him free confession. True, the preceptor would\r\nput a stern face upon the matter, yet the culprit would depart with head\r\nheld higher, not lower, than before, since in Alexander Petrovitch\r\nthere was something which heartened--something which seemed to say to a\r\ndelinquent: "Forward you! Rise to your feet again, even though you have\r\nfallen!" Not lectures on good behaviour was it, therefore, that fell\r\nfrom his lips, but rather the injunction, "I want to see intelligence,\r\nand nothing else. The boy who devotes his attention to becoming clever\r\nwill never play the fool, for under such circumstances, folly disappears\r\nof itself." And so folly did, for the boy who failed to strive in the\r\ndesired direction incurred the contempt of all his comrades, and even\r\ndunces and fools of senior standing did not dare to raise a finger when\r\nsaluted by their juniors with opprobrious epithets. Yet "This is too\r\nmuch," certain folk would say to Alexander. "The result will be that\r\nyour students will turn out prigs." "But no," he would reply. "Not at\r\nall. You see, I make it my principle to keep the incapables for a single\r\nterm only, since that is enough for them; but to the clever ones I allot\r\na double course of instruction." And, true enough, any lad of brains was\r\nretained for this finishing course. Yet he did not repress all boyish\r\nplayfulness, since he declared it to be as necessary as a rash to a\r\ndoctor, inasmuch as it enabled him to diagnose what lay hidden within.\r\n\r\nConsequently, how the boys loved him! Never was there such an attachment\r\nbetween master and pupils. And even later, during the foolish years,\r\nwhen foolish things attract, the measure of affection which Alexander\r\nPetrovitch retained was extraordinary. In fact, to the day of his death,\r\nevery former pupil would celebrate the birthday of his late master by\r\nraising his glass in gratitude to the mentor dead and buried--then close\r\nhis eyelids upon the tears which would come trickling through them.\r\nEven the slightest word of encouragement from Alexander Petrovitch could\r\nthrow a lad into a transport of tremulous joy, and arouse in him an\r\nhonourable emulation of his fellows. Boys of small capacity he did\r\nnot long retain in his establishment; whereas those who possessed\r\nexceptional talent he put through an extra course of schooling. This\r\nsenior class--a class composed of specially-selected pupils--was a very\r\ndifferent affair from what usually obtains in other colleges. Only when\r\na boy had attained its ranks did Alexander demand of him what other\r\nmasters indiscreetly require of mere infants--namely the superior\r\nframe of mind which, while never indulging in mockery, can itself bear\r\nridicule, and disregard the fool, and keep its temper, and repress\r\nitself, and eschew revenge, and calmly, proudly retain its tranquillity\r\nof soul. In short, whatever avails to form a boy into a man of assured\r\ncharacter, that did Alexander Petrovitch employ during the pupil\'s\r\nyouth, as well as constantly put him to the test. How well he understood\r\nthe art of life!\r\n\r\nOf assistant tutors he kept but few, since most of the necessary\r\ninstruction he imparted in person, and, without pedantic terminology\r\nand inflated diction and views, could so transmit to his listeners the\r\ninmost spirit of a lesson that even the youngest present absorbed its\r\nessential elements. Also, of studies he selected none but those which\r\nmay help a boy to become a good citizen; and therefore most of the\r\nlectures which he delivered consisted of discourses on what may be\r\nawaiting a youth, as well as of such demarcations of life\'s field that\r\nthe pupil, though seated, as yet, only at the desk, could beforehand\r\nbear his part in that field both in thought and spirit. Nor did the\r\nmaster CONCEAL anything. That is to say, without mincing words, he\r\ninvariably set before his hearers the sorrows and the difficulties which\r\nmay confront a man, the trials and the temptations which may beset\r\nhim. And this he did in terms as though, in every possible calling and\r\ncapacity, he himself had experienced the same. Consequently, either the\r\nvigorous development of self-respect or the constant stimulus of the\r\nmaster\'s eye (which seemed to say to the pupil, "Forward!"--that word\r\nwhich has become so familiar to the contemporary Russian, that word\r\nwhich has worked such wonders upon his sensitive temperament); one or\r\nthe other, I repeat, would from the first cause the pupil to tackle\r\ndifficulties, and only difficulties, and to hunger for prowess only\r\nwhere the path was arduous, and obstacles were many, and it was\r\nnecessary to display the utmost strength of mind. Indeed, few completed\r\nthe course of which I have spoken without issuing therefrom reliable,\r\nseasoned fighters who could keep their heads in the most embarrassing\r\nof official positions, and at times when older and wiser men, distracted\r\nwith the annoyances of life, had either abandoned everything or, grown\r\nslack and indifferent, had surrendered to the bribe-takers and the\r\nrascals. In short, no ex-pupil of Alexander Petrovitch ever wavered from\r\nthe right road, but, familiar with life and with men, armed with the\r\nweapons of prudence, exerted a powerful influence upon wrongdoers.\r\n\r\nFor a long time past the ardent young Tientietnikov\'s excitable heart\r\nhad also beat at the thought that one day he might attain the senior\r\nclass described. And, indeed, what better teacher could he have had\r\nbefall him than its preceptor? Yet just at the moment when he had been\r\ntransferred thereto, just at the moment when he had reached the coveted\r\nposition, did his instructor come suddenly by his death! This was\r\nindeed a blow for the boy--indeed a terrible initial loss! In his eyes\r\neverything connected with the school seemed to undergo a change--the\r\nchief reason being the fact that to the place of the deceased headmaster\r\nthere succeeded a certain Thedor Ivanovitch, who at once began to\r\ninsist upon certain external rules, and to demand of the boys what ought\r\nrightly to have been demanded only of adults. That is to say, since\r\nthe lads\' frank and open demeanour savoured to him only of lack\r\nof discipline, he announced (as though in deliberate spite of his\r\npredecessor) that he cared nothing for progress and intellect, but that\r\nheed was to be paid only to good behaviour. Yet, curiously enough, good\r\nbehaviour was just what he never obtained, for every kind of secret\r\nprank became the rule; and while, by day, there reigned restraint\r\nand conspiracy, by night there began to take place chambering and\r\nwantonness.\r\n\r\nAlso, certain changes in the curriculum of studies came about, for there\r\nwere engaged new teachers who held new views and opinions, and confused\r\ntheir hearers with a multitude of new terms and phrases, and displayed\r\nin their exposition of things both logical sequence and a zest\r\nfor modern discovery and much warmth of individual bias. Yet their\r\ninstruction, alas! contained no LIFE--in the mouths of those teachers a\r\ndead language savoured merely of carrion. Thus everything connected with\r\nthe school underwent a radical alteration, and respect for authority\r\nand the authorities waned, and tutors and ushers came to be dubbed "Old\r\nThedor," "Crusty," and the like. And sundry other things began to take\r\nplace--things which necessitated many a penalty and expulsion; until,\r\nwithin a couple of years, no one who had known the school in former days\r\nwould now have recognised it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Tientietnikov, a youth of retiring disposition, experienced\r\nno leanings towards the nocturnal orgies of his companions, orgies\r\nduring which the latter used to flirt with damsels before the very\r\nwindows of the headmaster\'s rooms, nor yet towards their mockery of\r\nall that was sacred, simply because fate had cast in their way an\r\ninjudicious priest. No, despite its dreaminess, his soul ever remembered\r\nits celestial origin, and could not be diverted from the path of virtue.\r\nYet still he hung his head, for, while his ambition had come to life,\r\nit could find no sort of outlet. Truly \'twere well if it had NOT come\r\nto life, for throughout the time that he was listening to professors\r\nwho gesticulated on their chairs he could not help remembering the\r\nold preceptor who, invariably cool and calm, had yet known how to make\r\nhimself understood. To what subjects, to what lectures, did the boy not\r\nhave to listen!--to lectures on medicine, and on philosophy, and on law,\r\nand on a version of general history so enlarged that even three years\r\nfailed to enable the professor to do more than finish the introduction\r\nthereto, and also the account of the development of some self-governing\r\ntowns in Germany. None of the stuff remained fixed in Tientietnikov\'s\r\nbrain save as shapeless clots; for though his native intellect could not\r\ntell him how instruction ought to be imparted, it at least told him that\r\nTHIS was not the way. And frequently, at such moments he would recall\r\nAlexander Petrovitch, and give way to such grief that scarcely did he\r\nknow what he was doing.\r\n\r\nBut youth is fortunate in the fact that always before it there lies a\r\nfuture; and in proportion as the time for his leaving school drew nigh,\r\nTientietnikov\'s heart began to beat higher and higher, and he said to\r\nhimself: "This is not life, but only a preparation for life. True life\r\nis to be found in the Public Service. There at least will there be scope\r\nfor activity." So, bestowing not a glance upon that beautiful corner of\r\nthe world which never failed to strike the guest or chance visitor with\r\namazement, and reverencing not a whit the dust of his ancestors, he\r\nfollowed the example of most ambitious men of his class by repairing to\r\nSt. Petersburg (whither, as we know, the more spirited youth of Russia\r\nfrom every quarter gravitates--there to enter the Public Service, to\r\nshine, to obtain promotion, and, in a word, to scale the topmost peaks\r\nof that pale, cold, deceptive elevation which is known as society). But\r\nthe real starting-point of Tientietnikov\'s ambition was the moment when\r\nhis uncle (one State Councillor Onifri Ivanovitch) instilled into him\r\nthe maxim that the only means to success in the Service lay in good\r\nhandwriting, and that, without that accomplishment, no one could ever\r\nhope to become a Minister or Statesman. Thus, with great difficulty,\r\nand also with the help of his uncle\'s influence, young Tientietnikov at\r\nlength succeeded in being posted to a Department. On the day that he\r\nwas conducted into a splendid, shining hall--a hall fitted with inlaid\r\nfloors and lacquered desks as fine as though this were actually the\r\nplace where the great ones of the Empire met for discussion of the\r\nfortunes of the State; on the day that he saw legions of handsome\r\ngentlemen of the quill-driving profession making loud scratchings with\r\npens, and cocking their heads to one side; lastly on the day that he\r\nsaw himself also allotted a desk, and requested to copy a document which\r\nappeared purposely to be one of the pettiest possible order (as a matter\r\nof fact it related to a sum of three roubles, and had taken half a\r\nyear to produce)--well, at that moment a curious, an unwonted sensation\r\nseized upon the inexperienced youth, for the gentlemen around him\r\nappeared so exactly like a lot of college students. And, the further to\r\ncomplete the resemblance, some of them were engaged in reading trashy\r\ntranslated novels, which they kept hurriedly thrusting between the\r\nsheets of their apportioned work whenever the Director appeared, as\r\nthough to convey the impression that it was to that work alone that they\r\nwere applying themselves. In short, the scene seemed to Tientietnikov\r\nstrange, and his former pursuits more important than his present, and\r\nhis preparation for the Service preferable to the Service itself. Yes,\r\nsuddenly he felt a longing for his old school; and as suddenly, and with\r\nall the vividness of life, there appeared before his vision the figure\r\nof Alexander Petrovitch. He almost burst into tears as he beheld his old\r\nmaster, and the room seemed to swim before his eyes, and the tchinovniks\r\nand the desks to become a blur, and his sight to grow dim. Then he\r\nthought to himself with an effort: "No, no! I WILL apply myself to\r\nmy work, however petty it be at first." And hardening his heart and\r\nrecovering his spirit, he determined then and there to perform his\r\nduties in such a manner as should be an example to the rest.\r\n\r\nBut where are compensations to be found? Even in St. Petersburg, despite\r\nits grim and murky exterior, they exist. Yes, even though thirty degrees\r\nof keen, cracking frost may have bound the streets, and the family of\r\nthe North Wind be wailing there, and the Snowstorm Witch have heaped\r\nhigh the pavements, and be blinding the eyes, and powdering beards and\r\nfur collars and the shaggy manes of horses--even THEN there will be\r\nshining hospitably through the swirling snowflakes a fourth-floor window\r\nwhere, in a cosy room, and by the light of modest candles, and to the\r\nhiss of the samovar, there will be in progress a discussion which warms\r\nthe heart and soul, or else a reading aloud of a brilliant page of one\r\nof those inspired Russian poets with whom God has dowered us, while the\r\nbreast of each member of the company is heaving with a rapture unknown\r\nunder a noontide sky.\r\n\r\nGradually, therefore, Tientietnikov grew more at home in the Service.\r\nYet never did it become, for him, the main pursuit, the main object\r\nin life, which he had expected. No, it remained but one of a secondary\r\nkind. That is to say, it served merely to divide up his time, and enable\r\nhim the more to value his hours of leisure. Nevertheless, just when his\r\nuncle was beginning to flatter himself that his nephew was destined to\r\nsucceed in the profession, the said nephew elected to ruin his every\r\nhope. Thus it befell. Tientietnikov\'s friends (he had many) included\r\namong their number a couple of fellows of the species known as\r\n"embittered." That is to say, though good-natured souls of that\r\ncuriously restless type which cannot endure injustice, nor anything\r\nwhich it conceives to be such, they were thoroughly unbalanced of\r\nconduct themselves, and, while demanding general agreement with\r\ntheir views, treated those of others with the scantiest of ceremony.\r\nNevertheless these two associates exercised upon Tientietnikov--both\r\nby the fire of their eloquence and by the form of their noble\r\ndissatisfaction with society--a very strong influence; with the result\r\nthat, through arousing in him an innate tendency to nervous resentment,\r\nthey led him also to notice trifles which before had escaped his\r\nattention. An instance of this is seen in the fact that he conceived\r\nagainst Thedor Thedorovitch Lienitsin, Director of one of the\r\nDepartments which was quartered in the splendid range of offices before\r\nmentioned, a dislike which proved the cause of his discerning in the\r\nman a host of hitherto unmarked imperfections. Above all things did\r\nTientietnikov take it into his head that, when conversing with his\r\nsuperiors, Lienitsin became, of the moment, a stick of luscious\r\nsweetmeat, but that, when conversing with his inferiors, he approximated\r\nmore to a vinegar cruet. Certain it is that, like all petty-minded\r\nindividuals, Lienitsin made a note of any one who failed to offer him\r\na greeting on festival days, and that he revenged himself upon any one\r\nwhose visiting-card had not been handed to his butler. Eventually the\r\nyouth\'s aversion almost attained the point of hysteria; until he felt\r\nthat, come what might, he MUST insult the fellow in some fashion. To\r\nthat task he applied himself con amore; and so thoroughly that he met\r\nwith complete success. That is to say, he seized on an occasion to\r\naddress Lienitsin in such fashion that the delinquent received\r\nnotice either to apologise or to leave the Service; and when of these\r\nalternatives he chose the latter his uncle came to him, and made a\r\nterrified appeal. "For God\'s sake remember what you are doing!" he\r\ncried. "To think that, after beginning your career so well, you should\r\nabandon it merely for the reason that you have not fallen in with the\r\nsort of Director whom you prefer! What do you mean by it, what do you\r\nmean by it? Were others to regard things in the same way, the Service\r\nwould find itself without a single individual. Reconsider your\r\nconduct--forego your pride and conceit, and make Lienitsin amends."\r\n\r\n"But, dear Uncle," the nephew replied, "that is not the point. The point\r\nis, not that I should find an apology difficult to offer, seeing that,\r\nsince Lienitsin is my superior, and I ought not to have addressed him as\r\nI did, I am clearly in the wrong. Rather, the point is the following.\r\nTo my charge there has been committed the performance of another kind of\r\nservice. That is to say, I am the owner of three hundred peasant souls,\r\na badly administered estate, and a fool of a bailiff. That being so,\r\nwhereas the State will lose little by having to fill my stool with\r\nanother copyist, it will lose very much by causing three hundred peasant\r\nsouls to fail in the payment of their taxes. As I say (how am I to put\r\nit?), I am a landowner who has preferred to enter the Public Service.\r\nNow, should I employ myself henceforth in conserving, restoring, and\r\nimproving the fortunes of the souls whom God has entrusted to my care,\r\nand thereby provide the State with three hundred law-abiding, sober,\r\nhard-working taxpayers, how will that service of mine rank as inferior\r\nto the service of a department-directing fool like Lienitsin?"\r\n\r\nOn hearing this speech, the State Councillor could only gape, for he\r\nhad not expected Tientietnikov\'s torrent of words. He reflected a few\r\nmoments, and then murmured:\r\n\r\n"Yes, but, but--but how can a man like you retire to rustication in\r\nthe country? What society will you get there? Here one meets at least\r\na general or a prince sometimes; indeed, no matter whom you pass in the\r\nstreet, that person represents gas lamps and European civilisation; but\r\nin the country, no matter what part of it you are in, not a soul is\r\nto be encountered save muzhiks and their women. Why should you go and\r\ncondemn yourself to a state of vegetation like that?"\r\n\r\nNevertheless the uncle\'s expostulations fell upon deaf ears, for already\r\nthe nephew was beginning to think of his estate as a retreat of a type\r\nmore likely to nourish the intellectual faculties and afford the only\r\nprofitable field of activity. After unearthing one or two modern works\r\non agriculture, therefore, he, two weeks later, found himself in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the home where his boyhood had been spent, and\r\napproaching the spot which never failed to enthral the visitor or guest.\r\nAnd in the young man\'s breast there was beginning to palpitate a\r\nnew feeling--in the young man\'s soul there were reawakening old,\r\nlong-concealed impressions; with the result that many a spot which had\r\nlong been faded from his memory now filled him with interest, and the\r\nbeautiful views on the estate found him gazing at them like a newcomer,\r\nand with a beating heart. Yes, as the road wound through a narrow\r\nravine, and became engulfed in a forest where, both above and below, he\r\nsaw three-centuries-old oaks which three men could not have spanned,\r\nand where Siberian firs and elms overtopped even the poplars, and as\r\nhe asked the peasants to tell him to whom the forest belonged, and\r\nthey replied, "To Tientietnikov," and he issued from the forest, and\r\nproceeded on his way through meadows, and past spinneys of elder, and\r\nof old and young willows, and arrived in sight of the distant range of\r\nhills, and, crossing by two different bridges the winding river (which\r\nhe left successively to right and to left of him as he did so), he again\r\nquestioned some peasants concerning the ownership of the meadows and\r\nthe flooded lands, and was again informed that they all belonged to\r\nTientietnikov, and then, ascending a rise, reached a tableland where, on\r\none side, lay ungarnered fields of wheat and rye and barley, and, on the\r\nother, the country already traversed (but which now showed in shortened\r\nperspective), and then plunged into the shade of some forked, umbrageous\r\ntrees which stood scattered over turf and extended to the manor-house\r\nitself, and caught glimpses of the carved huts of the peasants, and of\r\nthe red roofs of the stone manorial outbuildings, and of the glittering\r\npinnacles of the church, and felt his heart beating, and knew, without\r\nbeing told by any one, whither he had at length arrived--well, then the\r\nfeeling which had been growing within his soul burst forth, and he cried\r\nin ecstasy:\r\n\r\n"Why have I been a fool so long? Why, seeing that fate has appointed\r\nme to be ruler of an earthly paradise, did I prefer to bind myself in\r\nservitude as a scribe of lifeless documents? To think that, after I had\r\nbeen nurtured and schooled and stored with all the knowledge necessary\r\nfor the diffusion of good among those under me, and for the improvement\r\nof my domain, and for the fulfilment of the manifold duties of a\r\nlandowner who is at once judge, administrator, and constable of his\r\npeople, I should have entrusted my estate to an ignorant bailiff, and\r\nsought to maintain an absentee guardianship over the affairs of serfs\r\nwhom I have never met, and of whose capabilities and characters I am\r\nyet ignorant! To think that I should have deemed true estate-management\r\ninferior to a documentary, fantastical management of provinces which lie\r\na thousand versts away, and which my foot has never trod, and where I\r\ncould never have effected aught but blunders and irregularities!"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile another spectacle was being prepared for him. On learning\r\nthat the barin was approaching the mansion, the muzhiks collected on\r\nthe verandah in very variety of picturesque dress and tonsure; and when\r\nthese good folk surrounded him, and there arose a resounding shout of\r\n"Here is our Foster Father! He has remembered us!" and, in spite of\r\nthemselves, some of the older men and women began weeping as they\r\nrecalled his grandfather and great-grandfather, he himself could not\r\nrestrain his tears, but reflected: "How much affection! And in return\r\nfor what? In return for my never having come to see them--in return for\r\nmy never having taken the least interest in their affairs!" And then\r\nand there he registered a mental vow to share their every task and\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nSo he applied himself to supervising and administering. He reduced the\r\namount of the barstchina [40], he decreased the number of working-days\r\nfor the owner, and he augmented the sum of the peasants\' leisure-time.\r\nHe also dismissed the fool of a bailiff, and took to bearing a\r\npersonal hand in everything--to being present in the fields, at the\r\nthreshing-floor, at the kilns, at the wharf, at the freighting of barges\r\nand rafts, and at their conveyance down the river: wherefore even the\r\nlazy hands began to look to themselves. But this did not last long. The\r\npeasant is an observant individual, and Tientietnikov\'s muzhiks soon\r\nscented the fact that, though energetic and desirous of doing much, the\r\nbarin had no notion how to do it, nor even how to set about it--that, in\r\nshort, he spoke by the book rather than out of his personal knowledge.\r\nConsequently things resulted, not in master and men failing to\r\nunderstand one another, but in their not singing together, in their not\r\nproducing the very same note.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, it was not long before Tientietnikov noticed that on\r\nthe manorial lands, nothing prospered to the extent that it did on the\r\npeasants\'. The manorial crops were sown in good time, and came up well,\r\nand every one appeared to work his best, so much so that Tientietnikov,\r\nwho supervised the whole, frequently ordered mugs of vodka to be served\r\nout as a reward for the excellence of the labour performed. Yet the rye\r\non the peasants\' land had formed into ear, and the oats had begun to\r\nshoot their grain, and the millet had filled before, on the manorial\r\nlands, the corn had so much as grown to stalk, or the ears had sprouted\r\nin embryo. In short, gradually the barin realised that, in spite of\r\nfavours conferred, the peasants were playing the rogue with him. Next he\r\nresorted to remonstrance, but was met with the reply, "How could we not\r\ndo our best for our barin? You yourself saw how well we laboured at the\r\nploughing and the sowing, for you gave us mugs of vodka for our pains."\r\n\r\n"Then why have things turned out so badly?" the barin persisted.\r\n\r\n"Who can say? It must be that a grub has eaten the crop from below.\r\nBesides, what a summer has it been--never a drop of rain!"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the barin noted that no grub had eaten the PEASANTS\'\r\ncrops, as well as that the rain had fallen in the most curious\r\nfashion--namely, in patches. It had obliged the muzhiks, but had shed a\r\nmere sprinkling for the barin.\r\n\r\nStill more difficult did he find it to deal with the peasant women.\r\nEver and anon they would beg to be excused from work, or start making\r\ncomplaints of the severity of the barstchina. Indeed, they were terrible\r\nfolk! However, Tientietnikov abolished the majority of the tithes of\r\nlinen, hedge fruit, mushrooms, and nuts, and also reduced by one-half\r\nother tasks proper to the women, in the hope that they would devote\r\ntheir spare time to their own domestic concerns--namely, to sewing and\r\nmending, and to making clothes for their husbands, and to increasing\r\nthe area of their kitchen gardens. Yet no such result came about. On the\r\ncontrary, such a pitch did the idleness, the quarrelsomeness, and the\r\nintriguing and caballing of the fair sex attain that their helpmeets\r\nwere for ever coming to the barin with a request that he would rid one\r\nor another of his wife, since she had become a nuisance, and to live\r\nwith her was impossible.\r\n\r\nNext, hardening his heart, the barin attempted severity. But of what\r\navail was severity? The peasant woman remained always the peasant\r\nwoman, and would come and whine that she was sick and ailing, and keep\r\npitifully hugging to herself the mean and filthy rags which she had\r\ndonned for the occasion. And when poor Tientietnikov found himself\r\nunable to say more to her than just, "Get out of my sight, and may the\r\nLord go with you!" the next item in the comedy would be that he would\r\nsee her, even as she was leaving his gates, fall to contending with a\r\nneighbour for, say, the possession of a turnip, and dealing out slaps\r\nin the face such as even a strong, healthy man could scarcely have\r\ncompassed!\r\n\r\nAgain, amongst other things, Tientietnikov conceived the idea of\r\nestablishing a school for his people; but the scheme resulted in a farce\r\nwhich left him in sackcloth and ashes. In the same way he found that,\r\nwhen it came to a question of dispensing justice and of adjusting\r\ndisputes, the host of juridical subtleties with which the professors had\r\nprovided him proved absolutely useless. That is to say, the one party\r\nlied, and the other party lied, and only the devil could have decided\r\nbetween them. Consequently he himself perceived that a knowledge of\r\nmankind would have availed him more than all the legal refinements and\r\nphilosophical maxims in the world could do. He lacked something; and\r\nthough he could not divine what it was, the situation brought about was\r\nthe common one of the barin failing to understand the peasant, and the\r\npeasant failing to understand the barin, and both becoming disaffected.\r\nIn the end, these difficulties so chilled Tientietnikov\'s enthusiasm\r\nthat he took to supervising the labours of the field with greatly\r\ndiminished attention. That is to say, no matter whether the scythes were\r\nsoftly swishing through the grass, or ricks were being built, or rafts\r\nwere being loaded, he would allow his eyes to wander from his men, and\r\nto fall to gazing at, say, a red-billed, red-legged heron which, after\r\nstrutting along the bank of a stream, would have caught a fish in its\r\nbeak, and be holding it awhile, as though in doubt whether to swallow\r\nit. Next he would glance towards the spot where a similar bird, but one\r\nnot yet in possession of a fish, was engaged in watching the doings of\r\nits mate. Lastly, with eyebrows knitted, and face turned to scan the\r\nzenith, he would drink in the smell of the fields, and fall to listening\r\nto the winged population of the air as from earth and sky alike the\r\nmanifold music of winged creatures combined in a single harmonious\r\nchorus. In the rye the quail would be calling, and, in the grass, the\r\ncorncrake, and over them would be wheeling flocks of twittering linnets.\r\nAlso, the jacksnipe would be uttering its croak, and the lark executing\r\nits roulades where it had become lost in the sunshine, and cranes\r\nsending forth their trumpet-like challenge as they deployed towards the\r\nzenith in triangle-shaped flocks. In fact, the neighbourhood would seem\r\nto have become converted into one great concert of melody. O Creator,\r\nhow fair is Thy world where, in remote, rural seclusion, it lies apart\r\nfrom cities and from highways!\r\n\r\nBut soon even this began to pall upon Tientietnikov, and he ceased\r\naltogether to visit his fields, or to do aught but shut himself up\r\nin his rooms, where he refused to receive even the bailiff when that\r\nfunctionary called with his reports. Again, although, until now, he had\r\nto a certain extent associated with a retired colonel of hussars--a man\r\nsaturated with tobacco smoke--and also with a student of pronounced, but\r\nimmature, opinions who culled the bulk of his wisdom from contemporary\r\nnewspapers and pamphlets, he found, as time went on, that these\r\ncompanions proved as tedious as the rest, and came to think their\r\nconversation superficial, and their European method of comporting\r\nthemselves--that is to say, the method of conversing with much slapping\r\nof knees and a great deal of bowing and gesticulation--too direct and\r\nunadorned. So these and every one else he decided to "drop," and carried\r\nthis resolution into effect with a certain amount of rudeness. On the\r\nnext occasion that Varvar Nikolaievitch Vishnepokromov called to indulge\r\nin a free-and-easy symposium on politics, philosophy, literature,\r\nmorals, and the state of financial affairs in England (he was, in all\r\nmatters which admit of superficial discussion, the pleasantest fellow\r\nalive, seeing that he was a typical representative both of the retired\r\nfire-eater and of the school of thought which is now becoming the\r\nrage)--when, I say, this next happened, Tientietnikov merely sent out\r\nto say that he was not at home, and then carefully showed himself at the\r\nwindow. Host and guest exchanged glances, and, while the one muttered\r\nthrough his teeth "The cur!" the other relieved his feelings with a\r\nremark or two on swine. Thus the acquaintance came to an abrupt end, and\r\nfrom that time forth no visitor called at the mansion.\r\n\r\nTientietnikov in no way regretted this, for he could now devote himself\r\nwholly to the projection of a great work on Russia. Of the scale on\r\nwhich this composition was conceived the reader is already aware. The\r\nreader also knows how strange, how unsystematic, was the system employed\r\nin it. Yet to say that Tientietnikov never awoke from his lethargy\r\nwould not be altogether true. On the contrary, when the post brought him\r\nnewspapers and reviews, and he saw in their printed pages, perhaps, the\r\nwell-known name of some former comrade who had succeeded in the great\r\nfield of Public Service, or had conferred upon science and the\r\nworld\'s work some notable contribution, he would succumb to secret and\r\nsuppressed grief, and involuntarily there would burst from his soul\r\nan expression of aching, voiceless regret that he himself had done so\r\nlittle. And at these times his existence would seem to him odious and\r\nrepellent; at these times there would uprise before him the memory of\r\nhis school days, and the figure of Alexander Petrovitch, as vivid as in\r\nlife. And, slowly welling, the tears would course over Tientietnikov\'s\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\nWhat meant these repinings? Was there not disclosed in them the secret\r\nof his galling spiritual pain--the fact that he had failed to order his\r\nlife aright, to confirm the lofty aims with which he had started his\r\ncourse; the fact that, always poorly equipped with experience, he\r\nhad failed to attain the better and the higher state, and there to\r\nstrengthen himself for the overcoming of hindrances and obstacles; the\r\nfact that, dissolving like overheated metal, his bounteous store of\r\nsuperior instincts had failed to take the final tempering; the fact that\r\nthe tutor of his boyhood, a man in a thousand, had prematurely died, and\r\nleft to Tientietnikov no one who could restore to him the moral\r\nstrength shattered by vacillation and the will power weakened by want\r\nof virility--no one, in short, who could cry hearteningly to his soul\r\n"Forward!"--the word for which the Russian of every degree, of every\r\nclass, of every occupation, of every school of thought, is for ever\r\nhungering.\r\n\r\nIndeed, WHERE is the man who can cry aloud for any of us, in the Russian\r\ntongue dear to our soul, the all-compelling command "Forward!"? Who is\r\nthere who, knowing the strength and the nature and the inmost depths of\r\nthe Russian genius, can by a single magic incantation divert our ideals\r\nto the higher life? Were there such a man, with what tears, with what\r\naffection, would not the grateful sons of Russia repay him! Yet age\r\nsucceeds to age, and our callow youth still lies wrapped in shameful\r\nsloth, or strives and struggles to no purpose. God has not yet given us\r\nthe man able to sound the call.\r\n\r\nOne circumstance which almost aroused Tientietnikov, which almost\r\nbrought about a revolution in his character, was the fact that he came\r\nvery near to falling in love. Yet even this resulted in nothing. Ten\r\nversts away there lived the general whom we have heard expressing\r\nhimself in highly uncomplimentary terms concerning Tientietnikov. He\r\nmaintained a General-like establishment, dispensed hospitality (that\r\nis to say, was glad when his neighbours came to pay him their respects,\r\nthough he himself never went out), spoke always in a hoarse voice, read\r\na certain number of books, and had a daughter--a curious, unfamiliar\r\ntype, but full of life as life itself. This maiden\'s name was Ulinka,\r\nand she had been strangely brought up, for, losing her mother in early\r\nchildhood, she had subsequently received instruction at the hands of an\r\nEnglish governess who knew not a single word of Russian. Moreover her\r\nfather, though excessively fond of her, treated her always as a toy;\r\nwith the result that, as she grew to years of discretion, she became\r\nwholly wayward and spoilt. Indeed, had any one seen the sudden rage\r\nwhich would gather on her beautiful young forehead when she was engaged\r\nin a heated dispute with her father, he would have thought her one of\r\nthe most capricious beings in the world. Yet that rage gathered only\r\nwhen she had heard of injustice or harsh treatment, and never because\r\nshe desired to argue on her own behalf, or to attempt to justify her own\r\nconduct. Also, that anger would disappear as soon as ever she saw any\r\none whom she had formerly disliked fall upon evil times, and, at his\r\nfirst request for alms would, without consideration or subsequent\r\nregret, hand him her purse and its whole contents. Yes, her every act\r\nwas strenuous, and when she spoke her whole personality seemed to be\r\nfollowing hot-foot upon her thought--both her expression of face and her\r\ndiction and the movements of her hands. Nay, the very folds of her frock\r\nhad a similar appearance of striving; until one would have thought\r\nthat all her self were flying in pursuit of her words. Nor did she know\r\nreticence: before any one she would disclose her mind, and no force\r\ncould compel her to maintain silence when she desired to speak. Also,\r\nher enchanting, peculiar gait--a gait which belonged to her alone--was\r\nso absolutely free and unfettered that every one involuntarily gave her\r\nway. Lastly, in her presence churls seemed to become confused and fall\r\nto silence, and even the roughest and most outspoken would lose their\r\nheads, and have not a word to say; whereas the shy man would find\r\nhimself able to converse as never in his life before, and would feel,\r\nfrom the first, as though he had seen her and known her at some previous\r\nperiod--during the days of some unremembered childhood, when he was at\r\nhome, and spending a merry evening among a crowd of romping children.\r\nAnd for long afterwards he would feel as though his man\'s intellect and\r\nestate were a burden.\r\n\r\nThis was what now befell Tientietnikov; and as it did so a new feeling\r\nentered into his soul, and his dreamy life lightened for a moment.\r\n\r\nAt first the General used to receive him with hospitable civility, but\r\npermanent concord between them proved impossible; their conversation\r\nalways merged into dissension and soreness, seeing that, while the\r\nGeneral could not bear to be contradicted or worsted in an argument,\r\nTientietnikov was a man of extreme sensitiveness. True, for the\r\ndaughter\'s sake, the father was for a while deferred to, and thus peace\r\nwas maintained; but this lasted only until the time when there arrived,\r\non a visit to the General, two kinswomen of his--the Countess Bordirev\r\nand the Princess Uziakin, retired Court dames, but ladies who still\r\nkept up a certain connection with Court circles, and therefore were much\r\nfawned upon by their host. No sooner had they appeared on the scene than\r\n(so it seemed to Tientietnikov) the General\'s attitude towards the young\r\nman became colder--either he ceased to notice him at all or he spoke to\r\nhim familiarly, and as to a person having no standing in society. This\r\noffended Tientietnikov deeply, and though, when at length he spoke out\r\non the subject, he retained sufficient presence of mind to compress his\r\nlips, and to preserve a gentle and courteous tone, his face flushed and\r\nhis inner man was boiling.\r\n\r\n"General," he said, "I thank you for your condescension. By addressing\r\nme in the second person singular, you have admitted me to the circle\r\nof your most intimate friends. Indeed, were it not that a difference of\r\nyears forbids any familiarity on my part, I should answer you in similar\r\nfashion."\r\n\r\nThe General sat aghast. At length, rallying his tongue and his\r\nfaculties, he replied that, though he had spoken with a lack of\r\nceremony, he had used the term "thou" merely as an elderly man naturally\r\nemploys it towards a junior (he made no reference to difference of\r\nrank).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the acquaintance broke off here, and with it any\r\npossibility of love-making. The light which had shed a momentary gleam\r\nbefore Tientietnikov\'s eyes had become extinguished for ever, and upon\r\nit there followed a darkness denser than before. Henceforth everything\r\nconduced to evolve the regime which the reader has noted--that regime\r\nof sloth and inaction which converted Tientietnikov\'s residence into a\r\nplace of dirt and neglect. For days at a time would a broom and a heap\r\nof dust be left lying in the middle of a room, and trousers tossing\r\nabout the salon, and pairs of worn-out braces adorning the what-not near\r\nthe sofa. In short, so mean and untidy did Tientietnikov\'s mode of life\r\nbecome, that not only his servants, but even his very poultry ceased to\r\ntreat him with respect. Taking up a pen, he would spend hours in idly\r\nsketching houses, huts, waggons, troikas, and flourishes on a piece of\r\npaper; while at other times, when he had sunk into a reverie, the pen\r\nwould, all unknowingly, sketch a small head which had delicate features,\r\na pair of quick, penetrating eyes, and a raised coiffure. Then suddenly\r\nthe dreamer would perceive, to his surprise, that the pen had executed\r\nthe portrait of a maiden whose picture no artist could adequately have\r\npainted; and therewith his despondency would become greater than ever,\r\nand, believing that happiness did not exist on earth, he would relapse\r\ninto increased ennui, increased neglect of his responsibilities.\r\n\r\nBut one morning he noticed, on moving to the window after breakfast,\r\nthat not a word was proceeding either from the butler or the\r\nhousekeeper, but that, on the contrary, the courtyard seemed to smack of\r\na certain bustle and excitement. This was because through the entrance\r\ngates (which the kitchen maid and the scullion had run to open) there\r\nwere appearing the noses of three horses--one to the right, one in the\r\nmiddle, and one to the left, after the fashion of triumphal groups of\r\nstatuary. Above them, on the box seat, were seated a coachman and a\r\nvalet, while behind, again, there could be discerned a gentleman in a\r\nscarf and a fur cap. Only when the equipage had entered the courtyard\r\ndid it stand revealed as a light spring britchka. And as it came to a\r\nhalt, there leapt on to the verandah of the mansion an individual\r\nof respectable exterior, and possessed of the art of moving with the\r\nneatness and alertness of a military man.\r\n\r\nUpon this Tientietnikov\'s heart stood still. He was unused to receiving\r\nvisitors, and for the moment conceived the new arrival to be a\r\nGovernment official, sent to question him concerning an abortive society\r\nto which he had formerly belonged. (Here the author may interpolate the\r\nfact that, in Tientietnikov\'s early days, the young man had become mixed\r\nup in a very absurd affair. That is to say, a couple of philosophers\r\nbelonging to a regiment of hussars had, together with an aesthete\r\nwho had not yet completed his student\'s course and a gambler who had\r\nsquandered his all, formed a secret society of philanthropic aims under\r\nthe presidency of a certain old rascal of a freemason and the ruined\r\ngambler aforesaid. The scope of the society\'s work was to be extensive:\r\nit was to bring lasting happiness to humanity at large, from the banks\r\nof the Thames to the shores of Kamtchatka. But for this much money was\r\nneeded: wherefore from the noble-minded members of the society generous\r\ncontributions were demanded, and then forwarded to a destination known\r\nonly to the supreme authorities of the concern. As for Tientietnikov\'s\r\nadhesion, it was brought about by the two friends already alluded to as\r\n"embittered"--good-hearted souls whom the wear and tear of their efforts\r\non behalf of science, civilisation, and the future emancipation of\r\nmankind had ended by converting into confirmed drunkards. Perhaps it\r\nneed hardly be said that Tientietnikov soon discovered how things stood,\r\nand withdrew from the association; but, meanwhile, the latter had had\r\nthe misfortune so to have engaged in dealings not wholly creditable\r\nto gentlemen of noble origin as likewise to have become entangled in\r\ndealings with the police. Consequently, it is not to be wondered at\r\nthat, though Tientietnikov had long severed his connection with the\r\nsociety and its policy, he still remained uneasy in his mind as to what\r\nmight even yet be the result.)\r\n\r\nHowever, his fears vanished the instant that the guest saluted him with\r\nmarked politeness and explained, with many deferential poises of the\r\nhead, and in terms at once civil and concise, that for some time past\r\nhe (the newcomer) had been touring the Russian Empire on business and\r\nin the pursuit of knowledge, that the Empire abounded in objects\r\nof interest--not to mention a plenitude of manufactures and a great\r\ndiversity of soil, and that, in spite of the fact that he was greatly\r\nstruck with the amenities of his host\'s domain, he would certainly\r\nnot have presumed to intrude at such an inconvenient hour but for the\r\ncircumstance that the inclement spring weather, added to the state of\r\nthe roads, had necessitated sundry repairs to his carriage at the hands\r\nof wheelwrights and blacksmiths. Finally he declared that, even if this\r\nlast had NOT happened, he would still have felt unable to deny himself\r\nthe pleasure of offering to his host that meed of homage which was the\r\nlatter\'s due.\r\n\r\nThis speech--a speech of fascinating bonhomie--delivered, the guest\r\nexecuted a sort of shuffle with a half-boot of patent leather studded\r\nwith buttons of mother-of-pearl, and followed that up by (in spite of\r\nhis pronounced rotundity of figure) stepping backwards with all the elan\r\nof an india-rubber ball.\r\n\r\nFrom this the somewhat reassured Tientietnikov concluded that his\r\nvisitor must be a literary, knowledge-seeking professor who was engaged\r\nin roaming the country in search of botanical specimens and fossils;\r\nwherefore he hastened to express both his readiness to further the\r\nvisitor\'s objects (whatever they might be) and his personal willingness\r\nto provide him with the requisite wheelwrights and blacksmiths.\r\nMeanwhile he begged his guest to consider himself at home, and,\r\nafter seating him in an armchair, made preparations to listen to the\r\nnewcomer\'s discourse on natural history.\r\n\r\nBut the newcomer applied himself, rather, to phenomena of the internal\r\nworld, saying that his life might be likened to a barque tossed on the\r\ncrests of perfidious billows, that in his time he had been fated to play\r\nmany parts, and that on more than one occasion his life had stood\r\nin danger at the hands of foes. At the same time, these tidings were\r\ncommunicated in a manner calculated to show that the speaker was also\r\na man of PRACTICAL capabilities. In conclusion, the visitor took out a\r\ncambric pocket-handkerchief, and sneezed into it with a vehemence wholly\r\nnew to Tientietnikov\'s experience. In fact, the sneeze rather resembled\r\nthe note which, at times, the trombone of an orchestra appears to utter\r\nnot so much from its proper place on the platform as from the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the listener\'s ear. And as the echoes of the drowsy\r\nmansion resounded to the report of the explosion there followed upon the\r\nsame a wave of perfume, skilfully wafted abroad with a flourish of the\r\neau-de-Cologne-scented handkerchief.\r\n\r\nBy this time the reader will have guessed that the visitor was none\r\nother than our old and respected friend Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov.\r\nNaturally, time had not spared him his share of anxieties and alarms;\r\nwherefore his exterior had come to look a trifle more elderly, his\r\nfrockcoat had taken on a suggestion of shabbiness, and britchka,\r\ncoachman, valet, horses, and harness alike had about them a sort of\r\nsecond-hand, worse-for-wear effect. Evidently the Chichikovian finances\r\nwere not in the most flourishing of conditions. Nevertheless, the old\r\nexpression of face, the old air of breeding and refinement, remained\r\nunimpaired, and our hero had even improved in the art of walking and\r\nturning with grace, and of dexterously crossing one leg over the\r\nother when taking a seat. Also, his mildness of diction, his discreet\r\nmoderation of word and phrase, survived in, if anything, increased\r\nmeasure, and he bore himself with a skill which caused his tactfulness\r\nto surpass itself in sureness of aplomb. And all these accomplishments\r\nhad their effect further heightened by a snowy immaculateness of collar\r\nand dickey, and an absence of dust from his frockcoat, as complete as\r\nthough he had just arrived to attend a nameday festival. Lastly, his\r\ncheeks and chin were of such neat clean-shavenness that no one but a\r\nblind man could have failed to admire their rounded contours.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment onwards great changes took place in Tientietnikov\'s\r\nestablishment, and certain of its rooms assumed an unwonted air of\r\ncleanliness and order. The rooms in question were those assigned to\r\nChichikov, while one other apartment--a little front chamber opening\r\ninto the hall--became permeated with Petrushka\'s own peculiar smell.\r\nBut this lasted only for a little while, for presently Petrushka was\r\ntransferred to the servants\' quarters, a course which ought to have been\r\nadopted in the first instance.\r\n\r\nDuring the initial days of Chichikov\'s sojourn, Tientietnikov feared\r\nrather to lose his independence, inasmuch as he thought that his\r\nguest might hamper his movements, and bring about alterations in the\r\nestablished routine of the place. But these fears proved groundless, for\r\nPaul Ivanovitch displayed an extraordinary aptitude for accommodating\r\nhimself to his new position. To begin with, he encouraged his host\r\nin his philosophical inertia by saying that the latter would help\r\nTientietnikov to become a centenarian. Next, in the matter of a life of\r\nisolation, he hit things off exactly by remarking that such a life\r\nbred in a man a capacity for high thinking. Lastly, as he inspected the\r\nlibrary and dilated on books in general, he contrived an opportunity to\r\nobserve that literature safeguarded a man from a tendency to waste his\r\ntime. In short, the few words of which he delivered himself were brief,\r\nbut invariably to the point. And this discretion of speech was outdone\r\nby his discretion of conduct. That is to say, whether entering\r\nor leaving the room, he never wearied his host with a question if\r\nTientietnikov had the air of being disinclined to talk; and with equal\r\nsatisfaction the guest could either play chess or hold his tongue.\r\nConsequently Tientietnikov said to himself:\r\n\r\n"For the first time in my life I have met with a man with whom it is\r\npossible to live. In general, not many of the type exist in Russia, and,\r\nthough clever, good-humoured, well-educated men abound, one would be\r\nhard put to it to find an individual of equable temperament with whom\r\none could share a roof for centuries without a quarrel arising. Anyway,\r\nChichikov is the first of his sort that I have met."\r\n\r\nFor his part, Chichikov was only too delighted to reside with a\r\nperson so quiet and agreeable as his host. Of a wandering life he was\r\ntemporarily weary, and to rest, even for a month, in such a beautiful\r\nspot, and in sight of green fields and the slow flowering of spring, was\r\nlikely to benefit him also from the hygienic point of view. And, indeed,\r\na more delightful retreat in which to recuperate could not possibly have\r\nbeen found. The spring, long retarded by previous cold, had now begun\r\nin all its comeliness, and life was rampant. Already, over the first\r\nemerald of the grass, the dandelion was showing yellow, and the red-pink\r\nanemone was hanging its tender head; while the surface of every pond\r\nwas a swarm of dancing gnats and midges, and the water-spider was being\r\njoined in their pursuit by birds which gathered from every quarter to\r\nthe vantage-ground of the dry reeds. Every species of creature also\r\nseemed to be assembling in concourse, and taking stock of one another.\r\nSuddenly the earth became populous, the forest had opened its eyes, and\r\nthe meadows were lifting up their voice in song. In the same way had\r\nchoral dances begun to be weaved in the village, and everywhere that the\r\neye turned there was merriment. What brightness in the green of nature,\r\nwhat freshness in the air, what singing of birds in the gardens of the\r\nmansion, what general joy and rapture and exaltation! Particularly in\r\nthe village might the shouting and singing have been in honour of a\r\nwedding!\r\n\r\nChichikov walked hither, thither, and everywhere--a pursuit for which\r\nthere was ample choice and facility. At one time he would direct his\r\nsteps along the edge of the flat tableland, and contemplate the depths\r\nbelow, where still there lay sheets of water left by the floods of\r\nwinter, and where the island-like patches of forest showed leafless\r\nboughs; while at another time he would plunge into the thicket and\r\nravine country, where nests of birds weighted branches almost to the\r\nground, and the sky was darkened with the criss-cross flight of cawing\r\nrooks. Again, the drier portions of the meadows could be crossed to the\r\nriver wharves, whence the first barges were just beginning to set forth\r\nwith pea-meal and barley and wheat, while at the same time one\'s ear\r\nwould be caught with the sound of some mill resuming its functions as\r\nonce more the water turned the wheel. Chichikov would also walk afield\r\nto watch the early tillage operations of the season, and observe how\r\nthe blackness of a new furrow would make its way across the expanse of\r\ngreen, and how the sower, rhythmically striking his hand against the\r\npannier slung across his breast, would scatter his fistfuls of seed with\r\nequal distribution, apportioning not a grain too much to one side or to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Chichikov went everywhere. He chatted and talked, now with the\r\nbailiff, now with a peasant, now with a miller, and inquired into the\r\nmanner and nature of everything, and sought information as to how an\r\nestate was managed, and at what price corn was selling, and what species\r\nof grain was best for spring and autumn grinding, and what was the name\r\nof each peasant, and who were his kinsfolk, and where he had bought his\r\ncow, and what he fed his pigs on. Chichikov also made inquiry concerning\r\nthe number of peasants who had lately died: but of these there appeared\r\nto be few. And suddenly his quick eye discerned that Tientietnikov\'s\r\nestate was not being worked as it might have been--that much neglect and\r\nlistlessness and pilfering and drunkenness was abroad; and on perceiving\r\nthis, he thought to himself: "What a fool is that Tientietnikov! To\r\nthink of letting a property like this decay when he might be drawing\r\nfrom it an income of fifty thousand roubles a year!"\r\n\r\nAlso, more than once, while taking these walks, our hero pondered the\r\nidea of himself becoming a landowner--not now, of course, but later,\r\nwhen his chief aim should have been achieved, and he had got into his\r\nhands the necessary means for living the quiet life of the proprietor\r\nof an estate. Yes, and at these times there would include itself in his\r\ncastle-building the figure of a young, fresh, fair-faced maiden of the\r\nmercantile or other rich grade of society, a woman who could both play\r\nand sing. He also dreamed of little descendants who should perpetuate\r\nthe name of Chichikov; perhaps a frolicsome little boy and a fair young\r\ndaughter, or possibly, two boys and quite two or three daughters; so\r\nthat all should know that he had really lived and had his being, that he\r\nhad not merely roamed the world like a spectre or a shadow; so that for\r\nhim and his the country should never be put to shame. And from that he\r\nwould go on to fancy that a title appended to his rank would not be\r\na bad thing--the title of State Councillor, for instance, which was\r\ndeserving of all honour and respect. Ah, it is a common thing for a\r\nman who is taking a solitary walk so to detach himself from the irksome\r\nrealities of the present that he is able to stir and to excite and to\r\nprovoke his imagination to the conception of things he knows can never\r\nreally come to pass!\r\n\r\nChichikov\'s servants also found the mansion to their taste, and, like\r\ntheir master, speedily made themselves at home in it. In particular did\r\nPetrushka make friends with Grigory the butler, although at first the\r\npair showed a tendency to outbrag one another--Petrushka beginning\r\nby throwing dust in Grigory\'s eyes on the score of his (Petrushka\'s)\r\ntravels, and Grigory taking him down a peg or two by referring to St.\r\nPetersburg (a city which Petrushka had never visited), and Petrushka\r\nseeking to recover lost ground by dilating on towns which he HAD\r\nvisited, and Grigory capping this by naming some town which is not to be\r\nfound on any map in existence, and then estimating the journey\r\nthither as at least thirty thousand versts--a statement which would so\r\ncompletely flabbergast the henchman of Chichikov\'s suite that he would\r\nbe left staring open-mouthed, amid the general laughter of the domestic\r\nstaff. However, as I say, the pair ended by swearing eternal friendship\r\nwith one another, and making a practice of resorting to the village\r\ntavern in company.\r\n\r\nFor Selifan, however, the place had a charm of a different kind. That is\r\nto say, each evening there would take place in the village a singing of\r\nsongs and a weaving of country dances; and so shapely and buxom were the\r\nmaidens--maidens of a type hard to find in our present-day villages on\r\nlarge estates--that he would stand for hours wondering which of them was\r\nthe best. White-necked and white-bosomed, all had great roving eyes, the\r\ngait of peacocks, and hair reaching to the waist. And as, with his hands\r\nclasping theirs, he glided hither and thither in the dance, or retired\r\nbackwards towards a wall with a row of other young fellows, and then,\r\nwith them, returned to meet the damsels--all singing in chorus (and\r\nlaughing as they sang it), "Boyars, show me my bridegroom!" and dusk was\r\nfalling gently, and from the other side of the river there kept coming\r\nfar, faint, plaintive echoes of the melody--well, then our Selifan\r\nhardly knew whether he were standing upon his head or his heels. Later,\r\nwhen sleeping and when waking, both at noon and at twilight, he would\r\nseem still to be holding a pair of white hands, and moving in the dance.\r\n\r\nChichikov\'s horses also found nothing of which to disapprove. Yes,\r\nboth the bay, the Assessor, and the skewbald accounted residence at\r\nTientietnikov\'s a most comfortable affair, and voted the oats excellent,\r\nand the arrangement of the stables beyond all cavil. True, on this\r\noccasion each horse had a stall to himself; yet, by looking over the\r\nintervening partition, it was possible always to see one\'s fellows, and,\r\nshould a neighbour take it into his head to utter a neigh, to answer it\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nAs for the errand which had hitherto led Chichikov to travel about\r\nRussia, he had now decided to move very cautiously and secretly in the\r\nmatter. In fact, on noticing that Tientietnikov went in absorbedly for\r\nreading and for talking philosophy, the visitor said to himself, "No--I\r\nhad better begin at the other end," and proceeded first to feel his way\r\namong the servants of the establishment. From them he learnt several\r\nthings, and, in particular, that the barin had been wont to go and\r\ncall upon a certain General in the neighbourhood, and that the General\r\npossessed a daughter, and that she and Tientietnikov had had an affair\r\nof some sort, but that the pair had subsequently parted, and gone\r\ntheir several ways. For that matter, Chichikov himself had noticed\r\nthat Tientietnikov was in the habit of drawing heads of which each\r\nrepresentation exactly resembled the rest.\r\n\r\nOnce, as he sat tapping his silver snuff-box after luncheon, Chichikov\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n"One thing you lack, and only one, Andrei Ivanovitch."\r\n\r\n"What is that?" asked his host.\r\n\r\n"A female friend or two," replied Chichikov.\r\n\r\nTientietnikov made no rejoinder, and the conversation came temporarily\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\nBut Chichikov was not to be discouraged; wherefore, while waiting for\r\nsupper and talking on different subjects, he seized an opportunity to\r\ninterject:\r\n\r\n"Do you know, it would do you no harm to marry."\r\n\r\nAs before, Tientietnikov did not reply, and the renewed mention of the\r\nsubject seemed to have annoyed him.\r\n\r\nFor the third time--it was after supper--Chichikov returned to the\r\ncharge by remarking:\r\n\r\n"To-day, as I was walking round your property, I could not help thinking\r\nthat marriage would do you a great deal of good. Otherwise you will\r\ndevelop into a hypochondriac."\r\n\r\nWhether Chichikov\'s words now voiced sufficiently the note of\r\npersuasion, or whether Tientietnikov happened, at the moment, to be\r\nunusually disposed to frankness, at all events the young landowner\r\nsighed, and then responded as he expelled a puff of tobacco smoke:\r\n\r\n"To attain anything, Paul Ivanovitch, one needs to have been born under\r\na lucky star."\r\n\r\nAnd he related to his guest the whole history of his acquaintanceship\r\nand subsequent rupture with the General.\r\n\r\nAs Chichikov listened to the recital, and gradually realised that the\r\naffair had arisen merely out of a chance word on the General\'s part, he\r\nwas astounded beyond measure, and gazed at Tientietnikov without knowing\r\nwhat to make of him.\r\n\r\n"Andrei Ivanovitch," he said at length, "what was there to take offence\r\nat?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, as regards the actual words spoken," replied the other. "The\r\noffence lay, rather, in the insult conveyed in the General\'s tone."\r\nTientietnikov was a kindly and peaceable man, yet his eyes flashed as he\r\nsaid this, and his voice vibrated with wounded feeling.\r\n\r\n"Yet, even then, need you have taken it so much amiss?"\r\n\r\n"What? Could I have gone on visiting him as before?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. No great harm had been done?"\r\n\r\n"I disagree with you. Had he been an old man in a humble station of\r\nlife, instead of a proud and swaggering officer, I should not have\r\nminded so much. But, as it was, I could not, and would not, brook his\r\nwords."\r\n\r\n"A curious fellow, this Tientietnikov!" thought Chichikov to himself.\r\n\r\n"A curious fellow, this Chichikov!" was Tientietnikov\'s inward\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what," resumed Chichikov. "To-morrow I myself will go and\r\nsee the General."\r\n\r\n"To what purpose?" asked Tientietnikov, with astonishment and distrust\r\nin his eyes.\r\n\r\n"To offer him an assurance of my personal respect."\r\n\r\n"A strange fellow, this Chichikov!" reflected Tientietnikov.\r\n\r\n"A strange fellow, this Tientietnikov!" thought Chichikov, and then\r\nadded aloud: "Yes, I will go and see him at ten o\'clock to-morrow; but\r\nsince my britchka is not yet altogether in travelling order, would you\r\nbe so good as to lend me your koliaska for the purpose?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTientietnikov\'s good horses covered the ten versts to the General\'s\r\nhouse in a little over half an hour. Descending from the koliaska with\r\nfeatures attuned to deference, Chichikov inquired for the master of the\r\nhouse, and was at once ushered into his presence. Bowing with head\r\nheld respectfully on one side and hands extended like those of a waiter\r\ncarrying a trayful of teacups, the visitor inclined his whole body\r\nforward, and said:\r\n\r\n"I have deemed it my duty to present myself to your Excellency. I have\r\ndeemed it my duty because in my heart I cherish a most profound respect\r\nfor the valiant men who, on the field of battle, have proved the\r\nsaviours of their country."\r\n\r\nThat this preliminary attack did not wholly displease the General was\r\nproved by the fact that, responding with a gracious inclination of the\r\nhead, he replied:\r\n\r\n"I am glad to make your acquaintance. Pray be so good as to take a seat.\r\nIn what capacity or capacities have you yourself seen service?"\r\n\r\n"Of my service," said Chichikov, depositing his form, not exactly in the\r\ncentre of the chair, but rather on one side of it, and resting a hand\r\nupon one of its arms, "--of my service the scene was laid, in the first\r\ninstance, in the Treasury; while its further course bore me successively\r\ninto the employ of the Public Buildings Commission, of the Customs\r\nBoard, and of other Government Offices. But, throughout, my life has\r\nresembled a barque tossed on the crests of perfidious billows. In\r\nsuffering I have been swathed and wrapped until I have come to be, as\r\nit were, suffering personified; while of the extent to which my life\r\nhas been sought by foes, no words, no colouring, no (if I may so express\r\nit?) painter\'s brush could ever convey to you an adequate idea. And now,\r\nat length, in my declining years, I am seeking a corner in which to eke\r\nout the remainder of my miserable existence, while at the present moment\r\nI am enjoying the hospitality of a neighbour of your acquaintance."\r\n\r\n"And who is that?"\r\n\r\n"Your neighbour Tientietnikov, your Excellency."\r\n\r\nUpon that the General frowned.\r\n\r\n"Led me add," put in Chichikov hastily, "that he greatly regrets that\r\non a former occasion he should have failed to show a proper respect\r\nfor--for--"\r\n\r\n"For what?" asked the General.\r\n\r\n"For the services to the public which your Excellency has rendered.\r\nIndeed, he cannot find words to express his sorrow, but keeps repeating\r\nto himself: \'Would that I had valued at their true worth the men who\r\nhave saved our fatherland!\'"\r\n\r\n"And why should he say that?" asked the mollified General. "I bear him\r\nno grudge. In fact, I have never cherished aught but a sincere liking\r\nfor him, a sincere esteem, and do not doubt but that, in time, he may\r\nbecome a useful member of society."\r\n\r\n"In the words which you have been good enough to utter," said Chichikov\r\nwith a bow, "there is embodied much justice. Yes, Tientietnikov is\r\nin very truth a man of worth. Not only does he possess the gift of\r\neloquence, but also he is a master of the pen."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; he DOES write rubbish of some sort, doesn\'t he? Verses, or\r\nsomething of the kind?"\r\n\r\n"Not rubbish, your Excellency, but practical stuff. In short, he is\r\ninditing a history."\r\n\r\n"A HISTORY? But a history of what?"\r\n\r\n"A history of, of--" For a moment or two Chichikov hesitated. Then,\r\nwhether because it was a General that was seated in front of him, or\r\nbecause he desired to impart greater importance to the subject which\r\nhe was about to invent, he concluded: "A history of Generals, your\r\nExcellency."\r\n\r\n"Of Generals? Of WHAT Generals?"\r\n\r\n"Of Generals generally--of Generals at large. That is to say, and to be\r\nmore precise, a history of the Generals of our fatherland."\r\n\r\nBy this time Chichikov was floundering badly. Mentally he spat upon\r\nhimself and reflected: "Gracious heavens! What rubbish I am talking!"\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," went on his interlocutor, "but I do not quite understand\r\nyou. Is Tientietnikov producing a history of a given period, or only a\r\nhistory made up of a series of biographies? Also, is he including ALL\r\nour Generals, or only those who took part in the campaign of 1812?"\r\n\r\n"The latter, your Excellency--only the Generals of 1812," replied\r\nChichikov. Then he added beneath his breath: "Were I to be killed for\r\nit, I could not say what that may be supposed to mean."\r\n\r\n"Then why should he not come and see me in person?" went on his\r\nhost. "Possibly I might be able to furnish him with much interesting\r\nmaterial?"\r\n\r\n"He is afraid to come, your Excellency."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! Just because of a hasty word or two! I am not that sort of\r\nman at all. In fact, I should be very happy to call upon HIM."\r\n\r\n"Never would he permit that, your Excellency. He would greatly prefer to\r\nbe the first to make advances." And Chichikov added to himself: "What a\r\nstroke of luck those Generals were! Otherwise, the Lord knows where my\r\ntongue might have landed me!"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door into the adjoining room opened, and there\r\nappeared in the doorway a girl as fair as a ray of the sun--so fair,\r\nindeed, that Chichikov stared at her in amazement. Apparently she had\r\ncome to speak to her father for a moment, but had stopped short on\r\nperceiving that there was some one with him. The only fault to be\r\nfound in her appearance was the fact that she was too thin and\r\nfragile-looking.\r\n\r\n"May I introduce you to my little pet?" said the General to Chichikov.\r\n"To tell you the truth, I do not know your name."\r\n\r\n"That you should be unacquainted with the name of one who has never\r\ndistinguished himself in the manner of which you yourself can boast is\r\nscarcely to be wondered at." And Chichikov executed one of his sidelong,\r\ndeferential bows.\r\n\r\n"Well, I should be delighted to know it."\r\n\r\n"It is Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov, your Excellency." With that went\r\nthe easy bow of a military man and the agile backward movement of an\r\nindia-rubber ball.\r\n\r\n"Ulinka, this is Paul Ivanovitch," said the General, turning to his\r\ndaughter. "He has just told me some interesting news--namely, that\r\nour neighbour Tientietnikov is not altogether the fool we had at first\r\nthought him. On the contrary, he is engaged upon a very important\r\nwork--upon a history of the Russian Generals of 1812."\r\n\r\n"But who ever supposed him to be a fool?" asked the girl quickly. "What\r\nhappened was that you took Vishnepokromov\'s word--the word of a man who\r\nis himself both a fool and a good-for-nothing."\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said the father after further good-natured dispute on the\r\nsubject of Vishnepokromov. "Do you now run away, for I wish to dress for\r\nluncheon. And you, sir," he added to Chichikov, "will you not join us at\r\ntable?"\r\n\r\nChichikov bowed so low and so long that, by the time that his eyes had\r\nceased to see nothing but his own boots, the General\'s daughter had\r\ndisappeared, and in her place was standing a bewhiskered butler, armed\r\nwith a silver soap-dish and a hand-basin.\r\n\r\n"Do you mind if I wash in your presence?" asked the host.\r\n\r\n"By no means," replied Chichikov. "Pray do whatsoever you please in that\r\nrespect."\r\n\r\nUpon that the General fell to scrubbing himself--incidentally, to\r\nsending soapsuds flying in every direction. Meanwhile he seemed so\r\nfavourably disposed that Chichikov decided to sound him then and there,\r\nmore especially since the butler had left the room.\r\n\r\n"May I put to you a problem?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," replied the General. "What is it?"\r\n\r\n"It is this, your Excellency. I have a decrepit old uncle who owns three\r\nhundred souls and two thousand roubles-worth of other property. Also,\r\nexcept for myself, he possesses not a single heir. Now, although his\r\ninfirm state of health will not permit of his managing his property in\r\nperson, he will not allow me either to manage it. And the reason for his\r\nconduct--his very strange conduct--he states as follows: \'I do not know\r\nmy nephew, and very likely he is a spendthrift. If he wishes to show me\r\nthat he is good for anything, let him go and acquire as many souls as\r\n_I_ have acquired; and when he has done that I will transfer to him my\r\nthree hundred souls as well."\r\n\r\n"The man must be an absolute fool," commented the General.\r\n\r\n"Possibly. And were that all, things would not be as bad as they are.\r\nBut, unfortunately, my uncle has gone and taken up with his housekeeper,\r\nand has had children by her. Consequently, everything will now pass to\r\nTHEM."\r\n\r\n"The old man must have taken leave of his senses," remarked the General.\r\n"Yet how _I_ can help you I fail to see."\r\n\r\n"Well, I have thought of a plan. If you will hand me over all the dead\r\nsouls on your estate--hand them over to me exactly as though they were\r\nstill alive, and were purchasable property--I will offer them to the old\r\nman, and then he will leave me his fortune."\r\n\r\nAt this point the General burst into a roar of laughter such as few can\r\never have heard. Half-dressed, he subsided into a chair, threw back his\r\nhead, and guffawed until he came near to choking. In fact, the house\r\nshook with his merriment, so much so that the butler and his daughter\r\ncame running into the room in alarm.\r\n\r\nIt was long before he could produce a single articulate word; and\r\neven when he did so (to reassure his daughter and the butler) he kept\r\nmomentarily relapsing into spluttering chuckles which made the house\r\nring and ring again.\r\n\r\nChichikov was greatly taken aback.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that uncle!" bellowed the General in paroxysms of mirth. "Oh, that\r\nblessed uncle! WHAT a fool he\'ll look! Ha, ha, ha! Dead souls offered\r\nhim instead of live ones! Oh, my goodness!"\r\n\r\n"I suppose I\'ve put my foot in it again," ruefully reflected Chichikov.\r\n"But, good Lord, what a man the fellow is to laugh! Heaven send that he\r\ndoesn\'t burst of it!"\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, ha!" broke out the General afresh. "WHAT a donkey the old man\r\nmust be! To think of his saying to you: \'You go and fit yourself out\r\nwith three hundred souls, and I\'ll cap them with my own lot\'! My word!\r\nWhat a jackass!"\r\n\r\n"A jackass, your Excellency?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed! And to think of the jest of putting him off with dead\r\nsouls! Ha, ha, ha! WHAT wouldn\'t I give to see you handing him the title\r\ndeeds? Who is he? What is he like? Is he very old?"\r\n\r\n"He is eighty, your Excellency."\r\n\r\n"But still brisk and able to move about, eh? Surely he must be pretty\r\nstrong to go on living with his housekeeper like that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. But what does such strength mean? Sand runs away, your\r\nExcellency."\r\n\r\n"The old fool! But is he really such a fool?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, your Excellency."\r\n\r\n"And does he go out at all? Does he see company? Can he still hold\r\nhimself upright?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but with great difficulty."\r\n\r\n"And has he any teeth left?"\r\n\r\n"No more than two at the most."\r\n\r\n"The old jackass! Don\'t be angry with me, but I must say that, though\r\nyour uncle, he is also a jackass."\r\n\r\n"Quite so, your Excellency. And though it grieves ME to have to confess\r\nthat he is my uncle, what am I to do with him?"\r\n\r\nYet this was not altogether the truth. What would have been a far harder\r\nthing for Chichikov to have confessed was the fact that he possessed no\r\nuncles at all.\r\n\r\n"I beg of you, your Excellency," he went on, "to hand me over those,\r\nthose--"\r\n\r\n"Those dead souls, eh? Why, in return for the jest I will give you some\r\nland as well. Yes, you can take the whole graveyard if you like. Ha, ha,\r\nha! The old man! Ha, ha, ha! WHAT a fool he\'ll look! Ha, ha, ha!"\r\n\r\nAnd once more the General\'s guffaws went ringing through the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n       [At this point there is a long hiatus in the original.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n"If Colonel Koshkarev should turn out to be as mad as the last one it\r\nis a bad look-out," said Chichikov to himself on opening his eyes amid\r\nfields and open country--everything else having disappeared save the\r\nvault of heaven and a couple of low-lying clouds.\r\n\r\n"Selifan," he went on, "did you ask how to get to Colonel Koshkarev\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Paul Ivanovitch. At least, there was such a clatter around the\r\nkoliaska that I could not; but Petrushka asked the coachman."\r\n\r\n"You fool! How often have I told you not to rely on Petrushka? Petrushka\r\nis a blockhead, an idiot. Besides, at the present moment I believe him\r\nto be drunk."\r\n\r\n"No, you are wrong, barin," put in the person referred to, turning his\r\nhead with a sidelong glance. "After we get down the next hill we shall\r\nneed but to keep bending round it. That is all."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I suppose you\'ll tell me that sivnkha is the only thing that\r\nhas passed your lips? Well, the view at least is beautiful. In fact,\r\nwhen one has seen this place one may say that one has seen one of\r\nthe beauty spots of Europe." This said, Chichikov added to himself,\r\nsmoothing his chin: "What a difference between the features of a\r\ncivilised man of the world and those of a common lacquey!"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the koliaska quickened its pace, and Chichikov once more\r\ncaught sight of Tientietnikov\'s aspen-studded meadows. Undulating gently\r\non elastic springs, the vehicle cautiously descended the steep incline,\r\nand then proceeded past water-mills, rumbled over a bridge or two, and\r\njolted easily along the rough-set road which traversed the flats. Not a\r\nmolehill, not a mound jarred the spine. The vehicle was comfort itself.\r\n\r\nSwiftly there flew by clumps of osiers, slender elder trees, and\r\nsilver-leaved poplars, their branches brushing against Selifan and\r\nPetrushka, and at intervals depriving the valet of his cap. Each time\r\nthat this happened, the sullen-faced servitor fell to cursing both the\r\ntree responsible for the occurrence and the landowner responsible for\r\nthe tree being in existence; yet nothing would induce him thereafter\r\neither to tie on the cap or to steady it with his hand, so complete was\r\nhis assurance that the accident would never be repeated. Soon to the\r\nforegoing trees there became added an occasional birch or spruce fir,\r\nwhile in the dense undergrowth around their roots could be seen the blue\r\niris and the yellow wood-tulip. Gradually the forest grew darker, as\r\nthough eventually the obscurity would become complete. Then through\r\nthe trunks and the boughs there began to gleam points of light like\r\nglittering mirrors, and as the number of trees lessened, these points\r\ngrew larger, until the travellers debouched upon the shore of a lake\r\nfour versts or so in circumference, and having on its further margin\r\nthe grey, scattered log huts of a peasant village. In the water a great\r\ncommotion was in progress. In the first place, some twenty men, immersed\r\nto the knee, to the breast, or to the neck, were dragging a large\r\nfishing-net inshore, while, in the second place, there was entangled in\r\nthe same, in addition to some fish, a stout man shaped precisely like a\r\nmelon or a hogshead. Greatly excited, he was shouting at the top of his\r\nvoice: "Let Kosma manage it, you lout of a Denis! Kosma, take the end\r\nof the rope from Denis! Don\'t bear so hard on it, Thoma Bolshoy [41]! Go\r\nwhere Thoma Menshov [42] is! Damn it, bring the net to land, will you!"\r\nFrom this it became clear that it was not on his own account that the\r\nstout man was worrying. Indeed, he had no need to do so, since his fat\r\nwould in any case have prevented him from sinking. Yes, even if he\r\nhad turned head over heels in an effort to dive, the water would\r\npersistently have borne him up; and the same if, say, a couple of men\r\nhad jumped on his back--the only result would have been that he would\r\nhave become a trifle deeper submerged, and forced to draw breath by\r\nspouting bubbles through his nose. No, the cause of his agitation was\r\nlest the net should break, and the fish escape: wherefore he was urging\r\nsome additional peasants who were standing on the bank to lay hold of\r\nand to pull at, an extra rope or two.\r\n\r\n"That must be the barin--Colonel Koshkarev," said Selifan.\r\n\r\n"Why?" asked Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Because, if you please, his skin is whiter than the rest, and he has\r\nthe respectable paunch of a gentleman."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile good progress was being made with the hauling in of the barin;\r\nuntil, feeling the ground with his feet, he rose to an upright position,\r\nand at the same moment caught sight of the koliaska, with Chichikov\r\nseated therein, descending the declivity.\r\n\r\n"Have you dined yet?" shouted the barin as, still entangled in the net,\r\nhe approached the shore with a huge fish on his back. With one hand\r\nshading his eyes from the sun, and the other thrown backwards, he\r\nlooked, in point of pose, like the Medici Venus emerging from her bath.\r\n\r\n"No," replied Chichikov, raising his cap, and executing a series of\r\nbows.\r\n\r\n"Then thank God for that," rejoined the gentleman.\r\n\r\n"Why?" asked Chichikov with no little curiosity, and still holding his\r\ncap over his head.\r\n\r\n"Because of THIS. Cast off the net, Thoma Menshov, and pick up that\r\nsturgeon for the gentleman to see. Go and help him, Telepen Kuzma."\r\n\r\nWith that the peasants indicated picked up by the head what was a\r\nveritable monster of a fish.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it a beauty--a sturgeon fresh run from the river?" exclaimed the\r\nstout barin. "And now let us be off home. Coachman, you can take the\r\nlower road through the kitchen garden. Run, you lout of a Thoma Bolshoy,\r\nand open the gate for him. He will guide you to the house, and I myself\r\nshall be along presently."\r\n\r\nThereupon the barelegged Thoma Bolshoy, clad in nothing but a shirt,\r\nran ahead of the koliaska through the village, every hut of which had\r\nhanging in front of it a variety of nets, for the reason that every\r\ninhabitant of the place was a fisherman. Next, he opened a gate into a\r\nlarge vegetable enclosure, and thence the koliaska emerged into a square\r\nnear a wooden church, with, showing beyond the latter, the roofs of the\r\nmanorial homestead.\r\n\r\n"A queer fellow, that Koshkarev!" said Chichikov to himself.\r\n\r\n"Well, whatever I may be, at least I\'m here," said a voice by his side.\r\nChichikov looked round, and perceived that, in the meanwhile, the barin\r\nhad dressed himself and overtaken the carriage. With a pair of yellow\r\ntrousers he was wearing a grass-green jacket, and his neck was as\r\nguiltless of a collar as Cupid\'s. Also, as he sat sideways in his\r\ndrozhki, his bulk was such that he completely filled the vehicle.\r\nChichikov was about to make some remark or another when the stout\r\ngentleman disappeared; and presently his drozhki re-emerged into view at\r\nthe spot where the fish had been drawn to land, and his voice could be\r\nheard reiterating exhortations to his serfs. Yet when Chichikov reached\r\nthe verandah of the house he found, to his intense surprise, the stout\r\ngentleman waiting to welcome the visitor. How he had contrived to\r\nconvey himself thither passed Chichikov\'s comprehension. Host and guest\r\nembraced three times, according to a bygone custom of Russia. Evidently\r\nthe barin was one of the old school.\r\n\r\n"I bring you," said Chichikov, "a greeting from his Excellency."\r\n\r\n"From whom?"\r\n\r\n"From your relative General Alexander Dmitrievitch."\r\n\r\n"Who is Alexander Dmitrievitch?"\r\n\r\n"What? You do not know General Alexander Dmitrievitch Betrishev?"\r\nexclaimed Chichikov with a touch of surprise.\r\n\r\n"No, I do not," replied the gentleman.\r\n\r\nChichikov\'s surprise grew to absolute astonishment.\r\n\r\n"How comes that about?" he ejaculated. "I hope that I have the honour of\r\naddressing Colonel Koshkarev?"\r\n\r\n"Your hopes are vain. It is to my house, not to his, that you have come;\r\nand I am Peter Petrovitch Pietukh--yes, Peter Petrovitch Pietukh."\r\n\r\nChichikov, dumbfounded, turned to Selifan and Petrushka.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" he exclaimed. "I told you to drive to the house\r\nof Colonel Koshkarev, whereas you have brought me to that of Peter\r\nPetrovitch Pietukh."\r\n\r\n"All the same, your fellows have done quite right," put in the gentleman\r\nreferred to. "Do you" (this to Selifan and Petrushka) "go to the\r\nkitchen, where they will give you a glassful of vodka apiece. Then put\r\nup the horses, and be off to the servants\' quarters."\r\n\r\n"I regret the mistake extremely," said Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"But it is not a mistake. When you have tried the dinner which I have in\r\nstore for you, just see whether you think IT a mistake. Enter, I beg of\r\nyou." And, taking Chichikov by the arm, the host conducted him within,\r\nwhere they were met by a couple of youths.\r\n\r\n"Let me introduce my two sons, home for their holidays from the\r\nGymnasium [43]," said Pietukh. "Nikolasha, come and entertain our\r\ngood visitor, while you, Aleksasha, follow me." And with that the host\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nChichikov turned to Nikolasha, whom he found to be a budding man about\r\ntown, since at first he opened a conversation by stating that, as no\r\ngood was to be derived from studying at a provincial institution, he and\r\nhis brother desired to remove, rather, to St. Petersburg, the provinces\r\nnot being worth living in.\r\n\r\n"I quite understand," Chichikov thought to himself. "The end of the\r\nchapter will be confectioners\' assistants and the boulevards."\r\n\r\n"Tell me," he added aloud, "how does your father\'s property at present\r\nstand?"\r\n\r\n"It is all mortgaged," put in the father himself as he re-entered the\r\nroom. "Yes, it is all mortgaged, every bit of it."\r\n\r\n"What a pity!" thought Chichikov. "At this rate it will not be long\r\nbefore this man has no property at all left. I must hurry my departure."\r\nAloud he said with an air of sympathy: "That you have mortgaged the\r\nestate seems to me a matter of regret."\r\n\r\n"No, not at all," replied Pietukh. "In fact, they tell me that it is a\r\ngood thing to do, and that every one else is doing it. Why should I act\r\ndifferently from my neighbours? Moreover, I have had enough of living\r\nhere, and should like to try Moscow--more especially since my sons are\r\nalways begging me to give them a metropolitan education."\r\n\r\n"Oh, the fool, the fool!" reflected Chichikov. "He is for throwing\r\nup everything and making spendthrifts of his sons. Yet this is a nice\r\nproperty, and it is clear that the local peasants are doing well, and\r\nthat the family, too, is comfortably off. On the other hand, as soon as\r\never these lads begin their education in restaurants and theatres, the\r\ndevil will away with every stick of their substance. For my own part, I\r\ncould desire nothing better than this quiet life in the country."\r\n\r\n"Let me guess what is in your mind," said Pietukh.\r\n\r\n"What, then?" asked Chichikov, rather taken aback.\r\n\r\n"You are thinking to yourself: \'That fool of a Pietukh has asked me to\r\ndinner, yet not a bite of dinner do I see.\' But wait a little. It will\r\nbe ready presently, for it is being cooked as fast as a maiden who has\r\nhad her hair cut off plaits herself a new set of tresses."\r\n\r\n"Here comes Platon Mikhalitch, father!" exclaimed Aleksasha, who had\r\nbeen peeping out of the window.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and on a grey horse," added his brother.\r\n\r\n"Who is Platon Mikhalitch?" inquired Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"A neighbour of ours, and an excellent fellow."\r\n\r\nThe next moment Platon Mikhalitch himself entered the room, accompanied\r\nby a sporting dog named Yarb. He was a tall, handsome man, with\r\nextremely red hair. As for his companion, it was of the keen-muzzled\r\nspecies used for shooting.\r\n\r\n"Have you dined yet?" asked the host.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Platon.\r\n\r\n"Indeed! What do you mean by coming here to laugh at us all? Do I ever\r\ngo to YOUR place after dinner?"\r\n\r\nThe newcomer smiled. "Well, if it can bring you any comfort," he said,\r\n"let me tell you that I ate nothing at the meal, for I had no appetite."\r\n\r\n"But you should see what I have caught--what sort of a sturgeon fate has\r\nbrought my way! Yes, and what crucians and carp!"\r\n\r\n"Really it tires one to hear you. How come you always to be so\r\ncheerful?"\r\n\r\n"And how come YOU always to be so gloomy?" retorted the host.\r\n\r\n"How, you ask? Simply because I am so."\r\n\r\n"The truth is you don\'t eat enough. Try the plan of making a good\r\ndinner. Weariness of everything is a modern invention. Once upon a time\r\none never heard of it."\r\n\r\n"Well, boast away, but have you yourself never been tired of things?"\r\n\r\n"Never in my life. I do not so much as know whether I should find time\r\nto be tired. In the morning, when one awakes, the cook is waiting, and\r\nthe dinner has to be ordered. Then one drinks one\'s morning tea, and\r\nthen the bailiff arrives for HIS orders, and then there is fishing to be\r\ndone, and then one\'s dinner has to be eaten. Next, before one has even\r\nhad a chance to utter a snore, there enters once again the cook, and one\r\nhas to order supper; and when she has departed, behold, back she comes\r\nwith a request for the following day\'s dinner! What time does THAT leave\r\none to be weary of things?"\r\n\r\nThroughout this conversation, Chichikov had been taking stock of\r\nthe newcomer, who astonished him with his good looks, his upright,\r\npicturesque figure, his appearance of fresh, unwasted youthfulness,\r\nand the boyish purity, innocence, and clarity of his features. Neither\r\npassion nor care nor aught of the nature of agitation or anxiety of mind\r\nhad ventured to touch his unsullied face, or to lay a single wrinkle\r\nthereon. Yet the touch of life which those emotions might have imparted\r\nwas wanting. The face was, as it were, dreaming, even though from time\r\nto time an ironical smile disturbed it.\r\n\r\n"I, too, cannot understand," remarked Chichikov, "how a man of your\r\nappearance can find things wearisome. Of course, if a man is hard\r\npressed for money, or if he has enemies who are lying in wait for his\r\nlife (as have certain folk of whom I know), well, then--"\r\n\r\n"Believe me when I say," interrupted the handsome guest, "that, for the\r\nsake of a diversion, I should be glad of ANY sort of an anxiety. Would\r\nthat some enemy would conceive a grudge against me! But no one does so.\r\nEverything remains eternally dull."\r\n\r\n"But perhaps you lack a sufficiency of land or souls?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all. I and my brother own ten thousand desiatins [44] of land,\r\nand over a thousand souls."\r\n\r\n"Curious! I do not understand it. But perhaps the harvest has failed,\r\nor you have sickness about, and many of your male peasants have died of\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, everything is in splendid order, for my brother is the\r\nbest of managers."\r\n\r\n"Then to find things wearisome!" exclaimed Chichikov. "It passes my\r\ncomprehension." And he shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Well, we will soon put weariness to flight," interrupted the host.\r\n"Aleksasha, do you run helter-skelter to the kitchen, and there tell\r\nthe cook to serve the fish pasties. Yes, and where have that gawk of an\r\nEmelian and that thief of an Antoshka got to? Why have they not handed\r\nround the zakuski?"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door opened, and the "gawk" and the "thief" in\r\nquestion made their appearance with napkins and a tray--the latter\r\nbearing six decanters of variously-coloured beverages. These they placed\r\nupon the table, and then ringed them about with glasses and platefuls\r\nof every conceivable kind of appetiser. That done, the servants applied\r\nthemselves to bringing in various comestibles under covers, through\r\nwhich could be heard the hissing of hot roast viands. In particular\r\ndid the "gawk" and the "thief" work hard at their tasks. As a matter\r\nof fact, their appellations had been given them merely to spur them to\r\ngreater activity, for, in general, the barin was no lover of abuse, but,\r\nrather, a kind-hearted man who, like most Russians, could not get on\r\nwithout a sharp word or two. That is to say, he needed them for his\r\ntongue as he need a glass of vodka for his digestion. What else could\r\nyou expect? It was his nature to care for nothing mild.\r\n\r\nTo the zakuski succeeded the meal itself, and the host became a perfect\r\nglutton on his guests\' behalf. Should he notice that a guest had taken\r\nbut a single piece of a comestible, he added thereto another one,\r\nsaying: "Without a mate, neither man nor bird can live in this world."\r\nShould any one take two pieces, he added thereto a third, saying: "What\r\nis the good of the number 2? God loves a trinity." Should any one\r\ntake three pieces, he would say: "Where do you see a waggon with three\r\nwheels? Who builds a three-cornered hut?" Lastly, should any one take\r\nfour pieces, he would cap them with a fifth, and add thereto the punning\r\nquip, "Na piat opiat [45]". After devouring at least twelve steaks\r\nof sturgeon, Chichikov ventured to think to himself, "My host cannot\r\npossibly add to THEM," but found that he was mistaken, for, without a\r\nword, Pietukh heaped upon his plate an enormous portion of spit-roasted\r\nveal, and also some kidneys. And what veal it was!\r\n\r\n"That calf was fed two years on milk," he explained. "I cared for it\r\nlike my own son."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless I can eat no more," said Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Do you try the veal before you say that you can eat no more."\r\n\r\n"But I could not get it down my throat. There is no room left."\r\n\r\n"If there be no room in a church for a newcomer, the beadle is sent for,\r\nand room is very soon made--yes, even though before there was such a\r\ncrush that an apple couldn\'t have been dropped between the people. Do\r\nyou try the veal, I say. That piece is the titbit of all."\r\n\r\nSo Chichikov made the attempt; and in very truth the veal was beyond all\r\npraise, and room was found for it, even though one would have supposed\r\nthe feat impossible.\r\n\r\n"Fancy this good fellow removing to St. Petersburg or Moscow!" said the\r\nguest to himself. "Why, with a scale of living like this, he would be\r\nruined in three years." For that matter, Pietukh might well have been\r\nruined already, for hospitality can dissipate a fortune in three months\r\nas easily as it can in three years.\r\n\r\nThe host also dispensed the wine with a lavish hand, and what the guests\r\ndid not drink he gave to his sons, who thus swallowed glass after glass.\r\nIndeed, even before coming to table, it was possible to discern to what\r\ndepartment of human accomplishment their bent was turned. When the meal\r\nwas over, however, the guests had no mind for further drinking. Indeed,\r\nit was all that they could do to drag themselves on to the balcony,\r\nand there to relapse into easy chairs. Indeed, the moment that the host\r\nsubsided into his seat--it was large enough for four--he fell asleep,\r\nand his portly presence, converting itself into a sort of blacksmith\'s\r\nbellows, started to vent, through open mouth and distended nostrils,\r\nsuch sounds as can have greeted the reader\'s ear but seldom--sounds as\r\nof a drum being beaten in combination with the whistling of a flute and\r\nthe strident howling of a dog.\r\n\r\n"Listen to him!" said Platon.\r\n\r\nChichikov smiled.\r\n\r\n"Naturally, on such dinners as that," continued the other, "our host\r\ndoes NOT find the time dull. And as soon as dinner is ended there can\r\nensue sleep."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but, pardon me, I still fail to understand why you should find\r\nlife wearisome. There are so many resources against ennui!"\r\n\r\n"As for instance?"\r\n\r\n"For a young man, dancing, the playing of one or another musical\r\ninstrument, and--well, yes, marriage."\r\n\r\n"Marriage to whom?"\r\n\r\n"To some maiden who is both charming and rich. Are there none in these\r\nparts?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Then, were I you, I should travel, and seek a maiden elsewhere." And a\r\nbrilliant idea therewith entered Chichikov\'s head. "This last resource,"\r\nhe added, "is the best of all resources against ennui."\r\n\r\n"What resource are you speaking of?"\r\n\r\n"Of travel."\r\n\r\n"But whither?"\r\n\r\n"Well, should it so please you, you might join me as my companion." This\r\nsaid, the speaker added to himself as he eyed Platon: "Yes, that would\r\nsuit me exactly, for then I should have half my expenses paid, and could\r\ncharge him also with the cost of mending the koliaska."\r\n\r\n"And whither should we go?"\r\n\r\n"In that respect I am not wholly my own master, as I have business to do\r\nfor others as well as for myself. For instance, General Betristchev--an\r\nintimate friend and, I might add, a generous benefactor of mine--has\r\ncharged me with commissions to certain of his relatives. However, though\r\nrelatives are relatives, I am travelling likewise on my own account,\r\nsince I wish to see the world and the whirligig of humanity--which, in\r\nspite of what people may say, is as good as a living book or a second\r\neducation." As a matter of fact, Chichikov was reflecting, "Yes, the\r\nplan is an excellent one. I might even contrive that he should have to\r\nbear the whole of our expenses, and that his horses should be used while\r\nmy own should be put out to graze on his farm."\r\n\r\n"Well, why should I not adopt the suggestion?" was Platon\'s thought.\r\n"There is nothing for me to do at home, since the management of the\r\nestate is in my brother\'s hands, and my going would cause him no\r\ninconvenience. Yes, why should I not do as Chichikov has suggested?"\r\n\r\nThen he added aloud:\r\n\r\n"Would you come and stay with my brother for a couple of days? Otherwise\r\nhe might refuse me his consent."\r\n\r\n"With great pleasure," said Chichikov. "Or even for three days."\r\n\r\n"Then here is my hand on it. Let us be off at once." Platon seemed\r\nsuddenly to have come to life again.\r\n\r\n"Where are you off to?" put in their host unexpectedly as he roused\r\nhimself and stared in astonishment at the pair. "No, no, my good sirs. I\r\nhave had the wheels removed from your koliaska, Monsieur Chichikov, and\r\nhave sent your horse, Platon Mikhalitch, to a grazing ground fifteen\r\nversts away. Consequently you must spend the night here, and depart\r\nto-morrow morning after breakfast."\r\n\r\nWhat could be done with a man like Pietukh? There was no help for it but\r\nto remain. In return, the guests were rewarded with a beautiful spring\r\nevening, for, to spend the time, the host organised a boating expedition\r\non the river, and a dozen rowers, with a dozen pairs of oars, conveyed\r\nthe party (to the accompaniment of song) across the smooth surface of\r\nthe lake and up a great river with towering banks. From time to time the\r\nboat would pass under ropes, stretched across for purposes of fishing,\r\nand at each turn of the rippling current new vistas unfolded themselves\r\nas tier upon tier of woodland delighted the eye with a diversity of\r\ntimber and foliage. In unison did the rowers ply their sculls, yet it\r\nwas though of itself that the skiff shot forward, bird-like, over the\r\nglassy surface of the water; while at intervals the broad-shouldered\r\nyoung oarsman who was seated third from the bow would raise, as from\r\na nightingale\'s throat, the opening staves of a boat song, and then be\r\njoined by five or six more, until the melody had come to pour forth in a\r\nvolume as free and boundless as Russia herself. And Pietukh, too, would\r\ngive himself a shake, and help lustily to support the chorus; and even\r\nChichikov felt acutely conscious of the fact that he was a Russian. Only\r\nPlaton reflected: "What is there so splendid in these melancholy songs?\r\nThey do but increase one\'s depression of spirits."\r\n\r\nThe journey homeward was made in the gathering dusk. Rhythmically the\r\noars smote a surface which no longer reflected the sky, and darkness had\r\nfallen when they reached the shore, along which lights were twinkling\r\nwhere the fisherfolk were boiling live eels for soup. Everything had now\r\nwended its way homeward for the night; the cattle and poultry had\r\nbeen housed, and the herdsmen, standing at the gates of the village\r\ncattle-pens, amid the trailing dust lately raised by their charges,\r\nwere awaiting the milk-pails and a summons to partake of the eel-broth.\r\nThrough the dusk came the hum of humankind, and the barking of dogs in\r\nother and more distant villages; while, over all, the moon was rising,\r\nand the darkened countryside was beginning to glimmer to light again\r\nunder her beams. What a glorious picture! Yet no one thought of admiring\r\nit. Instead of galloping over the countryside on frisky cobs,\r\nNikolasha and Aleksasha were engaged in dreaming of Moscow, with its\r\nconfectioners\' shops and the theatres of which a cadet, newly arrived on\r\na visit from the capital, had just been telling them; while their father\r\nhad his mind full of how best to stuff his guests with yet more food,\r\nand Platon was given up to yawning. Only in Chichikov was a spice of\r\nanimation visible. "Yes," he reflected, "some day I, too, will become\r\nlord of such a country place." And before his mind\'s eye there arose\r\nalso a helpmeet and some little Chichikovs.\r\n\r\nBy the time that supper was finished the party had again over-eaten\r\nthemselves, and when Chichikov entered the room allotted him for the\r\nnight, he lay down upon the bed, and prodded his stomach. "It is as\r\ntight as a drum," he said to himself. "Not another titbit of veal could\r\nnow get into it." Also, circumstances had so brought it about that\r\nnext door to him there was situated his host\'s apartment; and since the\r\nintervening wall was thin, Chichikov could hear every word that was\r\nsaid there. At the present moment the master of the house was engaged in\r\ngiving the cook orders for what, under the guise of an early breakfast,\r\npromised to constitute a veritable dinner. You should have heard\r\nPietukh\'s behests! They would have excited the appetite of a corpse.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, sucking his lips, and drawing a deep breath, "in the\r\nfirst place, make a pasty in four divisions. Into one of the divisions\r\nput the sturgeon\'s cheeks and some viaziga [46], and into another\r\ndivision some buckwheat porridge, young mushrooms and onions,\r\nsweet milk, calves\' brains, and anything else that you may find\r\nsuitable--anything else that you may have got handy. Also, bake the\r\npastry to a nice brown on one side, and but lightly on the other. Yes,\r\nand, as to the under side, bake it so that it will be all juicy and\r\nflaky, so that it shall not crumble into bits, but melt in the mouth\r\nlike the softest snow that ever you heard of." And as he said this\r\nPietukh fairly smacked his lips.\r\n\r\n"The devil take him!" muttered Chichikov, thrusting his head beneath the\r\nbedclothes to avoid hearing more. "The fellow won\'t give one a chance to\r\nsleep."\r\n\r\nNevertheless he heard through the blankets:\r\n\r\n"And garnish the sturgeon with beetroot, smelts, peppered mushrooms,\r\nyoung radishes, carrots, beans, and anything else you like, so as to\r\nhave plenty of trimmings. Yes, and put a lump of ice into the pig\'s\r\nbladder, so as to swell it up."\r\n\r\nMany other dishes did Pietukh order, and nothing was to be heard but\r\nhis talk of boiling, roasting, and stewing. Finally, just as mention was\r\nbeing made of a turkey cock, Chichikov fell asleep.\r\n\r\nNext morning the guest\'s state of repletion had reached the point\r\nof Platon being unable to mount his horse; wherefore the latter was\r\ndispatched homeward with one of Pietukh\'s grooms, and the two guests\r\nentered Chichikov\'s koliaska. Even the dog trotted lazily in the rear;\r\nfor he, too, had over-eaten himself.\r\n\r\n"It has been rather too much of a good thing," remarked Chichikov as the\r\nvehicle issued from the courtyard.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and it vexes me to see the fellow never tire of it," replied\r\nPlaton.\r\n\r\n"Ah," thought Chichikov to himself, "if _I_ had an income of seventy\r\nthousand roubles, as you have, I\'d very soon give tiredness one in\r\nthe eye! Take Murazov, the tax-farmer--he, again, must be worth ten\r\nmillions. What a fortune!"\r\n\r\n"Do you mind where we drive?" asked Platon. "I should like first to go\r\nand take leave of my sister and my brother-in-law."\r\n\r\n"With pleasure," said Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"My brother-in-law is the leading landowner hereabouts. At the present\r\nmoment he is drawing an income of two hundred thousand roubles from a\r\nproperty which, eight years ago, was producing a bare twenty thousand."\r\n\r\n"Truly a man worthy of the utmost respect! I shall be most interested to\r\nmake his acquaintance. To think of it! And what may his family name be?"\r\n\r\n"Kostanzhoglo."\r\n\r\n"And his Christian name and patronymic?"\r\n\r\n"Constantine Thedorovitch."\r\n\r\n"Constantine Thedorovitch Kostanzhoglo. Yes, it will be a most\r\ninteresting event to make his acquaintance. To know such a man must be a\r\nwhole education."\r\n\r\nHere Platon set himself to give Selifan some directions as to the way,\r\na necessary proceeding in view of the fact that Selifan could hardly\r\nmaintain his seat on the box. Twice Petrushka, too, had fallen headlong,\r\nand this necessitated being tied to his perch with a piece of rope.\r\n"What a clown!" had been Chichikov\'s only comment.\r\n\r\n"This is where my brother-in-law\'s land begins," said Platon.\r\n\r\n"They give one a change of view."\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, from this point the countryside became planted with timber;\r\nthe rows of trees running as straight as pistol-shots, and having beyond\r\nthem, and on higher ground, a second expanse of forest, newly planted\r\nlike the first; while beyond it, again, loomed a third plantation of\r\nolder trees. Next there succeeded a flat piece of the same nature.\r\n\r\n"All this timber," said Platon, "has grown up within eight or ten years\r\nat the most; whereas on another man\'s land it would have taken twenty to\r\nattain the same growth."\r\n\r\n"And how has your brother-in-law effected this?"\r\n\r\n"You must ask him yourself. He is so excellent a husbandman that nothing\r\never fails with him. You see, he knows the soil, and also knows what\r\nought to be planted beside what, and what kinds of timber are the best\r\nneighbourhood for grain. Again, everything on his estate is made to\r\nperform at least three or four different functions. For instance, he\r\nmakes his timber not only serve as timber, but also serve as a provider\r\nof moisture and shade to a given stretch of land, and then as a\r\nfertiliser with its fallen leaves. Consequently, when everywhere else\r\nthere is drought, he still has water, and when everywhere else there\r\nhas been a failure of the harvest, on his lands it will have proved a\r\nsuccess. But it is a pity that I know so little about it all as to be\r\nunable to explain to you his many expedients. Folk call him a wizard,\r\nfor he produces so much. Nevertheless, personally I find what he does\r\nuninteresting."\r\n\r\n"Truly an astonishing fellow!" reflected Chichikov with a glance at his\r\ncompanion. "It is sad indeed to see a man so superficial as to be unable\r\nto explain matters of this kind."\r\n\r\nAt length the manor appeared in sight--an establishment looking almost\r\nlike a town, so numerous were the huts where they stood arranged in\r\nthree tiers, crowned with three churches, and surrounded with huge ricks\r\nand barns. "Yes," thought Chichikov to himself, "one can see what a\r\njewel of a landowner lives here." The huts in question were stoutly\r\nbuilt and the intervening alleys well laid-out; while, wherever a waggon\r\nwas visible, it looked serviceable and more or less new. Also, the local\r\npeasants bore an intelligent look on their faces, the cattle were of the\r\nbest possible breed, and even the peasants\' pigs belonged to the porcine\r\naristocracy. Clearly there dwelt here peasants who, to quote the\r\nsong, were accustomed to "pick up silver by the shovelful." Nor were\r\nEnglishified gardens and parterres and other conceits in evidence, but,\r\non the contrary, there ran an open view from the manor house to the\r\nfarm buildings and the workmen\'s cots, so that, after the old Russian\r\nfashion, the barin should be able to keep an eye upon all that was going\r\non around him. For the same purpose, the mansion was topped with a tall\r\nlantern and a superstructure--a device designed, not for ornament,\r\nnor for a vantage-spot for the contemplation of the view, but for\r\nsupervision of the labourers engaged in distant fields. Lastly, the\r\nbrisk, active servants who received the visitors on the verandah were\r\nvery different menials from the drunken Petrushka, even though they did\r\nnot wear swallow-tailed coats, but only Cossack tchekmenu [47] of blue\r\nhomespun cloth.\r\n\r\nThe lady of the house also issued on to the verandah. With her face of\r\nthe freshness of "blood and milk" and the brightness of God\'s daylight,\r\nshe as nearly resembled Platon as one pea resembles another, save that,\r\nwhereas he was languid, she was cheerful and full of talk.\r\n\r\n"Good day, brother!" she cried. "How glad I am to see you! Constantine\r\nis not at home, but will be back presently."\r\n\r\n"Where is he?"\r\n\r\n"Doing business in the village with a party of factors," replied the\r\nlady as she conducted her guests to the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nWith no little curiosity did Chichikov gaze at the interior of the\r\nmansion inhabited by the man who received an annual income of two\r\nhundred thousand roubles; for he thought to discern therefrom the nature\r\nof its proprietor, even as from a shell one may deduce the species of\r\noyster or snail which has been its tenant, and has left therein its\r\nimpression. But no such conclusions were to be drawn. The rooms were\r\nsimple, and even bare. Not a fresco nor a picture nor a bronze nor a\r\nflower nor a china what-not nor a book was there to be seen. In short,\r\neverything appeared to show that the proprietor of this abode spent the\r\ngreater part of his time, not between four walls, but in the field, and\r\nthat he thought out his plans, not in sybaritic fashion by the fireside,\r\nnor in an easy chair beside the stove, but on the spot where work was\r\nactually in progress--that, in a word, where those plans were conceived,\r\nthere they were put into execution. Nor in these rooms could Chichikov\r\ndetect the least trace of a feminine hand, beyond the fact that\r\ncertain tables and chairs bore drying-boards whereon were arranged some\r\nsprinklings of flower petals.\r\n\r\n"What is all this rubbish for?" asked Platon.\r\n\r\n"It is not rubbish," replied the lady of the house. "On the contrary, it\r\nis the best possible remedy for fever. Last year we cured every one of\r\nour sick peasants with it. Some of the petals I am going to make into an\r\nointment, and some into an infusion. You may laugh as much as you like\r\nat my potting and preserving, yet you yourself will be glad of things of\r\nthe kind when you set out on your travels."\r\n\r\nPlaton moved to the piano, and began to pick out a note or two.\r\n\r\n"Good Lord, what an ancient instrument!" he exclaimed. "Are you not\r\nashamed of it, sister?"\r\n\r\n"Well, the truth is that I get no time to practice my music. You see,"\r\nshe added to Chichikov, "I have an eight-year-old daughter to educate;\r\nand to hand her over to a foreign governess in order that I may have\r\nleisure for my own piano-playing--well, that is a thing which I could\r\nnever bring myself to do."\r\n\r\n"You have become a wearisome sort of person," commented Platon, and\r\nwalked away to the window. "Ah, here comes Constantine," presently he\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nChichikov also glanced out of the window, and saw approaching the\r\nverandah a brisk, swarthy-complexioned man of about forty, a man clad in\r\na rough cloth jacket and a velveteen cap. Evidently he was one of those\r\nwho care little for the niceties of dress. With him, bareheaded, there\r\ncame a couple of men of a somewhat lower station in life, and all\r\nthree were engaged in an animated discussion. One of the barin\'s two\r\ncompanions was a plain peasant, and the other (clad in a blue Siberian\r\nsmock) a travelling factor. The fact that the party halted awhile by\r\nthe entrance steps made it possible to overhear a portion of their\r\nconversation from within.\r\n\r\n"This is what you peasants had better do," the barin was saying.\r\n"Purchase your release from your present master. I will lend you the\r\nnecessary money, and afterwards you can work for me."\r\n\r\n"No, Constantine Thedorovitch," replied the peasant. "Why should we do\r\nthat? Remove us just as we are. You will know how to arrange it, for a\r\ncleverer gentleman than you is nowhere to be found. The misfortune of us\r\nmuzhiks is that we cannot protect ourselves properly. The tavern-keepers\r\nsell us such liquor that, before a man knows where he is, a glassful of\r\nit has eaten a hole through his stomach, and made him feel as though\r\nhe could drink a pail of water. Yes, it knocks a man over before he can\r\nlook around. Everywhere temptation lies in wait for the peasant, and he\r\nneeds to be cunning if he is to get through the world at all. In fact,\r\nthings seem to be contrived for nothing but to make us peasants lose\r\nour wits, even to the tobacco which they sell us. What are folk like\r\nourselves to do, Constantine Thedorovitch? I tell you it is terribly\r\ndifficult for a muzhik to look after himself."\r\n\r\n"Listen to me. This is how things are done here. When I take on a serf,\r\nI fit him out with a cow and a horse. On the other hand, I demand of him\r\nthereafter more than is demanded of a peasant anywhere else. That is to\r\nsay, first and foremost I make him work. Whether a peasant be working\r\nfor himself or for me, never do I let him waste time. I myself toil like\r\na bullock, and I force my peasants to do the same, for experience\r\nhas taught me that that is the only way to get through life. All the\r\nmischief in the world comes through lack of employment. Now, do you go\r\nand consider the matter, and talk it over with your mir [48]."\r\n\r\n"We have done that already, Constantine Thedorovitch, and our elders\'\r\nopinion is: \'There is no need for further talk. Every peasant belonging\r\nto Constantine Thedorovitch is well off, and hasn\'t to work for nothing.\r\nThe priests of his village, too, are men of good heart, whereas ours\r\nhave been taken away, and there is no one to bury us.\'"\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, do you go and talk the matter over again."\r\n\r\n"We will, barin."\r\n\r\nHere the factor who had been walking on the barin\'s other side put in a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n"Constantine Thedorovitch," he said, "I beg of you to do as I have\r\nrequested."\r\n\r\n"I have told you before," replied the barin, "that I do not care to play\r\nthe huckster. I am not one of those landowners whom fellows of your sort\r\nvisit on the very day that the interest on a mortgage is due. Ah, I know\r\nyour fraternity thoroughly, and know that you keep lists of all who have\r\nmortgages to repay. But what is there so clever about that? Any man,\r\nif you pinch him sufficiently, will surrender you a mortgage at\r\nhalf-price,--any man, that is to say, except myself, who care nothing\r\nfor your money. Were a loan of mine to remain out three years, I should\r\nnever demand a kopeck of interest on it."\r\n\r\n"Quite so, Constantine Thedorovitch," replied the factor. "But I am\r\nasking this of you more for the purpose of establishing us on a business\r\nfooting than because I desire to win your favour. Prey, therefore,\r\naccept this earnest money of three thousand roubles." And the man drew\r\nfrom his breast pocket a dirty roll of bank-notes, which, carelessly\r\nreceiving, Kostanzhoglo thrust, uncounted, into the back pocket of his\r\novercoat.\r\n\r\n"Hm!" thought Chichikov. "For all he cares, the notes might have been a\r\nhandkerchief."\r\n\r\nWhen Kostanzhoglo appeared at closer quarters--that is to say, in the\r\ndoorway of the drawing-room--he struck Chichikov more than ever with the\r\nswarthiness of his complexion, the dishevelment of his black, slightly\r\ngrizzled locks, the alertness of his eye, and the impression of fiery\r\nsouthern origin which his whole personality diffused. For he was not\r\nwholly a Russian, nor could he himself say precisely who his forefathers\r\nhad been. Yet, inasmuch as he accounted genealogical research no part of\r\nthe science of estate-management, but a mere superfluity, he looked upon\r\nhimself as, to all intents and purposes, a native of Russia, and the\r\nmore so since the Russian language was the only tongue he knew.\r\n\r\nPlaton presented Chichikov, and the pair exchanged greetings.\r\n\r\n"To get rid of my depression, Constantine," continued Platon, "I am\r\nthinking of accompanying our guest on a tour through a few of the\r\nprovinces."\r\n\r\n"An excellent idea," said Kostanzhoglo. "But precisely whither?" he\r\nadded, turning hospitably to Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"To tell you the truth," replied that personage with an affable\r\ninclination of the head as he smoothed the arm of his chair with his\r\nhand, "I am travelling less on my own affairs than on the affairs of\r\nothers. That is to say, General Betristchev, an intimate friend, and,\r\nI might add, a generous benefactor, of mine, has charged me with\r\ncommissions to some of his relatives. Nevertheless, though relatives are\r\nrelatives, I may say that I am travelling on my own account as well, in\r\nthat, in addition to possible benefit to my health, I desire to see the\r\nworld and the whirligig of humanity, which constitute, so to speak, a\r\nliving book, a second course of education."\r\n\r\n"Yes, there is no harm in looking at other corners of the world besides\r\none\'s own."\r\n\r\n"You speak truly. There IS no harm in such a proceeding. Thereby one may\r\nsee things which one has not before encountered, one may meet men with\r\nwhom one has not before come in contact. And with some men of that kind\r\na conversation is as precious a benefit as has been conferred upon me\r\nby the present occasion. I come to you, most worthy Constantine\r\nThedorovitch, for instruction, and again for instruction, and beg of you\r\nto assuage my thirst with an exposition of the truth as it is. I hunger\r\nfor the favour of your words as for manna."\r\n\r\n"But how so? What can _I_ teach you?" exclaimed Kostanzhoglo in\r\nconfusion. "I myself was given but the plainest of educations."\r\n\r\n"Nay, most worthy sir, you possess wisdom, and again wisdom. Wisdom only\r\ncan direct the management of a great estate, that can derive a\r\nsound income from the same, that can acquire wealth of a real, not a\r\nfictitious, order while also fulfilling the duties of a citizen and\r\nthereby earning the respect of the Russian public. All this I pray you\r\nto teach me."\r\n\r\n"I tell you what," said Kostanzhoglo, looking meditatively at his guest.\r\n"You had better stay with me for a few days, and during that time I can\r\nshow you how things are managed here, and explain to you everything.\r\nThen you will see for yourself that no great wisdom is required for the\r\npurpose."\r\n\r\n"Yes, certainly you must stay here," put in the lady of the house. Then,\r\nturning to her brother, she added: "And you too must stay. Why should\r\nyou be in such a hurry?"\r\n\r\n"Very well," he replied. "But what say YOU, Paul Ivanovitch?"\r\n\r\n"I say the same as you, and with much pleasure," replied Chichikov.\r\n"But also I ought to tell you this: that there is a relative of General\r\nBetristchev\'s, a certain Colonel Koshkarev--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, we know him; but he is quite mad."\r\n\r\n"As you say, he is mad, and I should not have been intending to visit\r\nhim, were it not that General Betristchev is an intimate friend of mine,\r\nas well as, I might add, my most generous benefactor."\r\n\r\n"Then," said Kostanzhoglo, "do you go and see Colonel Koshkarev NOW.\r\nHe lives less than ten versts from here, and I have a gig already\r\nharnessed. Go to him at once, and return here for tea."\r\n\r\n"An excellent idea!" cried Chichikov, and with that he seized his cap.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour\'s drive sufficed to bring him to the Colonel\'s\r\nestablishment. The village attached to the manor was in a state of utter\r\nconfusion, since in every direction building and repairing operations\r\nwere in progress, and the alleys were choked with heaps of lime, bricks,\r\nand beams of wood. Also, some of the huts were arranged to resemble\r\noffices, and superscribed in gilt letters "Depot for Agricultural\r\nImplements," "Chief Office of Accounts," "Estate Works Committee,"\r\n"Normal School for the Education of Colonists," and so forth.\r\n\r\nChichikov found the Colonel posted behind a desk and holding a pen\r\nbetween his teeth. Without an instant\'s delay the master of the\r\nestablishment--who seemed a kindly, approachable man, and accorded to\r\nhis visitor a very civil welcome--plunged into a recital of the labour\r\nwhich it had cost him to bring the property to its present condition of\r\naffluence. Then he went on to lament the fact that he could not make\r\nhis peasantry understand the incentives to labour which the riches\r\nof science and art provide; for instance, he had failed to induce his\r\nfemale serfs to wear corsets, whereas in Germany, where he had resided\r\nfor fourteen years, every humble miller\'s daughter could play the piano.\r\nNone the less, he said, he meant to peg away until every peasant on\r\nthe estate should, as he walked behind the plough, indulge in a regular\r\ncourse of reading Franklin\'s Notes on Electricity, Virgil\'s Georgics, or\r\nsome work on the chemical properties of soil.\r\n\r\n"Good gracious!" mentally exclaimed Chichikov. "Why, I myself have not\r\nhad time to finish that book by the Duchesse de la Valliere!"\r\n\r\nMuch else the Colonel said. In particular did he aver that, provided\r\nthe Russian peasant could be induced to array himself in German costume,\r\nscience would progress, trade increase, and the Golden Age dawn in\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nFor a while Chichikov listened with distended eyes. Then he felt\r\nconstrained to intimate that with all that he had nothing to do, seeing\r\nthat his business was merely to acquire a few souls, and thereafter to\r\nhave their purchase confirmed.\r\n\r\n"If I understand you aright," said the Colonel, "you wish to present a\r\nStatement of Plea?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is so."\r\n\r\n"Then kindly put it into writing, and it shall be forwarded to the\r\nOffice for the Reception of Reports and Returns. Thereafter that Office\r\nwill consider it, and return it to me, who will, in turn, dispatch it to\r\nthe Estate Works Committee, who will, in turn, revise it, and present it\r\nto the Administrator, who, jointly with the Secretary, will--"\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," expostulated Chichikov, "but that procedure will take up a\r\ngreat deal of time. Why need I put the matter into writing at all? It is\r\nsimply this. I want a few souls which are--well, which are, so to speak,\r\ndead."\r\n\r\n"Very good," commented the Colonel. "Do you write down in your Statement\r\nof Plea that the souls which you desire are, \'so to speak, dead.\'"\r\n\r\n"But what would be the use of my doing so? Though the souls are dead, my\r\npurpose requires that they should be represented as alive."\r\n\r\n"Very good," again commented the Colonel. "Do you write down in your\r\nStatement that \'it is necessary\' (or, should you prefer an alternative\r\nphrase, \'it is requested,\' or \'it is desiderated,\' or \'it is prayed,\')\r\n\'that the souls be represented as alive.\' At all events, WITHOUT\r\ndocumentary process of that kind, the matter cannot possibly be carried\r\nthrough. Also, I will appoint a Commissioner to guide you round the\r\nvarious Offices."\r\n\r\nAnd he sounded a bell; whereupon there presented himself a man whom,\r\naddressing as "Secretary," the Colonel instructed to summon the\r\n"Commissioner." The latter, on appearing, was seen to have the air, half\r\nof a peasant, half of an official.\r\n\r\n"This man," the Colonel said to Chichikov, "will act as your escort."\r\n\r\nWhat could be done with a lunatic like Koshkarev? In the end, curiosity\r\nmoved Chichikov to accompany the Commissioner. The Committee for the\r\nReception of Reports and Returns was discovered to have put up its\r\nshutters, and to have locked its doors, for the reason that the Director\r\nof the Committee had been transferred to the newly-formed Committee\r\nof Estate Management, and his successor had been annexed by the same\r\nCommittee. Next, Chichikov and his escort rapped at the doors of the\r\nDepartment of Estate Affairs; but that Department\'s quarters happened to\r\nbe in a state of repair, and no one could be made to answer the\r\nsummons save a drunken peasant from whom not a word of sense was to be\r\nextracted. At length the escort felt himself moved to remark:\r\n\r\n"There is a deal of foolishness going on here. Fellows like that\r\ndrunkard lead the barin by the nose, and everything is ruled by the\r\nCommittee of Management, which takes men from their proper work, and\r\nsets them to do any other it likes. Indeed, only through the Committee\r\ndoes ANYTHING get done."\r\n\r\nBy this time Chichikov felt that he had seen enough; wherefore he\r\nreturned to the Colonel, and informed him that the Office for the\r\nReception of Reports and Returns had ceased to exist. At once the\r\nColonel flamed to noble rage. Pressing Chichikov\'s hand in token of\r\ngratitude for the information which the guest had furnished, he took\r\npaper and pen, and noted eight searching questions under three separate\r\nheadings: (1) "Why has the Committee of Management presumed to issue\r\norders to officials not under its jurisdiction?" (2) "Why has the Chief\r\nManager permitted his predecessor, though still in retention of his\r\npost, to follow him to another Department?" and (3) "Why has the\r\nCommittee of Estate Affairs suffered the Office for the Reception of\r\nReports and Returns to lapse?"\r\n\r\n"Now for a row!" thought Chichikov to himself, and turned to depart; but\r\nhis host stopped him, saying:\r\n\r\n"I cannot let you go, for, in addition to my honour having become\r\ninvolved, it behoves me to show my people how the regular, the\r\norganised, administration of an estate may be conducted. Herewith I will\r\nhand over the conduct of your affair to a man who is worth all the rest\r\nof the staff put together, and has had a university education. Also, the\r\nbetter to lose no time, may I humbly beg you to step into my library,\r\nwhere you will find notebooks, paper, pens, and everything else that\r\nyou may require. Of these articles pray make full use, for you are\r\na gentleman of letters, and it is your and my joint duty to bring\r\nenlightenment to all."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he ushered his guest into a large room lined from floor to\r\nceiling with books and stuffed specimens. The books in question\r\nwere divided into sections--a section on forestry, a section on\r\ncattle-breeding, a section on the raising of swine, and a section on\r\nhorticulture, together with special journals of the type circulated\r\nmerely for the purposes of reference, and not for general reading.\r\nPerceiving that these works were scarcely of a kind calculated to while\r\naway an idle hour, Chichikov turned to a second bookcase. But to do so\r\nwas to fall out of the frying-pan into the fire, for the contents of the\r\nsecond bookcase proved to be works on philosophy, while, in particular,\r\nsix huge volumes confronted him under a label inscribed "A Preparatory\r\nCourse to the Province of Thought, with the Theory of Community of\r\nEffort, Co-operation, and Subsistence, in its Application to a Right\r\nUnderstanding of the Organic Principles of a Mutual Division of\r\nSocial Productivity." Indeed, wheresoever Chichikov looked, every page\r\npresented to his vision some such words as "phenomenon," "development,"\r\n"abstract," "contents," and "synopsis." "This is not the sort of thing\r\nfor me," he murmured, and turned his attention to a third bookcase,\r\nwhich contained books on the Arts. Extracting a huge tome in which some\r\nby no means reticent mythological illustrations were contained, he set\r\nhimself to examine these pictures. They were of the kind which pleases\r\nmostly middle-aged bachelors and old men who are accustomed to seek\r\nin the ballet and similar frivolities a further spur to their waning\r\npassions. Having concluded his examination, Chichikov had just extracted\r\nanother volume of the same species when Colonel Koshkarev returned with\r\na document of some sort and a radiant countenance.\r\n\r\n"Everything has been carried through in due form!" he cried. "The man\r\nwhom I mentioned is a genius indeed, and I intend not only to promote\r\nhim over the rest, but also to create for him a special Department.\r\nHerewith shall you hear what a splendid intellect is his, and how in a\r\nfew minutes he has put the whole affair in order."\r\n\r\n"May the Lord be thanked for that!" thought Chichikov. Then he settled\r\nhimself while the Colonel read aloud:\r\n\r\n"\'After giving full consideration to the Reference which your Excellency\r\nhas entrusted to me, I have the honour to report as follows:\r\n\r\n"\'(1) In the Statement of Plea presented by one Paul Ivanovitch\r\nChichikov, Gentleman, Chevalier, and Collegiate Councillor, there\r\nlurks an error, in that an oversight has led the Petitioner to apply to\r\nRevisional Souls the term "Dead." Now, from the context it would appear\r\nthat by this term the Petitioner desires to signify Souls Approaching\r\nDeath rather than Souls Actually Deceased: wherefore the term employed\r\nbetrays such an empirical instruction in letters as must, beyond doubt,\r\nhave been confined to the Village School, seeing that in truth the Soul\r\nis Deathless.\'\r\n\r\n"The rascal!" Koshkarev broke off to exclaim delightedly. "He has\r\ngot you there, Monsieur Chichikov. And you will admit that he has a\r\nsufficiently incisive pen?\r\n\r\n"\'(2) On this Estate there exist no Unmortgaged Souls whatsoever,\r\nwhether Approaching Death or Otherwise; for the reason that all Souls\r\nthereon have been pledged not only under a First Deed of Mortgage, but\r\nalso (for the sum of One Hundred and Fifty Roubles per Soul) under\r\na Second,--the village of Gurmailovka alone excepted, in that,\r\nin consequence of a Suit having been brought against Landowner\r\nPriadistchev, and of a caveat having been pronounced by the Land Court,\r\nand of such caveat having been published in No. 42 of the Gazette of\r\nMoscow, the said Village has come within the Jurisdiction of the Court\r\nAbove-Mentioned."\r\n\r\n"Why did you not tell me all this before?" cried Chichikov furiously.\r\n"Why you have kept me dancing about for nothing?"\r\n\r\n"Because it was absolutely necessary that you should view the matter\r\nthrough forms of documentary process. This is no jest on my part. The\r\ninexperienced may see things subconsciously, yet it is imperative that\r\nhe should also see them CONSCIOUSLY."\r\n\r\nBut to Chichikov\'s patience an end had come. Seizing his cap, and\r\ncasting all ceremony to the winds, he fled from the house, and rushed\r\nthrough the courtyard. As it happened, the man who had driven him\r\nthither had, warned by experience, not troubled even to take out the\r\nhorses, since he knew that such a proceeding would have entailed not\r\nonly the presentation of a Statement of Plea for fodder, but also a\r\ndelay of twenty-four hours until the Resolution granting the same should\r\nhave been passed. Nevertheless the Colonel pursued his guest to the\r\ngates, and pressed his hand warmly as he thanked him for having enabled\r\nhim (the Colonel) thus to exhibit in operation the proper management of\r\nan estate. Also, he begged to state that, under the circumstances, it\r\nwas absolutely necessary to keep things moving and circulating, since,\r\notherwise, slackness was apt to supervene, and the working of the\r\nmachine to grow rusty and feeble; but that, in spite of all, the\r\npresent occasion had inspired him with a happy idea--namely, the idea\r\nof instituting a Committee which should be entitled "The Committee of\r\nSupervision of the Committee of Management," and which should have\r\nfor its function the detection of backsliders among the body first\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nIt was late when, tired and dissatisfied, Chichikov regained\r\nKostanzhoglo\'s mansion. Indeed, the candles had long been lit.\r\n\r\n"What has delayed you?" asked the master of the house as Chichikov\r\nentered the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"Yes, what has kept you and the Colonel so long in conversation\r\ntogether?" added Platon.\r\n\r\n"This--the fact that never in my life have I come across such an\r\nimbecile," was Chichikov\'s reply.\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Kostanzhoglo. "Koshkarev is a most reassuring\r\nphenomenon. He is necessary in that in him we see expressed in\r\ncaricature all the more crying follies of our intellectuals--of the\r\nintellectuals who, without first troubling to make themselves acquainted\r\nwith their own country, borrow silliness from abroad. Yet that is\r\nhow certain of our landowners are now carrying on. They have set up\r\n\'offices\' and factories and schools and \'commissions,\' and the devil\r\nknows what else besides. A fine lot of wiseacres! After the French War\r\nin 1812 they had to reconstruct their affairs: and see how they have\r\ndone it! Yet so much worse have they done it than a Frenchman would have\r\ndone that any fool of a Peter Petrovitch Pietukh now ranks as a good\r\nlandowner!"\r\n\r\n"But he has mortgaged the whole of his estate?" remarked Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Yes, nowadays everything is being mortgaged, or is going to be." This\r\nsaid, Kostanzhoglo\'s temper rose still further. "Out upon your factories\r\nof hats and candles!" he cried. "Out upon procuring candle-makers\r\nfrom London, and then turning landowners into hucksters! To think of\r\na Russian pomiestchik [49], a member of the noblest of callings,\r\nconducting workshops and cotton mills! Why, it is for the wenches of\r\ntowns to handle looms for muslin and lace."\r\n\r\n"But you yourself maintain workshops?" remarked Platon.\r\n\r\n"I do; but who established them? They established themselves. For\r\ninstance, wool had accumulated, and since I had nowhere to store it, I\r\nbegan to weave it into cloth--but, mark you, only into good, plain cloth\r\nof which I can dispose at a cheap rate in the local markets, and which\r\nis needed by peasants, including my own. Again, for six years on end\r\ndid the fish factories keep dumping their offal on my bank of the river;\r\nwherefore, at last, as there was nothing to be done with it, I took\r\nto boiling it into glue, and cleared forty thousand roubles by the\r\nprocess."\r\n\r\n"The devil!" thought Chichikov to himself as he stared at his host.\r\n"What a fist this man has for making money!"\r\n\r\n"Another reason why I started those factories," continued Kostanzhoglo,\r\n"is that they might give employment to many peasants who would otherwise\r\nhave starved. You see, the year happened to have been a lean one--thanks\r\nto those same industry-mongering landowners, in that they had neglected\r\nto sow their crops; and now my factories keep growing at the rate of\r\na factory a year, owing to the circumstance that such quantities\r\nof remnants and cuttings become so accumulated that, if a man looks\r\ncarefully to his management, he will find every sort of rubbish to be\r\ncapable of bringing in a return--yes, to the point of his having to\r\nreject money on the plea that he has no need of it. Yet I do not find\r\nthat to do all this I require to build a mansion with facades and\r\npillars!"\r\n\r\n"Marvellous!" exclaimed Chichikov. "Beyond all things does it surprise\r\nme that refuse can be so utilised."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and that is what can be done by SIMPLE methods. But nowadays every\r\none is a mechanic, and wants to open that money chest with an instrument\r\ninstead of simply. For that purpose he hies him to England. Yes, THAT is\r\nthe thing to do. What folly!" Kostanzhoglo spat and added: "Yet when\r\nhe returns from abroad he is a hundred times more ignorant than when he\r\nwent."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Constantine," put in his wife anxiously, "you know how bad for you\r\nit is to talk like this."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but how am I to help losing my temper? The thing touches me too\r\nclosely, it vexes me too deeply to think that the Russian character\r\nshould be degenerating. For in that character there has dawned a sort of\r\nQuixotism which never used to be there. Yes, no sooner does a man get\r\na little education into his head than he becomes a Don Quixote, and\r\nestablishes schools on his estate such as even a madman would never have\r\ndreamed of. And from that school there issues a workman who is good for\r\nnothing, whether in the country or in the town--a fellow who drinks\r\nand is for ever standing on his dignity. Yet still our landowners keep\r\ntaking to philanthropy, to converting themselves into philanthropic\r\nknights-errant, and spending millions upon senseless hospitals and\r\ninstitutions, and so ruining themselves and turning their families\r\nadrift. Yes, that is all that comes of philanthropy."\r\n\r\nChichikov\'s business had nothing to do with the spread of enlightenment,\r\nhe was but seeking an opportunity to inquire further concerning the\r\nputting of refuse to lucrative uses; but Kostanzhoglo would not let\r\nhim get a word in edgeways, so irresistibly did the flow of sarcastic\r\ncomment pour from the speaker\'s lips.\r\n\r\n"Yes," went on Kostanzhoglo, "folk are always scheming to educate the\r\npeasant. But first make him well-off and a good farmer. THEN he will\r\neducate himself fast enough. As things are now, the world has grown\r\nstupid to a degree that passes belief. Look at the stuff our present-day\r\nscribblers write! Let any sort of a book be published, and at once you\r\nwill see every one making a rush for it. Similarly will you find\r\nfolk saying: \'The peasant leads an over-simple life. He ought to be\r\nfamiliarised with luxuries, and so led to yearn for things above his\r\nstation.\' And the result of such luxuries will be that the peasant will\r\nbecome a rag rather than a man, and suffer from the devil only knows\r\nwhat diseases, until there will remain in the land not a boy of eighteen\r\nwho will not have experienced the whole gamut of them, and found himself\r\nleft with not a tooth in his jaws or a hair on his pate. Yes, that is\r\nwhat will come of infecting the peasant with such rubbish. But, thank\r\nGod, there is still one healthy class left to us--a class which has\r\nnever taken up with the \'advantages\' of which I speak. For that we ought\r\nto be grateful. And since, even yet, the Russian agriculturist remains\r\nthe most respect-worthy man in the land, why should he be touched? Would\r\nto God every one were an agriculturist!"\r\n\r\n"Then you believe agriculture to be the most profitable of occupations?"\r\nsaid Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"The best, at all events--if not the most profitable. \'In the sweat\r\nof thy brow shalt thou till the land.\' To quote that requires no\r\ngreat wisdom, for the experience of ages has shown us that, in the\r\nagricultural calling, man has ever remained more moral, more pure, more\r\nnoble than in any other. Of course I do not mean to imply that no other\r\ncalling ought to be practised: simply that the calling in question lies\r\nat the root of all the rest. However much factories may be established\r\nprivately or by the law, there will still lie ready to man\'s hand all\r\nthat he needs--he will still require none of those amenities which\r\nare sapping the vitality of our present-day folk, nor any of those\r\nindustrial establishments which make their profit, and keep themselves\r\ngoing, by causing foolish measures to be adopted which, in the end,\r\nare bound to deprave and corrupt our unfortunate masses. I myself am\r\ndetermined never to establish any manufacture, however profitable,\r\nwhich will give rise to a demand for \'higher things,\' such as sugar\r\nand tobacco--no not if I lose a million by my refusing to do so. If\r\ncorruption MUST overtake the MIR, it shall not be through my hands.\r\nAnd I think that God will justify me in my resolve. Twenty years have\r\nI lived among the common folk, and I know what will inevitably come of\r\nsuch things."\r\n\r\n"But what surprises me most," persisted Chichikov, "is that from refuse\r\nit should be possible, with good management, to make such an immensity\r\nof profit."\r\n\r\n"And as for political economy," continued Kostanzhoglo, without noticing\r\nhim, and with his face charged with bilious sarcasm, "--as for political\r\neconomy, it is a fine thing indeed. Just one fool sitting on another\r\nfool\'s back, and flogging him along, even though the rider can see\r\nno further than his own nose! Yet into the saddle will that fool\r\nclimb--spectacles and all! Oh, the folly, the folly of such things!" And\r\nthe speaker spat derisively.\r\n\r\n"That may be true," said his wife. "Yet you must not get angry about it.\r\nSurely one can speak on such subjects without losing one\'s temper?"\r\n\r\n"As I listen to you, most worthy Constantine Thedorovitch," Chichikov\r\nhastened to remark, "it becomes plain to me that you have penetrated\r\ninto the meaning of life, and laid your finger upon the essential root\r\nof the matter. Yet supposing, for a moment, we leave the affairs of\r\nhumanity in general, and turn our attention to a purely individual\r\naffair, might I ask you how, in the case of a man becoming a landowner,\r\nand having a mind to grow wealthy as quickly as possible (in order that\r\nhe may fulfil his bounden obligations as a citizen), he can best set\r\nabout it?"\r\n\r\n"How he can best set about growing wealthy?" repeated Kostanzhoglo.\r\n"Why,--"\r\n\r\n"Let us go to supper," interrupted the lady of the house, rising from\r\nher chair, and moving towards the centre of the room, where she wrapped\r\nher shivering young form in a shawl. Chichikov sprang up with the\r\nalacrity of a military man, offered her his arm, and escorted her, as\r\non parade, to the dining-room, where awaiting them there was the\r\nsoup-toureen. From it the lid had just been removed, and the room was\r\nredolent of the fragrant odour of early spring roots and herbs. The\r\ncompany took their seats, and at once the servants placed the\r\nremainder of the dishes (under covers) upon the table and withdrew,\r\nfor Kostanzhoglo hated to have servants listening to their employers\'\r\nconversation, and objected still more to their staring at him all the\r\nwhile that he was eating.\r\n\r\nWhen the soup had been consumed, and glasses of an excellent vintage\r\nresembling Hungarian wine had been poured out, Chichikov said to his\r\nhost:\r\n\r\n"Most worthy sir, allow me once more to direct your attention to the\r\nsubject of which we were speaking at the point when the conversation\r\nbecame interrupted. You will remember that I was asking you how best a\r\nman can set about, proceed in, the matter of growing..."\r\n\r\n\r\n           [Here from the original two pages are missing.]\r\n\r\n\r\n... "A property for which, had he asked forty thousand, I should still\r\nhave demanded a reduction."\r\n\r\n"Hm!" thought Chichikov; then added aloud: "But why do you not purchase\r\nit yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Because to everything there must be assigned a limit. Already my\r\nproperty keeps me sufficiently employed. Moreover, I should cause our\r\nlocal dvoriane to begin crying out in chorus that I am exploiting their\r\nextremities, their ruined position, for the purpose of acquiring land\r\nfor under its value. Of that I am weary."\r\n\r\n"How readily folk speak evil!" exclaimed Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and the amount of evil-speaking in our province surpasses belief.\r\nNever will you hear my name mentioned without my being called also\r\na miser and a usurer of the worst possible sort; whereas my accusers\r\njustify themselves in everything, and say that, \'though we have wasted\r\nour money, we have started a demand for the higher amenities of life,\r\nand therefore encouraged industry with our wastefulness, a far better\r\nway of doing things than that practised by Kostanzhoglo, who lives like\r\na pig.\'"\r\n\r\n"Would _I_ could live in your \'piggish\' fashion!" ejaculated Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"And so forth, and so forth. Yet what are the \'higher amenities of\r\nlife\'? What good can they do to any one? Even if a landowner of the\r\nday sets up a library, he never looks at a single book in it, but soon\r\nrelapses into card-playing--the usual pursuit. Yet folk call me names\r\nsimply because I do not waste my means upon the giving of dinners! One\r\nreason why I do not give such dinners is that they weary me; and another\r\nreason is that I am not used to them. But come you to my house for the\r\npurpose of taking pot luck, and I shall be delighted to see you. Also,\r\nfolk foolishly say that I lend money on interest; whereas the truth is\r\nthat if you should come to me when you are really in need, and should\r\nexplain to me openly how you propose to employ my money, and I should\r\nperceive that you are purposing to use that money wisely, and that you\r\nare really likely to profit thereby--well, in that case you would find\r\nme ready to lend you all that you might ask without interest at all."\r\n\r\n"That is a thing which it is well to know," reflected Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Yes," repeated Kostanzhoglo, "under those circumstances I should never\r\nrefuse you my assistance. But I do object to throwing my money to the\r\nwinds. Pardon me for expressing myself so plainly. To think of lending\r\nmoney to a man who is merely devising a dinner for his mistress, or\r\nplanning to furnish his house like a lunatic, or thinking of taking his\r\nparamour to a masked ball or a jubilee in honour of some one who had\r\nbetter never have been born!"\r\n\r\nAnd, spitting, he came near to venting some expression which would\r\nscarcely have been becoming in the presence of his wife. Over his face\r\nthe dark shadow of hypochondria had cast a cloud, and furrows had formed\r\non his brow and temples, and his every gesture bespoke the influence of\r\na hot, nervous rancour.\r\n\r\n"But allow me once more to direct your attention to the subject of our\r\nrecently interrupted conversation," persisted Chichikov as he sipped a\r\nglass of excellent raspberry wine. "That is to say, supposing I were\r\nto acquire the property which you have been good enough to bring to my\r\nnotice, how long would it take me to grow rich?"\r\n\r\n"That would depend on yourself," replied Kostanzhoglo with grim\r\nabruptness and evident ill-humour. "You might either grow rich quickly\r\nor you might never grow rich at all. If you made up your mind to grow\r\nrich, sooner or later you would find yourself a wealthy man."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" ejaculated Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Kostanzhoglo, as sharply as though he were angry with\r\nChichikov. "You would merely need to be fond of work: otherwise you\r\nwould effect nothing. The main thing is to like looking after your\r\nproperty. Believe me, you would never grow weary of doing so. People\r\nwould have it that life in the country is dull; whereas, if I were to\r\nspend a single day as it is spent by some folk, with their stupid clubs\r\nand their restaurants and their theatres, I should die of ennui. The\r\nfools, the idiots, the generations of blind dullards! But a landowner\r\nnever finds the days wearisome--he has not the time. In his life not a\r\nmoment remains unoccupied; it is full to the brim. And with it all goes\r\nan endless variety of occupations. And what occupations! Occupations\r\nwhich genuinely uplift the soul, seeing that the landowner walks with\r\nnature and the seasons of the year, and takes part in, and is intimate\r\nwith, everything which is evolved by creation. For let us look at the\r\nround of the year\'s labours. Even before spring has arrived there will\r\nhave begun a general watching and a waiting for it, and a preparing for\r\nsowing, and an apportioning of crops, and a measuring of seed grain by\r\nbyres, and drying of seed, and a dividing of the workers into teams.\r\nFor everything needs to be examined beforehand, and calculations must be\r\nmade at the very start. And as soon as ever the ice shall have melted,\r\nand the rivers be flowing, and the land have dried sufficiently to be\r\nworkable, the spade will begin its task in kitchen and flower garden,\r\nand the plough and the harrow their tasks in the field; until everywhere\r\nthere will be tilling and sowing and planting. And do you understand\r\nwhat the sum of that labour will mean? It will mean that the harvest is\r\nbeing sown, that the welfare of the world is being sown, that the\r\nfood of millions is being put into the earth. And thereafter will come\r\nsummer, the season of reaping, endless reaping; for suddenly the crops\r\nwill have ripened, and rye-sheaf will be lying heaped upon rye-sheaf,\r\nwith, elsewhere, stocks of barley, and of oats, and of wheat. And\r\neverything will be teeming with life, and not a moment will there need\r\nto be lost, seeing that, had you even twenty eyes, you would have need\r\nfor them all. And after the harvest festivities there will be grain to\r\nbe carted to byre or stacked in ricks, and stores to be prepared for the\r\nwinter, and storehouses and kilns and cattle-sheds to be cleaned for the\r\nsame purpose, and the women to be assigned their tasks, and the totals\r\nof everything to be calculated, so that one may see the value of\r\nwhat has been done. And lastly will come winter, when in every\r\nthreshing-floor the flail will be working, and the grain, when threshed,\r\nwill need to be carried from barn to binn, and the mills require to be\r\nseen to, and the estate factories to be inspected, and the workmen\'s\r\nhuts to be visited for the purpose of ascertaining how the muzhik is\r\nfaring (for, given a carpenter who is clever with his tools, I, for one,\r\nam only too glad to spend an hour or two in his company, so cheering\r\nto me is labour). And if, in addition, one discerns the end to which\r\neverything is moving, and the manner in which the things of earth are\r\neverywhere multiplying and multiplying, and bringing forth more and more\r\nfruit to one\'s profiting, I cannot adequately express what takes\r\nplace in a man\'s soul. And that, not because of the growth in his\r\nwealth--money is money and no more--but because he will feel that\r\neverything is the work of his own hands, and that he has been the cause\r\nof everything, and its creator, and that from him, as from a magician,\r\nthere has flowed bounty and goodness for all. In what other calling will\r\nyou find such delights in prospect?" As he spoke, Kostanzhoglo raised\r\nhis face, and it became clear that the wrinkles had fled from it, and\r\nthat, like the Tsar on the solemn day of his crowning, Kostanzhoglo\'s\r\nwhole form was diffusing light, and his features had in them a gentle\r\nradiance. "In all the world," he repeated, "you will find no joys like\r\nthese, for herein man imitates the God who projected creation as the\r\nsupreme happiness, and now demands of man that he, too, should act as\r\nthe creator of prosperity. Yet there are folk who call such functions\r\ntedious!"\r\n\r\nKostanzhoglo\'s mellifluous periods fell upon Chichikov\'s ear like\r\nthe notes of a bird of paradise. From time to time he gulped, and his\r\nsoftened eyes expressed the pleasure which it gave him to listen.\r\n\r\n"Constantine, it is time to leave the table," said the lady of the\r\nhouse, rising from her seat. Every one followed her example, and\r\nChichikov once again acted as his hostess\'s escort--although with less\r\ndexterity of deportment than before, owing to the fact that this time\r\nhis thoughts were occupied with more essential matters of procedure.\r\n\r\n"In spite of what you say," remarked Platon as he walked behind the\r\npair, "I, for my part, find these things wearisome."\r\n\r\nBut the master of the house paid no attention to his remark, for he was\r\nreflecting that his guest was no fool, but a man of serious thought\r\nand speech who did not take things lightly. And, with the thought,\r\nKostanzhoglo grew lighter in soul, as though he had warmed himself with\r\nhis own words, and were exulting in the fact that he had found some one\r\ncapable of listening to good advice.\r\n\r\nWhen they had settled themselves in the cosy, candle-lighted\r\ndrawing-room, with its balcony and the glass door opening out into the\r\ngarden--a door through which the stars could be seen glittering amid the\r\nslumbering tops of the trees--Chichikov felt more comfortable than he\r\nhad done for many a day past. It was as though, after long journeying,\r\nhis own roof-tree had received him once more--had received him when\r\nhis quest had been accomplished, when all that he wished for had been\r\ngained, when his travelling-staff had been laid aside with the words "It\r\nis finished." And of this seductive frame of mind the true source had\r\nbeen the eloquent discourse of his hospitable host. Yes, for every man\r\nthere exist certain things which, instantly that they are said, seem to\r\ntouch him more closely, more intimately, than anything has done before.\r\nNor is it an uncommon occurrence that in the most unexpected fashion,\r\nand in the most retired of retreats, one will suddenly come face to face\r\nwith a man whose burning periods will lead one to forget oneself and\r\nthe tracklessness of the route and the discomfort of one\'s nightly\r\nhalting-places, and the futility of crazes and the falseness of tricks\r\nby which one human being deceives another. And at once there will become\r\nengraven upon one\'s memory--vividly, and for all time--the evening thus\r\nspent. And of that evening one\'s remembrance will hold true, both as to\r\nwho was present, and where each such person sat, and what he or she was\r\nwearing, and what the walls and the stove and other trifling features of\r\nthe room looked like.\r\n\r\nIn the same way did Chichikov note each detail that evening--both the\r\nappointments of the agreeable, but not luxuriously furnished, room, and\r\nthe good-humoured expression which reigned on the face of the thoughtful\r\nhost, and the design of the curtains, and the amber-mounted pipe smoked\r\nby Platon, and the way in which he kept puffing smoke into the fat\r\njowl of the dog Yarb, and the sneeze which, on each such occasion, Yarb\r\nvented, and the laughter of the pleasant-faced hostess (though always\r\nfollowed by the words "Pray do not tease him any more") and the cheerful\r\ncandle-light, and the cricket chirping in a corner, and the glass door,\r\nand the spring night which, laying its elbows upon the tree-tops, and\r\nspangled with stars, and vocal with the nightingales which were pouring\r\nforth warbled ditties from the recesses of the foliage, kept glancing\r\nthrough the door, and regarding the company within.\r\n\r\n"How it delights me to hear your words, good Constantine Thedorovitch!"\r\nsaid Chichikov. "Indeed, nowhere in Russia have I met with a man of\r\nequal intellect."\r\n\r\nKostanzhoglo smiled, while realising that the compliment was scarcely\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\n"If you want a man of GENUINE intellect," he said, "I can tell you of\r\none. He is a man whose boot soles are worth more than my whole body."\r\n\r\n"Who may he be?" asked Chichikov in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Murazov, our local Commissioner of Taxes."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I have heard of him before," remarked Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"He is a man who, were he not the director of an estate, might well be a\r\ndirector of the Empire. And were the Empire under my direction, I should\r\nat once appoint him my Minister of Finance."\r\n\r\n"I have heard tales beyond belief concerning him--for instance, that he\r\nhas acquired ten million roubles."\r\n\r\n"Ten? More than forty. Soon half Russia will be in his hands."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t say so?" cried Chichikov in amazement.\r\n\r\n"Yes, certainly. The man who has only a hundred thousand roubles to work\r\nwith grows rich but slowly, whereas he who has millions at his disposal\r\ncan operate over a greater radius, and so back whatsoever he undertakes\r\nwith twice or thrice the money which can be brought against him.\r\nConsequently his field becomes so spacious that he ends by having no\r\nrivals. Yes, no one can compete with him, and, whatsoever price he may\r\nfix for a given commodity, at that price it will have to remain, nor\r\nwill any man be able to outbid it."\r\n\r\n"My God!" muttered Chichikov, crossing himself, and staring at\r\nKostanzhoglo with his breath catching in his throat. "The mind cannot\r\ngrasp it--it petrifies one\'s thoughts with awe. You see folk marvelling\r\nat what Science has achieved in the matter of investigating the habits\r\nof cowbugs, but to me it is a far more marvellous thing that in the\r\nhands of a single mortal there can become accumulated such gigantic sums\r\nof money. But may I ask whether the great fortune of which you speak has\r\nbeen acquired through honest means?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; through means of the most irreproachable kind--through the most\r\nhonourable of methods."\r\n\r\n"Yet so improbable does it seem that I can scarcely believe it.\r\nThousands I could understand, but millions--!"\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, to make thousands honestly is a far more difficult\r\nmatter than to make millions. Millions are easily come by, for a\r\nmillionaire has no need to resort to crooked ways; the way lies straight\r\nbefore him, and he needs but to annex whatsoever he comes across. No\r\nrival will spring up to oppose him, for no rival will be sufficiently\r\nstrong, and since the millionaire can operate over an extensive radius,\r\nhe can bring (as I have said) two or three roubles to bear upon any one\r\nelse\'s one. Consequently, what interest will he derive from a thousand\r\nroubles? Why, ten or twenty per cent. at the least."\r\n\r\n"And it is beyond measure marvellous that the whole should have started\r\nfrom a single kopeck."\r\n\r\n"Had it started otherwise, the thing could never have been done at all.\r\nSuch is the normal course. He who is born with thousands, and is brought\r\nup to thousands, will never acquire a single kopeck more, for he will\r\nhave been set up with the amenities of life in advance, and so never\r\ncome to stand in need of anything. It is necessary to begin from the\r\nbeginning rather than from the middle; from a kopeck rather than from a\r\nrouble; from the bottom rather than from the top. For only thus will a\r\nman get to know the men and conditions among which his career will have\r\nto be carved. That is to say, through encountering the rough and the\r\ntumble of life, and through learning that every kopeck has to be beaten\r\nout with a three-kopeck nail, and through worsting knave after knave, he\r\nwill acquire such a degree of perspicuity and wariness that he will err\r\nin nothing which he may tackle, and never come to ruin. Believe me, it\r\nis so. The beginning, and not the middle, is the right starting point.\r\nNo one who comes to me and says, \'Give me a hundred thousand roubles,\r\nand I will grow rich in no time,\' do I believe, for he is likely to meet\r\nwith failure rather than with the success of which he is so assured.\r\n\'Tis with a kopeck, and with a kopeck only, that a man must begin."\r\n\r\n"If that is so, _I_ shall grow rich," said Chichikov, involuntarily\r\nremembering the dead souls. "For of a surety _I_ began with nothing."\r\n\r\n"Constantine, pray allow Paul Ivanovitch to retire to rest," put in\r\nthe lady of the house. "It is high time, and I am sure you have talked\r\nenough."\r\n\r\n"Yes, beyond a doubt you will grow rich," continued Kostanzhoglo,\r\nwithout heeding his wife. "For towards you there will run rivers and\r\nrivers of gold, until you will not know what to do with all your gains."\r\n\r\nAs though spellbound, Chichikov sat in an aureate world of ever-growing\r\ndreams and fantasies. All his thoughts were in a whirl, and on a carpet\r\nof future wealth his tumultuous imagination was weaving golden patterns,\r\nwhile ever in his ears were ringing the words, "towards you there will\r\nrun rivers and rivers of gold."\r\n\r\n"Really, Constantine, DO allow Paul Ivanovitch to go to bed."\r\n\r\n"What on earth is the matter?" retorted the master of the household\r\ntestily. "Pray go yourself if you wish to." Then he stopped short, for\r\nthe snoring of Platon was filling the whole room, and also--outrivalling\r\nit--that of the dog Yarb. This caused Kostanzhoglo to realise that\r\nbedtime really had arrived; wherefore, after he had shaken Platon out\r\nof his slumbers, and bidden Chichikov good night, all dispersed to their\r\nseveral chambers, and became plunged in sleep.\r\n\r\nAll, that is to say, except Chichikov, whose thoughts remained wakeful,\r\nand who kept wondering and wondering how best he could become the owner,\r\nnot of a fictitious, but of a real, estate. The conversation with\r\nhis host had made everything clear, had made the possibility of\r\nhis acquiring riches manifest, had made the difficult art of estate\r\nmanagement at once easy and understandable; until it would seem as\r\nthough particularly was his nature adapted for mastering the art in\r\nquestion. All that he would need to do would be to mortgage the dead\r\nsouls, and then to set up a genuine establishment. Already he\r\nsaw himself acting and administering as Kostanzhoglo had advised\r\nhim--energetically, and through personal oversight, and undertaking\r\nnothing new until the old had been thoroughly learned, and viewing\r\neverything with his own eyes, and making himself familiar with each\r\nmember of his peasantry, and abjuring all superfluities, and giving\r\nhimself up to hard work and husbandry. Yes, already could he taste the\r\npleasure which would be his when he had built up a complete industrial\r\norganisation, and the springs of the industrial machine were in vigorous\r\nworking order, and each had become able to reinforce the other. Labour\r\nshould be kept in active operation, and, even as, in a mill, flour comes\r\nflowing from grain, so should cash, and yet more cash, come flowing from\r\nevery atom of refuse and remnant. And all the while he could see before\r\nhim the landowner who was one of the leading men in Russia, and for whom\r\nhe had conceived such an unbounded respect. Hitherto only for rank or\r\nfor opulence had Chichikov respected a man--never for mere intellectual\r\npower; but now he made a first exception in favour of Kostanzhoglo,\r\nseeing that he felt that nothing undertaken by his host could possibly\r\ncome to naught. And another project which was occupying Chichikov\'s mind\r\nwas the project of purchasing the estate of a certain landowner named\r\nKhlobuev. Already Chichikov had at his disposal ten thousand roubles,\r\nand a further fifteen thousand he would try and borrow of Kostanzhoglo\r\n(seeing that the latter had himself said that he was prepared to help\r\nany one who really desired to grow rich); while, as for the remainder,\r\nhe would either raise the sum by mortgaging the estate or force Khlobuev\r\nto wait for it--just to tell him to resort to the courts if such might\r\nbe his pleasure.\r\n\r\nLong did our hero ponder the scheme; until at length the slumber which\r\nhad, these four hours past, been holding the rest of the household in\r\nits embraces enfolded also Chichikov, and he sank into oblivion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nNext day, with Platon and Constantine, Chichikov set forth to interview\r\nKhlobuev, the owner whose estate Constantine had consented to help\r\nChichikov to purchase with a non-interest-bearing, uncovenanted loan of\r\nten thousand roubles. Naturally, our hero was in the highest of spirits.\r\nFor the first fifteen versts or so the road led through forest land and\r\ntillage belonging to Platon and his brother-in-law; but directly the\r\nlimit of these domains was reached, forest land began to be replaced\r\nwith swamp, and tillage with waste. Also, the village in Khlobuev\'s\r\nestate had about it a deserted air, and as for the proprietor himself,\r\nhe was discovered in a state of drowsy dishevelment, having not long\r\nleft his bed. A man of about forty, he had his cravat crooked, his\r\nfrockcoat adorned with a large stain, and one of his boots worn through.\r\nNevertheless he seemed delighted to see his visitors.\r\n\r\n"What?" he exclaimed. "Constantine Thedorovitch and Platon Mikhalitch?\r\nReally I must rub my eyes! Never again in this world did I look to see\r\ncallers arriving. As a rule, folk avoid me like the devil, for they\r\ncannot disabuse their minds of the idea that I am going to ask them for\r\na loan. Yes, it is my own fault, I know, but what would you? To the end\r\nwill swine cheat swine. Pray excuse my costume. You will observe that my\r\nboots are in holes. But how can I afford to get them mended?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Constantine. "We have come on business only. May I\r\npresent to you a possible purchaser of your estate, in the person of\r\nPaul Ivanovitch Chichikov?"\r\n\r\n"I am indeed glad to meet you!" was Khlobuev\'s response. "Pray shake\r\nhands with me, Paul Ivanovitch."\r\n\r\nChichikov offered one hand, but not both.\r\n\r\n"I can show you a property worth your attention," went on the master of\r\nthe estate. "May I ask if you have yet dined?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, we have," put in Constantine, desirous of escaping as soon as\r\npossible. "To save you further trouble, let us go and view the estate at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"Very well," replied Khlobuev. "Pray come and inspect my irregularities\r\nand futilities. You have done well to dine beforehand, for not so much\r\nas a fowl is left in the place, so dire are the extremities to which you\r\nsee me reduced."\r\n\r\nSighing deeply, he took Platon by the arm (it was clear that he did\r\nnot look for any sympathy from Constantine) and walked ahead, while\r\nConstantine and Chichikov followed.\r\n\r\n"Things are going hard with me, Platon Mikhalitch," continued Khlobuev.\r\n"How hard you cannot imagine. No money have I, no food, no boots. Were\r\nI still young and a bachelor, it would have come easy to me to live on\r\nbread and cheese; but when a man is growing old, and has got a wife\r\nand five children, such trials press heavily upon him, and, in spite of\r\nhimself, his spirits sink."\r\n\r\n"But, should you succeed in selling the estate, that would help to put\r\nyou right, would it not?" said Platon.\r\n\r\n"How could it do so?" replied Khlobuev with a despairing gesture. "What\r\nI might get for the property would have to go towards discharging my\r\ndebts, and I should find myself left with less than a thousand roubles\r\nbesides."\r\n\r\n"Then what do you intend to do?"\r\n\r\n"God knows."\r\n\r\n"But is there NOTHING to which you could set your hand in order to clear\r\nyourself of your difficulties?"\r\n\r\n"How could there be?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you might accept a Government post."\r\n\r\n"Become a provincial secretary, you mean? How could I obtain such a\r\npost? They would not offer me one of the meanest possible kind. Even\r\nsupposing that they did, how could I live on a salary of five hundred\r\nroubles--I who have a wife and five children?"\r\n\r\n"Then try and obtain a bailiff\'s post."\r\n\r\n"Who would entrust their property to a man who has squandered his own\r\nestate?"\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, when death and destitution threaten, a man must either\r\ndo something or starve. Shall I ask my brother to use his influence to\r\nprocure you a post?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, Platon Mikhalitch," sighed Khlobuev, gripping the other\'s hand.\r\n"I am no longer serviceable--I am grown old before my time, and find\r\nthat liver and rheumatism are paying me for the sins of my youth. Why\r\nshould the Government be put to a loss on my account?--not to speak of\r\nthe fact that for every salaried post there are countless numbers of\r\napplicants. God forbid that, in order to provide me with a livelihood\r\nfurther burdens should be imposed upon an impoverished public!"\r\n\r\n"Such are the results of improvident management!" thought Platon to\r\nhimself. "The disease is even worse than my slothfulness."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Kostanzhoglo, walking by Chichikov\'s side, was almost taking\r\nleave of his senses.\r\n\r\n"Look at it!" he cried with a wave of his hand. "See to what\r\nwretchedness the peasant has become reduced! Should cattle disease come,\r\nKhlobuev will have nothing to fall back upon, but will be forced to sell\r\nhis all--to leave the peasant without a horse, and therefore without the\r\nmeans to labour, even though the loss of a single day\'s work may take\r\nyears of labour to rectify. Meanwhile it is plain that the local peasant\r\nhas become a mere dissolute, lazy drunkard. Give a muzhik enough to live\r\nupon for twelve months without working, and you will corrupt him for\r\never, so inured to rags and vagrancy will he grow. And what is the good\r\nof that piece of pasture there--of that piece on the further side of\r\nthose huts? It is a mere flooded tract. Were it mine, I should put\r\nit under flax, and clear five thousand roubles, or else sow it with\r\nturnips, and clear, perhaps, four thousand. And see how the rye is\r\ndrooping, and nearly laid. As for wheat, I am pretty sure that he has\r\nnot sown any. Look, too, at those ravines! Were they mine, they would\r\nbe standing under timber which even a rook could not top. To think of\r\nwasting such quantities of land! Where land wouldn\'t bear corn, I should\r\ndig it up, and plant it with vegetables. What ought to be done is that\r\nKhlobuev ought to take a spade into his own hands, and to set his wife\r\nand children and servants to do the same; and even if they died of the\r\nexertion, they would at least die doing their duty, and not through\r\nguzzling at the dinner table."\r\n\r\nThis said, Kostanzhoglo spat, and his brow flushed with grim\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\nPresently they reached an elevation whence the distant flashing of a\r\nriver, with its flood waters and subsidiary streams, caught the eye,\r\nwhile, further off, a portion of General Betristchev\'s homestead could\r\nbe discerned among the trees, and, over it, a blue, densely wooded hill\r\nwhich Chichikov guessed to be the spot where Tientietnikov\'s mansion was\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\n"This is where I should plant timber," said Chichikov. "And, regarded\r\nas a site for a manor house, the situation could scarcely be beaten for\r\nbeauty of view."\r\n\r\n"You seem to get great store upon views and beauty," remarked\r\nKostanzhoglo with reproof in his tone. "Should you pay too much\r\nattention to those things, you might find yourself without crops or\r\nview. Utility should be placed first, not beauty. Beauty will come of\r\nitself. Take, for example, towns. The fairest and most beautiful towns\r\nare those which have built themselves--those in which each man has built\r\nto suit his own exclusive circumstances and needs; whereas towns which\r\nmen have constructed on regular, string-taut lines are no better than\r\ncollections of barracks. Put beauty aside, and look only to what is\r\nNECESSARY."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but to me it would always be irksome to have to wait. All the time\r\nthat I was doing so I should be hungering to see in front of me the\r\nsort of prospect which I prefer."\r\n\r\n"Come, come! Are you a man of twenty-five--you who have served as a\r\ntchinovnik in St. Petersburg? Have patience, have patience. For six\r\nyears work, and work hard. Plant, sow, and dig the earth without taking\r\na moment\'s rest. It will be difficult, I know--yes, difficult indeed;\r\nbut at the end of that time, if you have thoroughly stirred the soil,\r\nthe land will begin to help you as nothing else can do. That is to say,\r\nover and above your seventy or so pairs of hands, there will begin to\r\nassist in the work seven hundred pairs of hands which you cannot see.\r\nThus everything will be multiplied tenfold. I myself have ceased even\r\nto have to lift a finger, for whatsoever needs to be done gets done of\r\nitself. Nature loves patience: always remember that. It is a law given\r\nher of God Himself, who has blessed all those who are strong to endure."\r\n\r\n"To hear your words is to be both encouraged and strengthened," said\r\nChichikov. To this Kostanzhoglo made no reply, but presently went on:\r\n\r\n"And see how that piece of land has been ploughed! To stay here longer\r\nis more than I can do. For me, to have to look upon such want of\r\norderliness and foresight is death. Finish your business with Khlobuev\r\nwithout me, and whatsoever you do, get this treasure out of that fool\'s\r\nhands as quickly as possible, for he is dishonouring God\'s gifts."\r\n\r\nAnd Kostanzhoglo, his face dark with the rage that was seething in\r\nhis excitable soul, left Chichikov, and caught up the owner of the\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\n"What, Constantine Thedorovitch?" cried Khlobuev in astonishment. "Just\r\narrived, you are going already?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I cannot help it; urgent business requires me at home." And\r\nentering his gig, Kostanzhoglo drove rapidly away. Somehow Khlobuev\r\nseemed to divine the cause of his sudden departure.\r\n\r\n"It was too much for him," he remarked. "An agriculturist of that\r\nkind does not like to have to look upon the results of such feckless\r\nmanagement as mine. Would you believe it, Paul Ivanovitch, but this year\r\nI have been unable to sow any wheat! Am I not a fine husbandman? There\r\nwas no seed for the purpose, nor yet anything with which to prepare the\r\nground. No, I am not like Constantine Thedorovitch, who, I hear, is a\r\nperfect Napoleon in his particular line. Again and again the thought\r\noccurs to me, \'Why has so much intellect been put into that head, and\r\nonly a drop or two into my own dull pate?\' Take care of that puddle,\r\ngentlemen. I have told my peasants to lay down planks for the spring,\r\nbut they have not done so. Nevertheless my heart aches for the poor\r\nfellows, for they need a good example, and what sort of an example am I?\r\nHow am _I_ to give them orders? Pray take them under your charge, Paul\r\nIvanovitch, for I cannot teach them orderliness and method when I myself\r\nlack both. As a matter of fact, I should have given them their freedom\r\nlong ago, had there been any use in my doing so; for even I can see that\r\npeasants must first be afforded the means of earning a livelihood before\r\nthey can live. What they need is a stern, yet just, master who shall\r\nlive with them, day in, day out, and set them an example of tireless\r\nenergy. The present-day Russian--I know of it myself--is helpless\r\nwithout a driver. Without one he falls asleep, and the mould grows over\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Yet I cannot understand WHY he should fall asleep and grow mouldy in\r\nthat fashion," said Platon. "Why should he need continual surveillance\r\nto keep him from degenerating into a drunkard and a good-for-nothing?"\r\n\r\n"The cause is lack of enlightenment," said Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Possibly--only God knows. Yet enlightenment has reached us right\r\nenough. Do we not attend university lectures and everything else that\r\nis befitting? Take my own education. I learnt not only the usual things,\r\nbut also the art of spending money upon the latest refinement, the\r\nlatest amenity--the art of familiarising oneself with whatsoever money\r\ncan buy. How, then, can it be said that I was educated foolishly? And\r\nmy comrades\' education was the same. A few of them succeeded in annexing\r\nthe cream of things, for the reason that they had the wit to do so, and\r\nthe rest spent their time in doing their best to ruin their health and\r\nsquander their money. Often I think there is no hope for the present-day\r\nRussian. While desiring to do everything, he accomplishes nothing. One\r\nday he will scheme to begin a new mode of existence, a new dietary; yet\r\nbefore evening he will have so over-eaten himself as to be unable to\r\nspeak or do aught but sit staring like an owl. The same with every one."\r\n\r\n"Quite so," agreed Chichikov with a smile. "\'Tis everywhere the same\r\nstory."\r\n\r\n"To tell the truth, we are not born to common sense. I doubt whether\r\nRussia has ever produced a really sensible man. For my own part, if I\r\nsee my neighbour living a regular life, and making money, and saving\r\nit, I begin to distrust him, and to feel certain that in old age, if not\r\nbefore, he too will be led astray by the devil--led astray in a moment.\r\nYes, whether or not we be educated, there is something we lack. But what\r\nthat something is passes my understanding."\r\n\r\nOn the return journey the prospect was the same as before. Everywhere\r\nthe same slovenliness, the same disorder, was displaying itself\r\nunadorned: the only difference being that a fresh puddle had formed in\r\nthe middle of the village street. This want and neglect was noticeable\r\nin the peasants\' quarters equally with the quarters of the barin. In\r\nthe village a furious woman in greasy sackcloth was beating a poor young\r\nwench within an ace of her life, and at the same time devoting some\r\nthird person to the care of all the devils in hell; further away\r\na couple of peasants were stoically contemplating the virago--one\r\nscratching his rump as he did so, and the other yawning. The same yawn\r\nwas discernible in the buildings, for not a roof was there but had a\r\ngaping hole in it. As he gazed at the scene Platon himself yawned. Patch\r\nwas superimposed upon patch, and, in place of a roof, one hut had a\r\npiece of wooden fencing, while its crumbling window-frames were stayed\r\nwith sticks purloined from the barin\'s barn. Evidently the system\r\nof upkeep in vogue was the system employed in the case of Trishkin\'s\r\ncoat--the system of cutting up the cuffs and the collar into mendings\r\nfor the elbows.\r\n\r\n"No, I do not admire your way of doing things," was Chichikov\'s unspoken\r\ncomment when the inspection had been concluded and the party had\r\nre-entered the house. Everywhere in the latter the visitors were\r\nstruck with the way in which poverty went with glittering, fashionable\r\nprofusion. On a writing-table lay a volume of Shakespeare, and, on an\r\noccasional table, a carved ivory back-scratcher. The hostess, too, was\r\nelegantly and fashionably attired, and devoted her whole conversation\r\nto the town and the local theatre. Lastly, the children--bright, merry\r\nlittle things--were well-dressed both as regards boys and girls. Yet\r\nfar better would it have been for them if they had been clad in plain\r\nstriped smocks, and running about the courtyard like peasant children.\r\nPresently a visitor arrived in the shape of a chattering, gossiping\r\nwoman; whereupon the hostess carried her off to her own portion of the\r\nhouse, and, the children following them, the men found themselves alone.\r\n\r\n"How much do you want for the property?" asked Chichikov of Khlobuev.\r\n"I am afraid I must request you to name the lowest possible sum, since I\r\nfind the estate in a far worse condition than I had expected to do."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it IS in a terrible state," agreed Khlobuev. "Nor is that the\r\nwhole of the story. That is to say, I will not conceal from you the fact\r\nthat, out of a hundred souls registered at the last revision, only fifty\r\nsurvive, so terrible have been the ravages of cholera. And of these,\r\nagain, some have absconded; wherefore they too must be reckoned as dead,\r\nseeing that, were one to enter process against them, the costs would\r\nend in the property having to pass en bloc to the legal authorities.\r\nFor these reasons I am asking only thirty-five thousand roubles for the\r\nestate."\r\n\r\nChichikov (it need hardly be said) started to haggle.\r\n\r\n"Thirty-five thousand?" he cried. "Come, come! Surely you will accept\r\nTWENTY-five thousand?"\r\n\r\nThis was too much for Platon\'s conscience.\r\n\r\n"Now, now, Paul Ivanovitch!" he exclaimed. "Take the property at the\r\nprice named, and have done with it. The estate is worth at least that\r\namount--so much so that, should you not be willing to give it, my\r\nbrother-in-law and I will club together to effect the purchase."\r\n\r\n"That being so," said Chichikov, taken aback, "I beg to agree to the\r\nprice in question. At the same time, I must ask you to allow me to defer\r\npayment of one-half of the purchase money until a year from now."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Paul Ivanovitch. Under no circumstances could I do that. Pay\r\nme half now, and the rest in... [50] You see, I need the money for the\r\nredemption of the mortgage."\r\n\r\n"That places me in a difficulty," remarked Chichikov. "Ten thousand\r\nroubles is all that at the moment I have available." As a matter of\r\nfact, this was not true, seeing that, counting also the money which he\r\nhad borrowed of Kostanzhoglo, he had at his disposal TWENTY thousand.\r\nHis real reason for hesitating was that he disliked the idea of making\r\nso large a payment in a lump sum.\r\n\r\n"I must repeat my request, Paul Ivanovitch," said Khlobuev, "--namely,\r\nthat you pay me at least fifteen thousand immediately."\r\n\r\n"The odd five thousand _I_ will lend you," put in Platon to Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" exclaimed Chichikov as he reflected: "So he also lends money!"\r\n\r\nIn the end Chichikov\'s dispatch-box was brought from the koliaska, and\r\nKhlobuev received thence ten thousand roubles, together with a promise\r\nthat the remaining five thousand should be forthcoming on the morrow;\r\nthough the promise was given only after Chichikov had first proposed\r\nthat THREE thousand should be brought on the day named, and the rest\r\nbe left over for two or three days longer, if not for a still more\r\nprotracted period. The truth was that Paul Ivanovitch hated parting with\r\nmoney. No matter how urgent a situation might have been, he would still\r\nhave preferred to pay a sum to-morrow rather than to-day. In other\r\nwords, he acted as we all do, for we all like keeping a petitioner\r\nwaiting. "Let him rub his back in the hall for a while," we say. "Surely\r\nhe can bide his time a little?" Yet of the fact that every hour may be\r\nprecious to the poor wretch, and that his business may suffer from\r\nthe delay, we take no account. "Good sir," we say, "pray come again\r\nto-morrow. To-day I have no time to spare you."\r\n\r\n"Where do you intend henceforth to live?" inquired Platon. "Have you any\r\nother property to which you can retire?"\r\n\r\n"No," replied Khlobuev. "I shall remove to the town, where I possess\r\na small villa. That would have been necessary, in any case, for the\r\nchildren\'s sake. You see, they must have instruction in God\'s word, and\r\nalso lessons in music and dancing; and not for love or money can these\r\nthings be procured in the country.\r\n\r\n"Nothing to eat, yet dancing lessons for his children!" reflected\r\nChichikov.\r\n\r\n"An extraordinary man!" was Platon\'s unspoken comment.\r\n\r\n"However, we must contrive to wet our bargain somehow," continued\r\nKhlobuev. "Hi, Kirushka! Bring that bottle of champagne."\r\n\r\n"Nothing to eat, yet champagne to drink!" reflected Chichikov. As for\r\nPlaton, he did not know WHAT to think.\r\n\r\nIn Khlobuev\'s eyes it was de rigueur that he should provide a guest with\r\nchampagne; but, though he had sent to the town for some, he had been met\r\nwith a blank refusal to forward even a bottle of kvass on credit.\r\nOnly the discovery of a French dealer who had recently transferred his\r\nbusiness from St. Petersburg, and opened a connection on a system\r\nof general credit, saved the situation by placing Khlobuev under the\r\nobligation of patronising him.\r\n\r\nThe company drank three glassfuls apiece, and so grew more cheerful.\r\nIn particular did Khlobuev expand, and wax full of civility and\r\nfriendliness, and scatter witticisms and anecdotes to right and left.\r\nWhat knowledge of men and the world did his utterances display! How well\r\nand accurately could he divine things! With what appositeness did he\r\nsketch the neighbouring landowners! How clearly he exposed their\r\nfaults and failings! How thoroughly he knew the story of certain ruined\r\ngentry--the story of how, why, and through what cause they had fallen\r\nupon evil days! With what comic originality could he describe their\r\nlittle habits and customs!\r\n\r\nIn short, his guests found themselves charmed with his discourse, and\r\nfelt inclined to vote him a man of first-rate intellect.\r\n\r\n"What most surprises me," said Chichikov, "is how, in view of your\r\nability, you come to be so destitute of means or resources."\r\n\r\n"But I have plenty of both," said Khlobuev, and with that went on to\r\ndeliver himself of a perfect avalanche of projects. Yet those projects\r\nproved to be so uncouth, so clumsy, so little the outcome of a knowledge\r\nof men and things, that his hearers could only shrug their shoulders and\r\nmentally exclaim: "Good Lord! What a difference between worldly wisdom\r\nand the capacity to use it!" In every case the projects in question were\r\nbased upon the imperative necessity of at once procuring from somewhere\r\ntwo hundred--or at least one hundred--thousand roubles. That done (so\r\nKhlobuev averred), everything would fall into its proper place,\r\nthe holes in his pockets would become stopped, his income would be\r\nquadrupled, and he would find himself in a position to liquidate his\r\ndebts in full. Nevertheless he ended by saying: "What would you advise\r\nme to do? I fear that the philanthropist who would lend me two hundred\r\nthousand roubles or even a hundred thousand, does not exist. It is not\r\nGod\'s will that he should."\r\n\r\n"Good gracious!" inwardly ejaculated Chichikov. "To suppose that God\r\nwould send such a fool two hundred thousand roubles!"\r\n\r\n"However," went on Khlobuev, "I possess an aunt worth three millions--a\r\npious old woman who gives freely to churches and monasteries, but finds\r\na difficulty in helping her neighbour. At the same time, she is a lady\r\nof the old school, and worth having a peep at. Her canaries alone\r\nnumber four hundred, and, in addition, there is an army of pug-dogs,\r\nhangers-on, and servants. Even the youngest of the servants is sixty,\r\nbut she calls them all \'young fellows,\' and if a guest happens to offend\r\nher during dinner, she orders them to leave him out when handing out the\r\ndishes. THERE\'S a woman for you!"\r\n\r\nPlaton laughed.\r\n\r\n"And what may her family name be?" asked Chichikov. "And where does she\r\nlive?"\r\n\r\n"She lives in the county town, and her name is Alexandra Ivanovna\r\nKhanasarov."\r\n\r\n"Then why do you not apply to her?" asked Platon earnestly. "It seems\r\nto me that, once she realised the position of your family, she could not\r\npossibly refuse you."\r\n\r\n"Alas! nothing is to be looked for from that quarter," replied Khlobuev.\r\n"My aunt is of a very stubborn disposition--a perfect stone of a woman.\r\nMoreover, she has around her a sufficient band of favourites already.\r\nIn particular is there a fellow who is aiming for a Governorship, and\r\nto that end has managed to insinuate himself into the circle of her\r\nkinsfolk. By the way," the speaker added, turning to Platon, "would you\r\ndo me a favour? Next week I am giving a dinner to the associated guilds\r\nof the town."\r\n\r\nPlaton stared. He had been unaware that both in our capitals and in\r\nour provincial towns there exists a class of men whose lives are\r\nan enigma--men who, though they will seem to have exhausted their\r\nsubstance, and to have become enmeshed in debt, will suddenly be\r\nreported as in funds, and on the point of giving a dinner! And though,\r\nat this dinner, the guests will declare that the festival is bound to\r\nbe their host\'s last fling, and that for a certainty he will be haled to\r\nprison on the morrow, ten years or more will elapse, and the rascal will\r\nstill be at liberty, even though, in the meanwhile, his debts will have\r\nincreased!\r\n\r\nIn the same way did the conduct of Khlobuev\'s menage afford a curious\r\nphenomenon, for one day the house would be the scene of a solemn Te\r\nDeum, performed by a priest in vestments, and the next of a stage play\r\nperformed by a troupe of French actors in theatrical costume. Again,\r\none day would see not a morsel of bread in the house, and the next day a\r\nbanquet and generous largesse given to a party of artists and sculptors.\r\nDuring these seasons of scarcity (sufficiently severe to have led any\r\none but Khlobuev to seek suicide by hanging or shooting), the master of\r\nthe house would be preserved from rash action by his strongly religious\r\ndisposition, which, contriving in some curious way to conform with his\r\nirregular mode of life, enabled him to fall back upon reading the lives\r\nof saints, ascetics, and others of the type which has risen superior to\r\nits misfortunes. And at such times his spirit would become softened, his\r\nthoughts full of gentleness, and his eyes wet with tears; he would fall\r\nto saying his prayers, and invariably some strange coincidence would\r\nbring an answer thereto in the shape of an unexpected measure of\r\nassistance. That is to say, some former friend of his would remember\r\nhim, and send him a trifle in the way of money; or else some female\r\nvisitor would be moved by his story to let her impulsive, generous heart\r\nproffer him a handsome gift; or else a suit whereof tidings had never\r\neven reached his ears would end by being decided in his favour. And when\r\nthat happened he would reverently acknowledge the immensity of the mercy\r\nof Providence, gratefully tender thanksgiving for the same, and betake\r\nhimself again to his irregular mode of existence.\r\n\r\n"Somehow I feel sorry for the man," said Platon when he and Chichikov\r\nhad taken leave of their host, and left the house.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so, but he is a hopeless prodigal," replied the other.\r\n"Personally I find it impossible to compassionate such fellows."\r\n\r\nAnd with that the pair ceased to devote another thought to Khlobuev. In\r\nthe case of Platon, this was because he contemplated the fortunes of his\r\nfellows with the lethargic, half-somnolent eye which he turned upon all\r\nthe rest of the world; for though the sight of distress of others would\r\ncause his heart to contract and feel full of sympathy, the impression\r\nthus produced never sank into the depths of his being. Accordingly,\r\nbefore many minutes were over he had ceased to bestow a single thought\r\nupon his late host. With Chichikov, however, things were different.\r\nWhereas Platon had ceased to think of Khlobuev no more than he had\r\nceased to think of himself, Chichikov\'s mind had strayed elsewhere,\r\nfor the reason that it had become taken up with grave meditation on the\r\nsubject of the purchase just made. Suddenly finding himself no longer\r\na fictitious proprietor, but the owner of a real, an actually existing,\r\nestate, he became contemplative, and his plans and ideas assumed such a\r\nserious vein as imparted to his features an unconsciously important air.\r\n\r\n"Patience and hard work!" he muttered to himself. "The thing will not be\r\ndifficult, for with those two requisites I have been familiar from the\r\ndays of my swaddling clothes. Yes, no novelty will they be to me. Yet,\r\nin middle age, shall I be able to compass the patience whereof I was\r\ncapable in my youth?"\r\n\r\nHowever, no matter how he regarded the future, and no matter from what\r\npoint of view he considered his recent acquisition, he could see nothing\r\nbut advantage likely to accrue from the bargain. For one thing, he might\r\nbe able to proceed so that, first the whole of the estate should be\r\nmortgaged, and then the better portions of land sold outright. Or he\r\nmight so contrive matters as to manage the property for a while\r\n(and thus become a landowner like Kostanzhoglo, whose advice, as his\r\nneighbour and his benefactor, he intended always to follow), and then to\r\ndispose of the property by private treaty (provided he did not wish to\r\ncontinue his ownership), and still to retain in his hands the dead and\r\nabandoned souls. And another possible coup occurred to his mind. That is\r\nto say, he might contrive to withdraw from the district without having\r\nrepaid Kostanzhoglo at all! Truly a splendid idea! Yet it is only fair\r\nto say that the idea was not one of Chichikov\'s own conception. Rather,\r\nit had presented itself--mocking, laughing, and winking--unbidden. Yet\r\nthe impudent, the wanton thing! Who is the procreator of suddenly\r\nborn ideas of the kind? The thought that he was now a real, an actual,\r\nproprietor instead of a fictitious--that he was now a proprietor of real\r\nland, real rights of timber and pasture, and real serfs who existed not\r\nonly in the imagination, but also in veritable actuality--greatly elated\r\nour hero. So he took to dancing up and down in his seat, to rubbing\r\nhis hands together, to winking at himself, to holding his fist,\r\ntrumpet-wise, to his mouth (while making believe to execute a march),\r\nand even to uttering aloud such encouraging nicknames and phrases as\r\n"bulldog" and "little fat capon." Then suddenly recollecting that he\r\nwas not alone, he hastened to moderate his behaviour and endeavoured to\r\nstifle the endless flow of his good spirits; with the result that when\r\nPlaton, mistaking certain sounds for utterances addressed to himself,\r\ninquired what his companion had said, the latter retained the presence\r\nof mind to reply "Nothing."\r\n\r\nPresently, as Chichikov gazed about him, he saw that for some time past\r\nthe koliaska had been skirting a beautiful wood, and that on either side\r\nthe road was bordered with an edging of birch trees, the tenderly-green,\r\nrecently-opened leaves of which caused their tall, slender trunks to\r\nshow up with the whiteness of a snowdrift. Likewise nightingales were\r\nwarbling from the recesses of the foliage, and some wood tulips were\r\nglowing yellow in the grass. Next (and almost before Chichikov had\r\nrealised how he came to be in such a beautiful spot when, but a moment\r\nbefore, there had been visible only open fields) there glimmered among\r\nthe trees the stony whiteness of a church, with, on the further side\r\nof it, the intermittent, foliage-buried line of a fence; while from the\r\nupper end of a village street there was advancing to meet the vehicle a\r\ngentleman with a cap on his head, a knotted cudgel in his hands, and a\r\nslender-limbed English dog by his side.\r\n\r\n"This is my brother," said Platon. "Stop, coachman." And he descended\r\nfrom the koliaska, while Chichikov followed his example. Yarb and the\r\nstrange dog saluted one another, and then the active, thin-legged,\r\nslender-tongued Azor relinquished his licking of Yarb\'s blunt jowl,\r\nlicked Platon\'s hands instead, and, leaping upon Chichikov, slobbered\r\nright into his ear.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers embraced.\r\n\r\n"Really, Platon," said the gentleman (whose name was Vassili), "what do\r\nyou mean by treating me like this?"\r\n\r\n"How so?" said Platon indifferently.\r\n\r\n"What? For three days past I have seen and heard nothing of you! A groom\r\nfrom Pietukh\'s brought your cob home, and told me you had departed on an\r\nexpedition with some barin. At least you might have sent me word as to\r\nyour destination and the probable length of your absence. What made you\r\nact so? God knows what I have not been wondering!"\r\n\r\n"Does it matter?" rejoined Platon. "I forgot to send you word, and we\r\nhave been no further than Constantine\'s (who, with our sister, sends you\r\nhis greeting). By the way, may I introduce Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov?"\r\n\r\nThe pair shook hands with one another. Then, doffing their caps, they\r\nembraced.\r\n\r\n"What sort of man is this Chichikov?" thought Vassili. "As a rule my\r\nbrother Platon is not over-nice in his choice of acquaintances." And,\r\neyeing our hero as narrowly as civility permitted, he saw that his\r\nappearance was that of a perfectly respectable individual.\r\n\r\nChichikov returned Vassili\'s scrutiny with a similar observance of the\r\ndictates of civility, and perceived that he was shorter than Platon,\r\nthat his hair was of a darker shade, and that his features, though less\r\nhandsome, contained far more life, animation, and kindliness than did\r\nhis brother\'s. Clearly he indulged in less dreaming, though that was an\r\naspect which Chichikov little regarded.\r\n\r\n"I have made up my mind to go touring our Holy Russia with Paul\r\nIvanovitch," said Platon. "Perhaps it will rid me of my melancholy."\r\n\r\n"What has made you come to such a sudden decision?" asked the perplexed\r\nVassili (very nearly he added: "Fancy going travelling with a man whose\r\nacquaintance you have just made, and who may turn out to be a rascal\r\nor the devil knows what!" But, in spite of his distrust, he contented\r\nhimself with another covert scrutiny of Chichikov, and this time came to\r\nthe conclusion that there was no fault to be found with his exterior).\r\n\r\nThe party turned to the right, and entered the gates of an ancient\r\ncourtyard attached to an old-fashioned house of a type no longer\r\nbuilt--the type which has huge gables supporting a high-pitched roof.\r\nIn the centre of the courtyard two great lime trees covered half the\r\nsurrounding space with shade, while beneath them were ranged a number\r\nof wooden benches, and the whole was encircled with a ring of blossoming\r\nlilacs and cherry trees which, like a beaded necklace, reinforced the\r\nwooden fence, and almost buried it beneath their clusters of leaves and\r\nflowers. The house, too, stood almost concealed by this greenery,\r\nexcept that the front door and the windows peered pleasantly through the\r\nfoliage, and that here and there between the stems of the trees there\r\ncould be caught glimpses of the kitchen regions, the storehouses, and\r\nthe cellar. Lastly, around the whole stood a grove, from the recesses of\r\nwhich came the echoing songs of nightingales.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily the place communicated to the soul a sort of quiet,\r\nrestful feeling, so eloquently did it speak of that care-free period\r\nwhen every one lived on good terms with his neighbour, and all was\r\nsimple and unsophisticated. Vassili invited Chichikov to seat himself,\r\nand the party approached, for that purpose, the benches under the lime\r\ntrees; after which a youth of about seventeen, and clad in a red shirt,\r\nbrought decanters containing various kinds of kvass (some of them as\r\nthick as syrup, and others hissing like aerated lemonade), deposited the\r\nsame upon the table, and, taking up a spade which he had left leaning\r\nagainst a tree, moved away towards the garden. The reason of this was\r\nthat in the brothers\' household, as in that of Kostanzhoglo, no servants\r\nwere kept, since the whole staff were rated as gardeners, and performed\r\nthat duty in rotation--Vassili holding that domestic service was not a\r\nspecialised calling, but one to which any one might contribute a hand,\r\nand therefore one which did not require special menials to be kept for\r\nthe purpose. Moreover, he held that the average Russian peasant remains\r\nactive and willing (rather than lazy) only so long as he wears a shirt\r\nand a peasant\'s smock; but that as soon as ever he finds himself\r\nput into a German tailcoat, he becomes awkward, sluggish, indolent,\r\ndisinclined to change his vest or take a bath, fond of sleeping in his\r\nclothes, and certain to breed fleas and bugs under the German apparel.\r\nAnd it may be that Vassili was right. At all events, the brothers\'\r\npeasantry were exceedingly well clad--the women, in particular, having\r\ntheir head-dresses spangled with gold, and the sleeves of their blouses\r\nembroidered after the fashion of a Turkish shawl.\r\n\r\n"You see here the species of kvass for which our house has long been\r\nfamous," said Vassili to Chichikov. The latter poured himself out a\r\nglassful from the first decanter which he lighted upon, and found\r\nthe contents to be linden honey of a kind never tasted by him even in\r\nPoland, seeing that it had a sparkle like that of champagne, and also an\r\neffervescence which sent a pleasant spray from the mouth into the nose.\r\n\r\n"Nectar!" he proclaimed. Then he took some from a second decanter. It\r\nproved to be even better than the first. "A beverage of beverages!" he\r\nexclaimed. "At your respected brother-in-law\'s I tasted the finest\r\nsyrup which has ever come my way, but here I have tasted the very finest\r\nkvass."\r\n\r\n"Yet the recipe for the syrup also came from here," said Vassili,\r\n"seeing that my sister took it with her. By the way, to what part of the\r\ncountry, and to what places, are you thinking of travelling?"\r\n\r\n"To tell the truth," replied Chichikov, rocking himself to and fro on\r\nthe bench, and smoothing his knee with his hand, and gently inclining\r\nhis head, "I am travelling less on my own affairs than on the affairs of\r\nothers. That is to say, General Betristchev, an intimate friend, and,\r\nI might add, a generous benefactor of mine, has charged me with\r\ncommissions to some of his relatives. Nevertheless, though relatives are\r\nrelatives, I may say that I am travelling on my own account as well, in\r\nthat, in addition to possible benefit to my health, I desire to see the\r\nworld and the whirligig of humanity, which constitute, to so speak, a\r\nliving book, a second course of education."\r\n\r\nVassili took thought. "The man speaks floridly," he reflected, "yet his\r\nwords contain a certain element of truth." After a moment\'s silence he\r\nadded to Platon: "I am beginning to think that the tour might help you\r\nto bestir yourself. At present you are in a condition of mental slumber.\r\nYou have fallen asleep, not so much from weariness or satiety, as\r\nthrough a lack of vivid perceptions and impressions. For myself, I am\r\nyour complete antithesis. I should be only too glad if I could feel less\r\nacutely, if I could take things less to heart."\r\n\r\n"Emotion has become a disease with you," said Platon. "You seek your own\r\ntroubles, and make your own anxieties."\r\n\r\n"How can you say that when ready-made anxieties greet one at every\r\nstep?" exclaimed Vassili. "For example, have you heard of the trick\r\nwhich Lienitsin has just played us--of his seizing the piece of vacant\r\nland whither our peasants resort for their sports? That piece I would\r\nnot sell for all the money in the world. It has long been our peasants\'\r\nplay-ground, and all the traditions of our village are bound up with it.\r\nMoreover, for me, old custom is a sacred thing for which I would gladly\r\nsacrifice everything else."\r\n\r\n"Lienitsin cannot have known of this, or he would not have seized the\r\nland," said Platon. "He is a newcomer, just arrived from St. Petersburg.\r\nA few words of explanation ought to meet the case."\r\n\r\n"But he DOES know of what I have stated; he DOES know of it. Purposely\r\nI sent him word to that affect, yet he has returned me the rudest of\r\nanswers."\r\n\r\n"Then go yourself and explain matters to him."\r\n\r\n"No, I will not do that; he has tried to carry off things with too high\r\na hand. But YOU can go if you like."\r\n\r\n"I would certainly go were it not that I scarcely like to interfere.\r\nAlso, I am a man whom he could easily hoodwink and outwit."\r\n\r\n"Would it help you if _I_ were to go?" put in Chichikov. "Pray enlighten\r\nme as to the matter."\r\n\r\nVassili glanced at the speaker, and thought to himself: "What a passion\r\nthe man has for travelling!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, pray give me an idea of the kind of fellow," repeated Chichikov,\r\n"and also outline to me the affair."\r\n\r\n"I should be ashamed to trouble you with such an unpleasant commission,"\r\nreplied Vassili. "He is a man whom I take to be an utter rascal.\r\nOriginally a member of a family of plain dvoriane in this province, he\r\nentered the Civil Service in St. Petersburg, then married some one\'s\r\nnatural daughter in that city, and has returned to lord it with a high\r\nhand. I cannot bear the tone he adopts. Our folk are by no means fools.\r\nThey do not look upon the current fashion as the Tsar\'s ukaz any more\r\nthan they look upon St. Petersburg as the Church."\r\n\r\n"Naturally," said Chichikov. "But tell me more of the particulars of the\r\nquarrel."\r\n\r\n"They are these. He needs additional land and, had he not acted as he\r\nhas done, I would have given him some land elsewhere for nothing; but,\r\nas it is, the pestilent fellow has taken it into his head to--"\r\n\r\n"I think I had better go and have a talk with him. That might settle the\r\naffair. Several times have people charged me with similar commissions,\r\nand never have they repented of it. General Betristchev is an example."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless I am ashamed that you should be put to the annoyance of\r\nhaving to converse with such a fellow."\r\n\r\n\r\n             [At this point there occurs a long hiatus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"And above all things, such a transaction would need to be carried\r\nthrough in secret," said Chichikov. "True, the law does not forbid such\r\nthings, but there is always the risk of a scandal."\r\n\r\n"Quite so, quite so," said Lienitsin with head bent down.\r\n\r\n"Then we agree!" exclaimed Chichikov. "How charming! As I say, my\r\nbusiness is both legal and illegal. Though needing to effect a mortgage,\r\nI desire to put no one to the risk of having to pay the two roubles\r\non each living soul; wherefore I have conceived the idea of relieving\r\nlandowners of that distasteful obligation by acquiring dead and\r\nabsconded souls who have failed to disappear from the revision list.\r\nThis enables me at once to perform an act of Christian charity and\r\nto remove from the shoulders of our more impoverished proprietors the\r\nburden of tax-payment upon souls of the kind specified. Should you\r\nyourself care to do business with me, we will draw up a formal purchase\r\nagreement as though the souls in question were still alive."\r\n\r\n"But it would be such a curious arrangement," muttered Lienitsin, moving\r\nhis chair and himself a little further away. "It would be an arrangement\r\nwhich, er--er--"\r\n\r\n"Would involve you in no scandal whatever, seeing that the affair\r\nwould be carried through in secret. Moreover, between friends who are\r\nwell-disposed towards one another--"\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless--"\r\n\r\nChichikov adopted a firmer and more decided tone. "I repeat that there\r\nwould be no scandal," he said. "The transaction would take place as\r\nbetween good friends, and as between friends of mature age, and as\r\nbetween friends of good status, and as between friends who know how\r\nto keep their own counsel." And, so saying, he looked his interlocutor\r\nfrankly and generously in the eyes.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Lienitsin\'s resourcefulness and acumen in business matters\r\nfailed to relieve his mind of a certain perplexity--and the less so\r\nsince he had contrived to become caught in his own net. Yet, in general,\r\nhe possessed neither a love for nor a talent for underhand dealings,\r\nand, had not fate and circumstances favoured Chichikov by causing\r\nLienitsin\'s wife to enter the room at that moment, things might have\r\nturned out very differently from what they did. Madame was a pale, thin,\r\ninsignificant-looking young lady, but none the less a lady who wore her\r\nclothes a la St. Petersburg, and cultivated the society of persons who\r\nwere unimpeachably comme il faut. Behind her, borne in a nurse\'s arms,\r\ncame the first fruits of the love of husband and wife. Adopting his\r\nmost telling method of approach (the method accompanied with a sidelong\r\ninclination of the head and a sort of hop), Chichikov hastened to greet\r\nthe lady from the metropolis, and then the baby. At first the latter\r\nstarted to bellow disapproval, but the words "Agoo, agoo, my pet!" added\r\nto a little cracking of the fingers and a sight of a beautiful seal on a\r\nwatch chain, enabled Chichikov to weedle the infant into his arms; after\r\nwhich he fell to swinging it up and down until he had contrived to raise\r\na smile on its face--a circumstance which greatly delighted the parents,\r\nand finally inclined the father in his visitor\'s favour. Suddenly,\r\nhowever--whether from pleasure or from some other cause--the infant\r\nmisbehaved itself!\r\n\r\n"My God!" cried Madame. "He has gone and spoilt your frockcoat!"\r\n\r\nTrue enough, on glancing downwards, Chichikov saw that the sleeve of\r\nhis brand-new garment had indeed suffered a hurt. "If I could catch you\r\nalone, you little devil," he muttered to himself, "I\'d shoot you!"\r\n\r\nHost, hostess and nurse all ran for eau-de-Cologne, and from three sides\r\nset themselves to rub the spot affected.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, never mind; it is nothing," said Chichikov as he strove to\r\ncommunicate to his features as cheerful an expression as possible.\r\n"What does it matter what a child may spoil during the golden age of its\r\ninfancy?"\r\n\r\nTo himself he remarked: "The little brute! Would it could be devoured by\r\nwolves. It has made only too good a shot, the cussed young ragamuffin!"\r\n\r\nHow, after this--after the guest had shown such innocent affection for\r\nthe little one, and magnanimously paid for his so doing with a brand-new\r\nsuit--could the father remain obdurate? Nevertheless, to avoid setting a\r\nbad example to the countryside, he and Chichikov agreed to carry through\r\nthe transaction PRIVATELY, lest, otherwise, a scandal should arise.\r\n\r\n"In return," said Chichikov, "would you mind doing me the following\r\nfavour? I desire to mediate in the matter of your difference with the\r\nBrothers Platonov. I believe that you wish to acquire some additional\r\nland? Is not that so?"\r\n\r\n\r\n            [Here there occurs a hiatus in the original.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything in life fulfils its function, and Chichikov\'s tour in search\r\nof a fortune was carried out so successfully that not a little money\r\npassed into his pockets. The system employed was a good one: he did not\r\nsteal, he merely used. And every one of us at times does the same: one\r\nman with regard to Government timber, and another with regard to a sum\r\nbelonging to his employer, while a third defrauds his children for the\r\nsake of an actress, and a fourth robs his peasantry for the sake of\r\nsmart furniture or a carriage. What can one do when one is surrounded\r\non every side with roguery, and everywhere there are insanely expensive\r\nrestaurants, masked balls, and dances to the music of gipsy bands? To\r\nabstain when every one else is indulging in these things, and fashion\r\ncommands, is difficult indeed!\r\n\r\nChichikov was for setting forth again, but the roads had now got into a\r\nbad state, and, in addition, there was in preparation a second fair--one\r\nfor the dvoriane only. The former fair had been held for the sale of\r\nhorses, cattle, cheese, and other peasant produce, and the buyers had\r\nbeen merely cattle-jobbers and kulaks; but this time the function was\r\nto be one for the sale of manorial produce which had been bought up by\r\nwholesale dealers at Nizhni Novgorod, and then transferred hither. To\r\nthe fair, of course, came those ravishers of the Russian purse who, in\r\nthe shape of Frenchmen with pomades and Frenchwomen with hats, make away\r\nwith money earned by blood and hard work, and, like the locusts of Egypt\r\n(to use Kostanzhoglo\'s term) not only devour their prey, but also dig\r\nholes in the ground and leave behind their eggs.\r\n\r\nAlthough, unfortunately, the occurrence of a bad harvest retained many\r\nlandowners at their country houses, the local tchinovniks (whom the\r\nfailure of the harvest did NOT touch) proceeded to let themselves go--as\r\nalso, to their undoing, did their wives. The reading of books of the\r\ntype diffused, in these modern days, for the inoculation of humanity\r\nwith a craving for new and superior amenities of life had caused every\r\none to conceive a passion for experimenting with the latest luxury; and\r\nto meet this want the French wine merchant opened a new establishment\r\nin the shape of a restaurant as had never before been heard of in the\r\nprovince--a restaurant where supper could be procured on credit as\r\nregarded one-half, and for an unprecedentedly low sum as regarded the\r\nother. This exactly suited both heads of boards and clerks who were\r\nliving in hope of being able some day to resume their bribes-taking from\r\nsuitors. There also developed a tendency to compete in the matter of\r\nhorses and liveried flunkeys; with the result that despite the damp and\r\nsnowy weather exceedingly elegant turnouts took to parading backwards\r\nand forwards. Whence these equipages had come God only knows, but at\r\nleast they would not have disgraced St. Petersburg. From within them\r\nmerchants and attorneys doffed their caps to ladies, and inquired after\r\ntheir health, and likewise it became a rare sight to see a bearded man\r\nin a rough fur cap, since every one now went about clean-shaven and with\r\ndirty teeth, after the European fashion.\r\n\r\n"Sir, I beg of you to inspect my goods," said a tradesman as Chichikov\r\nwas passing his establishment. "Within my doors you will find a large\r\nvariety of clothing."\r\n\r\n"Have you a cloth of bilberry-coloured check?" inquired the person\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\n"I have cloths of the finest kind," replied the tradesman, raising his\r\ncap with one hand, and pointing to his shop with the other. Chichikov\r\nentered, and in a trice the proprietor had dived beneath the counter,\r\nand appeared on the other side of it, with his back to his wares and his\r\nface towards the customer. Leaning forward on the tips of his fingers,\r\nand indicating his merchandise with just the suspicion of a nod, he\r\nrequested the gentleman to specify exactly the species of cloth which he\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n"A cloth with an olive-coloured or a bottle-tinted spot in its\r\npattern--anything in the nature of bilberry," explained Chichikov.\r\n\r\n"That being so, sir, I may say that I am about to show you clothes of a\r\nquality which even our illustrious capitals could not surpass. Hi, boy!\r\nReach down that roll up there--number 34. No, NOT that one, fool! Such\r\nfellows as you are always too good for your job. There--hand it to me.\r\nThis is indeed a nice pattern!"\r\n\r\nUnfolding the garment, the tradesman thrust it close to Chichikov\'s nose\r\nin order that he might not only handle, but also smell it.\r\n\r\n"Excellent, but not what I want," pronounced Chichikov. "Formerly I was\r\nin the Custom\'s Department, and therefore wear none but cloth of the\r\nlatest make. What I want is of a ruddier pattern than this--not exactly\r\na bottle-tinted pattern, but something approaching bilberry."\r\n\r\n"I understand, sir. Of course you require only the very newest thing. A\r\ncloth of that kind I DO possess, sir, and though excessive in price, it\r\nis of a quality to match."\r\n\r\nCarrying the roll of stuff to the light--even stepping into the street\r\nfor the purpose--the shopman unfolded his prize with the words, "A truly\r\nbeautiful shade! A cloth of smoked grey, shot with flame colour!"\r\n\r\nThe material met with the customer\'s approval, a price was agreed upon,\r\nand with incredible celerity the vendor made up the purchase into a\r\nbrown-paper parcel, and stowed it away in Chichikov\'s koliaska.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a voice asked to be shown a black frockcoat.\r\n\r\n"The devil take me if it isn\'t Khlobuev!" muttered our hero, turning his\r\nback upon the newcomer. Unfortunately the other had seen him.\r\n\r\n"Come, come, Paul Ivanovitch!" he expostulated. "Surely you do not\r\nintend to overlook me? I have been searching for you everywhere, for I\r\nhave something important to say to you."\r\n\r\n"My dear sir, my very dear sir," said Chichikov as he pressed Khlobuev\'s\r\nhand, "I can assure you that, had I the necessary leisure, I should\r\nat all times be charmed to converse with you." And mentally he added:\r\n"Would that the Evil One would fly away with you!"\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same time Murazov, the great landowner, entered the\r\nshop. As he did so our hero hastened to exclaim: "Why, it is Athanasi\r\nVassilievitch! How ARE you, my very dear sir?"\r\n\r\n"Well enough," replied Murazov, removing his cap (Khlobuev and the\r\nshopman had already done the same). "How, may I ask, are YOU?"\r\n\r\n"But poorly," replied Chichikov, "for of late I have been troubled with\r\nindigestion, and my sleep is bad. I do not get sufficient exercise."\r\n\r\nHowever, instead of probing deeper into the subject of Chichikov\'s\r\nailments, Murazov turned to Khlobuev.\r\n\r\n"I saw you enter the shop," he said, "and therefore followed you, for\r\nI have something important for your ear. Could you spare me a minute or\r\ntwo?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, certainly," said Khlobuev, and the pair left the shop\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what is afoot between them," said Chichikov to himself.\r\n\r\n"A wise and noble gentleman, Athanasi Vassilievitch!" remarked the\r\ntradesman. Chichikov made no reply save a gesture.\r\n\r\n"Paul Ivanovitch, I have been looking for you everywhere," Lienitsin\'s\r\nvoice said from behind him, while again the tradesman hastened to remove\r\nhis cap. "Pray come home with me, for I have something to say to you."\r\n\r\nChichikov scanned the speaker\'s face, but could make nothing of it.\r\nPaying the tradesman for the cloth, he left the shop.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Murazov had conveyed Khlobuev to his rooms.\r\n\r\n"Tell me," he said to his guest, "exactly how your affairs stand. I take\r\nit that, after all, your aunt left you something?"\r\n\r\n"It would be difficult to say whether or not my affairs are improved,"\r\nreplied Khlobuev. "True, fifty souls and thirty thousand roubles came\r\nto me from Madame Khanasarova, but I had to pay them away to satisfy my\r\ndebts. Consequently I am once more destitute. But the important point is\r\nthat there was trickery connected with the legacy, and shameful trickery\r\nat that. Yes, though it may surprise you, it is a fact that that fellow\r\nChichikov--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Semen Semenovitch, but, before you go on to speak of Chichikov,\r\npray tell me something about yourself, and how much, in your opinion,\r\nwould be sufficient to clear you of your difficulties?"\r\n\r\n"My difficulties are grievous," replied Khlobuev. "To rid myself of\r\nthem, and also to have enough to go on with, I should need to acquire\r\nat least a hundred thousand roubles, if not more. In short, things are\r\nbecoming impossible for me."\r\n\r\n"And, had you the money, what should you do with it?"\r\n\r\n"I should rent a tenement, and devote myself to the education of my\r\nchildren. Not a thought should I give to myself, for my career is over,\r\nseeing that it is impossible for me to re-enter the Civil Service and I\r\nam good for nothing else."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, when a man is leading an idle life he is apt to incur\r\ntemptations which shun his better-employed brother."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but beyond question I am good for nothing, so broken is my health,\r\nand such a martyr I am to dyspepsia."\r\n\r\n"But how do you propose to live without working? How can a man like you\r\nexist without a post or a position of any kind? Look around you at the\r\nworks of God. Everything has its proper function, and pursues its proper\r\ncourse. Even a stone can be used for one purpose or another. How, then,\r\ncan it be right for a man who is a thinking being to remain a drone?"\r\n\r\n"But I should not be a drone, for I should employ myself with the\r\neducation of my children."\r\n\r\n"No, Semen Semenovitch--no: THAT you would find the hardest task of\r\nall. For how can a man educate his children who has never even educated\r\nhimself? Instruction can be imparted to children only through the medium\r\nof example; and would a life like yours furnish them with a profitable\r\nexample--a life which has been spent in idleness and the playing of\r\ncards? No, Semen Semenovitch. You had far better hand your children over\r\nto me. Otherwise they will be ruined. Do not think that I am jesting.\r\nIdleness has wrecked your life, and you must flee from it. Can a man\r\nlive with nothing to keep him in place? Even a journeyman labourer who\r\nearns the barest pittance may take an interest in his occupation."\r\n\r\n"Athanasi Vassilievitch, I have tried to overcome myself, but what\r\nfurther resource lies open to me? Can I who am old and incapable\r\nre-enter the Civil Service and spend year after year at a desk with\r\nyouths who are just starting their careers? Moreover, I have lost the\r\ntrick of taking bribes; I should only hinder both myself and others;\r\nwhile, as you know, it is a department which has an established caste\r\nof its own. Therefore, though I have considered, and even attempted to\r\nobtain, every conceivable post, I find myself incompetent for them all.\r\nOnly in a monastery should I--"\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay. Monasteries, again, are only for those who have worked. To\r\nthose who have spent their youth in dissipation such havens say what\r\nthe ant said to the dragonfly--namely, \'Go you away, and return to your\r\ndancing.\' Yes, even in a monastery do folk toil and toil--they do\r\nnot sit playing whist." Murazov looked at Khlobuev, and added: "Semen\r\nSemenovitch, you are deceiving both yourself and me."\r\n\r\nPoor Khlobuev could not utter a word in reply, and Murazov began to feel\r\nsorry for him.\r\n\r\n"Listen, Semen Semenovitch," he went on. "I know that you say your\r\nprayers, and that you go to church, and that you observe both Matins and\r\nVespers, and that, though averse to early rising, you leave your bed at\r\nfour o\'clock in the morning before the household fires have been lit."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Athanasi Vassilievitch," said Khlobuev, "that is another matter\r\naltogether. That I do, not for man\'s sake, but for the sake of Him who\r\nhas ordered all things here on earth. Yes, I believe that He at least\r\ncan feel compassion for me, that He at least, though I be foul and\r\nlowly, will pardon me and receive me when all men have cast me out, and\r\nmy best friend has betrayed me and boasted that he has done it for a\r\ngood end."\r\n\r\nKhlobuev\'s face was glowing with emotion, and from the older man\'s eyes\r\nalso a tear had started.\r\n\r\n"You will do well to hearken unto Him who is merciful," he said. "But\r\nremember also that, in the eyes of the All-Merciful, honest toil is of\r\nequal merit with a prayer. Therefore take unto yourself whatsoever task\r\nyou may, and do it as though you were doing it, not unto man, but unto\r\nGod. Even though to your lot there should fall but the cleaning of a\r\nfloor, clean that floor as though it were being cleaned for Him alone.\r\nAnd thence at least this good you will reap: that there will remain to\r\nyou no time for what is evil--for card playing, for feasting, for all\r\nthe life of this gay world. Are you acquainted with Ivan Potapitch?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, not only am I acquainted with him, but I also greatly respect\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Time was when Ivan Potapitch was a merchant worth half a million\r\nroubles. In everything did he look but for gain, and his affairs\r\nprospered exceedingly, so much so that he was able to send his son to be\r\neducated in France, and to marry his daughter to a General. And whether\r\nin his office or at the Exchange, he would stop any friend whom he\r\nencountered and carry him off to a tavern to drink, and spend whole days\r\nthus employed. But at last he became bankrupt, and God sent him other\r\nmisfortunes also. His son! Ah, well! Ivan Potapitch is now my steward,\r\nfor he had to begin life over again. Yet once more his affairs are in\r\norder, and, had it been his wish, he could have restarted in business\r\nwith a capital of half a million roubles. \'But no,\' he said. \'A\r\nsteward am I, and a steward will I remain to the end; for, from being\r\nfull-stomached and heavy with dropsy, I have become strong and well.\'\r\nNot a drop of liquor passes his lips, but only cabbage soup and gruel.\r\nAnd he prays as none of the rest of us pray, and he helps the poor as\r\nnone of the rest of us help them; and to this he would add yet further\r\ncharity if his means permitted him to do so."\r\n\r\nPoor Khlobuev remained silent, as before.\r\n\r\nThe elder man took his two hands in his.\r\n\r\n"Semen Semenovitch," he said, "you cannot think how much I pity you, or\r\nhow much I have had you in my thoughts. Listen to me. In the monastery\r\nthere is a recluse who never looks upon a human face. Of all men whom\r\nI know he has the broadest mind, and he breaks not his silence save to\r\ngive advice. To him I went and said that I had a friend (though I\r\ndid not actually mention your name) who was in great trouble of soul.\r\nSuddenly the recluse interrupted me with the words: \'God\'s work first,\r\nand our own last. There is need for a church to be built, but no money\r\nwherewith to build it. Money must be collected to that end.\' Then he\r\nshut to the wicket. I wondered to myself what this could mean, and\r\nconcluded that the recluse had been unwilling to accord me his counsel.\r\nNext I repaired to the Archimandrite, and had scarce reached his door\r\nwhen he inquired of me whether I could commend to him a man meet to be\r\nentrusted with the collection of alms for a church--a man who should\r\nbelong to the dvoriane or to the more lettered merchants, but who would\r\nguard the trust as he would guard the salvation of his soul. On the\r\ninstant thought I to myself: \'Why should not the Holy Father appoint\r\nmy friend Semen Semenovitch? For the way of suffering would benefit him\r\ngreatly; and as he passed with his ledger from landowner to peasant,\r\nand from peasant to townsman, he would learn where folk dwell, and who\r\nstands in need of aught, and thus would become better acquainted with\r\nthe countryside than folk who dwell in cities. And, thus become, he\r\nwould find that his services were always in demand.\' Only of late did\r\nthe Governor-General say to me that, could he but be furnished with the\r\nname of a secretary who should know his work not only by the book but\r\nalso by experience, he would give him a great sum, since nothing is to\r\nbe learned by the former means, and, through it, much confusion arises."\r\n\r\n"You confound me, you overwhelm me!" said Khlobuev, staring at his\r\ncompanion in open-eyed astonishment. "I can scarcely believe that your\r\nwords are true, seeing that for such a trust an active, indefatigable\r\nman would be necessary. Moreover, how could I leave my wife and children\r\nunprovided for?"\r\n\r\n"Have no fear," said Murazov, "I myself will take them under my care, as\r\nwell as procure for the children a tutor. Far better and nobler were\r\nit for you to be travelling with a wallet, and asking alms on behalf\r\nof God, then to be remaining here and asking alms for yourself alone.\r\nLikewise, I will furnish you with a tilt-waggon, so that you may be\r\nsaved some of the hardships of the journey, and thus be preserved in\r\ngood health. Also, I will give you some money for the journey, in\r\norder that, as you pass on your way, you may give to those who stand\r\nin greater need than their fellows. Thus, if, before giving, you assure\r\nyourself that the recipient of the alms is worthy of the same, you will\r\ndo much good; and as you travel you will become acquainted with all men\r\nand sundry, and they will treat you, not as a tchinovnik to be feared,\r\nbut as one to whom, as a petitioner on behalf of the Church, they may\r\nunloose their tongues without peril."\r\n\r\n"I feel that the scheme is a splendid one, and would gladly bear my part\r\nin it were it not likely to exceed my strength."\r\n\r\n"What is there that does NOT exceed your strength?" said Murazov.\r\n"Nothing is wholly proportionate to it--everything surpasses it. Help\r\nfrom above is necessary: otherwise we are all powerless. Strength comes\r\nof prayer, and of prayer alone. When a man crosses himself, and cries,\r\n\'Lord, have mercy upon me!\' he soon stems the current and wins to the\r\nshore. Nor need you take any prolonged thought concerning this matter.\r\nAll that you need do is to accept it as a commission sent of God. The\r\ntilt-waggon can be prepared for you immediately; and then, as soon as\r\nyou have been to the Archimandrite for your book of accounts and his\r\nblessing, you will be free to start on your journey."\r\n\r\n"I submit myself to you, and accept the commission as a divine trust."\r\n\r\nAnd even as Khlobuev spoke he felt renewed vigour and confidence arise\r\nin his soul, and his mind begin to awake to a sense of hopefulness of\r\neventually being able to put to flight his troubles. And even as it was,\r\nthe world seemed to be growing dim to his eyes....\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, plea after plea had been presented to the legal authorities,\r\nand daily were relatives whom no one had before heard of putting in\r\nan appearance. Yes, like vultures to a corpse did these good folk come\r\nflocking to the immense property which Madam Khanasarov had left behind\r\nher. Everywhere were heard rumours against Chichikov, rumours with\r\nregard to the validity of the second will, rumours with regard to will\r\nnumber one, and rumours of larceny and concealment of funds. Also, there\r\ncame to hand information with regard both to Chichikov\'s purchase of\r\ndead souls and to his conniving at contraband goods during his service\r\nin the Customs Department. In short, every possible item of evidence\r\nwas exhumed, and the whole of his previous history investigated. How\r\nthe authorities had come to suspect and to ascertain all this God only\r\nknows, but the fact remains that there had fallen into the hands of\r\nthose authorities information concerning matters of which Chichikov had\r\nbelieved only himself and the four walls to be aware. True, for a\r\ntime these matters remained within the cognisance of none but the\r\nfunctionaries concerned, and failed to reach Chichikov\'s ears; but at\r\nlength a letter from a confidential friend gave him reason to think that\r\nthe fat was about to fall into the fire. Said the letter briefly: "Dear\r\nsir, I beg to advise you that possibly legal trouble is pending, but\r\nthat you have no cause for uneasiness, seeing that everything will\r\nbe attended to by yours very truly." Yet, in spite of its tenor, the\r\nepistle reassured its recipient. "What a genius the fellow is!" thought\r\nChichikov to himself. Next, to complete his satisfaction, his tailor\r\narrived with the new suit which he had ordered. Not without a certain\r\nsense of pride did our hero inspect the frockcoat of smoked grey shot\r\nwith flame colour and look at it from every point of view, and then\r\ntry on the breeches--the latter fitting him like a picture, and quite\r\nconcealing any deficiencies in the matter of his thighs and calves\r\n(though, when buckled behind, they left his stomach projecting like a\r\ndrum). True, the customer remarked that there appeared to be a slight\r\ntightness under the right armpit, but the smiling tailor only rejoined\r\nthat that would cause the waist to fit all the better. "Sir," he said\r\ntriumphantly, "you may rest assured that the work has been executed\r\nexactly as it ought to have been executed. No one, except in St.\r\nPetersburg, could have done it better." As a matter of fact, the tailor\r\nhimself hailed from St. Petersburg, but called himself on his signboard\r\n"Foreign Costumier from London and Paris"--the truth being that by\r\nthe use of a double-barrelled flourish of cities superior to mere\r\n"Karlsruhe" and "Copenhagen" he designed to acquire business and cut out\r\nhis local rivals.\r\n\r\nChichikov graciously settled the man\'s account, and, as soon as he had\r\ngone, paraded at leisure, and con amore, and after the manner of an\r\nartist of aesthetic taste, before the mirror. Somehow he seemed to look\r\nbetter than ever in the suit, for his cheeks had now taken on a still\r\nmore interesting air, and his chin an added seductiveness, while his\r\nwhite collar lent tone to his neck, the blue satin tie heightened the\r\neffect of the collar, the fashionable dickey set off the tie,\r\nthe rich satin waistcoat emphasised the dickey, and the\r\nsmoked-grey-shot-with-flame-colour frockcoat, shining like silk,\r\nsplendidly rounded off the whole. When he turned to the right he looked\r\nwell: when he turned to the left he looked even better. In short, it\r\nwas a costume worthy of a Lord Chamberlain or the species of dandy who\r\nshrinks from swearing in the Russian language, but amply relieves his\r\nfeelings in the language of France. Next, inclining his head slightly\r\nto one side, our hero endeavoured to pose as though he were addressing\r\na middle-aged lady of exquisite refinement; and the result of these\r\nefforts was a picture which any artist might have yearned to portray.\r\nNext, his delight led him gracefully to execute a hop in ballet fashion,\r\nso that the wardrobe trembled and a bottle of eau-de-Cologne came\r\ncrashing to the floor. Yet even this contretemps did not upset him; he\r\nmerely called the offending bottle a fool, and then debated whom first\r\nhe should visit in his attractive guise.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there resounded through the hall a clatter of spurred heels,\r\nand then the voice of a gendarme saying: "You are commanded to present\r\nyourself before the Governor-General!" Turning round, Chichikov stared\r\nin horror at the spectacle presented; for in the doorway there was\r\nstanding an apparition wearing a huge moustache, a helmet surmounted\r\nwith a horsehair plume, a pair of crossed shoulder-belts, and a gigantic\r\nsword! A whole army might have been combined into a single individual!\r\nAnd when Chichikov opened his mouth to speak the apparition repeated,\r\n"You are commanded to present yourself before the Governor-General,"\r\nand at the same moment our hero caught sight both of a second apparition\r\noutside the door and of a coach waiting beneath the window. What was\r\nto be done? Nothing whatever was possible. Just as he stood--in his\r\nsmoked-grey-shot-with-flame-colour suit--he had then and there to enter\r\nthe vehicle, and, shaking in every limb, and with a gendarme seated by\r\nhis side, to start for the residence of the Governor-General.\r\n\r\nAnd even in the hall of that establishment no time was given him to\r\npull himself together, for at once an aide-de-camp said: "Go inside\r\nimmediately, for the Prince is awaiting you." And as in a dream did our\r\nhero see a vestibule where couriers were being handed dispatches, and\r\nthen a salon which he crossed with the thought, "I suppose I am not to\r\nbe allowed a trial, but shall be sent straight to Siberia!" And at the\r\nthought his heart started beating in a manner which the most jealous\r\nof lovers could not have rivalled. At length there opened a door,\r\nand before him he saw a study full of portfolios, ledgers, and\r\ndispatch-boxes, with, standing behind them, the gravely menacing figure\r\nof the Prince.\r\n\r\n"There stands my executioner," thought Chichikov to himself. "He is\r\nabout to tear me to pieces as a wolf tears a lamb."\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Prince\'s lips were simply quivering with rage.\r\n\r\n"Once before did I spare you," he said, "and allow you to remain in the\r\ntown when you ought to have been in prison: yet your only return for\r\nmy clemency has been to revert to a career of fraud--and of fraud as\r\ndishonourable as ever a man engaged in."\r\n\r\n"To what dishonourable fraud do you refer, your Highness?" asked\r\nChichikov, trembling from head to foot.\r\n\r\nThe Prince approached, and looked him straight in the eyes.\r\n\r\n"Let me tell you," he said, "that the woman whom you induced to witness\r\na certain will has been arrested, and that you will be confronted with\r\nher."\r\n\r\nThe world seemed suddenly to grow dim before Chichikov\'s sight.\r\n\r\n"Your Highness," he gasped, "I will tell you the whole truth, and\r\nnothing but the truth. I am guilty--yes, I am guilty; but I am not so\r\nguilty as you think, for I was led away by rascals."\r\n\r\n"That any one can have led you away is impossible," retorted the Prince.\r\n"Recorded against your name there stand more felonies than even the most\r\nhardened liar could have invented. I believe that never in your life\r\nhave you done a deed not innately dishonourable--that not a kopeck have\r\nyou ever obtained by aught but shameful methods of trickery and theft,\r\nthe penalty for which is Siberia and the knut. But enough of this! From\r\nthis room you will be conveyed to prison, where, with other rogues and\r\nthieves, you will be confined until your trial may come on. And this\r\nis lenient treatment on my part, for you are worse, far worse, than the\r\nfelons who will be your companions. THEY are but poor men in smocks and\r\nsheepskins, whereas YOU--" Without concluding his words, the Prince shot\r\na glance at Chichikov\'s smoked-grey-shot-with-flame-colour apparel.\r\n\r\nThen he touched a bell.\r\n\r\n"Your Highness," cried Chichikov, "have mercy upon me! You are the\r\nfather of a family! Spare me for the sake of my aged mother!"\r\n\r\n"Rubbish!" exclaimed the Prince. "Even as before you besought me for the\r\nsake of a wife and children whom you did not even possess, so now you\r\nwould speak to me of an aged mother!"\r\n\r\n"Your Highness," protested Chichikov, "though I am a wretch and the\r\nlowest of rascals, and though it is true that I lied when I told\r\nyou that I possessed a wife and children, I swear that, as God is my\r\nwitness, it has always been my DESIRE to possess a wife, and to fulfil\r\nall the duties of a man and a citizen, and to earn the respect of my\r\nfellows and the authorities. But what could be done against the force\r\nof circumstances? By hook or by crook I have ever been forced to win\r\na living, though confronted at every step by wiles and temptations and\r\ntraitorous enemies and despoilers. So much has this been so that my\r\nlife has, throughout, resembled a barque tossed by tempestuous waves,\r\na barque driven at the mercy of the winds. Ah, I am only a man, your\r\nHighness!"\r\n\r\nAnd in a moment the tears had gushed in torrents from his eyes, and he\r\nhad fallen forward at the Prince\'s feet--fallen forward just as he\r\nwas, in his smoked-grey-shot-with-flame-colour frockcoat, his velvet\r\nwaistcoat, his satin tie, and his exquisitely fitting breeches, while\r\nfrom his neatly brushed pate, as again and again he struck his hand\r\nagainst his forehead, there came an odorous whiff of best-quality\r\neau-de-Cologne.\r\n\r\n"Away with him!" exclaimed the Prince to the gendarme who had just\r\nentered. "Summon the escort to remove him."\r\n\r\n"Your Highness!" Chichikov cried again as he clasped the Prince\'s knees;\r\nbut, shuddering all over, and struggling to free himself, the Prince\r\nrepeated his order for the prisoner\'s removal.\r\n\r\n"Your Highness, I say that I will not leave this room until you have\r\naccorded me mercy!" cried Chichikov as he clung to the Prince\'s leg with\r\nsuch tenacity that, frockcoat and all, he began to be dragged along the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n"Away with him, I say!" once more the Prince exclaimed with the sort of\r\nindefinable aversion which one feels at the sight of a repulsive\r\ninsect which he cannot summon up the courage to crush with his boot. So\r\nconvulsively did the Prince shudder that Chichikov, clinging to his leg,\r\nreceived a kick on the nose. Yet still the prisoner retained his hold;\r\nuntil at length a couple of burly gendarmes tore him away and,\r\ngrasping his arms, hurried him--pale, dishevelled, and in that strange,\r\nhalf-conscious condition into which a man sinks when he sees before\r\nhim only the dark, terrible figure of death, the phantom which is so\r\nabhorrent to all our natures--from the building. But on the threshold\r\nthe party came face to face with Murazov, and in Chichikov\'s heart\r\nthe circumstance revived a ray of hope. Wresting himself with almost\r\nsupernatural strength from the grasp of the escorting gendarmes, he\r\nthrew himself at the feet of the horror-stricken old man.\r\n\r\n"Paul Ivanovitch," Murazov exclaimed, "what has happened to you?"\r\n\r\n"Save me!" gasped Chichikov. "They are taking me away to prison and\r\ndeath!"\r\n\r\nYet almost as he spoke the gendarmes seized him again, and hurried him\r\naway so swiftly that Murazov\'s reply escaped his ears.\r\n\r\nA damp, mouldy cell which reeked of soldiers\' boots and leggings, an\r\nunvarnished table, two sorry chairs, a window closed with a grating, a\r\ncrazy stove which, while letting the smoke emerge through its cracks,\r\ngave out no heat--such was the den to which the man who had just begun\r\nto taste the sweets of life, and to attract the attention of his fellows\r\nwith his new suit of smoked-grey-shot-with-flame-colour, now found\r\nhimself consigned. Not even necessaries had he been allowed to bring\r\naway with him, nor his dispatch-box which contained all his booty. No,\r\nwith the indenture deeds of the dead souls, it was lodged in the hands\r\nof a tchinovnik; and as he thought of these things Chichikov rolled\r\nabout the floor, and felt the cankerous worm of remorse seize upon and\r\ngnaw at his heart, and bite its way ever further and further into that\r\nheart so defenceless against its ravages, until he made up his mind\r\nthat, should he have to suffer another twenty-four hours of this misery,\r\nthere would no longer be a Chichikov in the world. Yet over him, as over\r\nevery one, there hung poised the All-Saving Hand; and, an hour after his\r\narrival at the prison, the doors of the gaol opened to admit Murazov.\r\n\r\nCompared with poor Chichikov\'s sense of relief when the old man entered\r\nhis cell, even the pleasure experienced by a thirsty, dusty traveller\r\nwhen he is given a drink of clear spring water to cool his dry, parched\r\nthroat fades into insignificance.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my deliverer!" he cried as he rose from the floor, where he had\r\nbeen grovelling in heartrending paroxysms of grief. Seizing the old\r\nman\'s hand, he kissed it and pressed it to his bosom. Then, bursting\r\ninto tears, he added: "God Himself will reward you for having come to\r\nvisit an unfortunate wretch!"\r\n\r\nMurazov looked at him sorrowfully, and said no more than "Ah, Paul\r\nIvanovitch, Paul Ivanovitch! What has happened?"\r\n\r\n"What has happened?" cried Chichikov. "I have been ruined by an accursed\r\nwoman. That was because I could not do things in moderation--I was\r\npowerless to stop myself in time, Satan tempted me, and drove me from\r\nmy senses, and bereft me of human prudence. Yes, truly I have sinned, I\r\nhave sinned! Yet how came I so to sin? To think that a dvorianin--yes,\r\na dvorianin--should be thrown into prison without process or trial! I\r\nrepeat, a dvorianin! Why was I not given time to go home and collect my\r\neffects? Whereas now they are left with no one to look after them! My\r\ndispatch-box, my dispatch-box! It contained my whole property, all that\r\nmy heart\'s blood and years of toil and want have been needed to acquire.\r\nAnd now everything will be stolen, Athanasi Vassilievitch--everything\r\nwill be taken from me! My God!"\r\n\r\nAnd, unable to stand against the torrent of grief which came rushing\r\nover his heart once more, he sobbed aloud in tones which penetrated even\r\nthe thickness of the prison walls, and made dull echoes awake behind\r\nthem. Then, tearing off his satin tie, and seizing by the collar, the\r\nsmoked-grey-shot-with-flame-colour frockcoat, he stripped the latter\r\nfrom his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Paul Ivanovitch," said the old man, "how even now the property\r\nwhich you have acquired is blinding your eyes, and causing you to fail\r\nto realise your terrible position!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my good friend and benefactor," wailed poor Chichikov\r\ndespairingly, and clasping Murazov by the knees. "Yet save me if you\r\ncan! The Prince is fond of you, and would do anything for your sake."\r\n\r\n"No, Paul Ivanovitch; however much I might wish to save you, and however\r\nmuch I might try to do so, I could not help you as you desire; for it is\r\nto the power of an inexorable law, and not to the authority of any one\r\nman, that you have rendered yourself subject."\r\n\r\n"Satan tempted me, and has ended by making of me an outcast from the\r\nhuman race!" Chichikov beat his head against the wall and struck the\r\ntable with his fist until the blood spurted from his hand. Yet neither\r\nhis head nor his hand seemed to be conscious of the least pain.\r\n\r\n"Calm yourself, Paul Ivanovitch," said Murazov. "Calm yourself, and\r\nconsider how best you can make your peace with God. Think of your\r\nmiserable soul, and not of the judgment of man."\r\n\r\n"I will, Athanasi Vassilievitch, I will. But what a fate is mine! Did\r\never such a fate befall a man? To think of all the patience with which\r\nI have gathered my kopecks, of all the toil and trouble which I have\r\nendured! Yet what I have done has not been done with the intention of\r\nrobbing any one, nor of cheating the Treasury. Why, then, did I gather\r\nthose kopecks? I gathered them to the end that one day I might be able\r\nto live in plenty, and also to have something to leave to the wife\r\nand children whom, for the benefit and welfare of my country, I hoped\r\neventually to win and maintain. That was why I gathered those kopecks.\r\nTrue, I worked by devious methods--that I fully admit; but what else\r\ncould I do? And even devious methods I employed only when I saw that the\r\nstraight road would not serve my purpose so well as a crooked. Moreover,\r\nas I toiled, the appetite for those methods grew upon me. Yet what\r\nI took I took only from the rich; whereas villains exist who, while\r\ndrawing thousands a year from the Treasury, despoil the poor, and take\r\nfrom the man with nothing even that which he has. Is it not the cruelty\r\nof fate, therefore, that, just when I was beginning to reap the harvest\r\nof my toil--to touch it, so to speak, with the tip of one finger--there\r\nshould have arisen a sudden storm which has sent my barque to pieces on\r\na rock? My capital had nearly reached the sum of three hundred thousand\r\nroubles, and a three-storied house was as good as mine, and twice over\r\nI could have bought a country estate. Why, then, should such a tempest\r\nhave burst upon me? Why should I have sustained such a blow? Was not my\r\nlife already like a barque tossed to and fro by the billows? Where\r\nis Heaven\'s justice--where is the reward for all my patience, for my\r\nboundless perseverance? Three times did I have to begin life afresh, and\r\neach time that I lost my all I began with a single kopeck at a moment\r\nwhen other men would have given themselves up to despair and drink. How\r\nmuch did I not have to overcome. How much did I not have to bear! Every\r\nkopeck which I gained I had to make with my whole strength; for though,\r\nto others, wealth may come easily, every coin of mine had to be \'forged\r\nwith a nail worth three kopecks\' as the proverb has it. With such a\r\nnail--with the nail of an iron, unwearying perseverance--did _I_ forge\r\nmy kopecks."\r\n\r\nConvulsively sobbing with a grief which he could not repress, Chichikov\r\nsank upon a chair, tore from his shoulders the last ragged, trailing\r\nremnants of his frockcoat, and hurled them from him. Then, thrusting his\r\nfingers into the hair which he had once been so careful to preserve, he\r\npulled it out by handfuls at a time, as though he hoped through physical\r\npain to deaden the mental agony which he was suffering.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Murazov sat gazing in silence at the unwonted spectacle of\r\na man who had lately been mincing with the gait of a worldling or a\r\nmilitary fop now writhing in dishevelment and despair as he poured out\r\nupon the hostile forces by which human ingenuity so often finds itself\r\noutwitted a flood of invective.\r\n\r\n"Paul Ivanovitch, Paul Ivanovitch," at length said Murazov, "what\r\ncould not each of us rise to be did we but devote to good ends the same\r\nmeasure of energy and of patience which we bestow upon unworthy objects!\r\nHow much good would not you yourself have effected! Yet I do not grieve\r\nso much for the fact that you have sinned against your fellow as I\r\ngrieve for the fact that you have sinned against yourself and the rich\r\nstore of gifts and opportunities which has been committed to your care.\r\nThough originally destined to rise, you have wandered from the path and\r\nfallen."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Athanasi Vassilievitch," cried poor Chichikov, clasping his friend\x92s\r\nhands, "I swear to you that, if you would but restore me my freedom, and\r\nrecover for me my lost property, I would lead a different life from this\r\ntime forth. Save me, you who alone can work my deliverance! Save me!"\r\n\r\n"How can I do that? So to do I should need to procure the setting aside\r\nof a law. Again, even if I were to make the attempt, the Prince is a\r\nstrict administrator, and would refuse on any consideration to release\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but for you all things are possible. It is not the law that\r\ntroubles me: with that I could find a means to deal. It is the fact that\r\nfor no offence at all I have been cast into prison, and treated like\r\na dog, and deprived of my papers and dispatch-box and all my property.\r\nSave me if you can."\r\n\r\nAgain clasping the old man\'s knees, he bedewed them with his tears.\r\n\r\n"Paul Ivanovitch," said Murazov, shaking his head, "how that property\r\nof yours still seals your eyes and ears, so that you cannot so much as\r\nlisten to the promptings of your own soul!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, I will think of my soul, too, if only you will save me."\r\n\r\n"Paul Ivanovitch," the old man began again, and then stopped. For a\r\nlittle while there was a pause.\r\n\r\n"Paul Ivanovitch," at length he went on, "to save you does not lie\r\nwithin my power. Surely you yourself see that? But, so far as I can,\r\nI will endeavour to, at all events, lighten your lot and procure your\r\neventual release. Whether or not I shall succeed I do not know; but I\r\nwill make the attempt. And should I, contrary to my expectations, prove\r\nsuccessful, I beg of you, in return for these my efforts, to renounce\r\nall thought of benefit from the property which you have acquired.\r\nSincerely do I assure you that, were I myself to be deprived of my\r\nproperty (and my property greatly exceeds yours in magnitude), I should\r\nnot shed a single tear. It is not the property of which men can deprive\r\nus that matters, but the property of which no one on earth can deprive\r\nor despoil us. You are a man who has seen something of life--to use\r\nyour own words, you have been a barque tossed hither and thither by\r\ntempestuous waves: yet still will there be left to you a remnant of\r\nsubstance on which to live, and therefore I beseech you to settle down\r\nin some quiet nook where there is a church, and where none but plain,\r\ngood-hearted folk abide. Or, should you feel a yearning to leave behind\r\nyou posterity, take in marriage a good woman who shall bring you,\r\nnot money, but an aptitude for simple, modest domestic life. But\r\nthis life--the life of turmoil, with its longings and its\r\ntemptations--forget, and let it forget YOU; for there is no peace in\r\nit. See for yourself how, at every step, it brings one but hatred and\r\ntreachery and deceit."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, yes!" agreed the repentant Chichikov. "Gladly will I do as you\r\nwish, since for many a day past have I been longing to amend my life,\r\nand to engage in husbandry, and to reorder my affairs. A demon, the\r\ntempter Satan himself, has beguiled me and led me from the right path."\r\n\r\nSuddenly there had recurred to Chichikov long-unknown, long-unfamiliar\r\nfeelings. Something seemed to be striving to come to life again in\r\nhim--something dim and remote, something which had been crushed out of\r\nhis boyhood by the dreary, deadening education of his youthful days, by\r\nhis desolate home, by his subsequent lack of family ties, by the poverty\r\nand niggardliness of his early impressions, by the grim eye of fate--an\r\neye which had always seemed to be regarding him as through a misty,\r\nmournful, frost-encrusted window-pane, and to be mocking at his\r\nstruggles for freedom. And as these feelings came back to the penitent\r\na groan burst from his lips, and, covering his face with his hands, he\r\nmoaned: "It is all true, it is all true!"\r\n\r\n"Of little avail are knowledge of the world and experience of men unless\r\nbased upon a secure foundation," observed Murazov. "Though you have\r\nfallen, Paul Ivanovitch, awake to better things, for as yet there is\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"No, no!" groaned Chichikov in a voice which made Murazov\'s heart bleed.\r\n"It is too late, too late. More and more is the conviction gaining upon\r\nme that I am powerless, that I have strayed too far ever to be able to\r\ndo as you bid me. The fact that I have become what I am is due to my\r\nearly schooling; for, though my father taught me moral lessons, and beat\r\nme, and set me to copy maxims into a book, he himself stole land from\r\nhis neighbours, and forced me to help him. I have even known him to\r\nbring an unjust suit, and defraud the orphan whose guardian he was!\r\nConsequently I know and feel that, though my life has been different\r\nfrom his, I do not hate roguery as I ought to hate it, and that my\r\nnature is coarse, and that in me there is no real love for what is good,\r\nno real spark of that beautiful instinct for well-doing which becomes\r\na second nature, a settled habit. Also, never do I yearn to strive for\r\nwhat is right as I yearn to acquire property. This is no more than the\r\ntruth. What else could I do but confess it?"\r\n\r\nThe old man sighed.\r\n\r\n"Paul Ivanovitch," he said, "I know that you possess will-power, and\r\nthat you possess also perseverance. A medicine may be bitter, yet the\r\npatient will gladly take it when assured that only by its means can he\r\nrecover. Therefore, if it really be that you have no genuine love for\r\ndoing good, do good by FORCING yourself to do so. Thus you will benefit\r\nyourself even more than you will benefit him for whose sake the act\r\nis performed. Only force yourself to do good just once and again, and,\r\nbehold, you will suddenly conceive the TRUE love for well-doing. That\r\nis so, believe me. \'A kingdom is to be won only by striving,\' says the\r\nproverb. That is to say, things are to be attained only by putting forth\r\none\'s whole strength, since nothing short of one\'s whole strength will\r\nbring one to the desired goal. Paul Ivanovitch, within you there is a\r\nsource of strength denied to many another man. I refer to the strength\r\nof an iron perseverance. Cannot THAT help you to overcome? Most men are\r\nweak and lack will-power, whereas I believe that you possess the power\r\nto act a hero\'s part."\r\n\r\nSinking deep into Chichikov\'s heart, these words would seem to have\r\naroused in it a faint stirring of ambition, so much so that, if it was\r\nnot fortitude which shone in his eyes, at all events it was something\r\nvirile, and of much the same nature.\r\n\r\n"Athanasi Vassilievitch," he said firmly, "if you will but petition\r\nfor my release, as well as for permission for me to leave here with a\r\nportion of my property, I swear to you on my word of honour that I will\r\nbegin a new life, and buy a country estate, and become the head of a\r\nhousehold, and save money, not for myself, but for others, and do good\r\neverywhere, and to the best of my ability, and forget alike myself and\r\nthe feasting and debauchery of town life, and lead, instead, a plain,\r\nsober existence."\r\n\r\n"In that resolve may God strengthen you!" cried the old man with\r\nunbounded joy. "And I, for my part, will do my utmost to procure\r\nyour release. And though God alone knows whether my efforts will be\r\nsuccessful, at all events I hope to bring about a mitigation of your\r\nsentence. Come, let me embrace you! How you have filled my heart with\r\ngladness! With God\'s help, I will now go to the Prince."\r\n\r\nAnd the next moment Chichikov found himself alone. His whole nature felt\r\nshaken and softened, even as, when the bellows have fanned the furnace\r\nto a sufficient heat, a plate compounded even of the hardest and most\r\nfire-resisting metal dissolves, glows, and turns to the liquefied state.\r\n\r\n"I myself can feel but little," he reflected, "but I intend to use my\r\nevery faculty to help others to feel. I myself am but bad and worthless,\r\nbut I intend to do my utmost to set others on the right road. I myself\r\nam but an indifferent Christian, but I intend to strive never to yield\r\nto temptation, but to work hard, and to till my land with the sweat of\r\nmy brow, and to engage only in honourable pursuits, and to influence my\r\nfellows in the same direction. For, after all, am I so very useless?\r\nAt least I could maintain a household, for I am frugal and active and\r\nintelligent and steadfast. The only thing is to make up my mind to it."\r\n\r\nThus Chichikov pondered; and as he did so his half-awakened energies of\r\nsoul touched upon something. That is to say, dimly his instinct\r\ndivined that every man has a duty to perform, and that that duty may\r\nbe performed here, there, and everywhere, and no matter what the\r\ncircumstances and the emotions and the difficulties which compass a man\r\nabout. And with such clearness did Chichikov mentally picture to himself\r\nthe life of grateful toil which lies removed from the bustle of towns\r\nand the temptations which man, forgetful of the obligation of labour,\r\nhas invented to beguile an hour of idleness that almost our hero forgot\r\nhis unpleasant position, and even felt ready to thank Providence for\r\nthe calamity which had befallen him, provided that it should end in his\r\nbeing released, and in his receiving back a portion of his property.\r\n\r\nPresently the massive door of the cell opened to admit a tchinovnik\r\nnamed Samosvitov, a robust, sensual individual who was reputed by his\r\ncomrades to be something of a rake. Had he served in the army, he\r\nwould have done wonders, for he would have stormed any point, however\r\ndangerous and inaccessible, and captured cannon under the very noses\r\nof the foe; but, as it was, the lack of a more warlike field for his\r\nenergies caused him to devote the latter principally to dissipation.\r\nNevertheless he enjoyed great popularity, for he was loyal to the point\r\nthat, once his word had been given, nothing would ever make him break\r\nit. At the same time, some reason or another led him to regard his\r\nsuperiors in the light of a hostile battery which, come what might, he\r\nmust breach at any weak or unguarded spot or gap which might be capable\r\nof being utilised for the purpose.\r\n\r\n"We have all heard of your plight," he began as soon as the door had\r\nbeen safely closed behind him. "Yes, every one has heard of it. But\r\nnever mind. Things will yet come right. We will do our very best for\r\nyou, and act as your humble servants in everything. Thirty thousand\r\nroubles is our price--no more."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said Chichikov. "And, for that, shall I be completely\r\nexonerated?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, completely, and also given some compensation for your loss of\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"And how much am I to pay in return, you say?"\r\n\r\n"Thirty thousand roubles, to be divided among ourselves, the\r\nGovernor-General\'s staff, and the Governor-General\'s secretary."\r\n\r\n"But how is even that to be managed, for all my effects, including my\r\ndispatch-box, will have been sealed up and taken away for examination?"\r\n\r\n"In an hour\'s time they will be within your hands again," said\r\nSamosvitov. "Shall we shake hands over the bargain?"\r\n\r\nChichikov did so with a beating heart, for he could scarcely believe his\r\nears.\r\n\r\n"For the present, then, farewell," concluded Samosvitov. "I have\r\ninstructed a certain mutual friend that the important points are silence\r\nand presence of mind."\r\n\r\n"Hm!" thought Chichikov. "It is to my lawyer that he is referring."\r\n\r\nEven when Samosvitov had departed the prisoner found it difficult to\r\ncredit all that had been said. Yet not an hour had elapsed before a\r\nmessenger arrived with his dispatch-box and the papers and money therein\r\npractically undisturbed and intact! Later it came out that Samosvitov\r\nhad assumed complete authority in the matter. First, he had rebuked the\r\ngendarmes guarding Chichikov\'s effects for lack of vigilance, and then\r\nsent word to the Superintendent that additional men were required for\r\nthe purpose; after which he had taken the dispatch-box into his own\r\ncharge, removed from it every paper which could possibly compromise\r\nChichikov, sealed up the rest in a packet, and ordered a gendarme to\r\nconvey the whole to their owner on the pretence of forwarding him sundry\r\ngarments necessary for the night. In the result Chichikov received not\r\nonly his papers, but also some warm clothing for his hypersensitive\r\nlimbs. Such a swift recovery of his treasures delighted him beyond\r\nexpression, and, gathering new hope, he began once more to dream of such\r\nallurements as theatre-going and the ballet girl after whom he had for\r\nsome time past been dangling. Gradually did the country estate and the\r\nsimple life begin to recede into the distance: gradually did the town\r\nhouse and the life of gaiety begin to loom larger and larger in the\r\nforeground. Oh, life, life!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in Government offices and chancellories there had been set\r\non foot a boundless volume of work. Clerical pens slaved, and brains\r\nskilled in legal casus toiled; for each official had the artist\'s liking\r\nfor the curved line in preference to the straight. And all the while,\r\nlike a hidden magician, Chichikov\'s lawyer imparted driving power to\r\nthat machine which caught up a man into its mechanism before he could\r\neven look round. And the complexity of it increased and increased, for\r\nSamosvitov surpassed himself in importance and daring. On learning\r\nof the place of confinement of the woman who had been arrested, he\r\npresented himself at the doors, and passed so well for a smart young\r\nofficer of gendarmery that the sentry saluted and sprang to attention.\r\n\r\n"Have you been on duty long?" asked Samosvitov.\r\n\r\n"Since this morning, your Excellency."\r\n\r\n"And shall you soon be relieved?"\r\n\r\n"In three hours from now, your Excellency."\r\n\r\n"Presently I shall want you, so I will instruct your officer to have you\r\nrelieved at once."\r\n\r\n"Very good, your Excellency."\r\n\r\nHastening home, thereafter, at top speed, and donning the uniform of\r\na gendarme, with a false moustache and a pair of false whiskers--an\r\nensemble in which the devil himself would not have known him, Samosvitov\r\nthen made for the gaol where Chichikov was confined, and, en route,\r\nimpressed into the service the first street woman whom he encountered,\r\nand handed her over to the care of two young fellows of like sort\r\nwith himself. The next step was to hurry back to the prison where the\r\noriginal woman had been interned, and there to intimate to the sentry\r\nthat he, Samosvitov (with whiskers and rifle complete), had been sent\r\nto relieve the said sentry at his post--a proceeding which, of course,\r\nenabled the newly-arrived relief to ensure, while performing his\r\nself-assumed turn of duty, that for the woman lying under arrest there\r\nshould be substituted the woman recently recruited to the plot, and that\r\nthe former should then be conveyed to a place of concealment where she\r\nwas highly unlikely to be discovered.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Samosvitov\'s feats in the military sphere were being rivalled\r\nby the wonders worked by Chichikov\'s lawyer in the civilian field of\r\naction. As a first step, the lawyer caused it to be intimated to the\r\nlocal Governor that the Public Prosecutor was engaged in drawing up a\r\nreport to his, the local Governor\'s, detriment; whereafter the lawyer\r\ncaused it to be intimated also to the Chief of Gendarmery that a certain\r\nconfidential official was engaged in doing the same by HIM; whereafter,\r\nagain, the lawyer confided to the confidential official in question\r\nthat, owing to the documentary exertions of an official of a still\r\nmore confidential nature than the first, he (the confidential official\r\nfirst-mentioned) was in a fair way to find himself in the same boat as\r\nboth the local Governor and the Chief of Gendarmery: with the result\r\nthat the whole trio were reduced to a frame of mind in which they were\r\nonly too glad to turn to him (Samosvitov) for advice. The ultimate and\r\nfarcical upshot was that report came crowding upon report, and that such\r\nalleged doings were brought to light as the sun had never before beheld.\r\nIn fact, the documents in question employed anything and everything as\r\nmaterial, even to announcing that such and such an individual had an\r\nillegitimate son, that such and such another kept a paid mistress, and\r\nthat such and such a third was troubled with a gadabout wife; whereby\r\nthere became interwoven with and welded into Chichikov\'s past history\r\nand the story of the dead souls such a crop of scandals and innuendoes\r\nthat by no manner of means could any mortal decide to which of these\r\nrubbishy romances to award the palm, since all of them presented an equal\r\nclaim to that honour. Naturally, when, at length, the dossier reached\r\nthe Governor-General himself it simply flabbergasted the poor man; and\r\neven the exceptionally clever and energetic secretary to whom he deputed\r\nthe making of an abstract of the same very nearly lost his reason with\r\nthe strain of attempting to lay hold of the tangled end of the skein. It\r\nhappened that just at that time the Prince had several other important\r\naffairs on hand, and affairs of a very unpleasant nature. That is to\r\nsay, famine had made its appearance in one portion of the province, and\r\nthe tchinovniks sent to distribute food to the people had done their\r\nwork badly; in another portion of the province certain Raskolniki [51]\r\nwere in a state of ferment, owing to the spreading of a report than\r\nan Antichrist had arisen who would not even let the dead rest, but was\r\npurchasing them wholesale--wherefore the said Raskolniki were summoning\r\nfolk to prayer and repentance, and, under cover of capturing the\r\nAntichrist in question, were bludgeoning non-Antichrists in batches;\r\nlastly, the peasants of a third portion of the province had risen\r\nagainst the local landowners and superintendents of police, for the\r\nreason that certain rascals had started a rumour that the time was come\r\nwhen the peasants themselves were to become landowners, and to wear\r\nfrockcoats, while the landowners in being were about to revert to the\r\npeasant state, and to take their own wares to market; wherefore one of\r\nthe local volosts[52], oblivious of the fact that an order of things\r\nof that kind would lead to a superfluity alike of landowners and\r\nof superintendents of police, had refused to pay its taxes, and\r\nnecessitated recourse to forcible measures. Hence it was in a mood\r\nof the greatest possible despondency that the poor Prince was sitting\r\nplunged when word was brought to him that the old man who had gone bail\r\nfor Chichikov was waiting to see him.\r\n\r\n"Show him in," said the Prince; and the old man entered.\r\n\r\n"A fine fellow your Chichikov!" began the Prince angrily. "You defended\r\nhim, and went bail for him, even though he had been up to business which\r\neven the lowest thief would not have touched!"\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, your Highness; I do not understand to what you are\r\nreferring."\r\n\r\n"I am referring to the matter of the fraudulent will. The fellow ought\r\nto have been given a public flogging for it."\r\n\r\n"Although to exculpate Chichikov is not my intention, might I ask\r\nyou whether you do not think the case is non-proven? At all events,\r\nsufficient evidence against him is still lacking."\r\n\r\n"What? We have as chief witness the woman who personated the deceased,\r\nand I will have her interrogated in your presence."\r\n\r\nTouching a bell, the Prince ordered her to be sent for.\r\n\r\n"It is a most disgraceful affair," he went on; "and, ashamed though I am\r\nto have to say it, some of our leading tchinovniks, including the local\r\nGovernor himself, have become implicated in the matter. Yet you tell me\r\nthat this Chichikov ought not to be confined among thieves and rascals!"\r\nClearly the Governor-General\'s wrath was very great indeed.\r\n\r\n"Your Highness," said Murazov, "the Governor of the town is one of the\r\nheirs under the will: wherefore he has a certain right to intervene.\r\nAlso, the fact that extraneous persons have meddled in the matter is\r\nonly what is to be expected from human nature. A rich woman dies, and\r\nno exact, regular disposition of her property is made. Hence there comes\r\nflocking from every side a cloud of fortune hunters. What else could one\r\nexpect? Such is human nature."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but why should such persons go and commit fraud?" asked the\r\nPrince irritably. "I feel as though not a single honest tchinovnik were\r\navailable--as though every one of them were a rogue."\r\n\r\n"Your Highness, which of us is altogether beyond reproach? The\r\ntchinovniks of our town are human beings, and no more. Some of them are\r\nmen of worth, and nearly all of them men skilled in business--though\r\nalso, unfortunately, largely inter-related."\r\n\r\n"Now, tell me this, Athanasi Vassilievitch," said the Prince, "for you\r\nare about the only honest man of my acquaintance. What has inspired in\r\nyou such a penchant for defending rascals?"\r\n\r\n"This," replied Murazov. "Take any man you like of the persons whom you\r\nthus term rascals. That man none the less remains a human being. That\r\nbeing so, how can one refuse to defend him when all the time one\r\nknows that half his errors have been committed through ignorance and\r\nstupidity? Each of us commits faults with every step that we take;\r\neach of us entails unhappiness upon others with every breath that we\r\ndraw--and that although we may have no evil intention whatever in our\r\nminds. Your Highness himself has, before now, committed an injustice of\r\nthe gravest nature."\r\n\r\n"_I_ have?" cried the Prince, taken aback by this unexpected turn given\r\nto the conversation.\r\n\r\nMurazov remained silent for a moment, as though he were debating\r\nsomething in his thoughts. Then he said:\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless it is as I say. You committed the injustice in the case of\r\nthe lad Dierpiennikov."\r\n\r\n"What, Athanasi Vassilievitch? The fellow had infringed one of the\r\nFundamental Laws! He had been found guilty of treason!"\r\n\r\n"I am not seeking to justify him; I am only asking you whether you think\r\nit right that an inexperienced youth who had been tempted and led away\r\nby others should have received the same sentence as the man who\r\nhad taken the chief part in the affair. That is to say, although\r\nDierpiennikov and the man Voron-Drianni received an equal measure of\r\npunishment, their CRIMINALITY was not equal."\r\n\r\n"If," exclaimed the Prince excitedly, "you know anything further\r\nconcerning the case, for God\'s sake tell it me at once. Only the other\r\nday did I forward a recommendation that St. Petersburg should remit a\r\nportion of the sentence."\r\n\r\n"Your Highness," replied Murazov, "I do not mean that I know of\r\nanything which does not lie also within your own cognisance, though one\r\ncircumstance there was which might have told in the lad\'s favour had he\r\nnot refused to admit it, lest another should suffer injury. All that\r\nI have in my mind is this. On that occasion were you not a little\r\nover-hasty in coming to a conclusion? You will understand, of course,\r\nthat I am judging only according to my own poor lights, and for the\r\nreason that on more than one occasion you have urged me to be frank. In\r\nthe days when I myself acted as a chief of gendarmery I came in contact\r\nwith a great number of accused--some of them bad, some of them good; and\r\nin each case I found it well also to consider a man\'s past career, for\r\nthe reason that, unless one views things calmly, instead of at once\r\ndecrying a man, he is apt to take alarm, and to make it impossible\r\nthereafter to get any real confession from him. If, on the other hand,\r\nyou question a man as friend might question friend, the result will be\r\nthat straightway he will tell you everything, nor ask for mitigation of\r\nhis penalty, nor bear you the least malice, in that he will understand\r\nthat it is not you who have punished him, but the law."\r\n\r\nThe Prince relapsed into thought; until presently there entered a young\r\ntchinovnik. Portfolio in hand, this official stood waiting respectfully.\r\nCare and hard work had already imprinted their insignia upon his fresh\r\nyoung face; for evidently he had not been in the Service for nothing. As\r\na matter of fact, his greatest joy was to labour at a tangled case, and\r\nsuccessfully to unravel it.\r\n\r\n\r\n        [At this point a long hiatus occurs in the original.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"I will send corn to the localities where famine is worst," said\r\nMurazov, "for I understand that sort of work better than do the\r\ntchinovniks, and will personally see to the needs of each person. Also,\r\nif you will allow me, your Highness, I will go and have a talk with the\r\nRaskolniki. They are more likely to listen to a plain man than to an\r\nofficial. God knows whether I shall succeed in calming them, but at\r\nleast no tchinovnik could do so, for officials of the kind merely draw\r\nup reports and lose their way among their own documents--with the result\r\nthat nothing comes of it. Nor will I accept from you any money for these\r\npurposes, since I am ashamed to devote as much as a thought to my own\r\npocket at a time when men are dying of hunger. I have a large stock of\r\ngrain lying in my granaries; in addition to which, I have sent orders to\r\nSiberia that a new consignment shall be forwarded me before the coming\r\nsummer."\r\n\r\n"Of a surety will God reward you for your services, Athanasi\r\nVassilievitch! Not another word will I say to you on the subject, for\r\nyou yourself feel that any words from me would be inadequate. Yet tell\r\nme one thing: I refer to the case of which you know. Have I the right to\r\npass over the case? Also, would it be just and honourable on my part to\r\nlet the offending tchinovniks go unpunished?"\r\n\r\n"Your Highness, it is impossible to return a definite answer to those\r\ntwo questions: and the more so because many rascals are at heart men of\r\nrectitude. Human problems are difficult things to solve. Sometimes a man\r\nmay be drawn into a vicious circle, so that, having once entered it, he\r\nceases to be himself."\r\n\r\n"But what would the tchinovniks say if I allowed the case to be passed\r\nover? Would not some of them turn up their noses at me, and declare\r\nthat they have effected my intimidation? Surely they would be the last\r\npersons in the world to respect me for my action?"\r\n\r\n"Your Highness, I think this: that your best course would be to call\r\nthem together, and to inform them that you know everything, and to\r\nexplain to them your personal attitude (exactly as you have explained\r\nit to me), and to end by at once requesting their advice and asking\r\nthem what each of them would have done had he been placed in similar\r\ncircumstances."\r\n\r\n"What? You think that those tchinovniks would be so accessible to lofty\r\nmotives that they would cease thereafter to be venal and meticulous? I\r\nshould be laughed at for my pains."\r\n\r\n"I think not, your Highness. Even the baser section of humanity\r\npossesses a certain sense of equity. Your wisest plan, your Highness,\r\nwould be to conceal nothing and to speak to them as you have just spoken\r\nto me. If, at present, they imagine you to be ambitious and proud\r\nand unapproachable and self-assured, your action would afford them\r\nan opportunity of seeing how the case really stands. Why should you\r\nhesitate? You would but be exercising your undoubted right. Speak to\r\nthem as though delivering not a message of your own, but a message from\r\nGod."\r\n\r\n"I will think it over," the Prince said musingly, "and meanwhile I thank\r\nyou from my heart for your good advice."\r\n\r\n"Also, I should order Chichikov to leave the town," suggested Murazov.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will do so. Tell him from me that he is to depart hence as\r\nquickly as possible, and that the further he should remove himself, the\r\nbetter it will be for him. Also, tell him that it is only owing to your\r\nefforts that he has received a pardon at my hands."\r\n\r\nMurazov bowed, and proceeded from the Prince\'s presence to that of\r\nChichikov. He found the prisoner cheerfully enjoying a hearty dinner\r\nwhich, under hot covers, had been brought him from an exceedingly\r\nexcellent kitchen. But almost the first words which he uttered showed\r\nMurazov that the prisoner had been having dealings with the army of\r\nbribe-takers; as also that in those transactions his lawyer had played\r\nthe principal part.\r\n\r\n"Listen, Paul Ivanovitch," the old man said. "I bring you your freedom,\r\nbut only on this condition--that you depart out of the town forthwith.\r\nTherefore gather together your effects, and waste not a moment, lest\r\nworse befall you. Also, of all that a certain person has contrived to\r\ndo on your behalf I am aware; wherefore let me tell you, as between\r\nourselves, that should the conspiracy come to light, nothing on earth\r\ncan save him, and in his fall he will involve others rather then be left\r\nunaccompanied in the lurch, and not see the guilt shared. How is it that\r\nwhen I left you recently you were in a better frame of mind than you are\r\nnow? I beg of you not to trifle with the matter. Ah me! what boots that\r\nwealth for which men dispute and cut one another\'s throats? Do they\r\nthink that it is possible to prosper in this world without thinking of\r\nthe world to come? Believe me when I say that, until a man shall have\r\nrenounced all that leads humanity to contend without giving a thought to\r\nthe ordering of spiritual wealth, he will never set his temporal goods\r\neither upon a satisfactory foundation. Yes, even as times of want and\r\nscarcity may come upon nations, so may they come upon individuals. No\r\nmatter what may be said to the contrary, the body can never dispense\r\nwith the soul. Why, then, will you not try to walk in the right way,\r\nand, by thinking no longer of dead souls, but only of your only living\r\none, regain, with God\'s help, the better road? I too am leaving the town\r\nto-morrow. Hasten, therefore, lest, bereft of my assistance, you meet\r\nwith some dire misfortune."\r\n\r\nAnd the old man departed, leaving Chichikov plunged in thought. Once\r\nmore had the gravity of life begun to loom large before him.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Murazov was right," he said to himself. "It is time that I were\r\nmoving."\r\n\r\nLeaving the prison--a warder carrying his effects in his wake--he found\r\nSelifan and Petrushka overjoyed at seeing their master once more at\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\n"Well, good fellows?" he said kindly. "And now we must pack and be off."\r\n\r\n"True, true, Paul Ivanovitch," agreed Selifan. "And by this time the\r\nroads will have become firmer, for much snow has fallen. Yes, high time\r\nis it that we were clear of the town. So weary of it am I that the sight\r\nof it hurts my eyes."\r\n\r\n"Go to the coachbuilder\'s," commanded Chichikov, "and have\r\nsledge-runners fitted to the koliaska."\r\n\r\nChichikov then made his way into the town--though not with the object of\r\npaying farewell visits (in view of recent events, that might have given\r\nrise to some awkwardness), but for the purpose of paying an unobtrusive\r\ncall at the shop where he had obtained the cloth for his latest\r\nsuit. There he now purchased four more arshins of the same\r\nsmoked-grey-shot-with-flame-colour material as he had had before, with\r\nthe intention of having it made up by the tailor who had fashioned the\r\nprevious costume; and by promising double remuneration he induced the\r\ntailor in question so to hasten the cutting out of the garments that,\r\nthrough sitting up all night over the work, the man might have the whole\r\nready by break of day. True, the goods were delivered a trifle after\r\nthe appointed hour, yet the following morning saw the coat and breeches\r\ncompleted; and while the horses were being put to, Chichikov tried on\r\nthe clothes, and found them equal to the previous creation, even though\r\nduring the process he caught sight of a bald patch on his head, and was\r\nled mournfully to reflect: "Alas! Why did I give way to such despair?\r\nSurely I need not have torn my hair out so freely?"\r\n\r\nThen, when the tailor had been paid, our hero left the town. But no\r\nlonger was he the old Chichikov--he was only a ruin of what he had been,\r\nand his frame of mind might have been compared to a building recently\r\npulled down to make room for a new one, while the new one had not yet\r\nbeen erected owing to the non-receipt of the plans from the architect.\r\nMurazov, too, had departed, but at an earlier hour, and in a tilt-waggon\r\nwith Ivan Potapitch.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the Governor-General issued to all and sundry officials\r\na notice that, on the occasion of his departure for St. Petersburg,\r\nhe would be glad to see the corps of tchinovniks at a private meeting.\r\nAccordingly all ranks and grades of officialdom repaired to his\r\nresidence, and there awaited--not without a certain measure of\r\ntrepidation and of searching of heart--the Governor-General\'s entry.\r\nWhen that took place he looked neither clear nor dull. Yet his bearing\r\nwas proud, and his step assured. The tchinovniks bowed--some of them to\r\nthe waist, and he answered their salutations with a slight inclination\r\nof the head. Then he spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n"Since I am about to pay a visit to St. Petersburg, I have thought it\r\nright to meet you, and to explain to you privately my reasons for doing\r\nso. An affair of a most scandalous character has taken place in our\r\nmidst. To what affair I am referring I think most of those present will\r\nguess. Now, an automatic process has led to that affair bringing about\r\nthe discovery of other matters. Those matters are no less dishonourable\r\nthan the primary one; and to that I regret to have to add that there\r\nstand involved in them certain persons whom I had hitherto believed\r\nto be honourable. Of the object aimed at by those who have complicated\r\nmatters to the point of making their resolution almost impossible by\r\nordinary methods I am aware; as also I am aware of the identity of the\r\nringleader, despite the skill with which he has sought to conceal his\r\nshare in the scandal. But the principal point is, that I propose to\r\ndecide these matters, not by formal documentary process, but by the\r\nmore summary process of court-martial, and that I hope, when the\r\ncircumstances have been laid before his Imperial Majesty, to receive\r\nfrom him authority to adopt the course which I have mentioned. For I\r\nconceive that when it has become impossible to resolve a case by civil\r\nmeans, and some of the necessary documents have been burnt, and attempts\r\nhave been made (both through the adduction of an excess of false and\r\nextraneous evidence and through the framing of fictitious reports)\r\nto cloud an already sufficiently obscure investigation with an added\r\nmeasure of complexity,--when all these circumstances have arisen, I\r\nconceive that the only possible tribunal to deal with them is a military\r\ntribunal. But on that point I should like your opinion."\r\n\r\nThe Prince paused for a moment or two, as though awaiting a reply; but\r\nnone came, seeing that every man had his eyes bent upon the floor, and\r\nmany of the audience had turned white in the face.\r\n\r\n"Then," he went on, "I may say that I am aware also of a matter which\r\nthose who have carried it through believe to lie only within the\r\ncognisance of themselves. The particulars of that matter will not be set\r\nforth in documentary form, but only through process of myself acting as\r\nplaintiff and petitioner, and producing none but ocular evidence."\r\n\r\nAmong the throng of tchinovniks some one gave a start, and thereby\r\ncaused others of the more apprehensive sort to fall to trembling in\r\ntheir shoes.\r\n\r\n"Without saying does it go that the prime conspirators ought to undergo\r\ndeprivation of rank and property, and that the remainder ought to be\r\ndismissed from their posts; for though that course would cause a certain\r\nproportion of the innocent to suffer with the guilty, there would seem\r\nto be no other course available, seeing that the affair is one of\r\nthe most disgraceful nature, and calls aloud for justice. Therefore,\r\nalthough I know that to some my action will fail to serve as a lesson,\r\nsince it will lead to their succeeding to the posts of dismissed\r\nofficials, as well as that others hitherto considered honourable will\r\nlose their reputation, and others entrusted with new responsibilities\r\nwill continue to cheat and betray their trust,--although all this is\r\nknown to me, I still have no choice but to satisfy the claims of justice\r\nby proceeding to take stern measures. I am also aware that I shall be\r\naccused of undue severity; but, lastly, I am aware that it is my duty to\r\nput aside all personal feeling, and to act as the unconscious instrument\r\nof that retribution which justice demands."\r\n\r\nOver ever face there passed a shudder. Yet the Prince had spoken calmly,\r\nand not a trace of anger or any other kind of emotion had been visible\r\non his features.\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless," he went on, "the very man in whose hands the fate of\r\nso many now lies, the very man whom no prayer for mercy could ever have\r\ninfluenced, himself desires to make a request of you. Should you grant\r\nthat request, all will be forgotten and blotted out and pardoned, for\r\nI myself will intercede with the Throne on your behalf. That request is\r\nthis. I know that by no manner of means, by no preventive measures, and\r\nby no penalties will dishonesty ever be completely extirpated from our\r\nmidst, for the reason that its roots have struck too deep, and that\r\nthe dishonourable traffic in bribes has become a necessity to, even the\r\nmainstay of, some whose nature is not innately venal. Also, I know that,\r\nto many men, it is an impossibility to swim against the stream. Yet now,\r\nat this solemn and critical juncture, when the country is calling aloud\r\nfor saviours, and it is the duty of every citizen to contribute and to\r\nsacrifice his all, I feel that I cannot but issue an appeal to every man\r\nin whom a Russian heart and a spark of what we understand by the word\r\n\'nobility\' exist. For, after all, which of us is more guilty than his\r\nfellow? It may be to ME the greatest culpability should be assigned, in\r\nthat at first I may have adopted towards you too reserved an attitude,\r\nthat I may have been over-hasty in repelling those who desired but to\r\nserve me, even though of their services I did not actually stand in\r\nneed. Yet, had they really loved justice and the good of their country,\r\nI think that they would have been less prone to take offence at the\r\ncoldness of my attitude, but would have sacrificed their feelings and\r\ntheir personality to their superior convictions. For hardly can it\r\nbe that I failed to note their overtures and the loftiness of their\r\nmotives, or that I would not have accepted any wise and useful advice\r\nproffered. At the same time, it is for a subordinate to adapt himself to\r\nthe tone of his superior, rather than for a superior to adapt himself to\r\nthe tone of his subordinate. Such a course is at once more regular\r\nand more smooth of working, since a corps of subordinates has but one\r\ndirector, whereas a director may have a hundred subordinates. But let us\r\nput aside the question of comparative culpability. The important point\r\nis, that before us all lies the duty of rescuing our fatherland. Our\r\nfatherland is suffering, not from the incursion of a score of alien\r\ntongues, but from our own acts, in that, in addition to the lawful\r\nadministration, there has grown up a second administration possessed of\r\ninfinitely greater powers than the system established by law. And that\r\nsecond administration has established its conditions, fixed its tariff\r\nof prices, and published that tariff abroad; nor could any ruler, even\r\nthough the wisest of legislators and administrators, do more to correct\r\nthe evil than limit it in the conduct of his more venal tchinovniks by\r\nsetting over them, as their supervisors, men of superior rectitude. No,\r\nuntil each of us shall come to feel that, just as arms were taken up\r\nduring the period of the upheaval of nations, so now each of us must\r\nmake a stand against dishonesty, all remedies will end in failure. As a\r\nRussian, therefore--as one bound to you by consanguinity and identity of\r\nblood--I make to you my appeal. I make it to those of you who understand\r\nwherein lies nobility of thought. I invite those men to remember the\r\nduty which confronts us, whatsoever our respective stations; I invite\r\nthem to observe more closely their duty, and to keep more constantly in\r\nmind their obligations of holding true to their country, in that before\r\nus the future looms dark, and that we can scarcely...."\r\n\r\n                 *****\r\n\r\n   [Here the manuscript of the original comes abruptly to an end.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Essays on Russian Novelists.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
