The principles observed in its composition are, no doubt, too\r\nexclusively those in which mystery, entanglement, surprise, and moral\r\nobliquity are depended on for exciting interest; but some of the scenes,\r\nand at least one of the characters, have been deemed not unworthy of a\r\nlittle longer preservation; and as they could hardly be reproduced in a\r\nfragmentary form the novel is reissued complete--the more readily that\r\nit has for some considerable time been reprinted and widely circulated\r\nin America. January 1889.\r\n\r\nTo the foregoing note I have only to add that, in the present edition of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Desperate Remedies,\xe2\x80\x99 some Wessex towns and other places that are common\r\nto the scenes of several of these stories have been called for the\r\nfirst time by the names under which they appear elsewhere, for the\r\nsatisfaction of any reader who may care for consistency in such matters.\r\n\r\nThis is the only material change; for, as it happened that certain\r\ncharacteristics which provoked most discussion in my latest story were\r\npresent in this my first--published in 1871, when there was no French\r\nname for them it has seemed best to let them stand unaltered.\r\n\r\nT.H. February 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE EVENTS OF THIRTY YEARS\r\n\r\n1. DECEMBER AND JANUARY, 1835-36\r\n\r\nIn the long and intricately inwrought chain of circumstance which\r\nrenders worthy of record some experiences of Cytherea Graye, Edward\r\nSpringrove, and others, the first event directly influencing the issue\r\nwas a Christmas visit.\r\n\r\nIn the above-mentioned year, 1835, Ambrose Graye, a young architect who\r\nhad just begun the practice of his profession in the midland town of\r\nHocbridge, to the north of Christminster, went to London to spend the\r\nChristmas holidays with a friend who lived in Bloomsbury. They had\r\ngone up to Cambridge in the same year, and, after graduating together,\r\nHuntway, the friend, had taken orders.\r\n\r\nGraye was handsome, frank, and gentle. He had a quality of thought\r\nwhich, exercised on homeliness, was humour; on nature, picturesqueness;\r\non abstractions, poetry. Being, as a rule, broadcast, it was all three.\r\n\r\nOf the wickedness of the world he was too forgetful. To discover evil in\r\na new friend is to most people only an additional experience: to him it\r\nwas ever a surprise.\r\n\r\nWhile in London he became acquainted with a retired officer in the\r\nNavy named Bradleigh, who, with his wife and their daughter, lived in\r\na street not far from Russell Square. Though they were in no more than\r\ncomfortable circumstances, the captain\xe2\x80\x99s wife came of an ancient family\r\nwhose genealogical tree was interlaced with some of the most illustrious\r\nand well-known in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe young lady, their daughter, seemed to Graye by far the most\r\nbeautiful and queenly being he had ever beheld. She was about nineteen\r\nor twenty, and her name was Cytherea. In truth she was not so very\r\nunlike country girls of that type of beauty, except in one respect.\r\nShe was perfect in her manner and bearing, and they were not. A mere\r\ndistinguishing peculiarity, by catching the eye, is often read as\r\nthe pervading characteristic, and she appeared to him no less than\r\nperfection throughout--transcending her rural rivals in very nature.\r\nGraye did a thing the blissfulness of which was only eclipsed by its\r\nhazardousness. He loved her at first sight.\r\n\r\nHis introductions had led him into contact with Cytherea and her parents\r\ntwo or three times on the first week of his arrival in London, and\r\naccident and a lover\xe2\x80\x99s contrivance brought them together as frequently\r\nthe week following. The parents liked young Graye, and having few\r\nfriends (for their equals in blood were their superiors in position), he\r\nwas received on very generous terms. His passion for Cytherea grew not\r\nonly strong, but ineffably exalted: she, without positively encouraging\r\nhim, tacitly assented to his schemes for being near her. Her father and\r\nmother seemed to have lost all confidence in nobility of birth, without\r\nmoney to give effect to its presence, and looked upon the budding\r\nconsequence of the young people\xe2\x80\x99s reciprocal glances with placidity, if\r\nnot actual favour.\r\n\r\nGraye\xe2\x80\x99s whole impassioned dream terminated in a sad and unaccountable\r\nepisode. After passing through three weeks of sweet experience, he had\r\narrived at the last stage--a kind of moral Gaza--before plunging into an\r\nemotional desert. The second week in January had come round, and it was\r\nnecessary for the young architect to leave town.\r\n\r\nThroughout his acquaintanceship with the lady of his heart there had\r\nbeen this marked peculiarity in her love: she had delighted in his\r\npresence as a sweetheart should do, yet from first to last she had\r\nrepressed all recognition of the true nature of the thread which\r\ndrew them together, blinding herself to its meaning and only natural\r\ntendency, and appearing to dread his announcement of them. The present\r\nseemed enough for her without cumulative hope: usually, even if love is\r\nin itself an end, it must be regarded as a beginning to be enjoyed.\r\n\r\nIn spite of evasions as an obstacle, and in consequence of them as a\r\nspur, he would put the matter off no longer. It was evening. He took\r\nher into a little conservatory on the landing, and there among the\r\nevergreens, by the light of a few tiny lamps, infinitely enhancing the\r\nfreshness and beauty of the leaves, he made the declaration of a love as\r\nfresh and beautiful as they.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My love--my darling, be my wife!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe seemed like one just awakened. \xe2\x80\x98Ah--we must part now!\xe2\x80\x99 she faltered,\r\nin a voice of anguish. \xe2\x80\x98I will write to you.\xe2\x80\x99 She loosened her hand and\r\nrushed away.\r\n\r\nIn a wild fever Graye went home and watched for the next morning. Who\r\nshall express his misery and wonder when a note containing these words\r\nwas put into his hand?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye; good-bye for ever. As recognized lovers something divides us\r\neternally. Forgive me--I should have told you before; but your love was\r\nsweet! Never mention me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat very day, and as it seemed, to put an end to a painful condition of\r\nthings, daughter and parents left London to pay off a promised visit to\r\na relative in a western county. No message or letter of entreaty could\r\nwring from her any explanation. She begged him not to follow her, and\r\nthe most bewildering point was that her father and mother appeared, from\r\nthe tone of a letter Graye received from them, as vexed and sad as he\r\nat this sudden renunciation. One thing was plain: without admitting her\r\nreason as valid, they knew what that reason was, and did not intend to\r\nreveal it.\r\n\r\nA week from that day Ambrose Graye left his friend Huntway\xe2\x80\x99s house\r\nand saw no more of the Love he mourned. From time to time his friend\r\nanswered any inquiry Graye made by letter respecting her. But very poor\r\nfood to a lover is intelligence of a mistress filtered through a friend.\r\nHuntway could tell nothing definitely. He said he believed there had\r\nbeen some prior flirtation between Cytherea and her cousin, an officer\r\nof the line, two or three years before Graye met her, which had suddenly\r\nbeen terminated by the cousin\xe2\x80\x99s departure for India, and the young\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s travelling on the Continent with her parents the whole of the\r\nensuing summer, on account of delicate health. Eventually Huntway said\r\nthat circumstances had rendered Graye\xe2\x80\x99s attachment more hopeless still.\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s mother had unexpectedly inherited a large fortune and estates\r\nin the west of England by the rapid fall of some intervening lives. This\r\nhad caused their removal from the small house in Bloomsbury, and, as it\r\nappeared, a renunciation of their old friends in that quarter.\r\n\r\nYoung Graye concluded that his Cytherea had forgotten him and his love.\r\nBut he could not forget her.\r\n\r\n2. FROM 1843 TO 1861\r\n\r\nEight years later, feeling lonely and depressed--a man without\r\nrelatives, with many acquaintances but no friends--Ambrose Graye met\r\na young lady of a different kind, fairly endowed with money and good\r\ngifts. As to caring very deeply for another woman after the loss of\r\nCytherea, it was an absolute impossibility with him. With all, the\r\nbeautiful things of the earth become more dear as they elude pursuit;\r\nbut with some natures utter elusion is the one special event which will\r\nmake a passing love permanent for ever.\r\n\r\nThis second young lady and Graye were married. That he did not, first\r\nor last, love his wife as he should have done, was known to all; but\r\nfew knew that his unmanageable heart could never be weaned from useless\r\nrepining at the loss of its first idol.\r\n\r\nHis character to some extent deteriorated, as emotional constitutions\r\nwill under the long sense of disappointment at having missed their\r\nimagined destiny. And thus, though naturally of a gentle and pleasant\r\ndisposition, he grew to be not so tenderly regarded by his acquaintances\r\nas it is the lot of some of those persons to be. The winning and\r\nsanguine receptivity of his early life developed by degrees a moody\r\nnervousness, and when not picturing prospects drawn from baseless hope\r\nhe was the victim of indescribable depression. The practical issue of\r\nsuch a condition was improvidence, originally almost an unconscious\r\nimprovidence, for every debt incurred had been mentally paid off with a\r\nreligious exactness from the treasures of expectation before mentioned.\r\nBut as years revolved, the same course was continued from the lack of\r\nspirit sufficient for shifting out of an old groove when it has been\r\nfound to lead to disaster.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1861 his wife died, leaving him a widower with two children.\r\nThe elder, a son named Owen, now just turned seventeen, was taken from\r\nschool, and initiated as pupil to the profession of architect in his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s office. The remaining child was a daughter, and Owen\xe2\x80\x99s junior\r\nby a year.\r\n\r\nHer christian name was Cytherea, and it is easy to guess why.\r\n\r\n3. OCTOBER THE TWELFTH, 1863\r\n\r\nWe pass over two years in order to reach the next cardinal event of\r\nthese persons\xe2\x80\x99 lives. The scene is still the Grayes\xe2\x80\x99 native town of\r\nHocbridge, but as it appeared on a Monday afternoon in the month of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nThe weather was sunny and dry, but the ancient borough was to be seen\r\nwearing one of its least attractive aspects. First on account of the\r\ntime. It was that stagnant hour of the twenty-four when the practical\r\ngarishness of Day, having escaped from the fresh long shadows and\r\nenlivening newness of the morning, has not yet made any perceptible\r\nadvance towards acquiring those mellow and soothing tones which grace\r\nits decline. Next, it was that stage in the progress of the week when\r\nbusiness--which, carried on under the gables of an old country place,\r\nis not devoid of a romantic sparkle--was well-nigh extinguished. Lastly,\r\nthe town was intentionally bent upon being attractive by exhibiting\r\nto an influx of visitors the local talent for dramatic recitation, and\r\nprovincial towns trying to be lively are the dullest of dull things.\r\n\r\nLittle towns are like little children in this respect, that they\r\ninterest most when they are enacting native peculiarities unconscious\r\nof beholders. Discovering themselves to be watched they attempt to\r\nbe entertaining by putting on an antic, and produce disagreeable\r\ncaricatures which spoil them.\r\n\r\nThe weather-stained clock-face in the low church tower standing at the\r\nintersection of the three chief streets was expressing half-past two\r\nto the Town Hall opposite, where the much talked-of reading from\r\nShakespeare was about to begin. The doors were open, and those persons\r\nwho had already assembled within the building were noticing the entrance\r\nof the new-comers--silently criticizing their dress--questioning the\r\ngenuineness of their teeth and hair--estimating their private means.\r\n\r\nAmong these later ones came an exceptional young maiden who glowed amid\r\nthe dulness like a single bright-red poppy in a field of brown stubble.\r\nShe wore an elegant dark jacket, lavender dress, hat with grey strings\r\nand trimmings, and gloves of a colour to harmonize. She lightly walked\r\nup the side passage of the room, cast a slight glance around, and\r\nentered the seat pointed out to her.\r\n\r\nThe young girl was Cytherea Graye; her age was now about eighteen.\r\nDuring her entry, and at various times whilst sitting in her seat and\r\nlistening to the reader on the platform, her personal appearance formed\r\nan interesting subject of study for several neighbouring eyes.\r\n\r\nHer face was exceedingly attractive, though artistically less perfect\r\nthan her figure, which approached unusually near to the standard of\r\nfaultlessness. But even this feature of hers yielded the palm to the\r\ngracefulness of her movement, which was fascinating and delightful to an\r\nextreme degree.\r\n\r\nIndeed, motion was her speciality, whether shown on its most extended\r\nscale of bodily progression, or minutely, as in the uplifting of\r\nher eyelids, the bending of her fingers, the pouting of her lip. The\r\ncarriage of her head--motion within motion--a glide upon a glide--was\r\nas delicate as that of a magnetic needle. And this flexibility and\r\nelasticity had never been taught her by rule, nor even been acquired by\r\nobservation, but, nullo cultu, had naturally developed itself with her\r\nyears. In childhood, a stone or stalk in the way, which had been the\r\ninevitable occasion of a fall to her playmates, had usually left her\r\nsafe and upright on her feet after the narrowest escape by oscillations\r\nand whirls for the preservation of her balance. At mixed Christmas\r\nparties, when she numbered but twelve or thirteen years, and was\r\nheartily despised on that account by lads who deemed themselves men, her\r\napt lightness in the dance covered this incompleteness in her womanhood,\r\nand compelled the self-same youths in spite of resolutions to seize upon\r\nher childish figure as a partner whom they could not afford to contemn.\r\nAnd in later years, when the instincts of her sex had shown her this\r\npoint as the best and rarest feature in her external self, she was not\r\nfound wanting in attention to the cultivation of finish in its details.\r\n\r\nHer hair rested gaily upon her shoulders in curls and was of a shining\r\ncorn yellow in the high lights, deepening to a definite nut-brown as\r\neach curl wound round into the shade. She had eyes of a sapphire hue,\r\nthough rather darker than the gem ordinarily appears; they possessed\r\nthe affectionate and liquid sparkle of loyalty and good faith as\r\ndistinguishable from that harder brightness which seems to express\r\nfaithfulness only to the object confronting them.\r\n\r\nBut to attempt to gain a view of her--or indeed of any fascinating\r\nwoman--from a measured category, is as difficult as to appreciate the\r\neffect of a landscape by exploring it at night with a lantern--or of a\r\nfull chord of music by piping the notes in succession. Nevertheless it\r\nmay readily be believed from the description here ventured, that\r\namong the many winning phases of her aspect, these were particularly\r\nstriking:--\r\n\r\n  During pleasant doubt, when her eyes brightened stealthily and\r\n  smiled (as eyes will smile) as distinctly as her lips, and in the\r\n  space of a single instant expressed clearly the whole round of\r\n  degrees of expectancy which lie over the wide expanse between Yea\r\n  and Nay.\r\n\r\n  During the telling of a secret, which was involuntarily\r\n  accompanied by a sudden minute start, and ecstatic pressure of\r\n  the listener\xe2\x80\x99s arm, side, or neck, as the position and degree\r\n  of intimacy dictated.\r\n\r\n  When anxiously regarding one who possessed her affections.\r\n\r\nShe suddenly assumed the last-mentioned bearing in the progress of the\r\npresent entertainment. Her glance was directed out of the window.\r\n\r\nWhy the particulars of a young lady\xe2\x80\x99s presence at a very mediocre\r\nperformance were prevented from dropping into the oblivion which their\r\nintrinsic insignificance would naturally have involved--why they were\r\nremembered and individualized by herself and others through after\r\nyears--was simply that she unknowingly stood, as it were, upon the\r\nextreme posterior edge of a tract in her life, in which the real\r\nmeaning of Taking Thought had never been known. It was the last hour of\r\nexperience she ever enjoyed with a mind entirely free from a knowledge\r\nof that labyrinth into which she stepped immediately afterwards--to\r\ncontinue a perplexed course along its mazes for the greater portion of\r\ntwenty-nine subsequent months.\r\n\r\nThe Town Hall, in which Cytherea sat, was a building of brown stone, and\r\nthrough one of the windows could be seen from the interior of the room\r\nthe housetops and chimneys of the adjacent street, and also the upper\r\npart of a neighbouring church spire, now in course of completion under\r\nthe superintendence of Miss Graye\xe2\x80\x99s father, the architect to the work.\r\n\r\nThat the top of this spire should be visible from her position in the\r\nroom was a fact which Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s idling eyes had discovered with some\r\ninterest, and she was now engaged in watching the scene that was being\r\nenacted about its airy summit. Round the conical stonework rose a cage\r\nof scaffolding against the blue sky, and upon this stood five men--four\r\nin clothes as white as the new erection close beneath their hands, the\r\nfifth in the ordinary dark suit of a gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe four working-men in white were three masons and a mason\xe2\x80\x99s labourer.\r\nThe fifth man was the architect, Mr. Graye. He had been giving\r\ndirections as it seemed, and retiring as far as the narrow footway\r\nallowed, stood perfectly still.\r\n\r\nThe picture thus presented to a spectator in the Town Hall was curious\r\nand striking. It was an illuminated miniature, framed in by the dark\r\nmargin of the window, the keen-edged shadiness of which emphasized by\r\ncontrast the softness of the objects enclosed.\r\n\r\nThe height of the spire was about one hundred and twenty feet, and the\r\nfive men engaged thereon seemed entirely removed from the sphere and\r\nexperiences of ordinary human beings. They appeared little larger\r\nthan pigeons, and made their tiny movements with a soft, spirit-like\r\nsilentness. One idea above all others was conveyed to the mind of a\r\nperson on the ground by their aspect, namely, concentration of purpose:\r\nthat they were indifferent to--even unconscious of--the distracted world\r\nbeneath them, and all that moved upon it. They never looked off the\r\nscaffolding.\r\n\r\nThen one of them turned; it was Mr. Graye. Again he stood motionless,\r\nwith attention to the operations of the others. He appeared to be lost\r\nin reflection, and had directed his face towards a new stone they were\r\nlifting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why does he stand like that?\xe2\x80\x99 the young lady thought at length--up to\r\nthat moment as listless and careless as one of the ancient Tarentines,\r\nwho, on such an afternoon as this, watched from the Theatre the entry\r\ninto their Harbour of a power that overturned the State.\r\n\r\nShe moved herself uneasily. \xe2\x80\x98I wish he would come down,\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered,\r\nstill gazing at the skybacked picture. \xe2\x80\x98It is so dangerous to be\r\nabsent-minded up there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen she had done murmuring the words her father indecisively laid hold\r\nof one of the scaffold-poles, as if to test its strength, then let it go\r\nand stepped back. In stepping, his foot slipped. An instant of doubling\r\nforward and sideways, and he reeled off into the air, immediately\r\ndisappearing downwards.\r\n\r\nHis agonized daughter rose to her feet by a convulsive movement. Her\r\nlips parted, and she gasped for breath. She could utter no sound. One by\r\none the people about her, unconscious of what had happened, turned their\r\nheads, and inquiry and alarm became visible upon their faces at the\r\nsight of the poor child. A moment longer, and she fell to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe next impression of which Cytherea had any consciousness was of being\r\ncarried from a strange vehicle across the pavement to the steps of her\r\nown house by her brother and an older man. Recollection of what had\r\npassed evolved itself an instant later, and just as they entered the\r\ndoor--through which another and sadder burden had been carried but a few\r\ninstants before--her eyes caught sight of the south-western sky, and,\r\nwithout heeding, saw white sunlight shining in shaft-like lines from a\r\nrift in a slaty cloud. Emotions will attach themselves to scenes that\r\nare simultaneous--however foreign in essence these scenes may be--as\r\nchemical waters will crystallize on twigs and wires. Even after that\r\ntime any mental agony brought less vividly to Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s mind the scene\r\nfrom the Town Hall windows than sunlight streaming in shaft-like lines.\r\n\r\n4. OCTOBER THE NINETEENTH\r\n\r\nWhen death enters a house, an element of sadness and an element of\r\nhorror accompany it. Sadness, from the death itself: horror, from the\r\nclouds of blackness we designedly labour to introduce.\r\n\r\nThe funeral had taken place. Depressed, yet resolved in his demeanour,\r\nOwen Graye sat before his father\xe2\x80\x99s private escritoire, engaged\r\nin turning out and unfolding a heterogeneous collection of\r\npapers--forbidding and inharmonious to the eye at all times--most of all\r\nto one under the influence of a great grief. Laminae of white paper\r\ntied with twine were indiscriminately intermixed with other white papers\r\nbounded by black edges--these with blue foolscap wrapped round with\r\ncrude red tape.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of these letters, bills, and other documents were submitted\r\nto a careful examination, by which the appended particulars were\r\nascertained:--\r\n\r\n  First, that their father\xe2\x80\x99s income from professional sources had\r\n  been very small, amounting to not more than half their expenditure;\r\n  and that his own and his wife\xe2\x80\x99s property, upon which he had relied\r\n  for the balance, had been sunk and lost in unwise loans to\r\n  unscrupulous men, who had traded upon their father\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\n  open-hearted trustfulness.\r\n\r\n  Second, that finding his mistake, he had endeavoured to regain\r\n  his standing by the illusory path of speculation. The most notable\r\n  instance of this was the following. He had been induced, when at\r\n  Plymouth in the autumn of the previous year, to venture all his\r\n  spare capital on the bottomry security of an Italian brig which\r\n  had put into the harbour in distress. The profit was to be\r\n  considerable, so was the risk. There turned out to be no security\r\n  whatever. The circumstances of the case tendered it the most\r\n  unfortunate speculation that a man like himself--ignorant of all\r\n  such matters--could possibly engage in. The vessel went down, and\r\n  all Mr. Graye\xe2\x80\x99s money with it.\r\n\r\n  Third, that these failures had left him burdened with debts he\r\n  knew not how to meet; so that at the time of his death even the few\r\n  pounds lying to his account at the bank were his only in name.\r\n\r\n  Fourth, that the loss of his wife two years earlier had\r\n  awakened him to a keen sense of his blindness, and of his duty by\r\n  his children. He had then resolved to reinstate by unflagging zeal\r\n  in the pursuit of his profession, and by no speculation, at least a\r\n  portion of the little fortune he had let go.\r\n\r\nCytherea was frequently at her brother\xe2\x80\x99s elbow during these\r\nexaminations. She often remarked sadly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor papa failed to fulfil his good intention for want of time, didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe, Owen? And there was an excuse for his past, though he never would\r\nclaim it. I never forget that original disheartening blow, and how that\r\nfrom it sprang all the ills of his life--everything connected with his\r\ngloom, and the lassitude in business we used so often to see about him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I remember what he said once,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the brother, \xe2\x80\x98when I sat up\r\nlate with him. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cOwen, don\xe2\x80\x99t love too blindly: blindly you\r\nwill love if you love at all, but a little care is still possible to\r\na well-disciplined heart. May that heart be yours as it was not mine,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n father said. \xe2\x80\x9cCultivate the art of renunciation.\xe2\x80\x9d And I am going to,\r\nCytherea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And once mamma said that an excellent woman was papa\xe2\x80\x99s ruin, because he\r\ndid not know the way to give her up when he had lost her. I wonder where\r\nshe is now, Owen? We were told not to try to find out anything about\r\nher. Papa never told us her name, did he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That was by her own request, I believe. But never mind her; she was not\r\nour mother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe love affair which had been Ambrose Graye\xe2\x80\x99s disheartening blow was\r\nprecisely of that nature which lads take little account of, but girls\r\nponder in their hearts.\r\n\r\n5. FROM OCTOBER THE NINETEENTH TO JULY THE NINTH\r\n\r\nThus Ambrose Graye\xe2\x80\x99s good intentions with regard to the reintegration of\r\nhis property had scarcely taken tangible form when his sudden death put\r\nthem for ever out of his power.\r\n\r\nHeavy bills, showing the extent of his obligations, tumbled in\r\nimmediately upon the heels of the funeral from quarters previously\r\nunheard and unthought of. Thus pressed, a bill was filed in Chancery to\r\nhave the assets, such as they were, administered by the Court.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What will become of us now?\xe2\x80\x99 thought Owen continually.\r\n\r\nThere is in us an unquenchable expectation, which at the gloomiest time\r\npersists in inferring that because we are _ourselves_, there must be a\r\nspecial future in store for us, though our nature and antecedents to the\r\nremotest particular have been common to thousands. Thus to Cytherea and\r\nOwen Graye the question how their lives would end seemed the deepest of\r\npossible enigmas. To others who knew their position equally well with\r\nthemselves the question was the easiest that could be asked--\xe2\x80\x98Like those\r\nof other people similarly circumstanced.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Owen held a consultation with his sister to come to some decision\r\non their future course, and a month was passed in waiting for answers to\r\nletters, and in the examination of schemes more or less futile. Sudden\r\nhopes that were rainbows to the sight proved but mists to the touch.\r\nIn the meantime, unpleasant remarks, disguise them as some well-meaning\r\npeople might, were floating around them every day. The undoubted\r\ntruth, that they were the children of a dreamer who let slip away every\r\nfarthing of his money and ran into debt with his neighbours--that the\r\ndaughter had been brought up to no profession--that the son who had, had\r\nmade no progress in it, and might come to the dogs--could not from the\r\nnature of things be wrapped up in silence in order that it might not\r\nhurt their feelings; and as a matter of fact, it greeted their ears in\r\nsome form or other wherever they went. Their few acquaintances passed\r\nthem hurriedly. Ancient pot-wallopers, and thriving shopkeepers, in\r\ntheir intervals of leisure, stood at their shop-doors--their toes\r\nhanging over the edge of the step, and their obese waists hanging over\r\ntheir toes--and in discourses with friends on the pavement, formulated\r\nthe course of the improvident, and reduced the children\xe2\x80\x99s prospects to a\r\nshadow-like attenuation. The sons of these men (who wore breastpins of\r\na sarcastic kind, and smoked humorous pipes) stared at Cytherea with a\r\nstare unmitigated by any of the respect that had formerly softened it.\r\n\r\nNow it is a noticeable fact that we do not much mind what men think of\r\nus, or what humiliating secret they discover of our means, parentage, or\r\nobject, provided that each thinks and acts thereupon in isolation. It is\r\nthe exchange of ideas about us that we dread most; and the possession\r\nby a hundred acquaintances, severally insulated, of the knowledge of our\r\nskeleton-closet\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts, is not so distressing to the nerves as a\r\nchat over it by a party of half-a-dozen--exclusive depositaries though\r\nthese may be.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, though Hocbridge watched and whispered, its animus would have\r\nbeen little more than a trifle to persons in thriving circumstances. But\r\nunfortunately, poverty, whilst it is new, and before the skin has\r\nhad time to thicken, makes people susceptible inversely to their\r\nopportunities for shielding themselves. In Owen was found, in place of\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s impressibility, a larger share of his father\xe2\x80\x99s pride, and a\r\nsquareness of idea which, if coupled with a little more blindness, would\r\nhave amounted to positive prejudice. To him humanity, so far as he had\r\nthought of it at all, was rather divided into distinct classes than\r\nblended from extreme to extreme. Hence by a sequence of ideas which\r\nmight be traced if it were worth while, he either detested or respected\r\nopinion, and instinctively sought to escape a cold shade that mere\r\nsensitiveness would have endured. He could have submitted to separation,\r\nsickness, exile, drudgery, hunger and thirst, with stoical indifference,\r\nbut superciliousness was too incisive.\r\n\r\nAfter living on for nine months in attempts to make an income as his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s successor in the profession--attempts which were utterly\r\nfruitless by reason of his inexperience--Graye came to a simple and\r\nsweeping resolution. They would privately leave that part of England,\r\ndrop from the sight of acquaintances, gossips, harsh critics, and bitter\r\ncreditors of whose misfortune he was not the cause, and escape the\r\nposition which galled him by the only road their great poverty left open\r\nto them--that of his obtaining some employment in a distant place by\r\nfollowing his profession as a humble under-draughtsman.\r\n\r\nHe thought over his capabilities with the sensations of a soldier\r\ngrinding his sword at the opening of a campaign. What with lack of\r\nemployment, owing to the decrease of his late father\xe2\x80\x99s practice, and the\r\nabsence of direct and uncompromising pressure towards monetary results\r\nfrom a pupil\xe2\x80\x99s labour (which seems to be always the case when a\r\nprofessional man\xe2\x80\x99s pupil is also his son), Owen\xe2\x80\x99s progress in the art\r\nand science of architecture had been very insignificant indeed. Though\r\nanything but an idle young man, he had hardly reached the age at which\r\nindustrious men who lack an external whip to send them on in the world,\r\nare induced by their own common sense to whip on themselves. Hence his\r\nknowledge of plans, elevations, sections, and specifications, was not\r\ngreater at the end of two years of probation than might easily have\r\nbeen acquired in six months by a youth of average ability--himself, for\r\ninstance--amid a bustling London practice.\r\n\r\nBut at any rate he could make himself handy to one of the\r\nprofession--some man in a remote town--and there fulfil his indentures.\r\nA tangible inducement lay in this direction of survey. He had a slight\r\nconception of such a man--a Mr. Gradfield--who was in practice in\r\nBudmouth Regis, a seaport town and watering-place in the south of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAfter some doubts, Graye ventured to write to this gentleman, asking the\r\nnecessary question, shortly alluding to his father\xe2\x80\x99s death, and stating\r\nthat his term of apprenticeship had only half expired. He would be glad\r\nto complete his articles at a very low salary for the whole remaining\r\ntwo years, provided payment could begin at once.\r\n\r\nThe answer from Mr. Gradfield stated that he was not in want of a\r\npupil who would serve the remainder of his time on the terms Mr. Graye\r\nmentioned. But he would just add one remark. He chanced to be in want of\r\nsome young man in his office--for a short time only, probably about two\r\nmonths--to trace drawings, and attend to other subsidiary work of the\r\nkind. If Mr. Graye did not object to occupy such an inferior position as\r\nthese duties would entail, and to accept weekly wages which to one with\r\nhis expectations would be considered merely nominal, the post would give\r\nhim an opportunity for learning a few more details of the profession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a beginning, and, above all, an abiding-place, away from the\r\nshadow of the cloud which hangs over us here--I will go,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen.\r\n\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s plan for her future, an intensely simple one, owing to the\r\neven greater narrowness of her resources, was already marked out. One\r\nadvantage had accrued to her through her mother\xe2\x80\x99s possession of a fair\r\nshare of personal property, and perhaps only one. She had been carefully\r\neducated. Upon this consideration her plan was based. She was to take\r\nup her abode in her brother\xe2\x80\x99s lodging at Budmouth, when she would\r\nimmediately advertise for a situation as governess, having obtained\r\nthe consent of a lawyer at Aldbrickham who was winding up her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffairs, and who knew the history of her position, to allow himself to\r\nbe referred to in the matter of her past life and respectability.\r\n\r\nEarly one morning they departed from their native town, leaving behind\r\nthem scarcely a trace of their footsteps.\r\n\r\nThen the town pitied their want of wisdom in taking such a step.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rashness; they would have made a better income in Hocbridge, where they\r\nare known! There is no doubt that they would.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut what is Wisdom really? A steady handling of any means to bring about\r\nany end necessary to happiness.\r\n\r\nYet whether one\xe2\x80\x99s end be the usual end--a wealthy position in life--or\r\nno, the name of wisdom is seldom applied but to the means to that usual\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE EVENTS OF A FORTNIGHT\r\n\r\n1. THE NINTH OF JULY\r\n\r\nThe day of their departure was one of the most glowing that the climax\r\nof a long series of summer heats could evolve. The wide expanse of\r\nlandscape quivered up and down like the flame of a taper, as they\r\nsteamed along through the midst of it. Placid flocks of sheep reclining\r\nunder trees a little way off appeared of a pale blue colour. Clover\r\nfields were livid with the brightness of the sun upon their deep red\r\nflowers. All waggons and carts were moved to the shade by their careful\r\nowners, rain-water butts fell to pieces; well-buckets were lowered\r\ninside the covers of the well-hole, to preserve them from the fate of\r\nthe butts, and generally, water seemed scarcer in the country than the\r\nbeer and cider of the peasantry who toiled or idled there.\r\n\r\nTo see persons looking with children\xe2\x80\x99s eyes at any ordinary scenery, is\r\na proof that they possess the charming faculty of drawing new sensations\r\nfrom an old experience--a healthy sign, rare in these feverish days--the\r\nmark of an imperishable brightness of nature.\r\n\r\nBoth brother and sister could do this; Cytherea more noticeably. They\r\nwatched the undulating corn-lands, monotonous to all their companions;\r\nthe stony and clayey prospect succeeding those, with its angular and\r\nabrupt hills. Boggy moors came next, now withered and dry--the spots\r\nupon which pools usually spread their waters showing themselves as\r\ncircles of smooth bare soil, over-run by a net-work of innumerable\r\nlittle fissures. Then arose plantations of firs, abruptly terminating\r\nbeside meadows cleanly mown, in which high-hipped, rich-coloured cows,\r\nwith backs horizontal and straight as the ridge of a house, stood\r\nmotionless or lazily fed. Glimpses of the sea now interested them, which\r\nbecame more and more frequent till the train finally drew up beside the\r\nplatform at Budmouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The whole town is looking out for us,\xe2\x80\x99 had been Graye\xe2\x80\x99s impression\r\nthroughout the day. He called upon Mr. Gradfield--the only man who had\r\nbeen directly informed of his coming--and found that Mr. Gradfield had\r\nforgotten it.\r\n\r\nHowever, arrangements were made with this gentleman--a stout, active,\r\ngrey-bearded burgher of sixty--by which Owen was to commence work in his\r\noffice the following week.\r\n\r\nThe same day Cytherea drew up and sent off the advertisement appended:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x98A YOUNG LADY is desirous of meeting with an _engagement_ as\r\n  _governess_ or _companion_. She is competent to teach English,\r\n  French, and Music. Satisfactory references--Address, C. G.,\r\n  Post-Office, Budmouth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed a more material existence than her own that she saw thus\r\ndelineated on the paper. \xe2\x80\x98That can\xe2\x80\x99t be myself; how odd I look!\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid, and smiled.\r\n\r\n2. JULY THE ELEVENTH\r\n\r\nOn the Monday subsequent to their arrival in Budmouth, Owen Graye\r\nattended at Mr. Gradfield\xe2\x80\x99s office to enter upon his duties, and his\r\nsister was left in their lodgings alone for the first time.\r\n\r\nDespite the sad occurrences of the preceding autumn, an unwonted\r\ncheerfulness pervaded her spirit throughout the day. Change of\r\nscene--and that to untravelled eyes--conjoined with the sensation of\r\nfreedom from supervision, revived the sparkle of a warm young nature\r\nready enough to take advantage of any adventitious restoratives.\r\nPoint-blank grief tends rather to seal up happiness for a time than to\r\nproduce that attrition which results from griefs of anticipation that\r\nmove onward with the days: these may be said to furrow away the capacity\r\nfor pleasure.\r\n\r\nHer expectations from the advertisement began to be extravagant. A\r\nthriving family, who had always sadly needed her, was already definitely\r\npictured in her fancy, which, in its exuberance, led her on to picturing\r\nits individual members, their possible peculiarities, virtues, and\r\nvices, and obliterated for a time the recollection that she would be\r\nseparated from her brother.\r\n\r\nThus musing, as she waited for his return in the evening, her eyes fell\r\non her left hand. The contemplation of her own left fourth finger by\r\nsymbol-loving girlhood of this age is, it seems, very frequently, if\r\nnot always, followed by a peculiar train of romantic ideas. Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthoughts, still playing about her future, became directed into this\r\nromantic groove. She leant back in her chair, and taking hold of the\r\nfourth finger, which had attracted her attention, she lifted it with the\r\ntips of the others, and looked at the smooth and tapering member for a\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\nShe whispered idly, \xe2\x80\x98I wonder who and what he will be?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If he\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman of fashion, he will take my finger so, just with\r\nthe tips of his own, and with some fluttering of the heart, and the\r\nleast trembling of his lip, slip the ring so lightly on that I shall\r\nhardly know it is there--looking delightfully into my eyes all the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If he\xe2\x80\x99s a bold, dashing soldier, I expect he will proudly turn round,\r\ntake the ring as if it equalled her Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s crown in value, and\r\ndesperately set it on my finger thus. He will fix his eyes unflinchingly\r\nupon what he is doing--just as if he stood in battle before the enemy\r\n(though, in reality, very fond of me, of course), and blush as much as I\r\nshall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If he\xe2\x80\x99s a sailor, he will take my finger and the ring in this way,\r\nand deck it out with a housewifely touch and a tenderness of expression\r\nabout his mouth, as sailors do: kiss it, perhaps, with a simple air, as\r\nif we were children playing an idle game, and not at the very height of\r\nobservation and envy by a great crowd saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! they are happy now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If he should be rather a poor man--noble-minded and affectionate, but\r\nstill poor--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOwen\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps rapidly ascending the stairs, interrupted this\r\nfancy-free meditation. Reproaching herself, even angry with herself\r\nfor allowing her mind to stray upon such subjects in the face of their\r\npresent desperate condition, she rose to meet him, and make tea.\r\n\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s interest to know how her brother had been received at Mr.\r\nGradfield\xe2\x80\x99s broke forth into words at once. Almost before they had sat\r\ndown to table, she began cross-examining him in the regular sisterly\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Owen, how has it been with you to-day? What is the place like--do\r\nyou think you will like Mr. Gradfield?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes. But he has not been there to-day; I have only had the head\r\ndraughtsman with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYoung women have a habit, not noticeable in men, of putting on at a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s notice the drama of whosoever\xe2\x80\x99s life they choose. Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterest was transferred from Mr. Gradfield to his representative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What sort of a man is he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He seems a very nice fellow indeed; though of course I can hardly tell\r\nto a certainty as yet. But I think he\xe2\x80\x99s a very worthy fellow; there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno nonsense in him, and though he is not a public school man he has read\r\nwidely, and has a sharp appreciation of what\xe2\x80\x99s good in books and art.\r\nIn fact, his knowledge isn\xe2\x80\x99t nearly so exclusive as most professional\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal to say of an architect, for of all professional men\r\nthey are, as a rule, the most professional.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; perhaps they are. This man is rather of a melancholy turn of mind,\r\nI think.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has the managing clerk any family?\xe2\x80\x99 she mildly asked, after a while,\r\npouring out some more tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Family; no!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, dear Owen, how should I know?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, of course he isn\xe2\x80\x99t married. But there happened to be a\r\nconversation about women going on in the office, and I heard him say\r\nwhat he should wish his wife to be like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What would he wish his wife to be like?\xe2\x80\x99 she said, with great apparent\r\nlack of interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, he says she must be girlish and artless: yet he would be loth to do\r\nwithout a dash of womanly subtlety, \xe2\x80\x98tis so piquant. Yes, he said, that\r\nmust be in her; she must have womanly cleverness. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I should like\r\nher to blush if only a cock-sparrow were to look at her hard,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhich brings me back to the girl again: and so I flit backwards and\r\nforwards. I must have what comes, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand whatever she\r\nmay be, thank God she\xe2\x80\x99s no worse. However, if he might give a final hint\r\nto Providence,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ca child among pleasures, and a woman among\r\npains was the rough outline of his requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did he say that? What a musing creature he must be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He did, indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n3. FROM THE TWELFTH TO THE FIFTEENTH OF JULY\r\n\r\nAs is well known, ideas are so elastic in a human brain, that they have\r\nno constant measure which may be called their actual bulk. Any important\r\nidea may be compressed to a molecule by an unwonted crowding of others;\r\nand any small idea will expand to whatever length and breadth of vacuum\r\nthe mind may be able to make over to it. Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s world was tolerably\r\nvacant at this time, and the young architectural designer\xe2\x80\x99s image became\r\nvery pervasive. The next evening this subject was again renewed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His name is Springrove,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen, in reply to her. \xe2\x80\x98He is a thorough\r\nartist, but a man of rather humble origin, it seems, who has made\r\nhimself so far. I think he is the son of a farmer, or something of the\r\nkind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s none the worse for that, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None the worse. As we come down the hill, we shall be continually\r\nmeeting people going up.\xe2\x80\x99 But Owen had felt that Springrove was a little\r\nthe worse nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course he\xe2\x80\x99s rather old by this time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no. He\xe2\x80\x99s about six-and-twenty--not more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, I see.... What is he like, Owen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t exactly tell you his appearance: \xe2\x80\x98tis always such a difficult\r\nthing to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A man you would describe as short? Most men are those we should\r\ndescribe as short, I fancy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should call him, I think, of the middle height; but as I only see\r\nhim sitting in the office, of course I am not certain about his form and\r\nfigure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you were, then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps you do. But I am not, you see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course not, you are always so provoking. Owen, I saw a man in the\r\nstreet to-day whom I fancied was he--and yet, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how it could\r\nbe, either. He had light brown hair, a snub nose, very round face, and\r\na peculiar habit of reducing his eyes to straight lines when he looked\r\nnarrowly at anything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no. That was not he, Cytherea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a bit like him in all probability.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a bit. He has dark hair--almost a Grecian nose, regular teeth, and\r\nan intellectual face, as nearly as I can recall to mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, there now, Owen, you _have_ described him! But I suppose he\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\ngenerally called pleasing, or--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Handsome?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I scarcely meant that. But since you have said it, is he handsome?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rather.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His tout ensemble is striking?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--O no, no--I forgot: it is not. He is rather untidy in his\r\nwaistcoat, and neck-ties, and hair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How vexing!... it must be to himself, poor thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a thorough bookworm--despises the pap-and-daisy school of\r\nverse--knows Shakespeare to the very dregs of the foot-notes. Indeed,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s a poet himself in a small way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How delicious!\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98I have never known a poet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you don\xe2\x80\x99t know him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen dryly.\r\n\r\nShe reddened. \xe2\x80\x98Of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I know that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you received any answer to your advertisement?\xe2\x80\x99 he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--no!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, and the forgotten disappointment which had showed\r\nitself in her face at different times during the day, became visible\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAnother day passed away. On Thursday, without inquiry, she learnt more\r\nof the head draughtsman. He and Graye had become very friendly, and he\r\nhad been tempted to show her brother a copy of some poems of his--some\r\nserious and sad--some humorous--which had appeared in the poets\xe2\x80\x99 corner\r\nof a magazine from time to time. Owen showed them now to Cytherea, who\r\ninstantly began to read them carefully and to think them very beautiful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s no fool,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen sententiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No fool!--I should think he isn\xe2\x80\x99t, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, looking up\r\nfrom the paper in quite an excitement: \xe2\x80\x98to write such verses as these!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What logic are you chopping, Cytherea? Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean on account of\r\nthe verses, because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read them; but for what he said when the\r\nfellows were talking about falling in love.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which you will tell me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He says that your true lover breathlessly finds himself engaged to a\r\nsweetheart, like a man who has caught something in the dark. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow whether it is a bat or a bird, and takes it to the light when he is\r\ncool to learn what it is. He looks to see if she is the right age, but\r\nright age or wrong age, he must consider her a prize. Sometime later he\r\nponders whether she is the right kind of prize for him. Right kind or\r\nwrong kind--he has called her his, and must abide by it. After a time he\r\nasks himself, \xe2\x80\x9cHas she the temper, hair, and eyes I meant to have, and\r\nwas firmly resolved not to do without?\xe2\x80\x9d He finds it is all wrong, and\r\nthen comes the tussle--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do they marry and live happily?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who? O, the supposed pair. I think he said--well, I really forget what\r\nhe said.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That _is_ stupid of you!\xe2\x80\x99 said the young lady with dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But he\xe2\x80\x99s a satirist--I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I care about him now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There you are just wrong. He is not. He is, as I believe, an impulsive\r\nfellow who has been made to pay the penalty of his rashness in some love\r\naffair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus ended the dialogue of Thursday, but Cytherea read the verses again\r\nin private. On Friday her brother remarked that Springrove had informed\r\nhim he was going to leave Mr. Gradfield\xe2\x80\x99s in a fortnight to push his\r\nfortunes in London.\r\n\r\nAn indescribable feeling of sadness shot through Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\nWhy should she be sad at such an announcement as that, she thought,\r\nconcerning a man she had never seen, when her spirits were elastic\r\nenough to rebound after hard blows from deep and real troubles as if she\r\nhad scarcely known them? Though she could not answer this question, she\r\nknew one thing, she was saddened by Owen\xe2\x80\x99s news.\r\n\r\n4. JULY THE TWENTY-FIRST\r\n\r\nA very popular local excursion by steamboat to Lulstead Cove was\r\nannounced through the streets of Budmouth one Thursday morning by\r\nthe weak-voiced town-crier, to start at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock the same day. The\r\nweather was lovely, and the opportunity being the first of the kind\r\noffered to them, Owen and Cytherea went with the rest.\r\n\r\nThey had reached the Cove, and had walked landward for nearly an hour\r\nover the hill which rose beside the strand, when Graye recollected that\r\ntwo or three miles yet further inland from this spot was an interesting\r\nmediaeval ruin. He was already familiar with its characteristics through\r\nthe medium of an archaeological work, and now finding himself so close\r\nto the reality, felt inclined to verify some theory he had formed\r\nrespecting it. Concluding that there would be just sufficient time for\r\nhim to go there and return before the boat had left the shore, he parted\r\nfrom Cytherea on the hill, struck downwards, and then up a heathery\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nShe remained on the summit where he had left her till the time of his\r\nexpected return, scanning the details of the prospect around. Placidly\r\nspread out before her on the south was the open Channel, reflecting a\r\nblue intenser by many shades than that of the sky overhead, and dotted\r\nin the foreground by half-a-dozen small craft of contrasting rig, their\r\nsails graduating in hue from extreme whiteness to reddish brown, the\r\nvarying actual colours varied again in a double degree by the rays of\r\nthe declining sun.\r\n\r\nPresently the distant bell from the boat was heard, warning the\r\npassengers to embark. This was followed by a lively air from the harps\r\nand violins on board, their tones, as they arose, becoming intermingled\r\nwith, though not marred by, the brush of the waves when their crests\r\nrolled over--at the point where the check of the shallows was first\r\nfelt--and then thinned away up the slope of pebbles and sand.\r\n\r\nShe turned her face landward and strained her eyes to discern, if\r\npossible, some sign of Owen\xe2\x80\x99s return. Nothing was visible save the\r\nstrikingly brilliant, still landscape. The wide concave which lay at the\r\nback of the hill in this direction was blazing with the western light,\r\nadding an orange tint to the vivid purple of the heather, now at the\r\nvery climax of bloom, and free from the slightest touch of the invidious\r\nbrown that so soon creeps into its shades. The light so intensified the\r\ncolours that they seemed to stand above the surface of the earth and\r\nfloat in mid-air like an exhalation of red. In the minor valleys,\r\nbetween the hillocks and ridges which diversified the contour of the\r\nbasin, but did not disturb its general sweep, she marked brakes of tall,\r\nheavy-stemmed ferns, five or six feet high, in a brilliant light-green\r\ndress--a broad riband of them with the path in their midst winding like\r\na stream along the little ravine that reached to the foot of the hill,\r\nand delivered up the path to its grassy area. Among the ferns grew\r\nholly bushes deeper in tint than any shadow about them, whilst the whole\r\nsurface of the scene was dimpled with small conical pits, and here and\r\nthere were round ponds, now dry, and half overgrown with rushes.\r\n\r\nThe last bell of the steamer rang. Cytherea had forgotten herself, and\r\nwhat she was looking for. In a fever of distress lest Owen should\r\nbe left behind, she gathered up in her hand the corners of her\r\nhandkerchief, containing specimens of the shells, plants, and fossils\r\nwhich the locality produced, started off to the sands, and mingled with\r\nthe knots of visitors there congregated from other interesting points\r\naround; from the inn, the cottages, and hired conveyances that had\r\nreturned from short drives inland. They all went aboard by the primitive\r\nplan of a narrow plank on two wheels--the women being assisted by a\r\nrope. Cytherea lingered till the very last, reluctant to follow,\r\nand looking alternately at the boat and the valley behind. Her delay\r\nprovoked a remark from Captain Jacobs, a thickset man of hybrid stains,\r\nresulting from the mixed effects of fire and water, peculiar to sailors\r\nwhere engines are the propelling power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now then, missy, if you please. I am sorry to tell \xe2\x80\x98ee our time\xe2\x80\x99s up.\r\nWho are you looking for, miss?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My brother--he has walked a short distance inland; he must be here\r\ndirectly. Could you wait for him--just a minute?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really, I am afraid not, m\xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x99 Cytherea looked at the stout,\r\nround-faced man, and at the vessel, with a light in her eyes so\r\nexpressive of her own opinion being the same, on reflection, as his, and\r\nwith such resignation, too, that, from an instinctive feeling of pride\r\nat being able to prove himself more humane than he was thought to\r\nbe--works of supererogation are the only sacrifices that entice in this\r\nway--and that at a very small cost, he delayed the boat till some among\r\nthe passengers began to murmur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea decisively. \xe2\x80\x98Go on without me--I\r\nshall wait for him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, \xe2\x80\x98tis a very awkward thing to leave you here all alone,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\ncaptain. \xe2\x80\x98I certainly advise you not to wait.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s gone across to the railway station, for certain,\xe2\x80\x99 said another\r\npassenger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--here he is!\xe2\x80\x99 Cytherea said, regarding, as she spoke, the half\r\nhidden figure of a man who was seen advancing at a headlong pace down\r\nthe ravine which lay between the heath and the shore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He can\xe2\x80\x99t get here in less than five minutes,\xe2\x80\x99 a passenger said. \xe2\x80\x98People\r\nshould know what they are about, and keep time. Really, if--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the captain, in an apologetic undertone, \xe2\x80\x98since\r\n\xe2\x80\x98tis her brother, and she\xe2\x80\x99s all alone, \xe2\x80\x98tis only nater to wait a minute,\r\nnow he\xe2\x80\x99s in sight. Suppose, now, you were a young woman, as might be,\r\nand had a brother, like this one, and you stood of an evening upon\r\nthis here wild lonely shore, like her, why you\xe2\x80\x99d want us to wait, too,\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you, sir? I think you would.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe person so hastily approaching had been lost to view during this\r\nremark by reason of a hollow in the ground, and the projecting cliff\r\nimmediately at hand covered the path in its rise. His footsteps were\r\nnow heard striking sharply upon the flinty road at a distance of about\r\ntwenty or thirty yards, but still behind the escarpment. To save time,\r\nCytherea prepared to ascend the plank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me give you my hand, miss,\xe2\x80\x99 said Captain Jacobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--please don\xe2\x80\x99t touch me,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, ascending cautiously by sliding\r\none foot forward two or three inches, bringing up the other behind it,\r\nand so on alternately--her lips compressed by concentration on the feat,\r\nher eyes glued to the plank, her hand to the rope, and her immediate\r\nthought to the fact of the distressing narrowness of her footing. Steps\r\nnow shook the lower end of the board, and in an instant were up to her\r\nheels with a bound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, Owen, I am so glad you are come!\xe2\x80\x99 she said without turning. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t shake the plank or touch me, whatever you do.... There, I am up.\r\nWhere have you been so long?\xe2\x80\x99 she continued, in a lower tone, turning\r\nround to him as she reached the top.\r\n\r\nRaising her eyes from her feet, which, standing on the firm deck,\r\ndemanded her attention no longer, she acquired perceptions of the\r\nnew-comer in the following order: unknown trousers; unknown waistcoat;\r\nunknown face. The man was not her brother, but a total stranger.\r\n\r\nOff went the plank; the paddles started, stopped, backed, pattered in\r\nconfusion, then revolved decisively, and the boat passed out into deep\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nOne or two persons had said, \xe2\x80\x98How d\xe2\x80\x99ye do, Mr. Springrove?\xe2\x80\x99 and looked\r\nat Cytherea, to see how she bore her disappointment. Her ears had but\r\njust caught the name of the head draughtsman, when she saw him advancing\r\ndirectly to address her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Graye, I believe?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, lifting his hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, colouring, and trying not to look guilty of a\r\nsurreptitious knowledge of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am Mr. Springrove. I passed Corvsgate Castle about an hour ago, and\r\nsoon afterwards met your brother going that way. He had been deceived in\r\nthe distance, and was about to turn without seeing the ruin, on account\r\nof a lameness that had come on in his leg or foot. I proposed that\r\nhe should go on, since he had got so near; and afterwards, instead of\r\nwalking back to the boat, get across to Anglebury Station--a shorter\r\nwalk for him--where he could catch the late train, and go directly home.\r\nI could let you know what he had done, and allay any uneasiness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is the lameness serious, do you know?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no; simply from over-walking himself. Still, it was just as well to\r\nride home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRelieved from her apprehensions on Owen\xe2\x80\x99s score, she was able slightly\r\nto examine the appearance of her informant--Edward Springrove--who now\r\nremoved his hat for a while, to cool himself. He was rather above her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s height. Although the upper part of his face and head was\r\nhandsomely formed, and bounded by lines of sufficiently masculine\r\nregularity, his brows were somewhat too softly arched, and finely\r\npencilled for one of his sex; without prejudice, however, to the belief\r\nwhich the sum total of his features inspired--that though they did not\r\nprove that the man who thought inside them would do much in the\r\nworld, men who had done most of all had had no better ones. Across his\r\nforehead, otherwise perfectly smooth, ran one thin line, the healthy\r\nfreshness of his remaining features expressing that it had come there\r\nprematurely.\r\n\r\nThough some years short of the age at which the clear spirit bids\r\ngood-bye to the last infirmity of noble mind, and takes to house-hunting\r\nand investments, he had reached the period in a young man\xe2\x80\x99s life when\r\nepisodic periods, with a hopeful birth and a disappointing death, have\r\nbegun to accumulate, and to bear a fruit of generalities; his glance\r\nsometimes seeming to state, \xe2\x80\x98I have already thought out the issue of\r\nsuch conditions as these we are experiencing.\xe2\x80\x99 At other times he wore an\r\nabstracted look: \xe2\x80\x98I seem to have lived through this moment before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was carelessly dressed in dark grey, wearing a rolled-up black\r\nkerchief as a neck-cloth; the knot of which was disarranged, and stood\r\nobliquely--a deposit of white dust having lodged in the creases.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry for your disappointment,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, glancing into\r\nher face. Their eyes having met, became, as it were, mutually locked\r\ntogether, and the single instant only which good breeding allows as\r\nthe length of such a look, became trebled: a clear penetrating ray of\r\nintelligence had shot from each into each, giving birth to one of those\r\nunaccountable sensations which carry home to the heart before the hand\r\nhas been touched or the merest compliment passed, by something stronger\r\nthan mathematical proof, the conviction, \xe2\x80\x98A tie has begun to unite us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBoth faces also unconsciously stated that their owners had been much in\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts of late. Owen had talked to the young architect of\r\nhis sister as freely as to Cytherea of the young architect.\r\n\r\nA conversation began, which was none the less interesting to the parties\r\nengaged because it consisted only of the most trivial and commonplace\r\nremarks. Then the band of harps and violins struck up a lively melody,\r\nand the deck was cleared for dancing; the sun dipping beneath the\r\nhorizon during the proceeding, and the moon showing herself at their\r\nstern. The sea was so calm, that the soft hiss produced by the\r\nbursting of the innumerable bubbles of foam behind the paddles could be\r\ndistinctly heard. The passengers who did not dance, including Cytherea\r\nand Springrove, lapsed into silence, leaning against the paddle-boxes,\r\nor standing aloof--noticing the trembling of the deck to the steps of\r\nthe dance--watching the waves from the paddles as they slid thinly and\r\neasily under each other\xe2\x80\x99s edges.\r\n\r\nNight had quite closed in by the time they reached Budmouth harbour,\r\nsparkling with its white, red, and green lights in opposition to the\r\nshimmering path of the moon\xe2\x80\x99s reflection on the other side, which\r\nreached away to the horizon till the flecked ripples reduced themselves\r\nto sparkles as fine as gold dust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will walk to the station and find out the exact time the train\r\narrives,\xe2\x80\x99 said Springrove, rather eagerly, when they had landed.\r\n\r\nShe thanked him much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps we might walk together,\xe2\x80\x99 he suggested hesitatingly. She looked\r\nas if she did not quite know, and he settled the question by showing the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThey found, on arriving there, that on the first day of that month\r\nthe particular train selected for Graye\xe2\x80\x99s return had ceased to stop at\r\nAnglebury station.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry I misled him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Springrove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, I am not alarmed at all,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Cytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s sure to be all right--he will sleep there, and come by the\r\nfirst in the morning. But what will you do, alone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am quite easy on that point; the landlady is very friendly. I must go\r\nindoors now. Good-night, Mr. Springrove.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me go round to your door with you?\xe2\x80\x99 he pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, thank you; we live close by.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked at her as a waiter looks at the change he brings back. But she\r\nwas inexorable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t--forget me,\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured. She did not answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me see you sometimes,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps you never will again--I am going away,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied in\r\nlingering tones; and turning into Cross Street, ran indoors and\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\nThe sudden withdrawal of what was superfluous at first, is often felt as\r\nan essential loss. It was felt now with regard to the maiden. More, too,\r\nafter a meeting so pleasant and so enkindling, she had seemed to imply\r\nthat they would never come together again.\r\n\r\nThe young man softly followed her, stood opposite the house and watched\r\nher come into the upper room with the light. Presently his gaze was cut\r\nshort by her approaching the window and pulling down the blind--Edward\r\ndwelling upon her vanishing figure with a hopeless sense of loss akin to\r\nthat which Adam is said by logicians to have felt when he first saw the\r\nsun set, and thought, in his inexperience, that it would return no more.\r\n\r\nHe waited till her shadow had twice crossed the window, when, finding\r\nthe charming outline was not to be expected again, he left the street,\r\ncrossed the harbour-bridge, and entered his own solitary chamber on the\r\nother side, vaguely thinking as he went (for undefined reasons),\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98One hope is too like despair\r\n   For prudence to smother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE EVENTS OF EIGHT DAYS\r\n\r\n1. FROM THE TWENTY-SECOND TO THE TWENTY-SEVENTH OF JULY\r\n\r\nBut things are not what they seem. A responsive love for Edward\r\nSpringrove had made its appearance in Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s bosom with all the\r\nfascinating attributes of a first experience, not succeeding to or\r\ndisplacing other emotions, as in older hearts, but taking up entirely\r\nnew ground; as when gazing just after sunset at the pale blue sky we see\r\na star come into existence where nothing was before.\r\n\r\nHis parting words, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget me,\xe2\x80\x99 she repeated to herself a hundred\r\ntimes, and though she thought their import was probably commonplace, she\r\ncould not help toying with them,--looking at them from all points,\r\nand investing them with meanings of love and faithfulness,--ostensibly\r\nentertaining such meanings only as fables wherewith to pass the time,\r\nyet in her heart admitting, for detached instants, a possibility of\r\ntheir deeper truth. And thus, for hours after he had left her, her\r\nreason flirted with her fancy as a kitten will sport with a dove,\r\npleasantly and smoothly through easy attitudes, but disclosing its cruel\r\nand unyielding nature at crises.\r\n\r\nTo turn now to the more material media through which this story moves,\r\nit so happened that the very next morning brought round a circumstance\r\nwhich, slight in itself, took up a relevant and important position\r\nbetween the past and the future of the persons herein concerned.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast time, just as Cytherea had again seen the postman pass\r\nwithout bringing her an answer to the advertisement, as she had fully\r\nexpected he would do, Owen entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, kissing her, \xe2\x80\x98you have not been alarmed, of course.\r\nSpringrove told you what I had done, and you found there was no train?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it was all clear. But what is the lameness owing to?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know--nothing. It has quite gone off now... Cytherea, I hope\r\nyou like Springrove. Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s a nice fellow, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. I think he is, except that--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It happened just to the purpose that I should meet him there, didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit? And when I reached the station and learnt that I could not get on by\r\ntrain my foot seemed better. I started off to walk home, and went about\r\nfive miles along a path beside the railway. It then struck me that I\r\nmight not be fit for anything to-day if I walked and aggravated the\r\nbothering foot, so I looked for a place to sleep at. There was\r\nno available village or inn, and I eventually got the keeper of a\r\ngate-house, where a lane crossed the line, to take me in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey proceeded with their breakfast. Owen yawned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You didn\xe2\x80\x99t get much sleep at the gate-house last night, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid,\r\nOwen,\xe2\x80\x99 said his sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To tell the truth, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I was in such very close and narrow\r\nquarters. Those gate-houses are such small places, and the man had\r\nonly his own bed to offer me. Ah, by-the-bye, Cythie, I have such an\r\nextraordinary thing to tell you in connection with this man!--by Jove,\r\nI had nearly forgotten it! But I\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight on. As I was saying,\r\nhe had only his own bed to offer me, but I could not afford to be\r\nfastidious, and as he had a hearty manner, though a very queer one, I\r\nagreed to accept it, and he made a rough pallet for himself on the floor\r\nclose beside me. Well, I could not sleep for my life, and I wished I had\r\nnot stayed there, though I was so tired. For one thing, there were the\r\nluggage trains rattling by at my elbow the early part of the night. But\r\nworse than this, he talked continually in his sleep, and occasionally\r\nstruck out with his limbs at something or another, knocking against the\r\npost of the bedstead and making it tremble. My condition was altogether\r\nso unsatisfactory that at last I awoke him, and asked him what he had\r\nbeen dreaming about for the previous hour, for I could get no sleep at\r\nall. He begged my pardon for disturbing me, but a name I had casually\r\nlet fall that evening had led him to think of another stranger he had\r\nonce had visit him, who had also accidentally mentioned the same name,\r\nand some very strange incidents connected with that meeting. The affair\r\nhad occurred years and years ago; but what I had said had made him think\r\nand dream about it as if it were but yesterday. What was the word? I\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cCytherea,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. What was the story? I asked then. He then\r\ntold me that when he was a young man in London he borrowed a few pounds\r\nto add to a few he had saved up, and opened a little inn at Hammersmith.\r\nOne evening, after the inn had been open about a couple of months,\r\nevery idler in the neighbourhood ran off to Westminster. The Houses of\r\nParliament were on fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a soul remained in his parlour besides himself, and he began\r\npicking up the pipes and glasses his customers had hastily relinquished.\r\nAt length a young lady about seventeen or eighteen came in. She asked\r\nif a woman was there waiting for herself--Miss Jane Taylor. He said no;\r\nasked the young lady if she would wait, and showed her into the small\r\ninner room. There was a glass-pane in the partition dividing this room\r\nfrom the bar to enable the landlord to see if his visitors, who sat\r\nthere, wanted anything. A curious awkwardness and melancholy about the\r\nbehaviour of the girl who called, caused my informant to look frequently\r\nat her through the partition. She seemed weary of her life, and sat with\r\nher face buried in her hands, evidently quite out of her element in\r\nsuch a house. Then a woman much older came in and greeted Miss Taylor by\r\nname. The man distinctly heard the following words pass between them:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you not brought him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHe is ill; he is not likely to live through the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At this announcement from the elderly woman, the young lady fell to the\r\nfloor in a swoon, apparently overcome by the news. The landlord ran in\r\nand lifted her up. Well, do what they would they could not for a long\r\ntime bring her back to consciousness, and began to be much alarmed. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\r\nis she?\xe2\x80\x9d the innkeeper said to the other woman. \xe2\x80\x9cI know her,\xe2\x80\x9d the other\r\nsaid, with deep meaning in her tone. The elderly and young woman seemed\r\nallied, and yet strangers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She now showed signs of life, and it struck him (he was plainly of an\r\ninquisitive turn), that in her half-bewildered state he might get some\r\ninformation from her. He stooped over her, put his mouth to her ear,\r\nand said sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTo catch a woman napping\r\nis difficult, even when she\xe2\x80\x99s half dead; but I did it,\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\ngatekeeper. When he asked her her name, she said immediately--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cCytherea\xe2\x80\x9d--and stopped suddenly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My own name!\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--your name. Well, the gateman thought at the time it might be\r\nequally with Jane a name she had invented for the occasion, that they\r\nmight not trace her; but I think it was truth unconsciously uttered,\r\nfor she added directly afterwards: \xe2\x80\x9cO, what have I said!\xe2\x80\x9d and was quite\r\novercome again--this time with fright. Her vexation that the woman now\r\ndoubted the genuineness of her other name was very much greater than\r\nthat the innkeeper did, and it is evident that to blind the woman was\r\nher main object. He also learnt from words the elderly woman casually\r\ndropped, that meetings of the same kind had been held before, and that\r\nthe falseness of the soi-disant Miss Jane Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s name had never been\r\nsuspected by this dependent or confederate till then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She recovered, rested there for an hour, and first sending off her\r\ncompanion peremptorily (which was another odd thing), she left the\r\nhouse, offering the landlord all the money she had to say nothing about\r\nthe circumstance. He has never seen her since, according to his\r\nown account. I said to him again and again, \xe2\x80\x9cDid you find any more\r\nparticulars afterwards?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNot a syllable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. O, he should never\r\nhear any more of that! too many years had passed since it happened. \xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\nany rate, you found out her surname?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nsecret,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I should never have been in this part of\r\nthe world if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for that. I failed as a publican, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n I imagine the situation of gateman was given him and his debts paid off\r\nas a bribe to silence; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t say. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a long\r\nbreath. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never heard that name mentioned since that time till\r\nto-night, and then there instantly rose to my eyes the vision of that\r\nyoung lady lying in a fainting fit.\xe2\x80\x9d He then stopped talking and fell\r\nasleep. Telling the story must have relieved him as it did the Ancient\r\nMariner, for he did not move a muscle or make another sound for the\r\nremainder of the night. Now isn\xe2\x80\x99t that an odd story?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 Cytherea murmured. \xe2\x80\x98Very, very strange.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why should she have said your most uncommon name?\xe2\x80\x99 continued Owen. \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nman was evidently truthful, for there was not motive sufficient for his\r\ninvention of such a tale, and he could not have done it either.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea looked long at her brother. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you recognize anything else\r\nin connection with the story?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you remember what poor papa once let drop--that Cytherea was\r\nthe name of his first sweetheart in Bloomsbury, who so mysteriously\r\nrenounced him? A sort of intuition tells me that this was the same\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no--not likely,\xe2\x80\x99 said her brother sceptically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How not likely, Owen? There\xe2\x80\x99s not another woman of the name in England.\r\nIn what year used papa to say the event took place?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eighteen hundred and thirty-five.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And when were the Houses of Parliament burnt?--stop, I can tell you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nShe searched their little stock of books for a list of dates, and found\r\none in an old school history.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Houses of Parliament were burnt down in the evening of the\r\nsixteenth of October, eighteen hundred and thirty-four.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nearly a year and a quarter before she met father,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Owen.\r\n\r\nThey were silent. \xe2\x80\x98If papa had been alive, what a wonderful absorbing\r\ninterest this story would have had for him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea by-and-by.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how strangely knowledge comes to us. We might have searched for a\r\nclue to her secret half the world over, and never found one. If we had\r\nreally had any motive for trying to discover more of the sad history\r\nthan papa told us, we should have gone to Bloomsbury; but not caring to\r\ndo so, we go two hundred miles in the opposite direction, and there\r\nfind information waiting to be told us. What could have been the secret,\r\nOwen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Heaven knows. But our having heard a little more of her in this way (if\r\nshe is the same woman) is a mere coincidence after all--a family story\r\nto tell our friends if we ever have any. But we shall never know any\r\nmore of the episode now--trust our fates for that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea sat silently thinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was no answer this morning to your advertisement, Cytherea?\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could see that by your looks when I came in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fancy not getting a single one,\xe2\x80\x99 she said sadly. \xe2\x80\x98Surely there must be\r\npeople somewhere who want governesses?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; but those who want them, and can afford to have them, get them\r\nmostly by friends\xe2\x80\x99 recommendations; whilst those who want them, and\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t afford to have them, make use of their poor relations.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What shall I do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind it. Go on living with me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let the difficulty trouble\r\nyour mind so; you think about it all day. I can keep you, Cythie, in a\r\nplain way of living. Twenty-five shillings a week do not amount to\r\nmuch truly; but then many mechanics have no more, and we live quite as\r\nsparingly as journeymen mechanics... It is a meagre narrow life we are\r\ndrifting into,\xe2\x80\x99 he added gloomily, \xe2\x80\x98but it is a degree more tolerable\r\nthan the worrying sensation of all the world being ashamed of you, which\r\nwe experienced at Hocbridge.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go back there again,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor I. O, I don\xe2\x80\x99t regret our course for a moment. We did quite right in\r\ndropping out of the world.\xe2\x80\x99 The sneering tones of the remark were almost\r\ntoo laboured to be real. \xe2\x80\x98Besides,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, \xe2\x80\x98something better for\r\nme is sure to turn up soon. I wish my engagement here was a permanent\r\none instead of for only two months. It may, certainly, be for a longer\r\ntime, but all is uncertain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I could get something to do; and I must too,\xe2\x80\x99 she said firmly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suppose, as is very probable, you are not wanted after the beginning of\r\nOctober--the time Mr. Gradfield mentioned--what should we do if I were\r\ndependent on you only throughout the winter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey pondered on numerous schemes by which a young lady might be\r\nsupposed to earn a decent livelihood--more or less convenient and\r\nfeasible in imagination, but relinquished them all until advertising had\r\nbeen once more tried, this time taking lower ground. Cytherea was vexed\r\nat her temerity in having represented to the world that so inexperienced\r\na being as herself was a qualified governess; and had a fancy that this\r\npresumption of hers might be one reason why no ladies applied. The new\r\nand humbler attempt appeared in the following form:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x98NURSERY GOVERNESS OR USEFUL COMPANION. A young person wishes to\r\n  hear of a situation in either of the above capacities. Salary very\r\n  moderate. She is a good needle-woman--Address G., 3 Cross Street,\r\n  Budmouth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evening they went to post the letter, and then walked up and down\r\nthe Parade for a while. Soon they met Springrove, said a few words\r\nto him, and passed on. Owen noticed that his sister\xe2\x80\x99s face had become\r\ncrimson. Rather oddly they met Springrove again in a few minutes. This\r\ntime the three walked a little way together, Edward ostensibly talking\r\nto Owen, though with a single thought to the reception of his words by\r\nthe maiden at the farther side, upon whom his gaze was mostly resting,\r\nand who was attentively listening--looking fixedly upon the pavement the\r\nwhile. It has been said that men love with their eyes; women with their\r\nears.\r\n\r\nAs Owen and himself were little more than acquaintances as yet, and as\r\nSpringrove was wanting in the assurance of many men of his age, it now\r\nbecame necessary to wish his friends good-evening, or to find a reason\r\nfor continuing near Cytherea by saying some nice new thing. He thought\r\nof a new thing; he proposed a pull across the bay. This was assented\r\nto. They went to the pier; stepped into one of the gaily painted boats\r\nmoored alongside and sheered off. Cytherea sat in the stern steering.\r\n\r\nThey rowed that evening; the next came, and with it the necessity of\r\nrowing again. Then the next, and the next, Cytherea always sitting in\r\nthe stern with the tiller ropes in her hand. The curves of her figure\r\nwelded with those of the fragile boat in perfect continuation, as she\r\ngirlishly yielded herself to its heaving and sinking, seeming to form\r\nwith it an organic whole.\r\n\r\nThen Owen was inclined to test his skill in paddling a canoe. Edward\r\ndid not like canoes, and the issue was, that, having seen Owen on board,\r\nSpringrove proposed to pull off after him with a pair of sculls; but\r\nnot considering himself sufficiently accomplished to do finished rowing\r\nbefore a parade full of promenaders when there was a little swell on,\r\nand with the rudder unshipped in addition, he begged that Cytherea might\r\ncome with him and steer as before. She stepped in, and they floated\r\nalong in the wake of her brother. Thus passed the fifth evening on the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nBut the sympathetic pair were thrown into still closer companionship,\r\nand much more exclusive connection.\r\n\r\n2. JULY THE TWENTY-NINTH\r\n\r\nIt was a sad time for Cytherea--the last day of Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s management\r\nat Gradfield\xe2\x80\x99s, and the last evening before his return from Budmouth to\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s house, previous to his departure for London.\r\n\r\nGraye had been requested by the architect to survey a plot of land\r\nnearly twenty miles off, which, with the journey to and fro, would\r\noccupy him the whole day, and prevent his returning till late in the\r\nevening. Cytherea made a companion of her landlady to the extent of\r\nsharing meals and sitting with her during the morning of her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s absence. Mid-day found her restless and miserable under this\r\narrangement. All the afternoon she sat alone, looking out of the window\r\nfor she scarcely knew whom, and hoping she scarcely knew what. Half-past\r\nfive o\xe2\x80\x99clock came--the end of Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s official day. Two minutes\r\nlater Springrove walked by.\r\n\r\nShe endured her solitude for another half-hour, and then could endure no\r\nlonger. She had hoped--while affecting to fear--that Edward would have\r\nfound some reason or other for calling, but it seemed that he had not.\r\nHastily dressing herself she went out, when the farce of an accidental\r\nmeeting was repeated. Edward came upon her in the street at the first\r\nturning, and, like the Great Duke Ferdinand in \xe2\x80\x98The Statue and the\r\nBust\xe2\x80\x99--\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98He looked at her as a lover can;\r\n   She looked at him as one who awakes--\r\n   The past was a sleep, and her life began.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall we have a boat?\xe2\x80\x99 he said impulsively.\r\n\r\nHow blissful it all is at first. Perhaps, indeed, the only bliss in\r\nthe course of love which can truly be called Eden-like is that which\r\nprevails immediately after doubt has ended and before reflection has set\r\nin--at the dawn of the emotion, when it is not recognized by name, and\r\nbefore the consideration of what this love is, has given birth to the\r\nconsideration of what difficulties it tends to create; when on the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart, the mistress appears to the mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye in picturesque, hazy, and\r\nfresh morning lights, and soft morning shadows; when, as yet, she is\r\nknown only as the wearer of one dress, which shares her own personality;\r\nas the stander in one special position, the giver of one bright\r\nparticular glance, and the speaker of one tender sentence; when, on\r\nher part, she is timidly careful over what she says and does, lest she\r\nshould be misconstrued or under-rated to the breadth of a shadow of a\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall we have a boat?\xe2\x80\x99 he said again, more softly, seeing that to\r\nhis first question she had not answered, but looked uncertainly at the\r\nground, then almost, but not quite, in his face, blushed a series of\r\nminute blushes, left off in the midst of them, and showed the usual\r\nsigns of perplexity in a matter of the emotions.\r\n\r\nOwen had always been with her before, but there was now a force of habit\r\nin the proceeding, and with Arcadian innocence she assumed that a row on\r\nthe water was, under any circumstances, a natural thing. Without another\r\nword being spoken on either side, they went down the steps. He carefully\r\nhanded her in, took his seat, slid noiselessly off the sand, and away\r\nfrom the shore.\r\n\r\nThey thus sat facing each other in the graceful yellow cockle-shell,\r\nand his eyes frequently found a resting-place in the depths of hers. The\r\nboat was so small that at each return of the sculls, when his hands came\r\nforward to begin the pull, they approached so near to her that her vivid\r\nimagination began to thrill her with a fancy that he was going to clasp\r\nhis arms round her. The sensation grew so strong that she could not run\r\nthe risk of again meeting his eyes at those critical moments, and turned\r\naside to inspect the distant horizon; then she grew weary of looking\r\nsideways, and was driven to return to her natural position again. At\r\nthis instant he again leant forward to begin, and met her glance by\r\nan ardent fixed gaze. An involuntary impulse of girlish embarrassment\r\ncaused her to give a vehement pull at the tiller-rope, which brought the\r\nboat\xe2\x80\x99s head round till they stood directly for shore.\r\n\r\nHis eyes, which had dwelt upon her form during the whole time of her\r\nlook askance, now left her; he perceived the direction in which they\r\nwere going.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, you have completely turned the boat, Miss Graye?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, looking\r\nover his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x98Look at our track on the water--a great semicircle,\r\npreceded by a series of zigzags as far as we can see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked attentively. \xe2\x80\x98Is it my fault or yours?\xe2\x80\x99 she inquired. \xe2\x80\x98Mine,\r\nI suppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t help saying that it is yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe dropped the ropes decisively, feeling the slightest twinge of\r\nvexation at the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why do you let go?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do it so badly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no; you turned about for shore in a masterly way. Do you wish to\r\nreturn?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, if you please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course, then, I will at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fear what the people will think of us--going in such absurd\r\ndirections, and all through my wretched steering.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind what the people think.\xe2\x80\x99 A pause. \xe2\x80\x98You surely are not so weak\r\nas to mind what the people think on such a matter as that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThose words might almost be called too firm and hard to be given by him\r\nto her; but never mind. For almost the first time in her life she felt\r\nthe charming sensation, although on such an insignificant subject, of\r\nbeing compelled into an opinion by a man she loved. Owen, though\r\nless yielding physically, and more practical, would not have had the\r\nintellectual independence to answer a woman thus. She replied quietly\r\nand honestly--as honestly as when she had stated the contrary fact a\r\nminute earlier--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll unship the tiller that you may have nothing to do going back but\r\nto hold your parasol,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, and arose to perform the operation,\r\nnecessarily leaning closely against her, to guard against the risk\r\nof capsizing the boat as he reached his hands astern. His warm breath\r\ntouched and crept round her face like a caress; but he was apparently\r\nonly concerned with his task. She looked guilty of something when he\r\nseated himself. He read in her face what that something was--she had\r\nexperienced a pleasure from his touch. But he flung a practical glance\r\nover his shoulder, seized the oars, and they sped in a straight line\r\ntowards the shore.\r\n\r\nCytherea saw that he noted in her face what had passed in her heart,\r\nand that noting it, he continued as decided as before. She was inwardly\r\ndistressed. She had not meant him to translate her words about returning\r\nhome so literally at the first; she had not intended him to learn her\r\nsecret; but more than all she was not able to endure the perception of\r\nhis learning it and continuing unmoved.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing but misery to come now. They would step ashore; he\r\nwould say good-night, go to London to-morrow, and the miserable She\r\nwould lose him for ever. She did not quite suppose what was the fact,\r\nthat a parallel thought was simultaneously passing through his mind.\r\n\r\nThey were now within ten yards, now within five; he was only now waiting\r\nfor a \xe2\x80\x98smooth\xe2\x80\x99 to bring the boat in. Sweet, sweet Love must not be\r\nslain thus, was the fair maid\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning. She was equal to the\r\noccasion--ladies are--and delivered the god--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you want very much to land, Mr. Springrove?\xe2\x80\x99 she said, letting her\r\nyoung violet eyes pine at him a very, very little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I? Not at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, looking an astonishment at her inquiry which a\r\nslight twinkle of his eye half belied. \xe2\x80\x98But you do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think that now we have come out, and it is such a pleasant evening,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe said gently and sweetly, \xe2\x80\x98I should like a little longer row if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind? I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to steer better than before if it makes it easier\r\nfor you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try very hard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was the turn of his face to tell a tale now. He looked, \xe2\x80\x98We\r\nunderstand each other--ah, we do, darling!\xe2\x80\x99 turned the boat, and pulled\r\nback into the Bay once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now steer wherever you will,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x98Never mind the\r\ndirectness of the course--wherever you will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall it be Creston Shore?\xe2\x80\x99 she said, pointing to a stretch of beach\r\nnorthward from Budmouth Esplanade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Creston Shore certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 he responded, grasping the sculls. She took\r\nthe strings daintily, and they wound away to the left.\r\n\r\nFor a long time nothing was audible in the boat but the regular dip\r\nof the oars, and their movement in the rowlocks. Springrove at length\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must go away to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 he said tentatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To endeavour to advance a little in my profession in London.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 she said again, with the same preoccupied softness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I shan\xe2\x80\x99t advance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why not? Architecture is a bewitching profession. They say that an\r\narchitect\xe2\x80\x99s work is another man\xe2\x80\x99s play.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. But worldly advantage from an art doesn\xe2\x80\x99t depend upon mastering\r\nit. I used to think it did; but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. Those who get rich need have\r\nno skill at all as artists.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What need they have?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A certain kind of energy which men with any fondness for art possess\r\nvery seldom indeed--an earnestness in making acquaintances, and a love\r\nfor using them. They give their whole attention to the art of\r\ndining out, after mastering a few rudimentary facts to serve up in\r\nconversation. Now after saying that, do I seem a man likely to make a\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You seem a man likely to make a mistake.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To give too much room to the latent feeling which is rather common\r\nin these days among the unappreciated, that because some remarkably\r\nsuccessful men are fools, all remarkably unsuccessful men are geniuses.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pretty subtle for a young lady,\xe2\x80\x99 he said slowly. \xe2\x80\x98From that remark I\r\nshould fancy you had bought experience.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe passed over the idea. \xe2\x80\x98Do try to succeed,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, with wistful\r\nthoughtfulness, leaving her eyes on him.\r\n\r\nSpringrove flushed a little at the earnestness of her words, and mused.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, like Cato the Censor, I shall do what I despise, to be in the\r\nfashion,\xe2\x80\x99 he said at last... \xe2\x80\x98Well, when I found all this out that I\r\nwas speaking of, what ever do you think I did? From having already\r\nloved verse passionately, I went on to read it continually; then I went\r\nrhyming myself. If anything on earth ruins a man for useful occupation,\r\nand for content with reasonable success in a profession or trade, it is\r\nthe habit of writing verses on emotional subjects, which had much better\r\nbe left to die from want of nourishment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you write poems now?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None. Poetical days are getting past with me, according to the usual\r\nrule. Writing rhymes is a stage people of my sort pass through, as they\r\npass through the stage of shaving for a beard, or thinking they are\r\nill-used, or saying there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in the world worth living for.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then the difference between a common man and a recognized poet is, that\r\none has been deluded, and cured of his delusion, and the other continues\r\ndeluded all his days.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s just enough truth in what you say, to make the remark\r\nunbearable. However, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter to me now that I \xe2\x80\x9cmeditate the\r\nthankless Muse\xe2\x80\x9d no longer, but....\xe2\x80\x99 He paused, as if endeavouring to\r\nthink what better thing he did.\r\n\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s mind ran on to the succeeding lines of the poem, and their\r\nstartling harmony with the present situation suggested the fancy that he\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x98sporting\xe2\x80\x99 with her, and brought an awkward contemplativeness to her\r\nface.\r\n\r\nSpringrove guessed her thoughts, and in answer to them simply said\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99 Then they were silent again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I had known an Amaryllis was coming here, I should not have made\r\narrangements for leaving,\xe2\x80\x99 he resumed.\r\n\r\nSuch levity, superimposed on the notion of \xe2\x80\x98sport\xe2\x80\x99, was intolerable to\r\nCytherea; for a woman seems never to see any but the serious side of her\r\nattachment, though the most devoted lover has all the time a vague and\r\ndim perception that he is losing his old dignity and frittering away his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But will you not try again to get on in your profession? Try once\r\nmore; do try once more,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured. \xe2\x80\x98I am going to try again. I have\r\nadvertised for something to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I will,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, with an eager gesture and smile. \xe2\x80\x98But we\r\nmust remember that the fame of Christopher Wren himself depended upon\r\nthe accident of a fire in Pudding Lane. My successes seem to come very\r\nslowly. I often think, that before I am ready to live, it will be time\r\nfor me to die. However, I am trying--not for fame now, but for an easy\r\nlife of reasonable comfort.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt is a melancholy truth for the middle classes, that in proportion\r\nas they develop, by the study of poetry and art, their capacity for\r\nconjugal love of the highest and purest kind, they limit the possibility\r\nof their being able to exercise it--the very act putting out of their\r\npower the attainment of means sufficient for marriage. The man who works\r\nup a good income has had no time to learn love to its solemn extreme;\r\nthe man who has learnt that has had no time to get rich.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And if you should fail--utterly fail to get that reasonable wealth,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe said earnestly, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t be perturbed. The truly great stand upon no\r\nmiddle ledge; they are either famous or unknown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unknown,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98if their ideas have been allowed to flow with\r\na sympathetic breadth. Famous only if they have been convergent and\r\nexclusive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; and I am afraid from that, that my remark was but discouragement,\r\nwearing the dress of comfort. Perhaps I was not quite right in--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It depends entirely upon what is meant by being truly great. But the\r\nlong and the short of the matter is, that men must stick to a thing if\r\nthey want to succeed in it--not giving way to over-much admiration\r\nfor the flowers they see growing in other people\xe2\x80\x99s borders; which I am\r\nafraid has been my case.\xe2\x80\x99 He looked into the far distance and paused.\r\n\r\nAdherence to a course with persistence sufficient to ensure success is\r\npossible to widely appreciative minds only when there is also found\r\nin them a power--commonplace in its nature, but rare in such\r\ncombination--the power of assuming to conviction that in the outlying\r\npaths which appear so much more brilliant than their own, there are\r\nbitternesses equally great--unperceived simply on account of their\r\nremoteness.\r\n\r\nThey were opposite Ringsworth Shore. The cliffs here were formed of\r\nstrata completely contrasting with those of the further side of the Bay,\r\nwhilst in and beneath the water hard boulders had taken the place of\r\nsand and shingle, between which, however, the sea glided noiselessly,\r\nwithout breaking the crest of a single wave, so strikingly calm was the\r\nair. The breeze had entirely died away, leaving the water of that rare\r\nglassy smoothness which is unmarked even by the small dimples of the\r\nleast aerial movement. Purples and blues of divers shades were reflected\r\nfrom this mirror accordingly as each undulation sloped east or west.\r\nThey could see the rocky bottom some twenty feet beneath them,\r\nluxuriant with weeds of various growths, and dotted with pulpy creatures\r\nreflecting a silvery and spangled radiance upwards to their eyes.\r\n\r\nAt length she looked at him to learn the effect of her words of\r\nencouragement. He had let the oars drift alongside, and the boat had\r\ncome to a standstill. Everything on earth seemed taking a contemplative\r\nrest, as if waiting to hear the avowal of something from his lips. At\r\nthat instant he appeared to break a resolution hitherto zealously kept.\r\nLeaving his seat amidships he came and gently edged himself down beside\r\nher upon the narrow seat at the stern.\r\n\r\nShe breathed more quickly and warmly: he took her right hand in his own\r\nright: it was not withdrawn. He put his left hand behind her neck till\r\nit came round upon her left cheek: it was not thrust away. Lightly\r\npressing her, he brought her face and mouth towards his own; when, at\r\nthis the very brink, some unaccountable thought or spell within him\r\nsuddenly made him halt--even now, and as it seemed as much to himself as\r\nto her, he timidly whispered \xe2\x80\x98May I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer endeavour was to say No, so denuded of its flesh and sinews that its\r\nnature would hardly be recognized, or in other words a No from so near\r\nthe affirmative frontier as to be affected with the Yes accent. It was\r\nthus a whispered No, drawn out to nearly a quarter of a minute\xe2\x80\x99s length,\r\nthe O making itself audible as a sound like the spring coo of a pigeon\r\non unusually friendly terms with its mate. Though conscious of her\r\nsuccess in producing the kind of word she had wished to produce, she at\r\nthe same time trembled in suspense as to how it would be taken. But the\r\ntime available for doubt was so short as to admit of scarcely more than\r\nhalf a pulsation: pressing closer he kissed her. Then he kissed her\r\nagain with a longer kiss.\r\n\r\nIt was the supremely happy moment of their experience. The \xe2\x80\x98bloom\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98purple light\xe2\x80\x99 were strong on the lineaments of both. Their hearts\r\ncould hardly believe the evidence of their lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I love you, and you love me, Cytherea!\xe2\x80\x99 he whispered.\r\n\r\nShe did not deny it; and all seemed well. The gentle sounds around them\r\nfrom the hills, the plains, the distant town, the adjacent shore, the\r\nwater heaving at their side, the kiss, and the long kiss, were all \xe2\x80\x98many\r\na voice of one delight,\xe2\x80\x99 and in unison with each other.\r\n\r\nBut his mind flew back to the same unpleasant thought which had been\r\nconnected with the resolution he had broken a minute or two earlier. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ncould be a slave at my profession to win you, Cytherea; I would work at\r\nthe meanest, honest trade to be near you--much less claim you as mine; I\r\nwould--anything. But I have not told you all; it is not this; you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what there is yet to tell. Could you forgive as you can love?\xe2\x80\x99 She\r\nwas alarmed to see that he had become pale with the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--do not speak,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98I have kept something from you, which has\r\nnow become the cause of a great uneasiness. I had no right--to love you;\r\nbut I did it. Something forbade--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Something forbade me--till the kiss--yes, till the kiss came; and now\r\nnothing shall forbid it! We\xe2\x80\x99ll hope in spite of all... I must, however,\r\nspeak of this love of ours to your brother. Dearest, you had better go\r\nindoors whilst I meet him at the station, and explain everything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s short-lived bliss was dead and gone. O, if she had known of\r\nthis sequel would she have allowed him to break down the barrier of mere\r\nacquaintanceship--never, never!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you not explain to me?\xe2\x80\x99 she faintly urged. Doubt--indefinite,\r\ncarking doubt had taken possession of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not now. You alarm yourself unnecessarily,\xe2\x80\x99 he said tenderly. \xe2\x80\x98My only\r\nreason for keeping silence is that with my present knowledge I may tell\r\nan untrue story. It may be that there is nothing to tell. I am to blame\r\nfor haste in alluding to any such thing. Forgive me, sweet--forgive me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHer heart was ready to burst, and she could not answer him. He returned\r\nto his place and took to the oars.\r\n\r\nThey again made for the distant Esplanade, now, with its line of houses,\r\nlying like a dark grey band against the light western sky. The sun\r\nhad set, and a star or two began to peep out. They drew nearer their\r\ndestination, Edward as he pulled tracing listlessly with his eyes the\r\nred stripes upon her scarf, which grew to appear as black ones in the\r\nincreasing dusk of evening. She surveyed the long line of lamps on the\r\nsea-wall of the town, now looking small and yellow, and seeming to send\r\nlong tap-roots of fire quivering down deep into the sea. By-and-by they\r\nreached the landing-steps. He took her hand as before, and found it as\r\ncold as the water about them. It was not relinquished till he reached\r\nher door. His assurance had not removed the constraint of her manner:\r\nhe saw that she blamed him mutely and with her eyes, like a captured\r\nsparrow. Left alone, he went and seated himself in a chair on the\r\nEsplanade.\r\n\r\nNeither could she go indoors to her solitary room, feeling as she did\r\nin such a state of desperate heaviness. When Springrove was out of sight\r\nshe turned back, and arrived at the corner just in time to see him\r\nsit down. Then she glided pensively along the pavement behind him,\r\nforgetting herself to marble like Melancholy herself as she mused in his\r\nneighbourhood unseen. She heard, without heeding, the notes of pianos\r\nand singing voices from the fashionable houses at her back, from the\r\nopen windows of which the lamp-light streamed to join that of the\r\norange-hued full moon, newly risen over the Bay in front. Then Edward\r\nbegan to pace up and down, and Cytherea, fearing that he would notice\r\nher, hastened homeward, flinging him a last look as she passed out of\r\nsight. No promise from him to write: no request that she herself would\r\ndo so--nothing but an indefinite expression of hope in the face of some\r\nfear unknown to her. Alas, alas!\r\n\r\nWhen Owen returned he found she was not in the small sitting-room, and\r\ncreeping upstairs into her bedroom with a light, he discovered her there\r\nlying asleep upon the coverlet of the bed, still with her hat and\r\njacket on. She had flung herself down on entering, and succumbed to\r\nthe unwonted oppressiveness that ever attends full-blown love. The wet\r\ntraces of tears were yet visible upon her long drooping lashes.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98Love is a sowre delight, and sugred griefe,\r\n     A living death, and ever-dying life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cytherea,\xe2\x80\x99 he whispered, kissing her. She awoke with a start, and\r\nvented an exclamation before recovering her judgment. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s gone!\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has told me all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Graye soothingly. \xe2\x80\x98He is going off early\r\nto-morrow morning. \xe2\x80\x98Twas a shame of him to win you away from me, and\r\ncruel of you to keep the growth of this attachment a secret.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, and then jumping up--\xe2\x80\x98Owen, has he told\r\nyou _all_?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All of your love from beginning to end,\xe2\x80\x99 he said simply.\r\n\r\nEdward then had not told more--as he ought to have done: yet she could\r\nnot convict him. But she would struggle against his fetters. She tingled\r\nto the very soles of her feet at the very possibility that he might be\r\ndeluding her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Owen,\xe2\x80\x99 she continued, with dignity, \xe2\x80\x98what is he to me? Nothing. I must\r\ndismiss such weakness as this--believe me, I will. Something far more\r\npressing must drive it away. I have been looking my position steadily\r\nin the face, and I must get a living somehow. I mean to advertise once\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Advertising is no use.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This one will be.\xe2\x80\x99 He looked surprised at the sanguine tone of her\r\nanswer, till she took a piece of paper from the table and showed it him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98See what I am going to do,\xe2\x80\x99 she said sadly, almost bitterly. This was\r\nher third effort:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x98LADY\xe2\x80\x99S-MAID. Inexperienced. Age eighteen.--G., 3 Cross Street,\r\n  Budmouth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nOwen--Owen the respectable--looked blank astonishment. He repeated in a\r\nnameless, varying tone, the two words--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid. \xe2\x80\x98Tis an honest profession,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea bravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But _you_, Cytherea?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I--who am I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will never be a lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid--never, I am quite sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall try to be, at any rate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Such a disgrace--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense! I maintain that it is no disgrace!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, rather warmly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know very well--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, since you will, you must,\xe2\x80\x99 he interrupted. \xe2\x80\x98Why do you put\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cinexperienced?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind that--scratch out \xe2\x80\x9cinexperienced.\xe2\x80\x9d We are poor, Cytherea,\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured, after a silence, \xe2\x80\x98and it seems that the two\r\nmonths will close my engagement here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We can put up with being poor,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98if they only give us work\r\nto do.... Yes, we desire as a blessing what was given us as a curse, and\r\neven that is denied. However, be cheerful, Owen, and never mind!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn justice to desponding men, it is as well to remember that the\r\nbrighter endurance of women at these epochs--invaluable, sweet, angelic,\r\nas it is--owes more of its origin to a narrower vision that shuts out\r\nmany of the leaden-eyed despairs in the van, than to a hopefulness\r\nintense enough to quell them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE EVENTS OF ONE DAY\r\n\r\n1. AUGUST THE FOURTH. TILL FOUR O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK\r\n\r\nThe early part of the next week brought an answer to Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s last\r\nnote of hope in the way of advertisement--not from a distance of\r\nhundreds of miles, London, Scotland, Ireland, the Continent--as Cytherea\r\nseemed to think it must, to be in keeping with the means adopted for\r\nobtaining it, but from a place in the neighbourhood of that in which\r\nshe was living--a country mansion not twenty miles off. The reply ran\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                      KNAPWATER HOUSE,\r\n                         August 3, 1864.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Aldclyffe is in want of a young person as lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid. The duties\r\nof the place are light. Miss Aldclyffe will be in Budmouth on Thursday,\r\nwhen (should G. still not have heard of a place) she would like to see\r\nher at the Belvedere Hotel, Esplanade, at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock. No answer need\r\nbe returned to this note.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nA little earlier than the time named, Cytherea, clothed in a modest\r\nbonnet, and a black silk jacket, turned down to the hotel. Expectation,\r\nthe fresh air from the water, the bright, far-extending outlook, raised\r\nthe most delicate of pink colours to her cheeks, and restored to her\r\ntread a portion of that elasticity which her past troubles, and thoughts\r\nof Edward, had well-nigh taken away.\r\n\r\nShe entered the vestibule, and went to the window of the bar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Miss Aldclyffe here?\xe2\x80\x99 she said to a nicely-dressed barmaid in the\r\nforeground, who was talking to a landlady covered with chains, knobs,\r\nand clamps of gold, in the background.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, she isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said the barmaid, not very civilly. Cytherea looked a\r\nshade too pretty for a plain dresser.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Aldclyffe is expected here,\xe2\x80\x99 the landlady said to a third person,\r\nout of sight, in the tone of one who had known for several days the fact\r\nnewly discovered from Cytherea. \xe2\x80\x98Get ready her room--be quick.\xe2\x80\x99 From the\r\nalacrity with which the order was given and taken, it seemed to Cytherea\r\nthat Miss Aldclyffe must be a woman of considerable importance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are to have an interview with Miss Aldclyffe here?\xe2\x80\x99 the landlady\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The young person had better wait,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the landlady. With a\r\nmoney-taker\xe2\x80\x99s intuition she had rightly divined that Cytherea would\r\nbring no profit to the house.\r\n\r\nCytherea was shown into a nondescript chamber, on the shady side of the\r\nbuilding, which appeared to be either bedroom or dayroom, as occasion\r\nnecessitated, and was one of a suite at the end of the first-floor\r\ncorridor. The prevailing colour of the walls, curtains, carpet, and\r\ncoverings of furniture, was more or less blue, to which the cold light\r\ncoming from the north easterly sky, and falling on a wide roof of new\r\nslates--the only object the small window commanded--imparted a more\r\nstriking paleness. But underneath the door, communicating with the next\r\nroom of the suite, gleamed an infinitesimally small, yet very powerful,\r\nfraction of contrast--a very thin line of ruddy light, showing that the\r\nsun beamed strongly into this room adjoining. The line of radiance was\r\nthe only cheering thing visible in the place.\r\n\r\nPeople give way to very infantine thoughts and actions when they wait;\r\nthe battle-field of life is temporarily fenced off by a hard and fast\r\nline--the interview. Cytherea fixed her eyes idly upon the streak, and\r\nbegan picturing a wonderful paradise on the other side as the source\r\nof such a beam--reminding her of the well-known good deed in a naughty\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWhilst she watched the particles of dust floating before the brilliant\r\nchink she heard a carriage and horses stop opposite the front of the\r\nhouse. Afterwards came the rustle of a lady\xe2\x80\x99s skirts down the corridor,\r\nand into the room communicating with the one Cytherea occupied.\r\n\r\nThe golden line vanished in parts like the phosphorescent streak caused\r\nby the striking of a match; there was the fall of a light footstep\r\non the floor just behind it: then a pause. Then the foot tapped\r\nimpatiently, and \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s no one here!\xe2\x80\x99 was spoken imperiously by a\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, madam; in the next room. I am going to fetch her,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nattendant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That will do--or you needn\xe2\x80\x99t go in; I will call her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea had risen, and she advanced to the middle door with the chink\r\nunder it as the servant retired. She had just laid her hand on the knob,\r\nwhen it slipped round within her fingers, and the door was pulled open\r\nfrom the other side.\r\n\r\n2. FOUR O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK\r\n\r\nThe direct blaze of the afternoon sun, partly refracted through the\r\ncrimson curtains of the window, and heightened by reflections from the\r\ncrimson-flock paper which covered the walls, and a carpet on the floor\r\nof the same tint, shone with a burning glow round the form of a lady\r\nstanding close to Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s front with the door in her hand. The\r\nstranger appeared to the maiden\xe2\x80\x99s eyes--fresh from the blue gloom, and\r\nassisted by an imagination fresh from nature--like a tall black figure\r\nstanding in the midst of fire. It was the figure of a finely-built\r\nwoman, of spare though not angular proportions.\r\n\r\nCytherea involuntarily shaded her eyes with her hand, retreated a step\r\nor two, and then she could for the first time see Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nin addition to her outline, lit up by the secondary and softer light\r\nthat was reflected from the varnished panels of the door. She was not\r\na very young woman, but could boast of much beauty of the majestic\r\nautumnal phase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady, \xe2\x80\x98come this way.\xe2\x80\x99 Cytherea followed her to the\r\nembrasure of the window.\r\n\r\nBoth the women showed off themselves to advantage as they walked forward\r\nin the orange light; and each showed too in her face that she had\r\nbeen struck with her companion\xe2\x80\x99s appearance. The warm tint added to\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s face a voluptuousness which youth and a simple life had not\r\nyet allowed to express itself there ordinarily; whilst in the elder\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s face it reduced the customary expression, which might have been\r\ncalled sternness, if not harshness, to grandeur, and warmed her decaying\r\ncomplexion with much of the youthful richness it plainly had once\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nShe appeared now no more than five-and-thirty, though she might easily\r\nhave been ten or a dozen years older. She had clear steady eyes, a Roman\r\nnose in its purest form, and also the round prominent chin with which\r\nthe Caesars are represented in ancient marbles; a mouth expressing a\r\ncapability for and tendency to strong emotion, habitually controlled by\r\npride. There was a severity about the lower outlines of the face which\r\ngave a masculine cast to this portion of her countenance. Womanly\r\nweakness was nowhere visible save in one part--the curve of her forehead\r\nand brows--there it was clear and emphatic. She wore a lace shawl over a\r\nbrown silk dress, and a net bonnet set with a few blue cornflowers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You inserted the advertisement for a situation as lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid giving\r\nthe address, G., Cross Street?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, madam. Graye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. I have heard your name--Mrs. Morris, my housekeeper, mentioned\r\nyou, and pointed out your advertisement.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis was puzzling intelligence, but there was not time enough to\r\nconsider it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where did you live last?\xe2\x80\x99 continued Miss Aldclyffe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have never been a servant before. I lived at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never been out? I thought too at sight of you that you were too\r\ngirlish-looking to have done much. But why did you advertise with such\r\nassurance? It misleads people.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry: I put \xe2\x80\x9cinexperienced\xe2\x80\x9d at first, but my brother said it\r\nis absurd to trumpet your own weakness to the world, and would not let\r\nit remain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But your mother knew what was right, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no mother, madam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your father, then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, more softly, \xe2\x80\x98your sisters, aunts, or cousins.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They didn\xe2\x80\x99t think anything about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask them, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You should have done so, then. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any of them, either.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe showed her surprise. \xe2\x80\x98You deserve forgiveness then at\r\nany rate, child,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, in a sort of drily-kind tone. \xe2\x80\x98However, I\r\nam afraid you do not suit me, as I am looking for an elderly person. You\r\nsee, I want an experienced maid who knows all the usual duties of the\r\noffice.\xe2\x80\x99 She was going to add, \xe2\x80\x98Though I like your appearance,\xe2\x80\x99 but the\r\nwords seemed offensive to apply to the ladylike girl before her, and she\r\nmodified them to, \xe2\x80\x98though I like you much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry I misled you, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe stood in a reverie, without replying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good afternoon,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Cytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, Miss Graye--I hope you will succeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea turned away towards the door. The movement chanced to be one\r\nof her masterpieces. It was precise: it had as much beauty as was\r\ncompatible with precision, and as little coquettishness as was\r\ncompatible with beauty.\r\n\r\nAnd she had in turning looked over her shoulder at the other lady with a\r\nfaint accent of reproach in her face. Those who remember Greuze\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Head\r\nof a Girl,\xe2\x80\x99 have an idea of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s look askance at the turning.\r\nIt is not for a man to tell fishers of men how to set out their\r\nfascinations so as to bring about the highest possible average of takes\r\nwithin the year: but the action that tugs the hardest of all at an\r\nemotional beholder is this sweet method of turning which steals the\r\nbosom away and leaves the eyes behind.\r\n\r\nNow Miss Aldclyffe herself was no tyro at wheeling. When Cytherea had\r\nclosed the door upon her, she remained for some time in her motionless\r\nattitude, listening to the gradually dying sound of the maiden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nretreating footsteps. She murmured to herself, \xe2\x80\x98It is almost worth while\r\nto be bored with instructing her in order to have a creature who could\r\nglide round my luxurious indolent body in that manner, and look at me\r\nin that way--I warrant how light her fingers are upon one\xe2\x80\x99s head and\r\nneck.... What a silly modest young thing she is, to go away so suddenly\r\nas that!\xe2\x80\x99 She rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask the young lady who has just left me to step back again,\xe2\x80\x99 she said\r\nto the attendant. \xe2\x80\x98Quick! or she will be gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea was now in the vestibule, thinking that if she had told her\r\nhistory, Miss Aldclyffe might perhaps have taken her into the household;\r\nyet her history she particularly wished to conceal from a stranger.\r\nWhen she was recalled she turned back without feeling much surprise.\r\nSomething, she knew not what, told her she had not seen the last of Miss\r\nAldclyffe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have somebody to refer me to, of course,\xe2\x80\x99 the lady said, when\r\nCytherea had re-entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes: Mr. Thorn, a solicitor at Aldbrickham.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And are you a clever needlewoman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am considered to be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I think that at any rate I will write to Mr. Thorn,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss\r\nAldclyffe, with a little smile. \xe2\x80\x98It is true, the whole proceeding is\r\nvery irregular; but my present maid leaves next Monday, and neither of\r\nthe five I have already seen seem to do for me.... Well, I will write to\r\nMr. Thorn, and if his reply is satisfactory, you shall hear from me. It\r\nwill be as well to set yourself in readiness to come on Monday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen Cytherea had again been watched out of the room, Miss Aldclyffe\r\nasked for writing materials, that she might at once communicate with Mr.\r\nThorn. She indecisively played with the pen. \xe2\x80\x98Suppose Mr. Thorn\xe2\x80\x99s reply\r\nto be in any way disheartening--and even if so from his own imperfect\r\nacquaintance with the young creature more than from circumstantial\r\nknowledge--I shall feel obliged to give her up. Then I shall regret that\r\nI did not give her one trial in spite of other people\xe2\x80\x99s prejudices. All\r\nher account of herself is reliable enough--yes, I can see that by her\r\nface. I like that face of hers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe put down the pen and left the hotel without writing to\r\nMr. Thorn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE EVENTS OF ONE DAY\r\n\r\n1. AUGUST THE EIGHTH. MORNING AND AFTERNOON\r\n\r\nAt post-time on that following Monday morning, Cytherea watched so\r\nanxiously for the postman, that as the time which must bring him\r\nnarrowed less and less her vivid expectation had only a degree less\r\ntangibility than his presence itself. In another second his form came\r\ninto view. He brought two letters for Cytherea.\r\n\r\nOne from Miss Aldclyffe, simply stating that she wished Cytherea to come\r\non trial: that she would require her to be at Knapwater House by Monday\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nThe other was from Edward Springrove. He told her that she was the\r\nbright spot of his life: that her existence was far dearer to him than\r\nhis own: that he had never known what it was to love till he had met\r\nher. True, he had felt passing attachments to other faces from time to\r\ntime; but they all had been weak inclinations towards those faces\r\nas they then appeared. He loved her past and future, as well as her\r\npresent. He pictured her as a child: he loved her. He pictured her of\r\nsage years: he loved her. He pictured her in trouble; he loved her.\r\nHomely friendship entered into his love for her, without which all love\r\nwas evanescent.\r\n\r\nHe would make one depressing statement. Uncontrollable circumstances (a\r\nlong history, with which it was impossible to acquaint her at present)\r\noperated to a certain extent as a drag upon his wishes. He had felt this\r\nmore strongly at the time of their parting than he did now--and it was\r\nthe cause of his abrupt behaviour, for which he begged her to forgive\r\nhim. He saw now an honourable way of freeing himself, and the perception\r\nhad prompted him to write. In the meantime might he indulge in the\r\nhope of possessing her on some bright future day, when by hard labour\r\ngenerated from her own encouraging words, he had placed himself in a\r\nposition she would think worthy to be shared with him?\r\n\r\nDear little letter; she huddled it up. So much more important a\r\nlove-letter seems to a girl than to a man. Springrove was unconsciously\r\nclever in his letters, and a man with a talent of that kind may write\r\nhimself up to a hero in the mind of a young woman who loves him without\r\nknowing much about him. Springrove already stood a cubit higher in her\r\nimagination than he did in his shoes.\r\n\r\nDuring the day she flitted about the room in an ecstasy of pleasure,\r\npacking the things and thinking of an answer which should be worthy\r\nof the tender tone of the question, her love bubbling from her\r\ninvoluntarily, like prophesyings from a prophet.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Owen went with her to the railway-station, and put her\r\nin the train for Carriford Road, the station nearest to Knapwater House.\r\n\r\nHalf-an-hour later she stepped out upon the platform, and found nobody\r\nthere to receive her--though a pony-carriage was waiting outside. In two\r\nminutes she saw a melancholy man in cheerful livery running towards her\r\nfrom a public-house close adjoining, who proved to be the servant sent\r\nto fetch her. There are two ways of getting rid of sorrows: one by\r\nliving them down, the other by drowning them. The coachman drowned his.\r\n\r\nHe informed her that her luggage would be fetched by a spring-waggon in\r\nabout half-an-hour; then helped her into the chaise and drove off.\r\n\r\nHer lover\xe2\x80\x99s letter, lying close against her neck, fortified her against\r\nthe restless timidity she had previously felt concerning this new\r\nundertaking, and completely furnished her with the confident ease of\r\nmind which is required for the critical observation of surrounding\r\nobjects. It was just that stage in the slow decline of the summer days,\r\nwhen the deep, dark, and vacuous hot-weather shadows are beginning to be\r\nreplaced by blue ones that have a surface and substance to the eye. They\r\ntrotted along the turnpike road for a distance of about a mile, which\r\nbrought them just outside the village of Carriford, and then turned\r\nthrough large lodge-gates, on the heavy stone piers of which stood a\r\npair of bitterns cast in bronze. They then entered the park and wound\r\nalong a drive shaded by old and drooping lime-trees, not arranged in the\r\nform of an avenue, but standing irregularly, sometimes leaving the track\r\ncompletely exposed to the sky, at other times casting a shade over it,\r\nwhich almost approached gloom--the under surface of the lowest boughs\r\nhanging at a uniform level of six feet above the grass--the extreme\r\nheight to which the nibbling mouths of the cattle could reach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that the house?\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea expectantly, catching sight of a grey\r\ngable between the trees, and losing it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; that\xe2\x80\x99s the old manor-house--or rather all that\xe2\x80\x99s left of it. The\r\nAldycliffes used to let it sometimes, but it was oftener empty. \xe2\x80\x98Tis\r\nnow divided into three cottages. Respectable people didn\xe2\x80\x99t care to live\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, \xe2\x80\x98tis so awkward and unhandy. You see so much of it has been\r\npulled down, and the rooms that are left won\xe2\x80\x99t do very well for a small\r\nresidence. \xe2\x80\x98Tis so dismal, too, and like most old houses stands too low\r\ndown in the hollow to be healthy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do they tell any horrid stories about it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, not a single one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s a pity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I say. \xe2\x80\x98Tis jest the house for a nice ghastly\r\nhair-on-end story, that would make the parish religious. Perhaps it will\r\nhave one some day to make it complete; but there\xe2\x80\x99s not a word of\r\nthe kind now. There, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t live there for all that. In fact, I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. O no, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The sounds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One is the waterfall, which stands so close by that you can hear that\r\nthere waterfall in every room of the house, night or day, ill or well.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tis enough to drive anybody mad: now hark.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe stopped the horse. Above the slight common sounds in the air came the\r\nunvarying steady rush of falling water from some spot unseen on account\r\nof the thick foliage of the grove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s something awful in the timing o\xe2\x80\x99 that sound, ain\xe2\x80\x99t there,\r\nmiss?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When you say there is, there really seems to be. You said there were\r\ntwo--what is the other horrid sound?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The pumping-engine. That\xe2\x80\x99s close by the Old House, and sends water up\r\nthe hill and all over the Great House. We shall hear that directly....\r\nThere, now hark again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFrom the same direction down the dell they could now hear the whistling\r\ncreak of cranks, repeated at intervals of half-a-minute, with a sousing\r\nnoise between each: a creak, a souse, then another creak, and so on\r\ncontinually.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now if anybody could make shift to live through the other sounds, these\r\nwould finish him off, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so, miss? That machine goes on\r\nnight and day, summer and winter, and is hardly ever greased or visited.\r\nAh, it tries the nerves at night, especially if you are not very well;\r\nthough we don\xe2\x80\x99t often hear it at the Great House.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That sound is certainly very dismal. They might have the wheel greased.\r\nDoes Miss Aldclyffe take any interest in these things?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, scarcely; you see her father doesn\xe2\x80\x99t attend to that sort of thing\r\nas he used to. The engine was once quite his hobby. But now he\xe2\x80\x99s getten\r\nold and very seldom goes there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How many are there in family?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only her father and herself. He\xe2\x80\x99s a\xe2\x80\x99 old man of seventy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had thought that Miss Aldclyffe was sole mistress of the property,\r\nand lived here alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, m--\xe2\x80\x99 The coachman was continually checking himself thus, being\r\nabout to style her miss involuntarily, and then recollecting that he was\r\nonly speaking to the new lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She will soon be mistress, however, I am afraid,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, as if\r\nspeaking by a spirit of prophecy denied to ordinary humanity. \xe2\x80\x98The poor\r\nold gentleman has decayed very fast lately.\xe2\x80\x99 The man then drew a long\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why did you breathe sadly like that?\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!... When he\xe2\x80\x99s dead peace will be all over with us old servants. I\r\nexpect to see the old house turned inside out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She will marry, do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marry--not she! I wish she would. No, in her soul she\xe2\x80\x99s as solitary\r\nas Robinson Crusoe, though she has acquaintances in plenty, if\r\nnot relations. There\xe2\x80\x99s the rector, Mr. Raunham--he\xe2\x80\x99s a relation by\r\nmarriage--yet she\xe2\x80\x99s quite distant towards him. And people say that if\r\nshe keeps single there will be hardly a life between Mr. Raunham and the\r\nheirship of the estate. Dang it, she don\xe2\x80\x99t care. She\xe2\x80\x99s an extraordinary\r\npicture of womankind--very extraordinary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In what way besides?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll know soon enough, miss. She has had seven lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maids this last\r\ntwelvemonth. I assure you \xe2\x80\x98tis one body\xe2\x80\x99s work to fetch \xe2\x80\x98em from the\r\nstation and take \xe2\x80\x98em back again. The Lord must be a neglectful party at\r\nheart, or he\xe2\x80\x99d never permit such overbearen goings on!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does she dismiss them directly they come!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all--she never dismisses them--they go theirselves. Ye see \xe2\x80\x98tis\r\nlike this. She\xe2\x80\x99s got a very quick temper; she flees in a passion with\r\nthem for nothing at all; next mornen they come up and say they are\r\ngoing; she\xe2\x80\x99s sorry for it and wishes they\xe2\x80\x99d stay, but she\xe2\x80\x99s as proud as\r\na lucifer, and her pride won\xe2\x80\x99t let her say, \xe2\x80\x9cStay,\xe2\x80\x9d and away they go.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tis like this in fact. If you say to her about anybody, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, poor\r\nthing!\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cPooh! indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d If you say, \xe2\x80\x9cPooh, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAh, poor\r\nthing!\xe2\x80\x9d she says directly. She hangs the chief baker, as mid be, and\r\nrestores the chief butler, as mid be, though the devil but Pharaoh\r\nherself can see the difference between \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea was silent. She feared she might be again a burden to her\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However, you stand a very good chance,\xe2\x80\x99 the man went on, \xe2\x80\x98for I\r\nthink she likes you more than common. I have never known her send the\r\npony-carriage to meet one before; \xe2\x80\x98tis always the trap, but this time\r\nshe said, in a very particular ladylike tone, \xe2\x80\x9cRoobert, gaow with the\r\npony-kerriage.\xe2\x80\x9d... There, \xe2\x80\x98tis true, pony and carriage too are getten\r\nrather shabby now,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, looking round upon the vehicle as if to\r\nkeep Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s pride within reasonable limits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis to be hoped you\xe2\x80\x99ll please in dressen her to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why to-night?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a dinner-party of seventeen; \xe2\x80\x98tis her father\xe2\x80\x99s birthday, and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s very particular about her looks at such times. Now see; this is\r\nthe house. Livelier up here, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, miss?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey were now on rising ground, and had just emerged from a clump of\r\ntrees. Still a little higher than where they stood was situated the\r\nmansion, called Knapwater House, the offices gradually losing themselves\r\namong the trees behind.\r\n\r\n2. EVENING\r\n\r\nThe house was regularly and substantially built of clean grey freestone\r\nthroughout, in that plainer fashion of Greek classicism which prevailed\r\nat the latter end of the last century, when the copyists called\r\ndesigners had grown weary of fantastic variations in the Roman orders.\r\nThe main block approximated to a square on the ground plan, having a\r\nprojection in the centre of each side, surmounted by a pediment. From\r\neach angle of the inferior side ran a line of buildings lower than the\r\nrest, turning inwards again at their further end, and forming\r\nwithin them a spacious open court, within which resounded an echo of\r\nastonishing clearness. These erections were in their turn backed by\r\nivy-covered ice-houses, laundries, and stables, the whole mass of\r\nsubsidiary buildings being half buried beneath close-set shrubs and\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThere was opening sufficient through the foliage on the right hand to\r\nenable her on nearer approach to form an idea of the arrangement of the\r\nremoter or lawn front also. The natural features and contour of this\r\nquarter of the site had evidently dictated the position of the\r\nhouse primarily, and were of the ordinary, and upon the whole, most\r\nsatisfactory kind, namely, a broad, graceful slope running from the\r\nterrace beneath the walls to the margin of a placid lake lying below,\r\nupon the surface of which a dozen swans and a green punt floated at\r\nleisure. An irregular wooded island stood in the midst of the lake;\r\nbeyond this and the further margin of the water were plantations and\r\ngreensward of varied outlines, the trees heightening, by half veiling,\r\nthe softness of the exquisite landscape stretching behind.\r\n\r\nThe glimpses she had obtained of this portion were now checked by the\r\nangle of the building. In a minute or two they reached the side door, at\r\nwhich Cytherea alighted. She was welcomed by an elderly woman of lengthy\r\nsmiles and general pleasantness, who announced herself to be Mrs.\r\nMorris, the housekeeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Graye, I believe?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not--O yes, yes, we are all mistresses,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, smiling,\r\nbut forcedly. The title accorded her seemed disagreeably like the first\r\nslight scar of a brand, and she thought of Owen\xe2\x80\x99s prophecy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Morris led her into a comfortable parlour called The Room. Here\r\ntea was made ready, and Cytherea sat down, looking, whenever occasion\r\nallowed, at Mrs. Morris with great interest and curiosity, to discover,\r\nif possible, something in her which should give a clue to the secret\r\nof her knowledge of herself, and the recommendation based upon it.\r\nBut nothing was to be learnt, at any rate just then. Mrs. Morris was\r\nperpetually getting up, feeling in her pockets, going to cupboards,\r\nleaving the room two or three minutes, and trotting back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, Mrs. Graye,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98but \xe2\x80\x98tis the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbirthday, and they always have a lot of people to dinner on that\r\nday, though he\xe2\x80\x99s getting up in years now. However, none of them are\r\nsleepers--she generally keeps the house pretty clear of lodgers (being a\r\nlady with no intimate friends, though many acquaintances), which, though\r\nit gives us less to do, makes it all the duller for the younger maids in\r\nthe house.\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Morris then proceeded to give in fragmentary speeches\r\nan outline of the constitution and government of the estate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, are you sure you have quite done tea? Not a bit or drop more? Why,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve eaten nothing, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.... Well, now, it is rather inconvenient\r\nthat the other maid is not here to show you the ways of the house a\r\nlittle, but she left last Saturday, and Miss Aldclyffe has been making\r\nshift with poor old clumsy me for a maid all yesterday and this morning.\r\nShe is not come in yet. I expect she will ask for you, Mrs. Graye, the\r\nfirst thing.... I was going to say that if you have really done tea,\r\nI will take you upstairs, and show you through the wardrobes--Miss\r\nAldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s things are not laid out for to-night yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe preceded Cytherea upstairs, pointed out her own room, and then took\r\nher into Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-room, on the first-floor; where,\r\nafter explaining the whereabouts of various articles of apparel, the\r\nhousekeeper left her, telling her that she had an hour yet upon her\r\nhands before dressing-time. Cytherea laid out upon the bed in the next\r\nroom all that she had been told would be required that evening, and then\r\nwent again to the little room which had been appropriated to herself.\r\n\r\nHere she sat down by the open window, leant out upon the sill like\r\nanother Blessed Damozel, and listlessly looked down upon the brilliant\r\npattern of colours formed by the flower-beds on the lawn--now richly\r\ncrowded with late summer blossom. But the vivacity of spirit which had\r\nhitherto enlivened her, was fast ebbing under the pressure of prosaic\r\nrealities, and the warm scarlet of the geraniums, glowing most\r\nconspicuously, and mingling with the vivid cold red and green of the\r\nverbenas, the rich depth of the dahlia, and the ripe mellowness of the\r\ncalceolaria, backed by the pale hue of a flock of meek sheep feeding in\r\nthe open park, close to the other side of the fence, were, to a great\r\nextent, lost upon her eyes. She was thinking that nothing seemed worth\r\nwhile; that it was possible she might die in a workhouse; and what did\r\nit matter? The petty, vulgar details of servitude that she had just\r\npassed through, her dependence upon the whims of a strange woman, the\r\nnecessity of quenching all individuality of character in herself, and\r\nrelinquishing her own peculiar tastes to help on the wheel of this alien\r\nestablishment, made her sick and sad, and she almost longed to pursue\r\nsome free, out-of-doors employment, sleep under trees or a hut, and know\r\nno enemy but winter and cold weather, like shepherds and cowkeepers, and\r\nbirds and animals--ay, like the sheep she saw there under her window.\r\nShe looked sympathizingly at them for several minutes, imagining their\r\nenjoyment of the rich grass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--like those sheep,\xe2\x80\x99 she said aloud; and her face reddened with\r\nsurprise at a discovery she made that very instant.\r\n\r\nThe flock consisted of some ninety or a hundred young stock ewes: the\r\nsurface of their fleece was as rounded and even as a cushion, and white\r\nas milk. Now she had just observed that on the left buttock of every one\r\nof them were marked in distinct red letters the initials \xe2\x80\x98E. S.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98E. S.\xe2\x80\x99 could bring to Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s mind only one thought; but that\r\nimmediately and for ever--the name of her lover, Edward Springrove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, if it should be--!\xe2\x80\x99 She interrupted her words by a resolve. Miss\r\nAldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s carriage at the same moment made its appearance in the\r\ndrive; but Miss Aldclyffe was not her object now. It was to ascertain to\r\nwhom the sheep belonged, and to set her surmise at rest one way or the\r\nother. She flew downstairs to Mrs. Morris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whose sheep are those in the park, Mrs. Morris?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Farmer Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What Farmer Springrove is that?\xe2\x80\x99 she said quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, surely you know? Your friend, Farmer Springrove, the cider-maker,\r\nand who keeps the Three Tranters Inn; who recommended you to me when he\r\ncame in to see me the other day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s mother-wit suddenly warned her in the midst of her excitement\r\nthat it was necessary not to betray the secret of her love. \xe2\x80\x98O yes,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x98of course.\xe2\x80\x99 Her thoughts had run as follows in that short\r\ninterval:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Farmer Springrove is Edward\xe2\x80\x99s father, and his name is Edward too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Edward knew I was going to advertise for a situation of some kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He watched the Times, and saw it, my address being attached.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He thought it would be excellent for me to be here that we might meet\r\nwhenever he came home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He told his father that I might be recommended as a lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid; and he\r\nknew my brother and myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His father told Mrs. Morris; Mrs. Morris told Miss Aldclyffe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe whole chain of incidents that drew her there was plain, and there\r\nwas no such thing as chance in the matter. It was all Edward\xe2\x80\x99s doing.\r\n\r\nThe sound of a bell was heard. Cytherea did not heed it, and still\r\ncontinued in her reverie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s bell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Morris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said the young woman placidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, it means that you must go up to her,\xe2\x80\x99 the matron continued, in a\r\ntone of surprise.\r\n\r\nCytherea felt a burning heat come over her, mingled with a sudden\r\nirritation at Mrs. Morris\xe2\x80\x99s hint. But the good sense which had\r\nrecognized stern necessity prevailed over rebellious independence; the\r\nflush passed, and she said hastily--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes; of course, I must go to her when she pulls the bell--whether\r\nI want to or no.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of this painful reminder of her new position in life,\r\nCytherea left the apartment in a mood far different from the gloomy\r\nsadness of ten minutes previous. The place felt like home to her\r\nnow; she did not mind the pettiness of her occupation, because Edward\r\nevidently did not mind it; and this was Edward\xe2\x80\x99s own spot. She found\r\ntime on her way to Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-room to hurriedly glide out\r\nby a side door, and look for a moment at the unconscious sheep bearing\r\nthe friendly initials. She went up to them to try to touch one of the\r\nflock, and felt vexed that they all stared sceptically at her kind\r\nadvances, and then ran pell-mell down the hill. Then, fearing any one\r\nshould discover her childish movements, she slipped indoors again,\r\nand ascended the staircase, catching glimpses, as she passed, of\r\nsilver-buttoned footmen, who flashed about the passages like lightning.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-room was an apartment which, on a casual\r\nsurvey, conveyed an impression that it was available for almost any\r\npurpose save the adornment of the feminine person. In its hours of\r\nperfect order nothing pertaining to the toilet was visible; even the\r\ninevitable mirrors with their accessories were arranged in a roomy\r\nrecess not noticeable from the door, lighted by a window of its own,\r\ncalled the dressing-window.\r\n\r\nThe washing-stand figured as a vast oak chest, carved with grotesque\r\nRenaissance ornament. The dressing table was in appearance something\r\nbetween a high altar and a cabinet piano, the surface being richly\r\nworked in the same style of semi-classic decoration, but the\r\nextraordinary outline having been arrived at by an ingenious joiner and\r\ndecorator from the neighbouring town, after months of painful toil in\r\ncutting and fitting, under Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s immediate eye; the materials\r\nbeing the remains of two or three old cabinets the lady had found in the\r\nlumber-room. About two-thirds of the floor was carpeted, the remaining\r\nportion being laid with parquetry of light and dark woods.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe was standing at the larger window, away from the\r\ndressing-niche. She bowed, and said pleasantly, \xe2\x80\x98I am glad you have\r\ncome. We shall get on capitally, I dare say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer bonnet was off. Cytherea did not think her so handsome as on the\r\nearlier day; the queenliness of her beauty was harder and less warm.\r\nBut a worse discovery than this was that Miss Aldclyffe, with the usual\r\nobliviousness of rich people to their dependents\xe2\x80\x99 specialities, seemed\r\nto have quite forgotten Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s inexperience, and mechanically\r\ndelivered up her body to her handmaid without a thought of details, and\r\nwith a mild yawn.\r\n\r\nEverything went well at first. The dress was removed, stockings and\r\nblack boots were taken off, and silk stockings and white shoes were\r\nput on. Miss Aldclyffe then retired to bathe her hands and face, and\r\nCytherea drew breath. If she could get through this first evening, all\r\nwould be right. She felt that it was unfortunate that such a crucial\r\ntest for her powers as a birthday dinner should have been applied on the\r\nthreshold of her arrival; but set to again.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe was now arrayed in a white dressing-gown, and dropped\r\nlanguidly into an easy-chair, pushed up before the glass. The instincts\r\nof her sex and her own practice told Cytherea the next movement. She let\r\nMiss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s hair fall about her shoulders, and began to arrange it.\r\nIt proved to be all real; a satisfaction.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe was musingly looking on the floor, and the operation went\r\non for some minutes in silence. At length her thoughts seemed to turn to\r\nthe present, and she lifted her eyes to the glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, what on earth are you doing with my head?\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed, with\r\nwidely opened eyes. At the words she felt the back of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s little\r\nhand tremble against her neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps you prefer it done the other fashion, madam?\xe2\x80\x99 said the maiden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no; that\xe2\x80\x99s the fashion right enough, but you must make more show of\r\nmy hair than that, or I shall have to buy some, which God forbid!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is how I do my own,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea naively, and with a sweetness\r\nof tone that would have pleased the most acrimonious under favourable\r\ncircumstances; but tyranny was in the ascendant with Miss Aldclyffe\r\nat this moment, and she was assured of palatable food for her vice by\r\nhaving felt the trembling of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yours, indeed! _Your_ hair! Come, go on.\xe2\x80\x99 Considering that Cytherea\r\npossessed at least five times as much of that valuable auxiliary to\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s beauty as the lady before her, there was at the same time some\r\nexcuse for Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s outburst. She remembered herself, however,\r\nand said more quietly, \xe2\x80\x98Now then, Graye--By-the-bye, what do they call\r\nyou downstairs?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Graye,\xe2\x80\x99 said the handmaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then tell them not to do any such absurd thing--not but that it is\r\nquite according to usage; but you are too young yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis dialogue tided Cytherea safely onward through the hairdressing\r\ntill the flowers and diamonds were to be placed upon the lady\xe2\x80\x99s brow.\r\nCytherea began arranging them tastefully, and to the very best of her\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That won\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe harshly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I look too young--an old dressed doll.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will that, madam?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I look a fright--a perfect fright!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This way, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Heavens! Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry me so.\xe2\x80\x99 She shut her lips like a trap.\r\n\r\nHaving once worked herself up to the belief that her head-dress was to\r\nbe a failure that evening, no cleverness of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s in arranging\r\nit could please her. She continued in a smouldering passion during the\r\nremainder of the performance, keeping her lips firmly closed, and the\r\nmuscles of her body rigid. Finally, snatching up her gloves, and taking\r\nher handkerchief and fan in her hand, she silently sailed out of the\r\nroom, without betraying the least consciousness of another woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence behind her.\r\n\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s fears that at the undressing this suppressed anger would find\r\na vent, kept her on thorns throughout the evening. She tried to read;\r\nshe could not. She tried to sew; she could not. She tried to muse; she\r\ncould not do that connectedly. \xe2\x80\x98If this is the beginning, what will\r\nthe end be!\xe2\x80\x99 she said in a whisper, and felt many misgivings as to the\r\npolicy of being overhasty in establishing an independence at the expense\r\nof congruity with a cherished past.\r\n\r\n3. MIDNIGHT\r\n\r\nThe clock struck twelve. The Aldclyffe state dinner was over. The\r\ncompany had all gone, and Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s bell rang loudly and\r\njerkingly.\r\n\r\nCytherea started to her feet at the sound, which broke in upon a fitful\r\nsleep that had overtaken her. She had been sitting drearily in her chair\r\nwaiting minute after minute for the signal, her brain in that state\r\nof intentness which takes cognizance of the passage of Time as a real\r\nmotion--motion without matter--the instants throbbing past in the\r\ncompany of a feverish pulse. She hastened to the room, to find the\r\nlady sitting before the dressing shrine, illuminated on both sides, and\r\nlooking so queenly in her attitude of absolute repose, that the younger\r\nwoman felt the awfullest sense of responsibility at her Vandalism in\r\nhaving undertaken to demolish so imposing a pile.\r\n\r\nThe lady\xe2\x80\x99s jewelled ornaments were taken off in silence--some by her own\r\nlistless hands, some by Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s. Then followed the outer stratum of\r\nclothing. The dress being removed, Cytherea took it in her hand and\r\nwent with it into the bedroom adjoining, intending to hang it in the\r\nwardrobe. But on second thoughts, in order that she might not keep Miss\r\nAldclyffe waiting a moment longer than necessary, she flung it down on\r\nthe first resting-place that came to hand, which happened to be the\r\nbed, and re-entered the dressing-room with the noiseless footfall of a\r\nkitten. She paused in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\nShe was unnoticed, and her sudden return had plainly not been expected.\r\nDuring the short time of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s absence, Miss Aldclyffe had pulled\r\noff a kind of chemisette of Brussels net, drawn high above the throat,\r\nwhich she had worn with her evening dress as a semi-opaque covering to\r\nher shoulders, and in its place had put her night-gown round her.\r\nHer right hand was lifted to her neck, as if engaged in fastening her\r\nnight-gown.\r\n\r\nBut on a second glance Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s proceeding was clearer to\r\nCytherea. She was not fastening her night-gown; it had been carelessly\r\nthrown round her, and Miss Aldclyffe was really occupied in holding up\r\nto her eyes some small object that she was keenly scrutinizing. And\r\nnow on suddenly discovering the presence of Cytherea at the back of the\r\napartment, instead of naturally continuing or concluding her inspection,\r\nshe desisted hurriedly; the tiny snap of a spring was heard, her hand\r\nwas removed, and she began adjusting her robes.\r\n\r\nModesty might have directed her hasty action of enwrapping her\r\nshoulders, but it was scarcely likely, considering Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntemperament, that she had all her life been used to a maid, Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyouth, and the elder lady\xe2\x80\x99s marked treatment of her as if she were a\r\nmere child or plaything. The matter was too slight to reason about, and\r\nyet upon the whole it seemed that Miss Aldclyffe must have a practical\r\nreason for concealing her neck.\r\n\r\nWith a timid sense of being an intruder Cytherea was about to step back\r\nand out of the room; but at the same moment Miss Aldclyffe turned, saw\r\nthe impulse, and told her companion to stay, looking into her eyes as if\r\nshe had half an intention to explain something. Cytherea felt certain\r\nit was the little mystery of her late movements. The other withdrew her\r\neyes; Cytherea went to fetch the dressing-gown, and wheeled round\r\nagain to bring it up to Miss Aldclyffe, who had now partly removed her\r\nnight-dress to put it on the proper way, and still sat with her back\r\ntowards Cytherea.\r\n\r\nHer neck was again quite open and uncovered, and though hidden from the\r\ndirect line of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s vision, she saw it reflected in the glass--the\r\nfair white surface, and the inimitable combination of curves between\r\nthroat and bosom which artists adore, being brightly lit up by the light\r\nburning on either side.\r\n\r\nAnd the lady\xe2\x80\x99s prior proceedings were now explained in the simplest\r\nmanner. In the midst of her breast, like an island in a sea of pearl,\r\nreclined an exquisite little gold locket, embellished with arabesque\r\nwork of blue, red, and white enamel. That was undoubtedly what Miss\r\nAldclyffe had been contemplating; and, moreover, not having been put\r\noff with her other ornaments, it was to be retained during the night--a\r\nslight departure from the custom of ladies which Miss Aldclyffe had at\r\nfirst not cared to exhibit to her new assistant, though now, on further\r\nthought, she seemed to have become indifferent on the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dressing-gown,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, quietly fastening her night-dress as she\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\nCytherea came forward with it. Miss Aldclyffe did not turn her head, but\r\nlooked inquiringly at her maid in the glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You saw what I wear on my neck, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 she said to Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreflected face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, madam, I did,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea to Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s reflected face.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe again looked at Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s reflection as if she were\r\non the point of explaining. Again she checked her resolve, and said\r\nlightly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Few of my maids discover that I wear it always. I generally keep it\r\na secret--not that it matters much. But I was careless with you, and\r\nseemed to want to tell you. You win me to make confidences that....\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe ceased, took Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s hand in her own, lifted the locket with the\r\nother, touched the spring and disclosed a miniature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a handsome face, is it not?\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered mournfully, and even\r\ntimidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the sight had gone through Cytherea like an electric shock, and\r\nthere was an instantaneous awakening of perception in her, so thrilling\r\nin its presence as to be well-nigh insupportable. The face in the\r\nminiature was the face of her own father--younger and fresher than she\r\nhad ever known him--but her father!\r\n\r\nWas this the woman of his wild and unquenchable early love? And was this\r\nthe woman who had figured in the gate-man\xe2\x80\x99s story as answering the name\r\nof Cytherea before her judgment was awake? Surely it was. And if so,\r\nhere was the tangible outcrop of a romantic and hidden stratum of the\r\npast hitherto seen only in her imagination; but as far as her scope\r\nallowed, clearly defined therein by reason of its strangeness.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and thoughts were so intent upon the miniature\r\nthat she had not been conscious of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s start of surprise. She\r\nwent on speaking in a low and abstracted tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I lost him.\xe2\x80\x99 She interrupted her words by a short meditation, and\r\nwent on again. \xe2\x80\x98I lost him by excess of honesty as regarded my past. But\r\nit was best that it should be so.... I was led to think rather more\r\nthan usual of the circumstances to-night because of your name. It is\r\npronounced the same way, though differently spelt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe only means by which Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s surname could have been spelt to\r\nMiss Aldclyffe must have been by Mrs. Morris or Farmer Springrove. She\r\nfancied Farmer Springrove would have spelt it properly if Edward was his\r\ninformant, which made Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s remark obscure.\r\n\r\nWomen make confidences and then regret them. The impulsive rush of\r\nfeeling which had led Miss Aldclyffe to indulge in this revelation,\r\ntrifling as it was, died out immediately her words were beyond recall;\r\nand the turmoil, occasioned in her by dwelling upon that chapter of her\r\nlife, found vent in another kind of emotion--the result of a trivial\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nCytherea, after letting down Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s hair, adopted some plan\r\nwith it to which the lady had not been accustomed. A rapid revulsion\r\nto irritation ensued. The maiden\xe2\x80\x99s mere touch seemed to discharge the\r\npent-up regret of the lady as if she had been a jar of electricity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How strangely you treat my hair!\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nA silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have told you what I never tell my maids as a rule; of course\r\n_nothing_ that I say in this room is to be mentioned outside it.\xe2\x80\x99 She\r\nspoke crossly no less than emphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It shall not be, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, agitated and vexed that the\r\nwoman of her romantic wonderings should be so disagreeable to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why on earth did I tell you of my past?\xe2\x80\x99 she went on.\r\n\r\nCytherea made no answer.\r\n\r\nThe lady\xe2\x80\x99s vexation with herself, and the accident which had led to the\r\ndisclosure swelled little by little till it knew no bounds. But what was\r\ndone could not be undone, and though Cytherea had shown a most winning\r\nresponsiveness, quarrel Miss Aldclyffe must. She recurred to the subject\r\nof Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s want of expertness, like a bitter reviewer, who finding\r\nthe sentiments of a poet unimpeachable, quarrels with his rhymes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never, never before did I serve myself such a trick as this in engaging\r\na maid!\xe2\x80\x99 She waited for an expostulation: none came. Miss Aldclyffe\r\ntried again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The idea of my taking a girl without asking her more than three\r\nquestions, or having a single reference, all because of her good l--,\r\nthe shape of her face and body! It _was_ a fool\xe2\x80\x99s trick. There, I am\r\nserved right, quite right--by being deceived in such a way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t deceive you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea. The speech was an unfortunate\r\none, and was the very \xe2\x80\x98fuel to maintain its fires\xe2\x80\x99 that the other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npetulance desired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You did,\xe2\x80\x99 she said hotly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I told you I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t promise to be acquainted with every detail of\r\nroutine just at first.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you contradict me in this way! You are telling untruths, I say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s lip quivered. \xe2\x80\x98I would answer the remark if--if--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If what?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it were a lady\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You girl of impudence--what do you say? Leave the room this instant, I\r\ntell you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I tell you that a person who speaks to a lady as you do to me, is\r\nno lady herself!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To a lady? A lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid speaks in this way. The idea!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9clady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid\xe2\x80\x9d me: nobody is my mistress I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good Heavens!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come--no--I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t! if I had known!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That you were such an ill-tempered, unjust woman!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Possest beyond the Muse\xe2\x80\x99s painting,\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Aldclyffe exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A Woman, am I! I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you if I am a Woman!\xe2\x80\x99 and lifted her hand as\r\nif she would have liked to strike her companion. This stung the maiden\r\ninto absolute defiance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I dare you to touch me!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried. \xe2\x80\x98Strike me if you dare, madam! I am\r\nnot afraid of you--what do you mean by such an action as that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe was disconcerted at this unexpected show of spirit, and\r\nashamed of her unladylike impulse now it was put into words. She sank\r\nback in the chair. \xe2\x80\x98I was not going to strike you--go to your room--I\r\nbeg you to go to your room!\xe2\x80\x99 she repeated in a husky whisper.\r\n\r\nCytherea, red and panting, took up her candlestick and advanced to\r\nthe table to get a light. As she stood close to them the rays from the\r\ncandles struck sharply on her face. She usually bore a much stronger\r\nlikeness to her mother than to her father, but now, looking with a\r\ngrave, reckless, and angered expression of countenance at the kindling\r\nwick as she held it slanting into the other flame, her father\xe2\x80\x99s features\r\nwere distinct in her. It was the first time Miss Aldclyffe had seen her\r\nin a passionate mood, and wearing that expression which was invariably\r\nits concomitant. It was Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s turn to start now; and the\r\nremark she made was an instance of that sudden change of tone from\r\nhigh-flown invective to the pettiness of curiosity which so often makes\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s quarrels ridiculous. Even Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s dignity had not\r\nsufficient power to postpone the absorbing desire she now felt to settle\r\nthe strange suspicion that had entered her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You spell your name the common way, G, R, E, Y, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99 she said,\r\nwith assumed indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, poised on the side of her foot, and still looking\r\ninto the flame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, surely? The name was spelt that way on your boxes: I looked and\r\nsaw it myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe enigma of Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s mistake was solved. \xe2\x80\x98O, was it?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nCytherea. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, I remember Mrs. Jackson, the lodging-house keeper at\r\nBudmouth, labelled them. We spell our name G, R, A, Y, E.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What was your father\xe2\x80\x99s trade?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea thought it would be useless to attempt to conceal facts any\r\nlonger. \xe2\x80\x98His was not a trade,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98He was an architect.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The idea of your being an architect\xe2\x80\x99s daughter!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to offend you in that, I hope?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why did you say \xe2\x80\x9cthe idea\xe2\x80\x9d?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Leave that alone. Did he ever visit in Gower Street, Bloomsbury, one\r\nChristmas, many years ago?--but you would not know that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have heard him say that Mr. Huntway, a curate somewhere in that part\r\nof London, and who died there, was an old college friend of his.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is your Christian name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cytherea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No! And is it really? And you knew that face I showed you? Yes, I see\r\nyou did.\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Aldclyffe stopped, and closed her lips impassibly. She\r\nwas a little agitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you want me any longer?\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, standing candle in hand and\r\nlooking quietly in Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well--no: no longer,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other lingeringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With your permission, I will leave the house to morrow morning, madam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah.\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Aldclyffe had no notion of what she was saying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I know you will be so good as not to intrude upon me during the\r\nshort remainder of my stay?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaying this Cytherea left the room before her companion had answered.\r\nMiss Aldclyffe, then, had recognized her at last, and had been curious\r\nabout her name from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the household had retired to rest. As Cytherea went\r\nalong the passage leading to her room her skirts rustled against the\r\npartition. A door on her left opened, and Mrs. Morris looked out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I waited out of bed till you came up,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98it being your first\r\nnight, in case you should be at a loss for anything. How have you got on\r\nwith Miss Aldclyffe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pretty well--though not so well as I could have wished.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has she been scolding?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A little.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s a very odd lady--\xe2\x80\x98tis all one way or the other with her. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot bad at heart, but unbearable in close quarters. Those of us who\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t have much to do with her personally, stay on for years and years.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s family always been rich?\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no. The property, with the name, came from her mother\xe2\x80\x99s uncle. Her\r\nfamily is a branch of the old Aldclyffe family on the maternal side. Her\r\nmother married a Bradleigh--a mere nobody at that time--and was on that\r\naccount cut by her relations. But very singularly the other branch of\r\nthe family died out one by one--three of them, and Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreat-uncle then left all his property, including this estate, to\r\nCaptain Bradleigh and his wife--Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s father and mother--on\r\ncondition that they took the old family name as well. There\xe2\x80\x99s all about\r\nit in the \xe2\x80\x9cLanded Gentry.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x98Tis a thing very often done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, I see. Thank you. Well, now I am going. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE EVENTS OF TWELVE HOURS\r\n\r\n1. AUGUST THE NINTH. ONE TO TWO O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK A.M.\r\n\r\nCytherea entered her bedroom, and flung herself on the bed, bewildered\r\nby a whirl of thought. Only one subject was clear in her mind, and it\r\nwas that, in spite of family discoveries, that day was to be the first\r\nand last of her experience as a lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid. Starvation itself should\r\nnot compel her to hold such a humiliating post for another instant.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 she thought, with a sigh, at the martyrdom of her last little\r\nfragment of self-conceit, \xe2\x80\x98Owen knows everything better than I.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe jumped up and began making ready for her departure in the morning,\r\nthe tears streaming down when she grieved and wondered what practical\r\nmatter on earth she could turn her hand to next. All these preparations\r\ncompleted, she began to undress, her mind unconsciously drifting away\r\nto the contemplation of her late surprises. To look in the glass for an\r\ninstant at the reflection of her own magnificent resources in face and\r\nbosom, and to mark their attractiveness unadorned, was perhaps but the\r\nnatural action of a young woman who had so lately been chidden whilst\r\npassing through the harassing experience of decorating an older beauty\r\nof Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s temper.\r\n\r\nBut she directly checked her weakness by sympathizing reflections on the\r\nhidden troubles which must have thronged the past years of the solitary\r\nlady, to keep her, though so rich and courted, in a mood so repellent\r\nand gloomy as that in which Cytherea found her; and then the young girl\r\nmarvelled again and again, as she had marvelled before, at the strange\r\nconfluence of circumstances which had brought herself into contact with\r\nthe one woman in the world whose history was so romantically intertwined\r\nwith her own. She almost began to wish she were not obliged to go away\r\nand leave the lonely being to loneliness still.\r\n\r\nIn bed and in the dark, Miss Aldclyffe haunted her mind more\r\npersistently than ever. Instead of sleeping, she called up staring\r\nvisions of the possible past of this queenly lady, her mother\xe2\x80\x99s rival.\r\nUp the long vista of bygone years she saw, behind all, the young girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nflirtation, little or much, with the cousin, that seemed to have been\r\nnipped in the bud, or to have terminated hastily in some way. Then the\r\nsecret meetings between Miss Aldclyffe and the other woman at the little\r\ninn at Hammersmith and other places: the commonplace name she adopted:\r\nher swoon at some painful news, and the very slight knowledge the elder\r\nfemale had of her partner in mystery. Then, more than a year afterwards,\r\nthe acquaintanceship of her own father with this his first love; the\r\nawakening of the passion, his acts of devotion, the unreasoning heat of\r\nhis rapture, her tacit acceptance of it, and yet her uneasiness under\r\nthe delight. Then his declaration amid the evergreens: the utter\r\nchange produced in her manner thereby, seemingly the result of a rigid\r\ndetermination: and the total concealment of her reason by herself\r\nand her parents, whatever it was. Then the lady\xe2\x80\x99s course dropped into\r\ndarkness, and nothing more was visible till she was discovered here at\r\nKnapwater, nearly fifty years old, still unmarried and still beautiful,\r\nbut lonely, embittered, and haughty. Cytherea imagined that her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimage was still warmly cherished in Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and was\r\nthankful that she herself had not been betrayed into announcing that\r\nshe knew many particulars of this page of her father\xe2\x80\x99s history, and the\r\nchief one, the lady\xe2\x80\x99s unaccountable renunciation of him. It would have\r\nmade her bearing towards the mistress of the mansion more awkward, and\r\nwould have been no benefit to either.\r\n\r\nThus conjuring up the past, and theorizing on the present, she lay\r\nrestless, changing her posture from one side to the other and back\r\nagain. Finally, when courting sleep with all her art, she heard a clock\r\nstrike two. A minute later, and she fancied she could distinguish a soft\r\nrustle in the passage outside her room.\r\n\r\nTo bury her head in the sheets was her first impulse; then to uncover\r\nit, raise herself on her elbow, and stretch her eyes wide open in the\r\ndarkness; her lips being parted with the intentness of her listening.\r\nWhatever the noise was, it had ceased for the time.\r\n\r\nIt began again and came close to her door, lightly touching the panels.\r\nThen there was another stillness; Cytherea made a movement which caused\r\na faint rustling of the bed-clothes.\r\n\r\nBefore she had time to think another thought a light tap was given.\r\nCytherea breathed: the person outside was evidently bent upon finding\r\nher awake, and the rustle she had made had encouraged the hope. The\r\nmaiden\xe2\x80\x99s physical condition shifted from one pole to its opposite. The\r\ncold sweat of terror forsook her, and modesty took the alarm. She became\r\nhot and red; her door was not locked.\r\n\r\nA distinct woman\xe2\x80\x99s whisper came to her through the keyhole: \xe2\x80\x98Cytherea!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOnly one being in the house knew her Christian name, and that was Miss\r\nAldclyffe. Cytherea stepped out of bed, went to the door, and whispered\r\nback, \xe2\x80\x98Yes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me come in, darling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe young woman paused in a conflict between judgment and emotion. It\r\nwas now mistress and maid no longer; woman and woman only. Yes; she must\r\nlet her come in, poor thing.\r\n\r\nShe got a light in an instant, opened the door, and raising her eyes and\r\nthe candle, saw Miss Aldclyffe standing outside in her dressing-gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now you see that it is really myself; put out the light,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nvisitor. \xe2\x80\x98I want to stay here with you, Cythie. I came to ask you to\r\ncome down into my bed, but it is snugger here. But remember that you are\r\nmistress in this room, and that I have no business here, and that you\r\nmay send me away if you choose. Shall I go?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no; you shan\xe2\x80\x99t indeed if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cythie generously.\r\n\r\nThe instant they were in bed Miss Aldclyffe freed herself from the\r\nlast remnant of restraint. She flung her arms round the young girl, and\r\npressed her gently to her heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now kiss me,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\nCytherea, upon the whole, was rather discomposed at this change of\r\ntreatment; and, discomposed or no, her passions were not so impetuous as\r\nMiss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s. She could not bring her soul to her lips for a moment,\r\ntry how she would.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, kiss me,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Miss Aldclyffe.\r\n\r\nCytherea gave her a very small one, as soft in touch and in sound as the\r\nbursting of a bubble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98More earnestly than that--come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe gave another, a little but not much more expressively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve a more feeling one, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe,\r\nwith an emphasis of sad bitterness in her tone. \xe2\x80\x98I am an ill-tempered\r\nwoman, you think; half out of my mind. Well, perhaps I am; but I have\r\nhad grief more than you can think or dream of. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t help loving\r\nyou--your name is the same as mine--isn\xe2\x80\x99t it strange?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea was inclined to say no, but remained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think I must love you?\xe2\x80\x99 continued the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea absently. She was still thinking whether duty to\r\nOwen and her father, which asked for silence on her knowledge of her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate love, or duty to the woman embracing her, which\r\nseemed to ask for confidence, ought to predominate. Here was a solution.\r\nShe would wait till Miss Aldclyffe referred to her acquaintanceship and\r\nattachment to Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s father in past times: then she would tell her\r\nall she knew: that would be honour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you kiss me as I can kiss you? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you!\xe2\x80\x99 She impressed\r\nupon Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s lips a warm motherly salute, given as if in the outburst\r\nof strong feeling, long checked, and yearning for something to love and\r\nbe loved by in return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think badly of me for my behaviour this evening, child? I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow why I am so foolish as to speak to you in this way. I am a very\r\nfool, I believe. Yes. How old are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eighteen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eighteen!... Well, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you ask me how old I am?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind if you don\xe2\x80\x99t. I am forty-six; and it gives me greater\r\npleasure to tell you this than it does to you to listen. I have not told\r\nmy age truly for the last twenty years till now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have met deceit by deceit, till I am weary of it--weary, weary--and I\r\nlong to be what I shall never be again--artless and innocent, like you.\r\nBut I suppose that you, too, will, prove to be not worth a thought, as\r\nevery new friend does on more intimate knowledge. Come, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ntalk to me, child? Have you said your prayers?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--no! I forgot them to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose you say them every night as a rule?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why do you do that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I have always done so, and it would seem strange if I were not\r\nto. Do you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I? A wicked old sinner like me! No, I never do. I have thought all such\r\nmatters humbug for years--thought so so long that I should be glad to\r\nthink otherwise from very weariness; and yet, such is the code of the\r\npolite world, that I subscribe regularly to Missionary Societies and\r\nothers of the sort.... Well, say your prayers, dear--you won\xe2\x80\x99t omit them\r\nnow you recollect it. I should like to hear you very much. Will you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It seems hardly--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would seem so like old times to me--when I was young, and\r\nnearer--far nearer Heaven than I am now. Do, sweet one,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea was embarrassed, and her embarrassment arose from the following\r\nconjuncture of affairs. Since she had loved Edward Springrove, she had\r\nlinked his name with her brother Owen\xe2\x80\x99s in her nightly supplications to\r\nthe Almighty. She wished to keep her love for him a secret, and, above\r\nall, a secret from a woman like Miss Aldclyffe; yet her conscience and\r\nthe honesty of her love would not for an instant allow her to think of\r\nomitting his dear name, and so endanger the efficacy of all her previous\r\nprayers for his success by an unworthy shame now: it would be wicked\r\nof her, she thought, and a grievous wrong to him. Under any worldly\r\ncircumstances she might have thought the position justified a little\r\nfinesse, and have skipped him for once; but prayer was too solemn a\r\nthing for such trifling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would rather not say them,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured first. It struck her then\r\nthat this declining altogether was the same cowardice in another dress,\r\nand was delivering her poor Edward over to Satan just as unceremoniously\r\nas before. \xe2\x80\x98Yes; I will say my prayers, and you shall hear me,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nadded firmly.\r\n\r\nShe turned her face to the pillow and repeated in low soft tones the\r\nsimple words she had used from childhood on such occasions. Owen\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nwas mentioned without faltering, but in the other case, maidenly shyness\r\nwas too strong even for religion, and that when supported by excellent\r\nintentions. At the name of Edward she stammered, and her voice sank to\r\nthe faintest whisper in spite of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, dearest,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe. \xe2\x80\x98I have prayed too, I verily\r\nbelieve. You are a good girl, I think.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the expected question came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cBless Owen,\xe2\x80\x9d and whom, did you say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it now, and out it came. \xe2\x80\x98Owen and Edward,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nCytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who are Owen and Edward?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Owen is my brother, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 faltered the maid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, I remember. Who is Edward?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your brother, too?\xe2\x80\x99 continued Miss Aldclyffe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe reflected a moment. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to tell me who Edward\r\nis?\xe2\x80\x99 she said at last, in a tone of meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling; only....\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You would rather not, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe shifted her ground. \xe2\x80\x98Were you ever in love?\xe2\x80\x99 she inquired\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\nCytherea was surprised to hear how quickly the voice had altered from\r\ntenderness to harshness, vexation, and disappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--I think I was--once,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aha! And were you ever kissed by a man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, were you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe, rather sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t press me to tell--I can\xe2\x80\x99t--indeed, I won\xe2\x80\x99t, madam!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe removed her arms from Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s neck. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis now with\r\nyou as it is always with all girls,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, in jealous and gloomy\r\naccents. \xe2\x80\x98You are not, after all, the innocent I took you for. No, no.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nShe then changed her tone with fitful rapidity. \xe2\x80\x98Cytherea, try to love\r\nme more than you love him--do. I love you more sincerely than any man\r\ncan. Do, Cythie: don\xe2\x80\x99t let any man stand between us. O, I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x99 She clasped Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s neck again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must love him now I have begun,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Must--yes--must,\xe2\x80\x99 said the elder lady reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, women are\r\nall alike. I thought I had at last found an artless woman who had\r\nnot been sullied by a man\xe2\x80\x99s lips, and who had not practised or been\r\npractised upon by the arts which ruin all the truth and sweetness and\r\ngoodness in us. Find a girl, if you can, whose mouth and ears have\r\nnot been made a regular highway of by some man or another! Leave the\r\nadmittedly notorious spots--the drawing-rooms of society--and look in\r\nthe villages--leave the villages and search in the schools--and you can\r\nhardly find a girl whose heart has not been _had_--is not an old thing\r\nhalf worn out by some He or another! If men only knew the staleness of\r\nthe freshest of us! that nine times out of ten the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst love\xe2\x80\x9d they\r\nthink they are winning from a woman is but the hulk of an old wrecked\r\naffection, fitted with new sails and re-used. O Cytherea, can it be that\r\nyou, too, are like the rest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, no,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Cytherea, awed by the storm she had raised in the\r\nimpetuous woman\xe2\x80\x99s mind. \xe2\x80\x98He only kissed me once--twice I mean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He might have done it a thousand times if he had cared to, there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\ndoubt about that, whoever his lordship is. You are as bad as I--we are\r\nall alike; and I--an old fool--have been sipping at your mouth as if\r\nit were honey, because I fancied no wasting lover knew the spot. But\r\na minute ago, and you seemed to me like a fresh spring meadow--now you\r\nseem a dusty highway.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no, no!\xe2\x80\x99 Cytherea was not weak enough to shed tears except on\r\nextraordinary occasions, but she was fain to begin sobbing now. She\r\nwished Miss Aldclyffe would go to her own room, and leave her and her\r\ntreasured dreams alone. This vehement imperious affection was in one\r\nsense soothing, but yet it was not of the kind that Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s instincts\r\ndesired. Though it was generous, it seemed somewhat too rank and\r\ncapricious for endurance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady in continuation, \xe2\x80\x98who is he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer companion was desperately determined not to tell his name: she too\r\nmuch feared a taunt when Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s fiery mood again ruled her\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me? not tell me after all the affection I have shown?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will, perhaps, another day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you wear a hat and white feather in Budmouth for the week or two\r\nprevious to your coming here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I have seen you and your lover at a distance! He rowed you round\r\nthe bay with your brother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And without your brother--fie! There, there, don\xe2\x80\x99t let that little\r\nheart beat itself to death: throb, throb: it shakes the bed, you silly\r\nthing. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there was any harm in going alone with him. I\r\nonly saw you from the Esplanade, in common with the rest of the people.\r\nI often run down to Budmouth. He was a very good figure: now who was\r\nhe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell, madam--I cannot indeed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t tell--very well, don\xe2\x80\x99t. You are very foolish to treasure up his\r\nname and image as you do. Why, he has had loves before you, trust him\r\nfor that, whoever he is, and you are but a temporary link in a long\r\nchain of others like you: who only have your little day as they have had\r\ntheirs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t true! \xe2\x80\x98tisn\xe2\x80\x99t true! \xe2\x80\x98tisn\xe2\x80\x99t true!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Cytherea in an agony\r\nof torture. \xe2\x80\x98He has never loved anybody else, I know--I am sure he\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe was as jealous as any man could have been. She\r\ncontinued--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He sees a beautiful face and thinks he will never forget it, but in a\r\nfew weeks the feeling passes off, and he wonders how he could have cared\r\nfor anybody so absurdly much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t--What does he do when he has thought that--Come,\r\ntell me--tell me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are as hot as fire, and the throbbing of your heart makes me\r\nnervous. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you if you get in that flustered state.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do, do tell--O, it makes me so miserable! but tell--come tell me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--the tables are turned now, dear!\xe2\x80\x99 she continued, in a tone which\r\nmingled pity with derision--\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cLove\xe2\x80\x99s passions shall rock thee\r\n    As the storm rocks the ravens on high,\r\n    Bright reason will mock thee\r\n    Like the sun from a wintry sky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What does he do next?--Why, this is what he does next: ruminate on what\r\nhe has heard of women\xe2\x80\x99s romantic impulses, and how easily men torture\r\nthem when they have given way to those feelings, and have resigned\r\neverything for their hero. It may be that though he loves you heartily\r\nnow--that is, as heartily as a man can--and you love him in return, your\r\nloves may be impracticable and hopeless, and you may be separated for\r\never. You, as the weary, weary years pass by will fade and fade--bright\r\neyes _will_ fade--and you will perhaps then die early--true to him to\r\nyour latest breath, and believing him to be true to the latest breath\r\nalso; whilst he, in some gay and busy spot far away from your last quiet\r\nnook, will have married some dashing lady, and not purely oblivious of\r\nyou, will long have ceased to regret you--will chat about you, as you\r\nwere in long past years--will say, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, little Cytherea used to tie her\r\nhair like that--poor innocent trusting thing; it was a pleasant useless\r\nidle dream--that dream of mine for the maid with the bright eyes and\r\nsimple, silly heart; but I was a foolish lad at that time.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he will\r\ntell the tale of all your little Wills and Wont\xe2\x80\x99s and particular ways,\r\nand as he speaks, turn to his wife with a placid smile.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not true! He can\xe2\x80\x99t, he c-can\xe2\x80\x99t be s-so cruel--and you are cruel\r\nto me--you are, you are!\xe2\x80\x99 She was at last driven to desperation: her\r\nnatural common sense and shrewdness had seen all through the piece how\r\nimaginary her emotions were--she felt herself to be weak and foolish in\r\npermitting them to rise; but even then she could not control them: be\r\nagonized she must. She was only eighteen, and the long day\xe2\x80\x99s labour,\r\nher weariness, her excitement, had completely unnerved her, and worn her\r\nout: she was bent hither and thither by this tyrannical working upon her\r\nimagination, as a young rush in the wind. She wept bitterly. \xe2\x80\x98And now\r\nthink how much I like you,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Miss Aldclyffe, when Cytherea grew\r\ncalmer. \xe2\x80\x98I shall never forget you for anybody else, as men do--never. I\r\nwill be exactly as a mother to you. Now will you promise to live with me\r\nalways, and always be taken care of, and never deserted?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot. I will not be anybody\xe2\x80\x99s maid for another day on any\r\nconsideration.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, no. You shan\xe2\x80\x99t be a lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid. You shall be my companion. I\r\nwill get another maid.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCompanion--that was a new idea. Cytherea could not resist the evidently\r\nheartfelt desire of the strange-tempered woman for her presence. But she\r\ncould not trust to the moment\xe2\x80\x99s impulse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will stay, I think. But do not ask for a final answer to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind now, then. Put your hair round your mamma\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and give\r\nme one good long kiss, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t talk any more in that way about your\r\nlover. After all, some young men are not so fickle as others; but even\r\nif he\xe2\x80\x99s the ficklest, there is consolation. The love of an inconstant\r\nman is ten times more ardent than that of a faithful man--that is, while\r\nit lasts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea did as she was told, to escape the punishment of further talk;\r\nflung the twining tresses of her long, rich hair over Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulders as directed, and the two ceased conversing, making themselves\r\nup for sleep. Miss Aldclyffe seemed to give herself over to a luxurious\r\nsense of content and quiet, as if the maiden at her side afforded her a\r\nprotection against dangers which had menaced her for years; she was soon\r\nsleeping calmly.\r\n\r\n2. TWO TO FIVE A.M.\r\n\r\nWith Cytherea it was otherwise. Unused to the place and circumstances,\r\nshe continued wakeful, ill at ease, and mentally distressed. She\r\nwithdrew herself from her companion\xe2\x80\x99s embrace, turned to the other\r\nside, and endeavoured to relieve her busy brain by looking at the\r\nwindow-blind, and noticing the light of the rising moon--now in her last\r\nquarter--creep round upon it: it was the light of an old waning moon\r\nwhich had but a few days longer to live.\r\n\r\nThe sight led her to think again of what had happened under the rays of\r\nthe same month\xe2\x80\x99s moon, a little before its full, the ecstatic\r\nevening scene with Edward: the kiss, and the shortness of those happy\r\nmoments--maiden imagination bringing about the apotheosis of a status\r\nquo which had had several unpleasantnesses in its earthly reality.\r\n\r\nBut sounds were in the ascendant that night. Her ears became aware of a\r\nstrange and gloomy murmur.\r\n\r\nShe recognized it: it was the gushing of the waterfall, faint and low,\r\nbrought from its source to the unwonted distance of the House by a faint\r\nbreeze which made it distinct and recognizable by reason of the utter\r\nabsence of all disturbing sounds. The groom\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy representation\r\nlent to the sound a more dismal effect than it would have had of its own\r\nnature. She began to fancy what the waterfall must be like at that hour,\r\nunder the trees in the ghostly moonlight. Black at the head, and over\r\nthe surface of the deep cold hole into which it fell; white and\r\nfrothy at the fall; black and white, like a pall and its border; sad\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nShe was in the mood for sounds of every kind now, and strained her ears\r\nto catch the faintest, in wayward enmity to her quiet of mind. Another\r\nsoon came.\r\n\r\nThe second was quite different from the first--a kind of intermittent\r\nwhistle it seemed primarily: no, a creak, a metallic creak, ever and\r\nanon, like a plough, or a rusty wheelbarrow, or at least a wheel of some\r\nkind. Yes, it was, a wheel--the water-wheel in the shrubbery by the old\r\nmanor-house, which the coachman had said would drive him mad.\r\n\r\nShe determined not to think any more of these gloomy things; but now\r\nthat she had once noticed the sound there was no sealing her ears to it.\r\nShe could not help timing its creaks, and putting on a dread expectancy\r\njust before the end of each half-minute that brought them. To imagine\r\nthe inside of the engine-house, whence these noises proceeded, was now a\r\nnecessity. No window, but crevices in the door, through which, probably,\r\nthe moonbeams streamed in the most attenuated and skeleton-like rays,\r\nstriking sharply upon portions of wet rusty cranks and chains; a\r\nglistening wheel, turning incessantly, labouring in the dark like a\r\ncaptive starving in a dungeon; and instead of a floor below, gurgling\r\nwater, which on account of the darkness could only be heard; water which\r\nlaboured up dark pipes almost to where she lay.\r\n\r\nShe shivered. Now she was determined to go to sleep; there could be\r\nnothing else left to be heard or to imagine--it was horrid that her\r\nimagination should be so restless. Yet just for an instant before going\r\nto sleep she would think this--suppose another sound _should_ come--just\r\nsuppose it should! Before the thought had well passed through her brain,\r\na third sound came.\r\n\r\nThe third was a very soft gurgle or rattle--of a strange and abnormal\r\nkind--yet a sound she had heard before at some past period of her\r\nlife--when, she could not recollect. To make it the more disturbing, it\r\nseemed to be almost close to her--either close outside the window, close\r\nunder the floor, or close above the ceiling. The accidental fact of\r\nits coming so immediately upon the heels of her supposition, told so\r\npowerfully upon her excited nerves that she jumped up in the bed. The\r\nsame instant, a little dog in some room near, having probably heard the\r\nsame noise, set up a low whine. The watch-dog in the yard, hearing\r\nthe moan of his associate, began to howl loudly and distinctly. His\r\nmelancholy notes were taken up directly afterwards by the dogs in the\r\nkennel a long way off, in every variety of wail.\r\n\r\nOne logical thought alone was able to enter her flurried brain. The\r\nlittle dog that began the whining must have heard the other two sounds\r\neven better than herself. He had taken no notice of them, but he had\r\ntaken notice of the third. The third, then, was an unusual sound.\r\n\r\nIt was not like water, it was not like wind; it was not the night-jar,\r\nit was not a clock, nor a rat, nor a person snoring.\r\n\r\nShe crept under the clothes, and flung her arms tightly round Miss\r\nAldclyffe, as if for protection. Cytherea perceived that the lady\xe2\x80\x99s late\r\npeaceful warmth had given place to a sweat. At the maiden\xe2\x80\x99s touch, Miss\r\nAldclyffe awoke with a low scream.\r\n\r\nShe remembered her position instantly. \xe2\x80\x98O such a terrible dream!\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\ncried, in a hurried whisper, holding to Cytherea in her turn; \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nyour touch was the end of it. It was dreadful. Time, with his wings,\r\nhour-glass, and scythe, coming nearer and nearer to me--grinning and\r\nmocking: then he seized me, took a piece of me only... But I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nyou. I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to think of it. How those dogs howl! People say it\r\nmeans death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe return of Miss Aldclyffe to consciousness was sufficient to\r\ndispel the wild fancies which the loneliness of the night had woven in\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s mind. She dismissed the third noise as something which in all\r\nlikelihood could easily be explained, if trouble were taken to inquire\r\ninto it: large houses had all kinds of strange sounds floating about\r\nthem. She was ashamed to tell Miss Aldclyffe her terrors.\r\n\r\nA silence of five minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you asleep?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, in a long-drawn whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How those dogs howl, don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. A little dog in the house began it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, yes: that was Totsy. He sleeps on the mat outside my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedroom door. A nervous creature.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a silent interval of nearly half-an-hour. A clock on the\r\nlanding struck three.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you asleep, Miss Aldclyffe?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Cytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe. \xe2\x80\x98How wretched it is not to be able to sleep,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Cytherea, like a docile child.\r\n\r\nAnother hour passed, and the clock struck four. Miss Aldclyffe was still\r\nawake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cytherea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, very softly.\r\n\r\nCytherea made no answer. She was sleeping soundly.\r\n\r\nThe first glimmer of dawn was now visible. Miss Aldclyffe arose, put on\r\nher dressing-gown, and went softly downstairs to her own room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not told her who I am after all, or found out the particulars\r\nof Ambrose\xe2\x80\x99s history,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured. \xe2\x80\x98But her being in love alters\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n3. HALF-PAST SEVEN TO TEN O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK A.M.\r\n\r\nCytherea awoke, quiet in mind and refreshed. A conclusion to remain at\r\nKnapwater was already in possession of her.\r\n\r\nFinding Miss Aldclyffe gone, she dressed herself and sat down at the\r\nwindow to write an answer to Edward\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and an account of her\r\narrival at Knapwater to Owen. The dismal and heart-breaking pictures\r\nthat Miss Aldclyffe had placed before her the preceding evening, the\r\nlater terrors of the night, were now but as shadows of shadows, and she\r\nsmiled in derision at her own excitability.\r\n\r\nBut writing Edward\xe2\x80\x99s letter was the great consoler, the effect of each\r\nword upon him being enacted in her own face as she wrote it. She felt\r\nhow much she would like to share his trouble--how well she could endure\r\npoverty with him--and wondered what his trouble was. But all would be\r\nexplained at last, she knew.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time she went to Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s room, intending, with\r\nthe contradictoriness common in people, to perform with pleasure, as a\r\nwork of supererogation, what as a duty was simply intolerable.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe was already out of bed. The bright penetrating light\r\nof morning made a vast difference in the elder lady\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour to her\r\ndependent; the day, which had restored Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, had effected\r\nthe same for Miss Aldclyffe. Though practical reasons forbade her\r\nregretting that she had secured such a companionable creature to read,\r\ntalk, or play to her whenever her whim required, she was inwardly vexed\r\nat the extent to which she had indulged in the womanly luxury of making\r\nconfidences and giving way to emotions. Few would have supposed that the\r\ncalm lady sitting aristocratically at the toilet table, seeming scarcely\r\nconscious of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the room, even when greeting her,\r\nwas the passionate creature who had asked for kisses a few hours before.\r\n\r\nIt is both painful and satisfactory to think how often these\r\nantitheses are to be observed in the individual most open to our\r\nobservation--ourselves. We pass the evening with faces lit up by some\r\nflaring illumination or other: we get up the next morning--the fiery\r\njets have all gone out, and nothing confronts us but a few crinkled\r\npipes and sooty wirework, hardly even recalling the outline of the\r\nblazing picture that arrested our eyes before bedtime.\r\n\r\nEmotions would be half starved if there were no candle-light. Probably\r\nnine-tenths of the gushing letters of indiscreet confession are written\r\nafter nine or ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, and sent off before day\r\nreturns to leer invidiously upon them. Few that remain open to catch\r\nour glance as we rise in the morning, survive the frigid criticism of\r\ndressing-time.\r\n\r\nThe subjects uppermost in the minds of the two women who had thus cooled\r\nfrom their fires, were not the visionary ones of the later hours,\r\nbut the hard facts of their earlier conversation. After a remark that\r\nCytherea need not assist her in dressing unless she wished to, Miss\r\nAldclyffe said abruptly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can tell that young man\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x99 She looked keenly at Cytherea. \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nis Edward Springrove, my tenant\xe2\x80\x99s son.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe inundation of colour upon the younger lady at hearing a name which\r\nto her was a world, handled as if it were only an atom, told Miss\r\nAldclyffe that she had divined the truth at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--it is he, is it?\xe2\x80\x99 she continued. \xe2\x80\x98Well, I wanted to know for\r\npractical reasons. His example shows that I was not so far wrong in my\r\nestimate of men after all, though I only generalized, and had no thought\r\nof him.\xe2\x80\x99 This was perfectly true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, visibly alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mean? Why that all the world knows him to be engaged to be married, and\r\nthat the wedding is soon to take place.\xe2\x80\x99 She made the remark bluntly and\r\nsuperciliously, as if to obtain absolution at the hands of her family\r\npride for the weak confidences of the night.\r\n\r\nBut even the frigidity of Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s morning mood was overcome by\r\nthe look of sick and blank despair which the carelessly uttered words\r\nhad produced upon Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s face. She sank back into a chair, and\r\nburied her face in her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be so foolish,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe. \xe2\x80\x98Come, make the best of it.\r\nI cannot upset the fact I have told you of, unfortunately. But I believe\r\nthe match can be broken off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no, no.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense. I liked him much as a youth, and I like him now. I\xe2\x80\x99ll help\r\nyou to captivate and chain him down. I have got over my absurd feeling\r\nof last night in not wanting you ever to go away from me--of course, I\r\ncould not expect such a thing as that. There, now I have said I\xe2\x80\x99ll help\r\nyou, and that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. He\xe2\x80\x99s tired of his first choice now that he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeen away from home for a while. The love that no outer attack can\r\nfrighten away quails before its idol\xe2\x80\x99s own homely ways; it is always\r\nso.... Come, finish what you are doing if you are going to, and don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\na little goose about such a trumpery affair as that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who--is he engaged to?\xe2\x80\x99 Cytherea inquired by a movement of her lips but\r\nno sound of her voice. But Miss Aldclyffe did not answer. It mattered\r\nnot, Cytherea thought. Another woman--that was enough for her: curiosity\r\nwas stunned.\r\n\r\nShe applied herself to the work of dressing, scarcely knowing how. Miss\r\nAldclyffe went on:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were too easily won. I\xe2\x80\x99d have made him or anybody else speak out\r\nbefore he should have kissed my face for his pleasure. But you are one\r\nof those precipitantly fond things who are yearning to throw away their\r\nhearts upon the first worthless fellow who says good-morning. In the\r\nfirst place, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have loved him so quickly: in the next,\r\nif you must have loved him off-hand, you should have concealed it. It\r\ntickled his vanity: \xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, that girl\xe2\x80\x99s in love with me already!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo hasten away at the end of the toilet, to tell Mrs. Morris--who\r\nstood waiting in a little room prepared for her, with tea poured out,\r\nbread-and-butter cut into diaphanous slices, and eggs arranged--that she\r\nwanted no breakfast: then to shut herself alone in her bedroom, was her\r\nonly thought. She was followed thither by the well-intentioned\r\nmatron with a cup of tea and one piece of bread-and-butter on a tray,\r\ncheerfully insisting that she should eat it.\r\n\r\nTo those who grieve, innocent cheerfulness seems heartless levity. \xe2\x80\x98No,\r\nthank you, Mrs. Morris,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, keeping the door closed. Despite\r\nthe incivility of the action, Cytherea could not bear to let a pleasant\r\nperson see her face then.\r\n\r\nImmediate revocation--even if revocation would be more effective by\r\npostponement--is the impulse of young wounded natures. Cytherea went\r\nto her blotting-book, took out the long letter so carefully written, so\r\nfull of gushing remarks and tender hints, and sealed up so neatly with\r\na little seal bearing \xe2\x80\x98Good Faith\xe2\x80\x99 as its motto, tore the missive into\r\nfifty pieces, and threw them into the grate. It was then the bitterest\r\nof anguishes to look upon some of the words she had so lovingly written,\r\nand see them existing only in mutilated forms without meaning--to feel\r\nthat his eye would never read them, nobody ever know how ardently she\r\nhad penned them.\r\n\r\nPity for one\xe2\x80\x99s self for being wasted is mostly present in these moods of\r\nabnegation.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of all his allusions, his abruptness in telling her of his\r\nlove, his constraint at first, then his desperate manner of speaking,\r\nwas clear. They must have been the last flickerings of a conscience not\r\nquite dead to all sense of perfidiousness and fickleness. Now he had\r\ngone to London: she would be dismissed from his memory, in the same way\r\nas Miss Aldclyffe had said. And here she was in Edward\xe2\x80\x99s own parish,\r\nreminded continually of him by what she saw and heard. The landscape,\r\nyesterday so much and so bright to her, was now but as the banquet-hall\r\ndeserted--all gone but herself.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe had wormed her secret out of her, and would now be\r\ncontinually mocking her for her trusting simplicity in believing him. It\r\nwas altogether unbearable: she would not stay there.\r\n\r\nShe went downstairs and found Miss Aldclyffe had gone into the\r\nbreakfast-room, but that Captain Aldclyffe, who rose later with\r\nincreasing infirmities, had not yet made his appearance. Cytherea\r\nentered. Miss Aldclyffe was looking out of the window, watching a trail\r\nof white smoke along the distant landscape--signifying a passing train.\r\nAt Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s entry she turned and looked inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must tell you now,\xe2\x80\x99 began Cytherea, in a tremulous voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, what?\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Aldclyffe said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not going to stay with you. I must go away--a very long way. I am\r\nvery sorry, but indeed I can\xe2\x80\x99t remain!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pooh--what shall we hear next?\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Aldclyffe surveyed Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nwith leisurely criticism. \xe2\x80\x98You are breaking your heart again about that\r\nworthless young Springrove. I knew how it would be. It is as Hallam says\r\nof Juliet--what little reason you may have possessed originally has all\r\nbeen whirled away by this love. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t take this notice, mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do let me go!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe took her new pet\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and said with severity, \xe2\x80\x98As to\r\nhindering you, if you are determined to go, of course that\xe2\x80\x99s absurd.\r\nBut you are not now in a state of mind fit for deciding upon any such\r\nproceeding, and I shall not listen to what you have to say. Now, Cythie,\r\ncome with me; we\xe2\x80\x99ll let this volcano burst and spend itself, and after\r\nthat we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what had better be done.\xe2\x80\x99 She took Cytherea into her\r\nworkroom, opened a drawer, and drew forth a roll of linen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is some embroidery I began one day, and now I should like it\r\nfinished.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe then preceded the maiden upstairs to Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s own room. \xe2\x80\x98There,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x98now sit down here, go on with this work, and remember one\r\nthing--that you are not to leave the room on any pretext whatever for\r\ntwo hours unless I send for you--I insist kindly, dear. Whilst you\r\nstitch--you are to stitch, recollect, and not go mooning out of the\r\nwindow--think over the whole matter, and get cooled; don\xe2\x80\x99t let the\r\nfoolish love-affair prevent your thinking as a woman of the world. If\r\nat the end of that time you still say you must leave me, you may. I will\r\nhave no more to say in the matter. Come, sit down, and promise to sit\r\nhere the time I name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo hearts in a despairing mood, compulsion seems a relief; and docility\r\nwas at all times natural to Cytherea. She promised, and sat down. Miss\r\nAldclyffe shut the door upon her and retreated.\r\n\r\nShe sewed, stopped to think, shed a tear or two, recollected the\r\narticles of the treaty, and sewed again; and at length fell into a\r\nreverie which took no account whatever of the lapse of time.\r\n\r\n4. TEN TO TWELVE O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK A.M.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour might have passed when her thoughts became\r\nattracted from the past to the present by unwonted movements downstairs.\r\nShe opened the door and listened.\r\n\r\nThere were hurryings along passages, opening and shutting of doors,\r\ntrampling in the stable-yard. She went across into another bedroom, from\r\nwhich a view of the stable-yard could be obtained, and arrived there\r\njust in time to see the figure of the man who had driven her from the\r\nstation vanishing down the coach-road on a black horse--galloping at the\r\ntop of the animal\xe2\x80\x99s speed.\r\n\r\nAnother man went off in the direction of the village.\r\n\r\nWhatever had occurred, it did not seem to be her duty to inquire or\r\nmeddle with it, stranger and dependent as she was, unless she were\r\nrequested to, especially after Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s strict charge to her.\r\nShe sat down again, determined to let no idle curiosity influence her\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nHer window commanded the front of the house; and the next thing she saw\r\nwas a clergyman walk up and enter the door.\r\n\r\nAll was silent again till, a long time after the first man had left,\r\nhe returned again on the same horse, now matted with sweat and trotting\r\nbehind a carriage in which sat an elderly gentleman driven by a lad in\r\nlivery. These came to the house, entered, and all was again the same as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe whole household--master, mistress, and servants--appeared to have\r\nforgotten the very existence of such a being as Cytherea. She almost\r\nwished she had not vowed to have no idle curiosity.\r\n\r\nHalf-an-hour later, the carriage drove off with the elderly gentleman,\r\nand two or three messengers left the house, speeding in various\r\ndirections. Rustics in smock-frocks began to hang about the road\r\nopposite the house, or lean against trees, looking idly at the windows\r\nand chimneys.\r\n\r\nA tap came to Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s door. She opened it to a young maid-servant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Aldclyffe wishes to see you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99 Cytherea hastened down.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe was standing on the hearthrug, her elbow on the mantel,\r\nher hand to her temples, her eyes on the ground; perfectly calm, but\r\nvery pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cytherea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x98come here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea went close.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Something very serious has taken place,\xe2\x80\x99 she said again, and then\r\npaused, with a tremulous movement of her mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My father. He was found dead in his bed this morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dead!\xe2\x80\x99 echoed the younger woman. It seemed impossible that the\r\nannouncement could be true; that knowledge of so great a fact could be\r\ncontained in a statement so small.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, dead,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Miss Aldclyffe solemnly. \xe2\x80\x98He died alone, though\r\nwithin a few feet of me. The room we slept in is exactly over his own.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea said hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x98Do they know at what hour?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The doctor says it must have been between two and three o\xe2\x80\x99clock this\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I heard him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Heard him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Heard him die!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You heard him die? What did you hear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A sound I heard once before in my life--at the deathbed of my mother. I\r\ncould not identify it--though I recognized it. Then the dog howled: you\r\nremarked it. I did not think it worth while to tell you what I had heard\r\na little earlier.\xe2\x80\x99 She looked agonized.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would have been useless,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe. \xe2\x80\x98All was over by that\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x99 She addressed herself as much as Cytherea when she continued, \xe2\x80\x98Is\r\nit a Providence who sent you here at this juncture that I might not be\r\nleft entirely alone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTill this instant Miss Aldclyffe had forgotten the reason of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nseclusion in her own room. So had Cytherea herself. The fact now\r\nrecurred to both in one moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you still wish to go?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go now,\xe2\x80\x99 Cytherea had remarked simultaneously with the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s question. She was pondering on the strange likeness which Miss\r\nAldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s bereavement bore to her own; it had the appearance of being\r\nstill another call to her not to forsake this woman so linked to her\r\nlife, for the sake of any trivial vexation.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe held her almost as a lover would have held her, and said\r\nmusingly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We get more and more into one groove. I now am left fatherless and\r\nmotherless as you were.\xe2\x80\x99 Other ties lay behind in her thoughts, but she\r\ndid not mention them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You loved your father, Cytherea, and wept for him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I did. Poor papa!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was always at variance with mine, and can\xe2\x80\x99t weep for him now! But you\r\nmust stay here always, and make a better woman of me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe compact was thus sealed, and Cytherea, in spite of the failure of\r\nher advertisements, was installed as a veritable Companion. And,\r\nonce more in the history of human endeavour, a position which it was\r\nimpossible to reach by any direct attempt, was come to by the seeker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nswerving from the path, and regarding the original object as one of\r\nsecondary importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE EVENTS OF EIGHTEEN DAYS\r\n\r\n1. AUGUST THE SEVENTEENTH\r\n\r\nThe time of day was four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon. The place was the\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s study or boudoir, Knapwater House. The person was Miss Aldclyffe\r\nsitting there alone, clothed in deep mourning.\r\n\r\nThe funeral of the old Captain had taken place, and his will had been\r\nread. It was very concise, and had been executed about five years\r\nprevious to his death. It was attested by his solicitors, Messrs.\r\nNyttleton and Tayling, of Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Fields. The whole of his estate,\r\nreal and personal, was bequeathed to his daughter Cytherea, for her sole\r\nand absolute use, subject only to the payment of a legacy to the rector,\r\ntheir relative, and a few small amounts to the servants.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe had not chosen the easiest chair of her boudoir to sit\r\nin, or even a chair of ordinary comfort, but an uncomfortable, high,\r\nnarrow-backed, oak framed and seated chair, which was allowed to\r\nremain in the room only on the ground of being a companion in artistic\r\nquaintness to an old coffer beside it, and was never used except to\r\nstand in to reach for a book from the highest row of shelves. But she\r\nhad sat erect in this chair for more than an hour, for the reason that\r\nshe was utterly unconscious of what her actions and bodily feelings\r\nwere. The chair had stood nearest her path on entering the room, and she\r\nhad gone to it in a dream.\r\n\r\nShe sat in the attitude which denotes unflagging, intense, concentrated\r\nthought--as if she were cast in bronze. Her feet were together, her body\r\nbent a little forward, and quite unsupported by the back of the chair;\r\nher hands on her knees, her eyes fixed intently on the corner of a\r\nfootstool.\r\n\r\nAt last she moved and tapped her fingers upon the table at her side.\r\nHer pent-up ideas had finally found some channel to advance in. Motions\r\nbecame more and more frequent as she laboured to carry further and\r\nfurther the problem which occupied her brain. She sat back and drew\r\na long breath: she sat sideways and leant her forehead upon her\r\nhand. Later still she arose, walked up and down the room--at first\r\nabstractedly, with her features as firmly set as ever; but by degrees\r\nher brow relaxed, her footsteps became lighter and more leisurely; her\r\nhead rode gracefully and was no longer bowed. She plumed herself like a\r\nswan after exertion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 she said aloud. \xe2\x80\x98To get _him_ here without letting him know that\r\nI have any other object than that of getting a useful man--that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ndifficulty--and that I think I can master.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe rang for the new maid, a placid woman of forty with a few grey\r\nhairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask Miss Graye if she can come to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea was not far off, and came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know anything about architects and surveyors?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss\r\nAldclyffe abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Know anything?\xe2\x80\x99 replied Cytherea, poising herself on her toe to\r\nconsider the compass of the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--know anything,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Owen is an architect and surveyor\xe2\x80\x99s draughtsman,\xe2\x80\x99 the maiden said, and\r\nthought of somebody else who was likewise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes! that\xe2\x80\x99s why I asked you. What are the different kinds of work\r\ncomprised in an architect\xe2\x80\x99s practice? They lay out estates, and\r\nsuperintend the various works done upon them, I should think, among\r\nother things?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Those are, more properly, a land or building steward\xe2\x80\x99s duties--at least\r\nI have always imagined so. Country architects include those things in\r\ntheir practice; city architects don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know that, child. But a steward\xe2\x80\x99s is an indefinite fast and loose\r\nprofession, it seems to me. Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you think that a man who had been\r\nbrought up as an architect would do for a steward?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea had doubts whether an architect pure would do.\r\n\r\nThe chief pleasure connected with asking an opinion lies in not adopting\r\nit. Miss Aldclyffe replied decisively--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense; of course he would. Your brother Owen makes plans for country\r\nbuildings--such as cottages, stables, homesteads, and so on?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; he does.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And superintends the building of them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; he will soon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And he surveys land?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And he knows about hedges and ditches--how wide they ought to be,\r\nboundaries, levelling, planting trees to keep away the winds, measuring\r\ntimber, houses for ninety-nine years, and such things?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have never heard him say that; but I think Mr. Gradfield does those\r\nthings. Owen, I am afraid, is inexperienced as yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; your brother is not old enough for such a post yet, of course.\r\nAnd then there are rent-days, the audit and winding up of tradesmen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccounts. I am afraid, Cytherea, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know much more about the\r\nmatter than I do myself.... I am going out just now,\xe2\x80\x99 she continued. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nshall not want you to walk with me to-day. Run away till dinner-time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe went out of doors, and down the steps to the lawn: then\r\nturning to the left, through a shrubbery, she opened a wicket and passed\r\ninto a neglected and leafy carriage-drive, leading down the hill. This\r\nshe followed till she reached the point of its greatest depression,\r\nwhich was also the lowest ground in the whole grove.\r\n\r\nThe trees here were so interlaced, and hung their branches so near the\r\nground, that a whole summer\xe2\x80\x99s day was scarcely long enough to change\r\nthe air pervading the spot from its normal state of coolness to even a\r\ntemporary warmth. The unvarying freshness was helped by the nearness of\r\nthe ground to the level of the springs, and by the presence of a deep,\r\nsluggish stream close by, equally well shaded by bushes and a high wall.\r\nFollowing the road, which now ran along at the margin of the stream,\r\nshe came to an opening in the wall, on the other side of the water,\r\nrevealing a large rectangular nook from which the stream proceeded,\r\ncovered with froth, and accompanied by a dull roar. Two more steps,\r\nand she was opposite the nook, in full view of the cascade forming its\r\nfurther boundary. Over the top could be seen the bright outer sky in the\r\nform of a crescent, caused by the curve of a bridge across the rapids,\r\nand the trees above.\r\n\r\nBeautiful as was the scene she did not look in that direction. The same\r\nstanding-ground afforded another prospect, straight in the front, less\r\nsombre than the water on the right or the trees all around. The avenue\r\nand grove which flanked it abruptly terminated a few yards ahead, where\r\nthe ground began to rise, and on the remote edge of the greensward thus\r\nlaid open, stood all that remained of the original manor-house, to which\r\nthe dark margin-line of the trees in the avenue formed an adequate\r\nand well-fitting frame. It was the picture thus presented that was\r\nnow interesting Miss Aldclyffe--not artistically or historically,\r\nbut practically--as regarded its fitness for adaptation to modern\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nIn front, detached from everything else, rose the most ancient portion\r\nof the structure--an old arched gateway, flanked by the bases of two\r\nsmall towers, and nearly covered with creepers, which had clambered\r\nover the eaves of the sinking roof, and up the gable to the crest of the\r\nAldclyffe family perched on the apex. Behind this, at a distance of ten\r\nor twenty yards, came the only portion of the main building that still\r\nexisted--an Elizabethan fragment, consisting of as much as could be\r\ncontained under three gables and a cross roof behind. Against the wall\r\ncould be seen ragged lines indicating the form of other destroyed gables\r\nwhich had once joined it there. The mullioned and transomed windows,\r\ncontaining five or six lights, were mostly bricked up to the extent\r\nof two or three, and the remaining portion fitted with cottage\r\nwindow-frames carelessly inserted, to suit the purpose to which the\r\nold place was now applied, it being partitioned out into small rooms\r\ndownstairs to form cottages for two labourers and their families; the\r\nupper portion was arranged as a storehouse for divers kinds of roots and\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the picturesque spot, after her survey from this\r\npoint, went up to the walls and walked into the old court, where the\r\npaving-stones were pushed sideways and upwards by the thrust of the\r\ngrasses between them. Two or three little children, with their fingers\r\nin their mouths, came out to look at her, and then ran in to tell their\r\nmothers in loud tones of secrecy that Miss Aldclyffe was coming. Miss\r\nAldclyffe, however, did not come in. She concluded her survey of the\r\nexterior by making a complete circuit of the building; then turned into\r\na nook a short distance off where round and square timber, a saw-pit,\r\nplanks, grindstones, heaps of building stone and brick, explained that\r\nthe spot was the centre of operations for the building work done on the\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nShe paused, and looked around. A man who had seen her from the window of\r\nthe workshops behind, came out and respectfully lifted his hat to her.\r\nIt was the first time she had been seen walking outside the house since\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Strooden, could the Old House be made a decent residence of, without\r\nmuch trouble?\xe2\x80\x99 she inquired.\r\n\r\nThe mechanic considered, and spoke as each consideration completed\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, that two-thirds of the place is already pulled\r\ndown, or gone to ruin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; I know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And that what\xe2\x80\x99s left may almost as well be, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why may it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Twas so cut up inside when they made it into cottages, that the whole\r\ncarcase is full of cracks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Still by pulling down the inserted partitions, and adding a little\r\noutside, it could be made to answer the purpose of an ordinary six or\r\neight-roomed house?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98About what would it cost?\xe2\x80\x99 was the question which had invariably come\r\nnext in every communication of this kind to which the superintending\r\nworkman had been a party during his whole experience. To his surprise,\r\nMiss Aldclyffe did not put it. The man thought her object in altering an\r\nold house must have been an unusually absorbing one not to prompt what\r\nwas so instinctive in owners as hardly to require any prompting at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you: that\xe2\x80\x99s sufficient, Strooden,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98You will understand\r\nthat it is not unlikely some alteration may be made here in a short\r\ntime, with reference to the management of the affairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStrooden said \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 in a complex voice, and looked uneasy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98During the life of Captain Aldclyffe, with you as the foreman of works,\r\nand he himself as his own steward, everything worked well. But now\r\nit may be necessary to have a steward, whose management will encroach\r\nfurther upon things which have hitherto been left in your hands than did\r\nyour late master\xe2\x80\x99s. What I mean is, that he will directly and in detail\r\nsuperintend all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then--I shall not be wanted, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 he faltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes; if you like to stay on as foreman in the yard and workshops\r\nonly. I should be sorry to lose you. However, you had better consider. I\r\nwill send for you in a few days.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLeaving him to suspense, and all the ills that came in its\r\ntrain--distracted application to his duties, and an undefined number\r\nof sleepless nights and untasted dinners, Miss Aldclyffe looked at her\r\nwatch and returned to the House. She was about to keep an appointment\r\nwith her solicitor, Mr. Nyttleton, who had been to Budmouth, and was\r\ncoming to Knapwater on his way back to London.\r\n\r\n2. AUGUST THE TWENTIETH\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday subsequent to Mr. Nyttleton\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Knapwater House,\r\nthe subjoined advertisement appeared in the Field and the Builder\r\nnewspapers:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                     \xe2\x80\x98LAND STEWARD.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A gentleman of integrity and professional skill is required immediately\r\nfor the MANAGEMENT of an ESTATE, containing about 1000 acres, upon\r\nwhich agricultural improvements and the erection of buildings are\r\ncontemplated. He must be a man of superior education, unmarried, and not\r\nmore than thirty years of age. Considerable preference will be shown\r\nfor one who possesses an artistic as well as a practical knowledge of\r\nplanning and laying out. The remuneration will consist of a salary of\r\n220 pounds, with the old manor-house as a residence--Address Messrs.\r\nNyttleton and Tayling, solicitors, Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Fields.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nA copy of each paper was sent to Miss Aldclyffe on the day of\r\npublication. The same evening she told Cytherea that she was advertising\r\nfor a steward, who would live at the old manor-house, showing her the\r\npapers containing the announcement.\r\n\r\nWhat was the drift of that remark? thought the maiden; or was it merely\r\nmade to her in confidential intercourse, as other arrangements were\r\ntold her daily. Yet it seemed to have more meaning than common. She\r\nremembered the conversation about architects and surveyors, and her\r\nbrother Owen. Miss Aldclyffe knew that his situation was precarious,\r\nthat he was well educated and practical, and was applying himself heart\r\nand soul to the details of the profession and all connected with\r\nit. Miss Aldclyffe might be ready to take him if he could compete\r\nsuccessfully with others who would reply. She hazarded a question:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would it be desirable for Owen to answer it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe peremptorily.\r\n\r\nA flat answer of this kind had ceased to alarm Cytherea. Miss\r\nAldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s blunt mood was not her worst. Cytherea thought of another\r\nman, whose name, in spite of resolves, tears, renunciations and injured\r\npride, lingered in her ears like an old familiar strain. That man was\r\nqualified for a stewardship under a king.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would it be of any use if Edward Springrove were to answer it?\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid, resolutely enunciating the name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None whatever,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Aldclyffe, again in the same decided tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are very unkind to speak in that way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now don\xe2\x80\x99t pout like a goosie, as you are. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want men like either\r\nof them, for, of course, I must look to the good of the estate rather\r\nthan to that of any individual. The man I want must have been more\r\nspecially educated. I have told you that we are going to London next\r\nweek; it is mostly on this account.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea found that she had mistaken the drift of Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npeculiar explicitness on the subject of advertising, and wrote to tell\r\nher brother that if he saw the notice it would be useless to reply.\r\n\r\n3. AUGUST THE TWENTY-FIFTH\r\n\r\nFive days after the above-mentioned dialogue took place they went to\r\nLondon, and, with scarcely a minute\xe2\x80\x99s pause, to the solicitors\xe2\x80\x99 offices\r\nin Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Fields.\r\n\r\nThey alighted opposite one of the characteristic entrances about the\r\nplace--a gate which was never, and could never be, closed, flanked by\r\nlamp-standards carrying no lamp. Rust was the only active agent to be\r\nseen there at this time of the day and year. The palings along the\r\nfront were rusted away at their base to the thinness of wires, and the\r\nsuccessive coats of paint, with which they were overlaid in bygone\r\ndays, had been completely undermined by the same insidious canker, which\r\nlifted off the paint in flakes, leaving the raw surface of the iron on\r\npalings, standards, and gate hinges, of a staring blood-red.\r\n\r\nBut once inside the railings the picture changed. The court and offices\r\nwere a complete contrast to the grand ruin of the outwork which enclosed\r\nthem. Well-painted respectability extended over, within, and around the\r\ndoorstep; and in the carefully swept yard not a particle of dust was\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nMr. Nyttleton, who had just come up from Margate, where he was staying\r\nwith his family, was standing at the top of his own staircase as the\r\npair ascended. He politely took them inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is there a comfortable room in which this young lady can sit during our\r\ninterview?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe.\r\n\r\nIt was rather a favourite habit of hers to make much of Cytherea when\r\nthey were out, and snub her for it afterwards when they got home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly--Mr. Tayling\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99 Cytherea was shown into an inner room.\r\n\r\nSocial definitions are all made relatively: an absolute datum is only\r\nimagined. The small gentry about Knapwater seemed unpractised to Miss\r\nAldclyffe, Miss Aldclyffe herself seemed unpractised to Mr. Nyttleton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexperienced old eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now then,\xe2\x80\x99 the lady said, when she was alone with the lawyer; \xe2\x80\x98what is\r\nthe result of our advertisement?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was late summer; the estate-agency, building, engineering, and\r\nsurveying worlds were dull. There were forty-five replies to the\r\nadvertisement.\r\n\r\nMr. Nyttleton spread them one by one before Miss Aldclyffe. \xe2\x80\x98You will\r\nprobably like to read some of them yourself, madam?\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not trouble you with those which are from persons manifestly\r\nunfit at first sight,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued; and began selecting from the heap\r\ntwos and threes which he had marked, collecting others into his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The man we want lies among these, if my judgment doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deceive me,\r\nand from them it would be advisable to select a certain number to be\r\ncommunicated with.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like to see every one--only just to glance them over--exactly\r\nas they came,\xe2\x80\x99 she said suasively.\r\n\r\nHe looked as if he thought this a waste of his time, but dismissing his\r\nsentiment unfolded each singly and laid it before her. As he laid them\r\nout, it struck him that she studied them quite as rapidly as he could\r\nspread them. He slyly glanced up from the outer corner of his eye to\r\nhers, and noticed that all she did was look at the name at the bottom of\r\nthe letter, and then put the enclosure aside without further ceremony.\r\nHe thought this an odd way of inquiring into the merits of forty-five\r\nmen who at considerable trouble gave in detail reasons why they believed\r\nthemselves well qualified for a certain post. She came to the final one,\r\nand put it down with the rest.\r\n\r\nThen the lady said that in her opinion it would be best to get as many\r\nreplies as they possibly could before selecting--\xe2\x80\x98to give us a wider\r\nchoice. What do you think, Mr. Nyttleton?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him, he said, that a greater number than those they already\r\nhad would scarcely be necessary, and if they waited for more, there\r\nwould be this disadvantage attending it, that some of those they now\r\ncould command would possibly not be available.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind, we will run that risk,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe. \xe2\x80\x98Let the\r\nadvertisement be inserted once more, and then we will certainly settle\r\nthe matter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Nyttleton bowed, and seemed to think Miss Aldclyffe, for a single\r\nwoman, and one who till so very recently had never concerned herself\r\nwith business of any kind, a very meddlesome client. But she was rich,\r\nand handsome still. \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s a new broom in estate-management as yet,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe thought. \xe2\x80\x98She will soon get tired of this,\xe2\x80\x99 and he parted from her\r\nwithout a sentiment which could mar his habitual blandness.\r\n\r\nThe two ladies then proceeded westward. Dismissing the cab in Waterloo\r\nPlace, they went along Pall Mall on foot, where in place of the usual\r\nwell-dressed clubbists--rubicund with alcohol--were to be seen, in linen\r\npinafores, flocks of house-painters pallid from white lead. When they\r\nhad reached the Green Park, Cytherea proposed that they should sit down\r\nawhile under the young elms at the brow of the hill. This they did--the\r\ngrowl of Piccadilly on their left hand--the monastic seclusion of the\r\nPalace on their right: before them, the clock tower of the Houses\r\nof Parliament, standing forth with a metallic lustre against a livid\r\nLambeth sky.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe still carried in her hand a copy of the newspaper, and\r\nwhile Cytherea had been interesting herself in the picture around,\r\nglanced again at the advertisement.\r\n\r\nShe heaved a slight sigh, and began to fold it up again. In the action\r\nher eye caught sight of two consecutive advertisements on the cover,\r\none relating to some lecture on Art, and addressed to members of the\r\nInstitute of Architects. The other emanated from the same source, but\r\nwas addressed to the public, and stated that the exhibition of drawings\r\nat the Institute\xe2\x80\x99s rooms would close at the end of that week.\r\n\r\nHer eye lighted up. She sent Cytherea back to the hotel in a cab, then\r\nturned round by Piccadilly into Bond Street, and proceeded to the rooms\r\nof the Institute. The secretary was sitting in the lobby. After making\r\nher payment, and looking at a few of the drawings on the walls, in the\r\ncompany of three gentlemen, the only other visitors to the exhibition,\r\nshe turned back and asked if she might be allowed to see a list of the\r\nmembers. She was a little connected with the architectural world, she\r\nsaid, with a smile, and was interested in some of the names.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here it is, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, politely handing her a pamphlet\r\ncontaining the names.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe turned the leaves till she came to the letter M. The name\r\nshe hoped to find there was there, with the address appended, as was the\r\ncase with all the rest.\r\n\r\nThe address was at some chambers in a street not far from Charing Cross.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Chambers,\xe2\x80\x99 as a residence, had always been assumed by the lady to imply\r\nthe condition of a bachelor. She murmured two words, \xe2\x80\x98There still.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnother request had yet to be made, but it was of a more noticeable kind\r\nthan the first, and might compromise the secrecy with which she wished\r\nto act throughout this episode. Her object was to get one of the\r\nenvelopes lying on the secretary\xe2\x80\x99s table, stamped with the die of the\r\nInstitute; and in order to get it she was about to ask if she might\r\nwrite a note.\r\n\r\nBut the secretary\xe2\x80\x99s back chanced to be turned, and he now went towards\r\none of the men at the other end of the room, who had called him to ask\r\nsome question relating to an etching on the wall. Quick as thought, Miss\r\nAldclyffe stood before the table, slipped her hand behind her, took one\r\nof the envelopes and put it in her pocket.\r\n\r\nShe sauntered round the rooms for two or three minutes longer, then\r\nwithdrew and returned to her hotel.\r\n\r\nHere she cut the Knapwater advertisement from the paper, put it into the\r\nenvelope she had stolen, embossed with the society\xe2\x80\x99s stamp, and directed\r\nit in a round clerkly hand to the address she had seen in the list of\r\nmembers\xe2\x80\x99 names submitted to her:--\r\n\r\n     AENEAS MANSTON, ESQ.,\r\n          WYKEHAM CHAMBERS,\r\n               SPRING GARDENS.\r\n\r\nThis ended her first day\xe2\x80\x99s work in London.\r\n\r\n4. FROM AUGUST THE TWENTY-SIXTH TO SEPTEMBER THE FIRST\r\n\r\nThe two Cythereas continued at the Westminster Hotel, Miss Aldclyffe\r\ninforming her companion that business would detain them in London\r\nanother week. The days passed as slowly and quietly as days can pass in\r\na city at that time of the year, the shuttered windows about the squares\r\nand terraces confronting their eyes like the white and sightless orbs of\r\nblind men. On Thursday Mr. Nyttleton called, bringing the whole number\r\nof replies to the advertisement. Cytherea was present at the interview,\r\nby Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s request--either from whim or design.\r\n\r\nTen additional letters were the result of the second week\xe2\x80\x99s insertion,\r\nmaking fifty-five in all. Miss Aldclyffe looked them over as before. One\r\nwas signed--\r\n\r\nAENEAS MANSTON,     133, TURNGATE STREET,\r\n          LIVERPOOL.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, then, Mr. Nyttleton, will you make a selection, and I will add one\r\nor two,\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Aldclyffe said.\r\n\r\nMr. Nyttleton scanned the whole heap of letters, testimonials, and\r\nreferences, sorting them into two heaps. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s missive, after a mere\r\nglance, was thrown amongst the summarily rejected ones.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe read, or pretended to read after the lawyer. When he had\r\nfinished, five lay in the group he had selected. \xe2\x80\x98Would you like to add\r\nto the number?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, turning to the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 she said carelessly. \xe2\x80\x98Well, two or three additional ones rather\r\ntook my fancy,\xe2\x80\x99 she added, searching for some in the larger collection.\r\n\r\nShe drew out three. One was Manston\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98These eight, then, shall be communicated with,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lawyer, taking\r\nup the eight letters and placing them by themselves.\r\n\r\nThey stood up. \xe2\x80\x98If I myself, Miss Aldclyffe, were only concerned\r\npersonally,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, in an off-hand way, and holding up a letter\r\nsingly, \xe2\x80\x98I should choose this man unhesitatingly. He writes honestly,\r\nis not afraid to name what he does not consider himself well acquainted\r\nwith--a rare thing to find in answers to advertisements; he is well\r\nrecommended, and possesses some qualities rarely found in combination.\r\nOddly enough, he is not really a steward. He was bred a farmer, studied\r\nbuilding affairs, served on an estate for some time, then went with an\r\narchitect, and is now well qualified as architect, estate agent, and\r\nsurveyor. That man is sure to have a fine head for a manor like yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHe tapped the letter as he spoke. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I should choose him without\r\nhesitation--speaking personally.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I think,\xe2\x80\x99 she said artificially, \xe2\x80\x98I should choose this one as a\r\nmatter of mere personal whim, which, of course, can\xe2\x80\x99t be given way to\r\nwhen practical questions have to be considered.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea, after looking out of the window, and then at the newspapers,\r\nhad become interested in the proceedings between the clever Miss\r\nAldclyffe and the keen old lawyer, which reminded her of a game\r\nat cards. She looked inquiringly at the two letters--one in Miss\r\nAldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s hand, the other in Mr. Nyttleton\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the name of your man?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His name--\xe2\x80\x99 said the lawyer, looking down the page; \xe2\x80\x98what is his\r\nname?--it is Edward Springrove.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe glanced towards Cytherea, who was getting red and pale by\r\nturns. She looked imploringly at Miss Aldclyffe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The name of my man,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe, looking at her letter in\r\nturn; \xe2\x80\x98is, I think--yes--AEneas Manston.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n5. SEPTEMBER THE THIRD\r\n\r\nThe next morning but one was appointed for the interviews, which were to\r\nbe at the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s offices. Mr. Nyttleton and Mr. Tayling were both in\r\ntown for the day, and the candidates were admitted one by one into a\r\nprivate room. In the window recess was seated Miss Aldclyffe, wearing\r\nher veil down.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer had, in his letters to the selected number, timed each\r\ncandidate at an interval of ten or fifteen minutes from those preceding\r\nand following. They were shown in as they arrived, and had short\r\nconversations with Mr. Nyttleton--terse, and to the point. Miss\r\nAldclyffe neither moved nor spoke during this proceeding; it might have\r\nbeen supposed that she was quite unmindful of it, had it not been\r\nfor what was revealed by a keen penetration of the veil covering her\r\ncountenance--the rays from two bright black eyes, directed towards the\r\nlawyer and his interlocutor.\r\n\r\nSpringrove came fifth; Manston seventh. When the examination of all was\r\nended, and the last man had retired, Nyttleton, again as at the former\r\ntime, blandly asked his client which of the eight she personally\r\npreferred. \xe2\x80\x98I still think the fifth we spoke to, Springrove, the man\r\nwhose letter I pounced upon at first, to be by far the best qualified,\r\nin short, most suitable generally.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry to say that I differ from you; I lean to my first notion\r\nstill--that Mr.--Mr. Manston is most desirable in tone and bearing, and\r\neven specifically; I think he would suit me best in the long-run.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Nyttleton looked out of the window at the whitened wall of the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course, madam, your opinion may be perfectly sound and reliable;\r\na sort of instinct, I know, often leads ladies by a short cut to\r\nconclusions truer than those come to by men after laborious round-about\r\ncalculations, based on long experience. I must say I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, pray?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, let us look first at his letter of answer to the advertisement.\r\nHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t reply till the last insertion; that\xe2\x80\x99s one thing. His letter is\r\nbold and frank in tone, so bold and frank that the second thought after\r\nreading it is that not honesty, but unscrupulousness of conscience\r\ndictated it. It is written in an indifferent mood, as if he felt that he\r\nwas humbugging us in his statement that he was the right man for such\r\nan office, that he tried hard to get it only as a matter of form which\r\nrequired that he should neglect no opportunity that came in his way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may be right, Mr. Nyttleton, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see the grounds of\r\nyour reasoning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has been, as you perceive, almost entirely used to the office duties\r\nof a city architect, the experience we don\xe2\x80\x99t want. You want a man\r\nwhose acquaintance with rural landed properties is more practical\r\nand closer--somebody who, if he has not filled exactly such an office\r\nbefore, has lived a country life, knows the ins and outs of country\r\ntenancies, building, farming, and so on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s by far the most intellectual looking of them all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; he may be--your opinion, Miss Aldclyffe, is worth more than mine\r\nin that matter. And more than you say, he is a man of parts--his brain\r\npower would soon enable him to master details and fit him for the post,\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t much doubt that. But to speak clearly\xe2\x80\x99 (here his words started\r\noff at a jog-trot) \xe2\x80\x98I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t run the risk of placing the management\r\nof an estate of mine in his hands on any account whatever. There, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nflat and plain, madam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, definitely,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, with a show of impatience, \xe2\x80\x98what is your\r\nreason?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a voluptuary with activity; which is a very bad form of man--as\r\nbad as it is rare.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh. Thank you for your explicit statement, Mr. Nyttleton,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss\r\nAldclyffe, starting a little and flushing with displeasure.\r\n\r\nMr. Nyttleton nodded slightly, as a sort of neutral motion, simply\r\nsignifying a receipt of the information, good or bad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I really think it is hardly worth while to trouble you further\r\nin this,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the lady. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s quite good enough for a little\r\ninsignificant place like mine at Knapwater; and I know that I could not\r\nget on with one of the others for a single month. We\xe2\x80\x99ll try him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, Miss Aldclyffe,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lawyer. And Mr. Manston was\r\nwritten to, to the effect that he was the successful competitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you see how unmistakably her temper was getting the better of her,\r\nthat minute you were in the room?\xe2\x80\x99 said Nyttleton to Tayling, when their\r\nclient had left the house. Nyttleton was a man who surveyed everybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter in a sunless and shadowless northern light. A culpable\r\nslyness, which marked him as a boy, had been moulded by Time, the\r\nImprover, into honourable circumspection.\r\n\r\nWe frequently find that the quality which, conjoined with the simplicity\r\nof the child, is vice, is virtue when it pervades the knowledge of the\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She was as near as damn-it to boiling over when I added up her man,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncontinued Nyttleton. \xe2\x80\x98His handsome face is his qualification in her\r\neyes. They have met before; I saw that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem conscious of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the junior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He didn\xe2\x80\x99t. That was rather puzzling to me. But still, if ever a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface spoke out plainly that she was in love with a man, hers did that\r\nshe was with him. Poor old maid, she\xe2\x80\x99s almost old enough to be his\r\nmother. If that Manston\xe2\x80\x99s a schemer he\xe2\x80\x99ll marry her, as sure as I am\r\nNyttleton. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope he\xe2\x80\x99s honest, however.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she\xe2\x80\x99s in love with him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tayling. He had seen but\r\nlittle of the pair, and yet he could not reconcile what he had noticed\r\nin Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour with the idea that it was the bearing of a\r\nwoman towards her lover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, your experience of the fiery phenomenon is more recent than\r\nmine,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Nyttleton carelessly. \xe2\x80\x98And you may remember the nature\r\nof it best.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. THE EVENTS OF EIGHTEEN DAYS\r\n\r\n1. FROM THE THIRD TO THE NINETEENTH OF SEPTEMBER\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s tenderness towards Cytherea, between the hours of her\r\nirascibility, increased till it became no less than doting fondness.\r\nLike Nature in the tropics, with her hurricanes and the subsequent\r\nluxuriant vegetation effacing their ravages, Miss Aldclyffe compensated\r\nfor her outbursts by excess of generosity afterwards. She seemed to be\r\ncompletely won out of herself by close contact with a young woman whose\r\nmodesty was absolutely unimpaired, and whose artlessness was as perfect\r\nas was compatible with the complexity necessary to produce the due charm\r\nof womanhood. Cytherea, on her part, perceived with honest satisfaction\r\nthat her influence for good over Miss Aldclyffe was considerable. Ideas\r\nand habits peculiar to the younger, which the elder lady had originally\r\nimitated as a mere whim, she grew in course of time to take a positive\r\ndelight in. Among others were evening and morning prayers, dreaming over\r\nout-door scenes, learning a verse from some poem whilst dressing.\r\n\r\nYet try to force her sympathies as much as she would, Cytherea could\r\nfeel no more than thankful for this, even if she always felt as much\r\nas thankful. The mysterious cloud hanging over the past life of her\r\ncompanion, of which the uncertain light already thrown upon it only\r\nseemed to render still darker the unpenetrated remainder, nourished\r\nin her a feeling which was scarcely too slight to be called dread. She\r\nwould have infinitely preferred to be treated distantly, as the mere\r\ndependent, by such a changeable nature--like a fountain, always\r\nherself, yet always another. That a crime of any deep dye had ever been\r\nperpetrated or participated in by her namesake, she would not believe;\r\nbut the reckless adventuring of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s youth seemed connected with\r\ndeeds of darkness rather than of light.\r\n\r\nSometimes Miss Aldclyffe appeared to be on the point of making some\r\nabsorbing confidence, but reflection invariably restrained her. Cytherea\r\nhoped that such a confidence would come with time, and that she might\r\nthus be a means of soothing a mind which had obviously known extreme\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s reticence concerning her past was not imitated by\r\nCytherea. Though she never disclosed the one fact of her knowledge\r\nthat the love-suit between Miss Aldclyffe and her father terminated\r\nabnormally, the maiden\xe2\x80\x99s natural ingenuousness on subjects not set down\r\nfor special guard had enabled Miss Aldclyffe to worm from her, fragment\r\nby fragment, every detail of her father\xe2\x80\x99s history. Cytherea saw how\r\ndeeply Miss Aldclyffe sympathized--and it compensated her, to some\r\nextent, for the hasty resentments of other times.\r\n\r\nThus uncertainly she lived on. It was perceived by the servants of the\r\nHouse that some secret bond of connection existed between Miss Aldclyffe\r\nand her companion. But they were woman and woman, not woman and man, the\r\nfacts were ethereal and refined, and so they could not be worked up\r\ninto a taking story. Whether, as old critics disputed, a supernatural\r\nmachinery be necessary to an epic or no, an ungodly machinery is\r\ndecidedly necessary to a scandal.\r\n\r\nAnother letter had come to her from Edward--very short, but full of\r\nentreaty, asking why she would not write just one line--just one line of\r\ncold friendship at least? She then allowed herself to think, little by\r\nlittle, whether she had not perhaps been too harsh with him; and at last\r\nwondered if he were really much to blame for being engaged to another\r\nwoman. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, Brain, there is one in me stronger than you!\xe2\x80\x99 she said. The\r\nyoung maid now continually pulled out his letter, read it and re-read\r\nit, almost crying with pity the while, to think what wretched suspense\r\nhe must be enduring at her silence, till her heart chid her for her\r\ncruelty. She felt that she must send him a line--one little line--just a\r\nwee line to keep him alive, poor thing; sighing like Donna Clara--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98Ah, were he now before me,\r\n        In spite of injured pride,\r\n      I fear my eyes would pardon\r\n        Before my tongue could chide.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n2. SEPTEMBER THE TWENTIETH. THREE TO FOUR P.M.\r\n\r\nIt was the third week in September, about five weeks after Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrival, when Miss Aldclyffe requested her one day to go through the\r\nvillage of Carriford and assist herself in collecting the subscriptions\r\nmade by some of the inhabitants of the parish to a religious society\r\nshe patronized. Miss Aldclyffe formed one of what was called a Ladies\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAssociation, each member of which collected tributary streams of\r\nshillings from her inferiors, to add to her own pound at the end.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe took particular interest in Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s appearance that\r\nafternoon, and the object of her attention was, indeed, gratifying\r\nto look at. The sight of the lithe girl, set off by an airy dress,\r\ncoquettish jacket, flexible hat, a ray of starlight in each eye and a\r\nwar of lilies and roses in each cheek, was a palpable pleasure to the\r\nmistress of the mansion, yet a pleasure which appeared to partake less\r\nof the nature of affectionate satisfaction than of mental gratification.\r\n\r\nEight names were printed in the report as belonging to Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlist, with the amount of subscription-money attached to each.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will collect the first four, whilst you do the same with the last\r\nfour,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe.\r\n\r\nThe names of two tradespeople stood first in Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s share: then came\r\na Miss Hinton: last of all in the printed list was Mr. Springrove\r\nthe elder. Underneath his name was pencilled, in Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhandwriting, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Manston.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nManston had arrived on the estate, in the capacity of steward, three or\r\nfour days previously, and occupied the old manor-house, which had been\r\naltered and repaired for his reception.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Call on Mr. Manston,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady impressively, looking at the name\r\nwritten under Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s portion of the list.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But he does not subscribe yet?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know it; but call and leave him a report. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say you would be pleased if he would subscribe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--say I should be pleased if he would,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Miss Aldclyffe,\r\nsmiling. \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye. Don\xe2\x80\x99t hurry in your walk. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t get easily\r\nthrough your task to-day put off some of it till to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEach then started on her rounds: Cytherea going in the first place to\r\nthe old manor-house. Mr. Manston was not indoors, which was a relief\r\nto her. She called then on the two gentleman-farmers\xe2\x80\x99 wives, who\r\nsoon transacted their business with her, frigidly indifferent to her\r\npersonality. A person who socially is nothing is thought less of by\r\npeople who are not much than by those who are a great deal.\r\n\r\nShe then turned towards Peakhill Cottage, the residence of Miss Hinton,\r\nwho lived there happily enough, with an elderly servant and a house-dog\r\nas companions. Her father, and last remaining parent, had retired\r\nthither four years before this time, after having filled the post of\r\neditor to the Casterbridge Chronicle for eighteen or twenty years. There\r\nhe died soon after, and though comparatively a poor man, he left his\r\ndaughter sufficiently well provided for as a modest fundholder and\r\nclaimant of sundry small sums in dividends to maintain herself as\r\nmistress at Peakhill.\r\n\r\nAt Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s knock an inner door was heard to open and close, and\r\nfootsteps crossed the passage hesitatingly. The next minute Cytherea\r\nstood face to face with the lady herself.\r\n\r\nAdelaide Hinton was about nine-and-twenty years of age. Her hair\r\nwas plentiful, like Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s own; her teeth equalled Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nregularity and whiteness. But she was much paler, and had features\r\ntoo transparent to be in place among household surroundings. Her mouth\r\nexpressed love less forcibly than Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s, and, as a natural result\r\nof her greater maturity, her tread was less elastic, and she was more\r\nself-possessed.\r\n\r\nShe had been a girl of that kind which mothers praise as not forward, by\r\nway of contrast, when disparaging those warmer ones with whom loving is\r\nan end and not a means. Men of forty, too, said of her, \xe2\x80\x98a good sensible\r\nwife for any man, if she cares to marry,\xe2\x80\x99 the caring to marry being\r\nthrown in as the vaguest hypothesis, because she was so practical.\r\nYet it would be singular if, in such cases, the important subject of\r\nmarriage should be excluded from manipulation by hands that are ready\r\nfor practical performance in every domestic concern besides.\r\n\r\nCytherea was an acquisition, and the greeting was hearty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good afternoon! O yes--Miss Graye, from Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s. I have seen\r\nyou at church, and I am so glad you have called! Come in. I wonder if I\r\nhave change enough to pay my subscription.\xe2\x80\x99 She spoke girlishly.\r\n\r\nAdelaide, when in the company of a younger woman, always levelled\r\nherself down to that younger woman\xe2\x80\x99s age from a sense of justice to\r\nherself--as if, though not her own age at common law, it was in equity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, do at any time; not only on this errand. But you must step in for\r\na minute. Do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been wanting to come for several weeks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s right. Now you must see my house--lonely, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, for a single\r\nperson? People said it was odd for a young woman like me to keep on a\r\nhouse; but what did I care? If you knew the pleasure of locking up your\r\nown door, with the sensation that you reigned supreme inside it, you\r\nwould say it was worth the risk of being called odd. Mr. Springrove\r\nattends to my gardening, the dog attends to robbers, and whenever there\r\nis a snake or toad to kill, Jane does it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How nice! It is better than living in a town.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Far better. A town makes a cynic of me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe remark recalled, somewhat startlingly, to Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s mind, that\r\nEdward had used those very words to herself one evening at Budmouth.\r\n\r\nMiss Hinton opened an interior door and led her visitor into a small\r\ndrawing-room commanding a view of the country for miles.\r\n\r\nThe missionary business was soon settled; but the chat continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How lonely it must be here at night!\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea. \xe2\x80\x98Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nafraid?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At first I was, slightly. But I got used to the solitude. And you know\r\na sort of commonsense will creep even into timidity. I say to myself\r\nsometimes at night, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were anybody but a harmless woman, not worth\r\nthe trouble of a worm\xe2\x80\x99s ghost to appear to me, I should think that every\r\nsound I hear was a spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d But you must see all over my house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea was highly interested in seeing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say you _must_ do this, and you _must_ do that, as if you were a\r\nchild,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Adelaide. \xe2\x80\x98A privileged friend of mine tells me this\r\nuse of the imperative comes of being so constantly in nobody\xe2\x80\x99s society\r\nbut my own.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, yes. I suppose she is right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea called the friend \xe2\x80\x98she\xe2\x80\x99 by a rule of ladylike practice; for a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98friend\xe2\x80\x99 is delicately assumed by another friend to be of their\r\nown sex in the absence of knowledge to the contrary; just as cats are\r\ncalled she\xe2\x80\x99s until they prove themselves he\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nMiss Hinton laughed mysteriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I get a humorous reproof for it now and then, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHumorous reproof:\xe2\x80\x9d that\xe2\x80\x99s not from a woman: who can reprove humorously\r\nbut a man?\xe2\x80\x99 was the groove of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s thought at the remark. \xe2\x80\x98Your\r\nbrother reproves you, I expect,\xe2\x80\x99 said that innocent young lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Hinton, with a candid air. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis only a professional man\r\nI am acquainted with.\xe2\x80\x99 She looked out of the window.\r\n\r\nWomen are persistently imitative. No sooner did a thought flash\r\nthrough Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s mind that the man was a lover than she became a Miss\r\nAldclyffe in a mild form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I imagine he\xe2\x80\x99s a lover,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\nMiss Hinton smiled a smile of experience in that line.\r\n\r\nFew women, if taxed with having an admirer, are so free from vanity\r\nas to deny the impeachment, even if it is utterly untrue. When it does\r\nhappen to be true, they look pityingly away from the person who is so\r\nbenighted as to have got no further than suspecting it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There now--Miss Hinton; you are engaged to be married!\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea\r\naccusingly.\r\n\r\nAdelaide nodded her head practically. \xe2\x80\x98Well, yes, I am,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\nThe word \xe2\x80\x98engaged\xe2\x80\x99 had no sooner passed Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s lips than the sound\r\nof it--the mere sound of her own lips--carried her mind to the time and\r\ncircumstances under which Miss Aldclyffe had used it towards herself.\r\nA sickening thought followed--based but on a mere surmise; yet its\r\npresence took every other idea away from Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Miss Hinton\r\nhad used Edward\xe2\x80\x99s words about towns; she mentioned Mr. Springrove as\r\nattending to her garden. It could not be that Edward was the man! that\r\nMiss Aldclyffe had planned to reveal her rival thus!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you going to be married soon?\xe2\x80\x99 she inquired, with a steadiness the\r\nresult of a sort of fascination, but apparently of indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not very soon--still, soon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah-ha! In less than three months?\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Two.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow that the subject was well in hand, Adelaide wanted no more\r\nprompting. \xe2\x80\x98You won\xe2\x80\x99t tell anybody if I show you something?\xe2\x80\x99 she said,\r\nwith eager mystery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no, nobody. But does he live in this parish?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNothing proved yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s his name?\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea flatly. Her breath and heart had begun\r\ntheir old tricks, and came and went hotly. Miss Hinton could not see her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you think?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Hinton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98George?\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, with deceitful agony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Adelaide. \xe2\x80\x98But now, you shall see him first; come here;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand she led the way upstairs into her bedroom. There, standing on the\r\ndressing table in a little frame, was the unconscious portrait of Edward\r\nSpringrove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There he is,\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Hinton said, and a silence ensued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you very fond of him?\xe2\x80\x99 continued the miserable Cytherea at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, of course I am,\xe2\x80\x99 her companion replied, but in the tone of one who\r\n\xe2\x80\x98lived in Abraham\xe2\x80\x99s bosom all the year,\xe2\x80\x99 and was therefore untouched by\r\nsolemn thought at the fact. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s my cousin--a native of this village.\r\nWe were engaged before my father\xe2\x80\x99s death left me so lonely. I was only\r\ntwenty, and a much greater belle than I am now. We know each other\r\nthoroughly, as you may imagine. I give him a little sermonizing now and\r\nthen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, it\xe2\x80\x99s only in fun. He\xe2\x80\x99s very naughty sometimes--not really, you\r\nknow--but he will look at any pretty face when he sees it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStoring up this statement of his susceptibility as another item to\r\nbe miserable upon when she had time, \xe2\x80\x98How do you know that?\xe2\x80\x99 Cytherea\r\nasked, with a swelling heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, you know how things do come to women\xe2\x80\x99s ears. He used to live at\r\nBudmouth as an assistant-architect, and I found out that a young giddy\r\nthing of a girl who lives there somewhere took his fancy for a day\r\nor two. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel jealous at all--our engagement is so\r\nmatter-of-fact that neither of us can be jealous. And it was a mere\r\nflirtation--she was too silly for him. He\xe2\x80\x99s fond of rowing, and kindly\r\ngave her an airing for an evening or two. I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant they talked the\r\nmost unmitigated rubbish under the sun--all shallowness and pastime,\r\njust as everything is at watering places--neither of them caring a bit\r\nfor the other--she giggling like a goose all the time--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nConcentrated essence of woman pervaded the room rather than air.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She _didn\xe2\x80\x99t_! and it _wasn\xe2\x80\x99t_ shallowness!\xe2\x80\x99 Cytherea burst out, with\r\nbrimming eyes. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Twas deep deceit on one side, and entire confidence\r\non the other--yes, it was!\xe2\x80\x99 The pent-up emotion had swollen and swollen\r\ninside the young thing till the dam could no longer embay it. The\r\ninstant the words were out she would have given worlds to have been able\r\nto recall them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know her--or him?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Hinton, starting with suspicion at\r\nthe warmth shown.\r\n\r\nThe two rivals had now lost their personality quite. There was the same\r\nkeen brightness of eye, the same movement of the mouth, the same mind\r\nin both, as they looked doubtingly and excitedly at each other. As is\r\ninvariably the case with women when a man they care for is the subject\r\nof an excitement among them, the situation abstracted the differences\r\nwhich distinguished them as individuals, and left only the properties\r\ncommon to them as atoms of a sex.\r\n\r\nCytherea caught at the chance afforded her of not betraying herself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I know her,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Hinton, \xe2\x80\x98I am really vexed if my speaking so lightly\r\nof any friend of yours has hurt your feelings, but--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 Cytherea returned; \xe2\x80\x98it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, Miss Hinton. I\r\nthink I must leave you now. I have to call at other places. Yes--I must\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Hinton, in a perplexed state of mind, showed her visitor politely\r\ndownstairs to the door. Here Cytherea bade her a hurried adieu, and\r\nflitted down the garden into the lane.\r\n\r\nShe persevered in her duties with a wayward pleasure in giving herself\r\nmisery, as was her wont. Mr. Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s name was next on the list, and\r\nshe turned towards his dwelling, the Three Tranters Inn.\r\n\r\n3. FOUR TO FIVE P.M.\r\n\r\nThe cottages along Carriford village street were not so close but that\r\non one side or other of the road was always a hedge of hawthorn or\r\nprivet, over or through which could be seen gardens or orchards rich\r\nwith produce. It was about the middle of the early apple-harvest, and\r\nthe laden trees were shaken at intervals by the gatherers; the soft\r\npattering of the falling crop upon the grassy ground being diversified\r\nby the loud rattle of vagrant ones upon a rail, hencoop, basket,\r\nor lean-to roof, or upon the rounded and stooping backs of the\r\ncollectors--mostly children, who would have cried bitterly at receiving\r\nsuch a smart blow from any other quarter, but smilingly assumed it to be\r\nbut fun in apples.\r\n\r\nThe Three Tranters Inn, a many-gabled, mediaeval building, constructed\r\nalmost entirely of timber, plaster, and thatch, stood close to the line\r\nof the roadside, almost opposite the churchyard, and was connected\r\nwith a row of cottages on the left by thatched outbuildings. It was an\r\nuncommonly characteristic and handsome specimen of the genuine roadside\r\ninn of bygone times; and standing on one of the great highways in this\r\npart of England, had in its time been the scene of as much of what is\r\nnow looked upon as the romantic and genial experience of stage-coach\r\ntravelling as any halting-place in the country. The railway had absorbed\r\nthe whole stream of traffic which formerly flowed through the village\r\nand along by the ancient door of the inn, reducing the empty-handed\r\nlandlord, who used only to farm a few fields at the back of the house,\r\nto the necessity of eking out his attenuated income by increasing the\r\nextent of his agricultural business if he would still maintain his\r\nsocial standing. Next to the general stillness pervading the spot, the\r\nlong line of outbuildings adjoining the house was the most striking and\r\nsaddening witness to the passed-away fortunes of the Three Tranters Inn.\r\nIt was the bulk of the original stabling, and where once the hoofs of\r\ntwo-score horses had daily rattled over the stony yard, to and from the\r\nstalls within, thick grass now grew, whilst the line of roofs--once so\r\nstraight--over the decayed stalls, had sunk into vast hollows till they\r\nseemed like the cheeks of toothless age.\r\n\r\nOn a green plot at the other end of the building grew two or\r\nthree large, wide-spreading elm-trees, from which the sign was\r\nsuspended--representing the three men called tranters (irregular\r\ncarriers), standing side by side, and exactly alike to a hair\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth,\r\nthe grain of the wood and joints of the boards being visible through the\r\nthin paint depicting their forms, which were still further disfigured by\r\nred stains running downwards from the rusty nails above.\r\n\r\nUnder the trees now stood a cider-mill and press, and upon the spot\r\nsheltered by the boughs were gathered Mr. Springrove himself, his men,\r\nthe parish clerk, two or three other men, grinders and supernumeraries,\r\na woman with an infant in her arms, a flock of pigeons, and some little\r\nboys with straws in their mouths, endeavouring, whenever the men\xe2\x80\x99s backs\r\nwere turned, to get a sip of the sweet juice issuing from the vat.\r\n\r\nEdward Springrove the elder, the landlord, now more particularly a\r\nfarmer, and for two months in the year a cider-maker, was an employer of\r\nlabour of the old school, who worked himself among his men. He was now\r\nengaged in packing the pomace into horsehair bags with a rammer, and\r\nGad Weedy, his man, was occupied in shovelling up more from a tub at\r\nhis side. The shovel shone like silver from the action of the juice,\r\nand ever and anon, in its motion to and fro, caught the rays of the\r\ndeclining sun and reflected them in bristling stars of light.\r\n\r\nMr. Springrove had been too young a man when the pristine days of the\r\nThree Tranters had departed for ever to have much of the host left in\r\nhim now. He was a poet with a rough skin: one whose sturdiness was\r\nmore the result of external circumstances than of intrinsic nature. Too\r\nkindly constituted to be very provident, he was yet not imprudent.\r\nHe had a quiet humorousness of disposition, not out of keeping with a\r\nfrequent melancholy, the general expression of his countenance being one\r\nof abstraction. Like Walt Whitman he felt as his years increased--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98I foresee too much; it means more than I thought.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion he wore gaiters and a leathern apron, and worked\r\nwith his shirt-sleeves rolled up beyond his elbows, disclosing solid and\r\nfleshy rather than muscular arms. They were stained by the cider, and\r\ntwo or three brown apple-pips from the pomace he was handling were to be\r\nseen sticking on them here and there.\r\n\r\nThe other prominent figure was that of Richard Crickett, the parish\r\nclerk, a kind of Bowdlerized rake, who ate only as much as a woman,\r\nand had the rheumatism in his left hand. The remainder of the group,\r\nbrown-faced peasants, wore smock-frocks embroidered on the shoulders\r\nwith hearts and diamonds, and were girt round their middle with a strap,\r\nanother being worn round the right wrist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And have you seen the steward, Mr. Springrove?\xe2\x80\x99 said the clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just a glimpse of him; but \xe2\x80\x98twas just enough to show me that he\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nhere for long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why mid that be?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99ll never stand the vagaries of the female figure holden the\r\nreins--not he.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She d\xe2\x80\x99 pay en well,\xe2\x80\x99 said a grinder; \xe2\x80\x98and money\xe2\x80\x99s money.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--\xe2\x80\x98tis: very much so,\xe2\x80\x99 the clerk replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, naibour Crickett,\xe2\x80\x99 said Springrove, \xe2\x80\x98but she\xe2\x80\x99ll vlee in a\r\npassion--all the fat will be in the fire--and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end o\xe2\x80\x99t....\r\nYes, she is a one,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the farmer, resting, raising his eyes, and\r\nreading the features of a distant apple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gad, resting too (it is wonderful how prompt a journeyman\r\nis in following his master\xe2\x80\x99s initiative to rest) and reflectively\r\nregarding the ground in front of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True: a one is she,\xe2\x80\x99 the clerk chimed in, shaking his head ominously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She has such a temper,\xe2\x80\x99 said the farmer, \xe2\x80\x98and is so wilful too. You may\r\nas well try to stop a footpath as stop her when she has taken anything\r\ninto her head. I\xe2\x80\x99d as soon grind little green crabs all day as live wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis a temper she hev, \xe2\x80\x98tis,\xe2\x80\x99 the clerk replied, \xe2\x80\x98though I be a servant\r\nof the Church that say it. But she isn\xe2\x80\x99t goen to flee in a passion this\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe audience waited for the continuation of the speech, as if they knew\r\nfrom experience the exact distance off it lay in the future.\r\n\r\nThe clerk swallowed nothing as if it were a great deal, and then went\r\non, \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s some\xe2\x80\x99at between \xe2\x80\x98em: mark my words, naibours--there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsome\xe2\x80\x99at between \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98D\xe2\x80\x99ye mean it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I d\xe2\x80\x99 know it. He came last Saturday, didn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99A did, truly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gad Weedy, at the same time taking an apple from\r\nthe hopper of the mill, eating a piece, and flinging back the remainder\r\nto be ground up for cider.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He went to church a-Sunday,\xe2\x80\x99 said the clerk again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99A did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And she kept her eye upon en all the service, her face flickeren\r\nbetween red and white, but never stoppen at either.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Springrove nodded, and went to the press.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the clerk, \xe2\x80\x98you don\xe2\x80\x99t call her the kind o\xe2\x80\x99 woman to make\r\nmistakes in just trotten through the weekly service o\xe2\x80\x99 God? Why, as a\r\nrule she\xe2\x80\x99s as right as I be myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Springrove nodded again, and gave a twist to the screw of the press,\r\nfollowed in the movement by Gad at the other side; the two grinders\r\nexpressing by looks of the greatest concern that, if Miss Aldclyffe were\r\nas right at church as the clerk, she must be right indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, as right in the service o\xe2\x80\x99 God as I be myself,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated the\r\nclerk. \xe2\x80\x98But last Sunday, when we were in the tenth commandment, says\r\nshe, \xe2\x80\x9cIncline our hearts to keep this law,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, when \xe2\x80\x98twas \xe2\x80\x9cLaws\r\nin our hearts, we beseech Thee,\xe2\x80\x9d all the church through. Her eye was\r\nupon _him_--she was quite lost--\xe2\x80\x9cHearts to keep this law,\xe2\x80\x9d says she; she\r\nwas no more than a mere shadder at that tenth time--a mere shadder. You\r\nmi\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 mouthed across to her \xe2\x80\x9cLaws in our hearts we beseech Thee,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n fifty times over--she\xe2\x80\x99d never ha\xe2\x80\x99 noticed ye. She\xe2\x80\x99s in love wi\xe2\x80\x99 the man,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what she is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then she\xe2\x80\x99s a bigger stunpoll than I took her for,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Springrove.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, she\xe2\x80\x99s old enough to be his mother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The row\xe2\x80\x99ll be between her and that young Curlywig, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see. She\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t run the risk of that pretty face be-en near.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Clerk Crickett, I d\xe2\x80\x99 fancy you d\xe2\x80\x99 know everything about everybody,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Gad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well so\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 said the clerk modestly. \xe2\x80\x98I do know a little. It comes to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I d\xe2\x80\x99 know where from.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That wife o\xe2\x80\x99 thine. She\xe2\x80\x99s an entertainen woman, not to speak\r\ndisrespectful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is: and a winnen one. Look at the husbands she\xe2\x80\x99ve had--God bless\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder you could stand third in that list, Clerk Crickett,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nSpringrove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, \xe2\x80\x98t has been a power o\xe2\x80\x99 marvel to myself oftentimes. Yes,\r\nmatrimony do begin wi\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cDearly beloved,\xe2\x80\x9d and ends wi\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cAmazement,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nthe prayer-book says. But what could I do, naibour Springrove? \xe2\x80\x98Twas\r\nordained to be. Well do I call to mind what your poor lady said to me\r\nwhen I had just married. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Mr. Crickett,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, \xe2\x80\x9cyour wife will\r\nsoon settle you as she did her other two: here\xe2\x80\x99s a glass o\xe2\x80\x99 rum, for\r\nI shan\xe2\x80\x99t see your poor face this time next year.\xe2\x80\x9d I swallered the rum,\r\ncalled again next year, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Springrove, you gave me a glass\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 rum last year because I was going to die--here I be alive still, you\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWell said, clerk! Here\xe2\x80\x99s two glasses for you now, then,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nshe. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, mem,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, and swallered the rum. Well, dang my old\r\nsides, next year I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d call again and get three. And call I did.\r\nBut she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give me a drop o\xe2\x80\x99 the commonest. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, clerk,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nshe, \xe2\x80\x9cyou be too tough for a woman\xe2\x80\x99s pity.\xe2\x80\x9d... Ah, poor soul, \xe2\x80\x98twas true\r\nenough! Here be I, that was expected to die, alive and hard as a nail,\r\nyou see, and there\xe2\x80\x99s she moulderen in her grave.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I used to think \xe2\x80\x98twas your wife\xe2\x80\x99s fate not to have a liven husband when\r\nI zid \xe2\x80\x98em die off so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fate? Bless thy simplicity, so \xe2\x80\x98twas her fate; but she struggled to\r\nhave one, and would, and did. Fate\xe2\x80\x99s nothen beside a woman\xe2\x80\x99s schemen!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose, then, that Fate is a He, like us, and the Lord, and the rest\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98em up above there,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gad, lifting his eyes to the sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hullo! Here\xe2\x80\x99s the young woman comen that we were a-talken about\r\nby-now,\xe2\x80\x99 said a grinder, suddenly interrupting. \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s comen up here, as\r\nI be alive!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe two grinders stood and regarded Cytherea as if she had been a ship\r\ntacking into a harbour, nearly stopping the mill in their new interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stylish accoutrements about the head and shoulders, to my thinken,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the clerk. \xe2\x80\x98Sheenen curls, and plenty o\xe2\x80\x99 em.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If there\xe2\x80\x99s one kind of pride more excusable than another in a young\r\nwoman, \xe2\x80\x98tis being proud of her hair,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Springrove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear man!--the pride there is only a small piece o\xe2\x80\x99 the whole. I\r\nwarrant now, though she can show such a figure, she ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t a stick o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfurniture to call her own.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, Clerk Crickett, let the maid be a maid while she is a maid,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nFarmer Springrove chivalrously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the servant of the Church; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothen to say against\r\nit--O no:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThe chimney-sweeper\xe2\x80\x99s daughter Sue\r\n         As I have heard declare, O,\r\n       Although she\xe2\x80\x99s neither sock nor shoe\r\n         Will curl and deck her hair, O.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea was rather disconcerted at finding that the gradual cessation\r\nof the chopping of the mill was on her account, and still more when she\r\nsaw all the cider-makers\xe2\x80\x99 eyes fixed upon her except Mr. Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwhose natural delicacy restrained him. She neared the plot of grass, but\r\ninstead of advancing further, hesitated on its border.\r\n\r\nMr. Springrove perceived her embarrassment, which was relieved when she\r\nsaw his old-established figure coming across to her, wiping his hands in\r\nhis apron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know your errand, missie,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and am glad to see you, and\r\nattend to it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll step indoors.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you are busy I am in no hurry for a minute or two,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then if so be you really wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind, we\xe2\x80\x99ll wring down this last\r\nfilling to let it drain all night?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all. I like to see you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are only just grinding down the early pickthongs and griffins,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncontinued the farmer, in a half-apologetic tone for detaining by\r\nhis cider-making any well-dressed woman. \xe2\x80\x98They rot as black as a\r\nchimney-crook if we keep \xe2\x80\x98em till the regulars turn in.\xe2\x80\x99 As he spoke he\r\nwent back to the press, Cytherea keeping at his elbow. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m later than\r\nI should have been by rights,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, taking up a lever for\r\npropelling the screw, and beckoning to the men to come forward.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The truth is, my son Edward had promised to come to-day, and I made\r\npreparations; but instead of him comes a letter: \xe2\x80\x9cLondon, September the\r\neighteenth, Dear Father,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, and went on to tell me he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nIt threw me out a bit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s got a place \xe2\x80\x98a b\xe2\x80\x99lieve?\xe2\x80\x99 said the clerk, drawing near.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, poor mortal fellow, no. He tried for this one here, you know, but\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t manage to get it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the rights o\xe2\x80\x99 the matter, but\r\nwilly-nilly they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have him for steward. Now mates, form in\r\nline.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSpringrove, the clerk, the grinders, and Gad, all ranged themselves\r\nbehind the lever of the screw, and walked round like soldiers wheeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The man that the old quean hev got is a man you can hardly get upon\r\nyour tongue to gainsay, by the look o\xe2\x80\x99 en,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Clerk Crickett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One o\xe2\x80\x99 them people that can contrive to be thought no worse o\xe2\x80\x99 for\r\nstealen a horse than another man for looken over hedge at en,\xe2\x80\x99 said a\r\ngrinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s all there as steward, and is quite the gentleman--no doubt\r\nabout that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So would my Ted ha\xe2\x80\x99 been, for the matter o\xe2\x80\x99 that,\xe2\x80\x99 the farmer said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s true: \xe2\x80\x98a would, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I said, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give Ted a good education if it do cost me my eyes, and I\r\nwould have done it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, that you would so,\xe2\x80\x99 said the chorus of assistants solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But he took to books and drawing naturally, and cost very little;\r\nand as a wind-up the womenfolk hatched up a match between him and his\r\ncousin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When\xe2\x80\x99s the wedden to be, Mr. Springrove?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Uncertain--but soon, I suppose. Edward, you see, can do anything pretty\r\nnearly, and yet can\xe2\x80\x99t get a straightforward living. I wish sometimes I\r\nhad kept him here, and let professions go. But he was such a one for the\r\npencil.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe dropped the lever in the hedge, and turned to his visitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now then, missie, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll come indoors, please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGad Weedy looked with a placid criticism at Cytherea as she withdrew\r\nwith the farmer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could tell by the tongue o\xe2\x80\x99 her that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t take her degrees in\r\nour county,\xe2\x80\x99 he said in an undertone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The railways have left you lonely here,\xe2\x80\x99 she observed, when they were\r\nindoors.\r\n\r\nSave the withered old flies, which were quite tame from the solitude,\r\nnot a being was in the house. Nobody seemed to have entered it since the\r\nlast passenger had been called out to mount the last stage-coach that\r\nhad run by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, the Inn and I seem almost a pair of fossils,\xe2\x80\x99 the farmer replied,\r\nlooking at the room and then at himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, Mr. Springrove,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, suddenly recollecting herself; \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nmuch obliged to you for recommending me to Miss Aldclyffe.\xe2\x80\x99 She began to\r\nwarm towards the old man; there was in him a gentleness of disposition\r\nwhich reminded her of her own father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Recommending? Not at all, miss. Ted--that\xe2\x80\x99s my son--Ted said a\r\nfellow-draughtsman of his had a sister who wanted to be doing something\r\nin the world, and I mentioned it to the housekeeper, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Ay, I\r\nmiss my son very much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe kept her back to the window that he might not see her rising colour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, \xe2\x80\x98sometimes I can\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling uneasy about him.\r\nYou know, he seems not made for a town life exactly: he gets very queer\r\nover it sometimes, I think. Perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99ll be better when he\xe2\x80\x99s married to\r\nAdelaide.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA half-impatient feeling arose in her, like that which possesses a\r\nsick person when he hears a recently-struck hour struck again by a slow\r\nclock. She had lived further on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everything depends upon whether he loves her,\xe2\x80\x99 she said tremulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He used to--he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show it so much now; but that\xe2\x80\x99s because he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nolder. You see, it was several years ago they first walked together as\r\nyoung man and young woman. She\xe2\x80\x99s altered too from what she was when he\r\nfirst courted her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, she\xe2\x80\x99s more sensible by half. When he used to write to her she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncreep up the lane and look back over her shoulder, and slide out the\r\nletter, and read a word and stand in thought looking at the hills and\r\nseeing none. Then the cuckoo would cry--away the letter would slip, and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d start wi\xe2\x80\x99 fright at the mere bird, and have a red skin before the\r\nquickest man among ye could say, \xe2\x80\x9cBlood rush up.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe came forward with the money and dropped it into her hand. His\r\nthoughts were still with Edward, and he absently took her little fingers\r\nin his as he said, earnestly and ingenuously--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis so seldom I get a gentlewoman to speak to that I can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nspeaking to you, Miss Graye, on my fears for Edward; I sometimes am\r\nafraid that he\xe2\x80\x99ll never get on--that he\xe2\x80\x99ll die poor and despised under\r\nthe worst mental conditions, a keen sense of having been passed in the\r\nrace by men whose brains are nothing to his own, all through his seeing\r\ntoo far into things--being discontented with make-shifts--thinking o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nperfection in things, and then sickened that there\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as\r\nperfection. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be sorry to see him marry, since it may settle him\r\ndown and do him good.... Ay, we\xe2\x80\x99ll hope for the best.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe let go her hand and accompanied her to the door saying, \xe2\x80\x98If you\r\nshould care to walk this way and talk to an old man once now and then,\r\nit will be a great delight to him, Miss Graye. Good-evening to ye.... Ah\r\nlook! a thunderstorm is brewing--be quick home. Or shall I step up with\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, thank you, Mr. Springrove. Good evening,\xe2\x80\x99 she said in a low voice,\r\nand hurried away. One thought still possessed her; Edward had trifled\r\nwith her love.\r\n\r\n4. FIVE TO SIX P.M.\r\n\r\nShe followed the road into a bower of trees, overhanging it so densely\r\nthat the pass appeared like a rabbit\xe2\x80\x99s burrow, and presently reached a\r\nside entrance to the park. The clouds rose more rapidly than the\r\nfarmer had anticipated: the sheep moved in a trail, and complained\r\nincoherently. Livid grey shades, like those of the modern French\r\npainters, made a mystery of the remote and dark parts of the vista, and\r\nseemed to insist upon a suspension of breath. Before she was half-way\r\nacross the park the thunder rumbled distinctly.\r\n\r\nThe direction in which she had to go would take her close by the old\r\nmanor-house. The air was perfectly still, and between each low rumble of\r\nthe thunder behind she could hear the roar of the waterfall before her,\r\nand the creak of the engine among the bushes hard by it. Hurrying on,\r\nwith a growing dread of the gloom and of the approaching storm, she drew\r\nnear the Old House, now rising before her against the dark foliage and\r\nsky in tones of strange whiteness.\r\n\r\nOn the flight of steps, which descended from a terrace in front to the\r\nlevel of the park, stood a man. He appeared, partly from the relief the\r\nposition gave to his figure, and partly from fact, to be of towering\r\nheight. He was dark in outline, and was looking at the sky, with his\r\nhands behind him.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary for Cytherea to pass directly across the line of his\r\nfront. She felt so reluctant to do this, that she was about to turn\r\nunder the trees out of the path and enter it again at a point beyond\r\nthe Old House; but he had seen her, and she came on mechanically,\r\nunconsciously averting her face a little, and dropping her glance to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nHer eyes unswervingly lingered along the path until they fell upon\r\nanother path branching in a right line from the path she was pursuing.\r\nIt came from the steps of the Old House. \xe2\x80\x98I am exactly opposite him\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x99 she thought, \xe2\x80\x98and his eyes are going through me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA clear masculine voice said, at the same instant--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you afraid?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe, interpreting his question by her feelings at the moment, assumed\r\nhimself to be the object of fear, if any. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nstammered.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to know that she thought in that sense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of the thunder, I mean,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98not of myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe must turn to him now. \xe2\x80\x98I think it is going to rain,\xe2\x80\x99 she remarked\r\nfor the sake of saying something.\r\n\r\nHe could not conceal his surprise and admiration of her face and\r\nbearing. He said courteously, \xe2\x80\x98It may possibly not rain before you reach\r\nthe House, if you are going there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I am,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May I walk up with you? It is lonely under the trees.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99 Fearing his courtesy arose from a belief that he was addressing a\r\nwoman of higher station than was hers, she added, \xe2\x80\x98I am Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompanion. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the loneliness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s companion. Then will you be kind enough to take a\r\nsubscription to her? She sent to me this afternoon to ask me to become\r\na subscriber to her Society, and I was out. Of course I\xe2\x80\x99ll subscribe if\r\nshe wishes it. I take a great interest in the Society.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Aldclyffe will be glad to hear that, I know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; let me see--what Society did she say it was? I am afraid I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nenough money in my pocket, and yet it would be a satisfaction to her to\r\nhave practical proof of my willingness. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get it, and be out in one\r\nminute.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe entered the house and was at her side again within the time he had\r\nnamed. \xe2\x80\x98This is it,\xe2\x80\x99 he said pleasantly.\r\n\r\nShe held up her hand. The soft tips of his fingers brushed the palm of\r\nher glove as he placed the money within it. She wondered why his fingers\r\nshould have touched her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think after all,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, \xe2\x80\x98that the rain is upon us, and will\r\ndrench you before you reach the House. Yes: see there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe pointed to a round wet spot as large as a nasturtium leaf, which had\r\nsuddenly appeared upon the white surface of the step.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better come into the porch. It is not nearly night yet. The\r\nclouds make it seem later than it really is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHeavy drops of rain, followed immediately by a forked flash of lightning\r\nand sharp rattling thunder compelled her, willingly or no, to accept\r\nhis invitation. She ascended the steps, stood beside him just within the\r\nporch, and for the first time obtained a series of short views of his\r\nperson, as they waited there in silence.\r\n\r\nHe was an extremely handsome man, well-formed, and well-dressed, of an\r\nage which seemed to be two or three years less than thirty. The\r\nmost striking point in his appearance was the wonderful, almost\r\npreternatural, clearness of his complexion. There was not a blemish or\r\nspeck of any kind to mar the smoothness of its surface or the beauty of\r\nits hue. Next, his forehead was square and broad, his brows straight\r\nand firm, his eyes penetrating and clear. By collecting the round of\r\nexpressions they gave forth, a person who theorized on such matters\r\nwould have imbibed the notion that their owner was of a nature to kick\r\nagainst the pricks; the last man in the world to put up with a position\r\nbecause it seemed to be his destiny to do so; one who took upon himself\r\nto resist fate with the vindictive determination of a Theomachist.\r\nEyes and forehead both would have expressed keenness of intellect too\r\nseverely to be pleasing, had their force not been counteracted by the\r\nlines and tone of the lips. These were full and luscious to a surprising\r\ndegree, possessing a woman-like softness of curve, and a ruby redness\r\nso intense, as to testify strongly to much susceptibility of heart where\r\nfeminine beauty was concerned--a susceptibility that might require\r\nall the ballast of brain with which he had previously been credited to\r\nconfine within reasonable channels.\r\n\r\nHis manner was rather elegant than good: his speech well-finished and\r\nunconstrained.\r\n\r\nThe pause in their discourse, which had been caused by the peal of\r\nthunder was unbroken by either for a minute or two, during which\r\nthe ears of both seemed to be absently following the low roar of the\r\nwaterfall as it became gradually rivalled by the increasing rush of rain\r\nupon the trees and herbage of the grove. After her short looks at him,\r\nCytherea had turned her head towards the avenue for a while, and now,\r\nglancing back again for an instant, she discovered that his eyes were\r\nengaged in a steady, though delicate, regard of her face and form.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, by reason of the narrowness of the porch, their dresses\r\ntouched, and remained in contact.\r\n\r\nHis clothes are something exterior to every man; but to a woman\r\nher dress is part of her body. Its motions are all present to her\r\nintelligence if not to her eyes; no man knows how his coat-tails swing.\r\nBy the slightest hyperbole it may be said that her dress has sensation.\r\nCrease but the very Ultima Thule of fringe or flounce, and it hurts her\r\nas much as pinching her. Delicate antennae, or feelers, bristle on every\r\noutlying frill. Go to the uppermost: she is there; tread on the lowest:\r\nthe fair creature is there almost before you.\r\n\r\nThus the touch of clothes, which was nothing to Manston, sent a thrill\r\nthrough Cytherea, seeing, moreover, that he was of the nature of a\r\nmysterious stranger. She looked out again at the storm, but still felt\r\nhim. At last to escape the sensation she moved away, though by so doing\r\nit was necessary to advance a little into the rain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look, the rain is coming into the porch upon you,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Step\r\ninside the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perfectly safe, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, laughing, and holding the door\r\nopen. \xe2\x80\x98You shall see what a state of disorganization I am in--boxes on\r\nboxes, furniture, straw, crockery, in every form of transposition. An\r\nold woman is in the back quarters somewhere, beginning to put things to\r\nrights.... You know the inside of the house, I dare say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have never been in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O well, come along. Here, you see, they have made a door through, here,\r\nthey have put a partition dividing the old hall into two, one part is\r\nnow my parlour; there they have put a plaster ceiling, hiding the old\r\nchestnut-carved roof because it was too high and would have been chilly\r\nfor me; you see, being the original hall, it was open right up to the\r\ntop, and here the lord of the manor and his retainers used to meet and\r\nbe merry by the light from the monstrous fire which shone out from\r\nthat monstrous fire-place, now narrowed to a mere nothing for my grate,\r\nthough you can see the old outline still. I almost wish I could have had\r\nit in its original state.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With more romance and less comfort.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, exactly. Well, perhaps the wish is not deep-seated. You will see\r\nhow the things are tumbled in anyhow, packing-cases and all. The only\r\npiece of ornamental furniture yet unpacked is this one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An organ?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, an organ. I made it myself, except the pipes. I opened the case\r\nthis afternoon to commence soothing myself at once. It is not a very\r\nlarge one, but quite big enough for a private house. You play, I dare\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The piano. I am not at all used to an organ.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You would soon acquire the touch for an organ, though it would spoil\r\nyour touch for the piano. Not that that matters a great deal. A piano\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t much as an instrument.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is the fashion to say so now. I think it is quite good enough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That isn\xe2\x80\x99t altogether a right sentiment about things being good\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--no. What I mean is, that the men who despise pianos do it as a rule\r\nfrom their teeth, merely for fashion\xe2\x80\x99s sake, because cleverer men have\r\nsaid it before them--not from the experience of their ears.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow Cytherea all at once broke into a blush at the consciousness of a\r\ngreat snub she had been guilty of in her eagerness to explain herself.\r\nHe charitably expressed by a look that he did not in the least mind her\r\nblunder, if it were one; and this attitude forced him into a position of\r\nmental superiority which vexed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I play for my private amusement only,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98I have never learned\r\nscientifically. All I know is what I taught myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe thunder, lightning, and rain had now increased to a terrific\r\nforce. The clouds, from which darts, forks, zigzags, and balls of fire\r\ncontinually sprang, did not appear to be more than a hundred yards above\r\ntheir heads, and every now and then a flash and a peal made gaps in the\r\nsteward\xe2\x80\x99s descriptions. He went towards the organ, in the midst of a\r\nvolley which seemed to shake the aged house from foundations to chimney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are not going to play now, are you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes. Why not now?\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t go home, and therefore we may\r\nas well be amused, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind sitting on this box. The few chairs\r\nI have unpacked are in the other room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to see whether she sat down or not, he turned to the\r\norgan and began extemporizing a harmony which meandered through every\r\nvariety of expression of which the instrument was capable. Presently he\r\nceased and began searching for some music-book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a splendid flash!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, as the lightning again shone in\r\nthrough the mullioned window, which, of a proportion to suit the whole\r\nextent of the original hall, was much too large for the present room.\r\nThe thunder pealed again. Cytherea, in spite of herself, was frightened,\r\nnot only at the weather, but at the general unearthly weirdness which\r\nseemed to surround her there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I--the lightning wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so bright. Do you think it will last\r\nlong?\xe2\x80\x99 she said timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It can\xe2\x80\x99t last much longer,\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured, without turning, running\r\nhis fingers again over the keys. \xe2\x80\x98But this is nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued,\r\nsuddenly stopping and regarding her. \xe2\x80\x98It seems brighter because of\r\nthe deep shadow under those trees yonder. Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it; now look at\r\nme--look in my face--now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had faced the window, looking fixedly at the sky with his dark strong\r\neyes. She seemed compelled to do as she was bidden, and looked in the\r\ntoo-delicately beautiful face.\r\n\r\nThe flash came; but he did not turn or blink, keeping his eyes fixed as\r\nfirmly as before. \xe2\x80\x98There,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, turning to her, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s the way to\r\nlook at lightning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, it might have blinded you!\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense--not lightning of this sort--I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have stared at it\r\nif there had been danger. It is only sheet-lightning now. Now, will you\r\nhave another piece? Something from an oratorio this time?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, thank you--I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear it whilst it thunders so.\xe2\x80\x99 But he\r\nhad begun without heeding her answer, and she stood motionless again,\r\nmarvelling at the wonderful indifference to all external circumstance\r\nwhich was now evinced by his complete absorption in the music before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why do you play such saddening chords?\xe2\x80\x99 she said, when he next paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98H\xe2\x80\x99m--because I like them, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said he lightly. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you like\r\nsad impressions sometimes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sometimes, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When you are full of trouble.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I when I am full of trouble?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you troubled?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am troubled.\xe2\x80\x99 He said this thoughtfully and abruptly--so abruptly\r\nthat she did not push the dialogue further.\r\n\r\nHe now played more powerfully. Cytherea had never heard music in the\r\ncompleteness of full orchestral power, and the tones of the organ, which\r\nreverberated with considerable effect in the comparatively small space\r\nof the room, heightened by the elemental strife of light and sound\r\noutside, moved her to a degree out of proportion to the actual power\r\nof the mere notes, practised as was the hand that produced them.\r\nThe varying strains--now loud, now soft; simple, complicated, weird,\r\ntouching, grand, boisterous, subdued; each phase distinct, yet\r\nmodulating into the next with a graceful and easy flow--shook and bent\r\nher to themselves, as a gushing brook shakes and bends a shadow cast\r\nacross its surface. The power of the music did not show itself so much\r\nby attracting her attention to the subject of the piece, as by taking\r\nup and developing as its libretto the poem of her own life and soul,\r\nshifting her deeds and intentions from the hands of her judgment and\r\nholding them in its own.\r\n\r\nShe was swayed into emotional opinions concerning the strange man before\r\nher; new impulses of thought came with new harmonies, and entered into\r\nher with a gnawing thrill. A dreadful flash of lightning then, and the\r\nthunder close upon it. She found herself involuntarily shrinking up\r\nbeside him, and looking with parted lips at his face.\r\n\r\nHe turned his eyes and saw her emotion, which greatly increased the\r\nideal element in her expressive face. She was in the state in which\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s instinct to conceal has lost its power over her impulse to tell;\r\nand he saw it. Bending his handsome face over her till his lips almost\r\ntouched her ear, he murmured, without breaking the harmonies--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you very much like this piece?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very much indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could see you were affected by it. I will copy it for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will bring it to the House to you to-morrow. Who shall I ask for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, not for me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t bring it,\xe2\x80\x99 she said hastily. \xe2\x80\x98I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like you\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me see--to-morrow evening at seven or a few minutes past I shall be\r\npassing the waterfall on my way home. I could conveniently give it you\r\nthere, and I should like you to have it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe modulated into the Pastoral Symphony, still looking in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, to get rid of the look.\r\n\r\nThe storm had by this time considerably decreased in violence, and in\r\nseven or ten minutes the sky partially cleared, the clouds around the\r\nwestern horizon becoming lighted up with the rays of the sinking sun.\r\n\r\nCytherea drew a long breath of relief, and prepared to go away. She was\r\nfull of a distressing sense that her detention in the old manor-house,\r\nand the acquaintanceship it had set on foot, was not a thing she wished.\r\nIt was such a foolish thing to have been excited and dragged into\r\nfrankness by the wiles of a stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Allow me to come with you,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, accompanying her to the door, and\r\nagain showing by his behaviour how much he was impressed with her. His\r\ninfluence over her had vanished with the musical chords, and she turned\r\nher back upon him. \xe2\x80\x98May I come?\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no. The distance is not a quarter of a mile--it is really not\r\nnecessary, thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 she said quietly. And wishing him good-evening,\r\nwithout meeting his eyes, she went down the steps, leaving him standing\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, how is it that man has so fascinated me?\xe2\x80\x99 was all she could think.\r\nHer own self, as she had sat spell-bound before him, was all she could\r\nsee. Her gait was constrained, from the knowledge that his eyes were\r\nupon her until she had passed the hollow by the waterfall, and by\r\nascending the rise had become hidden from his view by the boughs of the\r\noverhanging trees.\r\n\r\n5. SIX TO SEVEN P.M.\r\n\r\nThe wet shining road threw the western glare into her eyes with an\r\ninvidious lustre which rendered the restlessness of her mood more\r\nwearying. Her thoughts flew from idea to idea without asking for the\r\nslightest link of connection between one and another. One moment she\r\nwas full of the wild music and stirring scene with Manston---the next,\r\nEdward\xe2\x80\x99s image rose before her like a shadowy ghost. Then Manston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblack eyes seemed piercing her again, and the reckless voluptuous mouth\r\nappeared bending to the curves of his special words. What could be those\r\ntroubles to which he had alluded? Perhaps Miss Aldclyffe was at the\r\nbottom of them. Sad at heart she paced on: her life was bewildering her.\r\n\r\nOn coming into Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s presence Cytherea told her of the\r\nincident, not without a fear that she would burst into one of her\r\nungovernable fits of temper at learning Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s slight departure\r\nfrom the programme. But, strangely to Cytherea, Miss Aldclyffe looked\r\ndelighted. The usual cross-examination followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so you were with him all that time?\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady, with assumed\r\nseverity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not tell you to call at the Old House twice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t call, as I have said. He made me come into the porch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What remarks did he make, do you say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That the lightning was not so bad as I thought.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A very important remark, that. Did he--\xe2\x80\x99 she turned her glance full\r\nupon the girl, and eyeing her searchingly, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did he say anything about _me_?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, returning her gaze calmly, \xe2\x80\x98except that I was\r\nto give you the subscription.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are quite sure?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe you. Did he say anything striking or strange about himself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only one thing--that he was troubled,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Troubled!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter saying the word, Miss Aldclyffe relapsed into silence. Such\r\nbehaviour as this had ended, on most previous occasions, by her making\r\na confession, and Cytherea expected one now. But for once she was\r\nmistaken, nothing more was said.\r\n\r\nWhen she had returned to her room she sat down and penned a farewell\r\nletter to Edward Springrove, as little able as any other excitable\r\nand brimming young woman of nineteen to feel that the wisest and only\r\ndignified course at that juncture was to do nothing at all. She told\r\nhim that, to her painful surprise, she had learnt that his engagement\r\nto another woman was a matter of notoriety. She insisted that all honour\r\nbade him marry his early love--a woman far better than her unworthy\r\nself, who only deserved to be forgotten, and begged him to remember\r\nthat he was not to see her face again. She upbraided him for levity\r\nand cruelty in meeting her so frequently at Budmouth, and above all\r\nin stealing the kiss from her lips on the last evening of the water\r\nexcursions. \xe2\x80\x98I never, never can forget it!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, and then felt a\r\nsensation of having done her duty, ostensibly persuading herself that\r\nher reproaches and commands were of such a force that no man to whom\r\nthey were uttered could ever approach her more.\r\n\r\nYet it was all unconsciously said in words which betrayed a lingering\r\ntenderness of love at every unguarded turn. Like Beatrice accusing\r\nDante from the chariot, try as she might to play the superior being\r\nwho contemned such mere eye-sensuousness, she betrayed at every point\r\na pretty woman\xe2\x80\x99s jealousy of a rival, and covertly gave her old lover\r\nhints for excusing himself at each fresh indictment.\r\n\r\nThis done, Cytherea, still in a practical mood, upbraided herself with\r\nweakness in allowing a stranger like Mr. Manston to influence her as he\r\nhad done that evening. What right on earth had he to suggest so suddenly\r\nthat she might meet him at the waterfall to receive his music? She would\r\nhave given much to be able to annihilate the ascendency he had obtained\r\nover her during that extraordinary interval of melodious sound. Not\r\nbeing able to endure the notion of his living a minute longer in the\r\nbelief he was then holding, she took her pen and wrote to him also:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                      \xe2\x80\x98KNAPWATER HOUSE\r\n                         September 20th.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x98I find I cannot meet you at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock by the waterfall as I\r\n  promised. The emotion I felt made me forgetful of realities.\r\n\r\n                          \xe2\x80\x98C. GRAYE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nA great statesman thinks several times, and acts; a young lady acts,\r\nand thinks several times. When, a few minutes later, she saw the postman\r\ncarry off the bag containing one of the letters, and a messenger with\r\nthe other, she, for the first time, asked herself the question whether\r\nshe had acted very wisely in writing to either of the two men who had so\r\ninfluenced her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. THE EVENTS OF TEN WEEKS\r\n\r\n1. FROM SEPTEMBER THE TWENTY-FIRST TO THE MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER\r\n\r\nThe foremost figure within Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s horizon, exclusive of the inmates\r\nof Knapwater House, was now the steward, Mr. Manston. It was impossible\r\nthat they should live within a quarter of a mile of each other, be\r\nengaged in the same service, and attend the same church, without meeting\r\nat some spot or another, twice or thrice a week. On Sundays, in her\r\npew, when by chance she turned her head, Cytherea found his eyes waiting\r\ndesirously for a glimpse of hers, and, at first more strangely, the eyes\r\nof Miss Aldclyffe furtively resting on him. On coming out of church he\r\nfrequently walked beside Cytherea till she reached the gate at\r\nwhich residents in the House turned into the shrubbery. By degrees a\r\nconjecture grew to a certainty. She knew that he loved her.\r\n\r\nBut a strange fact was connected with the development of his love. He\r\nwas palpably making the strongest efforts to subdue, or at least to\r\nhide, the weakness, and as it sometimes seemed, rather from his own\r\nconscience than from surrounding eyes. Hence she found that not one\r\nof his encounters with her was anything more than the result of pure\r\naccident. He made no advances whatever: without avoiding her, he never\r\nsought her: the words he had whispered at their first interview now\r\nproved themselves to be quite as much the result of unguarded impulse as\r\nwas her answer. Something held him back, bound his impulse down, but\r\nshe saw that it was neither pride of his person, nor fear that she would\r\nrefuse him--a course she unhesitatingly resolved to take should he think\r\nfit to declare himself. She was interested in him and his marvellous\r\nbeauty, as she might have been in some fascinating panther or\r\nleopard--for some undefinable reason she shrank from him, even whilst\r\nshe admired. The keynote of her nature, a warm \xe2\x80\x98precipitance of soul,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nas Coleridge happily writes it, which Manston had so directly pounced\r\nupon at their very first interview, gave her now a tremulous sense of\r\nbeing in some way in his power.\r\n\r\nThe state of mind was, on the whole, a dangerous one for a young and\r\ninexperienced woman; and perhaps the circumstance which, more than any\r\nother, led her to cherish Edward\xe2\x80\x99s image now, was that he had taken no\r\nnotice of the receipt of her letter, stating that she discarded him. It\r\nwas plain then, she said, that he did not care deeply for her, and she\r\nthereupon could not quite leave off caring deeply for him:--\r\n\r\n                  \xe2\x80\x98Ingenium mulierum,\r\n              Nolunt ubi velis, ubi nolis cupiunt ultro.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe month of October passed, and November began its course. The\r\ninhabitants of the village of Carriford grew weary of supposing that\r\nMiss Aldclyffe was going to marry her steward. New whispers arose and\r\nbecame very distinct (though they did not reach Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s ears)\r\nto the effect that the steward was deeply in love with Cytherea Graye.\r\nIndeed, the fact became so obvious that there was nothing left to\r\nsay about it except that their marriage would be an excellent one for\r\nboth;--for her in point of comfort--and for him in point of love.\r\n\r\nAs circles in a pond grow wider and wider, the next fact, which at first\r\nhad been patent only to Cytherea herself, in due time spread to her\r\nneighbours, and they, too, wondered that he made no overt advances. By\r\nthe middle of November, a theory made up of a combination of the other\r\ntwo was received with general favour: its substance being that a guilty\r\nintrigue had been commenced between Manston and Miss Aldclyffe, some\r\nyears before, when he was a very young man, and she still in the\r\nenjoyment of some womanly beauty, but now that her seniority began\r\nto grow emphatic she was becoming distasteful to him. His fear of the\r\neffect of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s jealousy would, they said, thus lead him to conceal\r\nfrom her his new attachment to Cytherea. Almost the only woman who did\r\nnot believe this was Cytherea herself, on unmistakable grounds, which\r\nwere hidden from all besides. It was not only in public, but even more\r\nmarkedly in secluded places, on occasions when gallantry would have been\r\nsafe from all discovery, that this guarded course of action was pursued,\r\nall the strength of a consuming passion burning in his eyes the while.\r\n\r\n2. NOVEMBER THE EIGHTEENTH\r\n\r\nIt was on a Friday in this month of November that Owen Graye paid a\r\nvisit to his sister.\r\n\r\nHis zealous integrity still retained for him the situation at Budmouth,\r\nand in order that there should be as little interruption as possible to\r\nhis duties there, he had decided not to come to Knapwater till late in\r\nthe afternoon, and to return to Budmouth by the first train the next\r\nmorning, Miss Aldclyffe having made a point of frequently offering him\r\nlodging for an unlimited period, to the great pleasure of Cytherea.\r\n\r\nHe reached the house about four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and ringing the bell, asked of\r\nthe page who answered it for Miss Graye.\r\n\r\nWhen Graye spoke the name of his sister, Manston, who was just coming\r\nout from an interview with Miss Aldclyffe, passed him in the vestibule\r\nand heard the question. The steward\xe2\x80\x99s face grew hot, and he secretly\r\nclenched his hands. He half crossed the court, then turned his head and\r\nsaw that the lad still stood at the door, though Owen had been shown\r\ninto the house. Manston went back to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who was that man?\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has he ever been here before?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How many times?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Three.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t know him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think he is Miss Graye\xe2\x80\x99s brother, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, why the devil didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say so before!\xe2\x80\x99 Manston exclaimed, and\r\nagain went on his way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course, that was not the man of my dreams--of course, it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe!\xe2\x80\x99 he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x98That I should be such a fool--such an utter\r\nfool. Good God! to allow a girl to influence me like this, day after\r\nday, till I am jealous of her very brother. A lady\xe2\x80\x99s dependent, a waif,\r\na helpless thing entirely at the mercy of the world; yes, curse it; that\r\nis just why it is; that fact of her being so helpless against the blows\r\nof circumstances which renders her so deliciously sweet!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe paused opposite his house. Should he get his horse saddled? No.\r\n\r\nHe went down the drive and out of the park, having started to proceed to\r\nan outlying spot on the estate concerning some draining, and to call at\r\nthe potter\xe2\x80\x99s yard to make an arrangement for the supply of pipes. But a\r\nremark which Miss Aldclyffe had dropped in relation to Cytherea was\r\nwhat still occupied his mind, and had been the immediate cause of his\r\nexcitement at the sight of her brother. Miss Aldclyffe had meaningly\r\nremarked during their intercourse, that Cytherea was wildly in love with\r\nEdward Springrove, in spite of his engagement to his cousin Adelaide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How I am harassed!\xe2\x80\x99 he said aloud, after deep thought for half-an-hour,\r\nwhile still continuing his walk with the greatest vehemence. \xe2\x80\x98How I am\r\nharassed by these emotions of mine!\xe2\x80\x99 He calmed himself by an effort.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, duty after all it shall be, as nearly as I can effect it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonesty is the best policy;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 with which vigorously uttered resolve\r\nhe once more attempted to turn his attention to the prosy object of his\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThe evening had closed in to a dark and dreary night when the steward\r\ncame from the potter\xe2\x80\x99s door to proceed homewards again. The gloom did\r\nnot tend to raise his spirits, and in the total lack of objects to\r\nattract his eye, he soon fell to introspection as before. It was along\r\nthe margin of turnip fields that his path lay, and the large leaves of\r\nthe crop struck flatly against his feet at every step, pouring upon them\r\nthe rolling drops of moisture gathered upon their broad surfaces; but\r\nthe annoyance was unheeded. Next reaching a fir plantation, he mounted\r\nthe stile and followed the path into the midst of the darkness produced\r\nby the overhanging trees.\r\n\r\nAfter walking under the dense shade of the inky boughs for a few\r\nminutes, he fancied he had mistaken the path, which as yet was scarcely\r\nfamiliar to him. This was proved directly afterwards by his coming\r\nat right angles upon some obstruction, which careful feeling with\r\noutstretched hands soon told him to be a rail fence. However, as the\r\nwood was not large, he experienced no alarm about finding the path\r\nagain, and with some sense of pleasure halted awhile against the rails,\r\nto listen to the intensely melancholy yet musical wail of the fir-tops,\r\nand as the wind passed on, the prompt moan of an adjacent plantation in\r\nreply. He could just dimly discern the airy summits of the two or\r\nthree trees nearest him waving restlessly backwards and forwards, and\r\nstretching out their boughs like hairy arms into the dull sky. The\r\nscene, from its striking and emphatic loneliness, began to grow\r\ncongenial to his mood; all of human kind seemed at the antipodes.\r\n\r\nA sudden rattle on his right hand caused him to start from his reverie,\r\nand turn in that direction. There, before him, he saw rise up from among\r\nthe trees a fountain of sparks and smoke, then a red glare of light\r\ncoming forward towards him; then a flashing panorama of illuminated\r\noblong pictures; then the old darkness, more impressive than ever.\r\n\r\nThe surprise, which had owed its origin to his imperfect acquaintance\r\nwith the topographical features of that end of the estate, had been but\r\nmomentary; the disturbance, a well-known one to dwellers by a railway,\r\nbeing caused by the 6.50 down-train passing along a shallow cutting\r\nin the midst of the wood immediately below where he stood, the driver\r\nhaving the fire-door of the engine open at the minute of going by. The\r\ntrain had, when passing him, already considerably slackened speed, and\r\nnow a whistle was heard, announcing that Carriford Road Station was not\r\nfar in its van.\r\n\r\nBut contrary to the natural order of things, the discovery that it\r\nwas only a commonplace train had not caused Manston to stir from his\r\nposition of facing the railway.\r\n\r\nIf the 6.50 down-train had been a flash of forked lightning transfixing\r\nhim to the earth, he could scarcely have remained in a more trance-like\r\nstate. He still leant against the railings, his right hand still\r\ncontinued pressing on his walking-stick, his weight on one foot, his\r\nother heel raised, his eyes wide open towards the blackness of the\r\ncutting. The only movement in him was a slight dropping of the lower\r\njaw, separating his previously closed lips a little way, as when a\r\nstrange conviction rushes home suddenly upon a man. A new surprise, not\r\nnearly so trivial as the first, had taken possession of him.\r\n\r\nIt was on this account. At one of the illuminated windows of a\r\nsecond-class carriage in the series gone by, he had seen a pale face,\r\nreclining upon one hand, the light from the lamp falling full upon it.\r\nThe face was a woman\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nAt last Manston moved; gave a whispering kind of whistle, adjusted his\r\nhat, and walked on again, cross-questioning himself in every direction\r\nas to how a piece of knowledge he had carefully concealed had found its\r\nway to another person\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence. \xe2\x80\x98How can my address have become\r\nknown?\xe2\x80\x99 he said at length, audibly. \xe2\x80\x98Well, it is a blessing I have been\r\ncircumspect and honourable, in relation to that--yes, I will say it, for\r\nonce, even if the words choke me, that darling of mine, Cytherea, never\r\nto be my own, never. I suppose all will come out now. All!\xe2\x80\x99 The great\r\nsadness of his utterance proved that no mean force had been exercised\r\nupon himself to sustain the circumspection he had just claimed.\r\n\r\nHe wheeled to the left, pursued the ditch beside the railway fence, and\r\npresently emerged from the wood, stepping into a road which crossed the\r\nrailway by a bridge.\r\n\r\nAs he neared home, the anxiety lately written in his face, merged by\r\ndegrees into a grimly humorous smile, which hung long upon his lips, and\r\nhe quoted aloud a line from the book of Jeremiah--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98A woman shall compass a man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n3. NOVEMBER THE NINETEENTH. DAYBREAK\r\n\r\nBefore it was light the next morning, two little naked feet pattered\r\nalong the passage in Knapwater House, from which Owen Graye\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom\r\nopened, and a tap was given upon his door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Owen, Owen, are you awake?\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea in a whisper through the\r\nkeyhole. \xe2\x80\x98You must get up directly, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll miss the train.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen he descended to his sister\xe2\x80\x99s little room, he found her there\r\nalready waiting with a cup of cocoa and a grilled rasher on the table\r\nfor him. A hasty meal was despatched in the intervals of putting on his\r\novercoat and finding his hat, and they then went softly through the long\r\ndeserted passages, the kitchen-maid who had prepared their breakfast\r\nwalking before them with a lamp held high above her head, which cast\r\nlong wheeling shadows down corridors intersecting the one they followed,\r\ntheir remoter ends being lost in darkness. The door was unbolted and\r\nthey stepped out.\r\n\r\nOwen had preferred walking to the station to accepting the pony-carriage\r\nwhich Miss Aldclyffe had placed at his disposal, having a morbid horror\r\nof giving trouble to people richer than himself, and especially to their\r\nmen-servants, who looked down upon him as a hybrid monster in social\r\nposition. Cytherea proposed to walk a little way with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want to talk to you as long as I can,\xe2\x80\x99 she said tenderly.\r\n\r\nBrother and sister then emerged by the heavy door into the drive. The\r\nfeeling and aspect of the hour were precisely similar to those under\r\nwhich the steward had left the house the evening previous, excepting\r\nthat apparently unearthly reversal of natural sequence, which is caused\r\nby the world getting lighter instead of darker. \xe2\x80\x98The tearful glimmer of\r\nthe languid dawn\xe2\x80\x99 was just sufficient to reveal to them the melancholy\r\nred leaves, lying thickly in the channels by the roadside, ever and anon\r\nloudly tapped on by heavy drops of water, which the boughs above had\r\ncollected from the foggy air.\r\n\r\nThey passed the Old House, engaged in a deep conversation, and had\r\nproceeded about twenty yards by a cross route, in the direction of the\r\nturnpike road, when the form of a woman emerged from the porch of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nShe was wrapped in a grey waterproof cloak, the hood of which was drawn\r\nover her head and closely round her face--so closely that her eyes were\r\nthe sole features uncovered.\r\n\r\nWith this one exception of her appearance there, the most perfect\r\nstillness and silence pervaded the steward\xe2\x80\x99s residence from basement to\r\nchimney. Not a shutter was open; not a twine of smoke came forth.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the ivy-covered gateway she stood still and listened for two,\r\nor possibly three minutes, till she became conscious of others in the\r\npark. Seeing the pair she stepped back, with the apparent intention\r\nof letting them pass out of sight, and evidently wishing to avoid\r\nobservation. But looking at her watch, and returning it rapidly to her\r\npocket, as if surprised at the lateness of the hour, she hurried out\r\nagain, and across the park by a still more oblique line than that traced\r\nby Owen and his sister.\r\n\r\nThese in the meantime had got into the road, and were walking along it\r\nas the woman came up on the other side of the boundary hedge, looking\r\nfor a gate or stile, by which she, too, might get off the grass upon the\r\nhard ground.\r\n\r\nTheir conversation, of which every word was clear and distinct, in the\r\nstill air of the dawn, to the distance of a quarter of a mile, reached\r\nher ears, and withdrew her attention from all other matters and sights\r\nwhatsoever. Thus arrested she stood for an instant as precisely in the\r\nattitude of Imogen by the cave of Belarius, as if she had studied the\r\nposition from the play. When they had advanced a few steps, she followed\r\nthem in some doubt, still screened by the hedge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you believe in such odd coincidences?\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you mean, believe in them? They occur sometimes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, one will occur often enough--that is, two disconnected events will\r\nfall strangely together by chance, and people scarcely notice the fact\r\nbeyond saying, \xe2\x80\x9cOddly enough it happened that so and so were the same,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and so on. But when three such events coincide without any apparent\r\nreason for the coincidence, it seems as if there must be invisible means\r\nat work. You see, three things falling together in that manner are ten\r\ntimes as singular as two cases of coincidence which are distinct.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, of course: what a mathematical head you have, Cytherea! But I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see so much to marvel at in our case. That the man who kept the\r\npublic-house in which Miss Aldclyffe fainted, and who found out her name\r\nand position, lives in this neighbourhood, is accounted for by the fact\r\nthat she got him the berth to stop his tongue. That you came here was\r\nsimply owing to Springrove.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, but look at this. Miss Aldclyffe is the woman our father first\r\nloved, and I have come to Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s; you can\xe2\x80\x99t get over that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFrom these premises, she proceeded to argue like an elderly divine on\r\nthe designs of Providence which were apparent in such conjunctures, and\r\nwent into a variety of details connected with Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s history.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Had I better tell Miss Aldclyffe that I know all this?\xe2\x80\x99 she inquired at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the use?\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Your possessing the knowledge does no harm;\r\nyou are at any rate comfortable here, and a confession to Miss Aldclyffe\r\nmight only irritate her. No, hold your tongue, Cytherea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fancy I should have been tempted to tell her too,\xe2\x80\x99 Cytherea went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98had I not found out that there exists a very odd, almost imperceptible,\r\nand yet real connection of some kind between her and Mr. Manston, which\r\nis more than that of a mutual interest in the estate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is in love with him!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Owen; \xe2\x80\x98fancy that!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--that\xe2\x80\x99s what everybody says who has been keen enough to notice\r\nanything. I said so at first. And yet now I cannot persuade myself that\r\nshe is in love with him at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t act as if she were. She isn\xe2\x80\x99t--you will know I don\xe2\x80\x99t say it\r\nfrom any vanity, Owen--she isn\xe2\x80\x99t the least jealous of me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps she is in some way in his power.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--she is not. He was openly advertised for, and chosen from forty or\r\nfifty who answered the advertisement, without knowing whose it was. And\r\nsince he has been here, she has certainly done nothing to compromise\r\nherself in any way. Besides, why should she have brought an enemy here\r\nat all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then she must have fallen in love with him. You know as well as I do,\r\nCyth, that with women there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing between the two poles of emotion\r\ntowards an interesting male acquaintance. \xe2\x80\x98Tis either love or aversion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey walked for a few minutes in silence, when Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\naccidentally fell upon her brother\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Owen,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98do you know that there is something unusual in your\r\nmanner of walking?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it like?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t quite say, except that you don\xe2\x80\x99t walk so regularly as you used\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe woman behind the hedge, who had still continued to dog their\r\nfootsteps, made an impatient movement at this change in their\r\nconversation, and looked at her watch again. Yet she seemed reluctant to\r\ngive over listening to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 Owen returned with assumed carelessness, \xe2\x80\x98I do know it. I think\r\nthe cause of it is that mysterious pain which comes just above my ankle\r\nsometimes. You remember the first time I had it? That day we went by\r\nsteam-packet to Lulstead Cove, when it hindered me from coming back to\r\nyou, and compelled me to sleep with the gateman we have been talking\r\nabout.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But is it anything serious, dear Owen?\xe2\x80\x99 Cytherea exclaimed, with some\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, nothing at all. It is sure to go off again. I never find a sign of\r\nit when I sit in the office.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain their unperceived companion made a gesture of vexation, and looked\r\nat her watch as if time were precious. But the dialogue still flowed\r\non upon this new subject, and showed no sign of returning to its old\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\nGathering up her skirt decisively she renounced all further hope, and\r\nhurried along the ditch till she had dropped into a valley, and came to\r\na gate which was beyond the view of those coming behind. This she softly\r\nopened, and came out upon the road, following it in the direction of the\r\nrailway station.\r\n\r\nPresently she heard Owen Graye\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps in her rear, his quickened\r\npace implying that he had parted from his sister. The woman thereupon\r\nincreased her rapid walk to a run, and in a few minutes safely distanced\r\nher fellow-traveller.\r\n\r\nThe railway at Carriford Road consisted only of a single line of rails;\r\nand the short local down-train by which Owen was going to Budmouth was\r\nshunted on to a siding whilst the first up-train passed. Graye entered\r\nthe waiting-room, and the door being open he listlessly observed the\r\nmovements of a woman wearing a long grey cloak, and closely hooded, who\r\nhad asked for a ticket for London.\r\n\r\nHe followed her with his eyes on to the platform, saw her waiting there\r\nand afterwards stepping into the train: his recollection of her ceasing\r\nwith the perception.\r\n\r\n4. EIGHT TO TEN O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK A.M.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crickett, twice a widow, and now the parish clerk\xe2\x80\x99s wife, a\r\nfine-framed, scandal-loving woman, with a peculiar corner to her eye by\r\nwhich, without turning her head, she could see what people were doing\r\nalmost behind her, lived in a cottage standing nearer to the old\r\nmanor-house than any other in the village of Carriford, and she had on\r\nthat account been temporarily engaged by the steward, as a respectable\r\nkind of charwoman and general servant, until a settled arrangement could\r\nbe made with some person as permanent domestic.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, therefore, Mrs. Crickett, immediately she had lighted\r\nthe fire in her own cottage, and prepared the breakfast for herself and\r\nhusband, paced her way to the Old House to do the same for Mr. Manston.\r\nThen she went home to breakfast; and when the steward had eaten his, and\r\nhad gone out on his rounds, she returned again to clear away, make his\r\nbed, and put the house in order for the day.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Owen Graye\xe2\x80\x99s departure, she went through the\r\noperations of her first visit as usual--proceeded home to breakfast, and\r\nwent back again, to perform those of the second.\r\n\r\nEntering Manston\xe2\x80\x99s empty bedroom, with her hands on her hips, she\r\nindifferently cast her eyes upon the bed, previously to dismantling it.\r\n\r\nWhilst she looked, she thought in an inattentive manner, \xe2\x80\x98What a\r\nremarkably quiet sleeper Mr. Manston must be!\xe2\x80\x99 The upper bed-clothes\r\nwere flung back, certainly, but the bed was scarcely disarranged.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anybody would almost fancy,\xe2\x80\x99 she thought, \xe2\x80\x98that he had made it himself\r\nafter rising.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut these evanescent thoughts vanished as they had come, and Mrs.\r\nCrickett set to work; she dragged off the counterpane, blankets and\r\nsheets, and stooped to lift the pillows. Thus stooping, something\r\narrested her attention; she looked closely--more closely--very closely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x99 was all she could say. The clerk\xe2\x80\x99s wife stood as if\r\nthe air had suddenly set to amber, and held her fixed like a fly in it.\r\n\r\nThe object of her wonder was a trailing brown hair, very little less\r\nthan a yard long, which proved it clearly to be a hair from some woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead. She drew it off the pillow, and took it to the window; there\r\nholding it out she looked fixedly at it, and became utterly lost in\r\nmeditation: her gaze, which had at first actively settled on the hair,\r\ninvoluntarily dropped past its object by degrees and was lost on the\r\nfloor, as the inner vision obscured the outer one.\r\n\r\nShe at length moistened her lips, returned her eyes to the hair, wound\r\nit round her fingers, put it in some paper, and secreted the whole in\r\nher pocket. Mrs. Crickett\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts were with her work no more that\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nShe searched the house from roof-tree to cellar, for some other trace of\r\nfeminine existence or appurtenance; but none was to be found.\r\n\r\nShe went out into the yard, coal-hole, stable, hay-loft, green-house,\r\nfowl-house, and piggery, and still there was no sign. Coming in again,\r\nshe saw a bonnet, eagerly pounced upon it; and found it to be her own.\r\n\r\nHastily completing her arrangements in the other rooms, she entered the\r\nvillage again, and called at once on the postmistress, Elizabeth Leat,\r\nan intimate friend of hers, and a female who sported several unique\r\ndiseases and afflictions.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crickett unfolded the paper, took out the hair, and waved it on\r\nhigh before the perplexed eyes of Elizabeth, which immediately mooned\r\nand wandered after it like a cat\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Leat, contracting her eyelids, and stretching\r\nout towards the invisible object a narrow bony hand that would have been\r\nan unmitigated delight to the pencil of Carlo Crivelli.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall hear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Crickett, complacently gathering up the\r\ntreasure into her own fat hand; and the secret was then solemnly\r\nimparted, together with the accident of its discovery.\r\n\r\nA shaving-glass was taken down from a nail, laid on its back in the\r\nmiddle of a table by the window, and the hair spread carefully out upon\r\nit. The pair then bent over the table from opposite sides, their elbows\r\non the edge, their hands supporting their heads, their foreheads nearly\r\ntouching, and their eyes upon the hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He ha\xe2\x80\x99 been mad a\xe2\x80\x99ter my lady Cytherea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Crickett, \xe2\x80\x98and \xe2\x80\x98tis\r\nmy very belief the hair is--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No \xe2\x80\x98tidn\xe2\x80\x99. Hers idn\xe2\x80\x99 so dark as that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elizabeth, you know that as the faithful wife of a servant of the\r\nChurch, I should be glad to think as you do about the girl. Mind I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wish to say anything against Miss Graye, but this I do say, that I\r\nbelieve her to be a nameless thing, and she\xe2\x80\x99s no right to stick a moral\r\nclock in her face, and deceive the country in such a way. If she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nof a bad stock at the outset she was bad in the planten, and if she\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t bad in the planten, she was bad in the growen, and if not in the\r\ngrowen, she\xe2\x80\x99s made bad by what she\xe2\x80\x99s gone through since.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I have another reason for knowing it idn\xe2\x80\x99 hers,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Leat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I know whose it is then--Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s, upon my song!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis the colour of hers, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it to be hers either.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you believe what they d\xe2\x80\x99 say about her and him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say nothen about that; but you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I know about his\r\nletters.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What about \xe2\x80\x98em?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He d\xe2\x80\x99 post all his letters here except those for one person, and they\r\nhe d\xe2\x80\x99 take to Budmouth. My son is in Budmouth Post Office, as you know,\r\nand as he d\xe2\x80\x99 sit at desk he can see over the blind of the window all\r\nthe people who d\xe2\x80\x99 post letters. Mr. Manston d\xe2\x80\x99 unvariably go there wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nletters for that person; my boy d\xe2\x80\x99 know \xe2\x80\x98em by sight well enough now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it a she?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis a she.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s her name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The little stunpoll of a fellow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t call to mind more than that\r\n\xe2\x80\x98tis Miss Somebody, of London. However, that\xe2\x80\x99s the woman who ha\xe2\x80\x99 been\r\nhere, depend upon\xe2\x80\x99t--a wicked one--some poor street-wench escaped from\r\nSodom, I warrant ye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only to find herself in Gomorrah, seemingly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That may be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, Mrs. Leat, this is clear to me. \xe2\x80\x98Tis no miss who came here to\r\nsee our steward last night--whenever she came or wherever she vanished.\r\nDo you think he would ha\xe2\x80\x99 let a miss get here how she could, go away how\r\nshe would, without breakfast or help of any kind?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElizabeth shook her head--Mrs. Crickett looked at her solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say I know she had no help of any kind; I know it was so, for the\r\ngrate was quite cold when I touched it this morning with these fingers,\r\nand he was still in bed. No, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take the trouble to write\r\nletters to a girl and then treat her so off-hand as that. There\xe2\x80\x99s a tie\r\nbetween \xe2\x80\x98em stronger than feelen. She\xe2\x80\x99s his wife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He married! The Lord so \xe2\x80\x98s, what shall we hear next? Do he look married\r\nnow? His are not the abashed eyes and lips of a married man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps she\xe2\x80\x99s a tame one--but she\xe2\x80\x99s his wife still.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no: he\xe2\x80\x99s not a married man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, he is. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had three, and I ought to know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Leat, giving way. \xe2\x80\x98Whatever may be the truth\r\non\xe2\x80\x99t I trust Providence will settle it all for the best, as He always\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay, Elizabeth,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mrs. Crickett with a satirical sigh, as\r\nshe turned on her foot to go home, \xe2\x80\x98good people like you may say so, but\r\nI have always found Providence a different sort of feller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n5. NOVEMBER THE TWENTIETH\r\n\r\nIt was Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s custom, a custom originated by her father, and\r\nnourished by her own exclusiveness, to unlock the post-bag herself every\r\nmorning, instead of allowing the duty to devolve on the butler, as\r\nwas the case in most of the neighbouring county families. The bag was\r\nbrought upstairs each morning to her dressing-room, where she took out\r\nthe contents, mostly in the presence of her maid and Cytherea, who\r\nhad the entree of the chamber at all hours, and attended there in the\r\nmorning at a kind of reception on a small scale, which was held by Miss\r\nAldclyffe of her namesake only.\r\n\r\nHere she read her letters before the glass, whilst undergoing the\r\noperation of being brushed and dressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What woman can this be, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x99 she said on the morning succeeding\r\nthat of the last section. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cLondon, N.!\xe2\x80\x9d It is the first time in my\r\nlife I ever had a letter from that outlandish place, the North side of\r\nLondon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea had just come into her presence to learn if there was anything\r\nfor herself; and on being thus addressed, walked up to Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncorner of the room to look at the curiosity which had raised such an\r\nexclamation. But the lady, having opened the envelope and read a few\r\nlines, put it quickly in her pocket, before Cytherea could reach her\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, \xe2\x80\x98tis nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. She proceeded to make general remarks in\r\na noticeably forced tone of sang-froid, from which she soon lapsed into\r\nsilence. Not another word was said about the letter: she seemed very\r\nanxious to get her dressing done, and the room cleared. Thereupon\r\nCytherea went away to the other window, and a few minutes later left the\r\nroom to follow her own pursuits.\r\n\r\nIt was late when Miss Aldclyffe descended to the breakfast-table and\r\nthen she seemed there to no purpose; tea, coffee, eggs, cutlets, and all\r\ntheir accessories, were left absolutely untasted. The next that was seen\r\nof her was when walking up and down the south terrace, and round the\r\nflower-beds; her face was pale, and her tread was fitful, and she\r\ncrumpled a letter in her hand.\r\n\r\nDinner-time came round as usual; she did not speak ten words, or indeed\r\nseem conscious of the meal; for all that Miss Aldclyffe did in the way\r\nof eating, dinner might have been taken out as intact as it was taken\r\nin.\r\n\r\nIn her own private apartment Miss Aldclyffe again pulled out the letter\r\nof the morning. One passage in it ran thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course, being his wife, I could publish the fact, and compel him\r\nto acknowledge me at any moment, notwithstanding his threats, and\r\nreasonings that it will be better to wait. I have waited, and waited\r\nagain, and the time for such acknowledgment seems no nearer than at\r\nfirst. To show you how patiently I have waited I can tell you that not\r\ntill a fortnight ago, when by stress of circumstances I had been driven\r\nto new lodgings, have I ever assumed my married name, solely on account\r\nof its having been his request all along that I should not do it. This\r\nwriting to you, madam, is my first disobedience, and I am justified in\r\nit. A woman who is driven to visit her husband like a thief in the night\r\nand then sent away like a street dog--left to get up, unbolt, unbar,\r\nand find her way out of the house as she best may--is justified in doing\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But should I demand of him a restitution of rights, there would be\r\ninvolved a publicity which I could not endure, and a noisy scandal\r\nflinging my name the length and breadth of the country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What I still prefer to any such violent means is that you reason with\r\nhim privately, and compel him to bring me home to your parish in a\r\ndecent and careful manner, in the way that would be adopted by any\r\nrespectable man, whose wife had been living away from him for some\r\ntime, by reason, say, of peculiar family circumstances which had caused\r\ndisunion, but not enmity, and who at length was enabled to reinstate her\r\nin his house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will, I know, oblige me in this, especially as knowledge of a\r\npeculiar transaction of your own, which took place some years ago, has\r\nlately come to me in a singular way. I will not at present trouble you\r\nby describing how. It is enough, that I alone, of all people living,\r\nknow _all the sides of the story_, those from whom I collected it having\r\neach only a partial knowledge which confuses them and points to nothing.\r\nOne person knows of your early engagement and its sudden termination;\r\nanother, of the reason of those strange meetings at inns and\r\ncoffee-houses; another, of what was sufficient to cause all this, and so\r\non. I know what fits one and all the circumstances like a key, and shows\r\nthem to be the natural outcrop of a rational (though rather rash) line\r\nof conduct for a young lady. You will at once perceive how it was that\r\nsome at least of these things were revealed to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This knowledge then, common to, and secretly treasured by us both, is\r\nthe ground upon which I beg for your friendship and help, with a feeling\r\nthat you will be too generous to refuse it to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I may add that, as yet, my husband knows nothing of this, neither need\r\nhe if you remember my request.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A threat--a flat stinging threat! as delicately wrapped up in words as\r\nthe woman could do it; a threat from a miserable unknown creature to an\r\nAldclyffe, and not the least proud member of the family either! A threat\r\non his account--O, O! shall it be?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPresently this humour of defiance vanished, and the members of her body\r\nbecame supple again, her proceedings proving that it was absolutely\r\nnecessary to give way, Aldclyffe as she was. She wrote a short answer\r\nto Mrs. Manston, saying civilly that Mr. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s possession of such\r\na near relation was a fact quite new to herself, and that she would see\r\nwhat could be done in such an unfortunate affair.\r\n\r\n6. NOVEMBER THE TWENTY-FIRST\r\n\r\nManston received a message the next day requesting his attendance at the\r\nHouse punctually at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock the ensuing evening. Miss Aldclyffe\r\nwas brave and imperious, but with the purpose she had in view she could\r\nnot look him in the face whilst daylight shone upon her.\r\n\r\nThe steward was shown into the library. On entering it, he was\r\nimmediately struck with the unusual gloom which pervaded the apartment.\r\nThe fire was dead and dull, one lamp, and that a comparatively small\r\none, was burning at the extreme end, leaving the main proportion of\r\nthe lofty and sombre room in an artificial twilight, scarcely powerful\r\nenough to render visible the titles of the folio and quarto volumes\r\nwhich were jammed into the lower tiers of the bookshelves.\r\n\r\nAfter keeping him waiting for more than twenty minutes (Miss Aldclyffe\r\nknew that excellent recipe for taking the stiffness out of human flesh,\r\nand for extracting all pre-arrangement from human speech) she entered\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nManston sought her eye directly. The hue of her features was not\r\ndiscernible, but the calm glance she flung at him, from which all\r\nattempt at returning his scrutiny was absent, awoke him to the\r\nperception that probably his secret was by some means or other known to\r\nher; how it had become known he could not tell.\r\n\r\nShe drew forth the letter, unfolded it, and held it up to him, letting\r\nit hang by one corner from between her finger and thumb, so that the\r\nlight from the lamp, though remote, fell directly upon its surface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know whose writing this is?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\nHe saw the strokes plainly, instantly resolving to burn his ships and\r\nhazard all on an advance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My wife\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 he said calmly.\r\n\r\nHis quiet answer threw her off her balance. She had no more expected an\r\nanswer than does a preacher when he exclaims from the pulpit, \xe2\x80\x98Do you\r\nfeel your sin?\xe2\x80\x99 She had clearly expected a sudden alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And why all this concealment?\xe2\x80\x99 she said again, her voice rising, as she\r\nvainly endeavoured to control her feelings, whatever they were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t follow that, because a man is married, he must tell every\r\nstranger of it, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, just as calmly as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stranger! well, perhaps not; but, Mr. Manston, why did you choose to\r\nconceal it, I ask again? I have a perfect right to ask this question, as\r\nyou will perceive, if you consider the terms of my advertisement.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will tell you. There were two simple reasons. The first was this\r\npractical one; you advertised for an unmarried man, if you remember?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I remember.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, an incident suggested to me that I should try for the situation.\r\nI was married; but, knowing that in getting an office where there is a\r\nrestriction of this kind, leaving one\xe2\x80\x99s wife behind is always accepted\r\nas a fulfilment of the condition, I left her behind for awhile. The\r\nother reason is, that these terms of yours afforded me a plausible\r\nexcuse for escaping (for a short time) the company of a woman I had been\r\nmistaken in marrying.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mistaken! what was she?\xe2\x80\x99 the lady inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A third-rate actress, whom I met with during my stay in Liverpool\r\nlast summer, where I had gone to fulfil a short engagement with an\r\narchitect.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where did she come from?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is an American by birth, and I grew to dislike her when we had been\r\nmarried a week.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She was ugly, I imagine?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is not an ugly woman by any means.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Up to the ordinary standard?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite up to the ordinary standard--indeed, handsome. After a while we\r\nquarrelled and separated.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You did not ill-use her, of course?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe, with a little\r\nsarcasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But at any rate, you got thoroughly tired of her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nManston looked as if he began to think her questions out of place;\r\nhowever, he said quietly, \xe2\x80\x98I did get tired of her. I never told her so,\r\nbut we separated; I to come here, bringing her with me as far as London\r\nand leaving her there in perfectly comfortable quarters; and though your\r\nadvertisement expressed a single man, I have always intended to tell\r\nyou the whole truth; and this was when I was going to tell it, when\r\nyour satisfaction with my careful management of your affairs should have\r\nproved the risk to be a safe one to run.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I saw that you were good enough to be interested in my welfare to\r\na greater extent than I could have anticipated or hoped, judging you by\r\nthe frigidity of other employers, and this caused me to hesitate. I was\r\nvexed at the complication of affairs. So matters stood till three\r\nnights ago; I was then walking home from the pottery, and came up to the\r\nrailway. The down-train came along close to me, and there, sitting at\r\na carriage window, I saw my wife: she had found out my address, and had\r\nthereupon determined to follow me here. I had not been home many minutes\r\nbefore she came in, next morning early she left again--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because you treated her so cavalierly?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And as I suppose, wrote to you directly. That\xe2\x80\x99s the whole story of her,\r\nmadam.\xe2\x80\x99 Whatever were Manston\xe2\x80\x99s real feelings towards the lady who had\r\nreceived his explanation in these supercilious tones, they remained\r\nlocked within him as within a casket of steel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did your friends know of your marriage, Mr. Manston?\xe2\x80\x99 she continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nobody at all; we kept it a secret for various reasons.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is true then that, as your wife tells me in this letter, she has not\r\npassed as Mrs. Manston till within these last few days?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is quite true; I was in receipt of a very small and uncertain income\r\nwhen we married; and so she continued playing at the theatre as before\r\nour marriage, and in her maiden name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has she any friends?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have never heard that she has any in England. She came over here on\r\nsome theatrical speculation, as one of a company who were going to do\r\nmuch, but who never did anything; and here she has remained.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA pause ensued, which was terminated by Miss Aldclyffe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I understand,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98Now, though I have no direct right to concern\r\nmyself with your private affairs (beyond those which arise from your\r\nmisleading me and getting the office you hold)--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As to that, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 he interrupted, rather hotly, \xe2\x80\x98as to coming here,\r\nI am vexed as much as you. Somebody, a member of the Institute of\r\nArchitects--who, I could never tell--sent to my old address in London\r\nyour advertisement cut from the paper; it was forwarded to me; I wanted\r\nto get away from Liverpool, and it seemed as if this was put in my way\r\non purpose, by some old friend or other. I answered the advertisement\r\ncertainly, but I was not particularly anxious to come here, nor am I\r\nanxious to stay.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe descended from haughty superiority to womanly persuasion\r\nwith a haste which was almost ludicrous. Indeed, the Quos ego of the\r\nwhole lecture had been less the genuine menace of the imperious ruler of\r\nKnapwater than an artificial utterance to hide a failing heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, now, Mr. Manston, you wrong me; don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I wish to be\r\noverbearing, or anything of the kind; and you will allow me to say this\r\nmuch, at any rate, that I have become interested in your wife, as well\r\nas in yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, slowly, like a man feeling his way in the\r\ndark. Manston was utterly at fault now. His previous experience of the\r\neffect of his form and features upon womankind en masse, had taught\r\nhim to flatter himself that he could account by the same law of natural\r\nselection for the extraordinary interest Miss Aldclyffe had hitherto\r\ntaken in him, as an unmarried man; an interest he did not at all object\r\nto, seeing that it kept him near Cytherea, and enabled him, a man of\r\nno wealth, to rule on the estate as if he were its lawful owner. Like\r\nCurius at his Sabine farm, he had counted it his glory not to possess\r\ngold himself, but to have power over her who did. But at this hint of\r\nthe lady\xe2\x80\x99s wish to take his wife under her wing also, he was perplexed:\r\ncould she have any sinister motive in doing so? But he did not allow\r\nhimself to be troubled with these doubts, which only concerned his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She tells me,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Miss Aldclyffe, \xe2\x80\x98how utterly alone in\r\nthe world she stands, and that is an additional reason why I should\r\nsympathize with her. Instead, then, of requesting the favour of your\r\nretirement from the post, and dismissing your interests altogether, I\r\nwill retain you as my steward still, on condition that you bring home\r\nyour wife, and live with her respectably, in short, as if you loved her;\r\nyou understand. I _wish_ you to stay here if you grant that everything\r\nshall flow smoothly between yourself and her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe breast and shoulders of the steward rose, as if an expression\r\nof defiance was about to be poured forth; before it took form, he\r\ncontrolled himself and said, in his natural voice--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My part of the performance shall be carried out, madam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And her anxiety to obtain a standing in the world ensures that hers\r\nwill,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Aldclyffe. \xe2\x80\x98That will be satisfactory, then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter a few additional remarks, she gently signified that she wished to\r\nput an end to the interview. The steward took the hint and retired.\r\n\r\nHe felt vexed and mortified; yet in walking homeward he was convinced\r\nthat telling the whole truth as he had done, with the single exception\r\nof his love for Cytherea (which he tried to hide even from himself), had\r\nnever served him in better stead than it had done that night.\r\n\r\nManston went to his desk and thought of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s beauty with the\r\nbitterest, wildest regret. After the lapse of a few minutes he calmed\r\nhimself by a stoical effort, and wrote the subjoined letter to his\r\nwife:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        \xe2\x80\x98KNAPWATER,\r\n                                         November 21, 1864.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98DEAR EUNICE,--I hope you reached London safely after your flighty visit\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As I promised, I have thought over our conversation that night, and\r\nyour wish that your coming here should be no longer delayed. After all,\r\nit was perfectly natural that you should have spoken unkindly as you\r\ndid, ignorant as you were of the circumstances which bound me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I have made arrangements to fetch you home at once. It is hardly\r\nworth while for you to attempt to bring with you any luggage you may\r\nhave gathered about you (beyond mere clothing). Dispose of superfluous\r\nthings at a broker\xe2\x80\x99s; your bringing them would only make a talk in\r\nthis parish, and lead people to believe we had long been keeping house\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will next Monday suit you for coming? You have nothing to do that can\r\noccupy you for more than a day or two, as far as I can see, and the\r\nremainder of this week will afford ample time. I can be in London the\r\nnight before, and we will come down together by the mid-day train--Your\r\nvery affectionate husband,\r\n\r\n                                       \xe2\x80\x98AENEAS MANSTON.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, of course, I shall no longer write to you as Mrs. Rondley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nThe address on the envelope was--\r\n\r\nMRS. MANSTON,   41 CHARLES SQUARE,\r\n     HOXTON,\r\n        LONDON, N.\r\n\r\nHe took the letter to the house, and it being too late for the country\r\npost, sent one of the stablemen with it to Casterbridge, instead of\r\ntroubling to go to Budmouth with it himself as heretofore. He had no\r\nlonger any necessity to keep his condition a secret.\r\n\r\n7. FROM THE TWENTY-SECOND TO THE TWENTY-SEVENTH OF NOVEMBER\r\n\r\nBut the next morning Manston found that he had been forgetful of another\r\nmatter, in naming the following Monday to his wife for the journey.\r\n\r\nThe fact was this. A letter had just come, reminding him that he had\r\nleft the whole of the succeeding week open for an important business\r\nengagement with a neighbouring land-agent, at that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s residence\r\nthirteen miles off. The particular day he had suggested to his wife,\r\nhad, in the interim, been appropriated by his correspondent. The meeting\r\ncould not now be put off.\r\n\r\nSo he wrote again to his wife, stating that business, which could not\r\nbe postponed, called him away from home on Monday, and would entirely\r\nprevent him coming all the way to fetch her on Sunday night as he had\r\nintended, but that he would meet her at the Carriford Road Station with\r\na conveyance when she arrived there in the evening.\r\n\r\nThe next day came his wife\xe2\x80\x99s answer to his first letter, in which she\r\nsaid that she would be ready to be fetched at the time named. Having\r\nalready written his second letter, which was by that time in her hands,\r\nhe made no further reply.\r\n\r\nThe week passed away. The steward had, in the meantime, let it become\r\ngenerally known in the village that he was a married man, and by a\r\nlittle judicious management, sound family reasons for his past secrecy\r\nupon the subject, which were floated as adjuncts to the story, were\r\nplacidly received; they seemed so natural and justifiable to the\r\nunsophisticated minds of nine-tenths of his neighbours, that curiosity\r\nin the matter, beyond a strong curiosity to see the lady\xe2\x80\x99s face, was\r\nwell-nigh extinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. THE EVENTS OF A DAY AND NIGHT\r\n\r\n1. NOVEMBER THE TWENTY-EIGHTH. UNTIL TEN P.M.\r\n\r\nMonday came, the day named for Mrs. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s journey from London to\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s house; a day of singular and great events, influencing\r\nthe present and future of nearly all the personages whose actions in a\r\ncomplex drama form the subject of this record.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the steward demand the first notice. Whilst taking\r\nhis breakfast on this particular morning, the clock pointing to eight,\r\nthe horse-and-gig that was to take him to Chettlewood waiting ready at\r\nthe door, Manston hurriedly cast his eyes down the column of Bradshaw\r\nwhich showed the details and duration of the selected train\xe2\x80\x99s journey.\r\n\r\nThe inspection was carelessly made, the leaf being kept open by the aid\r\nof one hand, whilst the other still held his cup of coffee; much more\r\ncarelessly than would have been the case had the expected new-comer been\r\nCytherea Graye, instead of his lawful wife.\r\n\r\nHe did not perceive, branching from the column down which his finger\r\nran, a small twist, called a shunting-line, inserted at a particular\r\nplace, to imply that at that point the train was divided into two. By\r\nthis oversight he understood that the arrival of his wife at Carriford\r\nRoad Station would not be till late in the evening: by the second half\r\nof the train, containing the third-class passengers, and passing two\r\nhours and three-quarters later than the previous one, by which the lady,\r\nas a second-class passenger, would really be brought.\r\n\r\nHe then considered that there would be plenty of time for him to return\r\nfrom his day\xe2\x80\x99s engagement to meet this train. He finished his breakfast,\r\ngave proper and precise directions to his servant on the preparations\r\nthat were to be made for the lady\xe2\x80\x99s reception, jumped into his gig, and\r\ndrove off to Lord Claydonfield\xe2\x80\x99s, at Chettlewood.\r\n\r\nHe went along by the front of Knapwater House. He could not help turning\r\nto look at what he knew to be the window of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s room. Whilst he\r\nlooked, a hopeless expression of passionate love and sensuous anguish\r\ncame upon his face and lingered there for a few seconds; then, as on\r\nprevious occasions, it was resolutely repressed, and he trotted along\r\nthe smooth white road, again endeavouring to banish all thought of the\r\nyoung girl whose beauty and grace had so enslaved him.\r\n\r\nThus it was that when, in the evening of the same day, Mrs. Manston\r\nreached Carriford Road Station, her husband was still at Chettlewood,\r\nignorant of her arrival, and on looking up and down the platform, dreary\r\nwith autumn gloom and wind, she could see no sign that any preparation\r\nwhatever had been made for her reception and conduct home.\r\n\r\nThe train went on. She waited, fidgeted with the handle of her umbrella,\r\nwalked about, strained her eyes into the gloom of the chilly night,\r\nlistened for wheels, tapped with her foot, and showed all the usual\r\nsigns of annoyance and irritation: she was the more irritated in\r\nthat this seemed a second and culminating instance of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneglect--the first having been shown in his not fetching her.\r\n\r\nReflecting awhile upon the course it would be best to take, in order\r\nto secure a passage to Knapwater, she decided to leave all her luggage,\r\nexcept a dressing-bag, in the cloak-room, and walk to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, as she had done on her first visit. She asked one of the porters\r\nif he could find a lad to go with her and carry her bag: he offered to\r\ndo it himself.\r\n\r\nThe porter was a good-tempered, shallow-minded, ignorant man. Mrs.\r\nManston, being apparently in very gloomy spirits, would probably have\r\npreferred walking beside him without saying a word: but her companion\r\nwould not allow silence to continue between them for a longer period\r\nthan two or three minutes together.\r\n\r\nHe had volunteered several remarks upon her arrival, chiefly to the\r\neffect that it was very unfortunate Mr. Manston had not come to the\r\nstation for her, when she suddenly asked him concerning the inhabitants\r\nof the parish.\r\n\r\nHe told her categorically the names of the chief--first the chief\r\npossessors of property; then of brains; then of good looks. As first\r\namong the latter he mentioned Miss Cytherea Graye.\r\n\r\nAfter getting him to describe her appearance as completely as lay in\r\nhis power, she wormed out of him the statement that everybody had been\r\nsaying--before Mrs. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s existence was heard of--how well the\r\nhandsome Mr. Manston and the beautiful Miss Graye were suited for each\r\nother as man and wife, and that Miss Aldclyffe was the only one in the\r\nparish who took no interest in bringing about the match.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He rather liked her you think?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe porter began to think he had been too explicit, and hastened to\r\ncorrect the error.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no, he don\xe2\x80\x99t care a bit about her, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 he said solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not more than he does about me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a bit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then that must be little indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Manston murmured. She stood\r\nstill, as if reflecting upon the painful neglect her words had recalled\r\nto her mind; then, with a sudden impulse, turned round, and walked\r\npetulantly a few steps back again in the direction of the station.\r\n\r\nThe porter stood still and looked surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back again; yes, indeed, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back again!\xe2\x80\x99 she said\r\nplaintively. Then she paused and looked anxiously up and down the\r\ndeserted road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go back now,\xe2\x80\x99 she continued, in a tone of resignation.\r\nSeeing that the porter was watching her, she turned about and came on as\r\nbefore, giving vent to a slight laugh.\r\n\r\nIt was a laugh full of character; the low forced laugh which seeks to\r\nhide the painful perception of a humiliating position under the mask of\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\nAltogether her conduct had shown her to be what in fact she was, a weak,\r\nthough a calculating woman, one clever to conceive, weak to execute:\r\none whose best-laid schemes were for ever liable to be frustrated by the\r\nineradicable blight of vacillation at the critical hour of action.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, if I had only known that all this was going to happen!\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured\r\nagain, as they paced along upon the rustling leaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you say, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 said the porter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, nothing particular; we are getting near the old manor-house by this\r\ntime, I imagine?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very near now, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey soon reached Manston\xe2\x80\x99s residence, round which the wind blew\r\nmournfully and chill.\r\n\r\nPassing under the detached gateway, they entered the porch. The porter\r\nstepped forward, knocked heavily and waited.\r\n\r\nNobody came.\r\n\r\nMrs. Manston then advanced to the door and gave a different series of\r\nrappings--less forcible, but more sustained.\r\n\r\nThere was not a movement of any kind inside, not a ray of light visible;\r\nnothing but the echo of her own knocks through the passages, and the dry\r\nscratching of the withered leaves blown about her feet upon the floor of\r\nthe porch.\r\n\r\nThe steward, of course, was not at home. Mrs. Crickett, not expecting\r\nthat anybody would arrive till the time of the later train, had set the\r\nplace in order, laid the supper-table, and then locked the door, to go\r\ninto the village and converse with her friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is there an inn in the village?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Manston, after the fourth\r\nand loudest rapping upon the iron-studded old door had resulted only in\r\nthe fourth and loudest echo from the passages inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who keeps it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Farmer Springrove.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will go there to-night,\xe2\x80\x99 she said decisively. \xe2\x80\x98It is too cold, and\r\naltogether too bad, for a woman to wait in the open road on anybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount, gentle or simple.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey went down the park and through the gate, into the village of\r\nCarriford. By the time they reached the Three Tranters, it was verging\r\nupon ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. There, on the spot where two months earlier in the\r\nseason the sunny and lively group of villagers making cider under the\r\ntrees had greeted Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, was nothing now intelligible but a\r\nvast cloak of darkness, from which came the low sough of the elms, and\r\nthe occasional creak of the swinging sign.\r\n\r\nThey went to the door, Mrs. Manston shivering; but less from the cold,\r\nthan from the dreariness of her emotions. Neglect is the coldest of\r\nwinter winds.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that Edward Springrove was expected to arrive from London\r\neither on that evening or the next, and at the sound of voices his\r\nfather came to the door fully expecting to see him. A picture of\r\ndisappointment seldom witnessed in a man\xe2\x80\x99s face was visible in old Mr.\r\nSpringrove\xe2\x80\x99s, when he saw that the comer was a stranger.\r\n\r\nMrs. Manston asked for a room, and one that had been prepared for Edward\r\nwas immediately named as being ready for her, another being adaptable\r\nfor Edward, should he come in.\r\n\r\nWithout taking any refreshment, or entering any room downstairs, or even\r\nlifting her veil, she walked straight along the passage and up to her\r\napartment, the chambermaid preceding her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If Mr. Manston comes to-night,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, sitting on the bed as she had\r\ncome in, and addressing the woman, \xe2\x80\x98tell him I cannot see him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe woman left the room, and Mrs. Manston locked the door. Before\r\nthe servant had gone down more than two or three stairs, Mrs. Manston\r\nunfastened the door again, and held it ajar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bring me some brandy,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\nThe chambermaid went down to the bar and brought up the spirit in a\r\ntumbler. When she came into the room, Mrs. Manston had not removed a\r\nsingle article of apparel, and was walking up and down, as if still\r\nquite undecided upon the course it was best to adopt.\r\n\r\nOutside the door, when it was closed upon her, the maid paused to listen\r\nfor an instant. She heard Mrs. Manston talking to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is welcome home!\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n2. FROM TEN TO HALF-PAST ELEVEN P.M.\r\n\r\nA strange concurrence of phenomena now confronts us.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn in which the past scenes were enacted, Mr. Springrove\r\nhad ploughed, harrowed, and cleaned a narrow and shaded piece of ground,\r\nlying at the back of his house, which for many years had been looked\r\nupon as irreclaimable waste.\r\n\r\nThe couch-grass extracted from the soil had been left to wither in the\r\nsun; afterwards it was raked together, lighted in the customary way, and\r\nnow lay smouldering in a large heap in the middle of the plot.\r\n\r\nIt had been kindled three days previous to Mrs. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, and\r\none or two villagers, of a more cautious and less sanguine temperament\r\nthan Springrove, had suggested that the fire was almost too near the\r\nback of the house for its continuance to be unattended with risk; for\r\nthough no danger could be apprehended whilst the air remained moderately\r\nstill, a brisk breeze blowing towards the house might possibly carry a\r\nspark across.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, that\xe2\x80\x99s true enough,\xe2\x80\x99 said Springrove. \xe2\x80\x98I must look round before\r\ngoing to bed and see that everything\xe2\x80\x99s safe; but to tell the truth I\r\nam anxious to get the rubbish burnt up before the rain comes to wash it\r\ninto ground again. As to carrying the couch into the back field to\r\nburn, and bringing it back again, why, \xe2\x80\x98tis more than the ashes would be\r\nworth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s very true,\xe2\x80\x99 said the neighbours, and passed on.\r\n\r\nTwo or three times during the first evening after the heap was lit, he\r\nwent to the back door to take a survey. Before bolting and barring\r\nup for the night, he made a final and more careful examination.\r\nThe slowly-smoking pile showed not the slightest signs of activity.\r\nSpringrove\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly sound conclusion was, that as long as the heap\r\nwas not stirred, and the wind continued in the quarter it blew from\r\nthen, the couch would not flame, and that there could be no shadow of\r\ndanger to anything, even a combustible substance, though it were no more\r\nthan a yard off.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the burning couch was discovered in precisely the same\r\nstate as when he had gone to bed the preceding night. The heap smoked\r\nin the same manner the whole of that day: at bed-time the farmer looked\r\ntowards it, but less carefully than on the first night.\r\n\r\nThe morning and the whole of the third day still saw the heap in its old\r\nsmouldering condition; indeed, the smoke was less, and there seemed a\r\nprobability that it might have to be re-kindled on the morrow.\r\n\r\nAfter admitting Mrs. Manston to his house in the evening, and hearing\r\nher retire, Mr. Springrove returned to the front door to listen for a\r\nsound of his son, and inquired concerning him of the railway-porter,\r\nwho sat for a while in the kitchen. The porter had not noticed young\r\nMr. Springrove get out of the train, at which intelligence the old man\r\nconcluded that he would probably not see his son till the next day,\r\nas Edward had hitherto made a point of coming by the train which had\r\nbrought Mrs. Manston.\r\n\r\nHalf-an-hour later the porter left the inn, Springrove at the same time\r\ngoing to the door to listen again an instant, then he walked round and\r\nin at the back of the house.\r\n\r\nThe farmer glanced at the heap casually and indifferently in passing;\r\ntwo nights of safety seemed to ensure the third; and he was about to\r\nbolt and bar as usual, when the idea struck him that there was just a\r\npossibility of his son\xe2\x80\x99s return by the latest train, unlikely as it\r\nwas that he would be so delayed. The old man thereupon left the door\r\nunfastened, looked to his usual matters indoors, and went to bed, it\r\nbeing then half-past ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nFarmers and horticulturists well know that it is in the nature of a heap\r\nof couch-grass, when kindled in calm weather, to smoulder for many days,\r\nand even weeks, until the whole mass is reduced to a powdery charcoal\r\nash, displaying the while scarcely a sign of combustion beyond the\r\nvolcano-like smoke from its summit; but the continuance of this quiet\r\nprocess is throughout its length at the mercy of one particular whim\r\nof Nature: that is, a sudden breeze, by which the heap is liable to be\r\nfanned into a flame so brisk as to consume the whole in an hour or two.\r\n\r\nHad the farmer narrowly watched the pile when he went to close the door,\r\nhe would have seen, besides the familiar twine of smoke from its summit,\r\na quivering of the air around the mass, showing that a considerable heat\r\nhad arisen inside.\r\n\r\nAs the railway-porter turned the corner of the row of houses adjoining\r\nthe Three Tranters, a brisk new wind greeted his face, and spread past\r\nhim into the village. He walked along the high-road till he came to a\r\ngate, about three hundred yards from the inn. Over the gate could\r\nbe discerned the situation of the building he had just quitted. He\r\ncarelessly turned his head in passing, and saw behind him a clear red\r\nglow indicating the position of the couch-heap: a glow without a flame,\r\nincreasing and diminishing in brightness as the breeze quickened or\r\nfell, like the coal of a newly lighted cigar. If those cottages had\r\nbeen his, he thought, he should not care to have a fire so near them as\r\nthat--and the wind rising. But the cottages not being his, he went on\r\nhis way to the station, where he was about to resume duty for the night.\r\nThe road was now quite deserted: till four o\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning,\r\nwhen the carters would go by to the stables there was little probability\r\nof any human being passing the Three Tranters Inn.\r\n\r\nBy eleven, everybody in the house was asleep. It truly seemed as if\r\nthe treacherous element knew there had arisen a grand opportunity for\r\ndevastation.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter past eleven a slight stealthy crackle made itself heard\r\namid the increasing moans of the night wind; the heap glowed brighter\r\nstill, and burst into a flame; the flame sank, another breeze entered\r\nit, sustained it, and it grew to be first continuous and weak, then\r\ncontinuous and strong.\r\n\r\nAt twenty minutes past eleven a blast of wind carried an airy bit of\r\nignited fern several yards forward, in a direction parallel to the\r\nhouses and inn, and there deposited it on the ground.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later another puff of wind carried a similar piece to a\r\ndistance of five-and-twenty yards, where it also was dropped softly on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nStill the wind did not blow in the direction of the houses, and even now\r\nto a casual observer they would have appeared safe. But Nature does few\r\nthings directly. A minute later yet, an ignited fragment fell upon the\r\nstraw covering of a long thatched heap or \xe2\x80\x98grave\xe2\x80\x99 of mangel-wurzel,\r\nlying in a direction at right angles to the house, and down toward the\r\nhedge. There the fragment faded to darkness.\r\n\r\nA short time subsequent to this, after many intermediate deposits and\r\nseemingly baffled attempts, another fragment fell on the mangel-wurzel\r\ngrave, and continued to glow; the glow was increased by the wind; the\r\nstraw caught fire and burst into flame. It was inevitable that the flame\r\nshould run along the ridge of the thatch towards a piggery at the end.\r\nYet had the piggery been tiled, the time-honoured hostel would even now\r\nat this last moment have been safe; but it was constructed as piggeries\r\nare mostly constructed, of wood and thatch. The hurdles and straw roof\r\nof the frail erection became ignited in their turn, and abutting as the\r\nshed did on the back of the inn, flamed up to the eaves of the main roof\r\nin less than thirty seconds.\r\n\r\n3. HALF-PAST ELEVEN TO TWELVE P.M.\r\n\r\nA hazardous length of time elapsed before the inmates of the Three\r\nTranters knew of their danger. When at length the discovery was made,\r\nthe rush was a rush for bare life.\r\n\r\nA man\xe2\x80\x99s voice calling, then screams, then loud stamping and shouts were\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nMr. Springrove ran out first. Two minutes later appeared the ostler and\r\nchambermaid, who were man and wife. The inn, as has been stated, was a\r\nquaint old building, and as inflammable as a bee-hive; it overhung the\r\nbase at the level of the first floor, and again overhung at the eaves,\r\nwhich were finished with heavy oak barge-boards; every atom in its\r\nsubstance, every feature in its construction, favoured the fire.\r\n\r\nThe forked flames, lurid and smoky, became nearly lost to view, bursting\r\nforth again with a bound and loud crackle, increased tenfold in power\r\nand brightness. The crackling grew sharper. Long quivering shadows began\r\nto be flung from the stately trees at the end of the house; the square\r\noutline of the church tower, on the other side of the way, which had\r\nhitherto been a dark mass against a sky comparatively light, now began\r\nto appear as a light object against a sky of darkness; and even the\r\nnarrow surface of the flag-staff at the top could be seen in its dark\r\nsurrounding, brought out from its obscurity by the rays from the dancing\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nShouts and other noises increased in loudness and frequency. The lapse\r\nof ten minutes brought most of the inhabitants of that end of the\r\nvillage into the street, followed in a short time by the rector, Mr.\r\nRaunham.\r\n\r\nCasting a hasty glance up and down, he beckoned to one or two of the\r\nmen, and vanished again. In a short time wheels were heard, and Mr.\r\nRaunham and the men reappeared, with the garden engine, the only one in\r\nthe village, except that at Knapwater House. After some little trouble\r\nthe hose was connected with a tank in the old stable-yard, and the puny\r\ninstrument began to play.\r\n\r\nSeveral seemed paralyzed at first, and stood transfixed, their rigid\r\nfaces looking like red-hot iron in the glaring light. In the confusion\r\na woman cried, \xe2\x80\x98Ring the bells backwards!\xe2\x80\x99 and three or four of the old\r\nand superstitious entered the belfry and jangled them indescribably.\r\nSome were only half dressed, and, to add to the horror, among them was\r\nClerk Crickett, running up and down with a face streaming with blood,\r\nghastly and pitiful to see, his excitement being so great that he had\r\nnot the slightest conception of how, when, or where he came by the\r\nwound.\r\n\r\nThe crowd was now busy at work, and tried to save a little of the\r\nfurniture of the inn. The only room they could enter was the parlour,\r\nfrom which they managed to bring out the bureau, a few chairs, some old\r\nsilver candlesticks, and half-a-dozen light articles; but these were\r\nall.\r\n\r\nFiery mats of thatch slid off the roof and fell into the road with a\r\ndeadened thud, whilst white flakes of straw and wood-ash were flying in\r\nthe wind like feathers. At the same time two of the cottages adjoining,\r\nupon which a little water had been brought to play from the rector\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nengine, were seen to be on fire. The attenuated spirt of water was as\r\nnothing upon the heated and dry surface of the thatched roof; the\r\nfire prevailed without a minute\xe2\x80\x99s hindrance, and dived through to the\r\nrafters.\r\n\r\nSuddenly arose a cry, \xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Springrove?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had vanished from the spot by the churchyard wall, where he had been\r\nstanding a few minutes earlier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fancy he\xe2\x80\x99s gone inside,\xe2\x80\x99 said a voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Madness and folly! what can he save?\xe2\x80\x99 said another. \xe2\x80\x98Good God, find\r\nhim! Help here!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA wild rush was made at the door, which had fallen to, and in defiance\r\nof the scorching flame that burst forth, three men forced themselves\r\nthrough it. Immediately inside the threshold they found the object of\r\ntheir search lying senseless on the floor of the passage.\r\n\r\nTo bring him out and lay him on a bank was the work of an instant; a\r\nbasin of cold water was dashed in his face, and he began to recover\r\nconsciousness, but very slowly. He had been saved by a miracle. No\r\nsooner were his preservers out of the building than the window-frames\r\nlit up as if by magic with deep and waving fringes of flames.\r\nSimultaneously, the joints of the boards forming the front door started\r\ninto view as glowing bars of fire: a star of red light penetrated the\r\ncentre, gradually increasing in size till the flames rushed forth.\r\n\r\nThen the staircase fell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everybody is out safe,\xe2\x80\x99 said a voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, thank God!\xe2\x80\x99 said three or four others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, we forgot that a stranger came! I think she is safe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope she is,\xe2\x80\x99 said the weak voice of some one coming up from behind.\r\nIt was the chambermaid\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nSpringrove at that moment aroused himself; he staggered to his feet, and\r\nthrew his hands up wildly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everybody, no! no! The lady who came by train, Mrs. Manston! I tried to\r\nfetch her out, but I fell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAn exclamation of horror burst from the crowd; it was caused partly\r\nby this disclosure of Springrove, more by the added perception which\r\nfollowed his words.\r\n\r\nAn average interval of about three minutes had elapsed between one\r\nintensely fierce gust of wind and the next, and now another poured over\r\nthem; the roof swayed, and a moment afterwards fell in with a crash,\r\npulling the gable after it, and thrusting outwards the front wall of\r\nwood-work, which fell into the road with a rumbling echo; a cloud of\r\nblack dust, myriads of sparks, and a great outburst of flame followed\r\nthe uproar of the fall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is she? what is she?\xe2\x80\x99 burst from every lip again and again,\r\nincoherently, and without leaving a sufficient pause for a reply, had a\r\nreply been volunteered.\r\n\r\nThe autumn wind, tameless, and swift, and proud, still blew upon the\r\ndying old house, which was constructed so entirely of combustible\r\nmaterials that it burnt almost as fiercely as a corn-rick. The heat\r\nin the road increased, and now for an instant at the height of the\r\nconflagration all stood still, and gazed silently, awestruck and\r\nhelpless, in the presence of so irresistible an enemy. Then, with minds\r\nfull of the tragedy unfolded to them, they rushed forward again with\r\nthe obtuse directness of waves, to their labour of saving goods from the\r\nhouses adjoining, which it was evident were all doomed to destruction.\r\n\r\nThe minutes passed by. The Three Tranters Inn sank into a mere heap of\r\nred-hot charcoal: the fire pushed its way down the row as the church\r\nclock opposite slowly struck the hour of midnight, and the bewildered\r\nchimes, scarcely heard amid the crackling of the flames, wandered\r\nthrough the wayward air of the Old Hundred-and-Thirteenth Psalm.\r\n\r\n4. NINE TO ELEVEN P.M.\r\n\r\nManston mounted his gig and set out from Chettlewood that evening in no\r\nvery enviable frame of mind. The thought of domestic life in Knapwater\r\nOld House, with the now eclipsed wife of the past, was more than\r\ndisagreeable, was positively distasteful to him.\r\n\r\nYet he knew that the influential position, which, from whatever\r\nfortunate cause, he held on Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s manor, would never again\r\nfall to his lot on any other, and he tacitly assented to this dilemma,\r\nhoping that some consolation or other would soon suggest itself to him;\r\nmarried as he was, he was near Cytherea.\r\n\r\nHe occasionally looked at his watch as he drove along the lanes, timing\r\nthe pace of his horse by the hour, that he might reach Carriford Road\r\nStation just soon enough to meet the last London train.\r\n\r\nHe soon began to notice in the sky a slight yellow halo, near the\r\nhorizon. It rapidly increased; it changed colour, and grew redder; then\r\nthe glare visibly brightened and dimmed at intervals, showing that its\r\norigin was affected by the strong wind prevailing.\r\n\r\nManston reined in his horse on the summit of a hill, and considered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a rick-yard on fire,\xe2\x80\x99 he thought; \xe2\x80\x98no house could produce such a\r\nraging flame so suddenly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe trotted on again, attempting to particularize the local features in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the fire; but this it was too dark to do, and the\r\nexcessive winding of the roads misled him as to its direction, not being\r\nan old inhabitant of the district, or a countryman used to forming\r\nsuch judgments; whilst the brilliancy of the light shortened its real\r\nremoteness to an apparent distance of not more than half: it seemed so\r\nnear that he again stopped his horse, this time to listen; but he could\r\nhear no sound.\r\n\r\nEntering now a narrow valley, the sides of which obscured the sky to an\r\nangle of perhaps thirty or forty degrees above the mathematical horizon,\r\nhe was obliged to suspend his judgment till he was in possession of\r\nfurther knowledge, having however assumed in the interim, that the fire\r\nwas somewhere between Carriford Road Station and the village.\r\n\r\nThe self-same glare had just arrested the eyes of another man. He was\r\nat that minute gliding along several miles to the east of the steward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nposition, but nearing the same point as that to which Manston tended.\r\nThe younger Edward Springrove was returning from London to his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse by the identical train which the steward was expecting to bring\r\nhis wife, the truth being that Edward\xe2\x80\x99s lateness was owing to the\r\nsimplest of all causes, his temporary want of money, which led him to\r\nmake a slow journey for the sake of travelling at third-class fare.\r\n\r\nSpringrove had received Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s bitter and admonitory letter, and he\r\nwas clearly awakened to a perception of the false position in which\r\nhe had placed himself, by keeping silence at Budmouth on his long\r\nengagement. An increasing reluctance to put an end to those few days of\r\necstasy with Cytherea had overruled his conscience, and tied his tongue\r\ntill speaking was too late.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why did I do it? how could I dream of loving her?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked himself as\r\nhe walked by day, as he tossed on his bed by night: \xe2\x80\x98miserable folly!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAn impressionable heart had for years--perhaps as many as six or seven\r\nyears--been distracting him, by unconsciously setting itself to yearn\r\nfor somebody wanting, he scarcely knew whom. Echoes of himself, though\r\nrarely, he now and then found. Sometimes they were men, sometimes women,\r\nhis cousin Adelaide being one of these; for in spite of a fashion which\r\npervades the whole community at the present day--the habit of exclaiming\r\nthat woman is not undeveloped man, but diverse, the fact remains that,\r\nafter all, women are Mankind, and that in many of the sentiments of life\r\nthe difference of sex is but a difference of degree.\r\n\r\nBut the indefinable helpmate to the remoter sides of himself still\r\ncontinued invisible. He grew older, and concluded that the ideas, or\r\nrather emotions, which possessed him on the subject, were probably too\r\nunreal ever to be found embodied in the flesh of a woman. Thereupon,\r\nhe developed a plan of satisfying his dreams by wandering away to the\r\nheroines of poetical imagination, and took no further thought on the\r\nearthly realization of his formless desire, in more homely matters\r\nsatisfying himself with his cousin.\r\n\r\nCytherea appeared in the sky: his heart started up and spoke:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98Tis She, and here\r\n     Lo! I unclothe and clear\r\n     My wishes\xe2\x80\x99 cloudy character.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSome women kindle emotion so rapidly in a man\xe2\x80\x99s heart that the judgment\r\ncannot keep pace with its rise, and finds, on comprehending the\r\nsituation, that faithfulness to the old love is already treachery to the\r\nnew. Such women are not necessarily the greatest of their sex, but there\r\nare very few of them. Cytherea was one.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the letter from her he had taken to thinking over these\r\nthings, and had not answered it at all. But \xe2\x80\x98hungry generations\xe2\x80\x99 soon\r\ntread down the muser in a city. At length he thought of the strong\r\nnecessity of living. After a dreary search, the negligence of which was\r\nultimately overcome by mere conscientiousness, he obtained a situation\r\nas assistant to an architect in the neighbourhood of Charing Cross: the\r\nduties would not begin till after the lapse of a month.\r\n\r\nHe could not at first decide whither he should go to spend the\r\nintervening time; but in the midst of his reasonings he found himself\r\non the road homeward, impelled by a secret and unowned hope of getting a\r\nlast glimpse of Cytherea there.\r\n\r\n5. MIDNIGHT\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter to twelve when Manston drove into the station-yard.\r\nThe train was punctual, and the bell, announcing its arrival, rang as he\r\ncrossed the booking-office to go out upon the platform.\r\n\r\nThe porter who had accompanied Mrs. Manston to Carriford, and had\r\nreturned to the station on his night duty, recognized the steward as he\r\nentered, and immediately came towards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Manston came by the nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock train, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\nThe steward gave vent to an expression of vexation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her luggage is here, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 the porter said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Put it up behind me in the gig if it is not too much,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Directly this train is in and gone, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man vanished and crossed the line to meet the entering train.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is that fire?\xe2\x80\x99 Manston said to the booking-clerk.\r\n\r\nBefore the clerk could speak, another man ran in and answered the\r\nquestion without having heard it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Half Carriford is burnt down, or will be!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nthe flames from this station on account of the trees, but step on the\r\nbridge--\xe2\x80\x98tis tremendous!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe also crossed the line to assist at the entry of the train, which came\r\nin the next minute.\r\n\r\nThe steward stood in the office. One passenger alighted, gave up his\r\nticket, and crossed the room in front of Manston: a young man with a\r\nblack bag and umbrella in his hand. He passed out of the door, down the\r\nsteps, and struck out into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who was that young man?\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston, when the porter had returned.\r\nThe young man, by a kind of magnetism, had drawn the steward\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s an architect.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My own old profession. I could have sworn it by the cut of him,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nManston murmured. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s his name?\xe2\x80\x99 he said again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Springrove--Farmer Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s son, Edward.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Farmer Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s son, Edward,\xe2\x80\x99 the steward repeated to himself, and\r\nconsidered a matter to which the words had painfully recalled his mind.\r\n\r\nThe matter was Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s mention of the young man as Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlover, which, indeed, had scarcely ever been absent from his thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But for the existence of my wife that man might have been my rival,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\npondered, following the porter, who had now come back to him, into the\r\nluggage-room. And whilst the man was carrying out and putting in one\r\nbox, which was sufficiently portable for the gig, Manston still thought,\r\nas his eyes watched the process--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But for my wife, Springrove might have been my rival.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe examined the lamps of his gig, carefully laid out the reins, mounted\r\nthe seat and drove along the turnpike-road towards Knapwater Park.\r\n\r\nThe exact locality of the fire was plain to him as he neared home.\r\nHe soon could hear the shout of men, the flapping of the flames,\r\nthe crackling of burning wood, and could smell the smoke from the\r\nconflagration.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden, a few yards ahead, within the compass of the rays from the\r\nright-hand lamp, burst forward the figure of a man. Having been walking\r\nin darkness the newcomer raised his hands to his eyes, on approaching\r\nnearer, to screen them from the glare of the reflector.\r\n\r\nManston saw that he was one of the villagers: a small farmer originally,\r\nwho had drunk himself down to a day-labourer and reputed poacher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hoy!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Manston, aloud, that the man might step aside out of the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that Mr. Manston?\xe2\x80\x99 said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Somebody ha\xe2\x80\x99 come to Carriford: and the rest of it may concern you,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you expect Mrs. Manston to-night, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, unfortunately she\xe2\x80\x99s come, I know, and asleep long before this\r\ntime, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe labourer leant his elbow upon the shaft of the gig and turned his\r\nface, pale and sweating from his late work at the fire, up to Manston\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, she did come,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.... \xe2\x80\x98I beg pardon, sir, but I should be\r\nglad of--of--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Glad of a trifle for bringen ye the news.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a farthing! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want your news, I knew she was come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t you give me a shillen, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then will you lend me a shillen, sir? I be tired out, and don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat to do. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t pay you back some day I\xe2\x80\x99ll be d--d.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The devil is so cheated that perdition isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth a penny as a\r\nsecurity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me go on,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thy wife is _dead_; that\xe2\x80\x99s the rest o\xe2\x80\x99 the news,\xe2\x80\x99 said the labourer\r\nslowly. He waited for a reply; none came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She went to the Three Tranters, because she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get into thy\r\nhouse, the burnen roof fell in upon her before she could be called up,\r\nand she\xe2\x80\x99s a cinder, as thou\xe2\x80\x99lt be some day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That will do, let me drive on,\xe2\x80\x99 said the steward calmly.\r\n\r\nExpectation of a concussion may be so intense that its failure strikes\r\nthe brain with more force than its fulfilment. The labourer sank back\r\ninto the ditch. Such a Cushi could not realize the possibility of such\r\nan unmoved David as this.\r\n\r\nManston drove hastily to the turning of the road, tied his horse, and\r\nran on foot to the site of the fire.\r\n\r\nThe stagnation caused by the awful accident had been passed through,\r\nand all hands were helping to remove from the remaining cottage what\r\nfurniture they could lay hold of; the thatch of the roofs being already\r\non fire. The Knapwater fire-engine had arrived on the spot, but it was\r\nsmall, and ineffectual. A group was collected round the rector, who in a\r\ncoat which had become bespattered, scorched, and torn in his exertions,\r\nwas directing on one hand the proceedings relative to the removal of\r\ngoods into the church, and with the other was pointing out the spot\r\non which it was most desirable that the puny engines at their disposal\r\nshould be made to play. Every tongue was instantly silent at the sight\r\nof Manston\xe2\x80\x99s pale and clear countenance, which contrasted strangely with\r\nthe grimy and streaming faces of the toiling villagers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was she burnt?\xe2\x80\x99 he said in a firm though husky voice, and stepping into\r\nthe illuminated area. The rector came to him, and took him aside. \xe2\x80\x98Is\r\nshe burnt?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Manston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is dead: but thank God, she was spared the horrid agony of\r\nburning,\xe2\x80\x99 the rector said solemnly; \xe2\x80\x98the roof and gable fell in upon\r\nher, and crushed her. Instant death must have followed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why was she here?\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From what we can hurriedly collect, it seems that she found the door\r\nof your house locked, and concluded that you had retired, the fact being\r\nthat your servant, Mrs. Crickett, had gone out to supper. She then came\r\nback to the inn and went to bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s the landlord?\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston.\r\n\r\nMr. Springrove came up, walking feebly, and wrapped in a cloak, and\r\ncorroborated the evidence given by the rector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did she look ill, or annoyed, when she came?\xe2\x80\x99 said the steward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t say. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see; but I think--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you think?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She was much put out about something.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My not meeting her, naturally,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured the other, lost in reverie.\r\nHe turned his back on Springrove and the rector, and retired from the\r\nshining light.\r\n\r\nEverything had been done that could be done with the limited means\r\nat their disposal. The whole row of houses was destroyed, and each\r\npresented itself as one stage of a series, progressing from smoking\r\nruins at the end where the inn had stood, to a partly flaming\r\nmass--glowing as none but wood embers will glow--at the other.\r\n\r\nA feature in the decline of town fires was noticeably absent\r\nhere--steam. There was present what is not observable in\r\ntowns--incandescence.\r\n\r\nThe heat, and the smarting effect upon their eyes of the strong smoke\r\nfrom the burning oak and deal, had at last driven the villagers back\r\nfrom the road in front of the houses, and they now stood in groups\r\nin the churchyard, the surface of which, raised by the interments of\r\ngenerations, stood four or five feet above the level of the road, and\r\nalmost even with the top of the low wall dividing one from the other.\r\nThe headstones stood forth whitely against the dark grass and yews,\r\ntheir brightness being repeated on the white smock-frocks of some of the\r\nlabourers, and in a mellower, ruddier form on their faces and hands, on\r\nthose of the grinning gargoyles, and on other salient stonework of the\r\nweather-beaten church in the background.\r\n\r\nThe rector had decided that, under the distressing circumstances of\r\nthe case, there would be no sacrilege in placing in the church, for the\r\nnight, the pieces of furniture and utensils which had been saved from\r\nthe several houses. There was no other place of safety for them, and\r\nthey accordingly were gathered there.\r\n\r\n6. HALF-PAST TWELVE TO ONE A.M.\r\n\r\nManston, when he retired to meditate, had walked round the churchyard,\r\nand now entered the opened door of the building.\r\n\r\nHe mechanically pursued his way round the piers into his own seat in\r\nthe north aisle. The lower atmosphere of this spot was shaded by its own\r\nwall from the shine which streamed in over the window-sills on the\r\nsame side. The only light burning inside the church was a small tallow\r\ncandle, standing in the font, in the opposite aisle of the building to\r\nthat in which Manston had sat down, and near where the furniture was\r\npiled. The candle\xe2\x80\x99s mild rays were overpowered by the ruddier light from\r\nthe ruins, making the weak flame to appear like the moon by day.\r\n\r\nSitting there he saw Farmer Springrove enter the door, followed by his\r\nson Edward, still carrying his travelling-bag in his hand. They\r\nwere speaking of the sad death of Mrs. Manston, but the subject was\r\nrelinquished for that of the houses burnt.\r\n\r\nThis row of houses, running from the inn eastward, had been built under\r\nthe following circumstances:--\r\n\r\nFifty years before this date, the spot upon which the cottages\r\nafterwards stood was a blank strip, along the side of the village\r\nstreet, difficult to cultivate, on account of the outcrop thereon of a\r\nlarge bed of flints called locally a \xe2\x80\x98lanch\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98lanchet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Aldclyffe then in possession of the estate conceived the idea that\r\na row of cottages would be an improvement to the spot, and accordingly\r\ngranted leases of portions to several respectable inhabitants. Each\r\nlessee was to be subject to the payment of a merely nominal rent for\r\nthe whole term of lives, on condition that he built his own cottage, and\r\ndelivered it up intact at the end of the term.\r\n\r\nThose who had built had, one by one, relinquished their indentures,\r\neither by sale or barter, to Farmer Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s father. New lives were\r\nadded in some cases, by payment of a sum to the lord of the manor, etc.,\r\nand all the leases were now held by the farmer himself, as one of the\r\nchief provisions for his old age.\r\n\r\nThe steward had become interested in the following conversation:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Try not to be so depressed, father; they are all insured.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe words came from Edward in an anxious tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mistake, Edward; they are not insured,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the old man\r\ngloomily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not?\xe2\x80\x99 the son asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not one!\xe2\x80\x99 said the farmer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the Helmet Fire Office, surely?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They were insured there every one. Six months ago the office, which had\r\nbeen raising the premiums on thatched premises higher for some years,\r\ngave up insuring them altogether, as two or three other fire-offices had\r\ndone previously, on account, they said, of the uncertainty and\r\ngreatness of the risk of thatch undetached. Ever since then I have been\r\ncontinually intending to go to another office, but have never gone. Who\r\nexpects a fire?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you remember the terms of the leases?\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward, still more\r\nuneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, not particularly,\xe2\x80\x99 said his father absently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where are they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the bureau there; that\xe2\x80\x99s why I tried to save it first, among other\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, we must see to that at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you want?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The key.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey went into the south aisle, took the candle from the font, and then\r\nproceeded to open the bureau, which had been placed in a corner under\r\nthe gallery. Both leant over upon the flap; Edward holding the candle,\r\nwhilst his father took the pieces of parchment from one of the drawers,\r\nand spread the first out before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You read it, Ted. I can\xe2\x80\x99t see without my glasses. This one will be\r\nsufficient. The terms of all are the same.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEdward took the parchment, and read quickly and indistinctly for some\r\ntime; then aloud and slowly as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the said John Springrove for himself his heirs executors and\r\nadministrators doth covenant and agree with the said Gerald Fellcourt\r\nAldclyffe his heirs and assigns that he the said John Springrove his\r\nheirs and assigns during the said term shall pay unto the said Gerald\r\nFellcourt Aldclyffe his heirs and assigns the clear yearly rent of ten\r\nshillings and sixpence.... at the several times hereinbefore appointed\r\nfor the payment thereof respectively. And also shall and at all times\r\nduring the said term well and sufficiently repair and keep the said\r\nCottage or Dwelling-house and all other the premises and all houses or\r\nbuildings erected or to be erected thereupon in good and proper repair\r\nin every respect without exception and the said premises in such good\r\nrepair upon the determination of this demise shall yield up unto the\r\nsaid Gerald Fellcourt Aldclyffe his heirs and assigns.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nThey closed the bureau and turned towards the door of the church without\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\nManston also had come forward out of the gloom. Notwithstanding the\r\nfarmer\xe2\x80\x99s own troubles, an instinctive respect and generous sense of\r\nsympathy with the steward for his awful loss caused the old man to step\r\naside, that Manston might pass out without speaking to them if he chose\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is he?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Edward to his father, as Manston approached.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Manston, the steward.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nManston came near, and passed down the aisle on the side of the younger\r\nman. Their faces came almost close together: one large flame, which\r\nstill lingered upon the ruins outside, threw long dancing shadows of\r\neach across the nave till they bent upwards against the aisle wall, and\r\nalso illuminated their eyes, as each met those of the other. Edward had\r\nlearnt, by a letter from home, of the steward\xe2\x80\x99s passion for Cytherea,\r\nand his mysterious repression of it, afterwards explained by his\r\nmarriage. That marriage was now nought. Edward realized the man\xe2\x80\x99s newly\r\nacquired freedom, and felt an instinctive enmity towards him--he would\r\nhardly own to himself why. The steward, too, knew Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s attachment\r\nto Edward, and looked keenly and inscrutably at him.\r\n\r\n7. ONE TO TWO A.M.\r\n\r\nManston went homeward alone, his heart full of strange emotions.\r\nEntering the house, and dismissing the woman to her own home, he at once\r\nproceeded upstairs to his bedroom.\r\n\r\nReasoning worldliness, especially when allied with sensuousness, cannot\r\nrepress on some extreme occasions the human instinct to pour out the\r\nsoul to some Being or Personality, who in frigid moments is dismissed\r\nwith the title of Chance, or at most Law. Manston was selfishly and\r\ninhumanly, but honestly and unutterably, thankful for the recent\r\ncatastrophe. Beside his bed, for that first time during a period\r\nof nearly twenty years, he fell down upon his knees in a passionate\r\noutburst of feeling.\r\n\r\nMany minutes passed before he arose. He walked to the window, and then\r\nseemed to remember for the first time that some action on his part was\r\nnecessary in connection with the sad circumstance of the night.\r\n\r\nLeaving the house at once, he went to the scene of the fire, arriving\r\nthere in time to hear the rector making an arrangement with a certain\r\nnumber of men to watch the spot till morning. The ashes were still\r\nred-hot and flaming. Manston found that nothing could be done towards\r\nsearching them at that hour of the night. He turned homeward again, in\r\nthe company of the rector, who had considerately persuaded him to retire\r\nfrom the scene for a while, and promised that as soon as a man could\r\nlive amid the embers of the Three Tranters Inn, they should be carefully\r\nsearched for the remains of his unfortunate wife.\r\n\r\nManston then went indoors, to wait for morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. THE EVENTS OF FIVE DAYS\r\n\r\n1. NOVEMBER THE TWENTY-NINTH\r\n\r\nThe search began at dawn, but a quarter past nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock came without\r\nbringing any result. Manston ate a little breakfast, and crossed\r\nthe hollow of the park which intervened between the old and modern\r\nmanor-houses, to ask for an interview with Miss Aldclyffe.\r\n\r\nHe met her midway. She was about to pay him a visit of condolence, and\r\nto place every man on the estate at his disposal, that the search\r\nfor any relic of his dead and destroyed wife might not be delayed an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nHe accompanied her back to the house. At first they conversed as if the\r\ndeath of the poor woman was an event which the husband must of necessity\r\ndeeply lament; and when all under this head that social form seemed to\r\nrequire had been uttered, they spoke of the material damage done, and of\r\nthe steps which had better be taken to remedy it.\r\n\r\nIt was not till both were shut inside her private room that she spoke\r\nto him in her blunt and cynical manner. A certain newness of bearing in\r\nhim, peculiar to the present morning, had hitherto forbidden her this\r\ntone: the demeanour of the subject of her favouritism had altered, she\r\ncould not tell in what way. He was entirely a changed man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you really sorry for your poor wife, Mr. Manston?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I am,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But only as for any human being who has met with a violent death?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe confessed it--\xe2\x80\x98For she was not a good woman,\xe2\x80\x99 he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be sorry to say such a thing now the poor creature is dead,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMiss Aldclyffe returned reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked. \xe2\x80\x98Why should I praise her if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve it? I\r\nsay exactly what I have often admired Sterne for saying in one of his\r\nletters--that neither reason nor Scripture asks us to speak nothing but\r\ngood of the dead. And now, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, after a short interval\r\nof thought, \xe2\x80\x98I may, perhaps, hope that you will assist me, or rather not\r\nthwart me, in endeavouring to win the love of a young lady living about\r\nyou, one in whom I am much interested already.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cytherea!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Cytherea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have been loving Cytherea all the while?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSurprise was a preface to much agitation in her, which caused her\r\nto rise from her seat, and pace to the side of the room. The steward\r\nquietly looked on and added, \xe2\x80\x98I have been loving and still love her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe came close up to him, wistfully contemplating his face, one hand\r\nmoving indecisively at her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And your secret marriage was, then, the true and only reason for that\r\nbackwardness regarding the courtship of Cytherea, which, they tell\r\nme, has been the talk of the village; not your indifference to her\r\nattractions.\xe2\x80\x99 Her voice had a tone of conviction in it, as well as of\r\ninquiry; but none of jealousy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98and not a dishonourable one. What held me back was just\r\nthat one thing--a sense of morality that perhaps, madam, you did not\r\ngive me credit for.\xe2\x80\x99 The latter words were spoken with a mien and tone\r\nof pride.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe preserved silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on, \xe2\x80\x98I may as well say a word in vindication of my\r\nconduct lately, at the risk, too, of offending you. My actual motive in\r\nsubmitting to your order that I should send for my late wife, and live\r\nwith her, was not the mercenary policy of wishing to retain an office\r\nwhich brings me greater comforts than any I have enjoyed before, but\r\nthis unquenchable passion for Cytherea. Though I saw the weakness,\r\nfolly, and even wickedness of it continually, it still forced me to try\r\nto continue near her, even as the husband of another woman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe waited for her to speak: she did not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a great obstacle to my making any way in winning Miss Graye\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlove,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Edward Springrove,\xe2\x80\x99 she said quietly. \xe2\x80\x98I know it, I did once want\r\nto see them married; they have had a slight quarrel, and it will soon be\r\nmade up again, unless--\xe2\x80\x99 she spoke as if she had only half attended to\r\nManston\xe2\x80\x99s last statement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is already engaged to be married to somebody else,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nsteward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pooh!\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98you mean to his cousin at Peakhill; that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to\r\nhelp us; he\xe2\x80\x99s now come home to break it off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He must not break it off,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston, firmly and calmly.\r\n\r\nHis tone attracted her, startled her. Recovering herself, she said\r\nhaughtily, \xe2\x80\x98Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s your affair, not mine. Though my wish has been\r\nto see her _your_ wife, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything dishonourable to bring about\r\nsuch a result.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it must be _made_ your affair,\xe2\x80\x99 he said in a hard, steady voice,\r\nlooking into her eyes, as if he saw there the whole panorama of her\r\npast.\r\n\r\nOne of the most difficult things to portray by written words is that\r\npeculiar mixture of moods expressed in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s countenance when, after\r\nhaving been sedulously engaged in establishing another\xe2\x80\x99s position, she\r\nsuddenly suspects him of undermining her own. It was thus that Miss\r\nAldclyffe looked at the steward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You--know--something--of me?\xe2\x80\x99 she faltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know all,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then curse that wife of yours! She wrote and said she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x99 she burst out. \xe2\x80\x98Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she keep her word for a day?\xe2\x80\x99 She\r\nreflected and then said, but no more as to a stranger, \xe2\x80\x98I will not\r\nyield. I have committed no crime. I yielded to her threats in a moment\r\nof weakness, though I felt inclined to defy her at the time: it was\r\nchiefly because I was mystified as to how she got to know of it. Pooh!\r\nI will put up with threats no more. O, can _you_ threaten me?\xe2\x80\x99 she added\r\nsoftly, as if she had for the moment forgotten to whom she had been\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My love must be made your affair,\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated, without taking his eyes\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\nAn agony, which was not the agony of being discovered in a secret,\r\nobstructed her utterance for a time. \xe2\x80\x98How can you turn upon me so when I\r\nschemed to get you here--schemed that you might win her till I found\r\nyou were married. O, how can you! O!... O!\xe2\x80\x99 She wept; and the weeping of\r\nsuch a nature was as harrowing as the weeping of a man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your getting me here was bad policy as to your secret--the most absurd\r\nthing in the world,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, not heeding her distress. \xe2\x80\x98I knew all,\r\nexcept the identity of the individual, long ago. Directly I found that\r\nmy coming here was a contrived thing, and not a matter of chance, it\r\nfixed my attention upon you at once. All that was required was the mere\r\nspark of life, to make of a bundle of perceptions an organic whole.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Policy, how can you talk of policy? Think, do think! And how can you\r\nthreaten me when you know--you know--that I would befriend you readily\r\nwithout a threat!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, I think you would,\xe2\x80\x99 he said more kindly; \xe2\x80\x98but your\r\nindifference for so many, many years has made me doubt it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, not indifference--\xe2\x80\x98twas enforced silence. My father lived.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe took her hand, and held it gently.\r\n\r\n              *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now listen,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, more quietly and humanly, when she had become\r\ncalmer: \xe2\x80\x98Springrove must marry the woman he\xe2\x80\x99s engaged to. You may make\r\nhim, but only in one way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well: but don\xe2\x80\x99t speak sternly, AEneas!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know that his father has not been particularly thriving for the\r\nlast two or three years?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have heard something of it, once or twice, though his rents have been\r\npromptly paid, haven\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes; and do you know the terms of the leases of the houses which are\r\nburnt?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, explaining to her that by those terms she might compel\r\nhim even to rebuild every house. \xe2\x80\x98The case is the clearest case of\r\nfire by negligence that I have ever known, in addition to that,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want them rebuilt; you know it was intended by my father,\r\ndirectly they fell in, to clear the site for a new entrance to the\r\npark?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect the position, which is that Farmer\r\nSpringrove is in your power to an extent which is very serious for him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t do it--\xe2\x80\x98tis a conspiracy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t you for me?\xe2\x80\x99 he said eagerly.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe changed colour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t threaten now, I implore,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because you might threaten if you chose,\xe2\x80\x99 she mournfully answered. \xe2\x80\x98But\r\nwhy be so--when your marriage with her was my own pet idea long before\r\nit was yours? What must I do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Scarcely anything: simply this. When I have seen old Mr. Springrove,\r\nwhich I shall do in a day or two, and told him that he will be expected\r\nto rebuild the houses, do you see the young man. See him yourself, in\r\norder that the proposals made may not appear to be anything more than an\r\nimpulse of your own. You or he will bring up the subject of the houses.\r\nTo rebuild them would be a matter of at least six hundred pounds, and\r\nhe will almost surely say that we are hard in insisting upon the extreme\r\nletter of the leases. Then tell him that scarcely can you yourself\r\nthink of compelling an old tenant like his father to any such painful\r\nextreme--there shall be no compulsion to build, simply a surrender of\r\nthe leases. Then speak feelingly of his cousin, as a woman whom you\r\nrespect and love, and whose secret you have learnt to be that she is\r\nheart-sick with hope deferred. Beg him to marry her, his betrothed and\r\nyour friend, as some return for your consideration towards his father.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t suggest too early a day for their marriage, or he will suspect you\r\nof some motive beyond womanly sympathy. Coax him to make a promise to\r\nher that she shall be his wife at the end of a twelvemonth, and get him,\r\non assenting to this, to write to Cytherea, entirely renouncing her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She has already asked him to do that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So much the better--and telling her, too, that he is about to fulfil\r\nhis long-standing promise to marry his cousin. If you think it worth\r\nwhile, you may say Cytherea was not indisposed to think of me before she\r\nknew I was married. I have at home a note she wrote me the first evening\r\nI saw her, which looks rather warm, and which I could show you. Trust\r\nme, he will give her up. When he is married to Adelaide Hinton, Cytherea\r\nwill be induced to marry me--perhaps before; a woman\xe2\x80\x99s pride is soon\r\nwounded.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I better write to Mr. Nyttleton, and inquire more\r\nparticularly what\xe2\x80\x99s the law upon the houses?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no, there\xe2\x80\x99s no hurry for that. We know well enough how the case\r\nstands--quite well enough to talk in general terms about it. And I want\r\nthe pressure to be put upon young Springrove before he goes away from\r\nhome again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked at him furtively, long, and sadly, as after speaking he\r\nbecame lost in thought, his eyes listlessly tracing the pattern of the\r\ncarpet. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, she will be mine,\xe2\x80\x99 he whispered, careless of Cytherea\r\nAldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s presence. At last he raised his eyes inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will do my best, AEneas,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered.\r\n\r\nTalibus incusat. Manston then left the house, and again went towards the\r\nblackened ruins, where men were still raking and probing.\r\n\r\n2. FROM NOVEMBER THE TWENTY-NINTH TO DECEMBER THE SECOND\r\n\r\nThe smouldering remnants of the Three Tranters Inn seemed to promise\r\nthat, even when the searchers should light upon the remains of the\r\nunfortunate Mrs. Manston, very little would be discoverable.\r\n\r\nConsisting so largely of the charcoal and ashes of hard dry oak and\r\nchestnut, intermingled with thatch, the interior of the heap was one\r\nglowing mass of embers, which, on being stirred about, emitted sparks\r\nand flame long after it was dead and black on the outside. It was\r\npersistently hoped, however, that some traces of the body would survive\r\nthe effect of the hot coals, and after a search pursued uninterruptedly\r\nfor thirty hours, under the direction of Manston himself, enough was\r\nfound to set at rest any doubts of her fate.\r\n\r\nThe melancholy gleanings consisted of her watch, bunch of keys, a few\r\ncoins, and two charred and blackened bones.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the official inquiry into the cause of her death was held\r\nat the Rising Sun Inn, before Mr. Floy, the coroner, and a jury of the\r\nchief inhabitants of the district. The little tavern--the only remaining\r\none in the village--was crowded to excess by the neighbouring peasantry\r\nas well as their richer employers: all who could by any possibility\r\nobtain an hour\xe2\x80\x99s release from their duties being present as listeners.\r\n\r\nThe jury viewed the sad and infinitesimal remains, which were folded in\r\na white cambric cloth, and laid in the middle of a well-finished coffin\r\nlined with white silk (by Manston\xe2\x80\x99s order), which stood in an adjoining\r\nroom, the bulk of the coffin being completely filled in with carefully\r\narranged flowers and evergreens--also the steward\xe2\x80\x99s own doing.\r\n\r\nAbraham Brown, of Hoxton, London--an old white-headed man, without the\r\nruddiness which makes white hairs so pleasing--was sworn, and deposed\r\nthat he kept a lodging-house at an address he named. On a Saturday\r\nevening less than a month before the fire, a lady came to him, with very\r\nlittle luggage, and took the front room on the second floor. He did not\r\ninquire where she came from, as she paid a week in advance, but she gave\r\nher name as Mrs. Manston, referring him, if he wished for any guarantee\r\nof her respectability, to Mr. Manston, Knapwater Park. Here she lived\r\nfor three weeks, rarely going out. She slept away from her lodgings one\r\nnight during the time. At the end of that time, on the twenty-eighth of\r\nNovember, she left his house in a four-wheeled cab, about twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nin the day, telling the driver to take her to the Waterloo Station. She\r\npaid all her lodging expenses, and not having given notice the full week\r\nprevious to her going away, offered to pay for the next, but he only\r\ntook half. She wore a thick black veil, and grey waterproof cloak, when\r\nshe left him, and her luggage was two boxes, one of plain deal, with\r\nblack japanned clamps, the other sewn up in canvas.\r\n\r\nJoseph Chinney, porter at the Carriford Road Station, deposed that he\r\nsaw Mrs. Manston, dressed as the last witness had described, get out\r\nof a second-class carriage on the night of the twenty-eighth. She stood\r\nbeside him whilst her luggage was taken from the van. The luggage,\r\nconsisting of the clamped deal box and another covered with canvas, was\r\nplaced in the cloak-room. She seemed at a loss at finding nobody there\r\nto meet her. She asked him for some person to accompany her, and carry\r\nher bag to Mr. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s house, Knapwater Park. He was just off duty\r\nat that time, and offered to go himself. The witness here repeated\r\nthe conversation he had had with Mrs. Manston during their walk, and\r\ntestified to having left her at the door of the Three Tranters Inn, Mr.\r\nManston\xe2\x80\x99s house being closed.\r\n\r\nNext, Farmer Springrove was called. A murmur of surprise and\r\ncommiseration passed round the crowded room when he stepped forward.\r\n\r\nThe events of the few preceding days had so worked upon his nervously\r\nthoughtful nature that the blue orbits of his eyes, and the mere spot of\r\nscarlet to which the ruddiness of his cheeks had contracted, seemed the\r\nresult of a heavy sickness. A perfect silence pervaded the assembly when\r\nhe spoke.\r\n\r\nHis statement was that he received Mrs. Manston at the threshold, and\r\nasked her to enter the parlour. She would not do so, and stood in the\r\npassage whilst the maid went upstairs to see that the room was in order.\r\nThe maid came down to the middle landing of the staircase, when Mrs.\r\nManston followed her up to the room. He did not speak ten words with her\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, whilst he was standing at the door listening for his son\r\nEdward\xe2\x80\x99s return, he saw her light extinguished, having first caught\r\nsight of her shadow moving about the room.\r\n\r\nTHE CORONER: \xe2\x80\x98Did her shadow appear to be that of a woman undressing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSPRINGROVE: \xe2\x80\x98I cannot say, as I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take particular notice. It moved\r\nbackwards and forwards; she might have been undressing or merely pacing\r\nup and down the room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Fitler, the ostler\xe2\x80\x99s wife and chambermaid, said that she preceded\r\nMrs. Manston into the room, put down the candle, and went out. Mrs.\r\nManston scarcely spoke to her, except to ask her to bring a little\r\nbrandy. Witness went and fetched it from the bar, brought it up, and put\r\nit on the dressing-table.\r\n\r\nTHE CORONER: \xe2\x80\x98Had Mrs. Manston begun to undress, when you came back?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir; she was sitting on the bed, with everything on, as when she\r\ncame in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did she begin to undress before you left?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not exactly before I had left; but when I had closed the door, and was\r\non the landing I heard her boot drop on the floor, as it does sometimes\r\nwhen pulled off?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Had her face appeared worn and sleepy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot say as her bonnet and veil were still on when I left, for she\r\nseemed rather shy and ashamed to be seen at the Three Tranters at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And did you hear or see any more of her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No more, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Crickett, temporary servant to Mr. Manston, said that in accordance\r\nwith Mr. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s orders, everything had been made comfortable in the\r\nhouse for Mrs. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s expected return on Monday night. Mr. Manston\r\ntold her that himself and Mrs. Manston would be home late, not till\r\nbetween eleven and twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and that supper was to be ready. Not\r\nexpecting Mrs. Manston so early, she had gone out on a very important\r\nerrand to Mrs. Leat the postmistress.\r\n\r\nMr. Manston deposed that in looking down the columns of Bradshaw he\r\nhad mistaken the time of the train\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, and hence was not at the\r\nstation when she came. The broken watch produced was his wife\xe2\x80\x99s--he knew\r\nit by a scratch on the inner plate, and by other signs. The bunch of\r\nkeys belonged to her: two of them fitted the locks of her two boxes.\r\n\r\nMr. Flooks, agent to Lord Claydonfield at Chettlewood, said that Mr.\r\nManston had pleaded as his excuse for leaving him rather early in the\r\nevening after their day\xe2\x80\x99s business had been settled, that he was going\r\nto meet his wife at Carriford Road Station, where she was coming by the\r\nlast train that night.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon said that the remains were those of a human being. The small\r\nfragment seemed a portion of one of the lumbar vertebrae--the other\r\nthe head of the os femoris--but they were both so far gone that it was\r\nimpossible to say definitely whether they belonged to the body of a male\r\nor female. There was no moral doubt that they were a woman\xe2\x80\x99s. He did\r\nnot believe that death resulted from burning by fire. He thought she was\r\ncrushed by the fall of the west gable, which being of wood, as well as\r\nthe floor, burnt after it had fallen, and consumed the body with it.\r\n\r\nTwo or three additional witnesses gave unimportant testimony.\r\n\r\nThe coroner summed up, and the jury without hesitation found that the\r\ndeceased Mrs. Manston came by her death accidentally through the burning\r\nof the Three Tranters Inn.\r\n\r\n3. DECEMBER THE SECOND. AFTERNOON\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Springrove came from the door of the Rising Sun at the end of\r\nthe inquiry, Manston walked by his side as far as the stile to the park,\r\na distance of about a stone\xe2\x80\x99s-throw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, Mr. Springrove, this is a sad affair for everybody concerned.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everybody,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old farmer, with deep sadness, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99tis quite a\r\nmisery to me. I hardly know how I shall live through each day as it\r\nbreaks. I think of the words, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the morning thou shalt say, Would God\r\nit were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for\r\nthe fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of\r\nthine eyes which thou shalt see.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 His voice became broken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--true. I read Deuteronomy myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But my loss is as nothing to yours,\xe2\x80\x99 the farmer continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing; but I can commiserate you. I should be worse than unfeeling\r\nif I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, although my own affliction is of so sad and solemn a kind.\r\nIndeed my own loss makes me more keenly alive to yours, different in\r\nnature as it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What sum do you think would be required of me to put the houses in\r\nplace again?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have roughly thought six or seven hundred pounds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If the letter of the law is to be acted up to,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man, with\r\nmore agitation in his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, exactly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know enough of Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s mind to give me an idea of how\r\nshe means to treat me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I am afraid I must tell you that though I know very little of her\r\nmind as a rule, in this matter I believe she will be rather peremptory;\r\nshe might share to the extent of a sixth or an eighth perhaps, in\r\nconsideration of her getting new lamps for old, but I should hardly\r\nthink more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe steward stepped upon the stile, and Mr. Springrove went along the\r\nroad with a bowed head and heavy footsteps towards his niece\xe2\x80\x99s cottage,\r\nin which, rather against the wish of Edward, they had temporarily taken\r\nrefuge.\r\n\r\nThe additional weight of this knowledge soon made itself perceptible.\r\nThough indoors with Edward or Adelaide nearly the whole of the\r\nafternoon, nothing more than monosyllabic replies could be drawn from\r\nhim. Edward continually discovered him looking fixedly at the wall or\r\nfloor, quite unconscious of another\xe2\x80\x99s presence. At supper he ate just as\r\nusual, but quite mechanically, and with the same abstraction.\r\n\r\n4. DECEMBER THE THIRD\r\n\r\nThe next morning he was in no better spirits. Afternoon came: his son\r\nwas alarmed, and managed to draw from him an account of the conversation\r\nwith the steward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense; he knows nothing about it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward vehemently. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll see\r\nMiss Aldclyffe myself. Now promise me, father, that you\xe2\x80\x99ll not believe\r\ntill I come back, and tell you to believe it, that Miss Aldclyffe will\r\ndo any such unjust thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEdward started at once for Knapwater House. He strode rapidly along the\r\nhigh-road, till he reached a wicket where a footpath allowed of a short\r\ncut to the mansion. Here he leant down upon the bars for a few minutes,\r\nmeditating as to the best manner of opening his speech, and surveying\r\nthe scene before him in that absent mood which takes cognizance of\r\nlittle things without being conscious of them at the time, though they\r\nappear in the eye afterwards as vivid impressions. It was a yellow,\r\nlustrous, late autumn day, one of those days of the quarter when morning\r\nand evening seem to meet together without the intervention of a noon.\r\nThe clear yellow sunlight had tempted forth Miss Aldclyffe herself, who\r\nwas at this same time taking a walk in the direction of the village.\r\nAs Springrove lingered he heard behind the plantation a woman\xe2\x80\x99s dress\r\nbrushing along amid the prickly husks and leaves which had fallen into\r\nthe path from the boughs of the chestnut trees. In another minute she\r\nstood in front of him.\r\n\r\nHe answered her casual greeting respectfully, and was about to request\r\na few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 conversation with her, when she directly addressed him\r\non the subject of the fire. \xe2\x80\x98It is a sad misfortune for your father\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98and I hear that he has lately let his insurances expire?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has, madam, and you are probably aware that either by the general\r\nterms of his holding, or the same coupled with the origin of the fire,\r\nthe disaster may involve the necessity of his rebuilding the whole row\r\nof houses, or else of becoming a debtor to the estate, to the extent of\r\nsome hundreds of pounds?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe assented. \xe2\x80\x98I have been thinking of it,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on, and then\r\nrepeated in substance the words put into her mouth by the steward.\r\nSome disturbance of thought might have been fancied as taking place in\r\nSpringrove\xe2\x80\x99s mind during her statement, but before she had reached the\r\nend, his eyes were clear, and directed upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t accept your conditions of release,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are not conditions exactly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, whatever they are not, they are very uncalled-for remarks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all--the houses have been burnt by your family\xe2\x80\x99s negligence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t refer to the houses--you have of course the best of all rights\r\nto speak of that matter; but you, a stranger to me comparatively, have\r\nno right at all to volunteer opinions and wishes upon a very delicate\r\nsubject, which concerns no living beings but Miss Graye, Miss Hinton,\r\nand myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe, like a good many others in her position, had plainly\r\nnot realized that a son of her tenant and inferior could have become an\r\neducated man, who had learnt to feel his individuality, to view society\r\nfrom a Bohemian standpoint, far outside the farming grade in Carriford\r\nparish, and that hence he had all a developed man\xe2\x80\x99s unorthodox opinion\r\nabout the subordination of classes. And fully conscious of the labyrinth\r\ninto which he had wandered between his wish to behave honourably in the\r\ndilemma of his engagement to his cousin Adelaide and the intensity of\r\nhis love for Cytherea, Springrove was additionally sensitive to any\r\nallusion to the case. He had spoken to Miss Aldclyffe with considerable\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\nAnd Miss Aldclyffe was not a woman likely to be far behind any second\r\nperson in warming to a mood of defiance. It seemed as if she were\r\nprepared to put up with a cold refusal, but that her haughtiness\r\nresented a criticism of her conduct ending in a rebuke. By this,\r\nManston\xe2\x80\x99s discreditable object, which had been made hers by compulsion\r\nonly, was now adopted by choice. She flung herself into the work.\r\n\r\nA fiery man in such a case would have relinquished persuasion and tried\r\npalpable force. A fiery woman added unscrupulousness and evolved daring\r\nstrategy; and in her obstinacy, and to sustain herself as mistress, she\r\ndescended to an action the meanness of which haunted her conscience to\r\nher dying hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see, Mr. Springrove,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98that I am altogether\r\nwhat you are pleased to call a stranger. I have known your family, at\r\nany rate, for a good many years, and I know Miss Graye particularly\r\nwell, and her state of mind with regard to this matter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPerplexed love makes us credulous and curious as old women. Edward was\r\nwilling, he owned it to himself, to get at Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind,\r\neven through so dangerous a medium.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A letter I received from her\xe2\x80\x99 he said, with assumed coldness, \xe2\x80\x98tells me\r\nclearly enough what Miss Graye\xe2\x80\x99s mind is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think she still loves you? O yes, of course you do--all men are\r\nlike that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have reason to.\xe2\x80\x99 He could feign no further than the first speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be interested in knowing what reason?\xe2\x80\x99 she said, with\r\nsarcastic archness.\r\n\r\nEdward felt he was allowing her to do, in fractional parts, what he\r\nrebelled against when regarding it as a whole; but the fact that his\r\nantagonist had the presence of a queen, and features only in the early\r\nevening of their beauty, was not without its influence upon a keenly\r\nconscious man. Her bearing had charmed him into toleration, as Mary\r\nStuart\xe2\x80\x99s charmed the indignant Puritan visitors. He again answered her\r\nhonestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The best of reasons--the tone of her letter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pooh, Mr. Springrove!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all, Miss Aldclyffe! Miss Graye desired that we should be\r\nstrangers to each other for the simple practical reason that intimacy\r\ncould only make wretched complications worse, not from lack of\r\nlove--love is only suppressed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know yet, that in thus putting aside a man, a woman\xe2\x80\x99s pity\r\nfor the pain she inflicts gives her a kindness of tone which is\r\noften mistaken for suppressed love?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe, with soft\r\ninsidiousness.\r\n\r\nThis was a translation of the ambiguity of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s tone which he had\r\ncertainly never thought of; and he was too ingenuous not to own it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had never thought of it,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not unless there was some other evidence to support the view.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe paused a minute and then began hesitatingly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My intention was--what I did not dream of owning to you--my intention\r\nwas to try to induce you to fulfil your promise to Miss Hinton not\r\nsolely on her account and yours (though partly). I love Cytherea Graye\r\nwith all my soul, and I want to see her happy even more than I do you. I\r\ndid not mean to drag her name into the affair at all, but I am driven\r\nto say that she wrote that letter of dismissal to you--for it was a\r\nmost pronounced dismissal--not on account of your engagement. She is old\r\nenough to know that engagements can be broken as easily as they can be\r\nmade. She wrote it because she loved another man; very suddenly, and not\r\nwith any idea or hope of marrying him, but none the less deeply.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Manston.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good--! I can\xe2\x80\x99t listen to you for an instant, madam; why, she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseen him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She had; he came here the day before she wrote to you; and I could\r\nprove to you, if it were worth while, that on that day she went\r\nvoluntarily to his house, though not artfully or blamably; stayed for\r\ntwo hours playing and singing; that no sooner did she leave him than she\r\nwent straight home, and wrote the letter saying she should not see you\r\nagain, entirely because she had seen him and fallen desperately in love\r\nwith him--a perfectly natural thing for a young girl to do, considering\r\nthat he\xe2\x80\x99s the handsomest man in the county. Why else should she not have\r\nwritten to you before?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I was such a--because she did not know of the connection\r\nbetween me and my cousin until then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must think she did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On what ground?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On the strong ground of my having told her so, distinctly, the very\r\nfirst day she came to live with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, what do you seek to impress upon me after all? This--that the\r\nday Miss Graye wrote to me, saying it was better that we should part,\r\ncoincided with the day she had seen a certain man--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A remarkably handsome and talented man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I admit that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And that it coincided with the hour just subsequent to her seeing him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, just when she had seen him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And been to his house alone with him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And stayed there playing and singing with him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Admit that, too,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98an accident might have caused it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And at the same instant that she wrote your dismissal she wrote a\r\nletter referring to a secret appointment with him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never, by God, madam! never!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you say, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe sneered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s no accounting for beliefs, and the whole history is a very\r\ntrivial matter; but I am resolved to prove that a lady\xe2\x80\x99s word is\r\ntruthful, though upon a matter which concerns neither you nor herself.\r\nYou shall learn that she _did_ write him a letter concerning an\r\nassignation--that is, if Mr. Manston still has it, and will be\r\nconsiderate enough to lend it me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But besides,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Edward, \xe2\x80\x98a married man to do what would cause a\r\nyoung girl to write a note of the kind you mention!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe flushed a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about,\xe2\x80\x99 she stammered. \xe2\x80\x98But Cytherea didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nof course, dream any more than I did, or others in the parish, that he\r\nwas married.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course she didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I have reason to believe that he told her of the fact directly\r\nafterwards, that she might not compromise herself, or allow him to.\r\nIt is notorious that he struggled honestly and hard against her\r\nattractions, and succeeded in hiding his feelings, if not in quenching\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll hope that he did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But circumstances are changed now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very greatly changed,\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured abstractedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must remember,\xe2\x80\x99 she added more suasively, \xe2\x80\x98that Miss Graye has a\r\nperfect right to do what she likes with her own--her heart, that is to\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer descent from irritation was caused by perceiving that Edward\xe2\x80\x99s faith\r\nwas really disturbed by her strong assertions, and it gratified her.\r\n\r\nEdward\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts flew to his father, and the object of his interview\r\nwith her. Tongue-fencing was utterly distasteful to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not trouble you by remaining longer, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 he remarked,\r\ngloomily; \xe2\x80\x98our conversation has ended sadly for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t think so,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98and don\xe2\x80\x99t be mistaken. I am older than you\r\nare, many years older, and I know many things.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nFull of miserable doubt, and bitterly regretting that he had raised his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s expectations by anticipations impossible of fulfilment, Edward\r\nslowly went his way into the village, and approached his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\nThe farmer was at the door looking eagerly for him. He had been waiting\r\nthere for more than half-an-hour. His eye kindled quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Ted, what does she say?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked, in the intensely sanguine\r\ntones which fall sadly upon a listener\xe2\x80\x99s ear, because, antecedently,\r\nthey raise pictures of inevitable disappointment for the speaker, in\r\nsome direction or another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing for us to be alarmed at,\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward, with a forced\r\ncheerfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But must we rebuild?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It seems we must, father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes swept the horizon, then he turned to go in, without\r\nmaking another observation. All light seemed extinguished in him again.\r\nWhen Edward went in he found his father with the bureau open, unfolding\r\nthe leases with a shaking hand, folding them up again without reading\r\nthem, then putting them in their niche only to remove them again.\r\n\r\nAdelaide was in the room. She said thoughtfully to Edward, as she\r\nwatched the farmer--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope it won\xe2\x80\x99t kill poor uncle, Edward. What should we do if anything\r\nwere to happen to him? He is the only near relative you and I have in\r\nthe world.\xe2\x80\x99 It was perfectly true, and somehow Edward felt more bound up\r\nwith her after that remark.\r\n\r\nShe continued: \xe2\x80\x98And he was only saying so hopefully the day before the\r\nfire, that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t for the world let any one else give me away to\r\nyou when we are married.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor the first time a conscientious doubt arose in Edward\xe2\x80\x99s mind as to\r\nthe justice of the course he was pursuing in resolving to refuse the\r\nalternative offered by Miss Aldclyffe. Could it be selfishness as well\r\nas independence? How much he had thought of his own heart, how little he\r\nhad thought of his father\xe2\x80\x99s peace of mind!\r\n\r\nThe old man did not speak again till supper-time, when he began asking\r\nhis son an endless number of hypothetical questions on what might induce\r\nMiss Aldclyffe to listen to kinder terms; speaking of her now not as an\r\nunfair woman, but as a Lachesis or Fate whose course it behoved nobody\r\nto condemn. In his earnestness he once turned his eyes on Edward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface: their expression was woful: the pupils were dilated and strange in\r\naspect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If she will only agree to that!\xe2\x80\x99 he reiterated for the hundredth time,\r\nincreasing the sadness of his listeners.\r\n\r\nAn aristocratic knocking came to the door, and Jane entered with a\r\nletter, addressed--\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x98MR. EDWARD SPRINGROVE, Junior.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charles from Knapwater House brought it,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s writing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Springrove, before Edward had\r\nrecognized it himself. \xe2\x80\x98Now \xe2\x80\x98tis all right; she\xe2\x80\x99s going to make an\r\noffer; she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want the houses there, not she; they are going to\r\nmake that the way into the park.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEdward opened the seal and glanced at the inside. He said, with a\r\nsupreme effort of self-command--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is only directed by Miss Aldclyffe, and refers to nothing connected\r\nwith the fire. I wonder at her taking the trouble to send it to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis father looked absently at him and turned away again. Shortly\r\nafterwards they retired for the night. Alone in his bedroom Edward\r\nopened and read what he had not dared to refer to in their presence.\r\n\r\nThe envelope contained another envelope in Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting,\r\naddressed to \xe2\x80\x98---- Manston, Esq., Old Manor House.\xe2\x80\x99 Inside this was the\r\nnote she had written to the steward after her detention in his house by\r\nthe thunderstorm--\r\n\r\n\r\n                     \xe2\x80\x98KNAPWATER HOUSE,\r\n                          September 20th.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I find I cannot meet you at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock by the waterfall as I\r\npromised. The emotion I felt made me forgetful of realities.                                             \xe2\x80\x98C. GRAYE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe had not written a line, and, by the unvarying rule\r\nobservable when words are not an absolute necessity, her silence seemed\r\nten times as convincing as any expression of opinion could have been.\r\n\r\nHe then, step by step, recalled all the conversation on the subject of\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s feelings that had passed between himself and Miss Aldclyffe\r\nin the afternoon, and by a confusion of thought, natural enough under\r\nthe trying experience, concluded that because the lady was truthful\r\nin her portraiture of effects, she must necessarily be right in her\r\nassumption of causes. That is, he was convinced that Cytherea--the\r\nhitherto-believed faithful Cytherea--had, at any rate, looked with\r\nsomething more than indifference upon the extremely handsome face and\r\nform of Manston.\r\n\r\nDid he blame her, as guilty of the impropriety of allowing herself to\r\nlove the newcomer in the face of his not being free to return her love?\r\nNo; never for a moment did he doubt that all had occurred in her\r\nold, innocent, impulsive way; that her heart was gone before she knew\r\nit--before she knew anything, beyond his existence, of the man to whom\r\nit had flown. Perhaps the very note enclosed to him was the result\r\nof first reflection. Manston he would unhesitatingly have called a\r\nscoundrel, but for one strikingly redeeming fact. It had been patent\r\nto the whole parish, and had come to Edward\xe2\x80\x99s own knowledge by that\r\nindirect channel, that Manston, as a married man, conscientiously\r\navoided Cytherea after those first few days of his arrival during which\r\nher irresistibly beautiful and fatal glances had rested upon him--his\r\nupon her.\r\n\r\nTaking from his coat a creased and pocket-worn envelope containing\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s letter to himself, Springrove opened it and read it through.\r\nHe was upbraided therein, and he was dismissed. It bore the date of the\r\nletter sent to Manston, and by containing within it the phrase, \xe2\x80\x98All the\r\nday long I have been thinking,\xe2\x80\x99 afforded justifiable ground for assuming\r\nthat it was written subsequently to the other (and in Edward\xe2\x80\x99s sight far\r\nsweeter one) to the steward.\r\n\r\nBut though he accused her of fickleness, he would not doubt the\r\ngenuineness, in its kind, of her partiality for him at Budmouth. It was\r\na short and shallow feeling--not perfect love:\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x98Love is not love\r\n   Which alters when it alteration finds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut it was not flirtation; a feeling had been born in her and had died.\r\nIt would be well for his peace of mind if his love for her could flit\r\naway so softly, and leave so few traces behind.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe had shown herself desperately concerned in the whole\r\nmatter by the alacrity with which she had obtained the letter from\r\nManston, and her labours to induce himself to marry his cousin. Taken in\r\nconnection with her apparent interest in, if not love for, Cytherea, her\r\neagerness, too, could only be accounted for on the ground that Cytherea\r\nindeed loved the steward.\r\n\r\n5. DECEMBER THE FOURTH\r\n\r\nEdward passed the night he scarcely knew how, tossing feverishly from\r\nside to side, the blood throbbing in his temples, and singing in his\r\nears.\r\n\r\nBefore the day began to break he dressed himself. On going out upon\r\nthe landing he found his father\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom door already open. Edward\r\nconcluded that the old man had risen softly, as was his wont, and gone\r\nout into the fields to start the labourers. But neither of the outer\r\ndoors was unfastened. He entered the front room, and found it empty.\r\nThen animated by a new idea, he went round to the little back parlour,\r\nin which the few wrecks saved from the fire were deposited, and looked\r\nin at the door. Here, near the window, the shutters of which had been\r\nopened half way, he saw his father leaning on the bureau, his elbows\r\nresting on the flap, his body nearly doubled, his hands clasping his\r\nforehead. Beside him were ghostly-looking square folds of parchment--the\r\nleases of the houses destroyed.\r\n\r\nHis father looked up when Edward entered, and wearily spoke to the young\r\nman as his face came into the faint light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Edward, why did you get up so early?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was uneasy, and could not sleep.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe farmer turned again to the leases on the bureau, and seemed to\r\nbecome lost in reflection. In a minute or two, without lifting his eyes,\r\nhe said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is more than we can bear, Ted--more than we can bear! Ted, this\r\nwill kill me. Not the loss only--the sense of my neglect about the\r\ninsurance and everything. Borrow I never will. \xe2\x80\x98Tis all misery now. God\r\nhelp us--all misery now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEdward did not answer, continuing to look fixedly at the dreary daylight\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ted,\xe2\x80\x99 the farmer went on, \xe2\x80\x98this upset of be-en burnt out o\xe2\x80\x99 home makes\r\nme very nervous and doubtful about everything. There\xe2\x80\x99s this troubles me\r\nbesides--our liven here with your cousin, and fillen up her house. It\r\nmust be very awkward for her. But she says she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. Have you\r\nsaid anything to her lately about when you are going to marry her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing at all lately.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, perhaps you may as well, now we are so mixed in together. You\r\nknow, no time has ever been mentioned to her at all, first or last,\r\nand I think it right that now, since she has waited so patiently and so\r\nlong--you are almost called upon to say you are ready. It would simplify\r\nmatters very much, if you were to walk up to church wi\xe2\x80\x99 her one of these\r\nmornings, get the thing done, and go on liven here as we are. If you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t I must get a house all the sooner. It would lighten my mind, too,\r\nabout the two little freeholds over the hill--not a morsel a-piece,\r\ndivided as they were between her mother and me, but a tidy bit tied\r\ntogether again. Just think about it, will ye, Ted?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe stopped from exhaustion produced by the intense concentration of his\r\nmind upon the weary subject, and looked anxiously at his son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I will,\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I am going to see her of the Great House this morning,\xe2\x80\x99 the farmer\r\nwent on, his thoughts reverting to the old subject. \xe2\x80\x98I must know the\r\nrights of the matter, the when and the where. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like seeing her,\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99d rather talk to her than the steward. I wonder what she\xe2\x80\x99ll say to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe younger man knew exactly what she would say. If his father asked her\r\nwhat he was to do, and when, she would simply refer him to Manston: her\r\ncharacter was not that of a woman who shrank from a proposition she had\r\nonce laid down. If his father were to say to her that his son had at\r\nlast resolved to marry his cousin within the year, and had given her a\r\npromise to that effect, she would say, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Springrove, the houses are\r\nburnt: we\xe2\x80\x99ll let them go: trouble no more about them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis mind was already made up. He said calmly, \xe2\x80\x98Father, when you are\r\ntalking to Miss Aldclyffe, mention to her that I have asked Adelaide if\r\nshe is willing to marry me next Christmas. She is interested in my union\r\nwith Adelaide, and the news will be welcome to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And yet she can be iron with reference to me and her property,\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nfarmer murmured. \xe2\x80\x98Very well, Ted, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n6. DECEMBER THE FIFTH\r\n\r\nOf the many contradictory particulars constituting a woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart, two\r\nhad shown their vigorous contrast in Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s bosom just at this time.\r\n\r\nIt was a dark morning, the morning after old Mr. Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s visit\r\nto Miss Aldclyffe, which had terminated as Edward had intended. Having\r\nrisen an hour earlier than was usual with her, Cytherea sat at the\r\nwindow of an elegant little sitting-room on the ground floor, which had\r\nbeen appropriated to her by the kindness or whim of Miss Aldclyffe, that\r\nshe might not be driven into that lady\xe2\x80\x99s presence against her will. She\r\nleant with her face on her hand, looking out into the gloomy grey air.\r\nA yellow glimmer from the flapping flame of the newly-lit fire fluttered\r\non one side of her face and neck like a butterfly about to settle there,\r\ncontrasting warmly with the other side of the same fair face, which\r\nreceived from the window the faint cold morning light, so weak that her\r\nshadow from the fire had a distinct outline on the window-shutter in\r\nspite of it. There the shadow danced like a demon, blue and grim.\r\n\r\nThe contradiction alluded to was that in spite of the decisive\r\nmood which two months earlier in the year had caused her to write a\r\nperemptory and final letter to Edward, she was now hoping for some\r\nanswer other than the only possible one a man who, as she held, did not\r\nlove her wildly, could send to such a communication. For a lover who\r\ndid love wildly, she had left one little loophole in her otherwise\r\nstraightforward epistle. Why she expected the letter on some morning of\r\nthis particular week was, that hearing of his return to Carriford, she\r\nfondly assumed that he meant to ask for an interview before he left.\r\nHence it was, too, that for the last few days, she had not been able to\r\nkeep in bed later than the time of the postman\xe2\x80\x99s arrival.\r\n\r\nThe clock pointed to half-past seven. She saw the postman emerge from\r\nbeneath the bare boughs of the park trees, come through the wicket, dive\r\nthrough the shrubbery, reappear on the lawn, stalk across it without\r\nreference to paths--as country postmen do--and come to the porch. She\r\nheard him fling the bag down on the seat, and turn away towards the\r\nvillage, without hindering himself for a single pace.\r\n\r\nThen the butler opened the door, took up the bag, brought it in, and\r\ncarried it up the staircase to place it on the slab by Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndressing-room door. The whole proceeding had been depicted by sounds.\r\n\r\nShe had a presentiment that her letter was in the bag at last. She\r\nthought then in diminishing pulsations of confidence, \xe2\x80\x98He asks to see\r\nme! Perhaps he asks to see me: I hope he asks to see me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA quarter to eight: Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s bell--rather earlier than usual.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She must have heard the post-bag brought,\xe2\x80\x99 said the maiden, as,\r\ntired of the chilly prospect outside, she turned to the fire, and drew\r\nimaginative pictures of her future therein.\r\n\r\nA tap came to the door, and the lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Aldclyffe is awake,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98and she asked if you were moving\r\nyet, miss.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll run up to her,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, and flitted off with the utterance\r\nof the words. \xe2\x80\x98Very fortunate this,\xe2\x80\x99 she thought; \xe2\x80\x98I shall see what is\r\nin the bag this morning all the sooner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe took it up from the side table, went into Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom,\r\npulled up the blinds, and looked round upon the lady in bed, calculating\r\nthe minutes that must elapse before she looked at her letters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, darling, how are you? I am glad you have come in to see me,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Miss Aldclyffe. \xe2\x80\x98You can unlock the bag this morning, child, if you\r\nlike,\xe2\x80\x99 she continued, yawning factitiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Strange!\xe2\x80\x99 Cytherea thought; \xe2\x80\x98it seems as if she knew there was likely\r\nto be a letter for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFrom her bed Miss Aldclyffe watched the girl\xe2\x80\x99s face as she tremblingly\r\nopened the post-bag and found there an envelope addressed to her in\r\nEdward\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting; one he had written the day before, after the\r\ndecision he had come to on an impartial, and on that account torturing,\r\nsurvey of his own, his father\xe2\x80\x99s, his cousin Adelaide\xe2\x80\x99s, and what he\r\nbelieved to be Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s, position.\r\n\r\nThe haughty mistress\xe2\x80\x99s soul sickened remorsefully within her when she\r\nsaw suddenly appear upon the speaking countenance of the young lady\r\nbefore her a wan desolate look of agony.\r\n\r\nThe master-sentences of Edward\xe2\x80\x99s letter were these: \xe2\x80\x98You speak truly.\r\nThat we never meet again is the wisest and only proper course. That I\r\nregret the past as much as you do yourself, it is hardly necessary for\r\nme to say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. THE EVENTS OF TEN MONTHS\r\n\r\n1. DECEMBER TO APRIL\r\n\r\nWeek after week, month after month, the time had flown by. Christmas had\r\npassed; dreary winter with dark evenings had given place to more dreary\r\nwinter with light evenings. Thaws had ended in rain, rain in wind,\r\nwind in dust. Showery days had come--the period of pink dawns and white\r\nsunsets; with the third week in April the cuckoo had appeared, with the\r\nfourth, the nightingale.\r\n\r\nEdward Springrove was in London, attending to the duties of his\r\nnew office, and it had become known throughout the neighbourhood of\r\nCarriford that the engagement between himself and Miss Adelaide Hinton\r\nwould terminate in marriage at the end of the year.\r\n\r\nThe only occasion on which her lover of the idle delicious days at\r\nBudmouth watering-place had been seen by Cytherea after the time of the\r\ndecisive correspondence, was once in church, when he sat in front of\r\nher, and beside Miss Hinton.\r\n\r\nThe rencounter was quite an accident. Springrove had come there in the\r\nfull belief that Cytherea was away from home with Miss Aldclyffe; and he\r\ncontinued ignorant of her presence throughout the service.\r\n\r\nIt is at such moments as these, when a sensitive nature writhes under\r\nthe conception that its most cherished emotions have been treated with\r\ncontumely, that the sphere-descended Maid, Music, friend of Pleasure\r\nat other times, becomes a positive enemy--racking, bewildering,\r\nunrelenting. The congregation sang the first Psalm and came to the\r\nverse--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98Like some fair tree which, fed by streams,\r\n       With timely fruit doth bend,\r\n     He still shall flourish, and success\r\n       All his designs attend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s lips did not move, nor did any sound escape her; but could\r\nshe help singing the words in the depths of her being, although the man\r\nto whom she applied them sat at her rival\xe2\x80\x99s side?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the moral compensation for all a woman\xe2\x80\x99s petty cleverness\r\nunder thriving conditions is the real nobility that lies in her extreme\r\nfoolishness at these other times; her sheer inability to be simply\r\njust, her exercise of an illogical power entirely denied to men in\r\ngeneral--the power not only of kissing, but of delighting to kiss the\r\nrod by a punctilious observance of the self-immolating doctrines in the\r\nSermon on the Mount.\r\n\r\nAs for Edward--a little like other men of his temperament, to whom, it\r\nis somewhat humiliating to think, the aberrancy of a given love is in\r\nitself a recommendation--his sentiment, as he looked over his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbook, was of a lower rank, Horatian rather than Psalmodic--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98O, what hast thou of her, of her\r\n     Whose every look did love inspire;\r\n     Whose every breathing fanned my fire,\r\n     And stole me from myself away!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen, without letting him see her, Cytherea slipt out of church early,\r\nand went home, the tones of the organ still lingering in her ears as she\r\ntried bravely to kill a jealous thought that would nevertheless live:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My nature is one capable of more, far more, intense feeling than hers!\r\nShe can\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate all the sides of him--she never will! He is more\r\ntangible to me even now, as a thought, than his presence itself is to\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x99 She was less noble then.\r\n\r\nBut she continually repressed her misery and bitterness of heart till\r\nthe effort to do so showed signs of lessening. At length she even tried\r\nto hope that her lost lover and her rival would love one another very\r\ndearly.\r\n\r\nThe scene and the sentiment dropped into the past. Meanwhile, Manston\r\ncontinued visibly before her. He, though quiet and subdued in his\r\nbearing for a long time after the calamity of November, had not\r\nsimulated a grief that he did not feel. At first his loss seemed so\r\nto absorb him--though as a startling change rather than as a heavy\r\nsorrow--that he paid Cytherea no attention whatever. His conduct was\r\nuniformly kind and respectful, but little more. Then, as the date of the\r\ncatastrophe grew remoter, he began to wear a different aspect towards\r\nher. He always contrived to obliterate by his manner all recollection on\r\nher side that she was comparatively more dependent than himself--making\r\nmuch of her womanhood, nothing of her situation. Prompt to aid her\r\nwhenever occasion offered, and full of delightful petits soins at all\r\ntimes, he was not officious. In this way he irresistibly won for himself\r\na position as her friend, and the more easily in that he allowed not the\r\nfaintest symptom of the old love to be apparent.\r\n\r\nMatters stood thus in the middle of the spring when the next move on his\r\nbehalf was made by Miss Aldclyffe.\r\n\r\n2. THE THIRD OF MAY\r\n\r\nShe led Cytherea to a summer-house called the Fane, built in the private\r\ngrounds about the mansion in the form of a Grecian temple; it overlooked\r\nthe lake, the island on it, the trees, and their undisturbed reflection\r\nin the smooth still water. Here the old and young maid halted; here they\r\nstood, side by side, mentally imbibing the scene.\r\n\r\nThe month was May--the time, morning. Cuckoos, thrushes, blackbirds, and\r\nsparrows gave forth a perfect confusion of song and twitter. The road\r\nwas spotted white with the fallen leaves of apple-blossoms, and the\r\nsparkling grey dew still lingered on the grass and flowers. Two swans\r\nfloated into view in front of the women, and then crossed the water\r\ntowards them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They seem to come to us without any will of their own--quite\r\ninvoluntarily--don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, looking at the birds\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngraceful advance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, but if you look narrowly you can see their hips just beneath the\r\nwater, working with the greatest energy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not see that, it spoils the idea of proud indifference to\r\ndirection which we associate with a swan.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It does; we\xe2\x80\x99ll have \xe2\x80\x9cinvoluntarily.\xe2\x80\x9d Ah, now this reminds me of\r\nsomething.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of what?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of a human being who involuntarily comes towards yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea looked into Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s face; her eyes grew round as\r\ncircles, and lines of wonderment came visibly upon her countenance.\r\nShe had not once regarded Manston as a lover since his wife\xe2\x80\x99s sudden\r\nappearance and subsequent death. The death of a wife, and such a death,\r\nwas an overwhelming matter in her ideas of things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it a man or woman?\xe2\x80\x99 she said, quite innocently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Manston,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Manston attracted by me _now_?\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, standing at gaze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you know it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly I did not. Why, his poor wife has only been dead six months.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course he knows that. But loving is not done by months, or method,\r\nor rule, or nobody would ever have invented such a phrase as \xe2\x80\x9cfalling\r\nin love.\xe2\x80\x9d He does not want his love to be observed just yet, on the very\r\naccount you mention; but conceal it as he may from himself and us, it\r\nexists definitely--and very intensely, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose then, that if he can\xe2\x80\x99t help it, it is no harm of him,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nCytherea naively, and beginning to ponder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course it isn\xe2\x80\x99t--you know that well enough. She was a great burden\r\nand trouble to him. This may become a great good to you both.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA rush of feeling at remembering that the same woman, before Manston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrival, had just as frankly advocated Edward\xe2\x80\x99s claims, checked\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s utterance for awhile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me like that, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss\r\nAldclyffe. \xe2\x80\x98You could almost kill a person by the force of reproach you\r\ncan put into those eyes of yours, I verily believe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEdward once in the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts, there was no getting rid of\r\nhim. She wanted to be alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you want me here?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now there, there; you want to be off, and have a good cry,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss\r\nAldclyffe, taking her hand. \xe2\x80\x98But you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t, my dear. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nin the past for you to regret. Compare Mr. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s honourable conduct\r\ntowards his wife and yourself, with Springrove towards his betrothed and\r\nyourself, and then see which appears the more worthy of your thoughts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n3. FROM THE FOURTH OF MAY TO THE TWENTY-FIRST OF JUNE\r\n\r\nThe next stage in Manston\xe2\x80\x99s advances towards her hand was a clearly\r\ndefined courtship. She was sadly perplexed, and some contrivance was\r\nnecessary on his part in order to meet with her. But it is next to\r\nimpossible for an appreciative woman to have a positive repugnance\r\ntowards an unusually handsome and gifted man, even though she may not be\r\ninclined to love him. Hence Cytherea was not so alarmed at the sight of\r\nhim as to render a meeting and conversation with her more than a matter\r\nof difficulty.\r\n\r\nComing and going from church was his grand opportunity. Manston was very\r\nreligious now. It is commonly said that no man was ever converted by\r\nargument, but there is a single one which will make any Laodicean in\r\nEngland, let him be once love-sick, wear prayer-books and become a\r\nzealous Episcopalian--the argument that his sweetheart can be seen from\r\nhis pew.\r\n\r\nManston introduced into his method a system of bewitching flattery,\r\neverywhere pervasive, yet, too, so transitory and intangible, that, as\r\nin the case of the poet Wordsworth and the Wandering Voice, though she\r\nfelt it present, she could never find it. As a foil to heighten its\r\neffect, he occasionally spoke philosophically of the evanescence of\r\nfemale beauty--the worthlessness of mere appearance. \xe2\x80\x98Handsome is that\r\nhandsome does\xe2\x80\x99 he considered a proverb which should be written on the\r\nlooking-glass of every woman in the land. \xe2\x80\x98Your form, your motions, your\r\nheart have won me,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, in a tone of playful sadness. \xe2\x80\x98They are\r\nbeautiful. But I see these things, and it comes into my mind that they\r\nare doomed, they are gliding to nothing as I look. Poor eyes, poor\r\nmouth, poor face, poor maiden! \xe2\x80\x9cWhere will her glories be in twenty\r\nyears?\xe2\x80\x9d I say. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere will all of her be in a hundred?\xe2\x80\x9d Then I think\r\nit is cruel that you should bloom a day, and fade for ever and ever. It\r\nseems hard and sad that you will die as ordinarily as I, and be buried;\r\nbe food for roots and worms, be forgotten and come to earth, and grow up\r\na mere blade of churchyard-grass and an ivy leaf. Then, Miss Graye, when\r\nI see you are a Lovely Nothing, I pity you, and the love I feel then\r\nis better and sounder, larger and more lasting than that I felt at the\r\nbeginning.\xe2\x80\x99 Again an ardent flash of his handsome eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was by this route that he ventured on an indirect declaration and\r\noffer of his hand.\r\n\r\nShe implied in the same indirect manner that she did not love him enough\r\nto accept it.\r\n\r\nAn actual refusal was more than he had expected. Cursing himself for\r\nwhat he called his egregious folly in making himself the slave of a mere\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s attendant, and for having given the parish, should they know\r\nof her refusal, a chance of sneering at him--certainly a ground for\r\nthinking less of his standing than before--he went home to the Old\r\nHouse, and walked indecisively up and down his back-yard. Turning aside,\r\nhe leant his arms upon the edge of the rain-water-butt standing in the\r\ncorner, and looked into it. The reflection from the smooth stagnant\r\nsurface tinged his face with the greenish shades of Correggio\xe2\x80\x99s nudes.\r\nStaves of sunlight slanted down through the still pool, lighting it\r\nup with wonderful distinctness. Hundreds of thousands of minute living\r\ncreatures sported and tumbled in its depth with every contortion that\r\ngaiety could suggest; perfectly happy, though consisting only of a head,\r\nor a tail, or at most a head and a tail, and all doomed to die within\r\nthe twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Damn my position! Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I be happy through my little day too?\r\nLet the parish sneer at my repulses, let it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get her, if I move\r\nheaven and earth to do it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIndeed, the inexperienced Cytherea had, towards Edward in the first\r\nplace, and Manston afterwards, unconsciously adopted bearings that would\r\nhave been the very tactics of a professional fisher of men who wished\r\nto have them each successively dangling at her heels. For if any rule\r\nat all can be laid down in a matter which, for men collectively, is\r\nnotoriously beyond regulation, it is that to snub a petted man, and to\r\npet a snubbed man, is the way to win in suits of both kinds. Manston\r\nwith Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s encouragement would have become indifferent. Edward\r\nwith Manston\xe2\x80\x99s repulses would have sheered off at the outset, as he did\r\nafterwards. Her supreme indifference added fuel to Manston\xe2\x80\x99s ardour--it\r\ncompletely disarmed his pride. The invulnerable Nobody seemed greater to\r\nhim than a susceptible Princess.\r\n\r\n4. FROM THE TWENTY-FIRST OF JUNE TO THE END OF JULY\r\n\r\nCytherea had in the meantime received the following letter from her\r\nbrother. It was the first definite notification of the enlargement\r\nof that cloud no bigger than a man\xe2\x80\x99s hand which had for nearly a\r\ntwelvemonth hung before them in the distance, and which was soon to give\r\na colour to their whole sky from horizon to horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               \xe2\x80\x98BUDMOUTH REGIS,\r\n\r\nSaturday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98DARLING SIS,--I have delayed telling you for a long time of a\r\nlittle matter which, though not one to be seriously alarmed about, is\r\nsufficiently vexing, and it would be unfair in me to keep it from you\r\nany longer. It is that for some time past I have again been distressed\r\nby that lameness which I first distinctly felt when we went to Lulstead\r\nCove, and again when I left Knapwater that morning early. It is an\r\nunusual pain in my left leg, between the knee and the ankle. I had just\r\nfound fresh symptoms of it when you were here for that half-hour about a\r\nmonth ago--when you said in fun that I began to move like an old man. I\r\nhad a good mind to tell you then, but fancying it would go off in a\r\nfew days, I thought it was not worth while. Since that time it has\r\nincreased, but I am still able to work in the office, sitting on the\r\nstool. My great fear is that Mr. G. will have some out-door measuring\r\nwork for me to do soon, and that I shall be obliged to decline it.\r\nHowever, we will hope for the best. How it came, what was its origin, or\r\nwhat it tends to, I cannot think. You shall hear again in a day or two,\r\nif it is no better...--Your loving brother, OWEN.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nThis she answered, begging to know the worst, which she could bear, but\r\nsuspense and anxiety never. In two days came another letter from him, of\r\nwhich the subjoined paragraph is a portion:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had quite decided to let you know the worst, and to assure you that\r\nit was the worst, before you wrote to ask it. And again I give you\r\nmy word that I will conceal nothing--so that there will be no excuse\r\nwhatever for your wearing yourself out with fears that I am worse than I\r\nsay. This morning then, for the first time, I have been obliged to stay\r\naway from the office. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened at this, dear Cytherea. Rest\r\nis all that is wanted, and by nursing myself now for a week, I may avoid\r\nan illness of six months.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a visit from her he wrote again:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dr. Chestman has seen me. He said that the ailment was some sort of\r\nrheumatism, and I am now undergoing proper treatment for its cure. My\r\nleg and foot have been placed in hot bran, liniments have been applied,\r\nand also severe friction with a pad. He says I shall be as right as ever\r\nin a very short time. Directly I am I shall run up by the train to see\r\nyou. Don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble to come to me if Miss Aldclyffe grumbles again about\r\nyour being away, for I am going on capitally.... You shall hear again at\r\nthe end of the week.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time mentioned came the following:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry to tell you, because I know it will be so disheartening\r\nafter my last letter, that I am not so well as I was then, and that\r\nthere has been a sort of hitch in the proceedings. After I had been\r\ntreated for rheumatism a few days longer (in which treatment they\r\npricked the place with a long needle several times,) I saw that Dr.\r\nChestman was in doubt about something, and I requested that he would\r\ncall in a brother professional man to see me as well. They consulted\r\ntogether and then told me that rheumatism was not the disease after all,\r\nbut erysipelas. They then began treating it differently, as became a\r\ndifferent matter. Blisters, flour, and starch, seem to be the order of\r\nthe day now--medicine, of course, besides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Gradfield has been in to inquire about me. He says he has been\r\nobliged to get a designer in my place, which grieves me very much,\r\nthough, of course, it could not be avoided.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nA month passed away; throughout this period, Cytherea visited him\r\nas often as the limited time at her command would allow, and wore as\r\ncheerful a countenance as the womanly determination to do nothing which\r\nmight depress him could enable her to wear. Another letter from him then\r\ntold her these additional facts:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The doctors find they are again on the wrong tack. They cannot make out\r\nwhat the disease is. O Cytherea! how I wish they knew! This suspense is\r\nwearing me out. Could not Miss Aldclyffe spare you for a day? Do come to\r\nme. We will talk about the best course then. I am sorry to complain, but\r\nI am worn out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nCytherea went to Miss Aldclyffe, and told her of the melancholy turn her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s illness had taken. Miss Aldclyffe at once said that Cytherea\r\nmight go, and offered to do anything to assist her which lay in her\r\npower. Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s eyes beamed gratitude as she turned to leave the room,\r\nand hasten to the station.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, Cytherea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe, calling her back; \xe2\x80\x98just one word.\r\nHas Mr. Manston spoken to you lately?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, blushing timorously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He proposed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you refused him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tut, tut! Now listen to my advice,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe emphatically,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and accept him before he changes his mind. The chance which he offers\r\nyou of settling in life is one that may possibly, probably, not occur\r\nagain. His position is good and secure, and the life of his wife would\r\nbe a happy one. You may not be sure that you love him madly; but suppose\r\nyou are not sure? My father used to say to me as a child when he was\r\nteaching me whist, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen in doubt win the trick!\xe2\x80\x9d That advice is ten\r\ntimes as valuable to a woman on the subject of matrimony. In refusing a\r\nman there is always the risk that you may never get another offer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you win the trick when you were a girl?\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, my lady Pert; I\xe2\x80\x99m not the text,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe, her face\r\nglowing like fire.\r\n\r\nCytherea laughed stealthily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was about to say,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Miss Aldclyffe severely, \xe2\x80\x98that here is\r\nMr. Manston waiting with the tenderest solicitude for you, and you\r\noverlooking it, as if it were altogether beneath you. Think how you\r\nmight benefit your sick brother if you were Mrs. Manston. You will\r\nplease me _very much_ by giving him some encouragement. You understand\r\nme, Cythie dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe, still more emphatically, \xe2\x80\x98on your promising\r\nthat you will accept him some time this year, I will take especial care\r\nof your brother. You are listening, Cytherea?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered, leaving the room.\r\n\r\nShe went to Budmouth, passed the day with her brother, and returned to\r\nKnapwater wretched and full of foreboding. Owen had looked startlingly\r\nthin and pale--thinner and paler than ever she had seen him before. The\r\nbrother and sister had that day decided that notwithstanding the drain\r\nupon their slender resources, another surgeon should see him. Time was\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nOwen told her the result in his next letter:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The three practitioners between them have at last hit the nail on the\r\nhead, I hope. They probed the place, and discovered that the secret lay\r\nin the bone. I underwent an operation for its removal three days ago\r\n(after taking chloroform)... Thank God it is over. Though I am so weak,\r\nmy spirits are rather better. I wonder when I shall be at work again?\r\nI asked the surgeons how long it would be first. I said a month? They\r\nshook their heads. A year? I said. Not so long, they said. Six months? I\r\ninquired. They would not, or could not, tell me. But never mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Run down, when you have half a day to spare, for the hours drag on so\r\ndrearily. O Cytherea, you can\xe2\x80\x99t think how drearily!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nShe went. Immediately on her departure Miss Aldclyffe sent a note to the\r\nOld House, to Manston. On the maiden\xe2\x80\x99s return, tired and sick at heart\r\nas usual, she found Manston at the station awaiting her. He asked\r\npolitely if he might accompany her to Knapwater. She tacitly acquiesced.\r\nDuring their walk he inquired the particulars of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s illness,\r\nand with an irresistible desire to pour out her trouble to some one,\r\nshe told him of the length of time which must elapse before he could be\r\nstrong again, and of the lack of comfort in lodgings.\r\n\r\nManston was silent awhile. Then he said impetuously: \xe2\x80\x98Miss Graye, I will\r\nnot mince matters--I love you--you know it. Stratagem they say is fair\r\nin love, and I am compelled to adopt it now. Forgive me, for I cannot\r\nhelp it. Consent to be my wife at any time that may suit you--any remote\r\nday you may name will satisfy me--and you shall find him well provided\r\nfor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor the first time in her life she truly dreaded the handsome man at\r\nher side who pleaded thus selfishly, and shrank from the hot voluptuous\r\nnature of his passion for her, which, disguise it as he might under a\r\nquiet and polished exterior, at times radiated forth with a scorching\r\nwhite heat. She perceived how animal was the love which bargained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not love you, Mr. Manston,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied coldly.\r\n\r\n5. FROM THE FIRST TO THE TWENTY-SEVENTH OF AUGUST\r\n\r\nThe long sunny days of the later summer-time brought only the same\r\ndreary accounts from Budmouth, and saw Cytherea paying the same sad\r\nvisits.\r\n\r\nShe grew perceptibly weaker, in body and mind. Manston still persisted\r\nin his suit, but with more of his former indirectness, now that he saw\r\nhow unexpectedly well she stood an open attack. His was the system of\r\nDares at the Sicilian games--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98He, like a captain who beleaguers round\r\n      Some strong-built castle on a rising ground,\r\n      Views all the approaches with observing eyes,\r\n      This and that other part again he tries,\r\n      And more on industry than force relies.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe made it appear more clearly than ever that aid to\r\nOwen from herself depended entirely upon Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of\r\nher steward. Hemmed in and distressed, Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s answers to his\r\nimportunities grew less uniform; they were firm, or wavering, as Owen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmalady fluctuated. Had a register of her pitiful oscillations been kept,\r\nit would have rivalled in pathos the diary wherein De Quincey tabulates\r\nhis combat with Opium--perhaps as noticeable an instance as any in which\r\na thrilling dramatic power has been given to mere numerals. Thus she\r\nwearily and monotonously lived through the month, listening on Sundays\r\nto the well-known round of chapters narrating the history of Elijah and\r\nElisha in famine and drought; on week-days to buzzing flies in hot sunny\r\nrooms. \xe2\x80\x98So like, so very like, was day to day.\xe2\x80\x99 Extreme lassitude seemed\r\nall that the world could show her.\r\n\r\nHer state was in this wise, when one afternoon, having been with her\r\nbrother, she met the surgeon, and begged him to tell the actual truth\r\nconcerning Owen\xe2\x80\x99s condition.\r\n\r\nThe reply was that he feared that the first operation had not been\r\nthorough; that although the wound had healed, another attempt might\r\nstill be necessary, unless nature were left to effect her own cure. But\r\nthe time such a self-healing proceeding would occupy might be ruinous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long would it be?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is impossible to say. A year or two, more or less.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And suppose he submitted to another artificial extraction?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then he might be well in four or six months.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow the remainder of his and her possessions, together with a sum he had\r\nborrowed, would not provide him with necessary comforts for half\r\nthat time. To combat the misfortune, there were two courses open--her\r\nbecoming betrothed to Manston, or the sending Owen to the County\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\nThus terrified, driven into a corner, panting and fluttering about for\r\nsome loophole of escape, yet still shrinking from the idea of being\r\nManston\xe2\x80\x99s wife, the poor little bird endeavoured to find out from\r\nMiss Aldclyffe whether it was likely Owen would be well treated in the\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98County Hospital!\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe; \xe2\x80\x98why, it is only another\r\nname for slaughter-house--in surgical cases at any rate. Certainly if\r\nanything about your body is snapt in two they do join you together in\r\na fashion, but \xe2\x80\x98tis so askew and ugly, that you may as well be apart\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she terrified the inquiring and anxious maiden by relating\r\nhorrid stories of how the legs and arms of poor people were cut off at a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s notice, especially in cases where the restorative treatment was\r\nlikely to be long and tedious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know how willing I am to help you, Cytherea,\xe2\x80\x99 she added\r\nreproachfully. \xe2\x80\x98You know it. Why are you so obstinate then? Why do you\r\nselfishly bar the clear, honourable, and only sisterly path which leads\r\nout of this difficulty? I cannot, on my conscience, countenance you; no,\r\nI cannot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nManston once more repeated his offer; and once more she refused, but\r\nthis time weakly, and with signs of an internal struggle. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s eye\r\nsparkled; he saw for the hundredth time in his life, that perseverance,\r\nif only systematic, was irresistible by womankind.\r\n\r\n6. THE TWENTY-SEVENTH OF AUGUST\r\n\r\nOn going to Budmouth three days later, she found to her surprise that\r\nthe steward had been there, had introduced himself, and had seen her\r\nbrother. A few delicacies had been brought him also by the same hand.\r\nOwen spoke in warm terms of Manston and his free and unceremonious call,\r\nas he could not have refrained from doing of any person, of any kind,\r\nwhose presence had served to help away the tedious hours of a long day,\r\nand who had, moreover, shown that sort of consideration for him which\r\nthe accompanying basket implied--antecedent consideration, so telling\r\nupon all invalids--and which he so seldom experienced except from the\r\nhands of his sister.\r\n\r\nHow should he perceive, amid this tithe-paying of mint, and anise, and\r\ncummin, the weightier matters which were left undone?\r\n\r\nAgain the steward met her at Carriford Road Station on her return\r\njourney. Instead of being frigid as at the former meeting at the same\r\nplace, she was embarrassed by a strife of thought, and murmured brokenly\r\nher thanks for what he had done. The same request that he might see her\r\nhome was made.\r\n\r\nHe had perceived his error in making his kindness to Owen a conditional\r\nkindness, and had hastened to efface all recollection of it. \xe2\x80\x98Though I\r\nlet my offer on her brother\xe2\x80\x99s--my friend\xe2\x80\x99s--behalf, seem dependent on my\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s graciousness to me,\xe2\x80\x99 he whispered wooingly in the course of their\r\nwalk, \xe2\x80\x98I could not conscientiously adhere to my statement; it was said\r\nwith all the impulsive selfishness of love. Whether you choose to have\r\nme, or whether you don\xe2\x80\x99t, I love you too devotedly to be anything but\r\nkind to your brother.... Miss Graye, Cytherea, I will do anything,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ncontinued earnestly, \xe2\x80\x98to give you pleasure--indeed I will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe saw on the one hand her poor and much-loved Owen recovering from\r\nhis illness and troubles by the disinterested kindness of the man\r\nbeside her, on the other she drew him dying, wholly by reason of her\r\nself-enforced poverty. To marry this man was obviously the course of\r\ncommon sense, to refuse him was impolitic temerity. There was reason\r\nin this. But there was more behind than a hundred reasons--a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngratitude and her impulse to be kind.\r\n\r\nThe wavering of her mind was visible in her tell-tale face. He noticed\r\nit, and caught at the opportunity.\r\n\r\nThey were standing by the ruinous foundations of an old mill in the\r\nmidst of a meadow. Between grey and half-overgrown stonework--the only\r\nsigns of masonry remaining--the water gurgled down from the old millpond\r\nto a lower level, under the cloak of rank broad leaves--the sensuous\r\nnatures of the vegetable world. On the right hand the sun, resting on\r\nthe horizon-line, streamed across the ground from below copper-coloured\r\nand lilac clouds, stretched out in flats beneath a sky of pale soft\r\ngreen. All dark objects on the earth that lay towards the sun were\r\noverspread by a purple haze, against which a swarm of wailing gnats\r\nshone forth luminously, rising upward and floating away like sparks of\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThe stillness oppressed and reduced her to mere passivity. The only\r\nwish the humidity of the place left in her was to stand motionless.\r\nThe helpless flatness of the landscape gave her, as it gives all such\r\ntemperaments, a sense of bare equality with, and no superiority to, a\r\nsingle entity under the sky.\r\n\r\nHe came so close that their clothes touched. \xe2\x80\x98Will you try to love me?\r\nDo try to love me!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, in a whisper, taking her hand. He had never\r\ntaken it before. She could feel his hand trembling exceedingly as it\r\nheld hers in its clasp.\r\n\r\nConsidering his kindness to her brother, his love for herself, and\r\nEdward\xe2\x80\x99s fickleness, ought she to forbid him to do this? How truly\r\npitiful it was to feel his hand tremble so--all for her! Should she\r\nwithdraw her hand? She would think whether she would. Thinking, and\r\nhesitating, she looked as far as the autumnal haze on the marshy\r\nground would allow her to see distinctly. There was the fragment of a\r\nhedge--all that remained of a \xe2\x80\x98wet old garden\xe2\x80\x99--standing in the middle\r\nof the mead, without a definite beginning or ending, purposeless and\r\nvalueless. It was overgrown, and choked with mandrakes, and she could\r\nalmost fancy she heard their shrieks.... Should she withdraw her hand?\r\nNo, she could not withdraw it now; it was too late, the act would not\r\nimply refusal. She felt as one in a boat without oars, drifting with\r\nclosed eyes down a river--she knew not whither.\r\n\r\nHe gave her hand a gentle pressure, and relinquished it.\r\n\r\nThen it seemed as if he were coming to the point again. No, he was not\r\ngoing to urge his suit that evening. Another respite.\r\n\r\n7. THE EARLY PART OF SEPTEMBER\r\n\r\nSaturday came, and she went on some trivial errand to the village\r\npost-office. It was a little grey cottage with a luxuriant jasmine\r\nencircling the doorway, and before going in Cytherea paused to admire\r\nthis pleasing feature of the exterior. Hearing a step on the gravel\r\nbehind the corner of the house, she resigned the jasmine and entered.\r\nNobody was in the room. She could hear Mrs. Leat, the widow who acted\r\nas postmistress, walking about over her head. Cytherea was going to the\r\nfoot of the stairs to call Mrs. Leat, but before she had accomplished\r\nher object, another form stood at the half-open door. Manston came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Both on the same errand,\xe2\x80\x99 he said gracefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will call her,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, moving in haste to the foot of the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One moment.\xe2\x80\x99 He glided to her side. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t call her for a moment,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nBut she had said, \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Leat!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe seized Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s hand, kissed it tenderly, and carefully replaced it\r\nby her side.\r\n\r\nShe had that morning determined to check his further advances, until she\r\nhad thoroughly considered her position. The remonstrance was now on her\r\ntongue, but as accident would have it, before the word could be\r\nspoken Mrs. Leat was stepping from the last stair to the floor, and no\r\nremonstrance came.\r\n\r\nWith the subtlety which characterized him in all his dealings with her,\r\nhe quickly concluded his own errand, bade her a good-bye, in the tones\r\nof which love was so garnished with pure politeness that it only showed\r\nits presence to herself, and left the house--putting it out of her\r\npower to refuse him her companionship homeward, or to object to his late\r\naction of kissing her hand.\r\n\r\nThe Friday of the next week brought another letter from her brother. In\r\nthis he informed her that, in absolute grief lest he should distress her\r\nunnecessarily, he had some time earlier borrowed a few pounds. A week\r\nago, he said, his creditor became importunate, but that on the day\r\non which he wrote, the creditor had told him there was no hurry for a\r\nsettlement, that \xe2\x80\x98his _sister\xe2\x80\x99s suitor_ had guaranteed the sum.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Is he\r\nMr. Manston? tell me, Cytherea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen.\r\n\r\nHe also mentioned that a wheeled chair had been anonymously hired\r\nfor his especial use, though as yet he was hardly far enough advanced\r\ntowards convalescence to avail himself of the luxury. \xe2\x80\x98Is this Mr.\r\nManston\xe2\x80\x99s doing?\xe2\x80\x99 he inquired.\r\n\r\nShe could dally with her perplexity, evade it, trust to time for\r\nguidance, no longer. The matter had come to a crisis: she must once and\r\nfor all choose between the dictates of her understanding and those of\r\nher heart. She longed, till her soul seemed nigh to bursting, for her\r\nlost mother\xe2\x80\x99s return to earth, but for one minute, that she might have\r\ntender counsel to guide her through this, her great difficulty.\r\n\r\nAs for her heart, she half fancied that it was not Edward\xe2\x80\x99s to quite\r\nthe extent that it once had been; she thought him cruel in conducting\r\nhimself towards her as he did at Budmouth, cruel afterwards in making so\r\nlight of her. She knew he had stifled his love for her--was utterly\r\nlost to her. But for all that she could not help indulging in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npleasure of recreating defunct agonies, and lacerating herself with them\r\nnow and then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I were rich,\xe2\x80\x99 she thought, \xe2\x80\x98I would give way to the luxury of being\r\nmorbidly faithful to him for ever without his knowledge.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut she considered; in the first place she was a homeless dependent;\r\nand what did practical wisdom tell her to do under such desperate\r\ncircumstances? To provide herself with some place of refuge from\r\npoverty, and with means to aid her brother Owen. This was to be Mr.\r\nManston\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\nShe did not love him.\r\n\r\nBut what was love without a home? Misery. What was a home without love?\r\nAlas, not much; but still a kind of home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 she thought, \xe2\x80\x98I am urged by my common sense to marry Mr.\r\nManston.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDid anything nobler in her say so too?\r\n\r\nWith the death (to her) of Edward her heart\xe2\x80\x99s occupation was gone. Was\r\nit necessary or even right for her to tend it and take care of it as she\r\nused to in the old time, when it was still a capable minister?\r\n\r\nBy a slight sacrifice here she could give happiness to at least two\r\nhearts whose emotional activities were still unwounded. She would do\r\ngood to two men whose lives were far more important than hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 she said again, \xe2\x80\x98even Christianity urges me to marry Mr.\r\nManston.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDirectly Cytherea had persuaded herself that a kind of heroic\r\nself-abnegation had to do with the matter, she became much more content\r\nin the consideration of it. A wilful indifference to the future was what\r\nreally prevailed in her, ill and worn out, as she was, by the perpetual\r\nharassments of her sad fortune, and she regarded this indifference, as\r\ngushing natures will do under such circumstances, as genuine resignation\r\nand devotedness.\r\n\r\nManston met her again the following day: indeed, there was no escaping\r\nhim now. At the end of a short conversation between them, which took\r\nplace in the hollow of the park by the waterfall, obscured on the outer\r\nside by the low hanging branches of the limes, she tacitly assented to\r\nhis assumption of a privilege greater than any that had preceded it. He\r\nstooped and kissed her brow.\r\n\r\nBefore going to bed she wrote to Owen explaining the whole matter. It\r\nwas too late in the evening for the postman\xe2\x80\x99s visit, and she placed the\r\nletter on the mantelpiece to send it the next day.\r\n\r\nThe morning (Sunday) brought a hurried postscript to Owen\xe2\x80\x99s letter of\r\nthe day before:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              \xe2\x80\x98September 9, 1865.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98DEAR CYTHEREA--I have received a frank and friendly letter from Mr.\r\nManston explaining the position in which he stands now, and also that in\r\nwhich he hopes to stand towards you. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you love him? Why not? Try,\r\nfor he is a good, and not only that, but a cultured man. Think of the\r\nweary and laborious future that awaits you if you continue for life in\r\nyour present position, and do you see any way of escape from it except\r\nby marriage? I don\xe2\x80\x99t. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go against your heart, Cytherea, but be\r\nwise.--Ever affectionately yours, OWEN.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nShe thought that probably he had replied to Mr. Manston in the same\r\nfavouring mood. She had a conviction that that day would settle her\r\ndoom. Yet\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98So true a fool is love,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nthat even now she nourished a half-hope that something would happen at\r\nthe last moment to thwart her deliberately-formed intentions, and favour\r\nthe old emotion she was using all her strength to thrust down.\r\n\r\n8. THE TENTH OF SEPTEMBER\r\n\r\nThe Sunday was the thirteenth after Trinity, and the afternoon service\r\nat Carriford was nearly over. The people were singing the Evening Hymn.\r\n\r\nManston was at church as usual in his accustomed place two seats forward\r\nfrom the large square pew occupied by Miss Aldclyffe and Cytherea.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary sadness of an autumnal evening-service seemed, in\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, to be doubled on this particular occasion. She looked\r\nat all the people as they stood and sang, waving backwards and forwards\r\nlike a forest of pines swayed by a gentle breeze; then at the village\r\nchildren singing too, their heads inclined to one side, their eyes\r\nlistlessly tracing some crack in the old walls, or following the\r\nmovement of a distant bough or bird with features petrified almost to\r\npainfulness. Then she looked at Manston; he was already regarding her\r\nwith some purpose in his glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is coming this evening,\xe2\x80\x99 she said in her mind. A minute later, at\r\nthe end of the hymn, when the congregation began to move out, Manston\r\ncame down the aisle. He was opposite the end of her seat as she stepped\r\nfrom it, the remainder of their progress to the door being in contact\r\nwith each other. Miss Aldclyffe had lingered behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s hurry,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, when Cytherea was about to enter the\r\nprivate path to the House as usual. \xe2\x80\x98Would you mind turning down this\r\nway for a minute till Miss Aldclyffe has passed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe could not very well refuse now. They turned into a secluded path on\r\ntheir left, leading round through a thicket of laurels to the other gate\r\nof the church-yard, walking very slowly. By the time the further gate\r\nwas reached, the church was closed. They met the sexton with the keys in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are going inside for a minute,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston to him, taking the keys\r\nunceremoniously. \xe2\x80\x98I will bring them to you when we return.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe sexton nodded his assent, and Cytherea and Manston walked into the\r\nporch, and up the nave.\r\n\r\nThey did not speak a word during their progress, or in any way interfere\r\nwith the stillness and silence that prevailed everywhere around them.\r\nEverything in the place was the embodiment of decay: the fading\r\nred glare from the setting sun, which came in at the west window,\r\nemphasizing the end of the day and all its cheerful doings, the mildewed\r\nwalls, the uneven paving-stones, the wormy pews, the sense of recent\r\noccupation, and the dank air of death which had gathered with the\r\nevening, would have made grave a lighter mood than Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s was then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What sensations does the place impress you with?\xe2\x80\x99 she said at last,\r\nvery sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I feel imperatively called upon to be honest, from very despair of\r\nachieving anything by stratagem in a world where the materials are such\r\nas these.\xe2\x80\x99 He, too, spoke in a depressed voice, purposely or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I feel as if I were almost ashamed to be seen walking such a world,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe murmured; \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s the effect it has upon me; but it does not induce\r\nme to be honest particularly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe took her hand in both his, and looked down upon the lids of her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I pity you sometimes,\xe2\x80\x99 he said more emphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am pitiable, perhaps; so are many people. Why do you pity me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think that you make yourself needlessly sad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not needlessly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, needlessly. Why should you be separated from your brother so much,\r\nwhen you might have him to stay with you till he is well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That can\xe2\x80\x99t be,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, turning away.\r\n\r\nHe went on, \xe2\x80\x98I think the real and only good thing that can be done for\r\nhim is to get him away from Budmouth awhile; and I have been wondering\r\nwhether it could not be managed for him to come to my house to live for\r\na few weeks. Only a quarter of a mile from you. How pleasant it would\r\nbe!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe moved himself round immediately to the front of her, and held her\r\nhand more firmly, as he continued, \xe2\x80\x98Cytherea, why do you say \xe2\x80\x9cIt would,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n so entirely in the tone of abstract supposition? I want him there: I\r\nwant him to be my brother, too. Then make him so, and be my wife! I\r\ncannot live without you. O Cytherea, my darling, my love, come and be my\r\nwife!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis face bent closer and closer to hers, and the last words sank to a\r\nwhisper as weak as the emotion inspiring it was strong.\r\n\r\nShe said firmly and distinctly, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Next month?\xe2\x80\x99 he said on the instant, before taking breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; not next month.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The next?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98December? Christmas Day, say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, you darling!\xe2\x80\x99 He was about to imprint a kiss upon her pale, cold\r\nmouth, but she hastily covered it with her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t kiss me--at least where we are now!\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered imploringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are too near God.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe gave a sudden start, and his face flushed. She had spoken so\r\nemphatically that the words \xe2\x80\x98Near God\xe2\x80\x99 echoed back again through the\r\nhollow building from the far end of the chancel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a thing to say!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x98surely a pure kiss is not\r\ninappropriate to the place!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied, with a swelling heart; \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I burst out\r\nso--I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell what has come over me! Will you forgive me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How shall I say \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d without judging you? How shall I say \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d without\r\nlosing the pleasure of saying \xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 He was himself again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 she absently murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll say \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 he answered daintily. \xe2\x80\x98It is sweeter to fancy we\r\nare forgiven, than to think we have not sinned; and you shall have the\r\nsweetness without the need.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe did not reply, and they moved away. The church was nearly dark now,\r\nand melancholy in the extreme. She stood beside him while he locked\r\nthe door, then took the arm he gave her, and wound her way out of the\r\nchurchyard with him. Then they walked to the house together, but the\r\ngreat matter having been set at rest, she persisted in talking only on\r\nindifferent subjects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Christmas Day, then,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, as they were parting at the end of the\r\nshrubbery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I meant Old Christmas Day,\xe2\x80\x99 she said evasively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98H\xe2\x80\x99m, people do not usually attach that meaning to the words.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; but I should like it best if it could not be till then?\xe2\x80\x99 It seemed\r\nto be still her instinct to delay the marriage to the utmost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, love,\xe2\x80\x99 he said gently. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis a fortnight longer still; but\r\nnever mind. Old Christmas Day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n9. THE ELEVENTH OF SEPTEMBER\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There. It will be on a Friday!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe sat upon a little footstool gazing intently into the fire. It was\r\nthe afternoon of the day following that of the steward\xe2\x80\x99s successful\r\nsolicitation of her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder if it would be proper in me to run across the park and tell\r\nhim it is a Friday?\xe2\x80\x99 she said to herself, rising to her feet, looking\r\nat her hat lying near, and then out of the window towards the Old\r\nHouse. Proper or not, she felt that she must at all hazards remove the\r\ndisagreeable, though, as she herself owned, unfounded impression the\r\ncoincidence had occasioned. She left the house directly, and went to\r\nsearch for him.\r\n\r\nManston was in the timber-yard, looking at the sawyers as they worked.\r\nCytherea came up to him hesitatingly. Till within a distance of a few\r\nyards she had hurried forward with alacrity--now that the practical\r\nexpression of his face became visible she wished almost she had never\r\nsought him on such an errand; in his business-mood he was perhaps very\r\nstern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It will be on a Friday,\xe2\x80\x99 she said confusedly, and without any preface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come this way!\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston, in the tone he used for workmen, not\r\nbeing able to alter at an instant\xe2\x80\x99s notice. He gave her his arm and\r\nled her back into the avenue, by which time he was lover again. \xe2\x80\x98On\r\na Friday, will it, dearest? You do not mind Fridays, surely? That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnonsense.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not seriously mind them, exactly--but if it could be any other day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, let us say Old Christmas Eve, then. Shall it be Old Christmas\r\nEve?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Old Christmas Eve.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your word is solemn, and irrevocable now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, I have solemnly pledged my word; I should not have promised\r\nto marry you if I had not meant it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think I should.\xe2\x80\x99 She spoke the\r\nwords with a dignified impressiveness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must not be vexed at my remark, dearest. Can you think the worse of\r\nan ardent man, Cytherea, for showing some anxiety in love?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no.\xe2\x80\x99 She could not say more. She was always ill at ease when he\r\nspoke of himself as a piece of human nature in that analytical way, and\r\nwanted to be out of his presence. The time of day, and the proximity\r\nof the house, afforded her a means of escape. \xe2\x80\x98I must be with Miss\r\nAldclyffe now--will you excuse my hasty coming and going?\xe2\x80\x99 she said\r\nprettily. Before he had replied she had parted from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cytherea, was it Mr. Manston I saw you scudding away from in the avenue\r\njust now?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe, when Cytherea joined her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d Come, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you say more than that? I hate those taciturn\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesses\xe2\x80\x9d of yours. I tell you everything, and yet you are as close as\r\nwax with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I parted from him because I wanted to come in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a novel and important announcement! Well, is the day fixed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s face kindled into intense interest at once. \xe2\x80\x98Is it\r\nindeed? When is it to be?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On Old Christmas Eve.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old Christmas Eve.\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Aldclyffe drew Cytherea round to her front,\r\nand took a hand in each of her own. \xe2\x80\x98And then you will be a bride!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe said slowly, looking with critical thoughtfulness upon the maiden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelicately rounded cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe normal area of the colour upon each of them decreased perceptibly\r\nafter that slow and emphatic utterance by the elder lady.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe continued impressively, \xe2\x80\x98You did not say \xe2\x80\x9cOld Christmas\r\nEve\xe2\x80\x9d as a fiancee should have said the words: and you don\xe2\x80\x99t receive my\r\nremark with the warm excitement that foreshadows a bright future.... How\r\nmany weeks are there to the time?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not reckoned them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not? Fancy a girl not counting the weeks! I find I must take the\r\nlead in this matter--you are so childish, or frightened, or stupid, or\r\nsomething, about it. Bring me my diary, and we will count them at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea silently fetched the book.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe opened the diary at the page containing the almanac,\r\nand counted sixteen weeks, which brought her to the thirty-first of\r\nDecember--a Sunday. Cytherea stood by, looking on as if she had no\r\nappetite for the scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sixteen to the thirty-first. Then let me see, Monday will be the first\r\nof January, Tuesday the second, Wednesday third, Thursday fourth, Friday\r\nfifth--you have chosen a Friday, as I declare!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A Thursday, surely?\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No: Old Christmas Day comes on a Saturday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe perturbed little brain had reckoned wrong. \xe2\x80\x98Well, it must be a\r\nFriday,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured in a reverie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No: have it altered, of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe cheerfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing bad in Friday, but such a creature as you will be\r\nthinking about its being unlucky--in fact, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t choose a\r\nFriday myself to be married on, since all the other days are equally\r\navailable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall not have it altered,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea firmly; \xe2\x80\x98it has been\r\naltered once already: I shall let it be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. THE EVENTS OF ONE DAY\r\n\r\n1. THE FIFTH OF JANUARY. BEFORE DAWN\r\n\r\nWe pass over the intervening weeks. The time of the story is thus\r\nadvanced more than a quarter of a year.\r\n\r\nOn the midnight preceding the morning which would make her the wife of\r\na man whose presence fascinated her into involuntariness of bearing,\r\nand whom in absence she almost dreaded, Cytherea lay in her little bed,\r\nvainly endeavouring to sleep.\r\n\r\nShe had been looking back amid the years of her short though varied\r\npast, and thinking of the threshold upon which she stood. Days and\r\nmonths had dimmed the form of Edward Springrove like the gauzes of a\r\nvanishing stage-scene, but his dying voice could still be heard faintly\r\nbehind. That a soft small chord in her still vibrated true to his\r\nmemory, she would not admit: that she did not approach Manston with\r\nfeelings which could by any stretch of words be called hymeneal, she\r\ncalmly owned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why do I marry him?\xe2\x80\x99 she said to herself. \xe2\x80\x98Because Owen, dear Owen my\r\nbrother, wishes me to marry him. Because Mr. Manston is, and has been,\r\nuniformly kind to Owen, and to me. \xe2\x80\x9cAct in obedience to the dictates\r\nof common-sense,\xe2\x80\x9d Owen said, \xe2\x80\x9cand dread the sharp sting of poverty. How\r\nmany thousands of women like you marry every year for the same reason,\r\nto secure a home, and mere ordinary, material comforts, which after all\r\ngo far to make life endurable, even if not supremely happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis right, I suppose, for him to say that. O, if people only knew what\r\na timidity and melancholy upon the subject of her future grows up in the\r\nheart of a friendless woman who is blown about like a reed shaken with\r\nthe wind, as I am, they would not call this resignation of one\xe2\x80\x99s self\r\nby the name of scheming to get a husband. Scheme to marry? I\xe2\x80\x99d rather\r\nscheme to die! I know I am not pleasing my heart; I know that if I only\r\nwere concerned, I should like risking a single future. But why should I\r\nplease my useless self overmuch, when by doing otherwise I please those\r\nwho are more valuable than I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn the midst of desultory reflections like these, which alternated\r\nwith surmises as to the inexplicable connection that appeared to exist\r\nbetween her intended husband and Miss Aldclyffe, she heard dull noises\r\noutside the walls of the house, which she could not quite fancy to be\r\ncaused by the wind. She seemed doomed to such disturbances at critical\r\nperiods of her existence. \xe2\x80\x98It is strange,\xe2\x80\x99 she pondered, \xe2\x80\x98that this my\r\nlast night in Knapwater House should be disturbed precisely as my first\r\nwas, no occurrence of the kind having intervened.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs the minutes glided by the noise increased, sounding as if some one\r\nwere beating the wall below her window with a bunch of switches. She\r\nwould gladly have left her room and gone to stay with one of the maids,\r\nbut they were without doubt all asleep.\r\n\r\nThe only person in the house likely to be awake, or who would have\r\nbrains enough to comprehend her nervousness, was Miss Aldclyffe, but\r\nCytherea never cared to go to Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s room, though she was\r\nalways welcome there, and was often almost compelled to go against her\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nThe oft-repeated noise of switches grew heavier upon the wall, and was\r\nnow intermingled with creaks, and a rattling like the rattling of dice.\r\nThe wind blew stronger; there came first a snapping, then a crash, and\r\nsome portion of the mystery was revealed. It was the breaking off and\r\nfall of a branch from one of the large trees outside. The smacking\r\nagainst the wall, and the intermediate rattling, ceased from that time.\r\n\r\nWell, it was the tree which had caused the noises. The unexplained\r\nmatter was that neither of the trees ever touched the walls of the house\r\nduring the highest wind, and that trees could not rattle like a man\r\nplaying castanets or shaking dice.\r\n\r\nShe thought, \xe2\x80\x98Is it the intention of Fate that something connected with\r\nthese noises shall influence my future as in the last case of the kind?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDuring the dilemma she fell into a troubled sleep, and dreamt that she\r\nwas being whipped with dry bones suspended on strings, which rattled at\r\nevery blow like those of a malefactor on a gibbet; that she shifted and\r\nshrank and avoided every blow, and they fell then upon the wall to which\r\nshe was tied. She could not see the face of the executioner for his\r\nmask, but his form was like Manston\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank Heaven!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, when she awoke and saw a faint light\r\nstruggling through her blind. \xe2\x80\x98Now what were those noises?\xe2\x80\x99 To settle\r\nthat question seemed more to her than the event of the day.\r\n\r\nShe pulled the blind aside and looked out. All was plain. The evening\r\nprevious had closed in with a grey drizzle, borne upon a piercing air\r\nfrom the north, and now its effects were visible. The hoary drizzle\r\nstill continued; but the trees and shrubs were laden with icicles to an\r\nextent such as she had never before witnessed. A shoot of the diameter\r\nof a pin\xe2\x80\x99s head was iced as thick as her finger; all the boughs in\r\nthe park were bent almost to the earth with the immense weight of the\r\nglistening incumbrance; the walks were like a looking-glass. Many boughs\r\nhad snapped beneath their burden, and lay in heaps upon the icy grass.\r\nOpposite her eye, on the nearest tree, was a fresh yellow scar, showing\r\nwhere the branch that had terrified her had been splintered from the\r\ntrunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never could have believed it possible,\xe2\x80\x99 she thought, surveying the\r\nbowed-down branches, \xe2\x80\x98that trees would bend so far out of their true\r\npositions without breaking.\xe2\x80\x99 By watching a twig she could see a drop\r\ncollect upon it from the hoary fog, sink to the lowest point, and there\r\nbecome coagulated as the others had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or that I could so exactly have imitated them,\xe2\x80\x99 she continued. \xe2\x80\x98On this\r\nmorning I am to be married--unless this is a scheme of the great Mother\r\nto hinder a union of which she does not approve. Is it possible for my\r\nwedding to take place in the face of such weather as this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n2. MORNING\r\n\r\nHer brother Owen was staying with Manston at the Old House. Contrary\r\nto the opinion of the doctors, the wound had healed after the first\r\nsurgical operation, and his leg was gradually acquiring strength, though\r\nhe could only as yet get about on crutches, or ride, or be dragged in a\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe had arranged that Cytherea should be married from\r\nKnapwater House, and not from her brother\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings at Budmouth, which\r\nwas Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s first idea. Owen, too, seemed to prefer the plan. The\r\ncapricious old maid had latterly taken to the contemplation of the\r\nwedding with even greater warmth than had at first inspired her, and\r\nappeared determined to do everything in her power, consistent with her\r\ndignity, to render the adjuncts of the ceremony pleasing and complete.\r\n\r\nBut the weather seemed in flat contradiction of the whole proceeding. At\r\neight o\xe2\x80\x99clock the coachman crept up to the House almost upon his hands\r\nand knees, entered the kitchen, and stood with his back to the fire,\r\npanting from his exertions in pedestrianism.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen was by far the pleasantest apartment in Knapwater House\r\non such a morning as this. The vast fire was the centre of the whole\r\nsystem, like a sun, and threw its warm rays upon the figures of the\r\ndomestics, wheeling about it in true planetary style. A nervously-feeble\r\nimitation of its flicker was continually attempted by a family of\r\npolished metallic utensils standing in rows and groups against the walls\r\nopposite, the whole collection of shines nearly annihilating the weak\r\ndaylight from outside. A step further in, and the nostrils were greeted\r\nby the scent of green herbs just gathered, and the eye by the plump form\r\nof the cook, wholesome, white-aproned, and floury--looking as edible as\r\nthe food she manipulated--her movements being supported and assisted by\r\nher satellites, the kitchen and scullery maids. Minute recurrent sounds\r\nprevailed--the click of the smoke-jack, the flap of the flames, and the\r\nlight touches of the women\xe2\x80\x99s slippers upon the stone floor.\r\n\r\nThe coachman hemmed, spread his feet more firmly upon the hearthstone,\r\nand looked hard at a small plate in the extreme corner of the dresser.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No wedden this mornen--that\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion. In fact, there can\xe2\x80\x99t be,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid abruptly, as if the words were the mere torso of a many-membered\r\nthought that had existed complete in his head.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen-maid was toasting a slice of bread at the end of a very long\r\ntoasting-fork, which she held at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length towards the unapproachable\r\nfire, travestying the Flanconnade in fencing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bad out of doors, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99 she said, with a look of commiseration for\r\nthings in general.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bad? Not even a liven soul, gentle or simple, can stand on level\r\nground. As to getten up hill to the church, \xe2\x80\x98tis perfect lunacy. And\r\nI speak of foot-passengers. As to horses and carriage, \xe2\x80\x98tis murder\r\nto think of \xe2\x80\x98em. I am going to send straight as a line into the\r\nbreakfast-room, and say \xe2\x80\x98tis a closer.... Hullo--here\xe2\x80\x99s Clerk Crickett\r\nand John Day a-comen! Now just look at \xe2\x80\x98em and picture a wedden if you\r\ncan.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned to the window, from which the clerk and gardener\r\nwere seen crossing the court, bowed and stooping like Bel and Nebo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go if it breaks all the horses\xe2\x80\x99 legs in the county,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the cook, turning from the spectacle, knocking open the oven-door\r\nwith the tongs, glancing critically in, and slamming it together with a\r\nclang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, O; why shall I?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the coachman, including in his auditory by a\r\nglance the clerk and gardener who had just entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because Mr. Manston is in the business. Did you ever know him to give\r\nup for weather of any kind, or for any other mortal thing in heaven or\r\nearth?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98----Mornen so\xe2\x80\x99s--such as it is!\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Mr. Crickett cheerily,\r\ncoming forward to the blaze and warming one hand without looking at the\r\nfire. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Manston gie up for anything in heaven or earth, did you say?\r\nYou might ha\xe2\x80\x99 cut it short by sayen \xe2\x80\x9cto Miss Aldclyffe,\xe2\x80\x9d and leaven out\r\nheaven and earth as trifles. But it might be put off; putten off a thing\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t getten rid of a thing, if that thing is a woman. O no, no!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe coachman and gardener now naturally subsided into secondaries. The\r\ncook went on rather sharply, as she dribbled milk into the exact centre\r\nof a little crater of flour in a platter--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It might be in this case; she\xe2\x80\x99s so indifferent.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dang my old sides! and so it might be. I have a bit of news--I thought\r\nthere was something upon my tongue; but \xe2\x80\x98tis a secret; not a word, mind,\r\nnot a word. Why, Miss Hinton took a holiday yesterday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the cook, looking up with perplexed curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98D\xe2\x80\x99ye think that\xe2\x80\x99s all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be so three-cunning--if it is all, deliver you from the evil of\r\nraising a woman\xe2\x80\x99s expectations wrongfully; I\xe2\x80\x99ll skimmer your pate as\r\nsure as you cry Amen!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t all. When I got home last night my wife said, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nAdelaide took a holiday this mornen,\xe2\x80\x9d says she (my wife, that is);\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwalked over to Nether Mynton, met the comen man, and got married!\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nshe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Got married! what, Lord-a-mercy, did Springrove come?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Springrove, no--no--Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s nothen to do wi\xe2\x80\x99 it--\xe2\x80\x98twas Farmer\r\nBollens. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been playing bo-peep for these two or three months\r\nseemingly. Whilst Master Teddy Springrove has been daddlen, and hawken,\r\nand spetten about having her, she\xe2\x80\x99s quietly left him all forsook. Serve\r\nhim right. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame the little woman a bit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Farmer Bollens is old enough to be her father!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, quite; and rich enough to be ten fathers. They say he\xe2\x80\x99s so rich\r\nthat he has business in every bank, and measures his money in half-pint\r\ncups.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lord, I wish it was me, don\xe2\x80\x99t I wish \xe2\x80\x98twas me!\xe2\x80\x99 said the scullery-maid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, \xe2\x80\x98twas as neat a bit of stitching as ever I heard of,\xe2\x80\x99 continued\r\nthe clerk, with a fixed eye, as if he were watching the process from a\r\ndistance. \xe2\x80\x98Not a soul knew anything about it, and my wife is the only\r\none in our parish who knows it yet. Miss Hinton came back from the\r\nwedden, went to Mr. Manston, puffed herself out large, and said she was\r\nMrs. Bollens, but that if he wished, she had no objection to keep on\r\nthe house till the regular time of giving notice had expired, or till he\r\ncould get another tenant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just like her independence,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, independent or no, she\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Bollens now. Ah, I shall\r\nnever forget once when I went by Farmer Bollens\xe2\x80\x99s garden--years ago\r\nnow--years, when he was taking up ashleaf taties. A merry feller I was\r\nat that time, a very merry feller--for \xe2\x80\x98twas before I took holy orders,\r\nand it didn\xe2\x80\x99t prick my conscience as \xe2\x80\x98twould now. \xe2\x80\x9cFarmer,\xe2\x80\x9d says I,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clittle taties seem to turn out small this year, don\xe2\x80\x99t em?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cO no,\r\nCrickett,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9csome be fair-sized.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s a dull man--Farmer\r\nBollens is--he always was. However, that\xe2\x80\x99s neither here nor there; he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na-married to a sharp woman, and if I don\xe2\x80\x99t make a mistake she\xe2\x80\x99ll bring\r\nhim a pretty good family, gie her time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, it don\xe2\x80\x99t matter; there\xe2\x80\x99s a Providence in it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nscullery-maid. \xe2\x80\x98God A\xe2\x80\x99mighty always sends bread as well as children.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But \xe2\x80\x98tis the bread to one house and the children to another very often.\r\nHowever, I think I can see my lady Hinton\xe2\x80\x99s reason for chosen yesterday\r\nto sickness-or-health-it. Your young miss, and that one, had crossed one\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s path in regard to young Master Springrove; and I expect that\r\nwhen Addy Hinton found Miss Graye wasn\xe2\x80\x99t caren to have en, she thought\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d be beforehand with her old enemy in marrying somebody else too.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s maids\xe2\x80\x99 logic all over, and maids\xe2\x80\x99 malice likewise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWomen who are bad enough to divide against themselves under a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npartiality are good enough to instantly unite in a common cause against\r\nhis attack. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll just tell you one thing then,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cook,\r\nshaking out her words to the time of a whisk she was beating eggs with.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whatever maids\xe2\x80\x99 logic is and maids\xe2\x80\x99 malice too, if Cytherea Graye even\r\nnow knows that young Springrove is free again, she\xe2\x80\x99ll fling over the\r\nsteward as soon as look at him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no: not now,\xe2\x80\x99 the coachman broke in like a moderator. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhonour in that maid, if ever there was in one. No Miss Hinton\xe2\x80\x99s tricks\r\nin her. She\xe2\x80\x99ll stick to Manston.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pifh!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t let a word be said till the wedden is over, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe clerk continued. \xe2\x80\x98Miss Aldclyffe would fairly hang and quarter me,\r\nif my news broke off that there wedden at a last minute like this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you had better get your wife to bolt you in the closet for an hour\r\nor two, for you\xe2\x80\x99ll chatter it yourself to the whole boiling parish if\r\nshe don\xe2\x80\x99t! \xe2\x80\x98Tis a poor womanly feller!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 begun it, clerk. I knew how \xe2\x80\x98twould be,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\ngardener soothingly, in a whisper to the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s mangled remains.\r\n\r\nThe clerk turned and smiled at the fire, and warmed his other hand.\r\n\r\n3. NOON\r\n\r\nThe weather gave way. In half-an-hour there began a rapid thaw. By\r\nten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the roads, though still dangerous, were practicable to the\r\nextent of the half-mile required by the people of Knapwater Park. One\r\nmass of heavy leaden cloud spread over the whole sky; the air began to\r\nfeel damp and mild out of doors, though still cold and frosty within.\r\n\r\nThey reached the church and passed up the nave, the deep-coloured glass\r\nof the narrow windows rendering the gloom of the morning almost night\r\nitself inside the building. Then the ceremony began. The only warmth\r\nor spirit imported into it came from the bridegroom, who retained a\r\nvigorous--even Spenserian--bridal-mood throughout the morning.\r\n\r\nCytherea was as firm as he at this critical moment, but as cold as the\r\nair surrounding her. The few persons forming the wedding-party were\r\nconstrained in movement and tone, and from the nave of the church came\r\noccasional coughs, emitted by those who, in spite of the weather, had\r\nassembled to see the termination of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s existence as a single\r\nwoman. Many poor people loved her. They pitied her success, why, they\r\ncould not tell, except that it was because she seemed to stand more like\r\na statue than Cytherea Graye.\r\n\r\nYet she was prettily and carefully dressed; a strange contradiction in\r\na man\xe2\x80\x99s idea of things--a saddening, perplexing contradiction. Are\r\nthere any points in which a difference of sex amounts to a difference of\r\nnature? Then this is surely one. Not so much, as it is commonly put, in\r\nregard to the amount of consideration given, but in the conception of\r\nthe thing considered. A man emasculated by coxcombry may spend more time\r\nupon the arrangement of his clothes than any woman, but even then there\r\nis no fetichism in his idea of them--they are still only a covering\r\nhe uses for a time. But here was Cytherea, in the bottom of her heart\r\nalmost indifferent to life, yet possessing an instinct with which her\r\nheart had nothing to do, the instinct to be particularly regardful of\r\nthose sorry trifles, her robe, her flowers, her veil, and her gloves.\r\n\r\nThe irrevocable words were soon spoken--the indelible writing soon\r\nwritten--and they came out of the vestry. Candles had been necessary\r\nhere to enable them to sign their names, and on their return to the\r\nchurch the light from the candles streamed from the small open door,\r\nand across the chancel to a black chestnut screen on the south side,\r\ndividing it from a small chapel or chantry, erected for the soul\xe2\x80\x99s peace\r\nof some Aldclyffe of the past. Through the open-work of this screen\r\ncould now be seen illuminated, inside the chantry, the reclining figures\r\nof cross-legged knights, damp and green with age, and above them a\r\nhuge classic monument, also inscribed to the Aldclyffe family, heavily\r\nsculptured in cadaverous marble.\r\n\r\nLeaning here--almost hanging to the monument--was Edward Springrove, or\r\nhis spirit.\r\n\r\nThe weak daylight would never have revealed him, shaded as he was by the\r\nscreen; but the unexpected rays of candle-light in the front showed him\r\nforth in startling relief to any and all of those whose eyes wandered in\r\nthat direction. The sight was a sad one--sad beyond all description. His\r\neyes were wild, their orbits leaden. His face was of a sickly paleness,\r\nhis hair dry and disordered, his lips parted as if he could get no\r\nbreath. His figure was spectre-thin. His actions seemed beyond his own\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nManston did not see him; Cytherea did. The healing effect upon her heart\r\nof a year\xe2\x80\x99s silence--a year and a half\xe2\x80\x99s separation--was undone in\r\nan instant. One of those strange revivals of passion by mere\r\nsight--commoner in women than in men, and in oppressed women commonest\r\nof all--had taken place in her--so transcendently, that even to herself\r\nit seemed more like a new creation than a revival.\r\n\r\nMarrying for a home--what a mockery it was!\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the means most potent for rekindling old love in a\r\nmaiden\xe2\x80\x99s heart are, to see her lover in laughter and good spirits in her\r\ndespite when the breach has been owing to a slight from herself; when\r\nowing to a slight from him, to see him suffering for his own fault. If\r\nhe is happy in a clear conscience, she blames him; if he is miserable\r\nbecause deeply to blame, she blames herself. The latter was Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncase now.\r\n\r\nFirst, an agony of face told of the suppressed misery within her, which\r\npresently could be suppressed no longer. When they were coming out of\r\nthe porch, there broke from her in a low plaintive scream the words,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s dying--dying! O God, save us!\xe2\x80\x99 She began to sink down, and would\r\nhave fallen had not Manston caught her. The chief bridesmaid applied her\r\nvinaigrette.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did she say?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Manston.\r\n\r\nOwen was the only one to whom the words were intelligible, and he was\r\nfar too deeply impressed, or rather alarmed, to reply. She did not\r\nfaint, and soon began to recover her self-command. Owen took advantage\r\nof the hindrance to step back to where the apparition had been seen.\r\nHe was enraged with Springrove for what he considered an unwarrantable\r\nintrusion.\r\n\r\nBut Edward was not in the chantry. As he had come, so he had gone,\r\nnobody could tell how or whither.\r\n\r\n4. AFTERNOON\r\n\r\nIt might almost have been believed that a transmutation had taken place\r\nin Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s idiosyncrasy, that her moral nature had fled.\r\n\r\nThe wedding-party returned to the house. As soon as he could find an\r\nopportunity, Owen took his sister aside to speak privately with her\r\non what had happened. The expression of her face was hard, wild, and\r\nunreal--an expression he had never seen there before, and it disturbed\r\nhim. He spoke to her severely and sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cytherea,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98I know the cause of this emotion of yours. But\r\nremember this, there was no excuse for it. You should have been woman\r\nenough to control yourself. Remember whose wife you are, and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink anything more of a mean-spirited fellow like Springrove; he had\r\nno business to come there as he did. You are altogether wrong, Cytherea,\r\nand I am vexed with you more than I can say--very vexed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say ashamed of me at once,\xe2\x80\x99 she bitterly answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am ashamed of you,\xe2\x80\x99 he retorted angrily; \xe2\x80\x98the mood has not left you\r\nyet, then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Owen,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, and paused. Her lip trembled; her eye told of\r\nsensations too deep for tears. \xe2\x80\x98No, Owen, it has not left me; and I will\r\nbe honest. I own now to you, without any disguise of words, what last\r\nnight I did not own to myself, because I hardly knew of it. I love\r\nEdward Springrove with all my strength, and heart, and soul. You call me\r\na wanton for it, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? I don\xe2\x80\x99t care; I have gone beyond caring for\r\nanything!\xe2\x80\x99 She looked stonily into his face and made the speech calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, poor Cytherea, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk like that!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, alarmed at her\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought that I did not love him at all,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on hysterically. \xe2\x80\x98A\r\nyear and a half had passed since we met. I could go by the gate of his\r\ngarden without thinking of him--look at his seat in church and not care.\r\nBut I saw him this morning--dying because he loves me so--I know it is\r\nthat! Can I help loving him too? No, I cannot, and I will love him, and\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t care! We have been separated somehow by some contrivance--I know\r\nwe have. O, if I could only die!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe held her in his arms. \xe2\x80\x98Many a woman has gone to ruin herself,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98and brought those who love her into disgrace, by acting upon such\r\nimpulses as possess you now. I have a reputation to lose as well as you.\r\nIt seems that do what I will by way of remedying the stains which fell\r\nupon us, it is all doomed to be undone again.\xe2\x80\x99 His voice grew husky as\r\nhe made the reply.\r\n\r\nThe right and only effective chord had been touched. Since she had\r\nseen Edward, she had thought only of herself and him. Owen--her\r\nname--position--future--had been as if they did not exist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t give way and become a disgrace to _you_, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Besides, your duty to society, and those about you, requires that you\r\nshould live with (at any rate) all the appearance of a good wife, and\r\ntry to love your husband.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--my duty to society,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured. \xe2\x80\x98But ah, Owen, it is difficult\r\nto adjust our outer and inner life with perfect honesty to all! Though\r\nit may be right to care more for the benefit of the many than for the\r\nindulgence of your own single self, when you consider that the many, and\r\nduty to them, only exist to you through your own existence, what can be\r\nsaid? What do our own acquaintances care about us? Not much. I think of\r\nmine. Mine will now (do they learn all the wicked frailty of my heart in\r\nthis affair) look at me, smile sickly, and condemn me. And perhaps, far\r\nin time to come, when I am dead and gone, some other\xe2\x80\x99s accent, or some\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s song, or thought, like an old one of mine, will carry them back\r\nto what I used to say, and hurt their hearts a little that they blamed\r\nme so soon. And they will pause just for an instant, and give a sigh to\r\nme, and think, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor girl!\xe2\x80\x9d believing they do great justice to my\r\nmemory by this. But they will never, never realize that it was my single\r\nopportunity of existence, as well as of doing my duty, which they are\r\nregarding; they will not feel that what to them is but a thought, easily\r\nheld in those two words of pity, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor girl!\xe2\x80\x9d was a whole life to me;\r\nas full of hours, minutes, and peculiar minutes, of hopes and dreads,\r\nsmiles, whisperings, tears, as theirs: that it was my world, what is to\r\nthem their world, and they in that life of mine, however much I cared\r\nfor them, only as the thought I seem to them to be. Nobody can enter\r\ninto another\xe2\x80\x99s nature truly, that\xe2\x80\x99s what is so grievous.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, it cannot be helped,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But we must not stay here,\xe2\x80\x99 she continued, starting up and going. \xe2\x80\x98We\r\nshall be missed. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best, Owen--I will, indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt had been decided that on account of the wretched state of the roads,\r\nthe newly-married pair should not drive to the station till the latest\r\nhour in the afternoon at which they could get a train to take them to\r\nSouthampton (their destination that night) by a reasonable time in the\r\nevening. They intended the next morning to cross to Havre, and thence to\r\nParis--a place Cytherea had never visited--for their wedding tour.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon drew on. The packing was done. Cytherea was so restless\r\nthat she could stay still nowhere. Miss Aldclyffe, who, though she took\r\nlittle part in the day\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings, was, as it were, instinctively\r\nconscious of all their movements, put down her charge\xe2\x80\x99s agitation for\r\nonce as the natural result of the novel event, and Manston himself was\r\nas indulgent as could be wished.\r\n\r\nAt length Cytherea wandered alone into the conservatory. When in it,\r\nshe thought she would run across to the hot-house in the outer garden,\r\nhaving in her heart a whimsical desire that she should also like to\r\ntake a last look at the familiar flowers and luxuriant leaves collected\r\nthere. She pulled on a pair of overshoes, and thither she went. Not\r\na soul was in or around the place. The gardener was making merry on\r\nManston\xe2\x80\x99s and her account.\r\n\r\nThe happiness that a generous spirit derives from the belief that it\r\nexists in others is often greater than the primary happiness itself. The\r\ngardener thought \xe2\x80\x98How happy they are!\xe2\x80\x99 and the thought made him happier\r\nthan they.\r\n\r\nComing out of the forcing-house again, she was on the point of returning\r\nindoors, when a feeling that these moments of solitude would be her last\r\nof freedom induced her to prolong them a little, and she stood\r\nstill, unheeding the wintry aspect of the curly-leaved plants, the\r\nstraw-covered beds, and the bare fruit-trees around her. The garden, no\r\npart of which was visible from the house, sloped down to a narrow river\r\nat the foot, dividing it from the meadows without.\r\n\r\nA man was lingering along the public path on the other side of the\r\nriver; she fancied she knew the form. Her resolutions, taken in the\r\npresence of Owen, did not fail her now. She hoped and prayed that it\r\nmight not be one who had stolen her heart away, and still kept it. Why\r\nshould he have reappeared at all, when he had declared that he went out\r\nof her sight for ever?\r\n\r\nShe hastily hid herself, in the lowest corner of the garden close to the\r\nriver. A large dead tree, thickly robed in ivy, had been considerably\r\ndepressed by its icy load of the morning, and hung low over the stream,\r\nwhich here ran slow and deep. The tree screened her from the eyes of any\r\npasser on the other side.\r\n\r\nShe waited timidly, and her timidity increased. She would not allow\r\nherself to see him--she would hear him pass, and then look to see if it\r\nhad been Edward.\r\n\r\nBut, before she heard anything, she became aware of an object reflected\r\nin the water from under the tree which hung over the river in such a way\r\nthat, though hiding the actual path, and objects upon it, it permitted\r\ntheir reflected images to pass beneath its boughs. The reflected form\r\nwas that of the man she had seen further off, but being inverted, she\r\ncould not definitely characterize him.\r\n\r\nHe was looking at the upper windows of the House--at hers--was it\r\nEdward, indeed? If so, he was probably thinking he would like to say\r\none parting word. He came closer, gazed into the stream, and walked very\r\nslowly. She was almost certain that it was Edward. She kept more safely\r\nhidden. Conscience told her that she ought not to see him. But she\r\nsuddenly asked herself a question: \xe2\x80\x98Can it be possible that he sees my\r\nreflected image, as I see his? Of course he does!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was looking at her in the water.\r\n\r\nShe could not help herself now. She stepped forward just as he emerged\r\nfrom the other side of the tree and appeared erect before her. It was\r\nEdward Springrove--till the inverted vision met his eye, dreaming no\r\nmore of seeing his Cytherea there than of seeing the dead themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cytherea!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Springrove,\xe2\x80\x99 she returned, in a low voice, across the stream.\r\n\r\nHe was the first to speak again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Since we have met, I want to tell you something, before we become quite\r\nas strangers to each other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--not now--I did not mean to speak--it is not right, Edward.\xe2\x80\x99 She\r\nspoke hurriedly and turned away from him, beating the air with her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not one common word of explanation?\xe2\x80\x99 he implored. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am bad\r\nenough to try to lead you astray. Well, go--it is better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met again. She was nearly choked. O, how she longed--and\r\ndreaded--to hear his explanation!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it?\xe2\x80\x99 she said desperately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is that I did not come to the church this morning in order to\r\ndistress you: I did not, Cytherea. It was to try to speak to you before\r\nyou were--married.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe stepped closer, and went on, \xe2\x80\x98You know what has taken place? Surely\r\nyou do?--my cousin is married, and I am free.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Married--and not to you?\xe2\x80\x99 Cytherea faltered, in a weak whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, she was married yesterday! A rich man had appeared, and she jilted\r\nme. She said she never would have jilted a stranger, but that by jilting\r\nme, she only exercised the right everybody has of snubbing their own\r\nrelations. But that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing now. I came to you to ask once more if....\r\nBut I was too late.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, Edward, what\xe2\x80\x99s that, what\xe2\x80\x99s that!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried, in an agony of\r\nreproach. \xe2\x80\x98Why did you leave me to return to her? Why did you write me\r\nthat cruel, cruel letter that nearly killed me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cytherea! Why, you had grown to love--like--Mr. Manston, and how could\r\nyou be anything to me--or care for me? Surely I acted naturally?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no--never! I loved you--only you--not him--always you!--till\r\nlately.... I try to love him now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But that can\xe2\x80\x99t be correct! Miss Aldclyffe told me that you wanted to\r\nhear no more of me--proved it to me!\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never! she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She did, Cytherea. And she sent me a letter--a love-letter, you wrote\r\nto Mr. Manston.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A love-letter I wrote?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, a love-letter--you could not meet him just then, you said you\r\nwere sorry, but the emotion you had felt with him made you forgetful of\r\nrealities.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe strife of thought in the unhappy girl who listened to this\r\ndistortion of her meaning could find no vent in words. And then there\r\nfollowed the slow revelation in return, bringing with it all the misery\r\nof an explanation which comes too late. The question whether Miss\r\nAldclyffe were schemer or dupe was almost passed over by Cytherea,\r\nunder the immediate oppressiveness of her despair in the sense that her\r\nposition was irretrievable.\r\n\r\nNot so Springrove. He saw through all the cunning\r\nhalf-misrepresentations--worse than downright lies--which had just been\r\nsufficient to turn the scale both with him and with her; and from the\r\nbottom of his soul he cursed the woman and man who had brought all this\r\nagony upon him and his Love. But he could not add more misery to the\r\nfuture of the poor child by revealing too much. The whole scheme she\r\nshould never know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was indifferent to my own future,\xe2\x80\x99 Edward said, \xe2\x80\x98and was urged to\r\npromise adherence to my engagement with my cousin Adelaide by Miss\r\nAldclyffe: now you are married I cannot tell you how, but it was on\r\naccount of my father. Being forbidden to think of you, what did I care\r\nabout anything? My new thought that you still loved me was first raised\r\nby what my father said in the letter announcing my cousin\xe2\x80\x99s marriage. He\r\nsaid that although you were to be married on Old Christmas Day--that\r\nis to-morrow--he had noticed your appearance with pity: he thought\r\nyou loved me still. It was enough for me--I came down by the earliest\r\nmorning train, thinking I could see you some time to-day, the day, as I\r\nthought, before your marriage, hoping, but hardly daring to hope, that\r\nyou might be induced to marry me. I hurried from the station; when I\r\nreached the village I saw idlers about the church, and the private gate\r\nleading to the House open. I ran into the church by the small door and\r\nsaw you come out of the vestry; I was too late. I have now told you.\r\nI was compelled to tell you. O, my lost darling, now I shall live\r\ncontent--or die content!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am to blame, Edward, I am,\xe2\x80\x99 she said mournfully; \xe2\x80\x98I was taught to\r\ndread pauperism; my nights were made sleepless; there was continually\r\nreiterated in my ears till I believed it--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThe world and its ways have a certain worth,\r\n       And to press a point where these oppose\r\n       Were a simple policy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I will say nothing about who influenced--who persuaded. The act\r\nis mine, after all. Edward, I married to escape dependence for my bread\r\nupon the whim of Miss Aldclyffe, or others like her. It was clearly\r\nrepresented to me that dependence is bearable if we have another place\r\nwhich we can call home; but to be a dependent and to have no other spot\r\nfor the heart to anchor upon--O, it is mournful and harassing!... But\r\nthat without which all persuasion would have been as air, was added by\r\nmy miserable conviction that you were false; that did it, that turned\r\nme! You were to be considered as nobody to me, and Mr. Manston was\r\ninvariably kind. Well, the deed is done--I must abide by it. I shall\r\nnever let him know that I do not love him--never. If things had only\r\nremained as they seemed to be, if you had really forgotten me and\r\nmarried another woman, I could have borne it better. I wish I did not\r\nknow the truth as I know it now! But our life, what is it? Let us be\r\nbrave, Edward, and live out our few remaining years with dignity. They\r\nwill not be long. O, I hope they will not be long!... Now, good-bye,\r\ngood-bye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I could be near and touch you once, just once,\xe2\x80\x99 said Springrove,\r\nin a voice which he vainly endeavoured to keep firm and clear.\r\n\r\nThey looked at the river, then into it; a shoal of minnows was floating\r\nover the sandy bottom, like the black dashes on miniver; though narrow,\r\nthe stream was deep, and there was no bridge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cytherea, reach out your hand that I may just touch it with mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe stepped to the brink and stretched out her hand and fingers towards\r\nhis, but not into them. The river was too wide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, her voice broken by agitation, \xe2\x80\x98I must be\r\ngoing. God bless and keep you, my Edward! God bless you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must touch you, I must press your hand,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\nThey came near--nearer--nearer still--their fingers met. There was\r\na long firm clasp, so close and still that each hand could feel the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s pulse throbbing beside its own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My Cytherea! my stolen pet lamb!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe glanced a mute farewell from her large perturbed eyes, turned, and\r\nran up the garden without looking back. All was over between them.\r\nThe river flowed on as quietly and obtusely as ever, and the minnows\r\ngathered again in their favourite spot as if they had never been\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nNobody indoors guessed from her countenance and bearing that her heart\r\nwas near to breaking with the intensity of the misery which gnawed\r\nthere. At these times a woman does not faint, or weep, or scream, as she\r\nwill in the moment of sudden shocks. When lanced by a mental agony\r\nof such refined and special torture that it is indescribable by men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords, she moves among her acquaintances much as before, and contrives\r\nso to cast her actions in the old moulds that she is only considered to\r\nbe rather duller than usual.\r\n\r\n5. HALF-PAST TWO TO FIVE O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK P.M.\r\n\r\nOwen accompanied the newly-married couple to the railway-station, and in\r\nhis anxiety to see the last of his sister, left the brougham and stood\r\nupon his crutches whilst the train was starting.\r\n\r\nWhen the husband and wife were about to enter the railway-carriage they\r\nsaw one of the porters looking frequently and furtively at them. He was\r\npale, and apparently very ill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look at that poor sick man,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea compassionately, \xe2\x80\x98surely he\r\nought not to be here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s been very queer to-day, madam, very queer,\xe2\x80\x99 another porter\r\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x98He do hardly hear when he\xe2\x80\x99s spoken to, and d\xe2\x80\x99 seem giddy, or\r\nas if something was on his mind. He\xe2\x80\x99s been like it for this month past,\r\nbut nothing so bad as he is to-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe could not resist an innate desire to do some just thing on this most\r\ndeceitful and wretched day of her life. Going up to him she gave him\r\nmoney, and told him to send to the old manor-house for wine or whatever\r\nhe wanted.\r\n\r\nThe train moved off as the trembling man was murmuring his incoherent\r\nthanks. Owen waved his hand; Cytherea smiled back to him as if it were\r\nunknown to her that she wept all the while.\r\n\r\nOwen was driven back to the Old House. But he could not rest in the\r\nlonely place. His conscience began to reproach him for having forced on\r\nthe marriage of his sister with a little too much peremptoriness. Taking\r\nup his crutches he went out of doors and wandered about the muddy roads\r\nwith no object in view save that of getting rid of time.\r\n\r\nThe clouds which had hung so low and densely during the day cleared from\r\nthe west just now as the sun was setting, calling forth a weakly twitter\r\nfrom a few small birds. Owen crawled down the path to the waterfall, and\r\nlingered thereabout till the solitude of the place oppressed him, when\r\nhe turned back and into the road to the village. He was sad; he said to\r\nhimself--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If there is ever any meaning in those heavy feelings which are called\r\npresentiments--and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there is--there will be in mine\r\nto-day.... Poor little Cytherea!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt that moment the last low rays of the sun touched the head and\r\nshoulders of a man who was approaching, and showed him up to Owen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nview. It was old Mr. Springrove. They had grown familiar with each other\r\nby reason of Owen\xe2\x80\x99s visits to Knapwater during the past year. The farmer\r\ninquired how Owen\xe2\x80\x99s foot was progressing, and was glad to see him so\r\nnimble again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How is your son?\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen mechanically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is at home, sitting by the fire,\xe2\x80\x99 said the farmer, in a sad voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This morning he slipped indoors from God knows where, and there he sits\r\nand mopes, and thinks, and thinks, and presses his head so hard, that I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling for him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he married?\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen. Cytherea had feared to tell him of the\r\ninterview in the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. I can\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand how the matter rests.... Ah! Edward, too,\r\nwho started with such promise; that he should now have become such a\r\ncareless fellow--not a month in one place. There, Mr. Graye, I know what\r\nit is mainly owing to. If it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for that heart affair, he might\r\nhave done--but the less said about him the better. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what we\r\nshould have done if Miss Aldclyffe had insisted upon the conditions of\r\nthe leases. Your brother-in-law, the steward, had a hand in making\r\nit light for us, I know, and I heartily thank him for it.\xe2\x80\x99 He ceased\r\nspeaking, and looked round at the sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you heard o\xe2\x80\x99 what\xe2\x80\x99s happened?\xe2\x80\x99 he said suddenly; \xe2\x80\x98I was just\r\ncoming out to learn about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard of anything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is something very serious, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what. All I know is\r\nwhat I heard a man call out bynow--that it very much concerns somebody\r\nwho lives in the parish.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt seems singular enough, even to minds who have no dim beliefs in\r\nadumbration and presentiment, that at that moment not the shadow of a\r\nthought crossed Owen\xe2\x80\x99s mind that the somebody whom the matter concerned\r\nmight be himself, or any belonging to him. The event about to transpire\r\nwas as portentous to the woman whose welfare was more dear to him than\r\nhis own, as any, short of death itself, could possibly be; and ever\r\nafterwards, when he considered the effect of the knowledge the next\r\nhalf-hour conveyed to his brain, even his practical good sense could not\r\nrefrain from wonder that he should have walked toward the village after\r\nhearing those words of the farmer, in so leisurely and unconcerned a\r\nway. \xe2\x80\x98How unutterably mean must my intelligence have appeared to the eye\r\nof a foreseeing God,\xe2\x80\x99 he frequently said in after-time. \xe2\x80\x98Columbus on the\r\neve of his discovery of a world was not so contemptibly unaware.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter a few additional words of common-place the farmer left him, and,\r\nas has been said, Owen proceeded slowly and indifferently towards the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nThe labouring men had just left work, and passed the park gate, which\r\nopened into the street as Owen came down towards it. They went along in\r\na drift, earnestly talking, and were finally about to turn in at their\r\nrespective doorways. But upon seeing him they looked significantly at\r\none another, and paused. He came into the road, on that side of the\r\nvillage-green which was opposite the row of cottages, and turned round\r\nto the right. When Owen turned, all eyes turned; one or two men went\r\nhurriedly indoors, and afterwards appeared at the doorstep with their\r\nwives, who also contemplated him, talking as they looked. They seemed\r\nuncertain how to act in some matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If they want me, surely they will call me,\xe2\x80\x99 he thought, wondering\r\nmore and more. He could no longer doubt that he was connected with the\r\nsubject of their discourse.\r\n\r\nThe first who approached him was a boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What has occurred?\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, a man ha\xe2\x80\x99 got crazy-religious, and sent for the pa\xe2\x80\x99son.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir. He wished he was dead, he said, and he\xe2\x80\x99s almost out of his\r\nmind wi\xe2\x80\x99 wishen it so much. That was before Mr. Raunham came.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is he?\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Joseph Chinney, one of the railway-porters; he used to be\r\nnight-porter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--the man who was ill this afternoon; by the way, he was told to come\r\nto the Old House for something, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been. But has anything\r\nelse happened--anything that concerns the wedding to-day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nConcluding that the connection which had seemed to be traced between\r\nhimself and the event must in some way have arisen from Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriendliness towards the man, Owen turned about and went homewards in\r\na much quieter frame of mind--yet scarcely satisfied with the solution.\r\nThe route he had chosen led through the dairy-yard, and he opened the\r\ngate.\r\n\r\nFive minutes before this point of time, Edward Springrove was looking\r\nover one of his father\xe2\x80\x99s fields at an outlying hamlet of three or four\r\ncottages some mile and a half distant. A turnpike-gate was close by the\r\ngate of the field.\r\n\r\nThe carrier to Casterbridge came up as Edward stepped into the road, and\r\njumped down from the van to pay toll. He recognized Springrove. \xe2\x80\x98This is\r\na pretty set-to in your place, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know about it,\r\nI suppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 said Springrove.\r\n\r\nThe carrier paid his dues, came up to Edward, and spoke ten words in a\r\nconfidential whisper: then sprang upon the shafts of his vehicle, gave a\r\nclinching nod of significance to Springrove, and rattled away.\r\n\r\nEdward turned pale with the intelligence. His first thought was, \xe2\x80\x98Bring\r\nher home!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe next--did Owen Graye know what had been discovered? He probably\r\ndid by that time, but no risks of probability must be run by a woman\r\nhe loved dearer than all the world besides. He would at any rate make\r\nperfectly sure that her brother was in possession of the knowledge, by\r\ntelling it him with his own lips.\r\n\r\nOff he ran in the direction of the old manor-house.\r\n\r\nThe path was across arable land, and was ploughed up with the rest of\r\nthe field every autumn, after which it was trodden out afresh. The thaw\r\nhad so loosened the soft earth, that lumps of stiff mud were lifted\r\nby his feet at every leap he took, and flung against him by his rapid\r\nmotion, as it were doggedly impeding him, and increasing tenfold the\r\ncustomary effort of running,\r\n\r\nBut he ran on--uphill, and downhill, the same pace alike--like the\r\nshadow of a cloud. His nearest direction, too, like Owen\xe2\x80\x99s, was through\r\nthe dairy-barton, and as Owen entered it he saw the figure of Edward\r\nrapidly descending the opposite hill, at a distance of two or three\r\nhundred yards. Owen advanced amid the cows.\r\n\r\nThe dairyman, who had hitherto been talking loudly on some absorbing\r\nsubject to the maids and men milking around him, turned his face towards\r\nthe head of the cow when Owen passed, and ceased speaking.\r\n\r\nOwen approached him and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A singular thing has happened, I hear. The man is not insane, I\r\nsuppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not he--he\xe2\x80\x99s sensible enough,\xe2\x80\x99 said the dairyman, and paused. He was a\r\nman noisy with his associates--stolid and taciturn with strangers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it true that he is Chinney, the railway-porter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the man, sir.\xe2\x80\x99 The maids and men sitting under the cows were all\r\nattentively listening to this discourse, milking irregularly, and softly\r\ndirecting the jets against the sides of the pail.\r\n\r\nOwen could contain himself no longer, much as his mind dreaded anything\r\nof the nature of ridicule. \xe2\x80\x98The people all seem to look at me, as if\r\nsomething seriously concerned me; is it this stupid matter, or what is\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely, sir, you know better than anybody else if such a strange thing\r\nconcerns you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What strange thing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know! His confessing to Parson Raunham.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did he confess? Tell me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you really ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t heard, \xe2\x80\x98tis this. He was as usual on duty at the\r\nstation on the night of the fire last year, otherwise he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nknown it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Known what? For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake tell, man!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut at this instant the two opposite gates of the dairy-yard, one on the\r\neast, the other on the west side, slammed almost simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe rector from one, Springrove from the other, came striding across the\r\nbarton.\r\n\r\nEdward was nearest, and spoke first. He said in a low voice: \xe2\x80\x98Your\r\nsister is not legally married! His first wife is still living! How it\r\ncomes out I don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, here you are at last, Mr. Graye, thank Heaven!\xe2\x80\x99 said the rector\r\nbreathlessly. \xe2\x80\x98I have been to the Old House, and then to Miss\r\nAldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s looking for you--something very extraordinary.\xe2\x80\x99 He beckoned\r\nto Owen, afterwards included Springrove in his glance, and the three\r\nstepped aside together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A porter at the station. He was a curious nervous man. He had been in a\r\nstrange state all day, but he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go home. Your sister was kind\r\nto him, it seems, this afternoon. When she and her husband had gone, he\r\nwent on with his work, shifting luggage-vans. Well, he got in the way,\r\nas if he were quite lost to what was going on, and they sent him home at\r\nlast. Then he wished to see me. I went directly. There was something\r\non his mind, he said, and told it. About the time when the fire of last\r\nNovember twelvemonth was got under, whilst he was by himself in the\r\nporter\xe2\x80\x99s room, almost asleep, somebody came to the station and tried to\r\nopen the door. He went out and found the person to be the lady he had\r\naccompanied to Carriford earlier in the evening, Mrs. Manston. She\r\nasked, when would be another train to London? The first the next\r\nmorning, he told her, was at a quarter-past six o\xe2\x80\x99clock from Budmouth,\r\nbut that it was express, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop at Carriford Road--it didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstop till it got to Anglebury. \xe2\x80\x9cHow far is it to Anglebury?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\nHe told her, and she thanked him, and went away up the line. In a short\r\ntime she ran back and took out her purse. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t on any account say\r\na word in the village or anywhere that I have been here, or a single\r\nbreath about me--I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed ever to have come.\xe2\x80\x9d He promised; she took\r\nout two sovereigns. \xe2\x80\x9cSwear it on the Testament in the waiting-room,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you these.\xe2\x80\x9d He got the book, took an oath upon it,\r\nreceived the money, and she left him. He was off duty at half-past\r\nfive. He has kept silence all through the intervening time till now, but\r\nlately the knowledge he possessed weighed heavily upon his conscience\r\nand weak mind. Yet the nearer came the wedding-day, the more he feared\r\nto tell. The actual marriage filled him with remorse. He says your\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s kindness afterwards was like a knife going through his heart.\r\nHe thought he had ruined her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But whatever can be done? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he speak sooner?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Owen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He actually called at my house twice yesterday,\xe2\x80\x99 the rector continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98resolved, it seems, to unburden his mind. I was out both times--he\r\nleft no message, and, they say, he looked relieved that his object was\r\ndefeated. Then he says he resolved to come to you at the Old House last\r\nnight--started, reached the door, and dreaded to knock--and then went\r\nhome again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here will be a tale for the newsmongers of the county,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen\r\nbitterly. \xe2\x80\x98The idea of his not opening his mouth sooner--the criminality\r\nof the thing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s the inconsistency of a weak nature. But now that it is put\r\nto us in this way, how much more probable it seems that she should have\r\nescaped than have been burnt--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will, of course, go straight to Mr. Manston, and ask him what it\r\nall means?\xe2\x80\x99 Edward interrupted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I shall! Manston has no right to carry off my sister unless\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s her husband,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen. \xe2\x80\x98I shall go and separate them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly you will,\xe2\x80\x99 said the rector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s the man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In his cottage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis no use going to him, either. I must go off at once and overtake\r\nthem--lay the case before Manston, and ask him for additional and\r\ncertain proofs of his first wife\xe2\x80\x99s death. An up-train passes soon, I\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where have they gone?\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To Paris--as far as Southampton this afternoon, to proceed to-morrow\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where in Southampton?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know--some hotel. I only have their Paris address. But I\r\nshall find them by making a few inquiries.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe rector had in the meantime been taking out his pocket-book, and now\r\nopened it at the first page, whereon it was his custom every month to\r\ngum a small railway time-table--cut from the local newspaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The afternoon express is just gone,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, holding open the page,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and the next train to Southampton passes at ten minutes to six o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\nNow it wants--let me see--five-and-forty minutes to that time. Mr.\r\nGraye, my advice is that you come with me to the porter\xe2\x80\x99s cottage, where\r\nI will shortly write out the substance of what he has said, and get\r\nhim to sign it. You will then have far better grounds for interfering\r\nbetween Mr. and Mrs. Manston than if you went to them with a mere\r\nhearsay story.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe suggestion seemed a good one. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, there will be time before the\r\ntrain starts,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen.\r\n\r\nEdward had been musing restlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me go to Southampton in your place, on account of your lameness?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said suddenly to Graye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am much obliged to you, but I think I can scarcely accept the offer,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreturned Owen coldly. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Manston is an honourable man, and I had much\r\nbetter see him myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no doubt,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Raunham, \xe2\x80\x98that the death of his wife was\r\nfully believed in by himself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None whatever,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen; \xe2\x80\x98and the news must be broken to him, and the\r\nquestion of other proofs asked, in a friendly way. It would not do for\r\nMr. Springrove to appear in the case at all.\xe2\x80\x99 He still spoke rather\r\ncoldly; the recollection of the attachment between his sister and Edward\r\nwas not a pleasant one to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will never find them,\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward. \xe2\x80\x98You have never been to\r\nSouthampton, and I know every house there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That makes little difference,\xe2\x80\x99 said the rector; \xe2\x80\x98he will have a cab.\r\nCertainly Mr. Graye is the proper man to go on the errand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay; I\xe2\x80\x99ll telegraph to ask them to meet me when I arrive at the\r\nterminus,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen; \xe2\x80\x98that is, if their train has not already arrived.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Raunham pulled out his pocket-book again. \xe2\x80\x98The two-thirty train\r\nreached Southampton a quarter of an hour ago,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\nIt was too late to catch them at the station. Nevertheless, the rector\r\nsuggested that it would be worth while to direct a message to \xe2\x80\x98all the\r\nrespectable hotels in Southampton,\xe2\x80\x99 on the chance of its finding them,\r\nand thus saving a deal of personal labour to Owen in searching about the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and telegraph, whilst you return to the man,\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward--an\r\noffer which was accepted. Graye and the rector then turned off in the\r\ndirection of the porter\xe2\x80\x99s cottage.\r\n\r\nEdward, to despatch the message at once, hurriedly followed the road\r\ntowards the station, still restlessly thinking. All Owen\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings\r\nwere based on the assumption, natural under the circumstances, of\r\nManston\xe2\x80\x99s good faith, and that he would readily acquiesce in any\r\narrangement which should clear up the mystery. \xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Edward,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98suppose--and Heaven forgive me, I cannot help supposing it--that\r\nManston is not that honourable man, what will a young and inexperienced\r\nfellow like Owen do? Will he not be hoodwinked by some specious story\r\nor another, framed to last till Manston gets tired of poor Cytherea?\r\nAnd then the disclosure of the truth will ruin and blacken both their\r\nfutures irremediably.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, he proceeded to execute his commission. This he put in the form\r\nof a simple request from Owen to Manston, that Manston would come to\r\nthe Southampton platform, and wait for Owen\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, as he valued his\r\nreputation. The message was directed as the rector had suggested, Edward\r\nguaranteeing to the clerk who sent it off that every expense connected\r\nwith the search would be paid.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the telegram been despatched than his heart sank within\r\nhim at the want of foresight shown in sending it. Had Manston, all the\r\ntime, a knowledge that his first wife lived, the telegram would be a\r\nforewarning which might enable him to defeat Owen still more signally.\r\n\r\nWhilst the machine was still giving off its multitudinous series of\r\nraps, Edward heard a powerful rush under the shed outside, followed by\r\na long sonorous creak. It was a train of some sort, stealing softly into\r\nthe station, and it was an up-train. There was the ring of a bell. It\r\nwas certainly a passenger train.\r\n\r\nYet the booking-office window was closed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ho, ho, John, seventeen minutes after time and only three stations up\r\nthe line. The incline again?\xe2\x80\x99 The voice was the stationmaster\xe2\x80\x99s, and the\r\nreply seemed to come from the guard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, the other side of the cutting. The thaw has made it all in a\r\nperfect cloud of fog, and the rails are as slippery as glass. We had to\r\nbring them through the cutting at twice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anybody else for the four-forty-five express?\xe2\x80\x99 the voice continued. The\r\nfew passengers, having crossed over to the other side long before this\r\ntime, had taken their places at once.\r\n\r\nA conviction suddenly broke in upon Edward\xe2\x80\x99s mind; then a wish\r\noverwhelmed him. The conviction--as startling as it was sudden--was that\r\nManston was a villain, who at some earlier time had discovered that\r\nhis wife lived, and had bribed her to keep out of sight, that he might\r\npossess Cytherea. The wish was--to proceed at once by this very train\r\nthat was starting, find Manston before he would expect from the words\r\nof the telegram (if he got it) that anybody from Carriford could be\r\nwith him--charge him boldly with the crime, and trust to his consequent\r\nconfusion (if he were guilty) for a solution of the extraordinary\r\nriddle, and the release of Cytherea!\r\n\r\nThe ticket-office had been locked up at the expiration of the time at\r\nwhich the train was due. Rushing out as the guard blew his whistle,\r\nEdward opened the door of a carriage and leapt in. The train moved\r\nalong, and he was soon out of sight.\r\n\r\nSpringrove had long since passed that peculiar line which lies across\r\nthe course of falling in love--if, indeed, it may not be called the\r\ninitial itself of the complete passion--a longing to cherish; when the\r\nwoman is shifted in a man\xe2\x80\x99s mind from the region of mere admiration to\r\nthe region of warm fellowship. At this assumption of her nature, she\r\nchanges to him in tone, hue, and expression. All about the loved one\r\nthat said \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99 before, says \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99 now. Eyes that were to be subdued\r\nbecome eyes to be feared for: a brain that was to be probed by cynicism\r\nbecomes a brain that is to be tenderly assisted; feet that were to\r\nbe tested in the dance become feet that are not to be distressed; the\r\nonce-criticized accent, manner, and dress, become the clients of a\r\nspecial pleader.\r\n\r\n6. FIVE TO EIGHT O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK P.M.\r\n\r\nNow that he was fairly on the track, and had begun to cool down, Edward\r\nremembered that he had nothing to show--no legal authority whatever to\r\nquestion Manston or interfere between him and Cytherea as husband\r\nand wife. He now saw the wisdom of the rector in obtaining a signed\r\nconfession from the porter. The document would not be a death-bed\r\nconfession--perhaps not worth anything legally--but it would be held by\r\nOwen; and he alone, as Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s natural guardian, could separate them\r\non the mere ground of an unproved probability, or what might perhaps be\r\ncalled the hallucination of an idiot. Edward himself, however, was as\r\nfirmly convinced as the rector had been of the truth of the man\xe2\x80\x99s story,\r\nand paced backward and forward the solitary compartment as the train\r\nwound through the dark heathery plains, the mazy woods, and moaning\r\ncoppices, as resolved as ever to pounce on Manston, and charge him with\r\nthe crime during the critical interval between the reception of the\r\ntelegram and the hour at which Owen\xe2\x80\x99s train would arrive--trusting to\r\ncircumstances for what he should say and do afterwards, but making up\r\nhis mind to be a ready second to Owen in any emergency that might arise.\r\n\r\nAt thirty-three minutes past seven he stood on the platform of the\r\nstation at Southampton--a clear hour before the train containing Owen\r\ncould possibly arrive.\r\n\r\nMaking a few inquiries here, but too impatient to pursue his\r\ninvestigation carefully and inductively, he went into the town.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of another half-hour he had visited seven hotels and\r\ninns, large and small, asking the same questions at each, and always\r\nreceiving the same reply--nobody of that name, or answering to that\r\ndescription, had been there. A boy from the telegraph-office had called,\r\nasking for the same persons, if they recollected rightly.\r\n\r\nHe reflected awhile, struck again by a painful thought that they might\r\npossibly have decided to cross the Channel by the night-boat. Then he\r\nhastened off to another quarter of the town to pursue his inquiries\r\namong hotels of the more old-fashioned and quiet class. His stained and\r\nweary appearance obtained for him but a modicum of civility, wherever he\r\nwent, which made his task yet more difficult. He called at three several\r\nhouses in this neighbourhood, with the same result as before. He entered\r\nthe door of the fourth house whilst the clock of the nearest church was\r\nstriking eight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have a tall gentleman named Manston, and a young wife arrived here this\r\nevening?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked again, in words which had grown odd to his ears from\r\nvery familiarity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A new-married couple, did you say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are, though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They have taken a sitting-room and bedroom, number thirteen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are they indoors?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Eliza!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, m\xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98See if number thirteen is in--that gentleman and his wife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, m\xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has any telegram come for them?\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward, when the maid had gone on\r\nher errand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--nothing that I know of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Somebody did come and ask if a Mr. and Mrs. Masters, or some such\r\nname, were here this evening,\xe2\x80\x99 said another voice from the back of the\r\nbar-parlour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And did they get the message?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course they did not--they were not here--they didn\xe2\x80\x99t come till\r\nhalf-an-hour after that. The man who made inquiries left no message. I\r\ntold them when they came that they, or a name something like theirs, had\r\nbeen asked for, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to understand why it should be, and\r\nso the matter dropped.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe chambermaid came back. \xe2\x80\x98The gentleman is not in, but the lady is.\r\nWho shall I say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nobody,\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward. For it now became necessary to reflect upon his\r\nmethod of proceeding. His object in finding their whereabouts--apart\r\nfrom the wish to assist Owen--had been to see Manston, ask him flatly\r\nfor an explanation, and confirm the request of the message in the\r\npresence of Cytherea--so as to prevent the possibility of the steward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npalming off a story upon Cytherea, or eluding her brother when he came.\r\nBut here were two important modifications of the expected condition of\r\naffairs. The telegram had not been received, and Cytherea was in the\r\nhouse alone.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated as to the propriety of intruding upon her in Manston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsence. Besides, the women at the bottom of the stairs would see\r\nhim--his intrusion would seem odd--and Manston might return at\r\nany moment. He certainly might call, and wait for Manston with the\r\naccusation upon his tongue, as he had intended. But it was a doubtful\r\ncourse. That idea had been based upon the assumption that Cytherea was\r\nnot married. If the first wife were really dead after all--and he\r\nfelt sick at the thought--Cytherea as the steward\xe2\x80\x99s wife might in\r\nafter-years--perhaps, at once--be subjected to indignity and cruelty on\r\naccount of an old lover\xe2\x80\x99s interference now.\r\n\r\nYes, perhaps the announcement would come most properly and safely for\r\nher from her brother Owen, the time of whose arrival had almost expired.\r\n\r\nBut, on turning round, he saw that the staircase and passage were quite\r\ndeserted. He and his errand had as completely died from the minds of\r\nthe attendants as if they had never been. There was absolutely nothing\r\nbetween him and Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s presence. Reason was powerless now; he must\r\nsee her--right or wrong, fair or unfair to Manston--offensive to her\r\nbrother or no. His lips must be the first to tell the alarming story to\r\nher. Who loved her as he! He went back lightly through the hall, up the\r\nstairs, two at a time, and followed the corridor till he came to the\r\ndoor numbered thirteen.\r\n\r\nHe knocked softly: nobody answered.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to lose if he would speak to Cytherea before Manston\r\ncame. He turned the handle of the door and looked in. The lamp on the\r\ntable burned low, and showed writing materials open beside it; the chief\r\nlight came from the fire, the direct rays of which were obscured by a\r\nsweet familiar outline of head and shoulders--still as precious to him\r\nas ever.\r\n\r\n7. A QUARTER-PAST EIGHT O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK P.M.\r\n\r\nThere is an attitude--approximatively called pensive--in which the soul\r\nof a human being, and especially of a woman, dominates outwardly and\r\nexpresses its presence so strongly, that the intangible essence seems\r\nmore apparent than the body itself. This was Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s expression now.\r\nWhat old days and sunny eves at Budmouth Bay was she picturing? Her\r\nreverie had caused her not to notice his knock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cytherea!\xe2\x80\x99 he said softly.\r\n\r\nShe let drop her hand, and turned her head, evidently thinking that her\r\nvisitor could be no other than Manston, yet puzzled at the voice.\r\n\r\nThere was no preface on Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s tongue; he forgot his\r\nposition--hers--that he had come to ask quietly if Manston had other\r\nproofs of being a widower--everything--and jumped to a conclusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are not his wife, Cytherea--come away, he has a wife living!\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ncried in an agitated whisper. \xe2\x80\x98Owen will be here directly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe started up, recognized the tidings first, the bearer of them\r\nafterwards. \xe2\x80\x98Not his wife? O, what is it--what--who is living?\xe2\x80\x99 She\r\nawoke by degrees. \xe2\x80\x98What must I do? Edward, it is you! Why did you come?\r\nWhere is Owen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What has Manston shown you in proof of the death of his other wife?\r\nTell me quick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing--we have never spoken of the subject. Where is my brother Owen?\r\nI want him, I want him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is coming by-and-by. Come to the station to meet him--do,\xe2\x80\x99 implored\r\nSpringrove. \xe2\x80\x98If Mr. Manston comes, he will keep you from me: I am\r\nnobody,\xe2\x80\x99 he added bitterly, feeling the reproach her words had faintly\r\nshadowed forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Manston is only gone out to post a letter he has just written,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid, and without being distinctly cognizant of the action, she wildly\r\nlooked for her bonnet and cloak, and began putting them on, but in the\r\nact of fastening them uttered a spasmodic cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I\xe2\x80\x99ll not go out with you,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, flinging the articles\r\ndown again. Running to the door she flitted along the passage, and\r\ndownstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give me a private room--quite private,\xe2\x80\x99 she said breathlessly to some\r\none below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Number twelve is a single room, madam, and unoccupied,\xe2\x80\x99 said some\r\ntongue in astonishment.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for any person to show her into it, Cytherea hurried\r\nupstairs again, brushed through the corridor, entered the room\r\nspecified, and closed the door. Edward heard her sob out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nobody but Owen shall speak to me--nobody!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He will be here directly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Springrove, close against the panel,\r\nand then went towards the stairs. He had seen her; it was enough.\r\n\r\nHe descended, stepped into the street, and hastened to meet Owen at the\r\nrailway-station.\r\n\r\nAs for the poor maiden who had received the news, she knew not what to\r\nthink. She listened till the echo of Edward\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps had died away,\r\nthen bowed her face upon the bed. Her sudden impulse had been to escape\r\nfrom sight. Her weariness after the unwonted strain, mental and bodily,\r\nwhich had been put upon her by the scenes she had passed through during\r\nthe long day, rendered her much more timid and shaken by her position\r\nthan she would naturally have been. She thought and thought of that\r\nsingle fact which had been told her--that the first Mrs. Manston was\r\nstill living--till her brain seemed ready to burst its confinement with\r\nexcess of throbbing. It was only natural that she should, by degrees,\r\nbe unable to separate the discovery, which was matter of fact, from the\r\nsuspicion of treachery on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s part, which was only matter of\r\ninference. And thus there arose in her a personal fear of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suppose he should come in now and seize me!\xe2\x80\x99 This at first mere\r\nfrenzied supposition grew by degrees to a definite horror of his\r\npresence, and especially of his intense gaze. Thus she raised herself to\r\na heat of excitement, which was none the less real for being vented\r\nin no cry of any kind. No; she could not meet Manston\xe2\x80\x99s eye alone, she\r\nwould only see him in her brother\xe2\x80\x99s company.\r\n\r\nAlmost delirious with this idea, she ran and locked the door to prevent\r\nall possibility of her intentions being nullified, or a look or word\r\nbeing flung at her by anybody whilst she knew not what she was.\r\n\r\n8. HALF-PAST EIGHT O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK P.M.\r\n\r\nThen Cytherea felt her way amid the darkness of the room till she came\r\nto the head of the bed, where she searched for the bell-rope and gave it\r\na pull. Her summons was speedily answered by the landlady herself,\r\nwhose curiosity to know the meaning of these strange proceedings knew no\r\nbounds. The landlady attempted to turn the handle of the door. Cytherea\r\nkept the door locked. \xe2\x80\x98Please tell Mr. Manston when he comes that I am\r\nill,\xe2\x80\x99 she said from the inside, \xe2\x80\x98and that I cannot see him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly I will, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 said the landlady. \xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t you have a fire?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor a light?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want one, thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe landlady withdrew, thinking her visitor half insane.\r\n\r\nManston came in about five minutes later, and went at once up to the\r\nsitting-room, fully expecting to find his wife there. He looked round,\r\nrang, and was told the words Cytherea had said, that she was too ill to\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is in number twelve room,\xe2\x80\x99 added the maid.\r\n\r\nManston was alarmed, and knocked at the door. \xe2\x80\x98Cytherea!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am unwell, I cannot see you,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you seriously ill, dearest? Surely not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, not seriously.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me come in; I will get a doctor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, he can\xe2\x80\x99t see me either.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She won\xe2\x80\x99t open the door, sir, not to nobody at all!\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nchambermaid, with wonder-waiting eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold your tongue, and be off!\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston with a snap.\r\n\r\nThe maid vanished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, Cytherea, this is foolish--indeed it is--not opening the door....\r\nI cannot comprehend what can be the matter with you. Nor can a doctor\r\neither, unless he sees you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer voice had trembled more and more at each answer she gave, but\r\nnothing could induce her to come out and confront him. Hating scenes,\r\nManston went back to the sitting-room, greatly irritated and perplexed.\r\n\r\nAnd there Cytherea from the adjoining room could hear him pacing up\r\nand down. She thought, \xe2\x80\x98Suppose he insists upon seeing me--he probably\r\nmay--and will burst open the door!\xe2\x80\x99 This notion increased, and she sank\r\ninto a corner in a half-somnolent state, but with ears alive to the\r\nslightest sound. Reason could not overthrow the delirious fancy that\r\noutside her door stood Manston and all the people in the hotel, waiting\r\nto laugh her to scorn.\r\n\r\n9. HALF-PAST EIGHT TO ELEVEN P.M.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Springrove was pacing up and down the arrival platform\r\nof the railway-station. Half-past eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock--the time at which\r\nOwen\xe2\x80\x99s train was due--had come, and passed, but no train appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When will the eight-thirty train be in?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked of a man who was\r\nsweeping the mud from the steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is not expected yet this hour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How is that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Christmas-time, you see, \xe2\x80\x98tis always so. People are running about to\r\nsee their friends. The trains have been like it ever since Christmas\r\nEve, and will be for another week yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEdward again went on walking and waiting under the draughty roof. He\r\nfound it utterly impossible to leave the spot. His mind was so\r\nintent upon the importance of meeting with Owen, and informing him of\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts, that he could not but fancy Owen might leave the\r\nstation unobserved if he turned his back, and become lost to him in the\r\nstreets of the town.\r\n\r\nThe hour expired. Ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck. \xe2\x80\x98When will the train be in?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nEdward to the telegraph clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In five-and-thirty minutes. She\xe2\x80\x99s now at L----. They have extra\r\npassengers, and the rails are bad to-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt last, at a quarter to eleven, the train came in.\r\n\r\nThe first to alight from it was Owen, looking pale and cold. He casually\r\nglanced round upon the nearly deserted platform, and was hurrying to the\r\noutlet, when his eyes fell upon Edward. At sight of his friend he was\r\nquite bewildered, and could not speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here I am, Mr. Graye,\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x98I have seen Cytherea,\r\nand she has been waiting for you these two or three hours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOwen took Edward\xe2\x80\x99s hand, pressed it, and looked at him in silence. Such\r\nwas the concentration of his mind, that not till many minutes after did\r\nhe think of inquiring how Springrove had contrived to be there before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n10. ELEVEN O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK P.M.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at the door of the hotel, it was arranged between\r\nSpringrove and Graye that the latter only should enter, Edward waiting\r\noutside. Owen had remembered continually what his friend had frequently\r\noverlooked, that there was yet a possibility of his sister being\r\nManston\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and the recollection taught him to avoid any rashness in\r\nhis proceedings which might lead to bitterness hereafter.\r\n\r\nEntering the room, he found Manston sitting in the chair which had been\r\noccupied by Cytherea on Edward\xe2\x80\x99s visit, three hours earlier. Before Owen\r\nhad spoken, Manston arose, and stepping past him closed the door. His\r\nface appeared harassed--much more troubled than the slight circumstance\r\nwhich had as yet come to his knowledge seemed to account for.\r\n\r\nManston could form no reason for Owen\xe2\x80\x99s presence, but intuitively linked\r\nit with Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s seclusion. \xe2\x80\x98Altogether this is most unseemly,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98whatever it may mean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is meant anything unfriendly by my coming here,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nOwen earnestly; \xe2\x80\x98but listen to this, and think if I could do otherwise\r\nthan come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe took from his pocket the confession of Chinney the porter, as hastily\r\nwritten out by the vicar, and read it aloud. The aspects of Manston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface whilst he listened to the opening words were strange, dark, and\r\nmysterious enough to have justified suspicions that no deceit could\r\nbe too complicated for the possessor of such impulses, had there not\r\noverridden them all, as the reading went on, a new and irrepressible\r\nexpression--one unmistakably honest. It was that of unqualified\r\namazement in the steward\xe2\x80\x99s mind at the news he heard. Owen looked up\r\nand saw it. The sight only confirmed him in the belief he had held\r\nthroughout, in antagonism to Edward\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions.\r\n\r\nThere could no longer be a shadow of doubt that if the first Mrs.\r\nManston lived, her husband was ignorant of the fact. What he could have\r\nfeared by his ghastly look at first, and now have ceased to fear, it was\r\nquite futile to conjecture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now I do not for a moment doubt your complete ignorance of the whole\r\nmatter; you cannot suppose for an instant that I do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen when he\r\nhad finished reading. \xe2\x80\x98But is it not best for both that Cytherea should\r\ncome back with me till the matter is cleared up? In fact, under the\r\ncircumstances, no other course is left open to me than to request it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhatever Manston\xe2\x80\x99s original feelings had been, all in him now gave way\r\nto irritation, and irritation to rage. He paced up and down the room\r\ntill he had mastered it; then said in ordinary tones--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, I know no more than you and others know--it was a gratuitous\r\nunpleasantness in you to say you did not doubt me. Why should you, or\r\nanybody, have doubted me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, where is my sister?\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Locked in the next room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis own answer reminded Manston that Cytherea must, by some inscrutable\r\nmeans, have had an inkling of the event.\r\n\r\nOwen had gone to the door of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cytherea, darling--\xe2\x80\x98tis Owen,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, outside the door. A rustling\r\nof clothes, soft footsteps, and a voice saying from the inside, \xe2\x80\x98Is it\r\nreally you, Owen,--is it really?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, will you take care of me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Always.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe unlocked the door, and retreated again. Manston came forward from\r\nthe other room with a candle in his hand, as Owen pushed open the door.\r\n\r\nHer frightened eyes were unnaturally large, and shone like stars in the\r\ndarkness of the background, as the light fell upon them. She leapt up to\r\nOwen in one bound, her small taper fingers extended like the leaves of a\r\nlupine. Then she clasped her cold and trembling hands round his neck and\r\nshivered.\r\n\r\nThe sight of her again kindled all Manston\xe2\x80\x99s passions into activity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She shall not go with you,\xe2\x80\x99 he said firmly, and stepping a pace or two\r\ncloser, \xe2\x80\x98unless you prove that she is not my wife; and you can\xe2\x80\x99t do it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is proof,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen, holding up the paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No proof at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston hotly. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis not a death-bed confession,\r\nand those are the only things of the kind held as good evidence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Send for a lawyer,\xe2\x80\x99 Owen returned, \xe2\x80\x98and let him tell us the proper\r\ncourse to adopt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind the law--let me go with Owen!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Cytherea, still holding\r\non to him. \xe2\x80\x98You will let me go with him, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 she said,\r\nturning appealingly to Manston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll have it all right and square,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston, with more quietness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no objection to your brother sending for a lawyer, if he wants\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was getting on for twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, but the proprietor of the hotel\r\nhad not yet gone to bed on account of the mystery on the first floor,\r\nwhich was an occurrence unusual in the quiet family lodging. Owen looked\r\nover the banisters, and saw him standing in the hall. It struck Graye\r\nthat the wisest course would be to take the landlord to a certain extent\r\ninto their confidence, appeal to his honour as a gentleman, and so on,\r\nin order to acquire the information he wanted, and also to prevent the\r\nepisode of the evening from becoming a public piece of news. He called\r\nthe landlord up to where they stood, and told him the main facts of the\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nThe landlord was fortunately a quiet, prejudiced man, and a meditative\r\nsmoker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know the very man you want to see--the very man,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, looking\r\nat the general features of the candle-flame. \xe2\x80\x98Sharp as a needle, and not\r\nover-rich. Timms will put you all straight in no time--trust Timms for\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s in bed by this time for certain,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind that--Timms knows me, I know him. He\xe2\x80\x99ll oblige me as a\r\npersonal favour. Wait here a bit. Perhaps, too, he\xe2\x80\x99s up at some party or\r\nanother--he\xe2\x80\x99s a nice, jovial fellow, sharp as a needle, too; mind you,\r\nsharp as a needle, too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe went downstairs, put on his overcoat, and left the house, the three\r\npersons most concerned entering the room, and standing motionless,\r\nawkward, and silent in the midst of it. Cytherea pictured to herself the\r\nlong weary minutes she would have to stand there, whilst a sleepy man\r\ncould be prepared for consultation, till the constraint between them\r\nseemed unendurable to her--she could never last out the time. Owen was\r\nannoyed that Manston had not quietly arranged with him at once; Manston\r\nat Owen\xe2\x80\x99s homeliness of idea in proposing to send for an attorney, as if\r\nhe would be a touchstone of infallible proof.\r\n\r\nReflection was cut short by the approach of footsteps, and in a few\r\nmoments the proprietor of the hotel entered, introducing his friend.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Timms has not been in bed,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98he had just returned from\r\ndining with a few friends, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no trouble given. To save time I\r\nexplained the matter as we came along.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt occurred to Owen and Manston both that they might get a misty\r\nexposition of the law from Mr. Timms at that moment of concluding dinner\r\nwith a few friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As far as I can see,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lawyer, yawning, and turning his vision\r\ninward by main force, \xe2\x80\x98it is quite a matter for private arrangement\r\nbetween the parties, whoever the parties are--at least at present. I\r\nspeak more as a father than as a lawyer, it is true, but, let the young\r\nlady stay with her father, or guardian, safe out of shame\xe2\x80\x99s way, until\r\nthe mystery is sifted, whatever the mystery is. Should the evidence\r\nprove to be false, or trumped up by anybody to get her away from you,\r\nher husband, you may sue them for the damages accruing from the delay.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston, who had completely recovered his\r\nself-possession and common-sense; \xe2\x80\x98let it all be settled by herself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nTurning to Cytherea he whispered so softly that Owen did not hear the\r\nwords--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you wish to go back with your brother, dearest, and leave me here\r\nmiserable, and lonely, or will you stay with me, your own husband.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back with Owen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well.\xe2\x80\x99 He relinquished his coaxing tone, and went on sternly: \xe2\x80\x98And\r\nremember this, Cytherea, I am as innocent of deception in this thing as\r\nyou are yourself. Do you believe me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had no shadow of suspicion that my first wife lived. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nshe does even now. Do you believe me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe you,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now, good-evening,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, opening the door and politely\r\nintimating to the three men standing by that there was no further\r\nnecessity for their remaining in his room. \xe2\x80\x98In three days I shall claim\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe lawyer and the hotel-keeper retired first. Owen, gathering up as\r\nmuch of his sister\xe2\x80\x99s clothing as lay about the room, took her upon his\r\narm, and followed them. Edward, to whom she owed everything, who had\r\nbeen left standing in the street like a dog without a home, was utterly\r\nforgotten. Owen paid the landlord and the lawyer for the trouble he had\r\noccasioned them, looked to the packing, and went to the door.\r\n\r\nA fly, which somewhat unaccountably was seen lingering in front of the\r\nhouse, was called up, and Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s luggage put upon it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know of any hotel near the station that is open for night\r\narrivals?\xe2\x80\x99 Owen inquired of the driver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A place has been bespoke for you, sir, at the White Unicorn--and the\r\ngentleman wished me to give you this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bespoken by Springrove, who ordered the fly, of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen to\r\nhimself. By the light of the street-lamp he read these lines, hurriedly\r\ntraced in pencil:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have gone home by the mail-train. It is better for all parties that\r\nI should be out of the way. Tell Cytherea that I apologize for having\r\ncaused her such unnecessary pain, as it seems I did--but it cannot be\r\nhelped now. E.S.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOwen handed his sister into the vehicle, and told the flyman to drive\r\non.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor Springrove--I think we have served him rather badly,\xe2\x80\x99 he said to\r\nCytherea, repeating the words of the note to her.\r\n\r\nA thrill of pleasure passed through her bosom as she listened to them.\r\nThey were the genuine reproach of a lover to his mistress; the trifling\r\ncoldness of her answer to him would have been noticed by no man who\r\nwas only a friend. But, in entertaining that sweet thought, she had\r\nforgotten herself, and her position for the instant.\r\n\r\nWas she still Manston\xe2\x80\x99s wife--that was the terrible supposition, and\r\nher future seemed still a possible misery to her. For, on account of the\r\nlate jarring accident, a life with Manston which would otherwise have\r\nbeen only a sadness, must become a burden of unutterable sorrow.\r\n\r\nThen she thought of the misrepresentation and scandal that would\r\nensue if she were no wife. One cause for thankfulness accompanied the\r\nreflection; Edward knew the truth.\r\n\r\nThey soon reached the quiet old inn, which had been selected for them\r\nby the forethought of the man who loved her well. Here they installed\r\nthemselves for the night, arranging to go to Budmouth by the first train\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\nAt this hour Edward Springrove was fast approaching his native county on\r\nthe wheels of the night-mail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV. THE EVENTS OF FIVE WEEKS\r\n\r\n1. FROM THE SIXTH TO THE THIRTEENTH OF JANUARY\r\n\r\nManston had evidently resolved to do nothing in a hurry.\r\n\r\nThis much was plain, that his earnest desire and intention was to\r\nraise in Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s bosom no feelings of permanent aversion to him. The\r\ninstant after the first burst of disappointment had escaped him in the\r\nhotel at Southampton, he had seen how far better it would be to lose her\r\npresence for a week than her respect for ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She shall be mine; I will claim the young thing yet,\xe2\x80\x99 he insisted. And\r\nthen he seemed to reason over methods for compassing that object, which,\r\nto all those who were in any degree acquainted with the recent event,\r\nappeared the least likely of possible contingencies.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Knapwater late the next day, and was preparing to call on\r\nMiss Aldclyffe, when the conclusion forced itself upon him that nothing\r\nwould be gained by such a step. No; every action of his should be done\r\nopenly--even religiously. At least, he called on the rector, and stated\r\nthis to be his resolve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Raunham, \xe2\x80\x98it is best to proceed candidly and\r\nfairly, or undue suspicion may fall on you. You should, in my opinion,\r\ntake active steps at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will do the utmost that lies in my power to clear up the mystery, and\r\nsilence the hubbub of gossip that has been set going about me. But what\r\ncan I do? They say that the man who comes first in the chain of inquiry\r\nis not to be found--I mean the porter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry to say that he is not. When I returned from the station last\r\nnight, after seeing Owen Graye off, I went again to the cottage where\r\nhe has been lodging, to get more intelligence, as I thought. He was not\r\nthere. He had gone out at dusk, saying he would be back soon. But he has\r\nnot come back yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I rather doubt if we shall see him again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Had I known of this, I would have done what in my flurry I did not\r\nthink of doing--set a watch upon him. But why not advertise for\r\nyour missing wife as a preliminary, consulting your solicitor in the\r\nmeantime?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Advertise. I\xe2\x80\x99ll think about it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston, lingering on the word as\r\nhe pronounced it. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, that seems a right thing--quite a right thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe went home and remained moodily indoors all the next day and the\r\nnext--for nearly a week, in short. Then, one evening at dusk, he\r\nwent out with an uncertain air as to the direction of his walk, which\r\nresulted, however, in leading him again to the rectory.\r\n\r\nHe saw Mr. Raunham. \xe2\x80\x98Have you done anything yet?\xe2\x80\x99 the rector inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--I have not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston absently. \xe2\x80\x98But I am going to set about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99 He hesitated, as if ashamed of some weakness he was about to\r\nbetray. \xe2\x80\x98My object in calling was to ask if you had heard any tidings\r\nfrom Budmouth of my--Cytherea. You used to speak of her as one you were\r\ninterested in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was, at any rate, real sadness in Manston\xe2\x80\x99s tone now, and the\r\nrector paused to weigh his words ere he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not heard directly from her,\xe2\x80\x99 he said gently. \xe2\x80\x98But her brother\r\nhas communicated with some people in the parish--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Springroves, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston gloomily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; and they tell me that she is very ill, and I am sorry to say,\r\nlikely to be for some days.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely, surely, I must go and see her!\xe2\x80\x99 Manston cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would advise you not to go,\xe2\x80\x99 said Raunham. \xe2\x80\x98But do this instead--be\r\nas quick as you can in making a movement towards ascertaining the truth\r\nas regards the existence of your wife. You see, Mr. Manston, an out-step\r\nplace like this is not like a city, and there is nobody to busy himself\r\nfor the good of the community; whilst poor Cytherea and her brother are\r\nsocially too dependent to be able to make much stir in the matter, which\r\nis a greater reason still why you should be disinterestedly prompt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe steward murmured an assent. Still there was the same\r\nindecision!--not the indecision of weakness--the indecision of conscious\r\nperplexity.\r\n\r\nOn Manston\xe2\x80\x99s return from this interview at the rectory, he passed the\r\ndoor of the Rising Sun Inn. Finding he had no light for his cigar,\r\nand it being three-quarters of a mile to his residence in the park, he\r\nentered the tavern to get one. Nobody was in the outer portion of the\r\nfront room where Manston stood, but a space round the fire was screened\r\noff from the remainder, and inside the high oak settle, forming a part\r\nof the screen, he heard voices conversing. The speakers had not noticed\r\nhis footsteps, and continued their discourse.\r\n\r\nOne of the two he recognized as a well-known night-poacher, the man\r\nwho had met him with tidings of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s death on the evening of the\r\nconflagration. The other seemed to be a stranger following the same\r\nmode of life. The conversation was carried on in the emphatic and\r\nconfidential tone of men who are slightly intoxicated, its subject being\r\nan unaccountable experience that one of them had had on the night of the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nWhat the steward heard was enough, and more than enough, to lead him to\r\nforget or to renounce his motive in entering. The effect upon him was\r\nstrange and strong. His first object seemed to be to escape from the\r\nhouse again without being seen or heard.\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished this, he went in at the park gate, and strode off\r\nunder the trees to the Old House. There sitting down by the fire,\r\nand burying himself in reflection, he allowed the minutes to pass by\r\nunheeded. First the candle burnt down in its socket and stunk: he did\r\nnot notice it. Then the fire went out: he did not see it. His feet grew\r\ncold; still he thought on.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that a lady, a year and a quarter before this time,\r\nhad, under the same conditions--an unrestricted mental absorption--shown\r\nnearly the same peculiarities as this man evinced now. The lady was Miss\r\nAldclyffe.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past twelve when Manston moved, as if he had come to a\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he did the next morning was to call at Knapwater House;\r\nwhere he found that Miss Aldclyffe was not well enough to see him.\r\nShe had been ailing from slight internal haemorrhage ever since the\r\nconfession of the porter Chinney. Apparently not much aggrieved at the\r\ndenial, he shortly afterwards went to the railway-station and took his\r\ndeparture for London, leaving a letter for Miss Aldclyffe, stating the\r\nreason of his journey thither--to recover traces of his missing wife.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the week paragraphs appeared in the local and\r\nother newspapers, drawing attention to the facts of this singular case.\r\nThe writers, with scarcely an exception, dwelt forcibly upon a feature\r\nwhich had at first escaped the observation of the villagers, including\r\nMr. Raunham--that if the announcement of the man Chinney were true,\r\nit seemed extremely probable that Mrs. Manston left her watch and keys\r\nbehind on purpose to blind people as to her escape; and that therefore\r\nshe would not now let herself be discovered, unless a strong pressure\r\nwere put upon her. The writers added that the police were on the track\r\nof the porter, who very possibly had absconded in the fear that his\r\nreticence was criminal, and that Mr. Manston, the husband, was, with\r\npraiseworthy energy, making every effort to clear the whole matter up.\r\n\r\n2. FROM THE EIGHTEENTH TO THE END OF JANUARY\r\n\r\nFive days from the time of his departure, Manston returned from London\r\nand Liverpool, looking very fatigued and thoughtful. He explained to the\r\nrector and other of his acquaintance that all the inquiries he had\r\nmade at his wife\xe2\x80\x99s old lodgings and his own had been totally barren of\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nBut he seemed inclined to push the affair to a clear conclusion now that\r\nhe had commenced. After the lapse of another day or two he proceeded to\r\nfulfil his promise to the rector, and advertised for the missing\r\nwoman in three of the London papers. The advertisement was a carefully\r\nconsidered and even attractive effusion, calculated to win the heart,\r\nor at least the understanding, of any woman who had a spark of her own\r\nnature left in her.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.\r\n\r\nThree days later he repeated the experiment; with the same result as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot try any further,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston speciously to the rector, his\r\nsole auditor throughout the proceedings. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Raunham, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the\r\ntruth plainly: I don\xe2\x80\x99t love her; I do love Cytherea, and the whole of\r\nthis business of searching for the other woman goes altogether against\r\nme. I hope to God I shall never see her again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you will do your duty at least?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Raunham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have done it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston. \xe2\x80\x98If ever a man on the face of this earth\r\nhas done his duty towards an absent wife, I have towards her--living or\r\ndead--at least,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, correcting himself, \xe2\x80\x98since I have lived at\r\nKnapwater. I neglected her before that time--I own that, as I have owned\r\nit before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should, if I were you, adopt other means to get tidings of her\r\nif advertising fails, in spite of my feelings,\xe2\x80\x99 said the rector\r\nemphatically. \xe2\x80\x98But at any rate, try advertising once more. There\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsatisfaction in having made any attempt three several times.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen Manston had left the study, the rector stood looking at the fire\r\nfor a considerable length of time, lost in profound reflection. He went\r\nto his private diary, and after many pauses, which he varied only by\r\ndipping his pen, letting it dry, wiping it on his sleeve, and then\r\ndipping it again, he took the following note of events:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98January 25.--Mr. Manston has just seen me for the third time on the\r\nsubject of his lost wife. There have been these peculiarities attending\r\nthe three interviews:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The first. My visitor, whilst expressing by words his great anxiety to\r\ndo everything for her recovery, showed plainly by his bearing that he\r\nwas convinced he should never see her again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The second. He had left off feigning anxiety to do rightly by his first\r\nwife, and honestly asked after Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s welfare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The third (and most remarkable). He seemed to have lost all\r\nconsistency. Whilst expressing his love for Cytherea (which certainly is\r\nstrong) and evincing the usual indifference to the first Mrs. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfate, he was unable to conceal the intensity of his eagerness for me to\r\nadvise him to _advertise again_ for her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nA week after the second, the third advertisement was inserted. A\r\nparagraph was attached, which stated that this would be the last time\r\nthe announcement would appear.\r\n\r\n3. THE FIRST OF FEBRUARY\r\n\r\nAt this, the eleventh hour, the postman brought a letter for Manston,\r\ndirected in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nA bachelor friend of the steward\xe2\x80\x99s, Mr. Dickson by name, who was\r\nsomewhat of a chatterer--plenus rimarum--and who boasted of an endless\r\nstring of acquaintances, had come over from Casterbridge the preceding\r\nday by invitation--an invitation which had been a pleasant surprise\r\nto Dickson himself, insomuch that Manston, as a rule, voted him a bore\r\nalmost to his face. He had stayed over the night, and was sitting at\r\nbreakfast with his host when the important missive arrived.\r\n\r\nManston did not attempt to conceal the subject of the letter, or the\r\nname of the writer. First glancing the pages through, he read aloud as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMY HUSBAND,--I implore your forgiveness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDuring the last thirteen months I have repeated to myself a hundred\r\ntimes that you should never discover what I voluntarily tell you now,\r\nnamely, that I am alive and in perfect health.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen all your advertisements. Nothing but your persistence\r\nhas won me round. Surely, I thought, he _must_ love me still. Why else\r\nshould he try to win back a woman who, faithful unto death as she will\r\nbe, can, in a social sense, aid him towards acquiring nothing?--rather\r\nthe reverse, indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou yourself state my own mind--that the only grounds upon which we\r\ncan meet and live together, with a reasonable hope of happiness, must\r\nbe a mutual consent to bury in oblivion all past differences. I heartily\r\nand willingly forget everything--and forgive everything. You will do the\r\nsame, as your actions show.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be plenty of opportunity for me to explain the few facts\r\nrelating to my escape on the night of the fire. I will only give the\r\nheads in this hurried note. I was grieved at your not coming to fetch\r\nme, more grieved at your absence from the station, most of all by your\r\nabsence from home. On my journey to the inn I writhed under a passionate\r\nsense of wrong done me. When I had been shown to my room I waited and\r\nhoped for you till the landlord had gone upstairs to bed. I still found\r\nthat you did not come, and then I finally made up my mind to leave. I\r\nhad half undressed, but I put on my things again, forgetting my watch\r\n(and I suppose dropping my keys, though I am not sure where) in my\r\nhurry, and slipped out of the house. The--\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a rum story,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Dickson, interrupting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s a rum story?\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston hastily, and flushing in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Forgetting her watch and dropping her keys in her hurry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything particularly wonderful in it. Any woman might do\r\nsuch a thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Any woman might if escaping from fire or shipwreck, or any such\r\nimmediate danger. But it seems incomprehensible to me that any woman\r\nin her senses, who quietly decides to leave a house, should be so\r\nforgetful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All that is required to reconcile your seeming with her facts is to\r\nassume that she was not in her senses, for that\xe2\x80\x99s what she did plainly,\r\nor how could the things have been found there? Besides, she\xe2\x80\x99s truthful\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x99 He spoke eagerly and peremptorily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, I know that. I merely meant that it seemed rather odd.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes.\xe2\x80\x99 Manston read on:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d--and slipped out of the house. The rubbish-heap was burning up\r\nbrightly, but the thought that the house was in danger did not strike\r\nme; I did not consider that it might be thatched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI idled in the lane behind the wood till the last down-train had come\r\nin, not being in a mood to face strangers. Whilst I was there the\r\nfire broke out, and this perplexed me still more. However, I was still\r\ndetermined not to stay in the place. I went to the railway-station,\r\nwhich was now quiet, and inquired of the solitary man on duty there\r\nconcerning the trains. It was not till I had left the man that I saw the\r\neffect the fire might have on my history. I considered also, though not\r\nin any detailed manner, that the event, by attracting the attention of\r\nthe village to my former abode, might set people on my track should\r\nthey doubt my death, and a sudden dread of having to go back again\r\nto Knapwater--a place which had seemed inimical to me from first to\r\nlast--prompted me to run back and bribe the porter to secrecy. I then\r\nwalked on to Anglebury, lingering about the outskirts of the town till\r\nthe morning train came in, when I proceeded by it to London, and then\r\ntook these lodgings, where I have been supporting myself ever since by\r\nneedlework, endeavouring to save enough money to pay my passage home to\r\nAmerica, but making melancholy progress in my attempt. However, all that\r\nis changed--can I be otherwise than happy at it? Of course not. I am\r\nhappy. Tell me what I am to do, and believe me still to be your faithful\r\nwife, EUNICE.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMy name here is (as before)\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMRS. RONDLEY, and my address,\r\n          79 ADDINGTON STREET,\r\n               LAMBETH.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name and address were written on a separate slip of paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So it\xe2\x80\x99s to be all right at last then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston\xe2\x80\x99s friend. \xe2\x80\x98But\r\nafter all there\xe2\x80\x99s another woman in the case. You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem very\r\nsorry for the little thing who is put to such distress by this turn of\r\naffairs? I wonder you can let her go so coolly.\xe2\x80\x99 The speaker was looking\r\nout between the mullions of the window--noticing that some of the\r\nlights were glazed in lozenges, some in squares--as he said the words,\r\notherwise he would have seen the passionate expression of agonized\r\nhopelessness that flitted across the steward\xe2\x80\x99s countenance when the\r\nremark was made. He did not see it, and Manston answered after a short\r\ninterval. The way in which he spoke of the young girl who had believed\r\nherself his wife, whom, a few short days ago, he had openly idolized,\r\nand whom, in his secret heart, he idolized still, as far as such a\r\nform of love was compatible with his nature, showed that from policy or\r\notherwise, he meant to act up to the requirements of the position into\r\nwhich fate appeared determined to drive him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s neither here nor there,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98it is a point of honour to do\r\nas I am doing, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Only I thought you used not to care overmuch about your first\r\nbargain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I certainly did not at one time. One is apt to feel rather weary of\r\nwives when they are so devilish civil under all aspects, as she used to\r\nbe. But anything for a change--Abigail is lost, but Michal is recovered.\r\nYou would hardly believe it, but she seems in fancy to be quite another\r\nbride--in fact, almost as if she had really risen from the dead, instead\r\nof having only done so virtually.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You let the young pink one know that the other has come or is coming?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cui bono?\xe2\x80\x99 The steward meditated critically, showing a portion of his\r\nintensely wide and regular teeth within the ruby lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot say anything to her that will do any good,\xe2\x80\x99 he resumed. \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nwould be awkward--either seeing or communicating with her again. The\r\nbest plan to adopt will be to let matters take their course--she\xe2\x80\x99ll find\r\nit all out soon enough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nManston found himself alone a few minutes later. He buried his face in\r\nhis hands, and murmured, \xe2\x80\x98O my lost one! O my Cytherea! That it should\r\ncome to this is hard for me! \xe2\x80\x98Tis now all darkness--\xe2\x80\x9ca land of darkness\r\nas darkness itself; and of the shadow of death without any order, and\r\nwhere the light is as darkness.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYes, the artificial bearing which this extraordinary man had adopted\r\nbefore strangers ever since he had overheard the conversation at the\r\ninn, left him now, and he mourned for Cytherea aloud.\r\n\r\n4. THE TWELFTH OF FEBRUARY\r\n\r\nKnapwater Park is the picture--at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock on a muddy, quiet,\r\nhazy, but bright morning--a morning without any blue sky, and without\r\nany shadows, the earth being enlivened and lit up rather by the spirit\r\nof an invisible sun than by its bodily presence.\r\n\r\nThe local Hunt had met for the day\xe2\x80\x99s sport on the open space of ground\r\nimmediately in front of the steward\xe2\x80\x99s residence--called in the list of\r\nappointments, \xe2\x80\x98Old House, Knapwater\xe2\x80\x99--the meet being here once every\r\nseason, for the pleasure of Miss Aldclyffe and her friends.\r\n\r\nLeaning out from one of the first-floor windows, and surveying with\r\nthe keenest interest the lively picture of pink and black coats,\r\nrich-coloured horses, and sparkling bits and spurs, was the returned and\r\nlong-lost woman, Mrs. Manston.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of those forming the brilliant group were occasionally turned\r\ntowards her, showing plainly that her adventures were the subject of\r\nconversation equally with or more than the chances of the coming day.\r\nShe did not flush beneath their scrutiny; on the contrary, she seemed\r\nrather to enjoy it, her eyes being kindled with a light of contented\r\nexultation, subdued to square with the circumstances of her matronly\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nShe was, at the distance from which they surveyed her, an attractive\r\nwoman--comely as the tents of Kedar. But to a close observer it was\r\npalpable enough that God did not do all the picture. Appearing at least\r\nseven years older than Cytherea, she was probably her senior by double\r\nthe number, the artificial means employed to heighten the natural good\r\nappearance of her face being very cleverly applied. Her form was full\r\nand round, its voluptuous maturity standing out in strong contrast to\r\nthe memory of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s lissom girlishness.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be an almost universal rule that a woman who once has\r\ncourted, or who eventually will court, the society of men on terms\r\ndangerous to her honour cannot refrain from flinging the meaning glance\r\nwhenever the moment arrives in which the glance is strongly asked\r\nfor, even if her life and whole future depended upon that moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabstinence.\r\n\r\nHad a cautious, uxorious husband seen in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s countenance what\r\nmight now have been seen in this dark-eyed woman\xe2\x80\x99s as she caught a\r\nstray glance of flirtation from one or other of the red-coated gallants\r\noutside, he would have passed many days in an agony of restless jealousy\r\nand doubt. But Manston was not such a husband, and he was, moreover,\r\ncalmly attending to his business at the other end of the manor.\r\n\r\nThe steward had fetched home his wife in the most matter-of-fact way\r\na few days earlier, walking round the village with her the very next\r\nmorning--at once putting an end, by this simple solution, to all the\r\nriddling inquiries and surmises that were rank in the village and its\r\nneighbourhood. Some men said that this woman was as far inferior to\r\nCytherea as earth to heaven; others, older and sager, thought Manston\r\nbetter off with such a wife than he would have been with one of\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s youthful impulses, and inexperience in household management.\r\nAll felt their curiosity dying out of them. It was the same in Carriford\r\nas in other parts of the world--immediately circumstantial evidence\r\nbecame exchanged for direct, the loungers in court yawned, gave a final\r\nsurvey, and turned away to a subject which would afford more scope for\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. THE EVENTS OF THREE WEEKS\r\n\r\n1. FROM THE TWELFTH OF FEBRUARY TO THE SECOND OF MARCH\r\n\r\nOwen Graye\xe2\x80\x99s recovery from the illness that had incapacitated him for so\r\nlong a time was, professionally, the dawn of a brighter prospect for him\r\nin every direction, though the change was at first very gradual, and\r\nhis movements and efforts were little more than mechanical. With the\r\nlengthening of the days, and the revival of building operations for the\r\nforthcoming season, he saw himself, for the first time, on a road which,\r\npursued with care, would probably lead to a comfortable income at some\r\nfuture day. But he was still very low down the hill as yet.\r\n\r\nThe first undertaking entrusted to him in the new year began about a\r\nmonth after his return from Southampton. Mr. Gradfield had come back\r\nto him in the wake of his restored health, and offered him the\r\nsuperintendence, as clerk of works, of a church which was to be nearly\r\nrebuilt at the village of Tolchurch, fifteen or sixteen miles from\r\nBudmouth, and about half that distance from Carriford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am now being paid at the rate of a hundred and fifty pounds a year,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said to his sister in a burst of thankfulness, \xe2\x80\x98and you shall never,\r\nCytherea, be at any tyrannous lady\xe2\x80\x99s beck and call again as long as\r\nI live. Never pine or think about what has happened, dear; it\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\ndisgrace to you. Cheer up; you\xe2\x80\x99ll be somebody\xe2\x80\x99s happy wife yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe did not say Edward Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s, for, greatly to his disappointment,\r\na report had reached his ears that the friend to whom Cytherea owed\r\nso much had been about to pack up his things and sail for Australia.\r\nHowever, this was before the uncertainty concerning Mrs. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexistence had been dispersed by her return, a phenomenon that altered\r\nthe cloudy relationship in which Cytherea had lately been standing\r\ntowards her old lover, to one of distinctness; which result would have\r\nbeen delightful but for circumstances about to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nCytherea was still pale from her recent illness, and still greatly\r\ndejected. Until the news of Mrs. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s return had reached them, she\r\nhad kept herself closely shut up during the day-time, never venturing\r\nforth except at night. Sleeping and waking she had been in perpetual\r\ndread lest she should still be claimed by a man whom, only a few weeks\r\nearlier, she had regarded in the light of a future husband with quiet\r\nassent, not unmixed with cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nBut the removal of the uneasiness in this direction--by Mrs. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrival, and her own consequent freedom--had been the imposition of pain\r\nin another. Utterly fictitious details of the finding of Cytherea and\r\nManston had been invented and circulated, unavoidably reaching her ears\r\nin the course of time. Thus the freedom brought no happiness, and it\r\nseemed well-nigh impossible that she could ever again show herself the\r\nsparkling creature she once had been--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98Apt to entice a deity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn this account, and for the first time in his life, Owen made a point\r\nof concealing from her the real state of his feelings with regard to the\r\nunhappy transaction. He writhed in secret under the humiliation to which\r\nthey had been subjected, till the resentment it gave rise to, and for\r\nwhich there was no vent, was sometimes beyond endurance; it induced a\r\nmood that did serious damage to the material and plodding perseverance\r\nnecessary if he would secure permanently the comforts of a home for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey gave up their lodgings at Budmouth, and went to Tolchurch as soon\r\nas the work commenced.\r\n\r\nHere they were domiciled in one half of an old farmhouse, standing not\r\nfar from the ivy-covered church tower (which was all that was to remain\r\nof the original structure). The long steep roof of this picturesque\r\ndwelling sloped nearly down to the ground, the old tiles that covered\r\nit being overgrown with rich olive-hued moss. New red tiles in twos and\r\nthrees had been used for patching the holes wrought by decay, lighting\r\nup the whole harmonious surface with dots of brilliant scarlet.\r\n\r\nThe chief internal features of this snug abode were a wide fireplace,\r\nenormous cupboards, a brown settle, and several sketches on the wood\r\nmantel, done in outline with the point of a hot poker--the subjects\r\nmainly consisting of old men walking painfully erect, with a\r\ncurly-tailed dog behind.\r\n\r\nAfter a week or two of residence in Tolchurch, and rambles amid the\r\nquaint scenery circumscribing it, a tranquillity began to spread itself\r\nthrough the mind of the maiden, which Graye hoped would be a preface to\r\nher complete restoration. She felt ready and willing to live the whole\r\nremainder of her days in the retirement of their present quarters: she\r\nbegan to sing about the house in low tremulous snatches--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9c--I said, if there\xe2\x80\x99s peace to be found in the world,\r\n       A heart that is humble may hope for it here.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n2. THE THIRD OF MARCH\r\n\r\nHer convalescence had arrived at this point on a certain evening towards\r\nthe end of the winter, when Owen had come in from the building hard by,\r\nand was changing his muddy boots for slippers, previously to sitting\r\ndown to toast and tea.\r\n\r\nA prolonged though quiet knocking came to the door.\r\n\r\nThe only person who ever knocked at their door in that way was the new\r\nvicar, the prime mover in the church-building. But he was that evening\r\ndining with the Squire.\r\n\r\nCytherea was uneasy at the sound--she did not know why, unless it was\r\nbecause her nerves were weakened by the sickness she had undergone.\r\nInstead of opening the door she ran out of the room, and upstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What nonsense, Cytherea!\xe2\x80\x99 said her brother, going to the door.\r\n\r\nEdward Springrove stood in the grey light outside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Capital--not gone to Australia, and not going, of course!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Owen.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of going to such a place as that?--I never believed that\r\nyou would.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am going back to London again to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Springrove, \xe2\x80\x98and I\r\ncalled to say a word before going. Where is... ?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She has just run upstairs. Come in--never mind scraping your shoes--we\r\nare regular cottagers now; stone floor, yawning chimney-corner, and all,\r\nyou see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Manston came,\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward awkwardly, when he had sat down in the\r\nchimney-corner by preference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99 At mention of one of his skeletons Owen lost his blitheness at\r\nonce, and fell into a reverie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The history of her escape is very simple.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know I always had wondered, when my father was telling any of the\r\ncircumstances of the fire to me, how it could be that a woman could\r\nsleep so soundly as to be unaware of her horrid position till it was too\r\nlate even to give shout or sound of any kind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I think that would have been possible, considering her long\r\nwearisome journey. People have often been suffocated in their beds\r\nbefore they awoke. But it was hardly likely a body would be completely\r\nburnt to ashes as this was assumed to be, though nobody seemed to see it\r\nat the time. And how positive the surgeon was too, about those bits of\r\nbone! Why he should have been so, nobody can tell. I cannot help saying\r\nthat if it has ever been possible to find pure stupidity incarnate, it\r\nwas in that jury of Carriford. There existed in the mass the stupidity\r\nof twelve and not the penetration of one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is she quite well?\xe2\x80\x99 said Springrove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who?--O, my sister, Cytherea. Thank you, nearly well, now. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wait one minute. I have a word to say to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOwen sat down again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know, without my saying it, that I love Cytherea as dearly as\r\never.... I think she loves me too,--does she really?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was in Owen enough of that worldly policy on the subject of\r\nmatchmaking which naturally resides in the breasts of parents and\r\nguardians, to give him a certain caution in replying, and, younger as he\r\nwas by five years than Edward, it had an odd effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, she may possibly love you still,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, as if rather in doubt\r\nas to the truth of his words.\r\n\r\nSpringrove\xe2\x80\x99s countenance instantly saddened; he had expected a simple\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 at the very least. He continued in a tone of greater depression--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Supposing she does love me, would it be fair to you and to her if\r\nI made her an offer of marriage, with these dreary conditions\r\nattached--that we lived for a few years on the narrowest system, till\r\na great debt, which all honour and duty require me to pay off, shall be\r\npaid? My father, by reason of the misfortune that befell him, is under\r\na great obligation to Miss Aldclyffe. He is getting old, and losing\r\nhis energies. I am attempting to work free of the burden. This makes my\r\nprospects gloomy enough at present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But consider again,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on. \xe2\x80\x98Cytherea has been left in a nameless\r\nand unsatisfactory, though innocent state, by this unfortunate, and\r\nnow void, marriage with Manston. A marriage with me, though under\r\nthe--materially--untoward conditions I have mentioned, would make us\r\nhappy; it would give her a locus standi. If she wished to be out of\r\nthe sound of her misfortunes we would go to another part of\r\nEngland--emigrate--do anything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll call Cytherea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen. \xe2\x80\x98It is a matter which she alone can\r\nsettle.\xe2\x80\x99 He did not speak warmly. His pride could not endure the pity\r\nwhich Edward\xe2\x80\x99s visit and errand tacitly implied. Yet, in the other\r\naffair, his heart went with Edward; he was on the same beat for paying\r\noff old debts himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cythie, Mr. Springrove is here,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, at the foot of the staircase.\r\n\r\nHis sister descended the creaking old steps with a faltering tread,\r\nand stood in the firelight from the hearth. She extended her hand\r\nto Springrove, welcoming him by a mere motion of the lip, her eyes\r\naverted--a habit which had engendered itself in her since the\r\nbeginning of her illness and defamation. Owen opened the door and went\r\nout--leaving the lovers alone. It was the first time they had met since\r\nthe memorable night at Southampton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will get a light,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, with a little embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--don\xe2\x80\x99t, please, Cytherea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward softly, \xe2\x80\x98Come and sit down\r\nwith me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes. I ought to have asked _you_ to,\xe2\x80\x99 she returned timidly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everybody sits in the chimney-corner in this parish. You sit on that\r\nside. I\xe2\x80\x99ll sit here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTwo recesses--one on the right, one on the left hand--were cut in the\r\ninside of the fireplace, and here they sat down facing each other, on\r\nbenches fitted to the recesses, the fire glowing on the hearth between\r\ntheir feet. Its ruddy light shone on the underslopes of their faces, and\r\nspread out over the floor of the room with the low horizontality of the\r\nsetting sun, giving to every grain of sand and tumour in the paving a\r\nlong shadow towards the door.\r\n\r\nEdward looked at his pale love through the thin azure twines of smoke\r\nthat went up like ringlets between them, and invested her, as seen\r\nthrough its medium, with the shadowy appearance of a phantom. Nothing\r\nis so potent for coaxing back the lost eyes of a woman as a discreet\r\nsilence in the man who has so lost them--and thus the patient Edward\r\ncoaxed hers. After lingering on the hearth for half a minute, waiting in\r\nvain for another word from him, they were lifted into his face.\r\n\r\nHe was ready primed to receive them. \xe2\x80\x98Cytherea, will you marry me?\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHe could not wait in his original position till the answer came.\r\nStepping across the front of the fire to her own side of the chimney\r\ncorner, he reclined at her feet, and searched for her hand. She\r\ncontinued in silence awhile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Edward, I can never be anybody\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\xe2\x80\x99 she then said sadly, and with\r\nfirmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Think of it in every light,\xe2\x80\x99 he pleaded; \xe2\x80\x98the light of love, first.\r\nThen, when you have done that, see how wise a step it would be. I can\r\nonly offer you poverty as yet, but I want--I do so long to secure you\r\nfrom the intrusion of that unpleasant past, which will often and always\r\nbe thrust before you as long as you live the shrinking solitary life you\r\ndo now--a life which purity chooses, it may be; but to the outside\r\nworld it appears like the enforced loneliness of neglect and scorn--and\r\ntongues are busy inventing a reason for it which does not exist.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know all about it,\xe2\x80\x99 she said hastily; \xe2\x80\x98and those are the grounds of\r\nmy refusal. You and Owen know the whole truth--the two I love best on\r\nearth--and I am content. But the scandal will be continually\r\nrepeated, and I can never give any one the opportunity of saying to\r\nyou--that--your wife....\xe2\x80\x99 She utterly broke down and wept.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t, my own darling!\xe2\x80\x99 he entreated. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t, Cytherea!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Please to leave me--we will be friends, Edward--but don\xe2\x80\x99t press me--my\r\nmind is made up--I cannot--I will not marry you or any man under the\r\npresent ambiguous circumstances--never will I--I have said it: never!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey were both silent. He listlessly regarded the illuminated blackness\r\noverhead, where long flakes of soot floated from the sides and bars\r\nof the chimney-throat like tattered banners in ancient aisles; whilst\r\nthrough the square opening in the midst one or two bright stars looked\r\ndown upon them from the grey March sky. The sight seemed to cheer him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At any rate you will love me?\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--always--for ever and for ever!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe kissed her once, twice, three times, and arose to his feet, slowly\r\nwithdrawing himself from her side towards the door. Cytherea remained\r\nwith her gaze fixed on the fire. Edward went out grieving, but hope was\r\nnot extinguished even now.\r\n\r\nHe smelt the fragrance of a cigar, and immediately afterwards saw a\r\nsmall red star of fire against the darkness of the hedge. Graye was\r\npacing up and down the lane, smoking as he walked. Springrove told him\r\nthe result of the interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a good fellow, Edward,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98but I think my sister is\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you would believe Manston a villain, as I do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Springrove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be absurd of me to say that I like him now--family feeling\r\nprevents it, but I cannot in honesty say deliberately that he is a bad\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEdward could keep the secret of Manston\xe2\x80\x99s coercion of Miss Aldclyffe\r\nin the matter of the houses a secret no longer. He told Owen the whole\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s one thing,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, \xe2\x80\x98but not all. What do you think of\r\nthis--I have discovered that he went to Budmouth post-office for a\r\nletter the day before the first advertisement for his wife appeared in\r\nthe papers. One was there for him, and it was directed in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhandwriting, as I can prove. This was not till after the marriage with\r\nCytherea, it is true, but if (as it seems to show) the advertising was a\r\nfarce, there is a strong presumption that the rest of the piece was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOwen was too astounded to speak. He dropped his cigar, and fixed his\r\neyes upon his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Collusion!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With his first wife?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--with his wife. I am firmly persuaded of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you discover?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That he fetched from the post-office at Budmouth a letter from her the\r\nday _before_ the first advertisement appeared.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGraye was lost in a long consideration. \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98it would be\r\ndifficult to prove anything of that sort now. The writing could not be\r\nsworn to, and if he is guilty the letter is destroyed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have other suspicions--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--as you said\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Owen, who had not till now been able to\r\nform the complicated set of ideas necessary for picturing the position.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, there is this to be remembered--Cytherea had been taken from him\r\nbefore that letter came--and his knowledge of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s existence\r\ncould not have originated till after the wedding. I could have sworn he\r\nbelieved her dead then. His manner was unmistakable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I have other suspicions,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Edward; \xe2\x80\x98and if I only had\r\nthe right--if I were her husband or brother, he should be convicted of\r\nbigamy yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The reproof was not needed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen, with a little bitterness. \xe2\x80\x98What\r\ncan I do--a man with neither money nor friends--whilst Manston has Miss\r\nAldclyffe and all her fortune to back him up? God only knows what lies\r\nbetween the mistress and her steward, but since this has transpired--if\r\nit is true--I can believe the connection to be even an unworthy one--a\r\nthing I certainly never so much as owned to myself before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n3. THE FIFTH OF MARCH\r\n\r\nEdward\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure had the effect of directing Owen Graye\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts\r\ninto an entirely new and uncommon channel.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday after Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s visit, Owen had walked to the top of\r\na hill in the neighbourhood of Tolchurch--a wild hill that had no name,\r\nbeside a barren down where it never looked like summer. In the intensity\r\nof his meditations on the ever-present subject, he sat down on a\r\nweather-beaten boundary-stone gazing towards the distant valleys--seeing\r\nonly Manston\xe2\x80\x99s imagined form.\r\n\r\nHad his defenceless sister been trifled with? that was the question\r\nwhich affected him. Her refusal of Edward as a husband was, he knew,\r\ndictated solely by a humiliated sense of inadequacy to him in repute,\r\nand had not been formed till since the slanderous tale accounting\r\nfor her seclusion had been circulated. Was it not true, as Edward had\r\nhinted, that he, her brother, was neglecting his duty towards her in\r\nallowing Manston to thrive unquestioned, whilst she was hiding her head\r\nfor no fault at all?\r\n\r\nWas it possible that Manston was sensuous villain enough to have\r\ncontemplated, at any moment before the marriage with Cytherea, the\r\nreturn of his first wife, when he should have grown weary of his\r\nnew toy? Had he believed that, by a skilful manipulation of such\r\ncircumstances as chance would throw in his way, he could escape all\r\nsuspicion of having known that she lived? Only one fact within his own\r\ndirect knowledge afforded the least ground for such a supposition.\r\nIt was that, possessed by a woman only in the humble and unprotected\r\nstation of a lady\xe2\x80\x99s hired companion, his sister\xe2\x80\x99s beauty might scarcely\r\nhave been sufficient to induce a selfish man like Manston to make her\r\nhis wife, unless he had foreseen the possibility of getting rid of her\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But for that stratagem of Manston\xe2\x80\x99s in relation to the Springroves,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nOwen thought, \xe2\x80\x98Cythie might now have been the happy wife of Edward.\r\nTrue, that he influenced Miss Aldclyffe only rests on Edward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuspicions, but the grounds are good--the probability is strong.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe went indoors and questioned Cytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On the night of the fire, who first said that Mrs. Manston was burnt?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who started the report.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was it Manston?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was certainly not he. All doubt on the subject was removed before he\r\ncame to the spot--that I am certain of. Everybody knew that she did not\r\nescape _after_ the house was on fire, and thus all overlooked the fact\r\nthat she might have left before--of course that would have seemed such\r\nan improbable thing for anybody to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, until the porter\xe2\x80\x99s story of her irritation and doubt as to her\r\ncourse made it natural.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What settled the matter at the inquest,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, \xe2\x80\x98was Mr.\r\nManston\xe2\x80\x99s evidence that the watch was his wife\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was sure of that, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe he said he was certain of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It might have been hers--left behind in her perturbation, as they say\r\nit was--impossible as that seems at first sight. Yes--on the whole, he\r\nmight have believed in her death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know by several proofs that then, and at least for some time after,\r\nhe had no other thought than that she was dead. I now think that before\r\nthe porter\xe2\x80\x99s confession he knew something about her--though not that she\r\nlived.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why do you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From what he said to me on the evening of the wedding-day, when I had\r\nfastened myself in the room at the hotel, after Edward\xe2\x80\x99s visit. He must\r\nhave suspected that I knew something, for he was irritated, and in a\r\npassion of uneasy doubt. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose my first wife is\r\ncome to light again, madam, surely?\xe2\x80\x9d Directly he had let the remark slip\r\nout, he seemed anxious to withdraw it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s odd,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought it very odd.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Still we must remember he might only have hit upon the thought by\r\naccident, in doubt as to your motive. Yes, the great point to discover\r\nremains the same as ever--did he doubt his first impression of her death\r\n_before_ he married you. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking he did, although he was\r\nso astounded at our news that night. Edward swears he did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was perhaps only a short time before,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea; \xe2\x80\x98when he could\r\nhardly recede from having me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seasoning justice with mercy as usual, Cytherea. \xe2\x80\x98Tis unfair to\r\nyourself to talk like that. If I could only bring him to ruin as a\r\nbigamist--supposing him to be one--I should die happy. That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\r\nmust find out by fair means or foul--was he a wilful bigamist?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is no use trying, Owen. You would have to employ a solicitor, and\r\nhow can you do that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t at all--I know that very well. But neither do I altogether wish\r\nto at present--a lawyer must have a case--facts to go upon, that means.\r\nNow they are scarce at present--as scarce as money is with us, and till\r\nwe have found more money there is no hurry for a lawyer. Perhaps by the\r\ntime we have the facts we shall have the money. The only thing we lose\r\nin working alone in this way, is time--not the issue: for the fruit that\r\none mind matures in a twelvemonth forms a more perfectly organized whole\r\nthan that of twelve minds in one month, especially if the interests of\r\nthe single one are vitally concerned, and those of the twelve are only\r\nhired. But there is not only my mind available--you are a shrewd woman,\r\nCythie, and Edward is an earnest ally. Then, if we really get a sure\r\nfooting for a criminal prosecution, the Crown will take up the case.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t much care to press on in the matter,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured. \xe2\x80\x98What good\r\ncan it do us, Owen, after all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Selfishly speaking, it will do this good--that all the facts of your\r\njourney to Southampton will become known, and the scandal will die.\r\nBesides, Manston will have to suffer--it\xe2\x80\x99s an act of justice to you and\r\nto other women, and to Edward Springrove.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe now thought it necessary to tell her of the real nature of the\r\nSpringroves\xe2\x80\x99 obligation to Miss Aldclyffe--and their nearly certain\r\nknowledge that Manston was the prime mover in effecting their\r\nembarrassment. Her face flushed as she listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98our first undertaking is to find out where Mrs.\r\nManston lived during the separation; next, when the first communications\r\npassed between them after the fire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If we only had Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s countenance and assistance as I used to\r\nhave them,\xe2\x80\x99 Cytherea returned, \xe2\x80\x98how strong we should be! O, what power\r\nis it that he exercises over her, swaying her just as he wishes! She\r\nloves me now. Mrs. Morris in her letter said that Miss Aldclyffe prayed\r\nfor me--yes, she heard her praying for me, and crying. Miss Aldclyffe\r\ndid not mind an old friend like Mrs. Morris knowing it, either. Yet in\r\nopposition to this, notice her dead silence and inaction throughout this\r\nproceeding.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a mystery; but never mind that now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen impressively.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98About where Mrs. Manston has been living. We must get this part of\r\nit first--learn the place of her stay in the early stage of their\r\nseparation, during the period of Manston\xe2\x80\x99s arrival here, and so on, for\r\nthat was where she was first communicated with on the subject of coming\r\nto Knapwater, before the fire; and that address, too, was her point\r\nof departure when she came to her husband by stealth in the night--you\r\nknow--the time I visited you in the evening and went home early in the\r\nmorning, and it was found that he had been visited too. Ah! couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwe inquire of Mrs. Leat, who keeps the post-office at Carriford, if she\r\nremembers where the letters to Mrs. Manston were directed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He never posted his letters to her in the parish--it was remarked at\r\nthe time. I was thinking if something relating to her address might not\r\nbe found in the report of the inquest in the Casterbridge Chronicle of\r\nthe date. Some facts about the inquest were given in the papers to a\r\ncertainty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer brother caught eagerly at the suggestion. \xe2\x80\x98Who has a file of the\r\nChronicles?\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Raunham used to file them,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea. \xe2\x80\x98He was rather\r\nfriendly-disposed towards me, too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOwen could not, on any consideration, escape from his attendance at the\r\nchurch-building till Saturday evening; and thus it became necessary,\r\nunless they actually wasted time, that Cytherea herself should assist.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I act under your orders, Owen,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI. THE EVENTS OF ONE WEEK\r\n\r\n1. MARCH THE SIXTH\r\n\r\nThe next morning the opening move of the game was made. Cytherea, under\r\ncover of a thick veil, hired a conveyance and drove to within a mile or\r\nso of Carriford. It was with a renewed sense of depression that she\r\nsaw again the objects which had become familiar to her eye during her\r\nsojourn under Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s roof--the outline of the hills, the\r\nmeadow streams, the old park trees. She hastened by a lonely path to the\r\nrectory-house, and asked if Mr. Raunham was at home.\r\n\r\nNow the rector, though a solitary bachelor, was as gallant and courteous\r\nto womankind as an ancient Iberian; and, moreover, he was Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriend in particular, to an extent far greater than she had ever\r\nsurmised. Rarely visiting his relative, Miss Aldclyffe, except on parish\r\nmatters, more rarely still being called upon by Miss Aldclyffe, Cytherea\r\nhad learnt very little of him whilst she lived at Knapwater. The\r\nrelationship was on the impecunious paternal side, and for this branch\r\nof her family the lady of the estate had never evinced much sympathy. In\r\nlooking back upon our line of descent it is an instinct with us to feel\r\nthat all our vitality was drawn from the richer party to any unequal\r\nmarriage in the chain.\r\n\r\nSince the death of the old captain, the rector\xe2\x80\x99s bearing in Knapwater\r\nHouse had been almost that of a stranger, a circumstance which\r\nhe himself was the last man in the world to regret. This polite\r\nindifference was so frigid on both sides that the rector did not concern\r\nhimself to preach at her, which was a great deal in a rector; and she\r\ndid not take the trouble to think his sermons poor stuff, which in a\r\ncynical woman was a great deal more.\r\n\r\nThough barely fifty years of age, his hair was as white as snow,\r\ncontrasting strangely with the redness of his skin, which was as fresh\r\nand healthy as a lad\xe2\x80\x99s. Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s bright eyes, mutely and demurely\r\nglancing up at him Sunday after Sunday, had been the means of driving\r\naway many of the saturnine humours that creep into an empty heart during\r\nthe hours of a solitary life; in this case, however, to supplant them,\r\nwhen she left his parish, by those others of a more aching nature\r\nwhich accompany an over-full one. In short, he had been on the verge\r\nof feeling towards her that passion to which his dignified self-respect\r\nwould not give its true name, even in the privacy of his own thought.\r\n\r\nHe received her kindly; but she was not disposed to be frank with him.\r\nHe saw her wish to be reserved, and with genuine good taste and good\r\nnature made no comment whatever upon her request to be allowed to see\r\nthe Chronicle for the year before the last. He placed the papers before\r\nher on his study table, with a timidity as great as her own, and then\r\nleft her entirely to herself.\r\n\r\nShe turned them over till she came to the first heading connected\r\nwith the subject of her search--\xe2\x80\x98Disastrous Fire and Loss of Life at\r\nCarriford.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe sight, and its calamitous bearing upon her own life, made her so\r\ndizzy that she could, for a while, hardly decipher the letters. Stifling\r\nrecollection by an effort she nerved herself to her work, and carefully\r\nread the column. The account reminded her of no other fact than was\r\nremembered already.\r\n\r\nShe turned on to the following week\xe2\x80\x99s report of the inquest. After a\r\nmiserable perusal she could find no more pertaining to Mrs. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naddress than this:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ABRAHAM BROWN, of Hoxton, London, at whose house the deceased woman had\r\nbeen living, deposed,\xe2\x80\x99 etc.\r\n\r\nNobody else from London had attended the inquest. She arose to depart,\r\nfirst sending a message of thanks to Mr. Raunham, who was out of doors\r\ngardening.\r\n\r\nHe stuck his spade into the ground, and accompanied her to the gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can I help you in anything, Cytherea?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, using her Christian\r\nname by an intuition that unpleasant memories might be revived if he\r\ncalled her Miss Graye after wishing her good-bye as Mrs. Manston at\r\nthe wedding. Cytherea saw the motive and appreciated it, nevertheless\r\nreplying evasively--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I only guess and fear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe earnestly looked at her again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Promise me that if you want assistance, and you think I can give it,\r\nyou will come to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\nThe gate closed between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t want me to help you in anything now, Cytherea?\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated.\r\n\r\nIf he had spoken what he felt, \xe2\x80\x98I want very much to help you, Cytherea,\r\nand have been watching Manston on your account,\xe2\x80\x99 she would gladly have\r\naccepted his offer. As it was, she was perplexed, and raised her eyes to\r\nhis, not so fearlessly as before her trouble, but as modestly, and with\r\nstill enough brightness in them to do fearful execution as she said over\r\nthe gate--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe returned to Tolchurch weary with her day\xe2\x80\x99s work. Owen\xe2\x80\x99s greeting was\r\nanxious--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Cytherea?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe gave him the words from the report of the inquest, pencilled on a\r\nslip of paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now to find out the name of the street and number,\xe2\x80\x99 Owen remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Owen,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98will you forgive me for what I am going to say? I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think I can--indeed I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can--take any further steps\r\ntowards disentangling the mystery. I still think it a useless task, and\r\nit does not seem any duty of mine to be revenged upon Mr. Manston in any\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x99 She added more gravely, \xe2\x80\x98It is beneath my dignity as a woman to\r\nlabour for this; I have felt it so all day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, somewhat shortly; \xe2\x80\x98I shall work without you then.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s dignity in justice.\xe2\x80\x99 He caught sight of her pale tired face, and\r\nthe dilated eye which always appeared in her with weariness. \xe2\x80\x98Darling,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe continued warmly, and kissing her, \xe2\x80\x98you shall not work so hard\r\nagain--you are worn out quite. But you must let me do as I like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n2. MARCH THE TENTH\r\n\r\nOn Saturday evening Graye hurried off to Casterbridge, and called at the\r\nhouse of the reporter to the Chronicle. The reporter was at home, and\r\ncame out to Graye in the passage. Owen explained who and what he was,\r\nand asked the man if he would oblige him by turning to his notes of\r\nthe inquest at Carriford in the December of the year preceding the\r\nlast--just adding that a family entanglement, of which the reporter\r\nprobably knew something, made him anxious to ascertain some additional\r\ndetails of the event, if any existed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other, without hesitation; \xe2\x80\x98though I am afraid\r\nI haven\xe2\x80\x99t much beyond what we printed at the time. Let me see--my old\r\nnote-books are in my drawer at the office of the paper: if you will\r\ncome with me I can refer to them there.\xe2\x80\x99 His wife and family were at tea\r\ninside the room, and with the timidity of decent poverty everywhere he\r\nseemed glad to get a stranger out of his domestic groove.\r\n\r\nThey crossed the street, entered the office, and went thence to an\r\ninner room. Here, after a short search, was found the book required. The\r\nprecise address, not given in the condensed report that was printed, but\r\nwritten down by the reporter, was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98ABRAHAM BROWN,\r\n          LODGING-HOUSE KEEPER,\r\n              41 CHARLES SQUARE,\r\n                   HOXTON.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nOwen copied it, and gave the reporter a small fee. \xe2\x80\x98I want to keep\r\nthis inquiry private for the present,\xe2\x80\x99 he said hesitatingly. \xe2\x80\x98You will\r\nperhaps understand why, and oblige me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe reporter promised. \xe2\x80\x98News is shop with me,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and to escape\r\nfrom handling it is my greatest social enjoyment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was evening, and the outer room of the publishing-office was lighted\r\nup with flaring jets of gas. After making the above remark, the reporter\r\ncame out from the inner apartment in Graye\xe2\x80\x99s company, answering an\r\nexpression of obligation from Owen with the words that it was no\r\ntrouble. At the moment of his speech, he closed behind him the door\r\nbetween the two rooms, still holding his note-book in his hand.\r\n\r\nBefore the counter of the front room stood a tall man, who was also\r\nspeaking, when they emerged. He said to the youth in attendance, \xe2\x80\x98I will\r\ntake my paper for this week now I am here, so that you needn\xe2\x80\x99t post it\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe stranger then slightly turned his head, saw Owen, and recognized\r\nhim. Owen passed out without recognizing the other as Manston.\r\n\r\nManston then looked at the reporter, who, after walking to the door with\r\nOwen, had come back again to lock up his books. Manston did not need to\r\nbe told that the shabby marble-covered book which he held in his\r\nhand, opening endways and interleaved with blotting-paper, was an\r\nold reporting-book. He raised his eyes to the reporter\xe2\x80\x99s face, whose\r\nexperience had not so schooled his features but that they betrayed a\r\nconsciousness, to one half initiated as the other was, that his late\r\nproceeding had been connected with events in the life of the steward.\r\nManston said no more, but, taking his newspaper, followed Owen from the\r\noffice, and disappeared in the gloom of the street.\r\n\r\nEdward Springrove was now in London again, and on this same evening,\r\nbefore leaving Casterbridge, Owen wrote a careful letter to him, stating\r\ntherein all the facts that had come to his knowledge, and begging\r\nhim, as he valued Cytherea, to make cautious inquiries. A tall man\r\nwas standing under the lamp-post, about half-a-dozen yards above the\r\npost-office, when he dropped the letter into the box.\r\n\r\nThat same night, too, for a reason connected with the rencounter with\r\nOwen Graye, the steward entertained the idea of rushing off suddenly to\r\nLondon by the mail-train, which left Casterbridge at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\nBut remembering that letters posted after the hour at which Owen had\r\nobtained his information--whatever that was--could not be delivered\r\nin London till Monday morning, he changed his mind and went home to\r\nKnapwater. Making a confidential explanation to his wife, arrangements\r\nwere set on foot for his departure by the mail on Sunday night.\r\n\r\n3. MARCH THE ELEVENTH\r\n\r\nStarting for church the next morning several minutes earlier than was\r\nusual with him, the steward intentionally loitered along the road from\r\nthe village till old Mr. Springrove overtook him. Manston spoke very\r\ncivilly of the morning, and of the weather, asking how the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbarometer stood, and when it was probable that the wind might change. It\r\nwas not in Mr. Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s nature--going to church as he was, too--to\r\nreturn anything but a civil answer to such civil questions, however his\r\nfeelings might have been biassed by late events. The conversation was\r\ncontinued on terms of greater friendliness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must be feeling settled again by this time, Mr. Springrove, after\r\nthe rough turn-out you had on that terrible night in November.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about feeling settled, either, Mr. Manston. The\r\nold window in the chimney-corner of the old house I shall never forget.\r\nNo window in the chimney-corner where I am now, and I had been used to\r\nit for more than fifty years. Ted says \xe2\x80\x98tis a great loss to me, and he\r\nknows exactly what I feel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your son is again in a good situation, I believe?\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston,\r\nimitating that inquisitiveness into the private affairs of the natives\r\nwhich passes for high breeding in country villages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir. I hope he\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it, or do something else and stick to it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis to be hoped he\xe2\x80\x99ll be steady now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s always been that, I assure \xe2\x80\x98ee,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man tartly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--yes--I mean intellectually steady. Intellectual wild oats will\r\nthrive in a soil of the strictest morality.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Intellectual gingerbread! Ted\xe2\x80\x99s steady enough--that\xe2\x80\x99s all I know about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course--of course. Has he respectable lodgings? My own experience\r\nhas shown me that that\xe2\x80\x99s a great thing to a young man living alone in\r\nLondon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Warwick Street, Charing Cross--that\xe2\x80\x99s where he is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, to be sure--strange! A very dear friend of mine used to live at\r\nnumber fifty-two in that very same street.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Edward lives at number forty-nine--how very near being the same house!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the old farmer, pleased in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston. \xe2\x80\x98Well, I suppose we had better step along a little\r\nquicker, Mr. Springrove; the parson\xe2\x80\x99s bell has just begun.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Number forty-nine,\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured.\r\n\r\n4. MARCH THE TWELFTH\r\n\r\nEdward received Owen\xe2\x80\x99s letter in due time, but on account of his daily\r\nengagements he could not attend to any request till the clock had struck\r\nfive in the afternoon. Rushing then from his office in Westminster, he\r\ncalled a hansom and proceeded to Hoxton. A few minutes later he knocked\r\nat the door of number forty-one, Charles Square, the old lodging of Mrs.\r\nManston.\r\n\r\nA tall man who would have looked extremely handsome had he not been\r\nclumsily and closely wrapped up in garments that were much too elderly\r\nin style for his years, stood at the corner of the quiet square at the\r\nsame instant, having, too, alighted from a cab, that had been driven\r\nalong Old Street in Edward\xe2\x80\x99s rear. He smiled confidently when Springrove\r\nknocked.\r\n\r\nNobody came to the door. Springrove knocked again.\r\n\r\nThis brought out two people--one at the door he had been knocking upon,\r\nthe other from the next on the right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Mr. Brown at home?\xe2\x80\x99 said Springrove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When will he be in?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite uncertain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can you tell me where I may find him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. O, here he is coming, sir. That\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Brown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEdward looked down the pavement in the direction pointed out by the\r\nwoman, and saw a man approaching. He proceeded a few steps to meet him.\r\n\r\nEdward was impatient, and to a certain extent still a countryman, who\r\nhad not, after the manner of city men, subdued the natural impulse to\r\nspeak out the ruling thought without preface. He said in a quiet tone to\r\nthe stranger, \xe2\x80\x98One word with you--do you remember a lady lodger of yours\r\nof the name of Mrs. Manston?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Brown half closed his eyes at Springrove, somewhat as if he were\r\nlooking into a telescope at the wrong end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have never let lodgings in my life,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, after his survey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you attend an inquest a year and a half ago, at Carriford?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never knew there was such a place in the world, sir; and as to\r\nlodgings, I have taken acres first and last during the last thirty\r\nyears, but I have never let an inch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose there is some mistake,\xe2\x80\x99 Edward murmured, and turned away. He\r\nand Mr. Brown were now opposite the door next to the one he had knocked\r\nat. The woman who was still standing there had heard the inquiry and the\r\nresult of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I expect it is the other Mr. Brown, who used to live there, that you\r\nwant, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98The Mr. Brown that was inquired for the other\r\nday?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very likely that is the man,\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward, his interest reawakening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make a do of lodging-letting here, and at last he went to\r\nCornwall, where he came from, and where his brother still lived, who\r\nhad often asked him to come home again. But there was little luck in the\r\nchange; for after London they say he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand the rainy west winds\r\nthey get there, and he died in the December following. Will you step\r\ninto the passage?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate,\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward, going in. \xe2\x80\x98But perhaps you remember a\r\nMrs. Manston living next door to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the landlady, closing the door. \xe2\x80\x98The lady who was supposed\r\nto have met with such a horrible fate, and was alive all the time. I saw\r\nher the other day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Since the fire at Carriford?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Her husband came to ask if Mr. Brown was still living here--just\r\nas you might. He seemed anxious about it; and then one evening, a week\r\nor fortnight afterwards, when he came again to make further inquiries,\r\nshe was with him. But I did not speak to her--she stood back, as if she\r\nwere shy. I was interested, however, for old Mr. Brown had told me all\r\nabout her when he came back from the inquest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you know Mrs. Manston before she called the other day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. You see she was only Mr. Brown\xe2\x80\x99s lodger for two or three weeks,\r\nand I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know she was living there till she was near upon leaving\r\nagain--we don\xe2\x80\x99t notice next-door people much here in London. I much\r\nregretted I had not known her when I heard what had happened. It led\r\nme and Mr. Brown to talk about her a great deal afterwards. I little\r\nthought I should see her alive after all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And when do you say they came here together?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly remember the day--though I remember a very beautiful\r\ndream I had that same night--ah, I shall never forget it! Shoals of\r\nlodgers coming along the square with angels\xe2\x80\x99 wings and bright golden\r\nsovereigns in their hands wanting apartments at West End prices. They\r\nwould not give any less; no, not if you--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Did Mrs. Manston leave anything, such as papers, when she left\r\nthese lodgings originally?\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward, though his heart sank as he\r\nasked. He felt that he was outwitted. Manston and his wife had been\r\nthere before him, clearing the ground of all traces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have always said \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d hitherto,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the woman, \xe2\x80\x98considering I\r\ncould say no more if put upon my oath, as I expected to be. But speaking\r\nin a common everyday way now the occurrence is past, I believe a few\r\nthings of some kind (though I doubt if they were papers) were left in\r\na workbox she had, because she talked about it to Mr. Brown, and was\r\nrather angry at what occurred--you see, she had a temper by all account,\r\nand so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to remind the lady of this workbox when she came\r\nthe other day with her husband.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And about the workbox?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, from what was casually dropped, I think Mrs. Manston had a few\r\narticles of furniture she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want, and when she was leaving they\r\nwere put in a sale just by. Amongst her things were two workboxes very\r\nmuch alike. One of these she intended to sell, the other she didn\xe2\x80\x99t, and\r\nMr. Brown, who collected the things together, took the wrong one to the\r\nsale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What was in it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, nothing in particular, or of any value--some accounts, and her usual\r\nsewing materials I think--nothing more. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t take much trouble\r\nto get it back--she said the bills were worth nothing to her or anybody\r\nelse, but that she should have liked to keep the box because her husband\r\ngave it her when they were first married, and if he found she had parted\r\nwith it, he would be vexed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did Mrs. Manston, when she called recently with her husband, allude to\r\nthis, or inquire for it, or did Mr. Manston?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--and I rather wondered at it. But she seemed to have forgotten\r\nit--indeed, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t make any inquiry at all, only standing behind\r\nhim, listening to his; and he probably had never been told anything\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whose sale were these articles of hers taken to?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who was the auctioneer? Mr. Halway. His place is the third turning\r\nfrom the end of that street you see there. Anybody will tell you the\r\nshop--his name is written up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEdward went off to follow up his clue with a promptness which was\r\ndictated more by a dogged will to do his utmost than by a hope of\r\ndoing much. When he was out of sight, the tall and cloaked man, who had\r\nwatched him, came up to the woman\xe2\x80\x99s door, with an appearance of being in\r\nbreathless haste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has a gentleman been here inquiring about Mrs. Manston?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; he\xe2\x80\x99s just gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me! I want him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s gone to Mr. Halway\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I can give him some information upon the subject. Does he pay\r\npretty liberally?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He gave me half-a-crown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That scale will do. I\xe2\x80\x99m a poor man, and will see what my little\r\ncontribution to his knowledge will fetch. But, by the way, perhaps you\r\ntold him all I know--where she lived before coming to live here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where she lived before coming here. O no--I only said\r\nwhat Mr. Brown had told me. He seemed a nice, gentle young man, or I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been so open as I was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall now about catch him at Mr. Halway\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, and went\r\naway as hastily as he had come.\r\n\r\nEdward in the meantime had reached the auction-room. He found some\r\ndifficulty, on account of the inertness of those whose only inducement\r\nto an action is a mere wish from another, in getting the information he\r\nstood in need of, but it was at last accorded him. The auctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s book\r\ngave the name of Mrs. Higgins, 3 Canley Passage, as the purchaser of the\r\nlot which had included Mrs. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s workbox.\r\n\r\nThither Edward went, followed by the man. Four bell pulls, one above the\r\nother like waistcoat-buttons, appeared on the door-post. Edward seized\r\nthe first he came to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who did you woant?\xe2\x80\x99 said a thin voice from somewhere.\r\n\r\nEdward looked above and around him; nobody was visible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who did you woant?\xe2\x80\x99 said the thin voice again.\r\n\r\nHe found now that the sound proceeded from below the grating covering\r\nthe basement window. He dropped his glance through the bars, and saw a\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s white face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who did you woant?\xe2\x80\x99 said the voice the third time, with precisely the\r\nsame languid inflection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Higgins,\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Third bell up,\xe2\x80\x99 said the face, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nHe pulled the third bell from the bottom, and was admitted by another\r\nchild, the daughter of the woman he was in search of. He gave the little\r\nthing sixpence, and asked for her mamma. The child led him upstairs.\r\n\r\nMrs. Higgins was the wife of a carpenter who from want of employment\r\none winter had decided to marry. Afterwards they both took to drink,\r\nand sank into desperate circumstances. A few chairs and a table were\r\nthe chief articles of furniture in the third-floor back room which they\r\noccupied. A roll of baby-linen lay on the floor; beside it a pap-clogged\r\nspoon and an overturned tin pap-cup. Against the wall a Dutch clock was\r\nfixed out of level, and ticked wildly in longs and shorts, its entrails\r\nhanging down beneath its white face and wiry hands, like the faeces of a\r\nHarpy [\xe2\x80\x98foedissima ventris proluvies, uncaeque manus, et pallida semper\r\nora\xe2\x80\x99). A baby was crying against every chair-leg, the whole family of\r\nsix or seven being small enough to be covered by a washing-tub. Mrs.\r\nHiggins sat helpless, clothed in a dress which had hooks and eyes in\r\nplenty, but never one opposite the other, thereby rendering the\r\ndress almost useless as a screen to the bosom. No workbox was visible\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nIt was a depressing picture of married life among the very poor of a\r\ncity. Only for one short hour in the whole twenty-four did husband and\r\nwife taste genuine happiness. It was in the evening, when, after\r\nthe sale of some necessary article of furniture, they were under the\r\ninfluence of a quartern of gin.\r\n\r\nOf all the ingenious and cruel satires that from the beginning till now\r\nhave been stuck like knives into womankind, surely there is not one so\r\nlacerating to them, and to us who love them, as the trite old fact, that\r\nthe most wretched of men can, in the twinkling of an eye, find a wife\r\nready to be more wretched still for the sake of his company.\r\n\r\nEdward hastened to despatch his errand.\r\n\r\nMrs. Higgins had lately pawned the workbox with other useless articles\r\nof lumber, she said. Edward bought the duplicate of her, and went\r\ndownstairs to the pawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nIn the back division of a musty shop, amid the heterogeneous collection\r\nof articles and odours invariably crowding such places, he produced his\r\nticket, and with a sense of satisfaction out of all proportion to the\r\nprobable worth of his acquisition, took the box and carried it off\r\nunder his arm. He attempted to lift the cover as he walked, but found it\r\nlocked.\r\n\r\nIt was dusk when Springrove reached his lodging. Entering his small\r\nsitting-room, the front apartment on the ground floor, he struck a\r\nlight, and proceeded to learn if any scrap or mark within or upon his\r\npurchase rendered it of moment to the business in hand. Breaking open\r\nthe cover with a small chisel, and lifting the tray, he glanced eagerly\r\nbeneath, and found--nothing.\r\n\r\nHe next discovered that a pocket or portfolio was formed on the\r\nunderside of the cover. This he unfastened, and slipping his hand\r\nwithin, found that it really contained some substance. First he pulled\r\nout about a dozen tangled silk and cotton threads. Under them were\r\na short household account, a dry moss-rosebud, and an old pair of\r\ncarte-de-visite photographs. One of these was a likeness of Mrs.\r\nManston--\xe2\x80\x98Eunice\xe2\x80\x99 being written under it in ink--the other of Manston\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHe sat down dispirited. This was all the fruit of his task--not a single\r\nletter, date, or address of any kind to help him--and was it likely\r\nthere would be?\r\n\r\nHowever, thinking he would send the fragments, such as they were, to\r\nGraye, in order to satisfy him that he had done his best so far,\r\nhe scribbled a line, and put all except the silk and cotton into an\r\nenvelope. Looking at his watch, he found it was then twenty minutes to\r\nseven; by affixing an extra stamp he would be enabled to despatch them\r\nby that evening\xe2\x80\x99s post. He hastily directed the packet, and ran with it\r\nat once to the post-office at Charing Cross.\r\n\r\nOn his return he took up the workbox again to examine it more leisurely.\r\nHe then found there was also a small cavity in the tray under the\r\npincushion, which was movable by a bit of ribbon. Lifting this he\r\nuncovered a flattened sprig of myrtle, and a small scrap of crumpled\r\npaper. The paper contained a verse or two in a man\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting. He\r\nrecognized it as Manston\xe2\x80\x99s, having seen notes and bills from him at his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s house. The stanza was of a complimentary character, descriptive\r\nof the lady who was now Manston\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        \xe2\x80\x98EUNICE.\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x98Whoso for hours or lengthy days\r\n           Shall catch her aspect\xe2\x80\x99s changeful rays,\r\n           Then turn away, can none recall\r\n           Beyond a galaxy of all\r\n               In hazy portraiture;\r\n           Lit by the light of azure eyes\r\n           Like summer days by summer skies:\r\n           Her sweet transitions seem to be\r\n           A kind of pictured melody,\r\n               And not a set contour.\r\n                                      \xe2\x80\x98AE. M.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nTo shake, pull, and ransack the box till he had almost destroyed it was\r\nnow his natural action. But it contained absolutely nothing more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Disappointed again,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, flinging down the box, the bit of paper,\r\nand the withered twig that had lain with it.\r\n\r\nYet valueless as the new acquisition was, on second thoughts he\r\nconsidered that it would be worth while to make good the statement in\r\nhis late note to Graye--that he had sent everything the box contained\r\nexcept the sewing-thread. Thereupon he enclosed the verse and\r\nmyrtle-twig in another envelope, with a remark that he had overlooked\r\nthem in his first search, and put it on the table for the next day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npost.\r\n\r\nIn his hurry and concentration upon the matter that occupied him,\r\nSpringrove, on entering his lodging and obtaining a light, had not\r\nwaited to pull down the blind or close the shutters. Consequently all\r\nthat he had done had been visible from the street. But as on an average\r\nnot one person a minute passed along the quiet pavement at this time\r\nof the evening, the discovery of the omission did not much concern his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nBut the real state of the case was that a tall man had stood against the\r\nopposite wall and watched the whole of his proceeding. When Edward came\r\nout and went to the Charing Cross post-office, the man followed him\r\nand saw him drop the letter into the box. The stranger did not further\r\ntrouble himself to follow Springrove back to his lodging again.\r\n\r\nManston now knew that there had been photographs of some kind in his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s workbox, and though he had not been near enough to see them, he\r\nguessed whose they were. The least reflection told him to whom they had\r\nbeen sent.\r\n\r\nHe paused a minute under the portico of the post-office, looking at the\r\ntwo or three omnibuses stopping and starting in front of him. Then he\r\nrushed along the Strand, through Holywell Street, and on to Old Boswell\r\nCourt. Kicking aside the shoeblacks who began to importune him as he\r\npassed under the colonnade, he turned up the narrow passage to the\r\npublishing-office of the Post-Office Directory. He begged to be allowed\r\nto see the Directory of the south-west counties of England for a moment.\r\n\r\nThe shopman immediately handed down the volume from a shelf, and Manston\r\nretired with it to the window-bench. He turned to the county, and\r\nthen to the parish of Tolchurch. At the end of the historical and\r\ntopographical description of the village he read:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Postmistress--Mrs. Hurston. Letters received at 6.30 A.M. by foot-post\r\nfrom Anglebury.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nReturning his thanks, he handed back the book and quitted the office,\r\nthence pursuing his way to an obscure coffee-house by the Strand, where\r\nhe now partook of a light dinner. But rest seemed impossible with him.\r\nSome absorbing intention kept his body continually on the move. He\r\npaid his bill, took his bag in his hand, and went out to idle about the\r\nstreets and over the river till the time should have arrived at which\r\nthe night-mail left the Waterloo Station, by which train he intended to\r\nreturn homeward.\r\n\r\nThere exists, as it were, an outer chamber to the mind, in which, when a\r\nman is occupied centrally with the most momentous question of his life,\r\ncasual and trifling thoughts are just allowed to wander softly for an\r\ninterval, before being banished altogether. Thus, amid his concentration\r\ndid Manston receive perceptions of the individuals about him in the\r\nlively thoroughfare of the Strand; tall men looking insignificant;\r\nlittle men looking great and profound; lost women of miserable repute\r\nlooking as happy as the days are long; wives, happy by assumption,\r\nlooking careworn and miserable. Each and all were alike in this one\r\nrespect, that they followed a solitary trail like the inwoven threads\r\nwhich form a banner, and all were equally unconscious of the significant\r\nwhole they collectively showed forth.\r\n\r\nAt ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock he turned into Lancaster Place, crossed the river,\r\nand entered the railway-station, where he took his seat in the down\r\nmail-train, which bore him, and Edward Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s letter to Graye, far\r\naway from London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII. THE EVENTS OF ONE DAY\r\n\r\n1. MARCH THE THIRTEENTH. THREE TO SIX O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK A.M.\r\n\r\nThey entered Anglebury Station in the dead, still time of early morning,\r\nthe clock over the booking-office pointing to twenty-five minutes to\r\nthree. Manston lingered on the platform and saw the mail-bags brought\r\nout, noticing, as a pertinent pastime, the many shabby blotches of wax\r\nfrom innumerable seals that had been set upon their mouths. The guard\r\ntook them into a fly, and was driven down the road to the post-office.\r\n\r\nIt was a raw, damp, uncomfortable morning, though, as yet, little rain\r\nwas falling. Manston drank a mouthful from his flask and walked at once\r\naway from the station, pursuing his way through the gloom till he stood\r\non the side of the town adjoining, at a distance from the last house in\r\nthe street of about two hundred yards.\r\n\r\nThe station road was also the turnpike-road into the country, the first\r\npart of its course being across a heath. Having surveyed the highway up\r\nand down to make sure of its bearing, Manston methodically set himself\r\nto walk backwards and forwards a stone\xe2\x80\x99s throw in each direction.\r\nAlthough the spring was temperate, the time of day, and the condition\r\nof suspense in which the steward found himself, caused a sensation of\r\nchilliness to pervade his frame in spite of the overcoat he wore. The\r\ndrizzling rain increased, and drops from the trees at the wayside fell\r\nnoisily upon the hard road beneath them, which reflected from its glassy\r\nsurface the faint halo of light hanging over the lamps of the adjacent\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nHere he walked and lingered for two hours, without seeing or hearing a\r\nliving soul. Then he heard the market-house clock strike five, and soon\r\nafterwards, quick hard footsteps smote upon the pavement of the street\r\nleading towards him. They were those of the postman for the Tolchurch\r\nbeat. He reached the bottom of the street, gave his bags a final\r\nhitch-up, stepped off the pavement, and struck out for the country with\r\na brisk shuffle.\r\n\r\nManston then turned his back upon the town, and walked slowly on. In two\r\nminutes a flickering light shone upon his form, and the postman overtook\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe new-comer was a short, stooping individual of above five-and-forty,\r\nladen on both sides with leather bags large and small, and carrying a\r\nlittle lantern strapped to his breast, which cast a tiny patch of light\r\nupon the road ahead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A tryen mornen for travellers!\xe2\x80\x99 the postman cried, in a cheerful voice,\r\nwithout turning his head or slackening his trot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston, stepping out abreast of him. \xe2\x80\x98You have a\r\nlong walk every day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--a long walk--for though the distance is only sixteen miles on the\r\nstraight--that is, eight to the furthest place and eight back, what with\r\nthe ins and outs to the gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s houses, it makes two-and-twenty for\r\nmy legs. Two-and-twenty miles a day, how many a year? I used to reckon\r\nit, but I never do now. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to think o\xe2\x80\x99 my wear and tear, now\r\nit do begin to tell upon me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus the conversation was begun, and the postman proceeded to narrate\r\nthe different strange events that marked his experience. Manston grew\r\nvery friendly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Postman, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what your custom is,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, after a while;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but between you and me, I always carry a drop of something warm in my\r\npocket when I am out on such a morning as this. Try it.\xe2\x80\x99 He handed the\r\nbottle of brandy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, please. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t took no stimmilents these five\r\nyears.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis never too late to mend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Against the regulations, I be afraid.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99ll know it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s true--nobody will know it. Still, honesty\xe2\x80\x99s the best policy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--it is certainly. But, thank God, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to get on without\r\nit yet. You\xe2\x80\x99ll surely drink with me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really, \xe2\x80\x98tis a\xe2\x80\x99most too early for that sort o\xe2\x80\x99 thing--however, to\r\noblige a friend, I don\xe2\x80\x99t object to the faintest shadder of a drop.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\npostman drank, and Manston did the same to a very slight degree. Five\r\nminutes later, when they came to a gate, the flask was pulled out again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well done!\xe2\x80\x99 said the postman, beginning to feel its effect; \xe2\x80\x98but guide\r\nmy soul, I be afraid \xe2\x80\x98twill hardly do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not unless \xe2\x80\x98tis well followed, like any other line you take up,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nManston. \xe2\x80\x98Besides, there\xe2\x80\x99s a way of liking a drop of liquor, and of\r\nbeing good--even religious--at the same time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, for some thimble-and-button in-an-out fellers; but I could never\r\nget into the knack o\xe2\x80\x99 it; not I.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be troubled; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary for the higher class\r\nof mind to be religious--they have so much common-sense that they can\r\nrisk playing with fire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That hits me exactly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In fact, a man I know, who always had no other god but \xe2\x80\x9cMe;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\ndevoutly loved his neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s wife, says now that believing is a\r\nmistake.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, to be sure! However, believing in God is a mistake made by very\r\nfew people, after all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A true remark.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not one Christian in our parish would walk half a mile in a rain\r\nlike this to know whether the Scripture had concluded him under sin or\r\ngrace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor in mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, you may depend upon it they\xe2\x80\x99ll do away wi\xe2\x80\x99 Goddymity altogether\r\nafore long, although we\xe2\x80\x99ve had him over us so many years.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I suppose the Queen \xe2\x80\x98ill be done away wi\xe2\x80\x99 then. A pretty concern\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99ll be! Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s head to put on your letters; and then your honest\r\nman who do pay his penny will never be known from your scamp who don\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nO, \xe2\x80\x98tis a nation!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Warm the cockles of your heart, however. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the bottle waiting.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll oblige you, my friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe drinking was repeated. The postman grew livelier as he went on, and\r\nat length favoured the steward with a song, Manston himself joining in\r\nthe chorus.\r\n\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x98He flung his mallet against the wall,\r\n           Said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord make churches and chapels to fall,\r\n           And there\xe2\x80\x99ll be work for tradesmen all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n                When Joan\xe2\x80\x99s ale was new,\r\n                               My boys,\r\n               When Joan\xe2\x80\x99s ale was new.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You understand, friend,\xe2\x80\x99 the postman added, \xe2\x80\x98I was originally a mason\r\nby trade: no offence to you if you be a parson?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston.\r\n\r\nThe rain now came down heavily, but they pursued their path with\r\nalacrity, the produce of the several fields between which the lane wound\r\nits way being indicated by the peculiar character of the sound emitted\r\nby the falling drops. Sometimes a soaking hiss proclaimed that they were\r\npassing by a pasture, then a patter would show that the rain fell upon\r\nsome large-leafed root crop, then a paddling plash announced the naked\r\narable, the low sound of the wind in their ears rising and falling with\r\neach pace they took.\r\n\r\nBesides the small private bags of the county families, which were all\r\nlocked, the postman bore the large general budget for the remaining\r\ninhabitants along his beat. At each village or hamlet they came to, the\r\npostman searched for the packet of letters destined for that place, and\r\nthrust it into an ordinary letter-hole cut in the door of the receiver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncottage--the village post-offices being mostly kept by old women who had\r\nnot yet risen, though lights moving in other cottage windows showed that\r\nsuch people as carters, woodmen, and stablemen had long been stirring.\r\n\r\nThe postman had by this time become markedly unsteady, but he still\r\ncontinued to be too conscious of his duties to suffer the steward to\r\nsearch the bag. Manston was perplexed, and at lonely points in the road\r\ncast his eyes keenly upon the short bowed figure of the man trotting\r\nthrough the mud by his side, as if he were half inclined to run a very\r\ngreat risk indeed.\r\n\r\nIt frequently happened that the houses of farmers, clergymen, etc., lay\r\na short distance up or down a lane or path branching from the direct\r\ntrack of the postman\xe2\x80\x99s journey. To save time and distance, at the point\r\nof junction of some of these paths with the main road, the gate-post was\r\nhollowed out to form a letter-box, in which the postman deposited his\r\nmissives in the morning, looking in the box again in the evening to\r\ncollect those placed there for the return post. Tolchurch Vicarage\r\nand Farmstead, lying back from the village street, were served on this\r\nprinciple. This fact the steward now learnt by conversing with the\r\npostman, and the discovery relieved Manston greatly, making his\r\nintentions much clearer to himself than they had been in the earlier\r\nstages of his journey.\r\n\r\nThey had reached the outskirts of the village. Manston insisted upon the\r\nflask being emptied before they proceeded further. This was done, and\r\nthey approached the church, the vicarage, and the farmhouse in which\r\nOwen and Cytherea were living.\r\n\r\nThe postman paused, fumbled in his bag, took out by the light of his\r\nlantern some half-dozen letters, and tried to sort them. He could not\r\nperform the task.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We be crippled disciples a b\xe2\x80\x99lieve,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, with a sigh and a\r\nstagger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not drunk, but market-merry,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well done! If I baint so weak that I can\xe2\x80\x99t see the clouds--much\r\nless letters. Guide my soul, if so be anybody should tell the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npostmaster-general of me! The whole story will have to go through\r\nParliament House, and I shall be high-treasoned--as safe as houses--and\r\nbe fined, and who\xe2\x80\x99ll pay for a poor martel! O, \xe2\x80\x98tis a world!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Trust in the Lord--he\xe2\x80\x99ll pay.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He pay a b\xe2\x80\x99lieve! why should he when he didn\xe2\x80\x99t drink the drink? He pay\r\na b\xe2\x80\x99lieve! D\xe2\x80\x99ye think the man\xe2\x80\x99s a fool?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well, I had no intention of hurting your feelings--but how was I\r\nto know you were so sensitive?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True--you were not to know I was so sensitive. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a caddle wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthese letters! Guide my soul, what will Billy do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nManston offered his services.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are to be divided,\xe2\x80\x99 the man said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How?\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98These, for the village, to be carried on into it: any for the vicarage\r\nor vicarage farm must be left in the box of the gate-post just here.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s none for the vicarage-house this mornen, but I saw when I\r\nstarted there was one for the clerk o\xe2\x80\x99 works at the new church. This is\r\nit, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe held up a large envelope, directed in Edward Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhandwriting:--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98MR. O. GRAYE,\r\n          CLERK OF WORKS,\r\n               TOLCHURCH,\r\n                    NEAR ANGLEBURY.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe letter-box was scooped in an oak gate-post about a foot square.\r\nThere was no slit for inserting the letters, by reason of the\r\nopportunity such a lonely spot would have afforded mischievous\r\npeasant-boys of doing damage had such been the case; but at the side was\r\na small iron door, kept close by an iron reversible strap locked across\r\nit. One side of this strap was painted black, the other white, and white\r\nor black outwards implied respectively that there were letters inside,\r\nor none.\r\n\r\nThe postman had taken the key from his pocket and was attempting to\r\ninsert it in the keyhole of the box. He touched one side, the other,\r\nabove, below, but never made a straight hit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me unlock it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston, taking the key from the postman. He\r\nopened the box and reached out with his other hand for Owen\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no. O no--no,\xe2\x80\x99 the postman said. \xe2\x80\x98As one of--Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservants--care--Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s mails--duty--put letters--own hands.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nslowly and solemnly placed the letter in the small cavity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now lock it,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, closing the door.\r\n\r\nThe steward placed the bar across, with the black side outwards,\r\nsignifying \xe2\x80\x98empty,\xe2\x80\x99 and turned the key.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve put the wrong side outwards!\xe2\x80\x99 said the postman. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t empty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And dropped the key in the mud, so that I can\xe2\x80\x99t alter it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nsteward, letting something fall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What an awkward thing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is an awkward thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey both went searching in the mud, which their own trampling had\r\nreduced to the consistency of pap, the postman unstrapping his little\r\nlantern from his breast, and thrusting it about, close to the ground,\r\nthe rain still drizzling down, and the dawn so tardy on account of the\r\nheavy clouds that daylight seemed delayed indefinitely. The rays of\r\nthe lantern were rendered individually visible upon the thick mist, and\r\nseemed almost tangible as they passed off into it, after illuminating\r\nthe faces and knees of the two stooping figures dripping with wet; the\r\npostman\xe2\x80\x99s cape and private bags, and the steward\xe2\x80\x99s valise, glistening as\r\nif they had been varnished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It fell on the grass,\xe2\x80\x99 said the postman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; it fell in the mud,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston. They searched again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid we shan\xe2\x80\x99t find it by this light,\xe2\x80\x99 said the steward at\r\nlength, washing his muddy fingers in the wet grass of the bank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid we shan\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other, standing up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what we had better do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston. \xe2\x80\x98I shall be back\r\nthis way in an hour or so, and since it was all my fault, I\xe2\x80\x99ll look\r\nagain, and shall be sure to find it in the daylight. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll hide the\r\nkey here for you.\xe2\x80\x99 He pointed to a spot behind the post. \xe2\x80\x98It will be too\r\nlate to turn the index then, as the people will have been here, so that\r\nthe box had better stay as it is. The letter will only be delayed a day,\r\nand that will not be noticed; if it is, you can say you placed the iron\r\nthe wrong way without knowing it, and all will be well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis was agreed to by the postman as the best thing to be done under\r\nthe circumstances, and the pair went on. They had passed the village and\r\ncome to a crossroad, when the steward, telling his companion that their\r\npaths now diverged, turned off to the left towards Carriford.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the postman out of sight and hearing than Manston stalked\r\nback to the vicarage letter-box by keeping inside a fence, and thus\r\navoiding the village; arrived here, he took the key from his pocket,\r\nwhere it had been concealed all the time, and abstracted Owen\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\r\nThis done, he turned towards home, by the help of what he carried in\r\nhis valise adjusting himself to his ordinary appearance as he neared the\r\nquarter in which he was known.\r\n\r\nAn hour and half\xe2\x80\x99s sharp walking brought him to his own door in\r\nKnapwater Park.\r\n\r\n2. EIGHT O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK A.M.\r\n\r\nSeated in his private office he wetted the flap of the stolen letter,\r\nand waited patiently till the adhesive gum could be loosened. He took\r\nout Edward\xe2\x80\x99s note, the accounts, the rosebud, and the photographs,\r\nregarding them with the keenest interest and anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe note, the accounts, the rosebud, and his own photograph, he restored\r\nto their places again. The other photograph he took between his finger\r\nand thumb, and held it towards the bars of the grate. There he held it\r\nfor half-a-minute or more, meditating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a great risk to run, even for such an end,\xe2\x80\x99 he muttered.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, impregnated with a bright idea, he jumped up and left the\r\noffice for the front parlour. Taking up an album of portraits, which lay\r\non the table, he searched for three or four likenesses of the lady who\r\nhad so lately displaced Cytherea, which were interspersed among the\r\nrest of the collection, and carefully regarded them. They were taken in\r\ndifferent attitudes and styles, and he compared each singly with that he\r\nheld in his hand. One of them, the one most resembling that abstracted\r\nfrom the letter in general tone, size, and attitude, he selected from\r\nthe rest, and returned with it to his office.\r\n\r\nPouring some water into a plate, he set the two portraits afloat upon\r\nit, and sitting down tried to read.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a quarter of an hour, after several ineffectual attempts,\r\nhe found that each photograph would peel from the card on which it was\r\nmounted. This done, he threw into the fire the original likeness and the\r\nrecent card, stuck upon the original card the recent likeness from the\r\nalbum, dried it before the fire, and placed it in the envelope with the\r\nother scraps.\r\n\r\nThe result he had obtained, then, was this: in the envelope were now two\r\nphotographs, both having the same photographer\xe2\x80\x99s name on the back and\r\nconsecutive numbers attached. At the bottom of the one which showed his\r\nown likeness, his own name was written down; on the other his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname was written; whilst the central feature, and whole matter to which\r\nthis latter card and writing referred, the likeness of a lady mounted\r\nupon it, had been changed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Manston entered the room, and begged him to come to breakfast. He\r\nfollowed her and they sat down. During the meal he told her what he had\r\ndone, with scrupulous regard to every detail, and showed her the result.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is indeed a great risk to run,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, sipping her tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it would be a greater not to do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe envelope was again fastened up as before, and Manston put it in\r\nhis pocket and went out. Shortly afterwards he was seen, on horseback,\r\nriding in a direction towards Tolchurch. Keeping to the fields, as well\r\nas he could, for the greater part of the way, he dropped into the road\r\nby the vicarage letter-box, and looking carefully about, to ascertain\r\nthat no person was near, he restored the letter to its nook, placed the\r\nkey in its hiding-place, as he had promised the postman, and again rode\r\nhomewards by a roundabout way.\r\n\r\n3. AFTERNOON\r\n\r\nThe letter was brought to Owen Graye, the same afternoon, by one of the\r\nvicar\xe2\x80\x99s servants who had been to the box with a duplicate key, as usual,\r\nto leave letters for the evening post. The man found that the index had\r\ntold falsely that morning for the first time within his recollection;\r\nbut no particular attention was paid to the mistake, as it was\r\nconsidered. The contents of the envelope were scrutinized by Owen and\r\nflung aside as useless.\r\n\r\nThe next morning brought Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s second letter, the existence of\r\nwhich was unknown to Manston. The sight of Edward\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting again\r\nraised the expectations of brother and sister, till Owen had opened the\r\nenvelope and pulled out the twig and verse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing that\xe2\x80\x99s of the slightest use, after all,\xe2\x80\x99 he said to her; \xe2\x80\x98we\r\nare as far as ever from the merest shadow of legal proof that would\r\nconvict him of what I am morally certain he did, marry you, suspecting,\r\nif not knowing, her to be alive all the time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What has Edward sent?\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An old amatory verse in Manston\xe2\x80\x99s writing. Fancy,\xe2\x80\x99 he said bitterly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98this is the strain he addressed her in when they were courting--as he\r\ndid you, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe handed her the verse and she read--\r\n\r\n\r\n                        \xe2\x80\x98EUNICE.\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x98Whoso for hours or lengthy days\r\n           Shall catch her aspect\xe2\x80\x99s changeful rays,\r\n           Then turn away, can none recall\r\n           Beyond a galaxy of all\r\n               In hazy portraiture;\r\n           Lit by the light of azure eyes\r\n           Like summer days by summer skies:\r\n           Her sweet transitions seem to be\r\n           A kind of pictured melody,\r\n               And not a set contour.\r\n                                      \xe2\x80\x98AE. M.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nA strange expression had overspread Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s countenance. It rapidly\r\nincreased to the most death-like anguish. She flung down the paper,\r\nseized Owen\xe2\x80\x99s hand tremblingly, and covered her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cytherea! What is it, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Owen--suppose--O, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I think.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d_The light of azure eyes_,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 she repeated with ashy lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, \xe2\x80\x9cthe light of azure eyes\xe2\x80\x9d?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, astounded at her manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Morris said in her letter to me that her eyes are _black_!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98H\xe2\x80\x99m. Mrs. Morris must have made a mistake--nothing likelier.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They might be either in this photograph,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen, looking at the\r\ncard bearing Mrs. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Blue eyes would scarcely photograph so deep in tone as that,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nCytherea. \xe2\x80\x98No, they seem black here, certainly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, then, Manston must have blundered in writing his verses.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But could he? Say a man in love may forget his own name, but not that\r\nhe forgets the colour of his mistress\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Besides she would have\r\nseen the mistake when she read them, and have had it corrected.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s true, she would,\xe2\x80\x99 mused Owen. \xe2\x80\x98Then, Cytherea, it comes to\r\nthis--you must have been misinformed by Mrs. Morris, since there is no\r\nother alternative.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose I must.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer looks belied her words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What makes you so strange--ill?\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe Mrs. Morris wrong.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But look at this, Cytherea. If it is clear to us that the woman had\r\nblue eyes two years ago, she _must_ have blue eyes now, whatever Mrs.\r\nMorris or anybody else may fancy. Any one would think that Manston could\r\nchange the colour of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes to hear you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, and paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You say yes, as if he could,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By changing the woman herself,\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x98Owen, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see\r\nthe horrid--what I dread?--that the woman he lives with is not Mrs.\r\nManston--that she was burnt after all--and that I am _his wife_!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe tried to support a stoicism under the weight of this new trouble,\r\nbut no! The unexpected revulsion of ideas was so overwhelming that she\r\ncrept to him and leant against his breast.\r\n\r\nBefore reflecting any further upon the subject Graye led her upstairs\r\nand got her to lie down. Then he went to the window and stared out of\r\nit up the lane, vainly endeavouring to come to some conclusion upon\r\nthe fantastic enigma that confronted him. Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s new view seemed\r\nincredible, yet it had such a hold upon her that it would be necessary\r\nto clear it away by positive proof before contemplation of her fear\r\nshould have preyed too deeply upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cytherea,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98this will not do. You must stay here alone all the\r\nafternoon whilst I go to Carriford. I shall know all when I return.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, don\xe2\x80\x99t go!\xe2\x80\x99 she implored.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Soon, then, not directly.\xe2\x80\x99 He saw her subtle reasoning--that it was\r\nfolly to be wise.\r\n\r\nReflection still convinced him that good would come of persevering\r\nin his intention and dispelling his sister\xe2\x80\x99s idle fears. Anything was\r\nbetter than this absurd doubt in her mind. But he resolved to wait till\r\nSunday, the first day on which he might reckon upon seeing Mrs. Manston\r\nwithout suspicion. In the meantime he wrote to Edward Springrove,\r\nrequesting him to go again to Mrs. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s former lodgings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII. THE EVENTS OF THREE DAYS\r\n\r\n1. MARCH THE EIGHTEENTH\r\n\r\nSunday morning had come, and Owen was trudging over the six miles of\r\nhill and dale that lay between Tolchurch and Carriford.\r\n\r\nEdward Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s answer to the last letter, after expressing his\r\namazement at the strange contradiction between the verses and Mrs.\r\nMorris\xe2\x80\x99s letter, had been to the effect that he had again visited the\r\nneighbour of the dead Mr. Brown, and had received as near a description\r\nof Mrs. Manston as it was possible to get at second-hand, and by\r\nhearsay. She was a tall woman, wide at the shoulders, and full-chested,\r\nand she had a straight and rather large nose. The colour of her eyes the\r\ninformant did not know, for she had only seen the lady in the street\r\nas she went in or out. This confusing remark was added. The woman had\r\nalmost recognized Mrs. Manston when she had called with her husband\r\nlately, but she had kept her veil down. Her residence, before she came\r\nto Hoxton, was quite unknown to this next-door neighbour, and Edward\r\ncould get no manner of clue to it from any other source.\r\n\r\nOwen reached the church-door a few minutes before the bells began\r\nchiming. Nobody was yet in the church, and he walked round the aisles.\r\nFrom Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s frequent description of how and where herself and others\r\nused to sit, he knew where to look for Manston\xe2\x80\x99s seat; and after two\r\nor three errors of examination he took up a prayer-book in which was\r\nwritten \xe2\x80\x98Eunice Manston.\xe2\x80\x99 The book was nearly new, and the date of the\r\nwriting about a month earlier. One point was at any rate established:\r\nthat the woman living with Manston was presented to the world as no\r\nother than his lawful wife.\r\n\r\nThe quiet villagers of Carriford required no pew-opener in their place\r\nof worship: natives and in-dwellers had their own seats, and strangers\r\nsat where they could. Graye took a seat in the nave, on the north\r\nside, close behind a pillar dividing it from the north aisle, which was\r\ncompletely allotted to Miss Aldclyffe, her farmers, and her retainers,\r\nManston\xe2\x80\x99s pew being in the midst of them. Owen\xe2\x80\x99s position on the other\r\nside of the passage was a little in advance of Manston\xe2\x80\x99s seat, and so\r\nsituated that by leaning forward he could look directly into the face\r\nof any person sitting there, though, if he sat upright, he was wholly\r\nhidden from such a one by the intervening pillar.\r\n\r\nAiming to keep his presence unknown to Manston if possible, Owen sat,\r\nwithout once turning his head, during the entrance of the congregation.\r\nA rustling of silk round by the north passage and into Manston\xe2\x80\x99s seat,\r\ntold him that some woman had entered there, and as it seemed from the\r\naccompaniment of heavier footsteps, Manston was with her.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon rising up, he looked intently in that direction, and\r\nsaw a lady standing at the end of the seat nearest himself. Portions of\r\nManston\xe2\x80\x99s figure appeared on the other side of her. In two glances Graye\r\nread thus many of her characteristics, and in the following order:--\r\n\r\nShe was a tall woman.\r\n\r\nShe was broad at the shoulders.\r\n\r\nShe was full-bosomed.\r\n\r\nShe was easily recognizable from the photograph but nothing could be\r\ndiscerned of the colour of her eyes.\r\n\r\nWith a preoccupied mind he withdrew into his nook, and heard the\r\nservice continued--only conscious of the fact that in opposition to the\r\nsuspicion which one odd circumstance had bred in his sister concerning\r\nthis woman, all ostensible and ordinary proofs and probabilities tended\r\nto the opposite conclusion. There sat the genuine original of the\r\nportrait--could he wish for more? Cytherea wished for more. Eunice\r\nManston\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were blue, and it was necessary that this woman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\nshould be blue also.\r\n\r\nUnskilled labour wastes in beating against the bars ten times the energy\r\nexerted by the practised hand in the effective direction. Owen felt this\r\nto be the case in his own and Edward\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to follow up the clue\r\nafforded them. Think as he might, he could not think of a crucial test\r\nin the matter absorbing him, which should possess the indispensable\r\nattribute--a capability of being applied privately; that in the event of\r\nits proving the lady to be the rightful owner of the name she used, he\r\nmight recede without obloquy from an untenable position.\r\n\r\nBut to see Mrs. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s eyes from where he sat was impossible, and he\r\ncould do nothing in the shape of a direct examination at present. Miss\r\nAldclyffe had possibly recognized him, but Manston had not, and feeling\r\nthat it was indispensable to keep the purport of his visit a secret from\r\nthe steward, he thought it would be as well, too, to keep his presence\r\nin the village a secret from him; at any rate, till the day was over.\r\n\r\nAt the first opening of the doors, Graye left the church and wandered\r\naway into the fields to ponder on another scheme. He could not call\r\non Farmer Springrove, as he had intended, until this matter was set at\r\nrest. Two hours intervened between the morning and afternoon services.\r\n\r\nThis time had nearly expired before Owen had struck out any method of\r\nproceeding, or could decide to run the risk of calling at the Old House\r\nand asking to see Mrs. Manston point-blank. But he had drawn near the\r\nplace, and was standing still in the public path, from which a partial\r\nview of the front of the building could be obtained, when the bells\r\nbegan chiming for afternoon service. Whilst Graye paused, two persons\r\ncame from the front door of the half-hidden dwelling whom he presently\r\nsaw to be Manston and his wife. Manston was wearing his old garden-hat,\r\nand carried one of the monthly magazines under his arm. Immediately\r\nthey had passed the gateway he branched off and went over the hill in a\r\ndirection away from the church, evidently intending to ramble along,\r\nand read as the humour moved him. The lady meanwhile turned in the other\r\ndirection, and went into the church path.\r\n\r\nOwen resolved to make something of this opportunity. He hurried along\r\ntowards the church, doubled round a sharp angle, and came back upon the\r\nother path, by which Mrs. Manston must arrive.\r\n\r\nIn about three minutes she appeared in sight without a veil. He\r\ndiscovered, as she drew nearer, a difficulty which had not struck him\r\nat first--that it is not an easy matter to particularize the colour of\r\na stranger\xe2\x80\x99s eyes in a merely casual encounter on a path out of doors.\r\nThat Mrs. Manston must be brought close to him, and not only so, but to\r\nlook closely at him, if his purpose were to be accomplished.\r\n\r\nHe shaped a plan. It might by chance be effectual; if otherwise, it\r\nwould not reveal his intention to her. When Mrs. Manston was within\r\nspeaking distance, he went up to her and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you kindly tell me which turning will take me to Casterbridge?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The second on the right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Manston.\r\n\r\nOwen put on a blank look: he held his hand to his ear--conveying to the\r\nlady the idea that he was deaf.\r\n\r\nShe came closer and said more distinctly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The second turning on the right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOwen flushed a little. He fancied he had beheld the revelation he was in\r\nsearch of. But had his eyes deceived him?\r\n\r\nOnce more he used the ruse, still drawing nearer and intimating by a\r\nglance that the trouble he gave her was very distressing to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How very deaf!\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured. She exclaimed loudly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_The second turning to the right_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had advanced her face to within a foot of his own, and in speaking\r\nmouthed very emphatically, fixing her eyes intently upon his. And now\r\nhis first suspicion was indubitably confirmed. Her eyes were as black as\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\nAll this feigning was most distasteful to Graye. The riddle having\r\nbeen solved, he unconsciously assumed his natural look before she had\r\nwithdrawn her face. She found him to be peering at her as if he would\r\nread her very soul--expressing with his eyes the notification of which,\r\napart from emotion, the eyes are more capable than any other--inquiry.\r\n\r\nHer face changed its expression--then its colour. The natural tint of\r\nthe lighter portions sank to an ashy gray; the pink of her cheeks grew\r\npurpler. It was the precise result which would remain after blood had\r\nleft the face of one whose skin was dark, and artificially coated with\r\npearl-powder and carmine.\r\n\r\nShe turned her head and moved away, murmuring a hasty reply to Owen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfarewell remark of \xe2\x80\x98Good-day,\xe2\x80\x99 and with a kind of nervous twitch lifting\r\nher hand and smoothing her hair, which was of a light-brown colour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She wears false hair,\xe2\x80\x99 he thought, \xe2\x80\x98or has changed its colour\r\nartificially. Her true hair matched her eyes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd now, in spite of what Mr. Brown\xe2\x80\x99s neighbours had said about nearly\r\nrecognizing Mrs. Manston on her recent visit--which might have meant\r\nanything or nothing; in spite of the photograph, and in spite of his\r\nprevious incredulity; in consequence of the verse, of her silence and\r\nbackwardness at the visit to Hoxton with Manston, and of her appearance\r\nand distress at the present moment, Graye had a conviction that the\r\nwoman was an impostor.\r\n\r\nWhat could be Manston\xe2\x80\x99s reason for such an astounding trick he could by\r\nno stretch of imagination divine.\r\n\r\nHe changed his direction as soon as the woman was out of sight, and\r\nplodded along the lanes homeward to Tolchurch.\r\n\r\nOne new idea was suggested to him by his desire to allay Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndread of being claimed, and by the difficulty of believing that the\r\nfirst Mrs. Manston lost her life as supposed, notwithstanding the\r\ninquest and verdict. Was it possible that the real Mrs. Manston, who\r\nwas known to be a Philadelphian by birth, had returned by the train\r\nto London, as the porter had said, and then left the country under an\r\nassumed name, to escape that worst kind of widowhood--the misery of\r\nbeing wedded to a fickle, faithless, and truant husband?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn her complicated distress at the news brought by her brother,\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts at length reverted to her friend, the Rector of\r\nCarriford. She told Owen of Mr. Raunham\xe2\x80\x99s warm-hearted behaviour towards\r\nherself, and of his strongly expressed wish to aid her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is not only a good, but a sensible man. We seem to want an old head\r\non our side.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And he is a magistrate,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen in a tone of concurrence. He\r\nthought, too, that no harm could come of confiding in the rector, but\r\nthere was a difficulty in bringing about the confidence. He wished that\r\nhis sister and himself might both be present at an interview with Mr.\r\nRaunham, yet it would be unwise for them to call on him together, in the\r\nsight of all the servants and parish of Carriford.\r\n\r\nThere could be no objection to their writing him a letter.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the thought born than it was carried out. They wrote to\r\nhim at once, asking him to have the goodness to give them some advice\r\nthey sadly needed, and begging that he would accept their assurance\r\nthat there was a real justification for the additional request they\r\nmade--that instead of their calling upon him, he would any evening of\r\nthe week come to their cottage at Tolchurch.\r\n\r\n2. MARCH THE TWENTIETH. SIX TO NINE O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK P.M.\r\n\r\nTwo evenings later, to the total disarrangement of his dinner-hour, Mr.\r\nRaunham appeared at Owen\xe2\x80\x99s door. His arrival was hailed with genuine\r\ngratitude. The horse was tied to the palings, and the rector ushered\r\nindoors and put into the easy-chair.\r\n\r\nThen Graye told him the whole story, reminding him that their first\r\nsuspicions had been of a totally different nature, and that in\r\nendeavouring to obtain proof of their truth they had stumbled upon\r\nmarks which had surprised them into these new uncertainties, thrice as\r\nmarvellous as the first, yet more prominent.\r\n\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s heart was so full of anxiety that it superinduced a manner of\r\nconfidence which was a death-blow to all formality. Mr. Raunham took her\r\nhand pityingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a serious charge,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, as a sort of original twig on which\r\nhis thoughts might precipitate themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Assuming for a moment that such a substitution was rendered an easy\r\nmatter by fortuitous events,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, \xe2\x80\x98there is this consideration\r\nto be placed beside it--what earthly motive can Mr. Manston have had\r\nwhich would be sufficiently powerful to lead him to run such a very\r\ngreat risk? The most abandoned roue could not, at that particular\r\ncrisis, have taken such a reckless step for the mere pleasure of a new\r\ncompanion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOwen had seen that difficulty about the motive; Cytherea had not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unfortunately for us,\xe2\x80\x99 the rector resumed, \xe2\x80\x98no more evidence is to be\r\nobtained from the porter, Chinney. I suppose you know what became of\r\nhim? He got to Liverpool and embarked, intending to work his way to\r\nAmerica, but on the passage he fell overboard and was drowned. But there\r\nis no doubt of the truth of his confession--in fact, his conduct tends\r\nto prove it true--and no moral doubt of the fact that the real Mrs.\r\nManston left here to go back by that morning\xe2\x80\x99s train. This being the\r\ncase, then, why, if this woman is not she, did she take no notice of the\r\nadvertisement--I mean not necessarily a friendly notice, but from the\r\ninformation it afforded her have rendered it impossible that she should\r\nbe personified without her own connivance?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think that argument is overthrown,\xe2\x80\x99 Graye said, \xe2\x80\x98by my earliest\r\nassumption of her hatred of him, weariness of the chain which bound her\r\nto him, and a resolve to begin the world anew. Let\xe2\x80\x99s suppose she has\r\nmarried another man--somewhere abroad, say; she would be silent for her\r\nown sake.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve hit the only genuine possibility,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Raunham, tapping\r\nhis finger upon his knee. \xe2\x80\x98That would decidedly dispose of the second\r\ndifficulty. But his motive would be as mysterious as ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s pictured dreads would not allow her mind to follow their\r\nconversation. \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s burnt,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98O yes; I fear--I fear she is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we can seriously believe that now, after what has\r\nhappened,\xe2\x80\x99 said the rector.\r\n\r\nStill straining her thought towards the worst, \xe2\x80\x98Then, perhaps, the first\r\nMrs. Manston was not his wife,\xe2\x80\x99 she returned; \xe2\x80\x98and then I should be his\r\nwife just the same, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They were married safely enough,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen. \xe2\x80\x98There is abundance of\r\ncircumstantial evidence to prove that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon the whole,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Raunham, \xe2\x80\x98I should advise your asking in a\r\nstraightforward way for legal proof from the steward that the present\r\nwoman is really his original wife--a thing which, to my mind, you should\r\nhave done at the outset.\xe2\x80\x99 He turned to Cytherea kindly, and asked her\r\nwhat made her give up her husband so unceremoniously.\r\n\r\nShe could not tell the rector of her aversion to Manston, and of her\r\nunquenched love for Edward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your terrified state no doubt,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, answering for her, in the\r\nmanner of those accustomed to the pulpit. \xe2\x80\x98But into such a solemn\r\ncompact as marriage, all-important considerations, both legally and\r\nmorally, enter; it was your duty to have seen everything clearly proved.\r\nDoubtless Mr. Manston is prepared with proofs, but as it concerns nobody\r\nbut yourself that her identity should be publicly established (and by\r\nyour absenteeism you act as if you were satisfied) he has not troubled\r\nto exhibit them. Nobody else has taken the trouble to prove what does\r\nnot affect them in the least--that\xe2\x80\x99s the way of the world always. You,\r\nwho should have required all things to be made clear, ran away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That was partly my doing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Owen.\r\n\r\nThe same explanation--her want of love for Manston--applied here too,\r\nbut she shunned the revelation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 added the rector, \xe2\x80\x98it was all the greater credit to\r\nyour womanhood, perhaps. I say, then, get your brother to write a line\r\nto Mr. Manston, saying you wish to be satisfied that all is legally\r\nclear (in case you should want to marry again, for instance), and I have\r\nno doubt that you will be. Or, if you would rather, I\xe2\x80\x99ll write myself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no, sir, no,\xe2\x80\x99 pleaded Cytherea, beginning to blanch, and breathing\r\nquickly. \xe2\x80\x98Please don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything. Let me live here with Owen. I am so\r\nafraid it will turn out that I shall have to go to Knapwater and be his\r\nwife, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go. Do conceal what we have told you. Let him\r\ncontinue his deception--it is much the best for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Raunham at length divined that her love for Manston, if it had ever\r\nexisted, had transmuted itself into a very different feeling now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At any rate,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, as he took his leave and mounted his mare, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwill see about it. Rest content, Miss Graye, and depend upon it that I\r\nwill not lead you into difficulty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Conceal it,\xe2\x80\x99 she still pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll see--but of course I must do my duty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--don\xe2\x80\x99t do your duty!\xe2\x80\x99 She looked up at him through the gloom,\r\nilluminating her own face and eyes with the candle she held.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will consider, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Raunham, sensibly moved. He turned his\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x99s head, bade them a warm adieu, and left the door.\r\n\r\nThe rector of Carriford trotted homewards under the cold and clear\r\nMarch sky, its countless stars fluttering like bright birds. He was\r\nunconscious of the scene. Recovering from the effect of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nand glance of entreaty, he laid the subject of the interview clearly\r\nbefore himself.\r\n\r\nThe suspicions of Cytherea and Owen were honest, and had\r\nfoundation--that he must own. Was he--a clergyman, magistrate, and\r\nconscientious man--justified in yielding to Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s importunities\r\nto keep silence, because she dreaded the possibility of a return to\r\nManston? Was she wise in her request? Holding her present belief, and\r\nwith no definite evidence either way, she could, for one thing, never\r\nconscientiously marry any one else. Suppose that Cytherea were Manston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife--i.e., that the first wife was really burnt? The adultery of\r\nManston would be proved, and, Mr. Raunham thought, cruelty sufficient to\r\nbring the case within the meaning of the statute. Suppose the new woman\r\nwas, as stated, Mr. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s restored wife? Cytherea was perfectly safe\r\nas a single woman whose marriage had been void. And if it turned out\r\nthat, though this woman was not Manston\xe2\x80\x99s wife, his wife was still\r\nliving, as Owen had suggested, in America or elsewhere, Cytherea was\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nThe first supposition opened up the worst contingency. Was she really\r\nsafe as Manston\xe2\x80\x99s wife? Doubtful. But, however that might be, the\r\ngentle, defenceless girl, whom it seemed nobody\xe2\x80\x99s business to help or\r\ndefend, should be put in a track to proceed against this man. She had\r\nbut one life, and the superciliousness with which all the world now\r\nregarded her should be compensated in some measure by the man whose\r\ncarelessness--to set him in the best light--had caused it.\r\n\r\nMr. Raunham felt more and more positively that his duty must be done. An\r\ninquiry must be made into the matter. Immediately on reaching home,\r\nhe sat down and wrote a plain and friendly letter to Mr. Manston, and\r\ndespatched it at once to him by hand. Then he flung himself back in\r\nhis chair, and went on with his meditation. Was there anything in the\r\nsuspicion? There could be nothing, surely. Nothing is done by a clever\r\nman without a motive, and what conceivable motive could Manston have for\r\nsuch abnormal conduct? Corinthian that he might be, who had preyed on\r\nvirginity like St. George\xe2\x80\x99s dragon, he would never have been absurd\r\nenough to venture on such a course for the possession alone of the\r\nwoman--there was no reason for it--she was inferior to Cytherea in every\r\nrespect, physical and mental.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it seemed rather odd, when he analyzed the action,\r\nthat a woman who deliberately hid herself from her husband for more than\r\na twelvemonth should be brought back by a mere advertisement. In fact,\r\nthe whole business had worked almost too smoothly and effectually\r\nfor unpremeditated sequence. It was too much like the indiscriminate\r\nrighting of everything at the end of an old play. And there was that\r\ncurious business of the keys and watch. Her way of accounting for their\r\nbeing left behind by forgetfulness had always seemed to him rather\r\nforced. The only unforced explanation was that suggested by the\r\nnewspaper writers--that she left them behind on purpose to blind people\r\nas to her escape, a motive which would have clashed with the possibility\r\nof her being fished back by an advertisement, as the present woman had\r\nbeen. Again, there were the two charred bones. He shuffled the books and\r\npapers in his study, and walked about the room, restlessly musing on the\r\nsame subject. The parlour-maid entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can young Mr. Springrove from London see you to-night, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Young Mr. Springrove?\xe2\x80\x99 said the rector, surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, of course he can see me. Tell him to come in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEdward came so impatiently into the room, as to show that the few short\r\nmoments his announcement had occupied had been irksome to him. He stood\r\nin the doorway with the same black bag in his hand, and the same old\r\ngray cloak on his shoulders, that he had worn fifteen months earlier\r\nwhen returning on the night of the fire. This appearance of his conveyed\r\na true impression; he had become a stagnant man. But he was excited now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have this moment come from London,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, as the door was closed\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nThe prophetic insight, which so strangely accompanies critical\r\nexperiences, prompted Mr. Raunham\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98About the Grayes and Manston?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. That woman is not Mrs. Manston.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Prove it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can prove that she is somebody else--that her name is Anne Seaway.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And are their suspicions true indeed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I can do what\xe2\x80\x99s more to the purpose at present.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suggest Manston\xe2\x80\x99s motive?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only suggest it, remember. But my assumption fits so perfectly with the\r\nfacts that have been secretly unearthed and conveyed to me, that I can\r\nhardly conceive of another.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was in Edward\xe2\x80\x99s bearing that entire unconsciousness of himself\r\nwhich, natural to wild animals, only prevails in a sensitive man at\r\nmoments of extreme intentness. The rector saw that he had no trivial\r\nstory to communicate, whatever the story was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sit down,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Raunham. \xe2\x80\x98My mind has been on the stretch all the\r\nevening to form the slightest guess at such an object, and all to no\r\npurpose--entirely to no purpose. Have you said anything to Owen Graye?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing--nor to anybody. I could not trust to the effect a letter might\r\nhave upon yourself, either; the intricacy of the case brings me to this\r\ninterview.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhilst Springrove had been speaking the two had sat down together. The\r\nconversation, hitherto distinct to every corner of the room, was carried\r\non now in tones so low as to be scarcely audible to the interlocutors,\r\nand in phrases which hesitated to complete themselves. Three-quarters\r\nof an hour passed. Then Edward arose, came out of the rector\xe2\x80\x99s study and\r\nagain flung his cloak around him. Instead of going thence homeward,\r\nhe went first to the Carriford Road Station with a telegram, having\r\ndespatched which he proceeded to his father\xe2\x80\x99s house for the first time\r\nsince his arrival in the village.\r\n\r\n3. FROM NINE TO TEN O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK P.M.\r\n\r\nThe next presentation is the interior of the Old House on the evening of\r\nthe preceding section. The steward was sitting by his parlour fire, and\r\nhad been reading the letter arrived from the rectory. Opposite to him\r\nsat the woman known to the village and neighbourhood as Mrs. Manston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Things are looking desperate with us,\xe2\x80\x99 he said gloomily. His gloom was\r\nnot that of the hypochondriac, but the legitimate gloom which has its\r\norigin in a syllogism. As he uttered the words he handed the letter to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I almost expected some such news as this,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied, in a tone of\r\nmuch greater indifference. \xe2\x80\x98I knew suspicion lurked in the eyes of that\r\nyoung man who stared at me so in the church path: I could have sworn\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nManston did not answer for some time. His face was worn and haggard;\r\nlatterly his head had not been carried so uprightly as of old. \xe2\x80\x98If they\r\nprove you to be--who you are.... Yes, if they do,\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They must not find that out,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, in a positive voice, and\r\nlooking at him. \xe2\x80\x98But supposing they do, the trick does not seem to me to\r\nbe so serious as to justify that wretched, miserable, horrible look of\r\nyours. It makes my flesh creep; it is perfectly deathlike.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe did not reply, and she continued, \xe2\x80\x98If they say and prove that Eunice\r\nis indeed living--and dear, you know she is--she is sure to come back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis remark seemed to awaken and irritate him to speech. Again, as he\r\nhad done a hundred times during their residence together, he categorized\r\nthe events connected with the fire at the Three Tranters. He dwelt on\r\nevery incident of that night\xe2\x80\x99s history, and endeavoured, with an anxiety\r\nwhich was extraordinary in the apparent circumstances, to prove that his\r\nwife must, by the very nature of things, have perished in the flames.\r\nShe arose from her seat, crossed the hearthrug, and set herself to\r\nsoothe him; then she whispered that she was still as unbelieving as\r\never. \xe2\x80\x98Come, supposing she escaped--just supposing she escaped--where is\r\nshe?\xe2\x80\x99 coaxed the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why are you so curious continually?\xe2\x80\x99 said Manston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I am a woman and want to know. Now where is she?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the Flying Isle of San Borandan.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Witty cruelty is the cruellest of any. Ah, well--if she is in England,\r\nshe will come back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is not in England.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But she will come back?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, she won\xe2\x80\x99t.... Come, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, arousing himself, \xe2\x80\x98I shall not\r\nanswer any more questions.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--ah--ah--she is not dead,\xe2\x80\x99 the woman murmured again poutingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, love.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She was burnt, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now to please me, admit the bare possibility of her being alive--just\r\nthe possibility.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes--to please you I will admit that,\xe2\x80\x99 he said quickly. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I admit\r\nthe possibility of her being alive, to please you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked at him in utter perplexity. The words could only have been\r\nsaid in jest, and yet they seemed to savour of a tone the furthest\r\nremove from jesting. There was his face plain to her eyes, but no\r\ninformation of any kind was to be read there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is only natural that I should be curious,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured pettishly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98if I resemble her as much as you say I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are handsomer,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98though you are about her own height and\r\nsize. But don\xe2\x80\x99t worry yourself. You must know that you are body and soul\r\nunited with me, though you are but my housekeeper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe bridled a little at the remark. \xe2\x80\x98Wife,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98most certainly\r\nwife, since you cannot dismiss me without losing your character and\r\nposition, and incurring heavy penalties.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I own it--it was well said, though mistakenly--very mistakenly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t riddle to me about mistakenly and such dark things. Now what was\r\nyour motive, dearest, in running the risk of having me here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your beauty,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She thanks you much for the compliment, but will not take it. Come,\r\nwhat was your motive?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your wit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no; not my wit. Wit would have made a wife of me by this time\r\ninstead of what I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your virtue.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or virtue either.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you it was your beauty--really.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I cannot help seeing and hearing, and if what people say is true, I\r\nam not nearly so good-looking as Cytherea, and several years older.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe aspect of Manston\xe2\x80\x99s face at these words from her was so confirmatory\r\nof her hint, that his forced reply of \xe2\x80\x98O no,\xe2\x80\x99 tended to develop her\r\nchagrin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mere liking or love for me,\xe2\x80\x99 she resumed, \xe2\x80\x98would not have sprung up\r\nall of a sudden, as your pretended passion did. You had been to London\r\nseveral times between the time of the fire and your marriage with\r\nCytherea--you had never visited me or thought of my existence or cared\r\nthat I was out of a situation and poor. But the week after you married\r\nher and were separated from her, off you rush to make love to me--not\r\nfirst to me either, for you went to several places--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, not several places.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, you told me so yourself--that you went first to the only lodging\r\nin which your wife had been known as Mrs. Manston, and when you found\r\nthat the lodging-house-keeper had gone away and died, and that nobody\r\nelse in the street had any definite ideas as to your wife\xe2\x80\x99s personal\r\nappearance, and came and proposed the arrangement we carried out--that I\r\nshould personate her. Your taking all this trouble shows that something\r\nmore serious than love had to do with the matter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Humbug--what trouble after all did I take? When I found Cytherea would\r\nnot stay with me after the wedding I was much put out at being left\r\nalone again. Was that unnatural?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And those favouring accidents you mention--that nobody knew my first\r\nwife--seemed an arrangement of Providence for our mutual benefit, and\r\nmerely perfected a half-formed impulse--that I should call you my first\r\nwife to escape the scandal that would have arisen if you had come here\r\nas anything else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My love, that story won\xe2\x80\x99t do. If Mrs. Manston was burnt, Cytherea, whom\r\nyou love better than me, could have been compelled to live with you as\r\nyour lawful wife. If she was not burnt, why should you run the risk of\r\nher turning up again at any moment and exposing your substitution of me,\r\nand ruining your name and prospects?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why--because I might have loved you well enough to run the risk\r\n(assuming her not to be burnt, which I deny).\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--you would have run the risk the other way. You would rather have\r\nrisked her finding you with Cytherea as a second wife, than with me as a\r\npersonator of herself--the first one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You came easiest to hand--remember that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not so very easy either, considering the labour you took to teach\r\nme your first wife\xe2\x80\x99s history. All about how she was a native of\r\nPhiladelphia. Then making me read up the guide-book to Philadelphia, and\r\ndetails of American life and manners, in case the birthplace and\r\nhistory of your wife, Eunice, should ever become known in this\r\nneighbourhood--unlikely as it was. Ah! and then about the handwriting of\r\nhers that I had to imitate, and the dying my hair, and rouging, to make\r\nthe transformation complete? You mean to say that that was taking less\r\ntrouble than there would have been in arranging events to make Cytherea\r\nbelieve herself your wife, and live with you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were a needy adventuress, who would dare anything for a new\r\npleasure and an easy life--and I was fool enough to give in to you--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good heavens above!--did I ask you to insert those advertisements for\r\nyour old wife, and to make me answer it as if I was she? Did I ask you\r\nto send me the letter for me to copy and send back to you when the third\r\nadvertisement appeared--purporting to come from the long-lost wife, and\r\ngiving a detailed history of her escape and subsequent life--all which\r\nyou had invented yourself? You deluded me into loving you, and then\r\nenticed me here! Ah, and this is another thing. How did you know the\r\nreal wife wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer it, and upset all your plans?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I knew she was burnt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you force Cytherea to come back, then? Now, my love, I have\r\ncaught you, and you may just as well tell first as last, _what was your\r\nmotive in having me here as your first wife_?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Silence!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe was silent for the space of two minutes, and then persisted in going\r\non to mutter, \xe2\x80\x98And why was it that Miss Aldclyffe allowed her favourite\r\nyoung lady, Cythie, to be overthrown and supplanted without an\r\nexpostulation or any show of sympathy? Do you know I often think you\r\nexercise a secret power over Miss Aldclyffe. And she always shuns me as\r\nif I shared the power. A poor, ill-used creature like me sharing power,\r\nindeed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She thinks you are Mrs. Manston.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make her avoid me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes it would,\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed impatiently. \xe2\x80\x98I wish I was dead--dead!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHe had jumped up from his seat in uttering the words, and now walked\r\nwearily to the end of the room. Coming back more decisively, he looked\r\nin her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must leave this place if Raunham suspects what I think he does,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x98The request of Cytherea and her brother may simply be for\r\na satisfactory proof, to make her feel legally free--but it may mean\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What may it mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How should I know?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well, never mind, old boy,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, approaching him to make up\r\nthe quarrel. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be so alarmed--anybody would think that you were the\r\nwoman and I the man. Suppose they do find out what I am--we can go away\r\nfrom here and keep house as usual. People will say of you, \xe2\x80\x9cHis first\r\nwife was burnt to death\xe2\x80\x9d (or \xe2\x80\x9cran away to the Colonies,\xe2\x80\x9d as the case\r\nmay be); \xe2\x80\x9cHe married a second, and deserted her for Anne Seaway.\xe2\x80\x9d A very\r\neveryday case--nothing so horrible, after all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe made an impatient movement. \xe2\x80\x98Whichever way we do it, _nobody must\r\nknow that you are not my wife Eunice_. And now I must think about\r\narranging matters.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nManston then retired to his office, and shut himself up for the\r\nremainder of the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX. THE EVENTS OF A DAY AND NIGHT\r\n\r\n1. MARCH THE TWENTY-FIRST. MORNING\r\n\r\nNext morning the steward went out as usual. He shortly told his\r\ncompanion, Anne, that he had almost matured their scheme, and that\r\nthey would enter upon the details of it when he came home at night. The\r\nfortunate fact that the rector\xe2\x80\x99s letter did not require an immediate\r\nanswer would give him time to consider.\r\n\r\nAnne Seaway then began her duties in the house. Besides daily\r\nsuperintending the cook and housemaid one of these duties was, at rare\r\nintervals, to dust Manston\xe2\x80\x99s office with her own hands, a servant being\r\nsupposed to disturb the books and papers unnecessarily. She softly\r\nwandered from table to shelf with the duster in her hand, afterwards\r\nstanding in the middle of the room, and glancing around to discover if\r\nany noteworthy collection of dust had still escaped her.\r\n\r\nHer eye fell upon a faint layer which rested upon the ledge of an\r\nold-fashioned chestnut cabinet of French Renaissance workmanship, placed\r\nin a recess by the fireplace. At a height of about four feet from the\r\nfloor the upper portion of the front receded, forming the ledge alluded\r\nto, on which opened at each end two small doors, the centre space\r\nbetween them being filled out by a panel of similar size, making the\r\nthird of three squares. The dust on the ledge was nearly on a level with\r\nthe woman\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and, though insignificant in quantity, showed itself\r\ndistinctly on account of this obliquity of vision. Now opposite the\r\ncentral panel, concentric quarter-circles were traced in the deposited\r\nfilm, expressing to her that this panel, too, was a door like the\r\nothers; that it had lately been opened, and had skimmed the dust with\r\nits lower edge.\r\n\r\nAt last, then, her curiosity was slightly rewarded. For the right of the\r\nmatter was that Anne had been incited to this exploration of Manston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffice rather by a wish to know the reason of his long seclusion\r\nhere, after the arrival of the rector\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and their subsequent\r\ndiscourse, than by any immediate desire for cleanliness. Still, there\r\nwould have been nothing remarkable to Anne in this sight but for one\r\nrecollection. Manston had once casually told her that each of the two\r\nside-lockers included half the middle space, the panel of which did\r\nnot open, and was only put in for symmetry. It was possible that he had\r\nopened this compartment by candlelight the preceding night, or he would\r\nhave seen the marks in the dust, and effaced them, that he might not\r\nbe proved guilty of telling her an untruth. She balanced herself on one\r\nfoot and stood pondering. She considered that it was very vexing and\r\nunfair in him to refuse her all knowledge of his remaining secrets,\r\nunder the peculiar circumstances of her connection with him. She went\r\nclose to the cabinet. As there was no keyhole, the door must be capable\r\nof being opened by the unassisted hand. The circles in the dust told her\r\nat which edge to apply her force. Here she pulled with the tips of her\r\nfingers, but the panel would not come forward. She fetched a chair and\r\nlooked over the top of the cabinet, but no bolt, knob, or spring was to\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, with indifference; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask him about it,\r\nand he will tell me.\xe2\x80\x99 Down she came and turned away. Then looking back\r\nagain she thought it was absurd such a trifle should puzzle her.\r\nShe retraced her steps, and opened a drawer beneath the ledge of the\r\ncabinet, pushing in her hand and feeling about on the underside of the\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nHere she found a small round sinking, and pressed her finger into it.\r\nNothing came of the pressure. She withdrew her hand and looked at the\r\ntip of her finger: it was marked with the impress of the circle, and, in\r\naddition, a line ran across it diametrically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How stupid of me; it is the head of a screw.\xe2\x80\x99 Whatever mysterious\r\ncontrivance had originally existed for opening the puny cupboard of\r\nthe cabinet, it had at some time been broken, and this rough substitute\r\nprovided. Stimulated curiosity would not allow her to recede now. She\r\nfetched a screwdriver, withdrew the screw, pulled the door open with a\r\npenknife, and found inside a cavity about ten inches square. The cavity\r\ncontained--\r\n\r\nLetters from different women, with unknown signatures, Christian names\r\nonly (surnames being despised in Paphos). Letters from his wife Eunice.\r\nLetters from Anne herself, including that she wrote in answer to his\r\nadvertisement. A small pocket-book. Sundry scraps of paper.\r\n\r\nThe letters from the strange women with pet names she glanced carelessly\r\nthrough, and then put them aside. They were too similar to her own\r\nregretted delusion, and curiosity requires contrast to excite it.\r\n\r\nThe letters from his wife were next examined. They were dated back as\r\nfar as Eunice\xe2\x80\x99s first meeting with Manston, and the early ones before\r\ntheir marriage contained the usual pretty effusions of women at such a\r\nperiod of their existence. Some little time after he had made her his\r\nwife, and when he had come to Knapwater, the series began again, and\r\nnow their contents arrested her attention more forcibly. She closed the\r\ncabinet, carried the letters into the parlour, reclined herself on the\r\nsofa, and carefully perused them in the order of their dates.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            \xe2\x80\x98JOHN STREET,\r\n                                                   October 17, 1864.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAREST HUSBAND,--I received your hurried line of yesterday, and was\r\nof course content with it. But why don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me your exact address\r\ninstead of that \xe2\x80\x9cPost-Office, Budmouth?\xe2\x80\x9d This matter is all a mystery to\r\nme, and I ought to be told every detail. I cannot fancy it is the same\r\nkind of occupation you have been used to hitherto. Your command that\r\nI am to stay here awhile until you can \xe2\x80\x9csee how things look\xe2\x80\x9d and can\r\narrange to send for me, I must necessarily abide by. But if, as you say,\r\na married man would have been rejected by the person who engaged you,\r\nand that hence my existence must be kept a secret until you have secured\r\nyour position, why did you think of going at all?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The truth is, this keeping our marriage a secret is troublesome,\r\nvexing, and wearisome to me. I see the poorest woman in the street\r\nbearing her husband\xe2\x80\x99s name openly--living with him in the most\r\nmatter-of-fact ease, and why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I? I wish I was back again in\r\nLiverpool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To-day I bought a grey waterproof cloak. I think it is a little too\r\nlong for me, but it was cheap for one of such a quality. The weather is\r\ngusty and dreary, and till this morning I had hardly set foot outside\r\nthe door since you left. Please do tell me when I am to come.--Very\r\naffectionately yours, EUNICE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             \xe2\x80\x98JOHN STREET,\r\n                                                    October 25, 1864.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAR HUSBAND,--Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you write? Do you hate me? I have not had\r\nthe heart to do anything this last week. That I, your wife, should be in\r\nthis strait, and my husband well to do! I have been obliged to leave my\r\nfirst lodging for debt--among other things, they charged me for a lot of\r\nbrandy which I am quite sure I did not taste. Then I went to Camberwell\r\nand was found out by them. I went away privately from thence, and\r\nchanged my name the second time. I am now Mrs. Rondley. But the new\r\nlodging was the wretchedest and dearest I ever set foot in, and I left\r\nit after being there only a day. I am now at No. 20 in the same street\r\nthat you left me in originally. All last night the sash of my window\r\nrattled so dreadfully that I could not sleep, but I had not energy\r\nenough to get out of bed to stop it. This morning I have been walking--I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how far--but far enough to make my feet ache. I have been\r\nlooking at the outside of two or three of the theatres, but they seem\r\nforbidding if I regard them with the eye of an actress in search of\r\nan engagement. Though you said I was to think no more of the stage,\r\nI believe you would not care if you found me there. But I am not an\r\nactress by nature, and art will never make me one. I am too timid and\r\nretiring; I was intended for a cottager\xe2\x80\x99s wife. I certainly shall not\r\ntry to go on the boards again whilst I am in this strange place. The\r\nidea of being brought on as far as London and then left here alone! Why\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t you leave me in Liverpool? Perhaps you thought I might have told\r\nsomebody that my real name was Mrs. Manston. As if I had a living friend\r\nto whom I could impart it--no such good fortune! In fact, my nearest\r\nfriend is no nearer than what most people would call a stranger. But\r\nperhaps I ought to tell you that a week before I wrote my last letter to\r\nyou, after wishing that my uncle and aunt in Philadelphia (the only near\r\nrelatives I had) were still alive, I suddenly resolved to send a line to\r\nmy cousin James, who, I believe, is still living in that neighbourhood.\r\nHe has never seen me since we were babies together. I did not tell him\r\nof my marriage, because I thought you might not like it, and I gave my\r\nreal maiden name, and an address at the post-office here. But God knows\r\nif the letter will ever reach him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do write me an answer, and send something.--Your affectionate wife,\r\nEUNICE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                \xe2\x80\x98FRIDAY, October 28.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAR HUSBAND,--The order for ten pounds has just come, and I am\r\ntruly glad to get it. But why will you write so bitterly? Ah--well, if\r\nI had only had the money I should have been on my way to America by this\r\ntime, so don\xe2\x80\x99t think I want to bore you of my own free-will. Who can\r\nyou have met with at that new place? Remember I say this in no malignant\r\ntone, but certainly the facts go to prove that you have deserted me!\r\nYou are inconstant--I know it. O, why are you so? Now I have lost you, I\r\nlove you in spite of your neglect. I am weakly fond--that\xe2\x80\x99s my nature.\r\nI fear that upon the whole my life has been wasted. I know there is\r\nanother woman supplanting me in your heart--yes, I know it. Come to\r\nme--do come. EUNICE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      \xe2\x80\x9841 CHARLES SQUARE, HOXTON,\r\n                                                   November 19.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98DEAR AENEAS,--Here I am back again after my visit. Why should you have\r\nbeen so enraged at my finding your exact address? Any woman would have\r\ntried to do it--you know she would have. And no woman would have lived\r\nunder assumed names so long as I did. I repeat that I did not call\r\nmyself Mrs. Manston until I came to this lodging at the beginning of\r\nthis month--what could you expect?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A helpless creature I, had not fortune favoured me unexpectedly.\r\nBanished as I was from your house at dawn, I did not suppose the\r\nindignity was about to lead to important results. But in crossing the\r\npark I overheard the conversation of a young man and woman who had also\r\nrisen early. I believe her to be the girl who has won you away from\r\nme. Well, their conversation concerned you and Miss Aldclyffe, _very\r\npeculiarly_. The remarkable thing is that you yourself, without knowing\r\nit, told me of what, added to their conversation, completely reveals a\r\nsecret to me that neither of you understand. Two negatives never made\r\nsuch a telling positive before. One clue more, and you would see it.\r\nA single consideration prevents my revealing it--just one doubt as to\r\nwhether your ignorance was real, and was not feigned to deceive me.\r\nCivility now, please. EUNICE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          \xe2\x80\x9841 CHARLES SQUARE,\r\n                                               Tuesday, November 22.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DARLING HUSBAND,--Monday will suit me excellently for coming. I have\r\nacted exactly up to your instructions, and have sold my rubbish at the\r\nbroker\xe2\x80\x99s in the next street. All this movement and bustle is delightful\r\nto me after the weeks of monotony I have endured. It is a relief to wish\r\nthe place good-bye--London always has seemed so much more foreign to\r\nme than Liverpool The mid-day train on Monday will do nicely for me. I\r\nshall be anxiously looking out for you on Sunday night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope so much that you are not angry with me for writing to Miss\r\nAldclyffe. You are not, dear, are you? Forgive me.--Your loving wife,\r\nEUNICE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the last of the letters from the wife to the husband. One\r\nother, in Mrs. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting, and in the same packet, was\r\ndifferently addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    \xe2\x80\x98THREE TRANTERS INN, CARRIFORD,\r\n                                                  November 28, 1864.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98DEAR COUSIN JAMES,--Thank you indeed for answering my letter so\r\npromptly. When I called at the post-office yesterday I did not in the\r\nleast think there would be one. But I must leave this subject. I write\r\nagain at once under the strangest and saddest conditions it is possible\r\nto conceive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not tell you in my last that I was a married woman. Don\xe2\x80\x99t blame\r\nme--it was my husband\xe2\x80\x99s influence. I hardly know where to begin my\r\nstory. I had been living apart from him for a time--then he sent for me\r\n(this was last week) and I was glad to go to him. Then this is what he\r\ndid. He promised to fetch me, and did not--leaving me to do the journey\r\nalone. He promised to meet me at the station here--he did not. I went on\r\nthrough the darkness to his house, and found his door locked and himself\r\naway from home. I have been obliged to come here, and I write to you in\r\na strange room in a strange village inn! I choose the present moment to\r\nwrite to drive away my misery. Sorrow seems a sort of pleasure when you\r\ndetail it on paper--poor pleasure though.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But this is what I want to know--and I am ashamed to tell it. I would\r\ngladly do as you say, and come to you as a housekeeper, but I have\r\nnot the money even for a steerage passage. James, do you want me badly\r\nenough--do you pity me enough to send it? I could manage to subsist in\r\nLondon upon the proceeds of my sale for another month or six weeks. Will\r\nyou send it to the same address at the post-office? But how do I know\r\nthat you...\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus the letter ended. From creases in the paper it was plain that the\r\nwriter, having got so far, had become dissatisfied with her production,\r\nand had crumpled it in her hand. Was it to write another, or not to\r\nwrite at all?\r\n\r\nThe next thing Anne Seaway perceived was that the fragmentary story she\r\nhad coaxed out of Manston, to the effect that his wife had left England\r\nfor America, might be truthful, according to two of these letters,\r\ncorroborated by the evidence of the railway-porter. And yet, at first,\r\nhe had sworn in a passion that his wife was most certainly consumed in\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\nIf she had been burnt, this letter, written in her bedroom, and probably\r\nthrust into her pocket when she relinquished it, would have been burnt\r\nwith her. Nothing was surer than that. Why, then, did he say she was\r\nburnt, and never show Anne herself this letter?\r\n\r\nThe question suddenly raised a new and much stranger one--kindling a\r\nburst of amazement in her. How did Manston become possessed of this\r\nletter?\r\n\r\nThat fact of possession was certainly the most remarkable revelation\r\nof all in connection with this epistle, and perhaps had something to do\r\nwith his reason for never showing it to her.\r\n\r\nShe knew by several proofs, that before his marriage with Cytherea, and\r\nup to the time of the porter\xe2\x80\x99s confession, Manston believed--honestly\r\nbelieved--that Cytherea would be his lawful wife, and hence, of course,\r\nthat his wife Eunice was dead. So that no communication could possibly\r\nhave passed between his wife and himself from the first moment that he\r\nbelieved her dead on the night of the fire, to the day of his wedding.\r\nAnd yet he had that letter. How soon afterwards could they have\r\ncommunicated with each other?\r\n\r\nThe existence of the letter--as much as, or more than its\r\ncontents--implying that Mrs. Manston was not burnt, his belief in that\r\ncalamity must have terminated at the moment he obtained possession of\r\nthe letter, if no earlier. Was, then, the only solution to the riddle\r\nthat Anne could discern, the true one?--that he had communicated with\r\nhis wife somewhere about the commencement of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s residence with him,\r\nor at any time since?\r\n\r\nIt was the most unlikely thing on earth that a woman who had forsaken\r\nher husband should countenance his scheme to personify her--whether she\r\nwere in America, in London, or in the neighbourhood of Knapwater.\r\n\r\nThen came the old and harassing question, what was Manston\xe2\x80\x99s real motive\r\nin risking his name on the deception he was practising as regarded Anne.\r\nIt could not be, as he had always pretended, mere passion. Her thoughts\r\nhad reverted to Mr. Raunham\xe2\x80\x99s letter, asking for proofs of her identity\r\nwith the original Mrs. Manston. She could see no loophole of escape\r\nfor the man who supported her. True, in her own estimation, his worst\r\nalternative was not so very bad after all--the getting the name of\r\nlibertine, a possible appearance in the divorce or some other court\r\nof law, and a question of damages. Such an exposure might hinder\r\nhis worldly progress for some time. Yet to him this alternative was,\r\napparently, terrible as death itself.\r\n\r\nShe restored the letters to their hiding-place, scanned anew the other\r\nletters and memoranda, from which she could gain no fresh information,\r\nfastened up the cabinet, and left everything in its former condition.\r\n\r\nHer mind was ill at ease. More than ever she wished that she had never\r\nseen Manston. Where the person suspected of mysterious moral obliquity\r\nis the possessor of great physical and intellectual attractions, the\r\nmere sense of incongruity adds an extra shudder to dread. The man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstrange bearing terrified Anne as it had terrified Cytherea; for with\r\nall the woman Anne\xe2\x80\x99s faults, she had not descended to such depths of\r\ndepravity as to willingly participate in crime. She had not even known\r\nthat a living wife was being displaced till her arrival at Knapwater put\r\nretreat out of the question, and had looked upon personation simply as\r\na mode of subsistence a degree better than toiling in poverty and alone,\r\nafter a bustling and somewhat pampered life as housekeeper in a gay\r\nmansion.\r\n\r\n              \xe2\x80\x98Non illa colo calathisve Minervae\r\n      Foemineas assueta manus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n2. AFTERNOON\r\n\r\nMr. Raunham and Edward Springrove had by this time set in motion a\r\nmachinery which they hoped to find working out important results.\r\n\r\nThe rector was restless and full of meditation all the following\r\nmorning. It was plain, even to the servants about him, that Springrove\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncommunication wore a deeper complexion than any that had been made to\r\nthe old magistrate for many months or years past. The fact was that,\r\nhaving arrived at the stage of existence in which the difficult\r\nintellectual feat of suspending one\xe2\x80\x99s judgment becomes possible, he was\r\nnow putting it in practice, though not without the penalty of watchful\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the afternoon that he determined to call on his\r\nrelative, Miss Aldclyffe, and cautiously probe her knowledge of the\r\nsubject occupying him so thoroughly. Cytherea, he knew, was still\r\nbeloved by this solitary woman. Miss Aldclyffe had made several private\r\ninquiries concerning her former companion, and there was ever a sadness\r\nin her tone when the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s name was mentioned, which showed that\r\nfrom whatever cause the elder Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s renunciation of her favourite\r\nand namesake proceeded, it was not from indifference to her fate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you ever had any reason for supposing your steward anything but an\r\nupright man?\xe2\x80\x99 he said to the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never the slightest. Have you?\xe2\x80\x99 said she reservedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well--I have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can say nothing plainly, because nothing is proved. But my suspicions\r\nare very strong.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean that he was rather cool towards his wife when they were\r\nfirst married, and that it was unfair in him to leave her? I know he\r\nwas; but I think his recent conduct towards her has amply atoned for the\r\nneglect.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked Miss Aldclyffe full in the face. It was plain that she spoke\r\nhonestly. She had not the slightest notion that the woman who lived with\r\nthe steward might be other than Mrs. Manston--much less that a greater\r\nmatter might be behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s not it--I wish it was no more. My suspicion is, first, that the\r\nwoman living at the Old House is not Mr. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not--Mr. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s wife?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe looked blankly at the rector. \xe2\x80\x98Not Mr. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife--who else can she be?\xe2\x80\x99 she said simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An improper woman of the name of Anne Seaway.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Raunham had, in common with other people, noticed the extraordinary\r\ninterest of Miss Aldclyffe in the well-being of her steward, and had\r\nendeavoured to account for it in various ways. The extent to which she\r\nwas shaken by his information, whilst it proved that the understanding\r\nbetween herself and Manston did not make her a sharer of his secrets,\r\nalso showed that the tie which bound her to him was still unbroken. Mr.\r\nRaunham had lately begun to doubt the latter fact, and now, on finding\r\nhimself mistaken, regretted that he had not kept his own counsel in the\r\nmatter. This it was too late to do, and he pushed on with his proofs. He\r\ngave Miss Aldclyffe in detail the grounds of his belief.\r\n\r\nBefore he had done, she recovered the cloak of reserve that she had\r\nadopted on his opening the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I might possibly be convinced that you were in the right, after such an\r\nelaborate argument,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied, \xe2\x80\x98were it not for one fact, which bears\r\nin the contrary direction so pointedly, that nothing but absolute proof\r\ncan turn it. It is that there is no conceivable motive which\r\ncould induce any sane man--leaving alone a man of Mr. Manston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclear-headedness and integrity--to venture upon such an extraordinary\r\ncourse of conduct--no motive on earth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That was my own opinion till after the visit of a friend last night--a\r\nfriend of mine and poor little Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--and Cytherea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe, catching at the idea raised\r\nby the name. \xe2\x80\x98That he loved Cytherea--yes and loves her now, wildly and\r\ndevotedly, I am as positive as that I breathe. Cytherea is years younger\r\nthan Mrs. Manston--as I shall call her--twice as sweet in disposition,\r\nthree times as beautiful. Would he have given her up quietly and\r\nsuddenly for a common--Mr. Raunham, your story is monstrous, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve it!\xe2\x80\x99 She glowed in her earnestness.\r\n\r\nThe rector might now have advanced his second proposition--the possible\r\nmotive--but for reasons of his own he did not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, madam. I only hope that facts will sustain you in your\r\nbelief. Ask him the question to his face, whether the woman is his wife\r\nor no, and see how he receives it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will to-morrow, most certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98I always let these things\r\ndie of wholesome ventilation, as every fungus does.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut no sooner had the rector left her presence, than the grain of\r\nmustard-seed he had sown grew to a tree. Her impatience to set her\r\nmind at rest could not brook a night\xe2\x80\x99s delay. It was with the utmost\r\ndifficulty that she could wait till evening arrived to screen her\r\nmovements. Immediately the sun had dropped behind the horizon, and\r\nbefore it was quite dark, she wrapped her cloak around her, softly left\r\nthe house, and walked erect through the gloomy park in the direction of\r\nthe old manor-house.\r\n\r\nThe same minute saw two persons sit down in the rectory-house to\r\nshare the rector\xe2\x80\x99s usually solitary dinner. One was a man of official\r\nappearance, commonplace in all except his eyes. The other was Edward\r\nSpringrove.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the carefully-concealed letters rankled in the mind of\r\nAnne Seaway. Her woman\xe2\x80\x99s nature insisted that Manston had no right to\r\nkeep all matters connected with his lost wife a secret from herself.\r\nPerplexity had bred vexation; vexation, resentment; curiosity had been\r\ncontinuous. The whole morning this resentment and curiosity increased.\r\n\r\nThe steward said very little to his companion during their luncheon\r\nat mid-day. He seemed reckless of appearances--almost indifferent to\r\nwhatever fate awaited him. All his actions betrayed that something\r\nportentous was impending, and still he explained nothing. By carefully\r\nobserving every trifling action, as only a woman can observe them,\r\nthe thought at length dawned upon her that he was going to run away\r\nsecretly. She feared for herself; her knowledge of law and justice was\r\nvague, and she fancied she might in some way be made responsible for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon he went out of the house again, and she watched him\r\ndrive away in the direction of the county-town. She felt a desire to go\r\nthere herself, and, after an interval of half-an-hour, followed him on\r\nfoot notwithstanding the distance--ostensibly to do some shopping.\r\n\r\nOne among her several trivial errands was to make a small purchase at\r\nthe druggist\xe2\x80\x99s. Near the druggist\xe2\x80\x99s stood the County Bank. Looking out\r\nof the shop window, between the coloured bottles, she saw Manston come\r\ndown the steps of the bank, in the act of withdrawing his hand from his\r\npocket, and pulling his coat close over its mouth.\r\n\r\nIt is an almost universal habit with people, when leaving a bank, to be\r\ncarefully adjusting their pockets if they have been receiving money; if\r\nthey have been paying it in, their hands swing laxly. The steward had\r\nin all likelihood been taking money--possibly on Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount--that was continual with him. And he might have been removing\r\nhis own, as a man would do who was intending to leave the country.\r\n\r\n3. FROM FIVE TO EIGHT O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK P.M.\r\n\r\nAnne reached home again in time to preside over preparations for dinner.\r\nManston came in half-an-hour later. The lamp was lighted, the shutters\r\nwere closed, and they sat down together. He was pale and worn--almost\r\nhaggard.\r\n\r\nThe meal passed off in almost unbroken silence. When preoccupation\r\nwithstands the influence of a social meal with one pleasant companion,\r\nthe mental scene must be surpassingly vivid. Just as she was rising a\r\ntap came to the door.\r\n\r\nBefore a maid could attend to the knock, Manston crossed the room and\r\nanswered it himself. The visitor was Miss Aldclyffe.\r\n\r\nManston instantly came back and spoke to Anne in an undertone. \xe2\x80\x98I should\r\nbe glad if you could retire to your room for a short time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a dry, starlight evening,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied. \xe2\x80\x98I will go for a\r\nlittle walk if your object is merely a private conversation with Miss\r\nAldclyffe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, do; there\xe2\x80\x99s no accounting for tastes,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. A few\r\ncommonplaces then passed between her and Miss Aldclyffe, and Anne went\r\nupstairs to bonnet and cloak herself. She came down, opened the front\r\ndoor, and went out.\r\n\r\nShe looked around to realize the night. It was dark, mournful, and\r\nquiet. Then she stood still. From the moment that Manston had requested\r\nher absence, a strong and burning desire had prevailed in her to know\r\nthe subject of Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with him. Simple curiosity\r\nwas not entirely what inspired her. Her suspicions had been thoroughly\r\naroused by the discovery of the morning. A conviction that her future\r\ndepended on her power to combat a man who, in desperate circumstances,\r\nwould be far from a friend to her, prompted a strategic movement to\r\nacquire the important secret that was in handling now. The woman thought\r\nand thought, and regarded the dull dark trees, anxiously debating how\r\nthe thing could be done.\r\n\r\nStealthily re-opening the front door she entered the hall, and advancing\r\nand pausing alternately, came close to the door of the room in which\r\nMiss Aldclyffe and Manston conversed. Nothing could be heard through the\r\nkeyhole or panels. At a great risk she softly turned the knob and\r\nopened the door to a width of about half-an-inch, performing the act so\r\ndelicately that three minutes, at least, were occupied in completing it.\r\nAt that instant Miss Aldclyffe said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a draught somewhere. The door is ajar, I think.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnne glided back under the staircase. Manston came forward and closed\r\nthe door. This chance was now cut off, and she considered again. The\r\nparlour, or sitting-room, in which the conference took place, had the\r\nwindow-shutters fixed on the outside of the window, as is usual in the\r\nback portions of old country-houses. The shutters were hinged one\r\non each side of the opening, and met in the middle, where they were\r\nfastened by a bolt passing continuously through them and the wood\r\nmullion within, the bolt being secured on the inside by a pin, which was\r\nseldom inserted till Manston and herself were about to retire for the\r\nnight; sometimes not at all.\r\n\r\nIf she returned to the door of the room she might be discovered at any\r\nmoment, but could she listen at the window, which overlooked a part\r\nof the garden never visited after nightfall, she would be safe from\r\ndisturbance. The idea was worth a trial.\r\n\r\nShe glided round to the window, took the head of the bolt between her\r\nfinger and thumb, and softly screwed it round until it was entirely\r\nwithdrawn from its position. The shutters remained as before, whilst,\r\nwhere the bolt had come out, was now a shining hole three-quarters of\r\nan inch in diameter, through which one might see into the middle of the\r\nroom. She applied her eye to the orifice.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe and Manston were both standing; Manston with his back to\r\nthe window, his companion facing it. The lady\xe2\x80\x99s demeanour was severe,\r\ncondemnatory, and haughty. No more was to be seen; Anne then turned\r\nsideways, leant with her shoulder against the shutters and placed her\r\near upon the hole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know where,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe. \xe2\x80\x98And how could you, a man, act a\r\ndouble deceit like this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Men do strange things sometimes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What was your reason--come?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A mere whim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I might even believe that, if the woman were handsomer than Cytherea,\r\nor if you had been married some time to Cytherea and had grown tired of\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And can\xe2\x80\x99t you believe it, too, under these conditions; that I married\r\nCytherea, gave her up because I heard that my wife was alive, found that\r\nmy wife would not come to live with me, and then, not to let any woman\r\nI love so well as Cytherea run any risk of being displaced and ruined in\r\nreputation, should my wife ever think fit to return, induced this woman\r\nto come to me, as being better than no companion at all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot believe it. Your love for Cytherea was not of such a kind\r\nas that excuse would imply. It was Cytherea or nobody with you. As an\r\nobject of passion, you did not desire the company of this Anne Seaway\r\nat all, and certainly not so much as to madly risk your reputation\r\nby bringing her here in the way you have done. I am sure you didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nAEneas.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So am I,\xe2\x80\x99 he said bluntly.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe uttered an exclamation of astonishment; the confession\r\nwas like a blow in its suddenness. She began to reproach him bitterly,\r\nand with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How could you overthrow my plans, disgrace the only girl I ever had any\r\nrespect for, by such inexplicable doings!... That woman must leave this\r\nplace--the country perhaps. Heavens! the truth will leak out in a day or\r\ntwo!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She must do no such thing, and the truth must be stifled\r\nsomehow--nobody knows how. If I stay here, or on any spot of the\r\ncivilized globe, as AEneas Manston, this woman must live with me as my\r\nwife, or I am damned past redemption!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not countenance your keeping her, whatever your motive may be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must do something,\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured. \xe2\x80\x98You must. Yes, you must.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never will,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98It is a criminal act.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked at her earnestly. \xe2\x80\x98Will you not support me through this\r\ndeception if my very life depends upon it? Will you not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense! Life! It will be a scandal to you, but she must leave this\r\nplace. It will out sooner or later, and the exposure had better come\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nManston repeated gloomily the same words. \xe2\x80\x98My life depends upon your\r\nsupporting me--my very life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe then came close to her, and spoke into her ear. Whilst he spoke he\r\nheld her head to his mouth with both his hands. Strange expressions came\r\nover her face; the workings of her mouth were painful to observe. Still\r\nhe held her and whispered on.\r\n\r\nThe only words that could be caught by Anne Seaway, confused as her\r\nhearing frequently was by the moan of the wind and the waterfall in\r\nher outer ear, were these of Miss Aldclyffe, in tones which absolutely\r\nquivered: \xe2\x80\x98They have no money. What can they prove?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe listener tasked herself to the utmost to catch his answer, but it\r\nwas in vain. Of the remainder of the colloquy one fact alone was plain\r\nto Anne, and that only inductively--that Miss Aldclyffe, from what he\r\nhad revealed to her, was going to scheme body and soul on Manston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe seemed now to have no further reason for remaining,\r\nyet she lingered awhile as if loth to leave him. When, finally, the\r\ncrestfallen and agitated lady made preparations for departure, Anne\r\nquickly inserted the bolt, ran round to the entrance archway, and down\r\nthe steps into the park. Here she stood close to the trunk of a huge\r\nlime-tree, which absorbed her dark outline into its own.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes she saw Manston, with Miss Aldclyffe leaning on his\r\narm, cross the glade before her and proceed in the direction of the\r\nhouse. She watched them ascend the rise and advance, as two black spots,\r\ntowards the mansion. The appearance of an oblong space of light in the\r\ndark mass of walls denoted that the door was opened. Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noutline became visible upon it; the door shut her in, and all was\r\ndarkness again. The form of Manston returning alone arose from the\r\ngloom, and passed by Anne in her hiding-place.\r\n\r\nWaiting outside a quarter of an hour longer, that no suspicion of any\r\nkind might be excited, Anne returned to the old manor-house.\r\n\r\n4. FROM EIGHT TO ELEVEN O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK P.M.\r\n\r\nManston was very friendly that evening. It was evident to her, now\r\nthat she was behind the scenes, that he was making desperate efforts to\r\ndisguise the real state of his mind.\r\n\r\nHer terror of him did not decrease. They sat down to supper, Manston\r\nstill talking cheerfully. But what is keener than the eye of a\r\nmistrustful woman? A man\xe2\x80\x99s cunning is to it as was the armour of Sisera\r\nto the thin tent-nail. She found, in spite of his adroitness, that he\r\nwas attempting something more than a disguise of his feeling. He was\r\ntrying to distract her attention, that he might be unobserved in some\r\nspecial movement of his hands.\r\n\r\nWhat a moment it was for her then! The whole surface of her body became\r\nattentive. She allowed him no chance whatever. We know the duplicated\r\ncondition at such times--when the existence divides itself into two, and\r\nthe ostensibly innocent chatterer stands in front, like another person,\r\nto hide the timorous spy.\r\n\r\nManston played the same game, but more palpably. The meal was nearly\r\nover when he seemed possessed of a new idea of how his object might be\r\naccomplished. He tilted back his chair with a reflective air, and looked\r\nsteadily at the clock standing against the wall opposite to him. He said\r\nsententiously, \xe2\x80\x98Few faces are capable of expressing more by dumb\r\nshow than the face of a clock. You may see in it every variety of\r\nincentive--from the softest seductions to negligence to the strongest\r\nhints for action.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, in what way?\xe2\x80\x99 she inquired. His drift was, as yet, quite\r\nunintelligible to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, for instance: look at the cold, methodical, unromantic,\r\nbusiness-like air of all the right-angled positions of the hands. They\r\nmake a man set about work in spite of himself. Then look at the piquant\r\nshyness of its face when the two hands are over each other. Several\r\nattitudes imply \xe2\x80\x9cMake ready.\xe2\x80\x9d The \xe2\x80\x9cmake ready\xe2\x80\x9d of ten minutes to one\r\ndiffers from the \xe2\x80\x9cmake ready\xe2\x80\x9d of ten minutes to twelve, as youth differs\r\nfrom age. \xe2\x80\x9cUpward and onward\xe2\x80\x9d says twenty-five minutes to eleven.\r\nMid-day or midnight expresses distinctly \xe2\x80\x9cIt is done.\xe2\x80\x9d You surely have\r\nnoticed that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe continued with affected quaintness:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The easy dash of ten minutes past seven, the rakish recklessness of a\r\nquarter past, the drooping weariness of twenty-five minutes past, must\r\nhave been observed by everybody.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whatever amount of truth there may be, there is a good deal of\r\nimagination in your fancy,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\nHe still contemplated the clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, again, the general finish of the face has a great effect upon the\r\neye. This old-fashioned brass-faced one we have here, with its arched\r\ntop, half-moon slit for the day of the month, and ship rocking at the\r\nupper part, impresses me with the notion of its being an old cynic,\r\nelevating his brows, whose thoughts can be seen wavering between good\r\nand evil.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA thought now enlightened her: the clock was behind her, and he wanted\r\nto get her back turned. She dreaded turning, yet, not to excite his\r\nsuspicion, she was on her guard; she quickly looked behind her at the\r\nclock as he spoke, recovering her old position again instantly. The time\r\nhad not been long enough for any action whatever on his part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 he casually remarked, and at the same minute began to pour her\r\nout a glass of wine. \xe2\x80\x98Speaking of the clock has reminded me that it must\r\nnearly want winding up. Remember that it is wound to-night. Suppose you\r\ndo it at once, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was no possible way of evading the act. She resolutely turned to\r\nperform the operation: anything was better than that he should suspect\r\nher. It was an old-fashioned eight-day clock, of workmanship suited to\r\nthe rest of the antique furniture that Manston had collected there, and\r\nground heavily during winding.\r\n\r\nAnne had given up all idea of being able to watch him during the\r\ninterval, and the noise of the wheels prevented her learning anything by\r\nher ears. But, as she wound, she caught sight of his shadow on the wall\r\nat her right hand.\r\n\r\nWhat was he doing? He was in the very act of pouring something into her\r\nglass of wine.\r\n\r\nHe had completed the manoeuvre before she had done winding. She\r\nmethodically closed the clock-case and turned round again. When she\r\nfaced him he was sitting in his chair as before she had risen.\r\n\r\nIn a familiar scene which has hitherto been pleasant it is difficult to\r\nrealize that an added condition, which does not alter its aspect, can\r\nhave made it terrible. The woman thought that his action must have been\r\nprompted by no other intent than that of poisoning her, and yet she\r\ncould not instantly put on a fear of her position.\r\n\r\nAnd before she had grasped these consequences, another supposition\r\nserved to make her regard the first as unlikely, if not absurd. It was\r\nthe act of a madman to take her life in a manner so easy of discovery,\r\nunless there were far more reason for the crime than any that Manston\r\ncould possibly have.\r\n\r\nWas it not merely his intention, in tampering with her wine, to make\r\nher sleep soundly that night? This was in harmony with her original\r\nsuspicion, that he intended secretly to abscond. At any rate, he was\r\ngoing to set about some stealthy proceeding, as to which she was to be\r\nkept in utter darkness. The difficulty now was to avoid drinking the\r\nwine.\r\n\r\nBy means of one pretext and another she put off taking her glass for\r\nnearly five minutes, but he eyed her too frequently to allow her to\r\nthrow the potion under the grate. It became necessary to take one\r\nsip. This she did, and found an opportunity of absorbing it in her\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\nPlainly he had no idea of her countermoves. The scheme seemed to him in\r\nproper train, and he turned to poke out the fire. She instantly seized\r\nthe glass, and poured its contents down her bosom. When he faced round\r\nagain she was holding the glass to her lips, empty.\r\n\r\nIn due course he locked the doors and saw that the shutters were\r\nfastened. She attended to a few closing details of housewifery, and a\r\nfew minutes later they retired for the night.\r\n\r\n5. FROM ELEVEN O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK TO MIDNIGHT\r\n\r\nWhen Manston was persuaded, by the feigned heaviness of her breathing,\r\nthat Anne Seaway was asleep, he softly arose, and dressed himself in the\r\ngloom. With ears strained to their utmost she heard him complete this\r\noperation; then he took something from his pocket, put it in the drawer\r\nof the dressing-table, went to the door, and down the stairs. She glided\r\nout of bed and looked in the drawer. He had only restored to its place\r\na small phial she had seen there before. It was labelled \xe2\x80\x98Battley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nSolution of Opium.\xe2\x80\x99 She felt relieved that her life had not been\r\nattempted. That was to have been her sleeping-draught. No time was to\r\nbe lost if she meant to be a match for him. She followed him in her\r\nnightdress. When she reached the foot of the staircase he was in the\r\noffice and had closed the door, under which a faint gleam showed that\r\nhe had obtained a light. She crept to the door, but could not venture to\r\nopen it, however slightly. Placing her ear to the panel, she could hear\r\nhim tearing up papers of some sort, and a brighter and quivering ray of\r\nlight coming from the threshold an instant later, implied that he was\r\nburning them. By the slight noise of his footsteps on the uncarpeted\r\nfloor, she at length imagined that he was approaching the door. She\r\nflitted upstairs again and crept into bed.\r\n\r\nManston returned to the bedroom close upon her heels, and entered\r\nit--again without a light. Standing motionless for an instant to assure\r\nhimself that she still slept, he went to the drawer in which their\r\nready-money was kept, and removed the casket that contained it. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\near distinctly caught the rustle of notes, and the chink of the gold\r\nas he handled it. Some he placed in his pocket, some he returned to\r\nits place. He stood thinking, as it were weighing a possibility. While\r\nlingering thus, he noticed the reflected image of his own face in the\r\nglass--pale and spectre-like in its indistinctness. The sight seemed to\r\nbe the feather which turned the balance of indecision: he drew a heavy\r\nbreath, retired from the room, and passed downstairs. She heard him\r\nunbar the back-door, and go out into the yard.\r\n\r\nFeeling safe in a conclusion that he did not intend to return to the\r\nbedroom again, she arose, and hastily dressed herself. On going to the\r\ndoor of the apartment she found that he had locked it behind him. \xe2\x80\x98A\r\nprecaution--it can be no more,\xe2\x80\x99 she muttered. Yet she was all the more\r\nperplexed and excited on this account. Had he been going to leave home\r\nimmediately, he would scarcely have taken the trouble to lock her in,\r\nholding the belief that she was in a drugged sleep. The lock shot into a\r\nmortice, so that there was no possibility of her pushing back the bolt.\r\nHow should she follow him? Easily. An inner closet opened from the\r\nbedroom: it was large, and had some time heretofore been used as a\r\ndressing or bath room, but had been found inconvenient from having no\r\nother outlet to the landing. The window of this little room looked out\r\nupon the roof of the porch, which was flat and covered with lead. Anne\r\ntook a pillow from the bed, gently opened the casement of the inner room\r\nand stepped forth on the flat. There, leaning over the edge of the\r\nsmall parapet that ornamented the porch, she dropped the pillow upon the\r\ngravel path, and let herself down over the parapet by her hands till\r\nher toes swung about two feet from the ground. From this position she\r\nadroitly alighted upon the pillow, and stood in the path.\r\n\r\nSince she had come indoors from her walk in the early part of the\r\nevening the moon had risen. But the thick clouds overspreading the whole\r\nlandscape rendered the dim light pervasive and grey: it appeared as\r\nan attribute of the air. Anne crept round to the back of the house,\r\nlistening intently. The steward had had at least ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99 start of\r\nher. She had waited here whilst one might count fifty, when she heard a\r\nmovement in the outhouse--a fragment once attached to the main building.\r\nThis outhouse was partitioned into an outer and an inner room, which\r\nhad been a kitchen and a scullery before the connecting erections were\r\npulled down, but they were now used respectively as a brewhouse and\r\nworkshop, the only means of access to the latter being through the\r\nbrewhouse. The outer door of this first apartment was usually fastened\r\nby a padlock on the exterior. It was now closed, but not fastened.\r\nManston was evidently in the outhouse.\r\n\r\nShe slightly moved the door. The interior of the brewhouse was wrapped\r\nin gloom, but a streak of light fell towards her in a line across the\r\nfloor from the inner or workshop door, which was not quite closed. This\r\nlight was unexpected, none having been visible through hole or crevice.\r\nGlancing in, the woman found that he had placed cloths and mats at the\r\nvarious apertures, and hung a sack at the window to prevent the egress\r\nof a single ray. She could also perceive from where she stood that the\r\nbar of light fell across the brewing-copper just outside the inner door,\r\nand that upon it lay the key of her bedroom. The illuminated interior of\r\nthe workshop was also partly visible from her position through the two\r\nhalf-open doors. Manston was engaged in emptying a large cupboard of the\r\ntools, gallipots, and old iron it contained. When it was quite\r\ncleared he took a chisel, and with it began to withdraw the hooks\r\nand shoulder-nails holding the cupboard to the wall. All these being\r\nloosened, he extended his arms, lifted the cupboard bodily from the\r\nbrackets under it, and deposited it on the floor beside him.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the wall which had been screened by the cupboard was now\r\nlaid bare. This, it appeared, had been plastered more recently than the\r\nbulk of the outhouse. Manston loosened the plaster with some kind\r\nof tool, flinging the pieces into a basket as they fell. Having now\r\nstripped clear about two feet area of wall, he inserted a crowbar\r\nbetween the joints of the bricks beneath, softly wriggling it until\r\nseveral were loosened. There was now disclosed the mouth of an old oven,\r\nwhich was apparently contrived in the thickness of the wall, and having\r\nfallen into disuse, had been closed up with bricks in this manner. It\r\nwas formed after the simple old-fashioned plan of oven-building--a mere\r\noblate cavity without a flue.\r\n\r\nManston now stretched his arm into the oven, dragged forth a heavy\r\nweight of great bulk, and let it slide to the ground. The woman who\r\nwatched him could see the object plainly. It was a common corn-sack,\r\nnearly full, and was tied at the mouth in the usual way.\r\n\r\nThe steward had once or twice started up, as if he had heard sounds, and\r\nhis motions now became more cat-like still. On a sudden he put out the\r\nlight. Anne had made no noise, yet a foreign noise of some kind had\r\ncertainly been made in the intervening portion of the house. She heard\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x98One of the rats,\xe2\x80\x99 she thought.\r\n\r\nHe seemed soon to recover from his alarm, but changed his tactics\r\ncompletely. He did not light his candle--going on with his work in the\r\ndark. She had only sounds to go by now, and, judging as well as she\r\ncould from these, he was piling up the bricks which closed the oven\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmouth as they had been before he disturbed them. The query that had not\r\nleft her brain all the interval of her inspection--how should she get\r\nback into her bedroom again?--now received a solution. Whilst he was\r\nreplacing the cupboard, she would glide across the brewhouse, take the\r\nkey from the top of the copper, run upstairs, unlock the door, and bring\r\nback the key again: if he returned to bed, which was unlikely, he would\r\nthink the lock had failed to catch in the staple. This thought and\r\nintention, occupying such length of words, flashed upon her in an\r\ninstant, and hardly disturbed her strong curiosity to stay and learn the\r\nmeaning of his actions in the workshop.\r\n\r\nSlipping sideways through the first door and closing it behind her, she\r\nadvanced into the darkness towards the second, making every individual\r\nfootfall with the greatest care, lest the fragments of rubbish on the\r\nfloor should crackle beneath her tread. She soon stood close by the\r\ncopper, and not more than a foot from the door of the room occupied\r\nby Manston himself, from which position she could distinctly hear him\r\nbreathe between each exertion, although it was far too dark to discern\r\nanything of him.\r\n\r\nTo secure the key of her chamber was her first anxiety, and accordingly\r\nshe cautiously reached out with her hand to where it lay. Instead of\r\ntouching it, her fingers came in contact with the boot of a human being.\r\n\r\nShe drooped faint in a cold sweat. It was the foot either of a man or\r\nwoman, standing on the brewing-copper where the key had lain. A warm\r\nfoot, covered with a polished boot.\r\n\r\nThe startling discovery so terrified her that she could hardly repress a\r\nsound. She withdrew her hand with a motion like the flight of an arrow.\r\nHer touch was so light that the leather seemed to have been thick enough\r\nto keep the owner of the foot in entire ignorance of it, and the noise\r\nof Manston\xe2\x80\x99s scraping might have been quite sufficient to drown the\r\nslight rustle of her dress.\r\n\r\nThe person was obviously not the steward: he was still busy. It was\r\nsomebody who, since the light had been extinguished, had taken advantage\r\nof the gloom, to come from some dark recess in the brewhouse and stand\r\nupon the brickwork of the copper. The fear which had at first paralyzed\r\nher lessened with the birth of a sense that fear now was utter failure:\r\nshe was in a desperate position and must abide by the consequences.\r\nThe motionless person on the copper was, equally with Manston, quite\r\nunconscious of her proximity, and she ventured to advance her hand\r\nagain, feeling behind the feet, till she found the key. On its return to\r\nher side, her finger-tip skimmed the lower verge of a trousers-leg.\r\n\r\nIt was a man, then, who stood there. To go to the door just at this time\r\nwas impolitic, and she shrank back into an inner corner to wait. The\r\ncomparative security from discovery that her new position ensured\r\nresuscitated reason a little, and empowered her to form some logical\r\ninferences:--\r\n\r\n1. The man who stood on the copper had taken advantage of the darkness\r\nto get there, as she had to enter.\r\n\r\n2. The man must have been hidden in the outhouse before she had reached\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n3. He must be watching Manston with much calculation and system, and for\r\npurposes of his own.\r\n\r\nShe could now tell by the noises that Manston had completed his\r\nre-erection of the cupboard. She heard him replacing the articles it had\r\ncontained--bottle by bottle, tool by tool--after which he came into the\r\nbrewhouse, went to the window, and pulled down the cloths covering it;\r\nbut the window being rather small, this unveiling scarcely relieved the\r\ndarkness of the interior. He returned to the workshop, hoisted something\r\nto his back by a jerk, and felt about the room for some other article.\r\nHaving found it, he emerged from the inner door, crossed the brewhouse,\r\nand went into the yard. Directly he stepped out she could see his\r\noutline by the light of the clouded and weakly moon. The sack was slung\r\nat his back, and in his hand he carried a spade.\r\n\r\nAnne now waited in her corner in breathless suspense for the proceedings\r\nof the other man. In about half-a-minute she heard him descend from the\r\ncopper, and then the square opening of the doorway showed the outline of\r\nthis other watcher passing through it likewise. The form was that of\r\na broad-shouldered man enveloped in a long coat. He vanished after the\r\nsteward.\r\n\r\nThe woman vented a sigh of relief, and moved forward to follow.\r\nSimultaneously, she discovered that the watcher whose foot she had\r\ntouched was, in his turn, watched and followed also.\r\n\r\nIt was by one of her own sex. Anne Seaway shrank backward again. The\r\nunknown woman came forward from the further side of the yard, and\r\npondered awhile in hesitation. Tall, dark, and closely wrapped, she\r\nstood up from the earth like a cypress. She moved, crossed the yard\r\nwithout producing the slightest disturbance by her footsteps, and went\r\nin the direction the others had taken.\r\n\r\nAnne waited yet another minute--then in her turn noiselessly followed\r\nthe last woman.\r\n\r\nBut so impressed was she with the sensation of people in hiding, that\r\nin coming out of the yard she turned her head to see if any person were\r\nfollowing her, in the same way. Nobody was visible, but she discerned,\r\nstanding behind the angle of the stable, Manston\xe2\x80\x99s horse and gig, ready\r\nharnessed.\r\n\r\nHe did intend to fly after all, then, she thought. He must have placed\r\nthe horse in readiness, in the interval between his leaving the house\r\nand her exit by the window. However, there was not time to weigh this\r\nbranch of the night\xe2\x80\x99s events. She turned about again, and continued on\r\nthe trail of the other three.\r\n\r\n6. FROM MIDNIGHT TO HALF-PAST ONE A.M.\r\n\r\nIntentness pervaded everything; Night herself seemed to have become a\r\nwatcher.\r\n\r\nThe four persons proceeded across the glade, and into the park\r\nplantation, at equidistances of about seventy yards. Here the ground,\r\ncompletely overhung by the foliage, was coated with a thick moss which\r\nwas as soft as velvet beneath their feet. The first watcher, that\r\nis, the man walking immediately behind Manston, now fell back,\r\nwhen Manston\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeper, knowing the ground pretty well, dived\r\ncircuitously among the trees and got directly behind the steward, who,\r\nencumbered with his load, had proceeded but slowly. The other woman\r\nseemed now to be about opposite to Anne, or a little in advance, but on\r\nManston\xe2\x80\x99s other hand.\r\n\r\nHe reached a pit, midway between the waterfall and the engine-house.\r\nThere he stopped, wiped his face, and listened.\r\n\r\nInto this pit had drifted uncounted generations of withered leaves, half\r\nfilling it. Oak, beech, and chestnut, rotten and brown alike, mingled\r\nthemselves in one fibrous mass. Manston descended into the midst of\r\nthem, placed his sack on the ground, and raking the leaves aside into a\r\nlarge heap, began digging. Anne softly drew nearer, crept into a bush,\r\nand turning her head to survey the rest, missed the man who had dropped\r\nbehind, and whom we have called the first watcher. Concluding that he,\r\ntoo, had hidden himself, she turned her attention to the second watcher,\r\nthe other woman, who had meanwhile advanced near to where Anne lay\r\nin hiding, and now seated herself behind a tree, still closer to the\r\nsteward than was Anne Seaway.\r\n\r\nHere and thus Anne remained concealed. The crunch of the steward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspade, as it cut into the soft vegetable mould, was plainly perceptible\r\nto her ears when the periodic cessations between the creaks of the\r\nengine concurred with a lull in the breeze, which otherwise brought\r\nthe subdued roar of the cascade from the further side of the bank\r\nthat screened it. A large hole--some four or five feet deep--had been\r\nexcavated by Manston in about twenty minutes. Into this he immediately\r\nplaced the sack, and then began filling in the earth, and treading it\r\ndown. Lastly he carefully raked the whole mass of dead and dry leaves\r\ninto the middle of the pit, burying the ground with them as they had\r\nburied it before.\r\n\r\nFor a hiding-place the spot was unequalled. The thick accumulation\r\nof leaves, which had not been disturbed for centuries, might not be\r\ndisturbed again for centuries to come, whilst their lower layers still\r\ndecayed and added to the mould beneath.\r\n\r\nBy the time this work was ended the sky had grown clearer, and Anne\r\ncould now see distinctly the face of the other woman, stretching from\r\nbehind the tree, seemingly forgetful of her position in her intense\r\ncontemplation of the actions of the steward. Her countenance was white\r\nand motionless.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that Manston should not soon notice her. At the\r\ncompletion of his labour he turned, and did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ho--you here!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am a spy upon you,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, in an imploring whisper.\r\nAnne recognized the voice as Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThe trembling lady added hastily another remark, which was drowned in\r\nthe recurring creak of the engine close at hand The first watcher, if he\r\nhad come no nearer than his original position, was too far off to hear\r\nany part of this dialogue, on account of the roar of the falling water,\r\nwhich could reach him unimpeded by the bank.\r\n\r\nThe remark of Miss Aldclyffe to Manston had plainly been concerning the\r\nfirst watcher, for Manston, with his spade in his hand, instantly rushed\r\nto where the man was concealed, and, before the latter could disengage\r\nhimself from the boughs, the steward struck him on the head with the\r\nblade of the instrument. The man fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fly!\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Aldclyffe to Manston. Manston vanished amidst the\r\ntrees. Miss Aldclyffe went off in a contrary direction.\r\n\r\nAnne Seaway was about to run away likewise, when she turned and looked\r\nat the fallen man. He lay on his face, motionless.\r\n\r\nMany of these women who own to no moral code show considerable\r\nmagnanimity when they see people in trouble. To act right simply because\r\nit is one\xe2\x80\x99s duty is proper; but a good action which is the result of no\r\nlaw of reflection shines more than any. She went up to him and gently\r\nturned him over, upon which he began to show signs of life. By her\r\nassistance he was soon able to stand upright.\r\n\r\nHe looked about him with a bewildered air, endeavouring to collect his\r\nideas. \xe2\x80\x98Who are you?\xe2\x80\x99 he said to the woman, mechanically.\r\n\r\nIt was bad policy now to attempt disguise. \xe2\x80\x98I am the supposed Mrs.\r\nManston,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98Who are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am the officer employed by Mr. Raunham to sift this mystery--which\r\nmay be criminal.\xe2\x80\x99 He stretched his limbs, pressed his head, and\r\nseemed gradually to awake to a sense of having been incautious in his\r\nutterance. \xe2\x80\x98Never you mind who I am,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued. \xe2\x80\x98Well, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter now, either--it will no longer be a secret.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe stooped for his hat and ran in the direction the steward had\r\ntaken--coming back again after the lapse of a minute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s only an aggravated assault, after all,\xe2\x80\x99 he said hastily, \xe2\x80\x98until we\r\nhave found out for certain what\xe2\x80\x99s buried here. It may be only a bag of\r\nbuilding rubbish; but it may be more. Come and help me dig.\xe2\x80\x99 He seized\r\nthe spade with the awkwardness of a town man, and went into the pit,\r\ncontinuing a muttered discourse. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s no use my running after him\r\nsingle-handed,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s ever so far off by this time. The best\r\nstep is to see what is here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was far easier for the detective to re-open the hole than it had been\r\nfor Manston to form it. The leaves were raked away, the loam thrown out,\r\nand the sack dragged forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold this,\xe2\x80\x99 he said to Anne, whose curiosity still kept her standing\r\nnear. He turned on the light of a dark lantern he had brought, and gave\r\nit into her hand.\r\n\r\nThe string which bound the mouth of the sack was now cut. The officer\r\nlaid the bag on its side, seized it by the bottom, and jerked forth\r\nthe contents. A large package was disclosed, carefully wrapped up in\r\nimpervious tarpaulin, also well tied. He was on the point of pulling\r\nopen the folds at one end, when a light coloured thread of something,\r\nhanging on the outside, arrested his eye. He put his hand upon it; it\r\nfelt stringy, and adhered to his fingers. \xe2\x80\x98Hold the light close,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nShe held it close. He raised his hand to the glass, and they both peered\r\nat an almost intangible filament he held between his finger and thumb.\r\nIt was a long hair; the hair of a woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98God! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it--no, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it!\xe2\x80\x99 the detective\r\nwhispered, horror-struck. \xe2\x80\x98And I have lost the man for the present\r\nthrough my unbelief. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get into a sheltered place.... Now wait a\r\nminute whilst I prove it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe thrust his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and withdrew thence a\r\nminute packet of brown paper. Spreading it out he disclosed, coiled\r\nin the middle, another long hair. It was the hair the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s wife had\r\nfound on Manston\xe2\x80\x99s pillow nine days before the Carriford fire. He held\r\nthe two hairs to the light: they were both of a pale-brown hue. He laid\r\nthem parallel and stretched out his arms: they were of the same length\r\nto a nicety. The detective turned to Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is the body of his first wife,\xe2\x80\x99 he said quietly. \xe2\x80\x98He murdered her,\r\nas Mr. Springrove and the rector suspected--but how and when, God only\r\nknows.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Anne Seaway, a probable and natural sequence of\r\nevents and motives explanatory of the whole crime--events and\r\nmotives shadowed forth by the letter, Manston\xe2\x80\x99s possession of it, his\r\nrenunciation of Cytherea, and instalment of herself--flashing upon her\r\nmind with the rapidity of lightning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--I see,\xe2\x80\x99 said the detective, standing unusually close to her: and\r\na handcuff was on her wrist. \xe2\x80\x98You must come with me, madam. Knowing as\r\nmuch about a secret murder as God knows is a very suspicious thing: it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t make you a goddess--far from it.\xe2\x80\x99 He directed the bull\xe2\x80\x99s-eye\r\ninto her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pooh--lead on,\xe2\x80\x99 she said scornfully, \xe2\x80\x98and don\xe2\x80\x99t lose your principal\r\nactor for the sake of torturing a poor subordinate like me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe loosened her hand, gave her his arm, and dragged her out of the\r\ngrove--making her run beside him till they had reached the rectory. A\r\nlight was burning here, and an auxiliary of the detective\xe2\x80\x99s awaiting\r\nhim: a horse ready harnessed to a spring-cart was standing outside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have come--I wish I had known that,\xe2\x80\x99 the detective said to his\r\nassistant, hurriedly and angrily. \xe2\x80\x98Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve blundered--he\xe2\x80\x99s gone--you\r\nshould have been here, as I said! I was sold by that woman, Miss\r\nAldclyffe--she watched me.\xe2\x80\x99 He hastily gave directions in an undertone\r\nto this man. The concluding words were, \xe2\x80\x98Go in to the rector--he\xe2\x80\x99s up.\r\nDetain Miss Aldclyffe. I, in the meantime, am driving to Casterbridge\r\nwith this one, and for help. We shall be sure to have him when it gets\r\nlight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe assisted Anne into the vehicle, and drove off with her. As they went,\r\nthe clear, dry road showed before them, between the grassy quarters at\r\neach side, like a white riband, and made their progress easy. They came\r\nto a spot where the highway was overhung by dense firs for some distance\r\non both sides. It was totally dark here.\r\n\r\nThere was a smash; and a rude shock. In the very midst of its length, at\r\nthe point where the road began to drop down a hill, the detective\r\ndrove against something with a jerk which nearly flung them both to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe man recovered himself, placed Anne on the seat, and reached out\r\nhis hand. He found that the off-wheel of his gig was locked in that of\r\nanother conveyance of some kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hoy!\xe2\x80\x99 said the officer.\r\n\r\nNobody answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hoy, you man asleep there!\xe2\x80\x99 he said again.\r\n\r\nNo reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s odd--this comes of the folly of travelling without\r\ngig-lamps because you expect the dawn.\xe2\x80\x99 He jumped to the ground and\r\nturned on his lantern.\r\n\r\nThere was the gig which had obstructed him, standing in the middle of\r\nthe road; a jaded horse harnessed to it, but no human being in or near\r\nthe vehicle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know whose gig this is?\xe2\x80\x99 he said to the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 she said sullenly. But she did recognize it as the steward\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear it\xe2\x80\x99s Manston\xe2\x80\x99s! Come, I can hear it by your tone. However,\r\nyou needn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything which may criminate you. What forethought\r\nthe man must have had--how carefully he must have considered possible\r\ncontingencies! Why, he must have got the horse and gig ready before he\r\nbegan shifting the body.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe listened for a sound among the trees. None was to be heard but the\r\noccasional scamper of a rabbit over the withered leaves. He threw the\r\nlight of his lantern through a gap in the hedge, but could see nothing\r\nbeyond an impenetrable thicket. It was clear that Manston was not many\r\nyards off, but the question was how to find him. Nothing could be done\r\nby the detective just then, encumbered as he was by the horse and Anne.\r\nIf he had entered the thicket on a search unaided, Manston might have\r\nstepped unobserved from behind a bush and murdered him with the\r\ngreatest ease. Indeed, there were such strong reasons for the exploit in\r\nManston\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances at that moment that without showing cowardice,\r\nhis pursuer felt it hazardous to remain any longer where he stood.\r\n\r\nHe hastily tied the head of Manston\xe2\x80\x99s horse to the back of his own\r\nvehicle, that the steward might be deprived of the use of any means of\r\nescape other than his own legs, and drove on thus with his prisoner to\r\nthe county-town. Arrived there, he lodged her in the police-station, and\r\nthen took immediate steps for the capture of Manston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX. THE EVENTS OF THREE HOURS\r\n\r\n1. MARCH THE TWENTY-THIRD. MIDDAY\r\n\r\nThirty-six hours had elapsed since Manston\xe2\x80\x99s escape.\r\n\r\nIt was market-day at the county-town. The farmers outside and inside\r\nthe corn-exchange looked at their samples of wheat, and poured them\r\ncritically as usual from one palm to another, but they thought and spoke\r\nof Manston. Grocers serving behind their counters, instead of using\r\ntheir constant phrase, \xe2\x80\x98The next article, please?\xe2\x80\x99 substituted, \xe2\x80\x98Have\r\nyou heard if he\xe2\x80\x99s caught?\xe2\x80\x99 Dairymen and drovers standing beside the\r\nsheep and cattle pens, spread their legs firmly, readjusted their hats,\r\nthrust their hands into the lowest depths of their pockets, regarded the\r\nanimals with the utmost keenness of which the eye was capable, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay, so\xe2\x80\x99s: they\xe2\x80\x99ll have him avore night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLater in the day Edward Springrove passed along the street hurriedly and\r\nanxiously. \xe2\x80\x98Well, have you heard any more?\xe2\x80\x99 he said to an acquaintance\r\nwho accosted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They tracked him in this way,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other young man. \xe2\x80\x98A vagrant\r\nfirst told them that Manston had passed a rick at daybreak, under\r\nwhich this man was lying. They followed the track he pointed out\r\nand ultimately came to a stile. On the other side was a heap of\r\nhalf-hardened mud, scraped from the road. On the surface of the heap,\r\nwhere it had been smoothed by the shovel, was distinctly imprinted the\r\nform of a man\xe2\x80\x99s hand, the buttons of his waistcoat, and his watch-chain,\r\nshowing that he had stumbled in hurrying over the stile, and fallen\r\nthere. The pattern of the chain proved the man to have been Manston.\r\nThey followed on till they reached a ford crossed by stepping-stones--on\r\nthe further bank were the same footmarks that had shown themselves\r\nbeside the stile. The whole of this course had been in the direction\r\nof Budmouth. On they went, and the next clue was furnished them by a\r\nshepherd. He said that wherever a clear space three or four yards wide\r\nran in a line through a flock of sheep lying about a ewe-lease, it was a\r\nproof that somebody had passed there not more than half-an-hour earlier.\r\nAt twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock that day he had noticed such a feature in his flock.\r\nNothing more could be heard of him, and they got into Budmouth. The\r\nsteam-packet to the Channel Islands was to start at eleven last night,\r\nand they at once concluded that his hope was to get to France by way\r\nof Jersey and St. Malo--his only chance, all the railway-stations being\r\nwatched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, they went to the boat: he was not on board then. They went again\r\nat half-past ten: he had not come. Two men now placed themselves under\r\nthe lamp immediately beside the gangway. Another stayed by the office\r\ndoor, and one or two more up Mary Street--the straight cut to the quay.\r\nAt a quarter to eleven the mail-bags were put on board. Whilst the\r\nattention of the idlers was directed to the mails, down Mary Street\r\ncame a man as boldly as possible. The gait was Manston\xe2\x80\x99s, but not the\r\nclothes. He passed over to the shaded part of the street: heads were\r\nturned. I suppose this warned him, for he never emerged from the shadow.\r\nThey watched and waited, but the steward did not reappear. The alarm\r\nwas raised--they searched the town high and low--no Manston. All\r\nthis morning they have been searching, but there\xe2\x80\x99s not a sign of him\r\nanywhere. However, he has lost his last chance of getting across\r\nthe Channel. It is reported that he has since changed clothes with a\r\nlabourer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDuring this narration, Edward, lost in thought, had let his eyes follow\r\na shabby man in a smock-frock, but wearing light boots--who was stalking\r\ndown the street under a bundle of straw which overhung and concealed\r\nhis head. It was a very ordinary circumstance for a man with a bundle\r\nof straw on his shoulders and overhanging his head, to go down the High\r\nStreet. Edward saw him cross the bridge which divided the town from the\r\ncountry, place his shaggy encumbrance by the side of the road, and leave\r\nit there.\r\n\r\nSpringrove now parted from his acquaintance, and went also in the\r\ndirection of the bridge, and some way beyond it. As far as he could see\r\nstretched the turnpike road, and, while he was looking, he noticed a man\r\nto leap from the hedge at a point two hundred, or two hundred and fifty\r\nyards ahead, cross the road, and go through a wicket on the other side.\r\nThis figure seemed like that of the man who had been carrying the bundle\r\nof straw. He looked at the straw: it still stood alone.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined facts sprang, as it were, into juxtaposition in his\r\nbrain:--\r\n\r\nManston had been seen wearing the clothes of a labouring man--a brown\r\nsmock-frock. So had this man, who seemed other than a labourer, on\r\nsecond thoughts: and he had concealed his face by his bundle of straw\r\nwith the greatest ease and naturalness.\r\n\r\nThe path the man had taken led, among other places, to Tolchurch, where\r\nCytherea was living.\r\n\r\nIf Mrs. Manston was murdered, as some said, on the night of the fire,\r\nCytherea was the steward\xe2\x80\x99s lawful wife. Manston at bay, and reckless of\r\nresults, might rush to his wife and harm her.\r\n\r\nIt was a horrible supposition for a man who loved Cytherea to entertain;\r\nbut Springrove could not resist its influence. He started off for\r\nTolchurch.\r\n\r\n2. ONE TO TWO O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK P.M.\r\n\r\nOn that self-same mid-day, whilst Edward was proceeding to Tolchurch by\r\nthe footpath across the fields, Owen Graye had left the village and\r\nwas riding along the turnpike road to the county-town, that he might\r\nascertain the exact truth of the strange rumour which had reached him\r\nconcerning Manston. Not to disquiet his sister, he had said nothing to\r\nher of the matter.\r\n\r\nShe sat by the window reading. From her position she could see up the\r\nlane for a distance of at least a hundred yards. Passers-by were so rare\r\nin this retired nook, that the eyes of those who dwelt by the wayside\r\nwere invariably lifted to every one on the road, great and small, as to\r\na novelty.\r\n\r\nA man in a brown smock-frock turned the corner and came towards the\r\nhouse. It being market-day at Casterbridge, the village was nearly\r\ndeserted, and more than this, the old farm-house in which Owen and his\r\nsister were staying, stood, as has been stated, apart from the body of\r\ncottages. The man did not look respectable; Cytherea arose and bolted\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately he was near enough to see her cross the room. He advanced\r\nto the door, knocked, and, receiving no answer, came to the window; he\r\nnext pressed his face against the glass, peering in.\r\n\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s experience at that moment was probably as trying a one as\r\never fell to the lot of a gentlewoman to endure. She recognized in the\r\npeering face that of the man she had married.\r\n\r\nBut not a movement was made by her, not a sound escaped her. Her fear\r\nwas great; but had she known the truth--that the man outside, feeling\r\nhe had nothing on earth to lose by any act, was in the last stage of\r\nrecklessness, terrified nature must have given way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cytherea,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98let me come in: I am your husband.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied, still not realizing the magnitude of her peril. \xe2\x80\x98If\r\nyou want to speak to us, wait till my brother comes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, he\xe2\x80\x99s not at home? Cytherea, I can\xe2\x80\x99t live without you! All my sin has\r\nbeen because I love you so! Will you fly with me? I have money enough\r\nfor us both--only come with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not now--not now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am your husband, I tell you, and I must come in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You cannot,\xe2\x80\x99 she said faintly. His words began to terrify her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will, I say!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x98Will you let me in, I ask once more?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--I will not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I will let myself in!\xe2\x80\x99 he answered resolutely. \xe2\x80\x98I will, if I die\r\nfor it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe windows were glazed in lattice panes of leadwork, hung in casements.\r\nHe broke one of the panes with a stone, thrust his hand through the\r\nhole, unfastened the latch which held the casement close, and began\r\nopening the window.\r\n\r\nInstantly the shutters flew together with a slam, and were barred with\r\ndesperate quickness by Cytherea on the inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Damn you!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe ran round to the back of the house. His impatience was greater now:\r\nhe thrust his fist through the pantry window at one blow, and opened\r\nit in the same way as the former one had been opened, before the\r\nterror-stricken girl was aware that he had gone round. In an instant\r\nhe stood in the pantry, advanced to the front room where she was, flung\r\nback the shutters, and held out his arms to embrace her.\r\n\r\nIn extremely trying moments of bodily or mental pain, Cytherea either\r\nflushed hot or faded pale, according to the state of her constitution\r\nat the moment. Now she burned like fire from head to foot, and this\r\npreserved her consciousness.\r\n\r\nNever before had the poor child\xe2\x80\x99s natural agility served her in such\r\ngood stead as now. A heavy oblong table stood in the middle of the room.\r\nRound this table she flew, keeping it between herself and Manston, her\r\nlarge eyes wide open with terror, their dilated pupils constantly fixed\r\nupon Manston\xe2\x80\x99s, to read by his expression whether his next intention was\r\nto dart to the right or the left.\r\n\r\nEven he, at that heated moment, could not endure the expression of\r\nunutterable agony which shone from that extraordinary gaze of hers.\r\nIt had surely been given her by God as a means of defence. Manston\r\ncontinued his pursuit with a lowered eye.\r\n\r\nThe panting and maddened desperado--blind to everything but the capture\r\nof his wife--went with a rush under the table: she went over it like\r\na bird. He went heavily over it: she flew under it, and was out at the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98One on her youth and pliant limbs relies,\r\n      One on his sinews and his giant size.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut his superior strength was sure to tire her down in the long-run.\r\nShe felt her weakness increasing with the quickness of her breath; she\r\nuttered a wild scream, which in its heartrending intensity seemed to\r\necho for miles.\r\n\r\nAt the same juncture her hair became unfastened, and rolled down about\r\nher shoulders. The least accident at such critical periods is sufficient\r\nto confuse the overwrought intelligence. She lost sight of his intended\r\ndirection for one instant, and he immediately outmanoeuvred her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At last! my Cytherea!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, overturning the table, springing over\r\nit, seizing one of the long brown tresses, pulling her towards him, and\r\nclasping her round. She writhed downwards between his arms and breast,\r\nand fell fainting on the floor. For the first time his action was\r\nleisurely. He lifted her upon the sofa, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x98Rest there for a\r\nwhile, my frightened little bird!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd then there was an end of his triumph. He felt himself clutched by\r\nthe collar, and whizzed backwards with the force of a battering-ram\r\nagainst the fireplace. Springrove, wild, red, and breathless, had sprung\r\nin at the open window, and stood once more between man and wife.\r\n\r\nManston was on his legs again in an instant. A fiery glance on the one\r\nside, a glance of pitiless justice on the other, passed between them.\r\nIt was again the meeting in the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite: \xe2\x80\x98Hast\r\nthou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because\r\nthou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the Lord.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA desperate wrestle now began between the two men. Manston was the\r\ntaller, but there was in Edward much hard tough muscle which the\r\ndelicate flesh of the steward lacked. They flew together like the jaws\r\nof a gin. In a minute they were both on the floor, rolling over and\r\nover, locked in each other\xe2\x80\x99s grasp as tightly as if they had been one\r\norganic being at war with itself--Edward trying to secure Manston\xe2\x80\x99s arms\r\nwith a small thong he had drawn from his pocket, Manston trying to reach\r\nhis knife.\r\n\r\nTwo characteristic noises pervaded the apartment through this momentous\r\nspace of time. One was the sharp panting of the two combatants, so\r\nsimilar in each as to be undistinguishable; the other was the stroke\r\nof their heels and toes, as they smote the floor at every contortion of\r\nbody or limbs.\r\n\r\nCytherea had not lost consciousness for more than half-a-minute. She\r\nhad then leapt up without recognizing that Edward was her deliverer,\r\nunfastened the door, and rushed out, screaming wildly, \xe2\x80\x98Come! Help! O,\r\nhelp!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThree men stood not twenty yards off, looking perplexed. They dashed\r\nforward at her words. \xe2\x80\x98Have you seen a shabby man with a smock-frock on\r\nlately?\xe2\x80\x99 they inquired. She pointed to the door, and ran on the same as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nManston, who had just loosened himself from Edward\xe2\x80\x99s grasp, seemed\r\nat this moment to renounce his intention of pushing the conflict to a\r\ndesperate end. \xe2\x80\x98I give it all up for life--dear life!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, with a\r\nhoarse laugh. \xe2\x80\x98A reckless man has a dozen lives--see how I\xe2\x80\x99ll baffle you\r\nall yet!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe rushed out of the house, but no further. The boast was his last. In\r\none half-minute more he was helpless in the hands of his pursuers.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward staggered to his feet, and paused to recover breath. His thoughts\r\nhad never forsaken Cytherea, and his first act now was to hasten up the\r\nlane after her. She had not gone far. He found her leaning upon a bank\r\nby the roadside, where she had flung herself down in sheer exhaustion.\r\nHe ran up and lifted her in his arms, and thus aided she was enabled\r\nto stand upright--clinging to him. What would Springrove have given to\r\nimprint a kiss upon her lips then!\r\n\r\nThey walked slowly towards the house. The distressing sensation of whose\r\nwife she was could not entirely quench the resuscitated pleasure he felt\r\nat her grateful recognition of him, and her confiding seizure of his arm\r\nfor support. He conveyed her carefully into the house.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later, whilst she was sitting in a partially\r\nrecovered, half-dozing state in an arm-chair, Edward beside her waiting\r\nanxiously till Graye should arrive, they saw a spring-cart pass the\r\ndoor. Old and dry mud-splashes from long-forgotten rains disfigured its\r\nwheels and sides; the varnish and paint had been scratched and dimmed;\r\nornament had long been forgotten in a restless contemplation of use.\r\nThree men sat on the seat, the middle one being Manston. His hands\r\nwere bound in front of him, his eyes were set directly forward, his\r\ncountenance pallid, hard, and fixed.\r\n\r\nSpringrove had told Cytherea of Manston\xe2\x80\x99s crime in a few short words. He\r\nnow said solemnly, \xe2\x80\x98He is to die.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I cannot mourn for him,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied with a shudder, leaning back\r\nand covering her face with her hands.\r\n\r\nIn the silence that followed the two short remarks, Springrove watched\r\nthe cart round the corner, and heard the rattle of its wheels gradually\r\ndying away as it rolled in the direction of the county-town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI. THE EVENTS OF EIGHTEEN HOURS\r\n\r\n1. MARCH THE TWENTY-NINTH. NOON\r\n\r\nExactly seven days after Edward Springrove had seen the man with the\r\nbundle of straw walking down the streets of Casterbridge, old Farmer\r\nSpringrove was standing on the edge of the same pavement, talking to his\r\nfriend, Farmer Baker.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause in their discourse. Mr. Springrove was looking down\r\nthe street at some object which had attracted his attention. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, \xe2\x80\x98tis\r\nwhat we shall all come to!\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured.\r\n\r\nThe other looked in the same direction. \xe2\x80\x98True, neighbour Springrove;\r\ntrue.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTwo men, advancing one behind the other in the middle of the road, were\r\nwhat the farmers referred to. They were carpenters, and bore on their\r\nshoulders an empty coffin, covered by a thin black cloth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I always feel a satisfaction at being breasted by such a sight as\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x99 said Springrove, still regarding the men\xe2\x80\x99s sad burden. \xe2\x80\x98I call it\r\na sort of medicine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And it is medicine.... I have not heard of any body being ill up this\r\nway lately? D\xe2\x80\x99seem as if the person died suddenly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May be so. Ah, Baker, we say sudden death, don\xe2\x80\x99t we? But there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\ndifference in their nature between sudden death and death of any other\r\nsort. There\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as a random snapping off of what was laid\r\ndown to last longer. We only suddenly light upon an end--thoughtfully\r\nformed as any other--which has been existing at that very same point\r\nfrom the beginning, though unseen by us to be so soon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is just a discovery to your own mind, and not an alteration in the\r\nLord\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it. Unexpected is not as to the thing, but as to our sight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now you\xe2\x80\x99ll hardly believe me, neighbour, but this little scene in front\r\nof us makes me feel less anxious about pushing on wi\xe2\x80\x99 that threshing and\r\nwinnowing next week, that I was speaking about. Why should we not stand\r\nstill, says I to myself, and fling a quiet eye upon the Whys and\r\nthe Wherefores, before the end o\xe2\x80\x99 it all, and we go down into the\r\nmouldering-place, and are forgotten?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis a feeling that will come. But \xe2\x80\x98twont bear looking into. There\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nback\xe2\x80\x99ard current in the world, and we must do our utmost to advance in\r\norder just to bide where we be. But, Baker, they are turning in here\r\nwith the coffin, look.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe two carpenters had borne their load into a narrow way close at hand.\r\nThe farmers, in common with others, turned and watched them along the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis a man\xe2\x80\x99s coffin, and a tall man\xe2\x80\x99s, too,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Farmer\r\nSpringrove. \xe2\x80\x98His was a fine frame, whoever he was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A very plain box for the poor soul--just the rough elm, you see.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\ncorner of the cloth had blown aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, for a very poor man. Well, death\xe2\x80\x99s all the less insult to him. I\r\nhave often thought how much smaller the richer class are made to look\r\nthan the poor at last pinches like this. Perhaps the greatest of all\r\nthe reconcilers of a thoughtful man to poverty--and I speak from\r\nexperience--is the grand quiet it fills him with when the uncertainty of\r\nhis life shows itself more than usual.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Springrove finished speaking, the bearers of the coffin went across\r\na gravelled square facing the two men and approached a grim and heavy\r\narchway. They paused beneath it, rang a bell, and waited.\r\n\r\nOver the archway was written in Egyptian capitals,\r\n\r\n                           \xe2\x80\x98COUNTY GAOL.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe small rectangular wicket, which was constructed in one of the\r\ntwo iron-studded doors, was opened from the inside. The men severally\r\nstepped over the threshold, the coffin dragged its melancholy length\r\nthrough the aperture, and both entered the court, and were covered from\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Somebody in the gaol, then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, one of the prisoners,\xe2\x80\x99 said a boy, scudding by at the moment, who\r\npassed on whistling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know the name of the man who is dead?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Baker of a third\r\nbystander.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, \xe2\x80\x98tis all over town--surely you know, Mr. Springrove? Why, Manston,\r\nMiss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s steward. He was found dead the first thing this\r\nmorning. He had hung himself behind the door of his cell, in some way,\r\nby a handkerchief and some strips of his clothes. The turnkey says his\r\nfeatures were scarcely changed, as he looked at \xe2\x80\x98em with the early sun\r\na-shining in at the grating upon him. He has left a full account of the\r\nmurder, and all that led to it. So there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly true: Manston was dead.\r\n\r\nThe previous day he had been allowed the use of writing-materials, and\r\nhad occupied himself for nearly seven hours in preparing the following\r\nconfession:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                         \xe2\x80\x98LAST WORDS.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Having found man\xe2\x80\x99s life to be a wretchedly conceived scheme, I renounce\r\nit, and, to cause no further trouble, I write down the facts connected\r\nwith my past proceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After thanking God, on first entering my house, on the night of the\r\nfire at Carriford, for my release from bondage to a woman I detested,\r\nI went, a second time, to the scene of the disaster, and, finding that\r\nnothing could be done by remaining there, shortly afterwards I returned\r\nhome again in the company of Mr. Raunham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He parted from me at the steps of my porch, and went back towards\r\nthe rectory. Whilst I still stood at the door, musing on my strange\r\ndeliverance, I saw a figure advance from beneath the shadow of the park\r\ntrees. It was the figure of a woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When she came near, the twilight was sufficient to show me her attire:\r\nit was a cloak reaching to the bottom of her dress, and a thick veil\r\ncovering her face. These features, together with her size and gait,\r\naided also by a flash of perception as to the chain of events which had\r\nsaved her life, told me that she was my wife Eunice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I gnashed my teeth in a frenzy of despair; I had lost Cytherea; I had\r\ngained one whose beauty had departed, whose utterance was complaint,\r\nwhose mind was shallow, and who drank brandy every day. The revulsion\r\nof feeling was terrible. Providence, whom I had just thanked, seemed a\r\nmocking tormentor laughing at me. I felt like a madman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She came close--started at seeing me outside--then spoke to me. Her\r\nfirst words were reproof for what I had unintentionally done, and\r\nsounded as an earnest of what I was to be cursed with as long as we both\r\nlived. I answered angrily; this tone of mine changed her complaints\r\nto irritation. She taunted me with a secret she had discovered, which\r\nconcerned Miss Aldclyffe and myself. I was surprised to learn it--more\r\nsurprised that she knew it, but concealed my feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you serve me so?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, her breath smelling of spirits\r\neven then. \xe2\x80\x9cYou love another woman--yes, you do. See how you drive me\r\nabout! I have been to the station, intending to leave you for ever, and\r\nyet I come to try you once more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An indescribable exasperation had sprung up in me as she talked--rage\r\nand regret were all in all. Scarcely knowing what I did, I furiously\r\nraised my hand and swung it round with my whole force to strike her. She\r\nturned quickly--and it was the poor creature\xe2\x80\x99s end. By her movement my\r\nhand came edgewise exactly in the nape of the neck--as men strike a hare\r\nto kill it. The effect staggered me with amazement. The blow must have\r\ndisturbed the vertebrae; she fell at my feet, made a few movements, and\r\nuttered one low sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ran indoors for water and some wine, I came out and lanced her arm\r\nwith my penknife. But she lay still, and I found that she was dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was a long time before I could realize my horrible position. For\r\nseveral minutes I had no idea of attempting to escape the consequences\r\nof my deed. Then a light broke upon me. Had anybody seen her since she\r\nleft the Three Tranters? Had they not, she was already believed by the\r\nparishioners to be dust and ashes. I should never be found out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon this I acted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The first question was how to dispose of the body. The impulse of the\r\nmoment was to bury her at once in the pit between the engine-house and\r\nwaterfall; but it struck me that I should not have time. It was now four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, and the working-men would soon be stirring about the place. I\r\nwould put off burying her till the next night. I carried her indoors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In turning the outhouse into a workshop, earlier in the season, I\r\nfound, when driving a nail into the wall for fixing a cupboard, that the\r\nwall sounded hollow. I examined it, and discovered behind the plaster an\r\nold oven which had long been disused, and was bricked up when the house\r\nwas prepared for me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To unfix this cupboard and pull out the bricks was the work of a few\r\nminutes. Then, bearing in mind that I should have to remove the body\r\nagain the next night, I placed it in a sack, pushed it into the oven,\r\npacked in the bricks, and replaced the cupboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I then went to bed. In bed, I thought whether there were any very\r\nremote possibilities that might lead to the supposition that my wife was\r\nnot consumed by the flames of the burning house. The thing which struck\r\nme most forcibly was this, that the searchers might think it odd that no\r\nremains whatever should be found.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The clinching and triumphant deed would be to take the body and place\r\nit among the ruins of the destroyed house. But I could not do this, on\r\naccount of the men who were watching against an outbreak of the fire.\r\nOne remedy remained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I arose again, dressed myself, and went down to the outhouse. I must\r\ntake down the cupboard again. I did take it down. I pulled out the\r\nbricks, pulled out the sack, pulled out the corpse, and took her keys\r\nfrom her pocket and the watch from her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I then replaced everything as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With these articles in my pocket I went out of the yard, and took my\r\nway through the withy copse to the churchyard, entering it from the\r\nback. Here I felt my way carefully along till I came to the nook where\r\npieces of bones from newly-dug graves are sometimes piled behind the\r\nlaurel-bushes. I had been earnestly hoping to find a skull among these\r\nold bones; but though I had frequently seen one or two in the rubbish\r\nhere, there was not one now. I then groped in the other corner with the\r\nsame result--nowhere could I find a skull. Three or four fragments of\r\nleg and back-bones were all I could collect, and with these I was forced\r\nto be content.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Taking them in my hand, I crossed the road, and got round behind the\r\ninn, where the couch heap was still smouldering. Keeping behind the\r\nhedge, I could see the heads of the three or four men who watched the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Standing in this place I took the bones, and threw them one by one over\r\nthe hedge and over the men\xe2\x80\x99s heads into the smoking embers. When the\r\nbones had all been thrown, I threw the keys; last of all I threw the\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I then returned home as I had gone, and went to bed once more, just as\r\nthe dawn began to break. I exulted--\xe2\x80\x9cCytherea is mine again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At breakfast-time I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose the cupboard should by some\r\nunlikely chance get moved to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I went to the mason\xe2\x80\x99s yard hard by, while the men were at breakfast,\r\nand brought away a shovelful of mortar. I took it into the outhouse,\r\nagain shifted the cupboard, and plastered over the mouth of the oven\r\nbehind. Simply pushing the cupboard back into its place, I waited for\r\nthe next night that I might bury the body, though upon the whole it was\r\nin a tolerably safe hiding-place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When the night came, my nerves were in some way weaker than they had\r\nbeen on the previous night. I felt reluctant to touch the body. I went\r\nto the outhouse, but instead of opening the oven, I firmly drove in\r\nthe shoulder-nails that held the cupboard to the wall. \xe2\x80\x9cI will bury her\r\nto-morrow night, however,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But the next night I was still more reluctant to touch her. And my\r\nreluctance increased, and there the body remained. The oven was, after\r\nall, never likely to be opened in my time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I married Cytherea Graye, and never did a bridegroom leave the church\r\nwith a heart more full of love and happiness, and a brain more fixed on\r\ngood intentions, than I did on that morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s brother made his appearance at the hotel in\r\nSouthampton, bearing his strange evidence of the porter\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure, I\r\nwas staggered beyond expression. I thought they had found the body.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to be apprehended and to lose her even now?\xe2\x80\x9d I mourned. I saw\r\nmy error, and instantly saw, too, that I must act externally like an\r\nhonourable man. So at his request I yielded her up to him, and meditated\r\non several schemes for enabling me to claim the woman I had a legal\r\nright to claim as my wife, without disclosing the reason why I knew\r\nmyself to have it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I went home to Knapwater the next day, and for nearly a week lived in\r\na state of indecision. I could not hit upon a scheme for proving my wife\r\ndead without compromising myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Raunham hinted that I should take steps to discover her whereabouts\r\nby advertising. I had no energy for the farce. But one evening I chanced\r\nto enter the Rising Sun Inn. Two notorious poachers were sitting in\r\nthe settle, which screened my entrance. They were half drunk--their\r\nconversation was carried on in the solemn and emphatic tone common to\r\nthat stage of intoxication, and I myself was the subject of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The following was the substance of their disjointed remarks: On the\r\nnight of the great fire at Carriford, one of them was sent to meet\r\nme, and break the news of the death of my wife to me. This he did;\r\nbut because I would not pay him for his news, he left me in a mood\r\nof vindictiveness. When the fire was over, he joined his comrade. The\r\nfavourable hour of the night suggested to them the possibility of some\r\nunlawful gain before daylight came. My fowlhouse stood in a tempting\r\nposition, and still resenting his repulse during the evening, one of\r\nthem proposed to operate upon my birds. I was believed to have gone to\r\nthe rectory with Mr. Raunham. The other was disinclined to go, and the\r\nfirst went off alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was now about three o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He had advanced as far as the\r\nshrubbery, which grows near the north wall of the house, when he fancied\r\nhe heard, above the rush of the waterfall, noises on the other side\r\nof the building. He described them in these words, \xe2\x80\x9cGhostly mouths\r\ntalking--then a fall--then a groan--then the rush of the water and creak\r\nof the engine as before.\xe2\x80\x9d Only one explanation occurred to him; the\r\nhouse was haunted. And, whether those of the living or the dead, voices\r\nof any kind were inimical to one who had come on such an errand. He\r\nstealthily crept home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His unlawful purpose in being behind the house led him to conceal\r\nhis adventure. No suspicion of the truth entered his mind till the\r\nrailway-porter had startled everybody by his strange announcement. Then\r\nhe asked himself, had the horrifying sounds of that night been really an\r\nenactment in the flesh between me and my wife?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The words of the other man were:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t he try to find her if she\xe2\x80\x99s alive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t forget what I heard, and if she\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t turn up alive my mind will be as sure as a Bible upon her\r\nmurder, and the parson shall know it, though I do get six months on the\r\ntreadmill for being where I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if she should turn up alive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThen I shall know that I am wrong, and believing myself a fool as well\r\nas a rogue, hold my tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I glided out of the house in a cold sweat. The only pressure in heaven\r\nor earth which could have forced me to renounce Cytherea was now put\r\nupon me--the dread of a death upon the gallows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I sat all that night weaving strategy of various kinds. The only\r\neffectual remedy for my hazardous standing that I could see was a\r\nsimple one. It was to substitute another woman for my wife before the\r\nsuspicions of that one easily-hoodwinked man extended further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The only difficulty was to find a practicable substitute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The one woman at all available for the purpose was a friendless,\r\ninnocent creature, named Anne Seaway, whom I had known in my youth,\r\nand who had for some time been the housekeeper of a lady in London. On\r\naccount of this lady\xe2\x80\x99s sudden death, Anne stood in rather a precarious\r\nposition, as regarded her future subsistence. She was not the best kind\r\nof woman for the scheme; but there was no alternative. One quality of\r\nhers was valuable; she was not a talker. I went to London the very next\r\nday, called at the Hoxton lodging of my wife (the only place at\r\nwhich she had been known as Mrs. Manston), and found that no great\r\ndifficulties stood in the way of a personation. And thus favouring\r\ncircumstances determined my course. I visited Anne Seaway, made love to\r\nher, and propounded my plan.\r\n\r\n              *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We lived quietly enough until the Sunday before my apprehension. Anne\r\ncame home from church that morning, and told me of the suspicious way in\r\nwhich a young man had looked at her there. Nothing could be done beyond\r\nwaiting the issue of events. Then the letter came from Raunham. For the\r\nfirst time in my life I was half indifferent as to what fate awaited me.\r\nDuring the succeeding day I thought once or twice of running away, but\r\ncould not quite make up my mind. At any rate it would be best to bury\r\nthe body of my wife, I thought, for the oven might be opened at any\r\ntime. I went to Casterbridge and made some arrangements. In the evening\r\nMiss Aldclyffe (who is united to me by a common secret which I have no\r\nright or wish to disclose) came to my house, and alarmed me still more.\r\nShe said that she could tell by Mr. Raunham\xe2\x80\x99s manner that evening, that\r\nhe kept back from her a suspicion of more importance even than the one\r\nhe spoke of, and that strangers were in his house even then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I guessed what this further suspicion was, and resolved to enlighten\r\nher to a certain extent, and so secure her assistance. I said that I\r\nkilled my wife by an accident on the night of the fire, dwelling upon\r\nthe advantage to her of the death of the only woman who knew her secret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her terror, and fears for my fate, led her to watch the rectory\r\nthat evening. She saw the detective leave it, and followed him to my\r\nresidence. This she told me hurriedly when I perceived her after digging\r\nmy wife\xe2\x80\x99s grave in the plantation. She did not suspect what the sack\r\ncontained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am now about to enter on my normal condition. For people are almost\r\nalways in their graves. When we survey the long race of men, it is\r\nstrange and still more strange to find that they are mainly dead men,\r\nwho have scarcely ever been otherwise.\r\n\r\n                                              \xe2\x80\x98AENEAS MANSTON.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nThe steward\xe2\x80\x99s confession, aided by circumstantial evidence of various\r\nkinds, was the means of freeing both Anne Seaway and Miss Aldclyffe from\r\nall suspicion of complicity with the murderer.\r\n\r\n2. SIX O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK P.M.\r\n\r\nIt was evening--just at sunset--on the day of Manston\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\nIn the cottage at Tolchurch was gathered a group consisting of Cytherea,\r\nher brother, Edward Springrove, and his father. They sat by the\r\nwindow conversing of the strange events which had just taken place. In\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s eye there beamed a hopeful ray, though her face was as white\r\nas a lily.\r\n\r\nWhilst they talked, looking out at the yellow evening light that coated\r\nthe hedges, trees, and church tower, a brougham rolled round the corner\r\nof the lane, and came in full view. It reflected the rays of the sun in\r\na flash from its polished panels as it turned the angle, the spokes of\r\nthe wheels bristling in the same light like bayonets. The vehicle came\r\nnearer, and arrived opposite Owen\xe2\x80\x99s door, when the driver pulled the\r\nrein and gave a shout, and the panting and sweating horses stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s carriage!\xe2\x80\x99 they all exclaimed.\r\n\r\nOwen went out. \xe2\x80\x98Is Miss Graye at home?\xe2\x80\x99 said the man. \xe2\x80\x98A note for her,\r\nand I am to wait for an answer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea read in the handwriting of the Rector of Carriford:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98DEAR MISS GRAYE,--Miss Aldclyffe is ill, though not dangerously. She\r\ncontinually repeats your name, and now wishes very much to see you.\r\nIf you possibly can, come in the carriage.--Very sincerely yours, JOHN\r\nRAUNHAM.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How comes she ill?\xe2\x80\x99 Owen inquired of the coachman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She caught a violent cold by standing out of doors in the damp, on\r\nthe night the steward ran away. Ever since, till this morning, she\r\ncomplained of fulness and heat in the chest. This morning the maid ran\r\nin and told her suddenly that Manston had killed himself in gaol--she\r\nshrieked--broke a blood-vessel--and fell upon the floor. Severe internal\r\nhaemorrhage continued for some time and then stopped. They say she is\r\nsure to get over it; but she herself says no. She has suffered from it\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea was ready in a few moments, and entered the carriage.\r\n\r\n3. SEVEN O\xe2\x80\x99CLOCK P.M.\r\n\r\nSoft as was Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s motion along the corridors of Knapwater House,\r\nthe preternaturally keen intelligence of the suffering woman caught\r\nthe maiden\xe2\x80\x99s well-known footfall. She entered the sick-chamber with\r\nsuspended breath.\r\n\r\nIn the room everything was so still, and sensation was as it were so\r\nrarefied by solicitude, that thinking seemed acting, and the lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nweak act of trying to live a silent wrestling with all the powers of the\r\nuniverse. Nobody was present but Mr. Raunham, the nurse having left the\r\nroom on Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s entry, and the physician and surgeon being engaged\r\nin a whispered conversation in a side-chamber. Their patient had been\r\npronounced out of danger.\r\n\r\nCytherea went to the bedside, and was instantly recognized. O, what a\r\nchange--Miss Aldclyffe dependent upon pillows! And yet not a forbidding\r\nchange. With weakness had come softness of aspect: the haughtiness was\r\nextracted from the frail thin countenance, and a sweeter mild placidity\r\nhad taken its place.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe signified to Mr. Raunham that she would like to be alone\r\nwith Cytherea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cytherea?\xe2\x80\x99 she faintly whispered the instant the door was closed.\r\n\r\nCytherea clasped the lady\xe2\x80\x99s weak hand, and sank beside her.\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe whispered again. \xe2\x80\x98They say I am certain to live; but I\r\nknow that I am certainly going to die.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They know, I think, and hope.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know best, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave that. Cytherea--O Cytherea, can you\r\nforgive me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer companion pressed her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet--you don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet,\xe2\x80\x99 the invalid murmured. \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nis forgiveness for that misrepresentation to Edward Springrove that I\r\nimplore, and for putting such force upon him--that which caused all the\r\ntrain of your innumerable ills!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know all--all. And I do forgive you. Not in a hasty impulse that is\r\nrevoked when coolness comes, but deliberately and sincerely: as I myself\r\nhope to be forgiven, I accord you my forgiveness now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTears streamed from Miss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and mingled with those of her\r\nyoung companion, who could not restrain hers for sympathy. Expressions\r\nof strong attachment, interrupted by emotion, burst again and again from\r\nthe broken-spirited woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you don\xe2\x80\x99t know my motive. O, if you only knew it, how you would\r\npity me then!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea did not break the pause which ensued, and the elder woman\r\nappeared now to nerve herself by a superhuman effort. She spoke on in a\r\nvoice weak as a summer breeze, and full of intermission, and yet there\r\npervaded it a steadiness of intention that seemed to demand firm tones\r\nto bear it out worthily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cytherea,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98listen to me before I die.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A long time ago--more than thirty years ago--a young girl of seventeen\r\nwas cruelly betrayed by her cousin, a wild officer of six-and-twenty. He\r\nwent to India, and died.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One night when that miserable girl had just arrived home with her\r\nparents from Germany, where her baby had been born, she took all the\r\nmoney she possessed, pinned it on her infant\xe2\x80\x99s bosom, together with\r\na letter, stating, among other things, what she wished the child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nChristian name to be; wrapped up the little thing, and walked with it to\r\nClapham. Here, in a retired street, she selected a house. She placed\r\nthe child on the doorstep and knocked at the door, then ran away and\r\nwatched. They took it up and carried it indoors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now that her poor baby was gone, the girl blamed herself bitterly for\r\ncruelty towards it, and wished she had adopted her parents\xe2\x80\x99 counsel to\r\nsecretly hire a nurse. She longed to see it. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do.\r\nShe wrote in an assumed name to the woman who had taken it in, and asked\r\nher to meet the writer with the infant at certain places she named.\r\nThese were hotels or coffee-houses in Chelsea, Pimlico, or Hammersmith.\r\nThe woman, being well paid, always came, and asked no questions. At one\r\nmeeting--at an inn in Hammersmith--she made her appearance without the\r\nchild, and told the girl it was so ill that it would not live through\r\nthe night. The news, and fatigue, brought on a fainting-fit....\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s sobs choked her utterance, and she became painfully\r\nagitated. Cytherea, pale and amazed at what she heard, wept for her,\r\nbent over her, and begged her not to go on speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--I must,\xe2\x80\x99 she cried, between her sobs. \xe2\x80\x98I will--I must go on! And\r\nI must tell yet more plainly!... you must hear it before I am gone,\r\nCytherea.\xe2\x80\x99 The sympathizing and astonished girl sat down again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The name of the woman who had taken the child was _Manston_. She was\r\nthe widow of a schoolmaster. She said she had adopted the child of a\r\nrelation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only one man ever found out who the mother was. He was the keeper of\r\nthe inn in which she fainted, and his silence she has purchased ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A twelvemonth passed--fifteen months--and the saddened girl met a\r\nman at her father\xe2\x80\x99s house named Graye--your father, Cytherea, then\r\nunmarried. Ah, such a man! Inexperience now perceived what it was to\r\nbe loved in spirit and in truth! But it was too late. Had he known her\r\nsecret he would have cast her out. She withdrew from him by an effort,\r\nand pined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Years and years afterwards, when she became mistress of a fortune and\r\nestates by her father\xe2\x80\x99s death, she formed the weak scheme of having near\r\nher the son whom, in her father\xe2\x80\x99s life-time, she had been forbidden to\r\nrecognize. Cytherea, you know who that weak woman is.\r\n\r\n              *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By such toilsome labour as this I got him here as my steward. And I\r\nwanted to see him _your husband_, Cytherea!--the husband of my true\r\nlover\xe2\x80\x99s child. It was a sweet dream to me.... Pity me--O, pity me! To\r\ndie unloved is more than I can bear! I loved your father, and I love him\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was the burden of Cytherea Aldclyffe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose you must leave me again--you always leave me,\xe2\x80\x99 she said,\r\nafter holding the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand a long while in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--indeed I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay always. Do you like me to stay?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Aldclyffe in the jaws of death was Miss Aldclyffe still, though the\r\nold fire had degenerated to mere phosphorescence now. \xe2\x80\x98But you are your\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeper?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, of course you cannot stay with me on a sudden like this.... Go\r\nhome, or he will be at a loss for things. And to-morrow morning come\r\nagain, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, dearest, come again--we\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch you. But you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstay now, and put Owen out. O no--it would be absurd.\xe2\x80\x99 The absorbing\r\nconcern about trifles of daily routine, which is so often seen in very\r\nsick people, was present here.\r\n\r\nCytherea promised to go home, and come the next morning to stay\r\ncontinuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay till I die then, will you not? Yes, till I die--I shan\xe2\x80\x99t die till\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We hope for your recovery--all of us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know best. Come at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, darling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As soon as ever I can,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Cytherea tenderly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But six is too early--you will have to think of your brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreakfast. Leave Tolchurch at eight, will you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCytherea consented to this. Miss Aldclyffe would never have known\r\nhad her companion stayed in the house all night; but the honesty of\r\nCytherea\xe2\x80\x99s nature rebelled against even the friendly deceit which such a\r\nproceeding would have involved.\r\n\r\nAn arrangement was come to whereby she was to be taken home in the\r\npony-carriage instead of the brougham that fetched her; the carriage\r\nto put up at Tolchurch farm for the night, and on that account to be in\r\nreadiness to bring her back earlier.\r\n\r\n4. MARCH THE THIRTIETH. DAYBREAK\r\n\r\nThe third and last instance of Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s subjection to those periodic\r\nterrors of the night which had emphasized her connection with the\r\nAldclyffe name and blood occurred at the present date.\r\n\r\nIt was about four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning when Cytherea, though most\r\nprobably dreaming, seemed to awake--and instantly was transfixed by a\r\nsort of spell, that had in it more of awe than of affright. At the\r\nfoot of her bed, looking her in the face with an expression of\r\nentreaty beyond the power of words to portray, was the form of Miss\r\nAldclyffe--wan and distinct. No motion was perceptible in her; but\r\nlonging--earnest longing--was written in every feature.\r\n\r\nCytherea believed she exercised her waking judgment as usual in\r\nthinking, without a shadow of doubt, that Miss Aldclyffe stood before\r\nher in flesh and blood. Reason was not sufficiently alert to lead\r\nCytherea to ask herself how such a thing could have occurred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would have remained with you--why would you not allow me to stay!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nCytherea exclaimed. The spell was broken: she became broadly awake; and\r\nthe figure vanished.\r\n\r\nIt was in the grey time of dawn. She trembled in a sweat of disquiet,\r\nand not being able to endure the thought of her brother being asleep,\r\nshe went and tapped at his door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Owen!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was not a heavy sleeper, and it was verging upon his time to rise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you want, Cytherea?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ought not to have left Knapwater last night. I wish I had not. I\r\nreally think I will start at once. She wants me, I know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What time is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A few minutes past four.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better not. Keep to the time agreed upon. Consider, we should\r\nhave such a trouble in rousing the driver, and other things.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUpon the whole it seemed wiser not to act on a mere fancy. She went to\r\nbed again.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, when Owen was thinking of getting up, a knocking came to\r\nthe front door. The next minute something touched the glass of Owen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwindow. He waited--the noise was repeated. A little gravel had been\r\nthrown against it to arouse him.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the room, pulled up the blind, and looked out. A solemn white\r\nface was gazing upwards from the road, expectantly straining to catch\r\nthe first glimpse of a person within the panes. It was the face of a\r\nKnapwater man sitting on horseback.\r\n\r\nOwen saw his errand. There is an unmistakable look in the face of every\r\nman who brings tidings of death. Graye opened the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Aldclyffe....\xe2\x80\x99 said the messenger, and paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--dead?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--she is dead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When did she die?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At ten minutes past four, after another effusion. She knew best, you\r\nsee, sir. I started directly, by the rector\xe2\x80\x99s orders.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEQUEL\r\n\r\nFifteen months have passed, and we are brought on to Midsummer Night,\r\n1867.\r\n\r\nThe picture presented is the interior of the old belfry of Carriford\r\nChurch, at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nSix Carriford men and one stranger are gathered there, beneath the light\r\nof a flaring candle stuck on a piece of wood against the wall. The six\r\nCarriford men are the well-known ringers of the fine-toned old bells in\r\nthe key of F, which have been music to the ears of Carriford parish and\r\nthe outlying districts for the last four hundred years. The stranger is\r\nan assistant, who has appeared from nobody knows where.\r\n\r\nThe six natives--in their shirt-sleeves, and without hats--pull and\r\ncatch frantically at the dancing bellropes, the locks of their hair\r\nwaving in the breeze created by their quick motions; the stranger, who\r\nhas the treble bell, does likewise, but in his right mind and coat.\r\nTheir ever-changing shadows mingle on the wall in an endless variety of\r\nkaleidoscopic forms, and the eyes of all the seven are religiously fixed\r\non a diagram like a large addition sum, which is chalked on the floor.\r\n\r\nVividly contrasting with the yellow light of the candle upon the four\r\nunplastered walls of the tower, and upon the faces and clothes of the\r\nmen, is the scene discernible through the screen beneath the tower\r\narchway. At the extremity of the long mysterious avenue of the nave and\r\nchancel can be seen shafts of moonlight streaming in at the east window\r\nof the church--blue, phosphoric, and ghostly.\r\n\r\nA thorough renovation of the bell-ringing machinery and accessories had\r\ntaken place in anticipation of an interesting event. New ropes had been\r\nprovided; every bell had been carefully shifted from its carriage, and\r\nthe pivots lubricated. Bright red \xe2\x80\x98sallies\xe2\x80\x99 of woollen texture--soft\r\nto the hands and easily caught--glowed on the ropes in place of the old\r\nragged knots, all of which newness in small details only rendered more\r\nevident the irrepressible aspect of age in the mass surrounding them.\r\n\r\nThe triple-bob-major was ended, and the ringers wiped their faces and\r\nrolled down their shirt-sleeves, previously to tucking away the ropes\r\nand leaving the place for the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Piph--h--h--h! A good forty minutes,\xe2\x80\x99 said a man with a streaming face,\r\nand blowing out his breath--one of the pair who had taken the tenor\r\nbell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Our friend here pulled proper well--that \xe2\x80\x98a did--seeing he\xe2\x80\x99s but a\r\nstranger,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clerk Crickett, who had just resigned the second rope,\r\nand addressing the man in the black coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99A did,\xe2\x80\x99 said the rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I enjoyed it much,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man modestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What we should ha\xe2\x80\x99 done without you words can\xe2\x80\x99t tell. The man that\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99belong by rights to that there bell is ill o\xe2\x80\x99 two gallons o\xe2\x80\x99 wold\r\ncider.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now so\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked the fifth ringer, as pertaining to the last\r\nallusion, \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99ll finish this drop o\xe2\x80\x99 metheglin and cider, and every man\r\nhome--along straight as a line.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wi\xe2\x80\x99 all my heart,\xe2\x80\x99 Clerk Crickett replied. \xe2\x80\x98And the Lord send if I\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t done my duty by Master Teddy Springrove--that I have so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the rest o\xe2\x80\x99 us,\xe2\x80\x99 they said, as the cup was handed round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay--in ringen--but I was spaken in a spiritual sense o\xe2\x80\x99 this\r\nmornen\xe2\x80\x99s business o\xe2\x80\x99 mine up by the chancel rails there. \xe2\x80\x98Twas very\r\nconvenient to lug her here and marry her instead o\xe2\x80\x99 doen it at that\r\ntwopenny-halfpenny town o\xe2\x80\x99 Budm\xe2\x80\x99th. Very convenient.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very. There was a little fee for Master Crickett.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--well. Money\xe2\x80\x99s money--very much so--very--I always have said it. But\r\n\xe2\x80\x98twas a pretty sight for the nation. He coloured up like any maid, that\r\n\xe2\x80\x98a did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well enough \xe2\x80\x98a mid colour up. \xe2\x80\x98Tis no small matter for a man to play\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 fire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whatever it may be to a woman,\xe2\x80\x99 said the clerk absently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou\xe2\x80\x99rt thinken o\xe2\x80\x99 thy wife, clerk,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gad Weedy. \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99ll play wi\xe2\x80\x99it\r\nagain when thou\xe2\x80\x99st got mildewed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well--let her, God bless her; for I\xe2\x80\x99m but a poor third man, I. The Lord\r\nhave mercy upon the fourth!... Ay, Teddy\xe2\x80\x99s got his own at last. What\r\nlittle white ears that maid hev, to be sure! choose your wife as you\r\nchoose your pig--a small ear and a small tale--that was always my joke\r\nwhen I was a merry feller, ah--years agone now! But Teddy\xe2\x80\x99s got her.\r\nPoor chap, he was getten as thin as a hermit wi\xe2\x80\x99 grief--so was she.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Maybe she\xe2\x80\x99ll pick up now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True--\xe2\x80\x98tis nater\xe2\x80\x99s law, which no man shall gainsay. Ah, well do I bear\r\nin mind what I said to Pa\xe2\x80\x99son Raunham, about thy mother\xe2\x80\x99s family o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nseven, Gad, the very first week of his comen here, when I was just in my\r\nprime. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how many daughters has that poor Weedy got, clerk?\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cand every one of \xe2\x80\x98em has a brother!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPoor woman,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n says he, \xe2\x80\x9ca dozen children!--give her this half-sovereign from me,\r\nclerk.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x98A laughed a good five minutes afterwards, when he found out my\r\nmerry nater--\xe2\x80\x98a did. But there, \xe2\x80\x98tis over wi\xe2\x80\x99 me now. Enteren the Church\r\nis the ruin of a man\xe2\x80\x99s wit for wit\xe2\x80\x99s nothen without a faint shadder o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If so be Teddy and the lady had been kept apart for life, they\xe2\x80\x99d both\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 died,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gad emphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But now instead o\xe2\x80\x99 death there\xe2\x80\x99ll be increase o\xe2\x80\x99 life,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the\r\nclerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It all went proper well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fifth bell-ringer. \xe2\x80\x98They didn\xe2\x80\x99t flee\r\noff to Babylonish places--not they.\xe2\x80\x99 He struck up an attitude--\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMaster Springrove standen so: here\xe2\x80\x99s the married woman standen likewise;\r\nhere they d\xe2\x80\x99walk across to Knapwater House; and there they d\xe2\x80\x99bide in the\r\nchimley corner, hard and fast.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, \xe2\x80\x98twas a pretty wedden, and well attended,\xe2\x80\x99 added the clerk. \xe2\x80\x98Here\r\nwas my lady herself--red as scarlet: here was Master Springrove, looken\r\nas if he half wished he\xe2\x80\x99d never a-come--ah, poor souls!--the men always\r\ndo! The women do stand it best--the maid was in her glory. Though she\r\nwas so shy the glory shone plain through that shy skin. Ah, it did\r\nso\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gad, \xe2\x80\x98and there was Tim Tankins and his five journeymen\r\ncarpenters, standen on tiptoe and peepen in at the chancel winders.\r\nThere was Dairyman Dodman waiten in his new spring-cart to see \xe2\x80\x98em come\r\nout--whip in hand--that \xe2\x80\x98a was. Then up comes two master tailors.\r\nThen there was Christopher Runt wi\xe2\x80\x99 his pickaxe and shovel. There was\r\nwimmen-folk and there was men-folk traypsen up and down church\xe2\x80\x99ard till\r\nthey wore a path wi\xe2\x80\x99 traypsen so--letten the squallen children slip down\r\nthrough their arms and nearly skinnen o\xe2\x80\x99 em. And these were all over and\r\nabove the gentry and Sunday-clothes folk inside. Well, I seed Mr. Graye\r\nat last dressed up quite the dand. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Graye,\xe2\x80\x9d says I from the\r\ntop o\xe2\x80\x99 church\xe2\x80\x99ard wall, \xe2\x80\x9chow\xe2\x80\x99s yerself?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Graye never spoke--he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nprided away his hearen. Seize the man, I didn\xe2\x80\x99 want en to spak. Teddy\r\nhears it, and turns round: \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Gad!\xe2\x80\x9d says he, and laughed like a\r\nboy. There\xe2\x80\x99s more in Teddy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clerk Crickett, turning to the man in black, \xe2\x80\x98now you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen among us so long, and d\xe2\x80\x99know us so well, won\xe2\x80\x99t ye tell us what\r\nye\xe2\x80\x99ve come here for, and what your trade is?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am no trade,\xe2\x80\x99 said the thin man, smiling, \xe2\x80\x98and I came to see the\r\nwickedness of the land.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I said thou wast one o\xe2\x80\x99 the devil\xe2\x80\x99s brood wi\xe2\x80\x99 thy black clothes,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreplied a sturdy ringer, who had not spoken before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, the truth is,\xe2\x80\x99 said the thin man, retracting at this horrible\r\ntranslation, \xe2\x80\x98I came for a walk because it is a fine evening.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now let\xe2\x80\x99s be off, neighbours,\xe2\x80\x99 the clerk interrupted.\r\n\r\nThe candle was inverted in the socket, and the whole party stepped out\r\ninto the churchyard. The moon was shining within a day or two of full,\r\nand just overlooked the three or four vast yews that stood on the\r\nsouth-east side of the church, and rose in unvaried and flat darkness\r\nagainst the illuminated atmosphere behind them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-night,\xe2\x80\x99 the clerk said to his comrades, when the door was locked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My nearest way is through the park.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose mine is too?\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger. \xe2\x80\x98I am going to the\r\nrailway-station.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course--come on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe two men went over a stile to the west, the remainder of the party\r\ngoing into the road on the opposite side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so the romance has ended well,\xe2\x80\x99 the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s companion remarked,\r\nas they brushed along through the grass. \xe2\x80\x98But what is the truth of the\r\nstory about the property?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now look here, neighbour,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clerk Crickett, \xe2\x80\x98if so be you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nme what your line o\xe2\x80\x99 life is, and your purpose in comen here to-day,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the truth about the wedden particulars.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well--I will when you have done,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis a bargain; and this is the right o\xe2\x80\x99 the story. When Miss\r\nAldclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s will was opened, it was found to have been drawn up on the\r\nvery day that Manston (her love-child) married Miss Cytherea Graye. And\r\nthis is what that deep woman did. Deep? she was as deep as the North\r\nStar. She bequeathed all her property, real and personal, to \xe2\x80\x9cTHE WIFE\r\nOF AENEAS MANSTON\xe2\x80\x9d (with one exception): failen her life to her husband:\r\nfailen his life to the heirs of his head--body I would say: failen\r\nthem to her absolutely and her heirs for ever: failen these to Pa\xe2\x80\x99son\r\nRaunham, and so on to the end o\xe2\x80\x99 the human race. Now do you see the\r\ndepth of her scheme? Why, although upon the surface it appeared her\r\nwhole property was for Miss Cytherea, by the word \xe2\x80\x9cwife\xe2\x80\x9d being used,\r\nand not Cytherea\xe2\x80\x99s name, whoever was the wife o\xe2\x80\x99 Manston would come\r\nin for\xe2\x80\x99t. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that rale depth? It was done, of course, that her\r\nson AEneas, under any circumstances, should be master o\xe2\x80\x99 the property,\r\nwithout folk knowen it was her son or suspecting anything, as they would\r\nif it had been left to en straightway.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A clever arrangement! And what was the exception?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The payment of a legacy to her relative, Pa\xe2\x80\x99son Raunham.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And Miss Cytherea was now Manston\xe2\x80\x99s widow and only relative, and\r\ninherited all absolutely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True, she did. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says she, \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t have it\xe2\x80\x9d (she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nthe notion o\xe2\x80\x99 getten anything through Manston, naturally enough, pretty\r\ndear). She waived her right in favour o\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Raunham. Now, if there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na man in the world that d\xe2\x80\x99care nothen about land--I don\xe2\x80\x99t say there is,\r\nbut _if_ there is--\xe2\x80\x98tis our pa\xe2\x80\x99son. He\xe2\x80\x99s like a snail. He\xe2\x80\x99s a-growed so\r\nto the shape o\xe2\x80\x99 that there rectory that \xe2\x80\x98a wouldn\xe2\x80\x99 think o\xe2\x80\x99 leaven it\r\neven in name. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis yours, Miss Graye,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, \xe2\x80\x98tis yours,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nshe. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 mine,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. The Crown had cast his eyes upon the case,\r\nthinken o\xe2\x80\x99 forfeiture by felony--but \xe2\x80\x98twas no such thing, and \xe2\x80\x98a gied\r\nit up, too. Did you ever hear such a tale?--three people, a man and\r\na woman, and a Crown--neither o\xe2\x80\x99 em in a madhouse--flingen an estate\r\nbackwards and forwards like an apple or nut? Well, it ended in this way.\r\nMr. Raunham took it: young Springrove was had as agent and steward, and\r\nput to live in Knapwater House, close here at hand--just as if \xe2\x80\x98twas\r\nhis own. He does just what he\xe2\x80\x99d like--Mr. Raunham never interferen--and\r\nhither to-day he\xe2\x80\x99s brought his new wife, Cytherea. And a settlement ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbeen drawn up this very day, whereby their children, heirs, and cetrer,\r\nbe to inherit after Mr. Raunham\xe2\x80\x99s death. Good fortune came at last. Her\r\nbrother, too, is doen well. He came in first man in some architectural\r\ncompetition, and is about to move to London. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the house, look.\r\nStap out from these bushes, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a clear sight o\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey emerged from the shrubbery, breaking off towards the lake, and down\r\nthe south slope. When they arrived exactly opposite the centre of the\r\nmansion, they halted.\r\n\r\nIt was a magnificent picture of the English country-house. The whole of\r\nthe severe regular front, with its columns and cornices, was built of a\r\nwhite smoothly-faced freestone, which appeared in the rays of the moon\r\nas pure as Pentelic marble. The sole objects in the scene rivalling the\r\nfairness of the facade were a dozen swans floating upon the lake.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the central door at the top of the steps was opened, and\r\ntwo figures advanced into the light. Two contrasting figures were they.\r\nA young lithe woman in an airy fairy dress--Cytherea Springrove: a young\r\nman in black stereotype raiment--Edward, her husband.\r\n\r\nThey stood at the top of the steps together, looking at the moon, the\r\nwater, and the general loveliness of the prospect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the married man and wife--there, I\xe2\x80\x99ve illustrated my story by\r\nrale liven specimens,\xe2\x80\x99 the clerk whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure, how close together they do stand! You couldn\xe2\x80\x99 slip a\r\npenny-piece between \xe2\x80\x98em--that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99! Beautiful to see it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit--beautiful!... But this is a private path, and we won\xe2\x80\x99t let \xe2\x80\x98em see\r\nus, as all the ringers be goen there to a supper and dance to-morrow\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe speaker and his companion softly moved on, passed through the\r\nwicket, and into the coach-road. Arrived at the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s house at the\r\nfurther boundary of the park, they paused to part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now for your half o\xe2\x80\x99 the bargain,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clerk Crickett. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nline o\xe2\x80\x99 life, and what d\xe2\x80\x99ye come here for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m the reporter to the Casterbridge Chronicle, and I come to pick up\r\nthe news. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Edward and Cytherea, after lingering on the steps for several\r\nminutes, slowly descended the slope to the lake. The skiff was lying\r\nalongside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, Edward,\xe2\x80\x99 said Cytherea, \xe2\x80\x98you must do something that has just come\r\ninto my head!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, dearest--I know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--give me one half-minute\xe2\x80\x99s row on the lake here now, just as you\r\ndid on Budmouth Bay three years ago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe handed her into the boat, and almost noiselessly pulled off from\r\nshore. When they were half-way between the two margins of the lake, he\r\npaused and looked at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, darling, I remember exactly how I kissed you that first time,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nSpringrove. \xe2\x80\x98You were there as you are now. I unshipped the sculls in\r\nthis way. Then I turned round and sat beside you--in this way. Then I\r\nput my hand on the other side of your little neck--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think it was just on my cheek, in this way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, so it was. Then you moved that soft red mouth round to mine--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, dearest--you pressed it round if you remember; and of course I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t then help letting it come to your mouth without being unkind to\r\nyou, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And then I put my cheek against that cheek, and turned my two lips\r\nround upon those two lips, and kissed them--so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Desperate Remedies, by Thomas Hardy\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DESPERATE REMEDIES ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 3044-0.txt or 3044-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/4/3044/\r\n\r\nProduced by Les Bowler\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
