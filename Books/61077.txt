He leaned in his carven chair and heard their spokesman.\r\n\r\nAnd thus their spokesman said.\r\n\r\n"For seven hundred years the chiefs of your race have ruled us well; and\r\ntheir deeds are remembered by the minor minstrels, living on yet in\r\ntheir little tinkling songs. And yet the generations stream away, and\r\nthere is no new thing."\r\n\r\n"What would you?" said the lord.\r\n\r\n"We would be ruled by a magic lord," they said.\r\n\r\n"So be it," said the lord. "It is five hundred years since my people\r\nhave spoken thus in parliament, and it shall always be as your\r\nparliament saith. You have spoken. So be it."\r\n\r\nAnd he raised his hand and blessed them and they went.\r\n\r\nThey went back to their ancient crafts, to the fitting of iron to the\r\nhooves of horses, to working upon leather, to tending flowers, to\r\nministering to the rugged needs of Earth; they followed the ancient\r\nways, and looked for a new thing. But the old lord sent a word to his\r\neldest son, bidding him come before him.\r\n\r\nAnd very soon the young man stood before him, in that same carven chair\r\nfrom which he had not moved, where light, growing late, from high\r\nwindows, showed the aged eyes looking far into the future beyond that\r\nold lord\'s time. And seated there he gave his son his commandment.\r\n\r\n"Go forth," he said, "before these days of mine are over, and therefore\r\ngo in haste, and go from here eastwards and pass the fields we know,\r\ntill you see the lands that clearly pertain to faery; and cross their\r\nboundary, which is made of twilight, and come to that palace that is\r\nonly told of in song."\r\n\r\n"It is far from here," said the young man Alveric.\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered he, "it is far."\r\n\r\n"And further still," the young man said, "to return. For distances in\r\nthose fields are not as here."\r\n\r\n"Even so," said his father.\r\n\r\n"What do you bid me do," said the son, "when I come to that palace?"\r\n\r\nAnd his father said: "To wed the King of Elfland\'s daughter."\r\n\r\nThe young man thought of her beauty and crown of ice, and the sweetness\r\nthat fabulous runes had told was hers. Songs were sung of her on wild\r\nhills where tiny strawberries grew, at dusk and by early starlight, and\r\nif one sought the singer no man was there. Sometimes only her name was\r\nsung softly over and over. Her name was Lirazel.\r\n\r\nShe was a princess of the magic line. The gods had sent their shadows to\r\nher christening, and the fairies too would have gone, but that they were\r\nfrightened to see on their dewy fields the long dark moving shadows of\r\nthe gods, so they stayed hidden in crowds of pale pink anemones, and\r\nthence blessed Lirazel.\r\n\r\n"My people demand a magic lord to rule over them. They have chosen\r\nfoolishly," the old lord said, "and only the Dark Ones that show not\r\ntheir faces know all that this will bring: but we, who see not, follow\r\nthe ancient custom and do what our people in their parliament say. It\r\nmay be some spirit of wisdom they have not known may save them even yet.\r\nGo then with your face turned towards that light that beats from\r\nfairyland, and that faintly illumines the dusk between sunset and early\r\nstars, and this shall guide you till you come to the frontier and have\r\npassed the fields we know."\r\n\r\nThen he unbuckled a strap and a girdle of leather and gave his huge\r\nsword to his son, saying: "This that has brought our family down the\r\nages unto this day shall surely guard you always upon your journey, even\r\nthough you fare beyond the fields we know."\r\n\r\nAnd the young man took it though he knew that no such sword could avail\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNear the Castle of Erl there lived a lonely witch, on high land near the\r\nthunder, which used to roll in Summer along the hills. There she dwelt\r\nby herself in a narrow cottage of thatch and roamed the high fields\r\nalone to gather the thunderbolts. Of these thunderbolts, that had no\r\nearthly forging, were made, with suitable runes, such weapons as had to\r\nparry unearthly dangers.\r\n\r\nAnd alone would roam this witch at certain tides of Spring, taking the\r\nform of a young girl in her beauty, singing among tall flowers in\r\ngardens of Erl. She would go at the hour when hawk-moths first pass from\r\nbell to bell. And of those few that had seen her was this son of the\r\nLord of Erl. And though it was calamity to love her, though it rapt\r\nmen\'s thoughts away from all things true, yet the beauty of the form\r\nthat was not hers had lured him to gaze at her with deep young eyes,\r\ntill--whether flattery or pity moved her, who knows that is mortal?--she\r\nspared him whom her arts might well have destroyed and, changing\r\ninstantly in that garden there, showed him the rightful form of a deadly\r\nwitch. And even then his eyes did not at once forsake her, and in the\r\nmoments that his glance still lingered upon that withered shape that\r\nhaunted the hollyhocks he had her gratitude that may not be bought, nor\r\nwon by any charms that Christians know. And she had beckoned to him and\r\nhe had followed, and learned from her on her thunder-haunted hill that\r\non the day of need a sword might be made of metals not sprung from\r\nEarth, with runes along it that would waft away, certainly any thrust of\r\nearthly sword, and except for three master-runes could thwart the\r\nweapons of Elfland.\r\n\r\nAs he took his father\'s sword the young man thought of the witch.\r\n\r\nIt was scarcely dark in the valley when he left the Castle of Erl, and\r\nwent so swiftly up the witch\'s hill that a dim light lingered yet on its\r\nhighest heaths when he came near the cottage of the one that he sought,\r\nand found her burning bones at a fire in the open. To her he said that\r\nthe day of his need was come. And she bade him gather thunderbolts in\r\nher garden, in the soft earth under her cabbages.\r\n\r\nAnd there with eyes that saw every minute more dimly, and fingers that\r\ngrew accustomed to the thunderbolts\' curious surfaces, he found before\r\ndarkness came down on him seventeen: and these he heaped into a silken\r\nkerchief and carried back to the witch.\r\n\r\nOn the grass beside her he laid those strangers to Earth. From\r\nwonderful spaces they came to her magical garden, shaken by thunder from\r\npaths that we cannot tread; and though not in themselves containing\r\nmagic were well adapted to carry what magic her runes could give. She\r\nlaid the thigh-bone of a materialist down, and turned to those stormy\r\nwanderers. She arranged them in one straight row by the side of her\r\nfire. And over them then she toppled the burning logs and the embers,\r\nprodding them down with the ebon stick that is the sceptre of witches,\r\nuntil she had deeply covered those seventeen cousins of Earth that had\r\nvisited us from their etherial home. She stepped back then from her fire\r\nand stretched out her hands, and suddenly blasted it with a frightful\r\nrune. The flames leaped up in amazement. And what had been but a lonely\r\nfire in the night, with no more mystery than pertains to all such fires,\r\nflared suddenly into a thing that wanderers feared.\r\n\r\nAs the green flames, stung by her runes, leaped up, and the heat of the\r\nfire grew intenser, she stepped backwards further and further, and\r\nmerely uttered her runes a little louder the further she got from the\r\nfire. She bade Alveric pile on logs, dark logs of oak that lay there\r\ncumbering the heath; and at once, as he dropped them on, the heat licked\r\nthem up; and the witch went on pronouncing her louder runes, and the\r\nflames danced wild and green; and down in the embers the seventeen,\r\nwhose paths had once crossed Earth\'s when they wandered free, knew heat\r\nagain as great as they had known, even on that desperate ride that had\r\nbrought them here. And when Alveric could no longer come near the fire,\r\nand the witch was some yards from it shouting her runes, the magical\r\nflames burned all the ashes away and that portent that flared on the\r\nhill as suddenly ceased, leaving only a circle that sullenly glowed on\r\nthe ground, like the evil pool that glares where thermite has burst.\r\nAnd flat in the glow, all liquid still, lay the sword.\r\n\r\nThe witch approached it and pared its edges with a sword that she drew\r\nfrom her thigh. Then she sat down beside it on the earth and sang to it\r\nwhile it cooled. Not like the runes that enraged the flames was the song\r\nshe sang to the sword: she whose curses had blasted the fire till it\r\nshrivelled big logs of oak crooned now a melody like a wind in summer\r\nblowing from wild wood gardens that no man tended, down valleys loved\r\nonce by children, now lost to them but for dreams, a song of such\r\nmemories as lurk and hide along the edges of oblivion, now flashing from\r\nbeautiful years a glimpse of some golden moment, now passing swiftly\r\nout of remembrance again, to go back to the shades of oblivion, and\r\nleaving on the mind those faintest traces of little shining feet which\r\nwhen dimly perceived by us are called regrets. She sang of old Summer\r\nnoons in the time of harebells: she sang on that high dark heath a song\r\nthat seemed so full of mornings and evenings preserved with all their\r\ndews by her magical craft from days that had else been lost, that\r\nAlveric wondered of each small wandering wing, that her fire had lured\r\nfrom the dusk, if this were the ghost of some day lost to man, called up\r\nby the force of her song from times that were fairer. And all the while\r\nthe unearthly metal grew harder. The white liquid stiffened and turned\r\nred. The glow of the red dwindled. And as it cooled it narrowed: little\r\nparticles came together, little crevices closed: and as they closed they\r\nseized the air about them, and with the air they caught the witch\'s\r\nrune, and gripped it and held it forever. And so it was it became a\r\nmagical sword. And little magic there is in English woods, from the\r\ntime of anemones to the falling of leaves, that was not in the sword.\r\nAnd little magic there is in southern downs, that only sheep roam over\r\nand quiet shepherds, that the sword had not too. And there was scent of\r\nthyme in it and sight of lilac, and the chorus of birds that sings\r\nbefore dawn in April, and the deep proud splendour of rhododendrons, and\r\nthe litheness and laughter of streams, and miles and miles of may. And\r\nby the time the sword was black it was all enchanted with magic.\r\n\r\nNobody can tell you about that sword all that there is to be told of it;\r\nfor those that know of those paths of Space on which its metals once\r\nfloated, till Earth caught them one by one as she sailed past on her\r\norbit, have little time to waste on such things as magic, and so cannot\r\ntell you how the sword was made, and those who know whence poetry is,\r\nand the need that man has for song, or know any one of the fifty\r\nbranches of magic, have little time to waste on such things as science,\r\nand so cannot tell you whence its ingredients came. Enough that it was\r\nonce beyond our Earth and was now here amongst our mundane stones; that\r\nit was once but as those stones, and now had something in it such as\r\nsoft music has; let those that can define it.\r\n\r\nAnd now the witch drew the black blade forth by the hilt, which was\r\nthick and on one side rounded, for she had cut a small groove in the\r\nsoil below the hilt for this purpose, and began to sharpen both sides of\r\nthe sword by rubbing them with a curious greenish stone, still singing\r\nover the sword an eerie song.\r\n\r\nAlveric watched her in silence, wondering, not counting time; it may\r\nhave been for moments, it may have been while the stars went far on\r\ntheir courses. Suddenly she was finished. She stood up with the sword\r\nlying on both her hands. She stretched it out curtly to Alveric; he\r\ntook it, she turned away; and there was a look in her eyes as though she\r\nwould have kept that sword, or kept Alveric. He turned to pour out his\r\nthanks, but she was gone.\r\n\r\nHe rapped on the door of the dark house; he called "Witch, Witch" along\r\nthe lonely heath, till children heard on far farms and were terrified.\r\nThen he turned home, and that was best for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n            _Alveric Comes in Sight of the Elfin Mountains_\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the long chamber, sparsely furnished, high in a tower, in which\r\nAlveric slept, there came a ray direct from the rising sun. He awoke,\r\nand remembered at once the magical sword, which made all his awaking\r\njoyous. It is natural to feel glad at the thought of a recent gift, but\r\nthere was also a certain joy in the sword itself, which perhaps could\r\ncommunicate with Alveric\'s thoughts all the more easily just as they\r\ncame from dreamland, which was pre-eminently the sword\'s own country;\r\nbut, however it be, all those that have come by a magical sword, have\r\nalways felt that joy while it still was new, clearly and unmistakably.\r\n\r\nHe had no farewells to make, but thought it better instantly to obey his\r\nfather\'s command than to stay to explain why he took upon his adventure\r\na sword that he deemed to be better than the one his father loved. So he\r\nstayed not even to eat, but put food in a wallet and slung over him by a\r\nstrap a bottle of good new leather, not waiting to fill it for he knew\r\nhe should meet with streams; and, wearing his father\'s sword as swords\r\nare commonly worn, he slung the other over his back with its rough hilt\r\ntied near his shoulder, and strode away from the Castle and Vale of Erl.\r\nOf money he took but little, half a handful of copper only, for use in\r\nthe fields we know; for he knew not what coin or what means of exchange\r\nwere used on the other side of the frontier of twilight.\r\n\r\nNow the Vale of Erl is very near to the border beyond which there is\r\nnone of the fields we know. He climbed the hill and strode over the\r\nfields and passed through woods of hazel; and the blue sky shone on him\r\nmerrily as he went by the way of the fields, and the blue was as bright\r\nby his feet when he came to the woods, for it was the time of the\r\nbluebells. He ate, and filled his water-bottle, and travelled all day\r\neastwards, and at evening the mountains of faery came floating into\r\nview, the colour of pale forget-me-nots.\r\n\r\nAs the sun set behind Alveric he looked at those pale-blue mountains to\r\nsee with what colour their peaks would astonish the evening; but never a\r\ntint they took from the setting sun, whose splendour was gilding all the\r\nfields we know, never a wrinkle faded upon their precipices, never a\r\nshadow deepened, and Alveric learned that for nothing that happens here\r\nis any change in the enchanted lands.\r\n\r\nHe turned his eyes from their serene pale beauty back to the fields we\r\nknow. And there, with their gables lifting into the sunlight above deep\r\nhedgerows beautiful with Spring, he saw the cottages of earthly men.\r\nPast them he walked while the beauty of evening grew, with songs of\r\nbirds, and scents wandering from flowers, and odours that deepened and\r\ndeepened, and evening decked herself to receive the Evening Star. But\r\nbefore that star appeared the young adventurer found the cottage he\r\nsought; for, flapping above its doorway, he saw the sign of huge brown\r\nhide with outlandish letters in gilt which proclaimed the dweller below\r\nto be a worker in leather.\r\n\r\nAn old man came to the door when Alveric knocked, little and bent with\r\nage, and he bent more when Alveric named himself. And the young man\r\nasked for a scabbard for his sword, yet said not what sword it was. And\r\nthey both went into the cottage where the old wife was, by her big fire,\r\nand the couple did honour to Alveric. The old man then sat down near his\r\nthick table, whose surface shone with smoothness wherever it was not\r\npitted by little tools that had drilled through pieces of leather all\r\nthat man\'s lifetime and in the times of his fathers. And then he laid\r\nthe sword upon his knees and wondered at the roughness of hilt and\r\nguard, for they were raw unworked metal, and at the huge width of the\r\nsword; and then he screwed up his eyes and began to think of his trade.\r\nAnd in a while he thought out what must be done; and his wife brought\r\nhim a fine hide; and he marked out on it two pieces as wide as the\r\nsword, and a bit wider than that.\r\n\r\nAnd any questions he asked concerning that wide bright sword Alveric\r\nsomewhat parried, for he wished not to perplex his mind by telling him\r\nall that it was: he perplexed that old couple enough a little later when\r\nhe asked them for lodging for the night. And this they gave him with as\r\nmany apologies as if it were they that had asked a favour, and gave him\r\na great supper out of their cauldron, in which boiled everything that\r\nthe old man snared; but nothing that Alveric was able to say prevented\r\nthem giving up their bed to him and preparing a heap of skins for their\r\nown night\'s rest by the fire.\r\n\r\nAnd after their supper the old man cut out the two wide pieces of\r\nleather with a point at the end of each and began to stitch them\r\ntogether on each side. And then Alveric began to ask him of the way,\r\nand the old leather-worker spoke of North and South and West and even of\r\nnorth-east, but of East or south-east he spoke never a word. He dwelt\r\nnear the very edge of the fields we know, yet of any hint of anything\r\nlying beyond them he or his wife said nothing. Where Alveric\'s journey\r\nlay upon the morrow they seemed to think the world ended.\r\n\r\nAnd pondering afterwards, in the bed they gave him, all that the old man\r\nhad said, Alveric sometimes marvelled at his ignorance, and yet\r\nsometimes wondered if it might have been skill by which those two had\r\navoided all the evening any word of anything lying to the East or\r\nsouth-east of their home. He wondered if in his early days the old man\r\nmight have gone there, but he was unable even to wonder what he had\r\nfound there if he had gone. Then Alveric fell asleep, and dreams gave\r\nhim hints and guesses of the old man\'s wanderings in Fairyland, but gave\r\nhim no better guides than he had already, and these were the pale-blue\r\npeaks of the Elfin Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe old man woke him after he had slept long. When he came to the\r\nday-room a bright fire was burning there, his breakfast was ready for\r\nhim and the scabbard made, which fitted the sword exactly. The old\r\npeople waited on him silently and took payment for the scabbard, but\r\nwould not take aught for their hospitality. Silently they watched him\r\nrise to go, and followed him without a word to the door, and outside it\r\nwatched him still, clearly hoping that he would turn to the North or\r\nWest; but when he turned and strode for the Elfin Mountains, they\r\nwatched him no more, for their faces never were turned that way. And\r\nthough they watched him no longer yet he waved his hand in farewell;\r\nfor he had a feeling for the cottages and fields of these simple folk,\r\nsuch as they had not for the enchanted lands. He walked in the sparkling\r\nmorning through scenes familiar from infancy; he saw the ruddy orchis\r\nflowering early, reminding the bluebells they were just past their\r\nprime; the small young leaves of the oak were yet a brownish yellow; the\r\nnew beech-leaves shone like brass, where the cuckoo was calling clearly;\r\nand a birch tree looked like a wild woodland creature that had draped\r\nherself in green gauze; on favoured bushes there were buds of may.\r\nAlveric said over and over to himself farewell to all these things: the\r\ncuckoo went on calling, and not for him. And then, as he pushed through\r\na hedge into a field untended, there suddenly close before him in the\r\nfield was, as his father had told, the frontier of twilight. It\r\nstretched across the fields in front of him, blue and dense like water;\r\nand things seen through it seemed misshapen and shining. He looked back\r\nonce over the fields we know; the cuckoo went on calling unconcernedly;\r\na small bird sang about its own affairs; and, nothing seeming to answer\r\nor heed his farewells, Alveric strode on boldly into those long masses\r\nof twilight.\r\n\r\nA man in a field not far was calling to horses, there were folk talking\r\nin a neighbouring lane, as Alveric stepped into the rampart of twilight;\r\nat once all these sounds grew dim, humming faintly, as from great\r\ndistances: in a few strides he was through, and not a murmur at all came\r\nthen from the fields we know. The fields through which he had come had\r\nsuddenly ended; there was no trace of its hedges bright with new green;\r\nhe looked back, and the frontier seemed lowering, cloudy and smoky; he\r\nlooked all round and saw no familiar thing; in the place of the beauty\r\nof May were the wonders and splendours of Elfland.\r\n\r\nThe pale-blue mountains stood august in their glory, shimmering and\r\nrippling in a golden light that seemed as though it rhythmically poured\r\nfrom the peaks and flooded all those slopes with breezes of gold. And\r\nbelow them, far off as yet, he saw going up all silver into the air the\r\nspires of the palace only told of in song. He was on a plain on which\r\nthe flowers were queer and the shape of the trees monstrous. He started\r\nat once toward the silver spires.\r\n\r\nTo those who may have wisely kept their fancies within the boundary of\r\nthe fields we know it is difficult for me to tell of the land to which\r\nAlveric had come, so that in their minds they can see that plain with\r\nits scattered trees and far off the dark wood out of which the palace of\r\nElfland lifted those glittering spires, and above them and beyond them\r\nthat serene range of mountains whose pinnacles took no colour from any\r\nlight we see. Yet it is for this very purpose that our fancies travel\r\nfar, and if my reader through fault of mine fail to picture the peaks of\r\nElfland my fancy had better have stayed in the fields we know. Know then\r\nthat in Elfland are colours more deep than are in our fields, and the\r\nvery air there glows with so deep a lucency that all things seen there\r\nhave something of the look of our trees and flowers in June reflected in\r\nwater. And the colour of Elfland, of which I despaired to tell, may yet\r\nbe told, for we have hints of it here; the deep blue of the night in\r\nSummer just as the gloaming has gone, the pale blue of Venus flooding\r\nthe evening with light, the deeps of lakes in the twilight, all these\r\nare hints of that colour. And while our sunflowers carefully turned to\r\nthe sun, some forefather of the rhododendrons must have turned a little\r\ntowards Elfland, so that some of that glory dwells with them to this\r\nday. And, above all, our painters have had many a glimpse of that\r\ncountry, so that sometimes in pictures we see a glamour too wonderful\r\nfor our fields; it is a memory of theirs that intruded from some old\r\nglimpse of the pale-blue mountains while they sat at easels painting the\r\nfields we know.\r\n\r\nSo Alveric strode on through the luminous air of that land whose\r\nglimpses dimly remembered are inspirations here. And at once he felt\r\nless lonely. For there is a barrier in the fields we know, drawn sharply\r\nbetween men and all other life, so that if we be but a day away from our\r\nkind we are lonely; but once across the boundary of twilight and Alveric\r\nsaw this barrier was down. Crows walking on the moor looked whimsically\r\nat him, all manner of little creatures peered curiously to see who was\r\ncome from a quarter whence so few ever came; to see who went on a\r\njourney whence so few ever returned; for the King of Elfland guarded his\r\ndaughter well, as Alveric knew although he knew not how. There was a\r\nmerry sparkle of interest in all those little eyes, and a look that\r\nmight mean warning.\r\n\r\nThere was perhaps less mystery here than on our side of the boundary of\r\ntwilight; for nothing lurked or seemed to lurk behind great boles of\r\noak, as in certain lights and seasons things may lurk in the fields we\r\nknow; no strangeness hid on the far side of ridges; nothing haunted deep\r\nwoods; whatever might possibly lurk was clearly there to be seen,\r\nwhatever strangeness might be was spread in full sight of the traveller,\r\nwhatever might haunt deep woods lived there in the open day.\r\n\r\nAnd, so strong lay the enchantment deep over all that land, that not\r\nonly did beasts and men guess each other\'s meanings well, but there\r\nseemed to be an understanding even, that reached from men to trees and\r\nfrom trees to men. Lonely pine trees that Alveric passed now and then on\r\nthe moor, their trunks glowing always with the ruddy light that they had\r\ngot by magic from some old sunset, seemed to stand with their branches\r\nakimbo and lean over a little to look at him. It seemed almost as though\r\nthey had not always been trees, before enchantment had overtaken them\r\nthere; it seemed they would tell him something.\r\n\r\nBut Alveric heeded no warnings either from beasts or trees, and strode\r\naway toward the enchanted wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n        _The Magical Sword Meets Some of the Swords of Elfland_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Alveric came to the enchanted wood the light in which Elfland\r\nglowed had neither grown nor dwindled, and he saw that it came from no\r\nradiance that shines on the fields we know, unless the wandering lights\r\nof wonderful moments that sometimes astonish our fields, and are gone\r\nthe instant they come, are strayed over the border of Elfland by some\r\nmomentary disorder of magic. Neither sun nor moon made the light of that\r\nenchanted day.\r\n\r\nA line of pine trees up which ivy climbed, as high as their lowering\r\nblack foliage, stood like sentinels at the edge of the wood. The silver\r\nspires were shining as though it were they that made all this azure glow\r\nin which Elfland swam. And Alveric having by now come far into Elfland,\r\nand being now before its capital palace, and knowing that Elfland\r\nguarded its mysteries well, drew his father\'s sword before he entered\r\nthe wood. The other still hung on his back, slung in its new scabbard\r\nover his left shoulder.\r\n\r\nAnd the moment he passed by one of those guardian pine trees, the ivy\r\nthat lived on it unfastened its tendrils and, rapidly letting itself\r\ndown, came straight for Alveric and clutched at his throat.\r\n\r\nThe long thin sword of his father was just in time; had it not been\r\ndrawn he would have scarcely got it out, so swift was the rush of the\r\nivy. He cut tendril after tendril that grasped his limbs as ivy grasps\r\nold towers, and still more tendrils came for him, until he severed its\r\nmain stem between him and the tree. And as he was doing this he heard a\r\nhissing rush behind him, and another had come down from another tree and\r\nwas rushing at him with all its leaves spread out. The green thing\r\nlooked wild and angry as it gripped his left shoulder as though it would\r\nhold it forever. But Alveric severed those tendrils with a blow of his\r\nsword and then fought with the rest, while the first one was still alive\r\nbut now too short to reach him, and was lashing its branches angrily on\r\nthe ground. And soon, as the surprise of the attack was over and he had\r\nfreed himself of the tendrils that had gripped him, Alveric stepped back\r\ntill the ivy could not reach him and he could still fight it with his\r\nlong sword. The ivy crawled back then to lure Alveric on, and sprang at\r\nhim when he followed it. But, terrible though the grip of ivy is, that\r\nwas a good sharp sword; and very soon Alveric, all bruised though he\r\nwas, had so lopped his assailant that it fled back up its tree. Then he\r\nstepped back and looked at the wood in the light of his new experience,\r\nchoosing a way through. He saw at once that in the barrier of pine trees\r\nthe two in front of him had had their ivy so shortened in the fight that\r\nif he went mid-way between the two the ivy of neither would be able to\r\nreach him. He then stepped forward, but the moment he did so he noticed\r\none of the pine trees move closer to the other. He knew then that the\r\ntime was come to draw his magical sword.\r\n\r\nSo he returned his father\'s sword to the scabbard by his side and drew\r\nout the other over his shoulder and, going straight up to the tree that\r\nhad moved, swept at the ivy as it sprang at him: and the ivy fell all at\r\nonce to the ground, not lifeless but a heap of common ivy. And then he\r\ngave one blow to the trunk of the tree, and a chip flew out not larger\r\nthan a common sword would have made, but the whole tree shuddered; and\r\nwith that shudder disappeared at once a certain ominous look that the\r\npine had had, and it stood there an ordinary unenchanted tree. Then he\r\nstepped on through the wood with his sword drawn.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone many paces when he heard behind him a sound like a faint\r\nbreeze in the tree-tops, yet no wind was blowing in that wood at all. He\r\nlooked round therefore, and saw that the pine trees were following him.\r\nThey were coming slowly after him, keeping well out of the way of his\r\nsword, but to left and right they were gaining on him, so that he saw he\r\nwas being gradually shut in by a crescent that grew thicker and thicker\r\nas it crowded amongst the trees that it met on the way, and would soon\r\ncrush him to death. Alveric saw at once that to turn back would be\r\nfatal, and decided to push right on, relying chiefly on speed; for his\r\nquick perception had already noticed something slow about the magic that\r\nswayed the wood; as though whoever controlled it were old or weary of\r\nmagic, or interrupted by other things. So he went straight ahead,\r\nhitting every tree in his way, whether enchanted or not, a blow with his\r\nmagical sword; and the runes that ran in that metal from the other side\r\nof the sun were stronger than any spells that there were in the wood.\r\nGreat oak trees with sinister boles drooped and lost all their\r\nenchantment as Alveric flashed past them with a flick of that magical\r\nsword. He was marching faster than the clumsy pines. And soon he left in\r\nthat weird and eerie wood a wake of trees that were wholly unenchanted,\r\nthat stood there now without hint of romance or mystery even.\r\n\r\nAnd all of a sudden he came from the gloom of the wood to the emerald\r\nglory of the Elf King\'s lawns. Again, we have hints of such things here.\r\nImagine lawns of ours just emerging from night, flashing early lights\r\nfrom their dewdrops when all the stars have gone; bordered with flowers\r\nthat just begin to appear, their gentle colours all coming back after\r\nnight; untrodden by any feet except the tiniest and wildest; shut off\r\nfrom the wind and the world by trees in whose fronds is still darkness:\r\npicture these waiting for the birds to sing; there is almost a hint\r\nthere sometimes of the glow of the lawns of Elfland; but then it passes\r\nso quickly that we can never be sure. More beautiful than aught our\r\nwonder guesses, more than our hearts have hoped, were the dewdrop lights\r\nand twilights in which these lawns glowed and shone. And we have another\r\nthing by which to hint of them, those seaweeds or sea-mosses that drape\r\nMediterranean rocks and shine out of blue-green water for gazers from\r\ndizzy cliffs: more like sea-floors were these lawns than like any land\r\nof ours, for the air of Elfland is thus deep and blue.\r\n\r\nAt the beauty of these lawns Alveric stood gazing as they shone through\r\ntwilight and dew, surrounded by the mauve and ruddy glory of the massed\r\nflowers of Elfland, beside which our sunsets pale and our orchids droop;\r\nand beyond them lay like night the magical wood. And jutting from that\r\nwood, with glittering portals all open wide to the lawns, with windows\r\nmore blue than our sky on Summer\'s nights; as though built of starlight;\r\nshone that palace that may be only told of in song.\r\n\r\nAs Alveric stood there with his sword in his hand, at the wood\'s edge,\r\nscarcely breathing, with his eyes looking over the lawns at the chiefest\r\nglory of Elfland; through one of the portals alone came the King of\r\nElfland\'s daughter. She walked dazzling to the lawns without seeing\r\nAlveric. Her feet brushed through the dew and the heavy air and gently\r\npressed for an instant the emerald grass, which bent and rose, as our\r\nharebells when blue butterflies light and leave them, roaming care-free\r\nalong the hills of chalk.\r\n\r\nAnd as she passed he neither breathed nor moved, nor could have moved if\r\nthose pines had still pursued him, but they stayed in the forest not\r\ndaring to touch those lawns.\r\n\r\nShe wore a crown that seemed to be carved of great pale sapphires; she\r\nshone on those lawns and gardens like a dawn coming unaware, out of long\r\nnight, on some planet nearer than us to the sun. And as she passed near\r\nAlveric she suddenly turned her head; and her eyes opened in a little\r\nwonder. She had never before seen a man from the fields we know.\r\n\r\nAnd Alveric gazed in her eyes all speechless and powerless still: it was\r\nindeed the Princess Lirazel in her beauty. And then he saw that her\r\ncrown was not of sapphires but ice.\r\n\r\n"Who are you?" she said. And her voice had the music that, of earthly\r\nthings, was most like ice in thousands of broken pieces rocked by a wind\r\nof Spring upon lakes in some northern country.\r\n\r\nAnd he said: "I come from the fields that are mapped and known."\r\n\r\nAnd then she sighed for a moment for those fields, for she had heard how\r\nlife beautifully passes there, and how there are always in those fields\r\nyoung generations, and she thought of the changing seasons and children\r\nand age, of which elfin minstrels had sung when they told of Earth.\r\n\r\nAnd when he saw her sigh for the fields we know he told her somewhat of\r\nthat land whence he had come. And she questioned him further, and soon\r\nhe was telling her tales of his home and the Vale of Erl. And she\r\nwondered to hear of it and asked him many questions more; and then he\r\ntold her all that he knew of Earth, not presuming to tell Earth\'s story\r\nfrom what his own eyes had seen in his bare score of years, but telling\r\nthose tales and fables of the ways of beasts and men, that the folk of\r\nErl had drawn out of the ages, and which their elders told by the fire\r\nat evening when children asked of what happened long ago. Thus on the\r\nedge of those lawns whose miraculous glory was framed by flowers we have\r\nnever known, with the magical wood behind them, and that palace shining\r\nnear which may only be told of in song, they spoke of the simple wisdom\r\nof old men and old women, telling of harvests and the blossoming of\r\nroses and may, of when to plant in gardens, of what wild animals knew;\r\nhow to heal, how to sow, how to thatch, and of which of the winds in\r\nwhat seasons blow over the fields we know.\r\n\r\nAnd then there appeared those knights who guard that palace lest any\r\nshould come through the enchanted wood. Four of them they came shining\r\nover the lawns in armour, their faces not to be seen. In all the\r\nenchanted centuries of their lives they had not dared to dream of the\r\nprincess: they had never bared their faces when they knelt armed before\r\nher. Yet they had sworn an oath of dreadful words that no man else\r\nshould ever speak with her, if one should come through the enchanted\r\nwood. With this oath now on their lips they marched towards Alveric.\r\n\r\nLirazel looked at them sorrowfully yet could not halt them, for they\r\ncame by command of her father which she could not avert; and well she\r\nknew that her father might not recall his command, for he had uttered it\r\nages ago at the bidding of Fate. Alveric looked at their armour, which\r\nseemed to be brighter than any metal of ours, as though it came from one\r\nof those buttresses near, which are only told of in song; then he went\r\ntowards them drawing his father\'s sword, for he thought to drive its\r\nslender point through some joint of the armour. The other he put into\r\nhis left hand.\r\n\r\nAs the first knight struck, Alveric parried, and stopped the blow, but\r\nthere came a shock like lightning into his arm and the sword flew from\r\nhis hand, and he knew that no earthly sword could meet the weapons of\r\nElfland, and took the magical sword in his right hand. With this he\r\nparried the strokes of the Princess Lirazel\'s guard, for such these four\r\nknights were, having waited for this occasion through all the ages of\r\nElfland. And no more shock came to him from any of those swords, but\r\nonly a vibration in his own sword\'s metal that passed through it like a\r\nsong, and a kind of a glow that arose in it, reaching to Alveric\'s heart\r\nand cheering it.\r\n\r\nBut as Alveric continued to parry the swift blows of the guard, that\r\nsword that was kin to the lightning grew weary of these defences, for it\r\nhad in its essence speed and desperate journeys; and, lifting Alveric\'s\r\nhand along with it, it swept blows at the elvish knights, and the\r\narmour of Elfland could not hold it out. Thick and curious blood began\r\nto pour through rifts in the armour, and soon of that glittering company\r\ntwo were fallen; and Alveric, encouraged by the zeal of his sword fought\r\ncheerily and soon overthrew another, so that only he and one of the\r\nguard remained, who seemed to have some stronger magic about him than\r\nhad been given to his fallen comrades. And so it was, for when the Elf\r\nKing had first enchanted the guard he had charmed this elvish soldier\r\nfirst of all, while all the wonder of his runes were new; and the\r\nsoldier and his armour and his sword had something still of this early\r\nmagic about them, more potent than any inspirations of wizardry that had\r\ncome later from his master\'s mind. Yet this knight, as Alveric soon was\r\nable to feel along his arm and his sword, had none of those three master\r\nrunes of which the old witch had spoken when she made the sword on her\r\nhill; for these were preserved unuttered by the King of Elfland himself,\r\nwith which to hedge his own presence. To have known of their existence\r\nshe must have flown by broom to Elfland and spoken secretly alone with\r\nthe King.\r\n\r\nAnd the sword that had visited Earth from so far away smote like the\r\nfalling of thunderbolts; and green sparks rose from the armour, and\r\ncrimson as sword met sword; and thick elvish blood moved slowly, from\r\nwide slits, down the cuirass; and Lirazel gazed in awe and wonder and\r\nlove; and the combatants edged away fighting into the forest; and\r\nbranches fell on them hacked off by their fight; and the runes in\r\nAlveric\'s far-travelled sword exulted, and roared at the elf-knight;\r\nuntil in the dark of the wood, amongst branches severed from\r\ndisenchanted trees, with a blow like that of a thunderbolt riving an oak\r\ntree, Alveric slew him.\r\n\r\nAt that crash, and at that silence, Lirazel ran to his side.\r\n\r\n"Quick!" she said. "For my father has three runes ..." She durst not\r\nspeak of them.\r\n\r\n"Whither?" said Alveric.\r\n\r\nAnd she said: "To the fields you know."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n            _Alveric Comes Back to Earth After Many Years_\r\n\r\n\r\nBack through the guarding wood went Alveric and Lirazel, she only\r\nlooking once more at those flowers and lawns, seen only by the\r\nfurthest-travelling fancies of poets in deepest sleep, then urging\r\nAlveric on; he choosing the way past trees he had disenchanted.\r\n\r\nAnd she would not let him delay even to choose his path, but kept urging\r\nhim away from the palace that is only told of in song. And the other\r\ntrees began to come lumbering towards them, from beyond the lustreless\r\nunromantic line that Alveric\'s sword had smitten, looking queerly as\r\nthey came at their stricken comrades, whose listless branches drooped\r\nwithout magic or mystery. And as the moving trees came nearer Lirazel\r\nwould hold up her hand, and they all halted and came on no more; and\r\nstill she urged upon Alveric to hasten.\r\n\r\nShe knew her father would climb the brazen stairs of one of those silver\r\nspires, she knew he would soon come out on to a high balcony, she knew\r\nwhat rune he would chant. She heard the sound of his footsteps\r\nascending, ringing now through the wood. They fled over the plain beyond\r\nthe wood, all through the blue everlasting elfin day, and again and\r\nagain she looked over her shoulder and urged Alveric on. The Elf King\'s\r\nfeet boomed slow on the thousand brazen steps, and she hoped to reach\r\nthe barrier of twilight, which on that side was smoky and dull; when\r\nsuddenly, as she looked for the hundredth time at the distant balconies\r\nof the glittering spires, she saw a door begin to open high up, above\r\nthe palace only told of in song. She cried "Alas!" to Alveric, but at\r\nthat moment the scent of briar roses came drifting to them from the\r\nfields we know.\r\n\r\nAlveric knew not fatigue for he was young, nor she for she was ageless.\r\nThey rushed forward, he taking her hand; the Elf King lifted his beard,\r\nand just as he began to intone a rune that only once may be uttered,\r\nagainst which nothing from our fields can avail, they were through the\r\nfrontier of twilight, and the rune shook and troubled those lands in\r\nwhich Lirazel walked no longer.\r\n\r\nWhen Lirazel looked upon the fields we know, as strange to her as once\r\nthey have been to us, their beauty delighted her. She laughed to see the\r\nhaystacks and loved their quaintness. A lark was singing and Lirazel\r\nspoke to it, and the lark seemed not to understand, but she turned to\r\nother glories of our fields, for all were new to her, and forgot the\r\nlark. It was curiously no longer the season of bluebells, for all the\r\nfoxgloves were blooming and the may was gone and the wild roses were\r\nthere. Alveric never understood this.\r\n\r\nIt was early morning and the sun was shining, giving soft colours to our\r\nfields, and Lirazel rejoiced in those fields of ours at more common\r\nthings than one might believe there were amongst the familiar sights of\r\nEarth\'s every day. So glad was she, so gay, with her cries of surprise\r\nand her laughter, that there seemed thenceforth to Alveric a beauty\r\nthat he had never dreamed of in buttercups, and a humour in carts that\r\nhe never had thought of before. Each moment she found with a cry of\r\njoyous discovery some treasure of Earth\'s that he had not known to be\r\nfair. And then, as he watched her bringing a beauty to our fields more\r\ndelicate even than that the wild roses brought, he saw that her crown of\r\nice had melted away.\r\n\r\nAnd thus she came from the palace that may only be told of in song, over\r\nthe fields of which I need not tell, for they were the familiar fields\r\nof Earth, that the ages change but little and only for a while, and came\r\nat evening with Alveric to his home.\r\n\r\nAll was changed in the Castle of Erl. In the gateway they met a guardian\r\nwhom Alveric knew: the man wondered to see them. In the hall and upon\r\nthe stairway they met some that tended the castle, who turned their\r\nheads in surprise. Alveric knew them also, but all were older; and he\r\nsaw that quite ten years must have passed away during that one blue day\r\nhe had spent in Elfland.\r\n\r\nWho does not know that this is the way of Elfland? And yet who would not\r\nbe surprised if they saw it happen as Alveric saw it now? He turned to\r\nLirazel and told her how ten or twelve years were gone. But it was as\r\nthough a humble man who had wed an earthly princess should tell her he\r\nhad lost sixpence; time had had no value or meaning to Lirazel, and she\r\nwas untroubled to hear of the ten lost years. She did not dream what\r\ntime means to us here.\r\n\r\nThey told Alveric that his father was long since dead. And one told him\r\nhow he died happy, without impatience, trusting to Alveric to accomplish\r\nhis bidding; for he had known somewhat of the ways of Elfland, and knew\r\nthat those that traffic twixt here and there must have something of that\r\ncalm in which Elfland forever dreams.\r\n\r\nUp the valley, ringing late, they heard the blacksmith\'s work. This\r\nblacksmith was he who had been the spokesman of those who went once to\r\nthe long red room to the Lord of Erl. And all these men yet lived; for\r\ntime though it moved over the Vale of Erl, as over all fields we know,\r\nmoved gently, not as in our cities.\r\n\r\nThence Alveric and Lirazel went to the holy place of the Freer. And when\r\nthey found him Alveric asked the Freer to wed them with Christom rites.\r\nAnd when the Freer saw the beauty of Lirazel flash mid the common things\r\nin his little holy place, for he had ornamented the walls of his house\r\nwith knick-knacks that he sometimes bought at the fairs, he feared at\r\nonce she was of no mortal line. And, when he asked her whence she came\r\nand she happily answered "Elfland," the good man clasped his hands and\r\ntold her earnestly how all in that land dwelt beyond salvation. But she\r\nsmiled, for while in Elfland she had always been idly happy, and now she\r\nonly cared for Alveric. The Freer went then to his books to see what\r\nshould be done.\r\n\r\nFor a long while he read in silence but for his breathing, while Alveric\r\nand Lirazel stood before him. And at last he found in his book a form of\r\nservice for the wedding of a mermaid that had forsaken the sea, though\r\nthe good book told not of Elfland. And this he said would suffice, for\r\nthat the mermaids dwelt equally with the elf-folk beyond thought of\r\nsalvation. So he sent for his bell and such tapers as are necessary.\r\nThen, turning to Lirazel, he bade her forsake and forswear and solemnly\r\nto renounce all things pertaining to Elfland, reading slowly out of a\r\nbook the words to be used on this wholesome occasion.\r\n\r\n"Good Freer," Lirazel answered, "nought said in these fields can cross\r\nthe barrier of Elfland. And well that this is so, for my father has\r\nthree runes that could blast this book when he answered one of its\r\nspells, were any word able to pass through the frontier of twilight. I\r\nwill spell no spells with my father."\r\n\r\n"But I cannot wed Christom man," the Freer replied, "with one of the\r\nstubborn who dwell beyond salvation."\r\n\r\nThen Alveric implored her and she said the say in the book, "though my\r\nfather could blast this spell," she added, "if it ever crossed one of\r\nhis runes." And, the bell being now brought and the tapers, the good man\r\nwedded them in his little house with the rites that are proper for the\r\nwedding of a mermaid that hath forsaken the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                 _The Wisdom of the Parliament of Erl_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those bridal days the men of Erl came often to the castle, bringing\r\ngifts and felicitations; and in the evenings they would talk in their\r\nhouses of the fair things that they hoped for the Vale of Erl on account\r\nof the wisdom of the thing they had done when they spoke with the old\r\nlord in his long red room.\r\n\r\nThere was Narl the blacksmith, who had been their leader; there was\r\nGuhic, who first had thought of it, after speaking with his wife, an\r\nupland farmer of clover pastures near Erl; there was Nehic a driver of\r\nhorses; there were four vendors of beeves; and Oth, a hunter of deer;\r\nand Vlel the master-ploughman: all these and three men more had gone to\r\nthe Lord of Erl and made that request that had set Alveric on his\r\nwanderings. And now they spoke of all the good that would come of it.\r\nThey had all desired that the Vale of Erl should be known among men, as\r\nwas, they felt, its desert. They had looked in histories, they had read\r\nbooks treating of pasture, yet seldom found mention at all of the vale\r\nthey loved. And one day Guhic had said "Let all us people be ruled in\r\nthe future by a magic lord, and he shall make the name of the valley\r\nfamous, and there shall be none that have heard not the name of Erl."\r\n\r\nAnd all had rejoiced and had made a parliament; and it had gone, twelve\r\nmen, to the Lord of Erl. And it had been as I have told.\r\n\r\nSo now they spoke over their mead of the future of Erl, and its place\r\namong other valleys, and of the reputation that it should have in the\r\nworld. They would meet and talk in the great forge of Narl, and Narl\r\nwould bring them mead from an inner room, and Threl would come in late\r\nfrom his work in the woods. The mead was of clover honey, heavy and\r\nsweet; and when they had sat awhile in the warm room, talking of daily\r\nthings of the valley and uplands, they would turn their minds to the\r\nfuture, seeing as through a golden mist the glory of Erl. One praised\r\nthe beeves, another the horses, another the good soil, and all looked to\r\nthe time when other lands should know the great mastery among valleys\r\nthat was held by the valley of Erl.\r\n\r\nAnd Time that brought these evenings bore them away, moving over the\r\nVale of Erl as over all fields we know, and it was Spring again and the\r\nseason of bluebells. And one day in the prime of the wild anemones, it\r\nwas told that Alveric and Lirazel had a son.\r\n\r\nThen all the people of Erl lit a fire next night on the hill, and danced\r\nabout it and drank mead and rejoiced. All day they had dragged logs and\r\nbranches for it from a wild wood near, and the glow of the fire was seen\r\nin other lands. Only on the pale-blue peaks of the mountains of Elfland\r\nno gleam of it shone, for they are unchanged by ought that can happen\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nAnd when they rested from dancing round their fires they would sit on\r\nthe ground and foretell the fortune of Erl, when it should be ruled over\r\nby this son of Alveric with all the magic he would have from his\r\nmother. And some said he would lead them to war, and some said to deeper\r\nploughing; and all foretold a better price for their beeves. None slept\r\nthat night for dancing and foretelling a glorious future, and for\r\nrejoicing at the things they foretold. And above all they rejoiced that\r\nthe name of Erl should be thenceforth known and honoured in other lands.\r\n\r\nThen Alveric sought for a nurse for his child, all through the valley\r\nand uplands, and not easily found any worthy of having the care of one\r\nthat was of the royal line of Elfland; and those that he found were\r\nfrightened of the light, as though not of our Earth or sky, that seemed\r\nto shine at times in the baby\'s eyes. And in the end he went one windy\r\nmorning up the hill of the lonely witch, and found her sitting idly in\r\nher doorway, having nothing to curse or bless.\r\n\r\n"Well," said the witch, "did the sword bring you fortune?"\r\n\r\n"Who knows," said Alveric, "what brings fortune, since we cannot see the\r\nend?"\r\n\r\nAnd he spoke wearily, for he was weary with age, and never knew how many\r\nyears had gone over him on the day he travelled to Elfland; far more it\r\nseemed than had passed on that same day over Erl.\r\n\r\n"Aye," said the witch. "Who knows the end but we?"\r\n\r\n"Mother Witch," said Alveric, "I wedded the King of Elfland\'s daughter."\r\n\r\n"That was a great advancement," said the old witch.\r\n\r\n"Mother Witch," said Alveric, "we have a child. And who shall care for\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"No human task," said the witch.\r\n\r\n"Mother Witch," said Alveric, "will you come to the Vale of Erl and\r\ncare for him and be the nurse at the castle? For none but you in all\r\nthese fields knows ought of the things of Elfland, except the princess,\r\nand she knows nothing of Earth."\r\n\r\nAnd the old witch answered: "For the sake of the King I will come."\r\n\r\nSo the witch came down from the hill with a bundle of queer belongings.\r\nAnd thus the child was nursed in the fields we know by one who knew\r\nsongs and tales of his mother\'s country.\r\n\r\nAnd often, as they bent together over the baby, that aged witch and the\r\nPrincess Lirazel would talk together, and afterwards through long\r\nevenings, of things about which Alveric knew nothing: and for all the\r\nage of the witch, and the wisdom that she had stored in her hundred\r\nyears, which is all hidden from man, it was nevertheless she who learned\r\nwhen they talked together, and the Princess Lirazel who taught. But of\r\nEarth and the ways of Earth Lirazel never knew anything.\r\n\r\nAnd this old witch that watched over the baby so tended him and so\r\nsoothed, that in all his infancy he never wept. For she had a charm for\r\nbrightening the morning, and a charm for cheering the day, and a charm\r\nfor calming a cough, and a charm for making the nursery warm and\r\npleasant and eerie, when the fire leaped up at the sound of it, from\r\nlogs that she had enchanted, and sent large shadows of the things about\r\nthe fire quivering dark and merry over the ceiling.\r\n\r\nAnd the child was cared for by Lirazel and the witch as children are\r\ncared for whose mothers are merely human; but he knew tunes and runes\r\nbesides, that other children hear not in fields we know.\r\n\r\nSo the old witch moved about the nursery with her black stick, guarding\r\nthe child with her runes. If a draught on windy nights shrilled in\r\nthrough some crack she had a spell to calm it; and a spell to charm the\r\nsong that the kettle sang, till its melody brought hints of strange news\r\nfrom mist-hidden places, and the child grew to know the mystery of far\r\nvalleys that his eyes had never seen. And at evening she would raise her\r\nebon stick and, standing before the fire amongst all the shadows, would\r\nenchant them and make them dance for him. And they took all manner of\r\nshapes of good and evil, dancing to please the baby; so that he came to\r\nhave knowledge not only of the things with which Earth is stored; pigs,\r\ntrees, camels, crocodiles, wolves, and ducks, good dogs and the gentle\r\ncow; but of the darker things also that men have feared, and the things\r\nthey have hoped and guessed. Through those evenings the things that\r\nhappen, and the creatures that are, passed over those nursery walls, and\r\nhe grew familiar with the fields we know. And on warm afternoons the\r\nwitch would carry him through the village, and all the dogs would bark\r\nat her eerie figure, but durst not come too close, for a page-boy behind\r\nher carried the ebon stick. And dogs, that know so much, that know how\r\nfar a man can throw a stone, and if he would beat them, and if he durst\r\nnot, knew also that this was no ordinary stick. So they kept far away\r\nfrom that queer black stick in the hand of the page, and snarled, and\r\nthe villagers came out to see. And all were glad when they saw how\r\nmagical a nurse the young heir had, "for here," they said, "is the witch\r\nZiroonderel," and they declared that she would bring him up amongst the\r\ntrue principles of wizardry, and that in his time there would be magic\r\nthat would make all their valley famous. And they beat their dogs until\r\nthey slunk indoors, but the dogs clung to their suspicions still. So\r\nthat when the men were gone to the forge of Narl, and their houses were\r\nquiet in the moonlight and Narl\'s windows glowed, and the mead had gone\r\nround, and they talked of the future of Erl, more and more voices\r\njoining in the tale of its coming glory, on soft feet the dogs would\r\ncome out to the sandy street and howl.\r\n\r\nAnd to the high sunny nursery Lirazel would come, bringing a brightness\r\nthat the learned witch had not in all her spells, and would sing to her\r\nboy those songs that none can sing to us here, for they were learned the\r\nother side of the frontier of twilight and were made by singers all\r\nunvexed by Time. And for all the marvel that there was in those songs,\r\nwhose origin was so far from the fields we know, and in times remote\r\nfrom those that historians use; and though men wondered at the\r\nstrangeness of them when from open casements through the Summer days\r\nthey drifted over Erl; yet none wondered even at those as she wondered\r\nat the earthly ways of her child and all the little human things that he\r\ndid more and more as he grew. For all human ways were strange to her.\r\nAnd yet she loved him more than her father\'s realm, or the glittering\r\ncenturies of her ageless youth, or the palace that may be told of only\r\nin song.\r\n\r\nIn those days Alveric learned that she would never now grow familiar\r\nwith earthly things, never understand the folk that dwelt in the valley,\r\nnever read wise books without laughter, never care for earthly ways,\r\nnever feel more at ease in the Castle of Erl than any woodland thing\r\nthat Threl might have snared and kept caged in a house. He had hoped\r\nthat soon she would learn the things that were strange to her, till the\r\nlittle differences that there are between things in our fields and in\r\nElfland should not trouble her any more; but he saw at last that the\r\nthings that were strange would always so remain, and that all the\r\ncenturies of her timeless home had not so lightly shaped her thoughts\r\nand fancies that they could be altered by our brief years here. When he\r\nhad learned this he had learned the truth.\r\n\r\nBetween the spirits of Alveric and Lirazel lay all the distance there is\r\nbetween Earth and Elfland; and love bridged the distance, which can\r\nbridge further than that; yet when for a moment on the golden bridge he\r\nwould pause and let his thoughts look down at the gulf, all his mind\r\nwould grow giddy and Alveric trembled. What of the end, he thought? And\r\nfeared lest it should be stranger than the beginning.\r\n\r\nAnd she, she did not see that she should know anything. Was not her\r\nbeauty enough? Had not a lover come at last to those lawns that shone by\r\nthe palace only told of in song, and rescued her from her uncompanioned\r\nfate and from that perpetual calm? Was it not enough that he had come?\r\nMust she needs understand the curious things folk did? Must she never\r\ndance in the road, never speak to goats, never laugh at funerals, never\r\nsing at night? Why! What was joy for if it must be hidden? Must\r\nmerriment bow to dulness in these strange fields she had come to? And\r\nthen one day she saw how a woman of Erl looked less fair than she had\r\nlooked a year ago. Little enough was the change, but her swift eye saw\r\nit surely. And she went to Alveric crying to be comforted, because she\r\nfeared that Time in the fields we know might have power to harm that\r\nbeauty that the long long ages of Elfland had never dared to dim. And\r\nAlveric had said that Time must have his way, as all men know; and where\r\nwas the good of complaining?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                      _The Rune of the Elf King_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the high balcony of his gleaming tower the King of Elfland stood.\r\nBelow him echoed yet the thousand steps. He had lifted his head to chant\r\nthe rune that should hold his daughter in Elfland, and in that moment\r\nhad seen her pass the murky barrier; which on this side, facing toward\r\nElfland, is all lustrous with twilight, and on that side, facing towards\r\nthe fields we know, is smoky and angry and dull. And now he had dropped\r\nhis head till his beard lay mingled with his cape of ermine above his\r\ncerulean cloak, and stood there silently sorrowful, while time passed\r\nswift as ever over the fields we know.\r\n\r\nAnd standing there all blue and white against his silver tower, aged by\r\nthe passing of times of which we know nothing, before he imposed its\r\neternal calm upon Elfland, he thought of his daughter amongst our\r\npitiless years. For he knew, whose wisdom surpassed the confines of\r\nElfland and touched our rugged fields, knew well the harshness of\r\nmaterial things and all the turmoil of Time. Even as he stood there he\r\nknew that the years that assail beauty, and the myriad harshnesses that\r\nvex the spirit, were already about his daughter. And the days that\r\nremained to her now seemed scarce more to him, dwelling beyond the fret\r\nand ruin of Time, than to us might seem a briar rose\'s hours when\r\nplucked and foolishly hawked in the streets of a city. He knew that\r\nthere hung over her now the doom of all mortal things. He thought of her\r\nperishing soon, as mortal things must; to be buried amongst the rocks of\r\na land that scorned Elfland and that held its most treasured myths to be\r\nof little account. And were he not the King of all that magical land,\r\nwhich held its eternal calm from his own mysterious serenity, he had\r\nwept to think of the grave in rocky Earth gripping that form that was so\r\nfair forever. Or else, he thought, she would pass to some paradise far\r\nfrom his knowledge, some heaven of which books told in the fields we\r\nknow, for he had heard even of this. He pictured her on some\r\napple-haunted hill, under blossoms of an everlasting April, through\r\nwhich flickered the pale gold haloes of those that had cursed Elfland.\r\nHe saw, though dimly for all his magical wisdom, the glory that only the\r\nblessed clearly see. He saw his daughter on those heavenly hills stretch\r\nout both arms, as he knew well she would, towards the pale-blue peaks of\r\nher elfin home, while never one of the blessed heeded her yearning. And\r\nthen, though he was king of all that land, that had its everlasting calm\r\nfrom him, he wept and all Elfland shivered. It shivered as placid water\r\nshivers here if something suddenly touches it from our fields.\r\n\r\nThen the King turned and left his balcony and went in great haste down\r\nhis brazen steps.\r\n\r\nHe came clanging to the ivory doors that shut the tower below, and\r\nthrough them came to the throne-room of which only song may tell. And\r\nthere he took a parchment out of a coffer and a plume from some\r\nfabulous wing, and dipping the plume into no earthly ink, wrote out a\r\nrune on the parchment. Then raising two fingers he made the minor\r\nenchantment whereby he summoned his guard. And no guard came.\r\n\r\nI have said that no time passed at all in Elfland. Yet the happening of\r\nevents is in itself a manifestation of time, and no event can occur\r\nunless time pass. Now it is thus with time in Elfland: in the eternal\r\nbeauty that dreams in that honied air nothing stirs or fades or dies,\r\nnothing seeks its happiness in movement or change or a new thing, but\r\nhas its ecstasy in the perpetual contemplation of all the beauty that\r\nhas ever been, and which always glows over those enchanted lawns as\r\nintense as when first created by incantation or song. Yet if the\r\nenergies of the wizard\'s mind arose to meet a new thing, then that power\r\nthat had laid its calm upon Elfland and held back time troubled the calm\r\nawhile, and time for awhile shook Elfland. Cast anything into a deep\r\npool from a land strange to it, where some great fish dreams, and green\r\nweeds dream, and heavy colours dream, and light sleeps; the great fish\r\nstirs, the colours shift and change, the green weeds tremble, the light\r\nwakes, a myriad things know slow movement and change; and soon the whole\r\npool is still again. It was the same when Alveric passed through the\r\nborder of twilight and right through the enchanted wood, and the King\r\nwas troubled and moved, and all Elfland trembled.\r\n\r\nWhen the King saw that no guard came he looked into the wood which he\r\nknew to be troubled, through the deep mass of the trees, that were\r\nquivering yet with the coming of Alveric; he looked through the deeps of\r\nthe wood and the silver walls of his palace, for he looked by\r\nenchantment, and there he saw the four knights of his guard lying\r\nstricken upon the ground with their thick elvish blood hanging out\r\nthrough slits in their armour. And he thought of the early magic whereby\r\nhe had made the eldest, with a rune all newly inspired, before he had\r\nconquered Time. He passed out through the splendour and glow of one of\r\nhis flashing portals, and over a gleaming lawn and came to the fallen\r\nguard, and saw the trees still troubled.\r\n\r\n"There has been magic here," said the King of Elfland.\r\n\r\nAnd then though he only had three runes that could do such a thing, and\r\nthough they only could be uttered once, and one was already written upon\r\nparchment to bring his daughter home, he uttered the second of his most\r\nmagical runes over that elder knight that his magic had made long ago.\r\nAnd in the silence that followed the last words of the rune the rents in\r\nthe moon-bright armour all clicked shut at once, and the thick dark\r\nblood was gone and the knight rose live to his feet. And the Elf King\r\nnow had only one rune left that was mightier than any magic we know.\r\n\r\nThe other three knights lay dead; and, having no souls, their magic\r\nreturned again to the mind of their master.\r\n\r\nHe went back then to his palace, while he sent the last of his guard to\r\nfetch him a troll.\r\n\r\nDark brown of skin and two or three feet high the trolls are a gnomish\r\ntribe that inhabit Elfland. And soon there was a scamper in the\r\nthrone-room that may only be told of in song, and a troll lit by the\r\nthrone on its two bare feet and stood before its king. The King gave it\r\nthe parchment with the rune written thereon, saying: "Scamper hence, and\r\npass over the end of the Land, until you come to the fields that none\r\nknow here; and find the Princess Lirazel who is gone to the haunts of\r\nmen, and give her this rune and she shall read it and all shall be\r\nwell."\r\n\r\nAnd the troll scampered thence.\r\n\r\nAnd soon the troll was come with long leaps to the frontier of twilight.\r\nThen nothing moved in Elfland any more; and motionless on that splendid\r\nthrone of which only song may speak sat the old King mourning in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                       _The Coming of the Troll_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the troll came to the frontier of twilight he skipped nimbly\r\nthrough; yet he emerged cautiously into the fields we know, for he was\r\nafraid of dogs. Slipping quietly out of those dense masses of twilight\r\nhe came so softly into our fields that no eye had seen him unless it\r\nwere gazing already at the spot at which he appeared. There he paused\r\nfor some instants, looking to left and right; and, seeing no dogs, he\r\nleft the barrier of twilight. This troll had never before been in the\r\nfields we know, yet he knew well to avoid dogs, for the fear of dogs is\r\nso deep and universal amongst all that are less than Man, that it seems\r\nto have passed even beyond our boundaries and to have been felt in\r\nElfland.\r\n\r\nIn our fields it was now May, and the buttercups stretched away before\r\nthe troll, a world of yellow mingled with the brown of the budding\r\ngrasses. When he saw so many buttercups shining there the wealth of\r\nEarth astonished him. And soon he was moving through them, yellowing his\r\nshins as he went.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone far from Elfland when he met with a hare, who was lying\r\nin a comfortable arrangement of grass, in which he had intended to pass\r\nthe time till he should have things to see to.\r\n\r\nWhen the hare saw the troll he sat there without any movement whatever,\r\nand without any expression in his eyes, and did nothing at all but\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nWhen the troll saw the hare he skipped nearer, and lay down before it in\r\nthe buttercups, and asked it the way to the haunts of men. And the hare\r\nwent on thinking.\r\n\r\n"Thing of these fields," repeated the troll, "where are the haunts of\r\nmen?"\r\n\r\nThe hare got up then and walked towards the troll, which made the hare\r\nlook very ridiculous, for he had none of the grace while walking that he\r\nhas when he runs or gambols, and was much lower in front than behind. He\r\nput his nose into the troll\'s face and twitched foolish whiskers.\r\n\r\n"Tell me the way," said the troll.\r\n\r\nWhen the hare perceived that the troll did not smell of anything like\r\ndog he was content to let the troll question him. But he did not\r\nunderstand the language of Elfland, so he lay still again and thought\r\nwhile the troll talked.\r\n\r\nAnd at last the troll wearied of getting no answer, so he leaped up and\r\nshouted "Dogs!" and left the hare and scampered away merrily over the\r\nbuttercups, taking any direction that led away from Elfland. And though\r\nthe hare could not quite understand elvish language, yet there was a\r\nvehemence in the tone in which the troll had shouted Dogs which caused\r\napprehension to enter the thoughts of the hare, so that very soon he\r\nforsook his arrangement of grass, and lollopped away through the meadow\r\nwith one scornful look after the troll; but he did not go very fast,\r\ngoing mostly on three legs, with one hind leg all ready to let down if\r\nthere should really be dogs. And soon he paused and sat up and put up\r\nhis ears, and looked across the buttercups and thought deeply. And\r\nbefore the hare had ceased to ponder the troll\'s meaning the troll was\r\nfar out of sight and had forgotten what he had said.\r\n\r\nAnd soon he saw the gables of a farm-house rise up beyond a hedge. They\r\nseemed to look at him with little windows up under red tiles. "A haunt\r\nof man," said the troll. And yet some elvish instinct seemed to tell him\r\nthat it was not here that Princess Lirazel had come. Still, he went\r\nnearer the farm and began to gaze at its poultry. But just at that\r\nmoment a dog saw him, one that had never seen a troll before, and it\r\nuttered one canine cry of astonished indignation, and keeping all the\r\nrest of its breath for the chase, sped after the troll.\r\n\r\nThe troll began at once to rise and dip over the buttercups as though he\r\nhad almost borrowed its speed from the swallow and were riding the lower\r\nair. Such speed was new to the dog, and he went in a long curve after\r\nthe troll, leaning over as he went, his mouth open and silent, the wind\r\nrippling all the way from his nose to his tail in one wavy current. The\r\ncurve was made by the dog\'s baffled hopes to catch the troll as he\r\nslanted across. Soon he was straight behind; and the troll toyed with\r\nspeed; breathing the flowery air in long fresh draughts above the tops\r\nof the buttercups. He thought no more of the dog, but he did not cease\r\nin the flight that the dog had caused, because of the joy of the speed.\r\nAnd this strange chase continued over those fields, the troll driven on\r\nby joy and the dog by duty. For the sake of novelty then the troll put\r\nhis feet together as he leaped over the flowers and, alighting with\r\nrigid knees, fell forwards on to his hands and so turned over; and,\r\nstraightening his elbows suddenly as he turned, shot himself into the\r\nair still turning over and over. He did this several times, increasing\r\nthe indignation of the dog, who knew well enough that that was no way to\r\ngo over the fields we know. But for all his indignation the dog had seen\r\nclear enough that he would never catch that troll, and presently he\r\nreturned to the farm, and found his master there and went up to him\r\nwagging his tail. So hard he wagged it that the farmer was sure he had\r\ndone some useful thing, and patted him, and there the matter ended.\r\n\r\nAnd it was well enough for the farmer that his dog has chased that troll\r\nfrom his farm; for had it communicated to his livestock any of the\r\nwonder of Elfland they would have mocked at Man, and that farmer would\r\nhave lost the allegiance of all but his staunch dog.\r\n\r\nAnd the troll went on gaily over the tips of the buttercups.\r\n\r\nPresently he saw rising up all white over the flowers a fox that was\r\nfacing him with his white chest and chin, and watching the troll as it\r\nwent. The troll went near to him and took a look. And the fox went on\r\nwatching him, for the fox watches all things.\r\n\r\nHe had come back lately to those dewy fields from slinking by night\r\nalong the boundary of twilight that lies between here and Elfland. He\r\neven prowls inside the very boundary, walking amongst the twilight; and\r\nit is in the mystery of that heavy twilight that lies between here and\r\nthere that there clings to him some of that glamour that he brings with\r\nhim to our fields.\r\n\r\n"Well, Noman\'s Dog," said the troll. For they know the fox in Elfland,\r\nfrom seeing him often go dimly along their borders; and this is the name\r\nthey give him.\r\n\r\n"Well, Thing-over-the-Border," said the fox when he answered at all. For\r\nhe knew troll-talk.\r\n\r\n"Are the haunts of men near here?" said the troll.\r\n\r\nThe fox moved his whiskers by slightly wrinkling his lip. Like all liars\r\nhe reflected before he spoke, and sometimes even let wise silences do\r\nbetter than speech.\r\n\r\n"Men live here and men live there," said the fox.\r\n\r\n"I want their haunts," said the troll.\r\n\r\n"What for?" said the fox.\r\n\r\n"I have a message from the King of Elfland."\r\n\r\nThe fox showed no respect or fear at the mention of that dread name, but\r\nslightly moved his head and eyes to conceal the awe that he felt.\r\n\r\n"If it is a message," he said, "their haunts are over there." And he\r\npointed with his long thin nose towards Erl.\r\n\r\n"How shall I know when I get there?" said the troll.\r\n\r\n"By the smell," said the fox. "It is a big haunt of men, and the smell\r\nis dreadful."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, Noman\'s Dog," said the troll. And he seldom thanked anyone.\r\n\r\n"I should never go near them," said the fox, "but for ..." And he paused\r\nand reflected silently.\r\n\r\n"But for what?" said the troll.\r\n\r\n"But for their poultry." And he fell into a grave silence.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Noman\'s Dog," said the troll and turned head-over-heels, and\r\nwas off on his way to Erl.\r\n\r\nPassing over the buttercups all through the dewy morning the troll was\r\nfar on his way by the afternoon, and saw before evening the smoke and\r\nthe towers of Erl. It was all sunk in a hollow; and gables and chimneys\r\nand towers peered over the lip of the valley, and smoke hung over them\r\non the dreamy air. "The haunts of men," said the troll. Then he sat\r\ndown amongst the grasses and looked at it.\r\n\r\nPresently he went nearer and looked at it again. He did not like the\r\nlook of the smoke and that crowd of gables: certainly it smelt\r\ndreadfully. There had been some legend in Elfland of the wisdom of Man;\r\nand whatever respect that legend had gained for us in the light mind of\r\nthe troll now all blew lightly away as he looked at the crowded houses.\r\nAnd as he looked at them there passed a child of four, a small girl on a\r\nfootpath over the fields, going home in the evening to Erl. They looked\r\nat each other with round eyes.\r\n\r\n"Hullo," said the child.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Child of Men," said the troll.\r\n\r\nHe was not speaking troll-talk now, but the language of Elfland, that\r\ngrander tongue that he had had to speak when he was before the King: for\r\nhe knew the language of Elfland although it was never used in the homes\r\nof the trolls, who preferred troll-talk. This language was spoken in\r\nthose days also by men, for there were fewer languages then, and the\r\nelves and the people of Erl both used the same.\r\n\r\n"What are you?" said the child.\r\n\r\n"A troll of Elfland," answered the troll.\r\n\r\n"So I thought," said the child.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going, child of men?" the troll asked.\r\n\r\n"To the houses," the child replied.\r\n\r\n"We don\'t want to go there," said the troll.\r\n\r\n"N-no," said the child.\r\n\r\n"Come to Elfland," the troll said.\r\n\r\nThe child thought for awhile. Other children had gone, and the elves\r\nalways sent a changeling in their place, so that nobody quite missed\r\nthem and nobody really knew. She thought awhile of the wonder and\r\nwildness of Elfland, and then of her own home.\r\n\r\n"N-no," said the child.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" said the troll.\r\n\r\n"Mother made a jam roll this morning," said the child. And she walked on\r\ngravely home. Had it not been for that chance jam roll she had gone to\r\nElfland.\r\n\r\n"Jam!" said the troll contemptuously and thought of the tarns of\r\nElfland, the great lily-leaves lying flat upon their solemn waters, the\r\nhuge blue lilies towering into the elf-light above the green deep tarns:\r\nfor jam this child had forsaken them!\r\n\r\nThen he thought of his duty again, the roll of parchment and the Elf\r\nKing\'s rune for his daughter. He had carried the parchment in his left\r\nhand when he ran, in his mouth when he somersaulted over the buttercups.\r\nWas the Princess here he thought? Or were there other haunts of men? As\r\nevening drew in he crept nearer and nearer the homes, to hear without\r\nbeing seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                       _The Arrival of the Rune_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a sunny May morning in Erl the witch Ziroonderel sat in the castle\r\nnursery by the fire, cooking a meal for the baby. The boy was now three\r\nyears old, and still Lirazel had not named him; for she feared lest some\r\njealous spirit of Earth or air should hear the name, and if so she would\r\nnot say what she feared then. And Alveric had said he must be named.\r\n\r\nAnd the boy could bowl a hoop; for the witch had gone one misty night to\r\nher hill and had brought him a moon-halo which she got by enchantment at\r\nmoonrise, and had hammered it into a hoop, and had made him a little rod\r\nof thunderbolt-iron with which to beat it along.\r\n\r\nAnd now the boy was waiting for his breakfast; and there was a spell\r\nacross the threshold to keep the nursery snug, which Ziroonderel had put\r\nthere with a wave of her ebon stick, and it kept out rats and mice and\r\ndogs, nor could bats sail across it, and the watchful nursery cat it\r\nkept at home: no lock that blacksmiths made was any stronger.\r\n\r\nSuddenly over the threshold and over the spell the troll jumped\r\nsomersaulting through the air and came down sitting. The crude wooden\r\nnursery-clock hanging over the fire stopped its loud tick as he came;\r\nfor he bore with him a little charm against time, with strange grass\r\nround one of his fingers, that he might not be withered away in the\r\nfields we know. For well the Elf King knew the flight of our hours: four\r\nyears had swept over these fields of ours while he had boomed down his\r\nbrazen steps and sent for his troll and given him that spell to bind\r\nround one of his fingers.\r\n\r\n"What\'s this?" said Ziroonderel.\r\n\r\nThat troll knew well when to be impudent, but looking in the witch\'s\r\neyes saw something to be afraid of; and well he might, for those eyes\r\nhad looked in the Elf King\'s own. Therefore he played, as we say in\r\nthese fields, his best card, and answered: "A message from the King of\r\nElfland."\r\n\r\n"Is that so?" said the old witch. "Yes, yes," she added more lowly to\r\nherself, "that would be for my lady. Yes, that would come."\r\n\r\nThe troll sat still on the floor fingering the roll of parchment inside\r\nof which was written the rune of the King of Elfland. Then over the end\r\nof his bed, as he waited for breakfast, the baby saw the troll, and\r\nasked him who he was and where he came from and what he was able to do.\r\nWhen the baby asked him what he was able to do the troll jumped up and\r\nskipped about the room like a moth on a lamp-lit ceiling. From floor to\r\nshelves and back and up again he went with leaps like flying; the baby\r\nclapped his hands, the cat was furious; the witch raised her ebon stick\r\nand made a charm against leaping, but it could not hold the troll. He\r\nleaped and bounced and bounded, while the cat hissed all the curses that\r\nthe feline language knows, and Ziroonderel was wrath not only because\r\nher magic was thwarted, but because with mere human alarm she feared for\r\nher cups and saucers; and the baby shouted all the while for more. And\r\nall at once the troll remembered his errand and the dread parchment he\r\nbore.\r\n\r\n"Where is the Princess Lirazel?" he said to the witch.\r\n\r\nAnd the witch pointed the way to the princess\'s tower; for she knew that\r\nthere were no means nor power she had by which to hinder a rune from the\r\nKing of Elfland. And as the troll turned to go Lirazel entered the room.\r\nHe bowed all low before this great lady of Elfland and, with all his\r\nimpudence in a moment lost, kneeled on one knee before the blaze of her\r\nbeauty and presented the Elf King\'s rune. The boy was shouting to his\r\nmother to demand more leaps from the troll, as she took the scroll in\r\nher hand; the cat with her back to a box was watching alertly;\r\nZiroonderel was all silent.\r\n\r\nAnd then the troll thought of the weed-green tarns of Elfland in the\r\nwoods that the trolls knew; he thought of the wonder of the unwithering\r\nflowers that time has never touched; the deep, deep colour and the\r\nperpetual calm: his errand was over and he was weary of Earth.\r\n\r\nFor a moment nothing moved there but the baby, shouting for new troll\r\nantics and waving his arms: Lirazel stood with the elfin scroll in her\r\nhand, the troll knelt before her, the witch never stirred, the cat stood\r\nwatching fiercely, even the clock was still. Then the Princess moved and\r\nthe troll rose to his feet, the witch sighed and the cat gave up her\r\nwatchfulness as the troll scampered away. And though the baby shouted\r\nfor the troll to return it never heeded, but twisted down the long\r\nspiral stairs, and slipping out through a door was off towards Elfland.\r\nAs the troll passed over the threshold the wooden clock ticked again.\r\n\r\nLirazel looked at the scroll and looked at her boy, and did not unroll\r\nthe parchment, but turned and carried it away, and came to her chamber\r\nand locked the scroll in a casket, and left it there unread. For her\r\nfears told her well the most potent rune of her father, that she had\r\ndreaded so much as she fled from his silver tower and heard his feet go\r\nbooming up the brass, had crossed the frontier of twilight written upon\r\nthe scroll, and would meet her eyes the moment she unrolled it and waft\r\nher thence.\r\n\r\nWhen the rune was safe in the casket she went to Alveric to tell him of\r\nthe peril that had come near her. But Alveric was troubled because she\r\nwould not name the baby, and asked her at once about this. And so she\r\nsuggested a name at last to him; and it was one that no one in these\r\nfields could pronounce, an elvish name full of wonder, and made of\r\nsyllables like birds\' cries at night: Alveric would have none of it. And\r\nher whim in this came, as all the whims she had, from no customary thing\r\nof these fields of ours, but sheer over the border from Elfland, sheer\r\nover the border with all wild fancies that rarely visit our fields. And\r\nAlveric was vexed with these whims, for there had been none like them of\r\nold in the Castle of Erl: none could interpret them to him and none\r\nadvise him. He looked for her to be guided by old customs; she looked\r\nonly for some wild fancy to come from the south-east. He reasoned with\r\nher with the human reason that folk set much store by here, but she did\r\nnot want reason. And so when they parted she had not after all told\r\nanything of the peril that had sought her from Elfland, which she had\r\ncome to Alveric to tell.\r\n\r\nShe went instead to her tower and looked at the casket, shining there in\r\nthe low late light; and turned from it and often looked again; while\r\nthe light went under the fields and the gloaming came, and all glimmered\r\naway. She sat then by the casement open towards eastern hills, above\r\nwhose darkening curves she watched the stars. She watched so long that\r\nshe saw them change their places. For more than all things else that she\r\nhad seen since she came to these fields of ours she had wondered at the\r\nstars. She loved their gentle beauty; and yet she was sad as she looked\r\nwistfully to them, for Alveric had said that she must not worship them.\r\n\r\nHow if she might not worship them could she give them their due, could\r\nshe thank them for their beauty, could she praise their joyful calm? And\r\nthen she thought of her baby: then she saw Orion: then she defied all\r\njealous spirits of air, and, looking toward Orion, whom she must never\r\nworship, she offered her baby\'s days to that belted hunter, naming her\r\nbaby after those splendid stars.\r\n\r\nAnd when Alveric came to the tower she told him of her wish, and he was\r\nwilling the boy should be named Orion, for all in that valley set much\r\nstore by hunting. And the hope came back to Alveric, which he would not\r\nput away, that being reasonable at last in this, she would now be\r\nreasonable in all other things, and be guided by custom, and do what\r\nothers did, and forsake wild whims and fancies that came over the border\r\nfrom Elfland. And he asked her to worship the holy things of the Freer.\r\nFor never had she given any of these things their due, and knew not\r\nwhich was the holier, his candlestick or his bell, and never would learn\r\nfor ought that Alveric told her.\r\n\r\nAnd now she answered him pleasantly and her husband thought all was\r\nwell, but her thoughts were far with Orion; nor did they ever tarry with\r\ngrave things long, nor could tarry longer amongst them than butterflies\r\ndo in the shade.\r\n\r\nAll that night the casket was locked on the rune of the King of Elfland.\r\n\r\nAnd next morning Lirazel gave little thought to the rune, for they went\r\nwith the boy to the holy place of the Freer; and Ziroonderel came with\r\nthem but waited without. And the folk of Erl came too, as many as could\r\nleave the affairs of man with the fields; and all were there of those\r\nthat had made the parliament, when they went to Alveric\'s sire in the\r\nlong red room. And all of these were glad when they saw the boy and\r\nmarked his strength and growth; and, muttering low together as they\r\nstood in the holy place, they foretold how all should be as they had\r\nplanned. And the Freer came forth and, standing amongst his holy things,\r\nhe gave to the boy before him the name of Orion, though he sooner had\r\ngiven some name of those that he knew to be blessed. And he rejoiced to\r\nsee the boy and to name him there; for by the family that dwelt in the\r\nCastle of Erl all these folk marked the generations, and watched the\r\nages pass, as sometimes we watch the seasons go over some old known\r\ntree. And he bowed himself before Alveric, and was full courteous to\r\nLirazel, yet his courtesy to the princess came not from his heart, for\r\nin his heart he held her in no more reverence than he held a mermaid\r\nthat had forsaken the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd the boy came even so by the name of Orion. And all the folk rejoiced\r\nas he came out with his parents and rejoined Ziroonderel at the edge of\r\nthe holy garden. And Alveric, Lirazel, Ziroonderel and Orion all walked\r\nback to the castle.\r\n\r\nAnd all that day Lirazel did nothing that caused anybody to wonder, but\r\nlet herself be governed by custom and the ways of the fields we know.\r\nOnly, when the stars came out and Orion shone, she knew that their\r\nsplendour had not received its due, and her gratitude to Orion yearned\r\nto be said. She was grateful for his bright beauty that cheered our\r\nfields, and grateful for his protection, of which she felt sure for her\r\nboy, against jealous spirits of air. And all her unsaid thanks so burned\r\nin her heart that all of a sudden she rose and left her tower and went\r\nout to the open starlight, and lifted her face to the stars and the\r\nplace of Orion, and stood all dumb though her thanks were trembling upon\r\nher lips; for Alveric had told her one must not pray to the stars. With\r\nface upturned to all that wandering host she stood long silent, obedient\r\nto Alveric: then she lowered her eyes, and there was a small pool\r\nglimmering in the night, in which all the faces of the stars were\r\nshining. "To pray to the stars," she said to herself in the night, "is\r\nsurely wrong. These images in the water are not the stars. I will pray\r\nto their images, and the stars will know."\r\n\r\nAnd on her knees amongst the iris leaves she prayed at the edge of the\r\npool, and gave thanks to the images of the stars for the joy she had had\r\nof the night, when the constellations shone in their myriad majesty, and\r\nmoved like an army dressed in silver mail, marching from unknown\r\nvictories to conquer in distant wars. She blessed and thanked and\r\npraised those bright reflections shimmering down in the pool, and bade\r\nthem tell her thanks and her praise to Orion, to whom she might not\r\npray. It was thus that Alveric found her, kneeling, bent down in the\r\ndark, and reproached her bitterly. She was worshipping the stars, he\r\nsaid, which were there for no such purpose. And she said she was only\r\nsupplicating their images.\r\n\r\nWe may understand his feelings easily: the strangeness of her, her\r\nunexpected acts, her contrariness to all established things, her scorn\r\nfor custom, her wayward ignorance, jarred on some treasured tradition\r\nevery day. The more romantic she had been far away over the frontier, as\r\ntold of by legend and song, the more difficult it was for her to fill\r\nany place once held by the ladies of that castle who were versed in all\r\nthe lore of the fields we know. And Alveric looked for her to fulfil\r\nduties and follow customs which were all as new to her as the twinkling\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nBut Lirazel felt only that the stars had not their due, and that custom\r\nor reason or whatever men set store by should demand that thanks be\r\ngiven them for their beauty; and she had not thanked them even, but had\r\nsupplicated only their images in the pool.\r\n\r\nThat night she thought of Elfland, where all things were matched with\r\nher beauty, where nothing changed and there were no strange customs, and\r\nno strange magnificences like these stars of ours to whom none gave\r\ntheir due. She thought of the elfin lawns and the towering banks of the\r\nflowers, and the palace that may not be told of but only in song.\r\n\r\nStill locked in the dark of the casket the rune bided its time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                         _Lirazel Blows Away_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the days went by, the Summer passed over Erl, the sun that had\r\ntravelled northward fared South again, it was near to the time when the\r\nswallows left those eaves, and Lirazel had not learnt anything. She had\r\nnot prayed to the stars again, or supplicated their images, but she had\r\nlearned no human customs, and could not see why her love and gratitude\r\nmust remain unexpressed to the stars. And Alveric did not know that the\r\ntime must come when some simple trivial thing would divide them utterly.\r\n\r\nAnd then one day, hoping still, he took her with him to the house of the\r\nFreer to teach her how to worship his holy things. And gladly the good\r\nman brought his candle and bell, and the eagle of brass that held up his\r\nbook when he read, and a little symbolic bowl that had scented water,\r\nand the silver snuffers that put his candle out. And he told her clearly\r\nand simply, as he had told her before, the origin, meaning and mystery\r\nof all these things, and why the bowl was of brass and the snuffer of\r\nsilver, and what the symbols were that were carved on the bowl. With\r\nfitting courtesy he told her these things, even with kindness; and yet\r\nthere was something in his voice as he told, a little distant from her;\r\nand she knew that he spoke as one that walked safe on shore calling far\r\nto a mermaid amid dangerous seas.\r\n\r\nAs they came back to the castle the swallows were grouped to go, sitting\r\nin lines along the battlements. And Lirazel had promised to worship the\r\nholy things of the Freer, like the simple bell-fearing folk of the\r\nvalley of Erl: and a late hope was shining in Alveric\'s mind that even\r\nyet all was well. And for many days she remembered all that the Freer\r\nhad told her.\r\n\r\nAnd one day walking late from the nursery, past tall windows to her\r\ntower, and looking out on the evening, remembering that she must not\r\nworship the stars, she called to mind the holy things of the Freer, and\r\ntried to remember all she was told of them. It seemed so hard to worship\r\nthem just as she should. She knew that before many hours the swallows\r\nwould all be gone; and often when they left her her mood would change;\r\nand she feared that she might forget, and never remember more, how she\r\nought to worship the holy things of the Freer.\r\n\r\nSo she went out into the night again over the grasses to where a thin\r\nbrook ran, and drew out some great flat pebbles that she knew where to\r\nfind, turning her face away from the images of the stars. By day the\r\nstones shone beautifully in the water, all ruddy and mauve; now they\r\nwere all dark. She drew them out and laid them in the meadow: she loved\r\nthese smooth flat stones, for somehow they made her remember the rocks\r\nof Elfland.\r\n\r\nShe laid them all in a row, this for the candlestick, this for the bell,\r\nthat for the holy bowl. "If I can worship these lovely stones as things\r\nought to be worshipped," she said, "I can worship the things of the\r\nFreer."\r\n\r\nThen she kneeled down before the big flat stones and prayed to them as\r\nthough they were Christom things.\r\n\r\nAnd Alveric seeking her in the wide night, wondering what wild fancy had\r\ncarried her whither, heard her voice in the meadow, crooning such\r\nprayers as are offered to holy things.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw the four flat stones to which she prayed, bowed down before\r\nthem in the grass, he said that no worse than this were the darkest ways\r\nof the heathen. And she said "I am learning to worship the holy things\r\nof the Freer."\r\n\r\n"It is the art of the heathen," he said.\r\n\r\nNow of all things that men feared in the valley of Erl they feared most\r\nthe arts of the heathen, of whom they knew nothing but that their ways\r\nwere dark. And he spoke with the anger which men always used when they\r\nspoke there of the heathen. And his anger went to her heart, for she was\r\nbut learning to worship his holy things to please him, and yet he had\r\nspoken like this.\r\n\r\nAnd Alveric would not speak the words that should have been said, to\r\nturn aside anger and soothe her; for no man, he foolishly thought,\r\nshould compromise in matters touching on heathenesse. So Lirazel went\r\nalone all sadly back to her tower. And Alveric stayed to cast the four\r\nflat stones afar.\r\n\r\nAnd the swallows left, and unhappy days went by. And one day Alveric\r\nbade her worship the holy things of the Freer, and she had quite\r\nforgotten how. And he spoke again of the arts of heathenesse. The day\r\nwas shining and the poplars golden and all the aspens red.\r\n\r\nThen Lirazel went to her tower and opened the casket, that shone in the\r\nmorning with the clear autumnal light, and took in her hand the rune of\r\nthe King of Elfland, and carried it with her across the high vaulted\r\nhall, and came to another tower and climbed its steps to the nursery.\r\n\r\nAnd there all day she stayed and played with her child, with the scroll\r\nstill tight in her hand: and, merrily though she played at whiles, yet\r\nthere were strange calms in her eyes, which Ziroonderel watched while\r\nshe wondered. And when the sun was low and she had put the child to bed\r\nshe sat beside him all solemn as she told him childish tales. And\r\nZiroonderel, the wise witch, watched; and for all her wisdom only\r\nguessed how it would be, and knew not how to make it otherwise.\r\n\r\nAnd before sunset Lirazel kissed the boy and unrolled the Elf King\'s\r\nscroll. It was but a petulance that had made her take it from the coffer\r\nin which it lay, and the petulance might have passed and she might not\r\nhave unrolled the scroll, only that it was there in her hand. Partly\r\npetulance, partly wonder, partly whims too idle to name, drew her eyes\r\nto the Elf King\'s words in their coal-black curious characters.\r\n\r\nAnd whatever magic there was in the rune of which I cannot tell (and\r\ndreadful magic there was), the rune was written with love that was\r\nstronger than magic, till those mystical characters glowed with the love\r\nthat the Elf King had for his daughter, and there were blended in that\r\nmighty rune two powers, magic and love, the greatest power there is\r\nbeyond the boundary of twilight with the greatest power there is in the\r\nfields we know. And if Alveric\'s love could have held her he should have\r\ntrusted alone to that love, for the Elf King\'s rune was mightier than\r\nthe holy things of the Freer.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Lirazel read the rune on the scroll than fancies from\r\nElfland began to pour over the border. Some came that would make a\r\nclerk in the City to-day leave his desk at once to dance on the\r\nsea-shore; and some would have driven all the men in a bank to leave\r\ndoors and coffers open and wander away till they came to green open land\r\nand the heathery hills; and some would have made a poet of a man, all of\r\na sudden as he sat at his business. They were mighty fancies that the\r\nElf King summoned by the force of his magical rune. And Lirazel sat\r\nthere with the rune in her hand, helpless amongst this mass of\r\ntumultuous fancies from Elfland. And as the fancies raged and sang and\r\ncalled, more and more over the border, all crowding on one poor mind,\r\nher body grew lighter and lighter. Her feet half rested half floated,\r\nupon the floor; Earth scarcely held her down, so fast was she becoming a\r\nthing of dreams. No love of hers for Earth, or of the children of Earth\r\nfor her, had any longer power to hold her there.\r\n\r\nAnd now came memories of her ageless childhood beside the tarns of\r\nElfland, by the deep forest\'s border, by those delirious lawns, or in\r\nthe palace that may not be told of except only in song. She saw those\r\nthings as clearly as we see small shells in water, looking through clear\r\nice down to the floor of some sleeping lake, a little dimmed in that\r\nother region across the barrier of ice; so too her memories shone a\r\nlittle dimly from across the frontier of Elfland. Little queer sounds of\r\nelfin creatures came to her, scents swam from those miraculous flowers\r\nthat glowed by the lawns she knew, faint sounds of enchanted songs blew\r\nover the border and reached her seated there, voices and melodies and\r\nmemories came floating through the twilight, all Elfland was calling.\r\nThen measured and resonant, and strangely near, she heard her father\'s\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nShe rose at once, and now Earth had lost on her the grip that it only\r\nhas on material things, and a thing of dreams and fancy and fable and\r\nphantasy she drifted from the room; and Ziroonderel had no power to hold\r\nher with any spell, nor had she herself the power even to turn, even to\r\nlook at her boy as she drifted away.\r\n\r\nAnd at that moment a wind came out of the north-west, and entered the\r\nwoods and bared the golden branches, and danced on over the downs, and\r\nled a company of scarlet and golden leaves, that had dreaded this day\r\nbut danced now it had come; and away with a riot of dancing and glory of\r\ncolour, high in the light of the sun that had set from the sight of the\r\nfields, went wind and leaves together. With them went Lirazel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                        _The Ebbing of Elfland_\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning Alveric came up the tower to the witch Ziroonderel, weary\r\nand frantic from searching all night long in strange places for Lirazel.\r\nAll night he had tried to guess what fancy had beckoned her out and\r\nwhither it might have led her; he had searched by the stream by which\r\nshe had prayed to the stones, and the pool where she prayed to the\r\nstars; he had called her name up every tower, and had called it wide in\r\nthe dark, and had had no answer but echo; and so he had come at last to\r\nthe witch Ziroonderel.\r\n\r\n"Whither?" he said, saying no more than that, that the boy might not\r\nknow his fears. Yet Orion knew.\r\n\r\nAnd Ziroonderel all mournfully shook her head. "The way of the leaves,"\r\nshe said. "The way of all beauty."\r\n\r\nBut Alveric did not stay to hear her say more than her first five words;\r\nfor he went with the restlessness with which he had come, straight from\r\nthe room and hastily down the stair, and out at once into the windy\r\nmorning, to see which way those glorious leaves were gone.\r\n\r\nAnd a few leaves that had clung to cold branches longer, when the gay\r\ncompany of their comrades had gone, were now too on the air, going\r\nlonely and last: and Alveric saw they were going south-east towards\r\nElfland.\r\n\r\nHurriedly then he donned his magical sword in its wide scabbard of\r\nleather; and with scanty provisions hastened over the fields, after the\r\nlast of the leaves, whose autumnal glory led him, as many a cause in its\r\nlatter days, all splendid and fallen, leads all manner of men.\r\n\r\nAnd so he came to the upland fields with their grass all grey with dew;\r\nand the air was all sparkling with sunlight, and gay with the last of\r\nthe leaves, but a melancholy seemed to dwell with the sound of the\r\nlowing of cattle.\r\n\r\nIn the calm bright morning with the north-west wind roaming through it\r\nAlveric came by no calm, and never gave up the haste of one who has lost\r\nsomething suddenly: he had the swift movements of such, and the frantic\r\nair. He watched all day over clear wide horizons, south-east where the\r\nleaves were leading; and at evening he looked to see the Elfin\r\nMountains, severe and changeless, unlit by any light we know, the colour\r\nof pale forget-me-nots. He held on restlessly to see their summits, but\r\nnever they came to view.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw the house of the old leather-worker who had made the\r\nscabbard for his sword; and the sight of it brought back to him the\r\nyears that were gone since the evening when first he had seen it,\r\nalthough he never knew how many they were, and could not know, for no\r\none has ever devised any exact calculation whereby to estimate the\r\naction of time in Elfland. Then he looked once more for the pale-blue\r\nElfin Mountains, remembering well where they lay, in their long grave\r\nrow past a point of one of the leather-worker\'s gables, but he saw never\r\na line of them. Then he entered the house and the old man still was\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe leather-worker was wonderfully aged; even the table on which he\r\nworked was much older. He greeted Alveric, remembering who he was, and\r\nAlveric enquired for the old man\'s wife. "She died long ago," he said.\r\nAnd again Alveric felt the baffling flight of those years, which added a\r\nfear to Elfland whither he went, yet he neither thought to turn back nor\r\nreined for a moment his impatient haste. He said a few formal things of\r\nthe old man\'s loss that had happened so long ago. Then "Where are the\r\nElfin Mountains," he asked, "the pale-blue peaks?"\r\n\r\nA look came slowly over the old man\'s face as though he had never seen\r\nthem, as though Alveric being learned spoke of something that the old\r\nleather-worker could not know. No, he did not know, he said. And Alveric\r\nfound that to-day as all those years ago, this old man still refused to\r\nspeak of Elfland. Well, the boundary was only a few yards away; he would\r\ncross it and ask the way of elfin creatures, if he could not see the\r\nmountains to guide him then. The old man offered him food, and he had\r\nnot eaten all day; but Alveric in his haste only asked him once more of\r\nElfland, and the old man humbly said that of such things he knew\r\nnothing. Then Alveric strode away and came to the field he knew, which\r\nhe remembered to be divided by the nebulous border of twilight. And\r\nindeed he had no sooner come to the field than he saw all the toadstools\r\nleaning over one way, and that the way he was going; for just as thorn\r\ntrees all lean away from the sea, so toadstools and every plant that has\r\nany touch of mystery, such as foxgloves, mulleins and certain kinds of\r\norchis, when growing anywhere near it, all lean towards Elfland. By this\r\none may know before one has heard a murmur of waves, or before one has\r\nguessed an influence of magical things, that one comes, as the case may\r\nbe, to the sea or the border of Elfland. And in the air above him\r\nAlveric saw golden birds, and guessed that there had been a storm in\r\nElfland blowing them over the border from the south-east, though a\r\nnorth-west wind blew over the fields we know. And he went on but the\r\nboundary was not there, and he crossed the field as any field we know,\r\nand still he had not come to the fells of Elfland.\r\n\r\nThen Alveric pressed on with a new impatience, with the north-west wind\r\nbehind him. And the Earth began to grow bare and shingly and dull,\r\nwithout flowers, without shade, without colour, with none of those\r\nthings that there are in remembered lands, by which we build pictures of\r\nthem when we are there no more; it was all disenchanted now. Alveric saw\r\na golden bird high up, rushing away to the south-east; and he followed\r\nhis flight hoping soon to see the mountains of Elfland, which he\r\nsupposed to be merely concealed by some magical mist.\r\n\r\nBut still the autumnal sky was bright and clear, and all the horizon\r\nplain, and still there came never a gleam of the Elfin Mountains. And\r\nnot from this did he learn that Elfland had ebbed. But when he saw on\r\nthat desolate shingly plain, untorn by the north-west wind but blooming\r\nfair in the Autumn, a may tree that he remembered a long while since,\r\nall white with blossom that once rejoiced a Spring day far in his\r\nchildhood, then he knew that Elfland had been there and must have\r\nreceded, although he knew not how far. For it is true, and Alveric\r\nknew, that just as the glamour that brightens much of our lives,\r\nespecially in early years, comes from rumours that reach us from Elfland\r\nby various messengers (on whom be blessings and peace), so there returns\r\nfrom our fields to Elfland again, to become a part of its mystery, all\r\nmanner of little memories that we have lost and little devoted toys that\r\nwere treasured once. And this is part of the law of ebb and flow that\r\nscience may trace in all things; thus light grew the forest of coal, and\r\nthe coal gives back light; thus rivers fill the sea, and the sea sends\r\nback to the rivers; thus all things give that receive; even Death.\r\n\r\nNext Alveric saw lying there on the flat dry ground a toy that he yet\r\nremembered, which years and years ago (how could he say how many?) had\r\nbeen a childish joy to him, crudely carved out of wood; and one unlucky\r\nday it had been broken, and one unhappy day it had been thrown away. And\r\nnow he saw it lying there not merely new and unbroken, but with a wonder\r\nabout it, a splendour and a romance, the radiant transfigured thing that\r\nhis young fancy had known. It lay there forsaken of Elfland as wonderful\r\nthings of the sea lie sometimes desolate on wastes of sand, when the sea\r\nis a far blue bulk with a border of foam.\r\n\r\nDreary with lost romance was the plain from which Elfland had gone,\r\nthough here and there Alveric saw again and again those little forsaken\r\nthings that had been lost from his childhood, dropping through time to\r\nthe ageless and hourless region of Elfland to be a part of its glory,\r\nand now left forlorn by this immense withdrawal. Old tunes, old songs,\r\nold voices, hummed there too, growing fainter and fainter, as though\r\nthey could not live long in the fields we know.\r\n\r\nAnd, when the sun set, a mauve-rose glow in the East, that Alveric\r\nfancied a little too gorgeous for Earth, led him onward still; for he\r\ndeemed it to be the reflection cast on the sky by the glow of the\r\nsplendour of Elfland. So he went on hoping to find it, horizon after\r\nhorizon; and night came on with all Earth\'s comrade stars. And only then\r\nAlveric put aside at last that frantic restlessness that had driven him\r\nsince the morning; and, wrapping himself in a loose cloak that he wore,\r\nate such food as he had in a satchel, and slept a troubled sleep alone\r\nwith other forsaken things.\r\n\r\nAt the earliest moment of dawn his impatience awoke him, although one of\r\nOctober\'s mists hid all glimpses of light. He ate the last of his food\r\nand then pushed on through the greyness.\r\n\r\nNo sound from the things of our fields came to him now; for men never\r\nwent that way when Elfland was there, and none but Alveric went now to\r\nthat desolate plain. He had travelled beyond the sound of cock-crow from\r\nthe comfortable houses of men and was now marching through a curious\r\nsilence, broken only now and then by the small dim cries of the lost\r\nsongs that had been left by the ebb of Elfland and were fainter now than\r\nthey had been the day before. And when dawn shone Alveric saw again so\r\ngreat a splendour in the sky, glowing all green low down in the\r\nsouth-east, that he thought once more he saw a reflection from Elfland,\r\nand pressed on hoping to find it over the next horizon. And he passed\r\nthe next horizon; and still that shingly plain, and never a peak of the\r\npale-blue Elfin Mountains.\r\n\r\nWhether Elfland always lay over the next horizon, brightening the clouds\r\nwith its glow, and moved away just as he came, or whether it had gone\r\ndays or years before, he did not know but still kept on and on. And he\r\ncame at last to a dry and grassless ridge on which his eyes and his\r\nhopes had been set for long, and from it he looked far over the desolate\r\nflatness that stretched to the rim of the sky, and saw never a sign of\r\nElfland, never a slope of the mountains: even the little treasures of\r\nmemory that had been left behind by the ebb were withering into things\r\nof our every day. Then Alveric drew his magical sword from its sheath.\r\nBut though that sword had power against enchantment it had not been\r\ngiven the power to bring again an enchantment that was gone; and the\r\ndesolate land remained the same, for all that he waved his sword, stony,\r\ndeserted, unromantic and wide.\r\n\r\nFor a little while he went on; but in that flat land the horizon moved\r\nimperceptibly with him, and never a peak appeared of the Elfin\r\nMountains; and on that dreary plain he soon discovered, as sooner or\r\nlater many a man must, that he had lost Elfland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                        _The Deep of the Woods_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those days Ziroonderel would amuse the boy by charms and by little\r\nwonders, and he was content for a while. And then he began to guess for\r\nhimself, all in silence, where his mother was. He listened to all things\r\nsaid, and thought long about them. And days passed thus and he only knew\r\nshe had gone, and still he said never a word of the thing with which his\r\nthoughts were busy. And then he came to know from things said or unsaid,\r\nor from looks or glances or wagging of heads, that there was a wonder\r\nabout his mother\'s going. But what the wonder was he could not find, for\r\nall the marvels that crossed his mind when he guessed. And at last one\r\nday he asked Ziroonderel.\r\n\r\nAnd stored though her old mind was with ages and ages of wisdom, and\r\nthough she had feared this question, yet she did not know it had dwelt\r\nin his mind for days, and could find no better answer out of her wisdom\r\nthan that his mother had gone to the woods. When the boy heard this he\r\ndetermined to go to the woods to find her.\r\n\r\nNow in his walks abroad with Ziroonderel through the little hamlet of\r\nErl, Orion would see the villagers walking by and the smith at his open\r\nforge, and folk in their doorways, and men that came in to the market\r\nfrom distant fields; and he knew them all. And most of all he knew Threl\r\nwith his quiet feet, and Oth with his lithe limbs; for both of these\r\nwould tell him tales when they met of the uplands, and the deep woods\r\nover the hill; and Orion on little journeys with his nurse loved to hear\r\ntales of far places.\r\n\r\nThere was an ancient myrtle tree by a well, where Ziroonderel would sit\r\nin the Summer evenings while Orion played on the grass; and Oth would\r\ncross the grass with his curious bow, going out in the evening, and\r\nsometimes Threl would come; and every time that one of them came Orion\r\nwould stop him and ask for a tale of the woods. And if it were Oth he\r\nwould bow to Ziroonderel with a look of awe as he bowed, and would tell\r\nsome tale of what the deer did, and Orion would ask him why. Then a look\r\nwould come over Oth\'s face as though he were carefully remembering\r\nthings that had happened very long ago, and after some moments of\r\nsilence he would give the ancient cause of whatever the deer did, which\r\nexplained how they came by the custom.\r\n\r\nIf it were Threl that came across the grass he would appear not to see\r\nZiroonderel and would tell his tale of the woods more hastily in a low\r\nvoice and pass on, leaving the evening, as Orion felt, full of mystery\r\nbehind him. He would tell tales of all manner of creatures; and the\r\ntales were so strange that he told them only to young Orion, because, as\r\nhe explained, there were many folk that were unable to believe the\r\ntruth, and he did not wish his tales to come to the ears of such. Once\r\nOrion had gone to his house, a dark hut full of skins: all kinds of\r\nskins hung on the wall, foxes, badgers, and martens; and there were\r\nsmaller ones in heaps in the corners. To Orion Threl\'s dark hut was more\r\nfull of wonder than any other house he had ever seen.\r\n\r\nBut now it was Autumn and the boy and his nurse saw Oth and Threl more\r\nseldom; for in the misty evenings with the threat of frost in the air\r\nthey sat no longer by the myrtle tree. Yet Orion watched on their short\r\nwalks; and one day he saw Threl going away from the village with his\r\nface to the uplands. And he called to Threl, and Threl stood still with\r\na certain air of confusion, for he deemed himself of too little account\r\nto be clearly seen and noticed by the nurse at the castle, be she witch\r\nor woman. And Orion ran up to him and said "Show me the woods." And\r\nZiroonderel perceived that the time had come when his thoughts were\r\nroaming beyond the lip of the valley, and knew that no spell of hers\r\nwould hold him long from following after them. And Threl said, "No, my\r\nMaster," and looked uneasily at Ziroonderel, who came after the boy and\r\nled him away from Threl. And Threl went on alone to his work in the deep\r\nof the woods.\r\n\r\nAnd it was not otherwise than the witch had foreseen. For first Orion\r\nwept, and then he dreamed of the woods, and next day he slipped away\r\nalone to the house of Oth and asked him to take him with him when he\r\nwent to hunt the deer. And Oth, standing on a wide deer-skin in front of\r\nblazing logs, spoke much of the woods, but did not take him then.\r\nInstead he brought Orion back to the Castle. And Ziroonderel regretted\r\ntoo late that she had idly said his mother was gone to the woods, for\r\nthose words of hers had called up too soon that spirit of roving which\r\nwas bound to come to him, and she saw that her spells could bring\r\ncontent no more. So in the end she let him go to the woods. But not\r\nuntil by lifting of wand and saying of incantation she had called the\r\nglamour of the woods down to the nursery hearth, and had made it haunt\r\nthe shadows that went from the fire and creep with them all about the\r\nroom, till the nursery was all as mysterious as the forest. When this\r\nspell would not soothe him and keep his longing at home she let him go\r\nto the woods.\r\n\r\nHe stole away once more to the house of Oth, over crisp grass one\r\nmorning; and the old witch knew he had gone but did not call him back,\r\nfor she had no spell to curb the love of roving in man, whether it came\r\nearly or late. And she would not hold back his limbs when his heart was\r\ngone to the woods, for it is ever the way of witches with any two things\r\nto care for the more mysterious of the two. So the boy came alone to the\r\nhouse of Oth, through his garden where dead flowers hung on brown\r\nstalks, and the petals turned to slime if he fingered them, for November\r\nwas come and the frosts were abroad all night. And this time Orion just\r\nmet with a mood in Oth, which in less than an hour would have gone, that\r\nwas favourable to the boy\'s longing. Oth was taking down his bow from\r\nthe wall as Orion went in, and Oth\'s heart was gone to the woods; and\r\nwhen the boy came yearning to go to the woods too the hunter in that\r\nmood could not refuse him.\r\n\r\nSo Oth took Orion on his shoulder and went up out of the valley. Folk\r\nsaw them go thus, Oth with his bow and his soft noiseless sandals, and\r\nhis brown garments of leather, Orion on his shoulder, wrapped in the\r\nskin of a fawn which Oth had thrown round him. And as the village fell\r\nbehind them Orion rejoiced to see the houses further and further away,\r\nfor he had never been so far from them before. And when the uplands\r\nopened their distances to his eyes he felt that he was now upon no mere\r\nwalk, but a journey. And then he saw the solemn gloom of the wintry\r\nwoods far off, and that filled him at once with a delighted awe. To\r\ntheir darkness, their mystery and their shelter Oth brought him.\r\n\r\nSo softly Oth entered the wood that the blackbirds that guarded it,\r\nsitting watchful on branches, did not flee at his coming, but only\r\nuttered slowly their warning notes, and listened suspiciously till he\r\npassed, and were never sure if a man had broken the charm of the wood.\r\nInto that charm and the gloom and the deep silence Oth moved gravely;\r\nand a solemness came on his face as he entered the wood; for to go on\r\nquiet feet through the wood was the work of his life, and he came to it\r\nas men come to their heart\'s desire. And soon he put the boy down on the\r\nbrown bracken and went on for a while alone. Orion watched him go with\r\nhis bow in his left hand, till he disappeared in the wood, like a shadow\r\ngoing to a gathering of shadows and merging amongst its fellows. And\r\nalthough Orion might not go with him now, he had great joy from this,\r\nfor he knew by the way Oth went and the air he had that this was serious\r\nhunting and no mere amusement made to please a child; and it pleased him\r\nmore than all the toys he had had. And quiet and lonely the great wood\r\nloomed round him while he waited for Oth to return.\r\n\r\nAnd after a long while he heard a sound, all in the wonder of the wood,\r\nthat was less loud than the sound that a blackbird made scattering dead\r\nleaves to find insects, and Oth had come back again.\r\n\r\nHe had not found a deer; and for a while he sat by Orion and shot arrows\r\ninto a tree; but soon he gathered his arrows and took the boy on his\r\nshoulder again and turned homewards. And there were tears in Orion\'s\r\neyes when they left the great wood; for he loved the mystery of the huge\r\ngrey oaks, which we may pass by unnoticed or with but a momentary\r\nfeeling of something forgotten, some message not quite given; but to him\r\ntheir spirits were playmates. So he came back to Erl as from new\r\ncompanions with his mind full of hints that he had from the wise old\r\ntrunks, for to him each bole had a meaning. And Ziroonderel was waiting\r\nat the gateway when Oth brought Orion back; and she asked little of his\r\ntime in the woods, and answered little when he told her of it, for she\r\nwas jealous of them whose spell had lured him from hers. And all that\r\nnight his dreams hunted deer in the deeps of the wood.\r\n\r\nNext day he stole away again to the house of Oth. But Oth was away\r\nhunting, for he was in need of meat. So he went to the house of Threl.\r\nAnd there was Threl in his dark house amongst manifold skins. "Take me\r\nto the woods," said Orion. And Threl sat down in a wide wooden chair by\r\nhis fire to think about it and to talk of the woods. He was not like\r\nOth, speaking of a few simple things which he knew, of the deer, of the\r\nways of the deer, and of the approach of the seasons; but he spoke of\r\nthe things that he guessed in the deep of the wood and in the dark of\r\ntime, the fables of men and of beasts; and especially he cared to tell\r\nthe fables of the foxes and badgers, which he had come by from watching\r\ntheir ways at the falling of dusk. And as he sat there gazing into the\r\nfire, telling reminiscently of the ancient ways of the dwellers in\r\nbracken and bramble, Orion forgot his longing to go to the woods, and\r\nsat there on a small chair warm with skins, content. And to Threl he\r\ntold what he had not said to Oth, how he thought that his mother might\r\ncome one day round the trunk of one of the oak-trees, for she had gone\r\nfor a while to the woods. And Threl thought that that might be; for\r\nthere was nothing wonderful told of the woods that Threl thought\r\nunlikely.\r\n\r\nAnd then Ziroonderel came for Orion and took him back to the Castle. And\r\nthe next day she let him go to Oth again; and this time Oth took him\r\nonce more to the wood. And a few days later he went again to Threl\'s\r\ndark house, in whose cobwebs and corners seemed to lurk the mystery of\r\nthe forest, and heard Threl\'s curious tales.\r\n\r\nAnd the branches of the forest grew black and still against the blaze of\r\nfierce sunsets, and Winter began to lay its spell on the uplands, and\r\nthe wiser ones of the village prophesied snow. And one day Orion out in\r\nthe woods with Oth saw the hunter shoot a stag. He watched him prepare\r\nit and skin it and cut it into two pieces and tie them up in the skin,\r\nwith the head and horns hanging down. Then Oth fastened up the horns to\r\nthe rest of the bundle and heaved it on to his shoulder, and with his\r\ngreat strength carried it home. And the boy rejoiced more than the\r\nhunter.\r\n\r\nAnd that evening Orion went to tell the story to Threl, but Threl had\r\nmore wonderful stories.\r\n\r\nAnd so the days went by, while Orion drew from the forest and from the\r\ntales of Threl a love of all things that pertain to a hunter\'s calling,\r\nand a spirit grew in him that was well-matched with the name he bore;\r\nand nothing showed in him, yet, of the magical part of his lineage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                        _The Unenchanted Plain_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Alveric understood that he had lost Elfland it was already evening\r\nand he had been gone two days and a night from Erl. For the second time\r\nhe lay down for the night on that shingly plain whence Elfland had ebbed\r\naway: and at sunset the eastern horizon showed clear against turquoise\r\nsky, all black and jagged with rocks, without any sign of Elfland. And\r\nthe twilight glimmered, but it was Earth\'s twilight, and not that dense\r\nbarrier for which Alveric looked, which lies between Elfland and Earth.\r\nAnd the stars came out and were the stars we know, and Alveric slept\r\nbelow their familiar constellations.\r\n\r\nHe awoke in the birdless dawn very cold, hearing old voices crying\r\nfaintly far off, as they slowly drifted away, like dreams going back to\r\ndreamland. He wondered if they would come to Elfland again, or if\r\nElfland had ebbed too far. He searched all the horizon eastwards, and\r\nstill saw nothing but the rocks of that desolate land. So he turned\r\nagain toward the fields we know.\r\n\r\nHe walked back through the cold with all his impatience gone; and\r\ngradually some warmth came to him from walking, and later a little from\r\nthe autumnal sun. He walked all day, and the sun was growing huge and\r\nred when he came again to the leather-worker\'s cottage. He asked for\r\nfood, and the old man made him welcome: his pot was already simmering\r\nfor his own evening meal: and it was not long before Alveric was sitting\r\nat the old table before a dish full of squirrels\' legs, hedge-hogs and\r\nrabbit\'s meat. The old man would not eat till Alveric had eaten, but\r\nwaited on him with such solicitude that Alveric felt that the moment of\r\nhis opportunity was come, and turned to the old man as he offered him a\r\npiece of the back of a rabbit, and approached the subject of Elfland.\r\n\r\n"The twilight is further away," said Alveric.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said the old man without any meaning in his voice, whatever\r\nhe had in his mind.\r\n\r\n"When did it go?" said Alveric.\r\n\r\n"The twilight, master?" said his host.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Alveric.\r\n\r\n"Ah, the twilight," the old man said.\r\n\r\n"The barrier," said Alveric, and he lowered his voice, although he knew\r\nnot why, "between here and Elfland."\r\n\r\nAt the word Elfland all comprehension faded out of the old man\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"Ah," he said.\r\n\r\n"Old man," said Alveric, "you know where Elfland has gone."\r\n\r\n"Gone?" said the old man.\r\n\r\nThat innocent surprise, thought Alveric, must be real; but at least he\r\nknew where it had been; it used to be only two fields away from his\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"Elfland was in the next field once," said Alveric.\r\n\r\nAnd the old man\'s eyes roved back into the past, and he gazed as it\r\nwere on old days awhile, then he shook his head. And Alveric fixed him\r\nwith his eye.\r\n\r\n"You knew Elfland," he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nStill the old man did not answer.\r\n\r\n"You knew where the border was," said Alveric.\r\n\r\n"I am old," said the leather-worker, "and I have no one to ask."\r\n\r\nWhen he said that, Alveric knew that he was thinking of his old wife,\r\nand he knew too that had she been alive and standing there at that\r\nmoment yet he would have had no news of Elfland: there seemed little\r\nmore to say. But a certain petulance held him to the subject after he\r\nknew it to be hopeless.\r\n\r\n"Who lives to the East of here?" he said.\r\n\r\n"To the East?" the old man replied. "Master, are there not North and\r\nSouth and West that you needs must look to the East?"\r\n\r\nThere was a look of entreaty in his face but Alveric did not heed it.\r\n"Who lives to the East?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Master, no one lives to the East," he answered. And that indeed was\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\n"What used to be there?" said Alveric.\r\n\r\nAnd the old man turned away to see to the stewing of his pot, and\r\nmuttered as he turned, so that one hardly heard him.\r\n\r\n"The past," he said.\r\n\r\nNo more would the old man say, nor explain what he had said. So Alveric\r\nasked him if he could have a bed for the night, and his host showed him\r\nthe old bed he remembered across that vague number of years. And Alveric\r\naccepted the bed without more ado so as to let the old man go to his own\r\nsupper. And very soon Alveric was deep asleep, warm and resting at last,\r\nwhile his host turned over slowly in his mind many things of which\r\nAlveric had supposed he knew nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen the birds of our fields woke Alveric, singing late in the last of\r\nOctober, on a morning that reminded them of Spring, he rose and went out\r\nof doors, and went to the highest part of the little field that lay on\r\nthe windowless side of the old man\'s house toward Elfland. There he\r\nlooked eastward and saw all the way to the curved line of the sky the\r\nsame barren, desolate, rocky plain that had been there yesterday and the\r\nday before. Then the leather-worker gave him breakfast, and afterwards\r\nhe went out and looked again at the plain. And over his dinner, which\r\nhis host timidly shared, Alveric neared once more the subject of\r\nElfland. And something in the old man\'s sayings or silences made Alveric\r\nhopeful that even yet he would have some news of the whereabouts of the\r\npale-blue Elfin Mountains. So he brought the old man out and turned to\r\nthe East, to which his companion looked with reluctant eyes; and\r\npointing to one particular rock, the most noticeable and near, said,\r\nhoping for definite news of a definite thing, "How long has that rock\r\nbeen there?"\r\n\r\nAnd the answer came to his hopes like hail to apple-blossom: "It is\r\nthere and we must make the best of it."\r\n\r\nThe unexpectedness of the answer dazed Alveric; and when he saw that\r\nreasonable questions about definite things brought him no logical answer\r\nhe despaired of getting practical information to guide his fantastic\r\njourney. So he walked on the eastward side of the cottage all the\r\nafternoon, watching the dreary plain, and it never changed or moved: no\r\npale-blue mountains appeared, no Elfland came flooding back: and evening\r\ncame and the rocks glowed dully with the low rays of the sun, and\r\ndarkened when it set, changing with all Earth\'s changes, but with no\r\nenchantment of Elfland. Then Alveric decided on a great journey.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the cottage and told the leather-worker that he needed to\r\nbuy much provisions, as much as he could carry. And over supper they\r\nplanned what he should have. And the old man promised to go next day\r\namongst the neighbours; telling of all the things he would get from\r\neach, and somewhat more if God should prosper his snaring. For Alveric\r\nhad determined to travel eastward till he found the lost land.\r\n\r\nAnd Alveric slept early, and slept long, till the last of his fatigue\r\nwas gone which came from his pursuit of Elfland: the old man woke him as\r\nhe came back from his snaring. And the creatures that he had snared the\r\nold man put in his pot and hung it over his fire, while Alveric ate his\r\nbreakfast. And all the morning the leather-worker went from house to\r\nhouse amongst his neighbours, dwelling on little farms at the edge of\r\nthe fields we know; and he got salted meats from some, bread from one, a\r\ncheese from another, and came back burdened to his house in time to\r\nprepare dinner.\r\n\r\nAnd all the provender that burdened the old man Alveric shouldered in a\r\nsack, and some he put in his wallet; and he filled his water-bottle and\r\ntwo more besides that his host had made from large skins, for he had\r\nseen no streams at all in the desolate land; and thus equipped he walked\r\nsome way from the cottage, and looked again at the land from which\r\nElfland had ebbed. He came back satisfied that he could carry provisions\r\nfor a fortnight.\r\n\r\nAnd in the evening while the old man prepared pieces of squirrels\' meat\r\nAlveric stood again on the windowless side of the cottage, gazing still\r\nacross the lonely land, hoping always to see emerge from the clouds\r\nthat were colouring at sunset, those serene pale-blue mountains; and\r\nseeing never a peak. And the sun set, and that was the last of October.\r\n\r\nNext morning Alveric made a good meal in the cottage; then took his\r\nheavy burden of provisions, and paid his host and started. The door of\r\nthe cottage opened toward the West and the old man cordially saw him\r\naway from his door with godspeed and farewells, but he would not move\r\nround his house to watch him going eastward; nor would he speak of that\r\njourney: it was as though to him there were only three points of the\r\ncompass.\r\n\r\nThe bright autumnal sun was not yet high when Alveric went from the\r\nfields we know to the land that Elfland had left and that nothing else\r\nwent near, with his big sack over his shoulder and his sword at his\r\nside. The may trees of memory that he had seen were all withered now,\r\nand the old songs and voices that had haunted that land were all now\r\nfaint as sighs; and there seemed to be fewer of them, as though some had\r\nalready died or had struggled back to Elfland.\r\n\r\nAll that day Alveric travelled, with the vigour that waits at the\r\nbeginning of journeys, which helped him on though he was burdened with\r\nso much provisions, and a big blanket that he wore like a heavy cloak\r\nround his shoulders; and he carried besides a bundle of firewood, and a\r\nstave in his right hand. He was an incongruous figure with his stave and\r\nhis sack and his sword; but he followed one idea, one inspiration, one\r\nhope; and so shared something of the strangeness that all men have who\r\ndo this.\r\n\r\nHalting at noon to eat and rest he went slowly on again and walked till\r\nevening: even then he did not rest as he had intended, for when twilight\r\nfell and lay heavy along the eastern sky he continually rose from his\r\nresting and went a little further to see if it might not be that dense\r\ndeep twilight that made the frontier of the fields we know, shutting\r\nthem off from Elfland. But it was always earthly twilight, until the\r\nstars came out, and they were all the familiar stars that look on Earth.\r\nThen he lay down among those unrounded and mossless rocks, and ate bread\r\nand cheese and drank water; and as the cold of night began to come over\r\nthe plain he lit a small fire with his scanty bundle of wood and lay\r\nclose to it with his cloak and his blanket round him; and before the\r\nembers were black he was sound asleep.\r\n\r\nDawn came without sound of bird or whisper of leaves or grasses, dawn\r\ncame in dead silence and cold; and nothing on all that plain gave a\r\nwelcome back to the light.\r\n\r\nIf darkness had lain forever upon those angular rocks it were better,\r\nAlveric thought, as he saw their shapeless companies sullenly glowing;\r\ndarkness were better now that Elfland was gone. And though the misery of\r\nthat disenchanted place entered his spirit with the chill of the dawn,\r\nyet his fiery hope still shone, and gave him little time to eat by the\r\ncold black circle of his lonely fire before it hurried him onward\r\neasterly over the rocks. And all that morning he travelled on without\r\nthe comradeship of a blade of grass. The golden birds that he had seen\r\nbefore had long since fled back to Elfland, and the birds of our fields\r\nand all living things we know shunned all that empty waste. Alveric\r\ntravelled as much alone as a man who goes back in memory to revisit\r\nremembered scenes, and instead of remembered scenes he was in a place\r\nfrom which every glamour had gone. He travelled somewhat lighter than on\r\nthe day before, but he went more wearily, for he felt more heavily now\r\nthe fatigue of the previous day. He rested long at mid-day and then went\r\non. The myriad rocks stretched on and slightly jagged the horizon, and\r\nall day there came no glimpse of the pale-blue mountains. That evening\r\nfrom his dwindling provision of wood Alveric made another fire; its\r\nlittle flame going up alone in that waste seemed somehow to reveal the\r\nmonstrous loneliness. He sat by his fire and thought of Lirazel and\r\nwould not give up hope, though a glance at those rocks might have warned\r\nhim not to hope, for something in their chaotic look partook of the\r\nplain that bred them, and they hinted it to be infinite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                 _The Reticence of the Leather-Worker_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was many days before Alveric learned from the monotony of the rocks\r\nthat one day\'s journey was the same as another, and that by no number of\r\njourneys would he bring any change to his rugged horizons, which were\r\nall drearily like the ones they replaced and never brought a view of the\r\npale-blue mountains. He had gone, while his fortnight\'s provisions grew\r\nlighter and lighter, for ten days over the rocks: it was now evening and\r\nAlveric understood at last that if he travelled further and failed soon\r\nto see the peaks of the Elfin Mountains he would starve. So he ate his\r\nsupper sparingly in the darkness, his bundle of firewood having long\r\nsince been used, and abandoned the hope that had led him. And as soon as\r\nthere was any light at all to show him where the East was he ate a\r\nlittle of what he had saved from his supper, and started his long tramp\r\nback to the fields of men, over rocks that seemed all the harsher\r\nbecause his back was to Elfland. All that day he ate and drank little,\r\nand by nightfall he still had left full provisions for four more days.\r\n\r\nHe had hoped to travel faster during these last days, if he should have\r\nto turn back, because he would travel lighter: he had given no thought\r\nto the power of those monotonous rocks to weary and to depress with\r\ntheir desolation when the hope that had somewhat illumined their\r\ngrimness was gone: he had thought little of turning back at all, till\r\nthe tenth evening came and no pale-blue mountains, and he suddenly\r\nlooked at his provisions. And all the monotony of his homeward journey\r\nwas broken only by occasional fears that he might not be able to come to\r\nthe fields we know.\r\n\r\nThe myriad rocks lay larger and thicker than tombstones and not so\r\ncarefully shaped, yet the waste had the look of a graveyard stretching\r\nover the world with unrecording stones above nameless heads. Chilled by\r\nthe bitter nights, guided by blazing sunsets, he went on through the\r\nmorning mists and the empty noons and weary birdless evenings. More than\r\na week went by since he had turned, and the last of his water was gone,\r\nand still he saw no sign of the fields we know, or anything more\r\nfamiliar than rocks that he seemed to remember and which would have\r\nmisled him northward, southward, or eastward, were it not for the red\r\nNovember sun that he followed and sometimes some friendly star. And then\r\nat last, just as the darkness fell blackening that rocky multitude,\r\nthere showed westward over the rocks, pale at first against remnants of\r\nsunset, but growing more and more orange, a window under one of the\r\ngables of man. Alveric rose and walked towards it till the rocks in the\r\ndarkness and weariness overcame him and he lay down and slept; and the\r\nlittle yellow window shone into his dreams and made forms of hope as\r\nfair as any that came from Elfland.\r\n\r\nThe house that he saw in the morning when he woke seemed impossible to\r\nbe the one whose tiny light had held out hope and help to him in the\r\nloneliness; it seemed now too plain and common. He recognized it for a\r\nhouse not far from the one of the leather-worker. Soon he came to a pool\r\nand drank. He came to a garden in which a woman was working early, and\r\nshe asked him whence he had come. "From the East," he said, and pointed,\r\nand she did not understand. And so he came again to the cottage from\r\nwhich he had started, to ask once more for hospitality from the old man\r\nwho had housed him twice.\r\n\r\nHe was standing in his doorway as Alveric came, walking wearily, and\r\nagain he made him welcome. He gave him milk and then food. And Alveric\r\nate, and then rested all the day: it was not till evening he spoke. But\r\nwhen he had eaten and rested and he was at the table again, and supper\r\nwas now before him and there was light and warmth, he felt all at once\r\nthe need of human speech. And then he poured out the story of that great\r\njourney over the land where the things of man ceased, and where yet no\r\nbirds or little beasts had come, or even flowers, a chronicle of\r\ndesolation. And the old man listened to the vivid words and said\r\nnothing, making some comments of his own only when Alveric spoke of the\r\nfields we know. He heard with politeness but said never a word of the\r\nland from which Elfland had ebbed. It was indeed as though all the land\r\nto the East were delusion, and as though Alveric had been restored from\r\nit or had awoken from dream, and were now among reasonably daily things,\r\nand there was nothing to say of the things of dream. Certainly never a\r\nword would the old man say in recognition of Elfland, or of anything\r\neighty yards East of his cottage door. Then Alveric went to his bed and\r\nthe old man sat alone till his fire was low, thinking of what he had\r\nheard and shaking his head. And all the next day Alveric rested there\r\nor walked in the old man\'s autumn-smitten garden, and sometimes he tried\r\nagain to speak with his host of his great journey in the desolate land,\r\nbut got from him no admission that such lands were, checked always by\r\nhis avoidance of the topic, as though to speak of these lands might\r\nbring them nearer.\r\n\r\nAnd Alveric pondered on many reasons for this. Had the old man been to\r\nElfland in his youth and seen something he greatly feared, perhaps\r\nbarely escaping from death or an age-long love? Was Elfland a mystery\r\ntoo great to be troubled by human voices? Did these folk dwelling there\r\nat the edge of our world know well the unearthly beauty of all the\r\nglories of Elfland, and fear that even to speak of them might be a lure\r\nto draw them whither their resolution, barely perhaps, held them back?\r\nOr might a word said of the magical land bring it nearer, to make\r\nfantastic and elvish the fields we know? To all these ponderings of\r\nAlveric there was no answer.\r\n\r\nAnd yet one more day Alveric rested, and after that he set out to return\r\nto Erl. He set out in the morning, and his host came with him out of his\r\ndoorway, saying farewell and speaking of his journey home and of the\r\naffairs of Erl, which were food for gossip over many farmlands. And\r\ngreat was the contrast between the good man\'s approval that he showed\r\nthus for the fields we know, over which Alveric journeyed now, and his\r\ndisapproval for those other lands whither Alveric\'s hopes still turned.\r\nAnd they parted, and the old man\'s farewells dwindled, and then he\r\nturned back into his house, rubbing his hands contentedly as he slowly\r\nwent, for he was glad to see one who had looked toward the fantastic\r\nlands turn now to a journey across the fields we know.\r\n\r\nIn those fields the frost was master, and Alveric walked over the crisp\r\ngrey grass and breathed the clear fresh air thinking little of his home\r\nor his son, but planning how even yet he might come to Elfland; for he\r\nthought that further North there might be a way, coming round perhaps\r\nbehind the pale-blue mountains. That Elfland had ebbed too far for him\r\nto overtake it there he felt despairingly sure, but scarcely believed it\r\nhad gone along the entire frontier of twilight, where Elfland touches\r\nEarth as far as poet has sung. Further North he might find the frontier,\r\nunmoved, lying sleepy with twilight, and come under the pale-blue\r\nmountains and see his wife again: full of these thoughts he went over\r\nthe misty mellow fields.\r\n\r\nAnd full of his dreams and plans about that phantasmal land he came in\r\nthe afternoon to the woods that brood above Erl. He entered the wood,\r\nand deep though he was amongst thoughts that were far from there, he\r\nsoon saw the smoke of a fire a little way off, rising grey among the\r\ndark oak-boles. He went towards it to see who was there, and there were\r\nhis son and Ziroonderel warming their hands at the fire.\r\n\r\n"Where have you been?" called Orion as soon as he saw him.\r\n\r\n"Upon a journey," said Alveric.\r\n\r\n"Oth is hunting," Orion said, and he pointed in the direction whence the\r\nwind was fanning the smoke. And Ziroonderel said nothing, for she saw\r\nmore in Alveric\'s eyes than any questions of hers would have drawn from\r\nhis tongue. Then Orion showed him a deer-skin on which he was sitting.\r\n"Oth shot it," he said.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be a magic all round that fire of big logs quietly\r\nsmouldering in the woods upon Autumn\'s discarded robe that lay brilliant\r\nthere; and it was not the magic of Elfland, nor had Ziroonderel called\r\nit up with her wand: it was only a magic of the wood\'s very own.\r\n\r\nAnd Alveric stood there for a while in silence, watching the boy and the\r\nwitch by their fire in the woods, and understanding that the time was\r\ncome when he must tell Orion things that were not clear to himself and\r\nthat were puzzling him even now. Yet he did not speak of them then, but\r\nsaying something of the affairs of Erl, turned and walked on toward his\r\ncastle, while Ziroonderel and the boy came back later with Oth.\r\n\r\nAnd Alveric commanded supper when he came to his gateway, and ate it\r\nalone in the great hall that there was in the Castle of Erl, and all the\r\nwhile he was pondering words to say. And then he went in the evening up\r\nto the nursery and told the boy how his mother was gone for a while to\r\nElfland, to her father\'s palace (which may only be told of in song).\r\nAnd, unheeding any words of Orion then, he held on with the brief tale\r\nthat he had come to tell, and told how Elfland was gone.\r\n\r\n"But that cannot be," said Orion, "for I hear the horns of Elfland every\r\nday."\r\n\r\n"You can hear them?" Alveric said.\r\n\r\nAnd the boy replied, "I hear them blowing at evening."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                  _The Quest for the Elfin Mountains_\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter descended on Erl and gripped the forest, holding the small twigs\r\nstiff and still: in the valley it silenced the stream; and in the fields\r\nof the oxen the grass was brittle as earthenware, and the breath of the\r\nbeasts went up like the smoke of encampments. And Orion still went to\r\nthe woods whenever Oth would take him, and sometimes he went with Threl.\r\nWhen he went with Oth the wood was full of the glamour of the beasts\r\nthat Oth hunted, and the splendour of the great stags seemed to haunt\r\nthe gloom of far hollows; but when he went with Threl a mystery haunted\r\nthe wood, so that one could not say what creature might not appear, nor\r\nwhat haunted and hid by every enormous bole. What beasts there were in\r\nthe wood even Threl did not know: many kinds fell to his subtlety, but\r\nwho knew if these were all?\r\n\r\nAnd when the boy was late in the wood, on happy evenings, he would\r\nalways hear as the sun went blazing down, rank on rank of the elfin\r\nhorns blowing far away eastwards in the chill of the coming dusk, very\r\nfar and faint, like reveill\xc3\xa9 heard in dreams. From beyond the woods\r\nthey sounded, all those ringing horns, from beyond the downs, far over\r\nthe furthest curve of them; and he knew them for the silver horns of\r\nElfland. In all other ways he was human, and but for his power to hear\r\nthose horns of Elfland, whose music rings but a yard beyond human\r\nhearing, and his knowledge of what they were; but for these two things\r\nhe was as yet not more than a human child.\r\n\r\nAnd how the horns of Elfland blew over the barrier of twilight, to be\r\nheard by any ear in the fields we know, I cannot understand; yet\r\nTennyson speaks of them as heard "faintly blowing" even in these fields\r\nof ours, and I believe that by accepting all that the poets say while\r\nduly inspired our errors will be fewest. So, though Science may deny or\r\nconfirm it, Tennyson\'s line shall guide me here.\r\n\r\nAlveric in those days went through the village of Erl, with his thoughts\r\nfar from there, moodily; and he stopped at many doors, and spoke and\r\nplanned, with his eyes always fixed as it seemed on things no one else\r\ncould see. He was brooding on far horizons, and the last, over which was\r\nElfland. And from house to house he gathered a little band of men.\r\n\r\nIt was Alveric\'s dream to find the frontier further North, to travel on\r\nover the fields we know, always searching new horizons, till he came to\r\nsome place from which Elfland had not ebbed; to this he determined to\r\ndedicate his days.\r\n\r\nWhen Lirazel was with him amongst the fields we know, his thoughts had\r\never been to make her more earthly; but now that she was gone the\r\nthoughts of his own mind were becoming daily more elvish, and folk began\r\nto look sideways at his fantastic mien. Dreaming always of Elfland and\r\nof elvish things he gathered horses and provender and made for his\r\nlittle band so huge a store of provisions that those who saw it\r\nwondered. Many men he asked to be of that curious band, and few would go\r\nwith him to haunt horizons, when they heard whither he went. And the\r\nfirst that he found to be of that band was a lad that was crossed in\r\nlove; and then a young shepherd, well used to lonely spaces; then one\r\nthat had heard a curious song that someone sang one evening: it had set\r\nhis thoughts roving away to impossible lands, and so he was well content\r\nto follow his fancies. One huge full moon one summer had shone all a\r\nwarm night long on a lad as he lay in the hay, and after that he had\r\nguessed or seen things that he said the moon showed him: whatever they\r\nwere none else saw any such things in Erl: he also joined Alveric\'s band\r\nas soon as he asked him. It was many days before Alveric found these\r\nfour; and more he could not find but a lad that was quite witless, and\r\nhe took him to tend the horses, for he understood horses well, and they\r\nunderstood him, though no human man or woman could make him out at all,\r\nexcept his mother, who wept when Alveric had his promise to go; for she\r\nsaid that he was the prop and support of her age, and knew what storms\r\nwould come and when the swallows would fly, and what colours the flowers\r\nwould come up from seeds she sowed in her garden, and where the spiders\r\nwould build their webs, and the ancient fables of flies: she wept and\r\nsaid that there would be more things lost by his going than ever folk\r\nguessed in Erl. But Alveric took him away: many go thus.\r\n\r\nAnd one morning six horses heaped and hung with provisions all round\r\ntheir saddles waited at Alveric\'s gateway, with the five men that were\r\nto roam with him as far as the world\'s edge. He had taken long counsel\r\nwith Ziroonderel, but she said that no magic of hers had power to charm\r\nElfland or to cross the dread will of its King; he therefore commended\r\nOrion to her care, knowing well that though hers was but simple or\r\nearthly magic, yet no magic likely to cross the fields we know, nor\r\ncurse nor rune directed against his boy, would be able to thwart her\r\nspell; and for himself he trusted to the fortune that waits at the end\r\nof long weary journeys. To Orion he spoke long, not knowing how long\r\nthat journey might be before he again found Elfland, nor how easily he\r\nmight return across the frontier of twilight. He asked the boy what he\r\ndesired of life.\r\n\r\n"To be a hunter," said he.\r\n\r\n"What will you hunt while I am over the hills?" said his father.\r\n\r\n"Stags, like Oth," said Orion.\r\n\r\nAlveric commended that sport, for he himself loved it.\r\n\r\n"And some day I will go a long way over the hills and hunt stranger\r\nthings," said the boy.\r\n\r\n"What kind of things," asked Alveric. But the boy did not know.\r\n\r\nHis father suggested different kinds of beasts.\r\n\r\n"No, stranger than them," said Orion. "Stranger even than bears."\r\n\r\n"But what will they be?" asked his father.\r\n\r\n"Magic things," said the boy.\r\n\r\nBut the horses moved restlessly down below in the cold, so that there\r\nwas no time for more idle talk, and Alveric said farewell to the witch\r\nand his son and strode away thinking little of the future, for all was\r\ntoo vague for thought.\r\n\r\nAlveric mounted his horse over the heaps of provisions, and all the\r\nband of six men rode away. The villagers stood in the street to see them\r\ngo. All knew their curious quest; and when all had saluted Alveric and\r\nall had called their farewells to the last of the riders, a hum of talk\r\narose. And in the talk was contempt of Alveric\'s quest, and pity, and\r\nridicule; and sometimes affection spoke and sometimes scorn; yet in the\r\nhearts of all there was envy; for their reason mocked the lonely roving\r\nof that outlandish adventure, but their hearts would have gone.\r\n\r\nAnd away rode Alveric out of the village of Erl with his company of\r\nadventurers behind him; a moonstruck man, a madman, a lovesick lad, a\r\nshepherd boy and a poet. And Alveric made Vand, the young shepherd, the\r\nmaster of his encampment, for he deemed him to be the sanest amongst his\r\nfollowing; but there were disputes at once as they rode, before they\r\ncame to make any encampment; and Alveric, hearing or feeling the\r\ndiscontent of his men, learned that on such a quest as his it was not\r\nthe sanest but the maddest that should be given authority. So he named\r\nNiv, the witless lad, the master of his encampment; and Niv served him\r\nwell till a day that was far thence, and the moonstruck man stood by\r\nNiv, and all were content to do the bidding of Niv, and all honoured\r\nAlveric\'s quest. And many men in numerous lands do saner things with\r\nless harmony.\r\n\r\nThey came to the uplands and rode over the fields, and rode till they\r\ncame to the furthest hedges of men, and to the houses that they have\r\nbuilt at the verge, beyond which even their thoughts refuse to fare.\r\nThrough this line of houses at the edge of those fields, four or five in\r\nevery mile, Alveric went with his queer company. The leather-worker\'s\r\nhut was far to the South. Now he turned northward to ride past the\r\nbacks of the houses, over fields through which once the barrier of\r\ntwilight had run, till he should find some place where Elfland might\r\nseem not to have ebbed so far. He explained this to his men, and the\r\nleading spirits, Niv, and Zend who was moonstruck, applauded at once;\r\nand Thyl, the young dreamer of songs, said the scheme was a wise one\r\ntoo; and Vand was carried away by the keen zeal of these three; and it\r\nwas all one to Rannok the lover. And they had not gone far along the\r\nbacks of the houses when the red sun touched the horizon, and they\r\nhastened to make an encampment by what remained of the light of that\r\nshort winter\'s day. And Niv said they would build a palace like those of\r\nkings, and the idea fired Zend to work like three men, and Thyl helped\r\neagerly; and they set up stakes and stretched blankets upon them and\r\nmade a wall of brushwood, for they were but just outside the hedgerows,\r\nand Vand helped too with rough hurdles and Rannok toiled on wearily; and\r\nwhen all was finished Niv said that it was a palace. And Alveric went in\r\nand rested, while they lit a fire outside. And Vand cooked a meal for\r\nthem all, which he did every day for himself upon lonely downs; and none\r\ncould have cared for the horses better than Niv.\r\n\r\nAnd as the gloaming faded away the cold of winter grew; and by the time\r\nthat the first star shone there seemed nothing in all the night but\r\nbitter cold, yet Alveric\'s men lay down by their fire in their leathers\r\nand furs and slept, all but Rannok the lover.\r\n\r\nTo Alveric lying on furs in his shelter, watching red embers glowing\r\nbeyond dark shapes of his men, the quest promised well: he would go far\r\nNorth watching every horizon for any sign of Elfland: he would go by the\r\nborder of the fields we know, and always be near provisions: and if he\r\ngot no glimpse of the pale-blue mountains he would go on till he found\r\nsome field from which Elfland had not ebbed, and so come round behind\r\nthem. And Niv and Zend and Thyl had all sworn to him that evening that\r\nbefore many days were gone they would surely all find Elfland. Upon this\r\nthought he slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                     _The Retreat of the Elf King_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Lirazel blew away with the splendid leaves they dropped one by one\r\nfrom their dance in the gleaming air, and ran on over fields for a\r\nwhile, and then gathered by hedgerows and rested; but Earth that pulls\r\nall things down had no hold on her, for the rune of the King of Elfland\r\nhad crossed its borders, calling her home. So she rode carelessly the\r\ngreat north-west wind, looking down idly on the fields we know, as she\r\nswept over them homewards. No grip had Earth on her any longer at all;\r\nfor with her weight (which is where Earth holds us) were gone all her\r\nearthly cares. She saw without grief old fields wherein she and Alveric\r\nwalked once: they drifted by; she saw the houses of men: these also\r\npassed; and deep and dense and heavy with colour, she saw the border of\r\nElfland.\r\n\r\nA last cry Earth called to her with many voices, a child shouting, rooks\r\ncawing, the dull lowing of cows, a slow cart heaving home; then she was\r\ninto the dense barrier of twilight, and all Earth\'s sounds dimmed\r\nsuddenly: she was through it and they ceased. Like a tired horse falling\r\ndead our north-west wind dropped at the frontier; for no winds blow in\r\nElfland that roam over the fields we know. And Lirazel slanted slowly\r\nonward and down, till her feet were back again on the magical soil of\r\nher home. She saw full fair the peaks of the Elfin Mountains, and dark\r\nunderneath them the forest that guarded the Elf King\'s throne. Above\r\nthis forest were glimmering even now great spires in the elfin morning,\r\nwhich glows with more sparkling splendour than do our most dewy dawns,\r\nand never passes away.\r\n\r\nOver the elfin land the elfin lady passed with her light feet, touching\r\nthe grasses as thistledown touches them when it comes down to them and\r\nbrushes their crests while a languid wind rolls it slowly over the\r\nfields we know. And all the elvish and fantastic things, and the curious\r\naspect of the land, and the odd flowers and the haunted trees, and the\r\nominous boding of magic that hung in the air, were all so full of\r\nmemories of her home that she flung her arms about the first gnarled\r\ngnome-like trunk and kissed its wrinkled bark.\r\n\r\nAnd so she came to the enchanted wood; and the sinister pines that\r\nguarded it, with the watchful ivy leaning over their branches, bowed to\r\nLirazel as she passed. Not a wonder in that wood, not a grim hint of\r\nmagic, but brought back the past to her as though it had scarcely gone.\r\nIt was, she felt, but yesterday morning that she had gone away; and it\r\nwas yesterday morning still. As she passed through the wood the gashes\r\nof Alveric\'s sword were yet fresh and white on the trees.\r\n\r\nAnd now a light began to glow through the wood, then flash upon flash of\r\ncolours, and she knew they shone from the glory and splendour of flowers\r\nthat girdled the lawns of her father. To these she came again; and her\r\nfaint footprints that she had made as she left her father\'s palace, and\r\nwondered to see Alveric there, were not yet gone from the bended grass\r\nand the spiders\' webs and the dew. There the great flowers glowed in the\r\nelfin light; while beyond them there twinkled and flashed, with the\r\nportal through which she had left it still open wide to the lawns, the\r\npalace that may not be told of but only in song. Thither Lirazel\r\nreturned. And the Elf King, who heard by magic the tread of her\r\nsoundless feet, was before his door to meet her.\r\n\r\nHis great beard almost hid her as they embraced: he had sorrowed for her\r\nlong through that elfin morning. He had wondered, despite his wisdom; he\r\nhad feared, for all his runes; he had yearned for her as human hearts\r\nmay yearn, for all that he was of magic stock dwelling beyond our\r\nfields. And now she was home again and the elfin morning brightened over\r\nleagues of Elfland with the old Elf King\'s joy, and even a glow was seen\r\nupon slopes of the Elfin Mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd through the flash and glimmer of the vast doorway they passed into\r\nthe palace once more; the knight of the Elf King\'s guard saluted with\r\nhis sword as they went, but dared not turn his head after Lirazel\'s\r\nbeauty; they came again to the hall of the Elf King\'s throne, which is\r\nmade of rainbows and ice; and the great King seated himself and took\r\nLirazel on his knee; and a calm came down upon Elfland.\r\n\r\nAnd for long through the endless elfin morning nothing troubled that\r\ncalm; Lirazel rested after the cares of Earth, the Elf King sat there\r\nkeeping the deep content in his heart, the knight of the guard remained\r\nat the salute, his sword\'s point downwards still, the palace glowed and\r\nshone: it was like a scene in some deep pool beyond the sound of a city,\r\nwith green reeds and gleaming fishes and myriads of tiny shells all\r\nshining in the twilight on deep water, which nothing has disturbed\r\nthrough all the long summer\'s day. And thus they rested beyond the fret\r\nof time, and the hours rested around them, as the little leaping waves\r\nof a cataract rest when the ice calms the stream: the serene blue peaks\r\nof the Elfin Mountains above them stood like unchanging dreams.\r\n\r\nThen like the noise of some city heard amongst birds in woods, like a\r\nsob heard amongst children that are all met to rejoice, like laughter\r\namongst a company that weep, like a shrill wind in orchards amongst the\r\nearly blossom, like a wolf coming over the downs where the sheep are\r\nasleep, there came a feeling into the Elf King\'s mood that one was\r\ncoming towards them across the fields of Earth. It was Alveric with his\r\nsword of thunderbolt-iron, which somehow the old King sensed by its\r\nflavour of magic.\r\n\r\nThen the Elf King rose, and put his left arm about his daughter, and\r\nraised his right to make a mighty enchantment, standing up before his\r\nshining throne which is the very centre of Elfland. And with clear\r\nresonance deep down in his throat he chaunted a rhythmic spell, all made\r\nof words that Lirazel never had heard before, some age-old incantation,\r\ncalling Elfland away, drawing it further from Earth. And the marvellous\r\nflowers heard as their petals drank in the music, and the deep notes\r\nflooded the lawns; and all the palace thrilled, and quivered with\r\nbrighter colours; and a charm went over the plain as far as the frontier\r\nof twilight, and a trembling went through the enchanted wood. Still the\r\nElf King chaunted on. The ringing ominous notes came now to the Elfin\r\nMountains, and all their line of peaks quivered as hills in haze, when\r\nthe heat of summer beats up from the moors and visibly dances in air.\r\nAll Elfland heard, all Elfland obeyed that spell. And now the King and\r\nhis daughter drifted away, as the smoke of the nomads drifts over Sahara\r\naway from their camel\'s-hair tents, as dreams drift away at dawn, as\r\nclouds over the sunset; and like the wind with the smoke, night with the\r\ndreams, warmth with the sunset, all Elfland drifted with them. All\r\nElfland drifted with them and left the desolate plain, the dreary\r\ndeserted region, the unenchanted land. So swiftly that spell was\r\nuttered, so suddenly Elfland obeyed, that many a little song, old\r\nmemory, garden or may tree of remembered years, was swept but a little\r\nway by the drift and heave of Elfland, swaying too slowly eastwards till\r\nthe elfin lawns were gone, and the barrier of twilight heaved over them\r\nand left them among the rocks.\r\n\r\nAnd whither Elfland went I cannot say, nor even whether it followed the\r\ncurve of the Earth or drifted beyond our rocks out into twilight: there\r\nhad been an enchantment near to our fields and now there was none:\r\nwherever it went it was far.\r\n\r\nThen the Elf King ceased to chaunt and all was accomplished. As silently\r\nas, in a moment that none can determine, the long layers over the sunset\r\nturn from gold to pink, or from a glowing pink to a listless unlit\r\ncolour, all Elfland left the edges of those fields by which its wonder\r\nhad lurked for long ages of men, and was away now whither I know not.\r\nAnd the Elf King seated himself again on his throne of mist and ice, in\r\nwhich charmed rainbows were, and took Lirazel his daughter again on his\r\nknee, and the calm that his chaunting had broken came back heavy and\r\ndeep over Elfland. Heavy and deep it fell on the lawns, heavy and deep\r\non the flowers; each dazzling blade of grass was still in its little\r\ncurve as though Nature in a moment of mourning said "Hush" at the\r\nsudden end of the world; and the flowers dreamed on in their beauty,\r\nimmune from Autumn or wind. Far over the moors of the trolls slept the\r\ncalm of the King of Elfland, where the smoke from their queer\r\nhabitations hung stilled in the air; and in a forest wherein it quieted\r\nthe trembling of myriads of petals on roses, it stilled the pools where\r\nthe great lilies towered, till they and their reflections slept on in\r\none gorgeous dream. And there below motionless fronds of dream-gripped\r\ntrees, on the still water dreaming of the still air, where the huge\r\nlily-leaves floated green in the calm, was the troll Lurulu, sitting\r\nupon a leaf. For thus they named in Elfland the troll that had gone to\r\nErl. He sat there gazing into the water at a certain impudent look that\r\nhe had on. He gazed and gazed and gazed.\r\n\r\nNothing stirred, nothing changed. All things were still, reposing in the\r\ndeep content of the King. The Knight of the Guard brought his sword back\r\nto the carry, and afterwards stood as still at his perpetual post as\r\nsome suit of armour whose owner is centuries dead. And still the King\r\nsat silent with his daughter upon his knee, his blue eyes unmoving as\r\nthe pale-blue peaks, which through wide windows shone from the Elfin\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nAnd the Elf King stirred not, nor changed; but held to that moment in\r\nwhich he had found content; and laid its influence over all his\r\ndominions, for the good and welfare of Elfland; for he had what all our\r\ntroubled world with all its changes seeks, and finds so rarely and must\r\nat once cast it away. He had found content and held it.\r\n\r\nAnd in that calm that settled down upon Elfland there passed ten years\r\nover the fields we know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                        _Orion Hunts the Stag_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere passed ten years over the fields we know; and Orion grew and\r\nlearned the art of Oth, and had the cunning of Threl, and knew the woods\r\nand the slopes and vales of the downs, as many another boy knows how to\r\nmultiply figures by other figures or to draw the thoughts from a\r\nlanguage not his own and to set them down again in words of his own\r\ntongue. And little he knew of the things that ink may do, how it can\r\nmark a dead man\'s thought for the wonder of later years, and tell of\r\nhappenings that are gone clean away, and be a voice for us out of the\r\ndark of time, and save many a fragile thing from the pounding of heavy\r\nages; or carry to us, over the rolling centuries, even a song from lips\r\nlong dead on forgotten hills. Little knew he of ink; but the touch of a\r\nroe deer\'s feet on dry ground, gone three hours, was a clear path to\r\nhim, and nothing went through the woods but Orion read its story. And\r\nall the sounds of the wood were as full of clear meaning to him as are\r\nto the mathematician the signs and figures he makes when he divides his\r\nmillions by tens and elevens and twelves. He knew by sun and moon and\r\nwind what birds would enter the wood, he knew of the coming seasons\r\nwhether they would be mild or severe, only a little later than the\r\nbeasts of the wood themselves, which have not human reason or soul and\r\nthat know so much more than we.\r\n\r\nAnd so he grew to know the very mood of the woods, and could enter their\r\nshadowy shelter like one of the woodland beasts. And this he could do\r\nwhen he was barely fourteen years; and many a man lives all his years\r\nand can never enter a wood without changing the whole mood of its\r\nshadowy ways. For men enter a wood perhaps with the wind behind them,\r\nthey brush against branches, step on twigs; speak, smoke, or tread\r\nheavily; and jays cry out against them, pigeons leave the trees, rabbits\r\npad off to safety, and far more beasts than they know slip on soft feet\r\naway from their coming. But Orion moved like Threl, in shoes of\r\ndeer-skin with the tread of a hunter. And none of the beasts of the wood\r\nknew when he was come.\r\n\r\nAnd he came to have a pile of skins like Oth, that he won with his bow\r\nin the wood; and he hung great horns of stags in the hall of the castle,\r\nhigh up among old horns where the spider had lived for ages. And this\r\nwas one of the signs whereby the people of Erl came to know him now for\r\ntheir lord, for no news came of Alveric, and all the old lords of Erl\r\nhad been hunters of deer. And another sign was the departing of the\r\nwitch Ziroonderel when she went back to her hill; and Orion lived in the\r\ncastle now by himself, and she dwelt in her cottage again where her\r\ncabbages grew on the high land near to the thunder.\r\n\r\nAnd all that Winter Orion hunted the stags in the wood, but when Spring\r\ncame he put his bow away. Yet all through the season of song and flowers\r\nhis thoughts were still with the chase; and he went from house to house\r\nwherever a man had one of the long thin dogs that hunt. And sometimes he\r\nbought the dog, and sometimes the man would promise to lend it on days\r\nof hunting. Thus Orion formed a pack of brown long-haired hounds and\r\nyearned for the Spring and Summer to go by. And one Spring evening when\r\nOrion was tending his hounds, when villagers were mostly at their doors\r\nto notice the length of the evening, there came a man up the street whom\r\nnobody knew. He came from the uplands, wrapped in the most aged of\r\nclothes, which clung to him as though they had clung forever, and were\r\nsomehow a part of him and yet part of the Earth, for they were mellowed\r\nby the clay of the high fields to its own deep brown. And folk noticed\r\nthe easy stride of a mighty walker, and a weariness in his eyes: and\r\nnone knew who he was.\r\n\r\nAnd then a woman said "It is Vand that was only a lad." And they all\r\ncrowded about him then, for it was indeed Vand who had left the sheep\r\nmore than ten years ago to ride with Alveric no one in Erl knew whither.\r\n"How fares our master?" they said. And a look of weariness came in the\r\neyes of Vand.\r\n\r\n"He follows the quest," he said.\r\n\r\n"Whither?" they asked.\r\n\r\n"To the North," he said. "He seeks for Elfland still."\r\n\r\n"Why have you left him?" they asked.\r\n\r\n"I lost the hope," he said.\r\n\r\nThey questioned him no more then, for all men knew that to seek for\r\nElfland one needed a strong hope, and without it one saw no gleam of the\r\nElfin Mountains, serene with unchanging blue. And then the mother of Niv\r\ncame running up. "Is it indeed Vand?" she said. And they all said "Yes,\r\nit is Vand."\r\n\r\nAnd while they murmured together about Vand, and of how years and\r\nwandering had changed him, she said to him, "Tell me of my son." And\r\nVand replied "He leads the quest. There is none whom my master trusts\r\nmore." And they all wondered, and yet they had no cause for wonder, for\r\nit was a mad quest.\r\n\r\nBut Niv\'s mother alone did not wonder. "I knew he would," she said. "I\r\nknew he would." And she was filled with a great content.\r\n\r\nThere are events and seasons to suit the mood of every man, though few\r\nindeed could have suited the crazed mood of Niv, yet there came\r\nAlveric\'s quest of Elfland, and so Niv found his work.\r\n\r\nAnd talking in the late evening with Vand the folk of Erl heard tales of\r\nmany camps, many marches, a tale of profitless wandering where Alveric\r\nhaunted horizons year after year like a ghost. And sometimes out of\r\nVand\'s sadness that had come from those profitless years a smile would\r\nshine as he told of some foolish happening that had taken place in the\r\ncamp. But all was told by one that had lost hope in the quest. This was\r\nnot the way to tell of it, not with doubts, not with smiles. For such a\r\nquest may only be told of by those who are fired by its glory: from the\r\nmad brain of Niv or the moonstruck wits of Zend we might have news of\r\nthat quest which could light our minds with some gleam of its meaning;\r\nbut never from the story, be it made out of facts or scoffs, told by one\r\nwhom the quest itself was able to lure no longer. The stars stole out\r\nand still Vand was telling his stories, and one by one the people went\r\nback to their houses, caring to hear no more of the hopeless quest. Had\r\nthe tale been told by one who clung yet to the faith that still was\r\nleading Alveric\'s wanderers on, the stars would have weakened before\r\nthose folk left the teller, the sky would have brightened so widely\r\nbefore they left him that one would have said at last "Why! It is\r\nmorning." Not till then would they have gone.\r\n\r\nAnd the next day Vand went back to the downs and the sheep and troubled\r\nhimself with romantic quests no more.\r\n\r\nAnd during that Spring men spoke of Alveric again, wondering awhile at\r\nhis quest, speaking awhile of Lirazel, and guessing where she had gone,\r\nand guessing why; and where they could not guess telling some tale to\r\nexplain all, which went from mouth to mouth till they came to believe\r\nit. And Spring went by and they forgot Alveric and obeyed the will of\r\nOrion.\r\n\r\nAnd then one day as Orion was waiting for the Summer to go by, with his\r\nheart on frosty days and his dreams with his hounds on the uplands,\r\nRannok the lover came over the downs by the path by which Vand had come,\r\nand walked down into Erl. Rannok with his heart free at last, with all\r\nhis melancholy gone, Rannok without woe, careless, care-free, content,\r\nlooking only for rest after his long wandering, sighing no more. And\r\nnothing but this would have made Vyria care to have him, the girl he had\r\nsought once. So the end of this was that she married him, and he too\r\nwent roaming no more on fantastic quests.\r\n\r\nAnd though some looked to the uplands through many an evening, till the\r\nlong days wore away and a strange wind touched the leaves, and some\r\npeered over the further curves of the downs, yet they saw none more of\r\nthe followers of Alveric\'s quest coming back by the path that Vand and\r\nRannok had trod. And by the time that the leaves were a wonder of\r\nscarlet and gold men spoke no more of Alveric but obeyed Orion his son.\r\n\r\nAnd in this season Orion arose one day before dawn and took his horn and\r\nhis bow and went to his hounds, who wondered to hear his step before\r\nlight was come: they heard it all in their sleep and awoke and clamoured\r\nto him. And he loosed them and calmed them and led them away to the\r\ndowns. And to the lonely magnificence of the downs they came when the\r\nstags are feeding on dewy grasses, before men are awake. All in the wild\r\nwet morning they ran over the gleaming slopes, Orion and his hounds, all\r\nrejoicing together. And the scent of the thyme came heavy with the air\r\nthat Orion breathed, as he trod its wide patches blooming late in the\r\nyear. To the hounds there came all the wandering scents of the morning.\r\nAnd what wild creatures had met on the hill in the dark and what had\r\ncrossed it going upon their journeys, and whither all had gone when the\r\nday grew bright, bringing the threat of man, Orion guessed and wondered;\r\nbut to the hounds all was clear. And some of the scents they noted with\r\ncareful noses, and some they scorned, and for one they sought in vain,\r\nfor the great red deer were not on the downs that morning.\r\n\r\nAnd Orion led them far from the Vale of Erl but saw no stag that day,\r\nand never a wind brought the scent that the anxious hounds were seeking,\r\nnor could they find it hidden in any grass or leaves. And evening came\r\non him bringing his hounds home, calling on stragglers with his horn,\r\nwhile the sun turned huge and scarlet; and fainter than echoes of his\r\nhorn, and far beyond downs and mist, but clear each silver note, he\r\nheard the elfin horns that called to him always at evening.\r\n\r\nWith the great comradeship of a common weariness he and his hounds came\r\nhome dark in the starlight. The windows of Erl at last flashed to them\r\nthe glow of their welcome. Hounds came to their kennels and ate, and\r\nlay down to contented sleep: Orion went to his castle. He too ate, and\r\nafterwards sat thinking of the downs and his hounds and the day, his\r\nmind lulled by fatigue to that point at which it rests beyond care.\r\n\r\nAnd many a day passed thus. And then one dewy morning, coming over a\r\nridge of the downs, they saw a stag below them feeding late when all the\r\nrest were gone. The hounds all broke into one joyous cry, the heavy stag\r\nmoved nimbly over the grass, Orion shot an arrow and missed; all these\r\nthings happened in a moment. And then the hounds streamed away, and the\r\nwind went over the backs of them with a ripple, and the stag went away\r\nas though every one of his feet were on little dancing springs. And at\r\nfirst the hounds were swifter than Orion, but he was as tireless as\r\nthey, and by taking sometimes shorter ways than theirs he stayed near\r\nthem till they came to a stream and faltered and began to need the help\r\nof human reason. And such help as human reason can give in such a matter\r\nOrion gave them, and soon they were on again. And the morning passed as\r\nthey went from hill to hill, and they had not seen the stag a second\r\ntime; and the afternoon wore away, and still the hounds followed every\r\nstep of the stag with a skill as strange as magic. And towards evening\r\nOrion saw him, going slowly, along the slope of a hill, over coarse\r\ngrass that was shining in the rays of the low sun. He cheered on his\r\nhounds and they ran him over three more small valleys, but down at the\r\nbottom of the third he turned round amongst the pebbles of a stream and\r\nwaited there for the hounds. And they came baying round him, watching\r\nhis brow antlers. And there they tore him down and killed him at sunset.\r\nAnd Orion wound his horn with a great joy in his heart: he wanted no\r\nmore than this. And with a note like that of joy, as though they also\r\nrejoiced, or mocked his rejoicing, over hills that he knew not, perhaps\r\nfrom the far side of the sunset, the horns of Elfland answered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                 _The Unicorn Comes in the Starlight_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd winter came, and whitened the roofs of Erl, and all the forest and\r\nuplands. And when Orion took his hounds afield in the morning the world\r\nlay like a book that was newly written by Life; for all the story of the\r\nnight before lay in long lines in the snow. Here the fox had gone and\r\nthere the badger, and here the red deer had gone out of the wood; the\r\ntracks led over the downs and disappeared from sight, as the deeds of\r\nstatesmen, soldiers, courtiers and politicians appear and disappear on\r\nthe pages of history. Even the birds had their record on those white\r\ndowns, where the eye could follow each step of their treble claws, till\r\nsuddenly on each side of the track would appear three little scars where\r\nthe tips of their longest feathers had flicked the snow, and there the\r\ntrack faded utterly. They were like some popular cry, some vehement\r\nfancy, that comes down on a page of history for a day, and passes,\r\nleaving no other record at all except those lines on one page.\r\n\r\nAnd amongst all these records left of the story of night Orion would\r\nchoose the track of some great stag not too long gone, and would follow\r\nit with his hounds away over the downs until even the sound of his horn\r\ncould be heard no longer in Erl. And over a ridge with his hounds, he\r\nand they all black against red remnants of sunset, the folk of Erl would\r\nsee him coming home; and often it was not until all the stars were\r\nglowing through the frost. Often the skin of a red deer hung over his\r\nshoulders and the huge horns bobbed and nodded above his head.\r\n\r\nAnd at this time there met one day in the forge of Narl, all unknown to\r\nOrion, the men of the parliament of Erl. They met after sunset when all\r\nwere home from their work. And gravely Narl handed to each the mead that\r\nwas brewed from the clover honey; and when all were come they sat\r\nsilent. And then Narl broke the silence, saying that Alveric ruled over\r\nErl no more and his son was Lord of Erl, and telling again how once they\r\nhad hoped for a magic lord to rule over the valley and to make it\r\nfamous, and saying that this should be he. "And where now," he said, "is\r\nthe magic for which we hoped? For he hunts the deer as all his\r\nforefathers hunted, and nothing of magic has touched him from over\r\nthere; and there is no new thing."\r\n\r\nAnd Oth stood up to defend him. "He is as fleet as his hounds," he said,\r\n"and hunts from dawn to sunset, and crosses the furthest downs and comes\r\nhome untired."\r\n\r\n"It is but youth," said Guhic. And so said all but Threl.\r\n\r\nAnd Threl stood up and said: "He has a knowledge of the ways of the\r\nwoods, and the lore of the beasts, beyond the learning of man."\r\n\r\n"You taught him," said Guhic. "There is no magic here."\r\n\r\n"Nothing of this," said Narl, "is from over there."\r\n\r\nThus they argued awhile lamenting the loss of the magic for which they\r\nhad hoped: for never a valley but history touches it once, never a\r\nvillage but once its name is awhile on the lips of men; only the village\r\nof Erl was utterly unrecorded; never a century knew it beyond the round\r\nof its downs. And now all their plans seemed lost which they made so\r\nlong ago, and they saw no hope except in the mead that was brewed from\r\nthe clover honey. To this they turned in silence. Now it was a goodly\r\nbrew.\r\n\r\nAnd in a while new plans flashed clear in their minds, new schemes, new\r\ndevices; and debates in the parliament of Erl flowed proudly on. And\r\nthey would have made a plan and a policy; but Oth arose from his seat.\r\nThere was in a flint-built house in the village of Erl an ancient\r\nChronicle, a volume bound in leather, and in it at certain seasons folk\r\nwrote all manner of things, the wisdom of farmers concerning the time to\r\nsow, the wisdom of hunters concerning the tracking of stags, and the\r\nwisdom of prophets that told of the way of Earth. From this Oth quoted\r\nnow, two lines that he remembered on one of the aged pages; and all the\r\nrest of that page told of hoeing; these lines he said to the parliament\r\nof Erl as they sat with the mead before them at their table:\r\n\r\n    "Hooded, and veiled with their night-like tresses,\r\n    The Fates shall bring what no prophet guesses."\r\n\r\nAnd then they planned no more, for either their minds were calmed by a\r\ncertain awe that they seemed to find in the lines, or it may be the mead\r\nwas stronger than anything written in books. However it be they sat\r\nsilent over their mead. And in early starlight while the West still\r\nglowed they passed away from Narl\'s house back to their own homes\r\ngrumbling as they went that they had no magic lord to rule over Erl, and\r\nyearning for magic, to save from oblivion the village and valley they\r\nloved. They parted one by one as they came to their houses. And three or\r\nfour that dwelt near the end of the village on the side that was under\r\nthe downs were not yet come to their doors, when, white and clear in the\r\nstarlight and what remained of the gloaming, they saw hard-pressed and\r\nwearied a hunted unicorn coming across the downs. They stopped and gazed\r\nand shaded their eyes and stroked their beards and wondered. And still\r\nit was a white unicorn galloping wearily. And then they heard drawing\r\nnearer the cry of Orion\'s hounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                    _The Grey Tent in the Evening_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day that the hunted unicorn crossed the valley of Erl Alveric had\r\nwandered for over eleven years. For more than ten years, a company of\r\nsix, they went by the backs of the houses by the edge of the fields we\r\nknow, and camped at evenings with their queer material hung greyly on\r\npoles. And whether or not the strange romance of their quest mirrored\r\nitself in all the things about them, those camps of theirs seemed always\r\nthe strangest thing in the landscape; and as evening grew greyer around\r\nthem their romance and mystery grew.\r\n\r\nAnd for all the vehemence of Alveric\'s ambition they travelled leisurely\r\nand lazily: sometimes in a pleasant camp they stayed for three days;\r\nthen they went strolling on. Nine or ten miles they would march and then\r\nthey would camp again. Someday, Alveric felt sure in his heart, they\r\nwould see that border of twilight, someday they would enter Elfland. And\r\nin Elfland he knew that time was not as here: he would meet Lirazel\r\nunaged in Elfland, with never one smile lost to the raging years, never\r\na furrow worn by the ruin of time. This was his hope; and it led his\r\nqueer company on from camp to camp, and cheered them round the fire in\r\nthe lonely evenings, and brought them far to the North, travelling all\r\nalong the edge of the fields we know, where all men\'s faces turned the\r\nother way, and the six wanderers went unseen and unheeded. Only the mind\r\nof Vand hung back from their hope, and more and more every year his\r\nreason denied the lure that was leading the rest. And then one day he\r\nlost his faith in Elfland. After that he only followed until a day when\r\nthe wind was full of rain, and all were cold and wet and the horses\r\nweary; he left them then.\r\n\r\nAnd Rannok followed because he had no hope in his heart and wished to\r\nwander from sorrow; until one day when all the blackbirds were singing\r\nin trees of the fields we know, and his hopelessness left him in the\r\nglittering sunshine, and he thought of the cosy homes and the haunts of\r\nmen. And soon he too passed out of the camp one evening and set off for\r\nthe pleasant lands.\r\n\r\nAnd now the four that were left were all of one mind, and under the wet\r\ncoarse cloth that they hung on poles there was deep content in the\r\nevenings. For Alveric clung to his hope with all the strength of his\r\nrace, that had once won Erl in old battles and held it for centuries\r\nlong, and in the vacant minds of Niv and Zend this idea grew strong and\r\nbig, like some rare flower that a gardener may plant by chance in a wild\r\nuntended place. And Thyl sung of the hope; and all his wild fancies that\r\nroamed after song decked Alveric\'s quest with more and more of glamour.\r\nSo all were of one mind. And greater quests whether mad or sane have\r\nprospered when this was so, and greater quests have failed when it was\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nThey had gone northwards for years along the backs of those houses; and\r\nthen one day they would turn eastwards, wherever a certain look in the\r\nsky or a touch of weirdness at evening, or a mere prophecy of Niv\'s,\r\nseemed to suggest a proximity of Elfland. Upon such occasions they would\r\ntravel over the rocks, that for all those years lay bordering the fields\r\nwe know, until Alveric saw that provisions for men and horses would\r\nbarely bring them back to the houses of men. Then he would turn again,\r\nbut Niv would have led them still onward over the rocks, for his\r\nenthusiasm grew as they went; and Thyl sang to them prophesying success;\r\nand Zend would say that he saw the peaks and the spires of Elfland; only\r\nAlveric was wise. And so they would come to the houses of men again, and\r\nbuy more provisions. And Niv and Zend and Thyl would babble of the\r\nquest, pouring out the enthusiasm that burned in their hearts; but\r\nAlveric did not speak of it, for he had learned that men in those fields\r\nneither speak of nor look towards Elfland, although he had not learned\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\nSoon they were on again, and the folk that had sold them the produce of\r\nfields we know gazed curiously after them as they went, as though they\r\nthought that from madness alone or from dreams inspired by the moon came\r\nall the talk they had heard from Niv and Zend and Thyl.\r\n\r\nThus they always travelled on, always seeking new points from which to\r\ndiscover Elfland; and on the left of them blew scents from the fields we\r\nknow, the scent of lilac from cottage gardens in May, and then the scent\r\nof the white-thorn and then of roses, till all the air was heavy with\r\nnew-mown hay. They heard the low of cattle away on their left, heard\r\nhuman voices, heard partridges calling; heard all the sounds that go up\r\nfrom happy farms; and on their right was always the desolate land,\r\nalways the rocks and never grass nor a flower. They had the\r\ncompanionship of men no more, and yet they could not find Elfland. In\r\nsuch a case they needed the songs of Thyl and the sure hope of Niv.\r\n\r\nAnd the talk of Alveric\'s quest spread through the land and overtook his\r\nwanderings, till all men that he passed by knew his story; and from some\r\nhe had the contempt that some men give to those who dedicate all their\r\ndays to a quest, and from others he had honour; but all he asked for was\r\nprovender, and this he bought when they brought it. So they went on.\r\nLike legendary things they passed along the backs of the houses, putting\r\nup their grey shapeless tent in the grey evenings. They came as quietly\r\nas rain, and went away like mists drifting. There were jests about them\r\nand songs. And the songs outlasted the jests. At last they became a\r\nlegend, which haunted those farms for ever: they were spoken of when men\r\ntold of hopeless quests, and held up to laughter or glory, whichever men\r\nhad to give.\r\n\r\nAnd all the while the King of Elfland watched; for he knew by magic when\r\nAlveric\'s sword drew near: it had troubled his kingdom once, and the\r\nKing of Elfland knew well the flavour of thunderbolt iron when he felt\r\nit loom on the air. From this he had withdrawn his frontiers far,\r\nleaving all that ragged land deserted of Elfland; and though he knew not\r\nthe length of human journeys, he had left a space that to cross would\r\nweary the comet, and rightly deemed himself safe.\r\n\r\nBut when Alveric with his sword was far to the North the Elf King\r\nloosened the grip with which he had withdrawn Elfland, as the Moon that\r\nwithdraws the tide lets it flow back again, and Elfland came racing back\r\nas the tide over flat sands. With a long ribbon of twilight at its edge\r\nit floated back over the waste of rocks; with old songs it came, with\r\nold dreams, and with old voices. And in a while the frontier of\r\ntwilight lay flashing and glimmering near the fields we know, like an\r\nendless Summer evening that lingered on out of the golden age. But bleak\r\nand far to the North where Alveric wandered the limitless rocks still\r\nheaped the desolate land; only to fields from which he and his sword and\r\nhis adventurous band were remotely gone that mighty inlet of Elfland\r\ncame lapping back. So that close again to the leather-worker\'s cottage\r\nand to the farms of his neighbours, a bare three fields away, lay the\r\nland that was heaped and piled with all the wonder for which poets seek\r\nso hard, the very treasury of all romantic things; and the Elfin\r\nMountains gazed over the border serenely, as though their pale-blue\r\npeaks had never moved. And here the unicorns fed along the border as it\r\nwas their custom to do, feeding sometimes in Elfland, which is the home\r\nof all fabulous things, cropping lilies below the slopes of the Elfin\r\nMountains, and sometimes slipping through the border of twilight at\r\nevening when all our fields are still, to feed upon earthly grass. It is\r\nbecause of this craving for earthly grass that comes on them now and\r\nthen, as the red deer in Highland mountains crave once a year for the\r\nsea, that, fabulous though they are on account of their birth in\r\nElfland, their existence is nevertheless known among men. The fox, which\r\nis born in our fields, also crosses the frontier, going into the border\r\nof twilight at certain seasons; it is thence that he gets the romance\r\nwith which he comes back to our fields. He also is fabulous, but only in\r\nElfland, as the unicorns are fabulous here.\r\n\r\nAnd seldom the folk on those farms saw the unicorns, even dim in the\r\ngloaming, for their faces were turned forever away from Elfland. The\r\nwonder, the beauty, the glamour, the story of Elfland were for minds\r\nthat had leisure to care for such things as these; but the crops needed\r\nthese men, and the beasts that were not fabulous, and the thatch, and\r\nthe hedges and a thousand things: barely at the end of each year they\r\nwon their fight against Winter: they knew well that if they let a\r\nthought of theirs turn but for a moment towards Elfland, its glory would\r\ngrip them soon and take all their leisure away, and there would be no\r\ntime left to mend thatch or hedge or to plough the fields we know. But\r\nOrion lured by the sound of the horns that blew from Elfland at evening,\r\nand that some elvish attuning of his ears to magical things caused him\r\nalone in all those fields to hear, came with his hounds to a field\r\nacross which ran the frontier of twilight, and found the unicorns there\r\nlate on an evening. And, slipping along a hedge of the little field with\r\nhis hounds padding behind him, he came between a unicorn and the\r\nfrontier and cut it off from Elfland. This was the unicorn that with\r\nflashing neck, covered with flecks of foam that shone silvery in the\r\nstarlight, panting, harried and weary, came across the valley of Erl,\r\nlike an inspiration, like a new dynasty to a custom-weary land, like\r\nnews of a happier continent found far-off by suddenly returned\r\nsea-faring men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                    _Twelve Old Men Without Magic_\r\n\r\n\r\nNow few things pass by a village and leave no talk behind them. Nor did\r\nthis unicorn. For the three that saw it going by in the starlight\r\nimmediately told their families, and many of these ran from their houses\r\nto tell the good news to others, for all strange news was accounted good\r\nin Erl, because of the talk that it made; and talk was held to be\r\nneedful when work was over to pass the evenings away. So they talked\r\nlong of the unicorn.\r\n\r\nAnd, after a day or two, in the forge of Narl the parliament of Erl was\r\nmet again, seated by mugs of mead, discussing the unicorn. And some\r\nrejoiced and said that Orion was magic, because unicorns were of magic\r\nstock and came from beyond our fields.\r\n\r\n"Therefore," said one, "he has been to lands of which it does not become\r\nus to speak, and is magic, as all things are which dwell over there."\r\n\r\nAnd some agreed and held that their plans had come to fruition.\r\n\r\nBut others said that the beast went by in the starlight, if beast it\r\nwere, and who could say it was a unicorn? And one said that in the\r\nstarlight it was hard to see it at all, and another said unicorns were\r\nhard to recognize. And then they began to discuss the size and shape of\r\nthese beasts, and all the known legends that told of them, and came no\r\nnearer to agreeing together whether or not their lord had hunted a\r\nunicorn. Till at last Narl seeing that they would not thus come by the\r\ntruth, and deeming it necessary that the fact should be established one\r\nway or the other forever, rose up and told them that the time had come\r\nfor the vote. So by a method they had of casting shells of various\r\ncolours into a horn that was passed from man to man, they voted about\r\nthe unicorn as Narl had commanded. And a hush fell, and Narl counted.\r\nAnd it was seen to have been established by vote that there had been no\r\nunicorn.\r\n\r\nSorrowfully then that parliament of Erl saw that their plans to have a\r\nmagic lord had failed; they were all old men, and the hope that they had\r\nhad for so long being gone they turned less easily to newer plans than\r\nthey had to the plan that they made so long ago. What should they do\r\nnow, they said? How come by magic? What could they do that the world\r\nshould remember Erl? Twelve old men without magic. They sat there over\r\ntheir mead, and it could not lighten their sadness.\r\n\r\nBut Orion was away with his hounds near that great inlet of Elfland\r\nwhere it lay as it were at high tide, touching the very grass of the\r\nfields we know. He went there at evening when the horns blew clear to\r\nguide him, and waited there all quiet at the edge of those fields for\r\nthe unicorns to steal across the border. For he hunted stags no more.\r\n\r\nAnd as he went over those fields in the late afternoon folk working on\r\nthe farms would greet him cheerily; but when still he went eastwards\r\nthey spoke to him less and less, till at last when he neared the border\r\nand still kept on they looked his way no more, but left him and his\r\nhounds to their own devices.\r\n\r\nAnd by the time the sun set he would be standing quiet by a hedge that\r\nran right down into the frontier of twilight, with his hounds all\r\ngathered close in under the hedge, with his eye on them all lest one of\r\nthem dared to move. And the pigeons would come home to trees of the\r\nfields we know, and twittering starlings; and the elfin horns would\r\nblow, clear silver magical music thrilling the chilled air, and all the\r\ncolours of clouds would go suddenly changing; it was then in the failing\r\nlight, in the darkening of colours, that Orion would watch for a dim\r\nwhite shape stepping out of the border of twilight. And this evening\r\njust as he hushed a hound with his hand, just as all our fields went\r\ndim, there slipped a great white unicorn out of the border, still\r\nmunching lilies such as never grew in any fields of ours. He came, a\r\nwhiteness on perfectly silent feet, four or five yards into the fields\r\nwe know, and stood there still as moonlight, and listened and listened\r\nand listened. Orion never moved, and he kept his hounds silent by some\r\npower he had or by some wisdom of theirs. And in five minutes the\r\nunicorn made a step or two forward, and began to crop the long sweet\r\nearthly grasses. And as soon as he moved there came others through the\r\ndeep blue border of twilight, and all at once there were five of them\r\nfeeding there. And still Orion stood with his hounds and waited.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the unicorns moved further away from the border, lured\r\nfurther and further into the fields we know by the deep rich earthly\r\ngrasses, on which all five of them browsed in the silent evening. If a\r\ndog barked, even if a late cock crew, up went all their ears at once\r\nand they stood watchful, not trusting anything in the fields of men, or\r\nventuring into them far.\r\n\r\nBut at last the one that had come first through the twilight got so far\r\nfrom his magical home that Orion was able to run between him and the\r\nfrontier, and his hounds came behind him. And then had Orion been toying\r\nwith the chase, then had he hunted but for an idle whim, and not for\r\nthat deep love of the huntsman\'s craft that only huntsmen know, then had\r\nhe lost everything: for his hounds would have chased the nearest\r\nunicorns, and they would have been in a moment across the frontier and\r\nlost, and if the hounds had followed they would have been lost too, and\r\nall that day\'s work would have gone for nothing. But Orion led his\r\nhounds to chase the furthest, watching all the while to see if any hound\r\nwould try to pursue the others; and only one began to, but Orion\'s whip\r\nwas ready. And so he cut his quarry off from its home, and his hounds\r\nfor the second time were in full cry after a unicorn.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the unicorn heard the feet of the hounds, and saw with one\r\nflash of his eye that he could not get to his enchanted home, he shot\r\nforward with a sudden spring of his limbs and went like an arrow over\r\nthe fields we know. When he came to hedges he did not seem to gather his\r\nlimbs to leap but seemed to glide over them with motionless muscles,\r\ngalloping again when he touched the grass once more.\r\n\r\nIn that first rush the hounds drew far ahead of Orion, and this enabled\r\nhim to head the unicorn off whenever it tried to turn to the magical\r\nland; and at such turnings he came near his hounds again. And the third\r\ntime that Orion turned the unicorn it galloped straight away, and so\r\ncontinued over the fields of men. The cry of the hounds went through the\r\ncalm of the evening like a long ripple across a sleeping lake following\r\nthe unseen way of some strange diver. In that straight gallop the\r\nunicorn gained so much on the hounds that soon Orion only saw him far\r\noff, a white spot moving along a slope in the gloaming. Then it reached\r\nthe top of a valley and passed from view. But that strong queer scent\r\nthat led the hounds like a song remained clear on the grass, and they\r\nnever checked or faltered except for a moment at streams. Even there\r\ntheir ranging noses picked up the magical scent before Orion came up to\r\ngive them his aid.\r\n\r\nAnd as the hunt went on the daylight faded away, till the sky was all\r\nprepared for the coming of stars. And one or two stars appeared, and a\r\nmist came up from streams and spread all white over fields, till they\r\ncould not have seen the unicorn if he had been close before them. The\r\nvery trees seemed sleeping. They passed by little houses, lonely,\r\nsheltered by elms; shut off by high hedges of yew from those that roamed\r\nthe fields; houses that Orion had never seen or known till the chance\r\ncourse of this unicorn brought him suddenly past their doors. Dogs\r\nbarked as they passed, and continued barking long, for that magical\r\nscent on the air and the rush and the voice of the pack told them\r\nsomething strange was afoot; and at first they barked because they would\r\nhave shared in what was afoot, and afterwards to warn their masters\r\nabout the strangeness. They barked long through the evening.\r\n\r\nAnd once, as they passed a little house in a cluster of old thorns, a\r\ndoor suddenly opened, and a woman stood gazing to see them go by: she\r\ncould have seen no more than grey shapes, but Orion in the moment as he\r\npassed saw all the glow of the house, and the yellow light streaming out\r\ninto the cold. The merry warmth cheered him, and he would have rested\r\nawhile in that little oasis of man in the lonely fields, but the hounds\r\nwent on and he followed; and those in the houses heard their cry go past\r\nlike the sound of a trumpet whose echoes go fading away amongst the\r\nfurthest hills.\r\n\r\nA fox heard them coming, and stood quite still and listened: at first he\r\nwas puzzled. Then he caught the scent of the unicorn, and all was clear\r\nto him, for he knew by the magic flavour that it was something coming\r\nfrom Elfland.\r\n\r\nBut when sheep caught the scent they were terrified, and ran all huddled\r\ntogether until they could run no more.\r\n\r\nCattle leaped up from their sleep, gazed dreamily, and wondered; but the\r\nunicorn went through them and away, as some rose-scented breeze that has\r\nstrayed from valley gardens into the streets of a city slips through the\r\nnoisy traffic and is gone.\r\n\r\nSoon all the stars were looking on those quiet fields through which the\r\nhunt went with its exultation, a line of vehement life cleaving through\r\nsleep and silence. And now the unicorn, far out of sight though he was,\r\nno longer gained a little at every hedge. For at first he lost no more\r\npace at any hedge than a bird loses passing clear of a cloud, while the\r\ngreat hounds struggled through what gaps they could find, or lay on\r\ntheir sides and wriggled between the stems of the bushes. But now he\r\ngathered his strength with more effort at every hedge, and sometimes hit\r\nthe top of the hedge and stumbled. He was galloping slower too; for this\r\nwas a journey such as no unicorn made through the deep calm of Elfland.\r\nAnd something told the tired hounds they were drawing nearer. And a new\r\njoy entered their voices.\r\n\r\nThey crossed a few more black hedges, and then there loomed before them\r\nthe dark of a wood. When the unicorn entered the wood the voices of the\r\nhounds were clear in his ears. A pair of foxes saw him going slowly, and\r\nthey ran along beside him to see what would befall the magic creature\r\ncoming weary to them from Elfland. One on each side they ran, keeping\r\nhis slow pace and watching him, and they had no fear of the hounds\r\nthough they heard their cry, for they knew that nothing that followed\r\nthat magical scent would turn aside after any earthly thing. So he went\r\nlabouring through the wood, and the foxes watched him curiously all the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe hounds entered the wood and the great oaks rang with the sound of\r\nthem, and Orion followed with an enduring speed that he may have got\r\nfrom our fields or that may have come to him over the border from\r\nElfland. The dark of the wood was intense but he followed his hounds\'\r\ncry, and they did not need to see with that wonderful scent to guide\r\nthem. They never wavered as they followed that scent, but went on\r\nthrough gloaming and starlight. It was not like any hunt of fox or stag;\r\nfor another fox will cross the line of a fox, or a stag may pass through\r\na herd of stags and hinds; even a flock of sheep will bewilder hounds by\r\ncrossing the line they follow; but this unicorn was the only magical\r\nthing in all our fields that night, and his scent lay unmistakable over\r\nthe earthly grass, a burning pungent flavour of enchantment among the\r\nthings of every day. They hunted him clear through the wood and down to\r\na valley, the two foxes keeping with him and watching still: he picked\r\nhis feet carefully as he went down the hill, as though his weight hurt\r\nthem while he descended the slope, yet his pace was as fast as that of\r\nthe hounds going down: then he went a little way along the trough of the\r\nvalley, turning to his left as soon as he came down the hill, but the\r\nhounds gained on him then and he turned for the opposite slope. And then\r\nhis weariness could be concealed no longer, the thing that all wild\r\ncreatures conceal to the last; he toiled over every step as though his\r\nlegs dragged his body heavily. Orion saw him from the opposite slope.\r\n\r\nAnd when the unicorn got to the top the hounds were close behind him, so\r\nthat he suddenly whipped round his great single horn and stood before\r\nthem threatening. Then the hounds bayed about him, but the horn waved\r\nand bowed with such swift grace that no hound got a grip; they knew\r\ndeath when they saw it, and eager though they were to fasten upon him\r\nthey leaped back from that flashing horn. Then Orion came up with his\r\nbow, but he would not shoot, perhaps because it was hard to put an arrow\r\nsafely past his pack of hounds, perhaps because of a feeling such as we\r\nhave to-day, and which is no new thing among us, that it was unfair to\r\nthe unicorn. Instead he drew an old sword that he was wearing, and\r\nadvanced through his hounds and engaged that deadly horn. And the\r\nunicorn arched his neck, and the horn flashed at Orion; and, weary\r\nthough the unicorn was, yet a mighty force remained in that muscular\r\nneck to drive the blow that he aimed, and Orion barely parried. He\r\nthrust at the unicorn\'s throat, but the great horn tossed the sword\r\naside from its aim and again lunged at Orion. Again he parried with the\r\nwhole weight of his arm, and had but an inch to spare. He thrust again\r\nat the throat, and the unicorn parried the sword-thrust almost\r\ncontemptuously. Again and again the unicorn aimed fair at Orion\'s heart;\r\nthe huge white beast stepped forward pressing Orion back. That graceful\r\nbowing neck, with its white arch of hard muscle driving the deadly horn,\r\nwas wearying Orion\'s arm. Once more he thrust and failed; he saw the\r\nunicorn\'s eye flash wickedly in the starlight, he saw all white before\r\nhim the fearful arch of its neck, he knew he could turn aside its heavy\r\nblows no more; and then a hound got a grip in front of the right\r\nshoulder. No moments passed before many another hound leaped on to the\r\nunicorn, each with a chosen grip, for all that they looked like a rabble\r\nrolling and heaving by chance. Orion thrust no more, for many hounds all\r\nat once were between him and his enemy\'s throat. Awful groans came from\r\nthe unicorn, such sounds as are not heard in the fields we know; and\r\nthen there was no sound but the deep growl of the hounds that roared\r\nover the wonderful carcase as they wallowed in fabulous blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n                          _A Historical Fact_\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the weary hounds refreshed with fury and triumph, Orion stepped\r\nwith his whip and drove them away from the monstrous dead body, and sent\r\nthe lash quivering round in a wide circle, while in his other hand he\r\ntook his sword and cut off the unicorn\'s head. He also took the skin of\r\nthe long white neck and brought it away dangling empty from the head.\r\nAll the while the hounds bayed and made eager rushes one by one at that\r\nmagical carcase whenever one saw a chance of eluding the whip; so that\r\nit was long before Orion got his trophy, for he had to work as hard with\r\nhis whip as with his sword. But at last he had it slung by a leather\r\nthong over his shoulders, the great horn pointing upwards past the right\r\nside of his head, and the smeared skin hanging down along his back. And\r\nwhile he arranged it thus he allowed his hounds to worry the body again\r\nand taste that wonderful blood. Then he called to them and blew a note\r\non his horn and turned slowly home towards Erl, and they all followed\r\nbehind him. And the two foxes stole up to taste the curious blood, for\r\nthey had sat and waited for this.\r\n\r\nWhile the unicorn was climbing his last hill Orion felt such fatigue\r\nthat he could have gone little further, but now that the heavy head hung\r\nfrom his shoulders all his fatigue was gone and he trod with a lightness\r\nsuch as he had in the mornings, for it was his first unicorn. And his\r\nhounds seemed refreshed as though the blood they had lapped had some\r\nstrange power in it, and they came home riotously, gambolling and\r\nrushing ahead as when newly loosed from their kennels.\r\n\r\nThus Orion came home over the downs in the night, till he saw the valley\r\nbefore him full of the smoke of Erl, where one late light was burning in\r\na window of one of his towers. And, coming down the slopes by familiar\r\nways, he brought his hounds to their kennels; and just before dawn had\r\ntouched the heights of the downs he blew his horn before his postern\r\ndoor. And the aged guardian of the door when he opened it to Orion saw\r\nthe great horn of the unicorn bobbing over his head.\r\n\r\nThis was the horn that was sent in later years as a gift from the Pope\r\nto King Francis. Benvenuto Cellini tells of it in his memoirs. He tells\r\nhow Pope Clement sent for him and a certain Tobbia, and ordered them to\r\nmake designs for the setting of a unicorn\'s horn, the finest ever seen.\r\nJudge then of Orion\'s delight when the horn of the first unicorn he ever\r\ntook was such as to be esteemed generations later the finest ever seen,\r\nand in no less a city than Rome, with all her opportunities to acquire\r\nand compare such things. For a number of these curious horns must have\r\nbeen available for the Pope to have selected for the gift the finest\r\never seen; but in the simpler days of my story the rarity of the horn\r\nwas so great that unicorns were still considered fabulous. The year of\r\nthe gift to King Francis would be about 1530, the horn being mounted in\r\ngold; and the contract went to Tobbia and not to Benvenuto Cellini. I\r\nmention the date because there are those who care little for a tale if\r\nit be not here and there supported by history, and who even in history\r\ncare more for fact than philosophy. If any such reader have followed the\r\nfortunes of Orion so far he will be hungry by now for a date or a\r\nhistorical fact. As for the date, I give him 1530. While for the\r\nhistorical fact I select that generous gift recorded by Benvenuto\r\nCellini, because it may well be that just where he came to unicorns such\r\na reader may have felt furthest away from history and have felt\r\nloneliest just at this point for want of historical things. How the\r\nunicorn\'s horn found its way from the Castle of Erl, and in what hands\r\nit wandered, and how it came at last to the City of Rome, would of\r\ncourse make another book.\r\n\r\nBut all that I need say now about that horn is that Orion took the whole\r\nhead to Threl, who took off the skin and washed it and boiled the skull\r\nfor hours, and replaced the skin and stuffed the neck with straw; and\r\nOrion set it in the midmost place among all the heads that hung in the\r\nhigh hall. And the rumour went all through Erl, as swift as unicorns\r\ngallop, telling of this fine horn that Orion had won. So that the\r\nparliament of Erl met again in the forge of Narl. They sat at the table\r\nthere debating the rumour; and others besides Threl had seen the head.\r\nAnd at first, for the sake of old divisions, some held to their opinion\r\nthat there had been no unicorn. They drank Narl\'s goodly mead and argued\r\nagainst the monster. But after a while, whether Threl\'s argument\r\nconvinced them, or whether as is more likely, they yielded from\r\ngenerosity, which arose like a beautiful flower out of the mellow mead,\r\nwhatever it was the debate of those that opposed the unicorn\r\nlanguished, and when the vote was put it was declared that Orion had\r\nkilled a unicorn, which he had hunted hither from beyond the fields we\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nAnd at this they all rejoiced; for they saw at last the magic for which\r\nthey had longed, and for which they had planned so many years ago, when\r\nall were younger and had had more hope in their plans. And as soon as\r\nthe vote was taken Narl brought out more mead, and they drank again to\r\nmark the happy occasion: for magic at last, said they, had come on\r\nOrion, and a glorious future surely awaited Erl. And the long room and\r\nthe candles and the friendly men and the deep comfort of mead made it\r\neasy to look a little way forward into time and to see a year or so that\r\nhad not yet come, and to see coming glories glowing a little way off.\r\nAnd they told again of the days, but nearer now, when the distant lands\r\nshould hear of the vale they loved: they told again of the fame of the\r\nfields of Erl going from city to city. One praised its castle, another\r\nits huge high downs, another the vale itself all hidden from every land,\r\nanother the dear quaint houses built by an olden folk, another the deep\r\nof the woods that lay over the sky-line; and all spoke of the time when\r\nthe wide world should hear of it all, because of the magic that there\r\nwas in Orion; for they knew that the world has a quick ear for magic,\r\nand always turns toward the wonderful even though it be nearly asleep.\r\nTheir voices were high, praising magic, telling again of the unicorn,\r\nglorying in the future of Erl, when suddenly in the doorway stood the\r\nFreer. He was there in his long white robe with its trimming of mauve,\r\nin the door with the night behind him. As they looked, in the light of\r\ntheir candles, they could see he was wearing an emblem, on a chain of\r\ngold round his neck. Narl bade him welcome, some moved a chair to the\r\ntable; but he had heard them speak of the unicorn. He lifted his voice\r\nfrom where he stood, and addressed them. "Cursed be unicorns," he said,\r\n"and all their ways, and all things that be magic."\r\n\r\nIn the awe that suddenly changed the mellow room one cried: "Master!\r\nCurse not us!"\r\n\r\n"Good Freer," said Narl, "we hunted no unicorn."\r\n\r\nBut the Freer raised up his hand against unicorns and cursed them yet.\r\n"Curst be their horn," he cried, "and the place where they dwell, and\r\nthe lilies whereon they feed, curst be all songs that tell of them.\r\nCurst be they utterly with everything that dwelleth beyond salvation."\r\n\r\nHe paused to allow them to renounce the unicorns, standing still in the\r\ndoorway, looking sternly into the room.\r\n\r\nAnd they thought of the sleekness of the unicorn\'s hide, his swiftness,\r\nthe grace of his neck, and his dim beauty cantering by when he came past\r\nErl in the evening. They thought of his stalwart and redoubtable horn;\r\nthey remembered old songs that told of him. They sat in uneasy silence\r\nand would not renounce the unicorn.\r\n\r\nAnd the Freer knew what they thought and he raised his hand again, clear\r\nin the candle-light with the night behind him. "Curst be their speed,"\r\nhe said, "and their sleek white hide; curst be their beauty and all that\r\nthey have of magic, and everything that walks by enchanted streams."\r\n\r\nAnd still he saw in their eyes a lingering love for those things that he\r\nforbade, and therefore he ceased not yet. He lifted his voice yet louder\r\nand continued, with his eye sternly upon those troubled faces: "And\r\ncurst be trolls, elves, goblins and fairies upon the Earth, and\r\nhypogriffs and Pegasus in the air, and all the tribes of the mer-folk\r\nunder the sea. Our holy rites forbid them. And curst be all doubts, all\r\nsingular dreams, all fancies. And from magic may all true folk be turned\r\naway. Amen."\r\n\r\nHe turned round suddenly and was into the night. A wind loitered about\r\nthe door, then flapped it to. And the large room in the forge of Narl\r\nwas as it had been but a few moments before, yet the mellow mood of it\r\nseemed dulled and dim. And then Narl spoke, rising up at the table\'s end\r\nand breaking the gloom of the silence. "Did we plan our plans," he said,\r\n"so long ago, and put our faith in magic, that we should now renounce\r\nmagical things and curse our neighbours, the harmless folk beyond the\r\nfields we know, and the beautiful things of the air, and dead mariners\'\r\nlovers dwelling beneath the sea?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," said some. And they quaffed their mead again.\r\n\r\nAnd then one rose with his horn of mead held high, then another and then\r\nanother, till all were standing upright all round the light of the\r\ncandles. "Magic!" one cried. And the rest with one accord took up his\r\ncry till all were shouting "Magic."\r\n\r\nThe Freer on his homeward way heard that cry of Magic, he gathered his\r\nsacred robe more closely around him and clutched his holy things, and\r\nsaid a spell that kept him from sudden demons and the doubtful things of\r\nthe mist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n                        _On the Verge of Earth_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd on that day Orion rested his hounds. But the next day he rose early\r\nand went to his kennels and loosened the joyous hounds in the shining\r\nmorning, and led them out of the valley and over the downs towards the\r\nfrontier of twilight again. And he took his bow with him no more, but\r\nonly his sword and his whip; for he had come to love the joy of his\r\nfifteen hounds when they hunted the one-horned monster, and felt that he\r\nshared the joy of every hound; while to shoot one with an arrow would be\r\nbut a single joy.\r\n\r\nAll day he went over the fields, greeting some farmer here and there, or\r\nworker in the field, and gaining greetings in return, and good wishes\r\nfor sport. But when evening came and he was near the frontier, fewer and\r\nfewer greeted him as he passed, for he was manifestly travelling where\r\nnone went, whence even their thoughts held back. So he went lonely, yet\r\ncheered by his eager thoughts, and happy in the comradeship of his\r\nhounds; and both his thoughts and his hounds were all for the chase.\r\n\r\nAnd so he came to the barrier of twilight again, where the hedges ran\r\ndown to it from the fields of men and turned strange and dim in a glow\r\nthat is not of our Earth and disappeared in the twilight. He stood with\r\nhis hounds close in against one of these hedges just where it touched\r\nthe barrier. The light just there on the hedge, if like anything of our\r\nEarth, was like the misty dimness that flashes upon a hedge, seen only\r\nacross one field, when touched by the rainbow: in the sky the rainbow is\r\nclear, but close across one wide field the rainbow\'s end scarcely shows,\r\nyet a heavenly strangeness has touched and altered the hedge. In some\r\nsuch light as that glowed the last of the hawthorns that grew in the\r\nfields of men. And just beyond it, like a liquid opal, all full of\r\nwandering lights, lay the barrier through which no man can see, and no\r\nsound come but the sound of the elfin horns, and only that to the ears\r\nof very few. The horns were blowing now, piercing that barrier of dim\r\nlight and silence with the magical resonance of their silver note, that\r\nseemed to beat past all things intervening to come to Orion\'s ear, as\r\nthe sunlight beats through ether to illumine the vales of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe horns died down, and nothing whispered from Elfland; and all the\r\nsounds thenceforth were the sounds of an earthly evening. Even these\r\ngrew few, and still no unicorns came.\r\n\r\nA dog barked far away: a cart, the sole sound on an empty road, went\r\nhomeward wearily: someone spoke in a lane, and then left the silence\r\nunbroken, for words seemed to offend the hush that was over all our\r\nfields. And in the hush Orion gazed at the frontier, watching for the\r\nunicorns that never came, expecting each moment to see one step through\r\nthe twilight. But he had done unwisely in coming to the same spot at\r\nwhich he had found the five unicorns only two days before. For of all\r\ncreatures the unicorns are the wariest, guarding their beauty from the\r\neye of man with never ceasing watchfulness; dwelling all day beyond the\r\nfields we know, and only entering them rarely at evening, when all is\r\nstill, and with the utmost vigilance, and venturing even then scarcely\r\nbeyond the edges. To come on such animals twice at the same spot within\r\ntwo days with hounds, after hunting and killing one of them, was more\r\nunlikely than Orion thought. But his heart was full of the triumph of\r\nhis hunt, and the scene of it lured him back to it in the way that such\r\nscenes have. And now he gazed at the frontier, waiting for one of these\r\ngreat creatures to come proudly through, a great tangible shape out of\r\nthe dim opalescence. And no unicorn came.\r\n\r\nAnd standing gazing there so long, that curious boundary began to lure\r\nhim till his thoughts went roaming with its wandering lights and he\r\ndesired the peaks of Elfland. And well they knew that lure who dwelt on\r\nthose farms lying all along the edge of the fields we know, and wisely\r\nkept their eyes turned ever away from that wonder that lay with its\r\nmarvel of colours so near to the backs of their houses. For there was a\r\nbeauty in it such as is not in all our fields; and it is told those\r\nfarmers in youth how, if they gaze upon those wandering lights, there\r\nwill remain no joy for them in the goodly fields, the fine, brown\r\nfurrows or the waves of wheat, or in any things of ours; but their\r\nhearts will be far from here with elfin things, yearning always for\r\nunknown mountains and for folk not blessed by the Freer.\r\n\r\nAnd standing now, while our earthly evening waned, upon the very edge of\r\nthat magical twilight, the things of Earth rushed swiftly from his\r\nremembrance, and suddenly all his care was for elfin things. Of all the\r\nfolk that trod the paths of men he remembered only his mother, and\r\nsuddenly knew, as though the twilight had told him, that she was\r\nenchanted and he of a magical line. And none had told him this, but he\r\nknew it now.\r\n\r\nFor years he had wondered through many an evening and guessed where his\r\nmother was gone: he had guessed in lonely silence; none knew what the\r\nchild was guessing: and now an answer seemed to hang in the air; it\r\nseemed as though she were only a little way off across the enchanted\r\ntwilight that divided those farms from Elfland. He moved three steps and\r\ncame to the frontier itself; his foot was the furthest that stood in the\r\nfields we know: against his face the frontier lay like a mist, in which\r\nall the colours of pearls were dancing gravely. A hound stirred as he\r\nmoved, the pack turned their heads and eyed him; he stood, and they\r\nrested again. He tried to see through the barrier, but saw nothing but\r\nwandering lights that were made by the massing of twilights from the\r\nending of thousands of days, which had been preserved by magic to build\r\nthat barrier there. Then he called to his mother across that mighty gap,\r\nthose few preserved by magic to build that barrier there. Then he upon\r\none side Earth and the haunts of men, and the time that we measure by\r\nminutes and hours and years, and upon the other Elfland and another way\r\nof time. He called to her twice and listened, and called again; and\r\nnever a cry or a whisper came out of Elfland. He felt then the magnitude\r\nof the gulf that divided him from her, and knew it to be vast and dark\r\nand strong, like the gulfs that set apart our times from a bygone day,\r\nor that stand between daily life and the things of dream, or between\r\nfolk tilling the Earth and the heroes of song, or between those living\r\nyet and those they mourn. And the barrier twinkled and sparkled as\r\nthough so airy a thing never divided lost years from that fleeing hour\r\ncalled Now.\r\n\r\nHe stood there with the cries of Earth faint in the late evening, behind\r\nhim, and the mellow glow of the soft earthly twilight; and before him,\r\nclose to his face, the utter silence of Elfland, and the barrier that\r\nmade that silence, gleaming with its strange beauty. And now he thought\r\nno more of earthly things, but only gazed into that wall of twilight, as\r\nprophets tampering with forbidden lore gaze into cloudy crystals. And to\r\nall that was elvish in Orion\'s blood, to all that he had of magic from\r\nhis mother, the little lights of the twilight-builded boundary lured and\r\ntempted and beckoned. He thought of his mother dwelling in lonely ease\r\nbeyond the rage of Time, he thought of the glories of Elfland, dimly\r\nknown by magical memories that he had had from his mother. The little\r\ncries of the earthly evening behind him he heeded no more nor heard. And\r\nwith all these little cries were lost to him also the ways and the needs\r\nof men, the things they plan, the things they toil for and hope for, and\r\nall the little things their patience achieves. In the new knowledge that\r\nhad come to him beside this glittering boundary that he was of magical\r\nblood he desired at once to cast off his allegiance to Time, and to\r\nleave the lands that lay under Time\'s dominion and were ever scourged by\r\nhis tyranny, to leave them with no more than five short paces, and to\r\nenter the ageless land where his mother sat with her father while he\r\nreigned on his misty throne in that hall of bewildering beauty at which\r\nonly song has guessed. No more was Erl his home, no more were the ways\r\nof man his ways: their fields to his feet no more! But the peaks of the\r\nElfin Mountains were to him now what welcoming eaves of straw are to\r\nearthly labourers at evening; the fabulous, the unearthly, were to Orion\r\nhome. Thus had that barrier of twilight, too long seen, enchanted him;\r\nso much more magical was it than any earthly evening.\r\n\r\nAnd there are those that might have gazed long at it and even yet turned\r\naway; but not easily Orion; for though magic has power to charm worldly\r\nthings they respond to enchantment heavily and slowly, while all that\r\nwas magic in Orion\'s blood flashed answer to the magic that shone in the\r\nrampart of Elfland. It was made of the rarest lights that wander in air,\r\nand the fairest flashes of sunlight that astonish our fields through\r\nstorm, and the mists of little streams, and the glow of flowers in\r\nmoonlight, and all the ends of our rainbows with all their beauty and\r\nmagic, and scraps of the gloaming of evenings long treasured in aged\r\nminds. Into this enchantment he stepped to have done with mundane\r\nthings; but as his foot touched the twilight a hound that had sat behind\r\nhim under the hedge, held back from the chase so long, stretched its\r\nbody a little and uttered one of those low cries of impatience that\r\namongst the ways of man most nearly resembles a yawn. And old habit, at\r\nthat sound made Orion turn his head, and he saw the hound and went up to\r\nhim for a moment, and patted him and would have said farewell; but all\r\nthe hounds were around him then, nosing his hands and looking up at his\r\nface. And standing there amongst his eager hounds, Orion, who but a\r\nmoment before was dreaming of fabulous things with thoughts that floated\r\nover the magical lands and scaled the enchanted peaks of the Elfin\r\nMountains, was suddenly at the call of his earthly lineage. It was not\r\nthat he cared more to hunt than to be with his mother beyond the fret of\r\ntime, in the lands of her father lovelier than anything song hath said;\r\nit was not that he loved his hounds so much that he could not leave\r\nthem; but his fathers had followed the chase age after age, as his\r\nmother\'s line had timelessly followed magic; and the call towards magic\r\nwas strong while he looked on magical things, and the old earthly line\r\nwas as strong to beckon him to the chase. The beautiful boundary of\r\ntwilight had drawn his desires towards Elfland, next moment his hounds\r\nhad turned him another way: it is hard for any of us to avoid the grip\r\nof external things.\r\n\r\nFor some moments Orion stood thinking among his hounds, trying to decide\r\nwhich way to turn, trying to weigh the easy lazy ages, that hung over\r\nuntroubled lawns and the listless glories of Elfland, with the good\r\nbrown plough and the pasture and the little hedges of Earth. But the\r\nhounds were around him, nosing, crying, looking into his eyes, speaking\r\nto him if tails and paws and large brown eyes can speak, saying "Away!\r\nAway!" To think amongst all that tumult was impossible; he could not\r\ndecide, and the hounds had it their way, and he and they went, together,\r\nhome over the fields we know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                        _Orion Appoints a Whip_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd many times again, while the winter wore away, Orion went back again\r\nwith his hounds to that wonderful boundary, and waited there while the\r\nearthly twilight faded; and sometimes saw the unicorns come through,\r\ncraftily, silently, when our fields were still, great beautiful shapes\r\nof white. But he brought back no more horns to the castle of Erl, nor\r\nhunted again across the fields we know; for the unicorns when they came\r\nmoved into our fields no more than a few bare paces, and Orion was not\r\nable to cut one off again. Once when he tried he nearly lost all his\r\nhounds, some being already within the boundary when he beat them back\r\nwith his whip; another two yards and the sound of his earthly horn could\r\nnever more have reached them. It was this that taught him that for all\r\nthe power that he had over his hounds, and even though in that power was\r\nsomething of magic, yet one man without help could not hunt hounds, so\r\nnear to that edge over which if one should stray it would be lost\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nAfter this Orion watched the lads at their games in evenings at Erl,\r\ntill he had marked three that in speed and strength seemed to excel the\r\nrest; and two of these he chose to be whippers-in. He went to the\r\ncottage of one of them when the games were over, just as the lights were\r\nlit, a tall lad with great speed of limb; the lad and his mother were\r\nthere and both rose from the table as the father opened the door and\r\nOrion came in. And cheerily Orion asked the lad if he would come with\r\nthe hounds and carry a whip and prevent any from straying. And a silence\r\nfell. All knew that Orion hunted strange beasts and took his hounds to\r\nstrange places. None there had ever stepped beyond the fields we know.\r\nThe lad feared to pass beyond them. His parents were full loth to let\r\nhim go. At length the silence was broken by excuses and muttered\r\nsentences and unfinished things, and Orion saw that the lad would not\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nHe went then to the house of the other. There too the candles were lit\r\nand a table spread. There were two old women there and the lad at their\r\nsupper. And to them Orion told how he needed a whipper-in, and asked the\r\nlad to come. Their fear in that house was more marked. The old women\r\ncried out together that the lad was too young, that he could not run so\r\nwell as he used to, that he was not worthy of so great an honour, that\r\ndogs never would trust him. And much more than this they said, till they\r\nbecame incoherent. Orion left them and went to the house of the third.\r\nIt was the same here. The elders had desired magic for Erl, but the\r\nactual touch of it, or the mere thought of it, perturbed the folk in\r\ntheir cottages. None would spare their sons to go whither they knew not,\r\nto have dealings with things that rumour, like a large and sinister\r\nshadow, had so grimly magnified in the hamlet of Erl. So Orion went\r\nalone with his hounds when he took them up from the valley and went\r\neastwards over our fields where Earth\'s folk would not go.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the month of March, and Orion slept in his tower, when\r\nthere came up to him from far below, shrill and clear in the early\r\nmorning, the sound of his peacocks calling. The bleat of sheep far up on\r\nthe downs came to wake him too, and cocks were crowing clamourously, for\r\nSpring was singing through the sunny air. He rose and went to his\r\nhounds; and soon early labourers saw him go up the steep side of the\r\nvalley with all his hounds behind him, tan patches against the green.\r\nAnd so he passed over the fields we know. And so he was come, before the\r\nsun had set, to that strip of land from which all men turned away, where\r\nwestward stood men\'s houses among fields of fat brown clay and eastward\r\nthe Elfin Mountains shone over the boundary of twilight.\r\n\r\nHe went with his hounds along the last hedge, down to the boundary. And\r\nno sooner had he come there than he saw a fox quite close slip out of\r\nthe twilight between Earth and Elfland, and run a few yards along the\r\nedge of our fields and then slip back again. And of this Orion thought\r\nnothing, for it is the way of the fox thus to haunt the edge of Elfland\r\nand to return again to our fields: it is thus that he brings us\r\nsomething of which none of our cities guess. But soon the fox appeared\r\nagain out of the twilight and ran a little way and was back in the\r\nluminous barrier once more. Then Orion watched to see what the fox was\r\ndoing. And yet again it appeared in the field we know, and dodged back\r\ninto the twilight. And the hounds watched too, and showed no longing to\r\nhunt it, for they had tasted fabulous blood.\r\n\r\nOrion walked along beside the twilight in the direction in which the\r\nfox was going, with his curiosity growing the more that the fox dodged\r\nin and out of our fields. The hounds followed him slowly and soon lost\r\ntheir interest in what the fox was doing. And all at once the curious\r\nthing was explained, for Lurulu all of a sudden skipped through the\r\ntwilight, and that troll appeared in our fields: it was with him that\r\nthe fox was playing.\r\n\r\n"A man," said Lurulu aloud to himself, or to his comrade the fox,\r\nspeaking in troll-talk. And all at once Orion remembered the troll that\r\nhad come into his nursery with his little charm against time, and had\r\nleaped from shelf to shelf and across the ceiling and enraged\r\nZiroonderel who had feared for her crockery.\r\n\r\n"The troll!" he said, also in troll-talk; for his mother had murmured it\r\nto him as a child when she told him tales of the trolls and their\r\nage-old songs.\r\n\r\n"Who is this that knows troll-talk?" said Lurulu.\r\n\r\nAnd Orion told his name, and this meant nothing to Lurulu. But he\r\nsquatted down and rummaged a little while in what answers in trolls to\r\nour memory; and during his ransacking of much trivial remembrance that\r\nhad eluded the destruction of time in the fields we know, and the\r\nlistless apathy of unchanging ages in Elfland, he came all at once on\r\nhis remembrance of Erl; and looked at Orion again and began to cogitate.\r\nAnd at this same moment Orion told to the troll the august name of his\r\nmother. At once Lurulu made what is known amongst the trolls of Elfland\r\nas the abasement of the five points; that is to say he bowed himself to\r\nthe ground on his two knees, his two hands and his forehead. Then he\r\nsprang up again with a high leap into the air; for reverence rested not\r\non his spirit long.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing in men\'s fields?" said Orion.\r\n\r\n"Playing" said Lurulu.\r\n\r\n"What do you do in Elfland?"\r\n\r\n"Watch time," said Lurulu.\r\n\r\n"That would not amuse me," said Orion.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve never done it," said Lurulu. "You cannot watch time in the\r\nfields of men."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" asked Orion.\r\n\r\n"It moves too fast."\r\n\r\nOrion pondered awhile on this but could make nothing of it; because,\r\nnever having gone from the fields we know, he knew only one pace of\r\ntime, and so had no means of comparison.\r\n\r\n"How many years have gone over you," asked the troll, "since we spoke in\r\nErl?"\r\n\r\n"Years?" said Orion.\r\n\r\n"A hundred?" guessed the troll.\r\n\r\n"Nearly twelve," said Orion. "And you?"\r\n\r\n"It is still to-day" said the troll.\r\n\r\nAnd Orion would not speak any more of time, for he cared not for the\r\ndiscussion of a subject of which he appeared to know less than a common\r\ntroll.\r\n\r\n"Will you carry a whip," he said, "and run with my hounds when we hunt\r\nthe unicorn over the fields we know."\r\n\r\nLurulu looked searchingly at the hounds, watching their brown eyes: the\r\nhounds turned doubtful noses towards the troll and sniffed enquiringly.\r\n\r\n"They are dogs," said the troll, as though that were against them. "Yet\r\nthey have pleasant thoughts."\r\n\r\n"You will carry the whip then," said Orion.\r\n\r\n"M, yes. Yes," said the troll.\r\n\r\nSo Orion gave him his own whip there and then, and blew his horn and\r\nwent away from the twilight, and told Lurulu to keep the hounds\r\ntogether and to bring them on behind him.\r\n\r\nAnd the hounds were uneasy at the sight of the troll, and sniffed and\r\nsniffed again, but could not make him human, and were loth to obey a\r\ncreature no larger than them. They ran up to him through curiosity, and\r\nran away in disgust, and straggled through disobedience. But the\r\nboundless resources of that nimble troll were not thus easily thwarted,\r\nand the whip went suddenly up, looking three times as large in that tiny\r\nhand, and the lash flew forward and cracked on the tip of a hound\'s\r\nnose. The hound yelped, then looked astonished, and the rest were uneasy\r\nstill: they must have thought it an accident. But again the lash shot\r\nforward and cracked on another nose-tip; and the hounds saw then that it\r\nwas not chance that guided those stinging shots, but a deadly unerring\r\neye. And from that time on they reverenced Lurulu, although he never\r\nsmelt human.\r\n\r\nSo went Orion and his pack of hounds in the late evening homewards, and\r\nno sheep-dog kept the flock on wolf-haunted wold safer or closer than\r\nLurulu kept the pack: he was on each flank or behind them, wherever a\r\nstraggler was, and could leap right over the pack from side to side. And\r\nthe pale-blue Elfin Mountains faded from view before Orion had gone from\r\nthe frontier as much as a hundred paces, for their gloomless peaks were\r\nhid by the earthly darkness that was deepening wide over the fields we\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nHomeward they went, and soon there appeared above them the wandering\r\nmultitude of our earth-seen stars. Lurulu now and then looked up to\r\nmarvel at them, as we have all done at some time; but for the most part\r\nhe fixed his attention on the hounds, for now that he was in earthly\r\nfields he was concerned with the things of Earth. And never one hound\r\nloitered but that Lurulu\'s whip would touch him, with its tiny\r\nexplosion, perhaps on the tip of its tail, scattering a little dust of\r\nfragments of hair and whipcord; and the hound would yelp and run in to\r\nthe others, and all the pack would know that another of those unerring\r\nshots had gone home.\r\n\r\nA certain grace with a whip, a certain sureness of aim, comes when a\r\nlife is devoted to the carrying of a whip amongst hounds; comes, say, in\r\ntwenty years. And sometimes it runs in families; and that is better than\r\nyears of practice. But neither years of practice nor the wont of the\r\nwhip in the blood can give the certain aim that one thing can; and that\r\none thing is magic. The hurl of the lash, as immediate as the sudden\r\nturn of an eye, its flash to a chosen spot as direct as sight, were not\r\nof this Earth. And though the cracks of that whip might have seemed to\r\npassing men to be no more than the work of an earthly huntsman, yet not\r\na hound but knew that there was in it more than this, a thing from\r\nbeyond our fields.\r\n\r\nThere was a touch of dawn in the sky when Orion saw again the village of\r\nErl, sending up pillars of smoke from early fires below him, and came\r\nwith his hounds and his new whipper-in down the side of the valley.\r\nEarly windows winked at him as he went down the street and came in the\r\nsilence and chill to the empty kennels. And when the hounds were all\r\ncurled up on their straw he found a place for Lurulu, a mouldering loft\r\nin which were sacks and a few heaps of hay: from a pigeon-loft just\r\nbeyond it some of the pigeons had strayed, and dwelt all along the\r\nrafters. There Orion left Lurulu, and went to his tower, cold with the\r\nwant of sleep and food; and weary as he would not have been if he had\r\nfound a unicorn, but the noise of the troll\'s chatter when he had found\r\nhim on the frontier had made it useless to watch for those wary beasts\r\nthat evening. Orion slept. But the troll in the mouldering loft sat long\r\non his bundle of hay observing the ways of time. He saw through cracks\r\nin old shutters the stars go moving by; he saw them pale: he saw the\r\nother light spread; he saw the wonder of sunrise: he felt the gloom of\r\nthe loft all full of the coo of the pigeons; he watched their restless\r\nways: he heard wild birds stir in near elms, and men abroad in the\r\nmorning, and horses and carts and cows; and everything changing as the\r\nmorning grew. A land of change! The decay of the boards in the loft, and\r\nthe moss outside in the mortar, and old lumber mouldering away, all\r\nseemed to tell the same story. Change and nothing abiding. He thought of\r\nthe age-old calm that held the beauty of Elfland. And then he thought of\r\nthe tribe of trolls he had left, wondering what they would think of the\r\nways of Earth. And the pigeons were suddenly terrified by wild peals of\r\nLurulu\'s laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n              _Lurulu Watches the Restlessness of Earth_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the day wore on and still Orion slept heavily, and even the hounds\r\nlay silent in their kennels a little way off, and the coming and going\r\nof men and carts below had nothing to do with the troll, Lurulu began to\r\nfeel lonely. So thick are the brown trolls in the dells they inhabit\r\nthat none feels lonely there. They sit there silent, enjoying the beauty\r\nof Elfland or their own impudent thoughts, or at rare moments when\r\nElfland is stirred from its deep natural calm their laughter floods the\r\ndells. They were no more lonely there than rabbits are. But in all the\r\nfields of Earth there was only one troll; and that troll felt lonely.\r\nThe door of the pigeon loft was open some ten feet from the door of the\r\nhayloft, and some six feet higher. A ladder led to the hayloft, clamped\r\nto the wall with iron; but nothing at all communicated with the\r\npigeon-loft lest cats should go that way. From it came the murmur of\r\nabundant life, which attracted the lonely troll. The jump from door to\r\ndoor was nothing to him, and he landed in the pigeon-loft in his usual\r\nattitude, with a look of impudent welcome upon his face. But the pigeons\r\npoured away on a roar of wings through their windows, and the troll was\r\nstill lonely.\r\n\r\nHe liked the pigeon-loft as soon as he looked at it. He liked the signs\r\nthat he saw of teeming life, the hundred little houses of slate and\r\nplaster, the myriad feathers, and the musty smell. He liked the age-old\r\nease of the sleepy loft, and the huge spiders-webs that draped the\r\ncorners, holding years and years of dust. He did not know what cobwebs\r\nwere, never having seen them in Elfland, but he admired their\r\nworkmanship.\r\n\r\nThe age of the pigeon-loft that had filled the corners with cobwebs, and\r\nbroken patches of plaster away from the wall, shewing ruddy bricks\r\nbeneath, and laid bare the laths in the roof and even the slates beyond,\r\ngave to the dreamy place an air not unlike to the calm of Elfland; but\r\nbelow it and all around Lurulu noted the restlessness of Earth. Even the\r\nsunlight through the little ventilation-holes that shone on the wall\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\nPresently there came the roar of the pigeons\' returning wings and the\r\ncrash of their feet on the slate roof above him, but they did not yet\r\ncome in again to their homes. He saw the shadow of this roof cast on\r\nanother roof below him, and the restless shadows of the pigeons along\r\nthe edge. He observed the grey lichen covering most of the lower roof,\r\nand the neat round patches of newer yellow lichen on the shapeless mass\r\nof the grey. He heard a duck call out slowly six or seven times. He\r\nheard a man come into a stable below him and lead a horse away. A hound\r\nwoke and cried out. Some jackdaws, disturbed from some tower, passed\r\nover high in the air with boisterous voices. He saw big clouds go\r\nhurrying along the tops of far hills. He heard a wild pigeon call from a\r\nneighbouring tree. Some men went by talking. And after a while he\r\nperceived to his astonishment what he had had no leisure to notice on\r\nhis previous visit to Erl, that even the shadows of houses moved; for he\r\nsaw that the shadow of the roof under which he sat had moved a little on\r\nthe roof below, over the grey and yellow lichen. Perpetual movement and\r\nperpetual change! He contrasted it, in wonder, with the deep calm of his\r\nhome, where the moment moved more slowly than the shadows of houses\r\nhere, and did not pass until all the content with which a moment is\r\nstored had been drawn from it by every creature in Elfland.\r\n\r\nAnd then with a whirring and whining of wings the pigeons began to come\r\nback. They came from the tops of the battlements of the highest tower of\r\nErl, on which they had sheltered awhile, feeling guarded by its great\r\nheight and its hoary age from this strange new thing that they feared.\r\nThey came back and sat on the sills of their little windows and looked\r\nin with one eye at the troll. Some were all white, but the grey ones had\r\nrainbow-coloured necks that were scarce less lovely than those colours\r\nthat made the splendour of Elfland; and Lurulu as they watched him\r\nsuspiciously where he sat still in a corner longed for their dainty\r\ncompanionship. And, when these restless children of a restless air and\r\nEarth still would not enter, he tried to soothe them with the\r\nrestlessness to which they were accustomed and in which he believed all\r\nfolk that dwelt in our fields delighted. He leaped up suddenly; he\r\nsprang on to a slate-built house for a pigeon high on a wall; he darted\r\nacross to the next wall and back to the floor; but there was an outcry\r\nof wings and the pigeons were gone. And gradually he learned that the\r\npigeons preferred stillness.\r\n\r\nTheir wings roared back soon to the roof; their feet thumped and clicked\r\non the slates again; but not for long did they return to their homes.\r\nAnd the lonely troll looked out of their windows observing the ways of\r\nEarth. He saw a water-wagtail light on the roof below him: he watched it\r\nuntil it went. And then two sparrows came to some corn that had been\r\ndropped on the ground: he noted them too. Each was an entirely new genus\r\nto the troll, and he showed no more interest as he watched every\r\nmovement of the sparrows than should we if we met with an utterly\r\nunknown bird. When the sparrows were gone the duck quacked again, so\r\ndeliberately that another ten minutes passed while Lurulu tried to\r\ninterpret what it was saying, and although he desisted then because\r\nother interests attracted him he felt sure it was something important.\r\nThen the jackdaws tumbled by again, but their voices sounded frivolous,\r\nand Lurulu did not give them much attention. To the pigeons on the roof\r\nthat would not come home he listened long, not trying to interpret what\r\nthey were saying, yet satisfied with the case as the pigeons put it;\r\nfeeling that they told the story of life, and that all was well. And he\r\nfelt as he listened to the low talk of the pigeons that Earth must have\r\nbeen going on for a long time.\r\n\r\nBeyond the roofs the tall trees rose up, leafless except for evergreen\r\noaks and some laurels and pines and yews, and the ivy that climbed up\r\ntrunks, but the buds of the beech were getting ready to burst: and the\r\nsunlight glittered and flashed on the buds and leaves, and the ivy and\r\nlaurel shone. A breeze passed by and some smoke drifted from some near\r\nchimney. Far away Lurulu saw a huge grey wall of stone that circled a\r\ngarden all asleep in the sun; and clear in the sunlight he saw a\r\nbutterfly sail by, and swoop when it came to the garden. And then he saw\r\ntwo peacocks go slowly past. He saw the shadow of the roofs darkening\r\nthe lower part of the shining trees. He heard a cock crow somewhere,\r\nand a hound spoke out again. And then a sudden shower rained on the\r\nroofs, and at once the pigeons wanted to come home. They alighted\r\noutside their little windows again and all looked sideways at the troll;\r\nLurulu kept very still this time; and after a while the pigeons, though\r\nthey saw that he was by no means one of themselves, agreed that he did\r\nnot belong to the tribe of cat, and returned at last to the street of\r\ntheir tiny houses and there continued their curious age-old tale. And\r\nLurulu longed to repay them with curious tales of the trolls, the\r\ntreasured legends of Elfland, but found that he could not make them\r\nunderstand troll-talk. So he sat and listened to them talking, till it\r\nseemed to him they were trying to lull the restlessness of Earth, and\r\nthought that they might by drowsy incantation be putting some spell\r\nagainst time, through which it could not come to harm their nests; for\r\nthe power of time was not made clear to him yet and he knew not yet that\r\nnothing in our fields has the strength to hold out against time. The\r\nvery nests of the pigeons were built on the ruins of old nests, on a\r\nsolid layer of crumbled things that time had made in that pigeon-loft,\r\nas outside it the strata are made from the ruins of hills. So vast and\r\nceaseless a ruin was not yet clear to the troll, for his sharp\r\nunderstanding had only been meant to guide him through the lull and the\r\ncalm of Elfland, and he busied himself with a tinier consideration. For\r\nseeing that the pigeons seemed now amicable he leapt back to his hayloft\r\nand returned with a bundle of hay, which he put down in a corner to make\r\nhimself comfortable there. When the pigeons saw all this movement they\r\nlooked at him sideways again, jerking their necks queerly, but in the\r\nend decided to accept the troll as a lodger; and he curled up on his hay\r\nand listened to the history of Earth, which he believed the tale of the\r\npigeons to be, though he did not know their language.\r\n\r\nBut the day wore on and hunger came on the troll, far sooner than ever\r\nit did in Elfland, where even when he was hungry he had no more to do\r\nthan to reach up and take the berries that hung low from the trees, that\r\ngrew in the forest that bordered the dells of the trolls. And it is\r\nbecause the trolls eat them whenever hunger comes on them, which it\r\nrarely does, that these curious fruits are called trollberries. He\r\nleaped now from the pigeon-loft and scampered abroad, looking all round\r\nfor trollberries. And there were no berries at all, for there is but one\r\nseason for berries, as we know well; it is one of the tricks of time.\r\nBut that all the berries on Earth should pass away for a period was to\r\nthe troll too astounding to be comprehended at all. He was all among\r\nfarm-buildings, and presently he saw a rat humping himself slowly along\r\nthrough a dark shed. He knew nothing of rat-talk; but it is a curious\r\nthing that when any two folk are after the same thing, each somehow\r\nknows what the other is after, at once, as soon as he sees him. We are\r\nall partially blind to other folks\' occupations, but when we meet anyone\r\nengaged in our own pursuit then somehow we soon seem to know without\r\nbeing told. And the moment that Lurulu saw the rat in the shed he seemed\r\nto know that it was looking for food. So he followed the rat quietly.\r\nAnd soon the rat came up to a sack of oats, and to open that took him no\r\nlonger than it does to shell a row of peas, and soon he was eating the\r\noats.\r\n\r\n"Are they good?" said the troll in troll-talk.\r\n\r\nThe rat looked at him dubiously, noting his resemblance to man, and on\r\nthe other hand his unlikeness to dogs. But on the whole the rat was\r\ndissatisfied, and after a long look turned away in silence and went out\r\nof the shed. Then Lurulu ate the oats and found they were good.\r\n\r\nWhen he had had enough oats the troll returned to the pigeon-loft, and\r\nsat a long while there at one of the little windows looking out across\r\nthe roofs at the strange new ways of time. And the shadow upon the trees\r\nwent higher, and the glitter was gone from the laurels and all the lower\r\nleaves. And then the light of the ivy-leaves and the holm-oaks turned\r\nfrom silvery to pale gold. And the shadow went higher still. All the\r\nworld full of change.\r\n\r\nAn old man with a narrow long white beard came slowly to the kennels,\r\nand opened the door and went in and fed the hounds with meat that he\r\nbrought from a shed. All the evening rang with the hounds\' outcry. And\r\npresently the old man came out again, and his slow departure seemed to\r\nthe watchful troll yet more of the restlessness of Earth.\r\n\r\nAnd then a man came slowly leading a horse to the stable below the\r\npigeon-loft; and went away again and left the horse eating. The shadows\r\nwere higher now on walls and roofs and trees. Only the tree-tops and the\r\ntip of a high belfry had the light any longer. The ruddy buds on high\r\nbeeches were glowing now like dull rubies. And a great serenity came in\r\nthe pale blue sky, and small clouds leisurely floating there turned to a\r\nflaming orange, past which the rooks went homewards to some clump of\r\ntrees under the downs. It was a peaceful scene. And yet to the troll, as\r\nhe watched in the musty loft amongst generations of feathers, the noise\r\nof the rooks and their multitude thronging the sky, the dull continual\r\nsound of the horse eating, the leisurely sound now and then of homeward\r\nfeet, and the slow shutting of gates, seemed to be proof that nothing\r\never rested in all the fields we know; and the sleepy lazy village that\r\ndreamed in the Vale of Erl, and that knew no more of other lands than\r\ntheir folk knew of its story, seemed to that simple troll to be a vortex\r\nof restlessness.\r\n\r\nAnd now the sunlight was gone from the highest places, and a moon a few\r\ndays old was shining over the pigeon-loft, out of sight of Lurulu\'s\r\nwindow, but filling the air with a strange new tint. And all these\r\nchanges bewildered him, so that he thought awhile of returning to\r\nElfland, but the whim came again to his mind to astonish the other\r\ntrolls; and while this whim was on him he slipped down from the loft,\r\nand went to find Orion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n             _Lurulu Speaks of Earth and the Ways of Men_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe troll had found Orion in his castle and had laid his plan before\r\nhim. Briefly the plan was to have more whips for the pack. For one alone\r\ncould not always guard every hound from straying when they went to the\r\nboundary of twilight, where but a few yards away lay spaces from which\r\nif a hound ever came home, as lost hounds do at evening, it would come\r\nhome all worn and bedraggled with age for its half hour of straying.\r\nEach hound, said Lurulu, should have its troll to guide it, and to run\r\nwith it when it hunted, and be its servant when it came home hungry and\r\nmuddy. And Orion had seen at once the unequalled advantage of having\r\neach hound controlled by an alert if tiny intelligence, and had told\r\nLurulu to go for the trolls. So now, while the hounds were sleeping on\r\nboards in a doggy mass in each of their kennels, for the dogs and the\r\nbitches dwelt each in a separate house, the troll was scurrying over the\r\nfields we know through twilight trembling on the verge of moonlight,\r\nwith his face turned toward Elfland.\r\n\r\nHe passed a white farm-house with a little window towards him that shone\r\nbright yellow out of a wall pale blue with a tint that it had from the\r\nmoon. Two dogs barked at him and rushed out to chase him, and this troll\r\nwould have tricked them and mocked them on any other day, but now his\r\nmind was full to the brim with his mission, and he heeded them no more\r\nthan a thistledown would have heeded them on a windy day of September,\r\nand went on bouncing over the tips of the grasses till the pursuing dogs\r\nwere far behind and panting.\r\n\r\nAnd long before the stars had paled from any touch of the dawn he came\r\nto the barrier that divides our fields from the home of such things as\r\nhim, and leaping forward out of the earthly night, and high through the\r\nbarrier of twilight, he arrived on all fours on his natal soil in the\r\nageless day of Elfland. Through the gorgeous beauty of that heavy air\r\nthat outshines our lakes at sunrise, and leaves all our colours pale, he\r\nscampered full of the news he had with which to astonish his kith. He\r\ncame to the moors of the trolls where they dwell in their queer\r\nhabitations, and uttered the squeaks as he went whereby the trolls\r\nsummon their folk; and he came to the forest in which the trolls have\r\nmade dwellings in boles of enormous trees; for there be trolls of the\r\nforest and trolls of the moor, two tribes that are friendly and kin; and\r\nthere he uttered again the squeaks of the trolls\' summons. And soon\r\nthere was a rustling of flowers throughout the deeps of the forest, as\r\nthough all four winds were blowing, and the rustling grew and grew, and\r\nthe trolls appeared, and sat down one by one near Lurulu. And still the\r\nrustling grew, troubling the whole wood, and the brown trolls poured on\r\nand sat down round Lurulu. From many a tree-bole, and hollows thick with\r\nfern, they came tumbling in; and from the high thin gomaks afar on the\r\nmoors, to name as are named in Elfland those queer habitations for\r\nwhich there is no earthly name, the odd grey cloth-like material draped\r\ntent-wise about a pole. They gathered about him in the dim but\r\nglittering light that floated amongst the fronds of those magical trees,\r\nwhose soaring trunks out-distanced our eldest pines, and shone on the\r\nspikes of cacti of which our world little dreams. And when the brown\r\nmass of the trolls was all gathered there, till the floor of the forest\r\nlooked as though an Autumn had come to Elfland, strayed out of the\r\nfields we know, and when all the rustling had ceased and the silence was\r\nheavy again as it had been for ages, Lurulu spoke to them telling them\r\ntales of time.\r\n\r\nNever before had such tales been heard in Elfland. Trolls had appeared\r\nbefore in the fields we know, and had come back wondering: but Lurulu\r\namongst the houses of Erl had been in the midst of men; and time, as he\r\ntold the trolls, moved in the village with more wonderful speed than\r\never it did in the grass of the fields of Earth. He told how the light\r\nmoved, he told of shadows, he told how the air was white and bright and\r\npale; he told how for a little while Earth began to grow like Elfland,\r\nwith a kinder light and the beginning of colours, and then just as one\r\nthought of home the light would blink away and the colours be gone. He\r\ntold of stars. He told of cows and goats and the moon, three horned\r\ncreatures that he found curious. He had found more wonder in Earth than\r\nwe remember, though we also saw these things once for the first time;\r\nand out of the wonder he felt at the ways of the fields we know, he made\r\nmany a tale that held the inquisitive trolls and gripped them silent\r\nupon the floor of the forest, as though they were indeed a fall of brown\r\nleaves in October that a frost had suddenly bound. They heard of\r\nchimneys and carts for the first time: with a thrill they heard of\r\nwindmills. They listened spell-bound to the ways of men; and every now\r\nand then, as when he told of hats, there ran through the forest a wave\r\nof little yelps of laughter.\r\n\r\nThen he said that they should see hats and spades and dog-kennels, and\r\nlook through casements and get to know the windmill; and a curiosity\r\narose in the forest amongst that brown mass of trolls, for their race is\r\nprofoundly inquisitive. And Lurulu stopped not here, relying on\r\ncuriosity alone to draw them from Elfland into the fields we know; but\r\nhe drew them also with another emotion. For he spoke of the haughty,\r\nreserved, high, glittering unicorns, who tarry to speak to trolls no\r\nmore than cattle when they drink in pools of ours trouble to speak to\r\nfrogs. They all knew their haunts, they should watch their ways and tell\r\nof these things to man, and the outcome of it would be that they should\r\nhunt the unicorns with nothing less than dogs. Now however slight their\r\nknowledge of dogs, the fear of dogs is--as I have said--universal\r\namongst all creatures that run; and they laughed gustily to think of the\r\nunicorns being hunted with dogs. Thus Lurulu lured them toward Earth\r\nwith spite and curiosity; and knew that he was succeeding; and inwardly\r\nchuckled till he was well warmed within. For amongst the trolls none\r\ngoes in higher repute than one that is able to astound the others, or\r\neven to show them any whimsical thing, or to trick or perplex them\r\nhumorously. Lurulu had Earth to show, whose ways are considered, amongst\r\nthose able to judge, to be fully as quaint and whimsical as the curious\r\nobserver could wish.\r\n\r\nThen up spake a grizzled troll; one that had crossed too often Earth\'s\r\nborder of twilight to watch the ways of men; and, while watching their\r\nways too long, time had grizzled him.\r\n\r\n"Shall we go," he said, "from the woods that all folk know, and the\r\npleasant ways of the Land, to see a new thing, and be swept away by\r\ntime?" And there was a murmur among the trolls, that hummed away through\r\nthe forest and died out, as on Earth the sound of beetles going home.\r\n"Is it not to-day?" he said. "But there they call it to-day, yet none\r\nknows what it is: come back through the border again to look at it and\r\nit is gone. Time is raging there, like the dogs that stray over our\r\nfrontier, barking, frightened and angry and wild to be home."\r\n\r\n"It is even so," said the trolls, though they did not know; but this was\r\na troll whose words carried weight in the forest. "Let us keep to-day,"\r\nsaid that weighty troll, "while we have it, and not be lured where\r\nto-day is too easily lost. For every time men lose it their hair grows\r\nwhiter, their limbs grow weaker and their faces sadder, and they are\r\nnearer still to to-morrow."\r\n\r\nSo gravely he spoke when he uttered that word "to-morrow" that the brown\r\ntrolls were frightened.\r\n\r\n"What happens to-morrow?" one said.\r\n\r\n"They die," said the grizzled troll. "And the others dig in their earth\r\nand put them in, as I have seen them do, and then they go to Heaven, as\r\nI have heard them tell." And a shudder went through the trolls far over\r\nthe floor of the forest.\r\n\r\nAnd Lurulu who had sat angry all this while to hear that weighty troll\r\nspeak ill of Earth, where he would have them come, to astonish them with\r\nits quaintness, spoke now in defence of Heaven.\r\n\r\n"Heaven is a good place," he blurted hotly, though any tales he had\r\nheard of it were few.\r\n\r\n"All the blessed are there," the grizzled troll replied, "and it is full\r\nof angels. What chance would a troll have there? The angels would catch\r\nhim, for they say on Earth that the angels all have wings; they would\r\ncatch a troll and smack him forever and ever."\r\n\r\nAnd all the brown trolls in the forest wept.\r\n\r\n"We are not so easily caught," Lurulu said.\r\n\r\n"They have wings," said the grizzled troll.\r\n\r\nAnd all were sorrowful and shook their heads, for they knew the speed of\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nThe birds of Elfland mostly soared on the heavy air and eyed\r\neverlastingly that fabulous beauty which to them was food and nest, and\r\nof which they sometimes sang; but trolls playing along the border,\r\npeering into the fields we know, had seen the dart and the swoop of\r\nearthly birds, wondering at them as we wonder at heavenly things, and\r\nknew that if wings were after him a poor troll would scarcely escape.\r\n"Welladay," said the trolls.\r\n\r\nThe grizzled troll said no more, and had no need to, for the forest was\r\nfull of their sadness as they sat thinking of Heaven and feared that\r\nthey soon might come there if they dared to inhabit Earth.\r\n\r\nAnd Lurulu argued no more. It was not a time for argument, for the\r\ntrolls were too sad for reason. So he spoke gravely to them of solemn\r\nthings, uttering learned words and standing in reverend attitude. Now\r\nnothing rejoices the trolls as learning does and solemnity, and they\r\nwill laugh for hours at a reverend attitude or any semblance of gravity.\r\nThus he won them back again to the levity that is their natural mood.\r\nAnd when this was accomplished he spoke again of Earth, telling\r\nwhimsical stories of the ways of man.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to write the things that Lurulu said of man, lest I\r\nshould hurt my reader\'s self-esteem, and thereby injure him or her whom\r\nI seek only to entertain; but all the forest rippled and squealed with\r\nlaughter. And the grizzled troll was able to say no more to check the\r\ncuriosity which was growing in all that multitude to see who it was that\r\nlived in houses and had a hat immediately above him and a chimney higher\r\nup, and spoke to dogs and would not speak to pigs, and whose gravity was\r\nfunnier than anything trolls could do. And the whim was on all those\r\ntrolls to go at once to Earth, and see pigs and carts and windmills and\r\nlaugh at man. And Lurulu who had told Orion that he would bring a score\r\nof trolls, was hard set to keep the whole brown mass from coming, so\r\nquickly change the moods and whims of the trolls: had he let them all\r\nhave their way there were no trolls left in Elfland, for even the\r\ngrizzled troll had changed his mind with the rest. Fifty he chose and\r\nled them towards Earth\'s perilous frontier; and away they scurried out\r\nof the gloom of the forest, as a whirl of brown oak-leaves scurries on\r\ndays of November\'s worst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n                _Lirazel Remembers the Fields We Know_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the trolls scurried earthwards to laugh at the ways of man, Lirazel\r\nstirred where she sat on her father\'s knee, who grave and calm on his\r\nthrone of mist and ice had hardly moved for twelve of our earthly years.\r\nShe sighed and the sigh rippled over the fells of dream and lightly\r\ntroubled Elfland. And the dawns and the sunsets and twilight and the\r\npale blue glow of stars, that are blended together forever to be the\r\nlight of Elfland, felt a faint touch of sorrow and all their radiance\r\nshook. For the magic that caught these lights and the spells that bound\r\nthem together, to illumine forever the land that owes no allegiance to\r\nTime, were not so strong as a sorrow rising dark from a royal mood of a\r\nprincess of the elvish line. She sighed, for through her long content\r\nand across the calm of Elfland there had floated a thought of Earth; so\r\nthat in the midmost splendours of Elfland, of which song can barely\r\ntell, she called to mind common cowslips, and many a trivial weed of the\r\nfields we know. And walking in those fields she saw in fancy Orion, upon\r\nthe other side of the boundary of twilight, remote from her by she knew\r\nnot what waste of years. And the magical glories of Elfland and its\r\nbeauty beyond our dreaming, and the deep deep calm in which ages slept,\r\nunhurt unhurried by time, and the art of her father that guarded the\r\nleast of the lilies from fading, and the spells by which he made\r\nday-dreams and yearnings true, held her fancy no longer from roving nor\r\ncontented her any more. And so her sigh blew over the magical land and\r\nslightly troubled the flowers.\r\n\r\nAnd her father felt her sorrow and knew that it troubled the flowers and\r\nknew that it shook the calm that lay upon Elfland, though no more than a\r\nbird would shake a regal curtain, fluttering against its folds, when\r\nwandering lost upon a Summer\'s night. And though he knew too it was but\r\nfor Earth that she sorrowed, preferring some mundane way to the midmost\r\nglories of Elfland, as she sat with him on the throne that may only be\r\ntold of in song, yet even this moved nothing in his magical heart but\r\ncompassion; as we might pity a child who in fanes that to us seemed\r\nsacred might be found to be sighing for some trivial thing. And the more\r\nthat Earth seemed to him unworthy of sorrow, being soon come soon gone,\r\nthe helpless prey of time, an evanescent appearance seen off the coasts\r\nof Elfland, too brief for the graver care of a mind weighted with magic,\r\nthe more he pitied his child for her errant whim that had rashly\r\nwandered here, and become entangled--alas--with the things that pass\r\naway. Ah, well! she was not content. He felt no wrath against Earth that\r\nhad lured her fancies away: she was not content with the innermost\r\nsplendours of Elfland, but she sighed for something more: his tremendous\r\nart should give it. So he raised his right arm up from the thing whereon\r\nit rested, a part of his mystical throne that was made of music and\r\nmirage; he raised his right arm up and a hush fell over Elfland.\r\n\r\nThe great leaves ceased from their murmur through the green deeps of the\r\nforest; silent as carven marble were fabulous bird and monster; and the\r\nbrown trolls scampering earthwards all halted suddenly hushed. Then out\r\nof the hush rose little murmurs of yearning, little sounds as of longing\r\nfor things that no songs can say, sounds like the voices of tears if\r\neach little salt drop could live, and be given a voice to tell of the\r\nways of grief. Then all these little rumours danced gravely into a\r\nmelody that the master of Elfland called up with his magical hand. And\r\nthe melody told of dawn coming up over infinite marshes, far away upon\r\nEarth or some planet that Elfland did not know; growing slowly out of\r\ndeep darkness and starlight and bitter cold; powerless, chilly and\r\ncheerless, scarce overcoming the stars; obscured by shadows of thunder\r\nand hated by all things dark; enduring, growing and glowing; until\r\nthrough the gloom of the marshes and across the chill of the air came\r\nall in a glorious moment the splendour of colour; and dawn went onward\r\nwith this triumphant thing, and the blackest clouds turned slowly rose\r\nand rode in a sea of lilac, and the darkest rocks that had guarded night\r\nshone now with a golden glow. And when his melody could say no more of\r\nthis wonder, that had forever been foreign to all the elvish dominions,\r\nthen the King moved his hand where he held it high, as one might beckon\r\nto birds, and called up a dawn over Elfland, luring it from some planet\r\nof those that are nearest the sun. And fresh and fair though it came\r\nfrom beyond the bourn of geography, and out of an age long lost and\r\nbeyond history\'s ken, a dawn glowed upon Elfland that had known no dawn\r\nbefore. And the dewdrops of Elfland slung from the bended tips of the\r\ngrasses gathered in that dawn to their tiny spheres and held there\r\nshining and wonderful that glory of skies such as ours, the first they\r\nhad ever seen.\r\n\r\nAnd the dawn grew strangely and slowly over those unwonted lands,\r\npouring upon them the colours that day after day our daffodils, and day\r\nafter day our wild roses, through all the weeks of their season, drink\r\ndeep with voluptuous assemblies in utterly silent riot. And a gleam that\r\nwas new to the forest appeared on the long strange leaves, and shadows\r\nunknown to Elfland slipped out from the monstrous tree-boles, and stole\r\nover grasses that had not dreamed of their advent; and the spires of\r\nthat palace perceiving a wonder, less lovely indeed than they, yet knew\r\nthat the stranger was magic, and uttered an answering gleam from their\r\nsacred windows, that flashed over elvish fells like an inspiration and\r\nmingled a flush of rose with the blue of the Elfin Mountains. And\r\nwatchers on wonderful peaks that gazed from their crags for ages, lest\r\nfrom Earth or from any star should come a stranger to Elfland, saw the\r\nfirst blush of the sky as it felt the coming of dawn, and raised their\r\nhorns and blew that call that warned Elfland against a stranger. And the\r\nguardians of savage valleys lifted horns of fabulous bulls and blew the\r\ncall again in the dark of their awful precipices, and echo carried it on\r\nfrom the monstrous marble faces of rocks that repeated the call to all\r\ntheir barbarous company; so Elfland rang with the warning that a strange\r\nthing troubled her coasts. And to the land thus expectant, thus\r\nwatchful, with magical sabres elate along lonely crags, summoned from\r\nblackened scabbards by those horns to repel an enemy, dawn came now wide\r\nnow golden, the old old wonder we know. And the palace with every\r\nmarvel and with all its charms and enchantments flashed out of its\r\nice-blue radiance a glory of welcome or rivalry, adding to Elfland a\r\nsplendour of which only song may say.\r\n\r\nIt was then that the elfin King moved his hand again, where he held it\r\nhigh by the crystal spires of his crown, and waved a way through the\r\nwalls of his magical palace, and showed to Lirazel the unmeasured\r\nleagues of his kingdom. And she saw by magic, for so long as his fingers\r\nmade that spell; the dark green forests and all the fells of Elfland,\r\nand the solemn pale-blue mountains and the valleys that weird folk\r\nguarded, and all the creatures of fable that crept in the dark of huge\r\nleaves, and the riotous trolls as they scampered away towards Earth: she\r\nsaw the watchers lift their horns to their lips, while there flashed a\r\nlight on the horns that was the proudest triumph of the hidden art of\r\nher father, the light of a dawn lured over unthinkable spaces to appease\r\nhis daughter and comfort her whims and recall her fancies from Earth.\r\nShe saw the lawns whereon Time had idled for centuries, withering not\r\none bloom of all the boundary of flowers; and the new light coming upon\r\nthe lawns she loved, through the heavy colour of Elfland, gave them a\r\nbeauty that they had never known until dawn made this boundless journey\r\nto meet the enchanted twilight; and all the while there glowed and\r\nflashed and glittered those palace spires of which only song may tell.\r\nFrom that bewildering beauty he turned his eyes away, and looked in his\r\ndaughter\'s face to see the wonder with which she would welcome her\r\nglorious home as her fancies came back from the fields of age and death,\r\nwhither--alas--they had wandered. And though her eyes were turned to the\r\nElfin Mountains, whose mystery and whose blue they strangely matched,\r\nyet as the Elf King looked in those eyes for which alone he had lured\r\nthe dawn so far from its natural courses, he saw in their magical deeps\r\na thought of Earth! A thought of Earth, though he had lifted his arm and\r\nmade a mystical sign with all his might to bring a wonder to Elfland\r\nthat should content her with home. And all his dominions had exulted in\r\nthis, and the watchers on awful crags had blown strange calls, and\r\nmonster and insect and bird and flower had rejoiced with a new joy, and\r\nthere in the centre of Elfland his daughter thought of Earth.\r\n\r\nHad he shown her any wonder but dawn he might have lured home that\r\nfancy, but in bringing this exotic beauty to Elfland to blend with its\r\nancient wonders, he awoke memories of morning coming over fields that he\r\nknew not, and Lirazel played in fancy in fields once more with Orion,\r\nwhere grew the unenchanted earthly flowers amongst the English grasses.\r\n\r\n"Is it not enough?" he said in his strange rich magical voice, and\r\npointed across his wide lands with the fingers that summoned wonder.\r\n\r\nShe sighed: it was not enough.\r\n\r\nAnd sorrow came upon that enchanted King: he had only his daughter, and\r\nshe sighed for Earth. There had been once a queen that had reigned with\r\nhim over Elfland; but she was mortal, and being mortal died. For she\r\nwould often stray to the hills of Earth to see the may again, or to see\r\nthe beechwoods in Autumn; and though she stayed but a day when she came\r\nto the fields we know, and was back in the palace beyond the twilight\r\nbefore our sun had set, yet Time found her whenever she came; and so she\r\nwore away, and soon she died in Elfland; for she was only a mortal. And\r\nwondering elves had buried her, as one buries the daughters of men. And\r\nnow the King was all alone with his daughter, and she had just sighed\r\nfor Earth. Sorrow was on him, but out of the dark of that sorrow arose,\r\nas often with men, and went up singing out of his mourning mind, an\r\ninspiration gleaming with laughter and joy. He stood up then and raised\r\nup both his arms and his inspiration broke over Elfland in music. And\r\nwith the tide of that music there went like the strength of the sea an\r\nimpulse to rise and dance which none in Elfland resisted. Gravely he\r\nwaved his arms and the music floated from them; and all that stalked\r\nthrough the forest and all that crept upon leaves, all that leaped among\r\ncraggy heights or browsed upon acres of lilies, all things in all manner\r\nof places, yea the sentinel guarding his presence, the lonely\r\nmountain-watchers and the trolls as they scampered towards Earth, all\r\ndanced to a tune that was made of the spirit of Spring, arrived on an\r\nearthly morning amongst happy herds of goats.\r\n\r\nAnd the trolls were very near to the frontier now, their faces already\r\npuckered to laugh at the ways of men; they were hurrying with all the\r\neagerness of small vain things to be over the twilight that lies between\r\nElfland and Earth: now they went forward no longer, but only glided in\r\ncircles and intricate spirals, dancing some such dance as the gnats in\r\nSummer evenings dance over the fields we know. And grave monsters of\r\nfable in deeps of the ferny forest danced minuets that witches had made\r\nof their whims and their laughter, long ago long ago in their youth\r\nbefore cities had come to the world. And the trees of the forest heavily\r\nlifted slow roots out of the ground and swayed upon them uncouthly and\r\nthen danced as on monstrous claws, and the insects danced on the huge\r\nwaving leaves. And in the dark of long caverns weird things in\r\nenchanted seclusion rose out of their age-long sleep and danced in the\r\ndamp.\r\n\r\nAnd beside the wizard King stood, swaying slightly to the rhythm that\r\nhad set dancing all magical things, the Princess Lirazel with that faint\r\ngleam on her face that shone from a hidden smile; for she secretly\r\nsmiled forever at the power of her great beauty. And all in a sudden\r\nmoment the Elf King raised one hand higher and held it high and stilled\r\nall that danced in Elfland, and gripped by a sudden awe all magical\r\nthings, and sent over Elfland a melody all made of notes he had caught\r\nfrom wandering inspirations that sing and stray through limpid blue\r\nbeyond our earthly coasts: and all the land lay deep in the magic of\r\nthat strange music. And the wild things that Earth has guessed at and\r\nthe things hidden even from legend were moved to sing age-old songs that\r\ntheir memories had forgotten. And fabulous things of the air were lured\r\ndownwards out of great heights. And emotions unknown and unthought of\r\ntroubled the calm of Elfland. The flood of music beat with wonderful\r\nwaves against the slopes of the grave blue Elfin Mountains, till their\r\nprecipices uttered strange bronze-like echoes. On Earth no noise was\r\nheard of music or echo: not a note came through the narrow border of\r\ntwilight, not a sound, not a murmur. Elsewhere those notes ascended, and\r\npassed like rare strange moths through all the fields of Heaven, and\r\nhummed like untraceable memories about the souls of the blessed; and the\r\nangels heard that music but were forbidden to envy it. And though it\r\ncame not to Earth, and though never our fields have heard the music of\r\nElfland, yet there were then as there have been in every age, lest\r\ndespair should overtake the peoples of Earth, those that make songs for\r\nthe need of our grief and our laughter: and even they heard never a note\r\nfrom Elfland across the border of twilight that kills their sound, but\r\nthey felt in their minds the dance of those magical notes, and wrote\r\nthem down and earthly instruments played them; then and never till then\r\nhave we heard the music of Elfland.\r\n\r\nFor a while the Elf King held all things that owed him allegiance, and\r\nall their desires and wonders and fears and dreams, floating drowsy on\r\ntides of music that was made of no sounds of Earth, but rather of that\r\ndim substance in which the planets swim, with many another marvel that\r\nonly magic knows. And then as all Elfland was drinking the music in, as\r\nour Earth drinks in soft rain, he turned again to his daughter with that\r\nin his eyes that said "What land is so fair as ours?" And she turned\r\ntowards him to say "Here is my home forever." Her lips were parted to\r\nsay it and love was shining in the blue of her elfin eyes; she was\r\nstretching her fair hands out towards her father; when they heard the\r\nsound of the horn of a tired hunter, wearily blowing by the border of\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n                         _The Horn of Alveric_\r\n\r\n\r\nNorthward to lonely lands through wearying years Alveric wandered, where\r\nwindy fragments of his grey gaunt tent added a gloom to chill evenings.\r\nAnd the folk upon lonely farms, as they lit the lights in their houses,\r\nand the ricks began to darken against the pale green of the sky, would\r\nsometimes hear the rap of the mallets of Niv and Zend coming clear\r\nthrough the hush from the land that no others trod. And their children\r\npeering from casements to see if a star was come would see perhaps the\r\nqueer grey shape of that tent flapping its tatters above the last of the\r\nhedgerows, where a moment before was only the grey of the gloaming. On\r\nthe next morning there would be guesses and wonderings, and the joy and\r\nfear of the children, and the tales that their elders told them, and the\r\nexplorations by stealth to the edge of the fields of men, shy peerings\r\nthrough dim green gaps in the last of the hedgerows (though to look\r\ntoward the East was forbidden), and rumours and expectations; and all\r\nthese things were blended together by this wonder that came from the\r\nEast, and so passed into legend, which lived for many a year beyond\r\nthat morning; but Alveric and his tent would be gone.\r\n\r\nSo day by day and season after season that company wandered on, the\r\nlonely mateless man, the moonstruck lad and the madman, and that old\r\ngrey tent with its long twisted pole. And all the stars became known to\r\nthem, and all the four winds familiar, and rain and mist and hail, but\r\nthe flow of yellow windows all warm and welcome at night they knew only\r\nto say farewell to: with the earliest light in the first chill of dawn\r\nAlveric would awake from impatient dreams, and Niv would arise shouting,\r\nand away they would go upon their crazed crusade before any sign of\r\nawakening appeared on the quiet dim gables. And every morning Niv\r\nprophesied that they would surely find Elfland; and the days wore away\r\nand the years.\r\n\r\nThyl had long left them; Thyl who prophesied victory to them in burning\r\nsong, whose inspirations cheered Alveric on coldest nights and led him\r\nthrough rockiest ways, Thyl sang one evening suddenly songs of some\r\nyoung girl\'s hair, Thyl who should have led their wanderings. And then\r\none day in the gloaming, a blackbird singing, the may in bloom for\r\nmiles, he turned for the houses of men, and married the maiden and was\r\none no more with any band of wanderers.\r\n\r\nThe horses were dead; Niv and Zend carried all they had on the pole.\r\nMany years had gone. One Autumn morning Alveric left the camp to go to\r\nthe houses of men. Niv and Zend eyed each other. Why should Alveric seek\r\nto ask the way of others? For somehow or other their mad minds knew his\r\npurpose more swiftly than sane intuitions. Had he not Niv\'s prophecies\r\nto guide him, and the things that Zend had been told on oath by the full\r\nmoon?\r\n\r\nAlveric came to the houses of men, and of the folk he questioned few\r\nwould speak at all of things that lay to the East, and if he spoke of\r\nthe lands through which he had wandered for years they gave as little\r\nheed as if he were telling them that he had pitched his tent on the\r\ncoloured layers of air that glowed and drifted and darkened in the low\r\nsky over the sunset. And the few that answered him said one thing only:\r\nthat only the wizards knew.\r\n\r\nWhen he had learned this Alveric went back from the fields and hedgerows\r\nand came again to his old grey tent in the lands of which none thought;\r\nand Niv and Zend sat there silent, eying him sideways, for they knew he\r\nmistrusted madness and things said by the moon. And next day when they\r\nmoved their camp in the chill of dawn Niv led the way without shouting.\r\n\r\nThey had not gone for many more weeks upon their curious journey when\r\nAlveric met one morning, at the edge of the fields men tended, one\r\nfilling his bucket at a well, whose thin high conical hat and mystical\r\nair proclaimed him surely a wizard. "Master," said Alveric, "of those\r\narts men dread, I have a question that I would ask of the future."\r\n\r\nAnd the wizard turned from his bucket to look at Alveric with doubtful\r\neyes, for the traveller\'s tattered figure seemed scarce to promise such\r\nfees as are given by those that justly question the future. And, such as\r\nthose fees are, the wizard named them. And Alveric\'s wallet held that\r\nwhich banished the doubts of the wizard. So that he pointed to where the\r\ntip of his tower peered over a cluster of myrtles, and prayed Alveric to\r\ncome to his door when the evening star should appear; and in that\r\npropitious hour he would make the future clear to him.\r\n\r\nAnd again Niv and Zend knew well that their leader followed after dreams\r\nand mysteries that came not from madness nor from the moon. And he left\r\nthem sitting still and saying nothing, but with minds full of fierce\r\nvisions.\r\n\r\nThrough pale air waiting for the evening star Alveric walked over the\r\nfields men tended, and came to the dark oak door of the wizard\'s tower\r\nwhich myrtles brushed against with every breeze. A young apprentice in\r\nwizardry opened the door and, by ancient wooden steps that the rats knew\r\nbetter than men, led Alveric to the wizard\'s upper room.\r\n\r\nThe wizard had on a silken cloak of black, which he held to be due to\r\nthe future; without it he would not question the years to be. And when\r\nthe young apprentice had gone away he moved to a volume he had on a high\r\ndesk, and turned from the volume to Alveric to ask what he sought of the\r\nfuture. And Alveric asked him how he should come to Elfland. Then the\r\nwizard opened the great book\'s darkened cover and turned the pages\r\ntherein, and for a long while all the pages he turned were blank, but\r\nfurther on in the book much writing appeared, although of no kind that\r\nAlveric had ever seen. And the wizard explained that such books as these\r\ntold of all things; but that he, being only concerned with the years to\r\nbe, had no need to read of the past, and had therefore acquired a book\r\nthat told of the future only; though he might have had more than this\r\nfrom the College of Wizardry, had he cared to study the follies already\r\ncommitted by man.\r\n\r\nThen he read for a while in his book, and Alveric heard the rats\r\nreturning softly to the streets and houses that they had made in the\r\nstairs. And then the wizard found what he sought of the future, and told\r\nAlveric that it was written in his book how he never should come to\r\nElfland while he carried a magical sword.\r\n\r\nWhen Alveric heard this he paid the wizard\'s fees and went away doleful.\r\nFor he knew the perils of Elfland, which no common sabre forged on the\r\nanvils of men could ever avail to parry. He did not know that the magic\r\nthat was in his sword left a flavour or taste on the air like that of\r\nlightning, which passed through the border of twilight and spread over\r\nElfland, nor knew that the Elf King learned of his presence thus and\r\ndrew his frontier away from him, so that Alveric should trouble his\r\nrealm no more; but he believed what the wizard had read to him out of\r\nhis book, and so went doleful away. And, leaving the stairs of oak to\r\ntime and the rats, he passed out of the grove of myrtles and over the\r\nfields of men, and came again to that melancholy spot where his grey\r\ntent brooded mournfully in the wilderness, dull and silent as Niv and\r\nZend sitting beside it. And after that they turned and wandered\r\nsouthwards, for all journeys now seemed equally hopeless to Alveric, who\r\nwould not give up his sword to meet magical perils without magical aid;\r\nand Niv and Zend obeyed him silently, no longer guiding him with raving\r\nprophesies or with things said by the moon, for they knew he had taken\r\ncounsel with another.\r\n\r\nBy weary ways with lonely wanderings they came far to the South, and\r\nnever the border of Elfland appeared with its heavy layers of twilight;\r\nyet Alveric would never give up his sword, for well he guessed that\r\nElfland dreaded its magic, and had poor hope of recapturing Lirazel with\r\nany blade that was dreadful only to men. And after a while Niv\r\nprophesied again, and Zend would come late on nights of the full moon to\r\nwake Alveric with his tales. And for all the mystery that was in Zend\r\nwhen he spoke, and for all the exultation of Niv when he prophesied,\r\nAlveric knew by now that the tales and the prophecies were empty and\r\nvain and that neither of these would ever bring him to Elfland. With\r\nthis mournful knowledge in a desolate land he still struck camp at dawn,\r\nstill marched, still sought for the frontier, and so the months went by.\r\n\r\nAnd one day where the edge of Earth was a wild untended heath, running\r\ndown to the rocky waste in which Alveric had camped, he saw at evening a\r\nwoman in the hat and cloak of a witch sweeping the heath with a broom.\r\nAnd each stroke as she swept the heath was away from the fields we know,\r\naway to the rocky waste, eastwards towards Elfland. Big gusts of black\r\ndried earth and puffs of sand were blowing towards Alveric from every\r\npowerful stroke. He walked towards her from his sorry encampment and\r\nstood near and watched her sweeping; but still she laboured at her\r\nvigorous work, striding away behind dust from the fields we know, and\r\nsweeping as she strode. And after a while she lifted her face as she\r\nswept and looked at Alveric, and he saw that it was the witch\r\nZiroonderel. After all these years he saw that witch again, and she saw\r\nbeneath the flapping rags of his cloak that sword that she had made for\r\nhim once on her hill. Its scabbard of leather could not hide from the\r\nwitch that it was that very sword, for she knew the flavour of magic\r\nthat rose from it faintly and floated wide through the evening.\r\n\r\n"Mother Witch!" said Alveric.\r\n\r\nAnd she curtsied low to him, magical though she was and aged by the\r\npassing of years that had been before Alveric\'s father, and though many\r\nin Erl had forgotten their lord by now; yet she had not forgotten.\r\n\r\nHe asked her what she was doing there, on the heath with her broom in\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\n"Sweeping the world," she said.\r\n\r\nAnd Alveric wondered what rejected things she was sweeping away from the\r\nworld, with grey dust mournfully turning over and over as it drifted\r\nacross our fields, going slowly into the darkness that was gathering\r\nbeyond our coasts.\r\n\r\n"Why are you sweeping the world, Mother Witch?" he said.\r\n\r\n"There\'s things in the world that ought not to be here," said she.\r\n\r\nHe looked wistfully then at the rolling grey clouds from her broom that\r\nwere all drifting towards Elfland.\r\n\r\n"Mother Witch," he said, "can I go too? I have looked for twelve years\r\nfor Elfland, and have not found a glimpse of the Elfin Mountains."\r\n\r\nAnd the old witch looked kindly at him, and then she glanced at his\r\nsword.\r\n\r\n"He\'s afraid of my magic," she said; and thought or mystery dawned in\r\nher eyes as she spoke.\r\n\r\n"Who?" said Alveric.\r\n\r\nAnd Ziroonderel lowered her eyes.\r\n\r\n"The King," she said.\r\n\r\nAnd then she told him how that enchanted monarch would draw away from\r\nwhatever had worsted him once, and with him draw all that he had, never\r\nsupporting the presence of any magic that was the equal of his.\r\n\r\nAnd Alveric could not believe that such a king cared so much for the\r\nmagic he had in his old black scabbard.\r\n\r\n"It is his way," she said.\r\n\r\nAnd then he would not believe that he had waved away Elfland.\r\n\r\n"He has the power," said she.\r\n\r\nAnd still Alveric would face this terrible king and all the powers he\r\nhad; but wizard and witch had warned him that he could not go with his\r\nsword, and how go unarmed through the grizzly wood against the palace of\r\nwonder? For to go there with any sword from the anvils of men was but to\r\ngo unarmed.\r\n\r\n"Mother Witch," he cried. "May I come no more to Elfland?"\r\n\r\nAnd the longing and grief in his voice touched the witch\'s heart and\r\nmoved it to magical pity.\r\n\r\n"You shall go," she said.\r\n\r\nHe stood there half despair in the mournful evening, half dreams of\r\nLirazel. While the witch from under her cloak drew forth a small false\r\nweight which once she had taken away from a seller of bread.\r\n\r\n"Draw this along the edge of your sword," she said, "all the way from\r\nhilt to point, and it will disenchant the blade, and the King will never\r\nknow what sword is there."\r\n\r\n"Will it still fight for me?" said Alveric.\r\n\r\n"No," said the witch. "But once you are over the frontier take this\r\nscript and wipe the blade with it on every spot that the false weight\r\nhas touched." And she fumbled under her cloak again and drew forth a\r\npoem on parchment. "It will enchant it again," she said.\r\n\r\nAnd Alveric took the weight and the written thing.\r\n\r\n"Let not the two touch," warned the witch.\r\n\r\nAnd Alveric set them apart.\r\n\r\n"Once over the frontier," she said, "and he may move Elfland where he\r\nwill, but you and the sword will be within his borders."\r\n\r\n"Mother Witch," said Alveric, "will he be wroth with you if I do this?"\r\n\r\n"Wroth!" said Ziroonderel. "Wroth? He will rage with a most exceeding\r\nfury, beyond the power of tigers."\r\n\r\n"I would not bring that on you, Mother Witch," said Alveric.\r\n\r\n"Ha!" said Ziroonderel. "What care I?"\r\n\r\nNight was advancing now, and the moor and the air growing black like the\r\nwitch\'s cloak. She was laughing now and merging into the darkness. And\r\nsoon the night was all blackness and laughter; but he could see no\r\nwitch.\r\n\r\nThen Alveric made his way back to his rocky camp by the light of its\r\nlonely fire.\r\n\r\nAnd as soon as morning appeared on the desolation, and all the useless\r\nrocks began to glow, he took the false weight and softly rubbed it along\r\nboth sides of his sword until all its magical edge was disenchanted. And\r\nhe did this in his tent while his followers slept, for he would not let\r\nthem know that he sought for help that came not from the ravings of Niv,\r\nnor from any sayings that Zend had had from the moon.\r\n\r\nYet the troubled sleep of madness is not so deep that Niv did not watch\r\nhim out of one wild sly eye when he heard the false weight softly\r\nrasping the sword.\r\n\r\nAnd when this was secretly done and secretly watched, Alveric called to\r\nhis two men, and they came and folded up his tattered tent, and took the\r\nlong pole and hung their sorry belongings upon it; and on went Alveric\r\nalong the edge of the fields we know, impatient to come at last to the\r\nland that so long eluded him. And Niv and Zend came behind with the pole\r\nbetween them, with bundles swinging from it and tatters flying.\r\n\r\nThey moved inland a little towards the houses of men to purchase the\r\nfood they needed; and this they bought in the afternoon from a farmer\r\nwho dwelt in a lonely house, so near to the very edge of the fields we\r\nknow that it must have been the last house in the visible world. And\r\nhere they bought bread and oatmeal, and cheese and a cured ham, and\r\nother such things, and put them in sacks and slung them over their pole;\r\nthen they left the farmer and turned away from his fields and from all\r\nthe fields of men. And as evening fell they saw just over a hedge,\r\nlighting up the land with a soft strange glow that they knew to be not\r\nof this Earth, that barrier of twilight that is the frontier of Elfland.\r\n\r\n"Lirazel!" shouted Alveric, and drew his sword and strode into the\r\ntwilight. And behind him went Niv and Zend, with all their suspicions\r\nflaming now into jealousy of inspirations or magic that were not theirs.\r\n\r\nOnce he called Lirazel; then, little trusting his voice in that wide\r\nweird land, he lifted his hunter\'s horn that hung by his side on a\r\nstrap, he lifted it to his lips and sounded a call weary with so much\r\nwandering. He was standing within the edge of the boundary; the horn\r\nshone in the light of Elfland.\r\n\r\nThen Niv and Zend dropped their pole in that unearthly twilight, where\r\nit lay like the wreckage of some uncharted sea, and suddenly seized\r\ntheir master.\r\n\r\n"A land of dreams!" said Niv. "Have I not dreams enough?"\r\n\r\n"There is no moon there!" cried Zend.\r\n\r\nAlveric struck Zend on the shoulder with his sword, but the sword was\r\ndisenchanted and blunt and only harmed him slightly. Then the two seized\r\nthe sword and dragged Alveric back. And the strength of the madman was\r\nbeyond what one could believe. They dragged him back again to the fields\r\nwe know, where they two were strange and were jealous of other\r\nstrangeness, and led him far from the sight of the pale-blue mountains.\r\nHe had not entered Elfland.\r\n\r\nBut his horn had passed the boundary\'s edge and troubled the air of\r\nElfland, uttering across its dreamy calm one long sad earthly note: it\r\nwas the horn that Lirazel heard as she spoke with her father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n                        _The Return of Lurulu_\r\n\r\n\r\nOver hamlet and Castle of Erl, and through every nook and crevice of it,\r\nSpring passed; a mild benediction that blessed the very air and sought\r\nout all living things; not missing even the tiny plants that had their\r\ndwelling in most secluded places, under eaves, in the cracks of old\r\nbarrels, or along the lines of mortar that held ancient rows of stones.\r\nAnd in this season Orion hunted no unicorns; not that he knew in what\r\nseason the unicorns bred in Elfland, where time is not as here; but\r\nbecause of a feeling he had from all his earthly forefathers against\r\nhunting any creature in this season of song and flowers. So he tended\r\nhis hounds and often watched the hills, expecting on any day the return\r\nof Lurulu.\r\n\r\nAnd Spring passed by and the Summer flowers grew, and still there was no\r\nsign of the troll returning, for time moves through the dells of Elfland\r\nas over no field of man. And long Orion watched through fading evenings\r\ntill the line of the hills was black, yet never saw the small round\r\nheads of trolls bobbing across the downs.\r\n\r\nAnd the long autumnal winds came sighing out of cold lands, and found\r\nOrion still watching for Lurulu; and the mist and the turning leaves\r\nspoke to his heart of hunting. And the hounds were whining for the open\r\nspaces and the line of scent like a mysterious path crossing the wide\r\nworld, but Orion would hunt nothing less than unicorns, and waited yet\r\nfor his trolls.\r\n\r\nAnd one of these earthly days, with a menace of frost in the air and a\r\nscarlet sunset, Lurulu\'s talk to the trolls in the wood being finished,\r\nand their scamper swifter than hares having brought them soon to the\r\nfrontier, those in our fields who looked (as they seldom did) towards\r\nthat mysterious border where Earth ended might have seen the unwonted\r\nshapes of the nimble trolls coming all grey through the evening. They\r\ncame dropping, troll after troll, from the soaring leaps they took high\r\nthrough the boundary of twilight; and, landing thus unceremoniously in\r\nour fields, came capering, somersaulting and running, with gusts of\r\nimpudent laughter, as though this were a proper manner in which to\r\napproach by no means the least of the planets.\r\n\r\nThey rustled by the small houses like the wind passing through straw,\r\nand none that heard the light rushing sound of their passing knew how\r\noutlandish they were, except the dogs, whose work it is to watch, and\r\nwho know of all things that pass, their degree of remoteness to man. At\r\ngipsies, tramps, and all that go without houses, dogs bark whenever they\r\npass; at the wild things of the woods they bark with greater abhorrence,\r\nknowing well the rebellious contempt in which they hold man; at the fox,\r\nfor his touch of mystery and his far wanderings, they bark more\r\nfuriously: but to-night the barking of dogs was beyond all abhorrence\r\nand fury; many a farmer this night believed that his dog was choking.\r\n\r\nAnd passing over these fields, staying not to laugh at the clumsy scared\r\nrunning of sheep, for they kept their laughter for man, they came soon\r\nto the downs above Erl; and there below them was night and the smoke of\r\nmen, all grey together. And not knowing from what slight causes the\r\nsmoke arose, here from a woman boiling a kettle of water, or there\r\nbecause one dried the frock of a child, or that a few old men might warm\r\ntheir hands in the evening, the trolls forbore to laugh as they had\r\nplanned to do as soon as they should meet with the things of man.\r\nPerhaps even they, whose gravest thoughts were just under the surface of\r\nlaughter, even they were a little awed by the strangeness and nearness\r\nof man sleeping there in his hamlet with all his smoke about him. Though\r\nawe in these light minds rested no longer than does the squirrel on the\r\nthin extremest twigs.\r\n\r\nIn a while they lifted their eyes up from the valley, and there was the\r\nwestern sky still shining above the last of the gloaming, a little strip\r\nof colour and dying light, so lovely that they believed that another\r\nelfland lay the other side of the valley, two dim diaphonous magical\r\nelfin lands hemming in this valley and few fields of men close upon\r\neither side. And, sitting there on the hillside peering westward, the\r\nnext thing they saw was a star: it was Venus low in the West brimming\r\nwith blueness. And they all bowed their heads many times to this\r\npale-blue beautiful stranger; for though politeness was rare with them\r\nthey saw that the Evening Star was nothing of Earth and no affair of\r\nman\'s, and believed it came out of that elfland they did not know on the\r\nwestern side of the world. And more and more stars appeared, till the\r\ntrolls were frightened, for they knew nothing of these glittering\r\nwanderers that could steal out of the darkness and shine: at first they\r\nsaid "There are more trolls than stars," and were comforted, for they\r\ntrusted greatly in numbers. Then there were soon more stars than trolls;\r\nand the trolls were ill at ease as they sat in the dark underneath all\r\nthat multitude. But presently they forgot the fancy that troubled them,\r\nfor no thought remained with them long. They turned their light\r\nattention instead to the yellow lights that glowed here and there on the\r\nhither side of the greyness, where a few of the houses of men stood warm\r\nand snug near the trolls. A beetle went by, and they hushed their\r\nchatter to hear what he would say; but he droned by, going home, and\r\nthey did not know his language. A dog far off was ceaselessly crying\r\nout, and filling all the still night with a note of warning. And the\r\ntrolls were angry at the sound of his voice, for they felt that he\r\ninterfered between them and man. Then a soft whiteness came out of the\r\nnight and lit on the branch of a tree, and bowed its head to the left\r\nand looked at the trolls, and then bowed over to the right and looked at\r\nthem again from there, and then back to the left again for it was not\r\nyet sure about them. "An owl," said Lurulu; and many besides Lurulu had\r\nseen his kind before, for he flies much along the edge of Elfland. Soon\r\nhe was gone and they heard him hunting across the hills and the hollows;\r\nand then no sound was left but the voices of men, or the shrill shouts\r\nof children, and the bay of the dog that warned men against the trolls.\r\n"A sensible fellow," they said of the owl, for they liked the sound of\r\nhis voice; but the voices of men and their dog sounded confused and\r\ntiresome.\r\n\r\nThey saw sometimes the lights of late wayfarers crossing the downs\r\ntowards Erl, or heard men that cheered themselves in the lonely night by\r\nsinging, instead of by lantern\'s light. And all the while the Evening\r\nStar grew bigger, and great trees grew blacker and blacker.\r\n\r\nThen from underneath the smoke and the mist of the stream there boomed\r\nall of a sudden the brazen bell of the Freer out of deep night in the\r\nvalley. Night and the slopes of Erl and the dark downs echoed with it;\r\nand the echoes rode up to the trolls and seemed to challenge them, with\r\nall accursed things and wandering spirits and bodies unblessed of the\r\nFreer.\r\n\r\nAnd the solemn sound of those echoes going alone through the night from\r\nevery heavy swing of the holy bell cheered that band of trolls among all\r\nthe strangeness of Earth, for whatever is solemn always moves trolls to\r\nlevity. They turned merrier now and tittered among themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd while they still watched all that host of stars, wondering if they\r\nwere friendly, the sky grew steely blue and the eastern stars dwindled,\r\nand the mist and the smoke of men turned white, and a radiance touched\r\nthe further edge of the valley; and the moon came up over the downs\r\nbehind the trolls. Then voices sang from the holy place of the Freer,\r\nchaunting moon matins; which it was their wont to sing on nights of the\r\nfull moon while the moon was yet low. And this rite they named\r\nmoon\'s-morning. The bell had ceased, chance voices spoke no more, they\r\nhad hushed their dog in the valley and silenced his warning, and lonely\r\nand grave and solemn that people\'s song floated up from before the\r\ncandles in their small square sacred place, built of grey stone by men\r\nthat were dead for ages and ages; all solemn the song welled up in the\r\ntime of the moon\'s rising, grave as the night, mysterious as the full\r\nmoon, and fraught with a meaning that was far beyond the highest\r\nthoughts of the trolls. Then the trolls leaped up with one accord from\r\nthe frosted grass of the downs and all poured down the valley to laugh\r\nat the ways of men, to mock at their sacred things and to dare their\r\nsinging with levity.\r\n\r\nMany a rabbit rose up and fled from their onrush, and thrills of\r\nlaughter arose from the trolls at their fear. A meteor flashed\r\nwestwards, racing after the sun; either as a portent to warn the hamlet\r\nof Erl that folk from beyond Earth\'s borders approached them now, or\r\nelse in fulfilment of some natural law. To the trolls it seemed that one\r\nof the proud stars fell, and they rejoiced with elvish levity.\r\n\r\nThus they came giggling through the night, and ran down the street of\r\nthe village, unseen as any wild creature that roams late through the\r\ndarkness; and Lurulu led them to the pigeon-loft, and they all poured\r\nclambering in. Some rumour arose in the village that a fox had jumped\r\ninto the pigeon-loft, but it ceased almost as soon as the pigeons\r\nreturned to their homes, and the folk of Erl had no more hint till the\r\nmorning that something had entered their village from beyond the borders\r\nof Earth.\r\n\r\nIn a brown mass thicker than young pigs are along the edge of a trough\r\nthe trolls encumbered the floor of the pigeons\' home. And time went over\r\nthem as over all earthly things. And well they knew, though tiny was\r\ntheir intelligence, that by crossing the border of twilight they\r\nincurred the wasting of time; for nothing dwells by the brink of any\r\ndanger and lives ignorant of its menace: as conies in rocky altitudes\r\nknow the peril of the sheer cliff, so they that dwell near Earth\'s\r\nborder knew well the danger of time. And yet they came. The wonder and\r\nlure of Earth had been overstrong for them. Does not many a young man\r\nsquander youth as they squandered immortality?\r\n\r\nAnd Lurulu showed them how to hold off time for a while, which otherwise\r\nwould make them older and older each moment and whirl them on with\r\nEarth\'s restlessness all night long. Then he curled up his knees and\r\nshut his eyes and lay still. This, he told them, was sleep; and,\r\ncautioning them to continue to breathe, though being still in other\r\nrespects, he then slept in earnest: and after some vain attempts the\r\nbrown trolls did the same.\r\n\r\nWhen sunrise came, awaking all earthly things, long rays came through\r\nthe thirty little windows and awoke both birds and trolls. And the mass\r\nof trolls went to the windows to look at Earth, and the pigeons\r\nfluttered to rafters and jerked sidelong looks at the trolls. And there\r\nthat heap of trolls would have stayed, crowded high on each other\'s\r\nshoulders, blocking the windows while they studied the variety and\r\nrestlessness of Earth, finding them equal to the strangest fables that\r\nwayfarers had brought to them out of our fields; and, though Lurulu\r\noften reminded them, they had forgotten the haughty white unicorns that\r\nthey were to hunt with dogs.\r\n\r\nBut Lurulu after a while led them down from the loft and brought them to\r\nthe kennels. And they climbed up the high palings and peered over the\r\ntop at the hounds.\r\n\r\nWhen the hounds saw those strange heads peering over the palings they\r\nmade a great uproar. And presently folk came to see what troubled the\r\nhounds. And when they saw that mass of trolls all round the top of the\r\npalings they said to each other, and so said all that heard of it:\r\n"There is magic in Erl now."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n                    _A Chapter on Unicorn-Hunting_\r\n\r\n\r\nNone in Erl was so busy but that he came that morning to see the magic\r\nthat was newly come out of Elfland, and to compare the trolls with all\r\nthat the neighbours said of them. And the folk of Erl gazed much at the\r\ntrolls and the trolls at the folk of Erl, and there was great merriment;\r\nfor, as often happens with minds of unequal weight, each laughed at the\r\nother. And the villagers found the impudent ways of the bare brown\r\nnimble trolls no funnier, no more meet for derision, than the trolls\r\nfound the grave high hats, the curious clothes, and the solemn air of\r\nthe villagers.\r\n\r\nAnd Orion soon came too, and the folk of the village doffed their long\r\nthin hats; and, though the trolls would have laughed at him also, Lurulu\r\nhad found his whip, and by means of it made the mob of his impudent\r\nbrethren give that salutation that is given in Elfland to those of its\r\nroyal line.\r\n\r\nWhen noonday came, which was the hour of dinner, and the folk turned\r\nfrom the kennels, they went back to their houses all praising the magic\r\nthat was come at last to Erl.\r\n\r\nDuring the days that followed Orion\'s hounds learned that it was vain to\r\nchase a troll and unwise to snarl at one; for, apart from their elvish\r\nspeed, the trolls were able to leap into the air far over the heads of\r\nthe hounds, and when each had been given a whip they could repay\r\nsnarling with an aim that none on Earth was able to equal, except those\r\nwhose sires had carried a whip with hounds for generations.\r\n\r\nAnd one morning Orion came to the pigeon-loft and called to Lurulu\r\nearly, and he brought out the trolls and they went to the kennels and\r\nOrion opened the doors, and he led them all away eastwards over the\r\ndowns. The hounds moved all together and the trolls with their whips ran\r\nbeside them, like a flock of sheep surrounded by numbers of collies.\r\nThey were away to the border of Elfland to wait for the unicorns where\r\nthey come through the twilight to eat the earthly grasses at evening.\r\nAnd as our evening began to mellow the fields we know, they were come to\r\nthe opal border that shut those fields from Elfland. And there they\r\nlurked as Earth\'s darkness grew, and waited for the great unicorns. Each\r\nhound had its troll beside it with the troll\'s right hand along its\r\nshoulder or neck, soothing it, calming it, and holding it still, while\r\nthe left hand held the whip: the strange group lingered there\r\nmotionless, and darkened there with the evening. And when Earth was as\r\ndim and quiet as the unicorns desired the great creatures came softly\r\nthrough, and were far into Earth before any troll would allow his hound\r\nto move. Thus when Orion gave the signal they easily cut one off from\r\nits elfin home and hunted it snorting over those fields that are the\r\nportion of men. And night came down on the proud beast\'s magical gallop,\r\nand the hounds intoxicate with that marvellous scent, and the leaping\r\nsoaring trolls.\r\n\r\nAnd, when jackdaws on the highest towers of Erl saw the rim of the sun\r\nall red above frosted fields, Orion came back from the downs with his\r\nhounds and his trolls, carrying as fine a head as a unicorn-hunter could\r\nwish. The hounds weary but glad were soon curled up in their kennels,\r\nand Orion in his bed; while the trolls in their pigeon-loft began to\r\nfeel, as none but Lurulu had felt ever before, the weight and the\r\nweariness of the passing of time.\r\n\r\nAll day Orion slept and all his hounds, none of them caring how it slept\r\nor why; while the trolls slept anxiously, falling asleep as fast as ever\r\nthey could, in the hope of escaping some of the fury of time, which they\r\nfeared had begun to attack them. And that evening while still they\r\nslept, hounds, trolls and Orion, there met again in the forge of Narl\r\nthe parliament of Erl.\r\n\r\nFrom the forge to the inner room came the twelve old men, rubbing their\r\nhands and smiling, ruddy with health and the keen North wind and the\r\ncheerfulness of their forebodings; for they were well content at last\r\nthat their lord was surely magic, and foresaw great doings in Erl.\r\n\r\n"Folklings," said Narl to them all, naming them thus after an ancient\r\nwont, "is it not well with us and our valley at last? See how it is as\r\nwe planned so long ago. For our lord is a magic lord as we all desired,\r\nand magical things have sought him from over there, and they all obey\r\nhis hests."\r\n\r\n"It is so," said all but Gazic, a vendor of beeves.\r\n\r\nLittle and old and out-of-the-way was Erl, secluded in its deep valley,\r\nunnoticed in history; and the twelve men loved the place and would have\r\nit famous. And now they rejoiced as they heard the words of Narl, "What\r\nother village," he said, "has traffic with over there?"\r\n\r\nAnd Gazic, though he rejoiced with the rest, rose up in a pause of their\r\ngladness. "Many strange things," he said, "have entered our village,\r\ncoming from over there. And it may be that human folk are best, and the\r\nways of the fields we know."\r\n\r\nOth scorned him, and Threl. "Magic is best," said all.\r\n\r\nAnd Gazic was silent again, and raised his voice no more against the\r\nmany; and the mead went round, and all spoke of the fame of Erl; and\r\nGazic forgot his mood and the fear that was in it.\r\n\r\nFar into the night they rejoiced, quaffing the mead, and by its homely\r\naid gazing into the years of the future, so far as that may be done by\r\nthe eyes of men. Yet all their rejoicing was hushed and their voices\r\nlow, lest the ears of the Freer should hear them; for their gladness\r\ncame to them from lands that lay beyond thought of salvation, and they\r\nhad set their trust in magic, against which, as well they knew, boomed\r\nevery note that rang from the bell of the Freer whenever it tolled at\r\nevening. And they parted late, praising magic in no loud tones, and went\r\nsecretly back to their houses, for they feared the curse that the Freer\r\nhad called down upon unicorns, and knew not if their own names might\r\nbecome involved in one of the curses called upon magical things.\r\n\r\nAll the next day Orion rested his hounds, and the trolls and the people\r\nof Erl gazed at each other. But on the day that followed Orion took his\r\nsword and gathered his band of trolls and his pack of hounds, and all\r\nwere away once more far over the downs, to come again to the border of\r\nnebulous opal and to lurk for the unicorns coming through in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nThey came to a part of the border far from the spot which they had\r\ndisturbed only three evenings before; and Orion was guided by the\r\nchattering trolls, for well they knew the haunts of the lonely unicorns.\r\nAnd Earth\'s evening came huge and hushed, till all was dim as the\r\ntwilight; and never a footfall did they hear of the unicorns, never a\r\nglimpse of their whiteness. And yet the trolls had guided Orion well,\r\nfor just as he would have despaired of a hunt that night, just when the\r\nevening seemed wholly and utterly empty, a unicorn stood on the\r\nearthward edge of the twilight where nothing had stood only a moment\r\nbefore: soon he moved slowly across the terrestrial grasses a few yards\r\nforward into the fields of men.\r\n\r\nAnother followed, moving a few yards also; and then they stood for\r\nfifteen of our earthly minutes moving nothing at all except their ears.\r\nAnd all that while the trolls hushed every hound, motionless under a\r\nhedge of the fields we know. Darkness had all but hidden them when at\r\nlast the unicorns moved. And, as soon as the largest was far enough from\r\nthe frontier, the trolls let loose every hound, and ran with them after\r\nthe unicorn with shrill yells of derision, all sure of his haughty head.\r\n\r\nBut the quick small minds of the trolls, though they had learned much of\r\nEarth, had not yet understood the irregularity of the moon. Darkness was\r\nnew to them, and they soon lost hounds. Orion in his eagerness to hunt\r\nhad made no choice of a suitable night: there was no moon at all, and\r\nwould be none till near morning. Soon he also fell behind.\r\n\r\nOrion easily collected the trolls, the night was full of their\r\nfrivolous noises, and the trolls came to his horn, but not a hound would\r\nleave that pungent magical scent for any horn of man. They straggled\r\nback next day, tired, having lost their unicorn.\r\n\r\nAnd while each troll cleaned and fed his hound on the evening after the\r\nhunt, and laid a little bunch of straw for it on which to lie down, and\r\nsmoothed its hair and looked for thorns in its feet, and unravelled\r\nburrs from its ears, Lurulu sat alone fastening his small sharp\r\nintelligence, like the little white light of a burning glass, for hours\r\nupon one question. The question that Lurulu pondered far into the night\r\nwas how to hunt unicorns with dogs in the darkness. And by midnight a\r\nplan was clear in his elvish mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n               _The Luring of the People of the Marshes_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the evening that followed was beginning to fade a traveller might\r\nhave been seen approaching the marshes, which some way south-eastwards\r\nof Erl lay along the edge of the farmsteads and stretched their terrible\r\nwaste as far as the sky-line, and even over the border and into the\r\nregion of Elfland. They glimmered now as the light was leaving the land.\r\n\r\nSo black were the solemn clothes and the high grave hat of the traveller\r\nthat he could have been seen from far against the dim green of the\r\nfields, going down to the edge of the marsh through the grey evening.\r\nBut none were there to see at such an hour beside that desolate place,\r\nfor the threat of darkness was already felt in the fields, and all the\r\ncows were home and the farmers warm in their houses; so the traveller\r\nwalked alone. And soon he was come by unsure paths to the reeds and the\r\nthin rushes, to which a wind was telling tales that have no meaning to\r\nman, long histories of bleakness and ancient legends of rain; while on\r\nthe high darkening land far off behind him he saw lights begin to blink\r\nwhere the houses were. He walked with the gravity and the solemn air of\r\none who has important business with men; yet his back was turned to\r\ntheir houses and he went where no man wandered, travelling towards no\r\nhamlet or lonely cottage of man, for the marsh ran right into Elfland.\r\nBetween him and the nebulous border that divides Earth from Elfland\r\nthere was no man whatever, and yet the traveller walked on as one that\r\nhas a grave errand. With every venerable step that he took bright mosses\r\nshook and the marsh seemed about to engulf him, while his worthy staff\r\nsank deep into slime, giving him no support; and yet the traveller\r\nseemed only to care for the solemnity of his pacing. Thus he went on\r\nover the deadly marsh with a deportment suitable to the slow procession\r\nwhen the elders open the market on special days, and the gravest blesses\r\nthe bargaining, and all the farmers come to the booths and barter.\r\n\r\nAnd up and down, up and down, song-birds went wavering home, skirting\r\nthe marsh\'s edge on their way to their native hedges; pigeons passed\r\nlandward to roost in high dark trees; the last of a multitude of rooks\r\nwas gone; and all the air was empty.\r\n\r\nAnd now the great marsh thrilled to the news of the coming of a\r\nstranger; for, no sooner had the traveller gravely set a foot on one of\r\nthose brilliant mosses that bloom in the pools, than a thrill shot under\r\ntheir roots and below the stems of the bulrushes, and ran like a light\r\nbeneath the surface of the water, or like the sound of a song, and\r\npassed far over the marshes, and came quivering to the border of magical\r\ntwilight that divides Elfland from Earth; and stayed not there, but\r\ntroubled the very border and passed beyond it and was felt in Elfland:\r\nfor where the great marshes run down to the border of Earth the\r\nfrontier is thinner and more uncertain than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAnd as soon as they felt that thrill in the deep of the marshes the\r\nwill-o\'-the-wisps soared up from their fathomless homes, and waved their\r\nlights to beckon the traveller on, over the quaking mosses at the hour\r\nwhen the duck were flighting. And under that whirr and rush and\r\nrejoicing of wings that the ducks make in that hour the traveller\r\nfollowed after the waving lights, further and further into the marshes.\r\nYet sometimes he turned from them, so that for a while they followed\r\nhim, instead of leading as they were accustomed to do, till they could\r\nget round in front of him and lead him once more. A watcher, if there\r\nhad been one in such bad light and in such a perilous place, had noticed\r\nafter a while in the venerable traveller\'s movements a queer resemblance\r\nto those of the hen green plover when she lures the stranger after her\r\nin Spring, away from the mossy bank where her eggs lie bare. Or perhaps\r\nsuch a resemblance is merely fanciful, and a watcher might have noticed\r\nno such thing. At any rate on that night in that desolate place there\r\nwas no watcher whatever.\r\n\r\nAnd the traveller followed his curious course, sometimes towards the\r\ndangerous mosses, sometimes towards the safe green land, always with\r\ngrave demeanour and reverent gait; and the will-o\'-the-wisps in\r\nmultitudes gathered about him. And still that deep thrill that warned\r\nthe marsh of a stranger throbbed on through the ooze below the roots of\r\nthe rushes; and did not cease, as it should as soon as the stranger was\r\ndead, but haunted the marsh like some echo of music that magic has made\r\neverlasting, and troubled the will-o\'-the-wisps even over the border in\r\nElfland.\r\n\r\nNow it is far from my intention to write anything detrimental to\r\nwill-o\'-the-wisps, or anything that may be construed as being a slight\r\nupon them: no such construction should be put upon my writings. But it\r\nis well known that the people of the marshes lure travellers to their\r\ndoom, and have delighted to follow that avocation for centuries, and I\r\nmay be permitted to mention this in no spirit of disapproval.\r\n\r\nThe will-o\'-the-wisps then that were about this traveller redoubled\r\ntheir efforts with fury; and when still he eluded their last enticements\r\nonly on the very edge of the deadliest pools, and still lived and still\r\ntravelled, and the whole marsh knew of it, then the greater\r\nwill-o\'-the-wisps that dwell in Elfland rose up from their magical mire\r\nand rushed over the border. And the whole marsh was troubled.\r\n\r\nAlmost like little moons grown nimbly impudent the people of the marshes\r\nglowed before that solemn traveller, leading his reverend steps to the\r\nedge of death only to retrace their steps again to beckon him back once\r\nmore. And then in spite of the great height of his hat and the dark\r\nlength of his coat that frivolous people began to perceive that mosses\r\nwere bearing his weight which never before had supported any traveller.\r\nAt this their fury increased and they all leaped nearer to him; and\r\nnearer and nearer they flocked wherever he went; and in their fury their\r\nenticements were losing their craftiness.\r\n\r\nAnd now a watcher in the marshes, if such there had been, had seen\r\nsomething more than a traveller surrounded by will-o\'-the-wisps; for he\r\nmight have noticed that the traveller was almost leading them, instead\r\nof the will-o\'-the-wisps leading the traveller. And in their impatience\r\nto have him dead the people of the marshes had never thought that they\r\nwere all coming nearer and nearer to the dry land.\r\n\r\nAnd when all was dark but the water they suddenly found themselves in a\r\nfield of grass with their feet rasping against the rough pasture, while\r\nthe traveller was seated with his knees gathered up to his chin and was\r\neyeing them from under the brim of his high black hat. Never before had\r\nany of them been lured to dry land by traveller, and there were amongst\r\nthem that night those eldest and greatest among them who had come with\r\ntheir moon-like lights right over the border from Elfland. They looked\r\nat each other in uneasy astonishment as they dropped limply onto the\r\ngrass, for the roughness and heaviness of the solid land oppressed them\r\nafter the marshes. And then they began to perceive that that venerable\r\ntraveller whose bright eyes watched them so keenly out of that black\r\nmass of clothes was little larger than they were themselves, in spite of\r\nhis reverend airs. Indeed, though stouter and rounder he was not quite\r\nso tall. Who was this, they began to mutter, who had lured\r\nwill-o\'-the-wisps? And some of those elders from Elfland went up to him\r\nthat they might ask him with what audacity he had dared to lure such as\r\nthem. And then the traveller spoke. Without rising or turning his head\r\nhe spoke where he sat.\r\n\r\n"People of the marshes," he said, "do you love unicorns?"\r\n\r\nAnd at the word unicorns scorn and laughter filled every tiny heart in\r\nall that frivolous multitude, excluding all other emotions, so that they\r\nforgot their petulance at having been lured; although to lure\r\nwill-o\'-the-wisps is held by them to be the gravest of insults, and\r\nnever would they have forgiven it if they had had longer memories. At\r\nthe word unicorns they all giggled in silence. And this they did by\r\nflickering up and down like the light of a little mirror flashed by an\r\nimpudent hand. Unicorns! Little love had they for the haughty creatures.\r\nLet them learn to speak to the people of the marshes when they came to\r\ndrink at their pools. Let them learn to give their due to the great\r\nlights of Elfland, and the lesser lights that illumined the marshes of\r\nEarth!\r\n\r\n"No," said an elder of the will-o\'-the-wisps, "none loves the proud\r\nunicorns."\r\n\r\n"Come then," said the traveller, "and we will hunt them. And you shall\r\nlight us in the night with your lights, when we hunt them with dogs over\r\nthe fields of men."\r\n\r\n"Venerable traveller," said that elder will-o\'-the-wisp: but at those\r\nwords the traveller flung up his hat and leaped from his long black\r\ncoat, and stood before the will-o\'-the-wisps stark naked. And the people\r\nof the marshes saw that it was a troll that had tricked them.\r\n\r\nTheir anger at this was slight; for the people of the marshes have\r\ntricked the trolls, and the trolls have tricked the people of the\r\nmarshes, each of them so many times for ages and ages, that only the\r\nwisest among them can say which has tricked the other most and is how\r\nmany tricks ahead. They consoled themselves now by thinking of times\r\nwhen trolls had been made to look ludicrous, and consented to come with\r\ntheir lights to help to hunt unicorns, for their wills were weak when\r\nthey stood on the dry land and they easily acquiesced in any suggestion\r\nor followed anyone\'s whim.\r\n\r\nIt was Lurulu who had thus tricked the will-o\'-the-wisps, knowing well\r\nhow they love to lure travellers; and, having obtained the highest hat\r\nand gravest coat he could steal, he had set out with a bait that he\r\nknew would bring them from great distances. Now that he had gathered\r\nthem all on the solid land and had their promise of light and help\r\nagainst unicorns, which such creatures will give easily on account of\r\nthe unicorns\' pride, he began to lead them away to the village of Erl,\r\nslowly at first while their feet grew accustomed to the hard land; and\r\nover the fields he brought them limping to Erl.\r\n\r\nAnd now there was nothing in all the marshes that at all resembled man,\r\nand the geese came down on a huge tumult of wings. The little swift teal\r\nshot home; and all the dark air twanged with the flight of the duck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n                    _The Coming of Too Much Magic_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Erl that had sighed for magic there was indeed magic now. The\r\npigeon-loft and old lumber-lofts over stables were all full of trolls,\r\nthe ways were full of their antics, and lights bobbed up and down the\r\nstreet at night long after traffic was home. For the will-o\'-the-wisps\r\nwould go dancing along the gutters, and had made their homes round the\r\nsoft edges of duck-ponds and in green-black patches of moss that grew\r\nupon oldest thatch. And nothing seemed the same in the old village.\r\n\r\nAnd amongst all these magical folk the magical half of Orion\'s blood,\r\nthat had slept while he went amongst earthly men, hearing mundane talk\r\neach day, stirred out of its sleep and awakened long-sleeping thoughts\r\nin his brain. And the elfin horns that he often heard blowing at evening\r\nblew with a meaning now, and blew stronger as though they were nearer.\r\n\r\nThe folk of the village watching their lord by day saw his eyes turned\r\naway towards Elfland, saw him neglecting the wholesome earthly cares,\r\nand at night there came the queer lights and the gibbering of the\r\ntrolls. A fear settled on Erl.\r\n\r\nAt this time the parliament took counsel again, twelve grey-beard\r\nquaking men that had come to the house of Narl when their work was ended\r\nat evening; and all the evening was weird with the new magic of Elfland.\r\nEvery man of them as he ran from his own warm house on his way to the\r\nforge of Narl had seen lights leaping, or heard voices gibbering, which\r\nwere of no Christom land. And some had seen shapes prowling which were\r\nof no earthly growing, and they feared that all manner of things had\r\nslipped through the border of Elfland to come and visit the trolls.\r\n\r\nThey spoke low in their parliament: all told the same tale, a tale of\r\nchildren terrified, a tale of women demanding the old ways again; and as\r\nthey spoke they eyed window and crevice, none knowing what might come.\r\n\r\nAnd Oth said: "Let us folk go to the Lord Orion as we went to his\r\ngrandfather in his long red room. Let us say how we sought for magic,\r\nand lo we have magic enough; and let him follow no more after witchery\r\nnor the things that are hidden from man."\r\n\r\nHe listened acutely, standing there amongst his hushed comrade\r\nneighbours. Was it goblin voices that mocked him, or was it only echo?\r\nWho could say? And almost at once the night all round was hushed again.\r\n\r\nAnd Threl said: "Nay. It is too late for that." Threl had seen their\r\nlord one evening standing alone on the downs, all motionless and\r\nlistening to something sounding from Elfland, with his eyes to the East\r\nas he listened: and nothing was sounding, not a noise was astir; yet\r\nOrion stood there called by things beyond mortal hearing. "It is too\r\nlate now," said Threl.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the fear of all.\r\n\r\nThen Guhic rose slowly up and stood by that table. And trolls were\r\ngibbering like bats away in their loft, and the pale marsh-lights were\r\nflickering, and shapes prowled in the dark: the pit-pat of their feet\r\ncame now and then to the ears of the twelve that were there in that\r\ninner room. And Guhic said: "We wished for a little magic." And a gust\r\nof gibbering came clear from the trolls. And then they disputed awhile\r\nas to how much magic they had wished in the olden time, when the\r\ngrandfather of Orion was lord in Erl. But when they came to a plan this\r\nwas the plan of Guhic.\r\n\r\n"If we may not turn our lord Orion," he said, "and his eyes be turned to\r\nElfland, let all our parliament go up the hill to the witch Ziroonderel,\r\nand put our case to her, and ask for a spell which shall be put against\r\ntoo much magic."\r\n\r\nAnd at the name of Ziroonderel the twelve took heart again; for they\r\nknew that her magic was greater than the magic of flickering lights, and\r\nknew there was not a troll or thing of the night but went in fear of her\r\nbroom. They took heart again and quaffed Narl\'s heavy mead, and\r\nre-filled their mugs and praised Guhic.\r\n\r\nAnd late in the night they all rose up together to go back to their\r\nhomes, and all kept close together as they went, and sang grave old\r\nsongs to affright the things that they feared; though little the light\r\ntrolls care, or the will-o\'-the-wisps, for the things that are grave to\r\nman. And when only one was left he ran to his house, and the\r\nwill-o\'-the-wisps chased him.\r\n\r\nWhen the next day came they ended their work early, for the parliament\r\nof Erl cared not to be left on the witch\'s hill when night came, or even\r\nthe gloaming. They met outside Narl\'s forge in the early afternoon,\r\neleven of the parliament, and they called out Narl. And all were wearing\r\nthe clothes they were wont to wear when they went with the rest to the\r\nholy place of the Freer, though there was scarcely a soul he had ever\r\ncursed that was not blessed by her. And away they went with their old\r\nstout staves up the hill.\r\n\r\nAnd as soon as they could they came to the witch\'s house. And there they\r\nfound her sitting outside her door gazing over the valley away, and\r\nlooking neither older nor younger, nor concerned one way or the other\r\nwith the coming and going of years.\r\n\r\n"We be the parliament of Erl," they said, standing before her all in\r\ntheir graver clothes.\r\n\r\n"Aye," she said. "You desired magic. Has it come to you yet?"\r\n\r\n"Truly," they said, "and to spare."\r\n\r\n"There is more to come," she said.\r\n\r\n"Mother Witch," said Narl, "we are met here to pray you that you will\r\ngive us a goodly spell which shall be a charm against magic, so that\r\nthere be no more of it in the valley, for overmuch has come."\r\n\r\n"Overmuch?" she said. "Overmuch magic! As though magic were not the\r\nspice and essence of life, its ornament and its splendour. By my broom,"\r\nsaid she, "I give you no spell against magic."\r\n\r\nAnd they thought of the wandering lights and the scarce-seen gibbering\r\nthings, and all the strangeness and evil that was come to their valley\r\nof Erl, and they besought her again, speaking suavely to her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mother Witch," said Guhic, "there is overmuch magic indeed, and the\r\nfolk that should tarry in Elfland are all over the border."\r\n\r\n"It is even so," said Narl. "The border is broken and there will be no\r\nend to it. Will-o\'-the-wisps should stay in the marshes, and trolls and\r\ngoblins in Elfland, and we folk should keep to our own folk. This is the\r\nthought of us all. For magic, if we desired it somewhat, years ago when\r\nwe were young, pertains to matters that are not for man."\r\n\r\nShe eyed him silently with a cat-like glow increasing in her eyes. And\r\nwhen she neither spoke nor moved, Narl besought her again.\r\n\r\n"O Mother Witch," he said, "will you give us no spell to guard our homes\r\nagainst magic?"\r\n\r\n"No spell indeed!" she hissed. "No spell indeed! By broom and stars and\r\nnight-riding! Would you rob Earth of her heirloom that has come from the\r\nolden time? Would you take her treasure and leave her bare to the scorn\r\nof her comrade planets? Poor indeed were we without magic, whereof we\r\nare well stored to the envy of darkness and Space." She leaned forward\r\nfrom where she sat and stamped her stick, looking up in Narl\'s face with\r\nher fierce unwavering eyes. "I would sooner," she said, "give you a\r\nspell against water, that all the world should thirst, than give you a\r\nspell against the song of streams that evening hears faintly over the\r\nridge of a hill, too dim for wakeful ears, a song threading through\r\ndreams, whereby we learn of old wars and lost loves of the Spirits of\r\nrivers. I would sooner give you a spell against bread, that all the\r\nworld should starve, than give you a spell against the magic of wheat\r\nthat haunts the golden hollows in moonlight in July, through which in\r\nthe warm short nights wander how many of whom man knows nothing. I would\r\nmake you spells against comfort and clothing, food, shelter and warmth,\r\naye and will do it, sooner than tear from these poor fields of Earth\r\nthat magic that is to them an ample cloak against the chill of Space,\r\nand a gay raiment against the sneers of nothingness.\r\n\r\n"Go hence. To your village go. And you that sought for magic in your\r\nyouth but desire it not in your age, know that there is a blindness of\r\nspirit which comes from age, more black than the blindness of eye,\r\nmaking a darkness about you across which nothing may be seen, or felt,\r\nor known, or in any way apprehended. And no voice out of that darkness\r\nshall conjure me to grant a spell against magic. Hence!"\r\n\r\nAnd as she said "Hence" she put her weight on her stick and was\r\nevidently preparing to rise from her seat. And at this great terror came\r\nupon all the parliament. And they noticed at the same moment that\r\nevening was drawing in and all the valley darkening. On this high field\r\nwhere the witch\'s cabbages grew some light yet lingered, and listening\r\nto her fierce words they had not thought of the hour. But now it was\r\nmanifestly growing late, and a wind roamed past them that seemed to come\r\nover the ridges a little way off, from night; and chilled them as it\r\npassed; and all the air seemed given over to that very thing against\r\nwhich they sought for a spell.\r\n\r\nAnd here they were at this hour with the witch before them, and she was\r\nevidently about to rise. Her eyes were fixed on them. Already she was\r\npartly up from her chair. There could be no doubt that before three\r\nmoments were passed she would be hobbling amongst them with her\r\nglittering eyes peering in each one\'s face. They turned and ran down the\r\nhill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n                     _The Cursing of Elfin Things_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the parliament of Erl ran down the hill they ran into the dusk of\r\nevening. Greyly it lay in the valley above the mist from the stream. But\r\nwith more than the mystery of dusk the air was heavy. Lights blinking\r\nearly from houses showed that all the folk were home, and the street was\r\ndeserted by everything that was human; save when with hushed air and\r\nalmost furtive step they saw their lord Orion like a tall shadow go by,\r\nwith will-o\'-the-wisps behind him, towards the house of the trolls,\r\nthinking no earthly thoughts. And the strangeness that had been growing\r\nday by day made all the village eerie. So that with short and troubled\r\nbreath the twelve old men hurried on.\r\n\r\nAnd so they came to the holy place of the Freer, which lay on the side\r\nof the village that was towards the witch\'s hill. And it was the hour at\r\nwhich he was wont to celebrate after-bird-song, as they named the\r\nsinging that they sang in the holy place when all the birds were home.\r\nBut the Freer was not within his holy place; he stood in the cold night\r\nair on the upper step without it, his face turned towards Elfland. He\r\nhad on his sacred robe with its border of purple, and the emblem of\r\ngold round his neck; but the door of his holy place was shut and his\r\nback was towards it. They wondered to see him stand thus.\r\n\r\nAnd as they wondered the Freer began to intone, clear in the evening\r\nwith his eyes away to the East, where already a few of the earliest\r\nstars were showing. With his head held high he spoke as though his voice\r\nmight pass over the frontier of twilight and be heard by the people of\r\nElfland.\r\n\r\n"Curst be all wandering things," he said, "whose place is not upon\r\nEarth. Curst be all lights that dwell in fens and in marish places.\r\nTheir homes are in deeps of the marshes. Let them by no means stir from\r\nthere until the Last Day. Let them abide in their place and there await\r\ndamnation.\r\n\r\n"Cursed be gnomes, trolls, elves and goblins on land, and all sprites of\r\nthe water. And fauns be accursed and such as follow Pan. And all that\r\ndwell on the heath, being other than beasts or men. Cursed be fairies\r\nand all tales told of them, and whatever enchants the meadows before the\r\nsun is up, and all fables of doubtful authority, and the legends that\r\nmen hand down from unhallowed times.\r\n\r\n"Cursed be brooms that leave their place by the hearth. Cursed be\r\nwitches and all manner of witcheries.\r\n\r\n"Cursed be toadstool rings and whatever dances within them. And all\r\nstrange lights, strange songs, strange shadows, or rumours that hint of\r\nthem, and all doubtful things of the dusk, and the things that\r\nill-instructed children fear, and old wives\' tales and things done o\'\r\nmidsummer nights; all these be accursed with all that leaneth toward\r\nElfland and all that cometh thence."\r\n\r\nNever a lane of that village, never a barn, but a will-o\'-the-wisp was\r\ndancing nimbly above it; the night was gilded with them. But as the good\r\nFreer spoke they backed away from his curses, floating further off as\r\nthough a light wind blew them, and danced again after drifting a little\r\nway. This they did both before and behind him and upon either hand, as\r\nhe stood there upon the steps of his holy place. So that there was a\r\ncircle of darkness all round him, and beyond that circle shone the\r\nlights of the marshes and Elfland.\r\n\r\nAnd within the dark circle in which the Freer stood making his curses\r\nwere no unhallowed things, nor were there strangenesses such as come of\r\nnight, nor whispers from unknown voices, nor sounds of any music blowing\r\nhere from no haunts of men; but all was orderly and seemly there and no\r\nmysteries troubled the quiet except such as have been justly allowed to\r\nman.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond that circle whence so much was beaten back by the bright\r\nvehemence of the good man\'s curses, the will-o\'-the-wisps rioted, and\r\nmany a strangeness that poured in that night from Elfland, and goblins\r\nheld high holiday. For word was gone forth in Elfland that pleasant folk\r\nhad now their dwelling in Erl; and many a thing of fable, many a monster\r\nof myth, had crept through that border of twilight and had come into Erl\r\nto see. And the light and false but friendly will-o\'-the-wisps danced in\r\nthe haunted air and made them welcome.\r\n\r\nAnd not only the trolls and the will-o\'-the-wisps had lured these folk\r\nfrom their fabled land through the seldom-traversed border, but the\r\nlongings and thoughts of Orion, which by half his lineage were akin to\r\nthe things of myth and of one race with the monsters of Elfland, were\r\ncalling to them now. Ever since that day by the frontier when he had\r\nhovered between Earth and Elfland he had yearned more and more for his\r\nmother; and now, whether he willed it or no, his elfin thoughts were\r\ncalling their kin that dwelt in the elvish fells; and at that hour when\r\nthe sound of the horns blew through the frontier of twilight they had\r\ncome tumbling after it. For elfin thoughts are as much akin to the\r\ncreatures that dwell in Elfland as goblins are to trolls.\r\n\r\nWithin the calm and the dark of the good man\'s curses the twelve old men\r\nstood silent listening to every word. And the words seemed good to them\r\nand soothing and right, for they were over-weary of magic.\r\n\r\nBut beyond the circle of darkness, amidst the glare of the\r\nwill-o\'-the-wisps with which all the night flickered, amidst goblin\r\nlaughter and the unbridled mirth of the trolls, where old legends seemed\r\nalive and the fearfullest fables true; amongst all manner of mysteries,\r\nqueer sounds, queer shapes, and queer shadows; Orion passed with his\r\nhounds, eastwards towards Elfland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n                      _Lirazel Yearns for Earth_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the hall that was built of moonlight, dreams, music and mirage\r\nLirazel knelt on the sparkling floor before her father\'s throne. And the\r\nlight of the magical throne shone blue in her eyes, and her eyes flashed\r\nback a light that deepened its magic. And kneeling there she besought a\r\nrune of her father.\r\n\r\nOld days would not let her be, sweet memories thronged about her: the\r\nlawns of Elfland had her love, lawns upon which she had played by the\r\nold miraculous flowers before any histories were written here; she loved\r\nthe sweet soft creatures of myth that moved like magical shadows out of\r\nthe guardian wood and over enchanted grasses; she loved every fable and\r\nsong and spell that had made her elfin home; and yet the bells of Earth,\r\nthat could not pass the frontier of silence and twilight, beat note by\r\nnote in her brain, and her heart felt the growth of the little earthly\r\nflowers as they bloomed or faded or slept in seasons that came not to\r\nElfland. And in those seasons, wasting away as every one went by, she\r\nknew that Alveric wandered, knew that Orion lived and grew and changed,\r\nand that both, if Earth\'s legend were true, would soon be lost to her\r\nforever and ever, when the gates of Heaven would shut on both with a\r\ngolden thud. For between Elfland and Heaven is no path, no flight, no\r\nway; and neither sends ambassador to the other. She yearned to the bells\r\nof Earth and the English cowslips, but would not forsake again her\r\nmighty father nor the world that his mind had made. And Alveric came\r\nnot, nor her boy Orion; only the sound of Alveric\'s horn came once, and\r\noften strange longings seemed to float in air, beating vainly back and\r\nforth between Orion and her. And the gleaming pillars that held the dome\r\nof the roof, or above which it floated, quivered a little with her\r\ngrief; and shadows of her sorrow flickered and faded in the crystal deep\r\nof the walls, for a moment dimming many a colour that is unknown in our\r\nfields, but making them no less lovely. What could she do who would not\r\ncast away magic and leave the home that an ageless day had endeared to\r\nher while centuries were withering like leaves upon earthly shores,\r\nwhose heart was yet held by those little tendrils of Earth, which are\r\nstrong enough, strong enough?\r\n\r\nAnd some, translating her bitter need into pitiless earthly words, may\r\nsay that she wished to be in two places at once. And that was true, and\r\nthe impossible wish lies on the verge of laughter, and for her was only\r\nand wholly a matter for tears. Impossible? Was it impossible? We have to\r\ndo with magic.\r\n\r\nShe besought a rune of her father, kneeling upon the magic floor in the\r\nmidmost centre of Elfland; and around her arose the pillars, of which\r\nonly song may say, whose misty bulk was disturbed and troubled by\r\nLirazel\'s sorrow. She besought a rune that, wherever they roamed through\r\nwhatever fields of Earth, should restore to her Alveric and Orion,\r\nbringing them over the border and into the elfin lands to live in that\r\ntimeless age that is one long day in Elfland. And with them she prayed\r\nmight come, (for the mighty runes of her father had such power even as\r\nthis) some garden of Earth, or bank where violets lay, or hollow where\r\ncowslips waved, to shine in Elfland for ever.\r\n\r\nLike no music heard in any cities of men or dreamed upon earthly hills,\r\nwith his elfin voice her father answered her. And the ringing words were\r\nsuch as had power to change the shape of the hills of dreams, or to\r\nenchant new flowers to blow in fields of faery. "I have no rune," he\r\nsaid, "that has power to pass the frontier, or to lure anything from the\r\nmundane fields, be it violets, cowslips or men, to come through our\r\nbulwark of twilight that I have set to guard us against material things.\r\nNo rune but one, and that the last of the potencies of our realm."\r\n\r\nAnd kneeling yet upon the glittering floor, of whose profound\r\ntranslucence song alone shall speak, she prayed him for that one rune,\r\nlast potency though it be of the awful wonders of Elfland.\r\n\r\nAnd he would not squander that rune that lay locked in his treasury,\r\nmost magical of his powers and last of the three, but held it against\r\nthe peril of a distant and unknown day, whose light shone just beyond a\r\ncurve of the ages, too far for the eerie vision even of his\r\nforeknowledge.\r\n\r\nShe knew that he had moved Elfland far afield and swung it back as tides\r\nare swung by the moon, till it lapped at the very edge of the fields of\r\nmen once more, with its glimmering border touching the tips of the\r\nearthly hedges. And she knew that no more than the moon had he used a\r\nrare wonder, merely wafting his regions away by a magical gesture.\r\nMight he not, she thought, bring Elfland and Earth yet nearer, using no\r\nrarer magic than is used by the moon at the neap? And so she supplicated\r\nhim once again, recalling wonders to him that he had wrought and yet\r\nused no rarer spell than a certain wave of his arm. She spoke of the\r\nmagical orchids that came down once over cliffs like a sudden roseate\r\nfoam breaking over the Elfin Mountains. She spoke of the downy clusters\r\nof queer mauve flowers which bloomed in the grass of the dells, and of\r\nthat glory of blossom that forever guarded the lawns. For all these\r\nwonders were his: bird-song and blooming of flower alike were his\r\ninspirations. If such wonders as song and bloom were wrought by a wave\r\nof his hand, surely he might by beckoning bring but a short way from\r\nEarth some few fields that lay so near to the earthly border. Or surely\r\nhe might move Elfland a little earthward again, who had lately moved it\r\nas far as the turn in the path of the comet, and had brought it again to\r\nthe edge of the fields of men.\r\n\r\n"Never," he said, "can any rune but one, or spell or wonder or any\r\nmagical thing, move our realm one wing\'s width over the earthly border\r\nor bring anything thence here. And little they know in those fields that\r\neven one rune can do it."\r\n\r\nAnd still she would scarce believe that those accustomed powers of her\r\nwizard sire could not easily bring the things of Earth and the wonders\r\nof Elfland together.\r\n\r\n"From those fields," he said, "my spells are all beaten back, my\r\nincantations are mute, and my right arm powerless."\r\n\r\nAnd when he spoke thus to her of that dread right arm, at last perforce\r\nshe believed him. And she prayed him again for that ultimate rune, that\r\nlong-hoarded treasure of Elfland, that potency that had strength to\r\nwork against the harsh weight of Earth.\r\n\r\nAnd his thoughts went into the future all alone, peering far down the\r\nyears. More gladly had a traveller at night in lonely ways given up his\r\nlantern than had this elvish king now used his last great spell, and so\r\ncast it away, and gone without it into those dubious years; whose dim\r\nforms he saw and many of their events, but not to the end. Easily had\r\nshe asked for that dread spell, which should appease the only need she\r\nhad, easily might he have granted it were he but human; but his vast\r\nwisdom saw so much of the years to be that he feared to face them\r\nwithout this last great potency.\r\n\r\n"Beyond our border," he said, "material things stand fierce and strong\r\nand many, and have the power to darken and to increase, for they have\r\nwonders too. And when this last potency be used and gone there remains\r\nin all our realm no rune that they dread; and material things will\r\nmultiply and put the powers in bondage, and we without any rune of which\r\nthey go in awe shall become no more than a fable. We must yet store this\r\nrune."\r\n\r\nThus he reasoned with her rather than commanded, though he was the\r\nfounder and King of all those lands, and all that wandered in them and\r\nof the light in which they shone. And reason in Elfland was no daily\r\nthing, but an exotic wonder. With this he sought to soothe her earthward\r\nfancies.\r\n\r\nAnd Lirazel made no answer but only wept, weeping tears of enchanted\r\ndew. And all the line of the Elfin Mountains quivered, as wandering\r\nwinds will tremble to notes of a violin that have strayed beyond hearing\r\ndown the ways of the air; and all the creatures of fable that dwelt in\r\nthe realm of Elfland felt something strange in their hearts like the\r\ndying away of a song.\r\n\r\n"Is it not best for Elfland that I do this?" said the King.\r\n\r\nAnd still she only wept.\r\n\r\nAnd then he sighed and considered the welfare of Elfland again. For\r\nElfland drew its happiness from the calm of that palace, which was its\r\ncentre, and of which only song may tell; and now its spires were\r\ntroubled and the light of its walls was dim, and a sorrow was floating\r\nfrom its vaulted doorway all over the fields of faery and over the dells\r\nof dream. If she were happy Elfland might bask again in that untroubled\r\nlight and eternal calm whose radiance blesses all but material things;\r\nand though his treasury were open and empty yet what more were needed\r\nthen?\r\n\r\nSo he commanded, and a coffer was brought before him by elfin things,\r\nand the knight of his guard who had watched over it forever came\r\nmarching behind them.\r\n\r\nHe opened the coffer with a spell, for it opened to no key, and taking\r\nfrom it an ancient parchment scroll he rose and read from it while his\r\ndaughter wept. And the words of the rune as he read were like the notes\r\nof a band of violins, all played by masters chosen from many ages,\r\nhidden on midsummer\'s midnight in a wood, with a strange moon shining,\r\nthe air all full of madness and mystery; and, lurking close but\r\ninvisible, things beyond the wisdom of man.\r\n\r\nThus he read that rune, and powers heard and obeyed it, not alone in\r\nElfland but over the border of Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n                          _The Shining Line_\r\n\r\n\r\nAlveric wandered on, alone of that small company of three without a hope\r\nto guide him. For Niv and Zend, who were lately led by the hope of their\r\nfantastic quest, no longer yearned for Elfland but were guided now by\r\ntheir plan to hold Alveric back from it. They vacillated more slowly\r\nthan sane folk, but clung with far more than sane fervour to each\r\nvacillation. And Zend that had wandered through so many years with the\r\nhope of Elfland before him looked on it, now that he had seen its\r\nfrontier, as one of the rivals of the moon. Niv who had endured as much\r\nfor Alveric\'s quest saw in that magical land something more fabulous\r\nthan was in all his dreams. And now when Alveric attempted lame\r\ncajoleries with those swift and ferocious minds he received no more\r\nanswers from Zend than the curt statement "It is not the will of the\r\nmoon": while Niv would only reiterate "Have I not dreams enough?"\r\n\r\nThey were wandering back again past farms that had known them years\r\nbefore. With their old grey tent more tattered they appeared in the\r\ntwilight, adding a shade to the evening, in fields wherein they and\r\ntheir tent had become a legend. And never was Alveric unwatched by some\r\nmad eye, lest he should slip from the camp and come to Elfland and be\r\nwhere dreams were stranger than Niv\'s and under a power more magical\r\nthan the moon.\r\n\r\nOften he tried, creeping silently from his place in the dead of night.\r\nOne moonlight night he tried first, waiting awake till all the world\r\nseemed sleeping. He knew that the frontier was not far away as he crept\r\nfrom the tent into the brightness and black shadows and passed Niv\r\nsleeping heavily. A little way he went, and there was Zend sitting still\r\non a rock, gazing into the face of the moon. Round came Zend\'s face and,\r\nnewly inspired by the moon, he shouted and leapt at Alveric. They had\r\ntaken away his sword. And Niv woke and came towards them with immense\r\nfury, united to Zend by one jealousy; for each of them knew well that\r\nthe wonders of Elfland were greater than any fancy that their minds\r\nwould ever know.\r\n\r\nAnd again he tried, on a night when no moon shone. But on that night Niv\r\nwas sitting outside the camp, relishing in a strange and joyless way a\r\ncertain comradeship that there was between his ravings and the\r\ninterstellar darkness. And there in the night he saw Alveric slipping\r\naway towards the land whose wonders far transcended all Niv\'s poor\r\ndreams; and all the fury the lesser can feel for the greater awoke at\r\nonce in his mind; and, creeping up behind him, without any help from\r\nZend he smote Alveric insensible to the ground.\r\n\r\nAnd never did Alveric plan any escape after that but that the busy\r\nthoughts of madness anticipated it.\r\n\r\nAnd so they came, watchers and watched, over the fields of men. And\r\nAlveric sought help of the folk of the farms; but the cunning of Niv\r\nknew too well the tricks of sanity. So that when the folk came running\r\nover their fields to that queer grey tent from which they heard\r\nAlveric\'s cries, they found Niv and Zend posed in a calm that they had\r\nmuch practised, while Alveric told of his thwarted quest of Elfland. Now\r\nby many men all quests are considered mad, as the cunning of Niv knew.\r\nAlveric found no help here.\r\n\r\nAs they went back by the way by which they had marched for years Niv led\r\nthat band of three, stepping ahead of Alveric and Zend with his lean\r\nface held high, made all the leaner by the long thin points to which he\r\nhad trained his beard and his moustaches, and wearing Alveric\'s sword\r\nthat stuck out long behind him and its hilt high in front. And he\r\nstepped and perked his head with a certain air that revealed to the rare\r\ntravellers who saw him that this sparse and ragged figure esteemed\r\nitself the leader of a greater band than were visible. Indeed if one had\r\njust seen him at the end of the evening with the dusk and the mist of\r\nthe fenlands close behind him he might have believed that in the dusk\r\nand the mist was an army that followed this gay worn confident man. Had\r\nthe army been there Niv was sane. Had the world accepted that an army\r\nwas there, even though only Alveric and Zend followed his curious steps,\r\nstill he was sane. But the lonely fancy that had not fact to feed on,\r\nnor the fancy of any other for fellowship, was for its loneliness mad.\r\n\r\nZend watched Alveric all the while, as they marched behind Niv; for\r\ntheir mutual jealousy of the wonders of Elfland bound Niv and Zend\r\ntogether to work as with one wild whim.\r\n\r\nAnd now one morning Niv stretched himself up to the fullest possible\r\nheight of his lean inches and extended his right arm high and addressed\r\nhis army, "We are come near again to Erl," he said. "And we shall bring\r\nnew fancies in place of outworn things and things that are stale; and\r\nits customs shall be henceforth the way of the moon."\r\n\r\nNow Niv cared nothing for the moon, but he had great cunning, and he\r\nknew that Zend would aid his new plan against Erl if only for the sake\r\nof the moon. And Zend cheered till the echoes came back from a lonely\r\nhill, and Niv smiled to them like a leader confident of his hosts. And\r\nAlveric rose against them then, and struggled with Niv and Zend for the\r\nlast time, and learned that age or wandering or loss of hope had left\r\nhim unable to strive against the maniacal strength of these two. And\r\nafter that he went with them more meekly, with resignation, caring no\r\nlonger what befell him, living only in memory and only for days that had\r\nbeen; and in November evenings in this dim camp in the chill he saw,\r\nlooking only backwards through the years, Spring mornings shine again on\r\nthe towers of Erl. In the light of these mornings he saw Orion again,\r\nplaying again with old toys that the witch had made with a spell; he saw\r\nLirazel move once more through the gracious gardens. Yet no light that\r\nmemory is able to kindle was strong enough to illumine much that camp in\r\nthose sombre evenings, when the damp rose up from the ground and the\r\nchill swooped out of the air, and Niv and Zend as darkness came stealing\r\nnearer began to chatter in low eager voices schemes inspired by such\r\nwhims as throve at dusk in the waste. Only when the sad day drifted\r\nwholly thence and Alveric slept by flapping tatters that streamed from\r\nthe tent in the night, then only was memory, unhindered by the busy\r\nchanges of day, able to bring back Erl to him, bright, happy and vernal;\r\nso that while his body lay still, in far fields, in the dark and the\r\nWinter, all that was most active and live in him was back over the wolds\r\nin Erl, back over the years in Spring with Lirazel and Orion.\r\n\r\nHow far he was bodily, in sheer miles from his home, for which his happy\r\nthoughts each night forsook his weary frame, Alveric knew not. It was\r\nmany years since their tent had stood one evening a grey shape in that\r\nlandscape in which it now waved its tatters. But Niv knew that of late\r\nthey had come nearer to Erl, for his dreams of it came to him now soon\r\nafter he fell asleep, and they used to come to him further on in the\r\nnight, on the other side of midnight and even towards morning: and from\r\nthis he argued that they used to have further to come, and were now but\r\na little way off. When he told this secretly one evening to Zend, Zend\r\nlistened gravely but gave no opinion, merely saying "The moon knows."\r\nNevertheless he followed Niv, who led this curious caravan always in\r\nthat direction from which his dreams of the valley of Erl came soonest.\r\nAnd this queer leadership brought them nearer to Erl, as often happens\r\nwhere men follow leaders that are crazy or blind or deceived; they reach\r\nsome port or other though they stray down the years with little\r\nforesight enough: were it otherwise what would become of us?\r\n\r\nAnd one day the upper parts of the towers of Erl looked at them out of\r\nblue distance, shining in early sunlight above a curve of the downs. And\r\ntowards them Niv turned at once and led directly, for the line of their\r\nwandering march had not pointed straight to Erl, and marched on as a\r\nconqueror that sees some new city\'s gates. What his plans were Alveric\r\ndid not know, but kept to his apathy; and Zend did not know, for Niv had\r\nmerely said that his plans must be secret; nor did Niv know, for his\r\nfancies poured through his brain and rushed away; what fancies made what\r\nplans in a mood that was yesterday\'s how could he tell to-day?\r\n\r\nThen as they went they soon came to a shepherd, standing amongst his\r\ngrazing sheep and leaning upon his crook, who watched and seemed to have\r\nno other care but only to watch all things going by, or, when nothing\r\npassed, to gaze and gaze at the downs till all his memories were\r\nfashioned out of their huge grass curves. He stood, a bearded man, and\r\nwatched them with never a word as they passed. And one of Niv\'s mad\r\nmemories suddenly knew him, and Niv hailed him by his name and the\r\nshepherd answered. And who should he be but Vand!\r\n\r\nThen they fell talking; and Niv spoke suavely, as he always did with\r\nsane folk, aping with clever mimicry the ways and the tricks of sanity,\r\nlest Alveric should ask for help against him. But Alveric sought no\r\nhelp. Silent he stood and heard the others talking, but his thoughts\r\nwere far in the past and their voices were only sounds to him. And Vand\r\nenquired of them if they had found Elfland. But he spoke as one asks of\r\nchildren if their toy boat has been to the Happy Isles. He had had for\r\nmany years to do with sheep, and had come to know their needs and their\r\nprice, and the need men have of them; and these things had risen\r\nimperceptibly up all round his imagination, and were at last a wall over\r\nwhich he saw no further. When he was young, yes once, he had sought for\r\nElfland; but now, why now he was older; such things were for the young.\r\n\r\n"But we saw its border," said Zend, "the border of twilight."\r\n\r\n"A mist," said Vand, "of the evening."\r\n\r\n"I have stood," said Zend, "upon the edge of Elfland."\r\n\r\nBut Vand smiled and shook his bearded head as he leaned on his long\r\ncrook, and every wave of his beard as he shook it slowly denied Zend\'s\r\ntales of that border, and his lips smiled it away, and his tolerant eyes\r\nwere grave with the lore of the fields we know.\r\n\r\n"No, not Elfland," he said.\r\n\r\nAnd Niv agreed with Vand, for he watched his mood, studying the ways of\r\nsanity. And they spoke of Elfland lightly, as one tells of some dream\r\nthat came at dawn and went away before waking. And Alveric heard with\r\ndespair, for Lirazel dwelt not only over the border but even, as he saw\r\nnow, beyond human belief; so that all at once she seemed remoter than\r\never, and he still lonelier.\r\n\r\n"I sought for it once," said Vand, "but no, there\'s no Elfland."\r\n\r\n"No," said Niv, and only Zend wondered.\r\n\r\n"No," replied Vand and shook his head and lifted his eyes to his sheep.\r\n\r\nAnd just beyond his sheep and coming towards them he saw a shining line.\r\nSo long his eyes stayed fixed on that shining line coming over the downs\r\nfrom the eastward that the others turned and looked.\r\n\r\nThey saw it too, a shimmering line of silver, or a little blue like\r\nsteel, flickering and changing with the reflection of strange passing\r\ncolours. And before it, very faint like threatening breezes breathing\r\nbefore a storm, came the soft sound of very old songs. It caught, as\r\nthey all stood gazing, one of Vand\'s furthest sheep; and instantly its\r\nfleece was that pure gold that is told of in old romance; and the\r\nshining line came on and the sheep disappeared altogether. They saw now\r\nthat it was about the height of the mist from a small stream; and still\r\nVand stood gazing at it, neither moving nor thinking. But Niv turned\r\nvery soon and beckoned curtly to Zend and seized Alveric by the arm and\r\nhastened away towards Erl. The gleaming line, that seemed to bump and\r\nstumble over every unevenness of the rough fields, came not so fast as\r\nthey hastened; yet it never stopped when they rested, never wearied when\r\nthey were tired, but came on over all the hills and hedges of Earth; nor\r\ndid sunset change its appearance or check its pace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n                         _The Last Great Rune_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Alveric hastened back, led by two madmen, to those lands over which\r\nhe had long ago been lord, the horns of Elfland had sounded in Erl all\r\nday. And though only Orion heard them, they no less thrilled the air,\r\nflooding it deep with their curious golden music, and filling the day\r\nwith a wonder that others felt; so that many a young girl leaned from\r\nher window to see what was enchanting the morning. But as the day wore\r\non the enchantment of the unheard music dwindled, giving place to a\r\nfeeling that weighed on all minds in Erl and seemed to bode the\r\nimminence of some unknown region of wonder. All his life Orion had heard\r\nthese horns blowing at evening except upon days on which he had done\r\nill: if he heard the horns at evening he knew that it was well with him.\r\nBut now they had blown in the morning, and blew all day, like a fanfare\r\nin front of a march; and Orion looked out of his window and saw nothing,\r\nand the horns rang on, proclaiming he knew not what. Far away they\r\ncalled his thoughts from the things of Earth that are the concern of\r\nmen, far away from all that casts shadows. He spoke to no man that day,\r\nbut went among his trolls and such elfin things as had followed them\r\nover the border. And all men that saw him perceived such a look in his\r\neyes as showed his thoughts to be far in realms that they dreaded. And\r\nhis thoughts were indeed far thence, once more with his mother. And hers\r\nwere with him, lavishing tendernesses that the years had denied her, in\r\ntheir swift passage over our fields that she never had understood. And\r\nsomehow he knew she was nearer.\r\n\r\nAnd all that strange morning the will-o\'-the-wisps were restless and the\r\ntrolls leaped wildly all about their lofts, for the horns of Elfland\r\ntinged all the air with magic and excited their blood although they\r\ncould not hear them. But towards evening they felt impending some great\r\nchange and all grew silent and moody. And something brought to them\r\nyearnings for their far magical home, as though a breeze had blown\r\nsuddenly into their faces straight off the tarns of Elfland; and they\r\nran up and down the street looking for something magical, to ease their\r\nloneliness amongst mundane things. But found nothing resembling the\r\nspell-born lilies that grew in their glory above the elfin tarns. And\r\nthe folk of the village perceived them everywhere and longed for the\r\nwholesome earthly days again that there were before the coming of magic\r\nto Erl. And some of them hurried off to the house of the Freer and took\r\nrefuge with him amongst his holy things from all the unhallowed shapes\r\nthat there were in their streets and all the magic that tingled and\r\nloomed in the air. And he guarded them with his curses which floated\r\naway the light and almost aimless will-o\'-the-wisps, and even, at a\r\nshort distance, awed the trolls, but they ran and capered only a little\r\nway off. And while the little group clustered about the Freer, seeking\r\nsolace from him against whatever impended, with which the air was\r\ngrowing tenser and grimmer as the short day wore on, there went others\r\nto Narl and the busy elders of Erl to say "See what your plans have\r\ndone. See what you have brought on the village."\r\n\r\nAnd none of the elders made immediate answer, but said that they must\r\ntake counsel one with another, for they trusted greatly in the words\r\nsaid in their parliament. And to this intent they gathered again at the\r\nforge of Narl. It was evening now, but the sun had not yet set nor Narl\r\ngone from his work, but his fire was beginning to glow with a deeper\r\ncolour among the shadows that had entered his forge. And the elders came\r\nin there walking slowly with grave faces, partly because of the mystery\r\nthat they needed to cover their folly from the sight of the villagers,\r\npartly because magic hung now so gross in the air that they feared the\r\nimminence of some portentous thing. They sat in their parliament in that\r\ninner room, while the sun went low and the elfin horns, had they but\r\nknown it, blew clear and triumphantly. And there they sat in silence,\r\nfor what could they say? They had wished for magic, and now it had come.\r\nTrolls were in all the streets, goblins had entered houses, and now the\r\nnights were mad with will-o\'-the-wisps; and all the air was heavy with\r\nunknown magic. What could they say? And after a while Narl said they\r\nmust make a new plan; for they had been plain bell-fearing folk, but now\r\nthere were magical things all over Erl, and more came every night from\r\nElfland to join them, and what would become of the old ways unless they\r\nmade a plan?\r\n\r\nAnd Narl\'s words emboldened them all, though they felt the ominous\r\nmenace of the horns that they could not hear; but the talk of a plan\r\nemboldened them, for they deemed they could plan against magic. And one\r\nby one they rose to speak of a plan.\r\n\r\nBut at sunset the talk died down. And their dread that something\r\nimpended grew now to a certain knowledge. Oth and Threl knew it first,\r\nwho had lived familiar with mystery in the woods. All knew that\r\nsomething was coming. No one knew what. And they all sat silent\r\nwondering in the gloaming.\r\n\r\nLurulu saw it first. He had dreamed all day of the weed-green tarns of\r\nElfland, and growing weary of Earth, had gone all lonely to the top of a\r\ntower that rose from the Castle of Erl and perched himself on a\r\nbattlement and gazed wistfully homewards. And looking out over the\r\nfields we know, he saw the shining line coming down on Erl. And from it\r\nhe heard rise faint, as it rippled over the furrows, a murmur of many\r\nold songs; for it came with all manner of memories, old music and lost\r\nvoices, sweeping back again to our old fields what time had driven from\r\nEarth. It was coming towards him bright as the Evening Star, and\r\nflashing with sudden colours, some common on Earth, and some unknown to\r\nour rainbow; so that Lurulu knew it at once for the frontier of Elfland.\r\nAnd all his impudence returned to him at sight of his fabulous home, and\r\nhe uttered shrill gusts of laughter from his high perch, that rang over\r\nthe roofs below like the chatter of building birds. And the little\r\nhomesick trolls in the lofts were cheered by the sound of his merriment\r\nthough they knew not from what it came. And now Orion heard the horns\r\nblowing so loud and near, and there was such triumph in their blowing,\r\nand pomp, and withal so wistful a crooning, that he knew now why they\r\nblew, knew that they proclaimed the approach of a princess of the elfin\r\nline, knew that his mother came back to him.\r\n\r\nHigh on her hill Ziroonderel knew this, being forwarned by magic; and\r\nlooking downward at evening she saw that star-like line of blended\r\ntwilights of old lost Summer evenings sweeping over the fields towards\r\nErl. Almost she wondered as she saw this glittering thing flowing over\r\nthe earthly pastures, although her wisdom had told her that it must\r\ncome. And on the one side she saw the fields we know, full of accustomed\r\nthings, and on the other, looking down from her height, she saw, behind\r\nthe myriad-tinted border, the deep green elfin foliage and Elfland\'s\r\nmagical flowers, and things that delirium sees not, nor inspiration, on\r\nEarth; and the fabulous creatures of Elfland prancing forward; and,\r\nstepping across our fields and bringing Elfland with her, the twilight\r\nflowing from both her hands, which she stretched out a little from her,\r\nwas her own lady the Princess Lirazel coming back to her home. And at\r\nthis sight, and at all the strangeness coming across our fields, or\r\nbecause of old memories that came with the twilight or bygone songs that\r\nsang in it, a strange joy came shivering upon Ziroonderel, and if\r\nwitches weep she wept.\r\n\r\nAnd now from upper windows of the houses the folk began to see that\r\nglittering line which was no earthly twilight: they saw it flash at them\r\nwith its starry gleam and then flow on towards them. Slowly it came as\r\nthough it rippled with difficulty over Earth\'s rugged bulk, though\r\nmoving lately over the rightful lands of the Elf King it had outspeeded\r\nthe comet. And hardly had they wondered at its strangeness, when they\r\nfound themselves amongst most familiar things, for the old memories that\r\nfloated before it, as a wind before the thunder, beat in a sudden gust\r\non their hearts and their houses, and lo! they were living once more\r\namongst things long past and lost. And as that line of no earthly light\r\ncame nearer there rustled before it a sound as of rain on leaves, old\r\nsighs, breathed over again, old lovers\' whispers repeated. And there\r\nfell on these folk as they all leaned hushed from their windows a mood\r\nthat looked gently, wistfully backward through time, such a mood as\r\nmight lurk by huge dock-leaves in ancient gardens when everyone is gone\r\nthat has tended their roses or ever loved the bowers.\r\n\r\nNot yet had that line of starlight and bygone loves lapped at the walls\r\nof Erl or foamed on the houses, but it was so near now that already\r\nthere slipped away the daily cares that held folk down to the present,\r\nand they felt the balm of past days and blessings from hands long\r\nwithered. Now elders ran out to children that skipped with a rope in the\r\nstreet, to bring them into the houses, not telling them why, for fear of\r\nfrightening their daughters. And the alarm in their mothers\' faces for a\r\nmoment startled the children; then some of them looked to the eastward\r\nand saw that shining line. "It is Elfland coming," they said, and went\r\non with their skipping.\r\n\r\nAnd the hounds knew, though what they knew I cannot say; but some\r\ninfluence reached them from Elfland such as comes from the full moon,\r\nand they bayed as they bay on clear nights when the fields are flooded\r\nwith moonlight. And the dogs in the streets that always watched lest\r\nanything strange should come, knew how great a strangeness was near them\r\nnow and proclaimed it to all the valley.\r\n\r\nAlready the old leather-worker in his cottage across the fields, looking\r\nout of his window to see if his well were frozen, saw a May morning of\r\nfifty years ago and his wife gathering lilac, for Elfland had beaten\r\nTime away from his garden.\r\n\r\nAnd now the jackdaws had left the towers of Erl and flew away westward;\r\nand the baying of the hounds filled all the air, and the barking of\r\nlesser dogs. This suddenly ceased and a great hush fell on the village,\r\nas though snow had suddenly fallen inches deep. And through the hush\r\ncame softly a strange old music; and no one spoke at all.\r\n\r\nThen where Ziroonderel sat by her door with her chin on her hand gazing,\r\nshe saw the bright line touch the houses and stop, flowing past them on\r\neither side but held by the houses, as though it had met with something\r\ntoo strong for its magic; but for only a moment the houses held back\r\nthat wonderful tide, for it broke over them with a burst of unearthly\r\nfoam, like a meteor of unknown metal burning in heaven, and passed on\r\nand the houses stood all quaint and queer and enchanted, like homes\r\nremembered out of a long-past age by the sudden waking of an inherited\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nAnd then she saw the boy she had nursed step forward into the twilight,\r\ndrawn by a power no less than that which was moving Elfland: she saw him\r\nand his mother meet again in all that light that was flooding the valley\r\nwith splendour. And Alveric was with her, he and she together a little\r\napart from attendant fabulous things, that escorted her all the way from\r\nthe vales of the Elfin Mountains. And from Alveric had fallen away that\r\nheavy burden of years, and all the sorrow of wandering: he too was back\r\nagain in the days that were, with old songs and lost voices. And\r\nZiroonderel could not see the princess\'s tears when she met Orion again\r\nafter all that separation of space and time, for, though they flashed\r\nlike stars, she stood in the border in all that radiance of starlight\r\nthat shone about her like the broad face of a planet. But though the\r\nwitch saw not this there came to her old ears clearly the sounds of\r\nsongs returning again to our fields out of the glens of Elfland, wherein\r\nthey had lain so long, which were all the old songs lost from the\r\nnurseries of the Earth. They crooned now about the meeting of Lirazel\r\nand Orion.\r\n\r\nAnd Niv and Zend had ease at last from their fierce fancies, for their\r\nwild thoughts sank to rest in the calm of Elfland and slept as hawks\r\nsleep in their trees when evening has lulled the world. Ziroonderel saw\r\nthem standing together where the edge of the downs had been, a little\r\nway off from Alveric. And there was Vand amongst his golden sheep, that\r\nwere munching the strange sweet juices of wonderful flowers.\r\n\r\nWith all these wonders Lirazel came for her son, and brought Elfland\r\nwith her that never had moved before the width of a harebell over the\r\nearthly border. And where they met was an old garden of roses under the\r\ntowers of Erl, where once she had walked, and none had cared for it\r\nsince. Great weeds were now in its walks, and even they were withered\r\nwith the rigour of late November: their dry stalks hissed about his feet\r\nas Orion walked through them, and they swung back brown behind him over\r\nuntended paths. But before him bloomed in all their glory and beauty the\r\ngreat voluptuous roses gorgeous with Summer. Between November that she\r\nwas driving before her and that old season of roses that she brought\r\nback to her garden Lirazel and Orion met. For a moment the withered\r\ngarden lay brown behind him, then it all flashed into bloom, and the\r\nwild glad song of birds from a hundred arbours welcomed back the old\r\nroses. And Orion was back again in the beauty and brightness of days\r\nwhose dim fair shades his memory cherished, such as are the chief of all\r\nthe treasures of man; but the treasury in which they lie is locked, and\r\nwe have not the key. Then Elfland poured over Erl.\r\n\r\nOnly the holy place of the Freer and the garden that was about it\r\nremained still of our Earth, a little island all surrounded by wonder,\r\nlike a mountain peak all rocky, alone in air, when a mist wells up in\r\nthe gloaming from highland valleys, and leaves only one pinnacle darkly\r\nto gaze at the stars. For the sound of his bell beat back the rune and\r\nthe twilight for a little distance all round. There he lived happy,\r\ncontented, not quite alone, amongst his holy things, for a few that had\r\nbeen cut off by that magical tide lived on the holy island and served\r\nhim there. And he lived beyond the age of ordinary men, but not to the\r\nyears of magic.\r\n\r\nNone ever crossed the boundary but one, the witch Ziroonderel, who from\r\nher hill that was just on the earthward border would go by broom on\r\nstarry nights to see her lady again, where she dwelt unvexed by years,\r\nwith Alveric and Orion. Thence she comes sometimes, high in the night on\r\nher broom, unseen by any down on the earthly fields, unless you chance\r\nto notice star after star blink out for an instant as she passes by\r\nthem, and sits beside cottage doors and tells queer tales, to such as\r\ncare to have news of the wonders of Elfland. May I hear her again!\r\n\r\nAnd with the last of his world-disturbing runes sent forth, and his\r\ndaughter happy once more, the elfin King on his tremendous throne\r\nbreathed and drew in the calm in which Elfland basks; and all his realms\r\ndreamed on in that ageless repose, of which deep green pools in summer\r\ncan barely guess; and Erl dreamed too with all the rest of Elfland and\r\nso passed out of all remembrance of men. For the twelve that were of the\r\nparliament of Erl looked through the window of that inner room, wherein\r\nthey planned their plans by the forge of Narl, and, gazing over their\r\nfamiliar lands, perceived that they were no longer the fields we know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE KING OF ELFLAND\'S DAUGHTER \r\n***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nelectronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
