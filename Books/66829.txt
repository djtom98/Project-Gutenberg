This almost made me smile as what it\r\nwould really make would be a whole row of encyclopediacs. I mean I seem\r\nto be thinking practically all of the time. I mean it is my favorite\r\nrecreation and sometimes I sit for hours and do not seem to do anything\r\nelse but think. So this gentleman said a girl with brains ought to do\r\nsomething else with them besides think. And he said he ought to know\r\nbrains when he sees them, because he is in the senate and he spends\r\nquite a great deal of time in Washington, d. c., and when he comes into\r\ncontract with brains he always notices it. So it might have all blown\r\nover but this morning he sent me a book. And so when my maid brought it\r\nto me, I said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Lulu, here is another book and we have not\r\nread half the ones we have got yet.\xe2\x80\x9d But when I opened it and saw that\r\nit was all a blank I remembered what my gentleman acquaintance said,\r\nand so then I realized that it was a diary. So here I am writing a book\r\ninstead of reading one.\r\n\r\nBut now it is the 16th of March and of course it is to late to begin\r\nwith January, but it does not matter as my gentleman friend, Mr.\r\nEisman, was in town practically all of January and February, and when\r\nhe is in town one day seems to be practically the same as the next day.\r\n\r\nI mean Mr. Eisman is in the wholesale button profession in Chicago and\r\nhe is the gentleman who is known practically all over Chicago as Gus\r\nEisman the Button King. And he is the gentleman who is interested in\r\neducating me, so of course he is always coming down to New York to see\r\nhow my brains have improved since the last time. But when Mr. Eisman is\r\nin New York we always seem to do the same thing and if I wrote down one\r\nday in my diary, all I would have to do would be to put quotation marks\r\nfor all other days. I mean we always seem to have dinner at the Colony\r\nand see a show and go to the Trocadero and then Mr. Eisman shows me to\r\nmy apartment. So of course when a gentleman is interested in educating\r\na girl, he likes to stay and talk about the topics of the day until\r\nquite late, so I am quite fatigued the next day and I do not really get\r\nup until it is time to dress for dinner at the Colony.\r\n\r\nIt would be strange if I turn out to be an authoress. I mean at my home\r\nnear Little Rock, Arkansas, my family all wanted me to do something\r\nabout my music. Because all of my friends said I had talent and they\r\nall kept after me and kept after me about practising. But some way I\r\nnever seemed to care so much about practising. I mean I simply could\r\nnot sit for hours and hours at a time practising just for the sake of a\r\ncareer. So one day I got quite tempermental and threw the old mandolin\r\nclear across the room and I have really never touched it since. But\r\nwriting is different because you do not have to learn or practise and\r\nit is more tempermental because practising seems to take all the\r\ntemperment out of me. So now I really almost have to smile because I\r\nhave just noticed that I have written clear across two pages onto March\r\n18th, so this will do for today and tomorrow. And it just shows how\r\ntempermental I am when I get started.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 19th:\r\n\r\nWell last evening Dorothy called up and Dorothy said she has met a\r\ngentleman who gave himself an introduction to her in the lobby of the\r\nRitz. So then they went to luncheon and tea and dinner and then they\r\nwent to a show and then they went to the Trocadero. So Dorothy said his\r\nname was Lord Cooksleigh but what she really calls him is Coocoo. So\r\nDorothy said why don\xe2\x80\x99t you and I and Coocoo go to the Follies tonight\r\nand bring Gus along if he is in town? So then Dorothy and I had quite a\r\nlittle quarrel because every time that Dorothy mentions the subject of\r\nMr. Eisman she calls Mr. Eisman by his first name, and she does not\r\nseem to realize that when a gentleman who is as important as Mr.\r\nEisman, spends quite a lot of money educating a girl, it really does\r\nnot show reverance to call a gentleman by his first name. I mean I\r\nnever even think of calling Mr. Eisman by his first name, but if I want\r\nto call him anything at all, I call him \xe2\x80\x9cDaddy\xe2\x80\x9d and I do not even call\r\nhim \xe2\x80\x9cDaddy\xe2\x80\x9d if a place seems to be public. So I told Dorothy that Mr.\r\nEisman would not be in town until day after tomorrow. So then Dorothy\r\nand Coocoo came up and we went to the Follies.\r\n\r\nSo this morning Coocoo called up and he wanted me to luncheon at the\r\nRitz. I mean these foreigners really have quite a nerve. Just because\r\nCoocoo is an Englishman and a Lord he thinks a girl can waste hours on\r\nhim just for a luncheon at the Ritz, when all he does is talk about\r\nsome exposition he went on to a place called Tibet and after talking\r\nfor hours I found out that all they were was a lot of Chinamen. So I\r\nwill be quite glad to see Mr. Eisman when he gets in. Because he always\r\nhas something quite interesting to talk about, as for instants the last\r\ntime he was here he presented me with quite a beautiful emerald\r\nbracelet. So next week is my birthday and he always has some delightful\r\nsurprise on holidays.\r\n\r\nI did intend to luncheon at the Ritz with Dorothy today and of course\r\nCoocoo had to spoil it, as I told him that I could not luncheon with\r\nhim today, because my brother was in town on business and had the\r\nmumps, so I really could not leave him alone. Because of course if I\r\nwent to the Ritz now I would bump into Coocoo. But I sometimes almost\r\nhave to smile at my own imagination, because of course I have not got\r\nany brother and I have not even thought of the mumps for years. I mean\r\nit is no wonder that I can write.\r\n\r\nSo the reason I thought I would take luncheon at the Ritz was because\r\nMr. Chaplin is at the Ritz and I always like to renew old\r\nacquaintances, because I met Mr. Chaplin once when we were both working\r\non the same lot in Hollywood and I am sure he would remember me.\r\nGentlemen always seem to remember blondes. I mean the only career I\r\nwould like to be besides an authoress is a cinema star and I was doing\r\nquite well in the cinema when Mr. Eisman made me give it all up.\r\nBecause of course when a gentleman takes such a friendly interest in\r\neducating a girl as Mr. Eisman does, you like to show that you\r\nappreciate it, and he is against a girl being in the cinema because his\r\nmother is authrodox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 20th:\r\n\r\nMr. Eisman gets in tomorrow to be here in time for my birthday. So I\r\nthought it would really be delightful to have at least one good time\r\nbefore Mr. Eisman got in, so last evening I had some literary gentlemen\r\nin to spend the evening because Mr. Eisman always likes me to have\r\nliterary people in and out of the apartment. I mean he is quite anxious\r\nfor a girl to improve her mind and his greatest interest in me is\r\nbecause I always seem to want to improve my mind and not waste any\r\ntime. And Mr. Eisman likes me to have what the French people call a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csalo\xe2\x80\x9d which means that people all get together in the evening and\r\nimprove their minds. So I invited all of the brainy gentlemen I could\r\nthink up. So I thought up a gentleman who is the proffessor of all of\r\nthe economics up at Columbia College, and the editor who is the famous\r\neditor of the New York Transcript and another gentleman who is a famous\r\nplayright who writes very, very famous plays that are all about Life. I\r\nmean anybody would recognize his name but it always seems to slip my\r\nmemory because all of we real friends of his only call him Sam. So Sam\r\nasked if he could bring a gentleman who writes novels from England, so\r\nI said yes, so he brought him. And then we all got together and I\r\ncalled up Gloria and Dorothy and the gentleman brought their own\r\nliquor. So of course the place was a wreck this morning and Lulu and I\r\nworked like proverbial dogs to get it cleaned up, but Heaven knows how\r\nlong it will take to get the chandelier fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 22nd:\r\n\r\nWell my birthday has come and gone but it was really quite depressing.\r\nI mean it seems to me a gentleman who has a friendly interest in\r\neducating a girl like Gus Eisman, would want her to have the biggest\r\nsquare cut diamond in New York. I mean I must say I was quite\r\ndisappointed when he came to the apartment with a little thing you\r\ncould hardly see. So I told him I thought it was quite cute, but I had\r\nquite a headache and I had better stay in a dark room all day and I\r\ntold him I would see him the next day, perhaps. Because even Lulu\r\nthought it was quite small and she said, if she was I, she really would\r\ndo something definite and she said she always believed in the old\r\naddage, \xe2\x80\x9cLeave them while you\xe2\x80\x99re looking good.\xe2\x80\x9d But he came in at\r\ndinner time with really a very very beautiful bracelet of square cut\r\ndiamonds so I was quite cheered up. So then we had dinner at the Colony\r\nand we went to a show and supper at the Trocadero as usual whenever he\r\nis in town. But I will give him credit that he realized how small it\r\nwas. I mean he kept talking about how bad business was and the button\r\nprofession was full of bolshevicks who make nothing but trouble.\r\nBecause Mr. Eisman feels that the country is really on the verge of the\r\nbolshevicks and I become quite worried. I mean if the bolshevicks do\r\nget in, there is only one gentleman who could handle them and that is\r\nMr. D. W. Griffith. Because I will never forget when Mr. Griffith was\r\ndirecting Intolerance. I mean it was my last cinema just before Mr.\r\nEisman made me give up my career and I was playing one of the girls\r\nthat fainted at the battle when all of the gentlemen fell off the\r\ntower. And when I saw how Mr. Griffith handled all of those mobs in\r\nIntolerance I realized that he could do anything, and I really think\r\nthat the government of America ought to tell Mr. Griffith to get all\r\nready if the bolshevicks start to do it.\r\n\r\nWell I forgot to mention that the English gentleman who writes novels\r\nseems to have taken quite an interest in me, as soon as he found out\r\nthat I was literary. I mean he has called up every day and I went to\r\ntea twice with him. So he has sent me a whole complete set of books for\r\nmy birthday by a gentleman called Mr. Conrad. They all seem to be about\r\nocean travel although I have not had time to more than glance through\r\nthem. I have always liked novels about ocean travel ever since I posed\r\nfor Mr. Christie for the front cover of a novel about ocean travel by\r\nMcGrath because I always say that a girl never really looks as well as\r\nshe does on board a steamship, or even a yacht.\r\n\r\nSo the English gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s name is Mr. Gerald Lamson as those who have\r\nread his novels would know. And he also sent me some of his own novels\r\nand they all seem to be about middle age English gentlemen who live in\r\nthe country over in London and seem to ride bicycles, which seems quite\r\ndifferent from America, except at Palm Beach. So I told Mr. Lamson how\r\nI write down all of my thoughts and he said he knew I had something to\r\nme from the first minute he saw me and when we become better acquainted\r\nI am going to let him read my diary. I mean I even told Mr. Eisman\r\nabout him and he is quite pleased. Because of course Mr. Lamson is\r\nquite famous and it seems Mr. Eisman has read all of his novels going\r\nto and fro on the trains and Mr. Eisman is always anxious to meet\r\nfamous people and take them to the Ritz to dinner on Saturday night.\r\nBut of course I did not tell Mr. Eisman that I am really getting quite\r\na little crush on Mr. Lamson, which I really believe I am, but Mr.\r\nEisman thinks my interest in him is more literary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 30th:\r\n\r\nAt last Mr. Eisman has left on the 20th Century and I must say I am\r\nquite fatigued and a little rest will be quite welcome. I mean I do not\r\nmind staying out late every night if I dance, but Mr. Eisman is really\r\nnot such a good dancer so most of the time we just sit and drink some\r\nchampagne or have a bite to eat and of course I do not dance with\r\nanyone else when I am out with Mr. Eisman. But Mr. Eisman and Gerry, as\r\nMr. Lamson wants me to call him, became quite good friends and we had\r\nseveral evenings, all three together. So now that Mr. Eisman is out of\r\ntown at last, Gerry and I are going out together this evening and Gerry\r\nsaid not to dress up, because Gerry seems to like me more for my soul.\r\nSo I really had to tell Gerry that if all the gentlemen were like he\r\nseems to be, Madame Frances\xe2\x80\x99 whole dress making establishment would\r\nhave to go out of business. But Gerry does not like a girl to be\r\nnothing else but a doll, but he likes her to bring in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nslippers every evening and make him forget what he has gone through.\r\n\r\nBut before Mr. Eisman went to Chicago he told me that he is going to\r\nParis this summer on professional business and I think he intends to\r\npresent me with a trip to Paris as he says there is nothing so\r\neducational as traveling. I mean it did worlds of good to Dorothy when\r\nshe went abroad last spring and I never get tired of hearing her\r\ntelling how the merry-go-rounds in Paris have pigs instead of horses.\r\nBut I really do not know whether to be thrilled or not because, of\r\ncourse, if I go to Paris I will have to leave Gerry and both Gerry and\r\nI have made up our minds not to be separated from one another from now\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 31st:\r\n\r\nLast night Gerry and I had dinner at quite a quaint place where we had\r\nroast beef and baked potato. I mean he always wants me to have food\r\nwhich is what he calls \xe2\x80\x9cnourishing\xe2\x80\x9d which most gentlemen never seem to\r\nthink about. So then we took a hansom cab and drove for hours around\r\nthe park because Gerry said the air would be good for me. It is really\r\nvery sweet to have some one think of all those things that gentlemen\r\nhardly ever seem to think about. So then we talked quite a lot. I mean\r\nGerry knows how to draw a girl out and I told him things that I really\r\nwould not even put in my diary. So when he heard all about my life he\r\nbecame quite depressed and we both had tears in our eyes. Because he\r\nsaid he never dreamed a girl could go through so much as I, and come\r\nout so sweet and not made bitter by it all. I mean Gerry thinks that\r\nmost gentlemen are brutes and hardly ever think about a girl\xe2\x80\x99s soul.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that Gerry has had quite a lot of trouble himself and he\r\ncan not even get married on account of his wife. He and she have never\r\nbeen in love with each other but she was a suffragette and asked him to\r\nmarry her, so what could he do? So we rode all around the park until\r\nquite late talking and philosophizing quite a lot and I finally told\r\nhim that I thought, after all, that bird life was the highest form of\r\ncivilization. So Gerry calls me his little thinker and I really would\r\nnot be surprised if all of my thoughts will give him quite a few ideas\r\nfor his novels. Because Gerry says he has never seen a girl of my\r\npersonal appearance with so many brains. And he had almost given up\r\nlooking for his ideal when our paths seemed to cross each other and I\r\ntold him I really thought a thing like that was nearly always the\r\nresult of fate.\r\n\r\nSo Gerry says that I remind him quite a lot of Helen of Troy, who was\r\nof Greek extraction. But the only Greek I know is a Greek gentleman by\r\nthe name of Mr. Georgopolis who is really quite wealthy and he is what\r\nDorothy and I call a \xe2\x80\x9cShopper\xe2\x80\x9d because you can always call him up at\r\nany hour and ask him to go shopping and he is always quite delighted,\r\nwhich very few gentlemen seem to be. And he never seems to care how\r\nmuch anything costs. I mean Mr. Georgopolis is also quite cultured, as\r\nI know quite a few gentlemen who can speak to a waiter in French but\r\nMr. Georgopolis can also speak to a waiter in Greek which very few\r\ngentlemen seem to be able to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 1st:\r\n\r\nI am taking special pains with my diary from now on as I am really\r\nwriting it for Gerry. I mean he and I are going to read it together\r\nsome evening in front of the fireplace. But Gerry leaves this evening\r\nfor Boston as he has to lecture about all of his works at Boston, but\r\nhe will rush right back as soon as possible. So I am going to spend all\r\nof my time improving myself while he is gone. And this afternoon we are\r\nboth going to a museum on 5th Avenue, because Gerry wants to show me a\r\nvery very beautiful cup made by an antique jeweler called Mr. Cellini\r\nand he wants me to read Mr. Cellini\xe2\x80\x99s life which is a very very fine\r\nbook and not dull while he is in Boston.\r\n\r\nSo the famous playright friend of mine who is called Sam called up this\r\nmorning and he wanted me to go to a literary party tonight that he and\r\nsome other literary gentlemen are giving to Florence Mills in Harlem\r\nbut Gerry does not want me to go with Sam as Sam always insists on\r\ntelling riskay stories. But personally I am quite broad minded and I\r\nalways say that I do not mind a riskay story as long as it is really\r\nfunny. I mean I have a great sense of humor. But Gerry says Sam does\r\nnot always select and choose his stories and he just as soon I did not\r\ngo out with him. So I am going to stay home and read the book by Mr.\r\nCellini instead, because, after all, the only thing I am really\r\ninterested in, is improving my mind. So I am going to do nothing else\r\nbut improve my mind while Gerry is in Boston. I mean I just received a\r\ncable from Willie Gwynn who arrives from Europe tomorrow, but I am not\r\neven going to bother to see him. He is a sweet boy but he never gets\r\nanywhere and I am not going to waste my time on such as him, after\r\nmeeting a gentleman like Gerry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 2nd:\r\n\r\nI seem to be quite depressed this morning as I always am when there is\r\nnothing to put my mind to. Because I decided not to read the book by\r\nMr. Cellini. I mean it was quite amuseing in spots because it was\r\nreally quite riskay but the spots were not so close together and I\r\nnever seem to like to always be hunting clear through a book for the\r\nspots I am looking for, especially when there are really not so many\r\nspots that seem to be so amuseing after all. So I did not waste my time\r\non it but this morning I told Lulu to let all of the house work go and\r\nspend the day reading a book entitled \xe2\x80\x9cLord Jim\xe2\x80\x9d and then tell me all\r\nabout it, so that I would improve my mind while Gerry is away. But when\r\nI got her the book I nearly made a mistake and gave her a book by the\r\ntitle of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Nigger of the Narcissus\xe2\x80\x9d which really would have hurt her\r\nfeelings. I mean I do not know why authors cannot say \xe2\x80\x9cNegro\xe2\x80\x9d instead\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cNigger\xe2\x80\x9d as they have their feelings just the same as we have.\r\n\r\nWell I just got a telegram from Gerry that he will not be back until\r\ntomorrow and also some orchids from Willie Gwynn, so I may as well go\r\nto the theatre with Willie tonight to keep from getting depressed, as\r\nhe really is a sweet boy after all. I mean he never really does\r\nanything obnoxious. And it is quite depressing to stay at home and do\r\nnothing but read, unless you really have a book that is worth bothering\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 3rd:\r\n\r\nI was really so depressed this morning that I was even glad to get a\r\nletter from Mr. Eisman. Because last night Willie Gwynn came to take me\r\nto the Follies, but he was so intoxicated that I had to telephone his\r\nclub to send around a taxi to take him home. So that left me alone with\r\nLulu at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock with nothing to do, so I put in a telephone call\r\nfor Boston to talk to Gerry but it never went through. So Lulu tried to\r\nteach me how to play mah jong, but I really could not keep my mind on\r\nit because I was so depressed. So today I think I had better go over to\r\nMadame Frances and order some new evening gowns to cheer me up.\r\n\r\nWell Lulu just brought me a telegram from Gerry that he will be in this\r\nafternoon, but I must not meet him at the station on account of all of\r\nthe reporters who always meet him at the station wherever he comes\r\nfrom. But he says he will come right up to see me as he has something\r\nto talk about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 4th:\r\n\r\nWhat an evening we had last evening. I mean it seems that Gerry is\r\nmadly in love with me. Because all of the time he was in Boston\r\nlecturing to the womens clubs he said, as he looked over the faces of\r\nall those club women in Boston, he never realized I was so beautiful.\r\nAnd he said that there was only one in all the world and that was me.\r\nBut it seems that Gerry thinks that Mr. Eisman is terrible and that no\r\ngood can come of our friendship. I mean I was quite surprised, as they\r\nboth seemed to get along quite well together, but it seems that Gerry\r\nnever wants me to see Mr. Eisman again. And he wants me to give up\r\neverything and study French and he will get a divorce and we will be\r\nmarried. Because Gerry does not seem to like the kind of life all of us\r\nlead in New York and he wants me to go home to papa in Arkansas and he\r\nwill send me books to read so that I will not get lonesome there. And\r\nhe gave me his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s Masonic ring, which came down from the time of\r\nSoloman and which he never even lets his wife wear, for our engagement\r\nring, and this afternoon a lady friend of his is going to bring me a\r\nnew system she thought up of how to learn French. But some way I still\r\nseem to be depressed. I mean I could not sleep all night thinking of\r\nthe terrible things Gerry said about New York and about Mr. Eisman. Of\r\ncourse I can understand Gerry being jealous of any gentleman friend of\r\nmine and of course I never really thought that Mr. Eisman was Rudolph\r\nValentino, but Gerry said it made him cringe to think of a sweet girl\r\nlike I having a friendship with Mr. Eisman. So it really made me feel\r\nquite depressed. I mean Gerry likes to talk quite a lot and I always\r\nthink a lot of talk is depressing and worries your brains with things\r\nyou never even think of when you are busy. But so long as Gerry does\r\nnot mind me going out with other gentlemen when they have something to\r\ngive you mentally, I am going to luncheon with Eddie Goldmark of the\r\nGoldmark Films who is always wanting me to sign a contract to go into\r\nthe cinema. Because Mr. Goldmark is madly in love with Dorothy and\r\nDorothy is always wanting me to go back in the cinema because Dorothy\r\nsays that she will go if I will go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 6th:\r\n\r\nWell I finally wrote Mr. Eisman that I was going to get married and it\r\nseems that he is coming on at once as he would probably like to give me\r\nhis advice. Getting married is really quite serious and Gerry talks to\r\nme for hours and hours about it. I mean he never seems to get tired of\r\ntalking and he does not seem to even want to go to shows or dance or do\r\nanything else but talk, and if I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have something definite\r\nto put my mind on soon I will scream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 7th:\r\n\r\nWell Mr. Eisman arrived this morning and he and I had quite a long\r\ntalk, and after all I think he is right. Because here is the first real\r\nopportunity I have ever really had. I mean to go to Paris and broaden\r\nout and improve my writing, and why should I give it up to marry an\r\nauthor, where he is the whole thing and all I would be would be the\r\nwife of Gerald Lamson? And on top of that I would have to be dragged\r\ninto the scandal of a divorce court and get my name smirched. So Mr.\r\nEisman said that opportunities come to seldom in a girls life for me to\r\ngive up the first one I have really ever had. So I am sailing for\r\nFrance and London on Tuesday and taking Dorothy with me and Mr. Eisman\r\nsays that he will see us there later. So Dorothy knows all of the ropes\r\nand she can get along in Paris just as though she knew French and\r\nbesides she knows a French gentleman who was born and raised there, who\r\nspeaks it like a native and knows Paris like a book. And Dorothy says\r\nthat when we get to London nearly everybody speaks English anyway. So\r\nit is quite lucky that Mr. Lamson is out lecturing in Cincinnati and he\r\nwill not be back until Wednesday and I can send him a letter and tell\r\nhim that I have to go to Europe now but I will see him later perhaps.\r\nSo anyway I will be spared listening to any more of his depressing\r\nconversation. So Mr. Eisman gave me quite a nice string of pearls and\r\nhe gave Dorothy a diamond pin and we all went to the Colony for dinner\r\nand we all went to a show and supper at the Trocadero and we all spent\r\nquite a pleasant evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\nFATE KEEPS ON HAPPENING\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 11th:\r\n\r\nWell Dorothy and I are really on the ship sailing to Europe as anyone\r\ncould tell by looking at the ocean. I always love the ocean. I mean I\r\nalways love a ship and I really love the Majestic because you would not\r\nknow it was a ship because it is just like being at the Ritz, and the\r\nsteward says the ocean is not so obnoxious this month as it generally\r\nis. So Mr. Eisman is going to meet us next month in Paris because he\r\nhas to be there on business. I mean he always says that there is really\r\nno place to see the latest styles in buttons like Paris.\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy is out taking a walk up and down the deck with a gentleman\r\nshe met on the steps, but I am not going to waste my time going around\r\nwith gentlemen because if I did nothing but go around I would not\r\nfinish my diary or read good books which I am always reading to improve\r\nmy mind. But Dorothy really does not care about her mind and I always\r\nscold her because she does nothing but waste her time by going around\r\nwith gentlemen who do not have anything, when Eddie Goldmark of the\r\nGoldmark Films is really quite wealthy and can make a girl delightful\r\npresents. But she does nothing but waste her time and yesterday, which\r\nwas really the day before we sailed, she would not go to luncheon with\r\nMr. Goldmark but she went to luncheon to meet a gentleman called Mr.\r\nMencken from Baltimore who really only prints a green magazine which\r\nhas not even got any pictures in it. But Mr. Eisman is always saying\r\nthat every girl does not want to get ahead and get educated like me.\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Eisman and Lulu come down to the boat to see me off and Lulu\r\ncried quite a lot. I mean I really believe she could not care any more\r\nfor me if she was light and not colored. Lulu has had a very sad life\r\nbecause when she was quite young a pullman porter fell madly in love\r\nwith her. So she believed him and he lured her away from her home to\r\nAshtabula and deceived her there. So she finally found out that she had\r\nbeen deceived and she really was broken hearted and when she tried to\r\ngo back home she found out that it was to late because her best girl\r\nfriend, who she had always trusted, had stolen her husband and he would\r\nnot take Lulu back. So I have always said to her she could always work\r\nfor me and she is going to take care of the apartment until I get back,\r\nbecause I would not sublet the apartment because Dorothy sublet her\r\napartment when she went to Europe last year and the gentleman who\r\nsublet the apartment allowed girls to pay calls on him who were not\r\nnice.\r\n\r\nMr. Eisman has litereally filled our room with flowers and the steward\r\nhas had quite a hard time to find enough vases to put them into. I mean\r\nthe steward said he knew as soon as he saw Dorothy and I that he would\r\nhave quite a heavy run on vases. And of course Mr. Eisman has sent me\r\nquite a lot of good books as he always does, because he always knows\r\nthat good books are always welcome. So he has sent me quite a large\r\nbook of Etiquette as he says there is quite a lot of Etiquette in\r\nEngland and London and it would be a good thing for a girl to learn. So\r\nI am going to take it on the deck after luncheon and read it, because I\r\nwould often like to know what a girl ought to do when a gentleman she\r\nhas just met, says something to her in a taxi. Of course I always\r\nbecome quite vexed but I always believe in giving a gentleman another\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nSo now the steward tells me it is luncheon time, so I will go upstairs\r\nas the gentleman Dorothy met on the steps has invited us to luncheon in\r\nthe Ritz, which is a special dining room on the ship where you can\r\nspend quite a lot of money because they really give away the food in\r\nthe other dining room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 12th:\r\n\r\nI am going to stay in bed this morning as I am quite upset as I saw a\r\ngentleman who quite upset me. I am not really sure it was the\r\ngentleman, as I saw him at quite a distants in the bar, but if it\r\nreally is the gentleman it shows that when a girl has a lot of fate in\r\nher life it is sure to keep on happening. So when I thought I saw this\r\ngentleman I was with Dorothy and Major Falcon, who is the gentleman\r\nDorothy met on the steps, and Major Falcon noticed that I became upset,\r\nso he wanted me to tell him what was the matter, but it is really so\r\nterrible that I would not want to tell anyone. So I said good night to\r\nMajor Falcon and I left him with Dorothy and I went down to our room\r\nand did nothing but cry and send the steward for some champagne to\r\ncheer me up. I mean champagne always makes me feel philosophical\r\nbecause it makes me realize that when a girl\xe2\x80\x99s life is as full of fate\r\nas mine seems to be, there is nothing else to do about it. So this\r\nmorning the steward brought me my coffee and quite a large pitcher of\r\nice water so I will stay in bed and not have any more champagne until\r\nluncheon time.\r\n\r\nDorothy never has any fate in her life and she does nothing but waste\r\nher time and I really wonder if I did right to bring her with me and\r\nnot Lulu. I mean she really gives gentlemen a bad impression as she\r\ntalks quite a lot of slang. Because when I went up yesterday to meet\r\nshe and Major Falcon for luncheon, I overheard her say to Major Falcon\r\nthat she really liked to become intoxicated once in a \xe2\x80\x9cdirty\xe2\x80\x9d while.\r\nOnly she did not say intoxicated, but she really said a slang word that\r\nmeans intoxicated and I am always having to tell her that \xe2\x80\x9cdirty\xe2\x80\x9d is a\r\nslang word and she really should not say \xe2\x80\x9cdirty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMajor Falcon is really quite a delightful gentleman for an Englishman.\r\nI mean he really spends quite a lot of money and we had quite a\r\ndelightful luncheon and dinner in the Ritz until I thought I saw the\r\ngentleman who upset me and I am so upset I think I will get dressed and\r\ngo up on the deck and see if it really is the one I think it is. I mean\r\nthere is nothing else for me to do as I have finished writing in my\r\ndiary for today and I have decided not to read the book of Ettiquette\r\nas I glanced through it and it does not seem to have anything in it\r\nthat I would care to know because it wastes quite a lot of time telling\r\nyou what to call a Lord and all the Lords I have met have told me what\r\nto call them and it is generally some quite cute name like Coocoo whose\r\nreal name is really Lord Cooksleigh. So I will not waste my time on\r\nsuch a book. But I wish I did not feel so upset about the gentleman I\r\nthink I saw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 13th:\r\n\r\nIt really is the gentleman I thought I saw. I mean when I found out it\r\nwas the gentleman my heart really stopped. Because it all brought back\r\nthings that anybody does not like to remember, no matter who they are.\r\nSo yesterday when I went up on the deck to see if I could see the\r\ngentleman and see if it really was him, I met quite a delightful\r\ngentleman who I met once at a party called Mr. Ginzberg. Only his name\r\nis not Mr. Ginzberg any more because a gentleman in London called Mr.\r\nBattenburg, who is some relation to some king, changed his name to Mr.\r\nMountbatten which Mr. Ginzberg says really means the same thing after\r\nall. So Mr. Ginsberg changed his name to Mr. Mountginz which he really\r\nthinks is more aristocratic. So we walked around the deck and we met\r\nthe gentleman face to face and I really saw it was him and he really\r\nsaw it was me. I mean his face became so red it was almost a picture.\r\nSo I was so upset I said good-bye to Mr. Mountginz and I started to\r\nrush right down to my room and cry. But when I was going down the\r\nsteps, I bumped right into Major Falcon who noticed that I was upset.\r\nSo Major Falcon made me go to the Ritz and have some champagne and tell\r\nhim all about it.\r\n\r\nSo then I told Major Falcon about the time in Arkansas when Papa sent\r\nme to Little Rock to study how to become a stenographer. I mean Papa\r\nand I had quite a little quarrel because Papa did not like a gentleman\r\nwho used to pay calls on me in the park and Papa thought it would do me\r\ngood to get away for awhile. So I was in the business colledge in\r\nLittle Rock for about a week when a gentleman called Mr. Jennings paid\r\na call on the business colledge because he wanted to have a new\r\nstenographer. So he looked over all we colledge girls and he picked me\r\nout. So he told our teacher that he would help me finish my course in\r\nhis office because he was only a lawyer and I really did not have to\r\nknow so much. So Mr. Jennings helped me quite a lot and I stayed in his\r\noffice about a year when I found out that he was not the kind of a\r\ngentleman that a young girl is safe with. I mean one evening when I\r\nwent to pay a call on him at his apartment, I found a girl there who\r\nreally was famous all over Little Rock for not being nice. So when I\r\nfound out that girls like that paid calls on Mr. Jennings I had quite a\r\nbad case of histerics and my mind was really a blank and when I came\r\nout of it, it seems that I had a revolver in my hand and it seems that\r\nthe revolver had shot Mr. Jennings.\r\n\r\nSo this gentleman on the boat was really the District Attorney who was\r\nat the trial and he really was quite harsh at the trial and he called\r\nme names that I would not even put in my diary. Because everyone at the\r\ntrial except the District Attorney was really lovely to me and all the\r\ngentlemen in the jury all cried when my lawyer pointed at me and told\r\nthem that they practically all had had either a mother or a sister. So\r\nthe jury was only out three minutes and then they came back and\r\nacquitted me and they were all so lovely that I really had to kiss all\r\nof them and when I kissed the judge he had tears in his eyes and he\r\ntook me right home to his sister. I mean it was when Mr. Jennings\r\nbecame shot that I got the idea to go into the cinema, so Judge Hibbard\r\ngot me a ticket to Hollywood. So it was Judge Hibbard who really gave\r\nme my name because he did not like the name I had because he said a\r\ngirl ought to have a name that ought to express her personality. So he\r\nsaid my name ought to be Lorelei which is the name of a girl who became\r\nfamous for sitting on a rock in Germany, So I was in Hollywood in the\r\ncinema when I met Mr. Eisman and he said that a girl with my brains\r\nought not to be in the cinema but she ought to be educated, so he took\r\nme out of the cinema so he could educate me.\r\n\r\nSo Major Falcon was really quite interested in everything I talked\r\nabout, because he said it was quite a co-instance because this District\r\nAttorney, who is called Mr. Bartlett, is now working for the government\r\nof America and he is on his way to a place called Vienna on some\r\nbusiness for Uncle Sam that is quite a great secret and Mr. Falcon\r\nwould like very much to know what the secret is, because the Government\r\nin London sent him to America especially to find out what it was. Only\r\nof course Mr. Bartlett does not know who Major Falcon is, because it is\r\nsuch a great secret, but Major Falcon can tell me, because he knows who\r\nhe can trust. So Major Falcon says he thinks a girl like I ought to\r\nforgive and forget what Mr. Bartlett called me and he wants to bring us\r\ntogether and he says he thinks Mr. Bartlett would talk to me quite a\r\nlot when he really gets to know me and I forgive him for that time in\r\nLittle Rock. Because it would be quite romantic for Mr. Bartlett and I\r\nto become friendly, and gentlemen who work for Uncle Sam generally like\r\nto become romantic with girls. So he is going to bring us together on\r\nthe deck after dinner tonight and I am going to forgive him and talk\r\nwith him quite a lot, because why should a girl hold a grudge against a\r\ngentleman who had to do it. So Major Falcon brought me quite a large\r\nbottle of perfume and a quite cute imitation of quite a large size dog\r\nin the little shop which is on board the boat. I mean Major Falcon\r\nreally knows how to cheer a girl up quite a lot and so tonight I am\r\ngoing to make it all up with Mr. Bartlett.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 14th:\r\n\r\nWell Mr. Bartlett and I made it all up last night and we are going to\r\nbe the best of friends and talk quite a lot. So when I went down to my\r\nroom quite late Major Falcon came down to see if I and Mr. Bartlett\r\nwere really going to be friends because he said a girl with brains like\r\nI ought to have lots to talk about with a gentleman with brains like\r\nMr. Bartlett who knows all of Uncle Sam\xe2\x80\x99s secrets.\r\n\r\nSo I told Major Falcon how Mr. Bartlett thinks that he and I seem to be\r\nlike a play, because all the time he was calling me all those names in\r\nLittle Rock he really thought I was. So when he found out that I turned\r\nout not to be, he said he always thought that I only used my brains\r\nagainst gentlemen and really had quite a cold heart. But now he thinks\r\nI ought to write a play about how he called me all those names in\r\nLittle Rock and then, after seven years, we became friendly.\r\n\r\nSo I told Major Falcon that I told Mr. Bartlett I would like to write\r\nthe play but I really did not have time as it takes quite a lot of time\r\nto write my diary and read good books. So Mr. Bartlett did not know\r\nthat I read books which is quite a co-instance because he reads them\r\nto. So he is going to bring me a book of philosophy this afternoon\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cSmile, Smile, Smile\xe2\x80\x9d which all the brainy senators in\r\nWashington are reading which cheers you up quite a lot.\r\n\r\nSo I told Major Falcon that having a friendship with Mr. Barlett was\r\nreally quite enervating because Mr. Bartlett does not drink anything\r\nand the less anybody says about his dancing the better. But he did ask\r\nme to dine at his table, which is not in the Ritz and I told him I\r\ncould not, but Major Falcon told me I ought to, but I told Major Falcon\r\nthat there was a limit to almost everything. So I am going to stay in\r\nmy room until luncheon and I am going to luncheon in the Ritz with Mr.\r\nMountginz who really knows how to treat a girl.\r\n\r\nDorothy is up on the deck wasting quite a lot of time with a gentleman\r\nwho is only a tennis champion. So I am going to ring for the steward\r\nand have some champagne which is quite good for a person on a boat. The\r\nsteward is really quite a nice boy and he has had quite a sad life and\r\nhe likes to tell me all about himself. I mean it seems that he was\r\narrested in Flatbush because he promised a gentleman that he would\r\nbring him some very very good scotch and they mistook him for a\r\nbootlegger. So it seems they put him in a prison and they put him in a\r\ncell with two other gentlemen who were very, very famous burglars. I\r\nmean they really had their pictures in all the newspapers and everybody\r\nwas talking about them. So my steward, whose real name is Fred, was\r\nvery very proud to be in the same cell with such famous burglars. So\r\nwhen they asked him what he was in for, he did not like to tell them\r\nthat he was only a bootlegger, so he told them that he set fire to a\r\nhouse and burned up quite a large family in Oklahoma. So everything\r\nwould have gone alright except that the police had put a dictaphone in\r\nthe cell and used it all against him and he could not get out until\r\nthey had investigated all the fires in Oklahoma. So I always think that\r\nit is much more educational to talk to a boy like Fred who has been\r\nthrough a lot and really suffered than it is to talk to a gentleman\r\nlike Mr. Bartlett. But I will have to talk to Mr. Bartlett all\r\nafternoon as Major Falcon has made an appointment for me to spend the\r\nwhole afternoon with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 15th:\r\n\r\nLast night there was quite a maskerade ball on the ship which was\r\nreally all for the sake of charity because most of the sailors seem to\r\nhave orphans which they get from going on the ocean when the sea is\r\nvery rough. So they took up quite a collection and Mr. Bartlett made\r\nquite a long speech in favor of orphans especially when their parents\r\nare sailors. Mr. Bartlett really likes to make speeches quite a lot. I\r\nmean he even likes to make speeches when he is all alone with a girl\r\nwhen they are walking up and down a deck. But the maskerade ball was\r\nquite cute and one gentleman really looked almost like an imitation of\r\nMr. Chaplin. So Dorothy and I really did not want to go to the ball but\r\nMr. Bartlett bought us two scarfs at the little store which is on the\r\nship so we tied them around our hips and everyone said we made quite a\r\ncute Carmen. So Mr. Bartlett and Major Falcon and the tennis champion\r\nwere the Judges. So Dorothy and I won the prizes. I mean I really hope\r\nI do not get any more large size imitations of a dog as I have three\r\nnow and I do not see why the Captain does not ask Mr. Cartier to have a\r\njewelry store on the ship as it is really not much fun to go shopping\r\non a ship with gentlemen, and buy nothing but imitations of dogs.\r\n\r\nSo after we won the prizes I had an engagement to go up on the top of\r\nthe deck with Mr. Bartlett as it seems he likes to look at the\r\nmoonlight quite a lot. So I told him to go up and wait for me and I\r\nwould be up later as I promised a dance to Mr. Mountginz. So he asked\r\nme how long I would be dancing till, but I told him to wait up there\r\nand he would find out. So Mr. Mountginz and I had quite a delightful\r\ndance and champagne until Major Falcon found us. Because he was looking\r\nfor me and he said I really should not keep Mr. Bartlett waiting. So I\r\nwent up on the deck and Mr. Bartlett was up there waiting for me and it\r\nseems that he really is madly in love with me because he did not sleep\r\na wink since we became friendly. Because he never thought that I really\r\nhad brains but now that he knows it, it seems that he has been looking\r\nfor a girl like me for years, and he said that really the place for me\r\nwhen he got back home was Washington d. c. where he lives. So I told\r\nhim I thought a thing like that was nearly always the result of fate.\r\nSo he wanted me to get off the ship tomorrow at France and take the\r\nsame trip that he is taking to Vienna as it seems that Vienna is in\r\nFrance and if you go on to England you go to far. But I told him that I\r\ncould not because I thought that if he was really madly in love with me\r\nhe would take a trip to London instead. But he told me that he had\r\nserious business in Vienna that was a very, very great secret. But I\r\ntold him I did not believe it was business but that it really was some\r\ngirl, because what business could be so important? So he said it was\r\nbusiness for the United States government at Washington and he could\r\nnot tell anybody what it was. So then we looked at the moonlight quite\r\na lot. So I told him I would go to Vienna if I really knew it was\r\nbusiness and not some girl, because I could not see how business could\r\nbe so important. So then he told me all about it. So it seems that\r\nUncle Sam wants some new aeroplanes that everybody else seems to want,\r\nespecially England, and Uncle Sam has quite a clever way to get them\r\nwhich is to long to put in my diary. So we sat up and saw the sun rise\r\nand I became quite stiff and told him I would have to go down to my\r\nroom because, after all, the ship lands at France today and I said if I\r\ngot off the boat at France to go to Vienna with him I would have to\r\npack up.\r\n\r\nSo I went down to my room and went to bed. So then Dorothy came in and\r\nshe was up on the deck with the tennis champion but she did not notice\r\nthe sun rise as she really does not love nature but always wastes her\r\ntime and ruins her clothes even though I always tell her not to drink\r\nchampagne out of a bottle on the deck of the ship as it lurches quite a\r\nlot. So I am going to have luncheon in my room and I will send a note\r\nto Mr. Bartlett to tell him I will not be able to get off the boat at\r\nFrance to go to Vienna with him as I have quite a headache, but I will\r\nsee him sometime somewhere else. So Major Falcon is going to come down\r\nat 12 and I have got to thinking over what Mr. Bartlett called me at\r\nLittle Rock and I am quite upset. I mean a gentleman never pays for\r\nthose things but a girl always pays. So I think I will tell Major\r\nFalcon all about the airoplane business as he really wants to know.\r\nAnd, after all I do not think Mr. Bartlett is a gentleman to call me\r\nall those names in Little Rock even if it was seven years ago. I mean\r\nMajor Falcon is always a gentleman and he really wants to do quite a\r\nlot for us in London. Because he knows the Prince of Wales and he\r\nthinks that Dorothy and I would like the Prince of Wales once we had\r\nreally got to meet him. So I am going to stay in my room until Mr.\r\nBartlett gets off the ship at France, because I really do not seem to\r\ncare if I never see Mr. Bartlett again.\r\n\r\nSo tomorrow we will be at England bright and early. And I really feel\r\nquite thrilled because Mr. Eisman sent me a cable this morning, as he\r\ndoes every morning, and he says to take advantage of everybody we meet\r\nas traveling is the highest form of education. I mean Mr. Eisman is\r\nalways right and Major Falcon knows all the sights in London including\r\nthe Prince of Wales so it really looks like Dorothy and I would have\r\nquite a delightful time in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\nLONDON IS REALLY NOTHING\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 17th:\r\n\r\nWell, Dorothy and I are really at London. I mean we got to London on\r\nthe train yesterday as the boat does not come clear up to London but it\r\nstops on the beach and you have to take a train. I mean everything is\r\nmuch better in New York, because the boat comes right up to New York\r\nand I am really beginning to think that London is not so educational\r\nafter all. But I did not tell Mr. Eisman when I cabled him last night\r\nbecause Mr. Eisman really sent me to London to get educated and I would\r\nhate to tell him that London is a failure because we know more in New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy and I came to the Ritz and it is delightfully full of\r\nAmericans. I mean you would really think it was New York because I\r\nalways think that the most delightful thing about traveling is to\r\nalways be running into Americans and to always feel at home.\r\n\r\nSo yesterday Dorothy and I went down to luncheon at the Ritz and we saw\r\na quite cute little blond girl at the next table and I nudged Dorothy\r\nunder the table, because I do not think it is nice to nudge a person on\r\ntop of the table as I am trying to teach good manners to Dorothy. So I\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9cThat is quite a cute little girl so she must be an American\r\ngirl.\xe2\x80\x9d And sure enough she called the head-waiter with quite an\r\nAmerican accent and she was quite angry and she said to him, I have\r\nbeen coming to this hotel for 35 years and this is the first time I\r\nhave been kept waiting. So I recognized her voice because it was really\r\nFanny Ward. So we asked her to come over to our table and we were all\r\nthree delighted to see each other. Because I and Fanny have known each\r\nother for about five years but I really feel as if I knew her better\r\nbecause mama knew her 45 years ago when she and mama used to go to\r\nschool together and mama used to always follow all her weddings in all\r\nthe newspapers. So now Fanny lives in London and is famous for being\r\none of the cutest girls in London. I mean Fanny is almost historical,\r\nbecause when a girl is cute for 50 years it really begins to get\r\nhistorical.\r\n\r\nSo if mama did not die of hardening of the arterys she and Fanny and I\r\ncould have quite a delightful time in London as Fanny loves to shop. So\r\nwe went shopping for hats and instead of going to the regular shop we\r\nwent to the childrens department and Fanny and I bought some quite cute\r\nhats as childrens hats only cost half as much and Fanny does it all the\r\ntime. I mean Fanny really loves hats and she buys some in the\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s department every week, so she really saves quite a lot of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nSo we came back to the Ritz to meet Major Falcon because Major Falcon\r\ninvited us to go to tea with him at a girls house called Lady Shelton.\r\nSo Major Falcon invited Fanny to go with us to, but she was sorry\r\nbecause she had to go to her music lesson.\r\n\r\nSo at Lady Sheltons house we met quite a few people who seemed to be\r\nEnglish. I mean some of the girls in London seem to be Ladies which\r\nseems to be the opposite of a Lord. And some who are not Ladies are\r\nhonorable. But quite a few are not Ladies or honorable either, but are\r\njust like us, so all you have to call them is \xe2\x80\x9cMiss.\xe2\x80\x9d So Lady Shelton\r\nwas really delighted to have we Americans come to her house. I mean she\r\ntook Dorothy and I into the back parlor and tried to sell us some shell\r\nflowers she seems to make out of sea shells for 25 pounds. So we asked\r\nher how much it was in money and it seems it is 125 dollars. I mean I\r\nam really going to have a quite hard time in London with Dorothy\r\nbecause she really should not say to an English lady what she said. I\r\nmean she should not say to an English lady that in America we use\r\nshells the same way only we put a dry pea under one of them and we call\r\nit a game. But I told Lady Shelton we really did not need any shell\r\nflowers. So Lady Shelton said she knew we Americans loved dogs so she\r\nwould love us to meet her mother.\r\n\r\nSo then she took Dorothy and Major Falcon and I to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s house\r\nwhich was just around the corner from her house. Because her mother\r\nseems to be called a Countess and raise dogs. So her mother was having\r\na party too, and she seemed to have quite red hair and quite a lot of\r\npaint for such an elderly lady. So the first thing she asked us was she\r\nasked us if we bought some shell flowers from her daughter. So we told\r\nher no. But she did not seem to act like a Countess of her elderly age\r\nshould act. Because she said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou were right my dears\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t let my\r\ndaughter stick you\xe2\x80\x94they fall apart in less than a week.\xe2\x80\x9d So then she\r\nasked us if we would like to buy a dog. I mean I could not stop Dorothy\r\nbut she said \xe2\x80\x9cHow long before the dogs fall apart?\xe2\x80\x9d But I do not think\r\nthe Countess acted like a Countess ought to act because she laughed\r\nvery, very loud and she said that Dorothy was really priceless and she\r\ngrabbed Dorothy and kissed her and held her arm around her all the\r\ntime. I mean I really think that a Countess should not encouradge\r\nDorothy or else she is just as unrefined as Dorothy seems to be. But I\r\ntold the Countess that we did not need any dog.\r\n\r\nSo then I met quite a delightful English lady who had a very, very\r\nbeautiful diamond tiara in her hand bag because she said that she\r\nthought some Americans would be at the party and it was really a very,\r\nvery great bargain. I mean I think a diamond tiara is delightful\r\nbecause it is a place where I really never thought of wearing diamonds\r\nbefore, and I thought I had almost one of everything until I saw a\r\ndiamond tiara. The English lady who is called Mrs. Weeks said it was in\r\nher family for years but the good thing about diamonds is they always\r\nlook new. So I was really very intreeged and I asked her how much it\r\ncost in money and it seems it was $7,500.\r\n\r\nSo then I looked around the room and I noticed a gentleman who seemed\r\nto be quite well groomed. So I asked Major Falcon who he was and he\r\nsaid he was called Sir Francis Beekman and it seems he is very, very\r\nwealthy. So then I asked Major Falcon to give us an introduction to one\r\nanother and we met one another and I asked Sir Francis Beekman if he\r\nwould hold my hat while I could try on the diamond tiara because I\r\ncould wear it backwards with a ribbon, on account of my hair being\r\nhobbed, and I told Sir Francis Beekman that I really thought it looked\r\nquite cute. So he thought it did to, but he seemed to have another\r\nengagement. So the Countess came up to me and she is really very\r\nunrefined because she said to me \xe2\x80\x9cDo not waste your time on him\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbecause she said that whenever Sir Francis Beekman spent a haypenny the\r\nstatue of a gentleman called Mr. Nelson took off his hat and bowed. I\r\nmean some people are so unrefined they seem to have unrefined thoughts\r\nabout everything.\r\n\r\nSo I really have my heart set on the diamond tiara and I became quite\r\nworried because Mrs. Weeks said she was going to a delightful party\r\nlast night that would be full of delightful Americans and it would be\r\nsnaped up. So I was so worried that I gave her 100 dollars and she is\r\ngoing to hold the diamond tiara for me. Because what is the use of\r\ntraveling if you do not take advantadge of oportunities and it really\r\nis quite unusual to get a bargain from an English lady. So last night I\r\ncabled Mr. Eisman and I told Mr. Eisman that he does not seem to how\r\nknow much it costs to get educated by traveling and I said I really\r\nwould have to have $10,000 and I said I hoped I would not have to\r\nborrow the money from some strange English gentleman, even if he might\r\nbe very very good looking. So I really could not sleep all night\r\nbecause of all of my worrying because if I do not get the money to buy\r\nthe diamond tiara it may be a quite hard thing to get back $100 from an\r\nEnglish lady.\r\n\r\nSo now I must really get dressed as Major Falcon is going to take\r\nDorothy and I to look at all the sights in London. But I really think\r\nif I do not get the diamond tiara my whole trip to London will be quite\r\na failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 18th:\r\n\r\nYesterday was quite a day and night. I mean Major Falcon came to take\r\nDorothy and I to see all the sights in London. So I thought it would be\r\ndelightful if we had another gentleman and I made Major Falcon call up\r\nSir Francis Beekman. I mean I had a cable from Mr. Eisman which told me\r\nhe could not send me 10,000 dollars but he would send me 1000 dollars\r\nwhich really would not be a drop in the bucket for the diamond tiara.\r\nSo Sir Francis Beekman said that he could not come but I teased him and\r\nteased him over the telephone so he finally said he would come.\r\n\r\nSo Major Falcon drives his own car so Dorothy sat with him and I sat\r\nwith Sir Francis Beekman but I told him that I was not going to call\r\nhim Sir Francis Beekman but I was really going to call him Piggie.\r\n\r\nIn London they make a very, very great fuss over nothing at all. I mean\r\nLondon is really nothing at all. For instants, they make a great fuss\r\nover a tower that really is not even as tall as the Hickox building in\r\nLittle Rock Arkansas and it would only make a chimney on one of our\r\ntowers in New York. So Sir Francis Beekman wanted us to get out and\r\nlook at the tower because he said that quite a famous Queen had her\r\nhead cut off there one morning and Dorothy said \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool she was to\r\nget up that morning\xe2\x80\x9d and that is really the only sensible thing that\r\nDorothy has said in London. So we did not bother to get out.\r\n\r\nSo we did not go to any more sights because they really have delicious\r\nchampagne cocktails at a very very smart new restaurant called the Cafe\r\nde Paris that you could not get in New York for neither love or money\r\nand I told Piggie that when you are travelling you really ought to take\r\nadvantadges of what you can not do at home.\r\n\r\nSo while Dorothy and I were in the Cafe de Paris powdering our nose in\r\nthe lady\xe2\x80\x99s dressing room we met an American girl who Dorothy knew in\r\nthe Follies, but now she is living in London. So she told us all about\r\nLondon. So it seems the gentlemen in London have quite a quaint custom\r\nof not giving a girl many presents. I mean the English girls really\r\nseem to be satisfied with a gold cigaret holder or else what they call\r\na \xe2\x80\x98bangle\xe2\x80\x99 which means a bracelet in English which is only gold and\r\ndoes not have any stones in it which American girls would really give\r\nto their maid. So she said you could tell what English gentlemen were\r\nlike when you realize that not even English ladys could get anything\r\nout of them. So she said Sir Francis Beekman was really famous all over\r\nLondon for not spending so much money as most English gentlemen. So\r\nthen Dorothy and I said goodbye to Dorothy\xe2\x80\x99s girl friend and Dorothy\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cLets tell our two boy friends that we have a headache and go\r\nback to the Ritz, where men are Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d Because Dorothy said that\r\nthe society of a gentleman like Sir Francis Beekman was to great a\r\nprice to pay for a couple of rounds of champagne cocktails. But I told\r\nDorothy that I always believe that there is nothing like trying and I\r\nthink it would be nice for an American girl like I to educate an\r\nEnglish gentleman like Piggie, as I call Sir Francis Beekman.\r\n\r\nSo then we went back to the table and I almost have to admit that\r\nDorothy is in the right about Piggie because he really likes to talk\r\nquite a lot and he is always talking about a friend of his who was\r\nquite a famous King in London called King Edward. So Piggie said he\r\nwould never never forget the jokes King Edward was always saying and he\r\nwould never forget one time they were all on a yacht and they were all\r\nsitting at a table and King Edward got up and said \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care what\r\nyou gentlemen do\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m going to smoke a cigar.\xe2\x80\x9d So then Piggie laughed\r\nvery, very loud. So of course I laughed very, very loud and I told\r\nPiggie he was wonderful the way he could tell jokes. I mean you can\r\nalways tell when to laugh because Piggie always laughs first.\r\n\r\nSo in the afternoon a lot of lady friends of Mrs. Weeks heard about me\r\nbuying the diamond tiara and called us up and asked us to their house\r\nto tea so Dorothy and I went and we took a gentleman Dorothy met in the\r\nlobby who is very, very good looking but he is only an English ballroom\r\ndancer in a cafe when he has a job.\r\n\r\nSo we went to tea to a lady\xe2\x80\x99s house called Lady Elmsworth and what she\r\nhas to sell we Americans seems to be a picture of her father painted in\r\noil paint who she said was a whistler. But I told her my own father was\r\na whistler and used to whistle all of the time and I did not even have\r\na picture of him but every time he used to go to Little Rock I asked\r\nhim to go to the photographers but he did not go.\r\n\r\nSo then we met a lady called Lady Chizzleby that wanted us to go to her\r\nhouse to tea but we told her that we really did not want to buy\r\nanything. But she said that she did not have anything to sell but she\r\nwanted to borrow five pounds. So we did not go and I am really glad\r\nthat Mr. Eisman did not come to London as all the English ladys would\r\nask him to tea and he would have a whole ship load of shell flowers and\r\ndogs and anteek pictures that do nobody any good.\r\n\r\nSo last night Piggie and I and Dorothy and the dancer who is called\r\nGerald went to the Kit Kat Club as Gerald had nothing better to do\r\nbecause he is out of a job. So Dorothy and I had quite a little quarrel\r\nbecause I told Dorothy that she was wasting quite a lot of time going\r\nwith any gentleman who is out of a job but Dorothy is always getting to\r\nreally like somebody and she will never learn how to act. I mean I\r\nalways seem to think that when a girl really enjoys being with a\r\ngentleman, it puts her to quite a disadvantage and no real good can\r\ncome of it.\r\n\r\nWell tonight is going to be quite a night because Major Falcon is going\r\nto take Dorothy and I to a dance at a lady\xe2\x80\x99s house tonight to meet the\r\nPrince of Wales. And now I must get ready to see Piggie because he and\r\nI seem to be getting to be quite good friends even if he has not sent\r\nme any flowers yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 19th:\r\n\r\nLast night we really met the Prince of Wales. I mean Major Falcon\r\ncalled for Dorothy and I at eleven and took us to a ladys house where\r\nthe lady was having a party. The Prince of Wales is really wonderful. I\r\nmean even if he was not a prince he would be wonderful, because even if\r\nhe was not a prince, he would be able to make his living playing the\r\nukelele, if he had a little more practice. So the lady came up to me\r\nand told me that the Prince of Wales would like to meet me, so she gave\r\nus an introduction to one another and I was very very thrilled when he\r\nasked me for a dance. So I decided I would write down every word he\r\nsaid to me in my diary so I could always go back and read it over and\r\nover when I am really old. So then we started to dance and I asked him\r\nif he was still able to be fond of horses, and he said he was. So after\r\nour dance was all over he asked Dorothy for a dance but Dorothy will\r\nnever learn how to act in front of a prince. Because she handed me her\r\nfan and she said \xe2\x80\x9cHold this while I slip a new page into English\r\nhistry,\xe2\x80\x9d right in front of the Prince of Wales. So I was very very\r\nworried while Dorothy was dancing with the Prince of Wales because she\r\ntalked to the Prince of Wales all the time and when she got through the\r\nPrince of Wales wrote some of the slang words she is always saying on\r\nhis cuff, so if he tells the Queen some day to be \xe2\x80\x98a good Elk\xe2\x80\x99 or some\r\nother slang word Dorothy is always saying, the Queen will really blame\r\nme for bringing such a girl into English society. So when Dorothy came\r\nback we had quite a little quarrel because Dorothy said that since I\r\nmet the Prince of Wales I was becoming too English. But really, I mean\r\nto say, I often remember papa back in Arkansas and he often used to say\r\nthat his grandpa came from a place in England called Australia, so\r\nreally, I mean to say, it is no wonder that the English seems to come\r\nout of me sometimes. Because if a girl seems to have an English accent\r\nI really think it is quite jolly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 20th:\r\n\r\nYesterday afternoon I really thought I ought to begin to educate Piggie\r\nhow to act with a girl like American gentlemen act with a girl. So I\r\nasked him to come up to have tea in our sitting room in the hotel\r\nbecause I had quite a headache. I mean I really look quite cute in my\r\npink negligay. So I sent out a bell hop friend of Dorothy and I who is\r\nquite a nice boy who is called Harry and who we talk to quite a lot. So\r\nI gave Harry ten pounds of English money and I told him to go to the\r\nmost expensive florist and to buy some very very expensive orchids for\r\n10 pounds and to bring them to our sitting room at fifteen minutes past\r\nfive and not to say a word but to say they were for me. So Piggie came\r\nto tea and we were having tea when Harry came in and he did not say a\r\nword but he gave me a quite large box and he said it was for me. So I\r\nopened the box and sure enough they were a dozen very very beautiful\r\norchids. So I looked for a card, but of course there was no card so I\r\ngrabbed Piggie and I said I would have to give him quite a large hug\r\nbecause it must have been him. But he said it was not him. But I said\r\nit must be him because I said that there was only one gentleman in\r\nLondon who was so sweet and generous and had such a large heart to send\r\na girl one dozen orchids like him. So he still said it was not him. But\r\nI said I knew it was him, because there was not a gentleman in London\r\nso really marvelous and so wonderful and such a marvelous gentleman to\r\nsend a girl one dozen orchids every day as him. So I really had to\r\napologize for giving him such a large hug but I told him I was so full\r\nof impulses that when I knew he was going to send me one dozen orchids\r\nevery day I became so impulsive I could not help it!\r\n\r\nSo then Dorothy and Gerald came in and I told them all about what a\r\nwonderful gentleman Piggie turned out to be and I told them when a\r\ngentleman sent a girl one dozen orchids every day he really reminded me\r\nof a prince. So Piggie blushed quite a lot and he was really very very\r\npleased and he did not say any more that it was not him. So then I\r\nstarted to make a fuss over him and I told him he would have to look\r\nout because he was really so good looking and I was so full of impulses\r\nthat I might even lose my mind some time and give him a kiss. So Piggie\r\nreally felt very very good to be such a good looking gentleman. So he\r\ncould not help blushing all the time and he could not help grinning all\r\nthe time from one ear to another. So he asked us all to dinner and then\r\nhe and Gerald went to change their clothes for dinner. So Dorothy and I\r\nhad quite a little quarrel after they went because Dorothy asked me\r\nwhich one of the Jesse James brothers was my father. But I told her I\r\nwas not so unrefined that I would waste my time with any gentleman who\r\nwas only a ballroom dancer when he had a job. So Dorothy said Gerald\r\nwas a gentleman because he wrote her a note and it had a crest. So I\r\ntold her to try and eat it. So then we had to get dressed.\r\n\r\nSo this morning Harry, the boy friend of ours who is the bell hop,\r\nwaked me up at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock because he had a box of one dozen orchids\r\nfrom Piggie. So by the time Piggie pays for a few dozen orchids, the\r\ndiamond tiara will really seem like quite a bargain. Because I always\r\nthink that spending money is only just a habit and if you get a\r\ngentleman started on buying one dozen orchids at a time he really gets\r\nvery good habits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 21st:\r\n\r\nWell, yesterday afternoon I took Piggie shopping on a street called\r\nBond Street. So I took him to a jewelery store because I told him I had\r\nto have a silver picture frame because I had to have a picture of him\r\nto go in it. Because I told Piggie that when a girl gets to know such a\r\ngood looking gentleman as him she really wants to have a picture of him\r\non her dressing table where she can look at it a lot. So Piggie became\r\nquite intreeged. So we looked at all the silver picture frames. But\r\nthen I told him that I really did not think a silver picture frame was\r\ngood enough for a picture of him because I forgot that they had gold\r\npicture frames until I saw them. So then we started to look at the gold\r\npicture frames. So then it came out that his picture was taken in his\r\nunaform. So I said he must be so good looking in his unaform that I\r\nreally did not think even the gold picture frames were good enough but\r\nthey did not have any platinum picture frames so we had to buy the best\r\none we could.\r\n\r\nSo then I asked him if he could put on his unaform tomorrow because I\r\nwould love to see him in his unaform and we could go to tea at Mrs.\r\nWeeks. So he really became very pleased because he grinned quite a lot\r\nand he said that he would. So then I said that poor little I would\r\nreally look like nothing at all to be going out with him in his\r\ngeorgous unaform. So then we started to look at some bracelets but a\r\nlady friend of his who is quite friendly with his wife, who is in their\r\ncountry house in the country, came in to the store, so Piggie became\r\nquite nervous to be caught in a jewelery store where he has not been\r\nfor years and years, so we had to go out.\r\n\r\nThis morning Gerald called up Dorothy and he said that day after\r\ntomorrow they are having a theatrical garden party to sell things to\r\npeople for charity so he asked if Dorothy and I would be one of the\r\nones who sells things to people for charity. So we said we would.\r\n\r\nSo now I must telephone Mrs. Weeks and say I will bring Sir Francis\r\nBeekman to tea tomorrow and I hope it all comes out all right. But I\r\nreally wish Piggie would not tell so many storys. I mean I do not mind\r\na gentleman when he tells a great many storys if they are new, but a\r\ngentleman who tells a great many storys and they are all the same\r\nstorys is quite enervating. I mean London is really so uneducational\r\nthat all I seem to be learning is some of Piggies storys and I even\r\nwant to forget them. So I am really becoming jolly well fed up with\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 22nd:\r\n\r\nYesterday Piggie came in his unaform but he was really quite upset\r\nbecause he had a letter. I mean his wife is coming to London because\r\nshe always comes to London every year to get her old clothes made over\r\nas she has a girl who does it very very cheap. So she is going to stay\r\nwith the lady who saw us in the jewelery store, because it always saves\r\nmoney to stay with a friend. So I wanted to cheer Piggie up so I told\r\nhim that I did not think the lady saw us and if she did see us, she\r\nreally could not believe her eyes to see him in a jewelery store. But I\r\ndid not tell him that I think that Dorothy and I had better go to Paris\r\nsoon. Because, after all, Piggie\xe2\x80\x99s society is beginning to tell on a\r\ngirls nerves. But I really made Piggie feel quite good about his\r\nunaform because I told him I only felt fit to be with him in a diamond\r\ntiara. So then I told him that, even if his wife was in London, we\r\ncould still be friends, because I could not help but admire him even if\r\nhis wife was in London and I told him I really thought a thing like\r\nthat was nearly always the result of fate. So then we went to tea at\r\nMrs. Weeks. So Piggie arranged with Mrs. Weeks to pay her for the\r\ndiamond tiara and she nearly fell dead but she will keep it a secret\r\nbecause no one would believe it anyway. So now I have the diamond tiara\r\nand I have to admit that everything always turns out for the best. But\r\nI promised Piggie that I would always stay in London and we would\r\nalways be friendly. Because Piggie always says that I am the only one\r\nwho admires him for what he really is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 25th:\r\n\r\nWell, we were so busy the last days I did not have time to write in my\r\ndiary because now we are on a ship that seems to be quite a small ship\r\nto be sailing to Paris and we will be at Paris this afternoon. Because\r\nit does not take nearly so long to come to Paris as it does to come to\r\nLondon. I mean it seems quite unusual to think that it takes 6 days to\r\ncome to London and only one day to come to Paris.\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy is quite upset because she did not want to come as she is\r\nmadly in love with Gerald and Gerald said that we really ought not to\r\nleave London without going to see England while we happened to be here.\r\nBut I told him that if England was the same kind of a place that London\r\nseems to be, I really know to much to bother with such a place. I mean\r\nwe had quite a little quarrel because Gerald showed up at the station\r\nwith a bangle for Dorothy so I told Dorothy she was well rid of such a\r\nperson. So Dorothy had to come with me because Mr. Eisman is paying her\r\nexpenses because he wants Dorothy to be my chaperone.\r\n\r\nSo the last thing in London was the garden party. I sold quite a lot of\r\nred baloons and I sold a red baloon to Harry Lauder the famous Scotch\r\ngentleman who is the famous Scotch tenor for 20 pounds. So Dorothy said\r\nI did not need to buy any ticket to Paris on the boat because if I\r\ncould do that, I could walk across the channel.\r\n\r\nSo Piggy does not know that we have gone but I sent him a letter and\r\ntold him I would see him some time again some time. And I was really\r\nglad to get out of our rooms at the Ritz\xe2\x80\x94I mean 50 or 60 orchids really\r\nmake a girl think of a funeral. So I cabled Mr. Eisman and I told him\r\nwe could not learn anything in London because we knew to much, so if we\r\nwent to Paris at least we could learn French, if we made up our mind to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSo I am really very very intreeged as I have heard so much about Paris\r\nand I feel that it must be much more educational than London and I can\r\nhardly wait to see the Ritz hotel in Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\nPARIS IS DEVINE\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 27th:\r\n\r\nParis is devine. I mean Dorothy and I got to Paris yesterday, and it\r\nreally is devine. Because the French are devine. Because when we were\r\ncoming off the boat, and we were coming through the customs, it was\r\nquite hot and it seemed to smell quite a lot and all the French\r\ngentlemen in the customs, were squealing quite a lot. So I looked\r\naround and I picked out a French gentleman who was really in a very\r\ngorgeous uniform and he seemed to be a very, very important gentleman\r\nand I gave him twenty francs worth of French money and he was very very\r\ngallant and he knocked everybody else down and took our bags right\r\nthrough the custom. Because I really think that twenty Francs is quite\r\ncheap for a gentleman that has got on at least $100 worth of gold braid\r\non his coat alone, to speak nothing of his trousers.\r\n\r\nI mean the French gentlemen always seem to be squealing quite a lot,\r\nespecially taxi drivers when they only get a small size yellow dime\r\ncalled a \xe2\x80\x98fifty santeems\xe2\x80\x99 for a tip. But the good thing about French\r\ngentlemen is that every time a French gentleman starts in to squeal,\r\nyou can always stop him with five francs, no matter who he is. I mean\r\nit is so refreshing to listen to a French gentleman stop squeaking,\r\nthat it would really be quite a bargain even for ten francs.\r\n\r\nSo we came to the Ritz Hotel and the Ritz Hotel is devine. Because when\r\na girl can sit in a delightful bar and have delicious champagne\r\ncocktails and look at all the important French people in Paris, I think\r\nit is devine. I mean when a girl can sit there and look at the Dolly\r\nsisters and Pearl White and Maybelle Gilman Corey, and Mrs. Nash, it is\r\nbeyond worlds. Because when a girl looks at Mrs. Nash and realizes what\r\nMrs. Nash has got out of gentlemen, it really makes a girl hold her\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nAnd when a girl walks around and reads all of the signs with all of the\r\nfamous historical names it really makes you hold your breath. Because\r\nwhen Dorothy and I went on a walk, we only walked a few blocks but in\r\nonly a few blocks we read all of the famous historical names, like Coty\r\nand Cartier and I knew we were seeing something educational at last and\r\nour whole trip was not a failure. I mean I really try to make Dorothy\r\nget educated and have reverance. So when we stood at the corner of a\r\nplace called the Place Vandome, if you turn your back on a monument\r\nthey have in the middle and look up, you can see none other than Coty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsign. So I said to Dorothy, does it not really give you a thrill to\r\nrealize that that is the historical spot where Mr. Coty makes all the\r\nperfume? So then Dorothy said that she supposed Mr. Coty came to Paris\r\nand he smelled Paris and he realized that something had to be done. So\r\nDorothy will really never have any reverance.\r\n\r\nSo then we saw a jewelry store and we saw some jewelry in the window\r\nand it really seemed to be a very very great bargain but the price\r\nmarks all had francs on them and Dorothy and I do not seem to be\r\nmathematical enough to tell how much francs is in money. So we went in\r\nand asked and it seems it was only 20 dollars and it seems it is not\r\ndiamonds but it is a thing called \xe2\x80\x9cpaste\xe2\x80\x9d which is the name of a word\r\nwhich means imitations. So Dorothy said \xe2\x80\x9cpaste\xe2\x80\x9d is the name of the word\r\na girl ought to do to a gentleman that handed her one. I mean I would\r\nreally be embarrassed, but the gentleman did not seem to understand\r\nDorothy\xe2\x80\x99s english.\r\n\r\nSo it really makes a girl feel depressed to think a girl could not tell\r\nthat it was nothing but an imitation. I mean a gentleman could deceeve\r\na girl because he could give her a present and it would only be worth\r\n20 dollars. So when Mr. Eisman comes to Paris next week, if he wants to\r\nmake me a present I will make him take me along with him because he is\r\nreally quite an inveteran bargain hunter at heart. So the gentleman at\r\nthe jewelry store said that quite a lot of famous girls in Paris had\r\nimitations of all their jewelry and they put the jewelry in the safe\r\nand they really wore the imitations, so they could wear it and have a\r\ngood time. But I told him I thought that any girl who was a lady would\r\nnot even think of having such a good time that she did not remember to\r\nhang on to her jewelry.\r\n\r\nSo then we went back to the Ritz and unpacked our trunks with the aid\r\nof really a delightful waiter who brought us up some delicious luncheon\r\nand who is called Leon and who speaks english almost like an American\r\nand who Dorothy and I talk to quite a lot. So Leon said that we ought\r\nnot to stay around the Ritz all of the time, but we really ought to see\r\nParis. So Dorothy said she would go down in the lobby and meet some\r\ngentleman to show us Paris. So in a couple of minutes she called up on\r\nthe telephone from the lobby and she said \xe2\x80\x9cI have got a French bird\r\ndown here who is a French title nobleman, who is called a veecount so\r\ncome on down.\xe2\x80\x9d So I said \xe2\x80\x9cHow did a Frenchman get into the Ritz.\xe2\x80\x9d So\r\nDorothy said \xe2\x80\x9cHe came in to get out of the rain and he has not noticed\r\nthat it is stopped.\xe2\x80\x9d So I said \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you have picked up something\r\nwithout taxi fare as usual. Why did you not get an American gentleman\r\nwho always have money?\xe2\x80\x9d So Dorothy said she thought a French gentleman\r\nhad ought to know Paris better. So I said \xe2\x80\x9cHe does not even know it is\r\nnot raining.\xe2\x80\x9d But I went down.\r\n\r\nSo the veecount was really delightful after all. So then we rode around\r\nand we saw Paris and we saw how devine it really is. I mean the Eyefull\r\nTower is devine and it is much more educational than the London Tower,\r\nbecause you can not even see the London Tower if you happen to be two\r\nblocks away. But when a girl looks at the Eyefull Tower she really\r\nknows she is looking at something. And it would even be very difficult\r\nnot to notice the Eyefull Tower.\r\n\r\nSo then we went to a place called the Madrid to tea and it really was\r\ndevine. I mean we saw the Dolley Sisters and Pearl White and Mrs. Corey\r\nand Mrs. Nash all over again.\r\n\r\nSo then we went to dinner and then we went to Momart and it really was\r\ndevine because we saw them all over again. I mean in Momart they have\r\ngenuine American jazz bands and quite a lot of New York people which we\r\nknew and you really would think you were in New York and it was devine.\r\nSo we came back to the Ritz quite late. So Dorothy and I had quite a\r\nlittle quarrel because Dorothy said that when we were looking at Paris\r\nI asked the French veecount what was the name of the unknown soldier\r\nwho is buried under quite a large monument. So I said I really did not\r\nmean to ask him, if I did, because what I did mean to ask him was, what\r\nwas the name of his mother because it is always the mother of a dead\r\nsoldier that I always seem to think about more than the dead soldier\r\nthat has died.\r\n\r\nSo the French veecount is going to call up in the morning but I am not\r\ngoing to see him again. Because French gentlemen are really quite\r\ndeceeving. I mean they take you to quite cute places and they make you\r\nfeel quite good about yourself and you really seem to have a delightful\r\ntime but when you get home and come to think it all over, all you have\r\ngot is a fan that only cost 20 francs and a doll that they gave you\r\naway for nothing in a restaurant. I mean a girl has to look out in\r\nParis, or she would have such a good time in Paris that she would not\r\nget anywheres. So I really think that American gentlemen are the best\r\nafter all, because kissing your hand may make you feel very very good\r\nbut a diamond and safire bracelet lasts forever. Besides, I do not\r\nthink that I ought to go out with any gentlemen in Paris because Mr.\r\nEisman will be here next week and he told me that the only kind of\r\ngentlemen he wants me to go out with are intelectual gentlemen who are\r\ngood for a girls brains. So I really do not seem to see many gentlemen\r\naround the Ritz who seem to look like they would be good for a girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrains. So tomorrow we are going to go shopping and I suppose it would\r\nreally be to much to expect to find a gentleman who would look to Mr.\r\nEisman like he was good for a girls brains and at the same time he\r\nwould like to take us shopping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 29th:\r\n\r\nYesterday was quite a day. I mean Dorothy and I were getting ready to\r\ngo shopping and the telephone rang and they said that Lady Francis\r\nBeekman was down stairs and she wanted to come up stairs. So I really\r\nwas quite surprised. I mean I did not know what to say, so I said all\r\nright. So then I told Dorothy and then we put our brains together.\r\nBecause it seems that Lady Francis Beekman is the wife of the gentleman\r\ncalled Sir Francis Beekman who was the admirer of mine in London who\r\nseemed to admire me so much that he asked me if he could make me a\r\npresent of a diamond tiara. So it seemed as if his wife must have heard\r\nabout it, and it really seemed as if she must have come clear over from\r\nLondon about it. So there was a very very loud knock at the door so we\r\nasked her to come in. So Lady Francis Beekman came in and she is a\r\nquite large size lady who seems to resemble Bill Hart quite a lot. I\r\nmean Dorothy thinks that Lady Francis Beeckman resembles Bill Hart\r\nquite a lot, only she really thinks she looks more like Bill Hart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhorse. So it seems that she said that if I did not give her back the\r\ndiamond tiara right away, she would make quite a fuss and she would\r\nruin my reputation. Because she said that something really must be\r\nwrong about the whole thing. Because it seems that Sir Francis Beekman\r\nand she have been married for 35 years and the last present he gave to\r\nher was a wedding ring. So Dorothy spoke up and she said \xe2\x80\x9cLady you\r\ncould no more ruin my girl friends reputation than you could sink the\r\nJewish fleet.\xe2\x80\x9d I mean I was quite proud of Dorothy the way she stood up\r\nfor my reputation. Because I really think that there is nothing so\r\nwonderful as two girls when they stand up for each other and help each\r\nother a lot. Because no matter how vigarous Lady Francis Beekman seems\r\nto be, she had to realize that she could not sink a whole fleet full of\r\nships. So she had to stop talking against my reputation.\r\n\r\nSo then she said she would drag it into the court and she would say\r\nthat it was undue influence. So I said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you wear that hat\r\ninto a court, we will see if the judge thinks it took an undue\r\ninfluence to make Sir Francis Beekman look at a girl.\xe2\x80\x9d So then Dorothy\r\nspoke up and Dorothy said \xe2\x80\x9cMy girl friend is right, Lady. You have got\r\nto be the Queen of England to get away with a hat like that.\xe2\x80\x9d So Lady\r\nFrancis Beekman seemed to get quite angry. So then she said she would\r\nsend for Sir Francis Beekman where he suddenly went to Scotland, to go\r\nhunting when he found out that Lady Francis Beekman had found out. So\r\nDorothy said \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that you have left Sir Francis Beekman loose\r\nwith all those spendthrifts down in Scotland?\xe2\x80\x9d So Dorothy said she\r\nwould better look out or he would get together with the boys some night\r\nand simply massacre a haypenny. I mean I always encouradge Dorothy to\r\ntalk quite a lot when we are talking to unrefined people like Lady\r\nFrancis Beekman, because Dorothy speaks their own languadge to\r\nunrefined people better than a refined girl like I. So Dorothy said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better not send for Sir Francis Beekman because if my girl\r\nfriend really wanted to turn loose on Sir Francis Beekman, all he would\r\nhave left would be his title.\xe2\x80\x9d So then I spoke right up and said Yes\r\nthat I was an American girl and we American girls do not care about a\r\ntitle because we American girls always say that what is good enough for\r\nWashington is good enough for us. So Lady Francis Beekman really seemed\r\nto get more angry and more angry all of the time.\r\n\r\nSo then she said that if it was necessary, she would tell the judge\r\nthat Sir Francis Beekman went out of his mind when he gave it to me. So\r\nDorothy said \xe2\x80\x9cLady, if you go into a court and if the judge gets a good\r\nlook at you, he will think that Sir Francis Beekman was out of his mind\r\n35 years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d So then Lady Francis Beekman said she knew what kind of\r\na person she had to deal with and she would not deal with any such a\r\nperson because she said it hurt her dignity. So Dorothy said \xe2\x80\x9cLady, if\r\nwe hurt your dignity like you hurt our eyesight I hope for your sake,\r\nyou are a Christian science.\xe2\x80\x9d So that seemed to make Lady Francis\r\nBeekman angry. So she said she would turn it all over to her soliciter.\r\nSo when she went out she tripped over quite a long train which she had\r\non her skirt and she nearly fell down. So Dorothy leaned out of the\r\ndoor and Dorothy called down the hall and said, \xe2\x80\x9cTake a tuck in that\r\nskirt Isabel, its 1925.\xe2\x80\x9d So I really felt quite depressed because I\r\nfelt as if our whole morning was really very unrefined just because we\r\nhad to mix with such an unrefined lady as Lady Francis Beekman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 30th:\r\n\r\nSo sure enough yesterday morning Lady Francis Beekman\xe2\x80\x99s solicitor came.\r\nOnly he really was not a solicitor, but his name was on a card and it\r\nseems his name is Mons. Broussard and it seems that he is an advocat\r\nbecause an advocat is a lawyer in the French landguage. So Dorothy and\r\nI were getting dressed and we were in our negligay as usual when there\r\nwas quite a loud knock on the door and before we could even say come in\r\nhe jumped right into the room. So it seems that he is of French\r\nextraction. I mean Lady Francis Beekman\xe2\x80\x99s solicitor can really squeal\r\njust like a taxi driver. I mean he was squealing quite loud when he\r\njumped into the room and he kept right on squealing. So Dorothy and I\r\nrushed into the parlor and Dorothy looked at him and Dorothy said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis town has got to stop playing jokes on us every morning\xe2\x80\x9d because\r\nour nerves could not stand it. So Mons. Broussard handed us his card\r\nand he squealed and squealed and he really waved his arms in the air\r\nquite a lot. So Dorothy said He gives quite a good imitation of the\r\nMoulan Rouge, which is really a red wind mill, only Dorothy said he\r\nmakes more noise and he runs on his own wind. So we stood and watched\r\nhim for quite a long while, but he seemed to get quite monotonous after\r\nquite a long while because he was always talking in French, which\r\nreally means nothing to us. So Dorothy said \xe2\x80\x9cLets see if 25 francs will\r\nstop him, because if 5 francs will stop a taxi driver, 25 francs ought\r\nto stop an advocat.\xe2\x80\x9d Because he was making about 5 times as much noise\r\nas a taxi driver and 5 times 5 is 25. So as soon as he heard us start\r\nin to talk about francs he seemed to calm down quite a little. So\r\nDorothy got her pocket book and she gave him 25 francs. So then he\r\nstopped squealing and he put it in his pocket, but then he got out\r\nquite a large size handkerchief with purple elefants on it and he\r\nstarted in to cry. So Dorothy really got discouraged and she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, you have given us a quite an amusing morning but if you\r\nkeep that up much longer, wet or dry, out you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo then he started in to pointing at the telephone and he seemed to\r\nwant to use the telephone and Dorothy said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you think you can get a\r\nnumber over that thing, go to it, but as far as we have found out, it\r\nis a wall bracket.\xe2\x80\x9d So then he started in to telephone so Dorothy and I\r\nwent about our business to get dressed. So when he finished telephoning\r\nhe kept running to my door and then he kept running to Dorothy\xe2\x80\x99s door,\r\nand he kept on crying and talking a lot, but he seemed to have lost all\r\nof his novelty to us so we paid no more attention to him.\r\n\r\nSo finally there was another loud knock on the door so we heard him\r\nrush to the door so we both went in to the parlor to see what it was\r\nand it really was a sight. Because it was another Frenchman. So the new\r\nFrenchman rushed in and he yelled Papa and he kissed him. So it seems\r\nthat it was his son because his son is really his papa\xe2\x80\x99s partner in the\r\nadvocat business. So then his papa talked quite a lot and then he\r\npointed at I and Dorothy. So then his son looked at us and then his son\r\nlet out quite a large size squeal, and he said in French \xe2\x80\x9cMay papa,\r\nelles sont sharmant.\xe2\x80\x9d So it seems he was telling his papa in French\r\nthat we were really charming. So then Mons. Broussard stopped crying\r\nand put on his glasses and took a good look at us. So then his son put\r\nup the window shade, so his papa could get a better look at us. So when\r\nhis papa had finished looking at us he really became delighted. So he\r\nbecame all smiles and he pinched our cheeks and he kept on saying\r\nSharmant all of the time because Sharmant means charming in the French\r\nlanguadge. So then his son broke right out into english and he really\r\nspeaks english as good as an American. So then he told us his papa\r\ntelephoned for him to come over because we did not seem to understand\r\nwhat his papa was saying to us. So it seems that Mons. Broussard had\r\nbeen talking to us in english all of the time but we did not seem to\r\nunderstand his kind of english. So Dorothy said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf what your papa was\r\ntalking in was english, I could get a gold medal for my greek.\xe2\x80\x9d So then\r\nhis son told his papa and his papa laughed very very loud and he\r\npinched Dorothys cheek and he was very delighted even if the joke was\r\non him. So then Dorothy and I asked his son what he was saying, when he\r\nwas talking to us in english and his son said he was telling us all\r\nabout his client, Lady Francis Beekman. So then we asked his son why\r\nhis papa kept crying. So then his son said his papa kept crying because\r\nhe was thinking about Lady Francis Beekman. So Dorothy said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf he\r\ncries when he thinks about her, what does he do when he looks at her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSo then his son explained to his papa what Dorothy said. So then Mons.\r\nBroussard laughed very very loud, so then he kissed Dorothy\xe2\x80\x99s hand, so\r\nhe said, after that, we would all really have to have a bottle of\r\nchampagne. So he went to the telephone and ordered a bottle of\r\nchampagne.\r\n\r\nSo then his son said to his papa, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do we not ask the charming\r\nladies to go out to Fountainblo to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d So his papa said it would be\r\ncharming. So then I said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow are we going to tell you gentlemen\r\napart, because if it is the same in Paris as it is in America, you\r\nwould both seem to be Monshure Broussard.\xe2\x80\x9d So then we got the idea to\r\ncall them by their first name. So it seems that his son\xe2\x80\x99s name is Louie\r\nso Dorothy spoke up and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI hear that they number all of you\r\nLouies over here in Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d Because a girl is always hearing some one\r\ntalk about Louie the sixteenth who seemed to be in the anteek furniture\r\nbusiness. I mean I was surprised to hear Dorothy get so historical so\r\nshe may really be getting educated in spite of everything. But Dorothy\r\ntold Louie he need not try to figure out his number because she got it\r\nthe minute she looked at him. So it seems his papa\xe2\x80\x99s name is Robber,\r\nwhich means Robert in French. So Dorothy started in to think about her\r\n25 francs and she said to Robber, \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother certainly knew her\r\ngrammer when she called you that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy said we might as well go out to Fountainblo with Louie and\r\nRobber if Louie would take off his yellow spats that were made out of\r\nyellow shammy skin with pink pearl buttons. Because Dorothy said, \xe2\x80\x9cFun\r\nis fun but no girl wants to laugh all of the time.\xe2\x80\x9d So Louie is really\r\nalways anxious to please, so he took off his spats but when he took off\r\nhis spats, we saw his socks and when we saw his socks we saw that they\r\nwere Scotch plaid with small size rainbows running through them. So\r\nDorothy looked at them a little while and she really became quite\r\ndiscouraged and she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell Louie, I think you had better put your\r\nspats back on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo then Leon, our friend who is the waiter, came in with the bottle of\r\nchampagne. So while he was opening the bottle of champagne Louie and\r\nRobber talked together in French quite a lot and I really think I had\r\nought to find out what they said in French because it might be about\r\nthe diamond tiara. Because French gentlemen are very very gallant, but\r\nI really do not think a girl can trust one of them around a corner. So,\r\nwhen I get a chance, I am going to ask Leon what they said.\r\n\r\nSo then we went to Fountainblo and then we went to Momart and we got\r\nhome very late, and we really had quite a delightful day and night,\r\neven if we did not go out shopping and buy anything. But I really think\r\nwe ought to do more shopping because shopping really seems to be what\r\nParis is principaly for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 1st:\r\n\r\nWell this morning I sent for Leon, who is Dorothy and my waiter friend,\r\nand I asked him what Louie and Robber said in French. So it seems that\r\nthey said in French that we seemed to attract them very very much\r\nbecause they really thought that we were very very charming, and they\r\nhad not met girls that were so charming in quite a long time. So it\r\nseems that they said that they would ask us out a lot and that they\r\nwould charge up all the bills to Lady Francis Beekman because they\r\nwould watch for their chance and they would steal the diamond tiara. So\r\nthen they said that even if they could not steal it from us, we were\r\nreally so charming that it would be delightful to go around with us,\r\neven if they could not steal from us. So no matter what happens they\r\nreally could not lose. Because it seems that Lady Francis Beekman would\r\nbe glad to pay all the bills when they told her they had to take us out\r\na lot so they could watch for their chance and steal it. Because Lady\r\nFrancis Beekman is the kind of a wealthy lady that does not spend money\r\non anything else but she will always spend money on a law suit. And she\r\nreally would not mind spending the money because it seems that\r\nsomething either I or Dorothy said to Lady Francis Beekman seemed to\r\nmake her angry.\r\n\r\nSo then I decided it was time to do some thinking and I really thought\r\nquite a lot. So I told Dorothy I thought I would put the real diamond\r\ntiara in the safe at the Ritz and then I would buy an imitation of a\r\ndiamond tiara at the jewelry store that has the imitations that are\r\ncalled paste. So then I would leave the imitation of the diamond tiara\r\nlying around, so Louie and Robber could see how careless I seem to be\r\nwith it so then they would get full of encouradgement. So when we go\r\nout with Louie and Robber I could put it in my hand bag and I could\r\ntake it with me so Louie and Robber could always feel that the diamond\r\ntiara was within reach. So then Dorothy and I could get them to go\r\nshopping and we could get them to spend quite a lot and every time they\r\nseemed to get discouradged, I could open my hand bag, and let them get\r\na glimpse of the imitation of a diamond tiara and they would become\r\nmore encouradged and then they would spend some more money. Because I\r\neven might let them steal it at the last, because they were really\r\ncharming gentlemen after all and I really would like to help Louie and\r\nRobber. I mean it would be quite amusing for them to steal it for Lady\r\nFrancis Beekman and she would have to pay them quite a lot and then she\r\nwould find out it was only made out of paste after all. Because Lady\r\nFrancis Beekman has never seen the real diamond tiara and the imitation\r\nof a diamond tiara would really deceive her, at least until Louie and\r\nRobber got all of their money for all of the hard work they did. I mean\r\nthe imitation of a diamond tiara would only cost about 65 dollars and\r\nwhat is 65 dollars if Dorothy and I could do some delightful shopping\r\nand get some delightful presents that would even seem more delightful\r\nwhen we stopped to realize that Lady Francis Beekman paid for them. And\r\nit would teach Lady Francis Beekman a lesson not to say what she said\r\nto two American girls like I and Dorothy, who were all alone in Paris\r\nand had no gentleman to protect them.\r\n\r\nSo when I got through telling Dorothy what I thought up, Dorothy looked\r\nat me and looked at me and she really said she thought my brains were a\r\nmiracle. I mean she said my brains reminded her of a radio because you\r\nlisten to it for days and days and you get discouradged and just when\r\nyou are getting ready to smash it, something comes out that is a\r\nmasterpiece.\r\n\r\nSo then Louie called us up so Dorothy told him that we thought it would\r\nbe delightful if he and Robber would take us out shopping tomorrow\r\nmorning. So then Louie asked his papa and his papa said they would. So\r\nthen they asked us if we would like to go to see a play called The\r\nFoley Bergere tonight. So he said that all of the French people who\r\nlive in Paris are always delighted to have some Americans, so it will\r\ngive them an excuse to go to the Foley Bergere. So we said we would go.\r\nSo now Dorothy and I are going out shopping to buy the imitation of a\r\ndiamond tiara and we are going out window shopping to pick out where we\r\nwould like Louie and Robber to take us shopping tomorrow.\r\n\r\nSo I really think that everything always works out for the best.\r\nBecause after all, we really need some gentlemen to take us around\r\nuntil Mr. Eisman gets to Paris and we could not go around with any\r\nreally attractive gentlemen because Mr. Eisman only wants me to go out\r\nwith gentlemen that have brains. So I said to Dorothy that, even if\r\nLouie and Robber do not look so full of brains, we could tell Mr.\r\nEisman that all we were learning from them was French. So even if I\r\nhave not seemed to learn French yet, I have really almost learned to\r\nunderstand Robbers english so when Robber talks in front of Mr. Eisman\r\nand I seem to understand what he is saying, Mr. Eisman will probably\r\nthink I know French.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 2nd:\r\n\r\nSo last night we went to the Foley Bergere and it really was devine. I\r\nmean it was very very artistic because it had girls in it that were in\r\nthe nude. So one of the girls was a friend of Louie and he said that\r\nshe was a very very nice girl, and that she was only 18 years of age.\r\nSo Dorothy said, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is slipping it over on you Louie, because how\r\ncould a girl get such dirty knees in only 18 years?\xe2\x80\x9d So Louie and\r\nRobber really laughed very very loud. I mean Dorothy was very unrefined\r\nat the Foley Bergere. But I always think that when girls are in the\r\nnude it is very artistic and if you have artistic thoughts you think it\r\nis beautiful and I really would not laugh in an artistic place like the\r\nFoley Bergere.\r\n\r\nSo I wore the imitation of a diamond tiara to the Foley Bergere. I mean\r\nit really would deceeve an expert and Louie and Robber could hardly\r\ntake their eyes off of it. But they did not really annoy me because I\r\nhad it tied on very very tight. I mean it would be fatal if they got\r\nthe diamond tiara before Dorothy and I took them shopping a lot.\r\n\r\nSo we are all ready to go shopping this morning and Robber was here\r\nbright and early and he is in the parlor with Dorothy and we are\r\nwaiting for Louie. So I left the daimond tiara on the table in the\r\nparlor so Robber could see how careless I really am with everything but\r\nDorothy is keeping her eye on Robber. So I just heard Louie come in\r\nbecause I heard him kissing Robber. I mean Louie is always kissing\r\nRobber and Dorothy told Louie that if he did not stop kissing Robber,\r\npeople would think that he painted batiks.\r\n\r\nSo now I must join the others and I will put the diamond tiara in my\r\nhand bag so that Louie and Robber will feel that it is always around\r\nand we will all go shopping. And I almost have to smile when I think of\r\nLady Francis Beekman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 3rd:\r\n\r\nYesterday was really delightful. I mean Louie and Robber bought Dorothy\r\nand I some delightful presents. But then they began to run out of all\r\nthe franks they had with them, so they began to get discouradged but\r\njust as soon as they began to get discouradged, I gave Robber my hand\r\nbag to hold while I went to the fitting room to try on a blouse. So he\r\nwas cheered up quite a lot, but of course Dorothy stayed with them and\r\nkept her eye on Robber so he did not get a chance. But it really\r\ncheered him up quite a lot to even hold it.\r\n\r\nSo after all their franks were gone, Robber said he would have to\r\ntelephone to some one, so I suppose he telephoned to Lady Francis\r\nBeekman and she must have said All right because Robber left us at a\r\nplace called the Cafe de la Paix because he had to go on an errand and\r\nwhen he came back from his errand he seemed to have quite a lot more\r\nfranks. So then they took us to luncheon so that after luncheon we\r\ncould go out shopping some more.\r\n\r\nBut I am really learning quite a lot of French in spite of everything.\r\nI mean if you want delicious chicken and peas for luncheon all you have\r\nto say is \xe2\x80\x9cpettypas\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpulle.\xe2\x80\x9d I mean French is really very easy,\r\nfor instance the French use the word \xe2\x80\x9csheik\xe2\x80\x9d for everything, while we\r\nonly seem to use it for gentlemen when they seem to resemble Rudolf\r\nValentino.\r\n\r\nSo while we were shopping in the afternoon I saw Louie get Dorothy off\r\nin a corner and whisper to her quite a lot. So then I saw Robber get\r\nher off in a corner and whisper to her quite a lot. So when we got back\r\nto the Ritz, Dorothy told me why they whispered to her. So it seems\r\nwhen Louie whispered to Dorothy, Louie told Dorothy that if she would\r\nsteal the diamond tiara from me and give it to him and not let his papa\r\nknow, he would give her 1000 franks. Because it seems that Lady Francis\r\nBeekman has got her heart set on it and she will pay quite a lot for it\r\nbecause she is quite angry and when she really gets as angry as she is,\r\nshe is only a woman with one idea. So if Louie could get it and his\r\npapa would not find it out, he could keep all the money for himself. So\r\nit seems that later on, when Robber was whispering to Dorothy, he was\r\nmaking her the same proposition for 2000 franks so that Louie would not\r\nfind out and Robber could keep all the money for himself. So I really\r\nthink it would be delightful if Dorothy could make some money for\r\nherself because it might make Dorothy get some ambishions. So tomorrow\r\nmorning Dorothy is going to take the diamond tiara and she is going to\r\ntell Louie that she stole it and she is going to sell it to Louie. But\r\nshe will make him hand over the money first and then, just as she is\r\ngoing to hand over the diamond tiara, I am going to walk in on them and\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9cOh there is my diamond tiara. I have been looking for it\r\neverywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d So then I will get it back. So then she will tell him that\r\nshe might just as well keep the 1000 franks because she will steal it\r\nfor him again in the afternoon. So in the afternoon she is going to\r\nsell it to Robber and I really think we will let Robber keep it.\r\nBecause I am quite fond of Robber. I mean he is quite a sweet old\r\ngentleman and it is really refreshing the way he and his son love one\r\nanother. Because even if it is unusual for an American to see a French\r\ngentleman always kissing his father, I really think it is refreshing\r\nand I think that we Americans would be better off if we American\r\nfathers and sons would love one another more like Louie and Robber.\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy and I have quite a lot of delightful hand bags and stockings\r\nand handkerchiefs and scarfs and things and some quite cute models of\r\nevening gowns that are all covered with imitations of diamonds, only\r\nthey do not call them \xe2\x80\x9cpaste\xe2\x80\x9d when they are on a dress but they call\r\nthem \xe2\x80\x9cdiamonteys\xe2\x80\x9d and I really think a girl looks quite cute when she\r\nis covered all over with \xe2\x80\x9cdiamonteys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 5th:\r\n\r\nSo yesterday morning Dorothy sold the imitation of a diamond tiara to\r\nLouie. So then we got it back. So in the afternoon we all went out to\r\nVersigh. I mean Louie and Robber were quite delighted not to go\r\nshopping any more so I suppose that Lady Francis Beekman really thinks\r\nthat there is a limit to almost everything. So I took Louie for a walk\r\nat Versigh so that Dorothy would have a chance to sell it to Robber. So\r\nthen she sold it to Robber. So then he put it in his pocket. But when\r\nwe were coming home I got to thinking things over and I really got to\r\nthinking that an imitation of a diamond tiara was quite a good thing to\r\nhave after all. I mean especially if a girl goes around a lot in Paris,\r\nwith admirers who are of the French extraction. And after all, I really\r\ndo not think a girl ought to encouradge Robber to steal something from\r\ntwo American girls who are all alone in Paris and have no gentleman to\r\nprotect them. So I asked Dorothy which pocket Robber put it in, so I\r\nsat next to him in the automobile coming home and I took it out.\r\n\r\nSo we were in quite a quaint restaurant for dinner when Robber put his\r\nhand in his pocket and then he started in to squeal once more. So it\r\nseems he had lost something, so he and Louie had one of their regular\r\nsquealing and shoulder shrugging matches. But Louie told his papa that\r\nhe did not steal it out of his papa\xe2\x80\x99s pocket. But then Robber started\r\nin to cry to think that his son would steal something out of his own\r\npapa\xe2\x80\x99s pocket. So after Dorothy and I had had about all we could stand,\r\nI told them all about it. I mean I really felt sorry for Robber so I\r\ntold him not to cry any more because it was nothing but paste after\r\nall. So then I showed it to them. So then Louie and Robber looked at\r\nDorothy and I and they really held their breath. So I suppose that most\r\nof the girls in Paris do not have such brains as we American girls.\r\n\r\nSo after it was all over, Louie and Robber seemed to be so depressed\r\nthat I really felt sorry for them. So I got an idea. So I told them\r\nthat we would all go out tomorrow to the imitation of a jewelry store\r\nand they could buy another imitation of a diamond tiara to give to Lady\r\nFrancis Beekman and they could get the man in the jewelry store to put\r\non the bill that it was a hand bag and they could charge the bill to\r\nLady Francis Beekman along with the other expenses. Because Lady\r\nFrancis Beekman had never seen the real diamond tiara anyway. So\r\nDorothy spoke up and Dorothy said that as far as Lady Francis Beekman\r\nwould know about diamonds, you could nick off a piece of ice and give\r\nit to her, only it would melt. So then Robber looked at me and looked\r\nat me, and he reached over and kissed me on the forehead in a way that\r\nwas really full of reverance.\r\n\r\nSo then we had quite a delightful evening. I mean because we all seem\r\nto understand one another because, after all, Dorothy and I could\r\nreally have a platonick friendship with gentlemen like Louie and\r\nRobber. I mean there seems to be something common between us,\r\nespecially when we all get to thinking about Lady Francis Beekman.\r\n\r\nSo they are going to charge Lady Francis Beekman quite a lot of money\r\nwhen they give her the imitation of a diamond tiara and I told Robber\r\nif she seems to complane, to ask her, if she knew that Sir Francis\r\nBeekman sent me 10 pounds worth of orchids every day while we were in\r\nLondon. So that would make her so angry that she would be glad to pay\r\nalmost anything to get the diamond tiara.\r\n\r\nSo when Lady Francis Beekman pays them all the money, Louie and Robber\r\nare going to give us a dinner in our honor at Ciros. So when Mr. Eisman\r\ngets here on Saturday, Dorothy and I are going to make Mr. Eisman give\r\nLouie and Robber a dinner in their honor at Ciros because of the way\r\nthey helped us when we were two American girls all alone in Paris and\r\ncould not even speak the French landguage.\r\n\r\nSo Louie and Robber asked us to come to a party at their sister\xe2\x80\x99s house\r\ntoday but Dorothy says we had better not go because it is raining and\r\nwe both have brand new umbrellas that are quite cute and Dorothy says\r\nshe would not think of leaving a brand new umbrella in a French lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhall and it is no fun to hang on to an umbrella all the time you are at\r\na party. So we had better be on the safe side and stay away. So we\r\ncalled up Louie and told him we had a headache but we thanked him for\r\nall of his hospitality. Because it is the way all the French people\r\nlike Louie and Robber are so hospitable to we Americans that really\r\nmakes Paris so devine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\nTHE CENTRAL OF EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 16th:\r\n\r\nI really have not written in my diary for quite a long time, because\r\nMr. Eisman arrived in Paris and when Mr. Eisman is in Paris we really\r\ndo not seem to do practically anything else but the same thing.\r\n\r\nI mean we go shopping and we go to a show and we go to Momart and when\r\na girl is always going with Mr. Eisman nothing practically happens. And\r\nI did not even bother to learn any more French because I always seem to\r\nthink it is better to leave French to those that can not do anything\r\nelse but talk French. So finally Mr. Eisman seemed to lose quite a lot\r\nof interest in all of my shopping. So he heard about a button factory\r\nthat was for sale quite cheaply in Vienna and as Mr. Eisman is in the\r\nbutton profession, he thought it would be a quite good thing to have a\r\nbutton factory in Vienna so he went to Vienna and he said he did not\r\ncare if he did not ever see the rue de la Paix again. So he said if he\r\nthought Vienna would be good for a girl\xe2\x80\x99s brains, he would send for\r\nDorothy and I and we could meet him at Vienna and learn something.\r\nBecause Mr. Eisman really wants me to get educated more than anything\r\nelse, especially shopping.\r\n\r\nSo now we have a telegram, and Mr. Eisman says in the telegram for\r\nDorothy and I to take an oriental express because we really ought to\r\nsee the central of Europe because we American girls have quite a lot to\r\nlearn in the central of Europe. So Dorothy says if Mr. Eisman wants us\r\nto see the central of Europe she bets there is not a rue de la Paix in\r\nthe whole central of Europe.\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy and I are going to take an oriental express tomorrow and I\r\nreally think it is quite unusual for two American girls like I and\r\nDorothy to take an oriental express all alone, because it seems that in\r\nthe Central of Europe they talk some other kinds of landguages which we\r\ndo not understand besides French. But I always think that there is\r\nnearly always some gentleman who will protect two American girls like I\r\nand Dorothy who are all alone and who are traveling in the Central of\r\nEurope to get educated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 17th:\r\n\r\nSo now we are on an oriental express and everything seems to be quite\r\nunusual. I mean Dorothy and I got up this morning and we looked out of\r\nthe window of our compartment and it was really quite unusual. Because\r\nit was farms, and we saw quite a lot of girls who seemed to be putting\r\nsmall size hay stacks onto large size hay stacks while their husbands\r\nseemed to sit at a table under quite a shady tree and drink beer. Or\r\nelse their husbands seemed to sit on a fence and smoke their pipe and\r\nwatch them. So Dorothy and I looked at two girls who seemed to be\r\nploughing up all of the ground with only the aid of a cow and Dorothy\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI think we girls have gone one step to far away from New York,\r\nbecause it begins to look to me as if the Central of Europe is no\r\ncountry for we girls.\xe2\x80\x9d So we both became quite worried. I mean I became\r\nquite depressed because if this is what Mr. Eisman thinks we American\r\ngirls ought to learn I really think it is quite depressing. So I do not\r\nthink we care to meet any gentlemen who have been born and raised in\r\nthe Central of Europe. I mean the more I travel and the more I seem to\r\nsee other gentlemen the more I seem to think of American gentlemen.\r\n\r\nSo now I am going to get dressed and go to the dining car and look for\r\nsome American gentleman and hold a conversation, because I really feel\r\nso depressed. I mean Dorothy keeps trying to depress me because she\r\nkeeps saying that I will probably end up in a farm in the Central of\r\nEurope doing a sister act with a plough. Because Dorothy\xe2\x80\x99s jokes are\r\nreally very unrefined and I think that I will feel much better if I go\r\nto the dining car and have some luncheon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell I went to the dining car and I met a gentleman who was quite a\r\ndelightful American gentleman, I mean it was quite a co-instance,\r\nbecause we girls have always heard about Henry Spoffard and it was\r\nreally nobody else but the famous Henry Spoffard, who is the famous\r\nSpoffard family, who is a very very fine old family who is very very\r\nwealthy. I mean Mr. Spoffard is one of the most famous familys in New\r\nYork and he is not like most gentlemen who are wealthy, but he works\r\nall of the time for the good of the others. I mean he is the gentleman\r\nwho always gets his picture in all of the newspapers because he is\r\nalways senshuring all of the plays that are not good for peoples\r\nmorals. And all of we girls remember the time when he was in the Ritz\r\nfor luncheon and he met a gentleman friend of his and the gentleman\r\nfriend had Peggy Hopkins Joyce to luncheon and he introduced Peggy\r\nHopkins Joyce to Mr. Spoffard and Mr. Spoffard turned on his heels and\r\nwalked away. Because Mr. Spoffard is a very very famous Prespyterian\r\nand he is really much to Prespyterian to meet Peggy Hopkins Joyce. I\r\nmean it is unusual to see a gentleman who is such a young gentleman as\r\nMr. Spoffard be so Prespyterian, because when most gentlemen are 35\r\nyears of age their minds nearly always seem to be on something else.\r\n\r\nSo when I saw no one else but the famous Mr. Spoffard I really became\r\nquite thrilled. Because all of we girls have tried very hard to have an\r\nintroduction to Henry Spoffard and it was quite unusual to be shut up\r\non a train in the Central of Europe with him. So I thought it would be\r\nquite unusual for a girl like I to have a friendship with a gentleman\r\nlike Mr. Spoffard, who really does not even look at a girl unless she\r\nat least looks like a Prespyterian. And I mean our family in Little\r\nRock were really not so Prespyterians.\r\n\r\nSo I thought I would sit at his table. So then I had to ask him about\r\nall of the money because all of the money they use in the Central of\r\nEurope has not even got so much sense to it as the kind of franks they\r\nuse in Paris. Because it seems to be called kronens and it seems to\r\ntake quite a lot of them because it takes 50,000 of them to even buy a\r\nsmall size package of cigarettes and Dorothy says if the cigarettes had\r\ntobacco in them, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t lift enough kronens over a counter to pay\r\nfor a package. So this morning Dorothy and I asked the porter to bring\r\nus a bottle of champagne and we really did not know what to give him\r\nfor a tip. So Dorothy said for me to take one of the things called a\r\none million kronens and she would take one of them called a one million\r\nkronens and I would give him mine first and if he gave me quite a dirty\r\nlook, she would give him hers. So after we paid for the bottle of\r\nchampagne I gave him my one million kronens and before we could do\r\nanything else he started in to grabbing my hand and kissing my hand and\r\ngetting down on his knees. So we finally had to push him right out of\r\nthe compartment. So one million kronens seemed to be enough. So I told\r\nMr. Spoffard how we did not know what to give the porter when he\r\nbrought us our bottle of minral water. So then I asked him to tell me\r\nall about all of the money because I told him I always seem to think\r\nthat a penny earned was a penny saved. So it really was quite unusual\r\nbecause Mr. Spoffard said that that was his favorite motto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo then we got to talking quite a lot and I told him that I was\r\ntraveling to get educated and I told him I had a girl with me who I was\r\ntrying to reform because I thought if she would put her mind more on\r\ngetting educated, she would get more reformed. Because after all Mr.\r\nSpoffard will have to meet Dorothy sooner or later and he might wonder\r\nwhat a refined girl like I was doing with a girl like Dorothy. So Mr.\r\nSpoffard really became quite intreeged. Because Mr. Spoffard loves to\r\nreform people and he loves to senshure everything and he really came\r\nover to Europe to look at all the things that Americans come over to\r\nEurope to look at, when they really should not look at them but they\r\nshould look at all of the museums instead. Because if that is all we\r\nAmericans come to Europe to look at, we should stay home and look at\r\nAmerica first. So Mr. Spoffard spends all of his time looking at things\r\nthat spoil peoples morals. So Mr. Spoffard really must have very very\r\nstrong morals or else all the things that spoil other peoples morals\r\nwould spoil his morals. But they do not seem to spoil Mr. Spoffards\r\nmorals and I really think it is wonderful to have such strong morals.\r\nSo I told Mr. Spoffard that I thought that civilization is not what it\r\nought to be and we really ought to have something else to take its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Spoffard said that he would come to call on Dorothy and I in our\r\ncompartment this afternoon and we would talk it all over, if his mother\r\ndoes not seem to need him in her compartment. Because Mr. Spoffards\r\nmother always travels with Mr. Spoffard and he never does anything\r\nunless he tells his mother all about it, and asks his mother if he\r\nought to. So he told me that that is the reason he has never got\r\nmarried, because his mother does not think that all of the flappers we\r\nseem to have nowadays are what a young man ought to marry when a young\r\nman is full of so many morals as Mr. Spoffard seems to be full of. So I\r\ntold Mr. Spoffard that I really felt just like his mother feels about\r\nall of the flappers because I am an old fashioned girl.\r\n\r\nSo then I got to worrying about Dorothy quite a lot because Dorothy is\r\nreally not so old-fashioned and she might say something in front of Mr.\r\nSpoffard that might make Mr. Spoffard wonder what such an old-fashioned\r\ngirl as I was doing with such a girl as Dorothy. So I told him how I\r\nwas having quite a hard time reforming Dorothy and I would like to have\r\nhim meet Dorothy so he could tell me if he really thinks I am wasting\r\nquite a lot of time trying to reform a girl like Dorothy. So then he\r\nhad to go to his mother. So I really hope that Dorothy will act more\r\nreformed than she usually acts in front of Mr. Spoffard.\r\n\r\nWell Mr. Spoffard just left our compartment so he really came to pay a\r\ncall on us after all. So Mr. Spoffard told us all about his mother and\r\nI was really very very intreeged because if Mr. Spoffard and I become\r\nfriendly he is the kind of a gentleman that always wants a girl to meet\r\nhis mother. I mean if a girl gets to know what kind of a mother a\r\ngentlemans mother is like, she really knows more what kind of a\r\nconversation to use on a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s mother when she meets her. Because\r\na girl like I is really always on the verge of meeting gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmothers. But such an unrefined girl as Dorothy is really not the kind\r\nof a girl that ever meets gentlemens mothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Spoffard says his mother has to have him take care of her quite\r\na lot. Because Mr. Spoffards mothers brains have never really been so\r\nstrong. Because it seems his mother came from such a very fine old\r\nfamily that even when she was quite a small size child she had to be\r\nsent to a school that was a special school for people of very fine old\r\nfamilys who had to have things very easy on their brain. So she still\r\nhas to have things very easy on her brain, so she has a girl who is\r\ncalled her companion who goes with her everywhere who is called Miss\r\nChapman. Because Mr. Spoffard says that there is always something new\r\ngoing on in the world which they did not get a chance to tell her about\r\nat the school. So now Miss Chapman keeps telling her instead. Because\r\nhow would she know what to think about such a new thing as a radio, for\r\ninstance, if she did not have Miss Chapman to tell her what it was, for\r\ninstance. So Dorothy spoke up and Dorothy said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a responsibility\r\nthat girl has got on her shoulders. For instance, what if Miss Chapman\r\ntold her a radio was something to build a fire in, and she would get\r\ncold some day and stuff it full of papers and light it.\xe2\x80\x9d But Mr.\r\nSpoffard told Dorothy that Miss Chapman would never make such a\r\nmistake. Because he said that Miss Chapman came from a very very fine\r\nold family herself and she really had a fine brain. So Dorothy said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she really has got such a fine brain I bet her fine old family once\r\nhad an ice man who could not be trusted.\xe2\x80\x9d So Mr. Spoffard and I did not\r\npay any more attention to Dorothy because Dorothy really does not know\r\nhow to hold a conversation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo then I and Mr. Spoffard held a conversation all about morals and Mr.\r\nSpoffard says he really thinks the future of everything is between the\r\nhands of Mr. Blank the district attorney who is the famous district\r\nattorney who is closing up all the places in New York where they sell\r\nall of the liquor. So Mr. Spoffard said that a few months ago, when Mr.\r\nBlank decided he would try to get the job to be the district attorney,\r\nhe put 1,000 dollars worth of liquor down his sink. So now Mr. Blank\r\nsays that everybody else has got to put it down their sink. So Dorothy\r\nspoke up, and Dorothy said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf he poured 1,000 dollars worth down his\r\nsink to get himself one million dollars worth of publicity and a good\r\njob\xe2\x80\x94when we pour it down our sink, what do we get?\xe2\x80\x9d But Mr. Spoffard is\r\nto brainy a gentleman to answer any such a foolish question. So he gave\r\nDorothy a look that was full of dignity and he said he would have to go\r\nback to his Mother. So I was really quite angry at Dorothy. So I\r\nfollowed Mr. Spoffard down the hall of the railway train and I asked\r\nMr. Spoffard if he thought I was wasting quite a lot of time reforming\r\na girl like Dorothy. So Mr. Spoffard thinks I am, because he really\r\nthinks a girl like Dorothy will never have any reverance. So I told Mr.\r\nSpoffard I had wasted so much time on Dorothy it would really break my\r\nheart to be a failure. So then I had tears in my eyes. So Mr. Spoffard\r\nis really very very sympathetic because when he saw that I did not have\r\nany handkerchief, he took his own handkerchief and he dried up all of\r\nmy tears. So then he said he would help me with Dorothy quite a lot and\r\nget her mind to running on things that are more educational.\r\n\r\nSo then he said he thought that we ought to get off the train at a\r\nplace called Munich because it was very full of art, which they call\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ckunst\xe2\x80\x9d in Munich, which is very, very educational. So he said he and\r\nDorothy and I would get off of the train in Munich because he could\r\nsend his mother right on to Vienna with Miss Chapman, because every\r\nplace always seems to look alike to his mother anyway. So we are all\r\ngoing to get off the train at Munich and I can send Mr. Eisman a\r\ntelegram when nobody is looking. Because I really do not think I will\r\ntell Mr. Spoffard about Mr. Eisman, because, after all, their religions\r\nare different and when two gentlemen have such different religions they\r\ndo not seem to have so much to get congeneal about. So I can telegraph\r\nMr. Eisman that Dorothy and I thought we would get off the train at\r\nMunich to look at all of the art.\r\n\r\nSo then I went back to Dorothy and I told Dorothy if she did not have\r\nanything to say in the future to not say it. Because even if Mr.\r\nSpoffard is a fine old family and even if he is very Prespyterian, I\r\nand he could really be friendly after all and talk together quite a\r\nlot. I mean Mr. Spoffard likes to talk about himself quite a lot, so I\r\nsaid to Dorothy it really shows that, after all, he is just like any\r\nother gentleman. But Dorothy said she would demand more proof than\r\nthat. So Dorothy says she thinks that maybe I might become quite\r\nfriendly with Mr. Spoffard and especially with his mother because she\r\nthinks his mother and I have quite a lot that is common, but she says,\r\nif I ever bump into Miss Chapman, she thinks I will come to a kropper\r\nbecause Dorothy saw Miss Chapman when she was at luncheon and Dorothy\r\nsays Miss Chapman is the kind of a girl that wears a collar and a tie\r\neven when she is not on horseback. And Dorothy said it was the look\r\nthat Miss Chapman gave her at luncheon that really gave her the idea\r\nabout the ice man. So Dorothy says she thinks Miss Chapman has got 3\r\nthirds of the brains of that trio of Geegans, because Geegans is the\r\nslang word that Dorothy has thought up to use on people who are society\r\npeople. Because Dorothy says she thinks any gentleman with Mr.\r\nSpoffards brains had ought to spend his time putting nickels into an\r\nelectric piano, but I did not even bother to talk back at such a girl\r\nas Dorothy. So now we must get ready to get off the train when the\r\ntrain gets to Munich so that we can look at all of the kunst in Munich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 19th:\r\n\r\nWell yesterday Mr. Spoffard and I and Dorothy got off the train at\r\nMunich to see all of the kunst in Munich, but you only call it Munich\r\nwhen you are on the train because as soon as you get off of the train\r\nthey seem to call it Munchen. So you really would know that Munchen was\r\nfull of kunst because in case you would not know it, they have painted\r\nthe word \xe2\x80\x9ckunst\xe2\x80\x9d in large size black letters on everything in Munchen,\r\nand you can not even see a boot black\xe2\x80\x99s stand in Munchen that is not\r\nfull of kunst.\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Spoffard said that we really ought to go to the theater in\r\nMunchen because even the theater in Munchen was full of kunst. So we\r\nlooked at all of the bills of all of the theaters, with the aid of\r\nquite an intelectual hotel clerk who seemed to be able to read it and\r\ntell us what it said, because it really meant nothing to us. So it\r\nseems they were playing Kiki in Munchen, so I said, let us go and see\r\nKiki because we have seen Lenore Ulric in New York and we would really\r\nknow what it is all about even if they do not seem to talk the English\r\nlandguage. So then we went to the Kunst theater. So it seems that\r\nMunchen is practically full of Germans and the lobby of the Kunst\r\ntheater was really full of Germans who stand in the lobby and drink\r\nbeer and eat quite a lot of Bermudian onions and garlick sausage and\r\nhard boiled eggs and beer before all of the acts. So I really had to\r\nask Mr. Spoffard if he thought we had come to the right theatre because\r\nthe lobby seemed to smell such a lot. I mean when the smell of beer\r\ngets to be anteek it gets to smell quite a lot. But Mr. Spoffard seemed\r\nto think that the lobby of the Kunst theatre did not smell any worse\r\nthan all of the other places in Munich. So then Dorothy spoke up and\r\nDorothy said \xe2\x80\x9cYou can say what you want about the Germans being full of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98kunst,\xe2\x80\x99 but what they are really full of is delicatessen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo then we went into the Kunst theater. But the Kunst theater does not\r\nseem to smell so good as the lobby of the Kunst theater. And the Kunst\r\ntheater seems to be decorated with quite a lot of what tripe would look\r\nlike if it was pasted on the wall and gilded. Only you could not really\r\nsee the gilding because it was covered with quite a lot of dust. So\r\nDorothy looked around and Dorothy said, if this is \xe2\x80\x9ckunst,\xe2\x80\x9d the art\r\ncenter of the world is Union Hill New Jersey.\r\n\r\nSo then they started in to playing Kiki but it seems that it was not\r\nthe same kind of a Kiki that we have in America, because it seemed to\r\nbe all about a family of large size German people who seemed to keep\r\ngetting in each others ways. I mean when a stage is completely full of\r\n2 or 3 German people who are quite large size, they really cannot help\r\nit if they seem to get in each others ways. So then Dorothy got to\r\ntalking with a young gentleman who seemed to be a German gentleman who\r\nsat back of her, who she thought was applauding. But what he was really\r\ndoing was he was cracking a hard boiled egg on the back of her chair.\r\nSo he talked English with quite an accent that seemed to be quite a\r\nGerman accent. So Dorothy asked him if Kiki had come out on the stage\r\nyet. So he said no, but she was really a beautiful german actress who\r\ncame clear from Berlin and he said we should really wait until she came\r\nout, even if we did not seem to understand it. So finally she came out.\r\nI mean we knew it was her because Dorothy\xe2\x80\x99s German gentleman friend\r\nnudged Dorothy with a sausage. So we looked at her, and we looked at\r\nher and Dorothy said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf Schuman Heinke still has a grandmother, we\r\nhave dug her up in Munchen.\xe2\x80\x9d So we did not bother to see any more of\r\nKiki because Dorothy said she would really have to know more about the\r\nfoundations of that building before she would risk our lives to see\r\nKiki do that famous scene where she faints in the last act. Because\r\nDorothy said, if the foundations of that building were as anteek as the\r\nsmell, there was going to be a catasterophy when Kiki hit the floor. So\r\neven Mr. Spoffard was quite discouradged, but he was really glad\r\nbecause he said he was 100 per cent. of an American and it served the\r\nGermans right for starting such a war against all we Americans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 20th:\r\n\r\nWell today Mr. Spoffard is going to take me all around to all of the\r\nmuseums in Munchen, which are full of kunst that I really ought to look\r\nat, but Dorothy said she had been punished for all of her sins last\r\nnight, so now she is going to begin life all over again by going out\r\nwith her German gentleman friend, who is going to take her to a house\r\ncalled the Half Brow house which is the worlds largest size of a Beer\r\nHall. So Dorothy said I could be a high brow and get full of kunst, but\r\nshe is satisfide to be a Half brow and get full of beer. But Dorothy\r\nwill really never be full of anything else but unrefinement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 21st:\r\n\r\nWell Mr. Spoffard and I and Dorothy are on the train again and we are\r\nall going to Vienna. I mean Mr. Spoffard and I spent one whole day\r\ngoing through all of the museums in Munchen, but I am really not even\r\ngoing to think about it. Because when something terrible happens to me,\r\nI always try to be a Christian science and I simply do not even think\r\nabout it, but I deny that it ever happened even if my feet do seem to\r\nhurt quite a lot. So even Dorothy had quite a hard day in Munchen\r\nbecause her German gentleman friend, who is called Rudolf, came for her\r\nat 11 oclock to take her to breakfast. But Dorothy told him that she\r\nhad had her breakfast. But her gentleman friend said that he had had\r\nhis first breakfast to, but it was time for his second. So he took\r\nDorothy to the Half Brow house where everybody eats white sausages and\r\npretzels and beer at 11 oclock. So after they had their white sausages\r\nand beer he wanted to take her for a ride but they could only go a few\r\nblocks because by then it was time for luncheon. So they ate quite a\r\nlot of luncheon and then he bought her a large size box of chocolates\r\nthat were full of liqueurs, and took her to the matinee. So after the\r\nfirst act Rudolf got hungry and they had to go and stand in the lobby\r\nand have some sandwitches and beer. But Dorothy did not enjoy the show\r\nvery much and so after the second act Rudolf said they would leave\r\nbecause it was time for tea anyway. So after quite a heavy tea, Rudolph\r\nasked her to dinner and Dorothy was to overcome to say No. So after\r\ndinner they went to a beer garden for beer and pretzels. But finally\r\nDorothy began to come to, and she asked him to take her back to the\r\nhotel. So Rudolf said he would, but they had better have a bite to eat\r\nfirst. So today Dorothy really feels just as discouradged as I seem to\r\nfeel, only Dorothy is not a Christian science and all she can do is\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all of my Christian science, I am really beginning to\r\nfeel quite discouradged about Vienna. I mean Mr. Eisman is in Vienna,\r\nand I do not see how I can spend quite a lot of time with Mr. Eisman\r\nand quite a lot of time with Mr. Spoffard and keep them from meeting\r\none another. Because Mr. Spoffard might not seem to understand why Mr.\r\nEisman seems to spend quite a lot of money to get me educated. And\r\nDorothy keeps trying to depress me about Miss Chapman because she says\r\nshe thinks that when Miss Chapman sees I and Mr. Spoffard together she\r\nthinks that Miss Chapman will cable for the familys favorite lunacy\r\nexpert. So I have got to be as full of Christian science as I can and\r\nalways hope for the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 25th:\r\n\r\nSo far everything has really worked out for the best. Because Mr.\r\nEisman is very very busy all day with the button profession, and he\r\ntells me to run around with Dorothy all day. So I and Mr. Spoffard run\r\naround all day. So then I tell Mr. Spoffard that I really do not care\r\nto go to all of the places that you go to at night, but I will go to\r\nbed and get ready for tomorrow instead. So then Dorothy and I go to\r\ndinner with Mr. Eisman and then we go to a show, and we stay up quite\r\nlate at a cabaret called the Chapeau Rouge and I am able to keep it all\r\nup with the aid of champagne. So if we keep our eye out for Mr.\r\nSpoffard and do not all bump into one another when he is out looking at\r\nthings that we Americans really should not look at, it will all work\r\nout for the best. I mean I have even stopped Mr. Spoffard looking at\r\nmuseums because I tell him that I like nature better, and when you look\r\nat nature you look at it in a horse and buggy in the park and it is\r\nmuch easier on the feet. So now he is beginning to talk about how he\r\nwould like me to meet his mother, so everything really seems for the\r\nbest after all.\r\n\r\nBut I have quite a hard time with Mr. Eisman at night. I mean at night\r\nMr. Eisman is in quite a state, because every time he makes an\r\nengagement about the button factory, it is time for all the gentlemen\r\nin Vienna to go to the coffee house and sit. Or else every time he\r\nmakes an engagement about the button factory, some Viennese gentleman\r\ngets the idea to have a picknick and they all put on short pants and\r\nbare knees and they all put a feather in their hat, and they all walk\r\nto the Tyrol. So it really discouradges Mr. Eisman quite a lot. But if\r\nanyone ought to get discouradged I think that I ought to get\r\ndiscouradged because after all when a girl has had no sleep for a week\r\na girl can not help it if she seems to get discouradged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 27th:\r\n\r\nWell finaly I broke down and Mr. Spoffard said that he thought a little\r\ngirl like I, who was trying to reform the whole world was trying to do\r\nto much, especially beginning on a girl like Dorothy. So he said there\r\nwas a famous doctor in Vienna called Dr. Froyd who could stop all of my\r\nworrying because he does not give a girl medicine but he talks you out\r\nof it by psychoanalysis. So yesterday he took me to Dr. Froyd. So Dr.\r\nFroyd and I had quite a long talk in the english landguage. So it seems\r\nthat everybody seems to have a thing called inhibitions, which is when\r\nyou want to do a thing and you do not do it. So then you dream about it\r\ninstead. So Dr. Froyd asked me, what I seemed to dream about. So I told\r\nhim that I never really dream about anything. I mean I use my brains so\r\nmuch in the day time that at night they do not seem to do anything else\r\nbut rest. So Dr. Froyd was very very surprized at a girl who did not\r\ndream about anything. So then he asked me all about my life. I mean he\r\nis very very sympathetic, and he seems to know how to draw a girl out\r\nquite a lot. I mean I told him things that I really would not even put\r\nin my diary. So then he seemed very very intreeged at a girl who always\r\nseemed to do everything she wanted to do. So he asked me if I really\r\nnever wanted to do a thing that I did not do. For instance did I ever\r\nwant to do a thing that was really vialent, for instance, did I ever\r\nwant to shoot someone for instance. So then I said I had, but the\r\nbullet only went in Mr. Jennings lung and came right out again. So then\r\nDr. Froyd looked at me and looked at me and he said he did not really\r\nthink it was possible. So then he called in his assistance and he\r\npointed at me and talked to his assistance quite a lot in the Viennese\r\nlandguage. So then his assistance looked at me and looked at me and it\r\nreally seems as if I was quite a famous case. So then Dr. Froyd said\r\nthat all I needed was to cultivate a few inhibitions and get some\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 29th:\r\n\r\nThings are really getting to be quite a strain. Because yesterday Mr.\r\nSpoffard and Mr. Eisman were both in the lobby of the Bristol hotel and\r\nI had to pretend not to see both of them. I mean it is quite an easy\r\nthing to pretend not to see one gentleman, but it is a quite hard thing\r\nto pretend not to see two gentlemen. So something has really got to\r\nhappen soon, or I will have to admit that things seem to be happening\r\nthat are not for the best.\r\n\r\nSo this afternoon Dorothy and I had an engagement to meet Count Salm\r\nfor tea at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, only you do not call it tea at Vienna but you\r\nseem to call it \xe2\x80\x9cyowzer\xe2\x80\x9d and you do not drink tea at Vienna but you\r\ndrink coffee instead. I mean it is quite unusual to see all of the\r\ngentlemen at Vienna stop work, to go to yowzer about one hour after\r\nthey have all finished their luncheon, but time really does not seem to\r\nmean so much to Viennese gentlemen except time to get to the coffee\r\nhouse, which they all seem to know by instincts, or else they really do\r\nnot seem to mind if they make a mistake and get there to early. Because\r\nMr. Eisman says that when it is time to attend to the button\r\nprofession, they really seem to lose all of their interest until Mr.\r\nEisman is getting so nervous he could scream.\r\n\r\nSo we went to Deimels and met Count Salm. But while we were having\r\nyowzer with Count Salm, we saw Mr. Spoffard\xe2\x80\x99s mother come in with her\r\ncompanion Miss Chapman, and Miss Chapman seemed to look at me quite a\r\nlot and talk to Mr. Spoffards mother about me quite a lot. So I became\r\nquite nervous, because I really wished that we were not with Count\r\nSalm. I mean it has been quite a hard thing to make Mr. Spoffard think\r\nthat I am trying to reform Dorothy, but if I had to try to make him\r\nthink that I was trying to reform Count Salm, he might begin to think\r\nthat there is a limit to almost everything. So Mr. Spoffards mother\r\nseems to be deaf, because she seems to use an ear trumpet and I really\r\ncould not help over hearing quite a lot of words that Miss Chapman was\r\nusing on me, even if it is not such good etiquet to overhear people. So\r\nMiss Chapman seemed to be telling Mr. Spoffards mother that I was a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccreature,\xe2\x80\x9d and she seemed to be telling her that I was the real reason\r\nwhy her son seemed to be so full of nothing but neglect lately. So then\r\nMr. Spoffards mother looked at me and looked at me, even if it was not\r\nsuch good etiquet to look at a person. And Miss Chapman kept right on\r\ntalking to Mr. Spoffards mother and I heard her mention Willie Gwynn\r\nand I think that Miss Chapman has been making some inquiries about me\r\nand I really think that she has heard about the time when all of the\r\nfamily of Willie Gwynn had quite a long talk with me and persuaded me\r\nnot to marry Willie Gwynn for $10,000. So I really wish Mr. Spoffard\r\nwould introduce me to his mother before she gets to be full of quite a\r\nlot of prejudice. Because one thing seems to be piling up on top of\r\nanother thing, until I am almost on the verge of getting nervous and I\r\nhave not had any time yet to do what Dr. Froyd said a girl ought to do.\r\n\r\nSo tonight I am going to tell Mr. Eisman that I have got to go to bed\r\nearly, so then I can take quite a long ride with Mr. Spoffard and look\r\nat nature, and he may say something definite, because nothing makes\r\ngentlemen get so definite as looking at nature when it is moonlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 30th:\r\n\r\nWell last night Mr. Spoffard and I took quite a long ride in the park,\r\nbut they do not call it a park in the Viennese landguage but they call\r\nit the Prater. So a prater is really devine because it is just like\r\nConey Island but at the same time it is in the woods and it is\r\npractically full of trees and it has quite a long road for people to\r\ntake rides on in a horse and buggy. So I found out that Miss Chapman\r\nhad been talking against me quite a lot. So it seems that she has been\r\nmaking inquiries about me, and I was really surprised to hear all of\r\nthe things that Miss Chapman seemed to find out about me except that\r\nshe did not find out about Mr. Eisman educating me. So then I had to\r\ntell Mr. Spoffard that I was not always so reformed as I am now,\r\nbecause the world was full of gentlemen who were nothing but wolfs in\r\nsheeps clothes, that did nothing but take advantadge of all we girls.\r\nSo I really cried quite a lot. So then I told him how I was just a\r\nlittle girl from Little Rock when I first left Little Rock and by that\r\ntime even Mr. Spoffard had tears in his eyes. So I told him how I came\r\nfrom a very very good family because papa was very intelectual, and he\r\nwas a very very prominent Elk, and everybody always said that he was a\r\nvery intelectual Elk. So I told Mr. Spoffard that when I left Little\r\nRock I thought that all of the gentlemen did not want to do anything\r\nbut protect we girls and by the time I found out that they did not want\r\nto protect us so much, it was to late. So then he cried quite a lot. So\r\nthen I told him how I finaly got reformed by reading all about him in\r\nthe newspapers and when I saw him in the oriental express it really\r\nseemed to be nothing but the result of fate. So I told Mr. Spoffard\r\nthat I thought a girl was really more reformed if she knew what it was\r\nto be unreformed than if she was born reformed and never really knew\r\nthat was the matter with her. So then Mr. Spoffard reached over and he\r\nkissed me on the forehead in a way that was full of reverance and he\r\nsaid I seemed to remind him quite a lot of a girl who got quite a\r\nwrite-up in the bible who was called Magdellen. So then he said that he\r\nused to be a member of the choir himself, so who was he to cast the\r\nfirst rock at a girl like I.\r\n\r\nSo we rode around in the Prater until it was quite late and it really\r\nwas devine because it was moonlight and we talked quite a lot about\r\nmorals, and all the bands in the prater were all playing in the\r\ndistants \xe2\x80\x9cMama love Papa\xe2\x80\x9d. Because \xe2\x80\x9cMama love Papa\xe2\x80\x9d has just reached\r\nVienna and they all seem to be crazy about \xe2\x80\x9cMama love Papa\xe2\x80\x9d even if it\r\nis not so new in America. So then he took me home to the hotel.\r\n\r\nSo everything always works out for the best, because this morning Mr.\r\nSpoffard called up and told me he wanted me to meet his mother. So I\r\ntold him I would like to have luncheon alone with his mother because we\r\ncould have quite a little tatatate if there was only two of us. So I\r\ntold him to bring his mother to our room for luncheon because I thought\r\nthat Miss Chapman could not walk into our room and spoil everything.\r\n\r\nSo he brought his mother down to our sitting room and I put on quite a\r\nsimple little organdy gown that I had ripped all of the trimming off\r\nof, and I had a pair of black lace mitts that Dorothy used to wear in\r\nthe Follies and I had a pair of shoes that did not have any heels on\r\nthem. So when he introduced us to each other I dropped her a courtesy\r\nbecause I always think it is quite quaint when a girl drops quite a lot\r\nof courtesys. So then he left us alone and we had quite a little talk\r\nand I told her that I did not seem to like all of the flappers that we\r\nseem to have nowadays, because I was brought up to be more old\r\nfashioned. So then Mr. Spoffards mother told me that Miss Chapman said\r\nthat she had heard that I was not so old fashioned. But I told her that\r\nI was so old fashioned that I was always full of respect for all of my\r\nelders and I would not dare to tell them everything they ought to do,\r\nlike Miss Chapman seems to tell her everything she ought to do, for\r\ninstants.\r\n\r\nSo then I ordered luncheon and I thought some champagne would make her\r\nfeel quite good for luncheon so I asked her if she liked champagne. So\r\nshe really likes champagne very very much but Miss Chapman thinks it is\r\nnot so nice for a person to drink liquor. But I told her that I was a\r\nChristian science, and all of we Christian science seem to believe that\r\nthere can not really be any harm in anything, so how can there be any\r\nharm in a small size bottle of champagne? So she never seemed to look\r\nat it in that kind of a light before, because she said that Miss\r\nChapman believed in Christian science also, but what Miss Chapman\r\nbelieved about things that were good for you to drink seemed to apply\r\nmore towards water. So then we had luncheon and she began to feel very\r\nvery good. So I thought that we had better have another bottle of\r\nchampagne because I told her that I was such an ardent Christian\r\nscience that I did not even believe there could be any harm in two\r\nbottles of champagne. So we had another bottle of champagne and she\r\nbecame very intreeged about Christian science because she said that she\r\nreally thought it was a better religion than Prespyterians. So she said\r\nMiss Chapman used to try to get her to use it on things, but Miss\r\nChapman never seemed to have such a large size grasp of the Christian\r\nscience religion as I seem to have.\r\n\r\nSo then I told her that I thought Miss Chapman was jealous of her good\r\nlooks. So then she said that that was true, because Miss Chapman would\r\nalways make her wear hats that were made out of black horses hair\r\nbecause horses hair does not weigh so much on a persons brain. So I\r\ntold her I was going to give her one of my hats that has got quite\r\nlarge size roses on it. So then I got it out, but we could not get it\r\non her head because hats are quite small on account of hair being\r\nbobbed. So I thought I would get the sissors and bob her head, but then\r\nI thought I had done enough to her for one day.\r\n\r\nSo Henry\xe2\x80\x99s mother said that I was really the most sunshine that she\r\never had in all her life and when Henry came back to take his Mother up\r\nto her room, she did not want to go. But after he got her away he\r\ncalled me up on the telephone and he was qiute excited and he said he\r\nwanted to ask me something that was very very important. So I said I\r\nwould see him tonight.\r\n\r\nBut now I have got to see Mr. Eisman because I have an idea about doing\r\nsomething that is really very very important that has got to be done at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 31st:\r\n\r\nWell I and Dorothy and Mr. Eisman are on a train going to a place\r\ncalled Buda Pest. So I did not see Henry again before I left, but I\r\nleft him a letter. Because I thought it would be a quite good thing if\r\nwhat he wanted to ask me he would have to write down, instead of asking\r\nme, and he could not write it to me if I was in the same city that he\r\nis in. So I told him in my letter that I had to leave in five minute\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntime because I found out that Dorothy was just on the verge of getting\r\nvery unreformed, and if I did not get her away, all I had done for her\r\nwould really go for nothing. So I told him to write down what he had to\r\nsay to me, and mail it to me at the Ritz hotel in Buda Pest. Because I\r\nalways seem to believe in the old addage, Say it in writing.\r\n\r\nSo it was really very easy to get Mr. Eisman to leave Vienna, because\r\nyesterday he went out to see the button factory but it seems that all\r\nof the people at the button factory were not at work but they were\r\ngiving a birthday party to some saint. So it seems that every time some\r\nsaint has a birthday they all stop work so they can give it a birthday\r\nparty. So Mr. Eisman looked at their calendar, and found out that some\r\nsaint or other was born practically every week in the year. So he has\r\ndecided that America is good enough for him.\r\n\r\nSo Henry will not be able to follow me to Buda Pest because his mother\r\nis having treatments by Dr. Froyd and she seems to be a much more\r\ndifficult case than I seem to be. I mean it is quite hard for Dr.\r\nFroyd, because she cannot seem to remember which is a dream and which\r\nreally happened to her. So she tells him everything, and he has to use\r\nhis judgement. I mean when she tells him that a very very handsome\r\nyoung gentleman tried to flirt with her on Fifth Avenue, he uses his\r\njudgement.\r\n\r\nSo we will soon be at a Ritz hotel again and I must say it will be\r\ndelightful to find a Ritz hotel right in the central of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 1st:\r\n\r\nWell yesterday Henrys letter came and it says in black and white that\r\nhe and his mother have never met such a girl as I and he wants me to\r\nmarry him. So I took Henrys letter to the photographers and I had quite\r\na lot of photographs taken of it because a girl might lose Henrys\r\nletter and she would not have anything left to remember him by. But\r\nDorothy says to hang on to Henry\xe2\x80\x99s letter, because she really does not\r\nthink the photographs do it justice.\r\n\r\nSo this afternoon I got a telegram from Henry and the telegram says\r\nthat Henry\xe2\x80\x99s father is very, very ill in New York and they have got to\r\nleave for New York immediately and his heart is broken not to see me\r\nagain and to send him my answer by telegraph so that his mind will be\r\nrested while he is going back to New York. So I sent him a telegram and\r\nI accepted his proposal. So tonight I got another telegram and Henry\r\nsays that he and his mother are very very happy and Henrys mother can\r\nhardly bear Miss Chapman any more and Henry says he hopes I will decide\r\nto come right back to New York and keep his mother quite a lot of\r\ncompany, because he thinks I can reform Dorothy more in New York\r\nanyway, where there is prohibition and nobody can get anything to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nSo now I have got to make up my mind whether I really want to marry\r\nHenry after all. Because I know to much to get married to any gentleman\r\nlike Henry without thinking it all over. Because Henry is the kind of a\r\ngentleman who gets on a girls nerves quite a lot and when a gentleman\r\nhas nothing else to do but get on a girls nerves, there really seems to\r\nbe a limit to almost everything. Because when a gentleman has a\r\nbusiness, he has an office and he has to be there, but when a\r\ngentlemans business is only looking into other peoples business, a\r\ngentleman is always on the verge of coming in and out of the house. And\r\na girl could not really say that her time was her own. And when Henry\r\nwas not in and out of the house, his mother would always be in and out\r\nof the house because she seems to think that I am so full of nothing\r\nbut sunshine. So it is quite a problem and I seem to be in quite a\r\nquarandary, because it might really be better if Henry should happen to\r\ndecide that he should not get married, and he should change his mind,\r\nand desert a girl, and then it would only be right if a girl should sue\r\nhim for a breach of promise.\r\n\r\nBut I really think, whatever happens, that Dorothy and I had better get\r\nback to New York. So I will see if Mr. Eisman will send us back. I mean\r\nI really do not think that Mr. Eisman will mind us going back because\r\nif he does, I will start shopping again and that always seems to bring\r\nhim to terms. But all the time I am going back to New York, I will have\r\nto try to make up my mind one way or another. Because we girls really\r\ncan not help it, if we have ideals, and sometimes my mind seems to get\r\nto running on things that are romantic, and I seem to think that maybe\r\nthere is some place in the world where there is a gentleman who knows\r\nhow to look and act like Count Salm and who has got money besides. And\r\nwhen a girls mind gets to thinking about such a romantic thing, a girls\r\nmind really does not seem to know whether to marry Henry or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\nBRAINS ARE REALLY EVERYTHING\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 14th:\r\n\r\nWell, Dorothy and I arrived at New York yesterday because Mr. Eisman\r\nfinally decided to send us home because he said that all of his button\r\nprofession would not stand the strain of educating me much more in\r\nEurope. So we separated from Mr. Eisman in Buda Pest because Mr. Eisman\r\nhad to go to Berlin to look up all of his starving relatives in Berlin,\r\nwho have done nothing but starve since the War, so he wrote me just\r\nbefore we sailed and he said that he had dug up all his starving\r\nrelatives and he had looked them all over, and decided not to bring\r\nthem to America because there was not one of his starving relatives who\r\ncould travel on a railroad ticket without paying excess fare for\r\noverweight.\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy and I took the boat and all the way over on the boat I had\r\nto make up my mind whether I really wanted to marry the famous Henry H.\r\nSpoffard, or not, because he was waiting for me to arrive at New York\r\nand he was so impatient that he could hardly wait for me to arrive at\r\nNew York. But I have not wasted all of my time on Henry, even if I do\r\nnot marry him, because I have some letters from Henry which would come\r\nin very, very handy if I did not marry Henry. So Dorothy seems to agree\r\nwith me quite a lot, because Dorothy says the only thing she could\r\nstand being to Henry, would be to be his widow at the age of 18.\r\n\r\nSo coming over on the boat I decided not to bother to meet any\r\ngentleman, because what good does it do to meet gentlemen when there is\r\nnothing to do on a boat but go shopping at a little shop where they do\r\nnot have any thing that costs more than five dollars. And besides if I\r\ndid meet any gentleman on the boat, he would want to see me off the\r\nboat, and then we would bump into Henry. But then I heard that there\r\nwas a gentleman on the boat who was quite a dealer in unset diamonds\r\nfrom a town called Amsterdam. So I met the gentleman, and we went\r\naround together quite a lot, but we had quite a quarrel the night\r\nbefore we landed, so I did not even bother to look at him when I came\r\ndown the gangplank, and I put the unset diamonds in my handbag so I did\r\nnot have to declare them at the customs.\r\n\r\nSo Henry was waiting for me at the customs, because he had come up from\r\nPennsylvania to meet me, because their country estate is at\r\nPennsylvania, and Henry\xe2\x80\x99s father is very, very ill at Pennsylvania, so\r\nHenry has to stay there practically all of the time. So all of the\r\nreporters were at the customs and they all heard about how Henry and I\r\nwere engaged to one another and they wanted to know what I was before I\r\nbecame engaged to Henry, so I told them that I was nothing but a\r\nsociety girl from Little Rock, Arkansas. So then I became quite angry\r\nwith Dorothy because one of the reporters asked Dorothy when I made my\r\ndebut in society at Little Rock and Dorothy said I made my debut at the\r\nElks annual street fair and carnival at the age of 15, I mean Dorothy\r\nnever overlooks any chance to be unrefined, even when she is talking to\r\nliterary gentlemen like reporters.\r\n\r\nSo Henry brought me to the apartment in his Rolls Royce, and while we\r\nwere coming to the apartment he said he wanted to give me my engagement\r\nring and I really became all thrills. So he said that he had gone to\r\nCartiers and he had looked over all the engagement rings in Cartiers\r\nand after he had looked them all over he had decided that they were not\r\nhalf good enough for me. So then he took a box out of his pocket and I\r\nreally became intreeged. So then Henry said that when he looked at all\r\nof those large size diamonds he really felt that they did not have any\r\nsentiment, so he was going to give me his class ring from Amherst\r\nCollege insted. So then I looked at him and looked at him, but I am to\r\nfull of self controle to say anything at this stage of the game, so I\r\nsaid it was really very sweet of him to be so full of nothing but\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\nSo then Henry said that he would have to go back to Pennsylvania to\r\ntalk to his father about us getting married, because his father has\r\nreally got his heart set on us not getting married. So I told Henry\r\nthat perhaps if I would meet his father, I would win him over, because\r\nI always seem to win gentlemen over. But Henry says that that is just\r\nthe trouble, because some girl is always winning his father over, and\r\nthey hardly dare to let him go out of their sight, and they hardly dare\r\nlet him go to church alone. Because the last time he went to church\r\nalone some girl won him over on the street corner and he arrived back\r\nhome with all of his pocket money gone, and they could not believe him\r\nwhen he said that he had put it in the plate, because he has not put\r\nmore than a dime in the plate for the last fifty years.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that the real reason why his father does not want Henry to\r\nmarry me, is because his father says that Henry always has all of the\r\nfun, and every time Henry\xe2\x80\x99s father wants to have some fun of his own,\r\nHenry always stops him and Henry will not even let him be sick at a\r\nhospital where he could have some fun of his own, but he keeps him at\r\nhome where he has to have a nurse Henry picked out for him who is a\r\nmale nurse. So all of his objections seem to be nothing but the spirit\r\nof resiprosity. But Henry says that all his objections cannot last much\r\nlonger because he is nearly 90 years of age after all, and Nature must\r\ntake its course sooner or later.\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy says what a fool I am to waste my time on Henry, when I\r\nmight manage to meet Henry\xe2\x80\x99s father and the whole thing would be over\r\nin a few months and I would practically own the state of Pennsylvania.\r\nBut I do not think I ought to take Dorothy\xe2\x80\x99s advise because Henry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather is watched like a hawk and Henry himself is his Power of\r\nAttorney, so no good could really come of it after all. And, after all,\r\nwhy should I listen to the advise of a girl like Dorothy who travelled\r\nall over Europe and all she came home with was a bangle!\r\n\r\nSo Henry spent the evening at the apartment and then he had to go back\r\nto Pennsylvania to be there Thursday morning, because every Thursday\r\nmorning he belongs to a society who do nothing but senshure all of the\r\nphotoplays. So they cut out all of the pieces out of all the photoplays\r\nthat show things that are riskay, that people ought not to look at. So\r\nthen they put all of the riskay pieces together and they run them over\r\nand over again. So it would really be quite a hard thing to drag Henry\r\naway from one of his Thursday mornings and he can hardly wait from one\r\nThursday morning to another. Because he really does not seem to enjoy\r\nanything so much as senshuring photoplays and after a photoplay has\r\nonce been senshured he seems to lose all of his interest in it.\r\n\r\nSo after Henry left I held quite a conversation with Lulu, who is my\r\nmaid who looked out for my apartment while I was away. So Lulu really\r\nthinks I ought to marry Mr. Spoffard after all, because Lulu says that\r\nshe kept studying Mr. Spoffard all of the time she was unpacking my\r\ntrunks, and Lulu says she is sure that any time I feel as if I had to\r\nget away from Mr. Spoffard I could just set him down on the floor, and\r\ngive him a packet of riskay french postcards to senshure and stay away\r\nas long as I like.\r\n\r\nSo Henry is going to arrange for me to come down to Pennsylvania for a\r\nweek-end and meet all of his family. But if all of Henry\xe2\x80\x99s family are\r\nas full of reforms as Henry seems to be, it will be quite an ordeal\r\neven for a girl like I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 15th:\r\n\r\nYesterday morning was quite an ordeal for a refined girl because all of\r\nthe newspapers all printed the story of how Henry and I are engaged to\r\none another, but they all seemed to leave out the part about me being a\r\nsociety girl except one newspaper, and that was the newspaper that\r\nquoted what Dorothy said about me being a debutant at the Elk\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCarnival. So I called up Dorothy at the Ritz and I told Dorothy that a\r\ngirl like she ought to keep her mouth closed in the presents of\r\nreporters.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that quite a lot of reporters kept calling Dorothy up but\r\nDorothy said she really did not say anything to any of them except one\r\nreporter asked her what I used for money and she told him buttons. But\r\nDorothy really should not have said such a thing, because quite a few\r\npeople seem to know that Mr. Eisman is educating me and that he is\r\nknown all over Chicago as Gus Eisman the Button King, so one thing\r\nmight suggest another until people\xe2\x80\x99s minds might begin to think\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nBut Dorothy said that she did not say anything more about me being a\r\ndebutant at Little Rock, because after all Dorothy knows that I really\r\ndid not make any debut in Little Rock, because just when it was time to\r\nmake my debut, my gentleman friend Mr. Jennings became shot, and after\r\nthe trial was over and all of the Jury had let me off, I was really\r\nmuch to fatigued to make any debut.\r\n\r\nSo then Dorothy said, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we throw a party now and you can become\r\na debutant now and put them all in their place, because it seems that\r\nDorothy is dying for a party. So that is really the first sensible\r\nsuggestion that Dorothy has made yet, because I think that every girl\r\nwho is engaged to a gentleman who has a fine old family like Henry, had\r\nreally ought to be a debutant. So I told her to come right over and we\r\nwould plan my debut but we would keep it very, very quiet and give it\r\ntomorrow night, because if Henry heard I was making my debut he would\r\ncome up from Pennsylvania and he would practically spoil the party,\r\nbecause all Henry has to do to spoil a party is to arrive at it.\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy came over and we planned my debut. So first we decided to\r\nhave some engraved invitations engraved, but it always takes quite a\r\nlittle time to have invitations engraved, and it would really be\r\nfoolish because all of the gentlemen we were going to invite to my\r\ndebut were all members of the Racquet Club, so I could just write out a\r\nnotice that I was having a debut and give it to Willie Gwynn and have\r\nWillie Gwynn post it on the Racquet Club board.\r\n\r\nSo Willie Gwynn posted it on the club board and then he called me up\r\nand he told me that he had never seen so much enthusiasm since the\r\nDempsey-Firpo fight, and he said that the whole Racquet Club would be\r\nthere in a body. So then we had to plan about what girls we would ask\r\nto my debut. Because I have not seemed to meet so many society women\r\nyet because of course a girl does not meet society women until her\r\ndebut is all over, and then all the society women all come and call on\r\na debutant. But I know practically all of the society men, because\r\npractically all of the society men belong to the Racquet club, so after\r\nI have the Racquet Club at my debut, all I have to do to take my real\r\nplace in society is to meet their mothers and sisters, because I know\r\npractically all of their sweethearts now.\r\n\r\nBut I always seem to think that it is delightful to have quite a lot of\r\ngirls at a party, if a girl has quite a lot of gentlemen at a party,\r\nand it is quite delightful to have all the girls from the Follies, but\r\nI really could not invite them because, after all, they are not in my\r\nset. So then I thought it all over and I thought that even if it was\r\nnot etiquette to invite them to a party, it really would be etiquette\r\nto hire them to come to a party and be entertainers, and after they\r\nwere entertainers they could mix in to the party and it really would\r\nnot be a social error.\r\n\r\nSo then the telephone rang and Dorothy answered it and it seems that it\r\nwas Joe Sanguinetti, who is almost the official bootlegger for the\r\nwhole Racquet Club, and Joe said he had heard about my debut and if he\r\ncould come to my debut and bring his club which is the Silver Spray\r\nSocial Club of Brooklyn, he would supply all of the liquor and he would\r\nguarantee to practically run the rum fleet up to the front door.\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy told him he could come, and she hung up the telephone before\r\nshe told me his proposition, and I became quite angry with Dorothy\r\nbecause, after all, the Silver Spray Social Club is not even mentioned\r\nin the Social Register and it has no place at a girl\xe2\x80\x99s debut. But\r\nDorothy said by the time the party got into swing, anyone would have to\r\nbe a genius if he could tell whether he belonged to the Racquet Club,\r\nthe Silver Spray Social Club, or the Knights of Pythias. But I really\r\nwas almost sorry that I asked Dorothy to help plan my debut, except\r\nthat Dorothy is very good to have at a party if the police come in,\r\nbecause Dorothy always knows how to manage the police, and I never knew\r\na policeman yet who did not finish up by being madly in love with\r\nDorothy. So then Dorothy called up all of the reporters on all of the\r\nnewspapers and invited them all to my debut, so they could see it with\r\ntheir own eyes.\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy says that she is going to see to it that my debut lands on\r\nthe front page of all of the newspapers, if we have to commit a murder\r\nto do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 19th:\r\n\r\nWell, it has been three days since my debut party started but I finally\r\ngot tired and left the party last night and went to bed because I\r\nalways seem to lose all of my interest in a party after a few days, but\r\nDorothy never loses her interest in a party and when I woke up this\r\nmorning Dorothy was just saying goodbye to some of the guests. I mean\r\nDorothy seems to have quite a lot of vitality, because the last guests\r\nof the party were guests we picked up when the party went to take a\r\nswim at Long Beach the day before yesterday, and they were practically\r\nfresh, but Dorothy had gone clear through the party from beginning to\r\nend without even stopping to go to a Turkish bath as most of the\r\ngentlemen had to do. So my debut has really been very novel, because\r\nquite a lot of the guests who finished up at my debut were not the same\r\nguests that started out at it, and it is really quite novel for a girl\r\nto have so many different kinds of gentlemen at her debut. So it has\r\nreally been a very great success because all of the newspapers have\r\nquite a lot of write-ups about my debut and I really felt quite proud\r\nwhen I saw the front page of the Daily Views and it said in large size\r\nheadlines, \xe2\x80\x9cLORELEI\xe2\x80\x99S DEBUT A WOW!\xe2\x80\x9d And Zits\xe2\x80\x99 Weekly came right out and\r\nsaid that if this party marks my entrance into society, they only hope\r\nthat they can live to see what I will spring once I have overcome my\r\ndebutant reserve and taken my place in the world.\r\n\r\nSo I really had to apologise to Dorothy about asking Joe Sanguinetti to\r\nmy debut because it was wonderful the way he got all of the liquor to\r\nthe party and he more than kept his word. I mean he had his bootleggers\r\nrun up from the wharf in taxis, right to the apartment, and the only\r\ntrouble he had was, that once the bootleggers delivered the liquor, he\r\ncould not get them to leave the party. So finally there was quite a\r\nlittle quarrel because Willie Gwynn claimed that Joe\xe2\x80\x99s bootleggers were\r\nsnubbing the members of his club because they would not let the boys\r\nfrom the Racquet club sing in their quartet. But Joe\xe2\x80\x99s bootleggers said\r\nthat the Racquet club boys wanted to sing songs that were unrefined,\r\nwhile they wanted to sing songs about Mother. So then everybody started\r\nto take sides, but the girls from the Follies were all with Joe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbootleggers from the start because practically all we girls were\r\nlistening to them with tears steaming from our eyes. So that made the\r\nRacquet club jealous and one thing led to another until somebody rang\r\nfor an ambulants and then the police came in.\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy, as usual, won over all of the police. So it seems that the\r\npolice all have orders from Judge Schultzmeyer, who is the famous judge\r\nwho tries all of the prohibition cases, that any time they break into a\r\nparty that looks like it was going to be a good party, to call him up\r\nno matter what time of the day or night it is, because Judge\r\nSchultzmeyer dearly loves a party. So the Police called up Judge\r\nSchultzmeyer and he was down in less than no time. So during the party\r\nboth Joe Sanguinetti and Judge Schultzmeyer fell madly in love with\r\nDorothy. So Joe and the Judge had quite a little quarrel and the Judge\r\ntold Joe that if his stuff was fit to drink he would set the Law after\r\nhim and confiscate it, but his stuff was not worth the while of any\r\ngentleman to confiscate who had any respect for his stomach, and he\r\nwould not lower himself to confiscate it. So along about nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nin the morning Judge Schultzmeyer had to leave the party and go to\r\ncourt to try all of the criminals who break all of the laws, so he had\r\nto leave Dorothy and Joe together and he was very very angry. And I\r\nreally felt quite sorry for any person who went up before Judge\r\nSchultzmeyer that morning, because he gave everybody 90 days and was\r\nback at the party by twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock. So then he stuck to the party\r\nuntil we were all going down to Long Beach to take a swim day before\r\nyesterday when he seemed to become unconscious, so we dropped him off\r\nat a sanitorium in Garden City.\r\n\r\nSo my debut party was really the greatest success of the social season,\r\nbecause the second night of my debut party was the night when Willie\r\nGwynn\xe2\x80\x99s sister was having a dance at the Gwynn estate on Long Island,\r\nand Willie Gwynn said that all of the eligible gentlemen in New York\r\nwere conspicuous by their absents at his sister\xe2\x80\x99s party, because they\r\nwere all at my party. So it seems as if I am really going to be quite a\r\nfamous hostess if I can just bring my mind to the point of being Mrs.\r\nHenry Spoffard Jr.\r\n\r\nWell Henry called up this morning and Henry said he had finally got his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s mind so that he thought it was safe for me to meet him and he\r\nwas coming up to get me this afternoon so that I can meet his family\r\nand see his famous old historical home at Pennsylvania. So then he\r\nasked about my debut party which some of the Philadelphia papers seemed\r\nto mention. But I told him that my debut was really not so much\r\nplanned, as it was spontaneous, and I did not have the heart to call\r\nhim up at a moments notice and take him away from his father at such a\r\ntime for reasons which were nothing but social.\r\n\r\nSo now I am getting ready to visit Henry\xe2\x80\x99s family and I feel as if my\r\nwhole future depends on it. Because if I can not stand Henry\xe2\x80\x99s family\r\nany more than I can stand Henry the whole thing will probly come to an\r\nend in the law court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 21st:\r\n\r\nWell, I am now spending the weekend with Henry\xe2\x80\x99s family at his old\r\nfamily mansion outside of Philadelphia, and I am beginning to think,\r\nafter all, that there is something else in the world besides family.\r\nAnd I am beginning to think that family life is only fit for those who\r\ncan stand it. For instants, they always seem to get up very early in\r\nHenry\xe2\x80\x99s family. I mean it really is not so bad to get up early when\r\nthere is something to get up early about, but when a girl gets up early\r\nand there is nothing to get up early about, it really begins to seem as\r\nif there was no sense to it.\r\n\r\nSo yesterday we all got up early and that was when I met all of Henry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfamily, because Henry and I motored down to Pennsylvania and everybody\r\nwas in bed when we arrived because it was after nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock. So in the\r\nmorning Henry\xe2\x80\x99s mother came to my room to get me up in time for\r\nbreakfast because Henry\xe2\x80\x99s mother is very very fond of me, and she\r\nalways wants to copy all of my gowns and she always loves to look\r\nthrough all of my things to see what I have got. So she found a box of\r\nliqueur candies that are full of liqueurs and she was really very\r\ndelighted. So I finally got dressed and she threw the empty box away\r\nand I helped her down stairs to the Dining room.\r\n\r\nSo Henry was waiting in the dining room with his sister and that was\r\nwhen I met his sister. So it seems that Henry\xe2\x80\x99s sister has never been\r\nthe same since the war, because she never had on a man\xe2\x80\x99s collar and a\r\nnecktie until she drove an ambulants in the war, and now they cannot\r\nget her to take them off. Because ever since the armistice Henry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsister seems to have the idea that regular womens clothes are\r\neffiminate. So Henry\xe2\x80\x99s sister seems to think of nothing but either\r\nhorses or automobiles and when she is not in a garage the only other\r\nplace she is happy in is a stable. I mean she really pays very little\r\nattention to all of her family and she seems to pay less attention to\r\nHenry than anybody else because she seems to have the idea that Henry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrains are not so viril. So then we all waited for Henry\xe2\x80\x99s father to\r\ncome in so that he could read the Bible out loud before breakfast.\r\n\r\nSo then something happened that really was a miracle. Because it seems\r\nthat Henry\xe2\x80\x99s father has practically lived in a wheel chair for months\r\nand months and his male nurse has to wheel him everywhere. So his male\r\nnurse wheeled him into the dining room in his wheel chair and then\r\nHenry said \xe2\x80\x9cFather, this is going to be your little daughter in law,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand Henry\xe2\x80\x99s father took one good look at me and got right out of his\r\nwheel chair and walked! So then everybody was very very surprised, but\r\nHenry was not so surprised because Henry knows his father like a book.\r\nSo then they all tried to calm his father down, and his father tried to\r\nread out of the Bible but he could hardly keep his mind on the Bible\r\nand he could hardly eat a bite because when a gentleman is as feeble as\r\nHenry\xe2\x80\x99s father is, he cannot keep one eye on a girl and the other eye\r\non his cereal and cream without coming to grief. So Henry finally\r\nbecame quite discouradged and he told his father he would have to get\r\nback to his room or he would have a relapse. So then the male nurse\r\nwheeled him back to his room and it really was pathetic because he\r\ncried like a baby. So I got to thinking over what Dorothy advised me\r\nabout Henry\xe2\x80\x99s father and I really got to thinking that if Henry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather could only get away from everybody and have some time of his\r\nown, Dorothy\xe2\x80\x99s advise might not be so bad after all.\r\n\r\nSo after breakfast we all got ready to go to church, but Henry\xe2\x80\x99s sister\r\ndoes not go to church because Henry\xe2\x80\x99s sister always likes to spend\r\nevery Sunday in the garage taking their Ford farm truck apart and\r\nputting it back together again, and Henry says that what the war did to\r\na girl like his sister is really worse than the war itself.\r\n\r\nSo then Henry and his mother and I all went to church. So we came home\r\nfrom church and we had luncheon and it seems that luncheon is\r\npractically the same as breakfast except that Henry\xe2\x80\x99s father could not\r\ncome down to luncheon because after he met me he contracted such a\r\nvialent fever that they had to send for the Doctor.\r\n\r\nSo in the afternoon Henry went to prayer meeting and I was left alone\r\nwith Henry\xe2\x80\x99s mother so that we could rest up so that we could go to\r\nchurch again after supper. So Henry\xe2\x80\x99s mother thinks I am nothing but\r\nsunshine and she will hardly let me get out of her sight, because she\r\nhates to be by herself because, when she is by herself, her brains\r\nhardly seem to work at all. So she loves to try on all of my hats and\r\nshe loves to tell me how all the boys in the choir can hardly keep\r\ntheir eyes off her. So of course a girl has to agree with her, and it\r\nis quite difficult to agree with a person when you have to do it\r\nthrough an ear trumpet because sooner or later your voice has to give\r\nout.\r\n\r\nSo then supper turned out to be practically the same thing as luncheon\r\nonly by supper time all of the novelty seemed to wear off. So then I\r\ntold Henry that I had to much of a headache to go to church again, so\r\nHenry and his mother went to church and I went to my room and I sat\r\ndown and thought and I decided that life was really to short to spend\r\nit in being proud of your family, even if they did have a great deal of\r\nmoney. So the best thing for me to do is to think up some scheme to\r\nmake Henry decide not to marry me and take what I can get out of it and\r\nbe satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 22nd:\r\n\r\nWell, yesterday I made Henry put me on the train at Philadelphia and I\r\nmade him stay at Philadelphia so he could be near his father if his\r\nfather seemed to take any more relapses. So I sat in my drawing room on\r\nthe train and I decided that the time had come to get rid of Henry at\r\nany cost. So I decided that the thing that discouradges gentlemen more\r\nthan anything else is shopping. Because even Mr. Eisman, who was\r\npractically born for we girls to shop on, and who knows just what to\r\nexpect, often gets quite discouradged over all of my shopping. So I\r\ndecided I would get to New York and I would go to Cartiers and run up\r\nquite a large size bill on Henry\xe2\x80\x99s credit, because after all our\r\nengagement has been announced in all of the newspapers, and Henry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncredit is really my credit.\r\n\r\nSo while I was thinking it all over there was a knock on the drawing\r\nroom door, so I told him to come in and it was a gentleman who said he\r\nhad seen me quite a lot in New York and he had always wanted to have an\r\nintroduction to me, because we had quite a lot of friends who were\r\ncommon. So then he gave me his card and his name was on his card and it\r\nwas Mr. Gilbertson Montrose and his profession is a senario writer. So\r\nthen I asked him to sit down and we held a literary conversation.\r\n\r\nSo I really feel as if yesterday was a turning point in my life,\r\nbecause at last I have met a gentleman who is not only an artist but\r\nwho has got brains besides. I mean he is the kind of a gentleman that a\r\ngirl could sit at his feet and listen to for days and days and nearly\r\nalways learn something or other. Because, after all, there is nothing\r\nthat gives a girl more of a thrill than brains in a gentleman,\r\nespecially after a girl has been spending the week end with Henry. So\r\nMr. Montrose talked and talked all of the way to New York and I sat\r\nthere and did nothing else but listen. So according to Mr. Montrose\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopinion Shakespear is a very great playwrite, and he thinks that Hamlet\r\nis quite a famous tragedy and as far as novels are concerned he\r\nbelieves that nearly everybody had ought to read Dickens. And when we\r\ngot on the subject of poetry he recited \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shooting of Dan McGrew\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nuntil you could almost hear the gun go off.\r\n\r\nAnd then I asked Mr. Montrose to tell me all about himself. So it seems\r\nthat Mr. Montrose was on his way home from Washington D. C., where he\r\nwent to see the Bulgarian Ambassadore to see if he could get Bulgaria\r\nto finance a senario he has written which is a great historical subject\r\nwhich is founded on the sex life of Dolly Madison. So it seems that Mr.\r\nMontrose has met quite a lot of Bulgarians in a Bulgarian restaurant on\r\nLexington Avenue and that was what gave him the idea to get the money\r\nfrom Bulgaria. Because Mr. Montrose said that he could fill his senario\r\nfull of Bulgarian propoganda, and he told the Bulgarian Ambassadore\r\nthat every time he realised how ignorant all of the American film fans\r\nwere on the subject of Bulgaria, it made him flinch.\r\n\r\nSo I told Mr. Montrose that it made me feel very very small to talk to\r\na gentleman like he, who knew so much about Bulgaria, because\r\npractically all I knew about Bulgaria was Zoolack. So Mr. Montrose said\r\nthat the Bulgarian Ambassadore did not seem to think that Dolly Madison\r\nhad so much about her that was pertinent to present day Bulgaria, but\r\nMr. Montrose explained to him that that was because he knew practically\r\nnothing about dramatic construction. Because Mr. Montrose said he could\r\nfix his senario so that Dolly Madison would have one lover who was a\r\nBulgarian, who wanted to marry her. So then Dolly Madison would get to\r\nwondering what her great, great grandchildren would be like if she\r\nmarried a Bulgarian, and then she could sit down and have a vision of\r\nBulgaria in 1925. So that was when Mr. Montrose would take a trip to\r\nBulgaria to photograph the vision. But the Bulgarian Ambassadore turned\r\ndown the whole proposition, but he gave Mr. Montrose quite a large size\r\nbottle of the Bulgarian national drink. So the Bulgarian national drink\r\nlooks like nothing so much as water, and it really does not taste so\r\nstrong, but about five minutes afterwards you begin to realise your\r\nmistake. But I thought to myself that if realizing my mistake could\r\nmake me forget what I went through in Pennsylvania, I really owed it to\r\nmyself to forget everything. So then we had another drink.\r\n\r\nSo then Mr. Montrose told me that he had quite a hard time getting\r\nalong in the motion picture profession, because all of his senarios are\r\nall over their head. Because when Mr. Montrose writes about sex, it is\r\nfull of sychology, but when everybody else writes about it, it is full\r\nof nothing but transparent negligays and ornamental bath tubs. And Mr.\r\nMontrose says that there is no future in the motion pictures until the\r\nmotion pictures get their sex motives straightened out, and realize\r\nthat a woman of 25 can have just as many sex problems as a flapper of\r\n16. Because Mr. Montrose likes to write about women of the world, and\r\nhe refuses to have women of the world played by small size girls of 15\r\nwho know nothing about life and who have not even been in the detention\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nSo we both arrived in New York before we realized it, and I got to\r\nthinking how the same trip with Henry in his Rolls Royce seemed like\r\nabout 24 hours, and that was what gave me the idea that money was not\r\neverything, because after all, it is only brains that count. So Mr.\r\nMontrose took me home and we are going to have luncheon together at the\r\nPrimrose Tea room practically every day and keep right on holding\r\nliterary conversations.\r\n\r\nSo then I had to figure out how to get rid of Henry and at the same\r\ntime not do anything that would make me any trouble later. So I sent\r\nfor Dorothy because Dorothy is not so good at intreeging a gentleman\r\nwith money, but she ought to be full of ideas on how to get rid of one.\r\n\r\nSo at first Dorothy said, Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t I take a chance and marry Henry\r\nbecause she had an idea that if Henry married me he would commit\r\nsuicide about two weeks later. But I told her about my plan to do quite\r\na lot of shopping, and I told her that I would send for Henry and I\r\nwould manage it so that I would not be in the apartment when he came,\r\nbut she could be there and start a conversation with him and she could\r\ntell him about all of my shopping and how extravagant I seemed to be\r\nand he would be in the poor house in less than a year if he married me.\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy said for me to take one farewell look at Henry and leave him\r\nto her, because the next time I saw him would be in the witness box and\r\nI might not even recognize him because she would throw a scare into him\r\nthat might change his whole physical appearance. So I decided to leave\r\nhim in the hands of Dorothy and hope for the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 10th:\r\n\r\nWell, last month was really almost a diary in itself, and I have to\r\nbegin to realize that I am one of the kind of girls that things happen\r\nto. And I have to admit, after all, that life is really wonderful.\r\nBecause so much has happened in the last few weeks that it almost makes\r\na girl\xe2\x80\x99s brains whirl.\r\n\r\nI mean in the first place I went shopping at Cartiers and bought quite\r\na delightful square cut emerald and quite a long rope of pearls on\r\nHenry\xe2\x80\x99s credit. So then I called up Henry on the long distants\r\ntelephone and told him that I wanted to see him quite a lot, so he was\r\nvery very pleased and he said that he would come right up to New York.\r\n\r\nSo then I told Dorothy to come to the apartment and be there when Henry\r\ncame, and to show Henry what I bought on his credit, and to tell him\r\nhow extravagant I seem to be, and how I seem to keep on getting worse.\r\nSo I told Dorothy to go as far as she liked, so long as she did not\r\ninsinuate anything against my character, because the more spotless my\r\ncharacter seems to be, the better things might turn out later. So Henry\r\nwas due at the apartment about 1.20, so I had Lulu get some luncheon\r\nfor he and Dorothy and I told Dorothy to tell him that I had gone out\r\nto look at the Russian Crown Jewels that some Russian Grand Duchess or\r\nother had for sale at the Ritz.\r\n\r\nSo then I went to the Primrose Tea Room to have luncheon with Mr.\r\nMontrose because Mr. Montrose loves to tell me of all his plans, and he\r\nsays that I seem to remind him quite a lot of a girl called Madame\r\nRecamier who all the intelectual gentlemen used to tell all of their\r\nplans to, even when there was a French revolution going on all around\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Montrose and I had a delicious luncheon, except that I never\r\nseem to notice what I am eating when I am with Mr. Montrose because\r\nwhen Mr. Montrose talks a girl wants to do nothing but listen. But all\r\nof the time I was listening, I was thinking about Dorothy and I was\r\nworrying for fear Dorothy would go to far, and tell Henry something\r\nthat would not be so good for me afterwards. So finally even Mr.\r\nMontrose seemed to notice it, and he said \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter little\r\nwoman, a penny for your thoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo then I told him everything. So he seemed to think quite a lot and\r\nfinally he said to me \xe2\x80\x9cIt is really to bad that you feel as if the\r\nsocial life of Mr. Spoffard bored you, because Mr. Spoffard would be\r\nideal to finance my senario.\xe2\x80\x9d So then Mr. Montrose said that he had\r\nbeen thinking from the very first how ideal I would be to play Dolly\r\nMadison. So that started me thinking and I told Mr. Montrose that I\r\nexpected to have quite a large size ammount of money later on, and I\r\nwould finance it myself. But Mr. Montrose said that would be to late,\r\nbecause all of the motion picture corporations were after it now, and\r\nit would be snaped up almost immediately.\r\n\r\nSo then I became almost in a panick, because I suddenly decided that if\r\nI married Henry and worked in the motion pictures at the same time,\r\nsociety life with Henry would not really be so bad. Because if a girl\r\nwas so busy as all that, it really would not seem to matter so much if\r\nshe had to stand Henry when she was not busy. But then I realized what\r\nDorothy was up to, and I told Mr. Montrose that I was almost afraid it\r\nwas to late. So I hurried to the telephone and I called up Dorothy at\r\nthe apartment and I asked her what she had said to Henry. So Dorothy\r\nsaid that she showed him the square cut emerald and told him that I\r\nbought it as a knick-knack to go with a green dress, but I had got a\r\nspot on the dress, so I was going to give them both to Lulu. So she\r\nsaid she showed him the pearls and she said that after I had bought\r\nthem, I was sorry I did not get pink ones because white ones were so\r\ncommon, so I was going to have Lulu unstring them and sew them on a\r\nnegligay. So then she told him she was rather sorry I meant to buy the\r\nRussian Crown jewels because she had a feeling they were unlucky, but\r\nthat I had said to her, that if I found out they were, I could toss\r\nthem over my left shoulder into the Hudson river some night when there\r\nwas a new moon, and it would take away the curse.\r\n\r\nSo then she said that Henry began to get restless. So then she told him\r\nshe was very glad I was going to get married at last because I had had\r\nsuch bad luck, that every time I became engaged something seemed to\r\nhappen to my fiance. So Henry asked her what, for instance. So Dorothy\r\nsaid a couple were in the insane asylum, one had shot himself for debt,\r\nand the county farm was taking care of the remainder. So Henry asked\r\nher how they got that way. So Dorothy told him it was nothing but my\r\nextravagants, and she told him that she was surprised that he had never\r\nheard about it, because all I had to do was to take luncheon at the\r\nRitz with some prominent broker and the next day the bottom would drop\r\nout of the market. And she told him that she did not want to insinuate\r\nanything, but that I had dined with a very, very prominent German the\r\nday before German marks started to colapse.\r\n\r\nSo I became almost frantic and I told Dorothy to hold Henry at the\r\napartment until I could get up there and explain. So I held the\r\ntelephone while Dorothy went to see if Henry would wait. So Dorothy\r\ncame back in a minute and she said that the parlor was empty, but that\r\nif I would hurry down to Broadway no doubt I would see a cloud of dust\r\nheading towards the Pennsylvania station, and that would be Henry.\r\n\r\nSo then I went back to Mr. Montrose, and I told him that I must catch\r\nHenry at the Pennsylvania Station at any cost. And if anyone were to\r\nsay that we left the Primrose tea room in a hurry, they would be\r\nputting it quite mildly. So we got to the Pennsylvania station and I\r\njust had time to get on board the train to Philadelphia and I left Mr.\r\nMontrose standing at the train biting his finger nails in all of his\r\nanxiety. But I called out to him to go to his Hotel and I would\r\ntelephone the result as soon as the train arrived.\r\n\r\nSo then I went through the train, and there was Henry with a look on\r\nhis face which I shall never forget. So when he saw me he really seemed\r\nto shrink to \xc2\xbd his natural size. So I sat down beside him and I told\r\nhim that I was really ashamed of how he acted, and if his love for me\r\ncould not stand a little test that I and Dorothy had thought up, more\r\nin the spirit of fun than anything else, I never wanted to speak to\r\nsuch a gentleman again. And I told him that if he could not tell the\r\ndifference between a real square cut emerald and one from the ten cent\r\nstore, that he had ought to be ashamed of himself. And I told him that\r\nif he thought that every string of white beads were pearls, it was no\r\nwonder he could make such a mistake in judging the character of a girl.\r\nSo then I began to cry because of all of Henry\xe2\x80\x99s lack of faith. So then\r\nhe tried to cheer me up but I was to hurt to even give him a decent\r\nword until we were past Newark. But by the time we were past Newark,\r\nHenry was crying himself, and it always makes me feel so tender hearted\r\nto listen to a gentleman cry that I finally forgave him. So, of course,\r\nas soon as I got home I had to take them back to Cartiers.\r\n\r\nSo then I explained to Henry how I wanted our life to mean something\r\nand I wanted to make the World a better place than it seemed to have\r\nbeen yet. And I told him that he knew so much about the film profession\r\non account of senshuring all of the films that I thought he had ought\r\nto go into the film profession. Because I told him that a gentleman\r\nlike he really owed it to the world to make pure films so that he could\r\nbe an example to all of the other film corporations and show the world\r\nwhat pure films were like. So Henry became very, very intreeged because\r\nhe had never thought of the film profession before. So then I told him\r\nthat we could get H. Gilbertson Montrose to write the senarios, and he\r\nto senshure them, and I could act in them and by the time we all got\r\nthrough, they would be a work of art. But they would even be purer than\r\nmost works of art seem to be. So by the time we got to Philadelphia\r\nHenry said that he would do it, but he really did not think I had ought\r\nto act in them. But I told him from what I had seen of society women\r\ntrying to break into the films, I did not believe that it would be so\r\ndeclas\xc3\xa9e if one of them really landed. So I even talked him into that.\r\n\r\nSo when we got to Henry\xe2\x80\x99s country estate, we told all of Henry\xe2\x80\x99s family\r\nand they were all delighted. Because it is the first time since the war\r\nthat Henry\xe2\x80\x99s family have had anything definite to put their minds on. I\r\nmean Henry\xe2\x80\x99s sister really jumped at the idea because she said she\r\nwould take charge of the studio trucks and keep them at a bed-rock\r\nfigure. So I even promised Henry\xe2\x80\x99s mother that she could act in the\r\nfilms. I mean I even believe that we could put in a close-up of her\r\nfrom time to time, because after all, nearly every photoplay has to\r\nhave some comedy relief. And I promised Henry\xe2\x80\x99s father that we would\r\nwheel him through the studio and let him look at all of the actresses\r\nand he nearly had another relapse. So then I called up Mr. Montrose and\r\nmade an appointment with him to meet Henry and talk it all over, and\r\nMr. Montrose, said, \xe2\x80\x9cBless you, little woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo I am almost beginning to believe it, when everybody says I am\r\nnothing but sunshine because everybody I come into contract with always\r\nseems to become happy. I mean with the exception of Mr. Eisman. Because\r\nwhen I got back to New York, I opened all of his cablegrams and I\r\nrealized that he was due to arrive on the Aquitania the very next day.\r\nSo I met him at the Aquitania and I took him to luncheon at the Ritz\r\nand I told him all about everything. So then he became very, very\r\ndepressed because he said that just as soon as he had got me all\r\neducated, I had to go off and get married. But I told him that he\r\nreally ought to be very proud of me, because in the future, when he\r\nwould see me at luncheon at the Ritz as the wife of the famous Henry H.\r\nSpoffard, I would always bow to him, if I saw him, and he could point\r\nme out to all of his friends and tell them that it was he, Gus Eisman\r\nhimself, who educated me up to my station. So that cheered Mr. Eisman\r\nup a lot and I really do not care what he says to his friends, because,\r\nafter all, his friends are not in my set, and whatever he says to them\r\nwill not get around in my circle. So after our luncheon was all over, I\r\nreally think that, even if Mr. Eisman was not so happy, he could not\r\nhelp having a sort of a feeling of relief, especially when he thinks of\r\nall my shopping.\r\n\r\nSo after that came my wedding and all of the Society people in New York\r\nand Philadelphia came to my wedding and they were all so sweet to me,\r\nbecause practically every one of them has written a senario. And\r\neverybody says my wedding was very, very beautiful. I mean even Dorothy\r\nsaid it was very beautiful, only Dorothy said she had to concentrate\r\nher mind on the massacre of the Armenians to keep herself from laughing\r\nright out loud in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s face. But that only shows that not even\r\nMatrimony is sacred to a girl like Dorothy. And after the wedding was\r\nover, I overheard Dorothy talking to Mr. Montrose and she was telling\r\nMr. Montrose that she thought that I would be great in the movies if he\r\nwould write me a part that only had three expressions, Joy, Sorrow, and\r\nIndigestion. So I do not really believe that Dorothy is such a true\r\nfriend after all.\r\n\r\nSo Henry and I did not go on any honeymoon because I told Henry that it\r\nreally would be selfish for us to go off alone together, when all of\r\nour activities seemed to need us so much. Because, after all, I have to\r\nspend quite a lot of time with Mr. Montrose going over the senario\r\ntogether because, Mr. Montrose says I am full of nothing so much as\r\nideas.\r\n\r\nSo, in order to give Henry something to do while Mr. Montrose and I are\r\nworking on the senario I got Henry to organize a Welfare League among\r\nall of the extra girls and get them to tell him all of their problems\r\nso he can give them all of his spiritual aid. And it has really been a\r\nvery, very great success, because there is not much work going on at\r\nthe other studios at present so all of the extra girls have nothing\r\nbetter to do and they all know that Henry will not give them a job at\r\nour studio unless they belong. So the worse they tell Henry they have\r\nbeen before they met him, the better he likes it and Dorothy says that\r\nshe was at the studio yesterday and she says that if the senarios those\r\nextra girls have written around themselves to tell Henry could only be\r\nscreened and gotten past the sensors, the movies would move right up\r\nout of their infancy.\r\n\r\nSo Henry says that I have opened up a whole new world for him and he\r\nhas never been so happy in his life. And it really seems as if everyone\r\nI know has never been so happy in their lives. Because I make Henry let\r\nhis father come to the studio every day because, after all, every\r\nstudio has to have somebody who seems to be a pest, and in our case it\r\nmight just as well be Henry\xe2\x80\x99s father. So I have given orders to all of\r\nthe electricians not to drop any lights on him, but to let him have a\r\ngood time because, after all, it is the first one he has had. And as\r\nfar as Henry\xe2\x80\x99s mother is concerned, she is having her hair bobbed and\r\nher face lifted and getting ready to play Carmen because she saw a girl\r\ncalled Madam Calve play it when she was on her honeymoon and she has\r\nalways really felt that she could do it better. So I do not discouradge\r\nher, but I let her go ahead and enjoy herself. But I am not going to\r\nbother to speak to the electricians about Henry\xe2\x80\x99s mother. And Henry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsister has never been so happy since the Battle of Verdun, because she\r\nhas six trucks and 15 horses to look after and she says that the motion\r\npicture profession is the nearest thing to war that she has struck\r\nsince the Armistice. And even Dorothy is very happy because Dorothy\r\nsays that she has had more laughs this month than Eddie Cantor gets in\r\na year. But when it comes to Mr. Montrose, I really believe that he is\r\nhappier than anybody else, because of all of the understanding and\r\nsympathy he seems to get out of me.\r\n\r\nAnd so I am very happy myself because, after all, the greatest thing in\r\nlife is to always be making everybody else happy. And so, while\r\neverybody is so happy, I really think it is a good time to finish my\r\ndiary because after all, I am to busy going over my senarios with Mr.\r\nMontrose, to keep up any other kind of literary work. And I am so busy\r\nbringing sunshine into the life of Henry that I really think, with\r\neverything else I seem to acomplish, it is all a girl had ought to try\r\nto do. And so I really think that I can say good-bye to my diary\r\nfeeling that, after all, everything always turns out for the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK "GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES" ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
